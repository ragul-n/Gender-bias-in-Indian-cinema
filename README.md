# Gender Bias in Indian Movies
## Intro
The Presence of gender bias in Indian movies is a well-documented phenomenon (see reference). But most of the research on this topic  focuses exclusively on Bollywood movies. Very little attention is paid to movies in other Indian languages.

Here, I am attempting to study gender bias in movies of other Indian languages and do a comparative analysis (including Hindi movies). 

## Data Collection
I am collecting subtitles of Indian movies from OpenSubtitles using thier [API](https://opensubtitles.stoplight.io/docs/opensubtitles-api/e3750fd63a100-getting-started). I am hopeful of getting subtitles for at least 4500 movies, which is already multiple times higher than any other research on this topic has used.
