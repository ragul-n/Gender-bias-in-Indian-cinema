# Gender Bias in Indian Movies
## Intro
The Presence of gender bias in indian movies is well documented phenomenon (see reference). But most of these research just focuses excusively on bollywood movies. Very little attention is paid to movies of other Indian language. 

Here, I am attempting to study gender bias in movies of other Indian laguages and also do a comparitive analysis (inculding hindi movies). This is important in Indian context because as they say, the people and the culture in India changes every 100-200 kms. 

## Data Collection
I am collecting subtitles of Indian movies from [OpenSubtitles API](https://opensubtitles.stoplight.io/docs/opensubtitles-api/e3750fd63a100-getting-started). I am hopeful of getting subtitles of at least 4500 movies, which is already multiple times higher than any other study/research I am aware of.
