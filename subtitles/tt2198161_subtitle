1
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,550
Silence please!

2
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:09,882
Hey Red shirt!
You came 10 minutes late!

3
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:11,717
Can't you go without stamping legs?

4
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:13,883
Usherer, show him his seat please!

5
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,052
Aren't you satisfied with gossip?
Show is about to begin.

6
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,561
Begin the show!

7
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:23,400
You would've come to watch this film
with your family or friends,

8
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,904
could you smile at an unknown
person sitting next to you?

9
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:29,405
Not only in this 180 minutes of film,

10
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:33,740
if perfect strangers meeting on road
can smile at each other like humans,

11
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:37,577
society would be wonderful!

12
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:39,742
Families are the foundations
for such healthy society.

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,909
The corner stone!

14
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,032
Everyone can't do everything fine.

15
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:39,034
Seetha would do this excellently.

16
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:40,695
Looks like she hasn't yet got up.

17
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,865
Shall l wake her up?

18
00:03:43,043 --> 00:03:46,706
You wait for an opportunity
to while away time in gossip.

19
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,370
l'll do it myself.

20
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:53,374
Get up dear!

21
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,719
Get up

22
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,721
Get up! You woke up every day
well before me.

23
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,052
What happened to you today?

24
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,558
Then, l'll put the design
in courtyard.

25
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,722
Later don't lament aunt's design
is much better than mine.

26
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,395
l'm calling you, get up!
Why are you so lazy? Get up! Get up l say!

27
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:17,565
When did you get ready?

28
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:19,575
When means...long back!

29
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,910
Home must have a girl like you,
heart will be peaceful.

30
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:25,574
Then, l'm late!

31
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:28,414
Did Babu bring milk?

32
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:32,755
l forgot!

33
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:35,754
Mother earth!

34
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:39,592
Every step l put on you,
take it as kiss instead of step.

35
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,259
Grandma!

36
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:53,768
Be careful!
- Okay.

37
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,609
Be careful!

38
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:59,615
lt mustn't be there!

39
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:01,617
lt's there!
- Why?

40
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:05,121
lf we it mustn't be there,
it'll be there or vice versa.

41
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,119
You know that?

42
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,284
Don't know, l know everything
just like that!

43
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,292
This jasmine plant was planted by
my mother-in-law when l was very young.

44
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,128
Don't know at what auspicious
time she planted it,

45
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,634
it keeps on blooming!

46
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:22,305
One must do something good
in life before going away!

47
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,803
Ask her what did she do?

48
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:30,473
l've given my son as her husband.
What else she wants?

49
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,144
Give it to me, l'll take it to home.

50
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,482
Okay sir. Bye sir.
- Okay.

51
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,661
Greetings sir.
- Where are you coming from early morning?

52
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,993
Had work near temple,
going home after finishing it.

53
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,495
We're going to farm.
- Okay.

54
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:54,162
Are you doing fine?

55
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,849
Why are you ignoring me?

56
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:12,685
Are you doing fine?
Okay, go.

57
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:41,051
She's his sister's daughter!

58
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:45,385
She knows what people want
and what they think!

59
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,552
Sari is good!
- Very good!

60
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,560
Where's your aunt?

61
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:03,899
God! The difficulties which
we can overcome,

62
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:06,568
protect us from getting arrogant!

63
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:09,578
What?

64
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,740
Look there, Lord Rama and Seetha!
Here we both!

65
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,409
Difficulties?

66
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:18,580
Did you see or not, Rama is not
putting his hand on Seetha.

67
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:23,756
Keep laughing, we spent 30 years
together with this laugh,

68
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,589
not much long time?

69
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:26,595
What happened?
- What should happen?

70
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:29,766
lf children settle in time and marry,

71
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:33,599
if this home is happy
with grandchildren
how nice it would be!

72
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:35,768
The elder one can't stand a remark!

73
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,100
The younger one talks his
way out from everything.

74
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:39,768
Don't know how...
- Leave it.

75
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:42,278
lf there's anything,
they'll take care of it themselves.

76
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:45,781
They must, if not they who else would?

77
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,626
Like a sky is falling upon...
like an unexpected disaster is befalling...

78
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,132
Few bother, what next?

79
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:11,802
Some say be smart to find opportunities
to overcome hurdles to stay ahead...

80
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:16,142
Think of something and
something else happening...

81
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:19,649
Accepting it as fate
is philosophy...

82
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,984
Keep searching for something,
ask for everything...

83
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,152
Creating scene saying
no one would do it...

84
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,991
What shall we do?

85
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,497
What can we do even if we think?

86
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,498
What shall we foresee?

87
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,001
There's unknown void before us...

88
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:40,833
What shall we say?

89
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:43,339
Who asked us?
What's there to say anyway?

90
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:36,722
Follow...the world...

91
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:41,060
Say...what the world says...

92
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:45,227
Trouble inside...

93
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:49,899
Dare take on me...

94
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:54,069
Don't ask which way to go, bro...

95
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:58,240
How to tell this is the right way?

96
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:00,579
People know this...

97
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:02,914
No use in making vain tries...

98
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:11,258
lt's difficult to face the heat...

99
00:10:55,475 --> 00:11:03,974
We do many things...
We madly run after unknown...

100
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,143
We bother ourselves a lot...

101
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:12,655
We say this is life...

102
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:17,159
This journey of confusion
is going for eons...

103
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,323
Life is movement forward
without looking back...

104
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:25,665
Life is a mystery,
don't ask about that...

105
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:27,999
Not knowing it is unknown difficulty...

106
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:34,010
No use in asking or getting angry...

107
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:02,205
What's good about?
Life's just going wrong way!

108
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,206
To hell with your good morning.

109
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:13,207
First time l'm seeing some
hitting a computer so strongly.

110
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:15,547
Not even smiles!

111
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:19,718
Why are you with long faces?
Making your own plans inside.

112
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:21,553
What happened?
- Didn't you see it down?

113
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:24,560
Englishmen have said it in English,
everyone's getting fired!

114
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,561
Why are you telling him?

115
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,893
l don't know about others
but he's sure to escape!

116
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:30,558
Boss is his uncle!

117
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:33,899
Sir, uncle is calling you.

118
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,402
l'll check if it's true or not.

119
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:46,411
Why should we get tensed and
waste our time on this, sir?

120
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:49,248
What we chiefly need is this!

121
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,958
Are you telling me indirectly to
shut the TV and mind my work?

122
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:01,093
Come in.
- He's inside already.

123
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:03,929
Your boy appears dull
but he's very tough.

124
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:06,760
Sit down.

125
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,443
How long can you depend
on contract jobs?

126
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:16,104
You should've found anotherjob by now.

127
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,442
Are you keeping or firing me?

128
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,278
That's the problem with you.

129
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:22,944
You may think though l know you
well but didn't help you.

130
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:26,455
Mustn't let others tell you.
You must be fast!

131
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:29,288
Tell me if there's anything new,
l'm already irritated!

132
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:32,795
That's your...
- Look at my face and say that!

133
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,123
l'm telling it on your face!

134
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:38,464
Boys of 23 or 24 years are
earning a lakh every month.

135
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:42,631
Did you ever compare with them
and thought about your position?

136
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:44,639
You don't do that but get angry!

137
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,970
l've been seeing you for 6 years,

138
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:48,306
did you ever say good morning
to anyone here?

139
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:50,972
You don't know to be smart!
Don't know how to live!

140
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,143
Just like you your father too was
straightforward and lost his property.

141
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,312
Moreover glosses it as goodness.

142
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:59,484
When times are hard, we've to bow!

143
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:04,160
Look, we don't have anything
left even to sell!

144
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,164
What's wrong if l'm like this?
l'll be like myself.

145
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,165
Worries about not saying good morning.

146
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:13,495
Worry if l didn't greet you,
don't worry about others.

147
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,504
Would people take money with them?

148
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:18,742
Many people have left this place,
there's no one here to count.

149
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:21,006
To hell with yourjob!

150
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:26,849
3 years have passed since
we arrived here.

151
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,511
Would've faced 30 interviews.
Why software jobs have become so tough?

152
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,520
Give it to me, junior!

153
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:33,181
Can't even smoke a cigarette peacefully.

154
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,520
Smoke and kill yourself, go!

155
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:41,693
Where did she get her waist done?
lt's so thin!

156
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:49,868
You look handsome and innocent.
But nasty comments!

157
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,704
One can judge a man by his dirty friends!

158
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,774
What's this buddy? You pass the
comment and we get chided!

159
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,712
Had it been in our Vijayawada?
Do you know the reaction?

160
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,717
l'm also from Vijayawada,
my home is in Benz circle!

161
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:04,719
Buddy, you deal with her.

162
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,551
When you're sixty,

163
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:10,389
you must have memories that
people used to pass comments,

164
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,561
if possible encourage people to be active

165
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,563
don't make them lazy compulsorily.

166
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,398
Go to college, you're getting late.

167
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:22,897
She was fine but turned into
a devil after seeing you.

168
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:26,572
lf one in home settles
others can manage it.

169
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,579
There's nothing like small or big
in jobs, do whatever you get!

170
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,582
My dad has minted money but
insists on making your own money.

171
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,083
l don't get him.

172
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,750
What?

173
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,921
What's up, bro?

174
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:40,752
l can hear you, go ahead.

175
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,587
l...
- You...?

176
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:44,422
l left the job.

177
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:47,930
Good! He's up to it again.

178
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,597
Did you find another one?

179
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:56,264
l'll think about that later,
for now l quit the job.

180
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:58,433
You take decisions quickly.

181
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,600
l can never do like that.

182
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:01,610
My foot! There's a limit for everything.

183
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:03,271
Would l remain like this forever?

184
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,610
You're right, if we hit
we must hit the jackpot!

185
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:09,949
Don't struggle for few thousands.
Go back home! l'm here.

186
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:13,288
Did you tell dad about this?

187
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,450
l'm not telling anyone,
l've told you, that's it.

188
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:17,118
l'm packing off from here.

189
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,621
What else?
- What else, bro?

190
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:27,799
Tell me.
- Okay bye.

191
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:29,137
Okay.

192
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:42,147
There's a limit for everything,
is it there?

193
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,480
Would it remain like that forever?

194
00:16:51,997 --> 00:17:01,895
Common man, don't live a
nondescript life among 700 crores...

195
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:12,513
What's there on the other side that
you run towards a mythical future?

196
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:19,184
He's Kondal Rao's son!

197
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:20,848
Doesn't he have a name?

198
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,857
People call him as Goodu Raju!

199
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:24,188
By the way who is Kondal Rao?

200
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:27,021
What's cooking in your home today?

201
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,862
He wants the world to know
it's fish today in his home.

202
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,697
By the way, are they good
or bad people?

203
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:34,203
Even God isn't bothered about it.

204
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:35,704
Why should we bother?

205
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:36,933
Let's see, what's their trouble?

206
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:55,220
Are you playing cards?
Who got the joker?

207
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:57,555
Nobody got it?

208
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,063
How can anyone get?
The joker is with me.

209
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:05,063
Useless Jilebis,
why don't you eat Kajjikayalu?

210
00:18:05,237 --> 00:18:06,226
Mind your business, man!

211
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:09,897
You said you're going to Dubai,
didn't you go or didn't they allow you?

212
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:12,407
There's no better country
than lndia to live.

213
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:16,070
We can sneeze, spit or sleep
wherever we feel like.

214
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:17,738
Anyone who rubs against you would perish,

215
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:21,409
if not he will perish
because he rubbed against you.

216
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:24,579
He's a tricky man!
- Am l?

217
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,282
He's my brother-in-law, right?
Making fun of me.

218
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:31,089
Are you doing fine?
- Fine sir.

219
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:33,595
Look at him! How beautifully he's
coming with a smile!

220
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:36,929
That smile can change the mind
of a man committing suicide.

221
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:39,935
Don't praise him always,
do some work to make this country rich.

222
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:43,438
Can you or your son ever smile
and be friendly like him?

223
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:46,601
lf my son had been good,
why would l comment about others?

224
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,939
l would've got Seetha married to him.

225
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:51,947
Shut up! Are you eying Seetha too?

226
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:56,110
Let anyone may have any idea,
Seetha is for his elder son!

227
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:58,449
Though she lost her parents as child,

228
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,785
they brought her up with love and care.

229
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,291
lt will happen, that's it.

230
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:04,292
You're thinking from her mother's side,

231
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,452
what about her father's side?

232
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:07,462
Those Vijayawada people,
they're not in talking terms with them.

233
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,123
moreover they consider
these people as poor.

234
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:12,793
lsn't that enough?
lt will not happen.

235
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,469
Brother!

236
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:17,972
You've stopped talking to me!

237
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:21,476
How swiftly he changed the colour?

238
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,979
Did l change? l'm so close to him!

239
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:27,482
Madam, looks like the elder one has
come back with his entire luggage.

240
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:32,647
He leaves money in pockets,
check before washing.

241
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:36,488
Recently l found a lakh and
gave it as dowry for my daughter.

242
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:40,655
You will give a lakh or two!

243
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,996
She never wears the same sari again,
she's doing much better.

244
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:48,663
Get them marries,
their wives will take care of them.

245
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:50,672
Did we say no to them?

246
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:54,006
Their sister is studying in Anakapalle.

247
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,669
After studies she'll get married first.

248
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:56,837
Then, elder one will marry immediately.

249
00:19:57,016 --> 00:20:00,349
Younger one will marry on
the same evening.

250
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,852
No need to search a girl for elder one,
Seetha will make perfect match for him.

251
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:09,017
No, l'll not marry him.
Never, he always calls me hey!

252
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:11,025
Did he ever call me by my name?

253
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:14,029
Let him to call me Seetha,
l'll marry him next moment.

254
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:27,409
What?

255
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,547
Hey you! What?

256
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:37,215
Flowers in tresses, sari...
you look like Goddess Poleramma.

257
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,720
Go away!

258
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:46,554
Do you know this, uncle?
He has left the job again.

259
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:47,391
How do you know that?

260
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,727
Don't know, l know everything
just like that!

261
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:55,066
Seetha, you too come and listen this.

262
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:59,237
Last night Goddess Lakshmi
appeared in my dream,

263
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:03,745
she presented a gold and
silver vessel to our sons,

264
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,248
and said all our problems are over!

265
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:09,243
True!
- Okay...

266
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:11,583
Nothing short in this laugh!

267
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,432
Looks like elder one is leaving early.

268
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:28,471
Hey son! l've made coffee for you.

269
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,766
Where's he? Where did he go?

270
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:35,277
He has gone to office.
- So early?

271
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:41,446
Park it here, good place.

272
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:43,611
lt seems you passed comments on brother.

273
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,279
Leave my shirt.
- We too are unemployed.

274
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:46,947
We too are unemployed.

275
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:48,286
What's going on there?

276
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,786
You got saved because brother is here,
l'll take you to task later.

277
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,798
Nothing brother,
Goodu Raju and his sidekicks.

278
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:57,799
Can't bear to see their overacting!

279
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,631
Don't get so excited!

280
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:01,466
What's this?

281
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,471
ls it nice? Do you've any sense?

282
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:05,303
What are you doing in a school?

283
00:22:05,477 --> 00:22:08,139
Though you've no work,
didn't you find any other game to play?

284
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:09,803
Go...clear out.

285
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:13,474
l'll call police,
you'll get the stick.

286
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,481
Will you call police?

287
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:20,489
Crows are crowing over there,
have you complained against it?

288
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:25,657
Goods train is rattling out there,
did you lodge complaint against it?

289
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:31,166
Are we the only gang here?
Clear out everyone, we'll also go.

290
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:35,834
Clear them...clear them...
- Should've been born as drama artiste.

291
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:37,839
Raju, elder one is here.

292
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,671
Neither he plays nor
allows us to play.

293
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,506
He always spoils the fun.

294
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:45,847
When did he come?
- What bothers you man?

295
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:50,682
Watch out, l'll give him a shock.
- What bothers you man?

296
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:53,347
Stay away from him!
- Watch out boys!

297
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,015
You'll get kicked!

298
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,351
Brother, that idiot is coming here.

299
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:06,026
Are you back from Vizag?

300
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:08,366
Did you come back or
did they send you out?

301
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:17,376
Jobs are suitable for you,
marry and start playing cards here.

302
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:18,880
We too would get another hand.

303
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:20,882
Hey...

304
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:24,887
lf l get ajob with 1 lakh salary,
can you or your father digest it?

305
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:26,547
Won't you be jealous?

306
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:29,387
lf l beat, you'll start crying, fool!
Go away!

307
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:32,386
First set your body right,
tell him the address.

308
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:35,590
l know it.
- Go.

309
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:41,896
Something around should happen,
if not people would observe us.

310
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:48,076
Hey boy! This is what you call
going up in life!

311
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:50,579
Stop that, we've reached, get up.

312
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,753
l've been watching you for a week.

313
00:24:02,427 --> 00:24:05,760
You've a face which anyone would
like to see again and again.

314
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:10,098
There's a woman behind
every successful man,

315
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,760
l don't mind if you're
not successful,

316
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:14,428
l'll be there behind you!

317
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:19,099
Alexander, Bill Gates...
though they were great men,

318
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,442
they would've begged for
a kiss from their wives!

319
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:25,443
So silly, right?

320
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:29,348
That's why l'm proposing.
What do you say?

321
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,281
lndian women!

322
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:39,624
Stopped making plaits, right?

323
00:24:40,132 --> 00:24:41,656
Where will you keep flowers?

324
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:44,667
How would you know about
a kiss without a flower?

325
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,665
Oh God! All my feelings are dead!

326
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:51,965
Hello Einstein, find a new version
and send down!

327
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:54,977
Go...buy...out with bags!

328
00:24:56,815 --> 00:24:59,477
This is the Vijayawada family
Kondal Rao mentioned about!

329
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:01,380
The new version of the younger one.

330
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:06,150
Why are you still in bed?

331
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:09,658
Still sleeping? lt's already 11 pm!

332
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:12,820
Why are you still sleeping
bunking school? Get up!...

333
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,666
Why are you so lazy?
Girls mustn't sleep for so long, get up.

334
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:22,004
l like only two things,

335
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:25,007
one is good sleep and
another is good husband.

336
00:25:25,177 --> 00:25:27,509
Good, anyway your sister's
marriage is fixed,

337
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,011
Let's find a good boy in the
marriage and fix your marriage too.

338
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:33,015
l know the man l want.

339
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,683
Get up!

340
00:25:57,042 --> 00:26:01,035
Will he be six feet tall?
Would he tie the knot with me?

341
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:05,707
Would he give whatever l ask?

342
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:10,218
Would he bait me?
Would he tease me?

343
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:14,723
Would he impress everyone?

344
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:19,387
Why don't you stand properly?

345
00:26:19,564 --> 00:26:23,227
Don't feel embarrassed...

346
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:28,465
Don't just walk away without
answering us...

347
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:13,942
He must carry me whenever l wish
without any delay...

348
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:18,453
Praising my beauty must
become his habit...

349
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:22,957
What would l ask for more
if he shares all my work?

350
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:32,467
Sensing my anger he must
at once be modest with me...

351
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:37,301
He must be determined
to fulfill my wish...

352
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:45,645
My youth is eagerly waiting
to see him...

353
00:27:45,817 --> 00:27:50,982
When would he join me?

354
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:15,172
You must believe l'm here.

355
00:28:15,347 --> 00:28:18,680
lf you don't, since you're
seeing me, you've to believe.

356
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,011
Oh Vizag family too is here!

357
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:25,350
You talk very well but didn't
make it to the engagement ceremony.

358
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:28,516
That is...
- No work!

359
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:30,854
He goes around busy
creating trouble like Narada.

360
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:35,193
lt's true, if not
since you said, it will be true.

361
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,361
You'll say this very well.
- Take sweets.

362
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:40,528
How is Seetha?
- Seetha is fine,

363
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:44,197
since she's Seetha,
she will be fine, that's all!

364
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:48,206
Seetha too is very active like this,
she's your cousin, right?

365
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,369
Would you like to taste the sweet?

366
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:51,038
She should've grown differently.

367
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:56,882
We must give her share of property
and find a suitable boy for her.

368
00:28:57,055 --> 00:28:59,717
l wish to spend my last days with her.

369
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:02,553
But the old man wants to marry off
Seetha to his elder son.

370
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,888
He's roaming without ajob.

371
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:09,397
l'm worried he may get Seetha married
to him, l'm unable to do anything.

372
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:14,062
They'll never change.
Don't know how to live!

373
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:17,072
When we don't have time
to count money,

374
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:21,235
how can we spend time
thinking about good and bad?

375
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:25,076
Scams worth lakhs of crores
are common today,

376
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,081
should we bother about that
or their anger and pride?

377
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:30,085
The days are not the same,
it has changed.

378
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:33,918
One must have a vision, that's why
they're there and we're here.

379
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:38,085
l told my brother not to marry her,
he didn't listen,

380
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:41,426
Seetha was born and
killed her parents.

381
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,760
Can l tell a thing?

382
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:45,596
Never spend too much time
with unlucky people.

383
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,261
The less you talk
about them the better.

384
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:52,607
Won't you invite brother
to the marriage?

385
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,267
What's that?

386
00:29:55,447 --> 00:29:57,438
lnvitation.

387
00:29:57,616 --> 00:29:59,277
Take one!
- Okay.

388
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,791
Slowly...slowly...

389
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,632
Whose marriage invitation is this?
lt looks very expensive!

390
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,641
How much it would be...

391
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:32,305
You know whose invitation is this,
you want aunt to hear this, right?

392
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,317
What's going on there?
Don't l know that?

393
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:39,651
Wealthy people will spend like that!
Rich will go to any extent!

394
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:43,154
Neo rich!

395
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:45,159
Would we go if they send
the invitation with someone?

396
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,322
You're sad because they're getting
married but not your son, right aunt?

397
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:51,158
Did l tell you that?

398
00:30:51,336 --> 00:30:53,497
Don't know, l know everything
just like that!

399
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:56,505
What do you know?...

400
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:58,506
Your parents died when you
were just 3 months,

401
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:02,340
though you were his brother's daughter,
they left you here with us.

402
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:06,348
when we went to them for
Chinni's college seat,

403
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:09,351
it seems they made my elder son
wait outside for 4 hours.

404
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,011
How bad he felt!

405
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:12,850
They always behaved like this.

406
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:14,514
They never respected us like humans.

407
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:18,185
lf we do go there, they're worried
about saris and jewels.

408
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:19,523
Who wants all that?

409
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,694
Elder one!

410
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:27,201
He's home, play your drama with him.

411
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,199
Are you here only?

412
00:31:32,377 --> 00:31:34,038
Must go to Vijayawada marriage.

413
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:38,376
Whose marriage?
- Our relatives.

414
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:43,710
We'll not go.
- No, my son...listen to me.

415
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:46,379
l've to go to Vizag,
must bring back your sister.

416
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:48,048
Anyway, they're not strangers, right?

417
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:51,559
Our relatives,
many others would come there. Son!

418
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,727
You know l won't go,
why do you insist me to go?

419
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:56,727
l'll not go, they act too much!

420
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,562
They're not in our relatives' list.

421
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:01,570
Well, striking off from list!

422
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,402
Tiffs are nothing, only human's count.

423
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:07,238
Uncle! lf we attend any marriage,

424
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:10,074
tell us if there's any marriage where
they won't ask what are you doing?

425
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:11,408
we both would go!

426
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,079
l'll not go!

427
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,926
Did you see? He's my eldest son,
that's why he refused to go.

428
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:27,587
We both are same!
- Come here.

429
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,424
Younger is there, right?
Let's send him.

430
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:33,935
Send him, he's the right person
for that gang!

431
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:49,942
Please!

432
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:55,786
Once more please!

433
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:58,292
What?

434
00:32:58,463 --> 00:32:59,794
l wanted to see you again!

435
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:03,456
Good omen!

436
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:31,986
They're no ordinary people!
They're a big gang!

437
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,191
Would also go for such a marriage only?

438
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:46,667
Everyone is busy, let's have dinner,
that will complete ourjob here.

439
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:48,005
Would you like to join?

440
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:56,851
When did you come? Come.
- No problem.

441
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:59,012
Don't hesitate, come.

442
00:34:00,024 --> 00:34:02,857
Didn't your parents come? They won't!
They're very sensitive people.

443
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,688
Thank God, you made it.

444
00:34:07,031 --> 00:34:13,027
Didn't l tell about number son-in-law
if he marries anyone of your girls?

445
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:14,193
That's him!

446
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,373
l saw him just now.

447
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:31,711
Please sit down?

448
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,050
Where are you? Hyderabad?

449
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:39,226
What's your brother doing?

450
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,558
Did you recognise me?

451
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:44,258
Your grandma and l used to play
a lot as little girls.

452
00:34:45,403 --> 00:34:47,963
Whatever it is you didn't
get your mother's beauty.

453
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:55,739
Will you just talk to him?
Someone please take him to dinner.

454
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:57,074
l'll take him.

455
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,407
Sit down! Won't we do it
if we get the chance?

456
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:03,577
Seniors get the chance.
You take him.- Okay.

457
00:35:03,755 --> 00:35:04,915
Please.

458
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:23,305
l'm doing B.Tech in Narasapuram.

459
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:29,610
l'm little caste conscious.
l'm maintaining a group too.

460
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:34,949
Can l tell you a thing?
Girls have fallen flat for you.

461
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,450
You too know that!

462
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:38,111
But you're behaving as
if you don't know...

463
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:41,781
lf you're here for a minute more,
l don't know where would l kiss you.

464
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:44,955
l'm tempted!

465
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:46,118
Stop it!

466
00:35:46,631 --> 00:35:49,122
Can have but not so much proud!

467
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,792
Stop it! Boys should have it.

468
00:35:52,971 --> 00:35:55,462
You can't handle him,
Queen Victoria must enter the arena.

469
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,801
Give me way and
wish me all the best.

470
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,141
Give me a cigarette.

471
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:15,318
Who will give match box?

472
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:36,836
l'm Geetha.

473
00:36:39,851 --> 00:36:40,340
Who asked you?

474
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:44,511
Smoking cigarette to show
manliness before girls.

475
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:48,022
Coward people and coward world,
cigarette is for courage.

476
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:51,025
You speak very well.

477
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:56,030
Hey Padal Sathi!
- Who is he?

478
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,691
A man like me!
He would be there somewhere.

479
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:03,697
When a girl is talking to him,
though nervous he tries to look calm.

480
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:08,872
Why should we talk about him?

481
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:14,215
Tell me as a boy
what did you feel on seeing me?

482
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,051
Tell me.

483
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:20,884
You can go.

484
00:37:24,228 --> 00:37:28,221
Do you want to hug or kiss?

485
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:32,392
Were you expecting it?
- l didn't! No way!

486
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,403
You could've lied that you felt like that,
l would've fallen for you.

487
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:52,245
Sister! Aunt is calling you.

488
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:56,925
Calling you!
- Go, she may bite you!

489
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:04,766
To control oneself on seeing
the right kind of girl,

490
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:07,268
not just one, you've to read
hundred Bhagavad Gitas!

491
00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:25,619
You forgot your cell phone.

492
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:27,455
l forgot it wantonly.

493
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,123
You could've told me that.

494
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:35,126
Last night l couldn't sleep
at all, you know that!- Why?

495
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:36,960
Spent night watching you.

496
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,293
Don't know why time's so good on me!

497
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:42,632
Any girl is falling for me
in just 2 minutes.

498
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:48,134
l've seen only her left profile,
let me see her right profile too.

499
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:55,474
Right is better!

500
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:00,483
He has started it again!

501
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:04,985
We met just now, you don't have
any fear of people watching us.

502
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:08,826
Do you've cell phone?
- Daddy's number, l don't have.

503
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,333
Tell hi to use as soap,
what would he do with it?

504
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:13,663
He must give it to you.

505
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:17,496
Go left and then right.

506
00:39:17,675 --> 00:39:19,506
What happened?
- Can't tell, my brother is here.

507
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:23,673
l saw her somewhere
but l don't remember.

508
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,840
Shut up, you saw here
and tried to impress her.

509
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:28,849
You're too smart, you catch it easily.

510
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,352
Okay come.
- Nothing short in talking.

511
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,856
ls our entire group still doing nothing?

512
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:38,018
When we were busy?
- Where are they now?

513
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:40,027
Waiting outside!

514
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,690
Tell them to stay outside only.

515
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:48,263
Mother!
- Wait there, don't come in.

516
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,029
l told you to wait there.

517
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,708
l've told you not to go out together.

518
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:54,867
People would cast evil eyes on you.

519
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:56,035
There's nothing like evil eyes.

520
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:59,706
lt must be warded off outside
but you walked in.

521
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:03,547
Let me do it, may all the evil eyes
cast on you be warded off!

522
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:07,054
Enough! Let's spit!
- You do it.

523
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:09,723
Wash your legs, sons!

524
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:11,225
Hey fat woman!

525
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:14,054
He's here.
- Where would l go?

526
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,894
Leave me.

527
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:19,730
You've grown thin, aren't you eating?

528
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:21,235
Worrying about you.

529
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:24,568
You're not a fat woman
but dangerous woman. l'll bite you!

530
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:27,070
Look at him!

531
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:28,906
Forget about him,
tell me about yourself.

532
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,911
He won't leave her.

533
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:41,251
Offering of Annavaram is so good that
you feel like licking the leaf too.

534
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:49,756
This is our coach, come.

535
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:53,093
Give it to me, dear.
- Uncle! How come you're here?

536
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:55,603
He's uncle from Relangi
l told you about.

537
00:40:57,441 --> 00:41:01,104
l'm very happy to meet you all
though l didn't attend your marriage.

538
00:41:01,612 --> 00:41:03,603
l'm happy for her getting such
good parents-in-law,

539
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:06,113
for you getting such
a good daughter-in-law,

540
00:41:06,284 --> 00:41:10,948
and for meeting so many
good people in one place!

541
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:15,456
Uncle says everybody is good
because he's the best among good!

542
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:24,465
Did you see the girl?
She's very good.

543
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:36,310
Look at the old woman,
how well she's singing!

544
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:39,677
You too are there,
eating and putting on weight.

545
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:42,149
You too must sing like her from now.

546
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,983
Only that talent l lack.
l'm sitting silently.

547
00:41:46,157 --> 00:41:48,318
Both of teach me to sing.
Both are unemployed, right?

548
00:41:48,492 --> 00:41:50,983
Does she really mean it?
- You both sing together!

549
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:52,823
Your coffee, younger one!

550
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,492
Will it come if you clap?
Get up and take it.

551
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,659
Watch out, it will come.

552
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:05,999
He won't have till l give it to him,
take my life like this every day.

553
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:12,004
Both are specimens!
You're having your say!

554
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:15,675
l was wearing twelve bangles
in each hand

555
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:17,684
Your grandpa sold off everything.

556
00:42:17,855 --> 00:42:20,016
l thought you'd buy it for me,

557
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,523
but one watches TV and
another keeps swinging.

558
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:25,856
l'll kill you and throw a feast
of your favourite dish to the town.

559
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,361
l love Pulasa fish!

560
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:30,364
You've to sell your property
to throw a feast with it.

561
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:32,866
You're getting smart, l'll bite you!

562
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:34,698
Wait..wait...

563
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:43,370
Any problem?
Can't you speak in Telugu?

564
00:42:44,215 --> 00:42:46,877
How many people live in the house?
- Why?

565
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:48,882
Census!

566
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,543
How many people have you counted till now?

567
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:53,383
Joined duty 3 days ago,
just now started the work.

568
00:42:54,225 --> 00:42:55,715
Don't worry!

569
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:58,054
Can you see that fat woman?
- Fat woman!

570
00:42:58,229 --> 00:42:59,890
Shut up! l can call her,

571
00:43:00,064 --> 00:43:02,726
if she hears you saying that she'll
crush your fingers between the door.

572
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,391
She-devil! Tell me quickly, l'll go away.

573
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:07,901
Father, mother, my sister,
me and my brother!

574
00:43:08,072 --> 00:43:10,734
Total six!
Six members!

575
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:12,068
Six is my lucky number.

576
00:43:12,243 --> 00:43:14,905
Give me your hand, sir.
- Who would get benefitted? Go!

577
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:21,748
How many people are in this family?

578
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:24,479
How could l forget her?
- How many are there in the house?

579
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:26,754
Where's he? Did he go away?

580
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:28,255
Tell me, how many people are
there in the house?

581
00:43:28,426 --> 00:43:29,415
He'll be here only,
l'll call him back.

582
00:43:29,593 --> 00:43:31,424
Forget about him,
how could you forget about me?

583
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:32,254
l did forget you wantonly.

584
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,091
See, you've forgotten me wantonly.

585
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,426
You always do it.
- Would l do it wantonly?

586
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,261
Don't know, l know everything
just like that!

587
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:40,768
Nobody considers me as
a member of the family.

588
00:43:40,938 --> 00:43:43,429
What's this trouble?
- You too don't consider me as family.

589
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:46,940
What's this?
- What's this trouble?

590
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:48,772
Done!
- What done?

591
00:43:48,946 --> 00:43:50,937
You never keep quiet,
you always bring trouble.

592
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:57,276
Why are you crying dear?

593
00:43:57,455 --> 00:43:59,787
Nobody considers me as
a member of the family,

594
00:43:59,957 --> 00:44:01,788
they didn't even add
my name in census.

595
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,120
Who?
- Who else?

596
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:10,961
Elder one or younger one?
- l don't have anyone.

597
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,296
Why are you crying? Come with me.

598
00:44:13,804 --> 00:44:17,968
Look at yourself while crying!

599
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:19,302
l'll not see!

600
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:21,809
Did you ever behave like you
don't belong to this family?

601
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:23,810
Did you hear her?

602
00:44:23,981 --> 00:44:27,815
To tell the truth,
infact everyone comes after you! Okay?

603
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,981
l'll not see!
- Look how you appear!

604
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:35,982
Don't be so dejected...

605
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,994
Don't worry...don't get tensed...

606
00:44:40,164 --> 00:44:44,157
When you cry,
gloom and sadness take you...

607
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:47,827
Don't make a long face...

608
00:44:48,005 --> 00:44:55,844
Do you've to cry so much
to wet the world around you?

609
00:44:56,013 --> 00:45:05,183
Do you've to be sullen to make
even mirror afraid of seeing you?

610
00:45:05,523 --> 00:45:09,516
Can cries relieve you
of your worries?

611
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:13,686
Why cry then?

612
00:45:13,864 --> 00:45:21,202
Can tears bring back the joy?
Why make useless endeavour?

613
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,223
Can we punish the hot summer?
Can we curse the rains?

614
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:54,235
Can we chase away chill winters?

615
00:45:54,405 --> 00:46:03,074
Do we react angrily or shed tears?
Don't we take it in our stride as it comes...

616
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:10,915
Why are you stubborn not
to walk with others?

617
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:19,587
What would you gain by fighting
others day in and day out?

618
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:12,147
Do you've to sweat it out?
To bring a smile on your lips...

619
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:20,985
Do you've to move mountains or stop
seas to bring cheer in life?

620
00:47:21,158 --> 00:47:28,997
We've to prove we're humans...
a season of sharing love...

621
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:37,835
Doors to the hearts...
a never withering flower is smile...

622
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:14,041
Daddy, please sit for a moment.
- What's it, dear?

623
00:48:14,211 --> 00:48:17,044
l want to tell an important matter, daddy.

624
00:48:17,214 --> 00:48:22,208
My ln-laws have a good proposal
for Relangi uncle's daughter.

625
00:48:22,386 --> 00:48:24,718
We met her while coming back
from Annavaram.

626
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:28,051
Very good proposal,
l'll get busy to leave to US.

627
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,056
That's why l'm telling you
to handle it.

628
00:48:30,227 --> 00:48:32,058
Please take them personally.
Okay?

629
00:48:32,229 --> 00:48:34,561
One more thing.
Don't tell them suddenly.

630
00:48:34,732 --> 00:48:37,223
Tell grandma, she'll manage.

631
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:42,065
Your people are great!
Why do they rush for with proposals?

632
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,901
Moreover for that Relangi people!

633
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:46,906
People would laugh at us!

634
00:48:47,077 --> 00:48:50,569
Sleeping at night with a hope
that tomorrow would be good,

635
00:48:50,748 --> 00:48:53,239
but fear takes over morning
about how life would go?

636
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:55,578
They get kicked between hope and fear,

637
00:48:55,753 --> 00:48:58,415
they keep kicked all the 365 days,

638
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:00,921
we're not one who get kicked
but people who kick!

639
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:03,082
That's the difference between us.

640
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,421
Don't worry about them, be happy.

641
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:09,430
Daddy, you cover up yourjealousy very well.

642
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,761
Why is he behaving like this, mother?

643
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,926
What are we doing? Just a help.

644
00:49:14,438 --> 00:49:18,772
She's just like me.
Do what so ever you can, okay?

645
00:49:18,942 --> 00:49:22,935
ls he one to get kicked or kick?

646
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,440
Do you know this?

647
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:28,107
lf you get 3 aces,
you get loans in Bangkok.

648
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:30,276
l'm not playing.
- What happened to you?

649
00:49:30,454 --> 00:49:35,289
l want to go to loo.
- Don't you want to use rest room?

650
00:49:35,459 --> 00:49:37,120
Look there, you'd feel like using it.

651
00:49:53,143 --> 00:49:54,633
Hey you, come here!

652
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:58,638
Why are you sitting without running away?

653
00:49:58,816 --> 00:50:01,808
Why? We're not with them, sir.

654
00:50:01,985 --> 00:50:05,819
Though you're not with them,
if l book you instead of them,

655
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:07,320
what would you call it?

656
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:09,481
We'll call it as you
don't know anything.

657
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:13,823
Why are you beating him, sir?

658
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:15,191
What's your father's name?

659
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:19,662
What's your father's name?
- Suryanarayana.

660
00:50:20,003 --> 00:50:22,836
Suryanarayana?

661
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:25,668
Won't you get up?

662
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:29,506
lf you're so free,
then what would they be doing?

663
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,013
What's your father's name?
What does he do?

664
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:35,841
What's your father's name?

665
00:50:37,855 --> 00:50:38,685
What's his name?

666
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:51,028
lf l've done wrong, send me to jail
for 14 years, l'll accept it.

667
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,862
You too have a father, right?

668
00:50:53,036 --> 00:50:54,867
You expect others' to respect him, right?

669
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:57,199
Don't you know that?

670
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:04,945
Brother!

671
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:10,717
lt seems your elder son beat Sl!
- Why did he beat him?

672
00:51:10,888 --> 00:51:16,224
He said something about father
and he slapped him.- What?

673
00:51:16,393 --> 00:51:17,883
lt seems he slapped for saying
something on father.

674
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:20,393
You go. Slapped for father!

675
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:28,401
Why are you seeing my cards?
- Unable to see your face.

676
00:51:28,572 --> 00:51:30,733
Play!
- He's here!

677
00:51:35,078 --> 00:51:37,740
When did he come?
- Did my brother come here?

678
00:51:37,915 --> 00:51:39,246
l saw him at centre.

679
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,410
She's trying a lot!

680
00:51:45,088 --> 00:51:47,921
Yes, Surekha!
- Surekha? Who is she?

681
00:51:48,091 --> 00:51:50,082
Some girl! l'm sure she
would be there somewhere.

682
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,750
Feeling jealousy like you.

683
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:55,092
Jealousy? Me? No way!

684
00:51:55,265 --> 00:51:59,929
You could've lied saying yes,
l would've given my life to you.

685
00:52:00,103 --> 00:52:02,936
He's talking to someone.

686
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:04,266
Do you know this?

687
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:07,437
There are six boys
chasing me in my street.

688
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:09,772
Tasteless idiots!

689
00:52:10,948 --> 00:52:13,940
Tell them that they would
end up as Yogi Vemanna.

690
00:52:14,117 --> 00:52:18,451
May l tell you shocking news?
This too is jealousy!

691
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:20,120
She's smart too!

692
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:23,954
Which one?
- This one.

693
00:52:24,127 --> 00:52:28,120
Shout near his ear.
- He'll break my teeth. Do it yourself.

694
00:52:28,632 --> 00:52:32,693
Fools! l'll laugh out loud,
you too join me.- Okay.

695
00:52:33,637 --> 00:52:35,628
Children may die.
- Laugh!

696
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:39,799
My grandmother too would've
done the same with my grandpa.

697
00:52:39,977 --> 00:52:45,643
My great grandmother too would've done
the same with my great grandfather.

698
00:52:45,816 --> 00:52:49,308
Basically you like boys,
to tell openly, you desire them madly.

699
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:53,980
The good days are here for you
to ask directly and take it directly.

700
00:52:54,157 --> 00:52:55,818
These are the words that flattered me.

701
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:58,325
No doubt, you were designed
to do this.

702
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,157
Will you please cut the call?
- lt's sin to cut it.

703
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:09,996
Boys take it as heroism
to cut the call.

704
00:53:10,173 --> 00:53:11,834
Did he cut the call?

705
00:53:14,177 --> 00:53:15,667
You invited trouble unnecessarily
and he's coming here.

706
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:18,508
Let him come, you all are
with me, l'm not scared.

707
00:53:20,517 --> 00:53:22,849
He's going for his bike
not coming to us.

708
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,352
He's leaving home,
don't invite trouble from him.

709
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:27,353
Was it your girl friend?

710
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:34,194
Good! Your brother has one at home
and you've one in phone!

711
00:53:35,198 --> 00:53:38,361
Why should we be afraid?
- Silly idiot!

712
00:53:38,535 --> 00:53:41,868
Your shoulders have grown
but not your brain.

713
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:45,531
ldiot! You're grown like a bull,
tell him boys!

714
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:47,540
He has become a big nuisance
to the place.

715
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:51,044
Don't teach us,
first teach your brother!

716
00:53:51,214 --> 00:53:53,705
Teach him first to run fast!

717
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,876
l've never seen him running
away till now!

718
00:54:00,891 --> 00:54:03,052
Will you giggling jeeringly?

719
00:54:04,895 --> 00:54:07,728
Can you rip coconuts with teeth?

720
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:12,899
Why are you beating him? Beat him!

721
00:54:15,238 --> 00:54:18,230
l don't' mind if he beats him,
ensure he doesn't beat me.

722
00:54:19,076 --> 00:54:21,909
Run fast, he's catching up.

723
00:54:29,419 --> 00:54:29,908
Did he join you or you joined him?

724
00:54:30,087 --> 00:54:31,076
Useless fellow, he doesn't have that much.

725
00:54:31,254 --> 00:54:33,586
Why are you with him then?
- Just for fun...

726
00:54:33,757 --> 00:54:35,247
Just for fun?

727
00:54:36,093 --> 00:54:39,426
Raju, let's play a game!
- To hell with your game!

728
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:41,920
Run!

729
00:54:46,603 --> 00:54:50,095
Why did you stop running? Run!

730
00:54:50,273 --> 00:54:53,436
You were after him, why should l run?

731
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,444
He's an idiot! Bloody fool!

732
00:54:57,614 --> 00:54:58,774
Eat fruits!

733
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:01,280
l'm going to Bhimavaram.

734
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:25,797
Which side is east?
- East? Why? That side!

735
00:55:25,976 --> 00:55:27,967
ls it east whichever side you go?

736
00:55:30,313 --> 00:55:31,302
Who is he?

737
00:55:31,481 --> 00:55:34,143
A man just like me, l'm sure
he would be there somewhere.

738
00:55:34,317 --> 00:55:37,150
He beats up fools like you!

739
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,810
Stand erect!

740
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:56,833
Eat...eat...no...no...

741
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,339
Eat!...

742
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:02,672
What's that?

743
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:05,846
Am l wrong if ant doesn't eat?
- Go away!

744
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:28,034
Serve him few more pieces,
perfect combination for soup.

745
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:36,205
Elder one, your sister has
got a good proposal.

746
00:56:37,047 --> 00:56:40,039
Dasireddy family,
they used to live here long back.

747
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:42,208
They made big money.

748
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,383
lt seems they too have two sons
just like you both.

749
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,881
Both stand by one word.

750
00:56:49,392 --> 00:56:50,882
Who brought the proposal?

751
00:56:59,069 --> 00:56:59,899
Mother...

752
00:57:02,405 --> 00:57:03,064
Mother...

753
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:05,897
Serve food.

754
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:10,410
Why don't you freshen up?
You roam outside.

755
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,571
l'll kill and eat you!

756
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:15,908
Fat woman!
Come fast!

757
00:57:18,255 --> 00:57:21,418
First listen to me, your sister
has got a good proposal.

758
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:26,585
What does he do?
- lt is...l'm unable to tell.

759
00:57:26,763 --> 00:57:28,253
But they're a good family.

760
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:31,594
What did father say?
- What will he say? He too is a good man.

761
00:57:31,768 --> 00:57:36,262
You've grown tall, you both must
suggest good and bad.

762
00:57:36,439 --> 00:57:38,430
Who brought this proposal?

763
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:40,940
That is...

764
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:45,012
Vijayawada family!

765
00:57:47,617 --> 00:57:49,608
Gone!
- Say no to them!

766
00:57:49,786 --> 00:57:51,117
Tell them we're not interested.

767
00:57:51,955 --> 00:57:54,116
Though we don't have property,
we'll find some man.

768
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:57,283
lt seems they brought the proposal
and you're telling us.

769
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,451
Can't we find another groom
in this world?

770
00:58:02,132 --> 00:58:03,793
You must listen to her, right?

771
00:58:04,968 --> 00:58:06,458
l heard her, right?

772
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:09,795
Look, l don't like it.
lf you like it, you can go ahead.

773
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,631
How can there be two opinions?
We stand together, right?

774
00:58:12,809 --> 00:58:14,299
Then, stand by me!

775
00:58:18,648 --> 00:58:21,139
Building relationships isn't
as easy as beating a police man.

776
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:31,654
Shouldn't he sit and talk, mother?
Don't we get angry?

777
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:35,987
lf this is the result for broaching it,

778
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,657
l would ay good bye to the proposal
and Vijayawada family.

779
00:58:38,835 --> 00:58:41,065
You old woman! You started this.

780
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:46,498
Unable to tell people, sir.

781
00:58:56,853 --> 00:59:00,186
lf he's unable to tell,
something must be troubling him.

782
00:59:00,523 --> 00:59:02,013
How can he say there?

783
00:59:03,693 --> 00:59:04,182
Father!

784
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:07,860
l'm going to Hyderabad.
- Anything urgent?

785
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:11,432
No. l've to go, right?
- Stay here for few days.

786
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,202
Okay, go.
- Bye father.

787
00:59:16,373 --> 00:59:18,534
ls elder one coming to drop you?
- He's coming.

788
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,539
ls he coming or shall l come?
- No need.

789
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,870
l'll come if you want.

790
00:59:22,045 --> 00:59:23,205
He's coming, father.

791
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:07,809
l think it's better to go up!
- Let's go.

792
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:25,666
Look at the crowd! Can't they stay
in home, all are out to travel!

793
01:01:25,835 --> 01:01:27,826
Everyone is busy!

794
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:36,502
lsn't S2 our bogie?
- No, it's S3, come.

795
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:39,671
Go...why are you staring at them?

796
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:43,182
lt's always great to come and leave.

797
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,352
Hit...we must hit big time.

798
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:48,514
Do you've money?
- l have.

799
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:50,185
Look at my face and say that.
- l do have.

800
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,022
Do you? You won't have.
Keep this!

801
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,690
l do have money!

802
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,029
Get in!

803
01:02:02,872 --> 01:02:07,536
Train is leaving, walk faster!
- You're making me run here and there.

804
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:13,709
Call me after reaching there.

805
01:02:35,238 --> 01:02:38,401
l've been seeing their act!

806
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:40,406
Train must hit them!

807
01:02:40,577 --> 01:02:42,067
Saying bye so much!

808
01:02:45,582 --> 01:02:47,743
He said that for fun,

809
01:02:48,918 --> 01:02:51,250
it won't happen!...

810
01:02:57,594 --> 01:03:01,086
What's this?
- l don't feel like going!

811
01:03:05,935 --> 01:03:07,425
Okay come....come.

812
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,769
Father!

813
01:03:18,948 --> 01:03:21,109
Who is it?
- Who is it?

814
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:22,945
There's no one here who won't tell
about him if you ask.

815
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,450
l'll take you to him personally.

816
01:03:24,621 --> 01:03:28,113
No need, come let's take them.
- Come.

817
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:32,455
On that bike? No way! Sit properly.
You follow me.

818
01:03:33,463 --> 01:03:34,623
Strange place!

819
01:03:34,797 --> 01:03:37,129
Asked about one man
and so many are ready to guide us.

820
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,130
Brother!

821
01:03:39,636 --> 01:03:40,967
Brother, marriage party is here.

822
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:48,470
Did you recognise me? Kinsman of
your Vijayawada brother-in-law.

823
01:03:48,645 --> 01:03:50,636
Oh you? How do you do?

824
01:03:50,813 --> 01:03:53,646
Please don't mistake us for coming
to see the bride without intimation.

825
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:03,823
They didn't even tell about coming,
they've dropped in suddenly.

826
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,654
Luck is always like that!

827
01:04:05,828 --> 01:04:08,661
Don't exert yourself in excitement.

828
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:11,163
She does it and is advising me.

829
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:29,682
Are they good people, elder one?

830
01:04:41,864 --> 01:04:45,027
Are they good people, younger one?

831
01:04:45,201 --> 01:04:46,361
Super!

832
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,202
When everyone has said yes,
who cares about my opinion?

833
01:04:58,715 --> 01:04:59,875
Ask anything if you want.

834
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:02,540
Did you see black and white
film 'Thodikodallu'?

835
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,552
Because there would be two
in home along with you.

836
01:05:09,058 --> 01:05:10,389
You've seen film 'Gundamma Katha', right?

837
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,051
They are like those two brothers!

838
01:05:13,229 --> 01:05:15,220
She's their sister, you needn't
have to worry about anything.

839
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:16,387
Fix it!

840
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:30,103
Offering...offering...

841
01:05:31,414 --> 01:05:34,076
You can gossip later,
accept the offering.

842
01:05:36,919 --> 01:05:39,752
Will you make me stand
an hour for offering?

843
01:05:39,922 --> 01:05:43,915
Who do you think l am?
l'm MLA of this constituency.

844
01:05:44,093 --> 01:05:47,927
ls this the way you respect an MLA?
Call your EO.

845
01:05:48,097 --> 01:05:49,758
How dare you make an MLA
stand here for an hour!

846
01:05:49,932 --> 01:05:52,264
Please don't take it serious,
heavy influx of devotees.

847
01:05:52,435 --> 01:05:53,925
Please come with me, sir.

848
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:56,594
Go...go...take offering.

849
01:06:09,952 --> 01:06:12,284
Why are you smiling at me?
Do you know me?

850
01:06:12,455 --> 01:06:14,946
Do l know you?
Did you ever see me?

851
01:06:15,124 --> 01:06:17,957
Just now l saw you arguing with them.

852
01:06:18,127 --> 01:06:20,118
lnstead of ignoring it,

853
01:06:20,296 --> 01:06:24,790
l thought it's better to smile, that's all.

854
01:06:25,301 --> 01:06:28,134
Would we get angry without any reason?- No...

855
01:06:28,304 --> 01:06:32,468
You would've crossed many bridges and
difficulties to reach this position.

856
01:06:32,642 --> 01:06:35,873
ls it possible for everyone to reach
a position of ruling over people?

857
01:06:36,312 --> 01:06:39,804
l hate this system!

858
01:06:39,982 --> 01:06:42,143
Why should we bother about system, sir?

859
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:45,981
Newspaper write about so many
things happening around,

860
01:06:46,489 --> 01:06:50,653
we are common people who pray God
we mustn't get caught in that.

861
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,493
lf we've time, we'll visit temple
if not we'll pray from home.

862
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:55,995
Accept the offering.

863
01:06:56,332 --> 01:06:57,492
Please, sir.

864
01:06:59,502 --> 01:07:02,665
Which place are you from?
- Quite a far place, sir.

865
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:04,500
My daughter's marriage invitation.

866
01:07:04,674 --> 01:07:06,505
l'm here to keep it
at the feet of lord.

867
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:10,168
Don't know why whenever l come here,
l feel Rama and Seetha follow me to home.

868
01:07:10,346 --> 01:07:12,177
Who else is there for us
other than them?

869
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:14,673
Come with me, l'll get the
invitation kept at lord's feet.

870
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:28,190
Jasmine twig in the
courtyard of Seethamma...

871
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:32,198
lt is blooming with flowers...

872
01:07:32,368 --> 01:07:35,860
Pluck the flowers without
disturbing the branch...

873
01:07:36,038 --> 01:07:40,031
Deck Seethamma's tresses
with jasmine...

874
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:43,872
Flowers in the tresses are
spreading fragrance...

875
01:07:44,046 --> 01:07:48,380
Kodanda Ramayya is coming...

876
01:08:03,399 --> 01:08:06,891
Marriage band is ranting the sky...

877
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:10,561
Hear the rhythm and beat of music...

878
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:14,232
Lord Sri Hari is marrying
Goddess Siri...

879
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,573
Come to wish and bless them...

880
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:21,914
To give right meaning of
Telugu marriage rituals...

881
01:08:22,084 --> 01:08:25,247
To show it in action and spirit...

882
01:08:25,421 --> 01:08:28,584
We'll celebrate amidst thundering
ovation from the guests...

883
01:08:28,758 --> 01:08:36,096
You're a beautiful doll...
Your man is here to tie the knot...

884
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:44,434
To become a partner of life...
Accept his hand, O lady...

885
01:09:19,642 --> 01:09:22,975
No use to say we've seen
many such things...

886
01:09:23,145 --> 01:09:26,808
You don't know the weight
till you carry it...

887
01:09:26,983 --> 01:09:29,975
Though putting up a brave face...
there's a bit of nervousness inside...

888
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:37,149
lt's natural for you to be
burdened with beauty and shyness...

889
01:09:37,326 --> 01:09:40,818
Atlast time has burdened us
with work...

890
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:44,660
Though we're men,
we carry on with smile...

891
01:09:44,834 --> 01:09:48,668
We'll feel proud leisurely
after the victory flag is hoisted...

892
01:11:09,919 --> 01:11:13,411
lf it was Vijayawada, l wouldn't
do it, workers would do it.

893
01:11:13,756 --> 01:11:17,419
Where's the elder one?
Are you here? Come here!

894
01:11:18,427 --> 01:11:21,919
Guests wouldn't bother about feast,

895
01:11:22,098 --> 01:11:24,089
they would bother about how we
welcomed and inquired about them.

896
01:11:24,266 --> 01:11:27,099
You must stand at entrance and
welcome everyone personally.

897
01:11:27,269 --> 01:11:28,429
Me?
- Has Vijayawada family arrived?

898
01:11:28,938 --> 01:11:30,599
On the way, boys are bringing
them personally.

899
01:11:30,773 --> 01:11:35,437
Guests would come there also,
you too must say hello to them.

900
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:36,942
You both must look after the guests.

901
01:11:37,113 --> 01:11:37,772
Brother!

902
01:11:38,781 --> 01:11:39,941
Look who's here?

903
01:11:40,116 --> 01:11:41,606
How are you doing?
- Fine.

904
01:11:41,951 --> 01:11:44,943
He was here but shifted to
Hyderabad and made good money.

905
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:46,281
Very good man.

906
01:11:46,455 --> 01:11:48,480
My elder son and younger son.

907
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,615
What do you do?

908
01:11:50,793 --> 01:11:53,455
He was in Vizag, he quit the job.

909
01:11:53,629 --> 01:11:55,790
Come to Hyderabad,
l've lot of friends.

910

l can get you ajob in minutes.

911
01:11:57,633 --> 01:11:59,294
Your father knows very well about me.

912
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:01,629
Send him sir, he must remain jobless.

913
01:12:01,804 --> 01:12:03,965
Send him, we're there for you.
- l'll send him, come in.

914
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,630
Please take him.
- Come.

915
01:12:05,808 --> 01:12:07,969
You come, you be on the job.

916
01:12:08,477 --> 01:12:09,967
You're younger son, where are you?

917
01:12:10,146 --> 01:12:12,137
Where in Hyderabad?

918
01:12:12,314 --> 01:12:14,305
Where ever l feel like, please come.

919
01:12:14,984 --> 01:12:16,144
Smart boy!

920
01:12:19,989 --> 01:12:22,150
Are you the elder son?
What are you doing?

921
01:12:23,826 --> 01:12:24,485
Please!

922
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,994
What are you doing now?
l saw you as a little boy.

923
01:12:29,832 --> 01:12:32,665
Are you fine, boy?
What are you doing?

924
01:12:32,835 --> 01:12:35,668
What bothers you, uncle?
You're asking for formality.

925
01:12:35,838 --> 01:12:37,669
You came to attend marriage, right?
Have dinner and go.

926
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,502
Serve him well, he looks very weak.

927
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:41,673
Everyone asks the same question.

928
01:12:41,844 --> 01:12:45,678
Everyone asks, what do you do?

929
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,544
Go..go...have dinner.

930
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,031
Why is he doing the duty which he hates?

931
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:17,702
His father taught him to smile
not how to live!

932
01:13:23,052 --> 01:13:26,715
Can't see him here?
- You came and added sheen!

933
01:13:26,889 --> 01:13:29,551
lf you don't come, since you came
it will add sheen.

934
01:13:29,725 --> 01:13:31,716
Why have you grown thin?
Didn't you eat the sweets l brought?

935
01:13:31,894 --> 01:13:33,384
Please come.

936
01:13:49,912 --> 01:13:51,402
Are you fine, younger one?

937
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:54,242
You've proved Relangi people's
reputation. Arranged it well.

938
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:56,577
Everyone has his own thing!
Please come.

939
01:13:59,255 --> 01:14:02,918
We can't do it, brother!
Your brother is managing it very well.

940
01:14:03,425 --> 01:14:05,586
Where are the keys?
- How do l know?

941
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:10,323
Are you doing well, Seetha?

942
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:12,594
lt's been years since l've seen you.

943
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,100
l'll be back in a minute.

944
01:14:21,443 --> 01:14:24,276
Hey younger one, call aunt!

945
01:14:28,117 --> 01:14:30,608
Why are you going away without
talking to us?

946
01:14:30,786 --> 01:14:31,775
That is...

947
01:14:31,954 --> 01:14:33,285
Will you marry my niece?

948
01:14:33,455 --> 01:14:36,618
Should he marry your niece?
Can't he marry my daughter?

949
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:39,454
Anyone would be ready to give their
daughter to him in marriage.

950
01:14:39,628 --> 01:14:41,459
Stay put here,
l'll come back in a minute.

951
01:14:42,798 --> 01:14:45,961
They're like pumpkins,
how would their daughters be?

952
01:14:46,135 --> 01:14:48,626
Marry off every girl here to him!

953
01:14:50,472 --> 01:14:51,302
Younger one!

954
01:14:52,474 --> 01:14:53,634
Younger one!

955
01:14:59,481 --> 01:15:01,142
You're acting too proud!

956
01:15:01,483 --> 01:15:03,474
Arrogance of being handsome!

957
01:15:06,822 --> 01:15:07,652
Who is he?

958
01:15:07,823 --> 01:15:10,155
Someone, l'm sure he will
be there somewhere.

959
01:15:10,326 --> 01:15:13,659
He too like me when a girl is
madly in love with him,

960
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:16,161
he's always tensed about
someone watching them.

961
01:15:16,832 --> 01:15:19,323
Shall we also marry in
a coconut farm like this?

962
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:22,993
lf it rains we can marry getting wet.

963
01:15:23,505 --> 01:15:25,336
Did you hear everything?
Please go!

964
01:15:26,842 --> 01:15:28,002
Wait for few minutes, l'll come back.

965
01:15:28,177 --> 01:15:30,338
She's too smart,
can't get rid of her easily.

966
01:15:30,846 --> 01:15:32,677
Are you eating or serving?
- Both!- Go!

967
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:56,361
What's your idea about Seetha?

968
01:15:57,206 --> 01:16:00,198
Looks like they're planning
to marry her off to elder one.

969
01:16:00,376 --> 01:16:01,536
Planning?

970
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,371
lt's fixed that Seetha
would become wife of elder one.

971
01:16:03,545 --> 01:16:04,534
What do you say?

972
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:07,045
They call it something...what's that?

973
01:16:07,216 --> 01:16:08,376
Can't get it right?
- Sweet kajjikaya?

974
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:10,541
You keep quiet.
- Silly!

975
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,880
Can't get the right word
at right time!

976
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:16,889
Qualification!
One must have it.

977
01:16:17,059 --> 01:16:19,391
Are you saying he has or not?

978
01:16:21,397 --> 01:16:23,388
Water please!
- Get water quickly.

979
01:16:23,565 --> 01:16:25,726
Elder one, get water immediately!
Water please!

980
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:30,401
Give him!

981
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,411
Can't you bring it full?

982
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,914
Always does everything half!

983
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:45,743
Never do anything with half knowledge.

984
01:16:46,422 --> 01:16:48,913
No use in arranging marriage
in coconut farm,

985
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:50,922
you've to take care of
guests well, right?

986
01:16:51,093 --> 01:16:53,254
Are you serving only half
in dinner too?

987
01:16:53,929 --> 01:16:55,794
When will you change?

988
01:16:58,267 --> 01:17:00,258
lf possible eat what we serve
and bless the couple.

989
01:17:00,769 --> 01:17:02,930
Don't say anything with
an ulterior motive.

990
01:17:03,105 --> 01:17:06,768
Half knowledge?
You be firm on one thing!

991
01:17:08,777 --> 01:17:10,267
Why did you tell him like that?

992
01:17:12,781 --> 01:17:17,445
His bad luck is that l'm trying
to tell you don't know,

993
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:20,179
and he can't accept the fact
that he doesn't know anything,

994
01:17:20,956 --> 01:17:24,119
and you're asking about
Seetha's marriage with him,

995
01:17:24,293 --> 01:17:25,783
and l'm hearing that patiently.

996
01:17:25,961 --> 01:17:29,124
Did l tell l would marry Seetha?...

997
01:17:29,465 --> 01:17:31,797
Tell me, did l?
- Elder one calm down!

998
01:17:31,967 --> 01:17:33,298
lt's normal in marriages.

999
01:17:33,469 --> 01:17:34,299
lf you marry Seetha,

1000
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:36,802
whether you agree
or not, he must wash your feet!

1001
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,630
Why are you refusing to marry Seetha?

1002
01:17:39,808 --> 01:17:42,140
We all think you'd marry Seetha.

1003
01:17:42,311 --> 01:17:44,142
Come...come...
- What's it then, uncle?

1004
01:17:45,147 --> 01:17:46,978
Every time he chides saying
we don't know anything.

1005
01:17:47,149 --> 01:17:50,141
What does he know about us?
Did he help us?

1006
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:52,219
lf he talks bad about us,
l'll break his teeth!

1007
01:17:52,654 --> 01:17:56,818
Without my daughter's help,
couldn't' get a decent proposal till now.

1008
01:17:58,327 --> 01:17:59,157
lnfact you must wash my feet...

1009
01:17:59,328 --> 01:18:02,491
...and sprinkle that water
on your head all your life.

1010
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:07,499
What is he talking about?
What's it all about?

1011
01:18:16,345 --> 01:18:18,176
Brother, told me to remind you
at the auspicious time.

1012
01:18:18,347 --> 01:18:22,010
What's that? Everyone belittles me!

1013
01:18:28,023 --> 01:18:30,014
Hey younger one, come here.

1014
01:18:32,361 --> 01:18:33,191
Where's the elder one?

1015
01:18:34,863 --> 01:18:35,852
l think he's on some job.

1016
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,864
Tell him to do it later,
ask him to come and bless her.

1017
01:18:53,715 --> 01:18:55,876
What are you doing here?

1018
01:18:56,051 --> 01:18:58,212
People are waiting there for you.
Come.

1019
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:04,552
What happened to him?

1020
01:19:06,228 --> 01:19:08,059
Why are you off the mood now? Come.

1021
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:10,391
How should l be?
- How should you be?

1022
01:19:11,066 --> 01:19:13,057
How?
- l meant how should l be?

1023
01:19:20,075 --> 01:19:21,906
Are you angry because they have
fixed the marriage against your wish?

1024
01:19:22,744 --> 01:19:23,904
Who you are angry on?

1025
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:27,746
Mother? Father?
Or me?

1026
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:29,747
Who would keep quiet if
l show my anger anyone?

1027
01:19:29,918 --> 01:19:30,748
What's it then?

1028
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:35,583
Never again in life we must talk or
enter the house of Vijayawada family.

1029
01:19:35,757 --> 01:19:37,247
Relationship between us
is snapped permanently.

1030
01:19:37,426 --> 01:19:38,415
Did they say anything?

1031
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:41,092
l'll ask them. Bloody!

1032
01:19:41,263 --> 01:19:43,595
Everyone has their own pride!
What did they say?

1033
01:19:44,266 --> 01:19:45,756
Everyone will ask it.

1034
01:19:45,934 --> 01:19:49,097
Attended...their marriages...
housewarming ceremony,

1035
01:19:49,271 --> 01:19:50,761
and fixed marriage too!

1036
01:19:56,778 --> 01:19:59,440
Whose marriage is this?
lsn't it our sister's marriage?

1037
01:19:59,615 --> 01:20:00,775
Not some stranger's, right?

1038
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:03,281
Don't l know that?
Can't l think about that?

1039
01:20:03,785 --> 01:20:05,946
l can't bow my head to
every Tom, Dick and Harry.

1040
01:20:06,121 --> 01:20:07,952
l'll be like this,
l'll be like what l'm.

1041
01:20:08,123 --> 01:20:09,112
That's what l'm telling you,

1042
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,619
you can't be like that!
This is life!

1043
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,621
Can't be adamant like that!

1044
01:20:13,962 --> 01:20:15,122
lf it not possible, l'll go away.

1045
01:20:15,297 --> 01:20:17,629
Go away, everyone talks about life,
l'll go away.

1046
01:20:17,799 --> 01:20:20,962
Can't watch you go away, can l?
We'll not let you go!

1047
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:22,960
Says he'll go away!

1048
01:20:23,138 --> 01:20:26,801
lf God lets us live for long,
we'll be together all our lives!

1049
01:20:29,978 --> 01:20:33,141
What are you both doing here?
Aunt is calling you!

1050
01:20:36,318 --> 01:20:37,979
Aunt is calling you!

1051
01:20:41,823 --> 01:20:44,485
Okay, come quickly!

1052
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:56,160
Okay, don't take to your heart, come.

1053
01:20:56,338 --> 01:20:58,169
You go.
- Please come.

1054
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,170
You go!

1055
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:00,330
That's the problem with you.

1056
01:21:00,509 --> 01:21:01,498
How can you be like this always?

1057
01:21:01,677 --> 01:21:04,009
We can have many fights?
Can we look cheap to others?

1058
01:21:04,179 --> 01:21:04,838
Please come.

1059
01:21:05,013 --> 01:21:09,006
l can't act like you, go!
Play your drama there!

1060
01:21:42,217 --> 01:21:45,084
Please arrange it.
You count the chairs.

1061
01:21:45,387 --> 01:21:46,081
That too!

1062
01:22:00,736 --> 01:22:06,732
l've paid to musicians.
Promised to settle Pandu by evening.

1063
01:22:11,913 --> 01:22:15,246
Where were you, Khader bhai?

1064
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:18,079
Your missing was promiscuous
in marriage.

1065
01:22:18,253 --> 01:22:20,244
There's no better friend to me
than you, brother.

1066
01:22:20,422 --> 01:22:21,753
l went on a visit to Mecca
without informing you.

1067
01:22:21,923 --> 01:22:22,753
l didn't even go to home,

1068
01:22:22,924 --> 01:22:26,416
because the home l go after
Mecca visit would be happy!

1069
01:22:26,595 --> 01:22:27,584
Very happy to hear that.

1070
01:22:27,763 --> 01:22:29,754
Where's sister-in-law?
- She's inside.

1071
01:22:29,931 --> 01:22:32,263
Are you fine?
- Have breakfast.

1072
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:36,768
Marriage went off well, right?
- Super, father.

1073
01:22:36,938 --> 01:22:38,269
No shortcomings, right?

1074
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,930
People are saying you did very well.

1075
01:22:40,609 --> 01:22:44,602
lt seems your sister's in-laws
have a custom,

1076
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,940
they've a vow to fulfill
in Chinna Tirupathi.

1077
01:22:46,114 --> 01:22:47,445
Your mother and l've to
attend a function,

1078
01:22:47,616 --> 01:22:49,106
you both go with them.

1079
01:22:49,618 --> 01:22:52,781
lf you both go, it would look good!

1080
01:22:52,954 --> 01:22:53,943
You'll go, right?

1081
01:22:54,122 --> 01:22:54,952
Where is he?

1082
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:57,122
He's inside.
- Should l tell him?

1083
01:22:57,292 --> 01:22:59,783
No need, l'll tell him.
- Okay, go.

1084
01:24:01,857 --> 01:24:03,188
We're very lucky!

1085
01:24:03,358 --> 01:24:05,189
We couldn't get this proposal
even if we had tried.

1086
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,850
l'm saying thanks on behalf
of everyone here.

1087
01:24:07,028 --> 01:24:10,020
l think this is also a character
bestowed to you by your father.

1088
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:13,361
How is it possible for your father
to say only good things?

1089
01:24:13,535 --> 01:24:16,527
Forget it, you both brothers were
the main attraction in the marriage.

1090
01:24:16,705 --> 01:24:18,195
Both managed it well.

1091
01:24:18,373 --> 01:24:20,204
Stay together like this always!
Like Rama and Lakshmana!

1092
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:22,206
Hubby!
- Coming!

1093
01:24:58,747 --> 01:25:03,741
Hello...

1094
01:25:05,587 --> 01:25:06,747
l can hear you, tell me.

1095
01:25:08,423 --> 01:25:11,290
You...
- l...?

1096
01:25:13,261 --> 01:25:14,250
You...

1097
01:25:17,766 --> 01:25:19,597
Why did you kick the flower pot?

1098
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:25,429
Why did you kick the flower pot?

1099
01:25:32,781 --> 01:25:33,440
Where are you?

1100
01:25:36,284 --> 01:25:38,275
Where are you?

1101
01:25:39,621 --> 01:25:40,781
Cut it, l'm coming!

1102
01:26:10,819 --> 01:26:13,811
Did you eat?
- No, l'm famished!

1103
01:26:14,656 --> 01:26:15,816
Go eat!

1104
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:37,672
Enough...
- Eat well, don't know what you eat there.

1105
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:39,336
l'm always worried.

1106
01:26:39,514 --> 01:26:41,004
Have little.
- Enough!

1107
01:26:41,182 --> 01:26:43,173
Eat well son, don't know
when would you come again?

1108
01:26:43,351 --> 01:26:45,012
Why are you eating ike that?

1109
01:26:46,021 --> 01:26:47,682
lf you're free, pack my bag.

1110
01:26:50,692 --> 01:26:52,683
Don't pack everything.
- Enough, mother!

1111
01:26:53,194 --> 01:26:56,857
He returned that day,
it's useless to carry luggage.

1112
01:27:00,368 --> 01:27:02,700
Find ajob at least this time,

1113
01:27:02,871 --> 01:27:04,361
how long can you carry on like this?

1114
01:27:09,878 --> 01:27:12,711
Please take elder one along with you.

1115
01:27:12,881 --> 01:27:14,371
What would he do here?

1116
01:27:14,883 --> 01:27:16,874
Other than picking up trouble!

1117
01:27:19,721 --> 01:27:24,385
lt seems a man in marriage
promised to find ajob for him.

1118
01:27:24,893 --> 01:27:26,383
You tell him and take him with you.

1119
01:27:33,568 --> 01:27:36,401
Seetha, elder one is here,
serve him food.

1120
01:27:39,574 --> 01:27:41,906
Have some more, son.
- Finished.

1121
01:27:42,577 --> 01:27:44,067
Have buttermilk!

1122
01:27:44,245 --> 01:27:48,579
You keep listening to empty talk,
getting late to the train.

1123
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:53,084
l'm not going, you carry on.
Don't l know what to do?

1124
01:27:56,424 --> 01:27:57,584
Look after him!

1125
01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:08,265
Four weeks doesn't mean four weeks.

1126
01:28:08,436 --> 01:28:10,768
One mustn't remember about weeks
and months in honeymoon.

1127
01:28:10,939 --> 01:28:12,270
Well said sister.

1128
01:28:14,943 --> 01:28:16,604
l feel strange when l hear
such dialogues.

1129
01:28:17,112 --> 01:28:20,104
lf he didn't have ajob, how long he
would have taken to flatter her?

1130
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:25,275
Come there, bro!
We can settle in one go!

1131
01:28:25,453 --> 01:28:26,784
Think about what mother said!

1132
01:28:26,955 --> 01:28:28,115
Okay, do you've money?
- l have.

1133
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:33,454
Do you? Keep it.
- l have.

1134
01:28:38,133 --> 01:28:39,122
Go!

1135
01:28:43,304 --> 01:28:45,795
lt's crowded! No place to sit also.

1136
01:28:45,974 --> 01:28:48,135
Call me after reaching there.
- Okay, l'll call.

1137
01:28:48,309 --> 01:28:50,470
Think over it again.
- What?

1138
01:28:50,645 --> 01:28:52,636
What mother said!
- l'll think.

1139
01:28:52,814 --> 01:28:54,509
Don't think, come!

1140
01:28:54,983 --> 01:28:57,144
Do you want me to come now?
- Now?

1141
01:28:57,318 --> 01:28:58,478
Want me to come?

1142
01:29:00,989 --> 01:29:02,479
You're great!

1143
01:29:03,324 --> 01:29:04,222
Come!

1144
01:29:10,832 --> 01:29:13,995
This is the worst find of the century!

1145
01:29:18,506 --> 01:29:21,669
Your brother is great,
always simple and no fuss.

1146
01:29:21,843 --> 01:29:23,674
Personality too is quite strong!

1147
01:29:23,845 --> 01:29:27,178
What does he lack? Lost a shade
working hard for marriage.

1148
01:29:27,348 --> 01:29:28,679
Hyderabad would bring back...

1149
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:31,842
Always worried about
growing thin, complexion!

1150
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:34,352
Forget about all this,
half of country's problems will be solved.

1151
01:29:37,859 --> 01:29:38,689
Move!

1152
01:29:42,197 --> 01:29:46,031
He always calls me dark,
watch, l'll fix him now.

1153
01:29:46,701 --> 01:29:48,032
Younger one, give me a cigarette.

1154
01:29:51,206 --> 01:29:53,367
Give me, l'm asking you.
l'm nervous!

1155
01:29:56,711 --> 01:30:01,375
ln Vijayawada we break cigarette
into two, throw it and say catch it!

1156
01:30:04,052 --> 01:30:05,542
Why so many dramas to make a living?

1157
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,553
Nobody is happy or nobody is free!

1158
01:30:12,894 --> 01:30:13,724
Younger one!

1159
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:16,219
Younger one!

1160
01:30:17,398 --> 01:30:18,592
No signal!

1161
01:30:19,734 --> 01:30:20,962
Younger one!

1162
01:30:24,405 --> 01:30:28,239
What happened dear?
Why are you tensed?

1163
01:30:30,245 --> 01:30:33,078
Necklace road is very nice.

1164
01:30:33,581 --> 01:30:34,912
lt inquired about you,

1165
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:37,745
it asked me to come again today also.
Will you please come?

1166
01:30:39,254 --> 01:30:42,246
Are you in Hyderabad?
- Found that now?

1167
01:30:42,423 --> 01:30:46,587
l'm angry with sullen face!
l'm hurt!

1168
01:30:50,098 --> 01:30:53,090
When l said l'm coming to Hyderabad,
you cut my call.

1169
01:30:53,268 --> 01:30:54,428
Cut it, l'll call you later.

1170
01:31:00,608 --> 01:31:01,438
Who is it?

1171
01:31:01,609 --> 01:31:04,100
Relatives...l've relatives
all over the place!

1172
01:31:07,782 --> 01:31:10,273
Eat everything yourself,
don't give him anything.

1173
01:31:10,618 --> 01:31:11,949
He's doing too much!

1174
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,953
What brings you to Hyderabad suddenly?

1175
01:31:15,123 --> 01:31:17,956
Sister is coming from America,
came to receive her.

1176
01:31:18,126 --> 01:31:19,616
Entire family is here.

1177
01:31:19,794 --> 01:31:22,024
Didn't tell about my brother-in-law, did l?

1178
01:31:22,964 --> 01:31:24,295
You saw him in marriage, right?

1179
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:28,292
He's cute, right?
- Can he do somersaults?

1180
01:31:28,469 --> 01:31:32,132
lf l praise any other man,
you become very tall!

1181
01:31:32,307 --> 01:31:33,638
Look, how red your nose has turned!

1182
01:31:33,808 --> 01:31:36,641
Basically boys are very good!

1183
01:31:37,312 --> 01:31:39,473
Air...magic of air!

1184
01:31:40,148 --> 01:31:41,979
One must use the given freedom.

1185
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:44,983
One must know what to give
and what to take!

1186
01:31:45,486 --> 01:31:47,147
Just a minute!

1187
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:57,655
Devadas, Majnu and Romeo
their love stories created history.

1188
01:31:57,832 --> 01:31:59,322
The left after creating a trend.

1189
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:01,491
Different from all of them!

1190
01:32:01,669 --> 01:32:03,830
ls it so lucky to be born as a girl?

1191
01:32:04,005 --> 01:32:05,666
Would it be so good to
be born as a girl?

1192
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,398
l'll definitely make you feel that!

1193
01:32:07,842 --> 01:32:10,834
Hugs and kisses are bonuses.

1194
01:32:11,012 --> 01:32:15,176
Come, hug me!
Hug me!

1195
01:32:17,852 --> 01:32:18,841
Don't worry about people watching us.

1196
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,351
You carry on!

1197
01:32:22,857 --> 01:32:23,687
What next?

1198
01:32:23,858 --> 01:32:26,691
Tell me.
- You tell me.

1199
01:32:27,195 --> 01:32:28,025
Then?

1200
01:32:29,697 --> 01:32:30,186
Tell me.

1201
01:32:30,531 --> 01:32:33,022
Don't ask now, l'm sure to tell only lies.

1202
01:32:37,705 --> 01:32:45,544
O boy! A girl is waiting for you,
find her...

1203
01:32:47,215 --> 01:32:55,714
l've come searching you
among so many...

1204
01:32:56,391 --> 01:33:05,891
You were searching and l was waiting to
be found and become your partner...

1205
01:33:06,067 --> 01:33:15,408
l've much to tell...so much to tell...
you tell me now...tell me...

1206
01:33:47,942 --> 01:33:52,777
Why do they say l was born for you?

1207
01:33:52,947 --> 01:33:57,281
Should l've to wait for
20 long years to meet you?

1208
01:33:57,452 --> 01:34:07,293
What do we give to make
you love us so much?

1209
01:34:07,462 --> 01:34:12,126
Years have to pass to
become like this...

1210
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,962
Don't get so tensed,
we would like you anyway...

1211
01:34:15,136 --> 01:34:17,798
l can realise it...

1212
01:34:59,347 --> 01:35:03,841
How happy you're when we
ask you to go away...

1213
01:35:04,018 --> 01:35:08,512
When you walk away,
we follow you like your shadow...

1214
01:35:08,689 --> 01:35:13,353
You go blank when we
come before you...that's true...

1215
01:35:13,528 --> 01:35:18,522
There's no reason to get angry...

1216
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:23,363
Boys are a mix of good
and stubbornness...

1217
01:35:23,538 --> 01:35:28,908
You've come down for us...
- Don't say like that...

1218
01:36:08,249 --> 01:36:11,912
Don't worry, l'm coming.
- Move please.

1219
01:36:16,591 --> 01:36:18,252
That's it, check, brother-in-law.

1220
01:36:18,426 --> 01:36:19,085
lt went down, brother-in-law.

1221
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,751
lt will raise again by 3 pm,
l'm in this field for 30 years.

1222
01:36:21,929 --> 01:36:23,590
Do it.
- Doing it sir.

1223
01:36:24,765 --> 01:36:25,254
What?

1224
01:36:25,433 --> 01:36:26,593
Someone from your place is here for you.

1225
01:36:26,767 --> 01:36:27,927
lt seems you promised to
find ajob for him.

1226
01:36:28,102 --> 01:36:29,262
ls he here?

1227
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:31,769
l know him very well,
tell him to wait for 2 minutes, l'll come.

1228
01:36:31,939 --> 01:36:33,270
Go for that.

1229
01:36:34,942 --> 01:36:36,603
Sir told you to wait for 10 minutes.
- Okay.

1230
01:37:03,137 --> 01:37:04,297
Open Ranbaxy.

1231
01:37:04,972 --> 01:37:07,304
Sir, he's waiting for an hour now.

1232
01:37:07,475 --> 01:37:08,464
Can l call him in?

1233
01:37:08,643 --> 01:37:13,137
l know him very well,
please tell him to wait.

1234
01:37:13,314 --> 01:37:14,975
Open both!

1235
01:37:30,498 --> 01:37:32,489
What's the time now?
- 2 pm!

1236
01:37:33,167 --> 01:37:38,332
When l was eating my favourite dish,
l remembered elder one.

1237
01:37:39,006 --> 01:37:40,837
Don't know what is he doing?

1238
01:37:42,510 --> 01:37:45,343
He'll eat on time wherever he may be.

1239
01:37:45,513 --> 01:37:48,175
lf not he'll get angry instantly.

1240
01:37:50,685 --> 01:37:52,676
Stopped eating rice to
stop the growing girth.

1241
01:37:52,853 --> 01:37:55,014
Why eat this?
That will end all your trouble.

1242
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:58,682
Have you done it?
Be on job. Open Ranbaxy.

1243
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:10,700
You're great, brother-in-law.

1244
01:38:10,871 --> 01:38:13,203
Sir, he's waiting since morning.
lt's 5 pm now.

1245
01:38:13,374 --> 01:38:19,870
Great! l know him very well,
tell him to wait, go.

1246
01:38:24,885 --> 01:38:27,718
Who is the man who promised
to find ajob for me?

1247
01:38:27,888 --> 01:38:30,220
Who is he?
lsn't it you?

1248
01:38:30,391 --> 01:38:32,222
Why do make empty promises
back in your native lace?

1249
01:38:32,393 --> 01:38:33,553
Can't you be happy with yourself?

1250
01:38:33,728 --> 01:38:35,218
Did l ask your help?

1251
01:38:35,396 --> 01:38:38,729
Friends, bloody friends!
First learn to see humans as humans.

1252
01:39:05,259 --> 01:39:07,420
Life is very strange!

1253
01:39:07,595 --> 01:39:09,586
We'll go as far as it throws us!

1254
01:39:10,264 --> 01:39:13,097
Didn't get the job!
Don't have hope of getting one.

1255
01:39:13,601 --> 01:39:15,762
Looking at the crowd and noise...

1256
01:39:16,604 --> 01:39:17,935
lt isn't like our place.

1257
01:39:18,439 --> 01:39:21,772
l feel like going home.
- lf not this try another.

1258
01:39:21,942 --> 01:39:27,938
Try another? Looking at those
men makes me furious.

1259
01:39:28,783 --> 01:39:30,444
l don't get it.

1260
01:39:31,285 --> 01:39:34,777
Not seen outside
but inside is eating me away.

1261
01:39:48,636 --> 01:39:53,801
As kids you went to school,
l followed you.

1262
01:39:53,974 --> 01:39:56,135
You didn't go to school till
l came with you.

1263
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:57,641
l went with you.

1264
01:39:58,979 --> 01:40:04,474
After few years, Alivelu, Srivadh,
Dhanalakshmi,- Krishnakumari!

1265
01:40:04,652 --> 01:40:07,314
That's it, l was afraid you
would tell our parents.

1266
01:40:07,488 --> 01:40:09,319
l used to make my own plans.

1267
01:40:09,490 --> 01:40:12,323
Narendra theatre...Padmasri theatre!

1268
01:40:12,493 --> 01:40:16,486
Cinema, mother, father,
how many feelings!

1269
01:40:16,664 --> 01:40:18,495
Why did you remember all that now?

1270
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:20,327
You said you didn't get it.

1271
01:40:20,501 --> 01:40:23,334
lsn't this enough?
We've to see a lot in future.

1272
01:40:23,504 --> 01:40:28,669
We both would get married,
they would fight for little things,

1273
01:40:29,343 --> 01:40:30,503
few children would come up,

1274
01:40:30,678 --> 01:40:33,511
mummy, daddy, homework
and so many things,

1275
01:40:33,681 --> 01:40:36,172
we must be just like as we are now!
Remember that!

1276
01:40:37,017 --> 01:40:39,679
You're ready to cook up tales!

1277
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:45,352
Are you fine, son?

1278
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,520
Where's the elder one?

1279
01:40:49,196 --> 01:40:50,686
What happened to his job?

1280
01:40:51,365 --> 01:40:52,354
Ask him yourself.

1281
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,861
Who?
- Mother, talk to her.

1282
01:40:55,035 --> 01:40:57,196
You talk to her.
- Just a sec, he'll talk to you.

1283
01:40:59,206 --> 01:41:00,696
Trapped me!

1284
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:06,373
Did you eat, son?

1285
01:41:07,715 --> 01:41:09,376
Eat on time, son.

1286
01:41:11,218 --> 01:41:14,710
You love the sweets l make,
shall l send it?

1287
01:41:16,891 --> 01:41:18,882
He'll never change.
- What did you say now?

1288
01:41:29,069 --> 01:41:30,229
lt seems they've a swimming pool too,

1289
01:41:30,404 --> 01:41:31,735
if we get ajob here,
we can work sleeping.

1290
01:41:31,906 --> 01:41:33,737
Work sleeping? You fool!

1291
01:41:37,077 --> 01:41:39,910
Who is she with pillars under the feet?

1292
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:43,075
Buddy!

1293
01:41:49,256 --> 01:41:50,746
You don't eat cool food, right?

1294
01:41:53,594 --> 01:41:56,427
Your face is a face to
watch again and again.

1295
01:41:56,597 --> 01:41:57,586
Mine!

1296
01:41:59,767 --> 01:42:01,257
Couldn't even wait for a year?

1297
01:42:01,435 --> 01:42:03,266
ls he doing job or selling goggles?

1298
01:42:03,437 --> 01:42:05,928
You asked where would l keep
if you give a flower?

1299
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:09,932
He's allergic to flowers.
l found such a man.

1300
01:42:12,947 --> 01:42:14,938
Go and eat before it cools down.

1301
01:42:16,951 --> 01:42:20,443
Girls l chased or girls who chased me,

1302
01:42:20,621 --> 01:42:23,112
when they get caught with such guys,

1303
01:42:23,624 --> 01:42:26,115
it's ajig inside! Folk dance!

1304
01:42:26,293 --> 01:42:27,783
Come in, call for us.

1305
01:42:32,633 --> 01:42:34,624
Did you hear this?

1306
01:42:34,802 --> 01:42:38,966
Raghava Rao's daughter-in-law has brought
even brush from her parents' home.

1307
01:42:39,139 --> 01:42:41,300
She's not letting husband
also to touch it.

1308
01:42:41,475 --> 01:42:42,464
There are such people too.

1309
01:42:42,643 --> 01:42:45,635
Shut up! Always carrying messages.

1310
01:42:45,813 --> 01:42:48,304
You bring all messages,
don't you've any work?

1311
01:42:48,482 --> 01:42:49,972
Be careful with her.

1312
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:52,482
Keep quiet madam,
just messages of good and bad.

1313
01:42:52,653 --> 01:42:55,315
Add some more ghee, it'll be tasty.

1314
01:42:55,489 --> 01:42:58,652
You wait, show all your hurry
in elder one's marriage.

1315
01:42:59,159 --> 01:43:02,492
Aunt, tell me a thing.
lf l marry your elder son,

1316
01:43:02,663 --> 01:43:04,995
would you be mother,
as you raised me like a mother,

1317
01:43:05,165 --> 01:43:07,998
or would you become
a mother-in-law to me suddenly?

1318
01:43:08,168 --> 01:43:09,328
Will you ask anything you feel?

1319
01:43:09,503 --> 01:43:10,834
Won't you keep anything inside?

1320
01:43:11,005 --> 01:43:12,336
lf l hide things l'll put on weight.

1321
01:43:19,013 --> 01:43:20,844
Great service!

1322
01:43:21,849 --> 01:43:25,683
Not much eating
but long waiting.

1323
01:43:27,021 --> 01:43:29,512
He'll build another hotel
with our bill.

1324
01:43:30,524 --> 01:43:33,186
So, eat without any compromise.

1325
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,691
Hasn't the water cooled yet?

1326
01:43:34,862 --> 01:43:37,023
Why are you talking like villagers?
Change the slang.

1327
01:43:37,197 --> 01:43:40,360
Aren't we?

1328
01:43:43,537 --> 01:43:45,198
Come her girls!
What are you doing there?

1329
01:43:45,372 --> 01:43:46,361
Coming!

1330
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:49,369
Why didn't you tell me till now?

1331
01:43:50,044 --> 01:43:52,535
l thought of telling after
l'm clear about it.

1332
01:43:53,047 --> 01:43:55,709
Now l'm clear and
l find it very nice.

1333
01:43:55,883 --> 01:43:58,875
He's Relangi uncle's son,
so he's handsome.

1334
01:43:59,053 --> 01:44:01,385
But how are you going to manage it?

1335
01:44:01,555 --> 01:44:04,217
Do one thing,
call me, l'll do the talking.

1336
01:44:05,559 --> 01:44:08,722
l've already called him.
- ls it? When?

1337
01:44:08,896 --> 01:44:10,056
Right now!

1338
01:44:11,732 --> 01:44:13,063
Didn't tell him all are here.

1339
01:44:13,233 --> 01:44:17,226
To become number one son-in-law
he must get the shock, right?

1340
01:44:22,076 --> 01:44:25,568
lf my brother asks,
don't tell him anything.

1341
01:44:25,746 --> 01:44:28,078
What will he ask?
What he doesn't want to tell?

1342
01:44:28,248 --> 01:44:29,909
Hyderabad is confusing!

1343
01:44:33,754 --> 01:44:34,743
Once please!

1344
01:44:37,091 --> 01:44:38,922
Once more please!
- Once more later, come here.

1345
01:44:39,093 --> 01:44:40,253
Where's your sister?

1346
01:44:40,427 --> 01:44:42,759
Show me.

1347
01:44:47,768 --> 01:44:51,101
Entire gang is here!
Fixed me perfectly.

1348
01:44:53,273 --> 01:44:55,104
Look who is here!

1349
01:44:55,275 --> 01:44:57,175
Where did you see him?
- Hey younger one!

1350
01:45:00,948 --> 01:45:03,610
Are you parents doing fine?
Come!

1351
01:45:03,784 --> 01:45:05,115
Entire family is here, come.

1352
01:45:05,619 --> 01:45:06,608
Sister!

1353
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:14,449
Come.

1354
01:45:17,297 --> 01:45:19,788
He's my nephew,
Relangi brother's son.

1355
01:45:19,967 --> 01:45:21,798
ls it? l saw you as a kid.

1356
01:45:21,969 --> 01:45:23,459
You've dropped in suddenly.

1357
01:45:23,637 --> 01:45:25,969
Not suddenly, sister invited him.

1358
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,139
She invited him, right?

1359
01:45:37,151 --> 01:45:39,312
You get up, you sit there.

1360
01:45:40,821 --> 01:45:42,311
Please sit here.
- Sit

1361
01:46:01,675 --> 01:46:02,664
Eat!

1362
01:46:11,852 --> 01:46:13,183
Stop smiling please!

1363
01:46:23,197 --> 01:46:26,360
What are you doing?

1364
01:46:28,202 --> 01:46:30,033
Are you doing something or unemployed?

1365
01:46:36,043 --> 01:46:42,710
Look, a planning, great care and a vision!

1366
01:46:43,383 --> 01:46:44,714
Look at them!

1367
01:46:48,222 --> 01:46:52,716
Going to office at 9 am and
coming back home at 5 pm,

1368
01:46:52,893 --> 01:46:54,724
applying powder all over the neck,

1369
01:46:54,895 --> 01:46:58,558
unable to decide which
channel to watch on TV,

1370
01:46:58,732 --> 01:47:00,563
if wife is cooking in kitchen,

1371
01:47:00,734 --> 01:47:03,225
going astray looking here
and there, l hate that life.

1372
01:47:03,403 --> 01:47:07,897
Do you all in your home talk like this?

1373
01:47:08,075 --> 01:47:10,236
l think nobody talks straight.

1374
01:47:12,746 --> 01:47:16,739
l found all the rules of
making money in this world,

1375
01:47:16,917 --> 01:47:20,580
l still can't understand you
or your principles.

1376
01:47:20,754 --> 01:47:23,587
lf there's any peeve in my life,
this is it.

1377
01:47:27,094 --> 01:47:28,083
Behaviour!

1378
01:47:29,763 --> 01:47:30,923
His brother!

1379
01:47:31,765 --> 01:47:34,427
You would've seen in marriage,
he created a big scene.

1380
01:47:34,601 --> 01:47:37,934
Just for a glass of water.
A big fuss!

1381
01:47:38,105 --> 01:47:39,766
Please take him to a doctor.

1382
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:43,103
Please don't leave him.
Advice him!

1383
01:47:43,277 --> 01:47:44,608
Why did you leave him?

1384
01:47:44,778 --> 01:47:47,110
lf l knew you were responsible
for his mood off that day,

1385
01:47:47,281 --> 01:47:48,612
l don't know what would've
had happened.

1386
01:47:48,782 --> 01:47:51,444
Would l keep quiet till it happens?

1387
01:47:51,618 --> 01:47:54,951
All l ask is to change your attitude,
if you say we'll not,

1388
01:47:55,122 --> 01:47:56,783
who is the loser?

1389
01:47:56,957 --> 01:47:59,118
My father too didn't advice us
to live like this or like that.

1390
01:47:59,293 --> 01:48:01,454
Why would l hear advice
from a foolish stranger?

1391
01:48:01,962 --> 01:48:04,453
Though smart l'll never listen
to over smart guys like you.

1392
01:48:05,799 --> 01:48:08,791
Look, l'll come down
till you come down.

1393
01:48:08,969 --> 01:48:09,663
Remember that!

1394
01:48:09,970 --> 01:48:11,631
Never again overstep into
my family matters.

1395
01:48:12,139 --> 01:48:14,801
l'll bash you black and blue!

1396
01:48:31,158 --> 01:48:33,149
l expected so much,
why did you ruin it?

1397
01:48:33,327 --> 01:48:35,989
l planned so much to highlight
you before my dad.

1398
01:48:36,163 --> 01:48:37,653
To hell with your father,

1399
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:39,992
do you want to highlight me
before him?

1400
01:48:41,835 --> 01:48:43,666
You don't appear but very angry man!

1401
01:48:43,837 --> 01:48:45,998
But you're handsome even while angry.

1402
01:48:47,174 --> 01:48:49,506
Had you worn more colourful shirt,
you'd be rocking.

1403
01:48:49,676 --> 01:48:52,008
You too see only outside things
like your dad not anything inside.

1404
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:54,340
What did he teach you?

1405
01:48:55,515 --> 01:48:57,847
Do fathers teach everything?
We've our own sources.

1406
01:48:58,018 --> 01:48:59,178
Why are you shouting?

1407
01:48:59,353 --> 01:49:02,345
Do fathers teach everything?
- Shut up...

1408
01:49:04,191 --> 01:49:05,180
What?

1409
01:49:06,693 --> 01:49:08,854
One slap and all your teeth
would roll out.

1410
01:49:09,196 --> 01:49:10,527
l'm hurt.

1411
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:14,190
l'm feeling bad with sullen face.

1412
01:49:15,202 --> 01:49:16,032
Look at me!

1413
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:19,533
Look at her play act!

1414
01:49:20,707 --> 01:49:23,198
No doubt, your dad has spoilt you.

1415
01:49:23,377 --> 01:49:26,369
Why a dad before and after every word?

1416
01:49:27,547 --> 01:49:30,880
Talk as usually you do, funnily!

1417
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:34,885
You don't worry about people's condition,
you must be given what you ask.

1418
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:38,881
l'll jump!
- Jump, good riddance!

1419
01:49:39,059 --> 01:49:41,220
l'll jump from here.

1420
01:49:42,562 --> 01:49:43,722
l'm jumping down!

1421
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:33,272
This isn't love at all,
nobody can say this is love.

1422
01:50:33,447 --> 01:50:38,441
Love means lot of sweet talk,
pet names, talk over phone,

1423
01:50:43,957 --> 01:50:45,788
she's another big trouble
along with him.

1424
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:59,462
Why did you call me now?
- What's the time now?

1425
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:01,800
11 pm!
- So what?

1426
01:51:01,975 --> 01:51:04,637
Night...dark...l'm afraid
of darkness, cut it.

1427
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:09,145
One second, l didn't call,
my phone insisted on calling.

1428
01:51:09,316 --> 01:51:12,843
The situation l'm in and
she's talking funny!

1429
01:51:15,989 --> 01:51:16,819
Where is he?

1430
01:51:19,659 --> 01:51:21,217
Where is Geetha?

1431
01:51:23,663 --> 01:51:25,824
Where are you?
l'm waiting here for you.

1432
01:51:25,999 --> 01:51:27,489
Come, l'm on terrace.

1433
01:51:27,667 --> 01:51:30,158
l'm leaving.
- Where?

1434
01:51:30,337 --> 01:51:32,498
Going back to home.
- Why?

1435
01:51:34,674 --> 01:51:36,005
Please listen...

1436
01:51:50,857 --> 01:51:54,850
Everyone is happy as they want
to be except me!

1437
01:51:55,028 --> 01:51:58,862
Can't he ask?
Won't l answer him? With a long face...

1438
01:51:59,032 --> 01:52:01,865
just one such man
is enough to understand life.

1439
01:52:04,871 --> 01:52:06,031
l'll lose Rs.7000!

1440
01:52:10,377 --> 01:52:12,208
Elder on has come back,

1441
01:52:12,379 --> 01:52:14,210
don't know what has happened there?
Did you ask him?

1442
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:17,373
Why? Didn't the younger one call?

1443
01:52:17,551 --> 01:52:22,215
When l ask about elder one you say
ask younger one or vice versa.

1444
01:52:22,389 --> 01:52:24,550
They'll take care of each
other themselves.

1445
01:52:24,724 --> 01:52:26,214
l too wish it,

1446
01:52:26,393 --> 01:52:29,885
by God's grace Chinni's
marriage went off peacefully.

1447
01:52:30,063 --> 01:52:34,056
Bezawada brings to my memory...

1448
01:52:34,234 --> 01:52:37,226
l'm thinking of going to their home.

1449
01:52:37,404 --> 01:52:39,565
lt seems elder daughter has
come from America.

1450
01:52:39,739 --> 01:52:42,572
Can we ever forget the favour
she did to us?

1451
01:52:42,742 --> 01:52:49,910
l'll go and tell we wish to hear
good news in near future.

1452
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:53,746
Prepare sweets.
l'll take them with me.

1453
01:52:58,091 --> 01:52:59,922
Looks like it may rain,
get the clothes, Seetha.

1454
01:53:00,093 --> 01:53:01,583
l'll get it.

1455
01:53:32,626 --> 01:53:33,957
What's this?

1456
01:53:34,127 --> 01:53:35,116
Somebody is taking photos
from up there!

1457
01:53:35,295 --> 01:53:36,956
l'm getting ready to give pose.

1458
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:38,620
Bloody photos.

1459
01:53:38,798 --> 01:53:40,993
Wait, let's take a snap together.

1460
01:53:42,302 --> 01:53:43,633
Look there!
- What?

1461
01:53:43,803 --> 01:53:45,293
Look there!
- What?

1462
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:46,962
Just see once!

1463
01:53:50,644 --> 01:53:51,804
Look there!

1464
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:06,656
How can l stop myself if
rain drops wet me like this?

1465
01:54:06,826 --> 01:54:12,492
How can my youth resist
the lashes of rain?

1466
01:54:12,666 --> 01:54:18,662
Hold on dear, why are you rushing?
Am l so cheap to you?

1467
01:54:18,838 --> 01:54:25,676
l'm here to take to
the world of bliss...

1468
01:54:49,035 --> 01:54:55,031
l got wet because of you...
l danced in rain because of you...

1469
01:54:55,208 --> 01:55:01,704
You know why? You would
allow me to come closer...

1470
01:55:01,881 --> 01:55:05,044
l've made my sari end
as your umbrella...

1471
01:55:05,218 --> 01:55:08,210
l'm warming you with my breath...

1472
01:55:08,388 --> 01:55:14,884
l would give certainly
whatever l've to you...

1473
01:56:02,942 --> 01:56:08,938
l shone with shyness...
l called you with my heart beat...

1474
01:56:09,115 --> 01:56:15,452
Rained like kisses on you...
Become a rainbow on your horizon...

1475
01:56:15,622 --> 01:56:22,118
Your first call of youth is
making my heart to sprout love...

1476
01:56:22,295 --> 01:56:28,791
When you pour down on me,
there's no end to the happiness...

1477
01:57:12,345 --> 01:57:14,006
Very good proposal.

1478
01:57:14,848 --> 01:57:17,009
Groom is very handsome.

1479
01:57:17,183 --> 01:57:22,519
They know everything so wouldn't
mind such trivial things.

1480
01:57:22,856 --> 01:57:24,346
lt's not an ordinary proposal,

1481
01:57:24,524 --> 01:57:27,516
to whom l'm telling this,
who should get this message directly,

1482
01:57:27,694 --> 01:57:28,683
the message must reach them,

1483
01:57:28,862 --> 01:57:31,353
and stop breaking into mad jigs,

1484
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:35,365
the faster they get out from
those thoughts the better for all of us.

1485
01:57:36,035 --> 01:57:37,696
Wait!

1486
01:57:38,037 --> 01:57:39,026
Where are you going?

1487
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:44,374
lf you see a boy,
you must judge his capacity.

1488
01:57:44,544 --> 01:57:47,877
lf not why to study so much
and have health drinks.

1489
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:54,384
Say anything or get any great proposal,

1490
01:57:54,721 --> 01:57:58,384
l'll not agree for the marriage till
you fix Seetha's marriage first.

1491
01:58:00,393 --> 01:58:04,557
Just one girl!
Never took care of her!

1492
01:58:04,731 --> 01:58:08,895
You must arrange her marriage,
if not consider me as dead.

1493
01:58:09,068 --> 01:58:13,402
Calm down, brother will talk,
don't get tensed, mother.

1494
01:58:13,573 --> 01:58:17,407
What will he talk?
You keep talking all the life.

1495
01:58:17,577 --> 01:58:19,636
Did you ever let me talk?

1496
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:24,414
l love him more than you two!

1497
01:58:25,752 --> 01:58:29,916
He's dead anyway!
Did you ever bother about him?

1498
01:58:30,089 --> 01:58:32,580
All are here,
did they bother about her?

1499
01:58:32,759 --> 01:58:34,750
Tell me, did they bother about her?

1500
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:38,590
Hello brother-in-law!

1501
01:58:40,767 --> 01:58:43,429
Brother!
- Are you all doing fine?

1502
01:58:43,603 --> 01:58:47,266
Your aunt made these sweets for you.

1503
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:52,776
She wished you to have
children like her sweets.

1504
01:58:52,946 --> 01:58:54,277
Are you fine, dear?
- Fine.

1505
01:58:54,447 --> 01:58:57,280
ls everyone fine?
- l forgot about you.

1506
01:58:57,450 --> 01:58:58,610
Are you fine? ls your health fine?

1507
01:58:58,785 --> 01:59:00,616
How are you dear?
- Please sit down, brother.

1508
01:59:00,787 --> 01:59:02,618
Are you fine, dear?
- Fine, brother.

1509
01:59:03,623 --> 01:59:07,457
l'm very happy to see you
all at one place!

1510
01:59:08,294 --> 01:59:09,955
When did you come, Kondal Rao?

1511
01:59:10,129 --> 01:59:13,462
You're very lucky,
you said and he's here.

1512
01:59:13,633 --> 01:59:15,464
Nothing brother, they were talking
about Seetha's marriage.

1513
01:59:15,635 --> 01:59:17,626
Younger daughter's got a good proposal,

1514
01:59:17,971 --> 01:59:22,465
old woman wants Seetha to be married
first and you walked in, brother.

1515
01:59:25,645 --> 01:59:29,979
We've the responsibility of
Seetha as much as you have.

1516
01:59:30,149 --> 01:59:33,983
Moreover it's marriage.
We must think over it deeply.

1517
01:59:34,988 --> 01:59:38,480
You may have ideas of fixing her
marriage with your elder son.

1518
01:59:38,658 --> 01:59:40,319
What do you say that...

1519
01:59:40,827 --> 01:59:42,488
Unqualified!

1520
01:59:42,829 --> 01:59:47,823
You too don't wish to marry her off
to an unemployed man, right?

1521
01:59:48,001 --> 01:59:50,834
You too would bother about
what people will say!

1522
01:59:51,337 --> 01:59:52,827
Look at Kondal Rao!

1523
01:59:53,506 --> 01:59:56,339
lf we fix Seetha's marriage
with his son.

1524
01:59:56,509 --> 01:59:58,739
Would he jump in joy?

1525
02:00:00,013 --> 02:00:01,844
He would say immediately,
for idiotic son?

1526
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:08,753
l'll fix Seetha's marriage
finding a good proposal.

1527
02:00:09,856 --> 02:00:12,689
Anyone would think of
only good for Seetha.

1528
02:00:12,859 --> 02:00:15,851
You don't get any other thought.
Because she's Seetha!

1529
02:00:16,863 --> 02:00:17,852
Good!

1530
02:00:22,702 --> 02:00:24,693
How's the sari, aunt?

1531
02:00:25,705 --> 02:00:27,536
Why are you asking me?
- Why?

1532
02:00:28,374 --> 02:00:30,035
Are you going to stay with us?

1533
02:00:30,209 --> 02:00:32,200
We clamour as our relatives...

1534
02:00:32,378 --> 02:00:36,872
Look how she has turned up
for bride seeing ceremony.

1535
02:00:37,050 --> 02:00:39,712
Uncle asked me and
l'm doing it, that's all.

1536
02:00:39,886 --> 02:00:41,046
Your uncle will say!

1537
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:47,125
He went to see them and
brought a marriage proposal.

1538
02:00:47,393 --> 02:00:48,553
Uncle!

1539
02:00:48,728 --> 02:00:51,891
No use in discussing now
if my elder son had been normal?

1540
02:01:04,744 --> 02:01:08,737
Don't know in which situation uncle
had to promise them.

1541
02:01:10,416 --> 02:01:12,577
Shouldn't we honour uncle's word?

1542
02:01:16,255 --> 02:01:18,746
We're open family.

1543
02:01:18,925 --> 02:01:20,916
We openly discuss everything openly.

1544
02:01:21,094 --> 02:01:24,928
But my son is little old type for girls,

1545
02:01:25,098 --> 02:01:26,429
he doesn't like them to run
or talk loudly!

1546
02:01:26,599 --> 02:01:29,090
What are you saying daddy?
l'm more open than you.

1547
02:01:29,268 --> 02:01:30,929
lnfact you put so many
restrictions to mom.

1548
02:01:31,104 --> 02:01:33,937
lsn't mom? Tell him.
- No, l'm totally open.

1549
02:01:34,107 --> 02:01:36,098
Vijayawada man has sent a great proposal.

1550
02:01:36,275 --> 02:01:39,767
We praise ourselves too much,
they're worse than us.

1551
02:01:39,946 --> 02:01:42,608
What are you waiting for?
Call Seetha.

1552
02:01:44,117 --> 02:01:45,948
Seetha, come.

1553
02:02:41,174 --> 02:02:43,506
Who is he?

1554
02:02:44,177 --> 02:02:46,509
His elder son, Seetha's loves him.

1555
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:48,840
lf you refuse he'll marry her.

1556
02:02:49,015 --> 02:02:51,848
You're open type
so l told you everything openly.

1557
02:02:54,353 --> 02:02:56,184
Mother, fix it quickly.

1558
02:02:58,024 --> 02:03:00,015
lt's okay from our side.

1559
02:03:00,193 --> 02:03:02,024
No need of formalities
like engagement.

1560
02:03:02,195 --> 02:03:05,528
Get two upper cloths,
cover me and my son with it.

1561
02:03:05,698 --> 02:03:08,861
We can fix the marriage in a week.

1562
02:03:11,871 --> 02:03:13,361
He mustn't call me!...

1563
02:03:15,041 --> 02:03:17,874
He mustn't call me!

1564
02:03:19,712 --> 02:03:22,545
He mustn't call me!

1565
02:03:45,571 --> 02:03:47,061
What's that?

1566
02:03:49,909 --> 02:03:50,739
Give it.

1567
02:04:12,765 --> 02:04:13,595
What?

1568
02:04:13,933 --> 02:04:15,764
lt seems he's very handsome!

1569
02:04:16,936 --> 02:04:18,597
lt seems he'll take good care of me.

1570
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:23,265
Look, if he has one quality
better than me, marry him.

1571
02:04:23,442 --> 02:04:25,933
Not just the fool your father shows,
let it be anyone.

1572
02:04:26,112 --> 02:04:27,602
Marry him! Cut it!

1573
02:04:42,128 --> 02:04:43,618
l too would find a girl.

1574
02:04:45,131 --> 02:04:46,621
With a cheek which would turn pink
for 30 days forjust one kiss.

1575
02:04:46,799 --> 02:04:47,663
Cut it.

1576
02:05:05,484 --> 02:05:06,644
My foot!

1577
02:05:09,822 --> 02:05:12,814
l thought the world is so beautiful
because of boys and girls.

1578
02:05:12,992 --> 02:05:13,981
My foot!

1579
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:17,323
lt's difficult for a girl to
be as she wants in every situation.

1580
02:05:17,997 --> 02:05:21,489
They ,make big build up of reforming us
and our mistakes all through our life!

1581
02:05:21,667 --> 02:05:23,658
Must be brave,
must have sense of humour!

1582
02:05:23,836 --> 02:05:24,996
l'll like only if you've
those qualities.

1583
02:05:25,171 --> 02:05:26,001
lt's humbug!

1584
02:05:26,172 --> 02:05:27,332
Do you know when they need bravery?

1585
02:05:27,506 --> 02:05:29,497
To take them on bike without
meeting an accident.

1586
02:05:31,344 --> 02:05:33,505
What's that nasty look, you fool?

1587
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,701
Hey boy!

1588
02:06:41,747 --> 02:06:42,736
How is he, mother?

1589
02:06:45,251 --> 02:06:47,742
Keep checking his BP regularly.

1590
02:06:51,424 --> 02:06:53,915
You did a good thing by
bringing him here on time.

1591
02:06:54,093 --> 02:06:54,752
Nothing will happen to him.

1592
02:06:54,927 --> 02:06:57,919
l told you nothing will
happen to him. He'll be fine.

1593
02:06:58,097 --> 02:06:58,927
He'll be fine!

1594
02:06:59,098 --> 02:07:04,263
lf he's not fine, since you all
wish him good, he'll be fine!

1595
02:07:04,937 --> 02:07:05,596
Greetings!

1596
02:08:30,523 --> 02:08:34,687
Hey younger one!
Which ward your father is in?

1597
02:08:35,194 --> 02:08:36,024
Come!

1598
02:08:36,862 --> 02:08:39,695
Greetings!
- Greetings. Are you fine?

1599
02:08:39,865 --> 02:08:42,857
You got well quickly, very tough man.

1600
02:08:43,202 --> 02:08:44,533
Greetings.

1601
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:50,703
Are you also here, Kondal Rao?

1602
02:08:50,876 --> 02:08:55,210
My respect for you has increase
for seeing you with him.

1603
02:08:56,715 --> 02:09:00,879
Vijayawada man used to say you
don't know how to make a living!

1604
02:09:01,053 --> 02:09:03,044
l too used to join him.

1605
02:09:03,222 --> 02:09:06,055
Life is greater than making a living.

1606
02:09:06,225 --> 02:09:08,056
Risking one's life to save another
life is much more greater!

1607
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:12,561
You've proved it by example.

1608
02:09:15,734 --> 02:09:19,568
The boy you saved is none other
than my brother's son.

1609
02:09:19,738 --> 02:09:24,903
They wanted to come,
l insisted l'll meet them first.

1610
02:09:25,077 --> 02:09:28,911
l can't cry artificially.

1611
02:09:29,582 --> 02:09:31,243
l can't do another thing also.

1612
02:09:32,251 --> 02:09:36,244
Other than bowing in honour for you!

1613
02:09:40,759 --> 02:09:42,920
What are you doing, younger one?

1614
02:09:43,095 --> 02:09:46,087
You look smarter than your brother.

1615
02:09:46,265 --> 02:09:49,598
Why are you delaying?
You must catch up with life quickly.

1616
02:09:49,768 --> 02:09:54,102
How good it would be if you settle down
in life for your father's position!

1617
02:09:54,273 --> 02:09:56,764
l didn't say anything to
your elder son too.

1618
02:09:56,942 --> 02:09:59,433
Just a chide and he left angrily.

1619
02:09:59,612 --> 02:10:02,945
Let bygones b bygones.
Send him to me.

1620
02:10:03,115 --> 02:10:04,946
l'll take care of him.

1621
02:10:11,123 --> 02:10:14,456
Mother!
- l'm here son!

1622
02:10:15,628 --> 02:10:18,290
Mother, l'm leaving to
Hyderabad tomorrow evening.

1623
02:10:18,464 --> 02:10:20,125
Why don't you stay for few more days?

1624
02:10:20,299 --> 02:10:21,960
l'll stay but what will l do here?

1625
02:10:22,134 --> 02:10:23,465
l must find something there, right?

1626
02:10:24,303 --> 02:10:28,637
Tell the same thing to elder one too!
Pack him off, son!

1627
02:10:28,807 --> 02:10:33,141
He has invited him to Vizag.
lt won't be nice.

1628
02:10:33,812 --> 02:10:35,473
How long this anger would last?

1629
02:10:36,148 --> 02:10:39,140
Don't just look after yourself,
tell him strictly and pack him off.

1630
02:10:39,318 --> 02:10:40,649
Why don't you tell him that?

1631
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:42,809
You won't!

1632
02:10:44,323 --> 02:10:47,656
l've been seeing since childhood,
you tell me everything.

1633
02:10:47,826 --> 02:10:49,316
Nobody will dare ask him!

1634
02:10:50,162 --> 02:10:54,826
lf you or father had asked him
why is he loitering aimlessly?

1635
02:10:55,334 --> 02:10:56,665
He would've settled by now!

1636
02:10:57,503 --> 02:10:58,663
But you won't ask him!

1637
02:10:59,338 --> 02:11:01,499
You hesitate, fear and
feel embarrassed!

1638
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,034
You put the burden on me.

1639
02:11:03,342 --> 02:11:05,173
l'm unable to answer
the world outside.

1640
02:11:05,511 --> 02:11:07,342
You want me to send him!

1641
02:11:07,513 --> 02:11:11,347
Why are you talking like this?

1642
02:11:11,517 --> 02:11:13,678
My elder son is like that,
he's not that smart!

1643
02:11:13,852 --> 02:11:15,012
He can't get along with
people like you.

1644
02:11:15,187 --> 02:11:18,679
He can't and l too!
That's why l asked you!

1645
02:11:19,358 --> 02:11:22,850
You make big statements
of doing big things, right?

1646
02:11:24,363 --> 02:11:29,027
Fight the world...
would you get food without fighting?

1647
02:11:29,535 --> 02:11:32,026
Unable to show my face outside.

1648
02:11:32,705 --> 02:11:35,037
Everyone asks what are they doing?

1649
02:11:35,207 --> 02:11:39,041
Are you kids?
lf l ask anything you get angry!

1650
02:12:31,597 --> 02:12:34,430
What do you want me to do?

1651
02:12:35,768 --> 02:12:37,429
l don't feel like going.

1652
02:12:38,604 --> 02:12:41,596
How can l go there?
l left them once!

1653
02:12:42,441 --> 02:12:45,274
They may have changed
but what about me?

1654
02:12:46,278 --> 02:12:48,610
The same fuss, the same people!

1655
02:12:48,781 --> 02:12:50,840
Don't we know what to do?

1656
02:12:52,117 --> 02:12:55,280
You always say we must hit the jack pot.

1657
02:12:55,788 --> 02:12:56,777
You're right.

1658
02:12:58,290 --> 02:12:59,621
l still believe that.

1659
02:13:00,292 --> 02:13:02,453
There's a limit for everything, there is!

1660
02:13:03,962 --> 02:13:05,293
We'll never remain like this forever.

1661
02:13:06,632 --> 02:13:07,792
Never!

1662
02:13:13,972 --> 02:13:18,136
Do you feel that l must go back there?

1663
02:13:19,978 --> 02:13:21,138
Tell me if you feel like that.

1664
02:13:22,981 --> 02:13:26,473
Tell me, what should l do now?

1665
02:13:26,652 --> 02:13:27,983
You were born before me,

1666
02:13:28,821 --> 02:13:30,482
don't you know what to do
and what ought not to do.

1667
02:13:32,157 --> 02:13:35,888
There's a limit...
there's a limit for everything.

1668
02:13:36,662 --> 02:13:39,495
For living, for relationship
and for patience too!

1669
02:13:39,665 --> 02:13:41,155
There must be limit!

1670
02:13:41,667 --> 02:13:43,498
When asked say don't l know!

1671
02:13:44,002 --> 02:13:45,492
lf they know can't they ask!

1672
02:13:46,171 --> 02:13:49,197
Give advice about good
and bad all the day!

1673
02:13:49,508 --> 02:13:51,339
Moreover sentiments too!

1674
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:53,842
Either you or l'll feel bad
if they ask anything.

1675
02:13:54,346 --> 02:13:55,176
lf this situation continues,

1676
02:13:55,347 --> 02:13:57,838
we'll not have the
courage to die also!

1677
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:29,879
Aren't the clouds and
lightning the beacons of rain?

1678
02:14:30,048 --> 02:14:38,046
Little tiffs and anger are
other side of affection...

1679
02:14:38,223 --> 02:14:46,392
Has silence refused to hear
the laughter of happiness?

1680
02:14:46,565 --> 02:14:55,564
Has relationships refused to join
in the bond of affection?

1681
02:14:55,741 --> 02:15:03,580
Though it is bitter, we have it
happily calling it as Ugadi...

1682
02:15:03,749 --> 02:15:08,743
lf difficulties are relatives
on short visit...

1683
02:15:08,921 --> 02:15:11,754
We'll always be happy...

1684
02:15:32,444 --> 02:15:33,103
What sir?

1685
02:15:33,612 --> 02:15:35,102
Your smile is little...

1686
02:15:36,114 --> 02:15:37,775
No, l'm smiling normally.

1687
02:15:44,456 --> 02:15:45,787
l'm smiling from heart.

1688
02:15:47,626 --> 02:15:50,789
Look, 200 employees would
be working under you.

1689
02:15:50,963 --> 02:15:53,625
You've to lead them with your smile.

1690
02:16:15,821 --> 02:16:18,984
l told you he doesn't have
it in him.

1691
02:16:27,499 --> 02:16:29,660
Smile if you feel like or
cry if you feel like.

1692
02:16:29,835 --> 02:16:32,497
l can't smile as you want
for your money!

1693
02:16:32,671 --> 02:16:33,831
To hell with yourjob!

1694
02:16:36,341 --> 02:16:37,672
My foot!

1695
02:16:38,844 --> 02:16:42,678
lt's hard if you think so or
easy if you think so...

1696
02:16:42,848 --> 02:16:46,841
Decide how your life should be...

1697
02:16:47,019 --> 02:16:51,012
You won't get whatever you want...
there's a shortfall always...

1698
02:16:51,189 --> 02:16:55,523
So dream the better life...

1699
02:16:55,694 --> 02:17:03,692
Summer is for mangoes...
rainy season is for rainbows...

1700
02:17:03,869 --> 02:17:12,538
Fire to warm winters...
Smile for difficulties...

1701
02:17:57,089 --> 02:17:59,080
Shall we go to Bhadrachalam, uncle?

1702
02:17:59,257 --> 02:18:00,747
Anything special?

1703
02:18:01,093 --> 02:18:03,926
l made a vow for family visit
if you get well soon.

1704
02:18:04,262 --> 02:18:05,593
l made a vow!

1705
02:18:05,764 --> 02:18:08,426
Keep quiet, we can visit later
when everything is fine.

1706
02:18:09,101 --> 02:18:10,762
Everything will be fine
if we visit now.

1707
02:18:11,603 --> 02:18:13,093
As if you know everything.

1708
02:18:13,271 --> 02:18:15,432
Don't know, l know everything
just like that!

1709
02:18:15,607 --> 02:18:17,438
Uncle, let's go!

1710
02:18:19,277 --> 02:18:20,175
What do you say?

1711
02:18:20,946 --> 02:18:23,779
lf you want to go, okay to me also.

1712
02:18:25,617 --> 02:18:26,948
Then, l'll tell grandma.

1713
02:18:29,621 --> 02:18:30,485
Come here!

1714
02:18:32,791 --> 02:18:33,485
Sit here!

1715
02:18:34,626 --> 02:18:35,456
Shall we go?

1716
02:18:36,461 --> 02:18:39,191
Will it be fine?
- Very fine!

1717
02:18:39,798 --> 02:18:40,787
Okay!

1718
02:18:56,648 --> 02:18:57,808
Come here!

1719
02:19:00,152 --> 02:19:01,141
Sit here!

1720
02:19:04,322 --> 02:19:05,482
Elder one!

1721
02:19:07,325 --> 02:19:08,656
Come with younger one!

1722
02:19:27,846 --> 02:19:31,509
While going we must take pearls
of Rama, tell him also.

1723
02:19:37,189 --> 02:19:38,520
Look, what a glimpse!

1724
02:19:50,869 --> 02:19:54,532
Hello brother-in-law! Are you fine?

1725
02:19:54,706 --> 02:19:55,536
Uncle!

1726
02:19:56,041 --> 02:19:57,531
Vijayawada family!

1727
02:19:58,210 --> 02:19:59,939
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1728
02:20:01,546 --> 02:20:02,877
Seetha too is here.

1729
02:20:19,898 --> 02:20:31,742
Hail Lord Rama!...

1730
02:20:33,912 --> 02:20:34,901
Come here!

1731
02:20:37,749 --> 02:20:39,080
No problem, come here.

1732
02:20:42,754 --> 02:20:44,585
lnspector, come here.

1733
02:20:44,756 --> 02:20:48,089
Bring the elderly man sitting there.

1734
02:21:07,112 --> 02:21:09,103
Greetings sir.
- Are you fine?

1735
02:21:11,116 --> 02:21:13,949
Come and carry this!
Come l say!

1736
02:21:14,119 --> 02:21:16,349
People don't get this opportunity easily.

1737
02:21:20,792 --> 02:21:21,656
Okay?

1738
02:21:22,961 --> 02:21:25,623
Hail Lord Rama!...

1739
02:21:30,135 --> 02:21:33,298
This opportunity is given
by Lord Rama not me.

1740
02:21:44,482 --> 02:21:58,158
Hail Lord Rama!...

1741
02:22:07,839 --> 02:22:10,330
Take your vehicle away!
- Okay sir.

1742
02:22:10,842 --> 02:22:11,831
Take it away!

1743
02:22:53,218 --> 02:22:55,209
Mother!

1744
02:23:51,443 --> 02:23:54,435
lf anyone breaks down the transformer,
electrocution would stop.

1745
02:23:54,612 --> 02:23:56,273
lf you touch, you'll get electrocuted!

1746
02:23:56,448 --> 02:23:57,437
We would die anyway
if we stay here!

1747
02:24:10,628 --> 02:24:11,287
Elder one!

1748
02:25:00,678 --> 02:25:02,009
Send it immediately!

1749
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:07,845
Hail Lord Rama!

1750
02:25:08,019 --> 02:25:09,350
No more to fear!

1751
02:25:09,687 --> 02:25:12,019
Don't run, please sit down!

1752
02:25:50,728 --> 02:25:51,717
Move little, son.

1753
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:05,072
How people got scared in a minute!

1754
02:26:05,910 --> 02:26:08,743
ln 15 minutes, everything went haywire!

1755
02:26:09,747 --> 02:26:13,239
But you went bravely and saved people.

1756
02:26:13,585 --> 02:26:14,574
Be like that!

1757
02:26:15,253 --> 02:26:17,744
That's enough!
Everything else comes after that!

1758
02:26:19,591 --> 02:26:20,649
Look there!

1759
02:26:21,426 --> 02:26:27,262
There are cowards,
brave men, rich, doctors, peon,

1760
02:26:27,432 --> 02:26:34,770
everyone makes only one prayer,
l'm a good man, please save me.

1761
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:40,274
You may think it is drama,
it is not!

1762
02:26:41,112 --> 02:26:42,670
Generally people are good!

1763
02:26:43,448 --> 02:26:45,109
Humans mean good!

1764
02:26:50,121 --> 02:26:53,613
What did l give you?
Did l give you property?

1765
02:26:53,791 --> 02:26:55,782
l gave you wings to fend
for yourself!

1766
02:26:56,794 --> 02:26:59,957
As a common man, what can we
give back to this society?

1767
02:27:00,465 --> 02:27:02,797
Except a love filled family!

1768
02:27:02,967 --> 02:27:04,696
ls there anything better than that?

1769
02:27:07,639 --> 02:27:10,802
He's your elder brother for
this life only!

1770
02:27:11,809 --> 02:27:13,470
He's your younger brother for
this life only.

1771
02:27:13,978 --> 02:27:15,809
l'm your father for this life only!

1772
02:27:17,482 --> 02:27:20,815
Forget about life, we can't be
sure of crossing this road also.

1773
02:27:21,319 --> 02:27:24,982
That's why smile at every person
you meet and carry on.

1774
02:27:26,324 --> 02:27:29,384
There's nothing to pray to God
for ourselves.

1775
02:27:29,827 --> 02:27:33,160
lf you still wish to ask,
pray for your neighbor.

1776
02:27:36,834 --> 02:27:41,168
God! Any man who leads his
life honestly,

1777
02:27:41,339 --> 02:27:45,173
never take him away from smile!

1778
02:27:51,182 --> 02:27:52,012
That's all!

1779
02:27:58,022 --> 02:27:59,683
Come, let's go.

1780
02:28:56,581 --> 02:28:58,412
That is...

1781
02:28:58,583 --> 02:29:00,244
Whatever it is
say it on my face!

1782
02:29:12,263 --> 02:29:14,128
l'm intoxicated by men.

1783
02:29:15,099 --> 02:29:17,932
That's why l blabbered as l wished!

1784
02:29:19,437 --> 02:29:21,098
Likewise l would've done
with you also.

1785
02:29:21,606 --> 02:29:22,834
Don't take it seriously.

1786
02:29:23,274 --> 02:29:29,110
No, l used to tell me something new!

1787
02:29:29,781 --> 02:29:34,275
But when you said you were
born before me, don't you know that?

1788
02:29:34,452 --> 02:29:36,443
l felt it was something really new!

1789
02:29:38,456 --> 02:29:42,290
Who else is there for me
other than you!

1790
02:29:46,297 --> 02:29:47,457
You were younger to me,

1791
02:29:48,299 --> 02:29:52,463
l thought l could tell
everything to you.

1792
02:29:54,472 --> 02:29:59,307
But l didn't know my words
would test you so much!

1793
02:30:00,812 --> 02:30:03,178
You could've told me that day itself.

1794
02:30:06,651 --> 02:30:07,811
Just one thing!

1795
02:30:09,654 --> 02:30:11,178
Once born, we must live great!

1796
02:30:12,557 --> 02:30:14,320
Must have a good life and
be good to everyone.

1797
02:30:14,492 --> 02:30:15,186
That's all!

1798
02:30:15,993 --> 02:30:19,827
When l didn't see it in you,
l used to get angry.

1799
02:30:20,665 --> 02:30:24,658
Unable to tell you directly,
l said something indirectly.

1800
02:30:26,003 --> 02:30:29,495
Not because you're elder to me.
You're a good man!

1801
02:30:30,174 --> 02:30:31,004
Much better man than me.

1802
02:30:31,676 --> 02:30:34,167
Not just me, you're better
than all here.

1803
02:30:41,519 --> 02:30:45,182
You were right, l play drama.

1804
02:30:46,023 --> 02:30:47,354
l played many a drama.

1805
02:30:48,359 --> 02:30:51,692
With you...with a girl...
with everyone!

1806
02:30:52,697 --> 02:30:53,686
Shut up!

1807
02:30:55,032 --> 02:30:58,195
You know at least something,
l don't know that too.

1808
02:30:58,870 --> 02:31:00,531
l didn't know how to behave...

1809
02:31:01,205 --> 02:31:03,867
...and was adamant
on behaving like this only.

1810
02:31:04,041 --> 02:31:08,876
With that one line,
l played more drama than you.

1811
02:31:11,048 --> 02:31:12,208
Father was right,

1812
02:31:14,051 --> 02:31:15,541
you're my brother
for this life only.

1813
02:31:16,721 --> 02:31:18,052
l'm your younger brother
for this life.

1814
02:31:18,723 --> 02:31:21,886
ls it for this life only?

1815
02:31:22,393 --> 02:31:23,951
That's the problem with you!

1816
02:31:24,729 --> 02:31:28,563
River Godavari turned red at dawn...

1817
02:31:28,733 --> 02:31:32,567
The hue is competing with henna...

1818
02:31:40,745 --> 02:31:43,737
The hand with hue is blushing red...

1819
02:31:43,915 --> 02:31:47,749
The blushing belle is draped in sari...

1820
02:31:48,419 --> 02:31:51,582
Who is the moon in sari?

1821
02:31:51,756 --> 02:31:56,284
She's none other than beautiful Seethamma...

1822
02:31:58,095 --> 02:32:00,256
You wanted to leave everyone
and go away, right?

1823
02:32:00,431 --> 02:32:01,762
l know everything from the beginning.

1824
02:32:01,933 --> 02:32:03,924
l know what had happened
between you both.

1825
02:32:04,101 --> 02:32:05,432
Not only me, uncle too knows it.

1826
02:32:05,603 --> 02:32:06,763
l told him everything.

1827
02:32:06,938 --> 02:32:07,927
How do you know it?

1828
02:32:08,105 --> 02:32:10,300
Don't know, l know everything
just like that!

1829
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:13,607
What did l deny you?

1830
02:32:13,778 --> 02:32:16,110
Like other husbands when
their wives get headache,

1831
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:20,307
you can't apply balm or
say sweet words!

1832
02:32:21,619 --> 02:32:24,110
You don't have to look after me
even if l get fever.

1833
02:32:24,288 --> 02:32:27,121
No need to take me to
a film too in life!

1834
02:32:32,964 --> 02:32:36,627
Jasmine twig in the
courtyard of Seethamma...

1835
02:32:36,801 --> 02:32:40,635
lt is blooming with flowers...

1836
02:32:40,805 --> 02:32:44,639
Pluck the flowers without
disturbing the branch...

1837
02:32:44,809 --> 02:32:48,472
Deck Seethamma's tresses
with jasmine...

1838
02:32:48,646 --> 02:32:52,309
Flowers in the tresses are
spreading fragrance...

1839
02:32:52,483 --> 02:32:55,975
Kodanda Ramayya is coming...

1840
02:32:56,153 --> 02:32:59,816
Here comes Ramayya...

1841
02:32:59,991 --> 02:33:03,825
Spread his magical charm
on his arrival...

1842
02:33:14,005 --> 02:33:21,502
This is the place Seetha
becomes consort of Rama...

1843
02:33:21,679 --> 02:33:28,847
lt's the time earth and
sky become kinsmen...

1844
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:36,688
Three knots will make the
three worlds to celebrate...

1845
02:33:36,861 --> 02:33:43,528
Seven steps together would
make them a couple forever...

1846
02:33:50,708 --> 02:33:54,371
Jasmine twig in the
courtyard of Seethamma...

1847
02:33:54,545 --> 02:33:58,379
A parrot made home in it...

1848
02:33:58,549 --> 02:34:02,383
The parrot said a charming word...

1849
02:34:02,553 --> 02:34:06,045
Hearing the word would make
you say Oh God...

1850
02:34:06,223 --> 02:34:08,214
Seetha's heart chanted
the name of Rama...

1851
02:34:08,392 --> 02:34:10,223
What else?
- You tell me.

1852
02:34:10,394 --> 02:34:13,386
You tell me.
- What else?

1853
02:34:13,564 --> 02:34:17,398
Did you find a man
more handsome than me? Got him?

1854
02:34:17,568 --> 02:34:19,399
You too said a girl

1855
02:34:19,570 --> 02:34:22,232
who cheeks would turn pink
for 30 days forjust one kiss.

1856
02:34:22,406 --> 02:34:23,236
Did you find her?

1857
02:34:24,408 --> 02:34:26,069
You're smarter than you appear.

1858
02:34:26,243 --> 02:34:29,406
You too, people say like that!

1859
02:34:31,082 --> 02:34:33,073
Who is that?
- That's l this time.

1860
02:34:34,919 --> 02:34:35,908
Won't you've lunch?

1861
02:34:36,253 --> 02:34:39,745
l thought it easily but
it's not an ordinary matter.

1862
02:34:39,924 --> 02:34:42,085
You're a great man.
- You're too much.

1863
02:34:42,259 --> 02:34:43,920
You gave two daughters for
our progeny to continue.

1864
02:34:44,095 --> 02:34:45,756
Who could be greater than you?

1865
