1
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,366
- Hey Kunal, come on and join us!
- Yes man! You mustjoin in.

2
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,829
Hey shortie! Beat me and l'll
treat you to an ice cream.

3
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,990
- Bet!
- Bet!

4
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:08,891
Good morning, Sir!

5
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,938
Go, Kunal.

6
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,940
- Who wins, brains or brawn!
- Brawn!

7
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,846
- Got you! Got you!
- Kunal... Kunal...

8
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,019
- Yes! - Father Peter
would like to meet you.

9
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,686
l'll have my ice cream
when l return.

10
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,452
Kunal, l've received a letter
from your Uncle and...

11
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,332
... there is something
you should know.

12
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,431
Your Uncle insists that he wants

13
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:49,335
you to study in the school
run by him in his town.

14
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,548
But Sir, l don't want to go there.

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,648
Son, since the last three years

16
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,716
after your parents passed away..

17
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,727
..we have tried to make
this school your home.

18
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,595
But my child... Your Uncle
is your legal guardian.

19
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,405
Sir, please Sir...

20
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,338
Please sir.

21
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,933
There is nothing l can do.

22
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,838
l want to stay here.

23
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,681
Please sir.

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,518
Sorry Kunal... l am so sorry.

25
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:28,538
Far, far away... is a valley
ln that valley... is a town

26
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:38,951
The days and nights are strange
Everything there is unusual

27
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:49,625
Lend me your ears listen
to this tale

28
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,869
There's a small town And
the story begins there

29
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,567
All through the year The
seasons are lovely

30
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,441
The streets are lined with
trees and their shade

31
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,141
And flowers on every branch
that never seem to fade

32
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,042
There's a small town And
the story begins there

33
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,816
All through the year The
seasons are lovely

34
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,951
The streets are lined with
trees and their shade

35
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,656
And flowers on every branch
that never seem to fade

36
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,531
The people here know not
about the outside world

37
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,732
This town's thinking is
centuries old

38
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,476
What a town, O Lord

39
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,914
What a town, O Lord

40
00:04:52,859 --> 00:05:00,561
They have joys and sorrows but know
little of the world outside

41
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:15,844
Their simplicity is their downfall

42
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:23,252
Those they revere, fool
and betray them

43
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,951
The streets are lined with
trees and their shade

44
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,860
And flowers on every branch
that never seem to fade

45
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,592
The people here know not
about the outside world

46
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:39,195
This town's thinking
is centuries old

47
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:47,002
What a town, O Lord!

48
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:58,087
Though darkness has spread

49
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:05,587
This deceit shall pass

50
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,863
A new dawn shall come

51
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,234
People will arise

52
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:21,108
O gentle and meek, hear this!

53
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,651
Here he is... First he was a curse
for his parents, now it's us!

54
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,924
- Bless you! - That's enough...

55
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,758
Baban... take him in.

56
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,301
Son, sit down and stay away
from him... he is jinxed.

57
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,277
Do you think you're royalty!

58
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,213
Your parents send you to school
so that you learn...

59
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,988
... you study, so that we
can make humans out of you.

60
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,894
Backsides up!

61
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,194
And in today's world to
become human you need?

62
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,967
English.

63
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:30,045
Teacher go fartee.

64
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,119
This means the teacher
has gone to drink tea.

65
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:41,386
Repeat after me: Teacher go fartee.

66
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,958
Hey you rabbit, why are you
showing me your teeth.

67
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,270
Sir... it's not teacher go fartee.

68
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,234
''Teacher has gone for tea''
is correct English.

69
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,205
Heard that? The school
belongs to his uncle...

70
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,414
... while the English language
belongs to his aunt.

71
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,411
And himself
- he's royalty.

72
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,147
Now he will teach us English.

73
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,017
Come here.

74
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,291
From Dehradun is he!
An Englishman is he!

75
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,767
To his senses will come he! When
a home grown slap wakes he!

76
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:07,245
Now he'll go home with a long face
and won't act smart from today.

77
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,744
Kunal...

78
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,086
This is how it is here, Kunal.
Never say anything clever.

79
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,464
Fomenting will help.

80
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,494
He hit me on the other cheek.

81
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,101
Missing your old school
in Dehradun?

82
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,471
The teachers there never beat you?

83
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,168
Did they punish you?

84
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,343
The teachers spoke with a smile?

85
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,809
Do the masters there laugh?

86
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,851
lmpossible! At most, those
masters may smile sometimes.

87
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,077
Here the masters only beat us.

88
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,486
Just because we're small, they
beat us when they want?

89
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,519
They will punish us? Force us
to stand with our hands up?

90
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,289
And we can do nothing!

91
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,853
What can we do? We may want
to do so many things.

92
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,465
But kids are helpless.
They are so lazy.

93
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,861
Not ''lazy'', ''weak''.

94
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,062
Yes children are weak...

95
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,098
lf you think you're weak,
you are weak.

96
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,172
My mother used to tell me...

97
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,804
''You're as strong as
you believe you are.''

98
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,986
You're as strong as
you believe you are.

99
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,129
Take this, my love!

100
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,336
Oh... look how greedily
he is looking at my baby.

101
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,575
- Give him a bit... - No! No!

102
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,142
Give it, my son. Otherwise his evil
eye will ruin your appetite.

103
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,289
Happy birthday, Kunal.

104
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,965
Happy birthday, Kunal.

105
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,350
Arju, catch me if you can!

106
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,592
Kunal!

107
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,733
Ghosts live there.

108
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,374
- Stop yelling! Or you'll alert them.
- There are no such thing as ghosts.

109
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,013
Kunal, there are ghosts in there.

110
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,345
Bad things happen to
anyone who enters.

111
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,474
lt can't be true.

112
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,609
lt's true.

113
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,620
That's why even Pehalwaan Mama
is afraid to enter that house.

114
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,155
There are ghosts here.

115
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:50,351
My parents said there are no ghosts
and they never told lies.

116
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,688
There are no ghosts.

117
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,099
lf there are no ghosts, l dare
you to enter that house!

118
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,496
Come on, if you've got the guts.

119
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,508
- See, you got scared! - l'm
not scared of anything.

120
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,167
Then enter that house.

121
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,436
Go.

122
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,450
Actually nobody's forcing you.
lf you're scared, forget it.

123
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,645
l'm not a coward.

124
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,450
Kunal, stop!

125
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,190
What will happen to him?

126
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:57,358
You're as strong as
you believe you are.

127
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,140
Kunal, run! He's a mad man!

128
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,713
- He is dangerous. - He
makes children disappear.

129
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,544
He practises black magic. Run Kunal!

130
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,458
Here you go, Sir!

131
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,566
Sir, you're looking so handsome...
just like a bridegroom.

132
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,608
Focus on your work and don't forget!

133
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,177
Please excuse me for being late.

134
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,209
People of that village
were so happy that...

135
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,216
...l was giving them a new school...

136
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,783
just not letting me go...
raining garlands!

137
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:01,887
They told me to plead with you
to sanction the grants soon.

138
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,821
l told them how big-hearted
you all were.

139
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,287
What will you have
- tea, coffee, something cold?

140
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,762
May l speak to ddddd...
Deshrajji, please?

141
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,329
- Shahrukh! King Khan!
- Unbelievable!

142
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,433
King Khan for the world.
But for you...

143
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,535
l will always be the middle-class boy
from Delhi with dreams in his eyes.

144
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,342
You were the first to
see those dreams.

145
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,182
Shahrukh, please. Giving me
more credit than l deserve!

146
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:34,322
Deshrajji, l rang up
to congratulate you.

147
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,859
l've come to know you're opening
five more schools.

148
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,188
Shahrukh, with your support my
dream to open up 5,000 schools

149
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,598
will surely come true.

150
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,429
ln fact, the Education Officer
is sitting right in front of me.

151
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,498
Then l have called at the right
time. Give him the phone.

152
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,736
He wants to speak to you.

153
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:59,774
Shahrukhji, l'm Shyamlal Markanda.
l'm a huge fan of yours.

154
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,409
Markandaji...

155
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,654
... forget about screen heroes,
let's talk about real life heroes.

156
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,917
Like our Mr. Deshraj.

157
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,289
one of the finest educationists
in the country.

158
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,294
He really deserves all
your help and support.

159
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,194
Yes, Sir... certainly, Sir...
Thank you, Sir.

160
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:18,463
Markandaji, thanks to you, Sir!
Goodbye! Khudahaafiz! God bless!

161
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,805
You are too kind, Sir.

162
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,666
He has hung up.

163
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,571
Never forgets what l've done for him.
Anyway, let's get down to business.

164
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,748
- She is... - l forgot
to introduce to you...

165
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,447
... she is Choudhary Madam, from
the state audit department.

166
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,580
Okay.

167
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,950
Sit down, Deshrajji.

168
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,557
we have studied your proposal
but there is a serious problem.

169
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,527
Your accounts show that 6
million rupees are missing.

170
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,794
Money sanctioned by the government
for library, laboratory, benches...

171
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,338
... seems to have been diverted
to your personal account.

172
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,273
ln fact, l've come here for your ..

173
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,343
.. explanation before l
file a police complaint.

174
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,002
Police!

175
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,677
- Can't we do something?
- There is a plan.

176
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,019
You know my brother left
some money for Kunal?

177
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,295
Notjust some money.
7.5 million rupees...

178
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,797
... but he gets the money
only when he's 21 .

179
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,031
But if anything happens to Kunal...

180
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,969
...then the money goes to his
only relatives. That's us.

181
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,779
Oh, we can't do that.

182
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,046
Oh, so we can't do that!

183
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,449
lnstead l should rot in jail. Or
better still drown in the river...

184
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,924
... or hang myself.
But we can't do that!

185
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:50,919
Stop it!

186
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,856
What do l have to do?

187
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,305
Kunal!

188
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,434
- Would you like a ride?
- No, Uncle, l am afraid of heights.

189
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,853
Would you like to try this ride?

190
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,550
No, Uncle, remember l told you,
l am afraid of heights.

191
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,753
And l told you there is
nothing to be afraid of.

192
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,787
Would you sit with me?

193
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,789
l?

194
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,629
Please, Uncle... l
am afraid of heights.

195
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,759
Don't worry, son.

196
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,462
We have come all the way here,
let's try one ride at least.

197
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,597
Please, Uncle, l feel nauseous.

198
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,470
No, son, we have already
purchased the tickets.

199
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:15,878
Opportunities likes these
are rare. Sit and enjoy...

200
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,539
Uncle...

201
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,162
Uncle... Uncle!

202
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,207
Uncle... l am not your Uncle!

203
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,679
Uncle...

204
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,247
Hello!

205
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,589
Rajrani, tell everyone Kunal
died in a train accident.

206
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:15,993
Oh God, he was so young... You
should have killed me instead.

207
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,645
Give it to me... come on... let go.

208
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,948
- l want the bag...
- Even l want it...

209
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,644
Let go!

210
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,789
Get lost... you scoundrels.

211
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:23,992
Got scared!

212
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,199
l'm not afraid of anyone.

213
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,607
Good. You're as strong
as you believe you are.

214
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,003
What did you say?

215
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,242
- You're as strong as...
- you believe you are.

216
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,049
My mother taught me that.

217
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,177
Good.

218
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,979
Oh! Same to same.
Teached the truth.

219
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,816
What's a kid like you doing
in a place like this?

220
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:51,089
l came here with my uncle.
He took me to the theme park...

221
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,165
... and there l got lost.

222
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,794
Give me your address,
l'll take you home.

223
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,995
lt's very far away...
in the hills...

224
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,035
l'll tell you what.
Tonight, stay with me.

225
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,700
Tomorrow morning, we'll
go find your uncle.

226
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,075
No, it's okay, l'll manage.

227
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,041
Your wish! Great house...

228
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,276
... and lovely neighbours.
Good night!

229
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,128
- What happened?
- Nothing...

230
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,689
You should not be alone so late
at night. l'll come with you.

231
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,228
Getting lost is not
such a bad thing.

232
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,264
Sometimes we have to lose ourselves
to find ourselves.

233
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,943
- By the way, my name's Kitu.
- Kunal!

234
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,803
Let's go!

235
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,820
Kitu Didi!

236
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,428
- Come! - Kitu Didi!

237
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,826
Be quiet!

238
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,287
What is this place?

239
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,067
This is a warehouse, costumes and
props from films are kept here.

240
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,064
Why did we enter through a window?

241
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,433
What difference does it make?
My dear!

242
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,806
When people shut the doors of their
hearts, we enter through the window.

243
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,304
Does this place belong to you?

244
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:51,344
Kunal, for an artist the
whole world is her home.

245
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,448
During the day, l draw
people's portraits...

246
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,150
... and at night, this
becomes my home.

247
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,415
lsn't it wrong to live in
someone else's place?

248
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,022
Now you listen, old man...

249
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,296
it's wrong for humans
to sleep on pavements

250
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,993
where rich kids drive over them.
Nothing's wrong with living here.

251
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,041
- You live alone? - Yes.

252
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,169
And your family?

253
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,394
Kitu Didi, don't you have a family?

254
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:49,329
Forget it. Life is very cruel,
you'll not understand.

255
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,805
l may be small but l know
how cruel life is.

256
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,551
Tell everybody the truth.

257
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:03,945
What happened on that day!

258
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,017
what happened that day?
Tell us..

259
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,820
Go on, son... tell them
what happened that day.

260
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:17,894
Kunal entered the haunted house.

261
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:30,905
We warned him not to enter.

262
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:36,213
l told him bad things happen
to people who go in.

263
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,179
But...

264
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,854
Who can avoid destiny!

265
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,891
His death was pre-ordained.

266
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:58,533
His death was
the wrath of the ghosts.

267
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,242
lt's the revenge of the ghosts!

268
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,316
Kunal, where are your mom and dad?

269
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,890
My mom and dad...
on a mountaineering trip...

270
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,191
... they had an accident.

271
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:32,340
Kunal, do you know that
after good people die...

272
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,574
... they become stars. Come let's
find your mom and dad in the sky.

273
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,948
- Kitu Didi!
- Yes.

274
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,380
When there were no human beings
on earth, there were still stars.

275
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,513
Meaning?

276
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,386
There is no connection between
people dying and stars.

277
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,518
l may be small but l know the truth.

278
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:56,393
You talk like a wise man, but you've
not understood one thing.

279
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,525
What?

280
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,938
Sometimes we have to look at the ..

281
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,602
.. world not with our minds,
but with our hearts.

282
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,069
What good will that do?

283
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,517
Stars leap out of our science
books and become our friends.

284
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,020
The moon becomes more than
the earth's satellite.

285
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,022
He becomes your pal. Understand?

286
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,686
Wait, l'll make you understand.

287
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,439
No matter what, always smile

288
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,237
All that happens, let it go

289
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,174
The world may be upside down

290
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,218
But there's one truth my heart knows

291
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,254
Where joy abounds, that's real life

292
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,493
All that happens, let it go

293
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,332
Take that worry off your face

294
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,458
Just as you dust off your coat

295
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,732
May sorrow never reside ln your
heart that's pure inside

296
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,442
All that happens, let it go

297
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:20,017
All that happens why

298
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:25,152
it does no one knows

299
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:32,586
Why some lose, why some win

300
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:39,635
no one knows

301
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,244
Look at this circus called life

302
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,786
People walk the never-ending streets

303
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,578
Everyone with hope in their eyes

304
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,627
They stumble and fall
They know not what's going on

305
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:08,563
Argument and fights galore
They scream, their voices sore

306
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,658
Get it, got it? Did you?

307
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:16,797
All that happens Why

308
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:23,808
it does no one knows

309
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:59,310
Where joy abounds,
that's real life

310
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,418
All that happens, let it go

311
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,387
Every day troubles grow We
still love the world so

312
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,791
After all it is our home

313
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,453
Let's nurture it Appreciate it

314
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,190
Let flowers bloom

315
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,698
Love each other Nurture love

316
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,358
Make friends Sing songs of
happiness

317
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:22,804
All that happens Why

318
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:29,706
it does no one knows

319
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:35,811
Why some lose, why some win

320
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,892
no one knows

321
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,849
Deshrajji, please stay calm.

322
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,388
His face was so smashed.

323
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,660
The ghosts have claimed Kunal.

324
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:31,503
May the gods give you and
your family strength.

325
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:42,383
Please give us a private
moment with Kunal.

326
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,532
- That's enough, Rajrani.
They have left. - Yes.

327
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,877
Poor Kunal.

328
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,987
l will always miss Kunal.

329
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,452
lf you miss him, thats ok! Sir.

330
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,654
Sir, what if he comes back?

331
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,262
lmpossible. Jhunjhunmakadstrama...

332
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,860
... such a tongue-twister. Will
he remember our town's name?

333
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,340
Can he make the long journey
and find this place?

334
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,540
And how long do you think he'll
survive on the city's mean streets?

335
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,698
- There must be some confusion,
Kunal. - No, Kitu Didi. l'm sure.

336
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,596
He deliberately left me behind.

337
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,172
See, we'll do one thing.

338
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,308
l'm taking you back home.
l want to find out...

339
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,742
... what kind of person
would leave you behind?

340
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:18,345
But, if they're not happy to see
me, can l come back with you?

341
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,549
Kunal, l don't even have a home.

342
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,317
Home is where you are.

343
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,930
Run, Kunal!

344
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:45,335
Taxi... Station... Go! Go!

345
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,467
Hurry up!

346
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,679
Hey... stop!

347
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,749
Come!

348
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,023
Sit down. l'll get us some snacks.

349
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,563
Please give me a packet of fries.

350
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,434
When will you stop doing this,
Kitu?

351
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,792
Kitu Didi...!

352
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,788
l haven't done anything!

353
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,462
Kunal, don'tjump!
Go to your uncle's house.

354
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,872
l'll find you there. l promise.

355
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,414
This girl must have been
living in that godown

356
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,080
..for at least three months.

357
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,623
You've just discovered it?

358
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,487
Since when?
- Six months, five days.

359
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,491
- And before that?
- Five months at the Museum.

360
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,902
- And before that?
- Two months in lnorbit Mall.

361
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,114
Why do you do this, Kitu? This time
you'll go in for some time.

362
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,773
Take her away.

363
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,696
Thank you, Uncle... Bye!

364
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,944
Kunal?

365
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,749
Babloo! Wait for me, Babloo!

366
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,953
Ghost!

367
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,240
Ghost! Kunal's ghost!

368
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,660
- Have you gone mad? - l swear,
there is a ghost out there.

369
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,664
Give him a glass of water.

370
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,279
Ghost! Kunal's ghost!

371
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,025
Window! Through the window!

372
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:53,173
Because he died in an accident
his soul is not at rest.

373
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,050
That's why he returned as a ghost.
God knows what havoc it will create.

374
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,070
Open the door! Mummy! Papa!

375
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,210
- Come in, you are wet.
- What happened!

376
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,343
Papa! Kunal's ghost...
l saw Kunal's ghost.

377
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,290
Oh God! He's come back!

378
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,364
Now what will we do? What
are you searching for?

379
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,918
Please don't do anything
you'll regret later.

380
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,393
People think he's a ghost. There's
no punishment for killing a ghost!

381
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,055
Oh God!

382
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,200
Deshrajji, did you
see Kunal's ghost?

383
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,194
Ghost?

384
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,937
Get out!

385
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,804
l'm a ghost.

386
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,276
Get out!
- Really, l'm a ghost.

387
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:40,010
l said, Get out!
- l told you no, l'm a ghost.

388
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,942
Don't come close.
- Get out!

389
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,015
Stupid boy! There are no ghosts.

390
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,417
Please don't throw me out.
My uncle wants to kill me.

391
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,895
So you are Kunal!

392
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,425
Please let me stay here tonight.
Help me please.

393
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,298
Why should l help anyone?

394
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,840
You don't need a reason
to help someone.

395
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:13,048
All folks are warned.

396
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:18,918
The ghost of a boy is
roaming the town.

397
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,921
Fools! ldiots!

398
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,926
They will always remain idiots!

399
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,870
Superstitious! They believe in
ghosts and they call me mad!

400
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,070
Why is everybody calling me
a ghost? - You're dead.

401
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,337
Your uncle has even performed
your last rites.

402
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,010
There are two kinds of
people in the world!

403
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,012
Those who make others fools
and those who become fools.

404
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,014
Don't follow me. You'll regret it.

405
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,509
Leela, l have to leave
this place soon.

406
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,379
l need to get home.
- Home!

407
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,583
Yes, Leela, l have to leave this
place by any means possible.

408
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,518
Kunal must be waiting for me.

409
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,647
Magic... just magic.

410
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,181
How dare you! What
are you doing here?

411
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,514
Get out of here!

412
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,523
Magic... Uncle, just magic.

413
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,459
l'm not your uncle and this
is science, not magic.

414
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,528
Don't call science, magic!

415
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:58,673
l am sorry. But l know this
is a laser projection.

416
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,072
So?

417
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,738
Laser means: light amplification by
stimulated emission of radiation.

418
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,145
There is no place for
science in this town.

419
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,482
Get out of here or you will
become just like them.

420
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,151
But you too live in the same town.

421
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,627
l don't live in the town! l
live in this haunted house!

422
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,096
Go away!

423
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:27,102
Don't show your unlucky
face again. Go away!

424
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,177
Why do you think this ghost
has come to haunt the town?

425
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:41,181
To wreak revenge on those that
troubled him when he was alive.

426
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,516
They never forgive.

427
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,519
This is the revenge of the ghosts.

428
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,192
Revenge of the ghosts!

429
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,137
Where are you going?

430
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,212
l'm leaving.
- You're going nowhere.

431
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,282
l'm leaving.
- You're not leaving.

432
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,814
l have to go. Kitu Didi will
come to take me away.

433
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,751
Kitu Didi! Even in your sleep
you were muttering about her.

434
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,618
Nobody is coming here.
- She will come. She promised.

435
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:27,358
Don't go. l can show you how
to get even with your Uncle.

436
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,289
l don't want to get
even with anybody.

437
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,564
My Uncle and Aunt don't love me.

438
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,763
The teachers in school are cruel.
l have nobody here.

439
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:41,509
Go away then! l'll fight
alone. l need no one.

440
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,869
He's turned out a coward
like the rest.

441
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:17,736
lf he had stayed, people would have
realized the truth about Deshraj.

442
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,217
This town could have been
transformed.

443
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,221
But, he too had no courage.

444
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,416
l am with you, Magic Uncle.

445
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,432
l never lose courage.

446
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,306
We'll change the face of this town.

447
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,505
For now you're no longer
a small boy...

448
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,310
... you're a dangerous ghost which
the entire town is terrified of.

449
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,709
Just as steel cuts steel, fear will
be used to drive away fear.

450
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,653
You will do this.

451
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,455
- But what if l get caught?
- lmpossible!

452
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,387
With science at the service
of a ghost? Never!

453
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,744
You're as strong as
you believe you are.

454
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:39,621
Listen brother, it's time to rise

455
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:45,624
To accept without a thought
is just not wise

456
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:49,432
Look, think, understand, recognize

457
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,567
To blindly accept is just not wise

458
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:03,977
Listen brother, it's time to rise

459
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:09,985
To accept without a thought
is just not wise

460
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:13,995
Look, think, understand, recognize

461
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:20,403
To blindly accept is just not wise

462
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:52,499
For ages the world has
been in the dark

463
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:58,841
Now you need to shine
like a bright spark

464
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:04,904
lt's been said before
and l'll say it again

465
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,041
When the courage is within you

466
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:12,520
There is nothing you lack

467
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,760
- Zokkomon? - Yes, Zokkomon!

468
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,027
Don't you know how to sweep?

469
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,901
- Come on... faster!
- Haven't you eaten?

470
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:11,641
Why are you so late? Were you
waiting for an invitation?

471
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,909
Son, please eat this.
lt's very tasty.

472
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,582
You think you're royalty! Hurry up!

473
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,459
l'll slap both of you now. Can't
you see the dust in that corner.

474
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,458
Polish it so well that
anybody looking..

475
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:28,792
..at the statue will be impressed.

476
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:32,798
Sir! Our Deshraj sahib really
looks impressive.

477
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,527
Why not!

478
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,799
Craftsmen came all the way from
Jaipur to carve out this statue.

479
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:40,135
Our Deshrajji is no
less than a king.

480
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,944
He does not allow even a
fly to sit on his nose.

481
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,547
His nose is cut!

482
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,213
Where is his nose?

483
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,493
Who is it? Who dared to do this?

484
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:10,496
Who is it? Who dared to do this?
l will skin you rascals alive.

485
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,841
We did nothing, Sir. lt
happened by itself.

486
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:14,967
How?

487
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,978
Sir, from that corner... the
rascal is hiding over there.

488
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,108
l'll get him!

489
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,583
Please come, Sir!

490
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,648
We will get him! We
won't let him escape!

491
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,184
Be careful, Sir!

492
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,054
Check there!

493
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:35,648
Sir!

494
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:40,662
Help... help!

495
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:35,708
Ghost!

496
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:51,730
- Sir! What happened? - Ghost!
From up, from down.

497
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:57,730
Stop!

498
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:04,005
How was l born? Where am l from?

499
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,747
What will l do? Who am l?

500
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:15,818
l am your inner voice,
l am Zokkomon.

501
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,694
Listen carefully ...

502
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,169
... because very
soon we shall meet again!

503
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:08,874
Sir, the ghost... he's
going to come again.

504
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,804
He will come every day.

505
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,884
Shantaram, stop crying! Go home
and keep your mouth shut!

506
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,281
There is no such ghost.
He's an imposter.

507
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,357
Papa, it's Kunal's ghost!
l've seen him.

508
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:22,754
Go to your room now!

509
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:28,888
Go away now. Ghost! Ridiculous!

510
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,162
lf people come to know
that Kunal is alive,

511
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,830
..then it will be the end of us.

512
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:49,107
People will only know
if he remains alive.

513
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:02,191
My name is Zokkomon!

514
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,859
Magic Uncle, you should have
seen his face when he saw me.

515
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,266
When they were hung upside down.

516
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:13,865
Stop being childish, will you,
there's lots of work to do.

517
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:19,472
- But l am a child. - Not anymore.
Now you're Zokkomon.

518
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,886
Madam, please let me go.

519
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,480
There's a little boy who
was living with me.

520
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,889
l don't know what he's going
through and where he is.

521
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,230
l'm begging. Madam,
please l need parole.

522
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:39,527
Madam please, listen to me.
please madam....

523
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,119
How many times have l warned you
- don't touch any of my stuff.

524
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:09,520
You never mentioned that you are the
renowned scientist Dr. Vivek Ray!

525
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:10,860
Shut up!

526
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,991
Why did you come to this town?

527
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,862
And why didn't you try to
educate the town folk?

528
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,943
- None of your business. - No, Magic
Uncle, you will have to tell me.

529
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:28,543
Fine. Don't tell me. Now even
l don't want to support you.

530
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,155
l left everything behind
to come here.

531
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:40,225
Because this is my home town.

532
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,364
l built a laboratory, tried to use
science to improve people's lives.

533
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,102
But Deshraj was threatened.

534
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,898
He wanted the town folk to stay
superstitious, fearful.

535
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,373
lt helped his scams.

536
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:58,307
- Long live. - Swamidev Baba.

537
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,974
Deshraj used Swamidev Baba well.

538
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,977
They both plotted against me.

539
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,528
Why are you not helping me?

540
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:30,143
Nobody can help you. This
is the wrath of the Gods.

541
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,952
l could have dealt with
Deshraj all by myself...

542
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,622
... but so long as the town
folk remained superstitious,

543
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,966
Deshraj would keep fooling them.

544
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:57,439
lt was impossible to keep the truth
or science alive among these people.

545
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,969
So l retreated into
the haunted house.

546
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,370
Where people feared to enter. Where
l could keep science alive.

547
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:09,512
And l waited for the right time.

548
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,468
Zokkomon has come!

549
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,492
Sir, now what should we do?
The ghost has come back.

550
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,356
- What nonsense you're speaking!
- No, Sir.

551
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,853
Where is he?

552
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,029
There's no one here.

553
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,626
There's no one here.

554
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,437
What are you staring at?

555
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:13,447
Deshraj... is a thief.

556
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,253
Who has done this? Speak out!

557
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,253
l have done it.

558
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,126
Who are you?

559
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,399
Zokkomon!

560
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,533
Zokkomon, if you have the
guts, show yourself!

561
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,750
Go home. Shantaram,
send them all home!

562
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,426
Children, go home now.
Go away... move.

563
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:28,114
You received half a million
rupees for a new library.

564
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,522
Where is the money Deshraj?

565
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,188
Show yourself you scoundrel.

566
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,202
Sure! Come downstairs Deshu.

567
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,794
Get out.

568
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,540
Stand back... get out of the way!

569
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,337
Show yourself, you scoundrel!
l will swallow you up.

570
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,811
Just as you swallow up
the money meant...

571
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,211
...for mid-day meals for children!

572
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,814
What are you doing here, go
to your classes immediately.

573
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:03,153
These kids will have their
class right here...

574
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:07,161
... where Zokkomon will teach them
how to fight for their rights.

575
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,421
Shut up.

576
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:18,504
Where are you? l am warning you,
my fury will burn you.

577
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,182
Oh, looks like your fury has
set your pants on fire!

578
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,326
Fire...

579
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:13,484
Your game is up! Just watch
as l reduce you to dust.

580
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,792
Prepare for war, my friends.

581
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:51,330
Each child in this town
will soon be Zokkomon.

582
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,682
Zokkomon!

583
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:43,317
Through the darkestjungles
and highest mountains

584
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:47,515
Arose a call The darkness
will soon fade

585
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,530
And in every alley and every lane

586
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:01,403
The new day will shine bright

587
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:05,739
He roused us up from our sleep

588
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:10,605
Taught us that we can if we believe

589
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:15,013
He planted the ray of hope

590
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:19,349
Hear his name

591
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:23,687
Zokkomon

592
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:51,043
Think defeat and you've lost
Believe victory and you've won

593
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,579
That's my creed, it
gets everything done

594
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:04,395
lnjustice and persecution
if it exists

595
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,937
We won't bow down to it

596
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:17,945
We may be small but
it doesn't matter

597
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,413
We have the courage,
the will to go on

598
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,417
We have the courage,
the will to go on

599
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:31,824
lt's now up to us The
change is ours to bring

600
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:36,557
He planted the ray of hope

601
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,692
Hear his name

602
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,714
Sir, do you have any answers?

603
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,682
Mr. Deshraj must address the
questions that Zokkomon has raised.

604
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,548
Or else we might get into
trouble because of him.

605
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,088
Deshraj needs to clarify
all our doubts.

606
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,749
- Shut up... be quiet. -
We will not keep quiet.

607
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,453
Please stay calm.

608
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:19,637
l'm sure you all understand, first
l lost my brother and his wife...

609
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,838
... and now my darling Kunal.

610
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:30,776
How can a man who has faced
so many tragedies speak.

611
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,223
That's enough! Now l know.

612
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:52,597
Let me enlighten you'll. l went into
a deep trance and realized...

613
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,870
... this is no ordinary ghost.

614
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:03,942
There's a ghost in the mike.

615
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:23,694
There is someone who wants to prevent
Deshraj from doing good work.

616
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,541
Thus through black magic and
other dark energies...

617
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:31,636
... he has sent a dark soul in
the form of Deshraj's nephew.

618
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,072
So that you all are cheated.

619
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:49,189
But do not fear, l have
a solution to this too.

620
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:55,062
Very soon, l will perform some rites
and destroy this dark soul.

621
01:12:55,971 --> 01:13:02,206
- All hail...
- Swamidev Baba!

622
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:06,303
- Long live...
- Deshraj Kumar!

623
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:45,280
Oh Zokkomon, tell us what to do
to placate your angry soul!

624
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,406
What should we do so that
you rest in peace?

625
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:56,419
Rid yourself of all your fears and
superstitions and l will leave.

626
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:01,752
Punish scoundrels like Deshraj
for their wrong deeds...

627
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,797
... and you will not need me.

628
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:13,441
Rise and speak, break your silence.
This is all Zokkomon has to say!

629
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,086
Look, Sir, what the newspaper says.

630
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,723
ln a small town called
Jhunjhunmakadstrama ..

631
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,923
..something strange has taken place.

632
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:41,263
A ghost named Zokkomon is bringing
about a miraculous change.

633
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,835
The town folk say...

634
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,031
Deshraj and Swamidev
Baba fled that day.

635
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:51,840
We trusted them blindly.
We were wrong.

636
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,744
l was returning from the market,
a black cat crossed my path...

637
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,074
... so l stopped.

638
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,015
But then my children said let's go,
nothing will happen...

639
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,915
... so l carried on. And actually,
nothing happened!

640
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:03,283
Zokkomon has cast a spell
on all the children.

641
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,857
All they talk about is science.

642
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,153
Zokkomon is our friend!

643
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:09,230
Since Zokkomon has come,
going to school is fun.

644
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:11,195
l will do anything for Zokkomon!

645
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:15,497
lf the children praise him, then
l'm sure Zokkomon is truly great.

646
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:18,203
Because of Zokkomon, children
now want to go to school.

647
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:20,399
They are no longer afraid
of the teachers.

648
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,969
Because now the teachers
are afraid of Zokkomon.

649
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,276
l have lived all
my life in Jhunjhun..

650
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,515
..and have never witnessed
a miracle like this.

651
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:30,785
lf they had the guts, why didn't
they answer Zokkomon's questions?

652
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,376
l would like to bless Zokkomon..

653
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:33,511
.. from the bottom of my heart.

654
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,881
Long live Zokkomon!

655
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,787
Diwali is being celebrated in
Jhunjhunmakadstrama..

656
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,326
..with a new fervor.

657
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:43,989
He is a ghost! You went
ahead and killed him.

658
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:48,158
And he turned into a ghost.
You are a liar. You are a murderer.

659
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,329
- We will be ruined.
- Shut up and stop this nonsense.

660
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,235
Only l will truly celebrate Diwali.

661
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:03,875
Rani, what's wrong?

662
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:07,083
l'd enjoy it if Kunal
was alive and here.

663
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,353
l've told you a hundred times
you can't wander around like this.

664
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,200
Magic Uncle, l know Zokkomon
can't celebrate Diwali.

665
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:23,860
But Kunal wants to celebrate Diwali.
Kunal wants to play.

666
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,439
What childish nonsense.

667
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:29,840
The real Diwali is
the victory of good over evil...

668
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,209
... and that's what we're doing.
This Diwali has no meaning.

669
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:34,906
l want a home.

670
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:37,275
We have a home.

671
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:42,021
A roof over our heads...
Food to eat. Books... laboratory...

672
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,214
What else does one need!

673
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,288
l want Kitu Didi.

674
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,228
Your Kitu Didi will not come.

675
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,591
She'll come!

676
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:21,254
Without you l feel lost

677
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,927
Every moment l think of you

678
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:30,266
l can't seem to sleep

679
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:33,096
What do l do

680
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:42,414
For so long l've been alone

681
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:50,992
Every passing moment so hollow

682
01:18:53,428 --> 01:19:01,335
Every heartbeat seems to ask

683
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:10,009
Where have you gone

684
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,469
How l miss those days

685
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:39,267
And the starry nights

686
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:45,308
Every moment a beautiful memory

687
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:48,143
Your every word sweet as honey

688
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:53,350
Why is it so

689
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,516
l have to be without you

690
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:03,497
l wait for you

691
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,658
To bring back the time we shared

692
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:14,368
Hear me if you can

693
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:23,317
Come back to me

694
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:31,755
Happy Diwali, Kitu Didi!

695
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:22,436
- How far is the town from here?
- Whom do you want to meet?

696
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:25,102
He's a small boy. His name
is Kunal. Do you know him?

697
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:32,811
He is long dead. His ghost has
turned this town topsy-turvy.

698
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,090
Excuse me, do you know him?

699
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:19,799
Kunal...

700
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,132
Get up. Let's practice.

701
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:31,871
l don't want to go anywhere.
l want Kitu Didi.

702
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,509
Forget about Kitu Didi. Let's go.

703
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:49,687
Start practising.

704
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,226
Up...

705
01:22:56,638 --> 01:23:01,268
Higher.

706
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:05,903
Kitu Didi!

707
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:08,873
Kitu Didi!

708
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:17,248
Thank you, Magic Uncle.

709
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,373
- Got scared! - l'm
not afraid of anyone.

710
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,404
Good.

711
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:07,503
Then we set my uncle's pants
on fire!

712
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:13,408
Then Magic Uncle took me to a great
height from which l swooped down.

713
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:18,613
Come on Kunal, we have to
plan for tomorrow morning.

714
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:20,745
What's happening tomorrow morning?

715
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,582
l'll tell you...

716
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:29,555
Tomorrow Kunal will risk his life
again, and fight your battle for you.

717
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,555
- My battle?
- Yes, your battle.

718
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:33,558
For which you have used Kunal.

719
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,568
This is notjust between
Deshraj and me.

720
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:38,568
lt's not such a petty battle.
This is Zokkomon's battle.

721
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:40,901
The truth cannot be hidden
by noble phrases.

722
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,901
The truth is that you have
put Kunal's life in danger.

723
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,812
For the town folk, Kunal is dead.
Now you want Zokkomon to die too.

724
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:50,473
- Zokkomon cannot die. - Why?

725
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:53,577
By wearing this costume,
he stops being human?

726
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:54,745
Yes.

727
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,549
Zokkomon is not the name
of any mortal human.

728
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,550
Do you know
why Kunal became Zokkomon?

729
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:06,526
Zokkomon is the name of an idea.
lt's the name of hope!

730
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:10,327
You, me, we are all ordinary mortals
who can die. But hope never dies.

731
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,666
lt beats eternally
in the human heart.

732
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,810
That is why Zokkomon cannot die.

733
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:20,709
This town needs hope.
lt needs Zokkomon.

734
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,313
lf Zokkomon lives in the
hearts of people...

735
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:25,818
... then he will still be alive,
once Kunal goes away.

736
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,946
Tomorrow morning, Kunal
leaves with me.

737
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,060
What does he think of himself?

738
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,462
- Kitu Didi. - What?

739
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,540
- We cannot leave as yet. - What?

740
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:50,974
Magic Uncle did not force me.
l chose to become Zokkomon.

741
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:54,343
- What? - Yes. You have no idea.

742
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,345
Zokkomon has brought about change.

743
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,688
Nobody beats up my friends
now in school.

744
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,085
Children are actually learning.

745
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:07,621
People are challenging superstition.
All this is because of Zokkomon.

746
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:09,525
Living with a crazy man, you
have also turned crazy.

747
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:13,394
Biting off more than you can chew!
Come on, go and sleep.

748
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,758
Sir, l just saw Kunal walking
towards the main street.

749
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:08,144
Do not be afraid. l am not
a ghost. l am Kunal.

750
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,616
Kunal...!

751
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:23,866
l told Kitu Didi we cannot go back
as yet but she is not agreeing.

752
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,803
But Kunal, without Zokkomon things
will go back to the old days.

753
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:29,739
Zokkomon is going nowhere Arju,
only Kunal is going away.

754
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,002
Meaning?

755
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:34,448
Kitu Didi says that if Zokkomon lives
in the hearts of the children...

756
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:37,484
... then he will remain alive
even after Kunal leaves.

757
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:40,019
l may be leaving, but
you all are here.

758
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:08,896
Zokkomon!

759
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:12,606
This name has caused me
endless grief.

760
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:17,801
Now, l am going to get rid of this
Zokkomon with my own hands.

761
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:20,342
You can kill me but you
can never kill Zokkomon.

762
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,980
Show me your power, Zokkomon!
Come on!

763
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:25,984
lf you kill me a thousand Zokkomons
will take my place.

764
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,146
Go on then...
call out for Zokkomon...

765
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,194
Uncle...

766
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,375
Uncle...

767
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:38,046
Uncle, if you kill me a thousand
Zokkomons will take my place.

768
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:02,900
Please don't hurt me...

769
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:09,038
Please forgive me. l killed Kunal.

770
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:13,020
He fell down because of me.
l abandoned Kunal in the city...

771
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:15,151
... and told everyone
that he is dead.

772
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:18,019
l siphoned off his money.
l killed Kunal.

773
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:32,063
Please don't hurt me.
Please forgive me.

774
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:35,441
- Where is Kunal? -
l did not kill Kunal.

775
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:38,204
He fell down himself. Please forgive
me. l did not kill Kunal.

776
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:43,109
Please don't hurt me.
Please forgive me.

777
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:48,980
Don't hurt me.

778
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:55,189
When can we shift Kunal
to the hospital?

779
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:58,028
lt's impossible to shift
him in this condition...

780
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:01,425
... anything could happen.

781
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:19,148
l should have never
let him be Zokkomon.

782
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:23,151
He so badly wanted a home.

783
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:30,026
And l never really understood
the meaning of a home.

784
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:24,208
Kitu Didi, when will Kunal wake up?

785
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:35,026
Nothing will happen to him.

786
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:41,093
He's not Kunal, he's Zokkomon.
Zokkomon cannot die.

787
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:46,234
Zokkomon cannot die?

788
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:55,574
Zokkomon!

789
01:35:56,317 --> 01:36:03,314
Zokkomon!

790
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:05,135
Were you afraid?

791
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:10,077
Yes!

792
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,212
Kunal is fine!

793
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:25,825
Kitu Didi, Magic Uncle, l feel
l have returned home...

794
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:32,489
l have found a home.

795
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:45,177
l hope now you are convinced

796
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:48,407
You're as strong as
you believe you are!

797
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:57,619
Uncle is in jail...

798
01:39:58,325 --> 01:40:00,793
... where he's opened
another kind of school.

799
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:05,296
The town folk still run
behind Swamidev Baba...

800
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:07,263
... but to throw shoes at him.

801
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:13,432
The haunted house is now
the most wanted house.

802
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:15,741
No one is afraid of it anymore.

803
01:40:17,544 --> 01:40:23,414
The people of Jhunjhunmakadstrama
have a new passion: science.

804
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:28,644
Magic Uncle and Kitu Didi
still don't see eye to eye.

805
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:31,856
But we are a happy family!

806
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:37,388
But most importantly, it's the
children who have changed forever.

807
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,223
Every child
in the town has become...

808
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:42,229
Zokkomon!
