1
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:34,068
EVERY HOUSE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM.

2
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:12,402
What is this painting about?

3
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:15,375
Not sure!
But it seems like someone is lost at sea.

4
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:17,492
There is a ship also dude.

5
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:19,190
Yeah dude.

6
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:21,870
Hey, this painting is
beyond my understanding.

7
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,838
Let's see the next one.

8
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:26,924
Hey your Anitha, right!

9
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:28,306
Yeah.

10
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:29,819
So what is this painting about?

11
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:33,484
It is the story of a young sailor.

12
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,678
He has no clue about
his final destination.

13
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,315
And this is the reason he
is stuck in a thunderstorm.

14
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:41,261
Oh!

15
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,241
Then, did he reach the shore?

16
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,998
Uh! Uh! I don't think so.

17
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,918
I believe, he is lost forever.

18
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:01,446
<i>I am the lost sailor in Anitha's painting!</i>

19
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:02,976
<i>My name is Kishore.</i>

20
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,235
<i>It's been a year since
I finished my B.Tech.</i>

21
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:09,184
<i>Most of my classmates are settled.</i>

22
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:11,801
<i>But I am with my parents in my hometown.</i>

23
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:15,582
<i>This is not something I am
doing this early morning.</i>

24
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,497
<i>I didn't sleep all night.</i>

25
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,426
<i>Working on my new project.</i>

26
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,478
<i>I am constructing a robotic vehicle.</i>

27
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:23,368
<i>Completely autonomous.</i>

28
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:25,955
<i>It manoeuvres avoiding obstacles.</i>

29
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:27,046
<i>I am just finishing it.</i>

30
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,503
Kishore, it is morning!

31
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,061
Will you come out of your room?

32
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,574
<i>There you go, my mom.</i>

33
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:42,412
<i>She loves me a lot
since I am the only son.</i>

34
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:45,538
<i>Hey Kishore, why don't you answer?</i>

35
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,566
What is the matter?

36
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,792
Did he brush his teeth?

37
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:53,066
<i>And this is my dad, tiger!</i>

38
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:55,004
<i>All this while he
hasn't been happy because</i>

39
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,337
<i>things didn't happen the way he expected.</i>

40
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:03,409
<i>All Indian guys who graduate
have only one question, what's next?</i>

41
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:07,158
<i>Some families insist on a
job and some on doing IAS.</i>

42
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:08,674
<i>And few others advise an MBA.</i>

43
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,311
<i>And these are the expectation set on us.</i>

44
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:13,928
<i>For people like me, it's like
when is this guy going to America?</i>

45
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:18,162
Kishore, did you get a visa
to America at least this time?

46
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,959
<i>My family has double expectations for me.</i>

47
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:27,113
<i>With all the cousins going to
America, the pressure on me</i>

48
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:30,389
<i>is like 'Crap! Feels as if
I am in a pressure cooker'.</i>

49
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,867
[pressure cooker hissing]

50
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,454
How long did you take...

51
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,044
Here take it. I'll give this to your dad.

52
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:39,269
-Oh! For Tiger!
<i>-Get a dozen eggs.</i>

53
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:40,282
<i>Alright.</i>

54
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,337
-Hi Kishore,
-Hi Dude.

55
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,535
You seem so happy.
I guess you got your visa.

56
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,695
Why should you know? Give me a dozen eggs.

57
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:53,767
<i>Did I ask your property?</i>

58
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:55,689
Here take the eggs.

59
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,555
I did not get this time
either. It got rejected.

60
00:05:58,755 --> 00:05:59,955
Why don't you apply for
the 3rd time, it's lucky.

61
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,182
You will get it for sure, I guarantee you.

62
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:06,204
Hey, come along we will play
cards near the Maisamma temple.

63
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,816
Stop it!

64
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:10,643
You visit the Chilukuru Balaji temple
and you will definitely get a visa.

65
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:12,707
-Go. Get lost.
-Hey, come let's play cards.

66
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,090
Brother-in-law,
trust me and go to Balaji

67
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,992
temple and you will
definitely get your visa.

68
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,955
He is not your brother-in-law,
he will not get it. You keep calm.

69
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:19,752
-You say so?
-Yeah.

70
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:21,279
We are not at all related.

71
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:23,311
Hey, look at Trump's
<i>daughter how gorgeous she is.</i>

72
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,813
<i>Split on my life!	</i>

73
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:27,594
<i>Even the boys in the gully like
Mogli and Satti are commenting on me.</i>

74
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:30,431
So sad!
Heard that your visa got rejected again.

75
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:31,312
So what will you do now?

76
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,094
It's better people
mind their own business.

77
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,225
-Oh!
-My time is running badly.

78
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,509
<i>Even the aunty who doesn't know where to
dump the trash is asking about my visa.</i>

79
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,137
-Did you get it...
-Take it.

80
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,638
Why is everyone so interested in me?

81
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,629
Everyone is asking me about the visa.

82
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:47,757
Jobless people!

83
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:51,176
It is their wish too that
Narayan's son should go to America.

84
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,256
They are waiting for it.

85
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:55,867
They are wishing you good.

86
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,185
<i>It is because of my dad that
everyone knows about this.</i>

87
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,858
<i>That I am applying for my visa.</i>

88
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:05,862
Do you see any young guy around here?

89
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:07,265
I told you I will get bored.

90
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:09,220
-You got me here unnecessarily.
-Why will be they be here?

91
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:11,646
All the guys of your
age are settled in the US.

92
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:14,171
I am sure you will be there next year.

93
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:15,998
You will no longer be
annoyed by these occasions.

94
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:19,520
Kishore,
I heard your visa got rejected again.

95
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:22,524
Why don't you work at a
call centre until you get it?

96
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,138
-Thanks for the advice uncle.
-Okay!

97
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:30,822
<i>Be it any occasion in the
town, everyone is after me.</i>

98
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:31,874
<i>Hell with this people.</i>

99
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:40,588
Mom, if I am here everyone
will keep asking me about my visa.

100
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:41,640
When I will leave for America.

101
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,885
They question me again and again,

102
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:44,176
'so when are you going to try again'.

103
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,601
I can't take this
anymore. I won't stay here.

104
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,359
I will... dad, I will go to Hyderabad.

105
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:53,607
I will stay there and
get the visa somehow.

106
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,631
"This guy is leaving his hometown
and going to the city in a bus,"

107
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:01,206
"look at the strange difficulties"

108
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,163
-"It's not that normal"
<i>-Since my childhood,</i>

109
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:07,053
<i>my father raised me to be in America.</i>

110
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:08,904
This is America... This is New York.

111
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,141
Here your uncle and aunt
live and their children.

112
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,975
One drives a BMW while the
other drives an AUDI car.

113
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:17,426
-This is Atlanta.
-Atlanta.

114
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:19,662
Another uncle and aunt
and their is their son.

115
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:22,552
-He is studying at Georgia Tech. Get it?
-Yes.

116
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,918
This is Chicago. Here all your
mother's side relatives stay.

117
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:29,192
She is... Hey is your aunt still alive?

118
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:30,528
<i>She has passed away long back.</i>

119
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:32,997
She has passed away it seems...
We don't need this picture anymore.

120
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,822
So tell me now, where will you stay?

121
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,099
Here? Here!

122
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,696
You should travel all over... okay?

123
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,283
You should roam all over, okay? Good.

124
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,772
Chandu,
tell me the names of some rivers...

125
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,470
Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Krishna, Sir.

126
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,037
Very good. Sit down.

127
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,074
Kishore, name some states...

128
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:55,636
New York, California, Texas, Florida.

129
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,978
Hey Britisher, tell me about
Indian states, not American states.

130
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:04,351
<i>While all my friends took up a job through
campus selection after B.Tech, I did not.</i>

131
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:07,411
<i>He opined that I will stay back
in India if I took up any job.</i>

132
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,425
<i>My dad didn't let me attend any interview.</i>

133
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:12,904
<i>To state the truth, going to
Hyderabad is like an escape for me.</i>

134
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,829
<i>From that world of expectations.</i>

135
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:18,786
"Seeing you she keeps her eyes open"

136
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:24,246
"Or even to make the aunty's close
her mouth who stays beside my house"

137
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:27,680
VILLAGE LIGHT
"Go boy, go on fly in the sky"

138
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,895
"To make your father proud"

139
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:33,232
"Go boy, go on fly in the sky"

140
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:35,890
"Why do you panic?"

141
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:39,513
"You... hey you!"

142
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,408
<i>Chandu and Pavan are my college mates.</i>

143
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,397
<i>It is unbelievable
that they are living here.</i>

144
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:47,912
<i>I am sure they have
changed a lot over time.</i>

145
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,585
Show me your biceps now
that you are going to the gym.

146
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,188
-Look man, look here.
-Hey, hi guys!

147
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,250
-Hi, Kishore.
-Hey Kishore...

148
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,608
Hey, my throat!

149
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:57,689
Hey, my throat, careful,
the bag has glass jars.

150
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:00,830
-Oh god!
-Your are just like a cucumber.

151
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,890
[laughs]
-Hey, get up guys.

152
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,348
Hey, come dude.
No need to go to home,

153
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,594
-will go from here itself.
-Come on, we will have a party.

154
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,250
<i>Only after meeting them, I realized
that they haven't changed a bit.</i>

155
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:12,136
Hey, Chandu wait... You look
like you are selling hair wigs.

156
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:16,740
9,998, 9,999...

157
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,115
10,000...

158
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,257
Hey Kishore, when is your visa interview?

159
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,485
-It's next week... Wednesday.
-Okay.

160
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,754
-4...
-By the way, what is he up to?

161
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:31,090
-It's his new fantasy.
-6...

162
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,005
When your father is sending you money...

163
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:34,319
Why don't you sit at home happily?

164
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,807
What is this underwear modelling job?

165
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,958
I have only one ambition in my life.

166
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:42,307
That my hoarding should
be all over Hyderabad.

167
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,723
And all the guys and girls
should be amazed to see me.

168
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,029
<i>They should think, "Wow! What a model!"</i>

169
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:49,589
Oh!

170
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:52,130
If I have a father like
you who sends money,

171
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,304
"I will leave this gaming designer job."

172
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:58,584
And I'll cross my legs, read the
newspaper, drink tea and enjoy my life!

173
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:00,991
Aren't you doing the same now!

174
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:05,208
-You are out...
-No, no it's not an out.

175
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:06,637
-Check yourself...
-Good morning.

176
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:07,242
Good morning!

177
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:08,912
-How is the weather?
-It is a snowstorm.

178
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:10,692
-So it must be cold.
-Yeah.

179
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:14,195
It is so hot here in Hyderabad,
and you are talking about snow?

180
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:15,745
We are talking about Chicago.

181
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,325
His son lives there.

182
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:18,379
-Chicago?
-Yes.

183
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:19,939
-The one in America?
-Yeah.

184
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,088
Haha... Sir, it's too much.

185
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,486
Hey, clean it... here too...

186
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,816
clean the tank...

187
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,379
Make this bike shine like a new one.

188
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:34,077
-By the way, how much does spinach cost?
-3 dollars.

189
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,640
-Oh! Is it so expensive?
-Yes...

190
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,534
-It is only for two dollars in Texas.
-Is it?

191
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:40,006
Everything is cheap there.
There is no sales tax right.

192
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:40,970
-Is it?
-Yes...

193
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,001
My son is in California and the
living standard is very costly.

194
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,279
I should ask my son to move to Texas.

195
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,018
What is wrong with
everyone in these apartments?

196
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,746
They talk only about America!

197
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,626
All these apartments
have been bought by NRI's

198
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,799
and all their parents live here.

199
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,272
All the time you will
only get to hear about America.

200
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:57,044
<i>Hey, what is this?</i>

201
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:59,772
You are making a
child clean your bike?

202
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:00,838
<i>Do you even have a brain?</i>

203
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,268
-What is your name?
-Munna, sister.

204
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:05,779
Munna, don't you ever clean bikes, okay?

205
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:06,690
Okay, sister.

206
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,107
Are you not ashamed?
Do you even have a brain?

207
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,911
Hey, who are you?

208
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:15,695
-Why are you scolding my friend?
-Oh! You are all one batch?

209
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,613
-Are you even educated?
-What happened man?

210
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:21,290
What is your problem?
Why are you creating a scene here?

211
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,329
Your friend is making a child work.

212
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,235
Don't you know that
child labour is a crime?

213
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:27,790
I'll report it to the police, next time.

214
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,113
Madam, we are sorry,
it won't happen next time.

215
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,583
-Alright?
-Okay!

216
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:34,262
Make your friends
understand this and have some sense.

217
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:38,094
Oh my God,
who is this troublesome girl?

218
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:39,921
-Where does she lives?
-How do I know?

219
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,671
-Hey, what is your name?
-Munna bro...

220
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:44,480
Don't work like this for
money. Go and study well.

221
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:45,711
-Okay?
-Sure, brother.

222
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:46,343
Go now...

223
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,560
Bloody hell! Where do
these guys come from?

224
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,249
<i>What happened dear?</i>

225
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:54,841
<i>Whom did you fight with today?</i>

226
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:55,567
[sighs]

227
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:58,632
Dad, someone is making a small child work.

228
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,455
Why do they rent
the apartments to bachelors?

229
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,152
What happened dear?

230
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:03,572
Did someone trouble you?

231
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:04,793
I hope no you are fine.

232
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:06,496
Are you silly? What can happen to her?

233
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:08,405
Did anyone ever win over her?

234
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:09,928
-Hmm...
-Dad.

235
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,401
-I am just saying.
-My dear, come here, sit.

236
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:14,724
Anitha...

237
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:18,101
Why do you want to get
into a fight and all?

238
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:19,320
You are my sweet daughter.

239
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,703
Look at these pictures once,

240
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:24,098
You are getting very good
NRI alliances for marriage.

241
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:25,070
Did you like anyone?

242
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:29,830
Hmm, yes I like this car,
this house, and this bike!

243
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,579
I asked you about the boys
and not the cars or houses.

244
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,072
Find out if the boy comes
free with the car or house.

245
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:38,096
<i>You won't change!</i>

246
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:40,931
Keep painting, teaching
here and there for free.

247
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:42,784
You won't get married if
you keep doing social service.

248
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,769
And here you are quiet as a lamb.

249
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:47,314
<i>Here, here, stop...</i>

250
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:48,871
Thank god!

251
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:00,858
Careful... careful

252
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:02,330
This is all from America.

253
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,927
Look there,
the flowers have bloomed so well.

254
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,242
Watchman, watchman...

255
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,352
He is never around when in need.

256
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:18,856
By the way, the watchman's son
was supposed to join in engineering,

257
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,727
I guess he got into the course by now,

258
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,821
It smells so bad and dirty,
India will not get tidy in this birth.

259
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:26,131
I heard Trump is building a wall...

260
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,119
What do you think the height will be?

261
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:28,208
Aunty, do you need any help?

262
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:29,547
Thank you, the watchman will come.

263
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,518
I wonder where he is
and when he'll come.

264
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,147
These suitcases are very
heavy. Please help us!

265
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:35,011
Pick those two.

266
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:35,950
Watchman!

267
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,357
-Which is your flat, aunty?
-705, son.

268
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:39,603
-Watchman.
-Ours is 604.

269
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:44,240
Watchman...

270
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:48,500
Is he dead?

271
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,079
-Aunty, are you coming from America?
-Yes!

272
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,039
Both my sons live in America.

273
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,407
-We are just back after a visit.
-I see.

274
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:59,020
My first son is in Microsoft,
he graduated from Texas university.

275
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,047
Scored very high in GRE.

276
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:04,875
-From where you dear?
-I am from 'Cdiypet'!

277
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:07,161
-C..di..petu?
-Siddipet, uncle.

278
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:08,237
-Oh!
-Siddipet?

279
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,881
-My second son is with IBM...
-Oh!

280
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:11,054
-in Atlanta.
-I see.

281
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:12,781
-Oh! Even my friend is going to America.
-Oh! Good.

282
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:13,818
He has his visa interview next week.

283
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,739
What do you do? Software, something.

284
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:18,277
-I just roam around freely!
-Ah!

285
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:20,833
Come on Uncle.

286
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:23,305
Thank God, power is there.

287
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:23,954
One minute.

288
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:26,086
-Ok, we shall leave now.
-Bye aunty.

289
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:28,460
-Wait, take some chocolates.
-Oh! No aunty, it's okay.

290
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,490
-It's okay.
-It is okay. Take it.

291
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,355
It is all so dusty.

292
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,386
Take it.

293
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,062
-Thank you, aunty.
-Thank you, aunty.

294
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,247
Hey, give it to me.

295
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,322
-Hey.
-Get lost.

296
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:40,584
Won't you change a bit?

297
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,338
The gas is not there. If I book it now,

298
00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:45,512
I wonder when he'll deliver.

299
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:47,747
Should I buy it in black or something!

300
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:50,980
It was so nice to spend
time with our children there.

301
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:53,991
The joy we get is so precious.

302
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,073
I cannot go about these
trips to America anymore.

303
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:06,799
I wish that our children
stayed with us here in India.

304
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:07,851
India?

305
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,887
Huh! The youngsters in India
have no goal or destination.

306
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,945
Neither they have the
determination to achieve something.

307
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:15,366
Look at our children.

308
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:18,341
They are so determined.
They are well settled in America.

309
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,315
We should be proud of them.

You still have three
hours to your interview.

313

you are not giving the right answers.

-Okay.

344
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:14,194
I go, take picture with car, send photo...

345
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:14,836
You know...

346
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:17,175
I get one crore dowry!

347
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,144
So how about your parents?
Who will take care of them?

348
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:22,336
-We will talk on face time...
-Okay.

349
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,360
if they fall sick they go to hospital.

350
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,714
I send money every month, after
marriage, they come for delivery!

351
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:28,827
Okay!

352
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:30,232
Good luck!

353
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:31,787
Thank you!

354
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:34,235
<i>Thank God, she approved my visa!</i>

355
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:37,070
<i>Thank God,
she is approving everyone's visa.</i>

356
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:46,645
Cake ready!

357
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:48,809
The cake looks as colorful as you!

358
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,335
It tastes good too,

359
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:56,257
"Kishore will come this
day, he will come anyway..."

360
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,990
-Hey...
-Hurray.

361
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,737
-Congratulations!
-Hey, stop it.

362
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,644
Oh no! Hey, what happened?

363
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,079
So, Mr. Kishore...

364
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,754
Which university are you going to study?

365
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,010
Michigan.

366
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,596
Can I see your I 20, please?

367
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:18,892
Yes, one second.

368
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:22,830
-One second madam.
-Hmm, okay.

369
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:29,613
So, why do you want to study in the US?

370
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,803
Cause it's my dad's dream.

371
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:36,170
He always wanted me to go to
the US and pursue my Master's.

372
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,342
Hmm...

373
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:43,333
Your visa is rejected.

374
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,031
Sorry! Maybe next time.

375
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:54,105
Hey, miser.
He did not get his visa approved.

376
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:56,382
Hmm, the cake might get wasted.

377
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:57,853
[phone rings]

378
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,519
Dad, I just got back from the embassy.

379
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,071
-Are you always worried about food?
-What happened is...

380
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,782
Eat, rub it on your face.

381
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:09,947
What happened?

382
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,420
His visa is rejected again.

383
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:19,509
Madam, what happened?

384
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,053
-His visa is rejected again.
[gasps]

385
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:26,135
Oh! My God, why did this happen again?

386
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:33,150
So what do you mean to say?

387
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:36,206
All those working in Indian
software companies are useless?

388
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,732
No, I don't say that. You should come
to my house and see it for yourself.

389
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,272
If I go to my town without a visa,

390
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,268
I'll have to fly kites.

391
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,301
To get a visa for America
is like a lottery.

392
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,996
You never know who will win.
It is not easy to win a lottery ticket.

393
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,055
It is not easy to win a lottery ticket.

394
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:52,343
Sambaiah in my village,

395
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,585
never got lucky with lottery
tickets. Not even one time.

396
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,373
Hey, don't talk nonsense without
knowing what we are talking about.

397
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,694
Just as he said,
it is like winning a lottery ticket.

398
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:06,871
I worked hard for GRE, TOFEL,
got admission in a good college.

399
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:08,705
In spite of all this, they issue a
visa to every other person but not me.

400
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:11,469
That Shiva passed all his
exams copying from my papers.

401
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:12,460
Even that fellow got a visa.

402
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,040
What is with this GRE score?

403
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,093
Shit man!

404
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:19,591
When a student visa get rejected
so many times, I can't get it again.

405
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:21,680
Chandu, I have to do something else.

406
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,298
Pavan, what are you up to?

407
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:28,511
I auditioned for Calvin
Klein and I am almost through...

408
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,438
Which one, American or
the Sultan Bazaar one?

409
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:33,955
Oh! You know well about fashion.

410
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,682
Here she is, Anita...

411
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,830
-Come dear, sit.
-Come dear...

412
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,287
I heard that you paint well...

413
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:46,652
Did you sell any?

414
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,955
No aunty... As of now, it is just a hobby.

415
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,177
Oh! It's her pastime.

416
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:52,431
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

417
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,055
Please stand up. Let's see.

418
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,334
Her height is a bit short sister-in-law.

419
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:06,528
So what are you planning
to do after your B.Tech?

420
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:08,799
I am planning to take
up a job in software.

421
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,064
Oh! Sister-in-law,

422
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:15,333
Our Swati who is an M.Tech,
did not take up any job after marriage.

423
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:18,196
We can't expect everyone to raise
their children properly now a days.

424
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:20,526
We shall take leave now.

425
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,433
Good.

426
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:27,664
How dare they talk like
that about my daughter.

427
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,209
What do they know about my Anita.

428
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:31,074
She is good in studies,
painting, art and craft...

429
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:32,891
Is there anyone like my daughter?

430
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,794
I am getting angry thinking about that...

431
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:38,111
How can they talk like that?

432
00:22:38,211 --> 00:22:39,722
Yeah, what was the thing you did?

433
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:43,780
You were after her marriage.

434
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:46,427
You don't have to worry
about her marriage at all.

435
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,010
Stop going after the 'American' alliance.

436
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:52,821
I am sure a good
guy will come looking for her.

437
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:54,271
I am telling this remember this...

438
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,094
-No girl will flicker at us...
-Oh, study.

439
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,652
At least let that tube
light flicker at us...

440
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:05,234
Do you have to fix something or the other?

441
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,348
-Hey!
-Don't slap me on my face.

442
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:09,408
Uncle is coming...

443
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:11,159
Why are they staring at us?

444
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:15,817
[car honks]

445
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:20,355
Look Doctor,
guys in India keep loitering in the night.

446
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:23,810
They aways waste their time.
They don't have discipline.

447
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,440
Doctor, my kids never wasted their time.

448
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,184
They were so inclined in studies.

449
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:30,403
-It's all about parenting.
-You are right!

450
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:31,753
Get in the car.

451
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:34,869
Greetings uncle, did you meet Trump?

452
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:35,994
Hey... you will die man!

453
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:38,266
Bye uncle.

454
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:41,665
Hey, where is Texas university?

455
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:43,273
-Don't you know?
-Don't you know?

456
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:44,603
-He will say.
-I'll tell you.

457
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,693
-While going to Charminar...
-Yeah!

458
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,190
There is a bangles shop at
Gowliguda Chaman, right?

459
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:49,912
Yeah, there is one.

460
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:53,479
-There it is in the beside street.
[laughing]

461
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:02,465
Hi.

462
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:04,008
-Hi!
-Can I meet Jeevan Reddy?

463
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,096
-He is inside. Please go.
-Thank you. Let's go.

464
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:11,649
-Why are you standing here?
-You go, I'll come.

465
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,321
-Ah... Hi...
-Hi.

466
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,943
-Me, myself Pavan.
<i>-I am Tanya</i>

467
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:19,880
<i>Nice name.</i>

468
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:29,192
Look there.

469
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,628
Hey, I don't think this will work out.

470
00:24:31,828 --> 00:24:34,300
You have no work
experience. How can he get you a visa?

471
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,804
Stop nagging always...

472
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:38,387
-Hi Praneet... how are you?
-Hello Sir.

473
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:40,319
-I got my visa for America.
-Very good.

474
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:43,279
I am leaving for Kansas next week.
Than you sir, it is all because of you.

475
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,419
-Oh! You brought Motichoor Ladoo...
-Yes sir.

476
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,328
-Thank you!
-Okay.

477
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:50,038
What's up, Kishore...

478
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,677
Ramesh uncle has called me about you.

479
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,754
You don't worry at all,
you will go to America.

480
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,899
Look there, H1B visa.

481
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,277
All our guys are in America.

482
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:59,700
Sir, but I don't have any work experience.

483
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,723
[laughs]
What's with experience?

484
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:03,811
Look here, Narayana... not him.

485
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:06,550
This guy Ganesh has
only one year experience.

486
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:09,016
But we tweaked his resume and
showed an experience of six years.

487
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,016
These Americans are innocent.

488
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:13,613
They believe whatever
is written in the papers.

489
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,806
Many people went there just like this.

490
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:17,985
You just have to learn
some new technical terms.

491
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,525
What is the latest trend these days?

492
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:22,378
-Big data... Mule soft...
-Big data... Mule soft...

493
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:24,078
-That's it...
-What do you say?

494
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:27,104
-Will this all happen with-in a week?
-What do you think Kishore?

495
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:30,027
Is this an order on Swiggy
to be delivered in one hour?

496
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:31,519
This is about your job,
it will take a month or so.

497
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,836
I will confirm a job in
Metro apps, California.

498
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,545
Then you can apply for your H1 visa.

499
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,921
What say. Here you go.

500
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:39,041
Meet Mr. Srinivas.

501
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:40,364
-He will explain everything to you.
-Hello sir.

502
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:41,388
You don't worry.

503
00:25:41,588 --> 00:25:43,176
You are in big professional hands.

504
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,230
-Okay.
-Okay?

505
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,199
Hey, Beard! have some biscuits.

506
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:49,187
Looking at your friend,
I am sure he will go to Dubai.

507
00:25:49,387 --> 00:25:50,153
Dubai is correct for you,

508
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:51,084
-I will send you there.
-Hey, no sir.

509
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,939
[laughs]
-Srinivas, explain him.

510
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:53,539
Sure sir.

511
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,693
Sir, let me walk you
through the entire process.

512
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:57,011
These are the documents required.

513
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,680
[voice muted]

514
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:01,472
What more, I am sure you will get a visa.

515
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:04,047
You will go to America and
I will call you from India

516
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:06,988
and over the call you'll say, 'Hey
Chandu! I am at Florida beach'.

517
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:11,448
'I am drinking beer with
babes in bikini on either side.'

518
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:12,378
-Isn't it.
-Yes dude.

519
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:26,858
"We've kicked you our of your sleep,
we've ironed your clothes"

520
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:30,617
"We've passed notes for you in your exams,
yeah!"

521
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:35,284
"We've danced in
stranger's weddings! Yeah!"

522
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:40,357
"Don't know whether you'd
remember us once you fly!"

523
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,697
"Oh dude! My friend!
Don't forget our friendship"

524
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:49,326
"Oh dude! My friend!
We'll add up likes to your photos"

525
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:54,015
"Oh dude! My friend!
Send us bucks to booze"

526
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:08,829
"We've done some real nasty
and naughty things at places"

527
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:13,471
"We've went places with friends,
peed into tanks"

528
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:18,130
"We've been a menace at different
places and troubled people"

529
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,688
"We've danced weird and
flew kites and cut a few"

530
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:26,978
"Do the same things there too!"

531
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:31,256
"Oh dude! My friend!
Fetch a good job there"

532
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:35,945
"Oh dude! My friend!
Don't fal behind bikini clad girls"

533
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:40,616
"Oh dude! My friend!
Bring back some good money with you"

534
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:45,654
"You aren't any less than anyone nor
you need to fear any damn person"

535
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:50,305
"There's no lack of girls there,
no one is better than us"

536
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:54,915
"The birds there are agressive, watch out!
Check out the flies around"

537
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:59,719
"Water there is cotlier than sodas,
be careful not to make a mistake"

538
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,996
"Oh yeah!"

539
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:14,022
"You'd fly emirates from rags,
drive in costly cars"

540
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:18,738
"You'd check out Chicago
and dance at costly pubs"

541
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:23,341
"Drink pricey liquor at trendy places"

542
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:28,005
"Change your eating habits
and your favourite sport too"

543
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:32,065
"And then spend all your
earnings in Las Vegas"

544
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:36,497
"Oh dude! My friend!
Don't do idiotic things!"

545
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:41,133
"Oh dude! My friend! Don't ruin yourself"

546
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,903
"Oh dude! My friend!
Send us some trendy clothes"

547
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:00,913

[doorbell rings]

549
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:14,577
The committee has called in for a meeting.

550
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:17,252
Everyone should attend, come soon.

551
00:29:18,827 --> 00:29:20,052
Yes, come boys, come.

552
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:22,870
Guys of this generation are
neither led by education nor manners.

553
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:25,540
-Who is Sandhya?
-I guess it is her!

554
00:29:26,116 --> 00:29:27,867
Their jobs are
substandard but behave flamboyantly.

555
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,800
Otherwise why will they get fully drunk?

556
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:31,828
And these guys have full
grown beard and moustaches...

557
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:33,177
-Nonsense.
-Shall we get started.

558
00:29:33,415 --> 00:29:35,011
Boys, you are the main issue here.

559
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,593
We've received a complaint against you.

560
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:39,657
It has come to our notice about
what you did to Anitha and Latha.

561
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:42,190
There are harassment charges against you.

562
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,796
-What?
-Harassment?

563
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,023
Cheers!

564
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:49,661

daughter-in-law, Golla Mallamma"

[knocks on door]

566
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,331
Hey, someone is at the door. Go check...

567
00:29:53,848 --> 00:29:55,353
[knocks on door]

568
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:57,294
Oh! It's you.

569
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,643
Did you come to have a argument again?

570
00:29:58,868 --> 00:29:59,871
So whom do you want to scold this time?

571
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,527
I have exams and I am studying.

572
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,255
For that do you have to
knock the door and tell us?

573
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:05,959
[giggles]
-I guess she needs chits.

574
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,532
Yuck! Aren't you ashamed.

575
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,302
How should I ready
when you are making fuss?

576
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:12,026
-Do you know what is the time now?
-I don't know.

577
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,351
It is 12:30, it's past midnight.

578
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:16,863
If you know the time,
why are you asking us?

579
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,132
Chill, just go home,
drink cerelac and sleep well.

580
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,461
Get up early in the morning and
study you will remember better.

581
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:22,144
Yes, dude.

582
00:30:22,244 --> 00:30:24,724
-Hey, do you have an exam in Database?
-Hey, very is my beer?

583
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,915
-Did you go through Query Optimisation?
-Yes.

584
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:29,651
It's a very important topic.
That question comes every time.

585
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:32,672
Hey stop it dude. I have a doubt.

586
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:36,159
Are you really getting
disturbed or just following us?

587
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,580
Huh, you think your are so worth it?

588
00:30:39,082 --> 00:30:41,148
-Why not?
-Now?

589
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:44,872
What is happening?
Hey, are these guys troubling you?

590
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,373
Tell me who that is?

591
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:49,083
-Who is this girl?
-I think daughter-in-law of Golla Mallamma

592
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:50,710
You are not the kind to
listen when told properly.

593
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,794
Wait and watch what I'll do tomorrow.

594
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:53,799
This is not the way to deal with these
guys, let's take care of them tomorrow.

595
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,165
Let's go now.

596
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,356
Angry Birds!

597
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:04,884
Did I ever tell that you look very
sexy when you make that monkey face?

598
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:06,115
[laughs]

599
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,051
Let's go inside,
you don't know how to open the door.

600
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:12,044
Actually this can be a police case.

601
00:31:13,157 --> 00:31:14,999
But thinking about your future,

602
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,601
so the committee has decide that
you vacate the apartment immediately.

603
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:21,230
What is happening here?

604
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:22,894
Can anyone explain us?

605
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,468
We received a complaint that
you guys physically teased...

606
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:26,966
-...Anitha and Lata yesterday.
-Why will we harass?

607
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,727
-These are all cooked up stories.
[gasps]

608
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,866
She is unnecessarily trapping us.

609
00:31:31,132 --> 00:31:32,979
But how can you take a decision just
by listing to one side of the story?

610
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:35,988
That is not done uncle, you should
give us a chance to explain as well.

611
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,145
-What would you want to listen?
-Listen...

612
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:39,793
tell us whatever you want
in a straight forward manner.

613
00:31:39,993 --> 00:31:41,760
Nothing like that
uncle, actually Anitha...

614
00:31:44,814 --> 00:31:46,996
Anitha, please wait outside for some time.

615
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:48,219
We will call you again.

616
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:51,944
Oh God! What is this?
Why should I wait outside?

617
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:52,610
Please...

618
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:59,722
Latha, please tell us what happened
yesterday wihout getting scared of anyone.

619
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,988
Yesterday on the seventh
floor, Kishore and Chandu...

620
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:04,529
...teased Anitha by pinching her waist.

621
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:07,962
-Okay uncle, now call Anitha and ask her.
-Anitha...

622
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,384
Anitha please tell us what happened.

623
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:17,830
What happened yesterday is... Kishore held
Latha's hand firmly and pulled her hair.

624
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:19,074
Oh!

625
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:20,350
-Are you sure?
-Did you listen uncle?

626
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:22,399
Was it really Kishore who teased Latha?

627
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,727
Err... yes, sure uncle.

628
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,270
-It was Kishore who teased Latha.
-Okay.

629
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:30,145
Then nobody teased you?

630
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,112
Uh! Uh! No uncle, nobody teased me.

631
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:36,430
Hmm...

632
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:38,284
-What else?
-Hmm...

633
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:41,236
-Oh no!
-I think we all would have understood.

634
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,315
And it's totally a waste
of time to prolong this.

635
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:45,683
Sorry boys, the charges are baseless.

636
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:47,386
You may leave now.

637
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:49,941
Why did you say that?

638
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:52,820
Will you all leave them just like
that? Won't you say anything?

639
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:54,942
Anitha,

640
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:59,340
do you know that harassment
case can turn into a criminal case?

641
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,810
It is not right to
play the fool with guys.

642
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:04,430
Take care.

643
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:08,521
By the way,
who will fall for this short girl?

644
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,622
Does she think that she is very beautiful?

645
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:18,103
Please do not judge a girls
beauty by her skin color or height.

646
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,449
[phone rings]
[gasps]

647
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:43,528
It is her again.

648
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:46,969
Hmm...

649
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:49,750
I think I've seen you before.

650
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:53,210
Yes, I remember you.

651
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,732
You are the one who spoke really fast.

652
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:59,032
How did you get this
three year experience?

653
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,405
-Ma'am I can explain you.
-When did you graduate?

654
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:03,421
When did you graduate?

655
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:08,818
Clearly Kishore,
you've submitted wrong documents.

656
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:10,879
-You're cheating.
-Ma'am, ma'am, I am sorry.

657
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,566
You visa is rejected.

658
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,204
And you cannot apply
to the US for one year.

659
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:17,875
Take it and leave.

660
00:34:20,328 --> 00:34:20,976
Next...

661
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:34,395
-Drive carefully.
-Hey, hey which way are you going?

662
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,832
Drive properly.

663
00:34:40,189 --> 00:34:43,298
-Hey, hey, are you going to die?
-Hey, have you informed at home?

664
00:34:44,364 --> 00:34:45,391
Hey, stop it, stop it dude!

665
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:54,705
Damn! Why should the same
lady be in the embassy?

666
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:56,660
Why should she remember me?

667
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,242
My bad luck!

668
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:02,108
Looks like all the bad luck of the
world in sitting right on my head.

669
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,645
What should I do when I am not allowed
to apply for visa for another year?

670
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:06,428
Shit.

671
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:13,636
Hey shall we put up a business?

672
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,994
Underwear business.
It's a fetching business.

673
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:18,223
Hey,
is this some kind of a joke?

674
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:21,277
You wanted to be an
underwear model and you are one.

675
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,909
My father has drawn a line which I've no
other option except to follow it blindly.

676
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:31,320
Dude.

677
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,006
Is there any rule to
follow what parents say?

678
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:41,756
My father used to drop me to GRE classes
and wait for me until the class was over.

679
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:42,503
Do you know that?

680
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:46,241
I cannot disappoint him.

00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:51,575
[birds chirping]

682
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,223
It is fine, my son if you did not get it.

683
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:07,330
What is wrong now? You will get it soon.

684
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,547
You don't worry at all.

685
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:12,550
Oh! My gosh, you did not get your visa...

686
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:15,398
Chukamma, don't cry.

687
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:16,912
I will get the visa next time.

688
00:36:17,112 --> 00:36:18,175
Go put the bags inside,

689
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:18,880
go...

690
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,301
-What is this mom?
-She is crazy...

691
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,507
Hey Kishore..
Heard your visa is rejected again.

692
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:26,422
So let's go and play
cards near Maisamma temple.

693
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,660
-Ah?
-Hey, no...

694
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,455
Hey, leave him. I will come.

695
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:31,448
Will you get me toddy?

696
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:33,158
Yes, sure.

697
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,531
-Who is that guy?
-Which kind of toddy can you give me?

698
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:36,693
Don't know dude, let's go,
otherwise he will come along.

699
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:38,399
Hey wait, I am coming.

700
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:40,285
-Wait a minute.
-Yeah, take him he will be suitable.

701
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,465
-Aunty.
-Hmm?

702
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:48,282
Masala daal and the
tamarind soup is very delicious.

703
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:52,022
Here taste this pickle of
grated mango made by aunty.

704
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:53,260
It is very delicious.

705
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,153
-Pavan, do you want some more?
-No uncle, that was enough...

706
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:55,999
Yes, please uncle.

707
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,795
-So what work do you do?
-Modelling uncle.

708
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:02,651
-Oh! You make models?
-No uncle.

709
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:06,137
He's an underwear model. He wears
underwear's and poses in front of camera.

710
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:08,405
Oh! is it?
Do people earn money like that too?

711
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:09,771
Fascinating!
[mobile beeps]

712
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:11,631
[dog barks]

713
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:18,082
What is this phone uncle.
Looks like a very old model.

714
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,812
This is a special phone.

715
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:22,704
Back in those days when the
electricity went off, someone or

716
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:25,001
the other had go to the fields
to switch on and off the motor.

717
00:37:25,465 --> 00:37:27,004
And someone died by a snake bite.

718
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,241
In those days when he
was in his tenth class,

719
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:30,958
he loaded a special
software in this phone.

720
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:34,453
And I control the motor right
through phone sitting in the house.

721
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:37,143
-I use it even to this day.
-Is it so?

722
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:43,655
Uncle, there a lot good software
companies in Hyderabad now.

723
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:47,508
After when Trump was
elected as the president...

724
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,544
I mean to say that going
to America is no longer fun.

725
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:52,764
It is better for him to stay here
in Hyderabad and get a good job.

726
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,352
Yes dad, if it is a corporate company...

727
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,450
What are you talking about?

728
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,550
No matter what,
my son has to go to America.

729
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,077
I don't care what he'll do there.

730
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,500
I should take pride in telling
everyone that he is in America.

731
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:09,627
Everyone in this town should say
that Narayan's son is in America.

732
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:10,921
Son...

733
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:14,635
I don't know what you will do,
you've to go to America. That's it!

734
00:38:29,324 --> 00:38:29,913
[knocks on door]

735
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,023
[door opens]

736
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,091
God! What is your problem?

737
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:39,917
Is it about another complaint?

738
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,507
Should we attend the
committee meeting again?

739
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:43,664
-Nothing like that.
-Then?

740
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:45,247
I've come to thank you.

741
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:46,081
For what?

742
00:38:46,663 --> 00:38:48,481
For your support in the committee.

743
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:50,795
-Thanks.
-You are most welcome.

744
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:54,717
There is the concept right!

745
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:59,201
A couple of words to speak,
little tea and some biscuits!

746
00:38:59,401 --> 00:38:59,801
What?

747
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,140
I mean to say...
will you come for a coffee?

748
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:05,639
I cannot come.

749
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,205
I mean I don't drink coffee.

750
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:10,557
Oh!

751
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,784
Okay then! Bye.

752
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:15,531
Hey girl... What is that in your hand?

753
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,303
Oh!
These are leaflets for art competition.

754
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:19,447
-Oh!
-Hmm.

755
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,368
You can come too if you like.

756
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:23,924
To paint or just see?

757
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,070
Because I am not too keen on art

758
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:28,893
Think about it.

759
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:31,050
I can assure that there
would be hot girls there.

760
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:35,666
Let me see. I have my
friend's birthday party too...

761
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,931
-So I don't know.
-Hmm, okay.

762
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:42,042
Damn! Where did I find this guy?

763
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:43,498
Seriously, unromantic!

764
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:52,236
Just because someone advised you, you
are meeting this American citizen girl?

765
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:55,037
Bloody! Will you try just
about anything to go to America?

766
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,039
Are you crazy?

767
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,973
Don't we comply with
arranged marriages in India?

768
00:39:59,173 --> 00:40:00,650
-This is just like that.
-Yes!

769
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,416
If this fellow marries her,

770
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,692
he will automatically
become an American citizen.

771
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:06,763
-Hmm.
-Then he doesn't have to worry about visa.

772
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:08,512
-Absolutely.
-And no fuss about green card.

773
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:11,068
Hey you half minded fellow,
don't encourage him for no good reason.

774
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:12,544
-Hi.
-Hi.

775
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:15,058
-This is Padma Kalyan.
-Hi, I am Kishore,

776
00:40:15,258 --> 00:40:16,331
-have your seat.
-Nice to meet you,

777
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:17,878
-thank you
-Hi, this is Pavan.

778
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:19,242
Nice to meet you too.

779
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,453
-You know, I love India.
-Oh!

780
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,904
I love India and it's culture.

781
00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:28,437
This is the first time
I am coming to India.

782
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:32,211
I have a very unknown
connect with this country.

783
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:36,056
Do you know? This is
the land of Kama sutra.

784
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:41,876
We taught the world
about the art of lovemaking.

785
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:45,424
Oh, it gives me goose bumps!

786
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:47,211
Even when thinking about it.

787
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,272
-What's the deal here?
-Yeah!

788
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:52,423
-I cannot understand.
-My clock is ticking.

789
00:40:52,727 --> 00:40:55,991
-I need a baby immediately.
-Baby?

790
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:57,174
I cannot wait.

791
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:58,756
So Kishore,

792
00:40:59,016 --> 00:41:01,522
-tell me how good are you?
[scoffs]

793
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:04,425
My husband should fulfil all my desires.

794
00:41:05,974 --> 00:41:07,098
<i>She would be perfect for me.</i>

795
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,815
Desires mean not chocolates, biscuits.

796
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:11,524
Did you every read the book of
Kama Sutra? It would be this thick.

797
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:13,907
Look, I am a career oriented women.

798
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,640
My husband should do
the laundry, ironing...

799
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,428
should be able to cook
and clean the dishes...

800
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:21,964
-pick and drop me, you know?
-She is looking for a servant.

801
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:24,460
Please don't mind,
I have an urgent work to attend to.

802
00:41:24,972 --> 00:41:26,090
By the way, have a good luck.

803
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,018
In finding your ideal servant,
I mean a good husband in India.

804
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,917
-Hey let us go.
-What!

805
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:33,558
<i>Isn't it better to meet
the other three girls?</i>

806
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:38,627
<i>Hey dude that first Love guru girl,</i>
she was beautiful why did you reject her?

807
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:40,727
Let us get her married to
him, will you marry her?

808
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,866
Buy that book, she will
teach you a lesson every day.

809
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,471
Chandu is feeling jealousy.

810
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:45,361
Enough now.

811
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:05,916
What's up? You're looking at my painting.

812
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:07,694
-Did you paint this?
-Hmm!

813
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,478
-Oh, it looks amazing.
-Thanks.

814
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:14,636
Wow!

815
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,105
It's like 'expressism' mixed
with 'postmodern, surrealism'!

816
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:19,655
Isn't it just like that?

817
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:22,316
So, do you paint as well?

818
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:23,909
No, no, I am an art connoisseur.

819
00:42:24,278 --> 00:42:26,690
I keep loving art!

820
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:29,218
-Oh!
-By the way, I am Jignesh.

821
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:30,953
-Jittula Jignesh.
-Oh! Nice...

822
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:32,081
-I am Anita.
-Hi!

823
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:35,735
Hey, that's a nice painting.

824
00:42:35,935 --> 00:42:36,512
Let me take a look.

825
00:42:36,897 --> 00:42:38,267
Bro, what does 'art connoisseur' mean?

826
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,384
You cannot understand!

827
00:42:42,487 --> 00:42:42,887
Hey.

828
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:47,015
Anita... look here...

829
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:50,893
This painting depicts a grief-stricken
girl who is lonely, waiting for her beau.

830
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:53,270
-Look closely.
-Huh?

831
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:57,577
I can't believe it. Excuse me, please.

832
00:42:58,987 --> 00:43:00,417
Who put this painting upside down?

833
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,900
Yeah, this is correct.

834
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:11,383
The sad, lonely girl's
world turned upside down!

835
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:20,127
<i>And the first prize goes to
'Twilight dreams' by Anita.</i>

836
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:21,398
[crowd applause]
-Hey, congratulations!

837
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:22,143
Thank you!

838
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:22,909
Very good.

839
00:43:24,755 --> 00:43:25,488
This is my card.

840
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:29,971
And if you are interested we can
arrange a solo show with your paintings.

841
00:43:30,436 --> 00:43:30,976
Sure, sir.

842
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:32,581
-All the best!
-Thank you.

843
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:38,347
-Yes!
-Hey, congrats!

844
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:39,017
Isn't it nice?

845
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,442
So are you doing any job?

846
00:43:48,855 --> 00:43:50,041
Uh! Uh! Not really.

847
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:51,346
I am trying to go to the US.

848
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:52,740
I will go to America someday for sure.

849
00:43:53,012 --> 00:43:54,401
-That is my ultimate goal, you know.
-What?

850
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:56,092
[laughs]

851
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:58,568
-Your goal is very whimsical.
-Why do you say so?

852
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:01,381
-Going to America is your ultimate goal?
-Yes!

853
00:44:02,532 --> 00:44:03,885
How can going to a place be a goal?

854
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:08,033
Think for once, if someone says...
'Going to Nagpur is my ultimate goal?'

855
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:11,762
What you wanna do in Nagpur and
what can you do is of more importance.

856
00:44:11,962 --> 00:44:15,033
Your goal should be
achieving something in America.

857
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:16,954
Going to America can't be your goal.

858
00:44:17,502 --> 00:44:19,044
Hello madam, you will
understand that if you come to my house.

859
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:21,050
Okay... why don't you say something?

860
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:24,630
-I want to tell you something.
-Yes?

861
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,750
I don't like coffee at all.

862
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:28,709
But I love ice cream.

863
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:31,065
-Let me buy you one.
[chuckles]

864
00:44:57,097 --> 00:45:03,050
"Feel my love, feel my love!"

865
00:45:03,722 --> 00:45:06,362
-Hey Kishore, I am getting late.
-Why don't you drop me?

866
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:08,780
Huh! Do you think I have no other work?

867
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,320
-I've a plan for a movie with my friends.
-Huh!

868
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:13,404
I just asked you because we
live in the same apartment.

869
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:14,408
Huh!

870
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,260
I am breaking our friendship. Huh!

871
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:23,518
Hey! 'Rudrammadevi', wait I will drop you.

872
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,120
Huh!

873
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:27,359
Ok then, we are friends.

874
00:45:55,738 --> 00:45:59,317
"The cool breeze has noticed..."

875
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:03,374
"my breath that's getting heavier"

876
00:46:03,765 --> 00:46:07,546
"Every small path has notice..."

877
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:10,893
"where my destination is"

878
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:15,407
"The lily has noticed..."

879
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:19,119
"the strange silence that blooms"

880
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:23,465
"My eyes have noticed..."

881
00:46:24,025 --> 00:46:26,458
"the dreams they have"

882
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:31,237
"Why don't you look at me?"

883
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:35,024
"Why don't you notice the changes in me?"

884
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:38,804
"Why do you stay in your own world?"

885
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,979
"How can you not notice my presence?"

886
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:21,855
"Can I chant someone's
name in so many ways?"

887
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:29,869
"I've known that for the
first time with my age"

888
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,342
"Time chases me..."

889
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,948
"to tell you the truth"

890
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:43,297
"You don't look at me"

891
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,759
"like I'm not your girl"

892
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,303
"Don't take the wrong way..."

893
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:54,760
"in search of mirages"

894
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:59,090
"Why don't you look at me?"

895
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:03,080
"Why don't you notice the changes in me?"

896
00:48:03,365 --> 00:48:06,957
"Why do you stay in your own world?"

897
00:48:07,237 --> 00:48:11,439
"How can you not notice my presence?"

898
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,795
Yes, I will take care of it.

899
00:48:34,116 --> 00:48:35,981
I am there for you.

900
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:36,763
Okay!

901
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:39,235
So Kishore,

902
00:48:39,435 --> 00:48:41,103
-Sir?
-you don't worry. Your work will be done.

903
00:48:41,303 --> 00:48:42,322
You will go to America for sure.

904
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:46,527
So, next week RITA is conducting
a dance program in New Jersey.

905
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:48,291
You mean, Rita, is that...

906
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:50,112
Hey, pervert...

907
00:48:50,312 --> 00:48:51,598
-Shut your mouth and sit!
-RITA is not a girl.

908
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:54,436
RITA stands for
'Royal Indian Telugu Association'.

909
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:55,355
It is in New Jersey.

910
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:57,556
And you're going to
America in that dance troop.

911
00:48:57,656 --> 00:49:00,015
-Thank you, Sir.
-You don't need to thank me.

912
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:01,568
Thank me when you go there.

913
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:05,052
And next time when you
come, get me 25 lakhs, okay?

914
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:06,631
[phone rings]

915
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:08,463
-Okay...
-The minister is calling me.

916
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:10,256
Sir, Sir... Tell me sir.

917
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:11,682
<i>Yes, sir...</i>

918
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:15,769
TANA, ATA,
NATA and now RITA is also finished...

919
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:18,960
Hey Kishore, once you go to
America, form an association called PATA.

920
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,747
What is PATA?

921
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,353
Panileni (Jobless)
American Telugu Association.

922
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:25,839
You become the President of
this group of jobless people.

923
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,137
Receive all the respected
members who fly to the US,

924
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:32,425
arrange road shows,
dances and gulp all the money.

925
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:34,654
<i>And get into every cheap thing.</i>

926
00:49:34,854 --> 00:49:35,354
<i>Okay?</i>

927
00:49:36,428 --> 00:49:39,453
[cicadas chirping]
[vehicles honking]

928
00:49:41,947 --> 00:49:42,631
Dad,

929
00:49:43,784 --> 00:49:46,935
that is... I found a way to go to America,

930
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:51,287
What! 25 lakhs?

931
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:56,552
Will you got to America
for sure if you get 25 lakhs?

932
00:49:58,214 --> 00:50:01,006
Don't worry, I will arrange that money.

933
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,570
[cicada chirping]

934
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:10,727
Ashok bro,

935
00:50:12,858 --> 00:50:14,711
I've never asked anything from you.

936
00:50:16,273 --> 00:50:17,274
I am asking you for the first time.

937
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:19,356
I need some money.

938
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,030
My son is going to America.

939
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:23,750
It's about his life.

940
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:25,802
If you want I will mortgage my fields.

941
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,938
Thanks, bro.

942
00:50:30,705 --> 00:50:31,643
I will never forget your help.

943
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:43,809
Hey, did Pavan go to Jubilee bus stand?

944
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:46,443
Uncle Ramulu told me that
he gave the money to Pavan.

945
00:50:46,995 --> 00:50:48,276
And this guy has switched off his phone.

946
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:51,763
[siren wailing]

947
00:50:54,672 --> 00:50:56,312
-Is it ringing?
-No.

948
00:50:59,448 --> 00:51:01,641
My dad is sending me the money
saying that my happiness is his happiness,

949
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,768
...by keeping his fields on mortgage.

950
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:05,724
And what is Pavan up to now?

951
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,829
I don't know

952
00:51:10,088 --> 00:51:12,476
[siren wailing]

953
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:19,458
Hi...

954
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:21,207
-You idiot...
[chuckles]

955
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:22,152
what's the time now?

956
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:24,893
Where did you go? What took you so long?

957
00:51:25,093 --> 00:51:25,873
What happened man? Where did you go?

958
00:51:26,162 --> 00:51:27,319
We have been waiting till then.

959
00:51:27,902 --> 00:51:29,550
Balayya Babu's movie released today.

960
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,509
How do you think I will miss it?

961
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,209
-Okay, give me the bag.
-Why is your mobile switched off?

962
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:35,452
You don't know that mobile phones should
be switched off in a cinema theatre?

963
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:37,982
-You!
-He is like that,

964
00:51:38,743 --> 00:51:39,712
It will take some time
for us. You leave now.

965
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:42,400
-You come in.
-Dude.

966
00:51:42,705 --> 00:51:44,123
<i>They will say so...</i>

967
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:45,764
-we should know how to deal with it.
-Naresh garu,

968
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:47,499
-Yes?
-here are the 25 lakhs.

969
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:57,405
Keep it inside.

970
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:09,296
Look Kishore, I will start
all the paperwork immediately.

971
00:52:09,787 --> 00:52:11,400
You will get a visa within ten days.

972
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,354
[siren wailing]
[tyres screeching]

973
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:18,130
As soon as you land in New Jersey,
you can go

974
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,192
wherever you want and
do whatever you like.

975
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:23,785
But you shouldn't speak about me
or how you went there to any one.

976
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:25,193
-Understand?
-Hey.

977
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:27,696
-Are you Naresh Babu?
-Yes Sir.

978
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:29,873
-Pratap, take him into custody.
-Sir? Okay sir.

979
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:30,411
Hello.

980
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:31,563
What is this custody?

981
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:32,403
-Hey.
-Come on.

982
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:35,327
Sir, SI garu, who do you think I am .

983
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:39,214
Sir, I am giving jobs to
unemployed youth in America.

984
00:52:39,414 --> 00:52:40,317
-Is it?
-It is a social service.

985
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:41,212
-Is it?
-Yes.

986
00:52:41,777 --> 00:52:42,944
<i>Is this your social service?</i>

987
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:46,098
<i>We take money saying we're are going
to send them to Dubai, but we don't.</i>

988
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:46,704
<i>That's it.</i>

989
00:52:47,137 --> 00:52:48,639
<i>Keep the money inside.</i>

990
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:49,370
What is this?

991
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,878
<i>You should know managing.
This business is all about management.</i>

992
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:54,449
Is this enough to prove
you wrong? Let's go.

993
00:52:54,857 --> 00:52:56,135
Get them all into the jeep. Come on.

994
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:58,302
Sir, one person took our
money and he went that way.

995
00:52:58,421 --> 00:52:59,982
Hey brother, stop speaking in 'English'.

996
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:01,459
And get these guys into
the jeep as well. Move...

997
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,685
-Sir, sir... it's not the like that.
-Come on, let's go.

998
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:05,089
-Sir...
-Hey, move!

999
00:53:06,297 --> 00:53:08,339
-Move!
<i>-Hey, call the minister.</i>

1000
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:09,761
-Sir...
-Please sir...

1001
00:53:09,961 --> 00:53:11,907
A person took 25 lakhs
from us and he is inside sir.

1002
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:12,614
-Yes, sir.
-Is it?

1003
00:53:12,714 --> 00:53:13,195
Swear sir.

1004
00:53:13,395 --> 00:53:14,178
-Hey Pratap,
-Sir?

1005
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:15,887
-go and check if anyone is inside.
-Okay, sir.

1006
00:53:16,087 --> 00:53:17,830

1009
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:24,400
-He will come.
-25 lakhs, sir!

1010
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:25,998
-What happened Pratap?
-Hey...

1011
00:53:26,242 --> 00:53:26,642
Sir, I am coming.

1012
00:53:26,742 --> 00:53:27,513
-Sir, that is...
-Wait man!

1013
00:53:28,224 --> 00:53:29,055
-What happened?
-Brother?

1014
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:30,742
There is no one inside,
I've searched all over the place.

1015
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:31,524
-Ah!
-Is it?

1016
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:33,026
Hey, move... get into the jeep.

1017
00:53:33,326 --> 00:53:34,449
-Sir, it is not like that sir.
-Move!

00:53:34,554 --> 00:53:35,345
-Move! Move!
-Hey...

1019
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:36,801
Move, enough of all the drama.

1020
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:38,235
-Get in...
-Dude, it's 25 lakhs!

1021
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,484
Close the door. Close it.

1022
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:49,412
"Oh! My son Kishore"

1023
00:53:50,782 --> 00:53:52,568
"What a serious fraud"

1024
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,674
"Oh son, fraud it is"

1025
00:53:57,327 --> 00:54:00,130
"Oh son, fraud it is"

1026
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,993
"did you get to know of the fraud now?"

1027
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:10,162
Sir is calling you.

1028
00:54:10,934 --> 00:54:13,440
Hmm, okay uncle.

1029
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,432
Come, come, get in.

1030
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:18,643
-Uncle.
-That Naresh Babu is a big fraudster.

1031
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:19,945
I think these guys don't know.

1032
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,492
Else, they would've got
trapped in a big crime.

1033
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:23,283
Uncle, it is good that you came.

1034
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:24,557
They are safe now.

1035
00:54:24,757 --> 00:54:26,578
You should be careful guys.

1036
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:29,713
That Seenu is also a big fraud,
he took all the money and escaped uncle.

1037
00:54:30,546 --> 00:54:32,162
-How did you bear that dude?
[vehicles honking]

1038
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:33,718
Didn't they beat you?

1039
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:34,702
Let them go I'll talk to you.

1040
00:54:34,802 --> 00:54:36,222
-Not like that...
-Uncle you have helped us so much.

1041
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:37,732
Thank you so much.

1042
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:40,927
Kishore, wouldn't I do the same
if my children were in your place?

1043
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:41,994
Come on.

1044
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:44,160
Dude, there wasn't a
single mosquito inside.

1045
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,422
-Moreover the tiles were so smooth.
-Then let us go take a selfie.

1046
00:54:47,622 --> 00:54:49,377
-Hey, I beg you come let's go.
-Hey!

1047
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,724
[knocks on door]

1048
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:55,262
Dad?

1049
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,522
What is all this?

1050
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,070
'The gang who was illegally sending
youngsters to America has been caught.'

1051
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:13,517
'Cops took Kishore and Chandra
Shekar in custody who are from Siddipet.'

1052
00:55:14,122 --> 00:55:16,268
I never thought that your name
would come like this in news paper.

1053
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:17,570
Where is the money?

1054
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,083
Dad,
that is someone took all the money in...

1055
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:23,897
...yesterdays police raid.

1056
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,996
How simply you told that you've lost.

1057
00:55:26,196 --> 00:55:29,989
I sent you money by keeping our land for
mortgage as I want you to go to America.

1058
00:55:30,189 --> 00:55:33,176
You didn't went to America
moreover you have lost those 25 lakhs.

1059
00:55:33,948 --> 00:55:35,488
How can I show my face in our town?

1060
00:55:36,394 --> 00:55:37,860
Everything has been spoiled.

1061
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:42,528
Dad, I'll stay here earn
money and return them back.

1062
00:55:43,694 --> 00:55:45,623
What did you say?
Will you return them back?

1063
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:47,905
Do you think money grows on trees?

1064
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:51,316
Do you think earning 25 lakhs
living in India is that simple?

1065
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:55,342
Hey, make your friend
understand, how hard is to earn 25 lakhs.

1066
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:56,302
You are right uncle.

1067
00:55:56,502 --> 00:55:59,213
You didn't work anywhere until
now, then how would you earn?

1068
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:06,351
I dreamt for you to go to
America and settle down.

1069
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:08,616
How will you settle down here?

1070
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,148
Dad, where are you going? Sorry dad.

1071
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:18,519
Mom, is alone and worried
at home, I should go.

1072
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:20,121
Dad wait.

1073
00:57:20,205 --> 00:57:22,059
There used to be a Sarpanch in our town.

1074
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:24,029
His name is Seenu.

1075
00:57:25,587 --> 00:57:29,879
He had only one aim,
to make his son Ramu a doctor.

1076
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,456
When he did not get a
seat anywhere in Indian,

1077
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:35,784
Seenu brother sent Ramu to Russia.

1078
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:38,329
Ramu went to Russia and became a doctor.

1079
00:57:38,795 --> 00:57:44,078
He settled in Russia, bought a
house. He also got married and had kids.

1080
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:47,028
All of a sudden he came back to our town,

1081
00:57:47,295 --> 00:57:49,300
and living happily by doing farming.

1082
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,671
Why are you telling me all this now?

1083
00:57:54,587 --> 00:57:58,670
It took 35 years for Ramu to
realise what he wants in life.

1084
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:00,712
And once he realised this, he is happy.

1085
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:04,629
I think that is what defines our success!

1086
00:58:06,254 --> 00:58:08,324
We should know what we want in
life that make us happy from inside.

1087
00:58:20,562 --> 00:58:21,371
[doorbell rings]

1088
00:58:25,337 --> 00:58:26,757
What is it Kishore, are you okay?

1089
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,928
Uncle, can I talk to you now?

1090
00:58:30,948 --> 00:58:31,588
Please come.

1091
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:34,862
-Come.
[cicadas chirping]

1092
00:58:38,045 --> 00:58:38,955
So tell me. What's the matter?

1093
00:58:39,055 --> 00:58:42,504
Uncle, did your sons face any
problems before going to the US?

1094
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:48,712
Uh! Uh! No. They got their
visa in their first attempt.

1095
00:58:50,254 --> 00:58:51,573
Got admission into a top college.

1096
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,334
and a good placement while in graduation.

1097
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:56,783
Both of them are now
working in top companies.

1098
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:58,804
Uncle, glad to know about your sons.

1099
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,271
But what should I do?

1100
00:59:01,044 --> 00:59:04,633
I've tried a lot to go to the
US but failed at every attempt.

1101
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:09,273
It's been 1 year that I've completed
my degree. I don't even have a job

1102
00:59:09,473 --> 00:59:11,819
and on top of it,
I've to give my parents 25 lakhs.

1103
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:17,705
What advice will you if your
sons are in my position?

1104
00:59:22,837 --> 00:59:24,601
Life does not run
according to us, Kishore.

1105
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:27,172
But neither can you
achieve anything instantly.

1106
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,326
Develop your career and
work hard towards your goal.

1107
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:34,488
Even if you to the US,
this is what will help you.

1108
00:59:45,504 --> 00:59:46,945
<i>Next, Kishore.</i>

1109
00:59:48,462 --> 00:59:50,629
-Please be seated.
-Thank you!

1110
00:59:53,295 --> 00:59:55,004
-Mr. Kishore...
-Sir?

1111
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:58,538
It's been more than a year since you
graduated and you've no work experience.

1112
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,498
-So what were you doing all these days?
-Sir, I was planning to go to the US.

1113
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:05,552
-So I did not take up any job.
-So, you didn't work at all?

1114
01:00:07,029 --> 01:00:09,129
-No, sir.
-Ah!

1115
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:15,281
You don't have any work experience. Sorry,
Kishore, we cannot give you this position.

1116
01:00:15,962 --> 01:00:18,773
-Sir, at least consider me as a fresher.
-That's not possible Kishore.

1117
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:21,383
We consider only those who
graduated this year as freshers.

1118
01:00:22,295 --> 01:00:23,816
Sorry, better luck next time!

1119
01:00:24,737 --> 01:00:25,321
Please.

1120
01:00:26,212 --> 01:00:28,705
You have no work experience.
So we can't give you a job.

1121
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:31,435
Sir, I am trying for a job
because I have no experience.

1122
01:00:31,635 --> 01:00:32,035
No, no.

1123
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:35,809
You completed your degree last year,
right? We need experience, that's it.

1124
01:00:38,295 --> 01:00:40,989
Sir, tell me where I can find
experience. I will go get it.

1125
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:45,417
Sir, it's true that I wasted a year.

1126
01:00:46,193 --> 01:00:48,149
But if nobody is ready to give me
a job how will I gain experience?

1127
01:00:50,004 --> 01:00:51,625
If it is so,
what is the situation of people like me?

1128
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:54,461
Sorry Kishore,
you will not get a job in any MNC.

1129
01:01:09,045 --> 01:01:10,615
Kishore, hi.

1130
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:14,384
You like Umpa, so I made it for you.

1131
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:19,152
Thanks.

1132
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,634
Won't you eat?
I put in a lot of cashew nuts for you.

1133
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:35,598
Kishore, doing a job in MNC is not
the end. And that too like a robot.

1134
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:40,619
Is it important whether the
company you work in is big or small?

1135
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:43,197
Or is it important to do the job you love?

1136
01:01:43,504 --> 01:01:44,532
Hmm, tell me.

1137
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,747
Hmm...
atleast tell me now how is the Upma?

1138
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:01,384
Are you learning how to
cook from YouTube videos?

1139
01:02:02,962 --> 01:02:08,579
Hey, superb! Fantastic, stupendous,

1140
01:02:08,994 --> 01:02:10,445
-fantabulous.
-Hmm...

1141
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:13,832
Why are you using the GRE words on me?

1142
01:02:17,749 --> 01:02:20,153
[keyboard clicks]

1143
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:24,143
God! Your dressing sense has changed.

1144
01:02:24,795 --> 01:02:26,645
This is what staying in jail
overnight has done to you.

1145
01:02:28,087 --> 01:02:30,128
Hey,
are you going to paint in anyone's house?

1146
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:33,890
Every guy in India
should be jailed for two days.

1147
01:02:34,545 --> 01:02:35,988
Their minds will be set right.

1148
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:38,362
By the way, does jail have Wi-Fi?

1149
01:02:39,337 --> 01:02:41,033
Hey, go and change your dress.

1150
01:02:42,837 --> 01:02:43,779
What is this dinner all of a sudden?

1151
01:02:44,355 --> 01:02:45,517
Their sons from America have come.

1152
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:48,684
By the way, uncle's sons are so posh.

1153
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,328
How should I talk to them?

1154
01:02:50,587 --> 01:02:55,467
Hey, just like how Indians who don't
know English speak to American customers.

1155
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:57,627
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1156
01:02:58,129 --> 01:02:59,027
You just have to say that.

1157
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,948
Hey! Both of you behave well
without fighting with each other.

1158
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:05,606
Okay?

1159
01:03:06,462 --> 01:03:08,629
Both: Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1160
01:03:10,045 --> 01:03:13,199
-You!
-Why do you always raise your hand?

1161
01:03:14,295 --> 01:03:16,077
-Come... come on boys.
[chuckles]

1162
01:03:16,277 --> 01:03:17,391
Oh! Wonderful.

1163
01:03:17,696 --> 01:03:19,364
You guys look better than the other.

1164
01:03:19,564 --> 01:03:23,320
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...
-Yeah, come in.

1165
01:03:24,204 --> 01:03:24,844
-Hey!
-Ah!

1166
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,486
This is my elder son Harish.

1167
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:31,936
In Seattle,
he owns a big house with a big lawn.

1168
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:34,314
By the way,
people call me Harry in the US.

1169
01:03:34,795 --> 01:03:35,669
You can call me that too.

1170
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:37,190
-Hi..
-My second son, Manohar.

1171
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,504
-Hi!
-He is working as a senior manager at IBM.

1172
01:03:39,795 --> 01:03:41,338
-And he leads a big team there.
-Yeah.

1173
01:03:41,962 --> 01:03:42,365
Hi guys.

1174
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:46,187
-So, if Harish is Harry, Manohar is Manny?
[laughs]

1175
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:47,439
-Good joke.
-So, lame.

1176
01:03:48,546 --> 01:03:49,881
So, aunty,
you will be happy for all this month.

1177
01:03:50,737 --> 01:03:51,361
Yes, Kishore.

1178
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:53,984
It's wonderful to see
children at home like this.

1179
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:56,562
Kishore is planning to go
to America just like you.

1180
01:03:57,254 --> 01:03:59,691
-But he did not get his visa.
-Oh, I see.

1181
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,252
-See if you can help him.
-Sure, dad.

1182
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:04,059
Hey, Kishore, send your resume.

1183
01:04:04,295 --> 01:04:07,409
These days it is very tough to get
into the US. But I'll take care of it.

1184
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:12,236
-Chandu is a game designer, working in...
-Gachibowli.

1185
01:04:12,336 --> 01:04:12,962
Yes, Gachibowli.

1186
01:04:13,379 --> 01:04:14,586
How is the job scene in India?

1187
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:17,889
Are salaries any better or still the same?

1188
01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:18,850
[chuckles]

1189
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:22,139
How much do they pay monthly? Are
they still paying ten to twelve thousand?

1190
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:23,052
Nothing like that.

1191
01:04:23,379 --> 01:04:26,567
Err... A fresher gets
around twenty to thirty five thousand.

1192
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:31,587
Yea! But nothing can beat my ten
thousand dollars a month. Right?

1193
01:04:32,063 --> 01:04:33,780
Well, that's impossible here.

1194
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:39,637
Dad, Anjali has new exciting
business ideas. She has a startup.

1195
01:04:39,737 --> 01:04:41,458
-Anjali, why don't you tell them about it.
-Sure.

1196
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:44,153
-Actually, Indians in the US are so busy.
-Yeah!

1197
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:49,995
So we prepare idly mix and deliver
to their homes for all online orders.

1198
01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:52,755
We have got a thousand
followers on Facebook.

1199
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,153
It's a big hit you know.

1200
01:04:54,353 --> 01:04:57,664
-We get around twenty orders monthly.
-Yeah, it is fantastic.

1201
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:58,669
Great!

1202
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,150
Dad, do you know that
Shweta makes excellent Biryani.

1203
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:01,859
Is it?

1204
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,141
We are thinking about
having an online Biryani point.

1205
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,584
Best Biryani of Hyderabad.

1206
01:05:07,506 --> 01:05:10,101
We've registered it.
I think she'll do good.

1207
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:11,536
[chuckles]

1208
01:05:12,084 --> 01:05:13,321
You embarrass me!

1209
01:05:18,754 --> 01:05:21,113
Hey, what is that you're
doing? It is Biryani.

1210
01:05:21,712 --> 01:05:22,606
How can you eat it
with a knife and fork?

1211
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:27,238
You can experience the real taste
if you eat it with your fingers.

1212
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:29,499
I usually wash my hands and eat.

1213
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,156
What do you mean?
That I eat without washing my hands?

1214
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:34,416
[laughing]

1215
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,965
Tomorrow we are going to a
picnic so I bought you a new saree.

1216
01:06:17,862 --> 01:06:20,441
[indistinctive chatter]
[chuckles]

1217
01:06:20,761 --> 01:06:24,545
-He resembles you a lot.
-He is playing very well with you, dad.

1218
01:06:24,795 --> 01:06:28,220
Rohan, come here.
Don't play in the sand.

1219
01:06:28,529 --> 01:06:28,933
Yuck.

1220
01:06:29,133 --> 01:06:33,366
-It's okay dear, kids play in the sand.
-No, father-in-law, this is very dirty.

1221
01:06:33,675 --> 01:06:36,643
Shweta,
both my sons played in the sand like this.

1222
01:06:36,843 --> 01:06:40,525
-Once Harish was totally covered in mud.
-Harry, why don't you say something.

1223
01:06:41,004 --> 01:06:41,872
You can tell him.

1224
01:06:42,337 --> 01:06:45,035
Aye,
doesn't he play in sand-pits in the US?

1225
01:06:45,379 --> 01:06:48,720
Come on Harry,
that is US sand and this is Indian soil.

1226
01:06:49,462 --> 01:06:51,909
It is very different.
He'll catch infections.

1227
01:06:52,754 --> 01:06:53,382
Come, Rohan.

1228
01:06:54,295 --> 01:06:56,309
Hey, is there so much
difference in the sand as well?

1229
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:59,767
Don't touch me. Get your hands
away from me. Yuck, cooties.

1230
01:07:00,024 --> 01:07:01,604
Don't touch me.

1231
01:07:01,904 --> 01:07:03,853
-Go clean your hands.
-Come man.

1232
01:07:05,236 --> 01:07:09,781
[vehicles honking]

1233
01:07:14,545 --> 01:07:15,879
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1234
01:07:16,004 --> 01:07:20,147
There used to be an IT company here...
maybe it's the wrong address... sorry.

1235
01:07:20,312 --> 01:07:22,870
-Which company are you looking for?
-It's Microinfo.

1236
01:07:23,629 --> 01:07:24,616
This is Mircoinfo.

1237
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:29,367
-Oh! Is this an IT company?
-Yes, it's a startup.

1238
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,804
-Oh!
-What are you here for?

1239
01:07:31,663 --> 01:07:32,975
-Interview.
[birds chirping]

1240
01:07:33,545 --> 01:07:37,251
-Oh! Yeah... go down and take a right.
-Thanks.

1241
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:03,670
Kishore, I guess you are
looking for me. Come.

1242
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:07,494
-Kishore...
-Yes?

1243
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:10,986
You have not done well
in your written test.

1244
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:12,721
You got very less marks.

1245
01:08:13,504 --> 01:08:15,418
I'm really not sure if
I can give you this job.

1246
01:08:16,622 --> 01:08:17,154
[sighs]

1247
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,771
Sir, in India there are a lot of people
who simply by heart and get 90 marks.

1248
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:25,154
Do you want such engineers?

1249
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:29,207
Kishore, though you didn't
do well in the written test...

1250
01:08:29,407 --> 01:08:31,101
but your I am impressed by
your software programme.

1251
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:34,232
In fact, you've taken a
completely different approach.

1252
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:36,226
Let me ask you one thing.

1253
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,350
What exactly are you looking in this job?

1254
01:08:39,337 --> 01:08:41,870
I want to make products.
I want to make a difference to my people,

1255
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:42,898
I am good at building gadgets.

1256
01:08:43,177 --> 01:08:44,231
My passion is electronics.

1257
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:46,448
You are definitely different
from a conventional engineer.

1258
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,668
I want to take a chance on you.

1259
01:08:49,795 --> 01:08:50,195
You are in.

1260
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:54,913
Thank you Prakash, I will prove
myself. You will not regret this decision.

1261
01:08:55,179 --> 01:08:57,728
Kishore, we are a start
up. We make apps for doctors.

1262
01:08:57,928 --> 01:08:58,968
I can't give you high pay salary.

1263
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,492
But I can give a share in
the company. Is it okay?

1264
01:09:02,509 --> 01:09:03,513
-Definitely okay, sir.
-Good.

1265
01:09:03,837 --> 01:09:04,545
When can we start?

1266
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:07,159
-Right away.
-Great.

Don't stuff it, mom.

1269
01:09:15,879 --> 01:09:19,958
Dear, why don't you go and see your aunt?

1270
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,258
She hasn't been keeping well.

1271
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:26,203
You know that she even raised you
for sometime. You know that right?

1272
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:30,365
Yes mom, I want to
go. We will go tomorrow.

1273
01:09:30,591 --> 01:09:31,231
-Hey...
-Yeah!

1274
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:31,832
-Hello...
-Will go tomorrow...

1275
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:33,100
-You are back.
-Hi.

1276
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,115
-Hey!
-You shopped in entire Hyderabad?

1277
01:09:35,878 --> 01:09:36,356
You are back.

1278
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:37,820
You shopped a lot.

1279
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:40,949
A lot mother-in-law.
We took some sarees for mother-in-law.

1280
01:09:41,775 --> 01:09:43,350
-Looks good. How much does this cost?
-You like it?

1281
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,734
-1.2 lakhs.
-Oh!

1282
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:46,254
-Mom, isn't this beautiful!
-Yes, it is.

1283
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:48,383
-Hey Shweta,
-Yes?

1284
01:09:48,882 --> 01:09:50,785
I wanted to meet my aunt, shall we go?

1285
01:09:52,403 --> 01:09:55,917
-Shweta...
-God! What is this nonsense.

1286
01:09:56,379 --> 01:09:58,682
Didn't we decided this
before coming to India, right?

1287
01:09:58,882 --> 01:10:01,203
Not to go to relatives
home and waste our time.

1288
01:10:01,637 --> 01:10:03,557
Do you know, I still have a lot to shop.

1289
01:10:04,962 --> 01:10:06,691
Don't trouble me by
asking me such questions.

1290
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:13,536
-Hey, where did you take this?
-I took this in Panjagutta shop as well.

1291
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:15,412
Is it? They are very beautiful.

What did you do Rohan?
Those are my tablets.

1297
01:10:38,355 --> 01:10:39,470
What's the tumult little one?

1298
01:10:39,992 --> 01:10:41,122
I will spank you, be careful.

1299
01:10:41,492 --> 01:10:43,966
Mother-in-law,
who are you to scold my son?

1300
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,986
Doesn't his grandmother
have the right to scold him?

1301
01:10:47,186 --> 01:10:50,766
Father-in-law,
only parents have this right in the US.

1302
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:55,495
Grandparents can only visit them but
have no right to spank or scold them.

1303
01:10:56,458 --> 01:11:00,652
After all, they are only
tablets. You can buy them again.

1304
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:03,442
Why should you create so
much fuss? Get in Rohan.

1305
01:11:03,642 --> 01:11:04,290
Hey...

1306
01:11:09,512 --> 01:11:10,989
She shouldn't have
spoken to aunty like that.

1307
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:13,295
Should you bother about it?

1308
01:11:16,297 --> 01:11:16,854
Brother...

1309
01:11:20,118 --> 01:11:23,536
-Uncle, I am sorry.
-It's all right.

1310
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:28,122
-Ah! Ah!
-Hey, Sunanda...

1311
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,217
-Aunty.
-Sunanda.

1312
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,792
-Mom! Mom!
-Sunanda...

1313
01:11:31,173 --> 01:11:32,403
-Aunty...
-Mom!

1314
01:11:32,503 --> 01:11:33,315
-Aunty...
-Mom!

1315
01:11:33,599 --> 01:11:34,674
-Mom...
-Sunanda...

1316
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,583
She is absolutely fine.

1317
01:11:40,656 --> 01:11:43,522
Her BP got high. You don't have to worry.

1318
01:11:43,722 --> 01:11:44,449
Thank you, doctor.

1319
01:11:45,021 --> 01:11:46,691
I guess you are only
doing all the work at home.

1320
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:51,083
Now that your both daughter-in-laws
are here, you should take rest.

1321
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:52,634
Okay, doctor.

1322
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,599
From now on,
your children will take care of you.

1323
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:55,855
What do you say Mr. Rao?

1324
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:56,965
Yes, doctor.

1325
01:11:57,362 --> 01:12:00,120
They are coming back to India
from the US in about three months.

1326
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:03,246
There is no doubt that they
will take good care of us,

1327
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,503
Your children are gems.
You are very lucky Rao garu

1328
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,958
Any parents can only
wish for sons like these.

1329
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,047
After all, it is your parenting.

1330
01:12:12,608 --> 01:12:14,569
Successful sons, good daughter-in-laws.

1331
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,555
By the way, when are you
planning to come back to India?

1332
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:21,117
-Very soon...
-In another one or two months.

1333
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:33,503
What is happening? How is father-in-law
so sure that we are coming back?

1334
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:34,838
What did you tell him?

1335
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:36,439
I did not tell him anything, Shweta.

1336
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:38,899
I think dad is just imaging.

1337
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,506
But why should we come back
to India? It is so dirty here.

1338
01:12:43,874 --> 01:12:46,140
So much of pollution and on
top of it, these mosquitoes.

1339
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,160
It is so tough to raise children here.

1340
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:54,269
<i>If we stay in India,
someone or the other keeps coming.</i>

1341
01:12:54,469 --> 01:12:56,801
And all my life will be spent in
serving tea and coffee to relatives.

1342
01:12:57,542 --> 01:12:59,386
And what about our privacy?

1343
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,816
No way.

1344
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:05,325
I can't believe that you didn't
utter a single word in front of your dad.

1345
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:06,614
Then what do you want me to do?

1346
01:13:07,265 --> 01:13:08,868
That we have applied
for American citizenship

1347
01:13:09,068 --> 01:13:11,538
we will settle there itself and
we are not coming back to India?

1348
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:12,731
That too when my mom is not well.

1349
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:17,448
Brother,
my friend faced the same situation.

1350
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:19,305
He did not tell anything to his parents.

1351
01:13:19,917 --> 01:13:22,672
He advised me never to
give any kind of commitment...

1352
01:13:23,061 --> 01:13:26,223
...when faced with such situations.

1353
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:32,268
After some time,
parents will understand all by themselves.

1354
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:36,088
<i>-Okay, we will do the same...
-May be a good option.</i>

1355
01:13:40,317 --> 01:13:43,571
Uncle, here are your medicines.

1356
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:46,080
Thanks, Kishore.

1357
01:13:53,174 --> 01:13:56,063
I usually don't like to
involve in uncle's family matters.

1358
01:13:56,263 --> 01:13:57,255
But I wonder what happened to me.

1359
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,799
It is okay. I didn't find it wrong.

1360
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:02,568
Did you see how both the sons were
simply quiet when she was abusing aunty?

1361
01:14:02,824 --> 01:14:03,320
Just quiet.

1362
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,686
No matter how much mom
tried to convince me,

1363
01:14:04,786 --> 01:14:05,901
I never agreed to any
NRI marriage alliance.

1364
01:14:06,101 --> 01:14:08,603
-If they are NRI's, do they change?
-Yes, they do change.

1365
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:11,779
Hi-Fi jobs, status, new priorities...

1366
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:16,442
who knows, tomorrow you might change too.

1367
01:14:20,262 --> 01:14:25,059
For me, the relationship with my parents,
friends should always be the same forever.

1368
01:14:25,259 --> 01:14:26,662
I don't want any of it to change for me.

1369
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,550
-It's okay for me.
-What?

1370
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:31,955
I am done with my ice
cream. Give me yours.

1371
01:14:32,155 --> 01:14:35,167
-Hey, she looks sizzling hot.
-She is your sister.

1372
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:38,288
-Hey, get lost you idiot!
-What are you doing?

1373
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,613
If they come back it
will be a big problem.

1374
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,431
I am so brave because you're beside me.

1375
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:49,326
Okay, but next time, tell me
ahead so that I'll be prepared.

1376
01:14:49,592 --> 01:14:51,522
Super! Will you fight for me?

1377
01:14:51,722 --> 01:14:54,698
Hello, I will get ready
to run away, not fight!

1378
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:56,550
-Kishore, I'll...
-Hey! Hey!

1379
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:06,028
Hey, what do you think of yourself?

1380
01:15:06,923 --> 01:15:07,717
That you're great?

1381
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:09,988
Are you trying to show off?

1382
01:15:12,997 --> 01:15:17,440
I don't mind because I love you so much.

1383
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:20,608
I feel so good when I am around you.

1384
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:24,054
You said you didn't like
art but loved my paintings.

1385
01:15:25,694 --> 01:15:26,599
I felt good.

1386
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:32,973
You don't say anything about yourself
but ever ready to help everyone around.

1387
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,354
On the whole, you see me as what I am...

1388
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:43,293
[birds chirping]
[sighs]

1389
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:49,583
Kishore,
will you love me if I say that I love you?

1390
01:15:51,642 --> 01:15:53,297
What will you say? Tell me.

1391
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,240
I know you won't say anything.

1392
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,226
Because you are crazy
about going to America.

1393
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:11,697
Anita, that is...

1394
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:25,771
<i>Though Anita was brave enough to
confess her love, I could not answer her.</i>

1395
01:16:26,093 --> 01:16:27,024
<i>What should I tell her?</i>

1396
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,523
<i>I had too many things going on in my
life and I was not sure of anything.</i>

1397
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,074
<i>Not even my own feelings.</i>

1398
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:34,399
Shweta, come back soon.

1399
01:16:34,599 --> 01:16:36,430
-Yes bro, I've already checked in.
-Yeah!

1400
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:39,740
We will arrange for Rohan's
admission into a good school here.

1401
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,153
Okay mother-in-law.

1402
01:16:44,338 --> 01:16:46,850
Mother-in-law,
take your tablets regularly.

1403
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,030
We will worry if your
health is not stable.

1404
01:16:49,342 --> 01:16:50,448
-Take care mother-in-law.
-Okay.

1405
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:53,658
Alright, take care mom. See you, dad.

1406
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,623
-Mom, take care of your health.
-Hmm...

1407
01:16:56,823 --> 01:16:57,278
Take care.

1408
01:16:59,158 --> 01:16:59,811
Bye dad.

1409
01:17:01,467 --> 01:17:06,255
<i>Anand Rao was always proud of
his sons, but that day he wasn't.</i>

1410
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,100
<i>He felt the emotional
vacuum. Some sort of sadness.</i>

1411
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:18,615
-Kishore, you wanted to show me something?
-Yes, Prakash.

1412
01:17:19,644 --> 01:17:23,693
I made a prototype for ultrasound
machine. I wanted to show it to you.

1413
01:17:24,274 --> 01:17:26,358
So basically I am
trying to reduce it's cost.

1414
01:17:27,163 --> 01:17:29,936
[music mutes voices]

1415
01:17:35,064 --> 01:17:37,724
-I think we're ready for investors.
-Yeah, thanks Prakash.

1416
01:17:38,078 --> 01:17:38,547
Good job.

1417
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,924
<i>Guys, please present your business idea.</i>

1418
01:17:41,519 --> 01:17:44,671
Currently hospitals use this
diagnostics system to test pregnant women.

1419
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:48,429
With this equipment, we can assess the
health of the unborn baby in the womb.

1420
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:49,853
And these are very expensive.

1421
01:17:50,285 --> 01:17:51,847
Costs around 15 to 20 lakhs.

1422
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:55,255
Only super speciality
hospitals in metros can afford these.

1423
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:56,465
And they are all imported.

1424
01:17:56,665 --> 01:17:59,346
Now I invite Mr. Kishore to
present our new product...

1425
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:00,922
for which we are seeking investments.

1426
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:02,999
-Kishore...
-Thank you Prakash.

1427
01:18:03,818 --> 01:18:05,793
This is a portable ultrasound scanner...

1428
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:08,737
which we developed using
3D printing technology.

1429
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:13,963
Completely made in India and this is
priced only at fifty thousand rupees.

1430
01:18:14,351 --> 01:18:15,333
Now,
we can keep a machine in every town...

1431
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:17,676
...and village,
in every primary healthcare centre.

1432
01:18:17,925 --> 01:18:20,337
And we can test every
pregnant women using this machine.

1433
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:25,269
And this is backed by viable
and scalable business model.

1434
01:18:27,492 --> 01:18:30,101
See,
this is the problem with new generation.

1435
01:18:30,817 --> 01:18:32,659
Guys, why do you want
to create something new?

1436
01:18:32,859 --> 01:18:35,201
You should leave the
creating part to Europe or the US.

1437
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:38,544
In India we should go online.
Why don't you consider online trading?

1438
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:41,653
Take a successful website from
the US and replicate it here.

1439
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,636
Come up with something original.

1440
01:18:45,177 --> 01:18:47,384
[scoffs]
Original?

1441
01:18:49,442 --> 01:18:51,346
We shout slogans 'Make
in India, Make in India'.

1442
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,047
If we sell foreign products online in
India, how can it be 'Make in India'?

1443
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:56,949
That will not be 'Make in
India', but it will be 'Make up India'.

1444
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:00,875
That is why everyone in India
are traders and not creators.

1445
01:19:02,508 --> 01:19:07,004
Everything is imported, from the
diaper a baby wears to the Gillette blade.

1446
01:19:07,204 --> 01:19:10,281
My laptop, my watch, my TV
and shoes... not only that...

1447
01:19:10,568 --> 01:19:14,526
even the God in my shrine to the
kites we fly are all made in China.

1448
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:17,128
Even the mosquito bats sold at
traffic signals are also imported.

1449
01:19:17,432 --> 01:19:20,815
If you don't invest in product companies,
when will Indian brands come up?

1450
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,972
When can we create global brands?

1451
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,002
When will India develop, sir?

1452
01:19:26,086 --> 01:19:29,853
Some lakhs of engineers are
working in software companies.

1453
01:19:30,151 --> 01:19:31,504
But none of them create a new product.

1454
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:35,385
Because we lend our services to
hundreds of companies in America.

1455
01:19:36,217 --> 01:19:40,772
Abdul Kalam was right,
we are all 'Software Coolies'.

1456
01:19:41,717 --> 01:19:42,739
Oh! Really?

1457
01:19:43,007 --> 01:19:45,946
Are you trying to teach us?
We've studied in IIT and IIM.

1458
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:47,356
Do you know much more than what we do?

1459
01:19:47,612 --> 01:19:49,936
Guys, I think we are
done here. Let's leave.

1460
01:19:56,898 --> 01:19:58,442
You have done a good job. Relax.

1461
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:03,352
Hi, I am Mohan. I am an
industrialist and an angel investor.

1462
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,910
I've been really looking for
passionate people with a good product.

1463
01:20:07,114 --> 01:20:10,129
I believe I found the right team and
keen on investing in your company.

1464
01:20:10,447 --> 01:20:11,774
I will invest in your company.

1465
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,106
-Thank you so much.
-Prakash and Kishore,

1466
01:20:14,926 --> 01:20:17,263
-we will build a global brand from India.
-Thank you sir...

1467
01:20:17,483 --> 01:20:19,170
-What do you say?
-Sure, sure sir. Why not!

1468
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:19,980
All the best!

1469
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:24,429
By the way I never went to IIT or IIM but
still built a world class company. Bye.

1470
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:27,944
-Congrats!
[laughs]

1471
01:20:28,794 --> 01:20:30,068
-Thanks to you.
-Let's do it.

1472
01:20:33,422 --> 01:20:36,759
Where is Kishore? It's been three days.

1473
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,750
He is not taking my calls or
checking my WhatsApp messages.

1474
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:43,204
Oh goddess! Even we haven't seen him.

1475
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:45,665
We are worried that we
are not able to drink.

1476
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:48,403
And this is the first
time that he is working.

1477
01:20:48,794 --> 01:20:50,796
I wonder what will happen to this country.

1478
01:20:51,896 --> 01:20:52,998
[sighs]

1479
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:05,862
I'll not spare him today.

1480
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:07,836
-What he is thinking about himself.
-Mr. Rao, can you please handle that?

1481
01:21:08,292 --> 01:21:08,935
-Hey.
-Hey!

1482
01:21:09,629 --> 01:21:10,107
Hi.

1483
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:12,107
What do you think about yourself?

1484
01:21:12,822 --> 01:21:15,282
You don't take my calls or don't even
reply to my messages in WhatsApp.

1485
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,626
Look at how your behaving.

1486
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:23,487
Oh! You are ignoring me
because I like you, isn't it?

1487
01:21:24,139 --> 01:21:26,284
Come on, it is not like
that. Come with me.

1488
01:21:26,685 --> 01:21:27,350
Leave me.

1489
01:21:27,543 --> 01:21:29,331
Come with me, please.

1490
01:21:29,567 --> 01:21:31,686
-Where are you taking me?
-I will show you something.

1491
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:37,797
-Morning sir.
-Morning.

1492
01:21:41,013 --> 01:21:43,913
This is an Ultrasound machine that'll
help pregnant women living in rural areas.

1493
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:49,371
I made this.

1494
01:21:50,025 --> 01:21:51,183
-Huh?
-Hmm...

1495
01:21:53,983 --> 01:21:54,423
Happy?

1496
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:57,371
TV: <i>If you work hard,
anything is possible in life.</i>

1497
01:21:57,571 --> 01:22:01,013
<i>And Kishore from Siddipet is
a quintessence for the same.</i>

1498
01:22:01,238 --> 01:22:03,330
<i>This is an ultrasound
scanner designed with low cost.</i>

1499
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:07,358
<i>His success has become the
trending topic in the two Telugu states.</i>

1500
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:11,933
<i>The cost of an Ultrasound CT scanner used
for pregnant women costs around 50 lakhs.</i>

1501
01:22:12,187 --> 01:22:14,905
<i>But this scanner designed by Kishore is...</i>

1502
01:22:15,105 --> 01:22:17,481
<i>-only fifty thousand rupees.</i>
-I am happy to announce. Our company...

1503
01:22:17,834 --> 01:22:22,414
...has been acquired by a big
American company for 20 Million dollars!

1504
01:22:22,614 --> 01:22:24,805
-Wow! Super!
[applause]

1505
01:22:33,884 --> 01:22:36,628
You are a rich man, now.
Do you know the value of your shares?

1506
01:22:36,894 --> 01:22:38,486
-It is more than a crore!
-Really?

1507
01:22:38,717 --> 01:22:39,478
Are you serious?

1508
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,703
Congratulations, uncle!

1509
01:23:05,192 --> 01:23:07,097
Our Kishore is super.

1510
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:08,410
But he did not get his visa for US.

1511
01:23:08,663 --> 01:23:10,319
You are all happily
settled in the America.

1512
01:23:10,543 --> 01:23:13,330
What are you talking, uncle. What
Kishore has achieved in commendable.

1513
01:23:13,569 --> 01:23:16,358
The jobs we have been doing in
America since ten years are routine jobs.

1514
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:19,181
-It is the same work, no change.
-Here, take some tea.

1515
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:22,998
Success is not
defined by living in the US.

1516
01:23:23,286 --> 01:23:25,025
Look at how Kishore
invented something great.

1517
01:23:25,258 --> 01:23:26,283
That is achievement.

1518
01:23:26,615 --> 01:23:29,521
Back in America we are sharing his
achievement on Facebook and WhatsApp.

1519
01:23:29,721 --> 01:23:31,614
And boast that he is our cousin.

1520
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:36,288
Narayana, if your son has achieved so much
here, why does he need to go to America?

1521
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:40,710
If he can do a lot here,
imagine what he can do in America.

1522
01:23:41,663 --> 01:23:45,185
In another six months,
he will get a visa and fly to America.

1523
01:23:52,472 --> 01:23:53,722
Sunanda...

1524
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,280
Dear, look how good this school is.

1525
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:58,410
And it is near to our house.

1526
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:01,710
It will be so good if
Rohan studied in this school.

1527
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:03,420
Huh, Sunanda...

1528
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:05,456
What is it?

1529
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:08,729
Nothing...

1530
01:24:12,598 --> 01:24:13,313
[chuckles]

1531
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:21,234
By the way professor, you were
supposed to go to US this month.

1532
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:24,300
It's been six months. When are you going?

1533
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,160
I am not going, sir.

1534
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:29,861
I don't have to because my
visa renewal has been rejected.

1535
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,408
Rejected, but how?

1536
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:32,960
What is there to hide with you, sir?

1537
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,507
I became a little selfish.

1538
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:38,064
I purposefully made a mistake on
the visa form. That's it, rejected.

1539
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:41,746
Now my children won't call me.
I don't have to be a baby sitter,

1540
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:44,981
I don't have to cringe
watching those Telugu serials all day.

1541
01:24:45,888 --> 01:24:46,971
What else can you do?

1542
01:24:47,323 --> 01:24:50,208
Just spending six
months amidst the four walls.

1543
01:24:50,864 --> 01:24:52,982
We can't go out or speak to anyone.

1544
01:24:53,553 --> 01:24:54,964
Neither do we know those rules.

1545
01:24:55,283 --> 01:24:57,237
We have to put the
trash can out on Monday.

1546
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:00,584
If not we'll get verbally
abused by son and daughter-in-law.

1547
01:25:00,784 --> 01:25:03,258
Should take care of laundry.

1548
01:25:03,603 --> 01:25:07,399
If our grandchildrens trouble us, we
are not allowed to say anything to them

1549
01:25:07,671 --> 01:25:09,640
and just feel sacred.

1550
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,191
I can't do this anymore, sir.

1551
01:25:11,526 --> 01:25:16,004
But why should we do this
service at this age, Mr. Rao?

1552
01:25:16,847 --> 01:25:17,922
[birds chirping]
-I can't do this.

1553
01:25:18,522 --> 01:25:21,576
From now, I will stay here
only. Happy and comfortable life.

1554
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:23,637
Rangadu and Saiamma will
take care of the house.

1555
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:26,296
Mr. Rao, what happened?

1556
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:30,255
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah!

1557
01:25:32,151 --> 01:25:37,172
Where did you do the
mistake in the visa form?

1558
01:25:37,372 --> 01:25:39,386
Because our visa is nearing renewal.

1559
01:25:40,746 --> 01:25:42,147
I want it to get rejected.

1560
01:25:43,218 --> 01:25:46,612
I don't want to go to America either.

1561
01:25:48,945 --> 01:25:49,838
I will tell you.

1562
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:13,241

-Hi...

1565
01:26:21,413 --> 01:26:22,247
What brings you here?

1566
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:23,495
Shouldn't I come?

1567
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,457
[chuckles]
-It's not like that.

1568
01:26:26,385 --> 01:26:28,643
Even though we are neighbours
you never came to our house, so...

1569
01:26:30,256 --> 01:26:31,356
I came to see your paintings.

1570
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:33,738
Oh! Come.

1571
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:36,641
Umm...

-Greetings.
-Greetings.

1573
01:26:38,284 --> 01:26:40,184
He has come to see the
paintings I made for the art show.

1574
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,080
-Oh!
-Oh!

1575
01:26:41,317 --> 01:26:42,156
-Is it.
-Come.

Wow!

01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:14,573
I am done.

1581
01:27:30,797 --> 01:27:34,265
So? Tell me now...

1582
01:27:34,365 --> 01:27:35,433
-Why did you come?
-I...

1583
01:27:35,937 --> 01:27:37,065
really like your room.

1584
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:39,317
I mean...

1585
01:27:40,741 --> 01:27:41,871
I like your world.

1586
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:52,855
-Anita, I wanted to tell you something.
-Hmm?

1587

It was a heart attack.

But now he is fine.

1599
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:09,519
You got him in at the right time.

1600
01:29:09,792 --> 01:29:11,162
You can see him after an hour.

1601

Mom, get the best treatment for dad.
It doesn't matter how many dollars!

Why did it take so long
to reach to the hospital?

1605
01:29:25,077 --> 01:29:26,247
Give me the ambulance phone number.

1606
01:29:26,447 --> 01:29:28,250
Shweta will call and raise a complaint.

1607
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:31,230
Mom, if it's in the US,
you can reach the hospital in ten minutes.

Mom, send me dad's reports in WhatsApp.

Anjali will check on the internet
and send suggestions to the doctor.

01:29:38,709 --> 01:29:42,099
Okay,
I will call you once your father is awake.

Children are not coming, right?

1616
01:30:00,493 --> 01:30:04,509
It seems, they have some important work.

1617
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:07,694
Otherwise they would have definitely come.

1618
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,684
They would have come.

1619
01:30:10,716 --> 01:30:12,019

they are well settled in America.

1621
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:23,062
As parents of such successful
kids, we should be very happy.

He will be discharged soon.

-Son, uncle never misses this serial.
-Hey!

01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:24,848
Because the heroine of this
serial is uncle's favourite.

01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,727
Tell him that there is
already someone in your life.

1688
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:32,673
Tell him, 'I am his life'.

1689
01:33:34,792 --> 01:33:36,113
Tell him, 'He is crazy for me'.

1690
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:38,659
Tell him, 'He adores me'.

1691
01:33:40,917 --> 01:33:43,865
Tell him,
'He loves my paintings and my drama'.

1692
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:47,595
Tell him, 'He feels proud of me'.

1693
01:33:52,688 --> 01:33:55,534
'He loves my eyes, my nose...'

1694
01:33:57,390 --> 01:34:00,081
'and my lips the most', tell him that.

1695
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:34,500
Should I tell him that when he
kisses me the entire world stops?

1696
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,463
Bro, sorry it is not room number
132, emergency in room 142.

1697
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:15,722
She was wrong.

1698
01:35:16,588 --> 01:35:18,278
Seriously, it is urgent it seems.

1699
01:35:19,293 --> 01:35:20,166
Please go.

1700
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:23,797
God! They are troubling me.

1701
01:35:24,309 --> 01:35:26,063
-Hey, why are you taking those keys?
-Hey!

1702
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:26,986
-What are you doing?
[laughing]

1703
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:29,125
Hey, Rudrammadevi wait,
I'll teach you a lesson.

1704
01:35:29,325 --> 01:35:33,078
[laughing]

1705
01:35:46,576 --> 01:35:46,976
Hey!

1706
01:36:00,121 --> 01:36:05,162
[phone rings]
[laughs]

1707
01:36:07,586 --> 01:36:08,265
Hello, Prakash...

1708
01:36:08,465 --> 01:36:10,636
Congratulations! Pack your bags, kiddo!

1709
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,969
Finally you're going to US, next week.

1710
01:36:13,169 --> 01:36:14,426
<i>You got your green card.</i>

1711
01:36:14,626 --> 01:36:16,821
Are you serious? I can't believe this!

1712
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,233
How it happened this early?

1713
01:36:18,333 --> 01:36:20,068
<i>Actually, when our company was
in the process of acquisition,</i>

1714
01:36:20,394 --> 01:36:21,732
they wanted you desperately.

1715
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,920
<i>But I didn't tell you this.</i>

1716
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,120
<i>Because I wanted to make
sure it happens this time.</i>

1717
01:36:25,343 --> 01:36:27,735
But how did I get a green
card so quickly, Prakash?

1718
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:31,878
<i>This is given to extraordinary people in
the EB1 category in a fast track process.</i>

1719
01:36:32,327 --> 01:36:34,913
<i>This is given only to
scientist and top engineers.</i>

1720
01:36:35,292 --> 01:36:38,289
<i>Kishore, America thinks
you are someone very special.</i>

1721
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:40,990
Thank you Prakash, thank you!

1722
01:36:58,542 --> 01:36:59,298
Who was on the call?

1723
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:01,855
It is my boss from the office.

1724
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:05,384
He said there is some
urgent work to be done.

1725
01:37:05,584 --> 01:37:06,370
Hmm...

1726
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:12,147
I should go and prepare
for my art show, bye.

1727
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,567
<i>That day, looking at how happy she was,</i>

1728
01:37:16,767 --> 01:37:18,899
<i>I couldn't reveal about
my green card to Anita.</i>

1729
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:19,822
<i>Doctor!</i>

1730
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:20,812
<i>Doctor!</i>

1731
01:37:24,829 --> 01:37:26,268
Hey, what happened?

1732
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,026
Son...

1733
01:37:27,226 --> 01:37:29,453
-What happened aunty?
-Uncle.

1734
01:37:29,718 --> 01:37:31,499
-Uncle!
-Doctor!

1735
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,701
-Uncle.
-Doctor,

1736
01:37:34,901 --> 01:37:36,426
come please check him.

1737
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:40,968
Husband.

1738
01:37:43,259 --> 01:37:44,273
-Sorry.
[gasps]

1739
01:37:48,976 --> 01:37:53,456
[sobs]
-Husband.

1740
01:38:03,364 --> 01:38:04,937
Shweta, we have to go to India urgently.

1741
01:38:05,137 --> 01:38:06,248
I am booking the tickets right away.

1742
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:09,372
God, there are no tickets
available at such short notice.

1743
01:38:09,572 --> 01:38:11,387
Tickets are available only after
a day and that too very expensive.

1744
01:38:11,728 --> 01:38:13,972
We already have a lot of expenditure
because of our mortgage payments.

1745
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,039
Think for a while.

1746
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:21,271
Harry, I will take care of Rohan.

1747
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,829
Why don't you go alone?

1748
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:28,333
Anyways you will reach after two days,
in which case you can't even see the body.

1749
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:29,277
Shweta...

1750
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:32,024
I mean you can't even see father-in-law.

1751
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:34,636
So... there is no point going there now.

1752
01:38:35,292 --> 01:38:39,277
But if you go by the tenth day, you
can spend some time with your mother.

1753
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:43,042
And I am sure there are a lot
of relatives to pacify her now.

1754
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:45,996
So there is no use going now.

1755
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:49,825
"Is this the curse of
providing you with good education,"

1756
01:38:52,777 --> 01:38:55,539
"Come, my son"

1757
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:57,054
What did you decide Manohar?

1758
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:02,055
Anjali, I have an
important project delivery.

1759
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:03,472
It is hard to get leave now.

1760
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:04,701
But I have to go.

1761
01:39:05,458 --> 01:39:06,432
Please, pack the bags.

1762
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:10,350
I know this is a very emotional issue.

1763
01:39:11,422 --> 01:39:13,291
But there is a risk to your job.

1764
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,913
We can't be so impractical.

1765
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:21,145
It is not a simple decision
to go there, Manohar.

1766
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:25,481
By the way, it's your brother's
duty to perform the last rites.

1767
01:39:26,292 --> 01:39:30,873
When he is not going,
what is the point of you going there?

1768
01:39:33,292 --> 01:39:38,047
Mom, by the time I come,
the funeral will be done.

1769
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:41,320
I don't know what to do.

1770
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:46,875
<i>Mother-in-law,</i> don't worry, he will
be there for the tenth day for sure.

1771
01:39:51,171 --> 01:39:54,708
"Do you understand the
excruciating pain a mother goes through?"

1772
01:39:58,544 --> 01:40:02,356
-It's okay. Come, when you want to.
-"You'd get a chance to see him"

1773
01:40:11,596 --> 01:40:14,479
"Is it the punishment for raising you?"
-My dear,

1774
01:40:15,067 --> 01:40:19,476
we have dedicated our lives
to the best of our children.

1775
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:24,068
I left my job because
our elder son had asthma.

1776
01:40:25,121 --> 01:40:26,537
I remained a housewife.

1777
01:40:27,899 --> 01:40:32,037
We sent our second son to
the USA by selling our house.

1778
01:40:33,792 --> 01:40:37,499
You always told me that
our kids are our priority.

1779
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:43,167
But I am unable to understand
where we went wrong as parents.

1780
01:40:44,542 --> 01:40:48,862
I am unable to understand...

1781
01:40:49,062 --> 01:40:52,868
[sobbing]
-I am unable to understand...

1782
01:40:57,034 --> 01:41:03,034
"In the fire of pyre,
I turn into the raging flames too,"

1783
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:07,501
"Can't you come, my son?"

1784
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,558
"In the middle of the night,"

1785
01:41:14,118 --> 01:41:16,870
"I called you my son"

1786
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:21,097
"Couldn't you hear me, my son?"

1787
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:30,469
"You have gone too far from the
shadow of those who gave birth to you"

1788
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,972
"What's the use to live?"

1789
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:38,792
It seems that Mr. Anand
Rao's children are not coming.

1790
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:40,875
It is our generation who sends them there.

1791
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,583
It is not in our hands
when they'd come back.

1792
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:45,206
First, they start troubling us
saying they 'want a student visa'.

1793
01:41:45,417 --> 01:41:49,167
After completing studies they get into
a job and ask that they need an H1 visa.

1794
01:41:49,417 --> 01:41:52,167
And to change a job easily they
say, they need a Green Card.

1795
01:41:52,458 --> 01:41:56,315
And if we ask them to at least come now,
they say that if they come back with...

1796
01:41:56,841 --> 01:41:58,099
the Green Card visa, it may get cancelled.

1797
01:41:58,477 --> 01:42:00,294
They say that they'll come
after they get citizenship.

1798
01:42:00,494 --> 01:42:02,454
Mean while their children grew up

1799
01:42:02,654 --> 01:42:06,792
and the kids are not interested to come
back to India, so we'll also stay there.

1800
01:42:07,185 --> 01:42:13,063
Bro, going to the US is a one way
ticket. There is no return ticket.

1801
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,247
That's about it!

1802
01:42:15,022 --> 01:42:17,850
"You thumped my chest
while playing as a baby,"

1803
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:21,941
"is this the curse of providing you
with clothes, food, and schooling."

1804
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:29,625
"Come, my son..."

1805
01:42:32,316 --> 01:42:36,042
"Come, my son"

1806
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:56,167
Hey... life is so unpredictable.

1807
01:42:57,566 --> 01:42:59,031
What all I did to go to the US.

1808
01:42:59,789 --> 01:43:00,736
Nothing worked out for me.

1809
01:43:02,063 --> 01:43:06,664
Shucks! And when I was about to give up
is when things started to fall in place.

1810
01:43:08,225 --> 01:43:08,715
[scoffs]

1811
01:43:09,417 --> 01:43:10,803
Nothing happens according to us.

1812
01:43:12,376 --> 01:43:15,287
Hey, everything happens
according to one's will.

1813
01:43:17,667 --> 01:43:21,710
Now you will go to Florida and we
will come to see you in Florida.

1814
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:24,900
When you come to the
airport to pick us up,

1815
01:43:25,563 --> 01:43:28,061
get two girls in bikini in your BMW.

1816
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:30,417
We will start the party
right from the airport.

1817
01:43:31,542 --> 01:43:32,875
Hey, shut up you 'Ding dong bell'.

1818
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,215
Kishore you gave great speech about...

1819
01:43:36,415 --> 01:43:37,902
'Make in India'
in front of those investors.

1820
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,750
You invented
something useful for everyone.

1821
01:43:41,358 --> 01:43:42,634
You're in love with a girl.

1822
01:43:43,375 --> 01:43:45,500
And when you got the Green Card
now you want to fly away to America?

1823
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:48,600
Do you think this is correct?

1824
01:43:49,667 --> 01:43:50,446
I don't know.

1825
01:43:51,237 --> 01:43:54,083
I've never seen my dad
look so happy because of me.

1826
01:43:56,232 --> 01:44:00,123
But, when my dad is so happy...

1827
01:44:01,194 --> 01:44:05,450
whichever reason has made him happy,
may be I think that is only correct.

1828
01:44:19,614 --> 01:44:20,889
Here Pavan, take this sweet.

1829
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,290
My son is going to America.

1830
01:44:24,198 --> 01:44:25,800
[laughs]

1831
01:44:26,042 --> 01:44:27,553
-How are you?
-I am good, mom.

1832
01:44:27,653 --> 01:44:28,601
-Come, sit.
-Thanks uncle.

1833
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:30,172
-I wonder when you guys will go!
-Ah!

1834
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:33,504
I've never seen your father look so happy.

1835
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:37,144
He called everyone and told
them that your flying to America.

1836
01:44:37,344 --> 01:44:39,438
Why not! After a long time,
my son is going to America.

1837
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:45,425
And that too not on any visa,
but directly with a green card.

1838
01:44:51,534 --> 01:44:53,351
<i>My mom and dad are happy.</i>

1839
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:55,917
<i>But I haven't said anything
about my Green Card to Anita.</i>

1840
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:57,928
<i>That's one thing left to be done.</i>

1841
01:45:02,813 --> 01:45:04,740
[bike engine revs]

1842
01:45:04,997 --> 01:45:08,847
[birds chirping]

1843
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,738
Why did are you here?

1844
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:31,563
Anita, I got a US Green Card visa,

1845
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:33,444
I wanted to tell you that.

1846
01:45:34,292 --> 01:45:35,927
I know, congrats!

1847
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:39,138
So when are you leaving for the US?

1848
01:45:41,167 --> 01:45:41,707
Day after tomorrow.

1849
01:45:45,633 --> 01:45:47,915
-What, day after tomorrow?
-Yes.

1850
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:57,099
Sorry, I wanted to tell you before
but everything happened so quick.

1851
01:45:59,875 --> 01:46:02,931
Okay.
You are telling me now, so problem solved!

1852
01:46:03,542 --> 01:46:06,443
Problem solved?
Finally I am going to the US.

1853
01:46:07,792 --> 01:46:09,117
But I am not happy Anita.

1854
01:46:10,042 --> 01:46:10,769
Do you know why?

1855
01:46:12,167 --> 01:46:13,198
Because you are not with me.

1856
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:15,207
Anita, listen to me.

1857
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:18,778
I am not able to rejoice this without you.

1858
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:22,983
Anita, that is...

1859
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:27,460
I love you...

1860
01:46:36,345 --> 01:46:37,356
You don't want to speak anything?

1861
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:41,007
I am talking to you.

1862
01:46:42,204 --> 01:46:42,765
Will you not say anything?

1863
01:46:46,173 --> 01:46:48,575
Yes, I want to say...

1864
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:49,688
Listen...

1865
01:46:51,422 --> 01:46:54,205
You may love me, but I don't love you.

1866
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:56,521
I don't love you at all.

1867
01:46:57,333 --> 01:46:58,575
I don't like you.

1868
01:47:01,941 --> 01:47:04,071
What we did that day on
the hospital terrace...

1869
01:47:05,266 --> 01:47:07,814
we both together...
it's nothing for you, right?

1870
01:47:08,875 --> 01:47:12,333
Oh! That... I was confused.

1871
01:47:12,533 --> 01:47:15,778
Uncle's heart attack, a sleepless
night and my mind wasn't working.

1872
01:47:16,008 --> 01:47:17,207
Don't tell me all this.

1873
01:47:18,704 --> 01:47:21,146
You love me. I know you like me.

1874
01:47:21,798 --> 01:47:22,735
You do love me, Anita.

1875
01:47:24,451 --> 01:47:28,689
Okay, maybe I love you, maybe I don't.

1876
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:32,464
Whether I love you or not
is irrelevant, Kishore.

1877
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:35,204
Because there in no future
where we can live together.

1878
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:38,016
Our ways are different.

1879
01:47:38,667 --> 01:47:41,958
What different Anita?
Why don't you come with me to US?

1880
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:44,582
I will take care of you.
You can do an art course there.

1881
01:47:44,782 --> 01:47:46,374
There are very good art
college there in the US.

1882
01:47:46,574 --> 01:47:48,000
If there is love everything
is possible, Anita.

1883
01:47:48,679 --> 01:47:50,731
I promise you,
I'll take good care of you forever.

1884
01:47:52,806 --> 01:47:53,706
What is your problem?

1885
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:57,775
How did you even think that
I'll come to the US with you?

1886
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,103
You are crazy about going to the US.

1887
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:03,287
You don't even know what you
want to do after going there.

1888
01:48:03,625 --> 01:48:04,681
Did you ever think about it?

1889
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,995
No, you just adamant to go to the US.

1890
01:48:09,522 --> 01:48:12,234
Kishore, going to the US is
your dream, not our dream.

1891
01:48:12,732 --> 01:48:15,092
My life is here, my place is
this and my struggles are here!

1892
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,627
I am the only daughter for my parents.

1893
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,315
I cannot leave them and come with you.

1894
01:48:21,917 --> 01:48:24,259
I just not interested to
go to America or Nagpur.

1895
01:48:26,167 --> 01:48:28,335
You imagined me in your future plans.

1896
01:48:36,021 --> 01:48:37,192
Anita, it's not like that.

1897
01:48:37,583 --> 01:48:43,534
Kishore, just understand that love
alone cannot suffice a relationship.

1898
01:48:43,792 --> 01:48:45,635
Now and then, sacrifices are necessary.

1899
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:48,178
But none of us are
ready to do such sacrifices

1900
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:53,525
[sighs]

1901
01:48:54,583 --> 01:48:55,440
Sorry, Kishore.

1902
01:48:57,064 --> 01:48:58,441
There is absolutely no
scope of us living together.

1903
01:48:59,083 --> 01:49:02,640
You go, go and peruse your dreams.

1904
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:04,828
Good Luck!

1905
01:49:14,549 --> 01:49:15,421
I am letting go of our friendship.

1906
01:49:20,295 --> 01:49:23,751
[crying]

1907
01:49:26,879 --> 01:49:31,014
"Dear, the distance..."

1908
01:49:31,414 --> 01:49:35,373
"is a burden on me"

1909
01:49:37,868 --> 01:49:41,656
"This silence..."

1910
01:49:42,612 --> 01:49:46,057
"the second when I leave you"

1911
01:49:48,697 --> 01:49:53,352
"Ruining the relations..."

1912
01:49:54,448 --> 01:49:59,176
"...time casts its spell"

1913
01:49:59,705 --> 01:50:02,556
"Like the setting sun..."

1914
01:50:03,964 --> 01:50:08,769
"I can't leave you"

1915
01:50:10,509 --> 01:50:14,401
"Dear, the distance..."

1916
01:50:15,466 --> 01:50:19,941
"is a burden on me"

1917
01:50:22,384 --> 01:50:26,559
"The language my heart speaks..."

1918
01:50:27,846 --> 01:50:31,687
"You couldn't understand it"

1919
01:50:33,318 --> 01:50:38,219
"When your looks show anger on me..."

1920
01:50:38,419 --> 01:50:42,833
"I couldn't take it"

1921
01:50:44,173 --> 01:50:47,493
"The sorrow deep in heart..."

1922
01:50:48,632 --> 01:50:50,761
"I want to get rid of it"

1923
01:50:55,193 --> 01:50:58,995
"The dark could in my eyes..."

1924
01:51:00,142 --> 01:51:03,180
"Let it not rain"

1925
01:51:11,292 --> 01:51:13,435
Yeah, brother-in-law?
Yeah, we are starting for the airport.

1926
01:51:13,881 --> 01:51:16,516
You should have to recieve
Kishore in New York airport.

1927
01:51:16,716 --> 01:51:17,259
Okay?

1928
01:51:17,459 --> 01:51:19,085
Hey, come on... don't I know that?

1929
01:51:19,475 --> 01:51:21,157
We have packed his bag with
sweaters and jackets everthing.

1930
01:51:21,644 --> 01:51:23,741
Yes, brother-in-law I am very happy.

1931
01:51:25,162 --> 01:51:27,677
You should have to take care of
him. It's your responsibility.

1932
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,955
Come on, your game is over here.

1933
01:51:30,575 --> 01:51:32,022
Your father is setting
you a good life there.

1934
01:51:41,412 --> 01:51:42,024
Aunty...

1935
01:51:45,239 --> 01:51:45,868
Come son.

1936
01:51:48,923 --> 01:51:51,533
Aunty, I am leaving.

1937
01:51:53,935 --> 01:51:57,044
[sobbing]

1938
01:52:00,905 --> 01:52:03,370
-"The wound that doesn't pain"
-You are leaving too, son?

1939
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:09,259
"doesn't have a cure"

1940
01:52:11,531 --> 01:52:14,879
"Without a destination..."

1941
01:52:16,273 --> 01:52:19,158
"my journey can't continue"

1942
01:52:29,125 --> 01:52:31,616
What is this? Why are you
wearing his coat like a young boy?

1943
01:52:31,816 --> 01:52:32,574
Doesn't it look good?

1944
01:52:32,875 --> 01:52:34,389
-Remove it...
-Okay.

1945
01:52:35,541 --> 01:52:37,473
-Remove the coat as well.
-I am taking it off, wait.

1946
01:52:37,795 --> 01:52:38,618
[chuckles]

1947
01:52:39,033 --> 01:52:39,912
Hey, where is Anita?

1948
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:41,547
She has gone to the art show.

1949
01:52:51,375 --> 01:52:54,519
Here... is your passport safe with you?

1950
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:55,963
-Hmm...
-Take care of the dollars.

1951
01:52:56,292 --> 01:52:57,844
-Alright.
-You have your ticket, right?

1952
01:52:58,044 --> 01:52:58,929
-Yeah, I have kept everything.
-Is everything packed?

1953
01:52:59,129 --> 01:53:00,652
-I've packed everything come.
-Kishore.

1954
01:53:02,995 --> 01:53:03,584
Yes, aunty?

1955
01:53:03,833 --> 01:53:06,314
Uncle had written this letter for you.

1956
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:16,664
Dear Kishore,

1957
01:53:16,875 --> 01:53:19,014
<i>I have done a grave mistake in my life.</i>

1958
01:53:23,031 --> 01:53:25,031
<i>I sent my sons to America.</i>

1959
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:27,835
<i>I was very proud that
they were in good jobs there.</i>

1960
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:30,322
<i>I thought I was a successful father.</i>

1961
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:33,606
<i>But at the end of it, I lost my sons.</i>

1962
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:35,890
<i>We became childless.</i>

1963
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:39,704
<i>I am not a successful
father, I am a failed father.</i>

1964
01:53:40,167 --> 01:53:44,182
<i>I told them how to go to America but
did not teach them how to come back.</i>

1965
01:53:45,053 --> 01:53:46,598
<i>Who is a successful parent?</i>

1966
01:53:46,798 --> 01:53:49,365
<i>Being with children when they grew up,</i>

1967
01:53:49,565 --> 01:53:55,205
<i>one who spends his old age
with playing with grandchildren...</i>

1968
01:53:55,491 --> 01:53:58,273
<i>is the a successful parent. Not me.</i>

1969
01:53:58,667 --> 01:54:00,950
<i>When young,
children are our responsibility.</i>

1970
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:04,525
<i>But as we grow older,
we become their responsibility.</i>

1971
01:54:04,757 --> 01:54:06,602
<i>This is a very simple family value.</i>

1972
01:54:06,833 --> 01:54:10,717
<i>It's been passing down from generations
that I could not teach my sons.</i>

1973
01:54:19,917 --> 01:54:21,893
<i>It is not about sending money...</i>

1974
01:54:22,093 --> 01:54:23,178
<i>and making phone calls while
staying away in another country.</i>

1975
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:26,548
<i>That is not taking care of
parents. I did not realize this.</i>

1976
01:54:26,748 --> 01:54:30,983
<i>For all the time you
spent with us was beautiful.</i>

1977
01:54:31,183 --> 01:54:34,711
<i>I wish that your parents
don't go through the same ordeal.</i>

1978
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:36,222
Your uncle.

1979
01:54:51,208 --> 01:54:54,037
Dad, you're happy that
I am going to America?

1980
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,105
Son, aren't you happy?

1981
01:54:57,292 --> 01:54:58,076
No, dad.

1982
01:55:00,083 --> 01:55:00,920
What is this son?

1983
01:55:02,792 --> 01:55:04,611
Your dreams are finally coming true now.

1984
01:55:05,917 --> 01:55:08,331
No dad, it is not my dream.

1985
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:12,476
How can you say that?

1986
01:55:13,084 --> 01:55:15,484
You always wanted to go
to America since childhood.

1987
01:55:16,292 --> 01:55:17,418
All these are something
that I learned from you.

1988
01:55:20,166 --> 01:55:22,228
You felt very proud of watching all
the cousins who came from America.

1989
01:55:22,428 --> 01:55:25,389
And I thought I should
make you feel proud of me too.

1990
01:55:27,573 --> 01:55:30,188
The dreams where I wanted
to see you happy are actually

1991
01:55:30,624 --> 01:55:34,209
not mine, dad. It's your dreams.

1992
01:55:37,569 --> 01:55:40,687
What are my wishes when I was
young? To win in the marble games...

1993
01:55:40,887 --> 01:55:43,667
Whether or not I will be the
first one to bat such are my wishes.

1994
01:55:45,668 --> 01:55:49,610
I didn't know where Delhi was,
what would I know about America, dad?

1995
01:55:50,261 --> 01:55:54,537
I did all this because you
will be happy if you go to US.

1996
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:58,264
No, dad... I've realized,

1997
01:55:58,841 --> 01:56:00,597
that I cannot go to
America to earn dollars,

1998
01:56:01,013 --> 01:56:03,692
coming once in three years.
I cannot live away from you.

1999
01:56:07,486 --> 01:56:08,587
You don't understand it now.

2000
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,097
But when you are old, you'll need me.

2001
01:56:11,875 --> 01:56:13,150
I wonder if you can call me back.

2002
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:15,734
And even wonder if I can
come to you. I am not sure.

2003
01:56:16,167 --> 01:56:18,916
If I am with you, I'll be very
happy. I can achieve anything.

2004
01:56:20,583 --> 01:56:21,639
I don't want to go to America.

2005
01:56:22,792 --> 01:56:24,737
-I won't go to America.
-Good, my son.

2006
01:56:24,937 --> 01:56:28,860
-It's alright, you stay with us.
[sobbing]

2007
01:56:34,062 --> 01:56:34,990
-Don't cry.
-Son...

2008
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:36,034
[laughs]

2009
01:56:47,169 --> 01:56:49,193
[laughs]

2010
01:57:04,569 --> 01:57:07,857
Hey ding dong bell,
didn't I tell you he won't go?

2011
01:57:07,957 --> 01:57:08,901
-Okay.
-Take the luggage out.

2012
01:57:09,101 --> 01:57:11,255
At least shave your beard now,
I can't bear to see you like this anymore.

2013
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:14,545
Hey, talk less. Go get the vehicle, we
have to go to the art exhibition. Fast!

2014
01:57:16,515 --> 01:57:17,976
One minute.
I'll be back.

2015
01:57:23,036 --> 01:57:26,262
Hey, you're Anita, right?

2016
01:57:26,462 --> 01:57:27,719
So what is this painting about?

2017
01:57:29,667 --> 01:57:31,479
It is the story of a young sailor.

2018
01:57:32,792 --> 01:57:34,639
He has no clue of his destination.

2019
01:57:35,675 --> 01:57:38,309
And this is the reason he
is stuck in a thunderstorm.

2020
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:43,168
So, did he reach the shore?

2021
01:57:44,763 --> 01:57:47,969
No, I don't think so.

2022
01:57:48,625 --> 01:57:50,890
I believe he is lost forever

2023
01:57:51,292 --> 01:57:53,647
The idiot has lost his way.

2024
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:01,177
Will he be stuck forever in that storm?

2025
01:58:02,938 --> 01:58:04,887
Someday or the other he will
realize what he wants in his life.

2026
01:58:10,998 --> 01:58:12,739
What happened? You're back?

2027
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,854
Oh! I missed my flight.

2028
01:58:16,961 --> 01:58:21,398
So, when is your next flight?

2029
01:58:21,958 --> 01:58:24,650
I don't know. At least not in this life.

2030
01:58:25,333 --> 01:58:26,965
I am planning to try in my next life.

2031
01:58:30,885 --> 01:58:31,420
Friends?

2032
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:46,413
Yeah!

2033
01:58:46,808 --> 01:58:47,876
[laughs]

2034
01:58:48,076 --> 01:58:49,847
It was A for America,
and now it is A for Anita?

2035
01:58:50,047 --> 01:58:51,269
-Hey!
[chuckles]

2036
01:58:51,770 --> 01:58:54,805
[music mutes voices]

2037
01:59:07,395 --> 01:59:08,419
Anita...

2038
01:59:21,023 --> 01:59:22,130
She is beautiful dude.

2039
01:59:23,511 --> 01:59:26,083
Hey, what? Don't try to fool me.

2040
01:59:36,450 --> 01:59:38,120
-Wow!
-Yeah!

2041
01:59:38,455 --> 01:59:41,190
-Congractulations dude.
[laughs]

2042
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:42,334
He is lucky enough. Come on.

2043
01:59:42,534 --> 01:59:45,338
I had to practice
tonight, if I had that book.

2044
01:59:48,811 --> 01:59:49,485
Hello, Rukma sister.

2045
01:59:49,739 --> 01:59:53,688
Nothing son,
my younger daughter like guava very much.

2046
01:59:53,888 --> 01:59:57,330
I'll give some will you take
with you when you go to America?

2047
01:59:57,563 --> 01:59:58,531
I am not going to America.

2048
01:59:58,731 --> 02:00:00,916
-What, aren't you going?
-I won't go eighter.

2049
02:00:00,982 --> 02:00:02,289
<i>I wanted to stay with
my parents here itself.</i>

2050
02:00:09,712 --> 02:00:11,669
"Hey, what happened Kishore?"

2051
02:00:26,453 --> 02:00:30,917
"You'll become a fool if you go
to America and we're worried"

2052
02:00:31,761 --> 02:00:34,816
"Why do you want to
get into that trouble?"

2053
02:00:35,629 --> 02:00:40,406
"Don't go behind dollars you jackass,
stop your nonsense"

2054
02:00:40,606 --> 02:00:44,195
"You'll lose everything you have for sure"

2055
02:00:44,741 --> 02:00:48,432
"You neither get toddy there,
nor the spicy sprouts to much along"

2056
02:00:48,632 --> 02:00:51,927
"You don't get snacks for
munching, you don't get peace at all"

2057
02:00:52,127 --> 02:00:55,543
"You'll come back once in 4 years.
You go to shopping as you wake up"

2058
02:00:55,794 --> 02:00:59,353
"You'll become selfish,
and won't stay with your people"

2059
02:00:59,654 --> 02:01:04,074
"You'll become a fool if you go
to America and I am worried"

2060
02:01:04,974 --> 02:01:07,949
"Why do you want to
get into that trouble?"

2061
02:01:09,349 --> 02:01:12,866
"This is the song of
Rahul Sipligunj, baby!"

2062
02:01:14,595 --> 02:01:15,457
"Wow!"

2063
02:01:28,345 --> 02:01:30,124
"Hey, what happened Kishore?"

2064
02:01:32,556 --> 02:01:35,940
"There is no spot for drinking tea"

2065
02:01:36,698 --> 02:01:39,607
"You don't find people to chat with"

2066
02:01:39,807 --> 02:01:43,301
"There will be no Potharaju
to dance for Bonalu festival"

2067
02:01:43,976 --> 02:01:46,955
"There you won't find any lane
to place the Ganesh's statue"

2068
02:01:47,406 --> 02:01:50,985
"There would be no festivals,
there wouldn't be any friend fit for us"

2069
02:01:51,185 --> 02:01:54,557
"They wait for Green Card, if they
won't get it they live like a thief"

2070
02:01:54,757 --> 02:01:58,380
"They take stored curries
and eat however they are"

2071
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:02,117
"They sit in the washroom and
clean the rear with a tissue paper"

2072
02:02:02,367 --> 02:02:06,888
"You'll become a fool
if you go to America, oh my dude!"

2073
02:02:07,441 --> 02:02:10,558
"You're an outsider there forever"

2074
02:02:11,564 --> 02:02:16,037
"Don't go behind dollars you jackass,
stop your nonsense"

2075
02:02:16,676 --> 02:02:19,791
"You'll lose everything you have for sure"

2076
02:02:20,859 --> 02:02:24,527
[humming]

2077
02:02:33,896 --> 02:02:36,076
"Hey, how much will you
kick? Now sing the rap."

2078
02:02:36,622 --> 02:02:37,156
"Listen now!"

2079
02:02:37,356 --> 02:02:40,976
"Microsoft is here itself, if you go
to the next street there is Facebook"

2080
02:02:41,242 --> 02:02:44,740
"If you see ahead there is Google,
if you turn behind there is McDonald's"

2081
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:48,357
"If you see before you, there's Subway,
there's Starbucks for tea or coffee"

2082
02:02:48,676 --> 02:02:50,224
"If you see up there
is the owner's mother"

2083
02:02:50,424 --> 02:02:53,261
"If you want to go shopping
there's the Amezone too"

2084
02:02:53,361 --> 02:02:55,997
[laughs]
-"It's not Amezone, stupid."

2085
02:02:56,553 --> 02:02:57,412
"It's Amazon"

2086
02:03:05,236 --> 02:03:08,289
"There's no mother there to serve food"

2087
02:03:08,489 --> 02:03:11,846
"Our father wouldn't be
there to watch our backs"

2088
02:03:12,559 --> 02:03:15,556
"There wouldn't be our
own sister to tie Rakhi"

2089
02:03:15,838 --> 02:03:19,217
"There wouldn't be our
brother-in-law to have drinks"

2090
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:23,241
"They greet us and eat our food"

2091
02:03:23,441 --> 02:03:26,981
"They back stab us ultimately"

2092
02:03:27,181 --> 02:03:30,681
"No one would cook your food.
No one would wash your clothes"

2093
02:03:30,881 --> 02:03:34,360
"No one would wash your dishes and
no one would be there to comfort you"

2094
02:03:34,645 --> 02:03:39,069
"You'll become a fool if you go
to America and I am worried"

2095
02:03:39,895 --> 02:03:42,971
"The people settled there
are rushing back here"

2096
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:48,510
"Don't go behind dollars you jackass,
stop your nonsense"

2097
02:03:48,959 --> 02:03:52,106
"You'll lose everything you have for sure"
