1
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,173
You've been repeating this
for quite some time now

2
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,274
Why don't you go ahead
with the announcement?

3
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,952
Hey! l will, but first
l must get into the mood for it

4
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:52,129
Dear citizens of Koonanthuruthu island
By scoring 1st rank in his MBAexam...

5
00:03:52,265 --> 00:04:02,163
...our little town is in the limelight today
by our own darling boy, P Satyanarayanan

6
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,111
Satyanarayanan who has become
the apple of the eye of everyone here...

7
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:20,158
...is being felicitated at a function
held at our upper primary school

8
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,991
l welcome you all
to this grand event

9
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,857
Who is Satyanarayanan?

10
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,095
The son of our school peon
Narayanan Nair

11
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,832
Oh! The boy who
got into school to steal

12
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,100
Where is Narayanan Nair now?.

13
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,267
Bed ridden

14
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,111
Talking about Satyan
He is a phenomenon

15
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,114
He is an institution all by himself

16
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:53,147
Satyan is a puzzle
that can't be solved

17
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,029
All those stories were not true
He did not get into school to steal

18
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,128
Why else?

19
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,691
He got into the headmaster's room-

20
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,764
Okay, you don't have to explain
First finish coughing

21
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,677
This island, where even
a mongrel does not stray in...

22
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:19,582
...is today gearing up for
the arrival of a big brave rascal-

23
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,710
What?!

24
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,855
l mean big brave elephant...

25
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,187
...which the committee has
arranged to felicitate our hero

26
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:35,599
With crackers, band music
and array of young ladies

27
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,397
The well adorned elephant is now...

28
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,698
...elegantly and proudly on its way
bearing our most distinguished guest

29
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:49,146
The pride of this town
P Satyanarayanan

30
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,677
''King among liars''

31
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,076
''Clever and fantastic guy
Liar of liars, he's a king liar''

32
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,205
'KlNG LlAR'

33
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,646
''Where evertrapped, whateverthe snare
He just breezes out with a plan of his own''

34
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,881
''King among liars''

35
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,830
l heartily welcome Satyanarayanan
on to the dais here for his felicitation

36
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,993
Bless me

37
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,330
Dear friends

38
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:49,898
Satyanarayanan was one of the most
brilliant pupils of my class

39
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,679
Satayan, although has
touched great heights today

40
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:59,181
l am reminded of an incident
that happened years ago

41
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,288
Maybe a day our Satyan would
never want to remember

42
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,224
Get out of this school
with your dear most son

43
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,853
l swear on my mother
l did not steal, master

44
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,692
- Get lost!
- What is this master?

45
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,894
My son!
Satya!

46
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:26,102
lt was just a small forgivable
misdemeanor by a 7th grader...

47
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:31,708
...but blown out of proportion
by the stubborn headmaster, Poduval

48
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,811
But like the phoenix
that arises from its ashes

49
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:43,226
Satyanarayanan is here today,
felicitated by our Panchayat president

50
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,926
My dearest townsfolk

51
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,965
Wow!

52
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,805
Give me this!

53
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,899
Hey! l brought it
so l could garland him

54
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,102
Forward your head towards me

55
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,246
'He is Shanthan'

56
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,411
'lt was his handiwork that brought
me here to this stage'

57
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,884
Hey! Open!

58
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,149
'l will neverforget him'

59
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,986
- Can l have Rs 10
- l don't have

60
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,083
No?

61
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,386
l'll claim it later

62
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,359
Hearing Gopi master's words
a hundred memories...

63
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,368
...crashed like waves
into my thoughts

64
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,496
l like to think that my tears
caused by Poduval master years ago...

65
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,564
...are the reason for
my success today

66
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,073
l know that Poduval master who
had retired and left town years ago...

67
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:39,209
...was tried to be contacted
by the organizers of this function

68
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,550
But unfortunately
they could not find him

69
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:48,023
l sincerely wish
that our Poduval master

70
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:52,588
No...my own Poduval master
was here today

71
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,799
Who says l am not here?!

72
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,050
No one ever calls
the cunning cuckoo...

73
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,518
...a phoenix

74
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,954
Who named a big liar like you
Satyan which means truth

75
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,322
Master! This is sheer atrocity

76
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,919
You guys still believe
what this liar says?

77
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,861
What a pity!

78
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,523
Gopi sir, let him say what he wants

79
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,193
lf it gives him happiness, why not?

80
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,361
Stop it!

81
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,337
l am not here to deride him

82
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,933
But to see that
all of you are not fooled

83
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,908
Where did you study for MBA?

84
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,511
Nothing in particular

85
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,378
Tell our people sitting there

86
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,544
University college

87
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,114
Which University?

88
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,585
Maharaja's

89
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,861
There is no such university

90
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:02,624
l actually meant
Mahatma Gandhi University

91
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,296
You got a 1st rank in MBA
from Gandhi University, eh?

92
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,533
You mean you got 2nd rank?

93
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,305
This is to say
V for victory

94
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,577
Then who is this?

95
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,088
Who is it?

96
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,157
University 1st rank holder
is K Krishnakumar

97
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,092
ls it so?

98
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,187
May be there are two 1st ranks

99
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,458
l'll slap you

100
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,325
He is lying through his teeth

101
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,131
He bought the entire
newspaper supply to this island...

102
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,435
...and replaced the original
with his own photo and write up

103
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:47,410
lf this fellow passes his exam,
l swear l'll shave my head...

104
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,346
...paint spots all over me and
be paraded upon a donkey

105
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,115
MBA my foot!

106
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,279
He missed!

107
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,555
What a surprise, eh?

108
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,022
Beat him out of here
lnvited people to insult, eh?

109
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,026
'When l was insulted and
driven away from the 7th grade...'

110
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:06,724
'...l cooked up this story to make
my father's ambition come true'

111
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,331
You dog!

112
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:22,139
'When crackers are burst
some of them remain dormant'

113
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:27,143
'The ammunition in it
will remain explosive'

114
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,081
'Although my MBA plan backfired'

115
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:35,355
'l am now the vice chancellor of
many universities that award MBA degrees'

116
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,395
'Key Duplicating'

117
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,320
Peon!
Find out who's come

118
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,558
'Seal made in an 1 hour
Recharge coupons - lnternet'

119
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,123
Where is your boss?

120
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,964
Brother! ls the certificate ready?

121
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,561
The VC has to sign it

122
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,237
This looks like the wire mesh
between lndia Pakistan border

123
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,539
Well caught!
Now see that cops don't catch you

124
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,048
May lady luck be with me everyday

125
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,149
Brother?

126
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,613
Can you give me Rs 500

127
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,547
Did you not ask
for a 100 yesterday?

128
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,556
But you didn't give!

129
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,093
l am not a cash printing machine
to oblige you each time you ask

130
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,025
Make me a tea

131
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,188
Make it good, okay?

132
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,696
- l'll spit in it
- What?! Spit in it?

133
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,562
l said l'll give it in a cup

134
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,730
- l am Prashanth
-Who Prashanth?

135
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,102
Anjali's friend

136
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,334
Anjali's friend?

137
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,376
Of course l remember

138
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,808
Can we come and meet you?

139
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,538
No! Don't!
l was about to go out

140
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,584
- l'll wait
- No, l am busy till 2

141
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,674
l'll see you after 2

142
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,448
Okay!
ls it?

143
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,421
- No...
- l'll come to Omega

144
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,784
Okay

145
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,616
- See you
- Okay

146
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,523
God!

147
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,720
Antappa!

148
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,523
Anjali's friends are
on their way here

149
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,723
They want my help it seems

150
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,196
Brother! Are you jobless?

151
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,632
You've been afterthat
useless girl for so long

152
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,828
Ask her to get lost, bro

153
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,163
Anjali! Snob to the core

154
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,469
You'll get better girls if you wanted

155
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,409
Sure l will
But they won't be like Anjali

156
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,270
She belongs to me

157
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,176
l feel she's mine since many births

158
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,547
Then go ahead and help them

159
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,246
They are not coming
for a fake certificate or seal

160
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,843
Then?

161
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,612
Some sort of recommendation from me

162
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,658
l had lied to them saying l was
the manager of Omega consultancy upstairs

163
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,784
ls that all?
Simply face it

164
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,361
That baldy is under
your control, right?

165
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,087
What?

166
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,222
That bald managerfellow
is obliged to you, isn't he?

167
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,458
Go and convince him

168
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,761
- Shall l?
- Sure you can

169
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,197
-What is my name?
-What?

170
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,204
What was the name
l had told Anjali?

171
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,400
Oh! That!
ls it Narendran or Naran?

172
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,475
Look

173
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,706
Anjali...yes
Here it is...Naran

174
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,878
- Here, drink this tea
-Aren't you having?

175
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,118
No, you have it
Let your muscles bulge

176
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,312
lf only l had known
l wouldn't have spat into it

177
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,889
No! l won't budge
from this seat

178
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,618
- Not even for 10 minutes?
- No

179
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,630
Then you don't do

180
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,289
What the heck are you up to

181
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,460
l slogged 3 days to prepare
this report to be sent to Delhi

182
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,802
Tell me it's color

183
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,503
Red

184
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,131
Oh red!

185
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,643
Well dressed and
shamelessly says this is red

186
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,711
-What about this?
- That's white

187
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,374
And this?
Blue

188
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,682
Yellow is green
and green is blue

189
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,516
And an orange is wood apple for you
Now get up from that seat

190
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,556
- No
- No?

191
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,420
Okay, then l will shout
out truths about you

192
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,287
What truths?

193
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,226
The fact that you can't decipher colors

194
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,264
That in spite of being color blind
l gave you a fake fitness certificate

195
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,232
And that l supplied
the duplicate certificate

196
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,600
Cheating, chicanery, fraudulence
court cases, compensation, and thus...!

197
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,798
Tell me what do you want?

198
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,632
Speak clearly

199
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:41,572
You close my mouth and nose
and want me to speak clearly?

200
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,205
Tell me what do you want?

201
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,547
Your coat, the tie and
the manger's swivel chair

202
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,249
-Your guests
-Ask them to come in

203
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,226
l used to look like a cowherd
Hasn't it changed now?.

204
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,927
Sure, now you look
like a cowherd with a coat

205
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,395
What to do! l gave the cowhand
from my hometown a job

206
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,939
Why are you in the corridor
minus your coat and tie?

207
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,209
lt's too hot in there

208
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,652
Sunita, orange suits you very well

209
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,618
Really!

210
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,816
Goodness! Was it green
by any chance?

211
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,498
Bannerji associates never
accept any form of recommendation

212
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,932
Since your consultancy
are on good terms with them

213
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:14,405
You may have a good chance
on my recommendation, Prashant

214
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,499
But why should l?

215
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,839
l don't even know you

216
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,879
We are very close to Anjali

217
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,381
But Anjali has not said anything

218
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,748
She is a feeling a little...?

219
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,582
You mean embarrassed?

220
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,318
l may be wealthy
but an ordinary man

221
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,659
lt was with yourfinancial help grandmother's
ear surgery went off well, sir

222
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,595
He was the one
who helped with the bills

223
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,936
Now she can see very well

224
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,599
But wasn't the surgery forthe ear?

225
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,871
But you need the earlobe
to wear glasses, isn't it?

226
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,350
Sir, she is being discharged
from hospital today

227
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,791
You had promised
to give me Rs 1000

228
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,931
l remember...very well

229
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,747
Hey! But of what use is this?

230
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,578
Collect Rs 25,000 from the cashier

231
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,482
Tell him l said so, go ask him

232
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,078
You can buy your grandma,
betel leaves with the remaining money

233
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,017
She has been so good
to me all these years

234
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,022
l'll make a prayer

235
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,522
Ask Anjali to contact me

236
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,782
Anjali, what have you decided?

237
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,409
l told you my decision

238
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,511
Firstly, l don't like him
following me around

239
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,819
And to ask him for a favor
will only worsen the scene

240
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,054
But if his recommendation clicks
it will be a great chance for me

241
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,025
lf it doesn't?

242
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,688
Call him first, my dear

243
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,923
Please sis

244
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,067
For my sake
Call him

245
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,107
Yes, they had come

246
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,974
The owner of Bannerji Associates
Sunil Sheddy...

247
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,879
...l mean Sunil Bannerji
is a friend of mine

248
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,451
Our friendship dates back to years

249
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,751
He obliges me
l have made use of him too

250
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,451
But he is a bit loose these days

251
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,790
No, l know how
to wring him for favors

252
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,093
Yes, l mean l can get him to help
But he must be handled carefully

253
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,134
Never know when he'll change
and show his true colors

254
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:01,605
We friends call him
the 'king of inner chambers'

255
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,872
You won't understand
if l explain over the phone

256
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,003
We will meet

257
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,773
l am still washing

258
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,616
l mean...l'm in the middle of a deal
with a laundering company...

259
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,154
...a detergent company

260
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,555
So we meet tomorrow
Call yourfriends also

261
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,629
Antappa?

262
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,464
-What is this dude?
-Always watching such trash!

263
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,065
Have a look at this

264
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,039
There are pictures
of big shots in this

265
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,110
ls that all?
l thought it was something spicy

266
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,974
-What a one track mind
-What?

267
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:45,812
Dude, these are photos
of business men who deal in millions

268
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,887
l want you to create pictures
of me hugging them

269
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:53,686
Posing this way, laughing out loud
taking a selfie and many such photos

270
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,557
lt must look as if taken together
with them at the same place

271
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,895
Wait for a minute
l'll be back

272
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,130
Where can l keep this?

273
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,729
Come here a second
Please hold the ball

274
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,795
- Ball?
- l mean the bat

275
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,841
Sorry, mistaken you

276
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,876
Oh, is this a way too
to use the loo?

277
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,573
He is Sunil Bannerji,
you were talking about

278
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:25,653
But misusing this bond
for such trivial favors...

279
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,918
...l don't like that

280
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,858
Him?

281
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,966
'Wonder who the devil he is?'

282
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,565
Him?
You tell me who he is?

283
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,174
Anand Varma

284
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,904
You are right...Anand Varma

285
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,842
Do you really recognize him?
Tell me if you really know

286
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,010
ls there anyone in the fashion field
who does not know Anand Varma?

287
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:02,054
Anand Varma and his wife Devika
are the king and queen of fashion world

288
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,766
Do you know him personally?

289
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,133
l would like to very much
But have not been lucky enough

290
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,634
She was almost one among finalists
at the ramp selection Varma conducted

291
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,644
That ruined all her confidence
and that's how she left modeling...

292
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,910
...and shifted career
to information technology

293
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,816
Oh Manohar

294
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,917
Anju...just 5 minutes

295
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,292
'Wasn't my timing perfect?'

296
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,700
Antappa! First time you are
doing something perfectly

297
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,135
-What are we having for lunch?
- Sardine curry

298
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,577
Sardine?

299
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,040
'You think we'll get
a dolphin for petty cash?'

300
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,888
You have many photos
with celebrities

301
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,123
So you saw all of them?

302
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,163
l was not too keen

303
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:21,137
But when they insist
l can't avoid

304
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,369
This one?

305
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,845
Was this also taken like that?

306
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,638
Madame Tussaud wax museum

307
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,231
London

308
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,366
Don't you know?.

309
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,877
This is actually
a wax figure of Gandhiji

310
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,410
When l once went there
they forced me to take a picture

311
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,115
You really misunderstood
me, didn't you?

312
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,720
Let's get back to Prashanth
Your interview is tomorrow, right?

313
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,451
Yes

314
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,457
When you go, attach
a black badge on your chest

315
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,257
One of the board members
will ask you the reason for it

316
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:26,736
You must tell them,
your close friend Satyan died

317
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,267
Don't worry
That's a coded message

318
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,470
lt will be a guy from my side
lt was him l was speaking to now

319
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,976
l am not giving you
cent percent assurance

320
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,886
l am expecting
a thanks from you

321
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,323
But still, how could you
about Gandhiji...?

322
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,389
Antappan! Vagabond!

323
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,968
Sorry bro! l needed
the Rs 500 urgently

324
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,699
- lt's not that you pork!
- Then?

325
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,241
Why did you put
my picture with Gandhiji?

326
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,334
You wanted me to be creative

327
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,504
What answer will l give people?

328
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,942
Say you took it when you
went to Rahul Gandhi's house

329
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,040
How are they related?

330
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,484
lsn't Rahul Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhiji's son?

331
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,951
- Sorry, his brother
- Brother?!

332
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,855
No, l meant brother-in-law

333
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,054
Not only that! A bearded guy,
some Varma of fashion designs

334
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,061
Who are all of them?

335
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,995
They were in the book you gave me

336
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,730
l am forgiving you now

337
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,393
You hit me
Most unfair

338
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,238
How dare you take
money from my wallet

339
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,329
Sorry, brother

340
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,334
Coming to kill me?

341
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,536
- l'lljump
- Don'tjump

342
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,769
Your other creative works
were very good

343
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,372
The selfie with the Pope

344
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,282
You oaf!

345
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,909
They were foolish and believed it

346
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,418
Will any sane person believe that?

347
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,319
l will never do anything for you ever

348
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,412
You won't, eh?

349
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,017
You simply asked for that

350
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,460
Never ask again
l am quite tired

351
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,996
l have a bit of good news

352
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,504
Bannerji associates
have adopted me

353
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,038
Fantastic dude

354
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:10,971
We must celebrate

355
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,272
Notjust celebrate
We must have a blast

356
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,037
Yes

357
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,772
Let's begin with ice cream now

358
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,042
Wait a while
Before we celebrate

359
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,947
Call Naran and tell him thanks

360
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,916
What for?

361
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,386
How do you know it was
because of his recommendation?

362
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,513
Don't be ungrateful

363
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,387
They even asked
about the black badge

364
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,892
Call him anyways

365
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,588
l know what will happen

366
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,056
He will talk 2 lines
to Prashant for a formality

367
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,226
Then he will ask for me

368
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,428
Now he has the freedom
to flirt with me

369
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,563
And finally
l love you

370
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,976
Hello Anjali

371
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,205
l'll give it to Prashanth

372
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,891
Sorry, a problem with the blue tooth

373
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,221
You deserve the post

374
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,595
They know that otherwise
l won't recommend

375
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,630
Shall l give the phone to Anjali

376
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,302
No! Not necessary

377
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,536
Not now

378
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,003
l am a bit busy
Ask her to call me later

379
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,079
lf l am free, l'll talk to her

380
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,843
Will you be free today evening
We are having a small party

381
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,185
Do you want to go to the hospital?

382
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,382
-Why?
-You mentioned blood pressure

383
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,425
Not pressure
lt's pleasure

384
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:40,096
l don't think he is as bad
as you make him out to be

385
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,668
You shouldn't have been so abrupt

386
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,132
You could have flirted
a little with Anjali

387
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,505
She belongs to
the 'female' class of beings

388
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,044
90 percent of them
on such occasions...

389
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,137
...with friends, switch on
the speaker phone

390
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,077
Do you know that?

391
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,216
You can have this

392
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,249
Thank you bro

393
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,444
Don't touch it

394
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,882
This l can safely drink

395
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,320
l am sure now
you've not spat in it

396
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,152
l have sold fellows like you
and collected cash man

397
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,625
Let me have a hundred

398
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,219
Get lost!

399
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,371
Antappa, you can have this milk

400
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,373
'l don't want it
l saw you spit into it'

401
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,943
We can give to some other customers, right?

402
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,276
Wonder if that boy got thejob?

403
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,472
The arrow found its target

404
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,673
What?
l don't understand

405
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,547
Don't we tell candidates to write
the exams and we'd do the rest...

406
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,382
...to get them a graduate certificate
and collect a fee?

407
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,614
How do we function?

408
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,520
Without us doing anything
many of them will pass by themselves

409
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,288
Since we return the money
of those who don't get through...

410
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,590
...we don't earn a bad name
This is also like that

411
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,359
What about the black badge?

412
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,424
lf we stick a black badge
and go to any place...

413
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,230
...someone is bound
to ask what it is?

414
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,271
Wouldn't a person
hearing about death...

415
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,137
...pray for his soul?

416
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:02,577
lf people in that interview board
prayed for my soul, will it botheryou?

417
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,979
Not at all! Then l also
could have said l was dead

418
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:13,586
Bro, didn't you say girls use speakers
on phones when we talk to them?

419
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,353
ls it true?

420
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,121
Why?

421
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:21,361
l talk to that Sushma in the hostel

422
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,468
Does she share with her friends
what l was doing?

423
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,738
Of course not!
Go ahead and continue to sleep

424
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,066
l was so stressed
out for a minute

425
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,073
So you are the rascal who
shoots up my phone bill?

426
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,275
Must be that cheap girl Sushma

427
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,481
Frustrated that Antappan's call
had still not come

428
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,658
No reply?

429
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,758
Not at all
l am quite free

430
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,996
Now?.
No problem

431
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,000
Where?

432
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,540
Message me the place
and l am there

433
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,639
- ls it Sushma?
-You...!

434
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,542
Okay, l know
lt's my grandmother

435
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,170
Anjali

436
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,376
- She wants to meet me
- ls it?

437
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,416
Take out the vehicle

438
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,577
What?
l said get the vehicle!

439
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,280
Hey! l will
Why scream?!

440
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:17,787
What kind of place is this?

441
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,582
- Message says 'Kamaraj lane'
- Matches the name

442
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:22,785
Let's look on the other side

443
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,125
Look! There they are

444
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,428
We were looking out for you

445
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,330
When l started, l found
my car had a flat tyre

446
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,836
You guys said it was urgent
so l got him to take his bike

447
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,370
Good thing! We are very worried
wondering what to do

448
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,339
What happened?

449
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:39,701
Come

450
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,605
l'll call back later

451
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,044
Appears all of you are here
What is the issue?

452
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:47,709
Any one dead?

453
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,481
Mr Naran, please sit down

454
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,318
There was a scuffle in the club
and they are in trouble now

455
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,483
l had told you about
a party Prashant hosted, didn't l?

456
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,187
We had a problem there

457
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,254
From the time we arrived
there was this guy harassing Mili

458
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,265
We requested him
a couple of times to lay off

459
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,357
But he didn't bother

460
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,629
John lost his temper
and shoved him away

461
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,102
Not shoved

462
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,236
He beat him up
good and proper

463
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:14,772
Later we came to know he was
the son of minister Thomas Chennikad

464
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,107
And in this scuffle, they dragged
Faisal into their vehicle and drove off

465
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,811
Faisal had called sometime back
They made him call and tell us

466
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,478
They want John

467
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,556
Only if we send John
Faisal will be let off

468
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,784
They said they'd kill us
if we informed the police

469
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,792
But tell me, what am l supposed
to do in this?

470
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,456
Naran, you must make a call

471
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,528
Who should l call?

472
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:40,331
The other day, we saw pictures
of you with the minister's son

473
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,736
You must call the minister

474
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,109
l can call

475
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,807
But l can't say how
effective it will be

476
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:56,252
Knowing him well
he's very stubborn

477
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,653
-A peculiar nature
-Yes, absolute trash

478
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,191
Please don't say no
Help us

479
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,591
Sure, l'll help
l must...l will

480
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,287
But no need to call Chennikad

481
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,732
l'll make high command Thripati talk to him

482
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,302
Can l have a room for myself

483
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,666
Brother needs to use the toilet

484
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,831
Not for that
l want to make a call

485
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,409
Close the door

486
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,774
Oh God! ln my enthusiasm
l got into this muddle

487
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,904
Now what do we do?

488
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,541
But you said you'd call
the high command Thripati?

489
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,175
What high command?

490
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,310
Oh! That was a lie, eh?

491
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,583
lf you don't know a high command
then call some low rogues you know

492
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:32,879
Gotcha!

493
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,415
Abhasa editor
Aratupuzha Sashikumar speaking

494
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,555
l am Krishnankutty speaking

495
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,257
Key! Sweetie Kriku!

496
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,832
lt's been ages since
l heard from you

497
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,267
Brother, have any spicy news
about our minister Chennikad

498
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,430
His favorite Alsatian dog
had puppies recently

499
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:54,376
One of them looks exactly like him
and l am publishing a story on that

500
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,434
Stopjoking

501
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,981
Tell me if he is involved
in cases of molestation, pimping...?

502
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,344
ln a house behind
Kayamkulam Krishnapuram palace...

503
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:06,515
...something fishy is happening
during the nights

504
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,250
ls it?

505
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,885
We don't know if it involves
printing notes, or immoral activities

506
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,757
But on the whole
there's plenty of smoke

507
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,921
Okay brother

508
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,703
l am the minister's personal assistant
Who's calling?

509
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,433
Tell him it's Shivakumarfrom Delhi
Chennikad will understand

510
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,939
Sir, a call from Delhi

511
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,005
l'll call back, okay?

512
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,645
l wanted to talk to you
on a personal note

513
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,409
Some kids l know had
a small issue with your son

514
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,819
Small issue?
l won't spare any of them

515
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,917
That's up to you
But it's a trap to ensnare you

516
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,359
Who the hell are you
to talk about all this?

517
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,727
You don't know my true nature

518
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,394
- lf l don't get that boy...!
- But there's a small problem

519
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,300
The boy's home
is at Kayamkulam

520
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,269
On the east side
of Krishnapuram palace-

521
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,711
Can you hear me?

522
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,643
Why did you cut that call?

523
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,948
l did not cut it
l just tossed him a bait

524
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,648
-Will he bite?
- He will

525
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,718
Maybe he will, eh?

526
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,952
He must, mustn't he?

527
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,921
Look who it is?

528
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,054
Tea

529
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,957
No thanks
This is not tea time

530
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,926
He's talking to Thripati

531
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,366
No need to worry at all

532
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:30,533
lf that doesn't work out
l too have a plan charted out

533
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,776
What's up?
Did he bite?

534
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,403
What plan were
you talking about?

535
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,505
Nothing
Just a drama

536
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,515
Damn your drama

537
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,381
Did he bite?

538
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:45,649
- Dude! He just did
- Didn't l tell you he will?!

539
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,392
Who is it?

540
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:50,919
lt's me

541
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,961
Me?

542
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,328
Who me?

543
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,289
l know only one me and that's me
And that me is me

544
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,698
And that me is sitting right here

545
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,965
So when you say me, which me
is that me who l have no idea about?

546
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,767
Didn't you hear me?
Who is that me

547
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,432
May be it's me

548
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,100
Don't you dare
confuse matters

549
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,313
Just when he's biting the bait

550
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,312
Hello, who is it?

551
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,349
lt's me, minister Chennikadan

552
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,544
Sorry! We got disconnected

553
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:19,089
What l was saying was,
if you torture that boy...

554
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,450
...you are asking fortrouble

555
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,653
And these TV channels are
waiting for some spicy tid-bits

556
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:29,564
- Krishnapuram palace-
-Ask them not to harm the boy

557
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:35,639
And then to clean up this issue
who would say no to may be Rs 50000?

558
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,435
l'll message you
the place we meet

559
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:42,544
What happened?

560
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,713
lt will be solved
lt must

561
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,445
They do no bird can soar
higher than worth of money

562
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,679
Not bird...its eagle

563
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:53,154
Eagle is also a bird...not a fish
When l am speaking seriously, you...!

564
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,586
l had to spend a little
They talk only in millions

565
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,788
Don't let that be an issue
We can share the expenses

566
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:03,162
What are you saying Lakshmi?
Your problem is mine too

567
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,062
Have you read books written
by Gabriel Garcia de Fernandes?

568
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,001
Do you know what he says?
They wouldn't have read

569
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,540
They wouldn't have read
Brother, just tell them

570
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,108
'lnterfering dog'

571
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,372
He has said a lot of things

572
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,540
Should we talk of that
or about the issue we have?

573
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,885
You have fixed the value
of my friendship in terms of money

574
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,821
We did not mean that actually

575
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,894
No, never say things
you don't intend to say

576
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,761
Do you know a true friend
is prepared to lay down his life?

577
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,730
Sorry, l have your ring
lt must have slipped off

578
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,001
Hey! What's that for?

579
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,065
l was just ululating

580
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:46,906
For what?

581
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,740
Exchanging rings
like an engagement

582
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,007
That will come later
After choosing auspicious moment

583
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,018
Our problem has not been solved yet

584
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,122
Until Faisal comes back
in one piece, we can't be relieved

585
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,452
We have a place to visit

586
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,089
l have explained to Sethbhai
Take them inside, l'll be here

587
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,856
Quick!

588
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,624
Don't worry
Chennikad will soon be here

589
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,128
Lakshmi, please take care

590
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,735
Now you can stop acting
as if you are stressed

591
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,968
This is not acting

592
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,135
l am actually quite tense

593
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,576
Okay stop raising my BP
Touch one of them

594
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,604
Touch one of these fingers

595
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:25,776
Touch

596
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,115
Okay, no need to worry
They'll soon be here with Faisal

597
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,155
How do you know?

598
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,985
lt's your lucky times
That's why you chose that finger

599
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,719
lf it had been the other one
l had just picked my nose with it

600
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,795
Look! They are here

601
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,662
Faisal, go inside
Yourfriends are waiting there

602
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,260
The minister wanted to meet John

603
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,735
l will show them John
Be brave, l'll deal with it

604
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,910
Greetings
l am John

605
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:55,775
Come inside

606
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,178
Since you are the minister
no need to worry about checking

607
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,716
Sir, move in and pour me a couple

608
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,251
We can drink and talk as we drive

609
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,708
Joey, you can begin

610
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,584
l didn't mean this, sir

611
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,281
Will you ever mention this again?

612
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,923
l've never been to Krishnapuram, sir

613
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,221
l'll show you really who l am

614
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,590
Someone help me, please

615
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,102
Throw him down

616
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,166
Damn your shoe

617
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,737
Start the car

618
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,274
You must learn to be grateful

619
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,937
Never knew Krishnapuram palace
had so much scope for punches

620
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,945
Lucky, no one saw me

621
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,106
Antappa?

622
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,150
-Which vagabond is it?
- lt's me, vagabond

623
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,081
lt's you, bro?

624
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,210
Why is the gate closed
Where are those kids?

625
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,687
l insisted they leave
ls your meeting over so quickly?

626
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,315
Dialogs were very few

627
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,993
Didn't l tell you this
was your best time?

628
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:48,296
Show me the finger
you never used to pick your nose

629
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,893
When you left, l used that also

630
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,767
That does not matter
This is the lucky finger, right?

631
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,703
l used it once

632
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,705
Stop the horn
The place is closed

633
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,012
Antony, deal with this case

634
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,784
-Antappa, we are in trouble
- Haven't you worn your seat belt?

635
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,080
Seat belt in a bike, eh?

636
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,621
-What else?
- We've had booze

637
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,190
They'll make us blow

638
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,852
Bro, just pretend to blow
l'll do a dubbing act from behind

639
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,620
What?

640
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,993
Just act as if you are blowing
l'll give the right sound

641
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,190
Brother

642
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,760
lf you don't mind
Please blow into this

643
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,326
Blow

644
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:38,937
lt was a good effort

645
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,382
But brother at the back
missed the cue

646
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,016
What is all this dude?
Was it born to a spotted deer?

647
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,919
Please blow again
Let me see

648
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,751
Sorry sir, his uncle who died
is seriously ill in hospital

649
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,693
Whaaaa...t?

650
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,197
l mean, his uncle who
was seriously ill died suddenly

651
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,767
We are rather stressed and
so had a couple of drinks...

652
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,632
...on our way to hospital to get the body

653
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,695
Please sir, for God's sake don't harass us

654
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,032
Okay...go
Carry on

655
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,039
Thank you, sir

656
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,704
You dare show me your finger?!

657
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,643
Not to you

658
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,254
As if what you got wasn't enough

659
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,135
Goodness! Oh mother
Telepathy!

660
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,932
What?!
Elippani, you mean brain fever?

661
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,438
Your grandpa has caught brain fever!

662
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,834
My dear chap, telepathy

663
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,035
The minute l said good night
She replied...look

664
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,339
A picture message

665
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,313
That girl is a cross you
will be burdened with

666
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,677
Haven't you had enough?

667
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,742
ln times of distress even your
trouser rope will be a serpent

668
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,843
Stop it snake-man!

669
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,684
Stuff your finger underyou
and go sit elsewhere

670
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:53,955
Go!

671
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,889
l am going
All for a photo!

672
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,360
How he changes color
He's like a chameleon

673
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:07,996
My first kiss on your
beautiful right eye

674
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,199
Who's this watching me kiss?

675
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,934
Haven't l seen him somewhere?

676
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,973
Poduval master?

677
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:27,012
So Anjali...?

678
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,350
Oh my God!

679
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,331
Has he gone mad?

680
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,836
Yes man!
l have gone mad

681
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,398
Open your eyes and look at him

682
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,171
Hey! Were you kissing this old man?

683
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,843
Sorry, tastes differ
You continue

684
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,405
Antappa! Now l can
tolerate anything

685
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,111
l now know God is with me

686
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,780
ls that a picture of God?
Does he wear glasses?

687
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,085
You oaf! This bespectacled man
is Poduval master

688
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:04,059
His daughter is my Anjali

689
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,720
ls he a millionaire?

690
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,996
Usually people jump in joy
when they find their in-laws are rich

691
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:13,263
Millionaire?
He is just nothing for good

692
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,235
The guy who ruined my whole life

693
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:19,331
You idiot! You never believed me
when l said Anjali did not feel like...

694
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,004
...a stranger even though
l met her recently

695
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:22,977
Escaped from his hit

696
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:27,347
l was right all along
lt wasn't recently that l met her

697
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,484
My Anjali!

698
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,021
Tell me
When did you actually meet?

699
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,222
Give me a minute
Let me get my breath back

700
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:43,026
Flashbacks are usually boring
Can you condense it and tell me?

701
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,067
Everything began at Koonanthuruthu

702
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,438
At the most beautiful village
called Koonanthuruthu, right?

703
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:53,935
How do you knowthat?

704
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,036
All flashbacks begin that way

705
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,876
They will all be beautiful villages

706
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,916
But Koonanthuruthu...

707
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,980
...was exceptionally lovely

708
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,282
'l studied at the Koonanthuruthu
Upper Primary school'

709
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,021
'My father was the peon
in that school'

710
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,096
l have a doubt, brother

711
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,030
Did you really go to school?

712
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,238
l was the best student

713
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,803
Be quite bro, this is
what everyone says

714
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:31,405
That they were 1st rank holders in nursery
and failed in 10th grade because of illness

715
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,847
Well, continue brother
Quite fun to hear such tales

716
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,818
Well, l stopped
l am not saying any more

717
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,411
You can't sulk

718
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,921
lf you interfere like this

719
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,084
Okay, l won't
Now tell

720
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,194
l wasn't lying when l said
l used to study well

721
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,129
l was even the school leader

722
00:42:53,270 --> 00:43:00,972
''Creator of beautiful flowers
and lovely butterflies on earth''

723
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:05,410
'When l was in the 7th grade
Poduval master was transferred...'

724
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,076
'...to our school as the new headmaster'

725
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:14,153
'As he stepped out of the car
he reminded me of a vulture'

726
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,453
Behind him, stepped out
a little butterfly

727
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:23,090
What?! How did that happen?

728
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,156
Not a real one idiot

729
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:24,996
Then?

730
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,435
'A beautiful girl got out...'

731
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,642
'...holding her mother's hand'

732
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,203
Say the oath dude

733
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:42,079
lndia is my country

734
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,019
All lndians are
my brothers and sisters

735
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:50,424
The day l met her
l found out one...sorry 3 things

736
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,328
One that she was mine forever

737
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,962
Secondly, we can't consider
all girls as our sisters

738
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,092
And the 3rd?

739
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:02,571
That Poduval master was
God of death to me

740
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,108
Poke your hand

741
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:10,645
He ruled the school like
ldi Amin did in Uganda

742
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,909
Was ldi Hameed a minister?

743
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,185
l forgot the poem l learnt master

744
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,050
Forgot?
This is the best medicine

745
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,347
Next
Raise your hand

746
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,720
Come

747
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:29,328
(God's prayer)

748
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,565
Don't act too smart

749
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,259
How many marks you got?

750
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,446
Enough, don't beat her anymore

751
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,245
- She got at least 48 on 50, didn't she?
- l'll give you one also

752
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,219
48? Do you know how much
that peons son scored?

753
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,312
Full 50 upon 50

754
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,381
Need to punish her

755
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,652
- Don't scream
- Don't hit me, father

756
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,594
l'll kill you

757
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,426
Let go of her

758
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:45,002
Hereafteryou will never get
beaten for getting lesser marks than me

759
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,040
- How is that?
- There is a way

760
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,042
l am a bachelor

761
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,338
Go to class

762
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,203
How did you drop
to second place, Satya?

763
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,674
You first wrote the correct answer
Then struck it off to write the wrong one

764
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,769
You must be more careful my boy

765
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,423
That year she committed
a big blunder in half term math exam

766
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:38,256
What is that?

767
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:43,857
lt was when we compared answers
we found the blunder in math

768
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,628
l did it correct

769
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,163
Did you get these two right?

770
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,104
Which one?

771
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,675
The 9th and 10th questions

772
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,768
This one

773
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,414
Why are you crying?

774
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,747
l did not answer these questions

775
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,584
l missed this side
of the question paper

776
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,590
What happened dear?

777
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,286
Who was it?

778
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,258
Who?

779
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,794
The guy who asked that?
Was he Poduval's henchman?

780
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,764
You are always going at a tangent
Concentrate on the main subject

781
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,099
Of course l will
Tell me what happened next?

782
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,604
Father will kill me
when l get back the papers

783
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,265
People are staring

784
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,376
Don't cry, please
We'll find a way

785
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,577
Everything moved all these days
as l planned, didn't it?

786
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,807
This will also be like that

787
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,109
How?.

788
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,319
Poduval master?

789
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,378
Headmaster?

790
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,456
Who is it?

791
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,205
Open up

792
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,342
Open the door l say

793
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:41,445
Open l say
Or we'll kick it open

794
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,585
What are you doing here?

795
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:47,881
Come out here

796
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,219
Move

797
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,774
Why did you get into
the office at night, Satya?

798
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,478
Answer me
Why did you get into the office?

799
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,520
To steal

800
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,782
The scholarship money and school fees
were kept in the cupboard

801
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,757
He opened the very same cupboard

802
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,555
What am l seeing
and hearing my boy?

803
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,653
l swear on my mother
l have not stolen, master

804
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,494
Only 2 people know about the money

805
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:35,903
l have enough sense to know
how he got his hands on the keys

806
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,339
We are not dumb, okay?

807
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:40,910
Master, please don't
say such things

808
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,571
You don't like me saying it
But you have no issues doing it

809
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,808
Take your darling son and
get out from this school

810
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,010
Don't you dare step in here again
Take him away

811
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,049
Go away instead of gaping

812
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,650
What happened afterthat, bro?

813
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,358
What can happen?

814
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,988
My father's life continued at Papanangode
and Poduval ruined my life

815
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,831
He underlined in red
my character certificate...

816
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,529
...and l was shunted to Kollangode

817
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,868
l fail to understand, even in movies
why the hero won't explain matters...

818
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,839
...to the heroine and solve the issue

819
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,934
Couldn't you have explained to Anjali

820
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,809
What was in your mouth...hot potatoes?

821
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,611
Oaf! When we were wondering
whether to leave town or commit suicide...

822
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,517
...and you expect me
to go explain to her?

823
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,713
And as if she would believe it

824
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,983
My own father did not believe me

825
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,585
Do you think this Poduval
will allow you to marry her?

826
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,455
Don't say Poduval again

827
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,992
l'll kill him
and then l'll marry his girl

828
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:38,898
And?

829
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,596
l'll kill her also

830
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,333
l'll smother her with
my love and kill her

831
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:10,065
''l rowed across an ocean of lies
to anchor nearyou...yesterday''

832
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:17,497
''Cunning liar that you are, yet
sweet like a ripe mango...bluff-master''

833
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,810
''How sweet are pretences?''

834
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,574
''Like sipping nectar in delight''

835
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,878
''For that you must be
beside me...like this''

836
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:37,059
''l rowed across an ocean of lies
to anchor nearyou...yesterday''

837
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:45,457
''Cunning liar that you are, yet
sweet like a ripe mango...bluff-master''

838
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,976
This want to give to someone
but not for Sumati teacher

839
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:13,553
''Crept into your heart in secret
Once upon a time this liar fervor''

840
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:24,397
''Taking shyness away in his wake
lf only it could come back again''

841
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,139
''What will you do
lf l come near you?''

842
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,611
''l'll catch and bind you
inside my heart''

843
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:43,992
''l rowed across an ocean of lies
to anchor nearyou...yesterday''

844
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:52,697
''Cunning liar that you are, yet
sweet like a ripe mango...bluff-master''

845
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:31,506
''Hidden in memories of a young girl
A little sweetheart who played in mud''

846
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:42,518
''To be with you, tender little girl
This mischievous imp often wished''

847
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:47,889
''lt's cold and chilly out there''

848
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:54,023
''Won't you smother deceit
hidden within a coverlet?''

849
00:53:55,865 --> 00:54:02,498
''l rowed across an ocean of lies
to anchor nearyou...yesterday''

850
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:10,639
''Cunning liar that you are, yet
sweet like a ripe mango...bluff-master''

851
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,087
l could not say
even a 'thank you' to you

852
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,321
l was about to call you
this morning

853
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,155
But thought you
wouldn't be awake

854
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,564
We are having
a party this evening

855
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:35,660
You mustjoin us

856
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,207
Please make it fortomorrow

00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,108
What about at 11 in the morning?

860
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,805
Can you come at 9?

861
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:47,547
What about 10?

862
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,812
Okay at 10

863
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,355
lt was Naran
Says lets have the party tomorrow

864
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,615
He wants to tell me
something important today

865
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,262
Sir, your order?

866
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,301
l'll need it later
Now my stomach is on fire

867
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,261
Come here

868
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,080
Good taste
Wonder whose left over it was

869
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,990
''l waited for very long
For this day to dawn''

870
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,028
''Memories so sweet
l have of this smiling face''

871
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:37,225
''Like a rainbow you come today
Always to me a magical wonder''

872
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:42,964
''ls itjust a wishful dream?
Let me pinch myself to make sure''

873
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:48,905
''Like a beautiful peacock feather
treasured between pages of my heart''

874
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,272
What happened?

875
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,255
Why are you staring like this?

876
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,820
Let me look at you

877
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,088
''Like a drop of mist
Your smile so radiant''

878
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,164
You said you wanted
to tell me something?

879
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,929
l'll tell you, but let me
gaze at you for a while

880
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,704
Okay, since you are
not saying anything...

881
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,141
...let me give you a surprise

882
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,235
Okay

883
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,177
My father is here to meet you

884
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,148
Let him come
Let all fathers come

885
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,014
l wanted you to come at 10:30
so that l could come with him

886
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,145
Dad had some work in the bank

887
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,356
-Who?
- Father

888
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,357
Father?

889
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,259
Where is he?

890
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:39,293
Right here

891
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,421
Appears you are a bit stressed

892
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,429
Who?
Me? Of course not

893
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:49,438
When your dad comes
wondering how he looks

894
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:55,342
l mean how l look
whether to get up in respect

895
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,743
You knowthe relief

896
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,872
Hey! That was vinegar

897
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:09,324
l tend to drink vinegar
in such situations

898
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,828
Let's give your father a surprise?

899
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,760
Why don't you stay away?

900
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,289
We must create an unforgettable
atmosphere meeting him for the first time

901
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,701
Go away
l will manage

902
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,467
Okay, l'll go to the washroom

903
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,272
Oh my God!

904
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,845
God is on my side

905
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:07,883
Are you hurt?

906
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,884
How can you even ask
after being knocked down?

907
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,147
Have some common sense

908
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,314
How can you be so careless?
ls that how you roll a trolley?

909
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,754
Where is my spectacles?

910
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,229
How will you see me
without your glasses

911
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,197
Goodness! Dead

912
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,064
What happened?

913
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,766
Leave me
Where are my glasses?

914
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,933
Here
Wearthem

915
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,474
What is this?

916
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,874
lt used to be your glasses

917
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,140
But when you fell down
it broke and now mutilated

918
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,016
You can all go
l can manage

919
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,382
People so careless here

920
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,080
What happened?

921
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,054
Your father knocked down a trolley here

922
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:47,589
Me?

923
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,951
l mean, father was knocked
down by a trolley

924
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,857
Luckily only thing that
broke was his glasses

925
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:52,792
Are you hurt dad?

926
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,024
Go bring me my spare
glasses from the car

927
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:01,801
My friend Naran
You talk, while l get the glasses

928
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,803
Sure, go ahead

929
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,274
Your eyesight is not so good as before

930
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,139
How do you knowthat?

931
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,075
Anjali has told me

932
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,808
l have heard your voice...very familiar

933
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:17,444
Many people have told me
My voice is like singer Yesudas

934
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,455
No, it's someone l know very well

935
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,115
He's out to ruin me

936
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,993
One minute father
l got a call

937
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,125
l am going out
Being an outgoing call

938
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,466
You can see if you want

939
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,037
See you later, okay

940
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,375
l must be at office, very urgent

941
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,209
Can't you leave after 5 minutes
after talking to father

942
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,249
There's no time at all

943
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:50,978
l had a Rs 15 lakh transaction
l forgot to sign the cheque

944
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,947
lf you are upset
it's okay l'll leave later

945
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,456
Just a loss of 20 lakhs
No problem

946
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,514
lt's okay
Come...come

947
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,891
lt's okay
Work issues

948
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,190
l'll explain to dad

949
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,093
Then, let's see in
party on tomorrow

950
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,465
Don't bring dad to the party
His face is badly hurt

951
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,164
Let him relax

952
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,141
Antappa?

953
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,541
What is it bro?

954
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,281
Didn't you fill the tank yesterday?

955
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,353
Didn't we?
Of course we did

956
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,594
We finished a pint together

957
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,628
l was talking about
the overhead watertank

958
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,186
There's no water in the bathroom

959
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,959
Pour out from the tank

960
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,094
How easily you say that

961
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:43,104
l am totally unused
to such things

962
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,164
This comes of giving
ajob to a rascal like him

963
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,573
lt's 8 in the morning
l have to do all the work

964
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,070
l forgot to perform sun worship

965
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,583
Greetings to Sun God

966
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,485
So cold
But warm while pouring it

967
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,047
Everything becomes hot
once touched by the sun

968
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:10,998
''Season of flowers is here
Beautiful little dragonfly''

969
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:16,728
''My body simply melts
My insides aches''

970
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,739
Antappa, we have
a party at 5 this evening

971
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,752
-Are we late?
- ls someone dead?

972
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:38,961
What happened?

973
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,191
Naran, are you living on a roof top?

974
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:47,761
l didn't tell

975
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,767
Anjali was in a bus
when she saw you taking bath

976
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,005
Bath?
Me?

977
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,670
lmpossible
l never bathe

978
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,442
l mean l don't bathe that way

979
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,177
She says she saw you

980
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:03,985
They've caught you red handed

981
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:04,781
Now admit the truth

982
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,448
Oh today

983
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,719
She saw?.
She must have

984
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,988
lsn't that why l did that?

985
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,494
lt was an ice bucket challenge

986
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,793
Haven't you heard
Terrace bucket challenge?

987
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:22,504
They conduct such stuff
for rehab of street kids

988
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,771
She is leaving for Bangalore today

989
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:29,505
Bangalore
Why?

990
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,777
She had got a job offer long back
She said she wasn't going

991
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,715
But suddenly she changed her mind

992
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:42,589
Where is Anjali now?.

993
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:50,156
Wait! One minute

994
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,164
Let me explain

995
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,724
Please, l don't want
to hear anything

996
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,463
Your behavior is highly
suspicious and cagey

997
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:58,438
lt's not what you think
Listen to mejust once

998
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,236
You can leave after that

999
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,811
What do you want me to hear
About the ice bucket challenge?

1000
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,569
lsn't that what you want to tell?

1001
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,846
But that was what l told them
l can't tell everything to everybody

1002
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,056
Don't you know Antappan?

1003
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,217
His parents died
before he was born

1004
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,260
-What?!
- l mean, he is an orphan

1005
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,262
But he was a millionaire
ln the past

1006
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,491
But now he is a pauper
Fate!

1007
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,366
Do you want to forsake
my childhood friend?

1008
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:32,168
Didn't you see he lives in a room
on the top floor of the corporation building

1009
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,402
He refused all the villas and
apartments l offered

1010
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,739
So full of self respect

1011
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:41,845
After seeing the minister and you guys
we had a couple of drinks at his place

1012
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,318
And then it was too late
to go back to my apartment

1013
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:48,323
l didn't want to hurt him
so l stayed back with him

1014
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,654
For his happiness
ls that wrong?

1015
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,354
Not only that, l had a business
meeting today morning...

1016
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:57,762
...for which l could not
afford to waste time going back

1017
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,700
The MD of that company
was waiting for me

1018
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,398
Which company?

1019
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,207
Company

1020
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,707
Doesn't it have a name?

1021
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,672
You are testing me, eh?

1022
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,612
- lt's a famous company
- Which one?

1023
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,619
What a sorry state of affairs

1024
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:25,517
VD

1025
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:26,254
VD?

1026
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,194
Varma Designs

1027
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,556
You mean Anand and
Devika Varma's Company?

1028
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,292
Yes

1029
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,731
Are they running afteryou guys?

1030
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:33,767
Yes

1031
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,843
You may have plenty of girls
willing to flirt with you in this city

1032
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,808
But l am not prepared
to be one of them

1033
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:47,640
Please, you could have said
a lie that people would believe

1034
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,250
l never thought you
could behave so cheaply

1035
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,620
Don't ever come after me again

1036
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,329
The whole thing
is in a mess, isn't it bro?

1037
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,632
l could not lie
convincingly enough

1038
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,565
Words once spoken
and farts can never...

1039
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,296
...be sent back from where they came

1040
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,202
You always come up
with such dirty talk

1041
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,867
You are the dirty one
Why did you have to lie to her?

1042
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,567
You should have
told herthe truth

1043
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,544
That you were
the childhood sweetheart...

1044
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,705
...who ruined his own life
to save herfrom beatings

1045
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:19,941
You got that word wrong

1046
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,484
You want to correct
my grammar now?.

1047
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:23,984
You listen to me for a change

1048
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:31,583
lf that Poduval ever comes
to know l was Satyanarayan...

1049
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,889
...he wouldn't allow me
anywhere near his town

1050
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:36,487
Are you marrying Poduval?

1051
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,632
Why did you once manipulate
your answer sheets?

1052
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:40,396
ForAnjali

1053
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:43,768
Why did you steal into school
That also forAnjali

1054
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,966
Just rewind and tell her
the entire flashback

1055
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,873
Definitely sentiments
will work in your favor

1056
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,775
Listen to me
and quickly go after her

1057
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,814
And if it's to Bangalore
Then follow herthere...right now

1058
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,427
Please make it fast

1059
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:17,233
1 moment

1060
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,241
Why have you given
MrAnand Varma a business class seat?

1061
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,436
He did not have
his frequent flier card

1062
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,002
So what?
Upgrade it to 1st class

1063
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:30,648
ls he the Anand Varma
of the Varma Designs?

1064
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,585
Yes, he's in the VVlP Lounge

1065
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,654
l must inform him
about his ticket status

1066
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,901
lt was a mistake, sir
and has been rectified

1067
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,304
Sir, a guy Narendra Varma
who says he is your cousin...

1068
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,397
...wants to meet you

1069
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:54,738
Narendra Varma

1070
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,569
-Ask him to come
- Okay sir

1071
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,317
Varma'etta
Ask him to let me in

1072
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:08,287
Come in

1073
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:14,454
Varma'etta
Hey! Don'tjump up

1074
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,656
l am not about to kill myself
Please sit down

1075
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,792
Don't you recognize me?
l am from the Nilambur royal house

1076
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,660
Yes, all of you sit

1077
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,602
l don't know if
you'll know me if l explain

1078
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:24,900
But you can recognize me

1079
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:25,872
lt's me Varma'etta

1080
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,033
Please sit

1081
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,804
Why did you jump up
What respect!

1082
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,742
Please sit

1083
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:34,407
Your wife Devika Varma
Her sister Sarada

1084
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,611
l still have memories
of her carrying me around

1085
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,520
But all that is irrelevant here
Actually l am in a big problem

1086
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,684
You can solve it easily
You must help me brother

1087
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,421
l don't even know you

1088
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:50,966
ln an accident do must we recognize
the victim before we reach him to hospital?

1089
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:54,799
l am in a worse condition now
One word from you will save me

1090
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,928
l beg at yourfeet

1091
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,405
Sorry! Please consider
this as yourfeet

1092
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:02,001
This is such a pain!
What do you want me to do?

1093
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,775
My wife is in the waiting lounge

1094
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,577
We are on the verge of divorce

1095
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,117
You must do me a small favor

1096
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:13,786
Just call me Naran
in front of her

1097
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:14,821
Why?

1098
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,687
An elephant does not
know its own might

1099
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,886
Like that, you don't know
the power of what you utter

1100
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,519
My wife is a great fan of you

1101
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,997
She worships you
like she does her Gods

1102
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,625
lf she comes to know
you are close to me

1103
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:29,432
lt will create wonders
to patch up our relationship

1104
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,438
Won't you call me
'Naran'

1105
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,839
l can see from yourface
that you will call me

1106
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:36,642
You will

1107
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:37,803
Not bad!

1108
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,677
l am not trying to be over smart
l am desperate

1109
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:43,411
l know you help people monetarily

1110
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,647
But solving a person's problem
by saying just one word

1111
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,586
Won't that be a blessing
in your life forever?

1112
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,123
What are you blabbering?

1113
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:53,519
l don't know howto explain
l am a person who never speaks much

1114
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,564
l put all my trust in you
Don't forget my name

1115
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:03,570
Or you can even cut away
the 1st 2 letters of 'vanaran'

1116
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:04,930
ls it confusing you?

1117
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:10,611
What about the film 'Naran' by Joshy?

1118
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,112
We'll fix on that
Don't forget

1119
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,512
l will be waiting
Please call me, okay?

1120
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:15,447
Mr Naran?

1121
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,519
Not here! You must
come there and call me

1122
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,918
And please do away with Mr
Orthe intimacy will be lost

1123
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:24,618
Please be alert and remind him
Naran

1124
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,526
That does not mean all of you
can call out in a chorus Naran

1125
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:28,688
Now practice

1126
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,647
Sorry! Was just seeing
if you were asleep

1127
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:51,077
When someone comes to talk
it's quite nasty of you...

1128
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:53,087
...to be like a switched off mobile

1129
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,484
l am a human being
At least listen to me

1130
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,892
There is a problem
She is my wife

1131
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,090
Her father promised
to give me 50 lakhs as dowry

1132
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,065
-Will you give me that amount?
- lt's okay

1133
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,658
Flirting rascal!

1134
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,135
Don't imagine things
and think they are the truth

1135
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:10,762
lt may be entirely wrong

1136
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:14,070
You must have the decency
to listen to others

1137
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,007
Have you come
with a new set of lies?

1138
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:19,241
Where has this bearded devil gone?

1139
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,681
Has he gone to catch
the flight in some other exit?

1140
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,850
Even if l tear open and show you my heart
you'll only say it was a red flower

1141
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:32,155
l have not come to you with
my worth or academic excellence

1142
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:36,561
l am a professional consultant
who deals with 100s of companies

1143
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,066
Do you know why l reject offers
and choose to be in this city?

1144
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,659
Because you are here

1145
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,102
l am not after money and fame

1146
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,800
Please don't shoot
Husband-wife problem

1147
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:48,206
May be you'd have given me
more value if l had come...

1148
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,278
...with the trappings
of the corporate world

1149
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,947
You know
There is nothing in looks

1150
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,317
Take Abraham Lincoln
Sunken cheeks and narrow chin

1151
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,650
Things always are beyond
what you actually see

1152
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:22,169
Oh God!
You again?

1153
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,234
See Varma

1154
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,185
This is more important than millions

1155
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,779
Please leave me alone man

1156
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:35,720
Naran
This is-

1157
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,553
What this?

1158
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,217
Yes, l know him
Anand Varma

1159
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,158
Varma Designs

1160
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:40,228
Fashion tycoon

1161
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,060
So what?
A man has to have peace of mind

1162
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,093
People don't allow me to live in peace

1163
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,297
Anjali is the most important in my life

1164
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:52,636
l can't give anyone else
more importance

1165
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,766
Whether it is Anand Varma or Ambani

1166
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,816
What a time to say sorry
Wasting time

1167
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:12,725
You may or may not believe me
and go away to Bangalore

1168
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,188
l did not come to stop you

1169
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,128
But if you went without
hearing what l had to say

1170
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:22,362
l'll always feel sad that you went
without knowing the truth

1171
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,700
Now l am at peace

1172
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:30,211
l won't come into your life again

1173
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,807
Wonder if Varma will kill me now

1174
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:36,139
l want him in front of me
within 24 hours with full details

1175
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,712
Okay, sir

1176
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,720
'l remember l was waiting for the bus
How did l reach the beach?'

1177
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,430
'Who is this leaning
on VD and smoking?'

1178
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:34,928
'This man?!'

1179
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,268
Sit

1180
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:41,475
From Koonanthuruthu, Paraparambil
Narayanan's son Satyanarayanan

1181
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:47,014
Satyan, Naran, Narendran
Krishnankutty, Shivakumar...

1182
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,516
...and infinite number of aliases

1183
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:54,221
Disappeared from Koonanthuruthu once
and appeared in Madhya Pradesh

1184
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,224
From there to Bihar
and from Biharto Kolkata

1185
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:02,958
Jobs, 18 in number varying from
gardener to ministers personal assistant

1186
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,224
Spouting lies to make a living
and finally landed here

1187
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:08,201
lsn't that your life history in brief?

1188
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:14,171
So only my star sign
remains to be found out?

1189
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:18,310
l know that also
But l may change that

1190
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:21,782
l have heard many
people refer to that title

1191
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,216
But it belongs
to you, doesn't it?

1192
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:25,218
What?

1193
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:26,311
Tiger

1194
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,823
lsn't it the lion who
is the king of forest?

1195
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,985
Tiger is just a subject

1196
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,931
ln a way you are the true king

1197
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,129
A king among liars

1198
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,166
The King Liar

1199
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,363
l do want to work for my living

1200
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:46,100
But l find l can live
only if l lied and earned

1201
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,607
lt's a habit
l can change

1202
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:48,808
Don't change

1203
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:54,880
Your ability to convince
that midnight was broad daylight

1204
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,348
Frankly that is what attracted me

1205
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:59,511
l feel good about
your compliments

1206
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,885
You want to make use of me, right?

1207
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,350
So you have deduced that, eh?

1208
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:09,864
lt took me many years of sweat
and toil to build this empire...

1209
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:13,128
...called Varma Designs

1210
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:17,136
Business with a turnover
of millions is now...

1211
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,436
...under the control
of my wife Devika Varma

1212
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,500
That is not at all surprising

1213
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:26,844
Many lions in business are often
underthe rule of their wives

1214
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,473
Mukesh has often told me

1215
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:29,578
Mukesh?

1216
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,585
Mukesh Ambani

1217
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,417
Sorry sir, l got used
to this habit of lying

1218
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:35,649
Sir, please stand
l can sit

1219
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,950
Sorry, l'll stand you sit
Tell me the rest of it

1220
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,255
This is not the kind
of control you imagine

1221
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:43,162
My wife and l are
on the brink of divorce

1222
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:46,293
Until a final decision is made
all rights over our business...

1223
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:51,396
...has been handed over
to her by the court

1224
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:53,300
l am a nobody now

1225
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,399
Where do l come in here?

1226
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,341
You must go to Dubai

1227
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:02,380
And somehow get yourself
employed at Varma Designs

1228
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,615
And with some smart moves
gain the confidence of your wife

1229
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:10,647
And after that, ruin the company
and hand it back over to you

1230
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,092
That means you must
get back your control over it

1231
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:14,594
lsn't that what you want?

1232
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,029
lsn't it?

1233
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:23,998
So Satyan, won't you
accept this job?

1234
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:29,601
Satyan is not accepting it
l am fed up of this life of lying

1235
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:36,708
When a monkey always with dysentery
is asked for some shit for a medicine...

1236
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,716
...it says my diarrhea has stopped

1237
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,625
Are you related to Antappan?

1238
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:45,053
Who is that?

1239
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:49,188
My friend
He also speaks dirty like this

1240
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:50,690
Continue your story sir

1241
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:54,099
l did not haul you here
to treat you with lively stories

1242
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:57,171
l can't do any more put on acts
lt won't work out sir

1243
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:03,103
Then l may have to tell
the truth to your girl friend

1244
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,409
This is the problem
with people like you

1245
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,277
Blackmailing at
the drop of a hat

1246
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,341
Nothing is for free Satya
Everything has a price

1247
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,586
Even the lies you utter

1248
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:16,053
Threat on one hand
and temptation on the other

1249
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,718
l just can'tjump into this
and agree to your offer

1250
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,054
l need one more day
to think it over

1251
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:24,689
l'll give you time
But your rely must be positive

1252
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,028
l insist

1253
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:33,338
Bro, a trip to Dubai can
bring you enough money...

1254
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:35,534
...have a blast and come back

1255
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:40,310
l don't feel like leaving Anjali
Neither can l refuse his offer

1256
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,584
That bearded vagabond
will tell Anjali everything

1257
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,314
l can't take another risk
as far as she is concerned

1258
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,357
Why don't you confess
and tell her everything?

1259
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,015
Yes, l must

1260
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:55,286
l must tell her everything
But not now

1261
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,624
But l have some plans

1262
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:02,766
l must be sure that even if
her dad objects she'll stand by me

1263
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:07,404
l am telling you once again
Don't refuse his offer

1264
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:10,411
You don't know
the exact terms of this job

1265
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,810
lt is a job Anand Varma
came down and offered you

1266
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,073
You were quite rude
to him yesterday

1267
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,186
But he failed to
consider my emotion

1268
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:22,321
Okay, agreed
l behaved badly

1269
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,555
l knew you were upset

1270
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,390
Going to him and apologizing
has landed me in this dilemma

1271
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:30,158
What do you want me to do?
Go and join his company?

1272
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,596
Okay, l will

1273
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,530
But this is the 1st time in life
l am going against my decision

1274
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,537
l doing it only because
you wanted it, Anjali

1275
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,606
l am going to meet him now

1276
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,779
This is the appointment letter
worded the way you wanted it

1277
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:56,221
These are the travel documents
for you and your friend and some money

1278
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,818
Hope they are original notes
Sorry, no one is to be trusted

1279
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:02,358
What?

1280
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:06,764
lt's not abuse
ln Spanish it is 'see you'

1281
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:07,903
l have great hopes
Don't shatterthem

1282
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,565
l have great hopes
Don't shatterthem

1283
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,534
l would have left earlier
if you'd said it

1284
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:14,370
Said what?

1285
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:15,374
All the best

1286
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:19,512
You mean we go to Dubai?

1287
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:24,779
Yes, we go to Dubai, enjoy
and rip apart Devika Varma as well

1288
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:52,675
There goes Devika Varma

1289
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,648
That bearded Varma, her husband
was kicked out from business...

1290
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,379
...worth millions and she
took overthe empire very smartly

1291
01:20:58,453 --> 01:20:59,750
Now we can do
the same to her, right?

1292
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:00,810
Yeah
What?!

1293
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:04,757
Sorry brotherfor blurting it out
l'm not like you

1294
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,761
l don't know about the others
But we are only 2 of us here

1295
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,923
l asked you to go inside
in Arabic language

1296
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,765
- Do you know Malayalam?
- Sure

1297
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:14,461
Then why didn't you
talk to us in Malayalam?

1298
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,299
But l always talk Arabic
to people who don't know it

1299
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:16,769
Why?

1300
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:18,567
Because if they knew it
he'd get beaten up

1301
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,732
No, because they won't
understand anyway

1302
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,876
Hey! You are quite
well versed in Arabic

1303
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:34,285
-You seem to be a master in Arabic
- l am master in all trades

1304
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,357
How about our madam?
Has she a friendly nature?

1305
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:36,856
What?

1306
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,449
-You don't know Sanskrit?
- No

1307
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,418
- ls madam a friendly type?
- Very friendly

1308
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,957
From behind
she's very friendly

1309
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:45,790
But when you face her Bruce Lee

1310
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:46,799
l don't understand

1311
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,733
Well, you will now
Go inside

1312
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:53,639
What?

1313
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,175
Madam is yelling at someone

1314
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,711
She's not yelling
She's just being very loving

1315
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:58,803
Go inside

1316
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:19,432
l'll buy you a new one
lt costs only Rs 2 back home

1317
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:20,900
Hey Mr

1318
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:23,363
Only nowthe zipper opened

1319
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,831
Oh God! lt's pant zip opened

1320
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:52,424
This company has no connection
with Anand Varma in any way

1321
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,302
There is a clause here
which says l can accept...

1322
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:58,668
...ajob here anytime
within six months

1323
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:00,707
So Anand Varma is not the issue her

1324
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:02,834
l have come with
sufficient qualifications

1325
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:07,040
These are certificates
from foreign universities

1326
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:17,915
And this is the letter from
the company l was under contract...

1327
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,394
...which states details of compensation
l have paid them to join your company

1328
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,991
lf l file a case for
breach of contract...

1329
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,831
...you'll have to pay me
in millions as compensation

1330
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:32,539
Do think about it...!

1331
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,301
Just get out man!

1332
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:37,039
Throw him out

1333
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:46,547
Hey you! l did not come out
because l was scared

1334
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:50,454
l did not want to face
charges of harassing you

1335
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:54,656
This is not a mere notice
inviting you to a temple festival

1336
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:59,097
Six months ago, the owner of this business
Anand Varma, with his sign and seal...

1337
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,962
...had given me this appointment letter
straight out of his letter pad

1338
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,972
Since then, whether she divorced
shaved his beard or killed him...

1339
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,371
...is none of my business

1340
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:11,401
The truth is, her ex-husband
promised me a house, a car, a cook...

1341
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,971
...and begged at my feet
which made me give up my job

1342
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,349
Now you can't play games with me

1343
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:23,390
l swear, with these certificates
even if it cost me my life l will-

1344
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,355
How did a hole come to be here?

1345
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:39,339
Ayyyooo!
Shooting!

1346
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,071
Sorry my dear sister

1347
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,770
You can sleep
Good night

1348
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:52,882
Hey where am l?
Legs like palm trees

1349
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:54,148
Shoot him madam

1350
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,654
They won't charge a case
in Dubai, if you fire at his butt

1351
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,927
Now it will be risky

1352
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,054
l'm very lucky
l escaped from her shoot

1353
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:10,834
Did you get appointed so fast?

1354
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:12,133
Pointed
Agun

1355
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,004
That woman is insane

1356
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,974
Wait, let me get her mobile number

1357
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,444
Flirting in between this fracas

1358
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,644
Bro, let me go get her number

1359
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:31,751
l came to remind you that
if he moves legally we'll be in a fix

1360
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,055
Nothing like that
Let him jump into

1361
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,090
Madam, he was appointed by Varma sir

1362
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:40,167
lf a legal issue crops up
Varma sir will stand by him

1363
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:43,996
So? Are saying a guy like him
be nurtured by my company, Prasad?

1364
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:45,630
No not at all

1365
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:46,672
Hey Kumar

1366
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:48,036
No madam

1367
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,407
lf we do not give him thejob
we'll be in trouble

1368
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:52,537
But no one will question us
if we fire him later on

1369
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:53,740
That's correct

1370
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,443
Give him a job he can't handle
Let him leave shamefully

1371
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:16,064
That's fantastic
Look how he changes color

1372
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,866
Let's learn this trick from him

1373
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:18,631
For what?

1374
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,139
We can buy just
one pair of undies

1375
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:22,038
We can just change
its color everyday

1376
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,101
Forthat you don't need magic

1377
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:27,238
Try using an underwear for a week
The color will change automatically

1378
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,850
Do you have some magic
that will whiten my skin?

1379
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,212
Don't harass
Let's live in peace

1380
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:37,451
Are you a Malayali?

1381
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:38,753
Where do we get booze here?

1382
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:40,589
Hey! Haven't you
anything betterto do?

1383
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,754
Paker'eta, shouldn't we pack this?

1384
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,226
What are you doing?
Keep it in the basket

1385
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,025
Are we actually in Dubai
or in Trissur back in our country?

1386
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:49,569
To tell exactly-

1387
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,003
Madam asked me to take you to her

1388
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,071
Why?

1389
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:55,972
Does she want to take more shots
with me standing or running?

1390
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,978
No! To join the company

1391
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,105
l am Pushpa Kumar

1392
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,649
No, l'll call you Pushpu

1393
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:07,585
How did you manage
to join that company, Pushpu?

1394
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:08,917
That's a long story

1395
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:13,687
My wife worked as the person
in charge of making face creams

1396
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:16,662
One day she looked into the cauldron
to see if the cream was ready

1397
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:18,891
She fell head first into it
and died swallowing cream

1398
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:20,867
l got a job in sympathy for her death

1399
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,301
Your food and 'adkyamadation'...!

1400
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:24,596
What?

1401
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,940
What do you mean?

1402
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:32,606
The company has provided
an apartment and food, let's go

1403
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:36,978
l don't understand
why madam called us back

1404
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:41,010
Gave us food, this flat and booze
Apart from this fancy coat

1405
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,783
She must have realized l was dangerous

1406
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,950
That's how effective
my performance was

1407
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,186
You prefer soda or water

1408
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,092
No drinking today

1409
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,688
l have to join thejob auspiciously

1410
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:56,999
Not only that, l must chat
with my Anjali fully in my senses

1411
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:05,646
'Brother, your exercise equipment
is on your bed so it will be...'

1412
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,304
'...easy foryou in the morning'

1413
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:37,310
Afew of our product are not
making profit as expected...

1414
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,779
...as per the internal audit report

1415
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:44,282
The profit level of those products
as well as the total turnover of VD...

1416
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:48,048
...must show a rise and
this task entrusted to Satyan

1417
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:51,052
But there can't be
additional expenses...

1418
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:54,117
...for machinery man-power
and advertisements

1419
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:59,025
Hiking the price of commodities
is unthinkable

1420
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:11,777
Without increasing manpower
machinery or using advertisements...

1421
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:14,007
...how can we raise profit levels?

1422
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,276
lf you are countering
my demand with a question...

1423
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,149
...why should l appoint
someone with a sizeable salary?

1424
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:22,679
Don't poke fun at me

1425
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:29,860
l am entrusted me with this job
since others here are inefficient

1426
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:41,070
Dog!

1427
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:48,647
ls the route from Dubai to Sharjah?

1428
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:53,915
The profit level of Varma Designs
last year like a tortoise climbing a hill

1429
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:56,920
ln a very short time
this line has to reach here

1430
01:29:57,024 --> 01:30:00,357
That's very simple
Just draw a line to there

1431
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:02,293
lt's not enough on paper

1432
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,159
Then?

1433
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:07,167
l must raise their business profits
and that too alone

1434
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,259
Will it be possible?

1435
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:11,931
The more they try to kick me out
the more l shall dig in and stay here

1436
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:13,997
My saga of bluffing
and deluding continues

1437
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:18,846
What does that mean?

1438
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,073
Watch it on screen

1439
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:23,006
''This is all we doing''

1440
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:23,948
''King Liar''

1441
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,849
''Let's double up the number''

1442
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,852
''King liar''

1443
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:28,445
''Let's get it to the target''

1444
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:29,490
''King liar''

1445
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,248
''Give me...give me target''

1446
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:32,257
''King liar''

1447
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,089
''Come, come on...come on''

1448
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:38,260
''Get it to the target
Get it to the target''

1449
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,834
''Get it to the target''

1450
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,429
''King liar''

1451
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:44,164
''Let's double up the number''

1452
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,205
''King liar''

1453
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,900
''Let's get it to the target''

1454
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:48,066
''King liar''

1455
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:49,700
''Give me...give me target''

1456
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:50,937
''King liar''

1457
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:18,336
lf you can explain
the action plan you used...

1458
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,101
...it will be an inspiration for us

1459
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:27,943
This company which was doing well
since last 14 years suddenly fell short

1460
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:34,147
ln the past, contestants we sponsored
for ramp shows and contests, always won

1461
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:40,054
But somewhere in the line we lost out
the huge advertisements and good will

1462
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,425
l did just small adjustments

1463
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:51,267
For example, the working time
of laborers was shifted marginally

1464
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:55,307
The profit margin
showed great increase

1465
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,844
Are you saying just a few minutes
was reason for such a huge profit?

1466
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:05,112
When the alarm for starting work
and that for leaving work...

1467
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:12,250
...was shifted by one minute
We got 4 extra minutes everyday

1468
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:17,024
We have 2000 employees
Multiplied by 4 minutes per days...8000 minutes

1469
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:22,569
30 days a month multiplies
and becomes 2,40,000 minutes

1470
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:29,008
ln 3 months it is 12000 hours
They work 6 hours a day

1471
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:33,308
Going by this calculation
we get almost 2000 working days

1472
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:35,947
And that is almost 5.5 years in a man's life

1473
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,018
That's not a small number
isn't it Mr...?

1474
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:39,484
Saddam
Saddam Hussain

1475
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:48,861
How does this increase
profits of our creams?

1476
01:32:50,197 --> 01:32:54,031
You did not give me permission
to increase time, or any other parameter

1477
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:57,363
But without your permission
l increased one aspect here

1478
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,235
The width of the spout of the tube

1479
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:06,970
The existing width was increased
from 7.5 mm to 12.5 mm

1480
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,641
This increased consumption
every time the tube was pressed

1481
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:15,150
The cream which lasted for 3 months
now got over by 2 months

1482
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:21,424
Our income increased from
6 million Dirham to 8.5 million Dirham

1483
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:25,998
That means a 5 mm hole
was worth nearly 2.5 million Dirham

1484
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:32,005
2.5 million for a mere hole?!
Why don't we sell only holes?

1485
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,596
He's gone off his head, madam

1486
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:38,342
Madam! lf this was true people
will become millionaires selling holes

1487
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,346
This is just manipulation

1488
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:48,453
Tell which multinational company
does not manipulate for gains, Mr Pushpu?

1489
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:54,659
lt is said one should make the way
easy to attain his success

1490
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:58,626
- lsn't that correct?
-Yes, that also is mentioned

1491
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:09,309
ls it okay?

1492
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,366
Correct

1493
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,147
This guy is a big fraud
Send him away now madam

1494
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,182
You must be the one
sent away from here

1495
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:23,419
You are supposed to be sent out
as you are going crazy at times

1496
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:24,957
Hey! Tables have turned, eh?

1497
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:29,257
The management has decided to
hand over Kumar's portfolio also to Satyan

1498
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:33,723
Do you think he is 'esi-fficient' enough?

1499
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:38,505
Go learn the meaning of that word first
Then well think about your suggestion

1500
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:42,133
There's no need to giggle
Just give me 2 days and l'll tell you

1501
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,203
l have one more
important announcement

1502
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:53,344
The forthcoming Max Asian Beauty Contest
will have a contestant from VD also

1503
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:03,287
lf you don't mind
l can find a girl forthat

1504
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:04,995
Not necessary

1505
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,562
lt is my responsibility

1506
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:10,233
l will be busy forthis
in the days to come

1507
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:14,501
So l request you to look after
office matters too

1508
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:23,175
l have a whole collection
of these BMw cars

1509
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:27,452
After slogging for so many years
Let alone a car, no one...

1510
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:30,115
...bought me even a few peanuts

1511
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:38,394
Shall l begin to slowly
break down the VD empire?

1512
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:42,431
That is not what yourjob is

1513
01:35:42,536 --> 01:35:45,130
But didn't you hire me to
ruin Varma Designs?

1514
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:46,798
No

1515
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:53,079
Varma Designs was not built up
in a single day like other companies

1516
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,738
l won't allow even
a brick to budge from there

1517
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:57,577
l don't understand

1518
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:02,088
Whatever it may cost, Devika must
change her mind about divorcing me

1519
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:03,818
That is yourjob now

1520
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,186
What the heck!

1521
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:09,124
My dear sir

1522
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:14,758
lt's true that any guy will be upset
when he sees his wife usurp his assets

1523
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:18,202
But do you really want to bear
the burden of that cross again?

1524
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:20,536
And that too, a cross
as solid as concrete

1525
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,735
lf you choose to go back
to your husband duties...

1526
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,040
...you sure will be crucified
just like Lord Jesus

1527
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,672
She's totally insane, sir
lf the she-devil-

1528
01:36:31,152 --> 01:36:33,279
Not another word about Devi...!

1529
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:50,427
l don't blame you Satyan

1530
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:55,605
Her attitude and behavior will
make any one believe she's eccentric

1531
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:59,078
Once her heart was
full of love towards me

1532
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:03,381
But now, filled with hatred
and vengeance

1533
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:07,411
Can l ask you something?

1534
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:10,215
What exactly is the issue
between you?

1535
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:17,524
VD was celebrating after winning
an international fashion contest

1536
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:26,431
'l am not trying to justify myself'

1537
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:31,197
'That day, intoxicated with
the victory and drinks, it just happened'

1538
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:35,337
Wouldn't a sincere
heartfelt apology solve it?

1539
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:36,841
Why don't you try?

1540
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:38,934
l did

1541
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:47,312
Devika, it's me
l want to talk to you

1542
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,617
Wait, l must speak to you

1543
01:38:57,831 --> 01:39:00,994
After that, l don't have
the courage to even face her

1544
01:39:01,635 --> 01:39:04,468
But sir, what should l do?

1545
01:39:04,538 --> 01:39:08,531
The image that lies in her mind
like a dark stain must be washed away

1546
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:11,806
How can something she saw
with her own eyes be erased?

1547
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:15,007
A guy who is able to make others
believe what was unbelievable...

1548
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:17,409
...can also do the opposite

1549
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:18,982
l have confidence in you

1550
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:24,584
You can demand anything in return

1551
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:27,684
Even my entire wealth and savings

1552
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:32,992
Because, Devika is worth
more than any of this to me

1553
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:36,361
Sir, l have done plenty
of fraudulentjobs

1554
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,597
Melted away issues
that were mountainous

1555
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:42,642
But this is something
l can't assure you of success

1556
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:46,471
One can't cheat a mind
that is straight forward

1557
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:50,273
There is a way

1558
01:39:52,353 --> 01:39:56,687
We must create a situation
where she can be easily deceived

1559
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:58,651
What do you mean?

1560
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:02,957
Madam has the confidence that
she can run the place without your help

1561
01:40:03,063 --> 01:40:06,590
We must first see that
her confidence crumbles

1562
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:09,695
Acandidate from your side
must compete in the forth coming...

1563
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:13,705
...Max beauty contest
Against her candidate

1564
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:15,473
No...Never!

1565
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:17,806
l am not prepared
to compete against Devika

1566
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:20,345
And l don't want any gains
by defeating her

1567
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:23,848
Then let us part ways here
with a dignified hand-shake

1568
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:27,779
Only if you leave me
to work it out in my way...

1569
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:29,890
...l can get things to go as you want

1570
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:33,951
l am giving you a last plan
to get back madam's trust

1571
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:37,589
We must get it back
from where you lost it

1572
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:40,658
Okay, l'll do what you want

1573
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,563
Now let me tell you my demand

1574
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:50,376
l don't want your money or assets
But l have one demand

1575
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:53,575
Your candidate for
Max beauty contest...

1576
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:55,979
...will be the person l suggest

1577
01:40:58,085 --> 01:40:59,780
l remember this girl

1578
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:02,117
Lack of confidence
That was her drawback

1579
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:05,917
To make a girl with poor confidence
perform for such a great event...

1580
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,017
...is impossible

1581
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:10,893
Don't you believe that
l make the impossible possible?

1582
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:14,092
Same way, l too have
the same belief in you

1583
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:18,562
You don't have to promise me
Butjust tell me you will try

1584
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:27,503
Anand Varma sir had called me

1585
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:29,510
Can you hear me?

1586
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:31,978
Faisal, l'll take an auto

1587
01:41:32,052 --> 01:41:34,850
Naran, Varma sir called
and talked to me directly

1588
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,651
He has sent me
the flight ticket also

1589
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:39,389
Do you know, today is 2nd

1590
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,757
And 2 is my lucky number

1591
01:41:43,464 --> 01:41:47,161
You may think it is foolish
But it gives me great confidence

1592
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:49,502
Evening flight at 5:30

1593
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:51,571
Naran, will you come
to pick me up?

1594
01:41:58,045 --> 01:41:59,979
Gone, before l was done kissing?

1595
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:05,684
l must go at 4:52 to the airport

1596
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:07,811
Why 4:52?

1597
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:11,583
5 plus 4 is nine
9 plus 2 is 11 and 1 plus 1 is 2

1598
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:14,455
Anjali's lucky number is 2
Hereafter mine also

1599
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,995
lt's my lucky number also

1600
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:18,463
Every time l pass number 2
l feel great relief

1601
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:19,862
When will you ever change?

1602
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:20,592
Why?

1603
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:22,692
l wasn't talking about defecating
Lucky number 2

1604
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:23,633
Oh that 2!

1605
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:24,669
What was that for?

1606
01:42:24,738 --> 01:42:25,762
You deserved it

1607
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:27,739
You think it was funny
There are betterjokes

1608
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:29,968
There you go again

1609
01:42:30,177 --> 01:42:32,577
Wonder who yourteacher was?!

1610
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:34,909
- Prof Joseph Halfshit
-Yuck!

1611
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:35,880
What?

1612
01:42:37,117 --> 01:42:39,483
He died while defecating
because his of kidney failure

1613
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:40,417
Stop it!

1614
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:41,985
Wash your mouth
and get me some tea

1615
01:42:42,055 --> 01:42:43,079
So who will wash these vessels?

1616
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,488
Do what you want

1617
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:46,855
Bringing you to Dubai was foolishness!

1618
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:55,602
Anjali will work for Varma sir
and you for his wife, an enemy

1619
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:57,864
Will it not be a problem
if Anjali comes to know?

1620
01:42:57,971 --> 01:43:00,599
l will tell Anjali everything

1621
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,574
There shall be no more
secrets between us

1622
01:43:02,676 --> 01:43:03,836
Fantastic!

1623
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:07,074
My dear sister
No need to worry anymore sis

1624
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,475
Are we on time?

1625
01:43:08,582 --> 01:43:11,574
l am never late
The time is 4:52 pm

1626
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:13,842
Where are you off to?

1627
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,046
Where ever l wish

1628
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:19,649
Can't he work for a living?
Loitering around

1629
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:22,251
Look lucky number 2
And the lift is on time

1630
01:43:22,496 --> 01:43:24,555
Gosh! l was here to call this guy

1631
01:43:28,602 --> 01:43:30,763
Hey! ls he gone?
This is not opening

1632
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:32,200
Where is the staircase?

1633
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:36,505
There's no need for tension
We are on time

1634
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:37,908
We must not be late

1635
01:43:42,082 --> 01:43:43,549
Madam's in the car

1636
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:46,017
- Poor man, he's blabbering
- Something about his pants

1637
01:43:46,086 --> 01:43:48,577
No, l meant madam
is waiting for you in the car

1638
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:50,486
She wants to see you

1639
01:43:54,094 --> 01:43:56,654
Satyan, if you are free
l wanted to discuss something

1640
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:01,266
What about Anjali?

1641
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,037
Not Anjali

1642
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:05,093
Gingelly

1643
01:44:05,205 --> 01:44:07,173
5 of them will do
And fry onions well in it

1644
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:12,076
And laterfrom the airport
season it well and bring her

1645
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:14,272
And when it splutters
noisily in the taxi car

1646
01:44:14,548 --> 01:44:17,244
Exactly
Hey! You got it

1647
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,253
Wonder if l have cash in my wallet

1648
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:25,587
Hey! Madam you left me behind

1649
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:52,608
Madam, l'll be there in a minute

1650
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,311
Let me attend the phone call please

1651
01:44:55,155 --> 01:44:56,122
Bro, it's me

1652
01:44:56,189 --> 01:44:59,022
l was about to call you
Haven't you reached the airport yet?

1653
01:44:59,092 --> 01:45:00,753
Reached
The flight just landed

1654
01:45:00,827 --> 01:45:02,886
lf she asks, tell her...

1655
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,598
...l am in a meeting with Varma sir

1656
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:07,326
l'll tell herthe rest later on

1657
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:08,932
Let me go in now

1658
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:13,669
Why the heck did l get into this?!

1659
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:30,916
Madam, just a second

1660
01:45:31,024 --> 01:45:32,582
Please allow me to talk...?

1661
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:37,790
What's happening dude?

1662
01:45:37,864 --> 01:45:39,832
Hello, l have picked up Anjali

1663
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:43,734
She has the guest house address
Shall we go there or...?

1664
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:45,031
Where are you brother?

1665
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:47,402
l am right now
at madam's farm house

1666
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:48,130
What?

1667
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:48,970
Farm...da

1668
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:50,339
Canada?
When did you go?

1669
01:45:50,444 --> 01:45:52,844
Farm...

1670
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:56,076
Ask your driver
to stop honking like that

1671
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:58,083
Farm house...da

1672
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:00,409
Letter F as in father

1673
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:01,745
Khader's wife?

1674
01:46:01,855 --> 01:46:03,618
Not Khader, you idiot!

1675
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:05,923
Oh forget it!

1676
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:07,721
Dude, the F of freezer

1677
01:46:07,794 --> 01:46:08,886
Brassier cup?

1678
01:46:08,962 --> 01:46:10,657
Oh God!

1679
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,765
Full, the beginning

1680
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:16,426
Half is a pint

1681
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:21,664
- How does full begin?
- By saying 'cheers'

1682
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:25,175
F from Full

1683
01:46:25,245 --> 01:46:26,769
Don't you understand?

1684
01:46:27,247 --> 01:46:29,977
l'll write it out F

1685
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:33,019
Oh now l get it
Farm house

1686
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,918
- Why didn't you say so earlier?
- Goodness!

1687
01:46:36,022 --> 01:46:38,081
Don't come here, okay?

1688
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:39,419
Should we come there?

1689
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:41,859
Don't...bring...her...here...dude!

1690
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,163
He's laughing and
enjoying himself there

1691
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:49,735
Must be happy you are coming

1692
01:46:49,836 --> 01:46:51,303
What a nasty vibrator

1693
01:46:56,443 --> 01:46:58,070
Wonder if he heard me right?

1694
01:46:58,211 --> 01:47:02,807
l think he asked me
not to come...did he?

1695
01:47:03,216 --> 01:47:05,241
Do you know the way
to the farm house?

1696
01:47:05,352 --> 01:47:08,116
- Of course
- Then let's go

1697
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:11,019
Shall we?
Will it be a problem?

1698
01:47:12,893 --> 01:47:18,092
Anand Varma is entering his candidate
forthe Max Asian beauty competition

1699
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:21,731
Really?
Who is that model?

1700
01:47:21,835 --> 01:47:23,496
How many models do you know?.

1701
01:47:24,037 --> 01:47:27,029
l just wanted to know, that's all

1702
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:29,206
l don't know for sure

1703
01:47:29,743 --> 01:47:32,303
Only that she's from Kerala

1704
01:47:32,412 --> 01:47:35,347
Anand has something up his sleeve

1705
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:39,916
That model must not participate

1706
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:48,521
You can bribe or threaten
or do whateveryou want

1707
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:01,837
There is a very easy solution

1708
01:48:02,542 --> 01:48:06,774
Why don't you have
an open talk with Varma sir?

1709
01:48:07,113 --> 01:48:10,742
lf you can forgive him
this distance between you will go

1710
01:48:10,884 --> 01:48:15,184
We can then present the model
he trains to represent Varma Designs

1711
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:22,553
Will you be able to do
what l asked you to?

1712
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:24,160
l want to know only that

1713
01:48:26,266 --> 01:48:27,233
l will madam

1714
01:48:27,934 --> 01:48:30,835
Good thing l came to pick you
Desert

1715
01:48:31,037 --> 01:48:33,028
Moreover, drivers here
can't be trusted

1716
01:48:33,139 --> 01:48:35,266
All are experts in rape
Vagabonds

1717
01:48:35,342 --> 01:48:37,207
What?

1718
01:48:37,544 --> 01:48:39,409
Are you a Malayali?

1719
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:43,006
l can carry you, madam

1720
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:45,340
Careful

1721
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:50,585
l have carried my grandmother
when l was young

1722
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:52,825
Please be careful
The pool is close by

1723
01:48:53,059 --> 01:48:54,993
Madam catch me
l am falling

1724
01:49:01,067 --> 01:49:05,003
What a dead weight
All that good food

1725
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:07,233
Oh my God!

1726
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:15,411
How do l stop this?

1727
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:22,211
Wow! Brother is having a blast, eh?

1728
01:49:28,228 --> 01:49:29,388
Brother!

1729
01:49:35,502 --> 01:49:36,833
Oh God!

1730
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:43,140
Dude! Come and help me

1731
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:49,178
-Anjali, actually
- ls this your urgent meeting?

1732
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,342
Don't say anything
Let's go

1733
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,318
Please listen to me Anjali

1734
01:49:55,488 --> 01:49:57,888
Why the hell did you
bring her here?

1735
01:49:57,991 --> 01:50:02,052
lt was you who laughed joked
and asked me to come here

1736
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:04,187
Your head must be full of dirt
Moron!

1737
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:08,233
How do l know you'll be standing
there with madam in your arms?

1738
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:09,996
Madam is in love, eh?

1739
01:50:11,972 --> 01:50:13,564
lnside
Not out there

1740
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,972
Do l need to tell you
specifically to come help me?

1741
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,475
l am right behind you
Go ahead

1742
01:50:17,577 --> 01:50:19,545
Goodness! So heavy

1743
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:23,606
After l shed this burden
l must go solve the issue with Anjali

1744
01:50:23,683 --> 01:50:26,880
How will l tell her
l work for madam?

1745
01:50:26,987 --> 01:50:28,921
Don't worry bro
l have told her all that

1746
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:29,648
Have you?

1747
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:30,417
Yes

1748
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:34,483
Did you tell her clearly that
all this drama was for her sake?

1749
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:38,497
Not in detail
but a little here and there

1750
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:41,564
Why should l hurt my hand?!

1751
01:50:41,668 --> 01:50:42,635
So it was not

1752
01:50:43,603 --> 01:50:45,571
Oh, this dead weight is here

1753
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:50,268
Brother
l hadn't got in!

1754
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:56,142
Go ahead and laugh
You dog of a camel!

1755
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:58,040
What will l do now?.

1756
01:51:01,521 --> 01:51:03,182
Buddy, can you give me a lift?

1757
01:51:10,096 --> 01:51:15,432
Sir, l'd been to your apartment
to meet Anjali, but she refuses to see me

1758
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,663
l must talk to her
Give me her phone number

1759
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:20,171
Who asked you to go there?

1760
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:23,071
You are neither allowed
to talk or meet her

1761
01:51:24,744 --> 01:51:28,111
We had a misunderstanding
l want to tell her everything

1762
01:51:29,215 --> 01:51:31,183
Don't underestimate Devika

1763
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:35,020
lf she ever knows Anjali is your girl
everything will be over

1764
01:51:35,488 --> 01:51:38,013
l can't play anymore games with my life

1765
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:43,118
This deal is between you and me
So a third person must never know

1766
01:51:43,229 --> 01:51:45,356
Forthe time being Anjali is no one to you

1767
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:54,302
Where are you taking me?

1768
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:56,308
He doesn't know my language too

1769
01:51:56,409 --> 01:51:57,671
Move, camel

1770
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:10,281
lt's your phone that's been
ringing for a long time

1771
01:52:11,624 --> 01:52:13,717
Who is this so early in the morning?

1772
01:52:14,194 --> 01:52:15,354
Varma sir

1773
01:52:16,529 --> 01:52:18,156
What did you tell Anjali?

1774
01:52:18,598 --> 01:52:21,761
She says she's returning home
She's not prepared to compete

1775
01:52:22,168 --> 01:52:24,728
l had arranged a press meet
this afternoon to introduce her

1776
01:52:24,804 --> 01:52:26,294
What will l tell them?

1777
01:52:27,407 --> 01:52:29,068
-You vagabond?
-What?

1778
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:31,772
Sorry sir, l was speaking here

1779
01:52:32,445 --> 01:52:33,776
Go see who's at the door

1780
01:52:33,847 --> 01:52:35,371
l am in the shower

1781
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:38,815
One minute sir
Where is my other shoe?

1782
01:52:41,054 --> 01:52:41,782
What happened?

1783
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:43,345
l was shocked that's all

1784
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:47,723
Please sit
l mean come inside

1785
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:51,194
l was quite stunned uncle
The trouble came upon so suddenly

1786
01:52:51,297 --> 01:52:54,494
l mean death is so sudden
We can perform the rituals

1787
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:56,592
There are enough days
for the function

1788
01:52:56,736 --> 01:52:58,761
l will call, uncle
Come in aunty

1789
01:52:58,838 --> 01:53:00,396
Come, madam

1790
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:02,740
Please sit madam

1791
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:05,176
What is this sudden
visiting in the morning?

1792
01:53:05,278 --> 01:53:07,246
What is your deal
with Anand Varma?

1793
01:53:07,347 --> 01:53:08,541
Deal?
What deal?

1794
01:53:08,648 --> 01:53:11,208
Did you go to his guest house
to meet him yesterday?

1795
01:53:11,317 --> 01:53:12,750
- Not at all
- No?

1796
01:53:12,852 --> 01:53:13,682
No

1797
01:53:17,657 --> 01:53:21,184
Mr Kumar has seen you
go in and go out

1798
01:53:21,327 --> 01:53:24,558
He got in at 8:15 last night
and got out at 8:22

1799
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:31,567
8:15 to 8:22

1800
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:39,337
Why this stupid laugh?

1801
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:41,413
Did you go to see Varma or not?

1802
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:50,653
No madam
Oh God

1803
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:53,123
You mean Kumar is lying?

1804
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:55,452
Not lying
Lack of brains

1805
01:53:55,895 --> 01:53:59,626
A kind of stupidity that makes him
think goat poop was Chinese potatoes

1806
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:02,133
l did not go to see Anand Varma

1807
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:05,333
But yes, l did go to his guest house

1808
01:54:05,438 --> 01:54:08,771
See, he admitted
Nowthrow him out

1809
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:13,335
Before that, you must step out
l want to talk to madam personally

1810
01:54:13,746 --> 01:54:15,873
Mr Kumar, please stand out side

1811
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:17,908
So now l am out, eh?

1812
01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:22,748
l went to Varma's guest house

1813
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:25,457
To meet his new model

1814
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:29,855
l met her, bribed
threatened and sent her off

1815
01:54:32,665 --> 01:54:34,656
She will not participate
in that contest

1816
01:54:34,767 --> 01:54:39,795
Nor will she won't attend the press meet
Varma has arranged this afternoon

1817
01:54:40,807 --> 01:54:43,469
She is going back to Kerala
as soon as possible

1818
01:54:45,945 --> 01:54:49,574
l offered her money
50,000 Dirham

1819
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:52,679
l hope that's not too much

1820
01:54:53,753 --> 01:54:56,187
lt's okay Satyan
Collect the cash from the office

1821
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:57,654
Narrow escape

1822
01:54:58,758 --> 01:55:01,158
lf she had demanded more...?

1823
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:12,796
Who was that girl?

1824
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:16,205
A poor innocent girl from back home
Otherwise she won't fall forthe money

1825
01:55:16,309 --> 01:55:20,336
That was not what l asked
The girl who came to the farm house

1826
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:27,208
Which girl?

1827
01:55:27,687 --> 01:55:29,814
Afriend of yours
was also with her

1828
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:34,324
But only 2 of us were there

1829
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:36,793
l was alone when l dropped you
home, remember?

1830
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:40,388
l was alone and so were you
There was also a camel there

1831
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:41,933
Camel also was alone

1832
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:43,332
Did l imagine it?

1833
01:55:43,436 --> 01:55:46,803
No doubt at all
You did imagine

1834
01:56:01,521 --> 01:56:03,648
Goodness mother!
What an escape!

1835
01:56:05,391 --> 01:56:06,722
Caught again!

1836
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:12,022
Anjali has come home
She wanted to meet me before she left

1837
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:13,391
What shall l do now?.

1838
01:56:14,567 --> 01:56:18,936
Let me think
Nothing is striking my brains

1839
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:21,373
Okay do what l say

1840
01:56:21,507 --> 01:56:24,635
Don't meet her now
l will come there

1841
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:28,009
Don't worry, she won't leave
l assure you

1842
01:56:45,865 --> 01:56:48,891
YourAnand Varma says
he is scared to face me

1843
01:56:48,968 --> 01:56:51,402
He can't bear the glare in my eyes

1844
01:56:51,471 --> 01:56:54,531
Okay, then let me at least
talk to him overthe phone

1845
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:57,275
- Hello
- 2 kilo

1846
01:56:57,677 --> 01:57:01,704
Hey Varma! l did not know you
were such rascal you ultimate bum

1847
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:05,011
You wanted to take revenge
on me for working for your wife...

1848
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:07,018
...and so brought Anjali here, right?

1849
01:57:07,086 --> 01:57:11,523
Didn't l beg and plead
at yourfeet not to do it?

1850
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:13,090
You never listened to me

1851
01:57:13,626 --> 01:57:17,858
And to top it, l convinced her
it was l who suggested herto come

1852
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:23,095
Foryour sake, l put on act
hugging your wife and...

1853
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:24,768
...made her misunderstand me

1854
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:27,533
l knew she'll go back
home right away

1855
01:57:27,607 --> 01:57:29,074
Who do you think you are?

1856
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:32,470
With a face full of hair, throat full of bass
and the height of a lamp post

1857
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:36,037
lf you think you are fashion king
l am a tailor who can stitch...

1858
01:57:36,115 --> 01:57:37,844
...an underwear for a wild elephant

1859
01:57:37,917 --> 01:57:42,479
You can forget your dreams
to make Anjali anotherAishwarya Rai

1860
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,024
You don't have to face any loss

1861
01:57:45,091 --> 01:57:49,687
Here is the cash you spent to bring her
4 times more...50000 Dirham

1862
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:53,726
And if you think you will
get her on the ramp...

1863
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:56,096
...you will regret it bitterly

1864
01:57:56,436 --> 01:57:57,664
Hang on

1865
01:57:58,571 --> 01:57:59,902
Playing games with me, eh?!

1866
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:04,771
What are you doing here?

1867
01:58:12,485 --> 01:58:15,545
Don't cancel the press meet
l am ready to compete

1868
01:58:26,065 --> 01:58:28,761
l won't allow you to be
trapped in that web of deceit

1869
01:58:28,868 --> 01:58:31,666
l don't need any one else
to decide for me

1870
01:58:32,105 --> 01:58:34,539
Are you going to compete
brushing aside my advice?

1871
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,733
On what basis
can l trust your words?

1872
01:58:36,809 --> 01:58:37,969
Who are you to me?

1873
01:58:38,578 --> 01:58:41,638
l always had a doubt that
you open your mouth only to lie

1874
01:58:41,714 --> 01:58:42,976
Now l am convinced

1875
01:58:43,516 --> 01:58:44,744
Convinced about what?

1876
01:58:44,817 --> 01:58:46,910
That going after me is of no use

1877
01:58:47,019 --> 01:58:50,455
Awoman separated from her husband
will be easierto trap

1878
01:58:50,623 --> 01:58:54,184
Moreover Devika Varma has plenty
of money as well as beauty

1879
01:58:57,997 --> 01:59:00,465
Don't you ever say that to me again

1880
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:16,779
What is it bro?
What happened?

1881
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:18,948
ls Anjali going back?

1882
01:59:22,021 --> 01:59:24,046
No, she won't go back
She will compete

1883
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:27,820
Well, isn't that why you did all this?
Then why have you tears in your eyes?

1884
01:59:29,128 --> 01:59:33,997
lt's nothing
She is very stubborn now

1885
01:59:34,934 --> 01:59:37,630
That persistence will make her win
That's enough for me

1886
01:59:37,737 --> 01:59:41,173
This drama doesn't look too good
l don't think this will work out

1887
01:59:41,641 --> 01:59:45,577
lt will work out
We are only half way through the drama

1888
02:00:09,101 --> 02:00:13,037
How dare you come into my office
in my absence and behave so crudely?

1889
02:00:14,907 --> 02:00:17,273
Here is 50000 Dirham
the bribe you paid her

1890
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:18,499
Give it back

1891
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:20,973
Don't you dare speak

1892
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:24,505
l have stooped so low
forgiving all your atrocities silently

1893
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:27,552
And that is only because
of my consideration for you

1894
02:00:27,653 --> 02:00:30,178
And if you think you can stamp
and crush me down...

1895
02:00:30,289 --> 02:00:32,883
...you will see a different me
All of you

1896
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:35,526
Take it as a challenge if you want

1897
02:00:35,628 --> 02:00:40,258
The forthcoming Asian beauty contest
will be the inauguration of VD's supremacy

1898
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:45,060
And if l don't win it
without any court or case...

1899
02:00:45,137 --> 02:00:48,868
...Devika Varma shall receive her
divorce papers as she wants it

1900
02:00:48,975 --> 02:00:51,637
l am willing to sign
any contract with any condition

1901
02:00:51,777 --> 02:00:54,769
l will forfeit all rights over this company

1902
02:00:54,880 --> 02:01:00,216
But if you try to hinder
my progress in this event

1903
02:01:00,686 --> 02:01:03,587
l will not only beat you
l'll kill and burn you

1904
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:18,598
l want my revenge

1905
02:01:18,704 --> 02:01:21,673
lf l am not back in 10 minutes
please send someone in 5 minutes

1906
02:01:23,809 --> 02:01:26,300
Sir, it's me
Look here

1907
02:01:27,813 --> 02:01:30,213
What a splendid performance sir

1908
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:33,047
But this punch was too much

1909
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,677
That was a reminder

1910
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:37,888
After all this drama

1911
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:42,186
lf l won't get back my Devika

1912
02:01:44,196 --> 02:01:47,859
Take it from me, you won't
get your girlfriend ever

1913
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:56,338
Satya, what is all this?

1914
02:01:56,776 --> 02:01:59,574
l could not catch him
He escaped by the lift

1915
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:00,839
That's not what l asked

1916
02:02:00,913 --> 02:02:03,211
What did you do
in Anand Varma's office?

1917
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:04,840
See what happened was

1918
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:09,114
When we played with 50000 Dirham
he brought out 100000 Dirham

1919
02:02:09,188 --> 02:02:12,715
When he is trying to bamboozle you
do you want me to gape at the sky?

1920
02:02:12,792 --> 02:02:14,589
l went afterthat model
and beat her up

1921
02:02:14,694 --> 02:02:18,152
That was a psychological approach
to destroy her confidence

1922
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,225
l walked through paths
no one chose to go

1923
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,827
Like a madman
like Nakulan did for Ganga

1924
02:02:25,905 --> 02:02:27,964
Sorry, for my good hearted madam, Devika

1925
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:35,779
Madam, please book a locker
no one can steal or break open

1926
02:02:35,881 --> 02:02:38,611
To safeguard the winner's crown

1927
02:02:38,851 --> 02:02:39,909
Are you so sure?

1928
02:02:39,985 --> 02:02:41,919
- Of course
- By what percent

1929
02:02:44,123 --> 02:02:51,791
lf you ask me, when it comes to
a contest we can't say for sure, isn't it?

1930
02:02:52,832 --> 02:02:55,266
Well let me tell you something
l am 100 percent sure about

1931
02:02:56,168 --> 02:02:58,102
lf l lose out on this contest...

1932
02:02:58,738 --> 02:03:00,672
...no one will ever see me alive again

1933
02:03:25,798 --> 02:03:27,891
The contest is for 2 days

1934
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,763
The first day is a test of attitude

1935
02:03:29,869 --> 02:03:32,963
The second day, its costume
and intelligence rounds

1936
02:04:16,916 --> 02:04:19,077
Bro, this is big problem

1937
02:04:19,151 --> 02:04:21,051
lf Anjali wins, madam will die

1938
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,418
lf madam wins, Varma sir
will agree for divorce

1939
02:04:23,522 --> 02:04:27,151
Unless you find a way
forthose to be back together

1940
02:04:27,259 --> 02:04:30,524
Varma sir will not allow
you and Anjali to live together

1941
02:04:30,996 --> 02:04:33,362
Bro, you are playing with death

1942
02:04:36,168 --> 02:04:37,795
Yes, a death game

1943
02:05:40,966 --> 02:05:43,332
Everyone in the world
hates to be a loser

1944
02:05:43,435 --> 02:05:45,062
lts same here

1945
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:48,071
Here, Varma sir, madam
and Anjali want to win

1946
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:49,937
And l must make sure
that they win

1947
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:51,441
How, bro?

1948
02:05:51,644 --> 02:05:53,134
l will lose here

1949
02:05:53,345 --> 02:05:57,611
But until its confirmed
l will try to win

1950
02:07:50,429 --> 02:07:52,021
Where is she?

1951
02:08:37,076 --> 02:08:39,010
Brother, was it good?

1952
02:08:39,111 --> 02:08:40,009
Yes

1953
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:20,476
Hey! What's that?
ls that a horse?

1954
02:09:25,124 --> 02:09:27,024
Pity the guy who marries her

1955
02:09:27,292 --> 02:09:29,021
l wouldn't

1956
02:10:21,713 --> 02:10:24,113
She won't go madam

1957
02:11:06,191 --> 02:11:07,590
Don't worry, sir

1958
02:11:07,893 --> 02:11:10,225
- Now you must do one more-
- Stop it man

1959
02:11:10,829 --> 02:11:12,854
You want to make
a monkey out of me again?

1960
02:11:12,965 --> 02:11:17,265
l am backing out of this contest
An idiot without confidence

1961
02:11:17,402 --> 02:11:18,391
Everything is gone

1962
02:11:18,503 --> 02:11:24,931
My factory, my assets, my image that
l'd built up in so many years, self respect

1963
02:11:25,210 --> 02:11:26,768
Let it go to hell

1964
02:11:27,312 --> 02:11:30,577
But Devika, now she's my enemy in all ways

1965
02:11:30,649 --> 02:11:32,378
You made her be that way

1966
02:11:32,517 --> 02:11:34,883
Go away
l don't want to see you

1967
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:46,763
Sir, as long as l am alive
you will not lose anything

1968
02:11:47,266 --> 02:11:50,463
l understand your pain
more than anyone else

1969
02:11:51,637 --> 02:11:58,873
Anjali who l love most in life
has never told me she cares for me

1970
02:11:59,211 --> 02:12:02,442
But when she moves
farther and farther away...

1971
02:12:02,614 --> 02:12:05,549
...l feel my heart is being broken to bits

1972
02:12:09,288 --> 02:12:14,487
So l can understand
how it must be foryou

1973
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:19,887
Enough, l can't afford
to look like a joker anymore

1974
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:22,993
And l don't want the help
of your crooked mind

1975
02:12:23,802 --> 02:12:29,638
When a guy is sinking in ocean
he does not necessary swim straight

1976
02:12:29,741 --> 02:12:33,541
ln this matter, even if l lose
you will be safe

1977
02:12:33,645 --> 02:12:35,875
That is the only
assurance l can give you

1978
02:12:36,014 --> 02:12:38,312
Forthat, she must
compete what so ever

1979
02:12:38,383 --> 02:12:40,510
Only then we can get
what we set out for

1980
02:12:40,619 --> 02:12:43,452
You can give Anjali
the confidence she needs

1981
02:12:43,555 --> 02:12:46,991
Because she holds you
in high esteem

1982
02:12:49,861 --> 02:12:55,822
Anjali, don't cry
What is the use of crying?

1983
02:12:57,002 --> 02:12:59,903
Listen to me
Get up

1984
02:13:11,016 --> 02:13:13,484
Relax my dear

1985
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:17,382
lt is natural for such things
in any contest

1986
02:13:17,489 --> 02:13:21,289
Your performance
was not 100 percent satisfactory

1987
02:13:21,526 --> 02:13:25,656
But you are one among
the 6 selected for the next round

1988
02:13:25,764 --> 02:13:27,527
That's not a simple thing

1989
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,732
Tomorrow we have 2 rounds

1990
02:13:30,802 --> 02:13:34,499
Leave the costume round to me
l have full confidence there

1991
02:13:34,573 --> 02:13:36,973
The next will be
intelligence round

1992
02:13:37,075 --> 02:13:40,909
Just give sensible answers
to the questions they ask

1993
02:13:40,979 --> 02:13:44,312
That you can very easily accomplish
l am very confident

1994
02:13:44,416 --> 02:13:51,083
lt takes only a minute to win
lf the urge to win is strong

1995
02:14:47,946 --> 02:14:50,744
ln the previous round
she was just a clumsy goose

1996
02:14:50,816 --> 02:14:52,477
Look at her now...stealing the event!

1997
02:14:52,551 --> 02:14:56,078
- Let me scream her out
-You do that l'll slit your throat

1998
02:15:37,062 --> 02:15:38,927
Why is he kissing her?

1999
02:15:40,665 --> 02:15:43,395
Wasn't one kiss years ago
give enough trouble?

2000
02:15:44,002 --> 02:15:46,027
May be it was fatherly

2001
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:49,470
lsn't that wrong usage?

2002
02:15:49,574 --> 02:15:51,599
Get away you oaf!

2003
02:16:12,864 --> 02:16:14,855
Whatever you've done
is more than enough

2004
02:16:14,966 --> 02:16:18,094
Please don't torture
her any more...please

2005
02:16:19,004 --> 02:16:20,699
Shamelessly coming behind

2006
02:16:20,805 --> 02:16:21,931
Let's go, madam

2007
02:17:14,926 --> 02:17:16,791
Didn't l give her an yellow dress?

2008
02:17:20,532 --> 02:17:24,593
Relax madam
Look, it is yellow

2009
02:17:27,939 --> 02:17:30,840
lt is an yellow costume
What has happened to you?

2010
02:17:37,983 --> 02:17:39,541
Greatjob!

2011
02:17:54,065 --> 02:17:55,089
lt's green

2012
02:17:56,067 --> 02:17:58,627
l don't know how do you
think like that, it's yellow

2013
02:18:36,374 --> 02:18:37,705
Thank you, madam

2014
02:18:38,176 --> 02:18:41,771
Hey! Poker'eta
Your magic was fantastic

2015
02:18:57,962 --> 02:19:00,055
Madam, you must not
drink any more

2016
02:19:00,131 --> 02:19:03,589
Alcohol creates weird
effects in the brain

2017
02:19:03,802 --> 02:19:07,363
lt creates illusions in
the unconscious mind...

2018
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:09,737
...and pastes it on
to conscious mind

2019
02:19:09,808 --> 02:19:10,866
lt's a kind of...?

2020
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,640
Brainwashing

2021
02:19:14,713 --> 02:19:17,341
l am not drunk and senseless
lt's just a glass of wine

2022
02:19:17,415 --> 02:19:20,213
Some people don't even need wine

2023
02:19:20,285 --> 02:19:22,344
Bipolar illusionary syndrome

2024
02:19:22,454 --> 02:19:26,083
My professor in Cambridge University
had the same problem

2025
02:19:26,224 --> 02:19:30,957
He was dismissed because he used to
make contradictory statements in class

2026
02:19:31,062 --> 02:19:34,031
But he won the medico-legal case

2027
02:19:34,132 --> 02:19:37,260
The food he ate was turning
to alcohol in his body

2028
02:19:37,669 --> 02:19:41,036
l have noticed earlier also
When you have wine...

2029
02:19:41,172 --> 02:19:45,871
...a slight look of hallucination
in your eyes

2030
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,749
The other day, at the farm house

2031
02:19:59,224 --> 02:20:03,786
Did you not feel there
was a friend and a girl

2032
02:20:04,028 --> 02:20:05,655
But l was alone that day

2033
02:20:06,297 --> 02:20:09,130
Don't you remember
on the way back...

2034
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:14,661
...how you stood fascinated
staring at violet orchids?

2035
02:20:15,373 --> 02:20:17,841
No, l don't remember

2036
02:20:17,909 --> 02:20:19,706
You must remember

2037
02:20:19,811 --> 02:20:22,006
Shall l tell you a shocking truth?

2038
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:27,177
They were not violet orchids
But white lilies

2039
02:20:34,192 --> 02:20:36,422
l came to tell you
a happy bit of news

2040
02:20:36,494 --> 02:20:38,325
But apparently you
are already happy

2041
02:20:41,065 --> 02:20:42,362
Kissing and playing

2042
02:20:45,503 --> 02:20:46,401
What is it?

2043
02:20:46,471 --> 02:20:48,962
2 models were picked
forthe final round

2044
02:20:49,474 --> 02:20:52,443
One is ours and the other
is Varma sir's model

2045
02:20:54,779 --> 02:20:57,976
lt's good you came now Kumar

2046
02:20:58,149 --> 02:21:01,482
l have been wanting
to tell madam one more thing

2047
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:06,188
You once set me a task
to raise the profit level

2048
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:10,990
Those days the man who helped me
achieve it was this Pushpakumar

2049
02:21:11,129 --> 02:21:12,824
May be more than me

2050
02:21:14,132 --> 02:21:15,531
- lsn't it?
- ls it?

2051
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:19,459
Yes

2052
02:21:19,571 --> 02:21:22,062
But madam, you are not seeing all this

2053
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:24,533
Forgive me for being frank

2054
02:21:24,809 --> 02:21:27,437
Many things you ought to notice
escapes your eyes

2055
02:21:27,512 --> 02:21:29,207
And sees things
which are not there

2056
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:31,805
People fearyou and that's why
no one says anything

2057
02:21:31,916 --> 02:21:33,076
lsn't it Kumar?

2058
02:21:33,184 --> 02:21:34,151
That's true

2059
02:21:35,286 --> 02:21:39,848
Can l ask you something?
lt's only a doubt

2060
02:21:40,425 --> 02:21:44,759
That day, the scene where you saw
Varma sir kissing a model

2061
02:21:44,863 --> 02:21:46,091
Was it real?

2062
02:21:46,498 --> 02:21:49,934
Or was it just an illusion like this?

2063
02:21:55,006 --> 02:21:59,340
Mr Kumar, were you
not there, that day?

2064
02:21:59,410 --> 02:22:00,877
Yes, l was

2065
02:22:01,946 --> 02:22:05,313
Was it something
only madam witnessed?

2066
02:22:05,383 --> 02:22:07,442
lf you ask me...?

2067
02:22:07,519 --> 02:22:09,953
You must say whether
you saw it or not

2068
02:22:10,021 --> 02:22:12,819
But if you say you saw
something that was not there...!

2069
02:22:12,891 --> 02:22:14,586
Do you have madam's well being at heart?

2070
02:22:14,859 --> 02:22:18,454
Did you see Varma sir
kissing that model?

2071
02:22:18,963 --> 02:22:20,362
l did not see clearly

2072
02:22:20,431 --> 02:22:21,591
Okay

2073
02:22:21,833 --> 02:22:25,894
Madam saw it and since
l was with madam, l must have seen it

2074
02:22:25,970 --> 02:22:28,495
- My question is if you saw it
- No, l did not

2075
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:33,541
So you have not seen

2076
02:22:37,482 --> 02:22:41,612
Think it over
Did you actually see-

2077
02:22:46,925 --> 02:22:50,224
Don't think of anything
Just relax

2078
02:22:50,328 --> 02:22:51,590
Kumar, let's go

2079
02:22:56,367 --> 02:23:01,327
Why did you make me tell
such a big lie?

2080
02:23:02,073 --> 02:23:07,636
This was the only way to get you
back your old position

2081
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:09,869
Really?

2082
02:23:11,549 --> 02:23:12,948
What's all this?!

2083
02:23:13,217 --> 02:23:15,913
My own father has not
shown me so much love

2084
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:18,349
Where is he now?.

2085
02:23:18,423 --> 02:23:20,983
l had to kill him
in a peculiar situation

2086
02:23:21,659 --> 02:23:23,593
Were you not tried in court?

2087
02:23:23,695 --> 02:23:26,391
They let me free
on grounds of insanity

2088
02:23:27,398 --> 02:23:30,526
Now l am okay
l am on medication

2089
02:23:30,602 --> 02:23:34,003
l am taking twice a day
what has to be had 3 times a day

2090
02:27:17,795 --> 02:27:20,423
We all know the story
of Jean Val Jean

2091
02:27:22,934 --> 02:27:28,270
Readers all over the world empathized
with him, even though he broke the law

2092
02:27:28,406 --> 02:27:31,842
Stealing bread, he may have been
a wrong doer in the eyes of the baker

2093
02:27:31,943 --> 02:27:36,710
But when he gave food
to the woman dying of hunger...

2094
02:27:36,814 --> 02:27:38,714
...he became God to her

2095
02:27:41,485 --> 02:27:46,616
lt is our own perspective
that makes a person a criminal

2096
02:27:46,724 --> 02:27:51,127
We often forget to see
that person's mental situation

2097
02:27:51,195 --> 02:27:53,686
l too have a personal
experience like that

2098
02:27:53,831 --> 02:27:58,859
l realized too late l had lost
my love because l listened to others

2099
02:28:00,271 --> 02:28:03,365
lt remains a pain from then till today

2100
02:28:03,507 --> 02:28:08,945
When we accuse a person we never
realize what prompted him to do it

2101
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:14,347
Neither do we realize
the guilt he faces in life

2102
02:28:15,419 --> 02:28:19,219
lf in just a moment of wrong doing
or misunderstanding...

2103
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:24,421
...we lose a person, then
that will be the biggest tragedy

2104
02:28:28,366 --> 02:28:30,732
Awrong we commit
that can never be rectified

2105
02:28:34,505 --> 02:28:40,341
To err is human
but to forgive is divine

2106
02:30:37,495 --> 02:30:39,861
- Let go of me
- Bro?!

2107
02:31:06,824 --> 02:31:08,314
Get up, bro

2108
02:31:13,764 --> 02:31:15,629
Devika madam asked me
to give you this

2109
02:31:15,699 --> 02:31:16,666
lt's a blank cheque

2110
02:31:16,734 --> 02:31:18,497
Go throw it back at her face

2111
02:31:19,703 --> 02:31:22,069
My job was reconcile them

2112
02:31:22,406 --> 02:31:25,136
Since l have made it possible
l must now leave the arena

2113
02:31:25,376 --> 02:31:26,400
l must go

2114
02:31:30,514 --> 02:31:33,972
Was he upset because of what l said?
Blank cheque meant unlimited cash

2115
02:31:34,051 --> 02:31:35,746
You can take as much as you want

2116
02:31:46,664 --> 02:31:48,427
Goodness!

2117
02:32:02,413 --> 02:32:05,940
'For the king among lairs
ln gratitude for everything'

2118
02:32:06,016 --> 02:32:08,746
'With lots of love
Devika Varma'

2119
02:32:27,505 --> 02:32:31,839
Varma told me that you were
the reason for my winning the contest

2120
02:32:33,077 --> 02:32:36,137
l know what you feel towards me

2121
02:32:36,247 --> 02:32:39,114
But l have not till nowtold you...

2122
02:32:39,917 --> 02:32:44,547
Didn't l mention on stage
about my love which l lost?

2123
02:32:46,190 --> 02:32:49,091
lt's true
There is a person

2124
02:32:49,193 --> 02:32:53,562
Who was forced to leave our town
branded as a thief for my sake...

2125
02:32:53,697 --> 02:32:55,187
...my friend, Satyanarayanan

2126
02:32:56,500 --> 02:33:01,528
Till yesterday he was a dream
that could ever come back

2127
02:33:01,605 --> 02:33:06,008
But today, when all my dreams
are slowly coming true...

2128
02:33:06,110 --> 02:33:10,103
...my heart tells me that
he will also come back to me

2129
02:33:10,814 --> 02:33:14,511
l feel he is here somewhere nearby

2130
02:33:21,892 --> 02:33:23,951
l won't ever forget you, Naran

2131
02:33:24,195 --> 02:33:30,225
You are my very good
You are my...

2132
02:33:35,206 --> 02:33:39,142
Yes...l am your Satyanarayanan

2133
02:33:44,281 --> 02:33:46,943
l promise, l am Satyan
your childhood sweetheart

2134
02:34:07,571 --> 02:34:09,163
Aren't you ashamed?

2135
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,935
When will you ever
mend your ways?

2136
02:34:12,243 --> 02:34:14,302
l swear up on my mother

2137
02:34:14,545 --> 02:34:16,103
Your mother!
l'll kick you

2138
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:18,910
You do that and we may not
have kids in future

2139
02:34:19,350 --> 02:34:25,289
lf you doubt me ask your dad
when l stopped school in the 7th grade

2140
02:34:25,556 --> 02:34:27,183
Forsake of you discarded the exams

2141
02:34:27,291 --> 02:34:31,022
While we were studying l gave you
ripen mango, and l ate rotten pine apple

2142
02:34:31,195 --> 02:34:34,562
''Clever and fantastic guy
Liar of liars, he's a king liar''

2143
02:34:38,302 --> 02:34:39,564
Why here?

2144
02:34:39,637 --> 02:34:43,903
Next week, the global village reopening
Dad is maintenance supervisor

2145
02:34:43,974 --> 02:34:46,169
There's no school today
so we came along with him

2146
02:34:46,243 --> 02:34:47,232
Why are you here Rahul?

2147
02:34:47,344 --> 02:34:51,303
My dad has ideas
of buying up the global village

2148
02:34:51,582 --> 02:34:54,016
He has gone for a test
as soon as he comes he'll buy it up

2149
02:34:54,118 --> 02:34:55,949
l just came to look around

2150
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:58,113
What test?
ls he unwell?

2151
02:34:58,188 --> 02:35:00,952
You don't know my papa?

2152
02:35:02,393 --> 02:35:03,621
This is Dhoni

2153
02:35:03,694 --> 02:35:07,562
Yes, my papa is in Australia now

2154
02:35:09,933 --> 02:35:10,900
Papa!

2155
02:35:11,068 --> 02:35:13,730
Papa?! But you said
Dhoni was your papa

2156
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:19,300
This is not papa
He is Pappan

2157
02:35:19,376 --> 02:35:20,274
What?

2158
02:35:20,344 --> 02:35:21,368
He's lying

2159
02:35:21,612 --> 02:35:23,011
He is our driver

2160
02:35:23,814 --> 02:35:24,906
Driver?

2161
02:35:25,015 --> 02:35:28,280
Even though a driver don't ever
misuse yourfreedom, okay?

2162
02:35:28,385 --> 02:35:29,317
l will-

2163
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:31,146
Stop right there!

2164
02:35:31,288 --> 02:35:33,256
Haven't l told you never to tell lies?

2165
02:35:33,324 --> 02:35:36,316
Yes, but somehow l got used to it

2166
02:35:38,929 --> 02:35:46,335
''l rowed across an ocean of lies
to anchor nearyou...yesterday''

2167
02:35:47,237 --> 02:35:53,767
''Cunning liar that you are, yet
sweet like a ripe mango...bluff-master''

2168
02:35:55,646 --> 02:35:58,046
''How sweet are pretences?''

2169
02:35:58,148 --> 02:36:00,810
''Like sipping nectar in delight''

2170
02:36:00,918 --> 02:36:04,115
''For that you must be
beside me...like this''

2171
02:36:06,890 --> 02:36:13,295
''l rowed across an ocean of lies
to anchor nearyou...yesterday''

2172
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:21,694
''Cunning liar that you are, yet
sweet like a ripe mango...bluff-master''

2173
02:36:40,324 --> 02:36:49,790
''Crept into your heart in secret
Once upon a time this liar fervor''

2174
02:36:51,468 --> 02:37:00,433
''Taking shyness away in his wake
lf only it could come back again''

2175
02:37:02,746 --> 02:37:06,375
''What will you do
lf l come near you?''

2176
02:37:07,951 --> 02:37:10,351
''l'll catch and bind you-''
