1
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,762
Hey... Open the door!

2
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,117
Just a second...

3
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,383
You stupid...

4
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,290
You stupid.

5
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,198
Where were you last night, huh?

6
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,067
Who did you sleep with stupid?

7
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,598
Come on! Get up!

8
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,262
Tell me.

9
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,639
With whom did you go!

10
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,326
Who did you sleep with? You stupid!

11
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,112
Get up, you stupid!

12
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,533
You thought no one will
get to know, didn't you?

13
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,470
- Please don't hurt me!
- Get off!

14
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,348
Hey... hey!

15
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:43,676
Ask your dad to come
and take you tomorrow

16
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,688
Get out! You ruined my life!

17
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,419
Did you understand anything?

18
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,135
No

19
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,242
Not really.

20
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,600
Something's missing, right?

21
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,147
Um...

22
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,375
Tarak... is missing

23
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,480
This is him

24
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,673
Watch it carefully...

25
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,442
Stupid!

26
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,373
Open the door!

27
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,872
Just a second...

28
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,949
You stupid!

29
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,448
You stupid!

30
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,027
Where were you last night, huh?

31
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,296
Who did you sleep with stupid?

32
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,794
Come on! Get up!

33
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,267
Tell me. Who did you sleep with?

34
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,526
You stupid!

35
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:01,519
Get up, you non-sense!

36
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,540
You thought...

37
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,596
...no one will get
to know, didn't you?

38
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,698
Please don't hurt me!
- Die!

39
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,905
Hey... hey! Ask your dad...

40
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,511
Ask your dad to come
and take you tomorrow

41
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,428
Die, you stupid!

42
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,111
What did the doctor say?

43
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,181
Your son didn't go today either

44
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,484
That makes it two days

45
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,784
The doctor was asking

46
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,989
whether it is work related
trouble or something else

47
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,703
I said no

48
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,279
When I came out of the clinic

49
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,680
I saw him standing on
the other side of the road

50
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,938
What did he say?

51
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,903
Does he ever say anything?

52
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,677
Here...

53
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,169
Ufff... Why don't you
switch that thing off?

54
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,572
If you keep missing appointments
like this, no doctor will treat you

55
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,024
Hey...

56
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,370
This table has become all shaky

57
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,249
The medicines broke
- Hey! Don't touch it!

58
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,341
There's broken glass...
get a broom quickly

59
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,220
Get the medicine on your way to work

60
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,677
4 tablets per dose

61
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,373
It'll cool your head

62
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,698
Psychiatrist? Am I nuts or what?

63
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,291
Have you seen the other patients?

64
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,726
Each one has a screw loose

65
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,074
Work during daytime instead
of working through the night

66
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,551
A good night's sleep is essential

67
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,920
However much you sleep
during the day, it's not the same.

68
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,562
Tell them today that you
will only work during the day

69
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,865
Are you listening to me?

70
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,810
She keeps asking
about my work and giggles

71
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,842
She says, "You work in your underwear...
Don't people find that funny?

72
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,497
I tell her that the sounds of clothing

73
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,581
have to be made into a separate track

74
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,565
She just laughs

75
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,225
She won't understand till
I bring her here and make her watch

76
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,963
Then bring her!

77
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,132
The pigeons are in reel 4, right?

78
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm carrying them...

79
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,523
Pigeons!

80
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,655
I made these today

81
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,695
Brilliant! They're in place

82
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,752
I'm taking them on another track

83
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,044
Ready Rolling.

84
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,545
What are you doing?

85
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,545
Please hold this

86
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,686
What are you up to?

87
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,754
Just hold it

88
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,113
Now...

89
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,277
throw it at the birds

90
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,663
Please sir! Just once

91
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,057
Go ahead

92
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,441
What are you doing? What is this?

93
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,229
Please, just listen to this

94
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,061
The sound of wings! Pigeon's wings

95
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,901
In films, the sound that
is recorded cannot be kept

96
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,445
Because there is a
lot of unwanted noise

97
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,895
The sound of the camera rolling,
car horns, people's voices...

98
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,846
So to eliminate that, an entirely
new sound is created in the studio

99
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,327
I know... dubbing

100
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:08,118
Yes... dubbing is basically voice
dubbing. The spoken word is dubbed

101
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,976
What about the other sounds?

102
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,944
Realize the pain of taking

103
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,859
so many pigeons inside
the studio? That is why...

104
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,970
I've heard that
Hollywood uses live sound

105
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,990
Yes... That happens here
as well but not necessarily

106
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,994
Like I was reading...
Basic Instinct... Have you seen it?

107
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,597
Sharon Stone and... and...
and... and...

108
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,855
Michael Douglas

109
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:37,750
So... in Basic Instinct...
all sounds are studio sounds

110
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,902
Really?

111
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:44,462
Yes! For instance in the
scene where they make love

112
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,078
Sharon Stone and
Michael Douglas obviously

113
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,764
didn't go to the studios
to recreate those sounds

114
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:48,810
What do you mean?

115
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,108
It's foley sound

116
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,574
Is that true?

117
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,333
Yes! What you're in
fact hearing is... uh...

118
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,224
The sound of a foley artist
slobbering on his forearm!

119
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,823
Yuck! Really?

120
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,726
What do you mean?

121
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,014
The sound of a champagne
cork opening... look...

122
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,947
Are you joining films?

123
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,038
Have you seen "Mahaguru"?

124
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,136
"Mahaguru"?

125
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,674
When superstar Mithun
gets off his car

126
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,509
and stands with
a click of his boot...

127
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,743
Whose sound is that?
- Whose?

128
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:18,811
You think it's his? I did it!

129
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,841
Really?!

130
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,216
All the stars... everything they do...
Bumba, Mithun, Deb, Jeet...

131
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,471
...all of them work on my sound.
Whatever they do.

132
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,940
Walking, running, fighting...

133
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,489
Everything is my sound

134
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,224
Goutam Ghosh, Aparna Sen...

135
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,103
Rituparno Ghosh, Buddhadev Dasgupta...

136
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,211
I've worked with everyone

137
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,096
I've been working since
I passed out of school

138
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,661
I see...

139
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,502
How long does each
film take to finish?

140
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,036
9 of my films have
won National Awards!

141
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,938
Really!
- One more and it'll be 10

142
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,540
You must be minting money boss!

143
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,008
Why are you running
after life insurance?

144
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,745
I mean, if you keep working days
and nights you'll lose your vitality!

145
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,180
You don't need to work like this.

146
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,435
You should stick to one thing,
that'll be better for you.

147
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,983
Father goes this way everyday

148
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,520
Can't he make time and come here?

149
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,592
How many times has he
visited since you got married?

150
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,864
Now that his son-in-law is
unwell he should pay a visit

151
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,503
Call if you need money

152
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,819
That is not why I'm saying all this

153
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,402
Why does he have to be so annoyed?

154
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,658
I didn't select a
characterless villain to be my husband

155
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,993
Oh! Forget about all that!

156
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,511
Tell me something, is
Tarak going completely deaf?

157
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,317
No, no! He can hear everything...
he just doesn't pay attention

158
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,088
He lives in his own little world

159
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,940
When we go to the movies,
all he does is talk about foley

160
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,241
This sound didn't match,

161
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,259
that didn't sound right,
this is wrong, that is wrong...

162
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,029
He doesn't even remember the story

163
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,175
Keep this. 10 thousand...

164
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,026
Let me know if you need more

165
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,905
Mother, I'll send you the car

166
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,553
Mr. Sharma, I'm going to the site.
Please come over there.

167
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,588
Yes, all right, I'll just be there.

168
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,500
Here...

169
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,400
Keep it. Your father has sent it

170
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,228
I don't understand why you
selected him out of all the...

171
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,971
If I need anything I'll ask for it

172
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,943
Have I ever told you
I'm living in poverty?

173
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,057
When were you asked to come?

174
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,562
Huh?

175
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,961
When did Sir ask you to come?

176
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,840
2pm today

177
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:10,503
I had specifically told you to
call on the 21st before coming

178
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,018
But the due date is...

179
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,583
Next month. 10th

180
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,147
There is enough time

181
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,009
Why don't you obey the
instructions that are given to you?

182
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,538
This is the 2nd time
you've made such a mistake

183
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,051
Insurance policies aren't the
only thing on his mind you know

184
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,181
You agents are obsessed!

185
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,549
Here... don't lose it

186
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:39,936
Are you busy?

187
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,401
No...

188
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,309
I'll just take five minutes

189
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,222
Sure... Please come in

190
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,174
Thanks.

191
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,912
How is Tarak doing?

192
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,641
He's having to strain
himself in order to listen

193
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,983
Is he going deaf?

194
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,225
I don't think so

195
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,234
If it was a hearing
problem you would've

196
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,113
been the first to know, isn't it?

197
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,043
When he's working in
the studio with you...

198
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,628
does he have any
trouble taking orders?

199
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,872
Not really no?

200
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,438
He can hear everything...

201
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,420
Yet I've had to give
him a hearing test.

202
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,640
In order to rule out any doubt

203
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,110
Then what exactly is the problem?

204
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,107
Which of these faders
are for the dialogues?

205
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,598
These. Why?

206
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,754
The scene you showed me last day...

207
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,540
Which one?

208
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,346
The one with the drunk fellow...

209
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,275
Yes. Hmm...

210
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,131
Could you show me that once again?

211
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,514
Hmm... Sure.

212
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,265
Thanks... Just play the same scene

213
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,650
Hey... Open the door!

214
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,460
Open the door!

215
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,394
Just a second...

216
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,488
Could you reduce the
volume for the dialogue track?

217
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,373
You stupid!

218
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,303
A little more

219
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,366
This is how Tarak hears everything

220
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,745
Less words, more effects

221
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,559
Effects... as in?

222
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,125
Real life sounds

223
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:26,319
While working in the studio he
hears the scenes without the dialogues

224
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,827
I have a feeling that after doing
this continuously over a period...

225
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,732
He is slowly developing
an obsession for sound

226
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,687
As a result of which he
concentrates more on ambient

227
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,290
sound rather than on
spoken word, I've noticed

228
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,376
When I give him
instructions during a recording,

229
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,408
he perfectly follows all of it

230
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,601
That is possibly because he's hearing

231
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,937
your instructions over the headphones

232
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,318
No external sound is disturbing him

233
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,045
Can I inspect this room?

234
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,405
Hmm... Sure

235
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,906
Tarak's wife feels he's lost
all interest in married life

236
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,787
Tarak has been
telling me that for a while

237
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,351
But according to what you have
to say, that is not the case

238
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,469
Coffee?

239
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,318
No, I'll be leaving soon

240
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,329
It is very normal for her to think so

241
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:45,828
But after so many
sessions with them I'm sure

242
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:54,380
he is not disinterested or he
is not avoiding responsibilities

243
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,579
He's cleared all the tests.

244
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,929
Which sound is this?

245
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,502
Toy train...

246
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,337
Oh! Amazing!

247
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:15,401
But according to her he is
preoccupied. All the time

248
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,499
In fact he doesn't
realize or want to believe that

249
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,367
Thats because he's in constant denial

250
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,495
In fact he missed two
appointments with me

251
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,531
I've been forced to call him
home for the next sitting.

252
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,875
Lets see what happens

253
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,403
Maybe he's a little uncomfortable
among all the other patients

254
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,851
Is this actually a disease?

255
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,622
That is very difficult to say

256
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:48,532
Simply because we have never
heard of such a case before

257
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,739
Maybe this is a temporary obsession

258
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:57,008
A... creative obsession with sound

259
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:03,376
Maybe... But if we ignore this,
it might lead to permanent damage

260
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,333
As in? Permanent
damage as in he'll go deaf?

261
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,603
No! He'll hear everything but...

262
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,791
He won't understand human speech?
How is that possible?

263
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,090
I'm not saying it
will happen. It might

264
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,557
We have to keep the
possibilities in mind

265
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,501
I'll explain it like this

266
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,735
These words that we hear,

267
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,757
they, by themselves
don't mean anything

268
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,625
They represent certain
things which are decoded

269
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,675
and interpreted by the brain

270
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:42,621
In Tarak's case, human speech
is not registering in his brain

271
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,157
This interpretation is
also not taking place

272
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,440
And this is getting to be a habit

273
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,194
He might get conditioned

274
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,507
Absolutely

275
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:56,168
If his mind gets conditioned to
not interpreting human speech...

276
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,418
then he will hear but the words

277
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,788
will have no more
meaning to him than...

278
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,523
The click of a
telegraph key for someone

279
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,624
who does not know the Morse code

280
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
The Morse code!

281
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,911
This is goddamn serious!

282
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,629
It is

283
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,662
Now what?

284
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,747
It is very important
to make him cooperate

285
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:23,959
My immediate job is to make him
admit that there is indeed a problem

286
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,282
Hey! Listen to what she's saying

287
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,430
I'm saying that

288
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,850
the reports of your hearing
test are absolutely perfect

289
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,060
Your ears are absolutely fine

290
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,892
She worries for no reason

291
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,025
Someone's put this
thought into her head

292
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,702
My work is in 'sound'.
How can I be deaf?

293
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:11,945
Exactly

294
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,200
How weird... Can a man not be
a little distracted at times?

295
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,590
Do you listen to
everything all the time?

296
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,259
I keep saying there's
nothing wrong with me...

297
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,945
but no! Visiting the doctor is a must!

298
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:27,310
But today I'm no doctor.
I'm not a doctor at home

299
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,855
I'm not your doctor,
you're not my patient.

300
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:33,248
Does a doctor ever
invite her patient for coffee

301
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,508
Oh! I completely forgot!
What'll you have? Tea, coffee...?

302
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,943
Oh no no... Not today... Lets go...

303
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,926
How long will it take? Please sit...

304
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,962
Sit... I'll get it for you

305
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,234
Hey, Mithu? - Yes, Ma'am?

306
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,586
Can't you sit for 5 minutes?

307
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,738
She just said everything is fine!

308
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:53,058
You've already started
making tea? - Yes. - Set the tray.

309
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,903
You'll make me lose my mind!

310
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,839
Everything's all right.

311
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,991
Be careful. - Yes.

312
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:08,117
Your wife has never told me
that you have a hearing problem,

313
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,741
that you're going deaf

314
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,758
In fact, I feel it is not a
problem related to hearing at all

315
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,501
You feel...?

316
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,817
Then why did you Ask me to
get the tests done? How weird!

317
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:19,813
Keep quiet.

318
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,238
He has a very short temper

319
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,174
This is the process of
treating you, simple

320
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,092
In order to understand
what the problem is,

321
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,361
where it is, why it is happening...

322
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,186
What is it?

323
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,884
But you're saying there is no problem!

324
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,531
There is...

325
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,996
There is a problem

326
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,752
There is no problem with your hearing,

327
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:45,660
but there is a problem
with your method of hearing

328
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,208
You know what...

329
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,367
...if you want to, You can
hear everything everyone says

330
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,905
But you don't concentrate
on who is saying what

331
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:08,416
The reason being the fact
that ambient sounds attract you

332
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,022
Sound effects trap
your thought process

333
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,098
Am I clear?

334
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,644
Am I?

335
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,461
We lived in the same neighbourhood

336
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,730
I know him for a very long time

337
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,469
He was never like this...
Everything was fine

338
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,072
Everything will be fine

339
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:42,115
As I was saying, he
might want to hear us.

340
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,761
He is hearing us...

341
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,858
But at the moment the
sounds in the kitchen

342
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,359
or the sound of a passing car...

343
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:55,057
Building construction, cycle bell,
the pressure cooker...

344
00:26:55,347 --> 00:27:00,872
these sounds are occupying his brain

345
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,088
He cant hear us talking

346
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,621
Maybe he's thinking

347
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:11,783
of how he can recreate
these sounds in the studio

348
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,993
I'm listening!

349
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,267
Please continue.

350
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,523
I hope you have heard me.

351
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,045
We need to find a way out of this

352
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,007
Isn't it?

353
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,911
We will find a way

354
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,112
Look, you are a talented artist

355
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:47,286
A creative person always needs rest

356
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,033
Go somewhere.

357
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:56,894
Away from the city. Away
from the maddening crowd

358
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,929
Take a vacation where
there is no loud noise.

359
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,772
Take a trip there.

360
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,562
What have I been saying?

361
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,210
What have I been saying?

362
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,816
Now do you realize
that there is a problem?

363
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,939
Coffee!

364
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,240
Coffee!

365
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,149
Coffee!

366
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,719
Coffee! Coffee!

367
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,807
It's 10 o'clock.

368
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,912
Do you want to eat now?

369
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,047
What?

370
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,009
Damn!

371
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,785
Eggs! Boiled eggs!

372
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,227
Eggs! Boiled eggs!

373
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,491
Boiled eggs! Eggs!

374
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,070
Give it to me.

375
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:23,694
Listen, I'm texting you a number.
Call when you reach Siliguri

376
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,097
My cousin. He'll get a car.

377
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,542
He's made all the arrangements.
Just go with him. OK?

378
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,944
Have you noticed the horse draw?

379
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,732
carriages in front of
the Victoria Memorial?

380
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:55,974
Hmm...

381
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,698
Let me give you a riddle to solve...

382
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,600
What comes with a carriage,

383
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,672
goes with a carriage, is
of no use to the carriage

384
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,783
and yet the carriage
can not move without it.

385
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:12,892
Tell me...

386
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,167
What goes with the carriage umm...

387
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,356
Noise

388
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,301
Take this.

389
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,162
Read... It might help you

390
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,569
S.S. Stevens

391
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,569
Thank you Sir

392
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:36,374
Stevens... an authority on sound
and hearing, Harvard University

393
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,240
I'll let you know if
I get anything else

394
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,543
You think I'm very helpful, right?

395
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,742
What's his name? Our foley man

396
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:45,620
Tarak

397
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,564
Tarak.

398
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,389
Such a unique case...

399
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,558
There is so much to
know even at this age

400
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:56,935
Yes

401
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:57,599
Exactly.

402
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,492
Are you using the internet?

403
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,109
Yes

404
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,466
To tell you honestly...

405
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:12,090
Actually I'm wondering if
acoustic neuroma might set in

406
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,382
It's good.

407
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,157
Look...

408
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,685
...noise is a common
cause for hearing loss

409
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,147
Not just in Kolkata...
Even in the United States...

410
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,283
20% of the working
population are exposed to

411
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,457
noise that is potentially
dangerous for their hearing

412
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,469
And your patient...

413
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,126
the sounds he listens to...

414
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,133
the kind of
concentration he has to put in...

415
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,267
in a studio environment...

416
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,988
...these are potentially
dangerous for his hearing

417
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,710
Yes... but in Tarak's case
this does not apply because...

418
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:54,150
Noise is not causing any
hearing loss... as of now

419
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,278
He can hear everything

420
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,060
In fact he is...

421
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,860
even listening to sounds that
even we are not attentive to

422
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,297
The world of sound is
probably fascinating

423
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,665
God knows what he listens to

424
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,053
Let me know of the
outcome after he comes back...

425
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,855
whether he responds... how he responds

426
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,488
Right. Let's see.

427
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,612
He hasn't gone alone, right?

428
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:49,338
You know, acoustic disease
can sometimes lead to...

429
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,813
vertigo...

430
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,640
depression and even
suicidal tendencies

431
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,808
You have to remember that acoustics...

432
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:05,314
the meaning of acoustics is the
science of sound and its control

433
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,167
Control...

434
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,463
...is the key word

435
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,138
Especially...

436
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,397
...in the case of your patient

437
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:15,770
What happened?

438
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,981
What are you looking at?

439
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,205
I am the best!

440
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,206
Hello...

441
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,969
Huh? Today?

442
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,539
Yes, come over then... yes

443
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:40,777
No, at the chamber.
Call me around 5:30

444
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:46,047
Yes, yes at 5:30.
Call and come over...

445
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,397
...right

446
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,763
'Each morning, Meena and her
trackers leave for small town'.

447
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,565
'They drive into the Gia forest'.

448
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,110
'Meena is here to keep her... '

449
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:34,918
What are you doing here?

450
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,092
Just...

451
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,815
So why didn't you call me?

452
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:41,539
I was trying to match your
footsteps... like you do in the studio

453
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,020
So you're imitating foley work?

454
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,287
You think it's that easy?

455
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,130
It wasn't matching at all...
See I caught you

456
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,913
Even I have trouble matching...
actually it takes practice

457
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,735
You walk, I'll do it. Walk

458
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,539
No way.

459
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,251
Walk! lt'll be fun. Go ahead

460
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,418
Walk, jump, do anything.

461
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,915
I'll match it.

462
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,179
Come on

463
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,190
I matched it.

464
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,799
Keep going.

465
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,772
Oh no.

466
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,497
Oh I missed it.

467
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,495
Stop it, now.

468
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,950
No I can do it. Keep going.

469
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,167
Uh...

470
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,046
What do you look at me
like I'm some devil...

471
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,880
There's nothing wrong with me

472
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,317
There's nothing wrong with me.

473
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,356
Can I tell you something?

474
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,231
Promise me you won't get mad?

475
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,202
I'll drink a little today.
It's too cold

476
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,709
You have some too!

477
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:34,579
Rubbish!

478
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,683
Listen to the sounds very carefully

479
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,122
I'm opening this bottle... sound

480
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,804
Sound!

481
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,427
Here, I'm pouring... sound

482
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,341
I put down the bottle...
thats a sound

483
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,312
I pour water...

484
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:17,852
the sound of water

485
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,787
Such sounds are all around us

486
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,134
Here...

487
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,285
I won't have any more...
it tastes terrible

488
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,857
Come on... you're feeling shy...
go ahead! No one's looking

489
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,369
What if my head spins?

490
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,047
Huh?

491
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,248
If I fall ill?

492
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,233
That'll make two of us! Go on

493
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,945
You see this fire burning...
thats making a sound as well

494
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,786
You can't create a fire in
the recording studio for that

495
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:02,870
Close your eyes...

496
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,363
Please! Close your eyes

497
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,116
Now open your eyes

498
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,547
There's a fire burning in my hands!

499
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,081
You see how great an art it is?

500
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,048
Take your cardigan...

501
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:35,903
take it...

502
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,008
Put the button on

503
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,769
Put it on

504
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,235
Guess how this is recorded

505
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:56,926
Magic!

506
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,545
This is a great form of art

507
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,215
You know what Anup sir says

508
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:09,527
He says, "Sound is the universe!"

509
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,455
We don't listen carefully, Ratna

510
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,599
There are a lot of sounds...

511
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,329
a lot of sounds without
which the world would seem mute

512
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:23,685
You'll hear them too

513
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,141
Listen... quietly... listen

514
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,435
Do you hear that?

515
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:56,400
If you can't recreate these sounds,
there is no cinema

516
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,875
No matter how great the story is,
the camera is or the music is

517
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:06,281
Like we have faith...
cinema has sound

518
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:11,454
That is the heart of the film...

519
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:14,926
Understand?

520
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:28,001
With each sound... the film
slowly starts coming to life!

521
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,943
This is what I do...

522
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,013
...lt's not easy!

523
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:37,244
lf it was that simple there
would be thousands like Tarak Dutta

524
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,489
But are there?

525
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,216
One day I will die...

526
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,548
but my sounds will remain

527
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:53,662
These films that go to London,
Paris, Germany, Japan...

528
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,226
Just imagine how many
people are listening to my work

529
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,328
They don't know me but
they're listening to my work!

530
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,153
The President knows
the name of my films

531
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:07,205
But people from my hometown
don't know who I am... what I do

532
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,346
Superstars are not everything you know

533
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,029
Who's giving that punch?

534
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,161
Tarak!

535
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,834
When he's clicking his fingers
like this... who's doing it actually?

536
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:17,830
Tarak!

537
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,955
Kicks, punches, footsteps...
everything is done by Tarak

538
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:25,175
No matter how many
people are on screen...

539
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,157
every sound is created by me

540
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,161
That doctor doesn't
understand because she is an idiot!

541
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,134
If I don't listen carefully who will?

542
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,154
A poet thinks about poetry...

543
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,323
a singer thinks about tunes

544
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,991
An artist thinks about colours

545
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,281
And when I think about
sound I'm mentally ill?

546
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:46,462
What?

547
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,086
Why're you crying? I didn't
say anything to make you cry

548
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,251
You were the first
person to get this idea

549
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,937
Who put this into your head?
That I'm unwell?

550
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,554
Who did it? Your brother?

551
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,197
Your mother?

552
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,395
Who called the doctor?

553
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,602
Shukla

554
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,439
Who?

555
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,332
Shukla... the owner of my boutique

556
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,978
A friend of her's

557
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:16,770
Shukla, the owner, informed Swati,
the doctor. Did I not hear you?

558
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,047
Some people gave you this idea
and you went running to the doctor

559
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,545
You just ruined my mood

560
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,385
Damn! You must be thinking I'm a fool.

561
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,262
Come inside. You'll catch a cold

562
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,067
I told Shukla because I was worried

563
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,506
You don't listen to anything I say

564
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,372
All you talk about is sound

565
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,613
You can hear if you concentrate.

566
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,812
Hey! Are you listening to me?

567
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,049
He called me early this morning

568
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,079
What did he say?

569
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:26,475
He is extremely mad at me.
That's ok. That's alright... But...

570
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,176
Not that... It's all right.
- Is he rejecting your treatment?

571
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,240
He is rejecting me...

572
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,753
His intention was to
offend me. So that I move away.

573
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,427
But...

574
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,620
I didn't say anything to him

575
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,184
You did the right thing

576
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:50,633
He's testing you. He wants
you to stop. Don't give up

577
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,304
There's something he
said that is making me think

578
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,177
He said,

579
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,441
..."You're trying to treat me?

580
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:05,908
Don't you know that there is no
such thing as silence in this world?"

581
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,234
Are you looking for someone, madam?

582
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,703
Did you see my husband?

583
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,471
He must be around here somewhere

584
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,536
No, he isn't...

585
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,327
He's a little different.
I think you know

586
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:00,869
Just a moment

587
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,908
Suman!

588
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:09,753
Have seen her husband?

589
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,905
He went downhill a while ago

590
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:13,649
Downhill?

591
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,488
I'll look for him...

592
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,351
Why would he go downhill?

593
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:38,770
Come with me.

594
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,028
Good! That's correct

595
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,529
Hey, I need a break

596
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,301
Sure.

597
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,154
My bladder's about to burst

598
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,846
Oh...

599
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,422
How are you?

600
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,350
I'm fine

601
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,830
I just had to ask you something

602
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,962
Hey!

603
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:09,926
What trouble!

604
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,664
This bloody woman!

605
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,064
What's wrong?

606
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,490
She's driving me nuts!

607
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,927
We are done with the last chains?

608
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,908
Hey? What is it?

609
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,104
We'll do the chains
and then the handcuff.

610
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,173
She'll drive me crazy

611
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,644
Who is it?

612
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,456
It's like she's stuck to my ass!

613
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,625
She doesn't even let me
concentrate on my work

614
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:36,660
Who are you talking about?

615
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,039
Come on, let's go for a take

616
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:53,900
Damn it.

617
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,632
Let's do this part again

618
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:57,738
Once again

619
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,659
Ok, we'll take it from the top

620
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:10,951
Ok. Lets go. Action!

621
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,118
Yes, lets go

622
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,812
Hey! Are you listening to me?

623
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,064
Tarak

624
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,035
Sorry.

625
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,548
Do you consider me to be your enemy?

626
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,167
Don't do that! Don't
take off your headphones

627
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,450
Now listen to me

628
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,556
It really doesn't matter to
me whether you listen or not.

629
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,902
But it might help you

630
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,696
It really isn't my job
to be running after you

631
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:47,831
Especially after today.

632
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,733
After the way you behaved with me...

633
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:54,738
...I really feel I should not
be disturbing you any further

634
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,506
I'll inform your wife as well

635
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,571
I was in a bad mood.

636
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,778
Sorry. Now let me work

637
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,364
You know why you're
losing your temper so easily?

638
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,551
Nobody knows it better than you

639
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:11,321
You bloody well know
that you have a problem.

640
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,290
A complicated problem

641
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,792
But you will neither admit
it nor will you get it treated

642
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,827
Treatment of the mind is
treatment of madness for you.

643
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,030
This proves that you're uneducated

644
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,731
That's quite enough. Now go.

645
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,383
Just keep your mouth shut!

646
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,222
Okay just keep your mouth shut.

647
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,472
You have said all you had to over
the phone. Now just listen to me.

648
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,969
Not a word more

649
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,376
I just said I'm sorry!
Why are you dragging this?!

650
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:37,189
I only wanted to
understand his problem...

651
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,732
...treat him and cure him

652
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,886
But I've lost all
patience now. Too bad

653
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,522
Hey! I don't have any problem.
I can hear you quite clearly.

654
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:46,848
Headphones!

655
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,627
You can hear me because
you're wearing those headphones.

656
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,847
External sounds are not disturbing you

657
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,931
That is why I asked
you not to remove them.

658
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,700
I only wanted my
last piece of advice...

659
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,650
...to get into that
thick skull of yours

660
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:02,832
Listen to me Tarak.

661
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:07,323
I have never said this to you before

662
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,914
You are losing the general
mental ability to hear...

663
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:15,018
...and comprehend human speech

664
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,672
You are losing it a
little by little everyday

665
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,685
Please realize that

666
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,944
You are such a talented artist!

667
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,930
If this problem keeps increasing...

668
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,432
...you'll never be able to
create such sounds again.

669
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,345
Have you ever thought about it?

670
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:36,473
You have to realize
that you are unwell.

671
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,970
This is a disease

672
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,710
Dibyendu, Ratna, nobody can treat you

673
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,159
You are running away from the
treatment because you're stupid!

674
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,839
Do you really want to
ruin yourself like this?

675
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,553
It's your choice

676
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:01,155
Thanks a lot

677
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,153
Try and make him understand.

678
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,273
What happened, Tarak?

679
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,535
You'll never be able to
pay for that microphone;...

680
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,357
...even you work on 500 films

681
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:46,291
Rest for a few days...
I've heard all about you

682
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,610
Hello Harish?

683
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,097
Do you have a TLM 103 microphone?

684
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,841
Well, what can I say...? Luck

685
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,549
Fine... I'll call you back soon

686
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,453
Come back once you're cured

687
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,351
I'm... quite... fine...

688
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,403
You may go

689
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:08,892
It's never happened before.

690
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,218
It suddenly broke.

691
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,540
Accident. You can't blame me for it

692
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,393
This is too much.

693
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,093
Why did you take these out?

694
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,932
Teach me. Rest at home for a few days

695
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:39,913
Teach me.

696
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,350
I can do it.

697
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,246
Life insurance matters
aren't all that difficult

698
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,081
If I can manage my work at
the boutique, I can do this too

699
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,053
It's all about selling a proposition

700
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:04,894
They rested you so that they don't
have to bear your treatment costs

701
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,318
It has happened because of your work

702
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,140
They don't have any responsibility?

703
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:17,570
Son, you have a guest

704
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,322
I'll go check

705
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,179
Why bother after having fired him?

706
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,334
It's not me. It's the management.

707
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,903
I'm an employee there. Just like him.

708
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,400
Just a recordist.

709
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,802
Is he home?

710
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,536
Listen...

711
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,344
His doctor's told me
he'll never recover...

712
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,913
...if he doesn't stop all this work

713
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:12,148
Please don't instigate him

714
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:16,219
Of course not... I've
just come to meet him.

715
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:19,737
He must be feeling low.
So I just came over.

716
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:23,366
Good that you're here.
I've made a mistake

717
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,449
How are you?

718
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:31,094
Come here... Listen carefully.

719
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:34,179
I'll put the empty cup and the
filled cup here. Listen very carefully

720
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,521
Doesn't it sound different?

721
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,627
Isn't it? It sounds different, right?

722
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,227
Shit. I' have made a mistake.

723
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:53,127
Come... sit down. Please come

724
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,987
You remember that scene where...

725
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,256
...the cup was being
placed on the stone table?

726
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,526
I did it with an empty cup.
It's completely wrong

727
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,262
It'll be full at first and then
slowly the level should go down

728
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,177
The sound should be different!
Now what?

729
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,334
It doesn't matter.
No one can make out.

730
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,520
But Tarak can't go wrong, right?

731
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,825
Look, once we've found a mistake,
it has to be corrected

732
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,866
They won't let me work
for 10 minutes? 10 minutes

733
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,729
It's unnecessary. Forget about it

734
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,869
No, a mistake is a mistake

735
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,252
They won't give me 10 minutes?

736
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,181
I'll get it done

737
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,523
You won't remember
and it'll never be done

738
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,054
I will

739
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,307
Don't go to the studio now

740
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,122
Take a break

741
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,114
What happens to the rest of the film?

742
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,161
2 reels still to go

743
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,534
Bhabani Laha
- Who?

744
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:54,456
Bhabani babu... hopefully he'll do it

745
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,611
Bhabani? Oh no...

746
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,898
The old man is too lazy

747
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:03,801
He can't hear properly
and he doesn't have work

748
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:06,618
Gaya isn't free?

749
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,047
He's too busy

750
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:14,148
Bhabani? The film is done for

751
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,274
You believe it too?

752
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,929
We need a second opinion

753
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,875
I have no faith in that woman

754
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,194
She's accepted that
it's beyond her knowledge

755
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,622
She doesn't know.

756
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,816
She's trying to know. Bullshit.

757
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,397
Am I a guinea pig?

758
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:40,566
But... a second opinion is necessary

759
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,773
You find a doctor, I'll go

760
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,669
If treatment is required,
I'll get it done

761
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:54,085
Go look for a doctor

762
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,708
You want me to take over
after having come this far?

763
01:09:10,908 --> 01:09:12,293
You want me to take over
after having come this far?

764
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,308
Think about it

765
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,819
He's rejecting me

766
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,427
And even more so because...

767
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:30,948
...l've had the difficult task of
letting him know that he's unwell

768
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,464
Yes. It has worked.

769
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,484
He's told the recordist
that he wants a second opinion

770
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,893
Which is why you're here

771
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:44,458
This is the first positive
step taken by your patient

772
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,216
You want to put it to use, right?

773
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,508
Yes.

774
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:53,774
And if you take it
up I can rest assured

775
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,612
Because I am the best.

776
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:04,887
Nobody knows that better than you

777
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,638
Send all of Tarak's case
files to my chamber tomorrow. Ok?

778
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,169
Fine

779
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,472
But it's better...

780
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:20,795
...if Tarak does not
come to know of our link

781
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,181
Ok

782
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:27,534
So when should I send him?

783
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,773
The day after tomorrow

784
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,035
Give it to me

785
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:36,972
What?

786
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,508
The ball

787
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:46,648
Give it to me.

788
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,556
You are sick

789
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:10,289
From now onwards... no more sound.

790
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,013
You need rest.

791
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,765
Do you work by staying up all night?

792
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,767
Hold still, don't move.

793
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,177
You have to stop worrying.

794
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,797
Now try and sleep

795
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,720
It has happened out of anxiety

796
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,741
Just to be on the safe side,
get an ECG done

797
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:16,122
Now try and sleep well for a few days

798
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,477
You...

799
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:22,763
...go for work at night.

800
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:25,734
You need to stop working
at night for few days.

801
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,655
His blood pressure?

802
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,910
It's alright. Was he over-worked?

803
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:37,109
That he was... I mean...

804
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,848
There's a lot of tension at work

805
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,421
He doesn't sleep well at night

806
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,966
I'll be off

807
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,727
I'll take care of it.

808
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,574
Your fees...

809
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,805
Give me a call at night. - Sure.

810
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:48,563
Father...

811
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:51,466
Father...

812
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,216
What are you doing here?
Won't you sleep?

813
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:38,520
I'm having a coughing fit.
It'll bother you

814
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,403
Don't behave like a mad man.
Go inside. Get some sleep. Go.

815
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,245
Hello.

816
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:22,839
Yes. Yes, Dibyendu

817
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:27,548
When?

818
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,682
Huh?

819
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,353
Oh.

820
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,689
Ok.

821
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,366
I see. Ok. Ok. Fine

822
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:09,662
Sir, it's Tarak.

823
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,166
He's missing

824
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:24,991
Every sound had
started to irritate him

825
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:32,433
Last night I suddenly had a fit.
Just couldn't stop coughing

826
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:40,679
I knew he'd get irritated by it.
So I went and sat outside

827
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:44,076
He's the one who
forced me to go back inside

828
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,988
I haven't seen him since

829
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:52,307
He came to the bedroom
after that, I could hear noises

830
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:57,012
Then he went out. And then...

831
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,372
Listen son...

832
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:04,019
Please request the police
to look for him carefully

833
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,287
His photograph is with
the police. Don't worry

834
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:08,974
I think we'll hear
from them by evening.

835
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:11,548
He's no big shot.

836
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:14,814
The police have nothing
to gain by looking for him

837
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,566
There are so many people
going missing every day.

838
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,684
Do the police find all of them?

839
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:27,461
Tell me something... Do you
have any political contacts?

840
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:33,663
Then there is nothing to be done

841
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:50,917
Is there some relative who maybe...

842
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:54,388
I've called up every
one he could be with.

843
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:56,397
He's just not there

844
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:59,760
He hasn't even taken any money either

845
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:04,397
He won't do anything stupid, right?
- No!

846
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,474
I don't think so.

847
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,592
You know why I am the best?

848
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:33,854
Because I work with my mind.

849
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,534
Not my heart

850
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:40,432
Today your patient is just missing

851
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:45,604
But your next patient might do
something much more drastic.

852
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:47,716
Oh, ya...

853
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,950
Belated happy birthday

854
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,566
Ohh...

855
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,300
Thank you Sir

856
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:11,463
Did you celebrate yesterday?

857
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,042
Yes.

858
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:19,105
Just like every time
My friends came over.

859
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:22,543
They bring their own food

860
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:25,212
Nothing special really

861
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:28,974
I realized something yesterday

862
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,029
Something I felt

863
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:41,155
Tarak is not hearing anybody.

864
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,695
Nothing is registering

865
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,715
But is anyone talking sensibly?

866
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:53,133
Is there anything that
is actually worth hearing?

867
01:29:57,525 --> 01:29:59,272
Nothing they say makes sense

868
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,434
At one point yesterday,
everyone in my house was talking...

869
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:07,658
...at the same time.

870
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:09,516
Nobody was listening to anybody else

871
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:16,024
Fashion, gossip, the free market,
cars, real estate, property

872
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,993
I suddenly thought is
this all there is to life?

873
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,610
Is that all?

874
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:25,774
There is nothing else?
Just a performance? A show?

875
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,947
A big show.

876
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,228
It is a tale told by the idiot...

877
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,983
...full of sound and
fury signifying nothing.

878
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,695
Nothing at all.

879
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,805
Then what is Tarak really missing?

880
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:46,025
He's doing himself a
favour by not listening!

881
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:50,160
He doesn't need to listen to all that

882
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:57,103
The one who is listening to a
man who speaks rubbish is normal...

883
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:58,820
And the one who listens
to the sounds of nature...

884
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,389
...of general ambience is abnormal...

885
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:03,644
...who are we to decide that?

886
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,104
Does everyone have to conform?

887
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:08,641
Must everyone be the same?

888
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:11,933
I mean, who the bloody
hell are we to decide...

889
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,256
...what is normal and what is not?

890
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:18,698
I'm sorry, Sir

891
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,666
Carry on

892
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,254
Actually you're right

893
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,234
I am emotionally involved

894
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,794
I could not learn objectivity

895
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:33,871
I'll never be a good doctor

896
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,875
You'll always be the best

897
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:33,137
Father...

898
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:57,921
Yes, this is fine. Ask him to come
meet me at the chamber tomorrow.

899
01:34:58,121 --> 01:34:59,827
Yes, this is fine. Ask him to come
meet me at the chamber tomorrow.

900
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:01,016
OK.
- Thank you.

901
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:02,356
Excuse me doctor

902
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:06,567
I am Dr Swati Mukherjee... Tarak
is my patient. I am a psychiatrist

903
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,736
Oh right! Very
narrow escape I must say.

904
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:10,872
Yes, I know. Thank you very much

905
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,836
I had a small query

906
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:15,076
Sure. Please come inside

907
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:16,711
No. I just have a small query.

908
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:19,180
Please don't mind. This
is very important for me

909
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,779
Please go ahead

910
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,168
I'm sorry I have to ask this

911
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:26,954
I noticed that... you have a squint

912
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:28,917
Yes. My right eye.

913
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:30,525
This happened when I
was in 4th grade...

914
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,527
I was playing on the road when
a stone came and hit me here

915
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,662
And the muscles in
this area got severed...

916
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:36,898
...and the eye
shifted towards the right

917
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:38,463
Ok. I see.

918
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,270
Any problems in vision?

919
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:45,006
Definitely. The problems
were more profound earlier

920
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:49,076
For example, when I like
at you now I see 2 of you

921
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:50,436
Oh God.

922
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:52,775
How do you manage?

923
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:55,567
You have a much better idea of
how fascinating the human brain is

924
01:35:55,983 --> 01:36:01,989
How did that doctor's squint
help you get to this equation?

925
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:03,383
Amazing!

926
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,060
It was nothing really.

927
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,696
To a question of his...

928
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:13,613
...both Tarak's wife and
I answered simultaneously

929
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:16,237
His left eye was pointed towards...

930
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:20,187
...Tarak's wife while his
right eye was looking at me

931
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:23,110
But he did not register my presence

932
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:24,659
I'll come again tomorrow

933
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:26,814
Doctor...
- He's your husband?

934
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:27,981
No he's her...

935
01:36:28,082 --> 01:36:30,899
Just try and find out
why he would do this

936
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,970
Ok. Go home. Take rest

937
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:42,416
It might not be safe to
leave Tarak here like this

938
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:44,123
Hmm... yes.

939
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:45,788
Just a moment...

940
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:51,415
I was wondering how he
reconciled this doubled vision

941
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,553
Like now when I look at you,

942
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,690
for my left eye, you are
at the centre of the frame

943
01:36:57,111 --> 01:36:59,880
And since this eye has
shifted to the right...

944
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,883
...for my right eye you are
at the left side of the frame

945
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,986
I have to fight with these two images

946
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:07,688
This double vision was
very disturbing for me

947
01:37:07,888 --> 01:37:10,625
I had to keep my right
eye covered for a long time

948
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,627
By seeing only with my left eye...

949
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,095
...my brain started
to understand that...

950
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:16,631
My left eye vision, which
is you at the center now...

951
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,634
That's my true vision, so my right
eye vision started getting blurry

952
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:22,236
Though I still see
two images even now...

953
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:26,391
But by habit I've learnt
to focus only on my left eye

954
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:29,844
So in Tarak's case what we want is
the ambience to become the slave

955
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:33,691
And the human voice
should become the master sound

956
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:38,285
If we can cut off the
ambience then automatically...

957
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:39,816
Right...

958
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:41,222
If required we have to make him...

959
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:44,978
...compulsorily listen to human
voice for some time every day

960
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,273
As long as he's awake,

961
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,056
chitchat,

962
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:50,522
news, discussions...

963
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:52,366
human voice in any form...

964
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:55,302
That might be possible
only in rehab but...

965
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:57,972
where'll we get such
a place in this city?

966
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:01,057
Dibyendu was telling me
about this particular rehab

967
01:38:01,642 --> 01:38:05,460
Yes. It's quite an isolated place

968
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,329
The name is 'Lonesome'

969
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:09,984
But sir, this place is in Mandarmani

970
01:38:10,184 --> 01:38:11,481
Just a moment!

971
01:38:13,354 --> 01:38:15,222
Memories downloading.

972
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:16,980
Mandarmani,

973
01:38:17,224 --> 01:38:18,191
rehab,

974
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:19,587
'Lonesome'

975
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:26,618
Advocate Shubhankar Chatterjee
had a guest house in Mandarmani

976
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,562
His only son was

977
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:31,759
A drug addict. He
was very upset about it

978
01:38:32,673 --> 01:38:36,491
So he converted the guest
house into a rehab to treat his son

979
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:39,066
I've lost touch with him

980
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:42,310
Encyclopedia!

981
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:45,673
Then all our problems are over.

982
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,354
I'll get hold of Shubhankar's number...

983
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:49,457
...and inform him that
I'm sending Tarak over

984
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:53,194
Dibyendu can help us in
this regard She's right.

985
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:56,497
Yes. I mean, you'll
get all equipment backup.

986
01:38:56,697 --> 01:39:00,618
In fact I'd love to
set up Tarak's room.

987
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:02,892
Thank you Dibyendu

988
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:04,898
Ok, so I'll be off

989
01:39:05,306 --> 01:39:07,308
If you could just let
me know in advance...

990
01:39:07,508 --> 01:39:12,225
...as to when we are
setting the place up...

991
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:14,165
I'll take your leave.

992
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:16,014
Thanks a lot.

993
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:20,499
And please note down this number

994
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,076
Is this your new number?

995
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:27,420
No.

996
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:29,463
Advocate Shubhankar Chatterjee

997
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:30,925
Oh

998
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,191
My father

999
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:37,250
'Lonesome' changes lives

1000
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,228
And I think I'm the best
person to advocate that

1001
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,538
I'll be off

1002
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:55,986
It's a small world

1003
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:03,094
This...

1004
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:06,286
Obsession, addiction...

1005
01:40:07,034 --> 01:40:11,272
these are things he
understands very well.

1006
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:13,474
And maybe that is why
he is standing by Tarak

1007
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,073
Isn't it? - Maybe.

1008
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:26,204
Thank you for the book

1009
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:32,136
You... still won't go meet him?

1010
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:36,526
Master... Slave...

1011
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:47,101
Let Tarak recover.

1012
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,192
Then maybe he'll
recognize me like human voice

1013
01:40:55,082 --> 01:40:56,379
Swati...

1014
01:40:57,418 --> 01:41:00,474
I am feeling very very proud

1015
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:06,337
Today I feel I really am the best...

1016
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:08,354
Professor... that is

1017
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:13,031
Thank you

1018
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:45,497
"The girl is crazy"

1019
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:49,403
