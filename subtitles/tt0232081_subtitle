1
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,773
Thief! Thief!

2
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:54,241
Thief! Thief!

3
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,414
Don't beat him! 
- Don't beat him.

4
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,136
You stole, didn't you? 
Search him.

5
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:15,433
Where's the wallet?

6
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,817
Do you want to say
anything in your defence?

7
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,523
The only thing I can say in
my defence, Your Honour..

8
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:31,251
..is that I couldn't steal
undetected this time..

9
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,611
..and was nabbed.

10
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,075
But I'm not to be 
blamed, your Honour!

11
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,503
It's thanks to you people.

12
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:44,653
Ever since I remember, 
I've been an orphan.

13
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:50,185
And society abused me
by calling me a bastard.

14
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:55,691
I faced so many abuses that
I became a bastard in reality.

15
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,052
But who doesn't want to
lead a decent respectable life?

16
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:06,168
Your Honour, if I were
to approach you for a job..

17
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,251
..would you give me one?

18
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,998
No, Your Honour. 
Like everybody else..

19
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:16,658
..you too would have been wary of me,
considering me to be a wayward man..

20
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:20,985
..who might steal 
from your house.

21
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:27,513
That's my story, Your Honour.

22
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,959
Now, you may send me behind
bars for as long as you wish.

23
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:33,038
Your crime has been proved.

24
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:36,878
The court therefore sentences
you to six months imprisonment.

25
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:47,185
Bloody cripple.. 
Are you content now?

26
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,126
But I don't understand
what enmity you had with me.

27
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:54,259
None. - Then why did 
you have me caught?

28
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,949
It was my duty. - Duty?

29
00:02:57,134 --> 00:03:02,849
It's the duty of every citizen
to help the police and the law.

30
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:52,438
You've started a fight
as soon as you've come.

31
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:54,277
It's not my fault, sir.

32
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:57,117
I remained quiet when
Kaliya started bossing over me.

33
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:59,558
Today he abused my parents.
I smashed his teeth.

34
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,575
If he ever tries it again, I won't
spare him! - This is a prison.

35
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:04,477
You'll have to 
follow the rules here.

36
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:06,437
Lodge a complaint if anybody
says or acts against you.

37
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:07,504
To whom should I complain?

38
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:09,352
He's scared of Kaliya too.
He backed out terrified.

39
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,597
Shut up.

40
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,228
Constable, take him away..

41
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:13,750
..and put him in solitary
confinement for four days.

42
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:28,889
It's a matter of 
only a few months.

43
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:33,164
Outside we get beaten up.
Why quarrel with each other?

44
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:34,877
Come on, shake hands.

45
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,510
Tell Kaliya not to abuse me. 
- I won't.

46
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:43,117
Your report indicates that you
wish to lead a respectable life.

47
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:47,235
But perhaps society
hasn't allowed you to do so.

48
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:49,822
Do you still have the 
same feelings?

49
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:54,335
Sir, I've tried a lot. But nobody 
ever gave me the opportunity.

50
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:58,883
And now after I leave
prison, who will trust me?

51
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,858
There's one man who 
still has faith in you.

52
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:04,743
And he has written a
letter to us concerning you.

53
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:07,118
A letter? For me? - Yes.

54
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,096
The letter states 'If Ajit
wishes to start life afresh..

55
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:13,353
..after being released
from jail, send him to me.'

56
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:16,682
His name and address is in this.

57
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:19,428
Sir, do you have a coin?

58
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:21,815
A coin?

59
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:25,314
Yes. It's the coin 
which decides my life.

60
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:30,374
Yes, sir. I'll go.

61
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,248
Ajit..

62
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,376
I'm glad you've decided to go.

63
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,435
Keep this coin with 
you for good luck.

64
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:42,497
Thank you, sir.

65
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:10,735
My son!

66
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:13,135
My son has arrived!

67
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:15,976
My son!

68
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:19,851
The villagers said 
you were killed. No.

69
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,896
But I always said 
that my son is alive.

70
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:26,815
Kamini! Mr. Abdul! Ganga!

71
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:30,896
Look! My son is alive! 
My son has arrived!

72
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,375
My son! My son!

73
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:36,705
Mrs. Laali, he's not 
your son. - Isn't he?

74
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:41,415
No, he's my son! - No, he 
isn't, ma'am. - Can't you see?

75
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,415
Take her away. - He's my son!
Save me, my son!

76
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,816
Come along, ma'am!

77
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:48,935
Save me, son! 
- Who's that woman?

78
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:53,201
It has been 18 years since
the bandits abducted her son.

79
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:55,261
They demanded Rs.5,000 
for his life.

80
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:59,882
Laali sold everything..
her land, ornaments and property.

81
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,665
But she couldn't 
raise the amount.

82
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,868
Perhaps the bandits killed her son.
In grief, she went mad.

83
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,362
Do bandits come to this 
village very often?

84
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:13,073
This is Rajasthan.
Only two things are famous here.

85
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,712
The sand.. and bandits.

86
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,272
Don't the police do anything?

87
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:18,978
The police aren't present
in every village all the time.

88
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,466
Besides, the bandits keep
moving from one place to another.

89
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:25,218
You seem to be an outsider.
Have you come from the city?

90
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,968
Yes. I want to meet
Havaldaar Major Jaswant Singh.

91
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,205
You?

92
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:37,605
You've called me? - Yes.

93
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:39,039
What for?

94
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,737
To give you a job.

95
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:44,819
Why so much sympathy 
for a criminal?

96
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:49,014
You've already been
punished for your crime.

97
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:53,456
You're a new man today.
A new life awaits you.

98
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:57,960
Awaits me? An orphan..

99
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,960
..who doesn't even know 
his father's name?

100
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:04,401
If you wish, you 
can use my name.

101
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:07,814
Why? - So that society
doesn't call you illegitimate.

102
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,481
Instead, they'll 
call you my son.

103
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,533
The son of ex-Havaldaar
Major Jaswant Singh.

104
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,180
I don't want 
anybody's obligation.

105
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:19,608
Moreover, one doesn't become
somebody's son just like that.

106
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,654
All right. At least you can 
live here as my associate.

107
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,644
What does your coin say?

108
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:39,911
The coin says 
that I live here.

109
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:21,662
Hey!

110
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:24,502
Who are you?

111
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:30,195
Who has harmed a blind man? 
- Who are you?

112
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:33,675
Ma'am, where are you?

113
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:36,276
He seems to be blind.

114
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,915
I'm totally blind. 
- The ape's pretending.

115
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,612
Ape! No, not ape.

116
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:45,291
Please escort me to Lord
Hanuman's (Hindu god) temple.

117
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,692
You want to go to the temple?
Come, I'll take you there.

118
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:52,515
Let's go. 
- Not that way. Over here.

119
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:54,612
Come on. - Come on.

120
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:59,612
Please.. slowly.

121
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:06,211
Stop! - What happened?

122
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:10,812
I can smell it! Deep waters!

123
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:14,898
Can you smell it?
Or has your sight returned?

124
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:17,426
Eyes? Yes! My sight is 
returning gradually!

125
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,978
Who touched me first? - Why?

126
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,847
Touch me again. I might be able 
to see everything again.

127
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:25,536
You'll see everything very soon.

128
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:31,422
Stars during the day, 
and the sun at night.

129
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,459
And a face like 
yours in my dreams.

130
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,999
How wonderful! You are losing 
your temper on an outsider!

131
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:03,219
But you don't say anything
to that two feet tall guy!

132
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:06,636
Aren't you ashamed to say
such things about a child?

133
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,871
Rather, he should feel ashamed who 
has come naked in front of women.

134
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,953
I'm standing here all dressed up.
- What did you say?

135
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:18,872
I'm leaving... so when are you 
coming to bathe tomorrow?

136
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:22,895
I've had it! Listen to me.

137
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,280
You're so cruel!

138
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:30,488
I meant, I wouldn't come here
when you come here to bathe.

139
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:39,322
You?

140
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,122
Yes, it's me.

141
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:46,082
What're you doing in uncle's home?
- I live here too.

142
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:49,666
I see. But you won't 
stay here for long anyway.

143
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:56,662
Look, don't tell uncle anything 
about how you treated me by the lake.

144
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,983
Why shouldn't I? A bad man like 
you shouldn't live with uncle.

145
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,343
Why involve that old man.. 
- What?

146
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:04,702
I mean, why drag your 
uncle into this?

147
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:08,062
It was blatant 
impertinence on your part..

148
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:11,022
Don't call it impertinence.
I'm a decent man.

149
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:12,543
I did make a mistake.

150
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:15,983
I swear I didn't know the 
village girls go there to bathe.

151
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:20,415
What have you brought for me, my child?
- You're cooking again, Uncle!

152
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,663
I was only making halwa 
(Indian pudding). Sit down, son.

153
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:27,550
This is Ajit. He has arrived
from the city only yesterday.

154
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,270
He'll work with me in the fields.
- Yes, of course.

155
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,389
The entire village 
knows about it.

156
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:38,028
She's Anju, daughter of my friend 
the village chief Ramdeen.

157
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:41,806
She brings food daily.
If I refuse, she quarrels with me.

158
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:46,166
The food in our village is very spicy. 
Perhaps he won't like it.

159
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,166
I'm very fond of spicy things.

160
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:52,026
Why don't you taste
the curry of our village?

161
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:57,777
The curry is very salty.
- Don't you like salt?

162
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:01,822
That's not true.
I like salty things very much.

163
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,659
These are my fields.

164
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:10,747
Our field, as far as your eyes 
can see, all the lands belong to us.

165
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,605
The place is so open 
and spread out.

166
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:16,026
Indeed amazing.

167
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:19,633
And look at how the 
crops are swaying..

168
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,976
..and the tree-branches are
just dancing with the wind.

169
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:26,028
They look like dark 
clouds dancing.

170
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:29,516
You compose poetry too? 
- I even sing..

171
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,255
..when the mood strikes.

172
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:36,014
"The dark clouds 
were enticing me."

173
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:40,435
"At such a moment 
when you find someone.."

174
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:45,358
But my boy, just 
singing won't do.

175
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:50,835
To acquire this priceless 
wealth, you'll have to toil hard.

176
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:55,396
To acquire this 
priceless wealth..

177
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:58,653
..I'll put all my 
heart into the effort.

178
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:08,805
What's happened to him?

179
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,840
Sir.. he's producing 
the sound of a 'guggi'.

180
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,493
Why?

181
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:18,851
After hearing this sound, the
beloved's heart beats faster..

182
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,036
..and she comes 
rushing to her lover.

183
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:26,075
Indeed, sir. Six years ago,
when he produced such a sound..

184
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:29,315
..his beloved's heart 
had beaten faster..

185
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,675
..and she had come rushing.
She even got married.

186
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,315
But to somebody else!

187
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:35,996
Then what's the use of
producing such a sound?

188
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:38,955
Every sound is different.

189
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:43,036
The sound of a youngster like 
you would be very different.

190
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:46,476
If you produce such a sound..

191
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:49,996
..your beloved 
will come rushing.

192
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:54,075
You barber, I have only one love.
Can I have some?

193
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:58,516
Yes, of course. At Chhotumal's.

194
00:16:58,595 --> 00:16:59,835
We'll join you too.

195
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:01,835
We'll join you.

196
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:06,475
You're a thief, Chhotumal.
- You've cheated me!

197
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:09,675
No, you've..

198
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:13,236
Hold on. Why are you fighting?
- We're both partners.

199
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,653
Despite being partners, you're 
fighting with each other?

200
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:19,489
There's a clause 
in our partnership.

201
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,235
Whoever wants to have liquor 
will put money in here..

202
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:24,476
..pick up a bottle 
from there and drink it.

203
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:26,276
I did just that.

204
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:29,359
I took out my 
share of the money..

205
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,822
..put it in the box, picked up
a bottle and gulped it down.

206
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,556
I too did the same.

207
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,715
I removed some 
money, put it there..

208
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,756
..and took the bottle
and gulped it all down.

209
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,476
You have gulped all 
the liquor down.

210
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:44,236
And you also gulped it down.
Since when has this been going on?

211
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:46,076
Since noon.

212
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:48,755
How many bottles down? - Six.

213
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:51,076
And the money in 
the kitty? - Rs.2.

214
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:55,316
Mr. Motumal, this means that the
money in the kitty is just the same..

215
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,596
..and all the liquor is
inside your stomach.

216
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,787
If you continue like this,
your business will be ruined.

217
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:04,915
He's right.

218
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:06,863
Look, there's a customer.
Give the gentleman a bottle.

219
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:09,599
He needs a bottle? Sir, tell me, 
what would you like to have?

220
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,772
What would you 
like to drink, sir?

221
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,595
Do you have Asha (hope)? 
- Wonderful!

222
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,223
Great!

223
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:31,043
Sir, where have you come from?

224
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,835
I've come from the city.

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,425
Why leave the city 
for a village?

226
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:42,620
That old soldier.. - Yes?
- He has made me his son.

227
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:47,406
He says that he'll
give me all his property.

228
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:51,945
Really? He's a nice man.
- When will the old man die?

229
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:55,209
If he doesn't die, 
then we'll kill him.

230
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,195
Really!

231
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,636
Move it!

232
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:03,996
Move it!

233
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,390
Move!

234
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:26,694
Move!

235
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,723
Move it!

236
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,254
Move!

237
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,935
That girl over there.. - Who?
You mean sister Anju?

238
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:41,494
If you tell her something,
I'll give you 10 paise.

239
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,212
What's the thing?
- Tell her that she's very pretty!

240
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,956
Sister Anju! - Not here!

241
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:49,034
Go there and tell her.
- Give me the 10 paise.

242
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:50,855
First go and tell her.

243
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,343
Move.

244
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:04,533
I told her. - You told her. That's 
all very well, but what did she say?

245
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:07,884
She said, "Get lost!"

246
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,523
All right, then. Get lost!

247
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:15,204
Give me my 10 paise. - What for, 
your sister said to get lost.

248
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:20,818
Sister Anju, my 10 paise..
- Hold on, I'll give it to you.

249
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,243
Here, get lost!

250
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,890
Hey, Ajit.. have you 
started milking the cow?

251
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,819
Yes, I'm just starting.

252
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:39,961
Why don't you start? 
- How does one do it?

253
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,252
Incredible! Haven't you learned 
to milk a cow in the city?

254
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:46,393
In the cities, you don't
get milk from the cow.

255
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,277
In the cities, milk 
comes in bottles.

256
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,252
Give her some fodder.
- Yes, I'm doing just that.

257
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:55,626
Gauri eats a lot of fodder.

258
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:57,935
How much?

259
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:00,966
As much as you offer her, 
she digests everything.

260
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:06,007
She must be giving a 
lot of milk. - Yes.

261
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:10,777
How many times a day?
- Twice. Morning and evening.

262
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:16,669
Son!

263
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,188
You remembered me after 
many days, sister.

264
00:21:25,354 --> 00:21:28,709
I've come here not for 
you but for my son.

265
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,159
Your son?

266
00:21:35,154 --> 00:21:37,525
He's my son!

267
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,358
What did you say? Your son?

268
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:43,358
The whole world knows that
you don't have any offspring.

269
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:47,399
Your wife was barren.
She was barren right to her death.

270
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:49,039
Your son, did you say?

271
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:53,719
You want to have a son
to perform your last rites.

272
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,999
That's why you're calling 
my son your own. No!

273
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,435
I won't let such 
a thing happen.

274
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,940
Bandits had taken 
away my son once.

275
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,820
I won't give my son to
anybody a second time.

276
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,668
No! No!

277
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:17,001
You lost your arm in the war. 
Can't you see with your eyes now either?

278
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:22,046
Look, his face is 
so much like mine.

279
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:27,511
Yes.. absolutely! 
I was only joking.

280
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:30,466
He's so very much like you.

281
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:35,535
His forehead, his 
eyes, his lips..

282
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,095
..they're all just like yours.

283
00:22:38,964 --> 00:22:43,179
Even a blind man could
see that he's your son.

284
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,227
Your son.

285
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,695
Is everybody in this village mad?
- What happened, sir?

286
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:57,495
The soldier says 
that I'm his son.

287
00:22:58,415 --> 00:23:03,615
That mad woman says 
that I'm her son.

288
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:12,598
Sir, you came only recently..

289
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:15,055
..and found both a 
father and a mother.

290
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:19,415
But this unfortunate man has
nobody he can call his own.

291
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:21,002
Shut up.

292
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:26,974
Sir, in this village, you got
both a father and a mother.

293
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,295
So what's wrong with it?

294
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:34,055
What difference does it make
if one has a mother and father?

295
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:35,655
What can I do?

296
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,499
What is it?

297
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,921
I'm feeling hungry.

298
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:45,339
Then come inside and eat. - No.

299
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:46,781
Why?

300
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:50,259
I've had liquor. - Liquor?

301
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,779
Yes.

302
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:55,178
Aren't you ashamed?

303
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,425
Women feel ashamed, not men.

304
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,618
You wastrel!

305
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:06,088
I've drunk liquor. Not blood!

306
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,234
I didn't expect 
this of you, Ajit.

307
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:09,713
Don't pretend to be 
surprised, old man!

308
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:10,926
Ajit!

309
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:13,761
Did I bring you here for this?

310
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,925
Did I keep you here as my
son in my own home for this?

311
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:22,001
You haven't obliged me. You called 
me here for your own gains.

312
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:26,361
You cripple! You can't 
do a thing on your own.

313
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,880
If you give me something,
you also make me slog.

314
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:33,699
Is this how you're glorifying
your family's name?

315
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,721
I'm glorifying my own name.
I don't have a family.

316
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,400
Have you forgotten? 
I'm an orphan.

317
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,560
You wretched fellow!

318
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,120
Go to the city, and 
remain in the filth..

319
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:49,992
..from where I tried 
to pull you out.

320
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,821
Yes, I'll surely go.

321
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,681
Why are you looking 
at the coin?

322
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:03,139
You're a fake, and so is 
your coin! Get lost from here!

323
00:25:07,515 --> 00:25:08,755
Aunty!

324
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:12,675
Aunty! I'm leaving the village.

325
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,396
Aunty!

326
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:23,876
Are you asleep?

327
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:28,675
Are you asleep, Aunty?

328
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:33,915
You're unfortunate like me.

329
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:40,195
You're looking for a
son you'll never find..

330
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:47,156
..and I'm looking for
a mother I'll never find.

331
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:52,195
But you're better 
off compared to me.

332
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:56,116
You've at least seen your son.

333
00:25:56,796 --> 00:25:59,796
You must have held 
him in your arms.

334
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:03,828
I haven't even heard 
my mother's voice.

335
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:07,283
I've only heard 
people abuse me.

336
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:10,627
Everybody has 
rejected me, Aunty.

337
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:15,515
That soldier..

338
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:19,077
..had made me his son.

339
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:21,918
He said that he was my father.

340
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:26,239
He beat me very badly today.

341
00:26:27,515 --> 00:26:30,195
Nobody has embraced me.

342
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:34,876
I have nobody. If only my 
mother were with me!

343
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:40,085
I'd have slept peacefully with
my head in my mother's lap.

344
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:44,316
It's you, son? 
You haven't slept yet?

345
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:49,196
I couldn't go to sleep.
- Do you want to sleep?

346
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:55,195
Yes, I do. 
- Come and sleep in my lap.

347
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:57,395
Come, my son.

348
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:59,396
Come.

349
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:06,065
Let's go home, son.

350
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:10,720
Don't wake him up.

351
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:15,031
He has found his mother's
lap after many days.

352
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:18,187
Let him sleep.

353
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:35,582
Hey! With whose permission
have you entered these fields?

354
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:39,146
I don't need anybody's
permission to enter these fields.

355
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,591
Why don't you look 
at me in the eye?

356
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:51,549
I feel ashamed.

357
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:56,093
Then why do you do such things?
- I won't do it again.

358
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:02,032
He has arrived! - Who?

359
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:04,271
The ice-candy man. - So?

360
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,400
Do you want to tell 
something? - To whom?

361
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:09,720
Anju doesn't listen 
to what you say.

362
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,228
Whenever you approach her, 
she just drives you away.

363
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:15,869
Now I know why she does that.

364
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:18,617
You go to her in the nude, so
she must be feeling embarrassed.

365
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,444
You must wear something
before you approach her.

366
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:23,579
Go and fetch that cloth.

367
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:27,589
Today I'll make a 
Dev Anand out of you.

368
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:30,249
Lift your leg.

369
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:37,546
Hurry up, or the
ice-candy man will go away.

370
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:43,156
Go and tell Anju that her
eyes are like a deer's...

371
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,404
...and her gait is 
very intoxicating...

372
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:47,415
...and her lips are 
much too delicious.

373
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:50,703
Like ice-cream? 
- Yes. Go and tell her.

374
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:55,069
No, that's a long message. - So?

375
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,270
You'll have to pay 
20 paise. - Gosh!

376
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:03,161
The soldier doesn't give me a penny 
and you're hiking your rates.

377
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,121
What are you doing here?
- I've come to meet you.

378
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:12,180
What? - I've come to see you.

379
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,925
To see me? - I have to 
learn lessons from you.

380
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:18,496
What lessons? 
- The art of milking.

381
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:21,490
City man, this is a village.

382
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:25,235
If somebody were to see
you, you'd be in the soup.

383
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:26,433
Who is afraid?

384
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:30,058
Who is it, dear? - Dad, I'm..

385
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:33,129
I've had it!

386
00:29:36,214 --> 00:29:38,899
Who is it? - Daddy, it's..

387
00:29:39,415 --> 00:29:40,764
I'll be in a fix.

388
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,454
Who is it, Anju, dear? 
- It's a donkey.

389
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:48,674
Drive it away with a stick.
- I'm doing just that.

390
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,128
If need be, I'll 
even use the stick.

391
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:56,247
Go ahead, Miss Anju.
A stick is better than a bullet.

392
00:29:56,907 --> 00:30:00,918
But when you do that, I
won't sound like a donkey.

393
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:16,550
What kind of a sound is this?

394
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:23,837
This is a unique sound.
- What does this sound do?

395
00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:29,285
A lot. - But what? Tell me!

396
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:33,100
How can I tell at this point of time?
I've just cast the net.

397
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:36,387
Then? - The bird will be
caught and put inside a cage.

398
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:37,674
And then?

399
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:44,181
Then the bird will be
cared for, fed and loved.

400
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:46,593
Really? And what then?

401
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:48,776
Then that bird too 
will make such sounds.

402
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:52,104
Teach me too.

403
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,068
Do you want to want 
to learn? - Yes.

404
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:54,602
Come close.

405
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:56,635
Come close.

406
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:59,013
Closer...a little closer. 
That's nice.

407
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,776
Now put your hands like this.

408
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,544
Now make the sound. - Louder!

409
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:10,441
I can't.  
- Let me make the sound.

410
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:16,430
Why don't you make the sound?

411
00:31:20,408 --> 00:31:22,246
What's happening, Anju?

412
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:27,285
Aunty...there's a bird
stuck inside his throat.

413
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:29,004
Really?

414
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,118
Champa, what are you waiting for?
Hit him and let it come out.

415
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:42,659
The poor fellow is 
suffering so much.

416
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:45,245
It's trapped inside.

417
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,310
It's not a small bird that's stuck.
It must be a huge bird.

418
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,925
I'll sit comfortably and
see when it comes out.

419
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,979
Now that you're alone..

420
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,386
Where did they come from?

421
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:24,964
Hello. May I help you?

422
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,937
Please come. Do come.

423
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,414
Hey! I'm trapped!

424
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:41,054
Lord!

425
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:48,719
Here, sir!

426
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,838
What have you brought? 
- Wheat flour.

427
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:54,782
No, ma'am, this mendicant
doesn't need food.

428
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:59,322
Should I get water for you?
- No, I don't desire that too.

429
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:02,469
Then what do you want?

430
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,102
I want to see the Goddess.

431
00:33:06,803 --> 00:33:09,896
I see. Shall I show you 
the path to the temple?

432
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:16,502
No, ma'am. This mendicant's temple
is in the huge eyes of this Goddess.

433
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:21,898
You? - Lovers always 
change appearances.

434
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:25,454
Look, mendicant...this is 
not a city, it's a village.

435
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:30,524
If anybody sees you, a lot
of your things will change.

436
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:34,113
Don't make me angry!
Or it'll be disastrous.

437
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:38,167
But why have you come here? 
- To meet you.

438
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:41,117
To meet me? 
But I meet you everyday.

439
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:42,534
That isn't a meeting.

440
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:47,563
Sometimes your aunt is there, 
or your friends are there!

441
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:49,648
Anju!  - I'm coming, Mom.

442
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,347
Get lost, mom is calling me.

443
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:55,173
Mothers call everyday. But people 
like me call not too often.

444
00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:59,410
What are you doing?  - Penance.

445
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:03,702
Until you promise to meet
me, I won't leave this place.

446
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:06,091
I'll hold my stand here
at my beloved's house.

447
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:07,377
Anju!

448
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:11,171
For God's sake, go away. 
I beg of you.

449
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:13,788
Do you promise to meet me?  
- Yes.

450
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:17,367
I'll wait for you at the temple.

451
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,214
Come at the earliest.  - I will.

452
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:21,237
Will you?  - Yes, I will.

453
00:34:21,317 --> 00:34:23,875
Will you?  - Yes, I will.

454
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:26,761
Ask the mendicant to wait.
I too want to meet him.

455
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,982
I've had it! - No.
Please wait a while, sir.

456
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:33,161
Let mom meet you too.
- It's not possible to wait now.

457
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:36,695
This saint blesses only
daughters, dear, not mothers.

458
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,306
I had better start moving now!

459
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,681
Sir, I've arrived!

460
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:54,707
Your mom hasn't 
come along. - No.

461
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,536
Come closer.  
- Here you are!

462
00:34:56,616 --> 00:35:00,472
Still closer.  
- What do you want?

463
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:06,114
One needn't ask for anything. 
Those who give do so on their own, dear.

464
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:10,482
All right, then. Take this.

465
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,319
What's this? - Gold.

466
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,314
Gold? That'll make me 
lose my peace of mind.

467
00:35:15,844 --> 00:35:16,990
Then take this.

468
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,235
Silver? It incites greed.

469
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:23,253
Gosh! Then take this.

470
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:26,904
Money? A mendicant has 
nothing to do with this.

471
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:31,772
Then what do you want? - The heart. 
I want your heart, dear.

472
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:34,843
Give your heart and 
see for yourself!

473
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:38,752
No, I can't give my heart.  
- Why not?

474
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:55,150
"Take the gold, take the
silver, take the money."

475
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:59,433
"But how can I give my 
heart, mendicant?"

476
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:02,708
"It'll ruin my name."

477
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:10,191
"Take the gold, take the
silver, take the money."

478
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:14,041
"But how can I give 
my heart, mendicant?"

479
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:17,468
"It'll ruin my name."

480
00:36:17,547 --> 00:36:22,988
"Take the gold, take the silver."

481
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:44,836
"If you ask for a few months.."

482
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:49,495
"..then I'll think of
what I should give you."

483
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,457
"If you ask for a few months.."

484
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:59,083
"..then I'll think of
what I should give you."

485
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,056
"The problem is that
it's my heart, not a toy."

486
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:11,310
"Take the gold, take the
silver, take the money."

487
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:15,246
"But how can I give 
my heart, mendicant?"

488
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:18,532
"It'll ruin my name."

489
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:24,164
"Take the gold, take the silver.."

490
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:46,078
"Oh, my! My heart is scared."

491
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:50,694
"I hope my denial doesn't
become my acceptance."

492
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:55,947
"Oh, my! My heart is scared."

493
00:37:56,284 --> 00:38:00,381
"I hope my denial doesn't
become my acceptance."

494
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:05,353
"Don't do any kind 
of magic on my heart."

495
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:12,575
"Take the gold, take the
silver, take the money."

496
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:16,511
"But how can I give 
my heart, mendicant?"

497
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,829
"It'll ruin my name."

498
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:25,234
"Take the gold, 
take the silver.."

499
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:47,312
'It means that 
I'll be your beloved.."

500
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:52,134
"..and we'll get married."

501
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:56,578
'It means that 
I'll be your beloved.."

502
00:38:57,344 --> 00:39:01,410
"..and we'll get married."

503
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:06,123
"I sleep on a bed of flowers
and you on a bed of thorns."

504
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:13,288
"Take the gold, take the
silver, take the money."

505
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:17,224
"But how can I give 
my heart, mendicant?"

506
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:20,510
"It'll ruin my name."

507
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:25,157
"Take the gold, take the silver.."

508
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:26,574
"Gold.."

509
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,105
"Silver.."

510
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:39,018
What's that? 
- 'Guggi', a small bird.

511
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:41,773
What's that?

512
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:45,601
It's a bird. It's often 
found in the villages.

513
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,416
But I've never heard of or
seen such a bird in 40 years.

514
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:53,275
How will you hear 
of it at your age?

515
00:39:53,355 --> 00:39:55,102
What did you say?  - I mean..

516
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:57,925
..it's found mostly in 
hill stations. Hilly regions.

517
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:01,958
The birds must come to the
desert regions to escape the chill.

518
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:05,319
But why does it come 
only in the night?

519
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,709
Perhaps because it experiences
more discomfort at night.

520
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:14,648
Jeetu, son..

521
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:32,259
This sound will let neither
of us sleep peacefully.

522
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,025
Then what should I do? 
- Drive it away.

523
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,290
Drive it away?  - Go ahead.

524
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:39,804
I'll shoot it down, it 
disturbs a lot. - Go ahead.

525
00:40:57,697 --> 00:40:59,038
What's the matter?

526
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,913
He too has heard the sound.

527
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:06,800
He has come to 
silence it for good.

528
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:11,136
Tell him that I had 
no evil intentions.

529
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,578
What can I do?
Repent what you have done now.

530
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:18,053
Whoever has made that sound should 
hear the roar of the tiger too!

531
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:24,605
Thakur, actually I'm used to
making sounds of different birds.

532
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:28,898
I don't know how I happened
to produce this particular sound.

533
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,460
The sound of the bird
accidentally came out..

534
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,427
..but why are you 
speaking like a duck now?

535
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:34,909
But why don't you 
speak like a man?

536
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:40,518
He won't listen easily.
Chain his feet and handcuff him.

537
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,665
That's it!

538
00:41:44,509 --> 00:41:46,087
Enough of fooling around.

539
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,665
He's your son, but he's
my future son-in-law.

540
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:52,628
Son-in-law?

541
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:55,956
You like my daughter 
and I approve of you.

542
00:41:56,878 --> 00:42:00,994
Thakur, you're a decent man.

543
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:03,826
Perhaps you know 
nothing about me.

544
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:08,550
I'm a wayward man, a thief.

545
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:11,285
I've just returned after serving
a six month jail sentence.

546
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:13,393
The soldier has told 
me everything.

547
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:20,377
You still want to make 
me your son-in-law?

548
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:24,756
Why not? A good man 
can become a rogue..

549
00:42:25,382 --> 00:42:28,074
..and a rogue a good man.

550
00:42:36,203 --> 00:42:38,279
Uncle!  - What is it?

551
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:40,820
Do you want to tell her anything?
- No, nothing.

552
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:43,546
I've even started 
wearing shorts now.

553
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,496
But my direct connection
has been established. - What?

554
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,909
My purpose is served.

555
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:52,498
You'll have to give me something.
- So you're twisting my arm?

556
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:56,454
I understood, dear.
The soldier has given me a rupee.

557
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:58,291
You may have it. Full and final.

558
00:42:58,371 --> 00:42:59,913
All right.  - Sir..

559
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:02,087
You're spoiling the child
by giving him money.

560
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,454
Don't worry, ma'am. 
He won't be spoilt.

561
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:08,540
If you give him money every day,
he'll get used to wasteful expenses.

562
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:11,221
If he starts spending,
he'll also start earning.

563
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:14,864
When he grows up, he'll 
load you with gold.

564
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:17,547
Really? You're so confident 
of this naughty boy?

565
00:43:17,627 --> 00:43:20,853
He's not naughty. 
He's a very useful boy.

566
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:25,297
He has been a great help. When he 
grows up, I'll help him too.

567
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:31,070
I'll get a beautiful wife for him
who will also take care of you.

568
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:34,172
What say? - Yes, she will.

569
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,212
Come here. I've been waiting
for you since such a long time.

570
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:40,433
Where were you?

571
00:43:40,942 --> 00:43:43,255
Look! What are these?

572
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:46,011
They're bangles.

573
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:50,910
Yes, I've kept them safely.
Nobody knows about them.

574
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,061
Not even the bandits.

575
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:56,478
Know who they're meant for?

576
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,038
For whom? - For your wife.

577
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,168
Take these. 
Take what belongs to you.

578
00:44:06,931 --> 00:44:11,299
Aunty, keep it with you for the 
time being. I'll take it later.

579
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:14,898
Aunty? Why do you 
call me "aunty"?

580
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:17,017
Am I not your mother?

581
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:20,412
Why do you call me "aunty"? 
Tell me.

582
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:26,887
Of course you're my mother.
It was only a slip of tongue.

583
00:44:31,232 --> 00:44:34,216
I beg of you, Thakur. 
Have mercy on us.

584
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,498
Your time is up today.

585
00:44:36,578 --> 00:44:39,482
Have mercy on me, Thakur.

586
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:42,681
I beg of you.

587
00:44:43,103 --> 00:44:46,660
The members of the family..

588
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:50,780
..which made me a 
bandit can't live.

589
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:53,926
Have mercy, Thakur.

590
00:44:57,049 --> 00:44:58,973
Fetch my gun, Anju, dear.

591
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:01,157
Separate the child.

592
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:02,768
What's the child's fault?

593
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:08,001
He was born in the family which
made an enemy of Jabbar Singh.

594
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,525
No! - Separate him.

595
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:15,134
My child! My child!

596
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:28,346
Haria! It's you?

597
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:52,536
What harm had my 
son done to you?

598
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:59,703
Sir, you said my son would
grow up and load me with gold.

599
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:04,353
Didn't you say that? 
Tell me, what now?

600
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:09,185
Who'll make a home for me? Who'll 
bring a nice daughter-in-law for me?

601
00:46:09,692 --> 00:46:11,930
Who will serve me in my old age?

602
00:46:12,882 --> 00:46:16,849
I can't understand. What enmity did 
the bandits have with this child?

603
00:46:17,237 --> 00:46:20,482
When the people of a 
village are cowards..

604
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:23,401
..their children meet 
with such a fate.

605
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,639
Remember, one day you
had asked me at the court..

606
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:29,962
..what I had gained by 
having you arrested?

607
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,449
And I had said that 
it was my duty.

608
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:36,114
If all villagers 
understand their duty..

609
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:40,266
..those bandits would drop dead, 
instead of innocent children.

610
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,605
I hear that you have
recognised one of the bandits.

611
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:51,422
Yes. - His name?

612
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:52,438
Haria.

613
00:46:53,032 --> 00:46:55,411
How do you know his name?

614
00:46:55,491 --> 00:46:58,697
He's from this village. He grew 
up in front of us, Inspector.

615
00:46:59,324 --> 00:47:01,432
Will you testify against
Haria in the court?

616
00:47:01,511 --> 00:47:04,545
Sure. - Won't you be 
scared of the bandits?

617
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:08,199
I'm also a Thakur. I've seen 
it done. I'll surely testify.

618
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,790
Go in, child.

619
00:47:38,384 --> 00:47:41,735
Are you testifying
against Haria in the court?

620
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:43,530
Yes.

621
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:49,098
Don't you know that 
Haria is my associate?

622
00:47:49,896 --> 00:47:51,085
I know it.

623
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,804
You've started 
to talk too much.

624
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,389
Where did you get so much 
courage from? - It's not courage.

625
00:47:57,648 --> 00:47:59,919
It's a duty. 
I did it as my duty.

626
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:05,074
Those who betray the
bandits of the Chambal valley..

627
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:07,041
..and help the 
police are shot dead.

628
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:10,674
You've done your duty.

629
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:14,847
Now I'll do mine. Come on!

630
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:19,419
No! Have mercy, Thakur!

631
00:48:19,498 --> 00:48:21,895
Kill me, but don't kill him.

632
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:23,906
Dear, go on inside. Go inside.

633
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:26,922
Have mercy, Thakur.

634
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:30,986
Didn't you hear what your 
husband said? Go inside.

635
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:34,148
Bansi Uncle.

636
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:37,391
Open the door, please!

637
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:39,617
I heard that dacoits 
are brave men.

638
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,698
And the brave don't kill people in
the presence of their family members.

639
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:45,306
If you must kill me, kill
me outside the village.

640
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:50,679
No, the bullet will be fired
in everybody's presence.

641
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:53,014
Open the door!

642
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:58,723
I want your family members
and the villagers to see..

643
00:48:59,253 --> 00:49:02,982
..how those who help
the police are dealt with.

644
00:49:05,101 --> 00:49:07,902
No!

645
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:10,150
Please come out! Quick!

646
00:49:22,518 --> 00:49:25,599
That's the gunfire 
of the bandits! Run!

647
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:34,659
Bring my gun and bullets. 
Hurry up!

648
00:49:46,962 --> 00:49:48,389
Dad!

649
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:51,989
Open your eyes, Dad!

650
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:17,008
What happened?

651
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:21,667
Open your eyes, Dad! 
- We're ruined.

652
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:24,338
Dad!

653
00:50:33,786 --> 00:50:34,802
Dad!

654
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,493
He was such a fool!

655
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:40,888
The bandits held a gun to
his chest and asked him..

656
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:43,936
.."Tell me, will you 
testify against us?"

657
00:50:44,315 --> 00:50:47,894
The fool spoke bravely that
he would testify against them.

658
00:50:47,974 --> 00:50:50,413
And the bandits pumped
bullets into his chest!

659
00:50:50,607 --> 00:50:54,758
Not only are you cowards, 
but rascals too!

660
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:57,763
There was only one
brave man in your village..

661
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:00,465
..who even laid down 
his life for you.

662
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:05,427
Instead of mourning his
death, you're ridiculing him?

663
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:08,995
If you don't have any kind of
shame, then go hide yourself!

664
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:13,989
Hear that! Now even the
handicapped are making fun of us.

665
00:51:15,253 --> 00:51:17,275
You ought to be ashamed 
speaking like this.

666
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:20,853
He laid down his life for
the welfare of the village.

667
00:51:21,337 --> 00:51:23,425
Had he been a coward 
like the rest of you..

668
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:26,074
..had he too loved his life
as dearly as you love yours..

669
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:28,052
..then he too would 
have hidden somewhere.

670
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:30,343
It's easy to talk 
big, Mr. Ajit.

671
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:33,349
With a bandit before you,
you'll become speechless.

672
00:51:33,554 --> 00:51:36,788
Do you know anything
else but taunting others?

673
00:51:37,956 --> 00:51:43,349
Now this village is mine too.
I swear in everyone's presence..

674
00:51:43,998 --> 00:51:48,485
..that if bandits set foot in this
village, then I'll confront them.

675
00:51:50,422 --> 00:51:54,909
Do you recognise any of them?
Look carefully.

676
00:51:57,353 --> 00:52:00,575
Don't be scared. They're human 
like you. They aren't ghosts.

677
00:52:03,094 --> 00:52:04,293
How strange!

678
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:08,043
Ramdeen was murdered right 
here in broad daylight.

679
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:10,476
Today the entire 
village is silent.

680
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:14,042
The incident happened 
opposite your house.

681
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,648
You must have seen somebody.
Was any of these among them?

682
00:52:17,406 --> 00:52:21,654
Sir, I make pots and 
fail even at that now.

683
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,314
My eyes have weakened 
considerably.

684
00:52:24,393 --> 00:52:25,891
Now, what can I tell you, sir?

685
00:52:26,281 --> 00:52:29,393
They won't tell you.
I'll tell you. - No, you won't!

686
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:34,052
Didn't you see how those
butchers killed your father?

687
00:52:34,712 --> 00:52:37,350
If you interfere, then 
they'll become your enemies.

688
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:41,090
Don't you remember how, when
Tulsiram had gone against them..

689
00:52:41,273 --> 00:52:43,868
..they had killed his family
members one after another?

690
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,705
You want to save those 
who killed dad?

691
00:52:47,786 --> 00:52:51,208
No, dear. I want to 
save what remains of us.

692
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:54,603
The police support us
only for a short while..

693
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:58,235
..but the bandits go 
against us forever.

694
00:52:58,991 --> 00:53:02,526
Excuse me. I deeply regret 
what happened yesterday.

695
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:07,500
You must have seen something.
Can you recognise any of these?

696
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,533
If we had seen them, we
would surely have told you.

697
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:22,712
Ajit, you've been called here since 
it's foolish to challenge bandits.

698
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:25,501
It's dangerous for 
the villagers. - Mr. Ajit..

699
00:53:25,697 --> 00:53:28,279
..you don't have any
relatives, nor does the soldier.

700
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:32,094
You can do anything you like.
But we have our families.

701
00:53:32,505 --> 00:53:36,440
The moment we testify against those 
bandits, our families will be killed.

702
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,634
You're right. - Why don't 
you people understand?

703
00:53:38,893 --> 00:53:42,601
If this village of over a thousand
people join hands against the bandits..

704
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:44,656
..they can do us no harm.

705
00:53:45,532 --> 00:53:48,634
If all of you unite and
testify against the bandits..

706
00:53:48,715 --> 00:53:50,787
..these bandits would 
be hanged in no time.

707
00:53:57,996 --> 00:54:01,185
I have a suggestion, Thakur.
Why not avoid that village?

708
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:03,510
We have the rest of 
the region to plunder.

709
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:04,936
No!

710
00:54:05,985 --> 00:54:08,364
This village has raised 
a voice against us.

711
00:54:08,444 --> 00:54:12,223
So what? If we don't go there,
what difference does it make to us?

712
00:54:12,494 --> 00:54:13,781
Wrong.

713
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:17,412
If we don't silence this voice..

714
00:54:18,514 --> 00:54:20,915
..people from some other village 
will raise their voices too.

715
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:24,818
We've been surviving
for the last seven years..

716
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:28,352
..because nobody supports
the police out of fear.

717
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:33,833
Once the villagers 
stop fearing us..

718
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:38,146
..we'll be hanged in no time.

719
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:44,883
Tell me when the police 
leave that village.

720
00:54:45,974 --> 00:54:49,130
I'll have to go and teach a lesson 
to that youth from the city.

721
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:54,201
Run! The bandits are coming!

722
00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:13,270
What are you doing?

723
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:17,746
You're back again? 
Tell me, where's my son?

724
00:55:17,826 --> 00:55:22,654
Tell me, where's my son?

725
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:24,556
Move away, old woman!

726
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:29,042
If I give a kick, it'll break whatever 
teeth remain in your mouth.

727
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:31,194
How brave of you!

728
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:35,172
Astride a horse, with 
a gun in your hand..

729
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,420
..you're abusing 
an elderly woman.

730
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:41,376
Are you a Thakur or a
dog from some village?

731
00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:45,668
Aren't you ashamed of abusing
an elderly woman like this?

732
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:49,775
Do you mean to say that I
should call her a 16-year-old?

733
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:27,784
Beware!

734
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:40,734
You don't open fire on an 
unarmed man. Understand?

735
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,128
Come here.

736
00:58:09,688 --> 00:58:10,877
Son..

737
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:14,271
Please come, sister. Come.

738
00:58:15,978 --> 00:58:18,951
Those butchers beat 
you so mercilessly.

739
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:24,985
Why did you confront them?

740
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,326
So what if he called 
me an old woman?

741
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,791
Am I not an old woman?

742
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:35,254
He's my blood.

743
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:38,205
That's why he couldn't bear
anybody speaking against his mother.

744
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:42,551
Bless you.

745
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,822
Now when the bandits come
again, fell them with bullets.

746
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,357
Each one of them.

747
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,887
Just like they killed your father.
They killed you.

748
00:58:53,092 --> 00:58:55,611
Oh, God! No, no.

749
00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:58,185
You're still alive.

750
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:02,942
See, soldier? 
I forget everything.

751
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,509
That's why people call me mad.

752
00:59:07,114 --> 00:59:11,428
Who says that you're mad?
Hasn't your son returned?

753
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:16,358
Don't worry. I'll teach 
him how to use a gun.

754
00:59:17,103 --> 00:59:22,811
Once he learns that, just
see what your son does.

755
00:59:25,373 --> 00:59:26,842
It's all wrong.

756
00:59:26,922 --> 00:59:29,199
You don't even know how 
to hold a gun properly.

757
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:32,095
Are you firing a gun or shooting
bows and arrows? Hold it here.

758
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:36,636
Hold it here, and take aim, 
there in front. Fire!

759
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:45,145
You fall apart like a chopped tree! 
Take proper aim.

760
00:59:45,339 --> 00:59:46,701
Take aim!

761
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,149
Where are you looking?
Your target is over there!

762
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,349
I got pushed back. 
I've gone cross-eyed.

763
00:59:57,429 --> 00:59:59,154
Control your eyes.

764
00:59:59,235 --> 01:00:01,998
If I control my eyes, my
heart starts beating faster.

765
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:04,701
Keep your heart in check.  
- I can't.

766
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:06,636
Why?  - It's difficult.

767
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:09,078
What's difficult?  - To fire.

768
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:12,160
Make an attempt. Fire!

769
01:00:17,273 --> 01:00:21,521
Halt! Come back!

770
01:00:23,976 --> 01:00:27,998
Hold this. And load it. Be quick.

771
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:32,927
I'll show you how one 
opens fire. Give it to me.

772
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:35,360
Move forward. Come forward.

773
01:00:41,911 --> 01:00:45,328
Shoot in this manner. 
See, shoot like this.

774
01:00:50,043 --> 01:00:54,402
Now I know why you
weren't shooting properly.

775
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:59,210
Fire now. And pay 
attention there. Fire!

776
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:17,621
Is your news sure, Zaalim Singh?
- Absolutely, Thakur.

777
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:21,712
He's shooting, and he's
also instigating villagers.

778
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:23,875
I've confirmed both things.

779
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:28,139
A tiger's heart in a sheep?

780
01:01:30,302 --> 01:01:33,130
I beat him up just yesterday.

781
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,656
And now he's attempting 
to confront me?

782
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:37,532
That is something to 
think about, Thakur.

783
01:01:38,275 --> 01:01:40,299
Till today, wherever you went..

784
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:43,871
..nobody ever dared to 
protest against you.

785
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,423
But now..  - Now what?

786
01:01:47,114 --> 01:01:50,279
Now I'm concerned. - There's
surely some mystery about this man.

787
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:52,451
Maybe the police have 
laid a trap for us.

788
01:01:53,186 --> 01:01:58,090
When we go to kill that man,
police may open fire on us.

789
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:03,235
It's possible that he's
from the police force.

790
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:05,302
Shall we go then?

791
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:12,031
Before attacking the enemy,
it's important to know him.

792
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:17,697
And nobody can do a
better job than Munnibai.

793
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:26,933
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

794
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:36,685
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

795
01:02:36,764 --> 01:02:41,853
"Sister-in-law, 
come light the lamp."

796
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:46,652
"Sister-in-law, 
come light the lamp."

797
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:51,052
"Let me see whether it's my
beloved or someone else."

798
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:53,516
"I'm scared. I'm terrified."

799
01:02:53,596 --> 01:02:59,095
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

800
01:02:59,331 --> 01:03:04,197
"Sister-in-law, 
come light the lamp."

801
01:03:04,277 --> 01:03:09,505
"Sister-in-law, 
come light the lamp."

802
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:13,609
"Let me see whether it's my
beloved or someone else."

803
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:16,054
"I'm scared. I'm terrified."

804
01:03:16,134 --> 01:03:21,165
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

805
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:24,083
"Someone has sneaked in.."

806
01:03:43,628 --> 01:03:45,833
"My heart is beating faster."

807
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:52,190
"Behind the window, 
with my eyes closed.."

808
01:03:52,364 --> 01:03:56,353
"..I sit there thinking, what
have I got myself into?"

809
01:03:57,456 --> 01:04:01,337
"Now what should I do?"

810
01:04:02,235 --> 01:04:07,295
"If it's my beloved, 
I'll keep quiet."

811
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:12,310
"If it's my beloved, 
I'll keep quiet."

812
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:16,808
"If it's someone else,
I'll make lots of noise."

813
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:21,779
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

814
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,418
"Someone has sneaked in.."

815
01:04:48,925 --> 01:04:53,444
"I've been betrayed. 
My heart is sinking."

816
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:57,509
"Someone has arrived."

817
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:06,418
"When our eyes met, my
bangles started to jingle."

818
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:12,320
"I danced like a puppet."

819
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,476
"I danced like a puppet."

820
01:05:17,556 --> 01:05:21,725
"I wonder who pulled the strings."

821
01:05:21,806 --> 01:05:26,699
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

822
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:29,521
"Someone has sneaked in.."

823
01:05:51,337 --> 01:05:55,770
"My eyes are so beautiful, 
with lots of kohl."

824
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:59,684
"Now I've given up."

825
01:05:59,764 --> 01:06:08,258
"I can't see anything.
Perhaps he's hiding somewhere."

826
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:14,420
"If he's hiding in the
house, he'll be caught soon."

827
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:19,252
"If he's hiding in the
house, he'll be caught soon."

828
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:23,737
"If he's hiding in my
heart, then I can't help it."

829
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:28,721
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

830
01:06:28,802 --> 01:06:34,527
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

831
01:06:35,056 --> 01:06:38,429
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

832
01:06:38,509 --> 01:06:43,013
"Someone has sneaked 
in on the terrace."

833
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:45,695
"I'm scared. I'm terrified."

834
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:03,538
Wow! You're a good shot.

835
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,154
But it's futile.

836
01:07:06,835 --> 01:07:08,456
Why is it futile?

837
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:15,320
Had the bullets killed the bandits,
it would've meant something.

838
01:07:15,873 --> 01:07:20,014
Why? What enmity do you 
have with the bandits?

839
01:07:20,802 --> 01:07:25,538
Jabbar Singh attacked our 
village and took me away forcibly.

840
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:31,159
And I lost my honour.

841
01:07:33,235 --> 01:07:35,420
That very day, I took a vow..

842
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:40,122
..I won't rest until I seek
revenge from Jabbar Singh.

843
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:42,889
The entire police 
force of this region..

844
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:45,787
..couldn't catch those
bandits in seven years.

845
01:07:46,848 --> 01:07:49,453
How can a weak girl 
like you confront them?

846
01:07:49,744 --> 01:07:54,252
A woman might be weak,
but she's determined.

847
01:07:56,523 --> 01:08:01,928
She finds a way to 
achieve her objective.

848
01:08:04,306 --> 01:08:05,819
What way have you chosen?

849
01:08:08,154 --> 01:08:10,251
You.  - Me?

850
01:08:14,543 --> 01:08:16,143
If we join hands..

851
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:19,982
..these bandits 
can be destroyed.

852
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:23,971
How's that?

853
01:08:26,381 --> 01:08:30,013
Your gun and my guile.

854
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:43,170
Did you find out he is? 
Is he a cop?

855
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:46,077
I don't know.  
- Or from the CID?

856
01:08:48,014 --> 01:08:51,116
I don't know that either.
- Then what did you find out?

857
01:08:52,748 --> 01:08:56,554
I just got to know 
that he's a young man.

858
01:08:57,753 --> 01:09:02,348
What nonsense. 
- We've merely become friends now.

859
01:09:03,537 --> 01:09:08,953
The rest will be completed when
my beauty and his youth clash.

860
01:09:12,362 --> 01:09:13,842
Help!

861
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,275
Help!

862
01:09:16,511 --> 01:09:17,777
Help!

863
01:09:18,005 --> 01:09:19,734
Somebody?

864
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:41,622
What happened?

865
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:45,139
Looks like you've 
swallowed a lot of water.

866
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:47,091
Lie down on your stomach.

867
01:09:52,107 --> 01:09:54,279
Turn on your back now.

868
01:09:55,384 --> 01:09:56,800
Oh, God!

869
01:10:01,403 --> 01:10:03,762
How are you feeling now?
- I'm feeling better.

870
01:10:04,345 --> 01:10:05,675
Are you feeling better?

871
01:10:07,966 --> 01:10:10,594
Why did you come here? 
- To take a bath.

872
01:10:11,221 --> 01:10:14,021
I slipped. The water was deep.

873
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,896
I'm indebted to you. 
- Don't mention it.

874
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:24,832
It's a good thing I was passing
by or else you would've drowned.

875
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:27,492
I hope you are okay now.  - Yes.

876
01:10:27,665 --> 01:10:29,211
I should be leaving now.

877
01:10:46,354 --> 01:10:49,618
It's you, Anju?
I thought it was some bandit..

878
01:10:51,077 --> 01:10:54,028
Anju, it's me Ajit.  - I know.

879
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:57,640
Then why are you shooting me?
- I'm not shooting at you.

880
01:10:57,868 --> 01:11:00,258
I was only doing 
target practice.

881
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:04,560
She's such a good shot.

882
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,770
Don't you see any difference
between this can and me?

883
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:13,631
There's a lot of difference. 
Despite being empty, it's not useless.

884
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:15,804
I can at least use it
for my target practice.

885
01:11:16,256 --> 01:11:19,089
But why do you have to 
get target practice?

886
01:11:19,586 --> 01:11:23,791
The one, I trusted, is hunting
for somebody else these days.

887
01:11:24,019 --> 01:11:29,186
A prey, which is targeted not
with bullets but with the eyes.

888
01:11:29,978 --> 01:11:31,221
You're forgetting something.

889
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:34,813
My confrontation is with bandits 
and to find those bandits..

890
01:11:34,893 --> 01:11:40,823
Yes, of course. One needs 
big eyes to look for them.

891
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:42,899
Don't misunderstand me.

892
01:11:43,212 --> 01:11:46,391
I'll have to take the help of these
performers to find the bandits.

893
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:49,527
I suspect that. - I see.

894
01:11:49,607 --> 01:11:52,305
That's you were doing 
target practice? - Yes.

895
01:11:52,564 --> 01:11:55,363
Come down.

896
01:11:58,424 --> 01:12:00,511
What happened?  
- Don't touch me.

897
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:02,846
If I don't touch you, how will
I teach you to use the rifle?

898
01:12:02,926 --> 01:12:05,679
I don't know that, 
but don't touch me.

899
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:09,453
Can I touch the 
rifle at least? - Yes.

900
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:14,457
Hold it. Shut your eyes.

901
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,706
Not this one. 
The other one. - Which one?

902
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:23,538
Keep looking. - Where?

903
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,144
Into my eyes.

904
01:12:29,268 --> 01:12:30,889
What do these eyes say?

905
01:12:31,505 --> 01:12:35,266
They say that they have
united with somebody's eyes.

906
01:12:39,547 --> 01:12:42,033
What does my heart say?  
- It says..

907
01:12:43,082 --> 01:12:44,888
..somebody has 
entered your heart.

908
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:52,099
And what does the 
monsoon has to say?

909
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:59,157
"The monsoon is 
saying something."

910
01:12:59,237 --> 01:13:01,891
"What does it say?"

911
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:05,760
"The monsoon is 
saying something."

912
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:08,636
"What does it say?"

913
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:14,550
"All the time, there's
only you in my heart."

914
01:13:15,109 --> 01:13:17,609
"There's only you in my heart."

915
01:13:18,464 --> 01:13:22,140
"These clouds are 
saying something."

916
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:24,561
"What do they say?"

917
01:13:25,091 --> 01:13:28,465
"These clouds are 
saying something."

918
01:13:28,545 --> 01:13:31,362
"What do they say?"

919
01:13:32,259 --> 01:13:37,729
"All the time, there's
only you in my heart."

920
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:41,145
"There's only you in my heart."

921
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:45,350
"The water creates 
such melodious music."

922
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:47,685
"Why does it?"

923
01:13:48,788 --> 01:13:54,712
"In love, our life 
will be like a song."

924
01:13:55,152 --> 01:13:58,331
"In love, our life 
will be like a song."

925
01:14:01,641 --> 01:14:05,282
"These easterlies 
have returned."

926
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:07,952
"Why have they come?"

927
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:11,887
"These easterlies 
have returned."

928
01:14:11,966 --> 01:14:14,524
"Why have they come?"

929
01:14:15,195 --> 01:14:21,228
"Darling, it has brought
your message of love to me."

930
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:28,181
"In those rainy nights.."

931
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:30,601
"What happens?"

932
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:34,882
"In those rainy nights.."

933
01:14:34,962 --> 01:14:37,313
"What happens?"

934
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:43,498
"I can't sleep, while the
rest of the world is sleeping."

935
01:14:44,903 --> 01:14:47,703
"The rest of the 
world is sleeping."

936
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:07,757
"When all the buds blossom.."

937
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,698
"When do they blossom?"

938
01:15:10,922 --> 01:15:14,480
"When all the buds blossom.."

939
01:15:14,685 --> 01:15:17,291
"When do they blossom?"

940
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:24,340
"When our eyes meet."

941
01:15:30,857 --> 01:15:34,489
"My anklets make a 
tinkling sound."

942
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:37,354
"When do they?"

943
01:15:37,434 --> 01:15:40,899
"My anklets make a 
tinkling sound."

944
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:43,884
"When do they?"

945
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:50,769
"When my beauty runs into love."

946
01:15:51,006 --> 01:15:53,774
"It runs into love."

947
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:10,735
"My heart is beating wildly."

948
01:16:11,145 --> 01:16:13,015
"Why does it beat that way?"

949
01:16:13,773 --> 01:16:17,318
"My heart is beating wildly."

950
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,675
"Why does it beat that way?"

951
01:16:20,636 --> 01:16:26,663
"Because I fear people
might hear to my thoughts."

952
01:16:30,283 --> 01:16:37,146
"The travellers return home.."

953
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:39,546
"Why do they return?"

954
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:45,988
"Alone, in an unknown land they 
miss the fairs in their villages."

955
01:16:46,886 --> 01:16:49,707
"They miss the fairs."

956
01:16:49,787 --> 01:16:53,567
"The stream flows swiftly."

957
01:16:53,648 --> 01:16:56,378
"Why does it?"

958
01:16:56,854 --> 01:17:05,584
"It says this atmosphere
is beautiful for the youth."

959
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:09,531
"This monsoon is 
saying something."

960
01:17:09,898 --> 01:17:11,757
"What does it say?"

961
01:17:12,773 --> 01:17:17,400
"This monsoon is saying something.
- This monsoon is saying something."

962
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:24,121
"This monsoon is saying something.
- This monsoon is saying something."

963
01:17:24,202 --> 01:17:26,641
"This monsoon is saying something.
- This monsoon is saying something."

964
01:17:27,494 --> 01:17:31,721
Will you tell me something? 
- Yes, ask me.

965
01:17:32,122 --> 01:17:35,159
You're an outsider 
in this village.

966
01:17:35,938 --> 01:17:37,623
And for this village's sake..

967
01:17:39,656 --> 01:17:41,904
..you're challenging 
Jabbar Singh.

968
01:17:43,656 --> 01:17:46,141
Jabbar Singh doesn't spare
alive not just his enemies..

969
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:50,185
..but his descendants too.

970
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,953
I know that.

971
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:56,963
But I didn't know the 
meaning of duty..

972
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:01,266
..before I came 
to this village.

973
01:18:02,089 --> 01:18:05,958
But after coming to this
village, somebody told me..

974
01:18:06,607 --> 01:18:10,921
that duty is more
important than one's life.

975
01:18:12,024 --> 01:18:15,786
I want to convey this message
to the naive, poor villagers.

976
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:22,736
There's only one way to send the 
message to the entire village..

977
01:18:23,525 --> 01:18:25,170
..that I clash 
with Jabbar Singh.

978
01:18:49,095 --> 01:18:53,376
What happened to you? - No.

979
01:18:54,555 --> 01:18:56,771
Mother..

980
01:18:57,086 --> 01:18:59,280
..nothing can happen to him.

981
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:02,252
You must've had a bad dream.

982
01:19:04,567 --> 01:19:06,869
I cannot deceive him.  - Who?

983
01:19:08,966 --> 01:19:10,502
Ajit.

984
01:19:11,854 --> 01:19:15,400
They will kill him.

985
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:20,286
No, I won't let that happen.

986
01:19:20,643 --> 01:19:26,384
Mother, whatever he is doing, is not 
for himself but for somebody else.

987
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:32,199
And one who gives his
life for another's welfare..

988
01:19:33,086 --> 01:19:37,454
..is not a human 
being, but an angel.

989
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:42,849
Every year it's our attempt that
we arrest them during the fair.

990
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:45,703
Yes. - Jabbar Singh too will come.
And we can catch him.

991
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:49,810
Every year it's our attempt that
we arrest them during the fair.

992
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:52,125
But they change their appearance
when they come there and..

993
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,805
..it becomes impossible to identify
them in the milling thousands.

994
01:19:54,885 --> 01:19:57,410
I've come to solve 
this problem.  - How?

995
01:19:57,714 --> 01:20:01,086
I'll get an indication about Jabbar
Singh's whereabouts and identity.

996
01:20:01,778 --> 01:20:05,691
Who's that man? 
- I can't tell you that.

997
01:20:06,394 --> 01:20:08,135
If I reveal the name, I'd
be compromising his life.

998
01:20:08,438 --> 01:20:11,206
Still, you will surely get an
indication about Jabbar Singh.

999
01:20:12,076 --> 01:20:15,507
The police will be there.
A hint will be enough for us.

1000
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:26,859
Munni, the time has come, my 
gun needs your intelligence.

1001
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:28,643
I'm ready.

1002
01:20:31,237 --> 01:20:32,589
But think it over.

1003
01:20:32,771 --> 01:20:36,079
By doing this, you will make
enemies with Jabbar Singh for life.

1004
01:20:37,073 --> 01:20:41,052
I've thought it over.
You tell me, what have I to do.

1005
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:42,976
The Full Moon fair is
scheduled for tomorrow.

1006
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:47,020
You've seen Jabbar Singh and his 
men in every garb and disguise.

1007
01:20:47,961 --> 01:20:50,934
You will be able 
to identify them.

1008
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:56,217
Just beckon to me which
one of them is Jabbar Singh.

1009
01:20:57,264 --> 01:20:59,971
I will handle the rest. 
- All right.

1010
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:02,132
At the fair then.

1011
01:21:08,617 --> 01:21:11,351
Have you gone mad?

1012
01:21:12,113 --> 01:21:14,759
Do you know the consequences
of what you are doing?

1013
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:17,440
I do. - You don't know anything.

1014
01:21:17,717 --> 01:21:20,425
The entire region trembles at
the mere mention on those bandits.

1015
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:23,036
The entire police force has been
trying to hunt down these bandits...

1016
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:26,720
...for the past 6 years.
What the hell do you know?

1017
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:30,223
That the youth from the city
will be able to catch them?

1018
01:21:30,646 --> 01:21:36,216
Will you make enemies with
Jabbar Singh for that boy?

1019
01:21:38,949 --> 01:21:42,244
Your daughter is not 
such a fool, mother.

1020
01:21:45,559 --> 01:21:50,024
I know that our lives are in
the hands of Jabbar Singh.

1021
01:21:51,729 --> 01:21:59,073
Just see what hint 
I give and to whom.

1022
01:22:03,148 --> 01:22:04,296
All right.

1023
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:09,635
Put on a turban.

1024
01:22:14,143 --> 01:22:16,417
Munni has sent word that
there's danger at the fair.

1025
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:20,377
What's new about that?
- That city youth has laid a trap.

1026
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:22,791
We couldn't get to 
know what he is up to.

1027
01:22:26,234 --> 01:22:29,806
Inform Munni to remain 
close to that boy.

1028
01:22:30,747 --> 01:22:32,217
And that she should
intimate us well in time.

1029
01:23:47,033 --> 01:23:49,532
"Oh my, I'm feeling shy."

1030
01:23:52,447 --> 01:23:54,281
"Oh my, I'm feeling shy."

1031
01:23:55,184 --> 01:23:57,723
"Oh my, I'm feeling
shy, whom should I tell.."

1032
01:23:57,802 --> 01:24:06,308
"..how can I tell this to
everyone, the tales of my love."

1033
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:08,686
"Of my beloved.."

1034
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:15,190
"The three signs of my beloved."

1035
01:24:15,269 --> 01:24:17,498
"Oh my, I'm feeling
shy, whom should I tell.."

1036
01:24:17,578 --> 01:24:25,741
"..how can I tell this to
everyone, the tales of my love."

1037
01:24:56,943 --> 01:24:59,181
"The first sign is.."

1038
01:25:00,618 --> 01:25:03,407
"For whom I'm so 
crazy about it.."

1039
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:07,527
"The first sign is.."

1040
01:25:07,607 --> 01:25:10,337
"For whom I'm so 
crazy about it.."

1041
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:15,741
"His youth is like a
stormy weather, crazy one."

1042
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:22,100
"His youth is like a
stormy weather, crazy one."

1043
01:25:25,061 --> 01:25:33,559
"In front of him the rest
of the youth is worthless."

1044
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:36,078
"Oh my, I'm feeling
shy, whom should I tell.."

1045
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:44,315
"..how can I tell this to
everyone, the tales of my love."

1046
01:26:17,098 --> 01:26:18,827
A black shawl, 
with a black turban.

1047
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:27,660
"His attire is blue and
his turban is yellow."

1048
01:26:29,681 --> 01:26:34,492
"His attire is blue and
his turban is yellow."

1049
01:26:34,572 --> 01:26:37,454
"His beauty is unimaginable.."

1050
01:26:37,534 --> 01:26:40,081
"he is such kind of a
fellow, colourful man."

1051
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:42,896
"His beauty is unimaginable,"

1052
01:26:42,975 --> 01:26:46,884
"he is such kind of a
fellow, colourful man."

1053
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:54,094
"His walk is wavy, 
his colour is pinkish."

1054
01:26:54,732 --> 01:26:57,835
"And his eyes are bloomy."

1055
01:26:57,915 --> 01:27:00,332
"Oh my, I'm feeling
shy, whom should I tell.."

1056
01:27:00,412 --> 01:27:08,980
"..how can I tell this to
everyone, the tales of my love."

1057
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:46,273
"With his eyes lowered he
pulls every breathe out of you."

1058
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:53,224
"With his eyes lowered he
pulls every breathe out of you."

1059
01:27:53,304 --> 01:27:58,619
"Under the Pipal tree, way
behind the fair, he's waiting."

1060
01:27:58,699 --> 01:28:05,029
"Under the Pipal tree, way
behind the fair, he's waiting."

1061
01:28:07,828 --> 01:28:12,616
"He takes away my sleep,
he has ruined my comfort."

1062
01:28:13,144 --> 01:28:16,377
"He does such kind of treachery."

1063
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,971
"Oh my, I'm feeling
shy, whom should I tell.."

1064
01:28:19,051 --> 01:28:27,156
"..how can I tell this to
everyone, the tales of my love."

1065
01:28:27,577 --> 01:28:29,468
"Of my beloved.."

1066
01:28:30,247 --> 01:28:36,107
"The three signs of my beloved."

1067
01:28:36,188 --> 01:28:38,592
"Oh my, I'm feeling
shy, whom should I tell.."

1068
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:46,658
"..how can I tell this to
everyone, the tales of my love."

1069
01:30:31,256 --> 01:30:35,019
What now, Thakur?  
- A lot can happen.

1070
01:30:36,521 --> 01:30:38,969
The cops could induce him
into becoming a state witness..

1071
01:30:39,461 --> 01:30:40,724
..by promising him protection.

1072
01:30:42,006 --> 01:30:46,364
The moment he blurts things out, 
we will all be hanged to death.

1073
01:30:47,372 --> 01:30:49,945
Why did the scoundrel 
not shoot himself?

1074
01:31:50,662 --> 01:31:53,058
Shoot, Thakur.

1075
01:32:02,904 --> 01:32:05,434
Shoot, Thakur.

1076
01:32:39,445 --> 01:32:43,532
Inside information was leaked out 
for the first time in 7 years.

1077
01:33:39,016 --> 01:33:41,956
Who is that traitor?

1078
01:33:43,018 --> 01:33:44,661
Who is that betrayer?

1079
01:33:46,574 --> 01:33:51,764
Own up and be sure you
will get a peaceful death.

1080
01:33:57,018 --> 01:33:59,136
Just one bullet.

1081
01:34:00,559 --> 01:34:04,479
And if I hunt him down..
he'll die a dog's death.

1082
01:34:21,804 --> 01:34:26,221
What's the matter? You can't 
see me in the eye today?

1083
01:34:39,391 --> 01:34:42,625
Don't lower your eyes. 
Don't be afraid.

1084
01:34:44,907 --> 01:34:50,063
Those who have a clear conscience,
have their sight straight too.

1085
01:34:52,131 --> 01:34:54,475
And those who have 
evil on their minds..

1086
01:34:56,742 --> 01:35:01,585
..I can see even in 
stark darkness.

1087
01:35:03,885 --> 01:35:05,546
That's if I'm corrupt.

1088
01:35:17,412 --> 01:35:19,055
You sully women.

1089
01:35:20,613 --> 01:35:21,909
Traitor.

1090
01:35:23,292 --> 01:35:25,299
You did this, didn't you?

1091
01:35:25,662 --> 01:35:28,473
No, Thakur. I couldn't 
recognise him myself.

1092
01:35:29,207 --> 01:35:31,085
I haven't been a traitor.

1093
01:35:31,725 --> 01:35:35,920
Get up, and listen carefully.

1094
01:35:36,881 --> 01:35:39,510
The task that I'm
assigning to you right now..

1095
01:35:40,226 --> 01:35:45,278
..if you make any mistake
in it, I'll get to know..

1096
01:35:45,944 --> 01:35:48,902
..how inside information 
is leaked outside.

1097
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:52,751
Thank God the matter
didn't worsen too much.

1098
01:35:53,072 --> 01:35:57,101
Jabbar Singh is merely suspicious
of your daughter. He's not convinced.

1099
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:59,956
Henceforth, keep your 
daughter under check.

1100
01:36:00,293 --> 01:36:05,248
If she goes against Jabbar Singh
again, all of us will be doomed.

1101
01:36:12,082 --> 01:36:13,708
Unload the stuff.

1102
01:36:16,207 --> 01:36:17,747
Greetings.  - Greetings.

1103
01:36:17,827 --> 01:36:19,338
How come you have come here?

1104
01:36:19,417 --> 01:36:21,023
From today, we will 
be stationed here.

1105
01:36:21,215 --> 01:36:24,181
You're kind, sir. Now the villagers
will be able to sleep peacefully.

1106
01:36:25,167 --> 01:36:27,018
How can we serve you, sir?

1107
01:36:27,493 --> 01:36:30,053
Please arrange for 
some water.  - Sure.

1108
01:36:30,132 --> 01:36:34,179
No, I will never do this work. 
- You won't?

1109
01:36:34,351 --> 01:36:37,957
All right. Tie her up.  - Mother.

1110
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:41,081
I will inform the police.

1111
01:36:41,815 --> 01:36:46,858
I won't rest till Ajit and
the soldier are eliminated.

1112
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,651
No, mother.

1113
01:36:48,878 --> 01:36:52,899
I beg of you. Please don't go.

1114
01:36:53,202 --> 01:36:57,699
Sir, Jabbar Singh and his gang were
sighted near the Dabok watercourse.

1115
01:36:57,779 --> 01:36:59,970
The entire gang.

1116
01:37:00,424 --> 01:37:02,034
Near the Dabok watercourse.

1117
01:37:02,921 --> 01:37:05,884
Hello coming charlie.

1118
01:37:06,241 --> 01:37:08,014
Charlie speaking.

1119
01:37:08,186 --> 01:37:11,904
Jabbar Singh and his gang..at the
Dabok watercourse 20 miles from here.

1120
01:37:12,574 --> 01:37:14,595
Take your company 
there quickly.

1121
01:37:14,813 --> 01:37:16,402
Over. - Okay.

1122
01:38:12,314 --> 01:38:17,860
Lower the flame. 
Or else face the bullet.

1123
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:29,190
What're you doing, Anju? 
- Let me go.

1124
01:38:29,269 --> 01:38:32,064
Have you gone mad?
- They will kill them. Let me go.

1125
01:38:32,144 --> 01:38:33,794
All the villagers have 
hidden themselves.

1126
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:35,482
What can you do 
all by yourself?

1127
01:38:35,665 --> 01:38:38,627
No, let me go.  
- You won't go.

1128
01:39:22,907 --> 01:39:24,302
Father.

1129
01:39:28,247 --> 01:39:31,284
The bullet has found the target.
I cannot save myself now.

1130
01:39:31,364 --> 01:39:33,166
You'd better run away.
- Don't say that, dad.

1131
01:39:33,685 --> 01:39:37,090
What did you say? 
Say it once again.

1132
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:39,610
Yes.. dad.

1133
01:39:40,689 --> 01:39:48,107
Dear I pined all my 
life to hear this word.

1134
01:39:51,782 --> 01:39:55,047
Do you know..merely 
by saying this word..

1135
01:39:56,355 --> 01:40:00,690
..this childless father is
sure to go to the Heaven.

1136
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:07,815
Dad.

1137
01:40:30,421 --> 01:40:34,096
Stop. Let the cops come now.

1138
01:40:35,815 --> 01:40:37,480
Not even their bones 
will now be found.

1139
01:41:05,275 --> 01:41:07,318
Call Tulsi. - All right, sir.

1140
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:35,114
It's me, Ajit.  - You?

1141
01:41:37,979 --> 01:41:41,686
I thought that you too
perished with the soldier.

1142
01:41:43,591 --> 01:41:46,023
Jabbar Singh too believes so.

1143
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:49,395
I want his belief 
to remain intact..

1144
01:41:49,817 --> 01:41:53,006
..till I eliminate each 
member of his gang.

1145
01:41:54,184 --> 01:41:57,957
Till then, I'll have to hide
in the ruins and the jungles.

1146
01:41:58,162 --> 01:42:01,622
But you can hide 
here in our house.

1147
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:07,405
No. I don't want anybody
to know that I am alive.

1148
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:10,561
For how long will you
starve in the jungles?

1149
01:42:11,242 --> 01:42:12,896
Don't worry about me.

1150
01:42:12,975 --> 01:42:16,518
I swear of you. Tell me, where 
will I be able to meet you?

1151
01:42:21,176 --> 01:42:23,198
I'll be in those ruins.

1152
01:42:23,278 --> 01:42:28,063
But it's dangerous.
You had better watch out.

1153
01:42:28,582 --> 01:42:34,895
Uncle, how did you woo
your wife before marriage?

1154
01:42:35,193 --> 01:42:37,295
I used to praise 
her, flatter her..

1155
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:41,456
..and give her old 
man a massage.

1156
01:42:41,536 --> 01:42:45,162
See this, uncle, 
my direction is wrong.

1157
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:47,941
But Gopi's father gets
furious when he sees me.

1158
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:50,264
And she gets enraged 
when I praise her.

1159
01:42:50,345 --> 01:42:53,302
You have got so many boys 
in the villages to marry.

1160
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:57,335
Why don't you help me too, Uncle?
- There's only way.

1161
01:42:57,415 --> 01:43:01,248
Kill a bandit.
The prize-money that you get..

1162
01:43:01,328 --> 01:43:02,837
..I'll get you married 
with that money.

1163
01:43:02,917 --> 01:43:08,729
What's so great about it?
I'll kill not one, but two bandits.

1164
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:10,297
Watch your weight.

1165
01:43:10,377 --> 01:43:12,351
What are you saying, uncle?

1166
01:43:12,431 --> 01:43:17,380
When I stand, I'm lean,
and when I sit, I'm stout.

1167
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:19,378
But I've understood 
what you mean to say.

1168
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,129
Understood, you shave.

1169
01:43:35,635 --> 01:43:39,700
What happened, Thakur?
- The hoof has come off.

1170
01:44:06,524 --> 01:44:08,059
Here, Thakur, a coconut.

1171
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:13,020
Go and offer it in the
temple yourself, today.

1172
01:44:49,346 --> 01:44:50,675
Brother..

1173
01:44:56,577 --> 01:44:58,004
Brother..

1174
01:44:58,545 --> 01:45:00,350
Who is it?

1175
01:45:06,122 --> 01:45:08,663
Brother, brother.

1176
01:45:12,295 --> 01:45:13,645
Brother..

1177
01:45:36,251 --> 01:45:39,259
Scoundrel. Leave her.

1178
01:45:45,354 --> 01:45:46,803
Pick up the gun.

1179
01:45:48,954 --> 01:45:50,176
Come on.

1180
01:46:40,577 --> 01:46:42,652
Blood instead of blood.

1181
01:46:42,732 --> 01:46:44,554
Amazing.

1182
01:46:44,634 --> 01:46:47,527
In the past 5 years, this is
the first bandit to be killed.

1183
01:46:47,607 --> 01:46:50,273
Who's that brave man?

1184
01:46:50,353 --> 01:46:53,408
What're you saying?

1185
01:46:53,938 --> 01:46:56,425
Does it take any time
to identify a brave man?

1186
01:46:56,505 --> 01:47:00,975
You people should apply dust
from my feet on your forehead.

1187
01:47:01,055 --> 01:47:04,175
Why? Have you been to 
a pilgrimage or what?

1188
01:47:04,256 --> 01:47:06,176
What you are saying.

1189
01:47:06,543 --> 01:47:09,192
Killing a bandit is as good
as going on a pilgrimage.

1190
01:47:09,271 --> 01:47:11,171
You killed him?  
- Yes, of course.

1191
01:47:11,251 --> 01:47:16,045
I have killed him. 
- We've had it!

1192
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:18,360
Did you hear how it happened?

1193
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:25,600
First Rupa's bell 
will ring then Kalla.

1194
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,643
Then Gabbar's bell will..

1195
01:47:40,768 --> 01:47:43,871
Listen everyone.

1196
01:47:44,098 --> 01:47:46,778
Should anybody provide shelter 
to that soldier's stooge..

1197
01:47:46,859 --> 01:47:50,087
..the village, will 
be razed to ashes.

1198
01:49:31,547 --> 01:49:33,742
I will stop him. 
You had better run.

1199
01:50:07,415 --> 01:50:10,171
The news that I've brought..

1200
01:50:12,064 --> 01:50:13,869
..will make you 
give me a reward.

1201
01:50:13,948 --> 01:50:15,208
What's the news?

1202
01:50:15,457 --> 01:50:19,533
The girl who's friendly
with Ajit has been found.

1203
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,122
Who's she?  - Anju.

1204
01:50:23,339 --> 01:50:25,802
Anju who? - Daughter 
of the village chief..

1205
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:29,434
..who wanted to testify 
against Haria..

1206
01:50:49,899 --> 01:50:51,694
Why didn't you inform me?

1207
01:50:52,851 --> 01:50:54,452
What good would 
that have done?

1208
01:50:56,917 --> 01:51:02,311
If you had informed me, we
would have won the battle by now.

1209
01:51:02,778 --> 01:51:05,793
How's that, Thakur?  
- I'll tell you.

1210
01:51:43,007 --> 01:51:45,688
Are you content now?

1211
01:51:45,938 --> 01:51:49,958
You have ruined 
my entire family.

1212
01:51:54,738 --> 01:51:58,143
You motivated people 
against the bandits.

1213
01:51:58,769 --> 01:52:00,424
You opposed them.

1214
01:52:00,503 --> 01:52:08,314
They have taken my Anju away
because of you. Here, read this.

1215
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:18,131
'If you want Anju back, come
to the Chika tunnel unarmed.'

1216
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:22,693
'A white horse there 
will bring you to me.'

1217
01:52:23,667 --> 01:52:26,792
'If a cop is seen with you..

1218
01:52:27,451 --> 01:52:30,305
..Anju will be shot dead.'

1219
01:52:38,314 --> 01:52:43,363
Don't worry. 
Your Anju will be unharmed.

1220
01:52:44,422 --> 01:52:46,639
She will be with 
you by evening.

1221
01:52:47,676 --> 01:52:49,764
He wants Ajit, not Anju.

1222
01:53:09,656 --> 01:53:13,828
Beautiful vamp, 
I didn't know that..

1223
01:53:13,908 --> 01:53:16,357
..the woman whom I assumed
to be the society's reject..

1224
01:53:16,737 --> 01:53:18,813
..would prove to be 
Jabbar Singh's spy.

1225
01:53:21,202 --> 01:53:25,061
That you would prove 
to be a traitor to me.

1226
01:53:30,318 --> 01:53:34,761
You have disturbed
the peace of this village.

1227
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:38,288
You continued to supply..

1228
01:53:38,368 --> 01:53:42,948
..ammunition to the bandits.

1229
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:50,448
You did show your true colours.
Why don't you speak?

1230
01:53:50,913 --> 01:53:56,536
Where is all the blabbering
lies that you used to tell?

1231
01:53:57,671 --> 01:54:00,633
Yes, it's all true.

1232
01:54:01,076 --> 01:54:04,038
As a puppet in the 
Hands of the bandits..

1233
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:08,039
..I've committed 
several abominable deeds.

1234
01:54:09,238 --> 01:54:11,962
I came to this 
village to spy on you.

1235
01:54:13,952 --> 01:54:15,714
After meeting you..

1236
01:54:15,793 --> 01:54:21,519
..I felt that there's
goodness in the world.

1237
01:54:22,016 --> 01:54:26,675
I thought that a fallen
man can rise once again.

1238
01:54:27,854 --> 01:54:32,470
Earlier, I had fear for a
dreaded man like Jabbar Singh.

1239
01:54:32,859 --> 01:54:37,194
Then I began to have
feelings of love for you.

1240
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:41,128
And to win me over..

1241
01:54:41,496 --> 01:54:44,978
..you sent my Anju to a
dreaded bandit like Jabbar.

1242
01:54:45,058 --> 01:54:47,692
No. It's a lie.

1243
01:54:48,296 --> 01:54:52,631
I've done many wrong things. But I've 
had no hand in Anju's abduction.

1244
01:54:53,128 --> 01:54:57,421
I feel like cutting you to pieces
and feeding you to the dogs.

1245
01:54:58,523 --> 01:55:01,810
But I won't smear my hands
with the filthy blood of a whore.

1246
01:56:45,692 --> 01:56:46,773
Where's Anju?

1247
01:56:53,051 --> 01:56:56,339
I've come, Thakur. 
I'm in your captivity.

1248
01:56:58,251 --> 01:57:00,465
Let Anju go. - Let her go?

1249
01:57:01,434 --> 01:57:04,193
Let go a priceless gem
I've laid my hands on?

1250
01:57:06,095 --> 01:57:08,153
I'm not such a fool.

1251
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:15,055
I had heard that bandits
are true to their words..

1252
01:57:15,135 --> 01:57:17,105
..that they respect women.

1253
01:57:17,493 --> 01:57:22,189
Moreover, you are a Thakur.
You should stick to your word.

1254
01:57:22,596 --> 01:57:24,110
What Thakur?

1255
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:27,069
What word?

1256
01:57:27,595 --> 01:57:30,129
The times you speak of..

1257
01:57:30,336 --> 01:57:34,141
..has passed eons ago.

1258
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:38,145
Jabbar Singh has learnt
only two things in life.

1259
01:57:38,993 --> 01:57:41,554
One, to take advantage 
of an opportunity.

1260
01:57:42,384 --> 01:57:45,756
The second, to eliminate
all traces of the enemy.

1261
01:57:46,345 --> 01:57:51,318
Your enmity is with me.
You may treat me as you like.

1262
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:54,778
What enmity do you have 
with this innocent girl?

1263
01:57:54,858 --> 01:57:59,163
Not with her, but 
her ruthless youth.

1264
01:58:00,358 --> 01:58:05,270
Her beauty, her 
complexion, her youth..

1265
01:58:05,797 --> 01:58:09,395
I swear..she's so 
intoxicating from head to toe.

1266
02:00:10,234 --> 02:00:11,661
Don't be afraid.

1267
02:00:12,942 --> 02:00:17,742
If I wanted to kill you I
wouldn't have missed the target.

1268
02:00:20,198 --> 02:00:23,839
For you, I've thought 
of such a death..

1269
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:28,631
hearing of which the
entire region will tremble.

1270
02:01:13,024 --> 02:01:18,395
"Should he be killed, 
or should he freed."

1271
02:01:18,627 --> 02:01:23,393
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1272
02:01:23,676 --> 02:01:28,683
"Should he be killed, 
or should he freed."

1273
02:01:28,762 --> 02:01:33,644
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1274
02:01:34,012 --> 02:01:38,779
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1275
02:01:38,859 --> 02:01:43,991
"Should you be served liquor
or should you be served venom."

1276
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:48,715
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1277
02:01:49,028 --> 02:01:53,666
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1278
02:02:13,614 --> 02:02:18,264
"I've even made noise
with my glass bangles."

1279
02:02:18,761 --> 02:02:23,128
"I've even set my 
whole hair free."

1280
02:02:26,425 --> 02:02:31,192
"I've even made noise
with my glass bangles."

1281
02:02:31,516 --> 02:02:36,036
"I've even set my 
whole hair free."

1282
02:02:36,251 --> 02:02:41,409
"You are locked up in shackles."

1283
02:02:41,488 --> 02:02:46,706
"Did you like the shackles
you are locked up in?"

1284
02:02:46,787 --> 02:02:52,048
"Should you be locked
up or should you be freed."

1285
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:56,934
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1286
02:02:57,247 --> 02:03:01,864
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1287
02:03:25,076 --> 02:03:29,994
"I feel like laughing 
on your story."

1288
02:03:30,275 --> 02:03:35,367
"I feel pity for your youth."

1289
02:03:37,659 --> 02:03:42,416
"I feel like laughing 
on your story."

1290
02:03:42,497 --> 02:03:47,282
"I feel pity for your youth."

1291
02:03:47,616 --> 02:03:52,404
"Today you are.."

1292
02:03:52,484 --> 02:03:57,733
"Today you are under my mercy."

1293
02:03:57,814 --> 02:04:03,031
"Should it be broken or
your hearts should be joined."

1294
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:07,711
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1295
02:04:07,917 --> 02:04:12,738
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1296
02:04:32,501 --> 02:04:37,452
"You are the firefly 
of a dimming flame."

1297
02:04:37,723 --> 02:04:42,685
"What is your last 
request, oh crazy one."

1298
02:04:45,085 --> 02:04:49,648
"You are the firefly 
of a dimming flame."

1299
02:04:50,036 --> 02:04:54,761
"What is your last 
request, oh crazy one."

1300
02:04:54,841 --> 02:04:59,907
"Today you will lose.."

1301
02:04:59,987 --> 02:05:05,117
"Today you will lose
your rate, oh crazy one."

1302
02:05:05,197 --> 02:05:10,435
"Should you be cut off
or should you be freed."

1303
02:05:10,515 --> 02:05:15,494
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1304
02:05:15,574 --> 02:05:20,293
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1305
02:05:20,373 --> 02:05:25,136
"Should he be killed, 
or should he be freed."

1306
02:05:25,216 --> 02:05:29,915
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1307
02:05:30,226 --> 02:05:35,125
"Tell me, how 
should we treat you."

1308
02:06:04,055 --> 02:06:05,731
Come on.

1309
02:06:11,299 --> 02:06:14,348
Leave quickly with Anju.

1310
02:06:14,427 --> 02:06:17,148
I've laced their 
liquor with a sedative.

1311
02:06:17,228 --> 02:06:19,440
It'll keep them 
asleep till morning.

1312
02:06:19,645 --> 02:06:23,429
Munni has made an enemy
of Jabbar Singh by saving us.

1313
02:06:23,786 --> 02:06:25,537
He'll never spare her.

1314
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:28,477
He'll come to the 
village and kill her.

1315
02:06:28,889 --> 02:06:30,953
I've come to request 
for her protection.

1316
02:06:31,308 --> 02:06:32,359
Don't worry.

1317
02:06:32,439 --> 02:06:34,532
We've got orders from headquarters
to build a police station here.

1318
02:06:35,363 --> 02:06:38,477
Till we are around, Jabbar
Singh will never come here.

1319
02:07:34,301 --> 02:07:35,483
Bring the jeep!

1320
02:08:45,872 --> 02:08:47,277
Roop Singh!

1321
02:09:01,073 --> 02:09:03,366
The bridge has been blown away.

1322
02:09:04,501 --> 02:09:11,235
No policeman can approach
you with help by this evening.

1323
02:09:11,559 --> 02:09:15,266
We have no enmity 
with the villagers.

1324
02:09:15,346 --> 02:09:20,694
Our enmity is with that rascal
who has dared to challenge us.

1325
02:09:20,774 --> 02:09:23,266
And to whom you've 
provided shelter.

1326
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:27,331
We give you 15 minutes.

1327
02:09:27,412 --> 02:09:31,181
If you listen to us, 
we won't harm you.

1328
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:34,229
Else we won't spare anybody.

1329
02:09:34,309 --> 02:09:37,591
Remember, after 15 
minutes pass away..

1330
02:09:37,671 --> 02:09:41,017
..there won't be anyone
left to mourn your deaths.

1331
02:09:41,098 --> 02:09:44,261
Hide Munni quickly 
and bring my gun.

1332
02:09:46,908 --> 02:09:48,065
Here you are.

1333
02:09:49,395 --> 02:09:53,072
Listen. Shut all 
doors and windows.

1334
02:09:53,439 --> 02:09:56,076
Until you hear my 
call, don't open it.

1335
02:09:57,741 --> 02:10:00,248
Charlie calling Peter.
Charlie calling Peter.

1336
02:10:00,328 --> 02:10:02,791
Come in, Charlie. 
Come in, Charlie. Over!

1337
02:10:02,974 --> 02:10:04,639
I've been lured 
out of the village.

1338
02:10:04,899 --> 02:10:06,283
The bandits have 
blown up the bridge.

1339
02:10:06,363 --> 02:10:09,267
I fear that Jabbar Singh
might attack the village.

1340
02:10:09,677 --> 02:10:11,786
Send help there 
immediately. Over.

1341
02:10:12,002 --> 02:10:15,764
Still, you're closer to the village
than other district police stations.

1342
02:10:15,845 --> 02:10:18,414
Try to reach there at 
your earliest. Over.

1343
02:10:25,603 --> 02:10:27,906
The announcement has
been made in the village.

1344
02:10:28,261 --> 02:10:30,987
Baliya! Come on.

1345
02:10:36,555 --> 02:10:37,993
Come with me.

1346
02:10:44,154 --> 02:10:45,398
Uday!

1347
02:11:05,895 --> 02:11:09,744
Somebody come with me!
What's wrong with you people?

1348
02:11:10,025 --> 02:11:13,961
Son, who are you calling out
to in this village of the dead?

1349
02:11:15,139 --> 02:11:19,235
Nobody will hear your voice.

1350
02:11:20,176 --> 02:11:25,712
These cowards cannot help you.

1351
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:31,971
If you must ask for help,
ask Him, who helps everyone.

1352
02:11:32,545 --> 02:11:36,577
Call out to Him, who 
listens to everybody.

1353
02:12:10,015 --> 02:12:11,583
Villagers!

1354
02:12:14,015 --> 02:12:20,210
We gave you 15 minutes
to hand over Ajit to us.

1355
02:12:21,215 --> 02:12:28,545
This is my final warning.
Hand over our enemy to us.

1356
02:12:31,047 --> 02:12:37,675
Else we will attack you and you
will yourself be held responsible.

1357
02:12:39,479 --> 02:12:42,311
Before destroying this village..

1358
02:12:42,723 --> 02:12:47,252
..we will start killing
the women and children.

1359
02:12:47,836 --> 02:12:49,879
Jabbar Singh!

1360
02:12:50,732 --> 02:12:55,143
Don't you dare touch any woman,
man or child from the village!

1361
02:12:55,725 --> 02:12:59,813
Your enmity is with me,
not with these villagers!

1362
02:13:00,028 --> 02:13:03,228
If you have the courage, 
come take me away!

1363
02:13:03,563 --> 02:13:09,304
Just like you've been lurking over
this village in the form of death..

1364
02:13:09,649 --> 02:13:12,849
..today I challenge you
in the form of your death.

1365
02:15:52,984 --> 02:15:55,604
Not me.

1366
02:15:56,202 --> 02:15:57,335
Come in. He's inside.

1367
02:16:13,082 --> 02:16:17,018
He's dead. My partner is dead.

1368
02:16:17,099 --> 02:16:21,049
Now who will treat me 
to free liquor?

1369
02:16:24,101 --> 02:16:27,492
You cheat! 
- No, I haven't cheated you.

1370
02:16:27,572 --> 02:16:31,253
It was my partner. 
- It was your partner?

1371
02:16:31,333 --> 02:16:37,287
Get ready to die. Turn this way.
And open your eyes and look.

1372
02:16:39,077 --> 02:16:42,311
You? Here? Then where is he?

1373
02:16:42,390 --> 02:16:44,239
He's up there!

1374
02:17:07,125 --> 02:17:09,434
What are you doing?  
- I'm loading it.

1375
02:17:09,607 --> 02:17:12,443
Does one load a gun like this?
- Then how do you do it?

1376
02:17:12,523 --> 02:17:16,707
How do I know? I only know 
how to unload a bottle.

1377
02:17:21,379 --> 02:17:24,501
Is there a bullet in this gun?
There's no bullet in mine.

1378
02:18:01,156 --> 02:18:04,010
Scoundrel! Traitor!

1379
02:18:29,903 --> 02:18:33,817
Where are the bandits?
I won't spare them. Here I am!

1380
02:18:33,897 --> 02:18:35,103
Hands up!

1381
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:47,350
Stop! You fed him liquor.
Did you take money from him?

1382
02:18:47,430 --> 02:18:51,587
Before I could ask him money, 
you shot him. - Shut up.

1383
02:18:51,667 --> 02:18:54,754
Do you remember the principle
of our partnership? - What?

1384
02:18:54,834 --> 02:18:57,934
We may lose our life, but..
- We will never lose our liquor.

1385
02:18:58,247 --> 02:19:00,181
The bottle is still there.

1386
02:19:00,262 --> 02:19:02,280
Hold this. 
- What will I do with this?

1387
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:05,199
Just watch what I do. - Why are 
you putting liquor in it?

1388
02:19:05,279 --> 02:19:08,691
The stomach it enters, 
the fire doubles up.

1389
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:10,680
Yes. - Fill it.

1390
02:19:16,658 --> 02:19:18,681
Shame on you!

1391
02:19:18,761 --> 02:19:23,079
One man is facing so 
many of them. Come out!

1392
02:19:23,159 --> 02:19:25,998
What can I do? - Hide here 
like a coward. I'm going out.

1393
02:19:26,226 --> 02:19:29,513
Stop! Where are you going?
I will go. - Come on.

1394
02:19:54,604 --> 02:19:56,464
Uncle! - Hariram!

1395
02:19:56,543 --> 02:19:58,064
Uncle! - Hariram!

1396
02:19:58,539 --> 02:20:01,242
Open the door! - What is it?

1397
02:20:01,459 --> 02:20:04,335
There are so many bandits,
and he's all alone. Come out!

1398
02:21:34,379 --> 02:21:36,249
Come on. What are 
you waiting for?

1399
02:21:40,779 --> 02:21:42,031
Son!

1400
02:22:06,117 --> 02:22:08,513
Kill him!

1401
02:22:35,218 --> 02:22:40,252
'Aunt? Why do you call me, Aunt?
Am I not your mother?'

1402
02:22:47,441 --> 02:22:48,431
Yes.

1403
02:22:51,414 --> 02:22:53,120
I'm your son, Mother.

1404
02:22:54,554 --> 02:22:56,049
I'm your son.

1405
02:22:56,854 --> 02:23:00,737
Catch him! 
Don't let him escape!

1406
02:23:10,536 --> 02:23:14,272
Beat him! Kill him!

1407
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:35,316
Beat him! Kill him!

1408
02:24:11,096 --> 02:24:13,431
Scoundrel! Fire!

1409
02:24:15,441 --> 02:24:17,134
Shoot, you rascal!

1410
02:24:19,584 --> 02:24:21,314
You coward!

1411
02:24:22,298 --> 02:24:26,903
No, Thakur. I don't open 
fire at an unarmed person.

1412
02:25:42,634 --> 02:25:44,385
Where's the rascal? 
- Where is he?

1413
02:25:44,465 --> 02:25:48,666
Where's the rascal?
- You won't find them now.

1414
02:25:52,699 --> 02:25:57,672
Brother, who killed you? 
Who killed him?

1415
02:25:57,877 --> 02:26:00,255
Tell me or else..

1416
02:26:00,557 --> 02:26:05,162
I too have been shot. You fraud!
You stabbed me in the back?

1417
02:26:05,243 --> 02:26:08,559
You fired the shot yourself.
Nothing has happened to you.

1418
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:11,542
Is it? From this gun? - Yes.

1419
02:26:11,622 --> 02:26:13,554
Hold it.  
- I got saved. I didn't die.

1420
02:26:17,075 --> 02:26:20,891
We are not what you think.
We are not bandits.

1421
02:26:21,334 --> 02:26:23,875
We are villagers. - My partner.

1422
02:26:23,954 --> 02:26:29,096
Sir, we killed three or four bandits. 
Will we get the reward?

1423
02:26:29,176 --> 02:26:30,423
Fifty-fifty.

1424
02:26:30,611 --> 02:26:33,894
And the remaining work
has been done by Ajit.

1425
02:26:36,055 --> 02:26:40,282
You've done a great job, Mr. Ajit.
- No, Inspector.

1426
02:26:41,093 --> 02:26:44,628
Whatever has happened is thanks to 
the help of all the villagers.

1427
02:26:45,157 --> 02:26:48,661
Inspector, Mr. Ajit  
has explained to us..

1428
02:26:48,877 --> 02:26:51,827
..that before demanding our
rights from the government..

1429
02:26:52,001 --> 02:26:53,698
..we should first 
fulfil our duties.

1430
02:26:54,476 --> 02:26:56,453
Yes.  - We've woken 
up to the reality.

1431
02:26:56,853 --> 02:26:59,729
Now we can protect
ourselves and the village too.

1432
02:27:00,291 --> 02:27:03,091
Our village is 
a part of our country.

1433
02:27:03,848 --> 02:27:07,664
Every man, woman and child of the 
village will be its guardian.

1434
02:27:09,977 --> 02:27:12,714
I'm happy that this 
village has awakened.

1435
02:27:12,793 --> 02:27:14,183
Tomorrow it will be 
another village.

1436
02:27:14,263 --> 02:27:16,572
Thereafter the entire
country will be awakened.

1437
02:27:17,329 --> 02:27:20,768
Then there will be peace
in the whole country.

1438
02:27:21,395 --> 02:27:24,720
And whoever spreads disturbance
will meet with the same fate..

1439
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:27,439
..as meted out to Jabbar
Singh by the villagers.

1440
02:27:28,605 --> 02:27:31,893
"This monsoon is 
saying something."

1441
02:27:32,357 --> 02:27:34,237
"What does it say?"

1442
02:27:35,168 --> 02:27:38,180
"This monsoon is saying something.
- This monsoon is saying something."

1443
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:41,510
"This monsoon is saying something.
- This monsoon is saying something."

1444
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:45,095
"This monsoon is saying something.
- This monsoon is saying something."
