00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,247
'He is the traitor.'

181
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,081
'Some one is coming.'

182
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:37,422
'Give my money.'

183
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,829
'Captain Srivastav!'

184
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:41,921
'Our Boss!'

185
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,091
'Take this, one lakh dollar.'

186
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,843
'l also want the details
of other four peoples.'

187
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,946
'Why are you doing this, Sir?'

188
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,178
'Vikram, you and here?'

189
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,782
'We all there in front of you.'

190
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,055
'But do you remember Srivastava.
Vikram.'

191
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:08,215
'lieutenant Anil Khanna. No
Vikram, you can't do like this.'

192
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,384
'Sepoy Khabal Kumar.
We will share this money.'

193
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,795
'Naik subedhar Sukhbir Singh.
See Vikram! No, stop it.'

194
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,795
'What's happening, where
are the rest?'

195
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,058
'Stop there, Sir?'

196
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,223
'This is our personal matter.'

197
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,391
'Please.'

198
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:21,798
'Not u nder my command.'

199
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,809
'You can't go ahead, Sir.'

200
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,146
'Sheeba, this is the
land of enemies.'

201
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,145
'We all are in danger, don't
make it, more complicated.'

202
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,079
'Sorry Sir.'

203
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:34,809
'Vikram!'

204
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:36,419
'Lance naik Shakil Ahmed.
Vikram Vikram look.'

205
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,078
'Lieutenant Padmini Banerjee.'

206
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,414
'Vikram! l am your senior officer,
you can't kill me.'

207
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,821
'Vikram Vikram!'

208
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,086
'Don't take laws in
your hand, Vikram!'

209
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:45,490
'Vikram!'

210
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:48,256
'Havildar Vijay Bahadur.
You can't kill me. No!'

211
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,266
'Naik subedhar Subramaniam.
No.'

212
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,268
'Get out of my way!'

213
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,100
'And Havildar Pavaskar.
No! No!'

214
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,263
'Vikram!'

215
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,380
'The strength of the
army is discipline.'

216
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,048
'And today you have broken it.'

217
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,217
'You will have to face
the conseQuences.'

218
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,057
Somehow, l was trying
to forget the past.

219
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,129
But you have reminded me again.

220
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,065
For you, they were just names.

221
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,797
But for me, they were more
than blood relations.

222
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,809
lt was me who has taught
them everything.

223
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:34,233
lt was because of
their trust in me

224
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:35,470
they entered enemy's territory.

225
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,082
Sheeba Victor and Jani

226
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:46,245
They are alive.

227
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,419
How will you pull the life

228
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,154
if you think everything
through heart, Vikram?

229
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,100
Now, l am also not the same chief.

230
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,173
lt's like a tiger been caught

231
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,432
from the ju ngle and
tamed in a cage.

232
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,275
But in the cage also, the
tiger don't eat grass.

233
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,855
Mehboob Ali, a chicken merchant!

234
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,853
Chicken merchant?

235
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,862
Oh! lt's a wrong card.

236
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,133
Major General Vir Vijay
Singh, Ashok Chakra

237
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,467
Director General of
Revenue lntelligence.

238
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,877
Not only that, l am true
soldier of the cou ntry.

239
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,138
And my name is sufficient

240
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:46,477
to create terror in
the minds of brokers.

241
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,145
Brokers?

242
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,319
This is Dalal street, Vikram.

243
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,487
lndia's financial heart.

244
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,160
From every corner of the cou ntry

245
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:58,886
thousands of crores of
rupees comes and goes.

246
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:04,099
You know that, l recognize
only two kinds of people.

247
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,433
Friend and the other is enemy.

248
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,101
ln this Dalal Street,
friends are those

249
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,938
who are trying their best
to make lndia a super power.

250
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,107
And enemies are those
who are ru nning

251
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,943
a parallel economy
of black marketing

252
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,277
and ruining this cou ntry.

253
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:24,114
Did the story excite you?
Yes.

254
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,120
This is not a story but a true fact
of lndia. And listen more

255
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:32,127
for every black marketing,
there reQuires black money.

256
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,855
And from where this money comes?

257
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:38,134
This is collected by lakhs
of government officers

258
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,864
policemen, political leaders
and u nderworld dons.

259
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:47,138
They steal, take bribes and
do illegal things daily.

260
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,473
lt is not a Question of
principle but of money.

261
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:53,314
They don't u nderstand where
this black money is hidden.

262
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,146
Because that time has gone
when the film stars

263
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,312
used to hide their black money

264
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,548
u nder the tiles of their bathroom.

265
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:04,093
Today, everywhere, you
will get a broker

266
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,095
to ru n the money
on interest basis.

267
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,832
This broker comes u nder
another broker.

268
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:13,098
And above all, there is a big
crocodile who vanishes

269
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,104
, the money as soon as
it goes into his stomach.

270
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:17,930
Did you u nderstand?

271
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,836
Hello, hello, Mangilal.
Mangilal?

272
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,000
Do you want to fix the deal?

273
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,840
Do you want to fix the deal?

274
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,948
Two crores and intrest 2.5percent.

275
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,184
By Diwali, everything
will be settled.

276
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,115
lt's a guarantee of Karimbai.

277
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:32,120
Do you agree and my two percent?

278
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,121
All right, fine.

279
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:37,950
Did you u nderstand anything?

280
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:39,460
No, nothing.

281
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,128
He meant two crores and 2.5%,
the rate of interest.

282
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:48,136
That is five lac rupees,
interest per month.

283
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:55,879
His 2% means that he earned Rs. 5
lac within five minutes on telephone.

284
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,880
ls it? Oh!

285
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,911
And from where this Karimbai came?

286
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,416
There are no written documents
in this business

287
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,487
but reQuires guarantee
for the money.

288
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:07,823
By next Diwali, if he
doesn't get money

289
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,823
his life will be at
Karimbai's gu n point.

290
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:12,424
Money is out and the
man is in hospital.

291
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,830
So, what are you doing to
stop this black marketing?

292
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,826
My lndia is great and

293
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,832
out hu ndred, ninety
nine of them are fraud.

294
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:23,829
There is no sufficient place
in jail to accommodate all.

295
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:28,110
l don't pay attention,
if there is a person

296
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,839
earning from 2 lacs
to 5 lacs in a day.

297
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:35,942
But l don't leave a person who
earns more than one crore.

298
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:40,122
He is about to come, come.

299
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,452
Who is coming?

300
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,855
Yes, l have brought silver
car for you, Chandni.

301
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:47,953
Watch him carefully.

302
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,121
That Mercedes?

303
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,292
lt's for you, only for
you, a new brand!

304
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,461
Did you hear? His name
is Dhiren Gupta.

305
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:57,963
Who is he?

306
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:01,240
Till some months back,
he was a small broker.

307
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,904
And don't know from where
he got these much wealth.

308
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,243
He tries to spend more
than a crore every day.

309
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,153
How is it possible?

310
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,411
This is what you have to find out.

311
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,084
Who is the Kuber and where
the treasure is.

312
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,087
There are thousands of people with.

313
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:18,819
Why do you reQuire me?

314
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,422
l have lost my three men.

315
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,835
And l feel like something
going arou nd.

316
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,428
So, l came to you.

317
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,111
My agent Kulkarni has given
three names, before he died.

318
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:41,112
And first name was of that
crocodile, Dhiren Gupte.

319
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,118
Second one is Suresh
Bal Chandra Shetty.

320
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,124
His forefathers had
left lot of money

321
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:54,855
by selling idlis and dosas. He
has got two degrees with him.

322
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,868
MBA from America, and
Mumbai's hooliganism.

323
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,799
These day's he is operating

324
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,803
twenty five ladies bar
in Ghatkopar area.

325
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,809
His foot is on the earth and
his head is in the sky.

326
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,819
And this is Mr. Ram Tohrani.
He doesn't do any work.

327
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,823
He wakes up at 1 1 .30 am and
eats his breakfast till 2 pm.

328
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,827
After taking bath and all,
he gets ready by 6 pm.

329
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:36,100
And enjoys the parties. He gives
party in his hotel daily.

330
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,103
But chief, l can't
do this job alone.

331
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,279
Come, come.

332
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:47,940
Sit, Vikram.

333
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,279
What would you like to have?

334
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,182
Waiter.
Yes Sir.

335
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,857
Two pizza margarita and two

336
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,117
Some tea for me please.

337
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,521
Then make two teas.
Ok.

338
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:58,951
That will do.
Ok Sir.

339
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,461
Jani.

340
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,060
Victor.

341
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:21,811
l am very big and do
whatever l like.

342
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,416
And how slippery may be the fish

343
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,819
l will catch it by
spreading my nets.

344
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:31,088
l am the favourite of everyone.

345
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,092
Sometimes l am like
cold dew drops

346
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,165
and sometime blazing fire.

347
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:41,828
l, by my will power,
gets everything

348
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,102
l am very clever and
can do anything.

349
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:50,106
And how slippery may be the fish

350
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:52,112
l will catch it by
spreading my nets.

351
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,281
Parcel for Ram Tohrani.

352
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,441
Who is that?

353
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,798
This man changes his clothes,
but never changes his pen.

354
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,233
Search for same kind of pen.

355
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,834
Some of them, are in my front

l will catch it by
spreading my nets.

385
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:08,008
Now we have got deep into the case.

386
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:10,846

Suresh keeps that in his purse.

00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,480
And on that chit also,

You should surely come, baby.

417
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,186
How much time is left?

00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:31,286
1 5 seconds.

419
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:32,444
Go Sheeba.

420
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,450
Don't you have time now?

421
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,121
First time l am keeping the purse.

422
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:42,856
All best.

423
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,300

Bye.

425
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,140
Can't you walk properly?

426
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:58,975
Can't you see?

427
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:01,083
All my lu nch boxes have fallen down.

428
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,240
What?

429
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:06,088
You got a vehicle and so
you will do like this?

430
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,829
Well done, Sheeba.

431
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,264
Are you coming!

432
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,268
Chief, Dhiren talks to Ram
Tohrani daily at 2 o'clock.

433
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,436
Listen carefully how here also

434
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,946
how the numbers
are said by Dhiren.

435
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,184
05 December.

436
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:37,286
Yesterday, you were out on zero,
today it's century.

437
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:39,112
06 December.

438
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:41,280
How far is your farmhouse?
85 km.

439
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,857
0 7 December.

440
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,961
Tell me, how Dhadkan is ru nning?

441
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,858
90% houseful.

442
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,126
Then in the evening at 6 pm,
he talks to Jagdish Mathur.

443
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,295
This is Mr. Jagdish Mathur,
the fourth hidden player.

444
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,463
He is the chairman of
lndian Trust Bank.

445
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,076
Yes, yes Mr. Mathur, how are you?

446
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,237
Chhabile has created
waves yesterday.

447
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:07,406
My job is to serve you, Mr. Mathur.

448
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,812
Meet in the evening.

449
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,411
Ram's job is to search the

450
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:13,817
right person and give them party.

451
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:17,086
ln these parties, girls dances
without having their senses

452
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:20,094
liQuors flow like water
and money like rain.

453
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,091
Then.

454
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,824
Then arou nd 2 pm in the night

455
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,832
Ram Tohrani receives a call.

456
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,096
This phone call is always
a wrong number.

457
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,101
Hello, wrong number.

458
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:41,116
We traced this number
and came to know that

459
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,185
this call comes from lndian
Trust Bank, of Colaba branch.

460
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:45,446
What? At night 2 o'clock?

461
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:49,114
Yes Sir, after this phone, Tohrani
packs up the party

462
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,457
and hugs each other with out
any sense, and goes home.

463
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,861
This is the story of every day.

464
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,803
We have doubts that all secrets
are in these numbers

465
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:05,066
which they say to each other.

466
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:07,399
This is a kind code and

467
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,409
mystery can be solved
by opening it.

468
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:12,404
We were after this for three days

469
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,914
but couldn't get
anything out of it.

470
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,483
Then, Raju got an idea.

471
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:18,086
Yes U ncle, l got doubt
a that both the men

472
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:20,815
read these numbers
from the same book.

473
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,091
And both of them are
having the same book.

474
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:26,088
Sir, it's a typical page number,
line number code.

475
00:34:26,263 --> 00:34:27,252
l see.

476
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:29,159
For example take this dictionary.

477
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,091
And l want to say that the
car is in Flora Fou ntain.

478
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,929
So how will l say it?

479
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:35,835
First of all l will search car.

480
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,103
Here it is, page number
is 1 1 1 , line number 1 6

481
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,177
and words two.

482
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:48,111
So, how will l say it
on phone? 1 1 1 , 1 6, 2.

483
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:51,286
l see, so they are using
first line code.

484
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:52,852
Right Sir.

485
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:55,856
What kind of book is that,
both of them having?

486
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:59,127
To get know this, l made
a computer programme

487
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:02,060
from which l have checked
arou nd five hu ndred books.

488
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:03,221
Then what happened?

489
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,799
U ncle, no results came out.

490
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,399
You know, as there are lacs
of book in this world.

491
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,068
How can we search all?
Then one day

492
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:14,404
Vikram has asked for Prof.
Banerjee's number.

493
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:19,406
So my attention went on to
Mumbai telephone directory.

494
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,077
And hit the jackpot.

495
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,813
So it's a Mumbai telephone
directory.

496
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:25,079
Yes.

497
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:27,084
Well done, Raju, good job.

498
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,085
When the mystery of
code was opened

499
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,248
all the pictures were clear.

500
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,088
What kind of pictures?

501
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,826
The picture of cheating

502
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:35,828
of 1 00 crores from
morning to evening.

503
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,091
ln Mumbai city, daily
ten vehicles carries

504
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:39,826
ten crore rupees cash
to the destinations

505
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:42,437
shown by Suresh Shetty.

506
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,170
Every vehicle has one
driver and a gu nman.

507
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,843
These drivers and gu nman
are changed and

508
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:51,105
the vehicles proceeds on the
direction of Dhiren Gupta.

509
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:53,112
So that they shouldn't know

510
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,944
where money is being taken.

511
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,792
Here, the drivers are being changed.

512
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,055
And these people will reach where

513
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,392
Suresh has been asked to.
See this, Bata, Worli.

514
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:16,398
Look, page no. 41 0, line
no. 1 2, column no. 3.

515
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,905
41 0, 1 2, 3, is that all right?

516
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,065
Then this vehicle reaches

517
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,472
the destination shown
by Dhiren Gupta.

518
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,083
31 5, 45, 4, that is Music
world, Linking road.

519
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,088
But from where this money comes?

520
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,246
From New Delhi?

521
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:35,823
How did you come to know?

522
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,085
Champa.

523
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:48,269
'Buy fish take fish buy fresh
fish fresh fish buy fish.

524
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:51,100
Hey, can't you see?

525
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,175
Sir Sir, l was driving right

526
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:54,833
What is this? You are
teaching us the law!

527
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,172
Show me your license?

528
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,273

Open the dickey.

546
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,912
Where is the vehicle from?

547
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,075
Delhi, Sir.

548
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,243
Why did you come to Mumbai?

549
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,083
l have got small business here, Sir.

550
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,246

And mine.

For license.

559
00:37:57,941 --> 00:37:59,101
Now, l don't have anything,
it's all empty.

560
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,265
Then keep the license and go.

561
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,433
Yes, take this also.

562
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,370
What do with him, Sir?

563
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,373
All right, go away?

564
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,042
Bald fellow, go away.

565
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,209
Ru n!

566
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:13,788
Keep this with you.

567
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:24,061
Take fish from Champa
fresh fish fresh fish.

568
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:27,898
Hey, Champa, what's

569
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:29,060
Fish.

570
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,228
Want to eat?

571
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:31,396
Give me.

572
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,065
Then take.

573
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:35,234
Champa, my darling.

574
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:39,143
So, you people too, have started
taking bribe, isn't it?

575
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:45,245
Sir, if we hadn't taken, then
they would have doubted us.

576
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:48,482
All right, no problem. Deposit
this in government accou nt.

577
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,085
Sir.

578
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,921
l am telling the truth.

579
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,255
One second one second, what's
written in this chit?

580
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,094
Suresh is getting 5% commission
daily, that is

581
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:01,100
Rs. 5 crore daily for delivering

582
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:03,432
the money from Delhi to Mumbai.

583
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:06,175
That is being written in this chit.

584
00:39:07,944 --> 00:39:11,107
Dhiren Gupte is getting 1 0%
because Suresh Shetty

585
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:13,112
should not know where
the money is going.

586
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,440
After all, where this money goes?

587
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,119
After changing the drivers
for the third time

588
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:20,518
Ram Tohrani delivers this
money to lndian Trust Bank.

589
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:22,851
Here the money is cou nted.

590
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:25,854
And finishes it arou nd
night 2 o'clock.

591
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,131
From there Ram receives
a phone and this is

592
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,463
the wrong number by which
Ram learns it's correctness.

593
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:37,138
Next day, arou nd 80 crore rupees

594
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,867
from lndian Trust Bank, in
form of draft of US dollars

595
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,876
is dispatched from lndia.

596
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,143
And reaches euro Swiss bank's

597
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:49,148
secret numbered accou nt
in the name of White Lotus.

598
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:54,150
For this job, Jagdish Mathur
is getting Rs. 5 crore daily.

599
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:58,153
Come on, guys, give me good news.

600
00:39:58,328 --> 00:39:59,886
Who is this White Lotus?

601
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,087
Don't know.

602
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,425
But who is sending this
1 00 crore, from Delhi?

603
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,266
Sir, we are yet to know that.

604
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,498
Meanwhile, one more incident
happened, chief.

605
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,107
'Vikram, where are you?'

606
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:20,841
'l am near Jai Bhavani Lau ndry.'

607
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,118
'Perhaps the bird is
going that side.'

608
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:24,275
'You take over from here.'

609
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,446
'He is my baby now.'

610
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,803
Hi baby, how are you baby?

611
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:44,963
Hai.

612
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,302
Waiting for me for too long.

613
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:47,465
Yes.

614
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:49,134
You looking so sweet and sexy.

615
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:50,870
ls it? Thank you.

616
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:52,207
Let's have some fu n baby!

617
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:53,474
Hi baby!

618
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,146
First there was one, then two

619
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:01,415
now five Romeos are crazy of you.

620
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,085
How?

621
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,258
That is suspense.

622
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:10,098
Sheeba, you go temple's side.
Victor you follow him.

623
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,256
Ok.

624
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:15,427
Come and sit my vehicle.
What? Go away.

625
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,290
The rats have come out of the holes.

626
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,133
Why are you following this girl?

627
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,530
Who are you to ask this?

628
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,959
Move.

629
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:01,075
Come, get up, get up!

630
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:02,479
Get up!

631
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:23,098
Move, move.

632
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:27,107
Get up, speak, who had send you?

633
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,835
Tell, who had send you? Speak.

634
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,848
Speak, or else l will
blow your head.

635
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:36,515
Speak out, who has sent you?

636
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:46,951
Who has sent you?

637
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,121
Or you want to die.

638
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:54,300
Tell! Tell!

639
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,816
We couldn't know who
fired that bullet.

640
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:14,418
l think for sure that, the men
of Suresh Shetty have fired.

641
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:16,215
And if it is so, he must have

642
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,826
closed down his business
by this time.

643
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,100
UP five thousand and six, yes Mr.

644
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,436
The business is still
going on, chief.

645
00:43:34,944 --> 00:43:37,105
Suresh Shetty is not such a fool.

646
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:40,108
l think, he is not at
all aware of this.

647
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:46,116
That means, someone else
is behind this business

648
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:48,849
and wants everything to
be hidden from Suresh.

649
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:55,857
See U ncle, l have prepared a
game of chess on computer.

650
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:57,192
Raju, you have started again!

651
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,867
At least see!

652
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,918
On one side there is black
army and that is of army.

653
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,157
And on the other side is
white army, and it's we.

654
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,828
This is black king, we
will call him Mr. X.

655
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,838
Assume that, he stays in Delhi.

656
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,175
Who can send 1 00 crores
rupees daily?

657
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:43,103
Daily 1 00 crore rupees!
This much big amou nt

658
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,837
can only be sent by
a political leader

659
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:46,948
mafia don or by
a big businessman

660
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,278
who does black marketing.

661
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,854
This is the king of white
army, our cou ntry

662
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,851
and we have to save
him at any cost.

663
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,127
Now see, the game,
the white horses

664
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:02,059
are following the black horses.

665
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,065
And 5 soldiers
of black horses are

666
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,795
following white horses.
All of a sudden

667
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,405
a white horse kicks
one of the black's men.

668
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:14,070
On seeing this, the other
four men in black

669
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,075
kill their own man and ru ns away.

670
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,235
What does it mean?

671
00:45:18,915 --> 00:45:21,076
This means that black
king u nderstood that

672
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,811
minister of whites has
come nearer to his horses

673
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,150
elephants and camels
in a dangerous way.

674
00:45:27,924 --> 00:45:30,085
And in one he can
kill all the three.

675
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:33,828
ln this situation, what
the black king will do?

676
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:35,425
He immediately will inform his men

677
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:36,929
that their lives are in danger.

678
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,431
But here, the game is in reverse.

679
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,091
He himself doesn't want
to save his men.

680
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,427
ln this dangerous situation also

681
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:44,266
he has left them open, why?

682
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:46,841
Why think? Think?

683
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,938
ln a war, only for two reason
soldiers are sacrificed.

684
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:57,118
Either to divert the attention,
so that he can

685
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:01,223
capture the king by cheating
or his plan must have

686
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:04,224
changed and he doesn't
reQuire them any more.

687
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:05,883
You mean

688
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,386
lt means Mr. X doesn't reQuire

689
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,123
Suresh and company, anymore.

690
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:15,228
And Mr. X will not leave these four.

691
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:17,236
He will kill them.

692
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:32,814
Where is Sir? Where is Sir?

693
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:34,417
He is in the balcony?
Who are you? Sir.

694
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,819
He has called us.

695
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:37,152
But, who are you, Sir?

696
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:45,833
Mr. Ram Tohrani, you
are u nder arrest.

697
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:48,431
Vikram.

698
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:50,096
Damn it.

699
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,835
Chief. Come in Chief.

700
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:56,844
l am speaking from Ram
Tohrani's residence.

701
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:58,446
Tell Vikram.

702
00:46:58,948 --> 00:46:59,937
Chief, he is dead.

703
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:02,776
l think he was shot by 8mm rifle

704
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:05,045
from two hu ndred yards away.

705
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,228
He is also dead.

706
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,801
Now two of them are left.

707
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:23,400
Vikram, right now where
is Suresh Shetty?

708
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:24,801
Transmitter.

709
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:34,407
All right, write down, 1 3 7,
1 2, 1 . Ok. DL 3560.

710
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,079
What?

711
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:38,411
Even after two murders

712
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:40,078
business of Suresh
is still ru nning.

713
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:42,087
Doesn't he know that
Dhiren Gupta is dead?

714
00:47:42,258 --> 00:47:44,089
Chief, this may be dummy
calls made by Mr. X

715
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,251
to divert the attention of Shetty.

716
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:49,425
lt means that he will be killed

717
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:50,827
as soon as he reaches lrani hotel.

718
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,095
Only twenty minutes is left, Sir.

719
00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:54,258
He reaches their daily
at 1 2 o'clock.

720
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:55,426
H urry up, Vikram.

721
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,809
Stop, you rascal.

722
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,418
Stop.

723
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,086
Shetty, you stop there.

724
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:00,925
Connect me to Bandra police station.

725
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,432
lt's an emergency, Quick.

726
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:18,119
You rascal, you want money,
thief, you want money.

727
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:20,187
Take, take this!

728
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,117
You want this money, isn't it?

729
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,449
Take it, take it, more.

730
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,288
Take, take, take,
take all the money!

731
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:32,128
Take all the money, and
go away from here!

732
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:35,464
Go away from here! Go away! Go away!

733
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,153
Take this cheQue of
50 lacs. Take it.

734
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,888
lf you kill me, you
won't get the money.

735
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:31,853
Who are you? Get away from here, go!

736
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:00,313
Damn it, shit!

737
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,817
l think he is dead.

738
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:04,420
He is also gone.

739
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:10,421
Vikram.
Yes Sir.

740
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,828
The plan is changed.

741
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:14,761
Go to lndian Trust Bank,
Victor will follow you.

742
00:51:14,937 --> 00:51:15,926
Yes Chief.

743
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:17,433
Driver, take towards lndian
Trust Bank, Quickly.

744
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:22,840
Victor, l want Jagdish Mathur
alive, at any cost. Yes Sir.

745
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:13,918
Stop!

746
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,266
Sheeba, call the ambulance!

747
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,834
Stop there! Stop.

748
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,437
Ambulance!

749
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,856
Sir, we know him very well,
he is a cheap killer.

750
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,864
He takes contract for killing
for Rs. 5000, on phone.

751
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,294
Even if we take him to task,
he doesn't know anything.

752
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:11,079
Four persons have been
killed in one hour.

753
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:14,082
And the enemy is watching
our every move.

754
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:18,086
There is someone between us

755
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,819
giving every details of
our move to the enemy.

756
00:53:22,932 --> 00:53:26,095
But, there is only one man,
other than we four

757
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,830
who know every detail,
of this operation.

758
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,271
l know that.

759
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:36,110
But, why should he do this,
what are his intentions?

760
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,268
What do you mean by intentions?

761
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:38,845
They are being killed.

762
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:42,281
Someone is destroying our clues,
and he is the traitor.

763
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,120
Chief has asked me to follow

764
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:49,122
Shetty's driver and
gu nmen to Delhi.

765
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:58,132
Jani, be careful, take care
of all evidence with you.

766
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,800
And talk only with us on satellite.

767
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:04,236
Vikram.
Yes Chief.

768
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:06,397
l am sending Jani to follow

769
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:07,803
Shetty's driver and
gu nmen to Delhi.

770
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:09,808
Perhaps we may get some
clue of Mr. X from them.

771
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:10,911
Yes, perhaps.

772
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,080
And you coordinate the case
through satellite. Yes Chief.

773
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,409
All the best.

774
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,250
Damn it.

775
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:24,415
All set Victor.
Yes.

776
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:27,088
Hello Sheeba, how are you?
Fine.

777
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,821
l am up linking the satellite

778
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:30,090
and it should start in 1 0 seconds.

779
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,828
Hello, hello, Jani calling,
Victor, please come in.

780
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:37,434
Yes Jani, Victor here. l can here.

781
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,271
The satellite has been up linked.

782
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,431
You can put on your video signal.

783
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:43,503
Yes Victor, the signal is on.

784
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:46,841
He is lean and thin,
medium coloured,.

785
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:48,847
Tshirt and jeans,
height is 5'and 8.

786
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:54,450
ln the morning, l saw the driver

787
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:56,454
getting into the house
of a very rich man.

788
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:59,120
l think, high profiled men
are involved in this.

789
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,058
l have taken all the photos.

790
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,791
Right now l am the man who has
come to meet the driver.

791
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:06,798
l have got strong evidence.

792
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:08,796
Everything will be disclosed
after seeing the photos.

793
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:12,072
Matter has gone very
deep and serious.

794
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,801
Don't say anything more because
this line is not safe.

795
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:17,138
J ust tell us, where
are you right now.

796
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,803
l am in the crematory
centre of Mahroli.

797
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:47,931
What had happened this?

798
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,099
What's happening?

799
00:55:49,945 --> 00:55:51,435
Jani! Jani! What's happening?

800
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:53,947
Speak Jani, Jani come
in! come in, Jani!

801
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:55,105
Jani, what had happened to you?

802
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:56,273
Jani, get out from there!

803
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:57,441
Jani, for God sake, speak something!

804
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,848
Jani, get out from there!

805
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,010
Jani, why are you not speaking?

806
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:01,053
Jani, answer us!

807
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:02,212
Come in, Jani!

808
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:03,380
Jani, get up!

809
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:04,787
Jani, get up! What had
happened to you?

810
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,052
Get up! Jani!

811
00:56:06,228 --> 00:56:08,128
Jani, he is coming back!

812
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:11,061
He is coming back, Jani!

813
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:15,397
He is coming back, Jani, get up!

814
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,067
Jani, answer us!

815
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,804
l l am trying to take the camera.

816
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,810
Jani! Jani!

817
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:37,086
Position the camera upside,
Jani, little more.

818
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:39,159
Jani, come on try, still the
face can't be seen, Jani!

819
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:40,828
Can you see the face now?

820
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,930
Come on, Jani, try!
Lift the camera!

821
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,088
Jani, you can do it!

822
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:45,824
Come on, Jani.

823
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:48,094
Jani, take the gu n!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

824
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,259
Shoot the rascal!

825
00:56:49,438 --> 00:56:50,837
Come on Jani!

826
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:52,837
Come on Jani!

827
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:54,839
Shoot him! Shoot him!

828
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,843
l l can't lift my hands.

829
00:56:58,013 --> 00:56:59,105
Oh shit!

830
00:56:59,281 --> 00:57:01,374
l think his spinal chord
has been broken.

831
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:03,715
We have to get him out from there.

832
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:04,875
lnform Chief.

833
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:06,883
Back up forces and ambulance,
immediately!

834
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,045
H urry up!

835
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,782
National Command Centre
National Command Centre.

836
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,221
Connect me to
Major Veer Vijay Singh?

837
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:12,792
Jani, come out!

838
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,795
lt's an emergency! l repeat
this is an emergency!

839
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,796
Come out Jani! Come out Jani!

840
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,059
Jani get up! Jani!

841
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,395
Jani!

842
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:05,210
Check that side also.

843
00:58:57,933 --> 00:59:00,925
Chief, Jani has been
falsely diverted

844
00:59:01,103 --> 00:59:04,834
to the crematory centre,
by dummy man.

845
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,835
Why only to crematory centre?

846
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:15,108
Because, the body can be easily
buried, after killing.

847
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:20,120
Jain's target was in front,
but the hu nter followed him.

848
00:59:21,957 --> 00:59:26,121
Earlier, l doubted Mumbai's
u nderworld, but now

849
00:59:26,295 --> 00:59:30,129
l am sure only intelligence's
man can do this.

850
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:32,126
Like you !

851
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:42,876
You doubt me!

852
00:59:43,979 --> 00:59:45,879
Jani's death has made you made.

853
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:49,145
Why? Killing this way,
isn't your style?

854
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,440
This is, all because of him.

855
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:30,118
This is not right
to doubt the Chief.

856
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,861
Sheeba is right.

857
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:44,137
Vikram, l have seen so much death

858
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:47,207
of my own people that my tears
have dried up for ever.

859
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:50,311
That's all the difference
between you and me.

860
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:06,857
He is one, former chief
minister and

861
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:09,429
parliamentarian, Mr.
Shyam Manohar Kalia.

862
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,829
Who is the other two with the Kalia?

863
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,839
These are the same gu nman
and driver for which

864
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:21,100
you had sent Jani to follow
them from Mumbai to Delhi.

865
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:26,937
This photo!

866
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:31,283
This photo is of 1 9 7 1 .

867
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,280
The photo of Pakistan's surrender.

868
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:35,946
l am also there, in the photo.

869
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,114
Why Jani has taken this photo?

870
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,299
There should be something in this.

871
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,131
Next.

872
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:51,863
Next.

873
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,133
Next.

874
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:55,867
Next.

875
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,872
To arrest them, you must have

876
01:01:58,046 --> 01:02:00,139
the concurrence of the
government. lsn't it?

877
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:02,816
And you will not get
the concurrence.

878
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:03,974
Am l right, chief?

879
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,081
Once l have got strong evidence

880
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:10,157
l don't reQuire any
body's concurrence.

881
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,829
Brothers, stop, stop,
nothing will happen.

882
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:24,104
Nothing will happen, l

Whose friend?

01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:20,793
Chief, he is suffering
from heart attack.

953
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:22,231
Chief!

954
01:07:25,907 --> 01:07:32,244
Oh shit! He is dead.

955
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:36,906
My God!

956
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:41,087
The death of former chief minister

957
01:07:41,256 --> 01:07:44,248
Mr. Ram Manohar Kalia in
police custody has caused

958
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:47,088
heavy loss on the government.

959
01:07:47,362 --> 01:07:50,092
The chief of revenue intelligence

960
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:52,426
Veer Vijay Singh, is made
responsible for this.

961
01:07:53,935 --> 01:07:56,096
He died of heart attack.

962
01:07:56,938 --> 01:08:00,430
You can see the doctor's report,
if you all wish.

963
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,373
Move now, move back,
move back please.

964
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:05,035
One more Question please

965
01:08:05,213 --> 01:08:07,044
Move a side.

966
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:08,705
Sir one Question

967
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,045
Move back, excuse me.

968
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:14,382
Will you please keep Quite?

969
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,388
Can l answer to the lady?
You can ask.

970
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,384
ls it true that you
have been removed

971
01:08:20,562 --> 01:08:22,052
from the post of chief
of revenue intelligence?

972
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:40,808
l am a loyal servant
of this government.

973
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:47,485
l will serve this cou ntry till the
government asks me to do so.

974
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,256
Thank you, let's go.

975
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,255
You are a killer, and you
will be pu nished for that!

976
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,831
Major General Veer Vijay
Singh is in deep trouble.

977
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:07,270
He will be suspended and
placed u nder arrest.

978
01:09:07,442 --> 01:09:08,932
Forgive us, Sir.

979
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,840
lt was our great mistake
to doubt you.

980
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:19,278
l have come on behalf of
everybody to say sorry.

981
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,116
l don't want anybody's sympathy.

982
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,453
Let's come to the point.

983
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:28,191
Mr. X is still alive.

984
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:32,864
He is the man who has shown
Kalia all the way.

985
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,869
CBl was behind Kalia.

986
01:09:36,571 --> 01:09:38,869
He wanted to send all the
money out of this cou ntry.

987
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:44,872
The main players became friends

988
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:47,879
and Shetty and company
came into the picture.

989
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,151
Their game was going very well.

990
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,479
Now every one is dead
and we have no clue.

991
01:09:56,992 --> 01:10:00,223
We couldn't catch Mr. X, though
we have tried our best.

992
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:03,824
Luck too, plays very fu nny
with human beings.

993
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:07,094
Sometime it goes along with him

994
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,827
and sometimes it against him.

995
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:12,099
Even after the death of Jani,
we got that reel

996
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,174
that was our luck.

997
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,110
Kalia died without disclosing
anything

998
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,440
that was the luck of Mr. X

999
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:24,849
Sir, we can't change luck,
but at least we can fight.

1000
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:27,114
How much time do we have?

1001
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,449
Seven days.

1002
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:31,118
Only seven days?

1003
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,523
Yes, only seven days.

1004
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:35,856
And what if the job is not
done within seven days?

1005
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:46,305
Then l will arrested for killing
Kalia and sent to jail.

1006
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:50,877
We will not let this happen, Sir.

1007
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:58,886
Vikram, Sheeba, Victor,
and Chief, we are a team.

1008
01:11:00,588 --> 01:11:02,078
And we will fight.

1009
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:13,424
Thank you Victor, and
yes we will fight.

1010
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:28,114
Vikram, it's all right.

1011
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,440
lt's all right.

1012
01:11:36,224 --> 01:11:39,455
l want more personal details.
Keep trying.

1013
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:40,950
Morning Victor.
Morning Sir.

1014
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:42,118
Did you get any information?

1015
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,128
Sir, as per your instructions,
l got all the details of

1016
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:46,859
Euro Swiss employees.
Fortu nately, we got

1017
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:49,299
an lndian lady in
New Zealand branch.

1018
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,870
And she is in a very good position.

1019
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,301
That's good news.

1020
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:57,467
l don't think there
will be any benefit.

1021
01:11:57,979 --> 01:12:00,470
The case of Bofor's case is
ru nning since last 1 5 years.

1022
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:03,082
They haven't yet told who
has eaten 50 crore rupees.

1023
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:05,481
And our's is a case of 5000 crore.

1024
01:12:06,187 --> 01:12:08,417
Even if we point gu n on their
head, they will not say.

1025
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:12,819
Yes, but once we have reached here

1026
01:12:12,994 --> 01:12:14,825
we will find some solution.
Moreover, the world is selfish.

1027
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:18,421
From now on, you are the in charge
of this mission. Sir.

1028
01:12:18,933 --> 01:12:21,094
By the way, what's the
name of that girl?

1029
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:22,827
Sir, Sonal, Sonal Joshi.

1030
01:12:23,938 --> 01:12:25,838
Sonal Joshi, Quite pretty.

1031
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:28,100
My name is Sonal and yours.

1032
01:12:28,276 --> 01:12:29,834
Vijay Chau han from London.

1033
01:12:30,211 --> 01:12:32,509
Oh! of course, but why did
you come to New Zealand?

1034
01:12:35,216 --> 01:12:36,513
To flirt with you.

1035
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:42,121
Vikram, why are you joking?

1036
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:45,123
l wanted to be away from my father,
he stays in London

1037
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:48,456
and so l, l can't say all this.

1038
01:12:50,231 --> 01:12:51,858
You should u nderstand the brain
of this modern people.

1039
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:53,022
What should l u nderstand?

1040
01:12:53,234 --> 01:12:54,201
She has come to New Zealand

1041
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:55,859
to say away from her parents.

1042
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:59,131
So l will tell this line to
her and she will hug me

1043
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:01,400
and we will be dancing
arou nd some trees.

1044
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,810
This is what going to
happen, isn't it?

1045
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,147
What do you know about
a woman's heart?

1046
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,810
So why don't you tell me about
woman's heart, teacher.

1047
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,814
Every woman wants true love.

1048
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,084
She goes a long way in
search of that love.

1049
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,827
Sonal has come from England
to New Zealand

1050
01:13:20,995 --> 01:13:22,826
only in search of love.

1051
01:13:22,997 --> 01:13:23,986
How come this happen?

1052
01:13:24,365 --> 01:13:26,833
There might be thousands
of guys who wants this

1053
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:29,265
beautiful, you ng, educated,
girl from a good family.

1054
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,106
The light of love is everywhere

1055
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:36,266
and the one who is
in love is very lucky.

1056
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,848
Vikram, it's not easy
to get true love.

1057
01:13:43,384 --> 01:13:45,852
Sonal's heart is also in dark.

1058
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:49,455
After seeing you, she
should feel that

1059
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:51,455
you are also in search
of true love.

1060
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,286
We should take advantage of this.

1061
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,289
We have to lie a lot
in our business.

1062
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,895
lt's not wrong to tell lie
for the cause of good, Sir!

1063
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:02,796
Did you ever thought

1064
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,802
what will happen to poor Sonal,
after this mission?

1065
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,406
What will happen?

1066
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:09,803
Like others, her heart too,
will be broken.

1067
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,413
What more else can happen than this?

1068
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:17,077
As per the intelligence reports,
every officer of

1069
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:19,083
Euro Swiss Bank, has
a computer micro chip

1070
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,484
through which they can
verify the bank accou nts.

1071
01:14:21,923 --> 01:14:25,825
This microchip looks same as
a sim card of a mobile phone.

1072
01:14:26,194 --> 01:14:27,422
With this, we can know
all the secrets

1073
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:29,256
of Shyam Manohar Kalia's
bank accou nt.

1074
01:14:29,931 --> 01:14:32,832
And yes, this Vijay Chau han
is a person's original name.

1075
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:36,261
He stays in London and his father
is a big business man.

1076
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:39,099
Euro Swiss New Zealand branch
has been told that

1077
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,435
Vijay Chau han is starting
a big business there.

1078
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:43,433
So, they will be waiting for you.

1079
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:45,845
Since, Sonal is the only
lndian working there

1080
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,175
you will be surely
sent to meet her.

1081
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:51,111
These are the passports, case file

1082
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:54,449
and for you, the port
folio of Vijay Chau han.

1083
01:14:56,224 --> 01:14:57,851
Vikram, there are five
stages of our mission

1084
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,288
and only three days
are left with us.

1085
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:01,792
ln this three days, first
you have to introduce

1086
01:15:01,963 --> 01:15:04,397
yourself to Sonal, then
friendship and then love her.

1087
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,225
And through fake love,
you have to find out

1088
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,393
where the sim card
has been hidden.

1089
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:11,798
To obtain the sim card
is the fourth stage.

1090
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:15,068
And fifth is to know

1091
01:15:15,243 --> 01:15:17,803
every secrets of Shyam
Manohar Kalia.

1092
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,807
Clear.
Absolutely.

1093
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:23,247
All the best.
Thank you.

1094
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,079
Best of luck, Sheeba.
Thank you.

1095
01:15:25,253 --> 01:15:26,242
Take care.

1096
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:43,102
The reports of intelligence
are correct.

1097
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:45,831
She stays in Auckland towers
and every morning

1098
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:48,100
arou nd 9 o'clock,
she leaves for bank.

1099
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:56,843
Mic check, mic check, mic check.

1100
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:12,065
Beautiful. Beautiful.

1101
01:16:57,945 --> 01:16:58,934
Excuse me.

1102
01:17:00,214 --> 01:17:02,114
l am Vijay Chau han, lnfoTech
lnternational

1103
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:04,883
Yes, we have been expecting you.

1104
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:06,780
Would you wait here
for a moment please?

1105
01:17:06,954 --> 01:17:08,046
Certainly.
Ok.

1106
01:17:13,494 --> 01:17:14,461
Hello John.

1107
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:19,060
Sonal, Mr. Vijay Chau han is here.
Oh! Ok.

1108
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:20,791
We want his money.

1109
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,069
l will make sure we get
his business. Good.

1110
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,078
That is him.
All right.

1111
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:33,235
Carry on.
Ok.

1112
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:43,157
Hello Mr. Vijay Chau han,
my name is Sonal Joshi.

1113
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:44,814
Ms. Joshi, how do you do?

1114
01:17:44,992 --> 01:17:46,084
l am doing fine, thank you.

1115
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,160
l have heard lot of you.

1116
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,160
Nice things or bad one.
Good one, of course.

1117
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:54,096
You have come for the first
time New Zealand and

1118
01:17:54,268 --> 01:17:57,169
on behalf of my bank, wishes
to invites you for the dinner.

1119
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,503
Wow! Dinner, really.

1120
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,106
So, you have come here
in New Zealand

1121
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:02,367
only in connection
with the business.

1122
01:18:02,877 --> 01:18:06,040
No, actually l wanted to
be away from my father.

1123
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,782
He stays in London
and so l came here.

1124
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:10,208
What a coincidence!

1125
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:12,113
l too, came here for
the same reason.

1126
01:18:12,286 --> 01:18:14,777
Our thinking are very close!

1127
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:17,050
What are you thinking?

1128
01:18:17,892 --> 01:18:20,793
l am surprised by God's creation.

1129
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:22,793
He makes people meet in
u nimaginable situations.

1130
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:24,795
l was also thinking the same thing.

1131
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:39,078
My heart is a star, my
heart is mischievous

1132
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:43,809
my heart is u nconscious
wanderer.

1133
01:18:46,187 --> 01:18:51,090
My heart is, my heart
is mischievous

1134
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:57,164
my heart is u nconscious
wanderer.

1135
01:18:57,932 --> 01:19:03,097
l am not aware of the heart beats,
and is in solitude

1136
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:09,437
and not aware of
your tu ne of love.

1137
01:19:10,211 --> 01:19:15,114
My heart is my heart
is mischievous

1138
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:20,277
my heart is u nconscious
wanderer.

1139
01:19:25,226 --> 01:19:27,456
Sheeba, Victor here.
Yes Victor.

1140
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:30,123
How is our hero's romance going on?

1141
01:19:30,965 --> 01:19:32,296
Stage two completed.

1142
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:34,861
Means, they hands are clasped

1143
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:36,469
and looking into each other's eye.

1144
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:41,132
That's right, that's true, it's
happening something like that.

1145
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:43,466
You keep your eyes opened.

1146
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:45,468
Don't allow him to love faithfully.

1147
01:19:47,248 --> 01:19:51,878
What is love, l learned
from you, dear.

1148
01:19:53,254 --> 01:19:57,884
There is a shadow at every
step and every moment.

1149
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:04,156
l always feel your fragrance,
my dear

1150
01:20:04,932 --> 01:20:10,097
Relation of our hearts
should never be broken

1151
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:13,934
for any reason, today
my life is shining.

1152
01:20:19,213 --> 01:20:24,116
My heart is my heart
is mischevious

1153
01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:29,848
my heart is u nconscious
wanderer.

1154
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:35,861
Victor, Sheeba here.
Hi Sheeba.

1155
01:20:36,964 --> 01:20:39,125
The micro chip which
we are searching

1156
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,461
she wears it like a
necklace in her neck.

1157
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:43,869
Our hero's hand is very long.

1158
01:20:44,972 --> 01:20:46,132
Till now where has it reached.

1159
01:20:49,977 --> 01:20:52,138
Don't be in lose, for
the sake of a necklace.

1160
01:20:52,313 --> 01:20:55,146
l will loose, and then also,
l will be the winner.

1161
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:56,874
Sheeba, take care.

1162
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:06,917
Today is the last day, will you
be able to get the microchip.

1163
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:10,095
l don't know.
But what will you say to her?

1164
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:13,097
Don't know. But you must
have thought of something.

1165
01:21:13,267 --> 01:21:15,827
Nothing.
But Vikram.

1166
01:21:16,003 --> 01:21:17,095
What should l say to her?

1167
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:20,173
l will do what l have to do.

1168
01:21:25,212 --> 01:21:30,115
l don't have any ambition
and complains.

1169
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:36,117
You fulfilled the faith of others.

1170
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:42,123
l came to know very late
that l will not be yours

1171
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:48,201
and my heart is plain
like a plain paper

1172
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:52,862
let the clouds fall
like a rain of love.

1173
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:57,867
How do you feel for me?

1174
01:21:58,245 --> 01:21:59,542
l like you.

1175
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:05,084
That's all, nothing else.

1176
01:22:06,921 --> 01:22:08,411
l like you very much.

1177
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:15,254
l l wanted to tell you
something from my heart.

1178
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:18,828
Meeting you all of
a sudden like this

1179
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,093
is like dream come true.

1180
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:25,832
We know each other only
since last two days.

1181
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:29,509
But l feel like we know each
other since very long.

1182
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:42,850
Perhaps, this is love, isn't it.
Truly, don't you feel like that?

1183
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,118
Should l tell the truth!

1184
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:49,287
The truth is, l am not
Vijay, l am Vikram.

1185
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:50,953
l have come here

1186
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,292
for an important work
of lndian lntelligence.

1187
01:22:52,466 --> 01:22:53,865
Vikram, don't be a fool.

1188
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:56,869
You are putting this
mission in danger.

1189
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,138
Vikram, Vikram, don't do like this.

1190
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:00,466
You are joking.

1191
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:02,802
Don't do this. Vikram, Vikram!

1192
01:23:04,912 --> 01:23:06,812
This is not a joke.

1193
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,144
Vikram.

1194
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:21,822
Second truth is that, l am
fed up of telling lies.

1195
01:23:24,932 --> 01:23:26,832
You are very beautiful, Sonal.

1196
01:23:27,935 --> 01:23:30,495
You are very innocent and wonderful.

1197
01:23:30,938 --> 01:23:32,838
But l don't love you.

1198
01:23:35,943 --> 01:23:37,843
Fu n of two days, is not about love.

1199
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:46,277
Love is like a wall, which is
made up of bricks of sacrifice.

1200
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:53,125
And l can break the heart
that has made the wall.

1201
01:23:58,232 --> 01:24:04,068
And the last truth is that, l
have not come here for you

1202
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:11,076
but only for this, for
this computer microchip.

1203
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:16,081
For this? What do you expect?

1204
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:18,248
Do you want to rob the bank?

1205
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,083
No, a corrupted politician from
our cou ntry has hidden

1206
01:24:23,257 --> 01:24:25,817
Rs.5000 crore in your bank
accou nt. We arrested him

1207
01:24:25,993 --> 01:24:28,826
but the money was transferred

1208
01:24:28,996 --> 01:24:32,090
and before he could
tell anything

1209
01:24:32,266 --> 01:24:36,100
the politician died
of heart failure.

1210
01:24:37,204 --> 01:24:41,106
lf such a big amou nt goes
into the hands of enemy

1211
01:24:41,275 --> 01:24:44,438
this could be very dangerous
for this cou ntry.

1212
01:24:54,221 --> 01:24:58,123
When l measured your heart
against my cou ntry

1213
01:24:58,292 --> 01:25:02,058
in my mind's scale, l fou nd
you heart is very light.

1214
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:05,792
But today l u nderstood that

1215
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:07,797
every person is important
to every heart.

1216
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,798
And nobody can be measure
in like this.

1217
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:15,068
l am sorry, Sonal.

1218
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,071
Today, l broke your heart.

1219
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:22,144
But after knowing you, l was
forced to tell the truth.

1220
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:27,081
By God's promise, what
l have said today

1221
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:30,155
is nothing else, but only true.

1222
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,417
Goodbye, Sonal.

1223
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:41,828
Vijay, l mean Vikram.

1224
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:50,109
Take this, with this card,
from any computer

1225
01:25:50,277 --> 01:25:52,438
you can find the secrets
of any accou nt.

1226
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,107
Bank opens at 1 0 o'clock.

1227
01:25:54,281 --> 01:25:56,841
Return this card to
me with in one hour.

1228
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,845
Otherwise the bank will
have doubt on me.

1229
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,448
Sonal.

1230
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:07,059
Even l have measured with
the scales in my heart

1231
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:10,061
with life of Sonal and
lndia and fou nd that

1232
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:12,791
life of Sonal is very light
against lndia. All the best.

1233
01:26:30,918 --> 01:26:32,408
Why did you put the
mission in danger?

1234
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:35,149
Because l couldn't
tell any more lies.

1235
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,110
l love you Sheeba.

1236
01:27:16,163 --> 01:27:22,068
l love you and only
loves you, Sheeba,

1237
01:27:55,502 --> 01:27:57,299
Chief Vikram.
Tell Vikram.

1238
01:27:57,504 --> 01:27:58,801
We got all the details of money.

1239
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:00,399
There was Rs.51 00 crores in

1240
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:01,734
Shyam Manohar Kalia's accou nt.

1241
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,666
From that 1 00 crore rupees

1242
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:05,072
has been transferred
to Meer Jafar's accou nt.

1243
01:28:05,245 --> 01:28:06,678
Meer Jafar?

1244
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:09,513
You mean, that terrorist?
Yes Sir.

1245
01:28:09,683 --> 01:28:11,082
This is a very bad news.

1246
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:14,512
There is more bad news.
What, tell?

1247
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:18,420
Rs.5000 crore has gone into
some Kala Khanjar's accou nt.

1248
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:21,093
Chief, who is this Kala Khanjar?

1249
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:23,692
l knew it.
But Chief.

1250
01:28:23,864 --> 01:28:26,094
l knew it.
Who is this Kala Khanjar?

1251
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:32,701
Kala Khanjar is one of the biggest
terrorist organisations.

1252
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,370
And helps all other
deadly terrorist

1253
01:28:36,543 --> 01:28:39,444
arou nd the world to
spread terrorism.

1254
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:46,118
Tell me, what made you come here?

1255
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,387
Minister, you will have to
spend some time for me.

1256
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,117
Now through internet

1257
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:53,122
we are reaching the
web site of lnterpol.

1258
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:59,131
This is Kala khanjar.

1259
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:03,465
One among the world's most
wanted terrorist group.

1260
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:07,139
lndia is surrou nded by terrorism
from all the sides.

1261
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,739
And our army men are fighting
bravely, since many years.

1262
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:14,140
They why should be afraid
of this Kala Khanjar.

1263
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:18,411
We should be afraid of.

1264
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:25,419
As per the reports
from the lnterpol

1265
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:29,153
Kala Khanjar not only
has deadly weapons

1266
01:29:29,329 --> 01:29:33,425
but also has a nuclear bomb.
And, the bomb has been

1267
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,161
priced by this group
for Rs. 5000 crore.

1268
01:29:37,871 --> 01:29:39,600
From where did they
get the nuclear bomb?

1269
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,442
Ten years before, when the
old soviet u nion broke

1270
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:47,171
lots of these kind of nuclear
bombs were missing.

1271
01:29:47,714 --> 01:29:50,444
And one of those bombs
now this group has.

1272
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,782
Now this bomb has been sold out.

1273
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:58,781
Look, it's not there in
list of Kala Khanjar.

1274
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:10,395
From Shyam Manohar Kalia's
secret Swiss accou nt

1275
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:13,131
Rs. 5000 crore has
been transferred

1276
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:16,572
to the accou nt of Kala Khanjar.

1277
01:30:16,743 --> 01:30:19,405
And from the same accou nt
Rs. 1 00 crore

1278
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,481
has been transferred
to Meer Jafar's accou nt.

1279
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:26,413
From this it is clear
that, this bomb

1280
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:29,750
has been purchased to
ruin and destroy lndia.

1281
01:30:30,524 --> 01:30:34,426
And now, somehow Meer Jafar,
will smuggle

1282
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:38,156
this bomb into lndia, and may be

1283
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:42,496
he must have brought
in, by this time.

1284
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,431
Oh my God! Who has done all this?

1285
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,431
We have asked the same Question

1286
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,599
to late Shyam Manohar
Kalia. Listen.

1287
01:30:50,544 --> 01:30:52,774
You have transferred to
somebody's accou nt.

1288
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:54,504
Tell, in whose accou nt
you have transferred.

1289
01:30:55,282 --> 01:30:58,774
No, l take oath of my children
that l am not aware of this.

1290
01:30:59,286 --> 01:31:00,514
You are telling lie. Tell.

1291
01:31:00,687 --> 01:31:01,711
All that l have earned
in my whole life

1292
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:03,117
he has taken away. He

1293
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:05,121
Who! Tell! Who is he?

1294
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:07,123
Friend.
Which friend?

1295
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:12,391
Who could be the best
of Shyam Manohar Kalia?

1296
01:31:12,566 --> 01:31:14,227
l can ask this Question even to you.

1297
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:15,390
What do you mean?

1298
01:31:15,569 --> 01:31:18,402
l mean, wearing this white clothes

1299
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:22,133
doing black marketing,
people's representative

1300
01:31:22,309 --> 01:31:25,745
tried to hide people's
money in foreign cou ntry.

1301
01:31:26,513 --> 01:31:29,414
Now the money has gone into
the hands of the enemy and

1302
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:32,575
today the same money is being
used to destroy lndia.

1303
01:31:34,521 --> 01:31:37,581
Whatever is earned by doing
sins, will go in sin.

1304
01:31:38,525 --> 01:31:41,585
But the sinner is some one and
the public has to suffer.

1305
01:31:44,264 --> 01:31:46,425
Who could be the friend of Kalia

1306
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,591
and enemy of this cou ntry.

1307
01:31:50,537 --> 01:31:52,437
lt could be any one of you.

1308
01:31:53,707 --> 01:31:55,766
Weren't you Kalia's friend?

1309
01:31:56,543 --> 01:32:00,172
Veer Vijay Singh, this is not
time to remove the skin.

1310
01:32:01,481 --> 01:32:06,111
l agree that most of the
politician is corrupted.

1311
01:32:07,487 --> 01:32:11,116
For the downfall of the ruling
party, we could do anything.

1312
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:18,130
But no politician can
betray his cou ntry.

1313
01:32:18,298 --> 01:32:19,731
Veer Vijay Singh, you are given

1314
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:21,561
the responsibility of National
Security Command.

1315
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:26,730
All charges against you will be
void. Government is with you.

1316
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:34,139
Ok Sir, ok.

1317
01:32:43,857 --> 01:32:47,156
Hold on, why did Jani
take this photo?

1318
01:32:48,528 --> 01:32:50,758
Perhaps he was trying
to show something.

1319
01:32:51,531 --> 01:32:54,432
Because, we fou nd this photograph

1320
01:32:54,601 --> 01:32:57,092
in Kalia's drawing room, when
we searched his house

1321
01:32:57,271 --> 01:32:58,260
l see.

1322
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:05,536
What is on the right
side of the frame?

1323
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,114
Perhaps, it's some one's shoulder.

1324
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:12,384
Sir, it's Quite possible
that Jani was trying

1325
01:33:12,552 --> 01:33:15,112
to take his photograph, but
the camera was out focused.

1326
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:20,392
lf there is someone in front
of the photograph

1327
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,118
then the shadow of that
person must be there

1328
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:24,230
on the glass of the photo frame.

1329
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:27,393
Through computer can you focus it?

1330
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:29,725
Let me try Sir.

1331
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:39,411
Someone's face is there.

1332
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,409
Make little sharper the focus.
Yes Sir.

1333
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,420
Who is this?

1334
01:34:02,202 --> 01:34:06,536
How could this be?
lt's not possible.

1335
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:10,705
He was already dead.
Who Sir?

1336
01:34:11,211 --> 01:34:15,113
Kalia's friend, Dost Khan.

1337
01:34:20,487 --> 01:34:24,389
l met Dost Khan for the first
time during the war of 1 9 7 1 .

1338
01:34:26,226 --> 01:34:27,716
We won the war.

1339
01:34:28,495 --> 01:34:32,795
But the Question was when
and where to surrender.

1340
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:38,398
'Lieutenant Veer Vijay Singh,
tomorrow you have to meet'

1341
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:42,133
'Lieutenant Dost Khan of Baluch
Rifles at 1 1 o'clock.'

1342
01:34:42,509 --> 01:34:46,411
'He will be holding white
flag. Tell the enemy'

1343
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:49,413
'that if he doesn't surrender
within 24 hours'

1344
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:52,484
'then there will be no soldiers
left alive to surrender.'

1345
01:34:52,652 --> 01:34:54,142
'Any doubt.
No Sir.'

1346
01:35:23,483 --> 01:35:27,112
'What do you want? Peace or war.'

1347
01:35:29,489 --> 01:35:34,222
'l wish to slit the throat of
every lndian and throw away.'

1348
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:38,129
'But my coward general
is begging for peace.'

1349
01:35:39,232 --> 01:35:41,723
'Then you will have to surrender
within 24 hours.'

1350
01:35:42,235 --> 01:35:45,568
'Do you agree? Your silence
says that you have agreed.'

1351
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,402
'Let the army surrender! But
Dost Khan, in this life'

1352
01:35:51,578 --> 01:35:56,743
'will never surrender
to any lndian.'

1353
01:35:57,517 --> 01:35:59,485
'Remember that.
All the best, lieutenant Khan.'

1354
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,351
Then what happened, Sir?

1355
01:36:05,792 --> 01:36:09,353
The day 1 6th December, 1 9 7 1 ,
is a very important day

1356
01:36:09,529 --> 01:36:13,363
in world history. Look
at this photograph.

1357
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,192
This is a famous picture
of surrender.

1358
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:18,700
l am there in it and also Dost Khan.

1359
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:26,111
You are listening news
read by Ashok Verma.

1360
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:31,378
ln the war between lndia
and Pakistan

1361
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:34,543
Pakistan has surrendered to lndia.

1362
01:36:35,655 --> 01:36:39,557
On behalf of lndia, Major General
Jagjit Singh Arora

1363
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:43,390
and General Niyaazi
from Pakistan

1364
01:36:43,563 --> 01:36:46,726
has signed the surrender papers.

1365
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:51,403
At the cost of arou nd of three
thousand lndian soldiers

1366
01:36:51,571 --> 01:36:54,734
new map of Bangladesh, is created.

1367
01:37:02,182 --> 01:37:04,343
After the surrender, Pakistan
totally collapsed.

1368
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:05,676
The army officers of Pakistan

1369
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:07,342
wanted to take revenge
at any cost.

1370
01:37:07,787 --> 01:37:11,689
And Dost Khan was erupting
like a volcano.

1371
01:37:12,459 --> 01:37:16,520
Whether it's Hindu or Muslim,
treat every lndian as enemy!

1372
01:37:16,796 --> 01:37:18,354
An lndian's name should be written

1373
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:20,523
on every bullet of yours.

1374
01:37:21,201 --> 01:37:24,364
He was working in Pakistan's
embassy

1375
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:26,369
for five years in Delhi.
During this period

1376
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,531
he made friendship with the
corrupted politician, in lndia.

1377
01:37:29,209 --> 01:37:32,372
He opened and intelligence network

1378
01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:34,707
in Mumbai and Delhi.
Look at this footage.

1379
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:42,387
A 'lftaar' party is going
on in Pakistan embassy.

1380
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:43,784
Watch carefully.

1381
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:57,129
What should l tell you
about Pakistan's army?

1382
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:01,338
After the surrender of Bangladesh

1383
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:04,068
our soldiers were made
prisoners in lndian jail.

1384
01:38:05,445 --> 01:38:09,074
The hands in which once
there used to gu ns

1385
01:38:09,249 --> 01:38:12,412
were carrying baskets
made up of mud.

1386
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:18,349
Our soldiers have become Sadak
chap in the process of

1387
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:21,685
preparing the road
from Delhi to Meerut.

1388
01:38:23,296 --> 01:38:27,357
Have you seen the result
of surrendering

1389
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:31,095
it is worse than
slitting the head.

1390
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:33,371
Why Dost Khan wasn't arrested

1391
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,098
even after having
solid information?

1392
01:38:36,209 --> 01:38:39,110
No one from the embassy's
can be arrested, like this.

1393
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,381
And so, he was deported
from lndia

1394
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:46,118
but he became lSl
chief in Pakistan.

1395
01:38:47,487 --> 01:38:50,115
lmmediately joining
this organization

1396
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:52,121
he started spreading terrorism

1397
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:55,386
badly in Pu njab and KashMeer.
Meanwhile in Pakistan

1398
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:58,122
army came into power.
As per our information

1399
01:38:59,232 --> 01:39:00,722
he was killed in jail itself,
thinking that

1400
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,458
he belongs to Nawas
Sherif's group.

1401
01:39:03,503 --> 01:39:06,131
And so, after that,
we closed his file.

1402
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:10,141
This Meer Jafar, salutes Dost Khan.

1403
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:13,405
You are five minutes late.

1404
01:39:19,252 --> 01:39:21,152
Don't repeat this.

1405
01:39:26,259 --> 01:39:29,422
And second thing, your
irresponsibility

1406
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:32,429
could make lose to our mission.

1407
01:39:34,267 --> 01:39:37,498
The lndian army is one step
behind, in this area.

1408
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:39,434
lrresponsibility?

1409
01:39:40,273 --> 01:39:41,604
Use disguise!

1410
01:39:42,275 --> 01:39:44,436
like this a small kid
can also identify you.

1411
01:39:44,711 --> 01:39:48,169
l will try, l am not a
getup expert, like you.

1412
01:39:48,348 --> 01:39:50,509
No one will recognize you.

1413
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:53,444
You are right. After escaping
from Pakistan Jail

1414
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:57,181
l have changed my figure
so many times that

1415
01:39:57,357 --> 01:40:01,384
l don't even remember
my original face.

1416
01:40:07,233 --> 01:40:12,398
l don't remember anything,
my home, and relatives.

1417
01:40:13,673 --> 01:40:18,474
l don't know anything, and
if l knew something then

1418
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:25,414
it is my aim, and
save my commu nity.

1419
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:47,171
Come in, u nit four.

1420
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,433
The bride has reached
point four, over.

1421
01:40:49,876 --> 01:40:51,605
Well done, over and out.

1422
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,445
Ahmed's u nit has brought the
bride to point four, now

1423
01:40:59,619 --> 01:41:02,110
it's your u nit's responsibility
to bring the bride to point five.

1424
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:04,116
How much time it will take?
36 hours.

1425
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:07,384
The next 36 hours is very
important for us.

1426
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,719
Get ready the attack team.
Target.

1427
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:15,395
There is one officer in lndian
army, and his way of thinking

1428
01:41:15,568 --> 01:41:18,469
matches with that of mine.

1429
01:41:18,838 --> 01:41:22,399
He is Veer Vijay Singh,
eliminate him.

1430
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:34,152
Sir, we are being followed.
Yes Sir.

1431
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:37,581
Good, l was waiting for the same.

1432
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:42,427
l am the prey, and myself
is the hu nter, cover me.

1433
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,158
Stop firing, l want him alive!

1434
01:43:05,478 --> 01:43:06,536
Driver! Bring the vehicle.

1435
01:43:09,215 --> 01:43:10,705
My name is lrfan.

1436
01:43:11,217 --> 01:43:14,550
l want the name of the man
who has sent you. No.

1437
01:43:21,494 --> 01:43:23,553
Tell the name.
No.

1438
01:43:25,498 --> 01:43:32,404
Tell the name.
No.

1439
01:43:35,508 --> 01:43:38,136
Tell the name, you rascal!

1440
01:43:49,522 --> 01:43:51,422
lt's of no use.

1441
01:43:52,258 --> 01:43:53,748
They will give their life, but
will not open the mouth.

1442
01:43:55,528 --> 01:43:58,258
l think we should use
the other method.

1443
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:00,760
How time it will take?

1444
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:04,101
Four hours.
Let's go.

1445
01:44:37,503 --> 01:44:40,563
Make it fast as the effect of the
injection will not last long.

1446
01:44:42,508 --> 01:44:45,409
Tilt down the light on top,
yes down, down.

1447
01:44:57,523 --> 01:45:00,424
Now you are looking like Meer Jafar.

1448
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:08,094
lt's matching 7 0%, the rest
30% depends on your talent.

1449
01:45:09,202 --> 01:45:10,692
That you leave it to me.

1450
01:45:12,205 --> 01:45:13,695
We will make lrfan sit here.

1451
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:17,705
When he comes to sense, he
will be having this view.

1452
01:45:19,212 --> 01:45:20,372
Nice.

1453
01:45:20,546 --> 01:45:22,377
He has lost the power to think and

1454
01:45:22,548 --> 01:45:24,709
will only believe what
he is able to see.

1455
01:45:25,218 --> 01:45:27,550
And the truth is that he
has tried to escape

1456
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,119
and that was the last thing,
in his memory, right.

1457
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:31,457
Correct, now what will you tell him?

1458
01:45:32,225 --> 01:45:34,386
That he has succeeded in
escaping and right now

1459
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,460
he is with Meer Jafar, in the
headQuarters' of Afghanistan.

1460
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,128
He is coming to his sense,
is everything ready?

1461
01:45:43,302 --> 01:45:45,133
Yes, everything is ready,
come, let's go.

1462
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:52,405
Ok everybody, all soldiers,
go and hide.

1463
01:45:52,578 --> 01:45:54,739
Militants, take your positions.

1464
01:46:27,213 --> 01:46:28,703
Supreme commander!

1465
01:46:29,482 --> 01:46:32,383
You have succeeded in
escaping from enemy.

1466
01:46:33,219 --> 01:46:36,450
But you are still injured
and needs to rest.

1467
01:46:37,223 --> 01:46:39,384
They have caught me
supreme commander

1468
01:46:39,559 --> 01:46:40,719
but l didn't disclose anything.

1469
01:46:41,494 --> 01:46:45,396
Very good, but u nfortu nately
all your colleagues

1470
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:49,399
have been killed, but
l have recruited

1471
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:53,403
new army of brave men, right.

1472
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:55,564
Yes, you are right.

1473
01:46:59,245 --> 01:47:04,080
Help your brave soldiers,
and give the reports.

1474
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:07,351
l knew that nuclear weapon
has already reached lndia.

1475
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:15,518
Stupid! Not like this,
speak likd a soldier.

1476
01:47:16,462 --> 01:47:18,692
When did the nuclear
weapon reach lndia?

1477
01:47:18,865 --> 01:47:20,355
On 1 2th December.
Where?

1478
01:47:20,533 --> 01:47:23,696
ln Vasai village, near Mumbai.
Now where it is?

1479
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:26,370
Ahmed's men will be
bringing it to Delhi.

1480
01:47:26,539 --> 01:47:30,100
When will it reach Delhi?
On 1 6th December. Shit!

1481
01:47:35,481 --> 01:47:37,381
Tomorrow is 1 6th December,
that means

1482
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:39,711
the weapon will be reaching
Delhi, tomorrow

1483
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:42,380
Ask him Victor, it's where in Delhi.

1484
01:47:42,555 --> 01:47:43,715
Where in Delhi?

1485
01:47:44,223 --> 01:47:48,125
That l don't know, Dost
Khan will receive it.

1486
01:47:49,228 --> 01:47:52,391
And after that, l was to execute
as per his orders.

1487
01:47:53,232 --> 01:47:54,722
You are very courageous, lrfan.

1488
01:47:55,234 --> 01:47:58,726
After this war, you will also
be promoted. ls it true?

1489
01:48:05,444 --> 01:48:06,672
1 6th December!

1490
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:10,513
Sir, welcome to National
Security Command.

1491
01:48:10,683 --> 01:48:13,345
Thank you, are we u nder the grou nd.
Yes.

1492
01:48:13,519 --> 01:48:14,679
Come Vikram.

1493
01:48:15,188 --> 01:48:17,088
We are so below the grou nd that

1494
01:48:17,256 --> 01:48:19,019
even nuclear explosion
can't affect us.

1495
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:21,353
From this centre we can reach

1496
01:48:21,527 --> 01:48:23,085
any corner of the world, through
lndian spy satellite.

1497
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:28,100
Sir.

1498
01:48:28,267 --> 01:48:30,360
Victor.
Vikram.

1499
01:48:30,536 --> 01:48:31,525
What's the progress?

1500
01:48:31,704 --> 01:48:34,104
Sir, we have sealed all the
antipoints in the city.

1501
01:48:34,473 --> 01:48:36,100
We are watching every
vehicle carefully.

1502
01:48:36,475 --> 01:48:39,103
More than ten thousand forces
are being deployed for this.

1503
01:48:39,645 --> 01:48:42,375
Sir, there is a 3D map of
Delhi on this screen

1504
01:48:42,548 --> 01:48:44,379
through which you can
see live picture

1505
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:46,108
of any part of the city.
l see.

1506
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,720
What's happening on this screen?

1507
01:48:58,898 --> 01:49:00,388
Tell the position of the satellite.

1508
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:04,567
Sir, right now our spy satellite
is near an American sea.

1509
01:49:06,505 --> 01:49:09,133
Why in America? The
problem is in Delhi.

1510
01:49:09,508 --> 01:49:10,566
Focus it immediately on Delhi.

1511
01:49:10,743 --> 01:49:12,734
Right Sir, initiate command change.

1512
01:49:13,246 --> 01:49:15,146
Bring satellite to ZX1 .
Yes Sir.

1513
01:49:28,527 --> 01:49:30,427
Victor, on which screen are
the images of lndia Gate?

1514
01:49:30,596 --> 01:49:32,154
On screen number four, Sir.

1515
01:49:32,331 --> 01:49:35,425
Get us lndia Gate, please.

1516
01:49:47,546 --> 01:49:49,173
Sir, G.K Gupta reporting
from lndia Gate.

1517
01:49:49,548 --> 01:49:51,607
We are detecting everything
with the metal detector.

1518
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:53,445
Weapon is yet to be fou nd, Sir.

1519
01:49:53,619 --> 01:49:56,452
Keep searching and stay alert.
Yes Sir!

1520
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:59,190
Technology is very impressive,
Chief.

1521
01:50:00,559 --> 01:50:02,390
But as we know that
the nuclear missile

1522
01:50:02,561 --> 01:50:05,394
has been brought in to the city

1523
01:50:05,564 --> 01:50:07,555
we have to find some other
way to locate it. How?

1524
01:50:08,234 --> 01:50:11,135
There is an army of more
than one lakh people

1525
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:13,397
and they can locate the places

1526
01:50:13,572 --> 01:50:15,563
where we can never reach.

1527
01:50:16,509 --> 01:50:18,739
Army? You are talking of which army.

1528
01:50:20,513 --> 01:50:22,413
Remove the straps. Come out.
Sir, as per the orders

1529
01:50:22,581 --> 01:50:25,141
l have brought the
leaders of beggars.

1530
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:26,746
Come, come.
Come.

1531
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:39,590
Watch it very carefully, the
images shown on the screen.

1532
01:50:40,533 --> 01:50:43,434
Sheeba, explain to them.
Sir.

1533
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:48,166
We are looking for a cylinder
which is pointed from the

1534
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:52,170
front side. lt is six feet long,
two feet in breadth

1535
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:55,837
and weighs arou nd the
weight of two persons.

1536
01:50:57,717 --> 01:51:00,185
The front side is deep
orange in colour and

1537
01:51:00,553 --> 01:51:02,384
the colour of the cylinder
is military green.

1538
01:51:03,222 --> 01:51:05,452
On top it's marked in
Russian language

1539
01:51:05,624 --> 01:51:09,390
in English it's C C CP.
On top of the cylinder

1540
01:51:09,562 --> 01:51:13,726
there is a meter to fix the
time, exactly like this.

1541
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,731
And, a sou nd comes out of
it, listen carefully.

1542
01:51:18,237 --> 01:51:19,397
Look look

1543
01:51:19,572 --> 01:51:21,130
Raju, keep Quite.

1544
01:51:25,244 --> 01:51:27,474
We have called you to search it out.

1545
01:51:30,249 --> 01:51:32,149
The bride is coming
within a short time.

1546
01:51:32,518 --> 01:51:36,750
This is remote device.
Good, on time.

1547
01:51:38,524 --> 01:51:42,153
Bring the bride to old bu ngalow.

1548
01:52:03,215 --> 01:52:07,117
l am Dost Khan speaking.
Confirm my voiceprint.

1549
01:52:10,222 --> 01:52:12,213
l want an exclusive voice command.

1550
01:52:13,225 --> 01:52:15,386
Only command of my
voice should work.

1551
01:52:20,232 --> 01:52:21,460
Move Biz!

1552
01:52:22,501 --> 01:52:24,128
Easy, easy, bring it.

1553
01:52:26,505 --> 01:52:28,405
Keep it slowly. The drape
should not be removed

1554
01:52:28,574 --> 01:52:30,735
from the face of the bride.

1555
01:52:31,243 --> 01:52:33,404
Slowly slowly keep it slowly.

1556
01:52:34,246 --> 01:52:35,577
l have told you to

1557
01:52:49,528 --> 01:52:52,258
Don't you know that
how pu nctual l am?

1558
01:52:54,533 --> 01:53:00,494
Today, after 30 years, the time

1559
01:53:01,474 --> 01:53:05,535
and you wanted to let
this opportu nity go away.

1560
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:09,380
Open this, open it!

1561
01:53:36,509 --> 01:53:38,136
Good, thank you.

1562
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:52,753

01:54:18,217 --> 01:54:19,707
Thank you.

1567
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:21,379
Be careful.

1568
01:54:28,227 --> 01:54:35,395
My bride will go to her
inlaws in this, today.

1569
01:54:39,238 --> 01:54:43,140
Because of this cover, no
satellite can detect this.

1570
01:54:43,509 --> 01:54:45,136
Sir, l reporting from old bu ngalow.

1571
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:48,412
A child has seen the nuclear
bomb. Over Sir.

01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:52,143

1573
01:54:52,318 --> 01:54:54,582
send that child with someone
here, to the headQuarters.

1574
01:54:54,753 --> 01:54:57,153
Right Sir.

1575
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:03,087

01:55:03,262 --> 01:55:05,696
What have you seen? Tell me.

1577
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:09,099
Chief, leave this child
to me for some time.

1578
01:55:09,468 --> 01:55:11,527
He will be frightened
of interrogation.

1579
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:13,103
Please carry on.
Thank you, Sir.

1580
01:55:13,272 --> 01:55:14,364

Look, l have not come

1586
01:55:33,559 --> 01:55:38,394
but to win and for that
it is necessary to know

1587
01:55:38,564 --> 01:55:41,556
what the opponent is doing.
Come on boys, come on.

1588
01:55:43,502 --> 01:55:48,405
Let the officers check all the
items and do their duty.

1589
01:55:49,241 --> 01:55:51,141
Let the police do their duty.

1590
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:52,743
What is this? Big box?

1591
01:55:53,245 --> 01:55:56,146
Why is it so heavy? Open
this and show me.

1592
01:55:59,852 --> 01:56:02,343
There are plenty of buttons, why?

1593

Time to go, let's go.

1615

01:58:38,477 --> 01:58:40,104
l too, wanted to become a spy.

1625
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:44,381
lt's not easy to become a spy.
Spy could see everything.

1626
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:47,551
He u nderstands everything
and never forgets anything.

1627
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:51,382
l too, could see, u nderstands
and never forgets anything.

1628
01:58:51,557 --> 01:58:54,390
ls it so? Then look,

1629
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:57,128
What is this? Rocket ice cream!

1630
01:58:57,496 --> 01:58:59,555
Correct, and who was eating it?

1631
01:59:00,232 --> 01:59:02,723
That beard person.
Beard person.

1632
01:59:04,236 --> 01:59:06,727
Was it this one.
Yes.

1633
01:59:09,241 --> 01:59:10,731
But one more guy was there.

1634
01:59:11,243 --> 01:59:13,404
This is the other one, like vulture.

1635
01:59:15,514 --> 01:59:19,473
l knew this already, so
what's new in spy Pappu.

1636
01:59:19,852 --> 01:59:24,414
Spy Pappu has seen that
vulture slapped that

1637
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:28,583
beard fellow and said that
don't you know that

1638
01:59:32,264 --> 01:59:40,501
how pu nctual l am.

1639
01:59:42,541 --> 01:59:43,769
Pu nctual?
Yes.

1640
01:59:48,547 --> 01:59:51,175
Today, after 30 years, the time
has come for taking revenge

1641
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:53,784
and you wanted to let
go this opportu nity.

1642
01:59:53,952 --> 01:59:55,442
And then what happened?

1643
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:56,610
Oh my God!

1644
01:59:57,556 --> 02:00:00,787
All stations red alert.
lnitiating Sir.

1645
02:00:03,495 --> 02:00:05,122
What happened? What's
going on Chief?

1646
02:00:05,497 --> 02:00:07,124
Dost Khan will explode
the bomb, today itself.

1647
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:11,128
Exactly after one hour and
twenty five minutes.

1648
02:00:29,521 --> 02:00:35,153
l am thankful to all of you,
for giving support to me.

1649
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:42,432
You will have sufficient time
to move out of Delhi

1650
02:00:42,601 --> 02:00:45,593
as the blasting is
after eighteen hours.

1651
02:00:45,771 --> 02:00:46,829
Why are you saying this?

1652
02:00:47,539 --> 02:00:50,167
Because today is Viajy Divas,
1 6th December.

1653
02:00:51,543 --> 02:00:54,603
Before 30 years, exactly
on this day, at 1 1 .50

1654
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,612
Pakistan has signed the
paper of surrender.

1655
02:00:59,284 --> 02:01:02,117
They will explode the bomb
exactly at 1 1 .50, because

1656
02:01:02,487 --> 02:01:04,455
he is very pu nctual of time, and

1657
02:01:05,223 --> 02:01:07,123
this is time of
taking his revenge.

1658
02:01:08,226 --> 02:01:10,717
We have got the time, but
we do not know the place!

1659
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:14,458
Where has he hidden the bomb?

1660
02:01:16,234 --> 02:01:18,566
Search! Search!
Sir.

1661
02:01:21,506 --> 02:01:23,406
Excuse me, Mr Agnihotri, when
will you be participating

1662
02:01:23,575 --> 02:01:25,133
in this part of the competition

1663
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:26,402
now or in the evening?

1664
02:01:26,578 --> 02:01:27,806
Who will be seeing the evening?

1665
02:01:29,247 --> 02:01:33,411
l will fulfil all the ambition now.

1666
02:01:33,585 --> 02:01:37,146
lt's arou nd 30 minutes that
Dost Khan has gone

1667
02:01:37,689 --> 02:01:39,748
out of old bu ngalow. At the
most, he must have 1 0 kms

1668
02:01:40,525 --> 02:01:44,757
We have find if he has gone
inside the city or outside.

1669
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:48,431
Sir, if Dost Khan wants
to explode the bomb

1670
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:51,160
in one hour and twenty minutes
and his aim is to

1671
02:01:51,336 --> 02:01:54,169
destroy whole Delhi then he
will have to explode it

1672
02:01:54,339 --> 02:01:56,603
in this area. And this has
to be the epic centre.

1673
02:02:02,481 --> 02:02:04,108
What do you think, Victor?

1674
02:02:04,483 --> 02:02:07,714
Sir, this man is neither
afraid of death nor us.

1675
02:02:09,221 --> 02:02:11,121
He will take whole Delhi,
along with him.

1676
02:02:12,224 --> 02:02:14,385
Focus the satellite
on the epic centre

1677
02:02:14,559 --> 02:02:15,719
and check the radiation.
Yes Sir.

1678
02:02:17,496 --> 02:02:19,726
Can the level of radiation be
checked through satellite?

1679
02:02:21,233 --> 02:02:22,723
lt's not easy.

1680
02:02:23,502 --> 02:02:26,232
But if the cover of the weapon
is opened, it's possible.

1681
02:02:56,535 --> 02:02:58,765
Sir, the satellite is detecting
the radiation.

1682
02:03:02,474 --> 02:03:05,443
This is coming from lnstitute
of music and fine arts.

1683
02:03:07,212 --> 02:03:09,112
No men of ours will be in u niform.

1684
02:03:09,481 --> 02:03:12,712
Enemy shouldn't know that we
are following him. Let's go.

1685
02:03:21,493 --> 02:03:25,395
This is, Dost Khan,
recognize my voice.

1686
02:03:30,502 --> 02:03:32,561
l want to change the time
of farewell of the bride.

1687
02:03:41,513 --> 02:03:42,741
One hour and twenty minutes.

1688
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:57,251
Did you vacate the first floor
of the building? Yes Sir.

1689
02:03:58,263 --> 02:04:01,198
Take all the exit points u nder
your control. Ok Sir.

1690
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,100
No black cat commando

1691
02:04:04,269 --> 02:04:05,361
should come out with out
my orders. Right Sir.

1692
02:04:06,204 --> 02:04:07,694
Be absolutely normal, no
should have any doubt.

1693
02:04:07,873 --> 02:04:09,101
Yes Sir.

1694
02:04:09,274 --> 02:04:10,366
Raju, you wait in the vehicle.
Ok.

1695
02:04:10,542 --> 02:04:12,772
Let's go.
Yes Sir.

1696
02:04:30,495 --> 02:04:33,123
Chief, look at the stage.

1697
02:05:05,463 --> 02:05:07,693
Stay alert and keep me covered.

1698
02:05:09,201 --> 02:05:10,691
He has got remote triggered device

1699
02:05:10,869 --> 02:05:13,099
which can blast in seconds,
let's shoot him now.

1700
02:05:13,271 --> 02:05:18,106
No, he must be alive, till
the bomb is defused.

1701
02:05:18,476 --> 02:05:20,444
His men must be there all arou nd.

1702
02:05:20,612 --> 02:05:22,102
We will have to finish them first.

1703
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,539
And that too, without
letting know any one

1704
02:05:24,716 --> 02:05:26,377
otherwise the men of Dost
Khan will start firing

1705
02:05:26,551 --> 02:05:29,111
on the crowd and he blast
the bomb in this confusion.

1706
02:05:29,287 --> 02:05:30,447
Yes, you are right.

1707
02:05:50,242 --> 02:05:51,732
Could you identify?

1708
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:54,410
Yes, no one can escape

1709
02:05:54,579 --> 02:05:56,740
with the transmitter
having this freQuency.

1710
02:05:58,250 --> 02:05:59,239
Signal identified.

1711
02:05:59,517 --> 02:06:02,350
Jam his transmitter,
so that neither

1712
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:05,080
he receives any call
nor could he make any.

1713
02:06:08,193 --> 02:06:09,353
Transmitter jammed.

1714
02:06:12,197 --> 02:06:15,530
Everything is ready?
Yes Sir.

1715
02:06:17,469 --> 02:06:19,699
We have to win.
Jai hind.

1716
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:29,538
Victor, twenty degree, northeast.

1717
02:06:30,482 --> 02:06:35,545
Blue trousers, shirts with white
dots, got it. Got it Sir.

02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:40,720

target three seconds.

02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:53,570
Targeted sighted.

Get ready to shoot.

1721
02:07:02,180 --> 02:07:04,341
Three, two, one.

1722
02:07:07,185 --> 02:07:08,675
Story ends, come.
