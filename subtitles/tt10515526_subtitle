1
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,880
Never before had anyone felt
such ecstasy at a public urinal

2
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
as Nandan did that fateful night.

3
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
For the last time...

4
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
whose bag is this?

5
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,320
A few days ago.

6
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,840
Hey, you!

7
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Hat fellow!
Come here.

8
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,640
Yes... you.

9
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,480
What's so funny?

10
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,280
Sir...

11
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,320
Er... you are Don Jameel, aren't you?

12
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,960
Yeah, why?

13
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,280
See? I told you.
This is Don Jameel.

14
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
Hold on a second.

15
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,640
Did you also own two Mercedes' before this?

16
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,680
And sported a royal moustache?

17
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Yeah... so?

18
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,880
This is you, isn't it?

19
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Yeah... from ten years ago!

20
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,880
Where did you find this?

21
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,400
That's when the can of worms opened.

22
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,080
Had Jameel not died,
there'd be no story to tell.

23
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Thus the circle of life
keeps the jungle alive.

24
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,720
After a lazy day, this crocodile
is ravenously hungry.

25
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,120
Bala, the shooters
are unknown hired guns.

26
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,720
But it was Omar's boys
that put the contract on Don Jameel.

27
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,880
Bala, let's kill Omar
in his own back yard.

28
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Just like every criminal
has an animal inside,

29
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,480
every animal has a criminal inside, too.
At least, according to Don Bala.

30
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,080
-Rajan.
-Yes, boss.

31
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,160
The time has come for you to become
a Crocodilus Noctilus.

32
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
What?

33
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
Observe.

34
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,320
Crocodilus aka Crocodile.

35
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,760
King of the African rivers.

36
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
That's you.

37
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,000
-Me?
-Yes.

38
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,520
And that...

39
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,640
Aepyceros Melampus... meaning deer.

40
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,520
That's Omar.

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,440
Look, how he's sneaking
into our territory.

42
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,520
The scoundrel has Legislator Patil
for a Godfather.

43
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
But, we'll nail him.

44
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,640
The innocent deer just wants
to quench his thirst

45
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,240
and is oblivious
of the lurking danger.

46
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,240
Even the deer can't escape
the cycle of life and death.

47
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,760
That's how Omar's story will end.

48
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,400
Damn right, boss.
Perfect time to inaugurate my new gun.

49
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,400
-Graduate... got yourself a new gun?
-Yes, boss.

50
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,120
Got yourself a Nat Geo subscription?

51
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,640
Nat Geo?

52
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,280
Evidently not.

53
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
Learn from nature.

54
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,160
It's a jungle out there.

55
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
And in the jungle we all gotta stay alert!

56
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,280
Bala Rathod! Heard of him?

57
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,280
Think he'll take it lying down?

58
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,840
Jameel wasn't to be killed now.
Hadn't I made it clear?

59
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,040
Have you lost your marbles?

60
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,360
Omar, I'm sorry.

61
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,720
"Omar, I'm sorry."

62
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
Don Omar and Abdul have
a give and take relationship.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,280
Abdul takes a wrong decision
and Omar gives it back.

64
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,880
Abdul, you moron, if you weren't
my brother-in-law, I'd kill you.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Moron!

66
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,640
What are you doing?

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,200
Counting the number of times
I called you a moron?

68
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,320
Sister's told me to count up to 10
when I get angry.

69
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,120
Oh, you are angry?

70
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Moron, what am I gonna tell Patil?
Elections are around the corner.

71
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,200
Patil sahab, please...
But isn't Housing your portfolio?

72
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,840
Word is you've subsidised land deals
for your Minister friends in Delhi.

73
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,080
Please explain.

74
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,600
I got two words for you.

75
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Next question.

76
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,080
Meet the super boss, Legislator Patil.
The Big Daddy of this world.

77
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,080
Minister Tripathi.

78
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,520
But Daddy has a Daddy too!

79
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,040
Yes, Tripathi-ji.
Order, sir.

80
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,280
Some legislators are coming home
to explore a new friendship.

81
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
Yes.

82
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,280
I need 10 boxes of sweets delivered...

83
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,840
Of course. They'll be there, sir.

84
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
Perfect... and the parcel?

85
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,680
Sir, Subhash will personally
deliver it in a few days.

86
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,880
Fine.

87
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,880
Sir, the party workers are on steroids...

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,920
-Sure, I'll talk to you later.
-And... Victory to India, sir.

89
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
I think the network's bad.

90
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,240
And far, far away
from this network coverage of crime

91
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,360
is our common man, Nandan,
clueless about that world.

92
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,800
Aayush, do your homework on time.

93
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,160
Don't you want to be smart
like your papa?

94
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,560
Papa, 14 times 3 is?

95
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
14 times 3...

96
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Actually, Nandan Kumar
is generally clueless.

97
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,040
42, write that down.

98
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,920
I was just going to say that.

99
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,520
We're out of sugar.

100
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,760
And we need an extra gas cylinder.

101
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,000
And next Saturday, you are taking me
to the water park too.

102
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,760
We'll go, boss!
Finish your homework first.

103
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,240
Wear your shirt,
drink your milk, quick!

104
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,120
Water park? My foot.

105
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,880
Just like the 'Snow peak vacation
in Shimla'?

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
At least, don't make
false promises to your child.

107
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
False promise?

108
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
I see, have we ever gone to Shimla?

109
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,360
I wanted to visit a snow peak,
not skin snow peas.

110
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,040
Shimla, my foot!

111
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,840
I even knitted a sweater,
it's gathering dust.

112
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,720
I told you to start a side business
for some extra income.

113
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
But, no!

114
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,520
You won't do it,
nor will you allow me to do it!

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,760
What business?

116
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,000
Didn't Jaya offer a partnership
in her pickle business?

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,240
It'll cost only 80,000.

118
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
She's going to get you
in a pickle worth 80,000!

119
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,320
Pickles and pappadums.

120
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,880
Seriously. There's high demand for it.
I'll quit my job.

121
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,400
Lata, where's 80,000
going to come from?

122
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
Now we are talking.

123
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,960
If you don't give sister Binu money
for six months... that's where.

124
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,360
What a miserable life!

125
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
Must we drag sister Binu
into everything? She's...

126
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
-I have to plan everything myself...
-Ramlal-ji!

127
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,120
Pack lunch... drop Aayush off.

128
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,880
It's Ramlal-ji.
Please come in.

129
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,240
I came to drop off my house keys.

130
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,680
Oh, the keys.

131
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,600
Please come in.
Have a cup of tea?

132
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,600
We're out of sugar.

133
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,480
Papa, I know things have been
a bit tight of late.

134
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,240
But, that doesn't mean you cancel
my water park trip.

135
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,560
Get lost! Get ready for school.

136
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Patil sahab is here.

137
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Up.

138
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
-Salaam, Patil sahab.
-Omar.

139
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
Carry on. I'll finish this meeting.

140
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,840
Patil sahab, an honest mistake...
we messed it up with Jameel.

141
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,520
-I had told the boys...
-Omar... Omar.

142
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
Omar, did I ask?

143
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,160
Jameel was destined to die.
Good thing, he died!

144
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
Subhash, protein shake.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,280
Wonderful.

146
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Tell me, when did you last go to jail?

147
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,320
Patil sahab?

148
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,480
What happened?

149
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,040
You thought, I was going to
send you to jail?

150
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,760
For killing Jameel?

151
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,200
This is my biggest problem.

152
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,200
People always misunderstand me.

153
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,880
I should just keep quiet.
No... I'm not going to talk. I...

154
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
Please forgive me.
I'll take an oath of silence.

155
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,960
-Sorry, Patil sahab.
-I'll not utter a word.

156
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,120
Sir, I didn't misunderstand you.

157
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,200
You?

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,880
Why would I send you to jail?

159
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Look, if I scratch your back
in Jameel's matter, won't you scratch mine?

160
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
Won't you?

161
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
We must help each other.

162
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,840
Take Tripathi-ji for instance.
The Resource Minister.

163
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,320
He wants my help, too.
He wants something delivered.

164
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,520
He told me,
"Patil, deliver it personally."

165
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,200
You tell me, should I?

166
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,320
Should I?

167
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
See that, Subhash?

168
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,000
He'd rather deliver it himself,
than put me through the trouble.

169
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Who, me?

170
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,160
What do I have to do?

171
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,480
It's simple.

172
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,760
Subhash will give you
a suitcase day after tomorrow.

173
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
It's got a 100 million.

174
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,600
All you gotta do is take it safely
to Tripathi-ji's personal assistant.

175
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,760
Can you do that?

176
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,480
Of course.

177
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Started?

178
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,520
Yes!

179
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,000
Well done, Nandan, well done!

180
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,200
You're a strong contender for
'The Kirodimal Employee of the Year' award.

181
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,520
Thank you.

182
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,120
Keep up the good work,
day and night.

183
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,400
That reminds me, I need you to work
the night-shift the next two days.

184
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,080
Be on time.
Good boy.

185
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,640
Vasant Seth... what a man!

186
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,600
First, he praises you to the skies
then crash lands you into slavery.

187
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,360
Goodnight, in advance.

188
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,120
He wants me to do a double shift
on Monday and Tuesday.

189
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,760
Damn, night shifts.

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,320
All that ever changes is our shifts,
not our destiny.

191
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,360
It's not that we can't make big bucks,
like these politicians.

192
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,720
Seriously.

193
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,440
We've got the talent.
And needless to say, the nerve, too.

194
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,080
But, what holds us back?

195
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,360
Our values.

196
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,640
These values come in the way.

197
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,360
Who'll break the news to the wife?
Vasant Seth?

198
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,120
Noodles.

199
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,840
Fried Rice.

200
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,640
And two Manchow soups
split three ways.

201
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,200
Enjoy!

202
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
Where's the dessert?

203
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,640
You want it mixed with the noodles?
Finish this first.

204
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,280
I'm just letting you know.

205
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,960
Fine! Eat your noodles.

206
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,320
When do you start night duty?

207
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,720
Night duty?

208
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,120
What are you saying?

209
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,320
It's either night duty,
or your sister needs money.

210
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,120
To what do we owe this Chinese feast?

211
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,600
Which is it?

212
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
Night duty.

213
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,160
At least, this way we got to eat out.

214
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,800
It was good.

215
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,320
It'll all be good from now on.

216
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,480
I'll have my own printing press.
You'll have a pickle business.

217
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,800
We'll holiday in Manali, Shimla...
Just say where you want to go?

218
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,400
For now, let's just go home.

219
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
By the way, when is the night duty?

220
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,880
Actually, tomorrow and day after.

221
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,120
But, if you like... I can start tonight.

222
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,560
-Hey!
-What?

223
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,320
-Listen...
-Aayush will wake up.

224
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,160
Let him.

225
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,440
All it takes is Chinese food
to put you in the mood.

226
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,880
You're looking as hot as Schezwan rice.

227
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,800
Have you been smoking?

228
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,800
No.

229
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,480
Go away, liar!

230
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,400
Not so fast!
My chicken hakka noodles.

231
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,680
It's Holy vegetarian day!

232
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,400
Fine... vegetarian noodles!

233
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,480
Liar!
What else?

234
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,920
One bowl of Manchow soup, to share.

235
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,680
To share?

236
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,040
Must we share in your fantasy, too?

237
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,640
Sharing is caring, baby.

238
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,440
Fine.

239
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,360
Rajan, your time to be a crocodile
has arrived.

240
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,200
We've got a tip.

241
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,480
Omar's going to drop off
Patil's 100 million to Tripathi.

242
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,360
You'll ambush him mid-way.

243
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,080
The loot is ours,
and who gets framed?

244
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,760
Omar.

245
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,280
But, Omar has gone underground.

246
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
Underground?

247
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
The rascal is trying to be
a Lumbricus Terrestris.

248
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,560
You still haven't subscribed
to Nat Geo?

249
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,880
Graduate had informed the cable guy.

250
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,560
-Boss, I told him...
-Shut up and listen.

251
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,160
Lumbricus Terrestris... aka...

252
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,680
Aka?

253
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,720
Aka...

254
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,400
-Ah! Aka...
-Aka...

255
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,920
Aka... earthworm.

256
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,880
Earthworm.

257
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,920
This species is found underground.

258
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,680
But, when it rains,
they inevitably surface.

259
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,640
Omar too, shall surface

260
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,480
when 100 million rains down.

261
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,120
Be ready.

262
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,480
We are!

263
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
Very ready!

264
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,400
Ready.

265
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,960
Aayush, did you find this eraser
or did you steal it?

266
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,120
Aayush, I'll ask you again.
Did you find it or steal it?

267
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,320
It was on Deeksha's bench.

268
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Did you ask her for it?

269
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,760
-No.
-That's called stealing.

270
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,800
-What's all this ruckus?
-Ask God's forgiveness.

271
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,080
-Sorry...
-Never again!

272
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,480
He's just a child. Let him be.

273
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,480
That's why I'm teaching him now.
Apologise!

274
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,440
-Sorry. Never again.
-Say it again.

275
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,080
Mukesh, money's a bit tight.

276
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
How about, I give it next week?

277
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,040
Great.

278
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,280
Thank you.
Next week for sure.

279
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,640
Didn't you get your salary?

280
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,600
Then why didn't you pay
Mukesh the rent?

281
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,040
-I...
-Where did the money go?

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,760
I see... gave it to your sister.

283
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
-Listen to me.
-What's left to listen?

284
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,160
We barely make ends meet
and you dole out charity like this?

285
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,760
That's why you took us out for Chinese!

286
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,720
Your son is learning to lie from you.

287
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,160
That's nonsense!

288
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,960
It's either your way or the highway!

289
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,520
-Who listens to me in this house?
-What rubbish!

290
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,360
Always your word against mine.

291
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,080
Your word is the final word.
And my word?

292
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
In this war of words,
what is the weight of my words?

293
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,720
Quarter kilo.

294
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,920
Lentils

295
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
and kidney beans

296
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,440
chilly, sugar, coriander

297
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,920
and a pack of safety pins.

298
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,880
Madam, my salary?

299
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,560
Salary? We have no money
for your salary, Balu.

300
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,000
But, I'm sure we can treat you
to Chinese food instead.

301
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,800
Ramlal-ji!
Please come.

302
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,320
-Dropping off my house keys.
-Yes, keys.

303
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,640
I'm going to my home-town for 15 days.
Will spend time with family.

304
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,560
And I don't want tea.

305
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,760
Perfect! All our tea cups are broken.

306
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,240
What's with you? One day there's no sugar,
another day it's shattered cups.

307
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
My destiny is shattered!

308
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,000
We were seriously out of sugar.
Did you get it yesterday?

309
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,800
The promises you made before marriage!

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,120
"One day, I'll lay the moon
and the stars at your feet!"

311
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,960
I've been asking for an extra gas cylinder.
Did you get it?

312
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,000
No... you're right.

313
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,000
Before marriage I should've told you,

314
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,320
"My love, one day I shall lay
an extra gas cylinder at your feet."

315
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,440
Ready?

316
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,000
Ready... switch it on.

317
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes, ready?

318
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,880
-Omar, ready?
-Ready!

319
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,400
Ready?

320
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,600
Ready.

321
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,960
For the last time... whose bag is it?

322
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,000
Sir, where to?
Domestic or international?

323
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,920
I don't need a ride... go on.

324
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,720
Wait!

325
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,760
Sir, hope there's no body inside?

326
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,720
Of course, there's no money inside.
Let's go.

327
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,120
So, where to?

328
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,760
Azad Nagar... close to it.

329
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
-Azad Nagar?
-Close to it.

330
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,320
And you wanted to drag this heavy suitcase
all the way to Azad Nagar?

331
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
Of course not.
That's why I hired a rickshaw.

332
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,160
Are you from Azad Nagar?

333
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,520
Close to it. No...
Will you just drive?

334
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,240
Hello, brother.

335
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,960
Yes, I've finally reached Mumbai.

336
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes... I'll explain.

337
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,680
My taxi had broken down.
So I hired a rickshaw.

338
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,920
Now, I'm heading towards Azad Nagar...
Close to it.

339
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
As we all know,
my friend stays there. Not me.

340
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Obviously, I've stuffed the suitcase
with clothes.

341
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Clothes, clothes and more clothes.

342
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,080
Yeah.

343
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,400
And... I'm going to stay there
just for tonight.

344
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,640
Just for tonight.

345
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,440
And tomorrow,
I head to sister Binu's place.

346
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,120
Because, as you know
I don't live here.

347
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,520
And after tonight, I don't intend
to go back there. Ever.

348
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,920
Never ever!

349
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,640
Bye, brother.

350
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,480
Stop, stop... you've overshot.
I had to get off earlier.

351
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,440
You've got me way ahead.

352
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,720
This is way ahead.

353
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
Keep this.

354
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
Should I come back in the morning?

355
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,960
To drop you to sister Binu's house?

356
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,200
Today's menu... saucy, home-made Chinese.

357
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,200
Manchurian-Lung-Fung Rice.

358
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,880
Eat all you want.

359
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,600
Where's Aayush?

360
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,880
Sent off to sister Binu's house.

361
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,000
Are you still upset?

362
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,280
Okay, I apologise for the morning fight.

363
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,320
No, no... I'm not upset.

364
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,640
It's just... I've got acidity.

365
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,240
Won't be able to eat...
Chinese tonight.

366
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,480
Not tonight... sweetheart!

367
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,440
For the acidity.

368
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,560
Oh.

369
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,640
What were you doing outside?

370
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,080
I...

371
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,480
Smoking again?

372
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,240
Yes, smoking.

373
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,440
I can't smell anything.

374
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,000
That's ridiculous!

375
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,680
When I don't smoke,
you say I do.

376
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,520
And when I do,
you don't believe me!

377
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,880
How's that fair?
You're looking sexy.

378
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,320
Very sexy... Manchow...

379
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,480
Liar!
What else?

380
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,320
Today isn't a holy day, is it?

381
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,680
So, chicken noodles and super spicy.

382
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,240
How did this happen?

383
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,000
Tell me from the beginning.
From the very beginning.

384
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,360
Patil sahab, as planned,
we left with the suitcase.

385
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,840
At Pipe Road Junction a car rammed into us
and our way got

386
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,680
Blocked... in a way that Omar was trapped.

387
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,760
Keep talking.

388
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
At first I thought
it was an accident.

389
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,800
But when I saw two gun-toting men,
I figured it was an ambush.

390
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,000
They demanded the suitcase.

391
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
-Give me the suitcase.
-What suitcase?

392
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,960
We had no choice.

393
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,360
Get the bag out!

394
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
That's when I signalled Vignesh.

395
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,480
Make it quick.

396
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,880
Then, for self-defence
I knocked Omar in the head.

397
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,440
Suddenly, a third guy jumped
out of the car

398
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,640
and started firing at us
like a lunatic.

399
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,080
Bullets were flying on both sides.

400
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,480
All of a sudden...

401
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,440
Police!

402
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,160
We had the cops on one side,
and a dead Kamraj on the other.

403
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,440
His foot was jammed on the accelerator.

404
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,120
The car moved forward
as we struggled to stay with it.

405
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,320
We struggled hard.

406
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,320
David tried but couldn't stop the car.

407
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,680
-Move!
-We had to get away

408
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,840
before the cops
could catch us with guns.

409
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,800
The bag was way too heavy.

410
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,400
We had to avoid the cops.
We had nowhere to run.

411
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,520
Thought we'd hide the bag
and come back for it in an hour.

412
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,880
We went back
but didn't find the suitcase.

413
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,320
So, what did you find?

414
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,560
Where's the rest of the suitcase?

415
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,480
Where were you?

416
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,640
I've been searching for you.

417
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
All my life.

418
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Go away.
I'm not talking to you!

419
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,360
Bala, I'm asking you,
give it to me straight.

420
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Give it to you straight?

421
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,560
How dare you, Chameleon Calyptratus
of Madagascar?

422
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,560
Hello?

423
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,400
You chameleon!

424
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,960
Changed colours so quickly?

425
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,080
I want answers.

426
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,080
About Jameel's murder.

427
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,040
Bala, I know it was your boys that
ambushed us and grabbed the 100 million.

428
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,640
Ambush?

429
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,280
And 100 million?

430
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,480
What fool trusted you
with so much cash?

431
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,840
And here's the deal, kid.

432
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,840
Even if I had your money,
I would never return it.

433
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,800
Do what you want.

434
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,080
Jameel's life is worth
much more than 100 million.

435
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,680
Congratulations! That went well.

436
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,480
Tell me something.
Why will Bala do this?

437
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,840
Let's say he did it.
Why would he own up?

438
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,880
Patil sahab, give me two days.
I have a strong suspicion on Bala.

439
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,640
I have a strong suspicion on you, too.
Morons! Can't get anything right.

440
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,120
Subhash, before Tripathi starts
frothing with rage

441
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,400
go deliver the file to his assistant.

442
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,120
File? You said it was a parcel.

443
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,400
The parcel had the file.
Now, scram!

444
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,400
Omar, can you give this parcel
to Tripathi-ji's assistant?

445
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,920
Or, I'll have to go all the way
just to drop it off.

446
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,000
Don...

447
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,920
-Don...
-What?

448
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,640
Where do I put this parcel?

449
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,160
Shove it in the bag.

450
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,640
The file went with the suitcase?

451
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,040
Do you even know what's in the file?

452
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,520
Subhash! What have you done?

453
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,640
Have you completely lost it?

454
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,760
I'll re-open all your cases.

455
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,800
Bring me that file!
Bring it back to me.

456
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,040
-I will find it and get it back...
-Get out of here. Out!

457
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,200
Get out.

458
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
Out!

459
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,680
Get out of here.

460
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:21,200
Rajan, now I want that suitcase,
no matter what!

461
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,280
You're like joy packed in a red bag.

462
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,040
What shall I call you?

463
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040
Joy... Bagman.

464
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,320
Yes! Joy Bagman... my best friend.

465
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,680
Subhash, 25 years ago
we came here empty-handed

466
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,080
we'll go back the same way,
and be farmers.

467
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,320
Do you know what's in that file?

468
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,880
The paper trail of the land deals
we swindled for Tripathi-ji's trust.

469
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,120
The number of farmers we got rid of...

470
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,120
Elections are round the corner.

471
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,200
If that file comes into the public domain,
we're done for.

472
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,880
Sir, if I had the slightest idea...

473
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,640
You're a Minister's PA.
Not a rookie.

474
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,240
Couldn't you ask me?

475
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,720
It's Tripathi-ji!

476
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,400
Tell him.

477
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,000
Yes, sir. Namaste!

478
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,520
-Patil.
-Order, sir.

479
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,720
-The box of sweets never landed up.
-There was a bit of a mix up, sir.

480
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,360
But, don't worry.
You'll have them by end of day.

481
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,240
And the file?

482
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,320
Patil?

483
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,160
A couple of signatures are pending.

484
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,920
You'll have it by the end of the week.
Rest assured.

485
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,240
And sir, for the upcoming rally...

486
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,280
-Let's just have the file, pronto!
-Yes, sir.

487
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,720
Where's Kolte?

488
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,440
How are you, Mushtaq?
Aka Salim, aka Sandeep.

489
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,440
Hello, ma'am!

490
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,080
Won't you offer us some tea?

491
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,080
What did you think?

492
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,400
That you'd change identities
and I cannot hunt you down?

493
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,400
Thirsty, are you?

494
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,240
Well, have some.

495
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,440
Luckily, we found him here.

496
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,320
Sir, what are you doing?

497
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,840
This, is luck.

498
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,800
That, my friend, is one month
of hard work. Got it?

499
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,600
Now, wrap up the paper work.

500
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,280
Patil sahab, Victory to India!

501
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,640
Kolte, where are you?
Couldn't reach you.

502
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,280
Yes, I was a tad busy.
How are you, sir?

503
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,600
-What are you doing tonight?
-Patil sahab, I...

504
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,240
I was just being courteous.
I don't care.

505
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,760
-Come tonight.
-Yes, sir. Victory to India.

506
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,000
The CBI raided the offices
of Corporator Yadunath Sawle.

507
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,560
He was rumoured to be close to
a notorious gangster.

508
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,920
Hello.

509
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,960
You didn't tell me.

510
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,920
What?

511
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
What you should have told me?

512
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,920
What?

513
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,280
I love you.

514
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,240
-Oh, that...
-Tell me now.

515
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,280
Last night at 2 am, a shoot-out
was reported at Pipe Road Junction.

516
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,360
-Hello?
-I love you... love you.

517
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,560
The police have begun investigations.

518
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,120
They are looking for evidence.

519
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,960
The CCTV footage
will reveal everything!

520
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,320
If they had it,
they'd have shown it, right?

521
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,520
Nandan, now let's say you've done this.

522
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,800
Me?

523
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,120
Just assume that you did.

524
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,960
If you were responsible.

525
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,520
If they blabber about the CCTV footage
on the news, won't you leave town?

526
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,120
Such things are never revealed
on the news.

527
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,960
They missed noting down
the license plate.

528
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,000
That would have been futile.

529
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,400
Routinely, they use stolen cars
in such cases.

530
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,200
I was told it was
a random shootout, sir.

531
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,080
That's perfect.
Let's just sell that.

532
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,320
That's the official version.

533
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,880
You just have to do
one unofficial thing.

534
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,720
Find me the suitcase.

535
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,960
Suitcase?

536
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,520
Why?

537
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,000
Sir, it's been over eight hours.

538
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,920
The suitcase must've left
the State by now.

539
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,200
It's tough, sir.
Almost impossible.

540
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,720
See that, Subhash.

541
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,800
That's what I call experience.

542
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
I like it!

543
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,160
Kolte is the final word
on such matters.

544
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,800
You should drop by sometimes.
All okay at home?

545
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,240
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

546
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,040
Tell me... how tough is it really?

547
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,120
Tougher than stopping your transfer
to Bhoomarbavdi?

548
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,800
Or tougher than shielding you
in the Majid Rana fake encounter case?

549
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,600
Fine, sir... no worries.
I'll find the suitcase.

550
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,400
Hey! Did you think
I was threatening you?

551
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,920
You thought that, didn't you?

552
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,400
It was just for comparison.

553
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,440
Subhash, this is my problem.
I speak and people misunderstand me.

554
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,800
I shouldn't say anything at all.
I should just be quiet.

555
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,160
No, sir. I'll find it.

556
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,720
Now when he is so determined,
who am I to stop him?

557
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:32,440
One more thing. There's a file,
with some personal, important documents.

558
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,880
My wife is emotionally attached to them.

559
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,440
Will you get that as well?

560
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,760
Yes, sir.

561
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,000
Here's the deal, Faizu.

562
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,440
We just have to find the suitcase.

563
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,480
Pipe Road was the scene
of the crime.

564
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:53,000
Let's start by cross-checking
Omar's story.

565
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,680
Dig out information, will you?

566
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,080
On it, sir.

567
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,960
Here.

568
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,880
-Thank you, sir.
-Keep your phone switched on.

569
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,160
It's on, sir.

570
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,280
Kolte sahab, the shootout
happened very late last night.

571
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,480
There were no casualties either.
What report will we file?

572
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,080
No, sir... an investigation is under way.

573
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,160
But sir, you know the system.
There's already such a massive backlog.

574
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,600
Alright, Kamble.
Let me know if you get a lead.

575
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,400
Absolutely sir, if we get the CCTV footage
I'll share it.

576
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,960
After all, we go way back.

577
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,720
Alright, sir. Bye!

578
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,840
You there! Come here.

579
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,880
-Yes, you.
-Me?

580
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,600
What's your name?

581
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,640
Shy, are we? Look up.

582
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,040
Nandan Kumar.

583
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,800
Nandan Kumar?

584
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,840
Is this your daily route?

585
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,200
Yes, sir.

586
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,960
What about last night?

587
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,280
Yes, sir.
I passed by at 1.05 am.

588
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,520
I'm a salaried person.

589
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,320
I work at a printing press.
Here's my ID card, sir.

590
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,360
There you go.

591
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,520
Fine... go.

592
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,560
But, sir... what happened here?

593
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,600
There was a shootout.

594
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Shootout? You must have got
the footage on the CCTV?

595
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,360
If only the damn thing worked.

596
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,600
Oh, the damn thing doesn't work?

597
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,200
I mean... it should, shouldn't it.
How can CCTVs...

598
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,800
Kamble sir, this one's working.
The one by the traffic signal is broken.

599
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,840
No, no. This camera isn't working.

600
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,200
Neither is the other one.

601
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,840
What's the point having them?

602
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,600
What a shame!
None of the cameras are working?

603
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,520
While you guys are working all night.

604
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,720
Sometimes, I feel so terrible for you...

605
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,040
Hey... scram!

606
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,000
And... any leads yet?

607
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,480
Been at it, sir.

608
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,760
I'm doing the rounds with
my informants on the street.

609
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,560
In my opinion, it could be a small gang.

610
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,080
Let's just stick to facts, Faizu.

611
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,480
Absolutely, sir!

612
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,920
One thing is for sure.
Omar isn't lying.

613
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,800
His story is adding up.
He's put his boys on the job, too.

614
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,360
Okay. Meet me at Pipe road junction
right now.

615
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,320
Faizu? The name rings a bell.

616
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,600
Graduate, who does he work for?

617
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,120
Inspector Kolte.

618
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,640
How do you know?

619
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,480
They are right in front of me.

620
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,680
Ah, I see! Patil is panicking.
So he summoned his favourite errand boy.

621
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Kolte doesn't work for anyone else.

622
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,480
A boon in disguise.

623
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,080
Kolte won't rest
till he finds the suitcase.

624
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,720
All you need to do is tail him.

625
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,280
Yes, boss.

626
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,080
You'll need to turn into a Remora.

627
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,400
Turn into what, sir?

628
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,120
When will you start your subscription?

629
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,960
I've already informed the cable guy.

630
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,520
They'll start Nat Geo by Monday.

631
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,520
Your Monday's been coming
for two years.

632
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,840
Listen!

633
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:22,760
Remora aka Sucker-fish.
Swims sticking to the shark's belly.

634
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,920
The shark does the hard hunting.
The Remora eats for free.

635
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,840
Stick to Kolte like a Remora.

636
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,120
He'll find the suitcase for us.

637
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,120
Remora.

638
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,240
Yes.

639
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,160
What did he say?

640
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,040
Become a Remora.

641
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,080
What?

642
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,520
Remora!

643
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,520
Give me the suitcase!

644
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,720
What suitcase?

645
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,200
I can't make head or tail of it.

646
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,800
I've left no stone unturned, sir.

647
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,080
My boys are combing every
square inch of the streets.

648
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,760
Have I ever failed you?

649
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,640
-I was born in this neighborhood...
-Faizu!

650
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,320
I don't have time for stories.

651
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,920
I need information. Now!

652
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,680
I think there's a new player in town.

653
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,680
I want to see the Super Manav movie!

654
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,280
Aayush, aren't we going
to the beach after this.

655
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,560
-You can play to your heart's content.
-What's going on?

656
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,480
I want to see Super Manav.

657
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,600
-Unnecessary expenses.
-I want to see it now!

658
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,920
I'll never ask for anything
for the rest of my life!

659
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,920
-Aayush!
-Alright. Let's all watch Super Manav.

660
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,800
What is the big fuss?
Let him have a good time, too.

661
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,160
You're spending a lot these days?

662
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,000
Don't worry about the money.
I have a friend... Joy Bagman.

663
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,120
He's got connections here.
In fact, we'll get free tickets.

664
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,680
Absolutely free.

665
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,800
-Free?
-Yeah, yeah, free.

666
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,600
Everything's free.
Come on. Don't worry.

667
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,120
Free popcorn? Bring it on!

668
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,800
Yes, yes, why not?

669
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,760
It's true, I was born on Planet Nexon.

670
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,520
But ever since I landed here,
Earth has nurtured me like a mother.

671
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,800
And by this Motherland, I solemnly swear
should the forces of evil ever come near

672
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,240
have no fear,
cause you can count on

673
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,080
Super Manav!

674
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,640
Kill him like a mangy dog.

675
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,280
Hey...

676
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,760
What?

677
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,760
Are you seriously into this kiddy film?

678
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,720
Go away!

679
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,080
After this let's go straight for Chinese?

680
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,800
Why not?

681
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,280
We'll roam some more,
and go home later.

682
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,600
Why later?

683
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,280
I've asked Balu to clean the house.

684
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,200
That goof ball will get done in no time.
So why go home late?

685
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,800
He'll clean Ramlal-ji's house first.
Then ours. It'll take him a while.

686
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,880
Oh, Ramlal-ji's house.

687
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,960
What?
Who gave him the keys?

688
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,240
I did. This morning.

689
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,360
The keys? Why?

690
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,680
Why bother cleaning Ramlal-ji's house?

691
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,400
Why bother?
He's our neighbor.

692
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,320
What the hell!

693
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,880
Never offered him a cup of tea.
Suddenly, he's our neighbor?

694
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,400
Hello?

695
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,120
What? Accident!

696
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,200
I'm coming!

697
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,880
I have to go.
My friend has met with an accident.

698
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,280
-Who?
-Him.

699
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,880
-Who?
-The same fellow.

700
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,800
-What?
-Let me explain.

701
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,240
My friend's been in an accident.
It's an emergency.

702
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,040
The doctor said that he needs
RH negative blood.

703
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,560
Now RH negative is rare.
But we have to stay positive, isn't it?

704
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,320
'Cause you have to be positive
for negative blood.

705
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,480
And for positive blood,
you have to be positive, too.

706
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,800
If not, negativity will creep in
and he'll die.

707
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,160
Fine. Go. But, come back quickly.

708
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,040
Okay.

709
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,320
Who is the friend?

710
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,400
I haven't thought that through.

711
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,840
Super Manav, please let me go!
No, no... argh!

712
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,360
Balu!

713
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,600
What are you doing?

714
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,160
Sorry, sir. You scared me.
I spilled water all over.

715
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,640
Never mind. I'll manage Ramlal's house.

716
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,480
Please clean my house first.

717
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,920
That's very kind of you.
But this is my job.

718
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,920
You clean my house quickly.
Lata will arrive any minute.

719
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,560
Today's our anniversary.
So, please hurry up.

720
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,400
Anniv... what?

721
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,880
Our wedding's birthday!

722
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,960
Happy birthday!

723
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,520
Thanks. Now hurry.

724
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,440
Good boy.

725
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Thank you.

726
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Joy Bagman.

727
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:16,120
Joy Bagman, what do I do with you?

728
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,560
Took a bullet from the wife
trying to save you.

729
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,600
You're happily unmarried,
you won't understand.

730
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,440
Say something... thank you...
sorry... anything.

731
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,680
Never mind.

732
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,360
I'll take your silence for an apology.

733
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,560
But Joy, this won't do.

734
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,160
We've got to do something.

735
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,640
You're so fat you are visible
from the moon.

736
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,800
First of all, let's shed some weight,
shall we?

737
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,760
What do you say?

738
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,160
Let's hide one part
behind the refrigerator.

739
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
No! Lata might easily spot it.

740
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,520
How about we place you up high?

741
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,120
Lata has back trouble.

742
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,240
One part in old clothes,
one in the kitchen.

743
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,800
One part in the trunk that opens
only during Diwali.

744
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,480
Behind God's photograph.

745
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,720
In God we trust.
Leave it to Him!

746
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,320
Focus, Mr Bagman.

747
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,520
It's not the time to eat Chinese.
It's time to scale the Great Wall.

748
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,040
Some behind father, grandmother.

749
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,080
There's no success without
the blessings of the elders.

750
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,760
One in the water tank.

751
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,440
We'll deal with the rest
before Ramlal returns.

752
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,360
Great... now you're feeling lighter
and so am I.

753
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,680
Cheers!

754
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,600
Victory to India, Patil sahab!

755
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,360
Kolte! What news of the suitcase?

756
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,480
Sir... I'm on it.

757
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,000
Are you eating?
Should I call later?

758
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,480
No, no, sir. We can speak.

759
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,880
What is left to speak?
I've lost my appetite.

760
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,640
Can a man worried
about the suitcase feel hungry?

761
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,160
Kolte? What happened?

762
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,640
I definitely didn't mean
that you're eating

763
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,440
because you aren't worried
about the suitcase.

764
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:48,440
Please eat.
Sorry, I disturbed you. Okay.

765
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,800
Pass the carrot cake here too.

766
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,720
-Faizu.
-Yes, sir.

767
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,840
-Listen.
-Yes, sir.

768
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,760
The CCTV at Pipe Road
isn't working.

769
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,240
Neither is this inquiry a priority
for the department.

770
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,960
Let's do one thing.

771
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,680
List out all the shops
in that locality with CCTV cameras.

772
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,200
I'll get the footage
from the shopkeepers.

773
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,320
Okay, sir.

774
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,320
Okay.

775
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,120
-Nandan.
-Yes, sir!

776
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,720
What happened?

777
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,280
-You lucky son of a gun.
-Why, sir?

778
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,080
You've been nominated
for 'Kirodimal Employee of the Year'.

779
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,360
If you win, you take home 7000 rupees.
How much?

780
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,000
-7000.
-7000!

781
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,120
And one hell of a shiny trophy.

782
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,280
-Fantastic. Keep it up.
-Thank you, sir.

783
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,760
Hello?

784
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,680
What's for dinner?

785
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,440
I haven't decided.

786
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,520
I'm fine with leftovers from lunch.

787
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,800
You can warm it up
in your new oven.

788
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,760
What?

789
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,360
-An oven for the lady.
-What's this?

790
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,080
Warms the food and cools the mind.

791
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,920
Oven? Is it ours?

792
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,120
Who else's?

793
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,680
Such a big one.

794
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,040
Wow!

795
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,200
Where did you get the money?

796
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,000
Oh, I have a friend.

797
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,920
He's got connections
at the electronic store.

798
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,600
Which friend? Joy?

799
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:16,480
Yes. Joy Bagman.
60 percent off with easy installments.

800
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,760
I was thinking of getting
an air conditioner, too.

801
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,440
Is he a new friend?

802
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,000
I've been hearing a lot
about him of late.

803
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,160
Call him over for dinner sometime.

804
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,600
He's a childhood friend.
Sure, we'll invite him for dinner.

805
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,320
Not just dinner, I was thinking...
Aayush is here.

806
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,840
Aayush, come here.
Look what I've got for you.

807
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,400
Yay! A Super Manav bag.

808
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,920
Wait a second.

809
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,280
Where's the water bottle, snack box
and other goodies that come with it?

810
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,720
Aayush, be happy with what dad got you.
What does grandpa say?

811
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,920
Hold on... I'll handle him.
Won't you get me a cup of tea?

812
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,760
Please.

813
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,080
Come here.

814
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,960
So, you want the rest of the set too?

815
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,680
Give me some time.
Papa will get you everything.

816
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,480
First, we'll get a big new TV,
an AC, a car.

817
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,200
We'll go to Shimla and have a blast.
Happy?

818
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,560
Where do I begin, I'm speechless.
All I can say is...

819
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,160
Thank you.

820
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,600
Everyone, please sit down.

821
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,720
This award is not just an award.
Then what is it?

822
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,360
It is a victory of hard work
and honesty.

823
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,680
Aren't you getting your award today?

824
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,920
Award? What award?

825
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,880
Best employee.

826
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,120
Let me get it first.
Don't jinx it.

827
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,480
Papa's going to win an award!

828
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,760
-Aayush!
-Boys!

829
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,240
-Papa's going to win!
-Now I had better win it.

830
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,320
You will win for sure.
Considering all the night duty you do?

831
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,240
And if you win 7000 rupees.

832
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,040
Then...

833
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,640
Then?

834
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,280
Then...

835
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:08,920
Then?

836
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,720
Then bring it home.
Don't give it to sister Binu!

837
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,440
What's your problem
with sister Binu?

838
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,960
Did she steal your dad's kidney?

839
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,280
Papa, there's also a party in the building
tonight... let's bring the roof down!

840
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,440
-What party?
-It's Mukesh's birthday!

841
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,320
Oh? That's tonight?

842
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,400
Sweet!

843
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,080
Come, let's check your homework.

844
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,000
What happened?

845
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,800
Nothing... just a blockage.
It's cleared now.

846
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,880
I'll see who it is.

847
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:07,920
Keys, please.

848
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,040
Nandan-ji, my house keys.

849
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:19,320
Keys? I wasn't expecting you
till next week. How come you're early?

850
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,920
Wrapped up my work early,
so I came back.

851
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,840
Work, work, work.
Work is temporary, family is forever.

852
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,640
Shouldn't you have spent
more time with them?

853
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,360
-Instead, here you are.
-Keys to my house, please.

854
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,640
Keys to... keys to... to... two keys
You should've had two keys

855
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,040
The original one's lost.

856
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Nonsense! It was in your pocket last night.
Namaste. We've cleaned your house.

857
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,800
True! I did have it last night.
I lost it in the morning.

858
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,200
In the morning, it fell in the toilet!
It fell in the toilet. Sorry.

859
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,880
In the toilet?

860
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,040
Ramlal-ji, what's done is done.

861
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,680
We'll have to make another.

862
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,440
Please catch the key-maker
before he leaves for lunch.

863
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,920
What were you doing with my keys
in the toilet?

864
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,200
I haven't thought that through.

865
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,120
Ramlal-ji, I found your key!

866
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,640
I put my hand in the toilet
and fished it out. Here...

867
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:05,280
No, thank you. Now that he's here
I'll get a duplicate made. Keep it.

868
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,880
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

869
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,040
Fine.

870
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,160
Why?

871
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,160
O why?

872
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,960
Why, O why?

873
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,480
Why?

874
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,080
Why have the nights turned foe?

875
01:09:53,320 --> 01:10:01,000
O night, why this hostility?

876
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,720
What is it?

877
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,480
Do I look like the mailman?
I forgot my purse. Open up.

878
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,560
-Why haven't you showered?
-I will, I will...

879
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,600
-Have you seen my purse?
-It must be in this room.

880
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,440
Where is it?

881
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,800
Here it is.

882
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,520
Whose money is this?

883
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,920
Lata, I was about to tell you.
I...

884
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,920
150 rupees.
How careless of you!

885
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,880
I was looking for it.
Thanks.

886
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,680
And what is this wet towel doing here?

887
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,240
You're looking hot like chicken chilly.

888
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,320
Stop it!

889
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,040
O hostile night.

890
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,680
Fantastic!

891
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,160
Indeed, when love departs,
even the nights turn hostile

892
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,040
Moving on to our next employee's talent.

893
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,800
Bravo!

894
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,200
O walnut, why are thee so tough?

895
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,360
Does your resilient exterior
protect a fragile ego?

896
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:48,040
Is it a reflection of society's brutality?

897
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:54,160
Shake society up, O walnut...

898
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:11,320
I now request our chief guest
Mr. Vasanth Goenka to come on stage

899
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,440
and award the 'Kirodimal Employee
of the Year' trophy to the winner.

900
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,800
The employee of the year is...

901
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,400
I was trying to call you
but there's no network.

902
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,200
Give it.

903
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,600
Congratulations.

904
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,800
I was waiting for you
but you never came.

905
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,120
Nandan, congrats!

906
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,360
What... no party?

907
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,160
Mukesh isn't here either.

908
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,440
Mukesh?

909
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:48,280
No, Nandan-ji. He's coming.
The party's also on.

910
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,080
Minus the alcohol.

911
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,520
-Mocktail.
-What?

912
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,760
Hello... today is a holy day,
Lots of us are fasting.

913
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,880
So no alcohol, and no meat.
It's gotta be a holy party!

914
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,480
That's right.

915
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,600
All thanks to your wife.

916
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,440
Mukesh!

917
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,720
Wow, Mukesh!
2,000 rupee notes?

918
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,280
Mukesh, tell me...
isn't it your birthday?

919
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,960
Who were we singing about?

920
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,240
Huh?

921
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:20,320
Pa-Pa Praveen Tripathi?

922
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:36,880
Sir, look... the CCTV footage
from Vidya Jewelers.

923
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,520
Who is that?
Which gang is he from?

924
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:45,920
Replay it.

925
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,240
Didn't I tell you,
there's a new player in town.

926
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:58,520
What's he holding?
A bag, an umbrella and a tiffin box.

927
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,960
Looks like the average Joe!

928
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,360
Don't have a clear view
of the rickshaw driver either.

929
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,040
They could even be partners.

930
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,400
Look, can you see
the license plate?

931
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,080
If we can nab this driver
we'll nail him, too.

932
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,560
8-0-8-0. No... 1-9-8-0.

933
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,000
Zoom in.

934
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,920
Nine... eight...

935
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,080
It's too hazy.

936
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,000
Look, it could be any of these numbers.

937
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,600
Let's narrow it down
to rickshaw license plates.

938
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,400
-Line up the drivers.
-Got it.

939
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,720
Now we are talking!

940
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,240
Fancy a drink?

941
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,360
No, sir.
How can I drink with you?

942
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,920
We are ranks apart.
I wouldn't dare.

943
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,520
You're a cop...
I'm just an informer.

944
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,320
-Yes or no?
-Yes, of course!

945
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,320
Get the vodka bottle
from behind the shelf.

946
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,320
I drink every night, sir.

947
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,560
Joy Bagman, there's just one problem.

948
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,800
Money, money everywhere
but not a penny can I spend!

949
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,680
I have to lie
to buy gifts for Aayush and Lata.

950
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,880
If they learn about you,
we'll both get kicked out.

951
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,720
Gods are her relatives.

952
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:34,400
A priest's daughter, after all.
She hates black money!

953
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,520
Me? I don't discriminate.

954
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,440
And I bet, this money doesn't
belong to a poor man.

955
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,800
So how is it a sin?

956
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,080
Joy, we need to think big.

957
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,000
Alright, let's make this quick.
I don't have all day. I'm on duty.

958
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,680
14th? That was my birthday!

959
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:04,840
So?

960
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,400
So I was home, sir.

961
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,160
I didn't do anything, sir.

962
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,000
That night I was in Chandivali,
no... Kandivali.

963
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,560
It's true, I used be a chain snatcher, sir.
But, now I'm clean.

964
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,000
I've turned over a new leaf.

965
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,600
I swear on God!

966
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,760
And these are God given gifts?

967
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,600
You asked to see me, sir?

968
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,600
Yes.

969
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,880
Where were you?

970
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,320
Sir, I'd gone to my village.

971
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,000
Does it take so long to return?

972
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,560
Where's your village?

973
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,320
Bhoomarbawdi. It's very far, sir.

974
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,600
-Name?
-Keshav Prajapati.

975
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,040
14th night, at 2 am
where were you, Prajapati?

976
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,640
2 am...

977
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,440
Let me jog your memory.

978
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:02,120
You were on Pipe Road helping
your partner-in-crime move stolen money.

979
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,360
-Robbery?
-Sit. Look carefully.

980
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,600
Isn't this your rickshaw?

981
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,200
Yes, sir.

982
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,520
And?

983
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,000
I remember...
The guy seemed fishy.

984
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,160
I saw the suitcase and asked
if there was a body in it.

985
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,160
-What?
-It felt that heavy, sir.

986
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Welcome to Kamania Residency.

987
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,480
India's number one real estate company.

988
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,560
-Hello, madam. I...
-For English, press one.

989
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,840
For Hindi, press two.
For Marathi, press three.

990
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,720
Sorry all our customer executives
are busy at the moment.

991
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,440
Please call after...

992
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,240
Welcome to Chaddha Galaxy.

993
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,040
Hello...

994
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

995
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:16,120
Hello! Can I schedule a visit
to see the property on Sunday?

996
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:20,120
Sure, sir. But, please could you share
your contact details first.

997
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,640
-Yes, of course.
-Go ahead.

998
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,920
One vegetable biryani, two portions rice,
one buttermilk and one poppadum.

999
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,560
-Hello!
-For dessert, 200 grams of your best.

1000
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,480
-Sir!
-Please hurry, I'm starving.

1001
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,880
Sir, I dropped him here.

1002
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,720
From here he must have gone
somewhere close by.

1003
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,200
Where does this road go?

1004
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,760
This one leads to the main road.
And there's a fish market to the left.

1005
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,320
Do you remember his face?

1006
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,840
Yes, kind of.

1007
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,760
We should get a sketch done quickly.

1008
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,120
Sir, my drawing sucks.

1009
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,920
Are you high?
Why will you draw?

1010
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,920
There are artists that do this.

1011
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,000
Now buzz off.
Come see me tomorrow.

1012
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,000
Fool!

1013
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,680
Faizu, check the neighbourhood.

1014
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:21,200
Start with the shops.
Look for CCTV cameras.

1015
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,520
So, Mr. Nandan Kumar,
you own a printing press?

1016
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,320
Printing press in Bhandup West .

1017
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,720
Ah, Budapest!

1018
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,320
Just outstanding, sir.
That's a perfect match.

1019
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,960
Allow me to explain, sir.

1020
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:48,360
When you invest in a property here,
you don't get a flat.

1021
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,320
Sir, it's an experience you're buying into.

1022
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:56,480
Podium level parking
for your Mercedes or BM...

1023
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,320
W?

1024
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,480
You look like the Beamer type.

1025
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,160
Creme-de-la-creme neighbours...
who are business tycoons like you.

1026
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,800
Executive lounge where you can crack
the deal for your next printing press.

1027
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,000
Gymnasium, swimming pool with a jacuzzi
to rejuvenate you.

1028
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,920
Cards room, billiards room and
a mini golf course, which is a must, sir!

1029
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:12,800
-Of course.
-Isn't it?

1030
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,800
Should we go and see
a sample flat then, sir?

1031
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,840
-Yes.
-After you.

1032
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,880
Shall we discuss commercials, sir?

1033
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,920
Commercials?

1034
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,160
-Payment terms?
-Yes, payment!

1035
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,520
Sir, we have a 20-80 scheme.
20 percent upfront and rest 80, loan...

1036
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,720
which I don't think you will need.

1037
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,240
So, the 20 percent can be paid
to us directly via...

1038
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,400
Cash!

1039
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,160
Which you won't accept.

1040
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,640
And the rest of the 80 percent...
you won't accept in cash either.

1041
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,280
Right, sir.

1042
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,880
Then what am I doing here?
Where's the way out?

1043
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,880
Prince Bagman...
what good is it having you?

1044
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,880
Can't buy laxative worth 40 bucks
nor a luxury apartment worth 40 million.

1045
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,800
And even if I did buy the apartment,
what was I going to tell Lata?

1046
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,600
I am the one that's going crazy.
While you sit here and gloat.

1047
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,320
What are you doing?
Turning brass into gold?

1048
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,360
Sir, 100 percent sure.
He looks nothing like this.

1049
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,720
Sir, I drew it exactly as he told me.

1050
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:38,240
Sir, I think his drawing sucks too.

1051
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,360
You think this is funny?

1052
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,520
No, sir.
I remembered something.

1053
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,000
I remember.
I remember it all now.

1054
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,600
Sir, as he took out
the money to pay me,

1055
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,720
he dropped a bank card.

1056
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,720
Did you read the name on it?

1057
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,600
I don't remember the name.

1058
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,400
But there was... Bank India
or India Bank... written.

1059
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,080
It had the word 'India' on it.

1060
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,200
Okay, now beat it.

1061
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,240
Stop!

1062
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,720
Don't leave town.

1063
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,000
Sir, I'm an auto rickshaw driver.

1064
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,480
Legally, I cannot go beyond city limits.

1065
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:34,520
Sir, there are no CCTV cameras
on that lane.

1066
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:42,360
We'll have to check all the banks within
a 4 km radius of Azad Nagar

1067
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,960
that has 'India' in its name.

1068
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,320
Have you or your staff noticed
any strange behaviour in any customer?

1069
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:54,320
A recurrent cash deposit
of 10-20 grand?

1070
01:27:54,720 --> 01:28:00,800
Especially large bills
with the same serial number.

1071
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,880
Or a request for extra lockers?

1072
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,560
Or any customer
behaving suspiciously?

1073
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,760
Please try and recall.

1074
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,920
Bank? Why now?

1075
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,200
Don't you know
it's the annual day at school?

1076
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,200
-I know. But, Mr. Vasant can't be trusted.
-What?

1077
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,160
What if the award cheque bounces?

1078
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,440
-Right, please.
-Don't worry.

1079
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,520
I'll wrap up the bank work
and come fast.

1080
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,080
The show starts in half hour. Hurry.

1081
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,360
Chill, I'll make it in time.

1082
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,240
Ridiculous!

1083
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,600
Mr. Dhumal isn't in today?
Is he on leave?

1084
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,040
Where can one get a machine like this?

1085
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,000
Why?

1086
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:50,280
There are two sacks full of cash at home,
I can't count it all.

1087
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,440
Two sacks full.
Look at me!

1088
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,800
Wait here.
I'll be back.

1089
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,520
Mr. Vashisht, are you aware

1090
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,080
we're throwing a surprise party
for Damle's birthday?

1091
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,240
Of course! The plan is to wait
till he gets to his seat.

1092
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,280
Sharma and I will sneak in from there
with the cake.

1093
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,160
Don't point.
Damle will see us.

1094
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,320
I've sent a reminder to everybody
on our Whatsapp group.

1095
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,160
Mr Damle, we're gonna smash cake
all over your face today.

1096
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,800
Sir, please wait!
Tiwari, stop him.

1097
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,320
Sir!

1098
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,560
Sir, please wait!

1099
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:05,840
Come back.

1100
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,040
I'll be back.

1101
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,240
What happened?

1102
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:31,080
Absolutely nothing.
You simply passed out, Nandan-ji.

1103
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,040
You were almost in an accident.
Here...

1104
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,160
I was trying to get your attention.
You forgot to take your deposit slip.

1105
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,920
Slip?

1106
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,800
Slip!

1107
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,760
Thank you.

1108
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,480
Take it easy.

1109
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:02,240
Lata... look, I really tried to make it.

1110
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,560
At least, tell me how the function was.

1111
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,320
Yes, I remember.

1112
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:16,600
There was a man like this.
Seemed suspicious.

1113
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:20,360
Can you describe him for me?
Any distinct features?

1114
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,800
Sir, he had...

1115
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,600
a mustache.

1116
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,480
Mustache?

1117
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,480
Mustache!

1118
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,000
Mustache?

1119
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,240
A mustache!

1120
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,760
How do you manage
to remember such fine details?

1121
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,360
Sir, there's a book...

1122
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,160
Observation by Association
by K.Y Vashisht. My father!

1123
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,760
There are many such techniques
prescribed in it.

1124
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,600
One more thing,
my mother used to feed me

1125
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,360
almonds rich in Omega 3, 6, 9
throughout my childhood.

1126
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:58,200
As a result my memory has improved
by approximately 27 percent.

1127
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,720
But just between you and I...

1128
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,960
When it comes to almonds,
always go for the Mamra variety.

1129
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,000
The rest of them are just...

1130
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,440
Shut up!

1131
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,880
Do you think a mustache
will help me find the guy?

1132
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,440
Rubbish!
Giving me useless information...

1133
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,320
association-disassociation,
nuts-guts, 3-9-6...

1134
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,000
Omega 3, 6, 9, sir.

1135
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,600
Shut up, fool!

1136
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,200
Just a minute... he's right, sir.

1137
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,840
I know this guy as well.

1138
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,680
He was a bit weird, sir.
First he inquired about a counting machine.

1139
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,520
Then all of a sudden,
he looked possessed

1140
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,240
and ran out of the bank.

1141
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,440
He even met with an accident.
Didn't he?

1142
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,920
Counting machine?

1143
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,920
Yes.

1144
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,680
Can you describe him for me?

1145
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,320
Even better, I can give you
his name and address.

1146
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,520
He banks with us.

1147
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,520
But what's this all about, sir?

1148
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,360
Stop.

1149
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,960
-How much?
-40.

1150
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,800
Got change for 100?

1151
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:17,000
No? Then give me a 50.

1152
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:29,280
If rickshaw drivers
don't have change then who will?

1153
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,840
You should've asked me.

1154
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,520
But no, I don't have change either.

1155
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:40,320
I have plenty of 2000 bills though!

1156
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,240
What's this?

1157
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,240
I should be asking you.
What's this?

1158
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,440
Isn't this what you were hiding from me?

1159
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,120
Why did you climb up?

1160
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,640
The doctor forbid you.

1161
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,720
I wanted to get things down.
I called Balu to help...

1162
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,000
that's when I found it.

1163
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,920
Balu?

1164
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,640
Balu saw it, too?

1165
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,320
I saw it.
What about that?

1166
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:07,960
Aayush... where's he?

1167
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,880
I've sent him to sister Binu's home.
Should he see this?

1168
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:14,720
Lata, I was about to tell you
about the suitcase...

1169
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,600
When? How long has it been
in my home?

1170
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,600
Why is it here?
Where has it come from?

1171
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,480
I found it on the road.

1172
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,160
On the road?
You don't know whose it is?

1173
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,360
-Have you stolen it?
-Listen...

1174
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,640
Have you kidnapped someone?
What's the need...

1175
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,440
Shut up!

1176
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,600
What's the need?

1177
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:41,320
Every single day, you remind me
how much money we need.

1178
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,760
Oven, AC... 80,000
for a pickle business...

1179
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,840
"I haven't gone to Shimla
in 10 years."

1180
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,080
Want to go to Shimla?
I'll have a ticket in 10 minutes.

1181
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:05,840
I'm glad you found out
the truth about Joy Bagman.

1182
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,840
At least, I don't have to hide it
from you anymore.

1183
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:14,960
Lata, just imagine...

1184
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,920
an end to all our problems.

1185
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,520
God is watching.

1186
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,240
He's also seeing our situation.

1187
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,960
And this is not
some poor man's money.

1188
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,400
Rich people hide their money this way.

1189
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,760
It is black money.

1190
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:39,880
I don't want it.
I wasn't raised this way.

1191
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:43,480
As if I was raised by bandits.

1192
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:49,040
Lata, you've seen how hard I slog.
We still make peanuts.

1193
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,960
Politicians, businessmen...
this is how they become rich.

1194
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,880
You know this.

1195
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,160
That's their destiny.

1196
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,360
Then this is ours.

1197
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,920
Fine.

1198
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,480
If my nagging led to all this,

1199
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,040
then accept my apologies!

1200
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,760
Please return it.

1201
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,880
I knew you'd react this way.

1202
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:16,240
That's why I didn't tell you.

1203
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,040
Return it?
To whom? Where?

1204
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,360
I don't know whose it is.
I found it on the street.

1205
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,200
And before taking it,
I even asked...

1206
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,840
"For the last time...
whose bag is it?"

1207
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,360
No one answered.
Who do I return it to?

1208
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,320
The police.

1209
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,720
Police?

1210
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,080
God!

1211
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,840
Do you really think,
I should lug this bag full of cash

1212
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
and go to the police?

1213
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:45,640
Yes and no.

1214
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:55,920
Who are you?

1215
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:00,960
Me? I am a cop... and not one.

1216
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,880
Namaste, madam.

1217
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,200
Won't you offer me a cup of tea?

1218
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,680
Nandan Kumar!

1219
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,840
You've got yourself in a real pickle.

1220
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,240
You took the suitcase
from Pipe Road on the 14th, right?

1221
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,200
Which suitcase? Who are you?

1222
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,120
Which suitcase?

1223
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,520
The one you were telling
your wife about.

1224
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,760
-Why didn't you report it to the cops?
-Sir, I'd try calling every day.

1225
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,600
The lines were busy so I thought...

1226
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,920
-Please don't hit him, sir.
-Quiet! Sit there.

1227
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,920
Sit. Just sit.

1228
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,000
-I'll sit...
-Sit... sit...

1229
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,280
Tell me, where's the suitcase?
Which gang do you belong to?

1230
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,240
Gang? I don't belong to any gang.
I swear.

1231
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,840
Fine, let's try the hard way.

1232
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,480
Don't, sir... I'll bring it.

1233
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,360
The suitcase is inside. I'll get it.

1234
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:10,240
Sir, she's getting it.

1235
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,840
Sir, here.

1236
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,680
Get back.

1237
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,760
Where's the rest of the money?

1238
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,080
-Blew it?
-Sir, just a second.

1239
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,480
Sir, 84,434 rupees.

1240
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,320
Please...

1241
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,680
Where's the rest?

1242
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,320
The rest?

1243
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,240
There's more?

1244
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,360
I'll give it to you.

1245
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,120
Please give me 10 minutes.
I'll get the rest. Please sit.

1246
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,000
Have some tea.
Lata, please give him some tea.

1247
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,640
We're out of sugar.

1248
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,520
Over? Fine.

1249
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:15,160
Don't move.

1250
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,160
Stay right there.

1251
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,040
Sir...

1252
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,520
Sir... sir!

1253
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,560
Sir, there's only this much at home.

1254
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,640
Meaning?

1255
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,200
Idiot, you think this is an Uber?
Sit upfront.

1256
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,880
Bala boss, did you see that?

1257
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,640
Yes. Follow him.

1258
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,360
I'm sending some more boys.

1259
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,760
No, boss. There's no time.
We'll steal the suitcase.

1260
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,880
What?

1261
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,120
At some point, hyena cubs must learn
to steal a meal from a lion's mouth.

1262
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,520
This they do in the deadly Savannah.

1263
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,560
Luckily for us, this is only Ghatkopar.

1264
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,520
Rajan, what did you just say?

1265
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,840
Last night, we saw the first episode...

1266
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,880
on 'The Amazing African Hyena'.

1267
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:46,000
We've subscribed
to National Geographic, boss.

1268
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:54,120
Rajan, Graduate...
you boys have grown up!

1269
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:01,200
Go forth, my boys...
bring the suitcase home.

1270
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,760
Sir, please stop here.
This is the back entrance to the office.

1271
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,600
I'll get the money.

1272
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,920
And listen, fool!

1273
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:14,560
No monkey business.
I know where you live.

1274
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,400
I know, sir. I'll be right back.

1275
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:22,000
Are you buying groceries?

1276
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,440
Take this bag.

1277
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,920
And leave this here.

1278
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,440
Nandan?

1279
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,560
What are you doing here?
Are you on the night shift?

1280
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,040
No, sir...

1281
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:51,000
I damaged the dampener.

1282
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,400
So I came to check on it.

1283
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:02,000
Come. Sit.

1284
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:08,080
-Come, drink with me today.
-No, sir... not today.

1285
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,320
Even you won't drink with me?
Not even one drink?

1286
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,200
Sir, it's just that...
I'm in a hurry to get home.

1287
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,000
I'm asking nicely.

1288
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,360
-Sir, I can't today.
-Sit...

1289
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,040
-Sir, it's late
-Sit!

1290
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,000
Sit.

1291
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,200
It's a request.

1292
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,600
Here...

1293
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:43,680
Nandan, my father, Kirodimal...

1294
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:57,520
I started the employee of the year award
in his memory.

1295
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:01,640
Do you know why?
I respected him a lot...

1296
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,560
I still do.

1297
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:09,200
But he never understood my feelings.

1298
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:49,920
Graduate?

1299
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,760
Yes boss, he even took a photograph.

1300
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,040
Didn't I tell you...
I was sending more men there.

1301
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:00,520
If Kolte tells Patil
that we're involved...

1302
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,040
do you know what will happen to us?

1303
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,280
Rajan, we won't spare Kolte.

1304
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,360
Yes, boss.

1305
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,560
When I was a young boy,
we were flying kites

1306
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:30,640
and I wrote my father's name,
on the kite... "Ki-ro-di-mal"

1307
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,560
Why?

1308
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,400
I wanted my father's name
to soar the skies.

1309
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,280
Up there!

1310
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:54,520
Everyone shouted...
"Look, Kirodimal rules the skies!"

1311
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,920
That, father didn't see.

1312
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,440
Later, someone cut my string

1313
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:12,120
and the kite tailspinned down
straight into the gutter.

1314
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,560
Everyone shouted,

1315
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:18,040
"Kirodimal is down in the gutter!"

1316
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,600
That, father saw.

1317
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,000
He blew his top.

1318
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,360
Was it my fault?

1319
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,400
Did I do it on purpose?

1320
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,040
I wanted his name...

1321
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,840
to soar...

1322
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:47,520
Hello.

1323
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,720
Playing games with the police?
You sent men after me?

1324
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:54,240
What are you talking about?
I'm stuck in the Press.

1325
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,720
Are you bringing the money
or printing it?

1326
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,400
What can I say, sir?

1327
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,680
My drunk boss has passed out
on my shoulder.

1328
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:01,920
He's crying about his father...

1329
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:04,480
Listen, change of plans.

1330
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,960
But, don't leave
unless I tell you. Got it?

1331
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:09,760
Yes, sir.

1332
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:22,280
Nandan, don't blame yourself
for the dampener.

1333
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,400
Yes, Patil sahab.

1334
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,400
Kolte, when am I hearing
the good news?

1335
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,680
I've got a solid lead.

1336
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,240
A few days, and the suitcase will be
in our hands.

1337
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:15,520
Whose hands?

1338
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,360
Obviously yours, sir.
Why?

1339
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,200
Just checking.

1340
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:22,080
I thought, by now
you would have the suitcase.

1341
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,720
If I did, wouldn't it be with you already?

1342
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:29,040
True that.
Fine, goodnight.

1343
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:38,280
Kolte says he hasn't
found the suitcase.

1344
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:45,800
I think Kolte was never planning on
telling me about the suitcase.

1345
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,280
And I foolishly did.

1346
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,640
What?

1347
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:58,840
Sir, as I was saying before,
my fight was with Omar.

1348
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:03,480
The moment I got to know
that the suitcase was yours,

1349
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,880
I came to apologise.

1350
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,560
Okay, sir... I'll take your leave.

1351
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:16,600
But Kolte didn't do the right thing.

1352
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,840
Nor did you.

1353
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:22,800
Kolte has the suitcase because of you.

1354
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,520
So, who should bring it back?

1355
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,880
Me?

1356
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,680
Good suggestion.

1357
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,200
Perfect.

1358
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,440
Get me the suitcase

1359
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,280
and that Shantaram Mill murder case...

1360
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,280
I won't let them re-open it.

1361
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,200
What happened?

1362
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:50,800
I hope you don't feel that
I'm manipulating you.

1363
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,720
Please don't!

1364
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:56,760
This is the start
of a long friendship.

1365
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:01,800
Look, your new friend is here, too.

1366
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:06,360
-Sir, what's he doing here?
-I could ask you the same.

1367
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,080
-Let's settle this right now!
-Why not?

1368
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:12,840
It's time for both of you
to join forces.

1369
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,280
Shake on it!

1370
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:21,480
When will you guys grow up?

1371
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:23,960
Fine.

1372
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:30,480
If you're done with your soap opera,
listen to me carefully.

1373
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:34,240
Do whatever it takes.

1374
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:37,800
Kill Kolte, if you have to.

1375
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:42,200
But, get me that suitcase.

1376
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:46,440
Nail this matter,
and consider all your cases shut.

1377
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,640
Now, get out.

1378
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,000
Yes, boss?

1379
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,080
Rajan, listen carefully.

1380
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,200
-Yes, boss?
-You have to do something urgently.

1381
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,480
-Listen...
-Yes, sir.

1382
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,600
First, get hold of the suitcase,

1383
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,960
and more importantly, the file!

1384
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,080
Okay, Patil sahab.
No mistakes this time.

1385
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,440
Sir, may I ask you a question?

1386
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,760
Do you think the file
is still in the suitcase?

1387
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,920
Do I think?
I know, it is.

1388
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:34,320
I realised when Kolte flipped.

1389
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,560
Both the suitcase and file
are with him.

1390
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:41,000
Anyway, we have to take
a chance, Subhash.

1391
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:46,200
And if you had asked questions
before giving the file to Omar,

1392
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,040
we wouldn't be in this soup.

1393
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,640
Go. Get me some tea.

1394
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:57,840
Patil, you slime-bag!

1395
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:02,000
I'll pull your strings now.

1396
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,920
Let's see who goes to Boomarbawdi now.

1397
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,960
You're my life, my love
O, I love you daddy!

1398
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,920
-Hello.
-Nandan, are you okay?

1399
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,760
Did you return the money?
Did the cop go?

1400
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,520
Come home, Nandan.
I'm really scared.

1401
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,640
Shut up!

1402
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:23,360
You shut up!
Please listen to me, Nandan...

1403
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,600
That wasn't for you, sir!

1404
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:28,160
He's your father.
Keep singing.

1405
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,920
-Lata, I'm fine.
-Why are you shouting at me?

1406
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:33,280
Don't ask me the details.

1407
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,440
I'll call later. Hang up now.

1408
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:40,960
You're my life, my love

1409
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,760
O, I love you Daddy!

1410
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,320
Faizu...

1411
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,160
Kolte sir, where are you?

1412
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,440
-Home.
-At home?

1413
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:54,280
I have some information.

1414
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,840
The Crime Branch is going to raid
your home.

1415
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:59,720
Raid? Go on.

1416
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:03,480
Confirmed news, sir.
They're targeting cops.

1417
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,680
The raid could take place tonight.

1418
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:10,760
Gopal, the CBI informer
got drunk and spilled it.

1419
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,040
Thought you should know.

1420
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,960
Fine. I'll figure something out.

1421
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,600
Listen, there's been an incident.
I need some information.

1422
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:23,280
I'm sending you a photograph.
Find out who it is.

1423
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,840
Okay, sir.

1424
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:33,040
There will be a photo
of Kolte like this too.

1425
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,320
And we'll use it for his funeral!

1426
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,240
Now the Serpentes
will come out of its hole.

1427
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:57,080
-I'm outside. Are you here?
-Listen, fool...

1428
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,200
I'm sending you an address.

1429
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:02,320
Meet me there quickly
with the money. Got it?

1430
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,440
How's that possible, sir?

1431
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
How do you expect me to travel
with so much money?

1432
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:14,280
Just like that night, when you got home
with even more money.

1433
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:15,680
Got it?

1434
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,680
Fine.

1435
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,440
Rickshaw!

1436
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:53,480
Let's take Kolte out at the next signal.
Don't waste any time.

1437
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:58,640
Hello, brother.
Yes, I've just reached Mumbai.

1438
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,840
Yes, just a bag full of clothes.

1439
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,320
Of course, there's no money...

1440
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:04,640
I'm going to sister Binu's.

1441
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,360
Bala, what should we do?

1442
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,200
Let's wait.

1443
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,520
-I'll see you later.
-Right, sir.

1444
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,600
Do I need to ask you
where Kolte's gone?

1445
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,320
Have you entered the gate?

1446
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:56,720
Yes, sir.

1447
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:01,240
See the black door
with police tape across it?

1448
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,400
Enter without tampering it.

1449
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:21,920
Sir, where are you?

1450
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:23,520
Keep walking.

1451
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:09,000
Fine. Get out.

1452
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,240
Sir, can I have my bag?

1453
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,800
Which bag?

1454
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:19,680
The cloth bag.
Lata will whine about it.

1455
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:22,400
I gave you your bag.
Please return mine.

1456
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,760
-The grocery bag?
-Yes.

1457
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,400
It must be by the door.
Take it and leave.

1458
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,400
Okay.

1459
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:37,960
What are you doing, sir?

1460
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,680
What are you dogs doing together?

1461
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,880
What are you doing
with the suitcase, rascal?

1462
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,600
What suitcase?

1463
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,960
There is no use lying.
We have a photo.

1464
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,520
Even if I do have the suitcase
do you think I'd bring it here?

1465
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,200
You take me for a fool?

1466
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,400
And I know it's not
just the suitcase you want.

1467
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,400
Patil is using us all.

1468
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:26,200
If you kill me,
you won't get anything.

1469
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,720
I have a much better plan.

1470
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:33,080
One that will benefit us all.
What do you say?

1471
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:41,880
Okay. Let's put our guns aside and talk.

1472
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,240
You're right, Kolte.

1473
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:08,880
We'll all benefit if we help each other.

1474
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,840
Like the plover bird and crocodile.

1475
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,720
Who?

1476
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:17,360
Plover bird...

1477
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:20,520
the one that cleans
the crocodile's teeth.

1478
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,120
Thank you, Rajan.

1479
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,640
In the jungle all animals help each other.

1480
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:31,800
The plover bird gets its food
and the crocodile's teeth are...

1481
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:34,440
You do know what a crocodile is, right?

1482
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,280
Of course, so?

1483
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,400
So its teeth get cleaned.

1484
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:42,160
Why are we discussing
crocodile dental hygiene?

1485
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:45,400
Sir, may I?

1486
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,000
Sir, it's a metaphor.

1487
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:55,440
The plover bird pecks
at the crocodile's teeth.

1488
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:58,400
The croc gets clean teeth,
the plover bird gets food.

1489
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:01,240
Thus they exist
in a symbiotic relationship.

1490
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,560
Repeat the last line.

1491
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:07,160
Thus they exist
in a symbiotic relationship.

1492
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,000
Fantastic. Well said.

1493
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,320
Thank you.

1494
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,120
But, who the heck are you?

1495
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:19,760
Sir, I...

1496
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,920
-Is he your friend?
-Not at all!

1497
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,360
We're in this situation because of him.
He stole the bag.

1498
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,440
Bala, he's right.
They left from his house earlier.

1499
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:32,000
Just a minute!

1500
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:35,880
Sir, Kolte is hiding something
that only I know of.

1501
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,640
He's playing you guys.

1502
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:41,080
-Have you gone nuts? Ignore him.
-Just a minute.

1503
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:46,720
Talk.

1504
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:50,280
I'll tell you, sir.

1505
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:55,160
I'm just a common man
and what good am I here?

1506
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:58,240
My work and identity are both common.

1507
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,640
My name's not common,
it's Nandan.

1508
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:03,520
But what kind of name is that?
It's so ordinary.

1509
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:06,720
And if your name is ordinary,
your career is ordinary too.

1510
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:10,440
And if your name and career are ordinary
then you are worthless.

1511
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,280
And worthless people are easily
taken advantage of.

1512
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:16,480
And then they say, "Use and discard."

1513
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:26,120
But what does Kolte
have to do with this?

1514
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:29,640
I haven't thought that through.

1515
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,120
Rajan, go get him.

1516
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,560
Kolte sir, I'm here!

1517
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:58,000
Who's man are you?
Omar or Bala's?

1518
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:59,960
I'm Lata's man!

1519
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:19,760
Abdul!

1520
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:15,280
Give me the magazine.

1521
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,720
The magazine.

1522
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:36,520
Nandan, where are you?
Are you alright?

1523
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:39,920
I'm fine, Lata. How's Aayush?

1524
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,600
Come back home quickly.

1525
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:45,840
I'm coming, Lata.

1526
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,600
I just want to sleep in peace.

1527
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,840
I'm tired of running after this money.

1528
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,160
It's pointless.

1529
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:01,480
I've seen it reduced to ashes
in front of my eyes.

1530
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:05,240
You were right, Lata.

1531
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:07,440
It's a curse.

1532
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:12,640
We'll go back to our old lives, Lata.

1533
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:16,280
Aayush, you and I.
We'll go to the beach.

1534
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:19,320
Eat Chinese. Simple things.

1535
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,360
Money became my obsession.

1536
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:31,680
But, if there's no life,
what good is an obsession?

1537
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,520
Nandan, are you there?

1538
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:42,280
Nandan?

1539
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,920
I'll call later.

1540
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:45,600
Later?

1541
02:05:54,760 --> 02:06:00,000
For the last time... whose bag
and mango boxes are these?

1542
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:05,960
It's a very safe place, sir.

1543
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:08,360
It's our village.
Don't worry.

1544
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,240
Hello.

1545
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:25,600
Sir, you are Patil sahab, right?

1546
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:32,240
See I told you... he's Patil sahab.
