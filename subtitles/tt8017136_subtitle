1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,084
<i>The human brain is remarkable.</i>

2
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:08,564
<i>For nine years
I thought I'd lost my watch</i>

3
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:10,843
<i>cos I can't remember
which wrist it's on.</i>

4
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:12,843
<i>And yet, after two weeks,</i>

5
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:18,565
<i>the things that scared me at first,
catheters, chest tubes, IVs...</i>

6
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:21,025
<i>Everything has started to click.</i>

7
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:26,041
Are you?
lf you have time to listen to music,

8
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,211
then l assume you have time
to finish your paperwork.

9
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,565
Keep moving.

10
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,706
<i>That work day
started like every other.</i>

11
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:11,079
- How's it goin'?
- l'm a 37-year-old janitor.

12
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:12,537
How d'you think it's going?

13
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:15,197
There is nothing wrong
with being a janitor.

14
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:19,758
Really? Thank you,
you've turned my life around.

15
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:24,318
l'll tell my janitor wife and all our
janitor kids that life is worth living.

16
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:28,957
And that comes straight from our hero,
Dr Whozits, Dr Nothing.

17
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,541
No, seriously, come on.

18
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:34,757
Come over to my humble house and
point out things that are cheap.

19
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:37,635
<i>Luckily, I had the night off to regroup.</i>

20
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:43,597
- That dog is creepy.
- Be nice to Rowdy.

21
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,225
The guy we bought him from kept
him in a box full of old hats.

22
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,075
Why is she here all the time?

23
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:56,636
- Just give her a chance, man.
- You want to hit that.

24
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,137
- No!
- Yeah!

25
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:01,035
She's just a friend.

26
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:05,956
lt's healthy, hanging out with a girl
without the ultimate goal being sex.

27
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:09,375
- You know?
- l'm not following.

28
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:14,994
Creepy. l had a run-in
with that nurse, Carla.

29
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,475
She forgot to check the stats
on a patient and gave me attitude.

30
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,268
Did you tell on her?

31
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:23,904
- Who's responsible for this?
- She is.

32
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,795
l don't remember.
Why do you assume it was my fault?

33
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:32,154
<i>It'd be a good point, except Elliot
puts her foot in her mouth.</i>

34
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:35,033
<i>A lot.
She can't really seem to stop.</i>

35
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:38,634
Just because l occasionally
say something stupid doesn't mean

36
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:44,097
l go door-to-door annoying people,
like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.

37
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:46,646
- You're not?
- No.

38
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,318
My mother is.

39
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:54,113
He's black, too.
You should tease him about that.

40
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:58,233
<i>I'm doing better with new people.
Like Carla, for instance.</i>

41
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:01,527
Bambi, that blonde stick
you hang out with? Tell her...

42
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:08,111
You might have to
write that down for me.

43
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:11,872
<i>And Dr Cox. We've really connected.
I'm kind of like his protégé.</i>

44
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:15,472
- l need to see his chart...
- Done, copied and highlighted.

45
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:19,476
Unfortunately, radar,
l'm fresh out of gold stars.

46
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,231
Multilobar pneumonia at 31 .
How much does he smoke?

47
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,983
l don't know.

48
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:28,119
lt's your attention to detail
that impresses me most.

49
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:33,070
- How many packs a day, genius?
- Half a pack.

50
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,071
l'm sorry.
l phrased the question wrong.

51
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,510
How many packs a day, really?

52
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,509
Eleven.

53
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,709
You don't know where l'm coming from.

54
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,962
Two or three packs.

55
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,507
Let's hear it.

56
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,054
l don't smoke so... Zero packs.

57
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:54,425
What tests have you ordered?

58
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,390
l was just...
l was totally kidding with you.

59
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,589
He was. We're all in on it.

60
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,229
<i>I like Will. That makes this harder.</i>

61
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:06,469
l ordered blood cultures
and a high-resolution CT.

62
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:09,180
What are you looking for?

63
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:11,993
Cancer.

64
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:15,668
<i>When you say ''cancer, ''
every person reacts the same way.</i>

65
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:18,295
<i>- Excellent.
- Not like that.</i>

66
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:21,606
<i>There it is.</i>

67
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:26,988
<i>I never know what to say to
Turk's buddies. But I'm getting better.</i>

68
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:28,781
So...

69
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,547
- How's surgery?
- lt rocks.

70
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:36,227
But my bedroom, that's where
l really operate. Am l right?

71
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:40,146
<i>- Come on, show Todd some love!
- I hate showing Todd love.</i>

72
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:45,227
Bambi, why are you slumming
with these scalpel jocks?

73
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:48,439
Please, baby.
This here's the VlP table.

74
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,800
Why don't you
sit your fine self down?

75
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,227
''Baby, this here's the VlP table...''

76
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,626
l'm not really interested in her.

77
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:04,589
Then the Todd'll show
that little biscuit some love.

78
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:10,105
<i>Maybe he's a bit interested.</i>

79
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:13,608
Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.

80
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,185
l'm going to ask Carla out.

81
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:22,145
- l think the janitor's out to get me.
- Thank you so much for your help.

82
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,224
Why not be a bit more paranoid?

83
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:27,103
- Wait, Turk...
- That's him.

84
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:34,746
Hi, how are you?

85
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:39,424
l need David Farr's chart.

86
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,864
We all need lots of things.

87
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:44,903
Great. Dr Kelso?
You're the Chief of Medicine.

88
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:48,544
ls there a special way
to communicate with nursing staff?

89
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:52,713
Sugar won't work.
They're already so sweet.

90
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:57,183
Now, listen,
Dr Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is,

91
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,623
you tattled yesterday, l responded.

92
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:03,344
l feel closer to you than ever.
But the ramifications are yours.

93
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:07,542
Don't drag me into your pathetic,
whiny, little squabble

94
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:11,183
with that bunch of malcontents.
l hope you all kill each other.

95
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,310
Have a great day, ladies.

96
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:19,302
l hate this place.

97
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:22,342
Dr Cox, l got Will's CT results back.

98
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,221
No cancer.
So what shall l tell him?

99
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,848
l'd open with that.

100
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:30,462
He's headed down such a bad road,
maybe we could talk to him...

101
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:34,501
<i>When you have a mentor, you understand
the meaning behind their words.</i>

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,902
<i>- You do whatever you want.
- Means ''Great idea''.</i>

103
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:40,860
l'm just happy
you haven't messed up yet today.

104
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,781
<i>Means ''You're really
coming along as a doctor''.</i>

105
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:48,744
<i>- Don't ever touch me.
- Means ''Don't ever touch him''.</i>

106
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,666
Just thought it was a nice moment.

107
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,108
- l don't wanna.
- Come on.

108
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,459
Carla, l shouldn't have
told Dr Kelso on you.

109
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,961
No, you shouldn't have.

110
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,460
<i>Comfortable silences.</i>

111
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,796
But thank you for apologising.

112
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,578
Good.

113
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,831
- l wanna make one thing clear.
- Nothing needs to be clear.

114
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,179
l still think you were in the wrong.

115
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:26,934
Checking orthostatics is your job.
l need to know you'll take care of it.

116
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:30,188
That's all l'm saying.

117
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,761
There. All better.

118
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:39,097
As of now,
you have no signs of cancer.

119
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:41,458
Who rules? Will rules.

120
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,898
This isn't great news.

121
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,698
Are you sure?
That's how it first hit me.

122
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,777
You're on a slippery slope.

123
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,577
<i>I had to scare him but
I sensed he'd heard it before.</i>

124
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,817
<i>Part of being a doctor
is your ability to improvise.</i>

125
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:58,154
Right now, the one thing
l want you to think about...

126
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,817
<i>How would you like to sound like this?</i>

127
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:04,902
Let me see.

128
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:10,095
<i>- This is so cool.
- No, it's not.</i>

129
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:13,432
<i>- Biddy, biddy, biddy.
- lt's not a toy.</i>

130
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,016
<i>Would you like to play a game?</i>

131
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,536
<i>Sometimes,
if all you have is old words,</i>

132
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:22,696
<i>all you can do is
hope they say something new.</i>

133
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,896
Look, man. You're a great patient.

134
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,415
l like you enough
to hope l never see you again.

135
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:31,251
But if you keep smoking,
you'll be back here.

136
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:34,820
l bet my own life on that.

137
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:44,052
<i>Dr Reid to Room 402, then down
to 20 1, then back up to Room 403.</i>

138
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,013
l'm nervous, man.

139
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:56,654
l'm your wing man.
l will not leave your side.

140
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,448
- Hey, baby.
- Keep moving, frat boy.

141
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:05,215
- Come on. Out with it.
- Don't rush me.

142
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:06,924
l mean...

143
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:11,270
You shouldn't be impatient
with the opportunity of a lifetime.

144
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:17,801
l'm gonna sit down because
you're so sexy? My knees are weak.

145
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:19,997
Really?

146
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:22,093
Dr Cox?
l know l'm being annoying,

147
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:24,533
but l'm getting used
to talking to patients.

148
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,373
This is why l became a doctor, right?

149
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:30,853
l heard, ''l know l'm being
annoying'' and then white noise.

150
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:33,572
Will, l got him to quit smoking.

151
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:37,092
For ever? No last one?
The last ones are better than sex.

152
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:39,172
Trust me, l've had 1 ,000 of them.

153
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:43,343
Done forever, he swore to me.
l reached him. l reached him.

154
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,591
You're having a big day, there, Susan.

155
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,336
Private party.

156
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,291
<i>Gotta get right back on the horse.</i>

157
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,370
- Dr Cox, about Will.
- Not now!

158
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,206
l've a 1 0-minute break
and my soap is on.

159
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,850
Hey, Skeech, if you go ahead
and change the channels,

160
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:20,090
l swear l'll suture
your hands together.

161
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,330
- Right. So with Will...
- This woman is just fantastic.

162
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:28,010
The breasts are probably fake
but by God, those tears are real.

163
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:30,553
<i>Time for a bold move.</i>

164
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,169
How are we gonna fix this Will thing?

165
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:41,128
Do you know what you've just done?

166
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,568
You just lost all lapdog privileges.

167
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:46,769
- Excuse me?
- No more walkies, no more treats,

168
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,008
no more following me around.

169
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,568
- l'm not your lapdog.
- You back there.

170
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:54,848
What do we do with lapdogs
who can't behave in the house?

171
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,928
Make them stay outside?

172
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,568
You have five seconds
to get out of this room,

173
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,928
or l'm gonna start whacking you
on the nose with this.

174
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:05,527
Don't laugh, this isn't a joke. Get out.

175
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:08,030
- But l was thinking...
- Go!

176
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,366
What do you want to watch?

177
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,202
<i>- Days of our Lives?
- Attaboy.</i>

178
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,412
Come in.

179
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:26,291
He smells the food.

180
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:29,651
Move your butt.

181
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,378
Peace offering?

182
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:37,687
l know l don't always
make the best first impression.

183
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:39,813
Or second, for that matter.

184
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:45,126
l'd like us to be friends. l thought
l could get to know you a bit better.

185
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,544
See what you're about.

186
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,805
For instance,
when did you meet Morgan Freeman?

187
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,099
That's my mom.

188
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,582
l like her freckles.

189
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,432
Rowdy, no!

190
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:06,963
l can't figure out why
Dr Cox tore me a new one today.

191
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:09,604
Enough already! He's a jerk.

192
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:12,204
- He's a jerk.
- He's a jerk.

193
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,804
- He's a jerk.
- You're a jerk.

194
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:17,923
He's just Dr Cox.
He's always like that.

195
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,723
Who really knows him?
Who does he hang out with?

196
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:23,283
<i>- No one.
- That must be lonely.</i>

197
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:26,964
''Take two Turks as needed,
apply to sensitive areas...''

198
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:29,042
Who wrote this?

199
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:30,295
Whassup?

200
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:38,365
Come on, Carla. Give me one good reason
why you won't go out with me.

201
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:41,522
You're a surgeon,
so you got the God complex,

202
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,802
the ''married to the job'' thing.

203
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:46,162
You're cute,
but you're very aware of it.

204
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:50,403
You've no idea what l'm like, so your
feelings for me come from down there.

205
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:53,482
But most of all,
l'm looking for the real thing.

206
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:57,842
You're nothing but a little boy
who's not used to being told ''No''.

207
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:01,923
So there's a bunch of reasons.
Pick your favourite.

208
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:04,681
l'd go with the God complex.

209
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,721
But it's hard to choose.
They're all so good.

210
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,002
<i>A hospital is a tricky place.</i>

211
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:12,961
<i>It's very cliquey
and you have to watch what you say.</i>

212
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,921
<i>It's a lot like high school.</i>

213
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,879
<i>If I didn't have
somewhere else to be,</i>

214
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,298
<i>I would have gone
and sat with her.</i>

215
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:48,203
<i>But tonight, there's somebody
else I have to take care of.</i>

216
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,799
l know watching Will
kill himself hurts you, too.

217
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,278
lt's harder if you have
no one to talk with.

218
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,079
So l figured l'd pick up
a few cold ones, right?

219
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,080
And you and l, we'll talk it out,
we'll just break the whole thing down.

220
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,957
Right? What do you say to that?

221
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:17,198
Everyone keeps ignoring me.
l'm like a plague around here.

222
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,398
Don't look at me
when you're talking.

223
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:23,958
Dr Reid. l just wanted to say,
you're out of my doghouse.

224
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:27,638
That was a great catch
on that patient with meningococcus.

225
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:31,317
That actually wasn't me.
Carla noticed the rash on his legs.

226
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:34,797
You could have been
back into my good graces

227
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:37,676
and instead you passed
the credit on to a nurse.

228
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:42,517
How noble. l tell you what,
l'll get the cafeteria staff to write

229
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:45,144
''Was it worth it?''
on a big cake for you.

230
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:50,792
''...station''.
This is the nurses' station.

231
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:58,316
- Do you think l've damaged ligaments?
- l don't care.

232
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:02,316
Now, can l count on you
to never drop by here again?

233
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:04,395
Or shall l just move?

234
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:07,835
You can't leave a place
with this much warmth.

235
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:12,506
l especially love this shelf filled with
photos of your friends and family.

236
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:16,836
<i>If he comes at you,
just try and roll out the door.</i>

237
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:19,922
Actually, you have a point.

238
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:24,194
l guess watching the game
by yourself with a Scotch

239
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:27,865
isn't really the only way
to watch a game.

240
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:34,875
lt's just that... l've always thought
of needing people as a sign of weakness.

241
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,674
- lt's not.
- Well, then...

242
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:40,993
Would you stay and
watch the game with me?

243
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:43,329
Maybe have a slice of pizza?

244
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:47,468
- Of course l will.
- l can braid your hair.

245
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:52,993
l know the couch isn't very deep,
but we could move the back cushion

246
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,078
and spoon.

247
00:16:56,273 --> 00:16:59,793
Hey, you guys, what do you say?
Beer and chips in the back.

248
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,952
Just ignore them.

249
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,232
Tell me the answer to this question.

250
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,777
Do you want to be the big spoon
or the little spoon?

251
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,872
Kelso didn't ask her,
she gave you full credit.

252
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:16,591
l don't care. Too little too late.
Plus, l know why you're really here.

253
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,232
So l'm gonna plop myself
right here in the VlP section,

254
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:23,232
so you can give me what you got.

255
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:26,471
l was gonna tell you
how l busted JD's chops the other day

256
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,710
for wanting to be friends with a girl.

257
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,950
And now l find it so amazing
to see how strong you are,

258
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,030
how well you carry yourself,

259
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,351
how l'd give anything to wake up
and watch you read the paper.

260
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,390
But instead l think you should
hop off your broom,

261
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,551
remember what it was like
when you first started here

262
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:50,515
and give Elliot a break. Because she may
be a chore but she is a good person.

263
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,750
And your ass is especially fine today.

264
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,790
Pick me up tomorrow at seven.

265
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,030
She's not the only one
who can do a speech. l can do a speech.

266
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,825
Return that umbrella to me at
the hospital. Not here. ls that clear?

267
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:11,108
And, Newbie...

268
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,829
- Know what your problem is?
- My bones hurt?

269
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:18,459
You were gonna rescue me from loneliness
with a $3 six-pack of light beer?

270
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:22,748
lt turns out we can't
save people from themselves.

271
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:26,468
We just treat 'em. Treat that kid
with a respiratory problem

272
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:29,868
and when he comes back with cancer,
go ahead and treat that.

273
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:33,427
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

274
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:37,027
Smokers, drinkers, druggies,
fatties, whatever.

275
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:42,658
lf you keep living and dying on whether
or not a person changes, well...

276
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,690
You're not gonna make it as a doctor.

277
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:53,734
Now come here and give me a hug.
lt's OK, come here.

278
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,320
Get outta here!

279
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,426
Take this piss water with you.
lt's embarrassing.

280
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:05,107
- l'll drink it!
- l'll take the beer. You'll beat it.

281
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:07,305
- You apologise.
- No, l don't wanna.

282
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:11,906
OK, come on. Just do it really fast.
Like a Band-Aid.

283
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:15,947
l wrote out the pharmacy renewals
on all your patients.

284
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,783
Great. You know what else
would be helpful?

285
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:24,626
<i>The one thing we never
stop looking for is acceptance.</i>

286
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,945
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome.

287
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:29,384
<i>Acceptance of our own shortcomings.</i>

288
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,464
- So when's the baby due?
- What baby?

289
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:36,105
<i>Acceptance that some things
are gonna be what they're gonna be.</i>

290
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:39,665
This is a strange resort.
The wheelchair service is great

291
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:42,864
but that suite l rented,
there was another person in it.

292
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:46,868
- And the bellhop gave me an enema.
- Yeah, he's new here.

293
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,858
So...

294
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:56,035
- Anything you wanna say?
- You know it all, man.

295
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:59,183
<i>Still, I hated Will a little</i>

296
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:01,944
<i>cos I looked at people
who are important to me</i>

297
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,222
<i>in terms of what
will probably kill them.</i>

298
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:06,343
<i>Heart disease.</i>

299
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:08,543
<i>Liver disease.</i>

300
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,837
<i>Somebody choking her.</i>

301
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:14,463
<i>I don't know.</i>

302
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,548
<i>Probably stress.</i>

303
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:23,822
- Say anything else to him?
- No.

304
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,901
But you wanted to.

305
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,781
- You told me not to.
- Would you be a man?

306
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:32,618
Stick to your convictions
or you'll never make it as a doctor.

307
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:39,821
l can't believe your head exploded.

308
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,541
lf it does,
you'll never make it as a doctor.

309
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,960
l mean, come on.
You look ridiculous.
