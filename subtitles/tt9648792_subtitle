00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,520
Yesterday I narrated
Jhansi Rani's story for my baby

3
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,800
Today I'll tell you the story of Casabianca

4
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Dad, who is Casabianca?

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,040
Casabianca was the son
of a ship's captain in France

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,600
He was a very smart boy

7
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,960
One day, just like you, he was
adamant to go out with his father

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,120
He went out with his father on the ship

9
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,600
When they were sailing happily
viewing the nature's beauty...

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640
Suddenly the enemy countries
fleets rounded up their ship...

11
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,000
and started attacking
them with guns and tanks

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,600
Oh no! Then, what happened?

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,880
Struck by bullets, their ship caught fire

14
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,600
Immediately his father took him
to a safe spot on the deck and...

15
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,560
he told him not to move
from that place until he orders him

16
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,480
Then his father left to save others

17
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
Oh no!

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,480
Eventually everyone started to escape
in the small boats attached to the ship

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,840
When those men escaped,
they asked Casabianca to join them

20
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,880
What did Casabianca do?

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,840
He refused to move from that place
until his dad tells him to do so

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,480
Poor boy didn't knew that his father was shot
and lying dead in the basement of the ship

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,880
Slow and steady the fire was catching up

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,200
Finally a huge bomb struck the ship and it
drowned, taking down Casabianca along with it

25
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Dear...

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Dear, are you asleep?

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,160
Come on, dad! If I was in his place, I'd
have shot everyone and save my father!

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
My dear brave heart!

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,880
Fine...

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
you got school tomorrow, isn't it?

31
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,120
Now, sleep

Quick, you got only two minutes

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,480
Fine. You eat first

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,720

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,920
Ok?

- Excuse me
- Yes?

64
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,320
So your name is Ganesan?
Then what's Vaanakar?

65
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,600
Manufacturing crackers is our family
business hence we're addressed as Vaanakar

66
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
Oh! I see

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
See you, dad

68
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
- See you, uncle
- Ok. Take care

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,880
- See you, uncle
- Ok

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
How about a movie this Sunday?

71
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,320
We got lot to study

72
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
This school routine is boring

73
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
Go home and even
my aunt reaches home late

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,160
Come to school and all these tests and
special classes are too exhausting

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
So, what's your point?

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,760
Back in Bangalore things were so happening

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,120
Happening pubs and parties in weekend.
It rocks!

78
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,160
Your mom transferred you here
because you were weak in studies

79
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,920
At least now you got to
focus on studies

80
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,320
I'll come to your home on Sunday.
We'll study together

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
I have leaked this
question paper only to you

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,840
So, take your time and
write the answers properly

83
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
You must be the first
rank holder this time

84
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Ok, mom

85
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,920
Stop studying too much.
Just close the book

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,480
- Ms. Fullhands, are you well prepared?
- Get lost!

Dear students, good morning

92
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,160
Hope you all have prepared well

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,400
Consider this quarterly exam as your
public exam and give your best, sincerely

94
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,000
Study well and everyone
can score good marks

95
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,840
- Thank you, ma'am
- God bless you children

96
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
All of you can now
go to your exam hall

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,920

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,760
Thank you, ma'am

101
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,520
What do you want to
become when you grow up?

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
A doctor?

103
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
An engineer?

104
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
Or an IAS officer?

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,760
I wish to become a doctor
specialized in child delivery

106
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,640
Oh! Why that in particular?

107
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
Well miss, my mother passed away
when I was born

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,480
At that moment she asked my
dad to take good care of me

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,720
Hence my dad wants me
to study well and become a doctor

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,040
He said I must ensure that what happened
to me shouldn't happen to anyone else

111
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,400
Hello?

112
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,480
It's me, driver Mani

113
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
What do you mean?
I'm the auto-rickshaw driver

114
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,120
Remember, you owe me some money.
Can you give it to me now?

115
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,880
The rickshaw is
running out of petrol

116
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,760
What do you mean by you're busy?

117
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,840
Ask your money back and
everyone will be busy

118
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,960
The applications for Group IV in
Tamil Nadu, will be issued next month

119
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
Mani...

120
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,800
Clear tenth grade and anyone
can earn up to Rs. 10,000/-

121
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,080
Only if you clear, right?
I failed ninth grade

122
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
Read me some other news

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,560
IAS exam results are out

124
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,280
This time the number of students
from Tamil Nadu is very less

125
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,520
Give it a break. Always keeps
reading about education

126
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,000
What's the use? You are still
an auto-rickshaw driver, right?

127
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,120
Instead why don't you read cinema
news and fortune predictions?

128
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,880
Taurus
Will find tough to earn money

129
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,880
My sun sign, what else can I expect?

130
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,280
- Listen!
- What?

131
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,560
Check the prediction
for my sun sign

132
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,560
Yours is Virgo, right?

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,360
- It must be all about women in your life
- Look here

134
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,600
You will have a great week ahead

135
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,400
You will earn a lot of money

136
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,520
Love will find you

137
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,680
Dude, sounds strange!
This usually never happens to you

138
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,880
Now that the car guy
did this to her...

139
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,960
- Senthil! No! Senthil!
- Where are you off to?

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Injustice towards women and
our hero will step up!

141
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
Do you think you're riding a plane?

142
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,560
You!

143
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,520
- It's paining, mom
- Hold on, dear. Just a little more time

144
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,600
Just hold on

145
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,000
- Please, drive faster
- Go! Go! Fast!

146
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,080
Roshni

147
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,560
Kowsi, you're early

148
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,800
Hey, this is Vinoth

149
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,160
He is also in the 12th grade

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
Oh

151
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,160
Hi

152
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,400
Hey, he is just a friend

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,320
He is also weak in Math. Hence I invited
him over since you'll be coming to help me

154
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,400
Fine, I'll leave now

155
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,440
So, that was a good start

156
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,440
Kowsh, you teach really well

157
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,840
I hope I can call you Kowsh

158
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,240
I'm just beginning to get hold of
this math. How about tomorrow?

159
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,120
Only if time permits.
Bye

160
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
This Vaanakar is getting on my nerves

161
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,960
What did he do?

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
He gets all the school trips

163
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,720
Also, he gets my trips
from the Rickshaw stand

164
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
He earns a lot yet he never thought
of even buying us a single tea

165
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,400
Calm down. Some day he'll be in a mess
and will need our help. Then he'll know

166
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
Yeah right! Duh!

167
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Today morning, you just stepped aside
and he snatched away a trip of yours

168
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,720
This is not fair. Let him know

169
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,920
Tell me, why don't
we get school trips?

170
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Every month we can earn
good if we get some

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,280
You're right

172
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,640
School trips are mainly arranged
by parents of young girls

173
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Why would they prefer
rickshaw with young drivers?

174
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,960
These pancakes are really tasty

175
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,720
Ask me if you want more.
Don't try to flatter me

176
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I'm serious. It's tasty

177
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,520
Everyone learns cooking
from their mother

178
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,760
But me? I got it from my dad

179
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
Yeah right!

180
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,680
Like he is the best chef in Mayavaram

181
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,840
And she got the skills from him!

182
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,040
There are people doing the catering
business in a grand manner

183
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,760
And he still follows
the traditional old way

184
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,280
Poor man

185
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,880
Fine. Ask if they have arranged
the money for my vehicle's FC

186
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,360
Why? Ask yourself

187
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
He won't talk to us

188
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,160
From where do we arrange Rs.
20,000/- in short span?

189
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,280
Dad hasn't got any catering
orders for the past two weeks

190
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,080
Can't he wait for a week?

191
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,800
To hell with your food!

192
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,520
Why do you show your
anger on the food?

193
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,640
Uncle, no toy for me yet?

194
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,080
That's his nature

195
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,560
If he wants something, he won't talk
and he'll starve until it's done

196
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,880
Right! He is the reason behind it

197
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,480
He pampered his son a lot

198
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
He asks for one candy
and he'll buy him ten

199
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,320
She completed her degree. She even
had to walk all the way to college

200
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,120
I obliged to all his requests but he
didn't even complete his tenth grade

201
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
For all the money I spent on
him, I could have got her a job

202
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,760
But now? I got her married to a guy who
turned out to be a drunkard and useless

203
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
We are struggling now

204
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Which standard are you studying?

205
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,360
Eight grade

206
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,680
Fine, tell me who is
your education minister?

207
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,280
- I don't know
- You don't know?

208
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,240
Fine, who is our country's president?

209
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,880
- Escape!
- Come on now

210
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,440
Ok, I'll ask you an easier question

211
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,840
Who wrote our national anthem?

212
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,160
You're asking us tough questions!

213
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
You are in the sixth grade...

214
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,840
- don't you know even this one?
- Not in the sixth grade but eight!

215
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,760
Eight grade?

216
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,000
- Bro...
- What's up?

217
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,480
He is torturing the kids

218
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,880
Come on, now. Don't you know what
they'll know and what they won't?

219
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,720
Watch me mow

220
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,680
Who is Thala and who is Thalapathy?

221
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,240
This is a walk in the park.
Actor Ajith and Actor Vijay!

222
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Even my little brother knows it!

223
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,840
Why do you want to spoil
their mood in the morning?

224
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,840
Guys, leave. Run!

225
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,400
- Come, let's escape
- Keeps pestering the kids with his quiz

226
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,040
Senthil, we need a change
in our education system

227
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,600
The problem is that we don't
know any relevant stuff

228
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,200
And we are well versed
at the irrelevant stuffs

229
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,800
Stop it with your philosophy

230
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm starving

231
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
Why did you take off
in a such speed?

232
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,920
Someone splashes mud on you and
you expect me to be quiet?

233
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,600
I gave him left and right!

234
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,360
Why would someone make
an issue out of this?

235
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,280
I wonder what emergency they had

236
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,720
No way! We shouldn't
budge so easy

237
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,200
Today they'll splash mud on you

238
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,840
In future they might run you over

239
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,680
Why do you take the bus?

240
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,280
I cross your home
everyday on my way here

241
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,520
Start a bit early and
you can come with me

242
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,640
I shall drop you off
right in front of the shop

243
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,840
It's ok.
Thank you

244
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,960
Here

245
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,760
- I don't have change
- I knew it!

246
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,480
That's ok. I'll keep coming

247
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,800
You raise hell
at home and flirt here?

248
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,000
- God bless you!
- Jealous fellow!

249
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,120
Just a minute

250
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,680
Please don't do it again

251
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,320
Oh, come on now. Do you think I would be
quiet if it had happened to my loved ones?

252
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,720
This is a silly issue

253
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,960
Please feel free
to ask me any help

254
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,840
What's with these boxes?

255
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,320
I'm waiting for the owner to
keep them inside. They are heavy

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,040
No!

257
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,040
Come on! I can't take anymore!

258
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,760
Kowsi...

259
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
What happened, Kowsi?

260
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,000
Are you not feeling well?

261
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,480
So Kowsalya, looks
like your HM's pet

262
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,120
Is it because you came first
in the tenth grade? That was just a fluke

263
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,040
Let's see how you fare
in the 12th grade

264
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,640
Before that see if you can get
the first rank in this quarterly exam

265
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,600
Ms.Malini?

266
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,240
Vaishnavi who always comes
second, she is her mom, right?

267
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,320
Let me tell you
a story of a froglet

268
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,720
A froglet made up its mind
to climb a tall mountain

269
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,560
Other froglets and frogs warned it
saying 'Don't do it. You'll fall'

270
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,600
They kept repeating 'You'll get hurt
if you fall and you can't do it'

271
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,760
But the froglet didn't mind any of that
and made the journey and reached the top

272
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,200
That's when everyone realized...

273
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,720
- The froglet was hearing impaired
- Exactly!

274
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,880
How many times will you
repeat the same story?

275
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,640
Only if we avoid the critics
we can reach our destiny

276
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,440
So, stop feeling bad
for such silly things

277
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
Go, wash your face and
change your dress

278
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,280
Let's have dinner

279
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,280
Ms. Mary...

280
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Ms. Mary

281
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,960
'Operation Ward
Tamil Nadu Health Scheme, Mayiladuthurai'

282
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,520
Excuse me, brother

283
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
- Senthil...
- Mani...Come in

284
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,040
What happened? What's with
the plaster on the leg?

285
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,840
A dog jumped in front
while I was driving

286
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,320
The rickshaw toppled

287
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,200
What did the doctor say?

288
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,400
Looks like there is
a hairline fracture

289
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,480
I have been advised to
take three weeks of rest

290
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,800
Make it five week because
health is what matters the most

291
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
Shut up!

292
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,680
Please let us know
if you need any help

293
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,000
Can anyone of you take fill in for
me and take care of the school trips

294
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Shall I?

295
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,760
I'll take care of it

296
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,240
Listen...

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,880
it's like letting a wolf work
at your sheep farm. Careful

298
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,000
The doctor is coming for rounds.
Visitors please wait outside

299
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,960
Ok then...

300
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,120
Let's leave

301
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,000
Senthil...

302
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,560
Yes?

303
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Young girls and their
parents trust us

304
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,000
It's getting late. Please leave

305
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,480
- Careful Senthil
- You...

306
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,720
Keep him in here for two months

307
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,120
Just hear me out

308
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,600
- You know Nalini in B section
- Come on, study now

309
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,040
Please, just hear me out.
Guys, check this out

310
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,840
What is it?

311
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,080
She seems to be in
love with a guy

312
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,600
Even after he declined her proposal,
she kept going behind him

313
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,720
Guess what he did

314
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
He went and told her dad about it

315
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,880
Oh God!
Then?

316
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,120
Her father gave her
the thrashing of her life

317
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,480
What do you mean?

318
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,240
She is a very silent girl

319
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,920
She's not a silent
but a violent girl

320
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,800
She was so furious that she wanted
to attack that boy with acid

321
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,520
My bus is here.
Come, let's start

322
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,160
- Bye
- Bye

323
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,040
Bye

324
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,440
She'll apply makeup
when she gets in the bus

325
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,320
Quick!

326
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,120
I pity her father. He toils
hard as watchman in our school

327
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,720
And look what she is up to

328
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,440
I don't care if she applies
the makeup or not...

329
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,560
but why is she allowed
to wear full hands?

330
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,840
Looks like she has some kind of allergy

331
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
She got special permission from
HM ma'am to wear full hands

332
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,720
Just leave it, guys

333
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,080
She is hiding something.
I'll find it out

334
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,760
- Come Muthu, let's leave. Bye
- Bye

335
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,080
- Bye
- Bye

336
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,600
Where's our auto-rickshaw?

337
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,280
Dear, a guy was here in
auto-rickshaw to pick you up

338
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,680
Excuse me!

339
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,000
Kowsalya?

340
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,120
Just a minute

341
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,720
Vaanakar?

342
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,800
Wait, I'll give it to her

343
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,000
Vaankar is on the line

344
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,440
Hello

345
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,360
Fine. Ok uncle. You take
care of your health

346
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,680
Hello

347
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,440
You! Beware and stay safe!

348
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,960
Who the hell are you?

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,760
It doesn't matter who I am

350
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,640
If I see you stalking Malliga
and you'll be done for!

351
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Listen, I'll stalk Malliga
and Monica etc...

352
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Who are you to stop me?
Have some guts and come face to face

353
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,720
What a wuss!

354
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,560
What's happening Anthony Sami?

355
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,840
She failed twice in tenth grade
yet we took her in for your sake

356
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,720
Don't you monitor if she is
concentrating on studies?

357
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,400
I work here throughout

358
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,520
I mean I'm here even on weekends

359
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,880
Then how can I monitor her?

360
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,280
She is very weak in studies

361
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,840
She's got really low marks

362
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,560
Prema...

363
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
No! No!

364
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,880
Ms. Full hand Prema!

365
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,840
Isn't that how your
friends address you?

366
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,360
Lose focus on fashion and
focus more on studies

367
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,560
Why are you crying now?

368
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,600
Wipe those tears

369
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,000
- Anthony Sami
- Ma'am?

370
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,120
Until her exams are over, you don't
have to work on Saturdays and Sundays

371
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,920
Ok ma'am

372
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,960
So please, make her study
and yes, don't scold her

373
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Ok ma'am

374
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
We all are advising for your good

375
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,400
Focus on studies

376
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
I work here and your mom works
as maid, only to educate you

377
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,960
Please go ahead, sir

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,640
All our struggles are for you, dear

379
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,040
So can't you concentrate on studies?

380
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,680
Ok dad

381
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
Here. You mind
your business, dad

382
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,800
- Greetings, sir
- Greetings

383
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,040
Have a seat

384
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,920
We now request Kowsalya, the district topper
in the tenth grade to come to the stage

385
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,120
Dad...

386
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,360
Dad

387
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,920
Dad, please agree
to what ma'am says

388
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,080
Kochi is too far, dear. On top of that
you're in 12th grade, must focus on studies

389
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,320
Accepting the prize in
person would make it special

390
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,440
You want me to score good marks in 12th grade,
right? I'll ensure that. Now agree to this

391
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,920
Well, dear...I mean...

392
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,200
Sir, please go in

393
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,000
- Greetings ma'am
- Greetings. Have a seat

394
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,480
I hope Kowsalya
would have told you

395
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Our organization has 30
schools all over India

396
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,560
For those who scored the first mark from
ninth to 12th grade in all these schools...

397
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,760
we organize a grand function in our
convent school in Kochi and reward them

398
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,960
Kowsalya will be rewarded
with two prizes this year

399
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,600
We'll hand over the prizes and
certificates here if she doesn't come

400
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,600
But if she goes there, it'll be
a good encouragement for her

401
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,160
Let her find some more
self-confidence and strength

402
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,680
Can the parents accompany?

403
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,840
Don't worry

404
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
We will take good care of her

405
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
Ok madam.
She'll come

406
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
I will send her.

407
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,240
How did your dad agree to this?

408
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
My dad will agree to
anything I ask for

409
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,920
'Kochi'

410
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,200
Students, quick! Get ready

411
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,320
Why is she still asleep?

412
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,960
She is down with fever, miss

413
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,000
Temperature seems to very high

414
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
Did you take any medicine?

415
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,680
Here, have this

416
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,000
Take rest. I'll come later
and take you to the function

417
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,920
Dad...

418
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,480
Dad!

419
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,360
Dad!

420
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,840
I missed you the moment you left

421
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,880
Hence, I followed you
immediately after you left

422
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,480
My father is my world

423
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:18,000
"I'm a like the feather in a breeze"

424
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,440
"Living on my own terms
but under your guidance"

425
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,440
"A father will hold your hands and lead
the way through toughest of conditions"

426
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,280
"My father is my God, who is by
my side and guards me all the time"

427
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,520
"I'm a like the feather in a breeze"

428
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,200
"Living on my own terms
but under your guidance"

429
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,880
Sir, look at your daughter's marks

430
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,680
Uncle, why didn't daddy come today?

431
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,000
You didn't study well
and played mischief

432
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Hence your dad didn't come today

433
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,680
So, you must study well. Got it?

434
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,040
- Greetings, miss
- Greetings, sir

435
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,440
What did you do? Kowsalya scored top marks
in all the subjects this time around

436
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
Surprising!

437
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
You have got fever, dad.
How about an injection?

438
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,480
I want you to study well
and become a doctor

439
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
Ok, daddy

440
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,040
"And you're the breeze that cools me
when the scorching heat exhausts me"

441
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,040
"As I slowly grow and understand you more,
all I have is only words of praises for you"

442
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,600
"When you smile, it rains in my world"

443
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,480
"Your love seed sown inside me
that keeps growing forever"

444
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,200
"You fill my heart
with happiness"

445
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,680
In happiness, sorrow,
victory and failure...

446
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,960
no matter what it is.
Just come over here

447
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,360
And our deity will handle it

448
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,240
It's just physiology

449
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
Every woman will go through it
after a certain age

450
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,560
If anything in school,
talk to your teacher

451
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,200
At home, share it either with
me or Ms. Mary. Don't feel shy

452
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,560
Don't be scared or
worried about it

453
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,400
Your only daughter.
Let's arrange a grand function

454
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,280
Which era are you living in?

455
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's not trouble her

456
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,320
No need of any function

457
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,840
"So far my world was filled with love"

458
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,400
"Even after I turned into a woman, you still
carry me like a child. Thanks for you love"

459
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,520
"Every time I miss my mother,
I think about you"

460
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,800
"No matter how far I go,
I'll always be by your side"

461
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,800
"Our bond only grows
stronger with time"

462
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,600
"I'm a like the feather in a breeze"

463
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,720
"Living on my own terms
but under your guidance"

464
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,040
Nice breeze

465
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,320
The town bus is too stuffy
to travel and with all that crowd...

466
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,200
To travel in bus full
of sweat stink...

467
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,560
Just nod...

468
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,400
every day I'll drop you

469
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,120
- What was that?
- Nothing

470
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,400
Did you read the poem I had
advertised on the auto-rickshaw?

471
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,160
"Scent of my lover,
runs all over me"

472
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
I don't know much poems

473
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,600
Soni!

474
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,560
- Where were you going?
- No where

475
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,040
Why are you dull?

476
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,320
Nothing, bro

477
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,280
Just tell me

478
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,080
Won't auto-rickshaw
drivers get brides?

479
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,440
What's the problem?

480
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
Tell me

481
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,760
What's the matter?

482
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,120
What's the secret between you both?

483
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,760
Do you think auto-rickshaw
driver is a cheap profession?

484
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Who says so?

485
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,960
No way

486
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,400
You're saying it
for the sake of it

487
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,560
Will you agree to marry
an auto-rickshaw driver?

488
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,480
Why not?

489
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
If I like him
then I'll marry him for sure

490
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,560
Want to know a secret?

491
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
When my parents met an astrologer
and checked my horoscope...

492
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,080
the astrologer said 'Your daughter will
marry someone you don't approve of'

493
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,840
'And chances are that she will
marry a guy in driving profession'

494
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,240
Ever since, wherever I go...

495
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,920
they keep spying on whom do I
talk to and what I'm up to

496
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,400
Guess what, it coincides with
the prediction for my horoscope

497
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Our astrologer says I'll be
successful in driving profession

498
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,160
Mark my words...

499
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,240
you will be highly successful
for the good heart you have

500
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,520
Hey Roshni...

501
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,440
Hi Kowsi! Come in

502
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,800
What's with the decoration?

503
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,800
Today's Vinoth's birthday

504
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,880
So what?

505
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,280
What do you mean?

506
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,200
Hi babies

507
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,600
- Hey, many more happy returns of the day, Vinoth
- Thank you Roshni

508
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,720
Happy birthday

509
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,480
Thank you

510
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,160
- The cake's ready? I'll come collect it
- Your wish is special

511
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,920
Vinoth, I'll cut the cake
for your birthday, today

512
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
- Sounds good?
- Hey Roshni! Roshni, I'm leaving

513
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,600
Wait for two minutes

514
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,960
Try to understand. I'm leaving

515
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,720
Can't you wait for two minutes?

516
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,240
I'll be back

517
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,240
I have something to tell you

518
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,640
Roshni is just a friend

519
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,320
I made up my mind the moment
I laid my eyes on you

520
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,400
I'm deeply in love with you

521
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,880
Vinoth!

522
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,960
Sorry!

523
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
I don't have such intentions

524
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,880
Don't make a hasty call, Kowsh

525
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,920
I am ready to do anything
for you. Just say it

526
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
I'm leaving

527
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,280
Kowsh, relax! Relax!

528
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,440
Cool

529
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,480
Fine...

530
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,120
You don't have to love me back

531
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,800
But please don't hurt
me on my birthday

532
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,240
Just wait for ten minutes

533
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,840
Leave after I cut the cake. Please

534
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,840
No, Vinoth

535
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,640
I don't have a good feeling about it.
I'm leaving

536
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,000
Can't you understand?

537
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,920
You won't get
a better guy than me!

538
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,360
You'll regret later

539
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,760
Hey! You better stay
in your limits!

540
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,440
I have no intention
of falling in love

541
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
Stop being so adamant

542
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,160
First, give way!

543
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
You think you can
force me to love you?

544
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,960
Stop showing off! If you leave
now, I won't spare you!

545
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,000
What will you do?

546
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,720
I'll morph dirty pictures with
your face and leak it on net

547
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,400
Trying doing that and
I'll do the same to you

548
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,480
When Drona requested, all Arjun could
focus was only the parrot's eye

549
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Similarly to achieve our goals,
we must focus only on those goals

550
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,240
Sir...

551
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,600
Give your order

552
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,000
- One chilly parotta for me
- Ok

553
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,160
Not parotta. It's not
good for health, dear

554
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,120
Come on, dad.
Once in a while, its fine

555
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,680
One chilly parotta for me
and Ragi dosa for my dad

556
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,400
Congrats sir.
I heard you got promoted as the HM

557
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,480
Had your food?

558
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,480
Let's talk in school tomorrow

559
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,480
Dad...

560
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,440
A guy says that he
is in love with me

561
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,960
Fine, what was your reply?

562
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
I gave him an earful

563
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,080
Never scold anyone out of haste

564
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,840
It's a dangerous world out there

565
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,720
Some issues must be dealt carefully

566
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Without scolding or hurting
him and in a soft manner...

567
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,040
you must explain him that this is
the age to study and nothing else

568
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,760
There is a lot of distance and
heights for this froglet to reach

569
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,520
If you find it difficult
to talk to that guy...

570
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,080
shall I talk to him?

571
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,880
It's ok, dad. I got this

572
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,320
Vishwanathan, Sri Nidhi, Harish,
Subbulakshmi, Ranganathan, Rajakumari

573
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,680
That's too many people
in your family, bro

574
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,680
If I do the same, then I must sell my
rickshaw and buy a truck. It's a long list

575
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,880
You are the only person
who can joke in a serious tone

576
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Forget me

577
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,280
Look at him

578
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,520
"Scent of my lover, runs all over me"

579
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,520
Look like a new proverb
on your rickshaw

580
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,920
So, next you're falling for Malliga?

581
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,600
Oh! Come on! She likes Senthil

582
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,280
How do you say that?

583
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,680
She gave hints the other day
when she came in his rickshaw

584
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,200
She said she'll marry a rickshaw
driver if she likes him

585
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Stop encouraging him

586
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,200
You have no idea about him.
I know since the first grade

587
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,360
Do you know
when he fell in love the first time?

588
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,600
You won't believe it. Back then
we were in the second grade

589
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,720
Meena teacher was our class teacher

590
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,520
She was very beautiful.
She never scolds the students

591
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,480
She used to care a lot for us

592
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,280
Our teacher hasn't turned up for
the past four days. The class is boring

593
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,120
Indeed. School is
boring without her

594
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,200
I'm thinking of marrying her

595
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,600
What do you mean?

596
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,760
Then I can be with her all the time

597
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,480
Then you must propose her!

598
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,280
That's all? I'll do it

599
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,440
No way. I'll also propose her

600
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,360
Only I'll propose to her!
Only me!

601
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,200
Stop! Let's not fight over it

602
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,360
Let's put a toss and decide

603
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,760
Spit side or plain?

604
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,680
- Spit side I win!
- Plain side I win!

605
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,920
It's plain side! Plain side!

606
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,240
I won! I won! Yay!

607
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,360
That's when we found out that
Meena teacher got married

608
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,960
And it was for her marriage
she took four days off

609
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,120
That was his first love failure

610
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,560
Bro! In second grade?
That too your teacher?

611
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,000
Man! You rock!

612
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
The list doesn't end there

613
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,200
Mythili in fourth grade

614
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
Geetha teacher in sixth grade

615
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,600
Monica in seventh grade

616
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,960
Janaki in the ninth grade

617
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,840
Because Janaki quit the school,
he also quit school

618
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,960
Like he continued and
completed his degree

619
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,160
Five girls during school

620
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Three after coming here

621
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,920
And now it's Malliga

622
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,640
Come on, everyone does this

623
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,640
Well, you guys don't have
the guts to say it but I do

624
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,960
Hey, wait and watch!

625
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
If Malliga doesn't
fall in love with me...

626
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,960
then make fun of me. Got it?

627
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,520
Write a civil services exam
after completing degree...

628
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,560
IAS job is not an easy one to get

629
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,320
- Check this out SK sir
- What?

630
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,880
Ramalingam seems
to be quite happy

631
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,960
- Don't you want to know?
- Let's ask him

632
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,480
What's up Ramalingam? You
look very excited and happy

633
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,840
Well, my daughter is engaged

634
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,600
Isn't she very young?

635
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,320
My daughter is doing her BA, second year

636
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,120
Ramalingam...

637
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,280
what's the hurry to get
your daughter married?

638
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,560
Sir, I'll retire next year

639
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,000
I must get some loan and
marry off my daughter by then

640
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,560
Ramalingam...

641
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,080
Don't you love your daughter?

642
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,320
Sir, she is my life

643
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,680
Rich or poor...

644
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,160
Yet we would have given the best
for our daughters and raised them

645
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,200
What would a girl know
at the age of 20?

646
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,560
She would be all confused
on the day her marriage

647
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,120
And we'll be worried about how her
husband and in-laws will judge her

648
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,000
Instead we parents must feel proud when we
stand on the marriage dais with our daughter

649
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,920
But how?

650
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,840
Educate your daughter and once she
is on her own, we will feel proud!

651
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,320
Come on! What if she
elopes with someone else?

652
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,280
Then what do we do?

653
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,200
Ramalingam!

654
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,400
Is that all the trust you
have on your daughter?

655
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,920
You think girls elope with
someone just like that?

656
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,320
Trust them and they won't break it

657
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,800
Sir, now what pissed him off?

658
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,320
He is someone who refuses the HM post so that
he can help his daughter focus on studies

659
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,440
Forget it

660
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Do you think he'll woo Malliga?

661
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
By the looks of it, I guess yes

662
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,400
Who's Mani?

663
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,560
It's me

664
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,560
What business do you have
in our area rickshaw stand?

665
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,560
If I see you anywhere around it again...

666
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,040
you'll be dead!

667
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,320
Don't hit him
He may die!

668
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,040
It's ok, leave them

669
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,760
- Bro, let them go
- Senthil, leave it

670
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,720
- Forget it
- Leave me! Leave me!

671
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,440
This would have been
over with one slap on me

672
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Why would you hit them
like that in a haste?

673
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,440
They won't rest until they finish us off

674
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,040
He fought for you and
is this how you talk?

675
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,680
Get lost! Bread and butter is
what matters the most than war!

676
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,760
Just till your leg is fine

677
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,680
Say maximum ten days

678
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,400
I'll be back then

679
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,920
We'll take care of it

680
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,920
- Excuse me
- Yes?

681
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,000
Excuse me!

682
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
Who are you? You seem new

683
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Just a minute

684
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,800
Where is Vaanakar?

685
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,560
He injured his leg. Hence,
I'm here on his behalf

686
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,040
And you are?

687
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,320
Do you know chef Muthuswami
at Sengamettu street?

688
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,240
Yes, I do

689
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm his son

690
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,560
- So you're one of us
- Indeed

691
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,200
Hey, I'll talk to you later

692
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,080
Did you take your lunch box?

693
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,960
Yes, uncle

694
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,160
- Sure?
- I did!

695
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,000
- Drive carefully
- Ok

696
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,120
- Good morning, miss
- Good morning

697
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,480
Why are you embarrassing me?

698
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,400
Her father is after all
an elementary school teacher

699
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm an M.Phil graduate

700
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,840
I revealed the question paper
to you yet you messed it up!

701
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,840
So, Ms. Malini, what rank did Vaishu get?

702
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,320
She got only the second rank

703
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,880
She fell sick exactly
during exams

704
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,480
Or else I'm sure she
would have done well

705
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,480
So, who came first? Kowsalya right?

706
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,760
Don't keep reading
Close the book

707
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,920
She will still reading

708
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,760
Hey, don't tease me

709
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Why didn't you come in
the rickshaw with me?

710
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,720
I didn't want to

711
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,520
Why?

712
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,040
I won't come with you hereafter

713
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,200
What do you mean?

714
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,280
Why would you propose Vinoth?

715
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,200
Hey! He is lying!

716
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,560
- No way
- He was the one who proposed me

717
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,800
And when I refused
guess what he said

718
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,200
You are the one lying to me

719
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,680
This is why one must
never trust silent girls

720
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,720
Excuse me...

721
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,840
I have something
important to ask you

722
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,800
Hello

723
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,080
I'm on my way

724
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,400
Can you drive a bit fast

725
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,560
Yes, sure

726
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,600
Keep going straight

727
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Where to? Not to the shop?

728
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,400
Excuse me...

729
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,360
Let me know if there is any issue.
I'll take care of it

730
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,120
Nothing of that sorts

731
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,400
Stop at the railway station

732
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,280
Ok

733
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,800
Thanks a lot

734
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,800
You have helped me a lot

735
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,400
Around three times
I didn't pay you any fare

736
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,080
Here, have this

737
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,200
See you

738
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,880
Why did you change
the love proverb?

739
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,160
Don't you know Malliga
eloped with someone?

740
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,120
You'll be shocked to know with whom

741
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,840
The guy who got beaten
up the other day, Kumar

742
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,400
She eloped with him

743
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,000
Bro, Malliga did give
hints the other day

744
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,280
Guess we didn't get it

745
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,520
Stop it!

746
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,320
You said the same
thing on that day

747
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,160
Dude, stop reacting as it
is happening the first time to you

748
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
Drink the tea before it goes cold

749
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,400
Forget her! She isn't
even so worthy!

750
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,520
- Bro, let's drink tonight
- Sure!

751
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,720
This is the best medicine at this hour

752
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,280
You can't escape. You got the first
rank, so better buy us all cool drinks

753
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,560
I'll buy for sure but
we got only ten minutes

754
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,960
Hey, get lost!

755
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,000
Vaishnavi! Muthulakshmi!

756
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,720
- Come on, Kowsalya's treating
- Come, let's go

757
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,080
Muthu, come on

758
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,720
I'm not coming.
You guys carry on

759
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,040
What are you studying?

760
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,360
Study well!

761
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,600
But anyway you'll score
not more than 50 marks

762
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,600
Muthu, come join us

763
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,960
Don't mistake me, Kowsi

764
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,920
If I join today for your treat then
someday I should also treat you all

765
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,120
Don't you know
my family's plight

766
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Even if for once my dad doesn't waste money on
drinks and gives it for household expenses...

767
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,280
and that would be
a treat for my family

768
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,280
Fine

769
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,800
I won't mistake
if you don't join us

770
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,480
But don't mind others
making fun of you

771
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,000
Studying is like saving money

772
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,560
You will definitely score
good marks one day

773
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
Stop showing off and join us

774
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,600
I said, come

775
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,320
Hey, hold on

776
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,200
You look beautiful. Now, come

777
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,120
I'll get you a lollipop
when I return

778
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,120
Bunked your classes, Prema?

779
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,040
Our teacher is on leave.
Now, make us some juice

780
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,400
Here

781
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,320
Hey Sheela, why do
you look tensed?

782
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,560
By mistake I shared
my number to a guy

783
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,560
He calls and tortures me

784
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,560
All these guys need is a girl's number...

785
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,280
they torture them with calls,
messages and miss calls

786
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,040
Why don't you complain to your dad?

787
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,200
He'll snatch away
the phone from me

788
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,120
Is that your problem.
Ok call that guy and give it to me

789
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,600
Here, talk to him as I tell you

790
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,600
Listen, this is Sub Inspector
Vanitha from A1 police station

791
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,880
What's your problem?

792
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,960
She is my cousin.
Isn't your life dear to you?

793
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,480
Fine, you better be in
your limits hereafter

794
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,920
Mind you!

795
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,200
He won't call you anymore

796
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,400
Sorry guys

797
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,960
I don't have the money

798
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,720
It's ok. Take this

799
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,320
- Hello
- Hello

800
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,960
Sorry Kowsh, this is Vinoth here

801
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,160
I was too harsh the other day

802
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,320
Please don't mind it

803
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,440
No worries. I have moved
on after that incident

804
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,760
Today is a holiday right?

805
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,840
Shall we meet?

806
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,600
No Vinoth. I'm not interested

807
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,840
You still don't trust me, Kowsalya

808
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,040
Hello

809
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,160
Is this how you bombard with calls
when you get a girl's number?

810
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,080
It was me who called you

811
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,200
Hey! Where is this auto-rickshaw parked?

812
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,880
Aiy-aiyo what happened?

813
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,280
Well, what happened was...

814
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,320
a guy was driving down
with her in his bike

815
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,400
Guess they were drunk. They fell
from the bike near the clock tower

816
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,080
Crowd gathered and that guy escaped

817
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,720
Poor girl, she was lying helpless

818
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,640
I reached at the right time
and I didn't know what to do

819
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,800
- Hence I got her here
- Roshni

820
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,480
Vinoth! You bloody cheat!

821
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,200
- I misunderstood my friend because of you
- Ok, I'll take care of her

822
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,200
- Hey, steady. Slow
- Hey Kowsi...

823
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,320
Sorry. Please forgive me

824
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,160
Because of him I judged you

825
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,120
Thanks a lot

826
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,520
Come on, don't mention it

827
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,360
Then what did
Roshni's parents say?

828
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,000
Her parents are quite
furious with her

829
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,640
No idea when they'll
send her back to school

830
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,520
Obviously. How will they send her
to school if she behaves like this

831
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,000
Basically she is a nice girl

832
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,600
It was that guy.
He is a spoilt brat

833
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,840
He cheated her

834
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,720
Thank God you reached there on time

835
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,800
Or else...

836
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,680
Thank God you are not
a part of their group

837
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,520
Kowsalya!

838
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,560
'Intermission'

839
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,520
The guy's name is Vinoth

840
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,240
He is the inspector's son

841
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,160
The guy must be a psychopath

842
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,680
Time is on our side. Thank God
nothing happened to your daughter

843
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Muthuswami's son, the
auto-rickshaw driver...

844
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,640
he's the one who saved her

845
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,600
Don't confuse yourself

846
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,640
Guess instead of attacking Roshni
he attacked your daughter

847
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,600
Sir, may I come in please?

848
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,280
What's the matter? Why are you here?

849
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,720
I am Vinoth's mother

850
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,160
Vinoth's mother!?

851
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,440
- Sir, please calm down
- Why in the hell are you here?

852
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,120
- I'm not here as an inspector
- Then?

853
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,600
Can we sit down for this?

854
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,400
Have a seat

855
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,200
Sir, please don't mistake me

856
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,200
My husband and myself, we both are working
and that is why our son is a spoilt brat

857
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,240
But we never expected this from him

858
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,040
You sound like it's no big deal

859
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,720
Look, what he did?
What if it had spilled on her?

860
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,600
I apologize on my son's behalf.
I'm sorry, sir

861
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,000
Apology! My foot

862
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,760
Sir, please hear me out

863
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,560
Even my father was
a teacher like you are

864
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,760
Since this incident took place
outside the school premises...

865
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,200
the school management
hasn't pressed any charges

866
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,920
Just for once...

867
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,320
please forgive him and...

868
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,840
I'll ensure that he won't
trouble your daughter again

869
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,000
What's the guarantee?

870
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,080
Sir, I have got a transfer to Ooty

871
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,720
I'll put him in a hostel
at Ooty by this week

872
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,520
He deserves a tough
punishment for his actions

873
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,120
But please, for once...

874
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,600
Excuse me, look here...

875
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,760
Thanks to you for coming all
the way down and apologizing

876
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,640
But what made your son
take such an extreme step?

877
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,400
Please find it out

878
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,760
I also have a daughter

879
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,200
I'll make him
realize his actions

880
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,000
Thanks a lot

881
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,680
Wait, I'll be back

882
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,040
Two biscuit packets please

883
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,240
Dad, I got a special test.
I'm getting late for it

884
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,080
Here. You can have it
when you feel hungry

885
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,440
- Shall I sit?
- Yes, sit

886
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,320
I would have reached
if I had taken an auto-rickshaw

887
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,000
There is no mechanic
garage nearby

888
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,720
Careful

889
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,800
Ok sir

890
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,080
Excuse me...

891
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,600
thanks a lot

892
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,840
See you, dad

893
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,920
Dad's worried that Vinoth
might harm me again

894
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,920
That is why he wants to drop me

895
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,560
When we are around,
no can harm you here

896
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,280
Don't you worry

897
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,280
Thank God, you also didn't
get hurt the other day

898
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,120
Right. There is no way
anyone is hurting me!

899
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,960
Like I'm gonna allow that!

900
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,200
Aren't you getting down?

901
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,280
Initially I judged you wrong

902
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,560
Other day, if not for you...

903
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,120
I can't even imagine!

904
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,240
Oh, come on now. Don't get
emotional for such silly issues

905
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,280
Aren't you getting late?
Please carry on

906
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,640
Ok, now tell me who took my notebook?
You better return it

907
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,520
Is it you? Whoever took
it, you better return it

908
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,480
If you don't then I curse
that you'll fail in exams

909
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,440
I go a step further and
abuse your boyfriend!

910
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,680
Whoa! Stop it

911
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,920
- Here's your notebook
- Behave well

912
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,360
Did you return it because she was
about to abuse your boyfriend?

913
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,480
I don't have a boyfriend

914
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,360
She's the one who is in love
with that mini bus conductor

915
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,160
She is hanging out with him everyday

916
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,800
I won't reveal anything more

917
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,320
Hey, she is coming

918
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,960
Roshni is on the call

919
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,160
Just a minute, let me step out

920
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,760
Kowsi...

921
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,680
I made a blunder

922
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,120
I'm leaving this school

923
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,160
We are heading back to Bangalore

924
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,360
Forgive me, please

925
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,800
Make it fast

926
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,520
Please mom.
Give me a minute

927
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,160
Hope you won't forget me

928
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,280
You'll always be my best friend

929
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,960
Kowsi, can you please
come out for a moment?

930
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,320
Which is Vaanakar's house?

931
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,440
- That's the one
- Ok

932
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,080
I guess this is his house

933
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,720
Excuse me

934
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,960
Please come in

935
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,520
How's your health now, uncle?

936
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,720
Is your leg better now?

937
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,360
Why did you trouble yourself?

938
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,080
I would have
returned in ten days

939
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,760
Why did you disturb her, Senthil?

940
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,560
Well, she was adamant

941
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,760
And so I thought
I'll also pay you a visit

942
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,040
Dear...

943
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,760
Get some water to drink

944
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,320
Has the pain subsided?

945
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,040
Yes, that's my daughter

946
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,720
Our cracker warehouse exploded

947
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,920
My wife and my son-in-law passed away

948
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,760
And my daughter...

949
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,480
...burnt her face

950
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,640
Grandpa, why are you crying?

951
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,960
Nothing dear

952
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,600
All my struggles are for these two

953
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,440
Working hard for our loved ones
who trust and dependent on us

954
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,680
What else happiness can
we find other than that?

955
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,520
Listen, your father is
a chef but apart from it...

956
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,080
like the wood used for cooking, he too burns
himself throughout the day to raise you both

957
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,080
Why are you doing these chores?
Let me do it, dear

958
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,120
Give it to me

959
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,640
- Give it to me
- Here, dad

960
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,800
I had been to the astrologer
Marimuthu's house today

961
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,240
He says our time will be
good once January is here

962
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,480
I pray to our deity that you should reconcile
with your husband. That is all I wish for

963
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,960
Like that's going to happen.

964
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,240
I wonder what I'm going to do about
this irresponsible son of mine

965
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,400
I have placed this month's due
amount in the shelf. Please use it

966
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,960
Yay! Mom, look at this.
Uncle bought me a toy

967
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,320
What's up, Senthil? I see you waiting at
the juice shop in the morning and evening

968
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,240
- Cool, carry on
- Oh! Come on bro

969
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,600
- Shall we start?
- Bro...

970
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,720
I missed the mini bus. Can you drop
me off at the Dharmapuram stop?

971
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,160
- I'll take a bus from there
- Ok, get in

972
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,480
Bro, that girl running the juice
shop is a good friend of mine

973
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,560
She already has a boyfriend. So
don't waste time waiting in the queue

974
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,320
Waiting in the queue?

975
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,320
And that too me?

976
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,280
Instead of falling in
love with some girl...

977
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,760
I better get married to a donkey

978
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,440
Please don't take a hasty decision
and get married to a donkey

979
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,400
Why do you say so?

980
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,400
Marrying relatives is a taboo

981
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,960
So you mean I am a donkey?

982
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,720
This is what I get in
turn for helping you

983
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,280
Run before I bash you up

984
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,720
Don't mistake me, bro

985
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,160
What made you feel that
marrying a donkey is better?

986
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,000
At least it won't ditch us

987
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,000
Not all girls are the same

988
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,480
Quick, the bus is about to leave

989
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,760
Bye, bro

990
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,240
The reason I wait at the juice shop...

991
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,680
is because of what you all think

992
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,840
Didn't you say that your father is worried
that Vinoth might harm you again?

993
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,480
Hence, I arrive a bit early to pick you up

994
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,520
Excuse me

995
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,960
I have arranged another rickshaw

996
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,440
- What?
- You go home in that rickshaw

997
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,120
Vinoth, pack your things and be ready

998
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,800
We must leave at sunset

999
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,040
Madam, please take care of your son

1000
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,080
Now drive, Velu

1001
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,480
An attempt to murder
case at Pattamangalam

1002
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,840
I got to solve it and get
relieving order by afternoon

1003
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,960
Let's start

1004
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,040
- Listen, get into the jeep
- Uncle, what happened?

1005
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,960
- Give me the bike
- But why?

1006
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,360
I'll tell you why

1007
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,760
Don't panic, we got to go
to the government hospital

1008
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,320
What happened?

1009
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,880
You mother is admitted in the ICU

1010
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,640
What?

1011
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,200
A criminal stabbed her while
trying to hunt him down

1012
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,600
Mom!

1013
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,880
Looks like your mother
forget to carry the gun

1014
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,320
Soni...

1015
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,040
- Finally you got a girlfriend. Get married soon
- Of course!

1016
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,200
- No way I'm letting go of her
- Listen guys...

1017
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,640
Are girls and love the only
topics you discuss all the time?

1018
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,840
There is much more to life than that

1019
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,920
First you force a girl to love you

1020
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,160
Then you force her
to marry you soon

1021
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,000
This is unfair

1022
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,960
You don't booze but you talk
philosophies as if you're drunk

1023
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,680
You guys will realize it someday

1024
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,040
You better leave!

1025
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,800
You never told us. You quietly
got into a relationship

1026
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,520
Listen, one who always keeps
saying never achieves

1027
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,040
One who achieves does it quietly

1028
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,160
He did it!

1029
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,480
Unlike you

1030
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,200
I was waiting for you
a long time, yesterday

1031
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,880
I forgot it was Sunday

1032
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,000
Oh, come on now. Why would you want
to go to school even on a Sunday?

1033
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,920
You need at least
a day's rest in a week

1034
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,200
Halting studies and resting won't
achieve me the expected results

1035
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,320
Why do you have the proverb
'Never trust girls' written on your rickshaw?

1036
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,880
It's just for fun

1037
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,080
I don't like it

1038
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,200
Is this the temple you
regularly pray at?

1039
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,680
In happiness, sorrow, victory or
failure, my dad and myself, we come here

1040
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,320
Sounds awesome!
This is our family's deity too

1041
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,080
Dear. Did I scare you?

1042
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,680
- Why would you scare her in the morning?
- Are you lovers?

1043
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,400
God will bless you both

1044
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,920
I noticed that you removed
the proverb sticker

1045
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,360
"Enough a little glance, my dear"

1046
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,280
"To see you, my girl"

1047
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,840
Buddy...

1048
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,720
- I have something to ask you
- What is it?

1049
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,600
Is it ok to fall in love with a girl
who is rich and well educated than us?

1050
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,200
Tell me who is the girl

1051
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,640
The girl whom I pick and
drop to school, Kowsalya

1052
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,040
It won't set you.

1053
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,000
Why are you acting strange?

1054
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,440
Are you sick?

1055
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,000
You! Watch out!

1056
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,120
Reckless drivers!
Stop jumping in my way

1057
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,360
I'm perfectly alright

1058
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,440
Why are you so quiet today?

1059
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,200
I won't be coming from tomorrow

1060
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,480
Vaanakar will be back

1061
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,920
Look, no one must go to school!

1062
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,080
I declare today as holiday for you all

1063
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,680
So go back to you houses!
I said, go!

1064
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,800
Stop!

1065
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,760
It's a holiday today. Leave!

1066
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,600
How dare you raise hands on me?
Wait and watch now!

1067
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,840
No one's listening...Hey,
I won't spare your life!

1068
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,280
Kowsalya...

1069
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,920
Sorry, uncle. I didn't notice.
Hope you are fine now

1070
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,240
Yes, I'm fine now

1071
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,160
Senthil's got held up with another trip.
Hence, I came

1072
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,080
Why do you look dull?

1073
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,360
Are you sick?

1074
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,320
No. Worried about my
studies and exams

1075
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,960
Don't you worry. I'm sure you'll score
good marks and go on to become a doctor

1076
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,560
I will boast that I used to drop
this doctor to her school and back

1077
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,760
Uncle, can you halt by our deity's temple?

1078
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,440
Senthil!

1079
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,440
Where are you off to?
Stop right there

1080
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,000
Kowsalya

1081
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,640
Senthil!

1082
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,560
So you won't meet me hereafter?

1083
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,720
No, Kowsalya

1084
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,960
I will come to meet you

1085
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:49,520
"You are my weakness and
you are my strength"

1086
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:56,960
"The whole world now complies with my wish,
even the moon is shining along with the sun"

1087
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:10,360
"Our eyes speak poems in the language of
love and it doesn't let us close our eyes"

1088
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:17,320
"I am always desperate and waiting
to meet and spend time with you"

1089
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:24,040
"It always worries me when you have to
leave. Wish we could spend time forever"

1090
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:30,840
"In breeze of love, here we are like
two kites having the time of our life"

1091
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:37,800
"Your love doesn't let me sleep. You
are all I think about all the time"

1092
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:44,640
"You way of talking mesmerizes me and the
way you care for me makes me want you more"

1093
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:53,080
"Our eyes speak poems in the language of
love and it doesn't let us close our eyes"

1094
01:11:53,120 --> 01:12:00,360
"I am always desperate and waiting
to meet and spend time with you"

1095
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:27,640
"When I smell your fragrance, I float
away high like a feather in the breeze"

1096
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:34,520
"All I wish for is you to be me with forever
and that is all my life is all about"

1097
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:41,480
"A you rise like the sun,
I chirp like the birds"

1098
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:52,160
"When I lay eyes on
you, I dance in joy"

1099
01:12:53,400 --> 01:13:00,320
"Our eyes speak poems in the language of
love and it doesn't let us close our eyes"

1100
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:07,120
"I am always desperate and waiting
to meet and spend time with you"

1101
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:34,800
"I know love is a mess yet
I have fallen in love"

1102
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:41,160
"I am yearning for you love,
don't you make me more desperate"

1103
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:48,520
"I am your genie, just rub the lamp, I'll
come out and make your wishes come true"

1104
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:59,080
"But when I see you even this huge
genie turns into and blushes like kid"

1105
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:07,200
"You are my weakness and
you are my strength"

1106
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:14,040
"I am always desperate and waiting
to meet and spend time with you"

1107
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,480
Where is Kowsi?

1108
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,720
At her friend's home

1109
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,720
Dear brother...

1110
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,760
Tell me

1111
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,240
Remember Senthil who replaced
Vaanakar when he got injured

1112
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,240
I see him and Kowsi
hanging out quite often

1113
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,600
Well...

1114
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,360
this is a tricky age for her

1115
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,320
She can't differentiate
between good and bad

1116
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,040
If something goes
awry in the future...

1117
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,720
Don't think too much

1118
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,840
He dropped to school for a period.
Also have helped her a lot

1119
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,200
They could be friends, right?

1120
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,200
Dear brother...

1121
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,000
I think you are pampering
Kowsi a bit too much

1122
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,720
She is not pampered. It's the
trust I have on my daughter

1123
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,080
Show me some nice time piece

1124
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,080
Check this out

1125
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,640
Were you waiting to show?

1126
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,160
Check this one too

1127
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,240
Something else?

1128
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,760
- How much for this one?
- Rs. 400/-

1129
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,320
- That one?
- Rs. 350/-

1130
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,920
350. This one?

1131
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,680
That's cheap. Just Rs. 180/-

1132
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,920
- This will run fine, right? Pack it
- Of course

1133
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,200
How about we gift Soni this one?

1134
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,760
Gifting a time piece
is old fashioned

1135
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,680
We must buy something
new and trendy

1136
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,840
This all that falls in our budget

1137
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,280
Let him hang this
in his rickshaw

1138
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,440
Fine, whatever

1139
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,440
- Please pack this one
- Sure. Give me that

1140
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,520
Please wait for five minutes

1141
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,040
- What's with the secret shopping?
- Nothing

1142
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,400
I saw you

1143
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,440
Well, I just thought of getting
a small gift for Kowsalya

1144
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,240
Are you still behind her?

1145
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,480
Won't you ever change?

1146
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,000
Listen, she is also in love with me

1147
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,480
This is not like earlier one sided
relationships. I am going to marry her

1148
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,720
So you guys have
decided to marry?

1149
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,040
The marriage cannot be even
registered until she turns 18

1150
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,760
We are getting married only
after she completes her studies

1151
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,880
You are a rickshaw driver

1152
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,320
She will get educated and become
a doctor or engineer in future

1153
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,760
Do you think her family will allow?

1154
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,120
In that we'll elope

1155
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,800
Today you are her hero,
a rickshaw driver

1156
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,280
When she goes to college, a guy in fancy bike
will attract her. What if she falls for him?

1157
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,520
How dare you?

1158
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,240
Sorry dude

1159
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,440
She is trustworthy

1160
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,880
Really sorry

1161
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,800
Sorry dude. Please, forgive me.
I'm sorry

1162
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,880
Your love won't end up in marriage

1163
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,960
You will regret later!
Wait and watch!

1164
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,400
- Hands off me!
- Buddy!

1165
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,280
Making up for slapping me?

1166
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,960
Forgive me

1167
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,880
Don't you know me?

1168
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,960
Why aren't you drinking?

1169
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,480
Well, I'm planning to quit drinking...

1170
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,160
Ok, fine

1171
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,240
You both belong to same caste and
you think that makes it easier?

1172
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,120
They will compare qualification,
wealth, status and what not

1173
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,360
Listen, first look
at one's quality!

1174
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,680
Am I bad person?

1175
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,560
I'm just a little hot head

1176
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,440
Listen...

1177
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,440
be honest and answer me

1178
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,480
Have I ever played
with any girl's life?

1179
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,440
Even my best friend
doesn't know me well

1180
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,280
- Hello
- I want to discuss something important

1181
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,800
There is a lot to study. I got
only two minutes. Make it fast

1182
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,400
Not over phone, Kowsalya

1183
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,160
That's ok. Just say it

1184
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,480
Aiyo! Dad!

1185
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,360
Who is it, dear?

1186
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,440
Nothing dad. Just
talking to a friend

1187
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,560
Dad...

1188
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,800
Well...dad...

1189
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,600
my friend, she is in love with an
auto-rickshaw driver, who isn't much educated

1190
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,120
Do her parents know about it?

1191
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,800
No parents would like an
uneducated son-in-law

1192
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,120
At this age, it's all
infatuation and not love

1193
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,000
Think about it after
five years and...

1194
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,440
all this will be nothing but a joke

1195
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,600
Look over there

1196
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,160
What a beautiful kite

1197
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,960
Look how high it is flying

1198
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,560
The thread attached isn't
stopping the kite from flying...

1199
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,880
instead it helps the kite to fly
high in a nice and steady manner

1200
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,760
If that threads snaps then the kite
will lose it way and come down crashing

1201
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,360
Parents are like that thread

1202
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,520
Without the thread's
guidance the kite is nothing

1203
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,160
But what if he is an
honest and nice guy?

1204
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,600
Majority of people in this world
are basically honest and nice

1205
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,800
but the question is if they are
the right ones to enter our lives

1206
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,000
This is not the right
age to find out that

1207
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,280
Make your friend understand this

1208
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,200
Have the milk and
continue studying

1209
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,800
What is basal metabolic rate?

1210
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,280
Prema, answer the question

1211
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,120
Do you know the answer or not?

1212
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,280
I don't know, miss

1213
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,960
What else do you know?
You don't study at all

1214
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,840
Who cares whether you
attend school or not?

1215
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,280
Had you got married, you'd
be mother of two by now

1216
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,400
Please convey that
to my dad, miss

1217
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,280
It was my mistake asking you at first

1218
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,400
Silence!

1219
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,120
Who can answer it?

1220
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,840
Kowsalya, give me the answer

1221
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,200
Sorry miss

1222
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,560
I just explained it. So, you
weren't paying attention?

1223
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,560
Yet you score marks
without studying

1224
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,400
Who else can answer this?

1225
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,240
Miss...

1226
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,920
HM has summoned you

1227
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,840
All of you study the
answer before I'm back

1228
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,800
Want to know a secret?

1229
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,120
When she asked
'What else do you know?'

1230
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,760
I can stitch a dress. In fact I
stitched my own dress, I mean this one

1231
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,880
Shocking, she asked a question that
even you found it tough to answer

1232
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,120
You are a rickshaw driver

1233
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,680
She will get educated and become
a doctor or engineer in future

1234
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,240
Do you think her family will allow?

1235
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,040
Your love won't end up in marriage

1236
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,440
- Come on, Kowsalya
- My lucky pen!

1237
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,560
My dad bought me that

1238
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,480
Wait, I'll get it

1239
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,720
Fine, forget it

1240
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,160
Kowsalya...

1241
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,640
I need to discuss something
important with you

1242
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,600
I have something even
more important to discuss

1243
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,080
In two days...

1244
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,320
school term gets over

1245
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,880
Then for a week...

1246
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,840
I have got study leave

1247
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,240
Followed by exams

1248
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,040
So?

1249
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,960
Both of us...I mean...

1250
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,280
Until my exams are over...

1251
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,440
let's not meet...

1252
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,360
or talk

1253
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,360
Senthil!

1254
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,920
Now that you've said it, why
are you calling me back?

1255
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,800
Go, study well become a doctor
and get married some doctor guy

1256
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,920
My friend already warned me

1257
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,120
I didn't pay heed

1258
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,200
First, have patience
and hear me out

1259
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,280
I am unable to
concentrate on studies

1260
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,960
I am not attentive during classes

1261
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,360
All I think about is meeting
and spending time with you

1262
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,520
And if I say this I am worried
that you will mistake me

1263
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,560
Don't you wish that I
should become a doctor?

1264
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,680
How could you even say such a thing?

1265
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,200
I'll be very proud if
you become a doctor

1266
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,600
But once you become a doctor...

1267
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,200
will you forget me?

1268
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,600
Do you think I'll forget my
father if I become a doctor?

1269
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,040
The same goes to you

1270
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,080
Then...

1271
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,880
will your dad agree?

1272
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,520
He will agree to
anything I ask for

1273
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,880
I shall leave now

1274
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,440
Kowsalya...

1275
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,880
It's beautiful but...

1276
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,440
I'll accept it once I get my doctor seat

1277
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,200
Uncle...

1278
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,680
Why are you calling him?

1279
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,400
Focus on studies or
else I'll punish you

1280
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,360
Dad...

1281
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,560
why didn't you punish me and send me
back to school when I refused to study?

1282
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,800
If you had done it, I would have got
educated and been in a good job by now

1283
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,520
You were his life...

1284
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,280
you threatened to jump into the well and suicide
if sent to school, what else can he do?

1285
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,480
Senthil asked me to pass this pen to you

1286
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:20,920
Hello

1287
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,200
Senthil...

1288
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,600
why did you take such a risk?

1289
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,200
Was it necessary to risk
your life and get this pen?

1290
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,760
Didn't you say
it's your lucky pen?

1291
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,640
Moreover, anything for you
is never a risk for me

1292
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,200
It's not a big deal

1293
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,800
Excuse me

1294
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,080
- Yes?
- What are you doing here?

1295
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,640
Just like that. How
about a tea for you?

1296
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,680
- No thanks. How are you?
- I'm fine

1297
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,480
- How's your rickshaw business?
- All good

1298
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,240
Excuse me...

1299
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,280
Hope Kowsalya is studying well

1300
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,360
She will study well and become a doctor

1301
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,120
And later we will marry her off to a doctor

1302
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,760
You focus on your business and try
moving up from rickshaw to car

1303
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,960
Because you must be the chauffeur for
the married couples, at her wedding

1304
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,360
Sir, tea

1305
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,000
Did you hear that?

1306
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,160
Who was that? My uncle?

1307
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,040
Now do you see what worries me?

1308
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,840
I can't even sleep thinking about it.
It's quite upsetting

1309
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,440
So just listen and do as I say

1310
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,040
I'll commit suicide if you
don't show up tomorrow

1311
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,280
What's running in your mind?

1312
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,200
Answer me!

1313
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,680
I didn't eat at all yesterday.
Do you know that?

1314
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,040
I was waiting for you...

1315
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,520
I was waiting expecting
you'll come to meet me

1316
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,920
Neither my family
understands me nor do you

1317
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,880
What do I do? Answer me!

1318
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,560
Vaishu...

1319
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,200
A moment please

1320
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,040
What are you saying?

1321
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,520
I am just revealing it to you

1322
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,320
Please do not tell anybody

1323
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,920
Handover this leave letter
to the miss, tomorrow

1324
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,440
I'm off for only half a day

1325
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,160
I'll be back in class by afternoon

1326
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,840
- Please do not tell anybody...
- Ok

1327
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,560
No

1328
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,520
Forget it

1329
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,680
I'm going nowhere tomorrow

1330
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,720
I'll come to class

1331
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,040
Talk! Why are you quiet?

1332
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,200
So, you say you won't marry me?

1333
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,960
So, you say you won't marry me?

1334
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,920
Oh God!

1335
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:38,040
Why did you do this, my dear!?
Move! Move!

1336
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,760
- Drive fast! Lord, save my daughter!
- Quick, drive carefully

1337
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,640
Her forearms are
full of blade marks

1338
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,240
Is that why she always wears full sleeves?

1339
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,680
Why would she do something
stupid like this?

1340
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,760
Must be some love affair

1341
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,160
- Ms. Mary
- Yes?

1342
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,160
Why didn't Kowsi finish her breakfast?

1343
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,360
- Aiy-aiyo
- I wonder what's the hurry?

1344
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,240
Look! Even the lunch box!

1345
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,800
Come on, Ms. Mary.
Won't you check?

1346
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,360
- She forgot her lunch
- She left before I could see her off

1347
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,920
- I'll hand it over on my way to work
- Ok

1348
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,120
Hello sir, this is Malini,
Kowsalya's class teacher

1349
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,800
Your daughter didn't
turn up to school today

1350
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,520
I didn't receive any leave letter

1351
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,040
She in the 12th grade.
Hence, I called you up

1352
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,720
She left for school

1353
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,280
She didn't come here

1354
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,560
Please don't mistake me
for saying this, sir

1355
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,280
Your daughter...

1356
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,440
Look, stop...

1357
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,080
Miss, please don't judge her!

1358
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,880
Consider all your students
as your own children

1359
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,000
Please don't tell anyone
what you just told me

1360
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,880
Kowsalya, once married in
front of this deity...

1361
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,040
no one can separate that couple

1362
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,800
You finally got what you wanted

1363
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,480
Anyway, God bless you

1364
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,200
You guys are my world

1365
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,920
- What do you say, Soni?
- Of course

1366
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,920
Kowsalya, now take your own good time and
complete your studies. I'll wait for you

1367
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,600
I don't have a good feeling
about this, Senthil

1368
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,520
I have never kept any
secrets from my father

1369
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,880
We will reveal it to him one day

1370
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,040
Do you think he'll agree now?

1371
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,240
Study well, become a doctor
and get your dad's consent

1372
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:35,040
Then in presence of both our families
we'll get married in a grand manner

1373
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,760
- What do you say, buddy?
- Of course!

1374
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,880
It's getting late. I have
applied only for half day leave

1375
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,880
Also got to go to Soni's
house to change my dress

1376
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,160
- Let's start
- Ok

1377
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,720
- Let's go
- Please dissolve this in the pond

1378
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,640
You go do it. I'll wait here

1379
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,160
Let's go before someone sees

1380
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,400
Come on, bro!

1381
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,000
Dad!

1382
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,040
Dad!

1383
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,520
It's not like what you think

1384
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,280
Dad!

1385
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,000
I'll come home and explain

1386
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,000
I was on my way to home, next

1387
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,920
Kowsalya!

1388
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,840
Kowsalya, this was
totally unexpected

1389
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,760
First, I must go home, Senthil

1390
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,720
I must meet my father

1391
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,040
My dad will understand me

1392
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:01,840
Dad!

1393
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,440
You look all worried. What is it?

1394
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,800
Where's my father?

1395
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,240
He left to your school to hand
over your lunch box to you

1396
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,480
Didn't he return home?

1397
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,360
He left to school looking for you

1398
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,680
You demon! You've
destroyed a family!

1399
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,840
Uncle!

1400
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,160
You cheated us with
your sweet words!

1401
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,760
Don't be angry

1402
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,240
What do you know?

1403
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,320
He is missing!

1404
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,280
You sinner!

1405
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,200
All his struggles were for you

1406
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:05,680
He refused a second marriage just
because he wanted to take care of you

1407
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,520
And look what you have done!

1408
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,440
Our whole family is now broken!

1409
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,800
Where will I go look for my brother now?

1410
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:40,600
"The one who showered
love on me like rain..."

1411
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,760
"I was a big part in even the
smallest of cells in you"

1412
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,320
"I'm now crying..."

1413
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:52,280
"All I want is you back in my life"

1414
01:34:52,400 --> 01:35:00,040
"As my guardian angel and as the
answers to all my questions"

1415
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:05,600
"You are my God! You are my God!"

1416
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,520
"You my world, dear father"

1417
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,360
"I am nothing without you, dear father"

1418
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,000
"You my world, dear father"

1419
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,280
"I am nothing without you, dear father"

1420
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,080
Your dad had invested in Fixed
Deposit for your education...

1421
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,120
and here is a small return
since it has matured

1422
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:49,400
"There are still many who live
with superstitious beliefs"

1423
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:57,280
"There are still many
who believe in miracles"

1424
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:05,360
"There is nothing more precious
than the sweat a father sheds"

1425
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:13,040
"A father's hard work and sweat is
equally powerful as a mother's milk"

1426
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:16,880
"There is no like you, dear father"

1427
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:20,600
"I am nothing without you, dear father"

1428
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,080
"You my world, dear father"

1429
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:30,280
"I am nothing without you, dear father"

1430
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,800
"You my world, dear father"

1431
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,560
"I am nothing without you, dear father"

1432
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,960
Look what you've done!

1433
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,720
What's the hurry to get married?

1434
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,920
First find her father
and make him understand

1435
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,880
This is not a marriage
without his consent

1436
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:19,840
"A brave heart with a beautiful smile,
I'm lost for words to praise you"

1437
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:27,440
"I would never leave you. You
would never be a burden to me"

1438
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:35,600
"Even when I didn't get
the mother's love..."

1439
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:43,160
"But you loved me so much that
you became my mother also"

1440
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:47,160
"There is no one like you, dear father"

1441
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:51,320
"I am nothing without
you, dear father"

1442
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,400
He can't live without you

1443
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,800
Once his anger subsides, he'll come back.
Now, eat dear

1444
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:00,280
"You my world, dear father"

1445
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:04,240
"I am nothing without you, dear father"

1446
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,960
"You my world, dear father"

1447
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,800
"I am nothing without you, dear father"

1448
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:21,240
Kowsi, I don't think we
can find your father

1449
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,960
Study well and become a doctor.
I'm sure he'll come back to you

1450
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,360
Don't confuse yourself

1451
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,120
Go. study well

1452
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,040
'After few years...'

1453
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,360
Careful

1454
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:10,960
Slowly

1455
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,000
Sit here. I'll go give our names

1456
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,600
Ma'am...

1457
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,960
please continue these tablets
which the doctor prescribed

1458
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,520
Ok

1459
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,040
Next, Mrs. Amudha...

1460
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,000
Kowsalya!

1461
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:34,080
Hope you are doing fine, miss

1462
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,800
What are you doing here?

1463
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:37,840
I...

1464
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,600
I work here

1465
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,920
Depressed, without my father...

1466
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:56,760
And the guilt...

1467
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,040
I couldn't concentrate
on studies

1468
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,400
- Yay! I passed the exams
- So did my sister

1469
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,600
My marks...

1470
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,440
were very low

1471
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,520
Muthulakshmi, quietly
she topped everyone

1472
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,520
As usual Vaishnavi got second rank

1473
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,320
Look, Kowsalya's marks
have gone very low

1474
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,560
Probably they didn't value the
paper correctly, Kowsalya

1475
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,000
Let's go inquire in the school

1476
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,920
But I didn't write my exams well, Senthil

1477
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:44,720
If I had got good marks, dad might
have returned home, isn't it?

1478
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,640
Look, what happened

1479
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,880
Poor Kowsalya

1480
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,440
How could've she studied
when her dad is missing?

1481
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,680
I guess we took a hasty decision

1482
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:09,400
We made a hasty decision?
He pushed us to do it!

1483
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,080
Only if he had some patience,
her dad wouldn't be missing now

1484
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,720
She would also have got good marks

1485
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,960
Kowsalya was the only student who answered
all my questions and took me by surprise!

1486
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,000
Stop blaming him

1487
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,200
Who expected this would happen?

1488
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:27,720
Senthil...

1489
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,080
Love failure isn't when a
girl refuses a proposal

1490
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,560
or when we fail to
marry the girl we love

1491
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:37,080
When we get married to the love of our
life and fail to gift her a happy life...

1492
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,880
that's the true love failure

1493
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,680
Now, go and console Kowsalya

1494
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,520
Why are you both so sad all the time?

1495
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,160
It's very disheartening to
see you both like this

1496
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,880
Dear, how did you even trust
and fall for this fellow?

1497
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,760
Look, now you too are struggling

1498
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,080
Kowsalya, how about we take a
break and go out of station?

1499
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,680
Yes, do that first

1500
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,320
My aunt stays in Madras. Go,
stay there for sometime

1501
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,960
Everyone in this place looks at both
of you as if you guys are criminals

1502
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,480
Take it

1503
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,040
There is Rs. 20,000/- in this

1504
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:49,080
- What about your vehicle's FC?
- I'll manage. Have it

1505
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,680
- I shall leave now
- We shall...

1506
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,160
leave tonight itself

1507
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:00,680
Don't leave now. Let the deity Angalamma's
ritual get over in our temple

1508
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,360
Leave in the morning 5 am train

1509
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,360
I'll drop Kowsalya at her home and
bring her back at early morning 4

1510
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,160
You pack your dress and get some sleep

1511
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,280
Ok?

1512
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:01,040
It's beautiful but I'll accept
it after I get the doctor's seat

1513
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:58,720
Senthil

1514
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,200
Senthil

1515
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:02,840
Dear sister! Senthil!

1516
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,440
Senthil

1517
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,560
Are you still asleep?

1518
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:14,200
Senthil!

1519
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,120
Senthil! Senthil!

1520
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,160
Brother!

1521
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,640
Why are you crying? What happened?

1522
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:29,600
Tell me, what is it?

1523
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,560
Senthil!

1524
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,280
What happened?

1525
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,000
Senthil!

1526
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,240
Aiyo!

1527
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,480
Senthil!

1528
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,800
Senthil!

1529
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,000
Aiy-aiyo!

1530
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,280
Senthil!

1531
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,040
Senthil!

1532
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,240
Senthil!

1533
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,360
Dad?

1534
01:46:58,280 --> 01:46:59,120
Dad!

1535
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,320
Dad!

1536
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,240
Dad...

1537
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:03,520
Dad!

1538
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,840
Why daddy? Why?

1539
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,200
Why daddy?

1540
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:21,560
Why couldn't you focus like how
Arjun focused on the parrot's eye?

1541
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,600
I don't know, dad!

1542
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,080
I have no idea why!

1543
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:34,320
Please dad, don't you leave me

1544
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,640
No, dad! Please!

1545
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,360
No, daddy! Please!

1546
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:45,080
Daddy, please don't leave me

1547
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,560
Please daddy, don't leave me

1548
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,360
Dad! Please! No!

1549
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:58,080
Dad! Please! No! Dad!

1550
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:05,760
Dad, please...

1551
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:11,840
Daddy!

1552
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,680
After that...

1553
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,280
I started concentrating
vigorously on studies

1554
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,000
I completed my B. Sc degree
winning the university gold medal

1555
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:35,360
I do a part time job in this hospital. I'm
preparing and writing all the competitive exams

1556
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:36,640
And your father?

1557
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,480
Did he return home?

1558
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,600
No, miss

1559
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,320
He will never leave me

1560
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,560
He will always follow me

1561
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:58,920
I'm sure, even now he is present
somewhere here and guarding me

1562
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:08,720
I couldn't fulfill his wish
of me becoming a doctor

1563
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,000
But miss...

1564
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,560
I have cleared the IAS prelims now

1565
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,360
Next, I'll pass the main exam and become an
IAS officer, a step ahead of what he wanted

1566
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,640
Then...

1567
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,680
my father will come in person and...

1568
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,120
he'll hug me!

1569
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,920
It's late. I shall
leave now, miss

1570
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,240
But it's raining heavily, Kowsalya

1571
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,280
That's ok, miss
