1
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,928
Well? Have the four of you
brought a treasure vault?

2
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,067
Can't you see?
lt's a cupboard

3
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,866
Your master placed an order yesterday.
We're here to deliver it

4
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:46,270
But my master has already left
for his vacations today

5
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,274
Anyway, bring it in.
- Move it, guys

6
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,940
Come on in

7
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,612
One and one...

8
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,281
makes eleven

9
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,297
one and one...

10
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,296
makes eleven...

11
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,625
my friend

12
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,302
One and one... is eleven

13
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,149
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

14
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:04,016
and one... is eleven

15
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,788
One and one is never two

16
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,365
Those who laugh,
never cry

17
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,362
Those who keep awake,
never fall asleep

18
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:23,766
Their identities,
they never lose

19
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:27,179
Wherever they find an enemy...

20
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:31,377
they deliver the punch...

21
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:34,717
my friend

22
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:39,558
One and one make eleven,
my friend

23
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,722
They are Tara and Sitara

24
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:47,730
Homeless orphans, driven
by poverty and despair...

25
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:50,125
they have formed a team together

26
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,803
They have taken the words of their
foster mother very seriously

27
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,198
They believe that should
one and one come together...

28
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,072
they possess the power of eleven.
They then set out...

29
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:03,678
on the path of thievery and fraud.
They think they will...

30
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:07,817
win over this world and
carve a place of their own

31
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:15,092
Little did they know that there are
the worst of thieves in the world...

32
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,225
who are not just enemies
of society...

33
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,829
but of the nation
and humanity at large

34
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:27,864
An instance of this kind became the
biggest lesson for Tara and Sitara...

35
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:32,775
when they met the dreaded criminals,
Cobra and Panther

36
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:11,874
Sir, our soldiers are ready
to take the guns to the base

37
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,750
Load the guns quickly.
We've got to leave

38
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:19,148
But you have an appointment
with Mr Subramaniam at 1 2

39
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,092
Plans have changed.
For security reasons

40
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:32,028
As you know, sir, no one except you
has the permission to go inside

41
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,171
He's on official work
for our department

42
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:39,510
He's responsible for delivery
of the gun at the base

43
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:42,037
But orders are orders, sir

44
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:47,509
Major, the Captain is doing
his duty. Orders are orders

45
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:50,515
You can go ahead.
l'll wait here, okay?

46
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:19,549
What is the matter?
- This is Dr Subramaniam's cabin, sir

47
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:27,549
While l meet Dr Subramaniam in
privacy, you will wait here

48
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,908
We need proper security
for this gun

49
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:55,583
We have toiled for years
to develop this gun

50
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,922
Come, let me give you
a demonstration

51
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:13,401
lt has an inbuilt sensor which detects
movements within a 10-kilometer range

52
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,972
Our soldiers will be greatly benefitted
in dealing with infiltrators

53
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,215
Because we don't want the gun to
fall in wrong hands...

54
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:34,616
each gun has been given
a different code-number

55
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:38,620
Without the code-number,
this gun will not function

56
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,124
What is the code-number
to operate the gun?

57
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,134
Ml2 3853713

58
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,972
First sign the documents

59
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:56,641
You've signed the document...

60
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,307
but you haven't entered
the password of this operation?

61
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:02,849
You know very well, Ram Singh

62
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,647
Without the password,
you cannot take this gun away

63
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,322
This gun... l am surely taking away

64
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,695
You're here, sir?
- Where else? This is my base

65
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:57,042
You were in there a little while ago,
and this is the only entry-point

66
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,512
l've arrived just now.
ln your presence

67
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,047
ln my presence, you've
already passed through sir

68
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:08,312
You also had an officer of
your department with you

69
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,863
My brother has left with the gun.
You can do what you wish

70
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:43,205
He has only left with the gun.
Not the code

71
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,208
Without the code,
that gun is worthless

72
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,614
And l'll get the gun back...
because you're with me

73
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:56,044
You can't do a thing!

74
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:03,688
Greetings, sir.
- Welcome, Bahadur Singh

75
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,898
What brings you to my place today?
- l've come with a reason, sir

76
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:13,701
l've come to warn you, sir.
- Warn me...?

77
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,903
A pair of thieves has struck terror.
- Terror...?

78
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,912
They hit upon such novel ideas
for robbery...

79
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,909
the police are left stunned.
- Don't tell me!

80
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:29,921
A few days ago, they got into
a cupboard and robbed the whole house

81
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:31,585
The whole house...?

82
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,915
They rent a house for a few days...

83
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,922
and sell the place,
as if they own it

84
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,323
Sell it away?
- They pose as servants and...

85
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:45,261
Sir...
- Milk, or the yogurt-shake?

86
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:53,935
The two of them... at your place?

87
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:58,943
The way they've taken care of me,
even my children haven't

88
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:03,448
After they've taken care of you,
they'll vanish with the loot!

89
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:06,481
What do you mean?
- They're conning you!

90
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,951
They're the twosome
l've been warning you about

91
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:13,196
One is Tara...
- The other is Sitara. l know

92
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:21,303
l say...
you've ruined all our efforts

93
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,698
Even if a criminal
wants to reform...

94
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:26,772
people like you
won't let him turn a new leaf

95
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:31,206
l say... have you forgotten?
- lt might hurt

96
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:36,578
We had sworn it on your head
that we'd work hard for a living

97
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:39,719
That we'd never steal again

98
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,994
That's just what we were doing,
but you've told our employer about us

99
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,797
You've snatched our livelihood.
Where to...?

100
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:50,091
l got a kick on the waist

101
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,000
Sir, l wish to
tell you something today

102
00:14:57,176 --> 00:15:02,409
lf these guardians of the law
keep harping on cliches...

103
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:06,342
people like us will keep
going to the jails

104
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,344
No, l'm not letting you guys
become thieves

105
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:14,015
You're staying here with me.
- Sir, l will leave now

106
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,484
But you'd better
remain alert with them

107
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,822
A fire...
- he has started

108
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,034
No, he hasn't

109
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:29,030
l know you guys are reformed

110
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:33,468
But tell me of your modus operandi
as thieves...

111
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:37,038
so l will remain alert
with cheats in the future

112
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:43,053
We first survey a locality.
- Then?

113
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:48,651
Then we get into the household
which is most innocent and wealthy

114
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,653
Then?
- Then...

115
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:55,056
we serve the master as his servants.
- Like you've been serving me?

116
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,798
And when we've won the confidence
of our master...

117
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:04,075
we lace his milk or yogurt-shake
with a bit of sedative and...

118
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,883
Such foolish people! Their
yogurt-shake is laced with sedatives

119
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:15,083
And they don't even get to know...

120
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:20,081
Did he... get to know?
The moron

121
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:37,102
Ruined

122
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:41,106
This man was out to
reform those thieves

123
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:45,512
But those thieves have
put him to sleep

124
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,514
l told you to remain alert

125
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,122
But you will continue to sleep

126
00:16:58,464 --> 00:16:59,453
C'mon

127
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,734
Tara and Sitara...
your game is up

128
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:16,140
Don't even try to escape.
Else, l'll let you have it

129
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:20,144
He's getting dramatic.
- Looks like he wants to die

130
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:23,144
Tell me something, Bahadur Singh

131
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,719
Why're you always hounding
us innocent guys?

132
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:34,491
Because of you guys,
l haven't had a wash in a week

133
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:38,500
But l'm taking you to
the cleaners. Nicely so!

134
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,174
No more jokes, lnspector.
Else, an innocent man will die

135
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:54,175
That's Cobra, isn't it?
- Yes, sir

136
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:59,188
You guys know who you're messing with?

137
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,789
Shut up! Else, l'll pluck
your eye-balls out

138
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:05,696
You speak as if you've got a
reward of millions on your head!

139
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,189
You're right.
- Can't you see...?

140
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:10,525
the cops and the thieves
are making a deal?

141
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:17,198
Go ahead and kill him. That's Cobra.
The dreaded criminal

142
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,544
There's a reward of 100,000
for catching him, dead or alive

143
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:24,876
Landed us in trouble, haven't you?
- You ought to carry a signboard...

144
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:28,481
that you're Cobra.
How would we know?

145
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:33,214
There's a reward of
100,000 on his head

146
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:36,026
Will we get it?
- Sure

147
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:39,496
lf l let you live
to claim the reward

148
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:41,961
Arrest all three of them

149
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,725
Before l turn cold,
let me take his blessings

150
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:02,578
lt's Mr Cobra who's being
presented in court

151
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:07,254
And why're we going there?
- That's the new style

152
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,423
Hammer a nail into a block of wood,
it'll sail with it in the waters

153
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:16,828
Like Mr Cobra here.
He's the engine...

154
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,072
and we're the trailers.
lf he runs, we run. For no reason

155
00:19:55,908 --> 00:20:00,038
For how many years do you think
Mr Cobra will be sent away?

156
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:09,311
Going by the way he looks
and behaves, l think...

157
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,321
you tell me how many years
you're likely to get

158
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,603
He's scowling at me.
- ls he?

159
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,332
Let me see, Brother Cobra

160
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,678
Sure he's scowling

161
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:48,758
l think there's a terrible storm
lurking behind his silence

162
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,877
Brother...

163
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,782
don't be angry, we're kids.
Give us a smile

164
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:51,416
You guys are free

165
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,280
Move it

166
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:59,887
Lovely weather...
- Shut up. l've had enough

167
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,221
C'mon

168
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,681
There's a car parked down there.
lt'll take you to the highway

169
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,110
Mike will...

170
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:29,460
We don't utter names
in the presence of strangers

171
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,453
He was revealing our gameplan

172
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,798
What's with him, brother?
Why's he fallen down?

173
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:41,462
My bullet got him.
- We didn't even hear it

174
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:44,138
When did it happen?
- You fired yesterday, did you?

175
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,840
Today. Want to hear it again?

176
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,715
Don't move... l'll shoot

177
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,747
Drop the guns,
or l'll shoot

178
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:59,814
Well? We call you brother
and you turn out to be a snob?

179
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,487
What have you been up to?
What...?

180
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:06,496
Are you going to talk
or undo these chains?

181
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,732
What's with the chains?

182
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:15,072
l say, who's screaming?

183
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:18,237
ls it the chains?
- No, it's a leg actually

184
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,979
The bullet hit him a little
below the chains in the leg

185
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:28,179
What the hell have you done?
Cobra... forgive us!

186
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:31,920
Was it a mistake?
- What if it struck him 4 inches up?

187
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:35,258
No one has survived.
- Let me undo these chains

188
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,523
Why're you shooting at me?
- Not you, l blew the chains away

189
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,866
So what do we do?
- Run

190
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,537
Where's my brother... where?

191
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:56,546
Get up, sir. Police!

192
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,544
Congratulations, sir.
Cobra has been captured

193
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:06,551
That's all right. But where have
Tara and Sitara disappeared...?

194
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:09,360
My job's on the line!
And you...

195
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:13,222
you call yourself a big criminal
and you couldn't stop those guys?

196
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,059
Get up

197
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:18,200
How will he get up? He's got
a bullet-injury in his leg

198
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,902
Carry him on your shoulders
and take him to the hospital

199
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:27,238
Where will l go looking for them
in this wilderness? Tara! Sitara!

200
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:38,579
Lots of stuff they've collected

201
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:48,330
Where are Tara and Sitara?
- Don't you read the newspapers?

202
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:51,835
Don't you watch TV...?
Has there been a robbery in town?

203
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:55,604
Has anyone robbed anyone...?
There's peace and calm in the city

204
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,201
What does that mean...? What?

205
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,980
lt means my sons are at their
in-laws (read jail). Tihar Jail

206
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:09,485
Your sons have run away from jail
and left me in a spot of bother

207
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:12,618
What...? My sons have run away?

208
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:17,222
Scoundrels! When you can't take
care of my sons...

209
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,291
why do you take them away
for six months?

210
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:23,362
They weren't guests! We took
them away because they were thieves!

211
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:30,301
And there l was... with a heavy heart
l gave my darling sons to you!

212
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:33,634
And you make them run away!

213
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:39,650
Am l crazy to make
the prisoners run away?

214
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:41,646
They ran away on their own

215
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,254
There must surely have been something
lacking in your hospitality

216
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:47,454
Else, why would my sons run away?
They're my support in life

217
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:51,251
Tara and Sitara.
Now listen carefully, you ass

218
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:55,929
lf my sons are not returned to me,
l'm going to curse you

219
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,392
You're going to fall
to a criminal's bullets

220
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,662
Even if you escape that,
you'll lose your job

221
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:06,276
That's enough!
When l find your precious sons...

222
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:09,670
l'll leave them here on my own.
This woman is a tyrant!

223
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:14,279
Tara, Sitara...
he has left

224
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:20,283
Darling mother...
you were amazing

225
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:24,694
Enough. You boys ought to
read the writing on the wall...

226
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:28,692
and slip cross the border.
Do telephone me

227
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,499
And don't come back,
till l tell you to

228
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,705
Here's some money.
l collected it for bad times

229
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,142
You're so sweet...

230
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,714
you're so innocent...

231
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:47,708
you're lovable...

232
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,713
dear mother... our mother

233
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:01,530
Mother, you've done so much for us.
Know what...?

234
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:05,002
Even if our real mother was here...
- What did you say?

235
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,737
Have l given you any less love
than a real mother?

236
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:10,735
Had your real mother been here, she'd
have handed you over to the police...

237
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:15,312
to prove her greatness. She wouldn't
have shielded you, like l did

238
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:19,012
But you boys always say such things
to hurt my feelings

239
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:24,549
No, mother... don't misunderstand us.
What we meant to say was that...

240
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,753
had it not been for you,
we wouldn't even have been alive

241
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:33,764
We know, the one who rears is far
greater than the one who gives birth

242
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:37,761
And you have brought us up.
So please don't misunderstand us!

243
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:42,774
All right. Run away
as quickly as you can

244
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:45,370
You only had the cops
after you earlier

245
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:48,769
But even Cobra's hunting for you now.
He wants to have your legs broken

246
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:52,175
Big deal! We're the ones
who shot at his leg!

247
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,511
Of course. But before he
gets into another game...

248
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,790
we'll start a new one.
- By cutting ourselves down to size

249
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:22,812
l say, hold this...
l'll make enquiries about the train

250
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,414
Relax

251
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:43,499
What's happening?
Posters for a circus...?

252
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:46,630
A magician in town?
Or is it a new movie?

253
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,835
Right now, it's these two thieves
who are making waves

254
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:54,837
They've made lives miserable for the
cops and the citizens in the city

255
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:58,472
Want to take a look?
- All right, let me see

256
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:01,845
There's a reward for their capture.
lf you catch them, you keep some...

257
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:04,051
and give me some

258
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,886
Sitara, l can hear
the band being played for me!

259
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:53,894
l say...
- Look here

260
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,573
l say, sir...
is that your daughter?

261
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,710
No, not my daughter.
But you sure are my son-in-law

262
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:04,643
Your blessings.
- Bless you

263
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,712
l have another son-in-law...
where is he?

264
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,919
l'm not telling you.
- Don't tell me. But l know

265
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:15,592
You can't live without each other.
lf one of you is caught...

266
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:18,518
the other comes forward
to court arrest. Right?

267
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,522
Let's go

268
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:39,944
Wait there, Sitara...
else, l'll shoot

269
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:44,946
l say, praise the Lord!
- Tara...

270
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:47,948
You took such a huge risk
to save me?

271
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:52,358
No big risk, Sitara...
we share a great relationship

272
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:57,298
The world knows. Tara and Sitara
are two bodies and one soul

273
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,305
lf something happened to you...?
- What's happening to me?

274
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:05,299
Tell me, what would you have done
if you were in my shoes?

275
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:09,970
What's a jeep?
l'd have hijacked a train for you!

276
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:12,112
There you are, aren't you?
- On the dot

277
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:15,980
Sitara, let me tell you
something today

278
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,788
l respect you a lot, my friend.
- Watch the jeep

279
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,801
When we got to be friends...

280
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,003
we spawned a thousand stories
of friendship

281
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,010
Friendship was a precious gift

282
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:42,403
Every season was lovely

283
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,406
They know...
- They know...

284
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:49,416
the whole world knows that...

285
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,188
my friend...

286
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:55,018
One and one...

287
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:56,817
adds up to eleven...

288
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,026
my friend

289
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:04,028
one and one...

290
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,561
one and one...

291
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,030
is eleven

292
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:27,056
lf you see someone trying
to cross the fence...

293
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:29,389
go ahead and shoot them

294
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:33,789
Who's in that jeep,
could you explain?

295
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,799
Major Ram Singh

296
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:43,330
l'm Raju Nepali

297
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:47,408
Only two men can help you
cross the border

298
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,070
One is Major Ram Singh,
who won't do it

299
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:54,408
The other is me...
l do it only for money

300
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,745
That's a new one.
- How much money will you take?

301
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:00,751
200,000 for two guys.
- We aren't asking the price...

302
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:04,425
of this place. We want to know
the price for crossing over

303
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:07,428
That's the price for
crossing over

304
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,092
Come over, when you have the money.
You'll find Raju Nepali right here

305
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:17,632
He won't even say bye...
rude man

306
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:21,111
How are we going to raise
200,000 in this area?

307
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,378
Not a soul to rob

308
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:30,445
They found no dear ones, but they picked
on Apna Bank to fulfill their needs

309
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:34,548
You think we can manage to
squeeze 200,000 out of them?

310
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:39,128
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings

311
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:41,694
You want to open an account?
- No, we're planning a robbery

312
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,124
Robbery...?
- Foolish man!

313
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:48,466
What will two top businessmen do
if not open an account!

314
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:51,404
We have a lot of money.
- l see

315
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,935
Ten million

316
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:57,944
Ten...

317
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:02,479
He's stuck on ten,
as if he hasn't seen it at all

318
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:07,154
We hardly have 2 million
in our bank at any given time

319
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,158
lt's a very small bank.
- Not small...

320
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,755
Listen

321
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,157
That's 10 million lost!

322
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:20,761
Something amazing happened
at the bank today

323
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:24,630
There were these customers who
wanted to open an account

324
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:28,907
Of... 10 million

325
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:34,182
Like an idiot, l told them that
we never have more than 2 million

326
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,577
And they walked away

327
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:39,983
ls manager in?
-Who could it be so late in the night?

328
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,182
Give in the name of God!

329
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:45,862
ls this any time to beg
for alms...? Go away

330
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:49,189
We are not beggars, we're here
to make a beggar out of you

331
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:51,997
Who are you?

332
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:56,002
Look here. l have one too

333
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,605
Recognise us? He's the elder brother,
l'm the younger one

334
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,542
Brothers with six bullets each.
- Six...?

335
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:07,476
Recognise us?

336
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:18,559
Junior... that's a beautiful girl.
- Where?

337
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,235
What insolence is this...?
Dad, call the police immediately

338
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:30,973
Your telephone's already dead.
- Your dad could be dead too

339
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:37,637
Don't be sad. The look of you
has already driven me mad

340
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:42,242
See? Your daughter has
robbed my elder brother

341
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:48,023
l'm going to do some robbing now.
ln your bank

342
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,350
We'll go to sleep right here

343
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:53,856
You'll take us to the bank
tomorrow morning...

344
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:58,859
and personally have your bank robbed.
You'll then see us out...

345
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,670
and then will follow the police,
the questions, the answers...

346
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,932
the news channels...
you'll become famous

347
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:07,071
Keep eating

348
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:15,286
Brother! There's porridge!
Potato and cauliflower pancakes!

349
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,753
Let me have some porridge
in peace

350
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:23,888
l've made it...
would you like some?

351
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,286
Let me eat it in peace

352
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:31,295
Will you have some...?
- l'm already eating some. You have it

353
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:34,101
l see. That's non-fattening,
this is fattening

354
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:35,636
Very intelligent

355
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:39,102
What are you doing here?
Go and fetch a bag...

356
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:42,310
we've got to rob a bank!
You got to understand

357
00:36:57,328 --> 00:36:59,660
ls he laughing or crying?
l can't tell

358
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,861
Hurry up, son.
You know who l am

359
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:07,069
The brothers with six bullets each.
- Hurry up, l hate delays

360
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:08,669
Hurry

361
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:15,336
Are you laughing or crying?
l can't make out

362
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:21,348
Just run away with me

363
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,018
l have so much of money,
l'll keep you happy

364
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:30,017
You've robbed all the money and you
want to run away with my daughter?

365
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:32,963
The cops will get us, brother.
- Why?

366
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:36,162
We're bandits, that's why.
Let's go

367
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,694
Let's go, l say!
- Let's go

368
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:43,038
They've taken away all the money!

369
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:56,683
Brother... what bad times

370
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,046
We used to run away with
the money earlier

371
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,052
Now we give money and run away.
- Don't you think...

372
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:04,384
that rather than pay this guy
200,000...

373
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:08,562
we could've struck a deal
with Ram Singh himself?

374
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:10,390
He'd have shot you

375
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,399
He's been shot!
l see Ram Singh clearly!

376
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:24,110
Ram Singh's house

377
00:38:24,415 --> 00:38:29,079
Tara and Sitara would never find
a better place to evade the police

378
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,618
Well, they could effortlessly
gain entry into any house

379
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:38,895
Let's see how they trick
their way into Ram Singh's house

380
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:41,421
A hundred-rupee note!

381
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,424
God, if You had to cure
the itch in my hand...

382
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,593
You could've given me
a 500-rupee note!

383
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:52,174
500 rupees...?

384
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:56,104
Which side of the bed did
l get off this morning?

385
00:38:56,447 --> 00:39:00,781
God, let me find a wallet stuffed
with money since You're so kind!

386
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:08,254
A wallet stuffed with notes!

387
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:22,466
Scoundrel!
- Cur!

388
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:28,135
We're going to cure your itch today!
- You steal our wallet!

389
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,081
l didn't steal it...
it was lying here

390
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:33,477
Not lying there.
lt was kept there safely

391
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:37,081
Take him to the police station.
- Let's go

392
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:41,481
No, sir! Please don't
take me to the police station

393
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,225
l'm a very poor man!

394
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,495
l've got a mother, two brothers
and three sisters

395
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,255
All sisters have got
to be married

396
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:52,231
You can marry two of them,
l'll find a better guy for the third

397
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:55,163
Will you find anyone
better than us, you ass?

398
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:57,303
Look at this personality

399
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:00,168
Check out my looks...
better than us, you say?

400
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:03,841
Listen...
You tell him

401
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:10,112
We aren't marrying your sisters,
but we can help in their marriage

402
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:12,512
How?
- Here you are

403
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:16,857
Help with a hundred bucks?
- All right, you have a big quota

404
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:22,795
For the money, you'll have to
extend some help to us

405
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,533
What help?
- Ask my senior

406
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:29,705
Ask junior.
- Ask senior

407
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,672
Just tell me... stop teasing me

408
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,740
Are you scolding us?
- No, please tell me

409
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:40,543
Madam, look!
Your wedding necklace

410
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:44,215
How did you get it?
- A thief was running away with it

411
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:49,558
This is the last memento of
my husband. lt's so dear to me

412
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,358
l'm glad you caught
the thief, Chhotu

413
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,896
Not me, it was these decent gentlemen.
Tara and Sitara

414
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,558
They're the ones
who caught the thief

415
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:10,045
l say, Sitara... a familiar sight.
Our house hasn't changed at all!

416
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:12,575
The same house, the same windows
and the same doors

417
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:14,848
The same curtains too

418
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,382
Have you been
in this house earlier?

419
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:22,589
Been here? This is where
we were born, what say?

420
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:27,591
This is the place where we
were christened and initiated

421
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,193
l'm Tara.
- l'm Sitara

422
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,605
Our father's was going through
a lean patch in those days

423
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:40,601
He had to sell this bungalow.
- Ever since, to this day...

424
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:45,139
we brothers miss our parents
so much!

425
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:51,621
Mother!
- No, son... calm down

426
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:56,626
That's just what mother used to say

427
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,626
Don't...
- Mother!

428
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,097
l really miss my mother!
- You are great

429
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:16,203
A kid...
- Kid?

430
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:18,638
He's a big kid

431
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,982
Remember when we were children?
l used to bring a chocolate like him

432
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:28,386
And l used to snatch it from you.
- l used to snatch it back

433
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:32,326
Know what?
l love eating things l snatch

434
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,664
Really? You'll make it big some day!

435
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,395
Sister-in-law... mother...

436
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:39,667
Gotcha!

437
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:45,005
Gotcha!
- Gotcha what?

438
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:51,481
He has found his room.
- Not my room... my bedroom

439
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:54,480
l've found my bedroom

440
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:58,683
The same texture,
the same air...

441
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,356
Come to your senses.
- l've just come to my senses!

442
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:08,288
l've gone crazy looking
at this house today!

443
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,691
Tara, if you're so attached
to this house...

444
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:16,437
let's hire a room in a hotel
and you can keep looking at it

445
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:18,965
Must we live in a hotel?
- Yes

446
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,111
Stay here for a few days, son.
This is like your own house

447
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,212
Mother!

448
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:28,141
Tara, don't...

449
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:32,386
l can't get up, you see.
l was only taking her blessing

450
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:57,744
Brother Sitara...
- Go on

451
00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:00,140
Does it remind you of something?
- What?

452
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:05,415
Didn't our daddy look like him
in his younger days?

453
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:07,757
Oh yes, the same height,
the same moustache...

454
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:12,755
and a stern disposition.
There's no difference at all

455
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,555
Who are they?

456
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,432
This bungalow used to belong to them

457
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:22,169
They're here for a few days,
we asked them to stay over

458
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,772
l don't allow strangers
to stay in my house

459
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:38,283
This house isn't ours anymore

460
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:42,119
So how can the folks here
feel any sense of belonging?

461
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:45,523
You are not going anywhere.
You're staying here

462
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:50,392
You don't know what a big favour
you have done to me

463
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:55,195
l know my son very well.
He'll never disobey me

464
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:59,170
He's a soldier, you see.
He can't trust people easily

465
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,801
Chhotu...
- Yes, madam?

466
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:06,206
Take their luggage to the out-house.
- Sure. Please give it to me

467
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:14,615
Mother, even God wouldn't
look any different from you

468
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:22,162
We haven't ever seen You...

469
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:39,376
Every saint and Prophet
has said...

470
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:42,644
in this world...

471
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,450
love is the greatest feeling

472
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:49,249
End my agony...

473
00:45:50,227 --> 00:45:53,219
O Lord...

474
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:56,856
heed the cry of Radha...

475
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:01,266
Lord Krishna

476
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:05,865
Help it sail across...

477
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:10,336
the boat of my dreams...

478
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:14,883
heed the cry of Radha...

479
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:18,344
Lord Krishna

480
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:28,422
You sing very well, son.
lt gives me so much of peace

481
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,891
Sitara and l have
always been like this

482
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:35,303
We've always wanted to
sing melodious songs

483
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:38,633
But alas! we've always
had a terrible chorus

484
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,674
Where's Sitara?
- l say the prayers in the morning...

485
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:45,038
he performs the rituals
in the evening

486
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:47,910
That's very nice.
Let me take you out

487
00:46:48,185 --> 00:46:49,709
Take her blessings

488
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,447
l can drive the wheelchair
on my own

489
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:58,926
Chhotu, why've you come in
with my luggage and footwear?

490
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,730
l sent for him.
- You...?

491
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:05,595
We were comfortable in the out-house.
Why call us into the house?

492
00:47:05,936 --> 00:47:08,598
Neither are you staying in the house,
nor in the out-house

493
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:12,204
You can win over my family with
your sentimental crap... not me

494
00:47:12,743 --> 00:47:14,938
You haven't driven Sitara out,
have you?

495
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:19,280
He's waiting for you at the gate.
- You've already driven him out?

496
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:21,951
Come on, Chhotu

497
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:26,286
Don't you think we have
been humiliated?

498
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,750
Brother...
- You're here too?

499
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:35,625
l was singing a hymn and he
very respectfully saw me out

500
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:39,327
But l'm told he didn't even
let you change?

501
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,963
What's changing? He didn't even
let me go to the loo

502
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:48,467
Listen, get a can for my brother.
- Shut up!

503
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,973
You know, when l lose my temper,
l always give someone a thrashing

504
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:56,580
l've lost my temper too!

505
00:47:57,988 --> 00:48:01,321
But we can't beat up Ram Singh.
- So?

506
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:07,995
l'm a very poor man! l have a mother,
two brothers and three sisters!

507
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,523
After him

508
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:32,415
The bullet mustn't hit Ram Singh's
son. We want him alive

509
00:48:56,046 --> 00:48:57,843
Help!

510
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,383
Tara, please help!
- Not to worry

511
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,385
The kid has won the race,
you guys have lost

512
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:11,227
Get going.
- Going...? Me?

513
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:13,324
Brother...

514
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:18,061
the jungle's already green.
Come over

515
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:22,495
What happened?
- We have thugs here!

516
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:26,203
You handle them.
- l'm on a pedal...

517
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,412
how can l handle them? Get it!
- l'm busy with my own handle!

518
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:34,648
Your handle's busy, my pedal's busy...
it's no so easy

519
00:49:35,085 --> 00:49:37,815
These guys are pointing guns...
swap your handle!

520
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:39,347
Get him

521
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:42,583
Not so late... they'll lay me out

522
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:52,094
What are you here for? Run away!
- Run

523
00:49:52,202 --> 00:49:53,362
Scram!

524
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:05,514
Dad, come to
the club house immediately

525
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:09,452
They tried to kidnap me...
the driver has been killed

526
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:12,549
ln the streams of time,
we do not flow

527
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:16,448
We don't talk too much...

528
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:19,925
but we don't remain
silent either

529
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:23,389
Atrocities, we do not tolerate

530
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:26,793
This world...

531
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:31,130
has conceded defeat to us...

532
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:34,542
buddy-boy...

533
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:37,146
one and one make eleven

534
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:44,484
Ram Singh's here.
- Sit in your vehicle

535
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:51,160
Brother, do l look decent enough?
- Wear a sad look

536
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:58,725
Are you all right?
- Yes

537
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:02,161
Had they not arrived on time,
they'd have kidnapped me today

538
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:03,795
Bansi...

539
00:51:08,178 --> 00:51:10,169
How will l ever thank you?

540
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:15,575
You're not supposed to
thank children. Only bless them

541
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:20,850
We must leave now.
Good bye

542
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:25,526
You're not going anywhere.
You can stay at the outhouse...

543
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:28,528
for as long as you wish.
- Brother!

544
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,997
Brother!

545
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:46,543
l have travelled a long distance,
with my love

546
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:55,217
Tell me something, sir.
Do you plan on buying this bungalow?

547
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,221
You've made yourself comfortable.
- That's like us brothers, you see

548
00:51:58,629 --> 00:52:01,826
Even when we buy a pair of slippers,
we properly check it out

549
00:52:02,232 --> 00:52:05,224
Can't say when we might use it.
- One thing, sir

550
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:08,535
Whenever you buy the bungalow,
let me be your servant

551
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:11,835
l'm very poor. l have a mother,
two brothers and three sisters

552
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:14,233
You've got to get them married?
- Right, sir

553
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:17,244
He's eyeing the bungalow.
- Listen, arrange for some breakfast

554
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,843
You won't forget, will you?
- No way!

555
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:26,248
l know you've got 3 mothers,
300 brothers, 3500 sisters!

556
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,854
No, one mother, two brothers...
- Get lost!

557
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:35,925
Brother Tara...
- Brother Sitara?

558
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,597
We have a place to hide.
- Right

559
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:44,266
Till Cobra dies,
let's hide in this hole

560
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,271
You see something?
- Great danger

561
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:54,281
Ram Singh has not adopted us to
take care of us till we're old

562
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:58,678
We're his guests for a few days!
- We aren't his guests, brother!

563
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:06,285
You've seen only Ram Singh,
not his sister

564
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,893
She's so beautiful,
and they're such a nice family

565
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:17,968
l wonder why l mustn't marry her
and live with them

566
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:20,707
Live with them?
What do you think?

567
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:25,304
ls he the potter Chandan Seth to
give his daughter's hand in yours?

568
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:27,980
lt's Ram Singh!
- Big deal!

569
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:31,718
Just as we've got into his house,
we'll get into his heart too

570
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:33,922
Really?

571
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:42,662
Know what Pinki?
l'm very happy with your brother

572
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:46,734
lt was great of him to let
Tara and Sitara stay in your house

573
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:52,007
For what Tara and Sitara have done,
the house is nothing

574
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:54,774
They deserve a place
in our hearts

575
00:53:57,347 --> 00:54:00,748
Sitara's such a he-man.
He's so brave

576
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,350
Bunty wasn't saved by Sitara alone

577
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:07,020
Even Tara risked his life
to save him

578
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:11,758
He's so brave. l'm surprised how he
beat them up, even in a wheelchair

579
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:17,231
With a brother like Sitara,
what's a wheelchair...

580
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:19,532
you can deliver the punch
even from a bed!

581
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:23,366
Why're you giving Sitara
all the credit?

582
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:29,040
l'm talking about both of them.
- But l could hear only about one

583
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:31,242
Because you've been talking
about the other

584
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:32,575
Oh yes!

585
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,713
l forgot, l must leave now.
l'm getting late for the college

586
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:40,379
l've got to meet the doctor
and ask him about Tara's legs

587
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:45,387
But you stay here. You never know.
Sitara might spring here

588
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:02,868
My love...

589
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:07,415
my beloved...

590
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:11,421
my love...

591
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:23,029
l'm your beloved...

592
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:28,435
l'm a lover...

593
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,430
l've given you my heart

594
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:38,845
l'm a lover...

595
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:42,182
l've given you my heart

596
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:56,193
Give my beloved to me...

597
00:55:56,667 --> 00:56:04,005
l've pleaded with God,
l've wept on every shoulder

598
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:06,000
l have wept so much

599
00:56:06,276 --> 00:56:10,804
My love, l have
given my heart to you

600
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:21,822
Give me my beloved...

601
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:29,154
l've pleaded with God,
l've wept on every shoulder

602
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:14,133
My beloved, l seek...

603
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:17,342
at every beautiful twist
love takes

604
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:23,942
To my house she shall come some day,
leaving everything behind

605
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:27,988
You're the one
who lingers in my breath

606
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:31,891
You're the one
l always think about

607
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:46,198
l'm crazy about her...

608
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:51,180
l'd tell her, if l met her...

609
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:53,572
l'm your beloved

610
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:56,909
Your beloved

611
00:57:57,587 --> 00:58:00,579
You're my lover...

612
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:04,316
you're the one
l have given my heart to

613
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:13,398
Sweetheart...

614
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:20,405
O beloved...

615
00:58:24,614 --> 00:58:27,014
my love...

616
00:58:57,781 --> 00:58:59,442
Where has is gone?

617
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:16,461
What are you doing?

618
00:59:19,135 --> 00:59:22,070
Obviously, l can't swim
in a bathtub

619
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:27,006
l've been trying to commit suicide.
- What?

620
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:31,346
Yes, there must be a hilltop
in your city?

621
00:59:32,082 --> 00:59:35,279
There is. Why?
- So take me there...

622
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:39,086
and give me a gentle kick,
l'll fall off

623
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:43,181
What are you talking about?
- l have another idea

624
00:59:43,593 --> 00:59:45,686
Hold my face like this...

625
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:51,695
and shove it in the tub.
Hold it down firmly, with your foot

626
00:59:52,102 --> 00:59:55,299
Till l stop breathing,
don't take your foot off

627
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:59,038
l've made a lot of unsuccessful
attempts at suicide

628
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:06,447
Look at this book. lt has 250 ways
of overcoming your disability

629
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:09,716
You will be able to walk again,
run again...

630
01:00:10,053 --> 01:00:13,716
and maybe even dance with me too.
- Dance?

631
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:17,716
Will l be able to walk again?
- Certainly

632
01:00:18,128 --> 01:00:22,394
You mean, l can run...?
l can take your hand and run?!

633
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:37,471
Pinki's dress...?
Why's it here?

634
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:42,149
The lame-duck hasn't
jumped her, or has he?

635
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:04,164
Sitara... you're back early.
- Early?

636
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:09,170
l think l'm too late.
- Not at all

637
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:16,183
Give me an explanation.
- Explain what...?

638
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:20,789
She was here to cure a cripple!
- Cure...? There you go!

639
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:29,788
You're the elder brother
and you push your kid brother?

640
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,795
lt isn't two days since we got here,
and you've gone so far ahead!

641
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:37,163
l planned on going deeper...
right to the altar

642
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,799
Come to your senses!

643
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:42,407
We're here to escape,
not to play grooms!

644
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:47,815
lf only Ram Singh saw what l did, he'd
have made a real cripple out of you!

645
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:52,485
What will Ram Singh do?
l'm not entering his sister's life

646
01:01:52,822 --> 01:01:56,155
His sister's coming into my life!
- Really?

647
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:03,424
l smile to myself when l think
how tickled l'll be...

648
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:10,170
when his sister massages my legs.
l can laugh already

649
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,370
Tara, did you feel any pain?

650
01:02:18,982 --> 01:02:21,576
l felt something,
but it wasn't pain

651
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:24,245
No? You will now

652
01:02:26,856 --> 01:02:30,189
Did you feel any pain now?
- lt wasn't pain

653
01:02:30,593 --> 01:02:33,585
And why're you smiling?
- l smile because l see...

654
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,363
how concerned you are
about my cure

655
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:42,871
You're putting your heart into it.
You're leaving nothing to chance

656
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:46,271
l think this stick is a fake

657
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:51,209
With a little stick
you're out to cure me, Pinki

658
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:54,278
And so many big ones
are broken already

659
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:57,885
Look at that.
- What?

660
01:02:58,688 --> 01:03:03,682
Sister, throw away that little stick.
l'll use this whip on Tara's legs...

661
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:07,621
and make him feel the pain!
Out of my way!

662
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:12,897
Brother, why's the whole family
bent on curing me?

663
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:18,103
Why's this guy charging at me?
Ask him to hold on

664
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:23,241
l can't. When Ram Singh
can't control him, how can l?

665
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:27,079
l've never taken
such a huge stick!

666
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,912
This is a well-oiled stick!

667
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:32,514
lt has squeezed the life
out of several men!

668
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:35,914
One blow with this stick and...
- Handle him, brother

669
01:03:36,326 --> 01:03:37,918
He's mad

670
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:39,628
He's a monkey!

671
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:47,195
There goes

672
01:03:54,944 --> 01:03:56,935
My leg...

673
01:03:57,947 --> 01:04:00,939
Why're you hitting me?
l was only curing you!

674
01:04:01,284 --> 01:04:03,479
l was curing you too

675
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:09,282
Give him a banana.
- Yes. For extra energy

676
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:11,353
Here you are

677
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:15,088
No one can cure him!
- Hush. You mustn't say such things

678
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:18,958
l'll surely be cured...
with love

679
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:29,539
l say, Pinki...

680
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:32,709
Sitara? How are you?
- Wonderful

681
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:37,542
l say, what are you doing
with such fat books?

682
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,481
l'm trying to find a new cure
for Tara

683
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:44,657
A new cure for Tara?
- Because he can't walk

684
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:47,656
l'm trying to find a cure
that will help him move around

685
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:51,797
Listen to me.
Tara's actually hungry for love

686
01:04:52,135 --> 01:04:55,195
No amount of beating
can ever cure him

687
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,504
So what am l to do?
Could you suggest something?

688
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:08,012
You ought to produce
the heat in him

689
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:15,351
lgnite a fire in his body.
So that he burns in the fire...

690
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:21,163
runs helter skelter,
cries, howls, jumps around...

691
01:05:21,698 --> 01:05:25,361
you get me, don't you?
- Yes

692
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:29,737
Tea

693
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:34,169
Tell me something, Chhotu.
How do you start a fire?

694
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,034
With petrol

695
01:05:36,746 --> 01:05:43,242
Start the fire with petrol,
and he'll race around like a car

696
01:05:43,586 --> 01:05:45,281
All right

697
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:49,552
That's the shock-therapy!

698
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:57,059
There's mischief
in the air today...

699
01:05:58,401 --> 01:06:04,067
it's terribly mischievous today...

700
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:10,074
A storm is coming

701
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:15,079
That's my line... stop singing

702
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:19,543
Pinki... why're you watering
the place around me?

703
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:23,450
lt isn't water. lt's petrol

704
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,522
l use my hands on the wheelchair,
why use petrol?

705
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:30,162
lt isn't to run your wheelchair,
it's to make you run

706
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,661
Me...?
- This is shock therapy

707
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:36,936
They find a new therapy
for me every day

708
01:06:37,273 --> 01:06:40,265
l wonder what she'll do...
she won't start a fire, l hope

709
01:06:43,112 --> 01:06:47,811
The dark clouds
move in the skies...

710
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:51,114
every bud...

711
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:54,114
casts a suspicious
glance at me

712
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,116
My God!

713
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:22,146
Escaped!

714
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:30,557
Escaped, finally!

715
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:35,722
You ran away even before
the cure could work!

716
01:07:36,065 --> 01:07:38,966
l couldn't help it...
you don't understand

717
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:42,668
Where do you get such
great ideas from?

718
01:07:43,005 --> 01:07:44,870
As if it was my idea.
- Whose was it?

719
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:47,506
lt was your brother Sitara's

720
01:07:49,178 --> 01:07:52,375
So he's the brains
behind this sight?

721
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:55,180
Where's the genius?

722
01:07:57,186 --> 01:07:58,778
Where's he?

723
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:02,783
Sitara, l feel great love
for you today

724
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:05,617
So, embrace me.
- Let me complete my line

725
01:08:06,996 --> 01:08:13,458
This is Pinki's book.
lt has 250 cures for my impairment

726
01:08:13,903 --> 01:08:16,531
And you gave her
an extra tip!

727
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,671
l merely told her to produce
the heat of love in your body

728
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:24,673
The heat of love is something...

729
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:26,872
and setting the body on fire
is yet something else

730
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:29,207
She was setting my body on fire.
- On fire...?

731
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:35,853
Hide me somewhere...
she seems to have found another cure

732
01:08:36,192 --> 01:08:40,652
Hold on. Let me bowl her out.
- No... l'm bowling her out

733
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,464
Can't l at least hold her?
- Go ahead

734
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:46,224
Maintain the distance

735
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:46,625
My enemy...

736
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:50,724
this is a beautiful moment

737
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:58,570
My foe... a beauty stands
for your love

738
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:02,636
Take me in your embrace...

739
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:06,310
think of nothing else

740
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,356
You're a woman,
a mischievous girl...

741
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:51,049
l'm an innocent boy

742
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:54,521
l'm a priest's son,
related to those who worship

743
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:57,861
You're a big name...

744
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:02,064
Me, an enemy...?
No way

745
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:44,209
l will keep awake.
l'll keep you awake too...

746
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:46,981
all night

747
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:50,214
Let my pining be sated...

748
01:11:50,553 --> 01:11:54,421
do something about it

749
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:58,882
My heart beats
in loneliness...

750
01:11:59,228 --> 01:12:02,595
there's no one else
at home, my love

751
01:12:03,366 --> 01:12:07,234
So come into my arms

752
01:12:44,707 --> 01:12:45,799
Listen, lady...

753
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:49,940
listen, Goddess!

754
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:53,505
Someone tell her...

755
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:57,741
the lndian woman is most beautiful
and talented

756
01:12:58,187 --> 01:13:00,485
But l don't want to be captured

757
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:05,925
My patience is breaking,
l'm slipping...

758
01:13:06,262 --> 01:13:09,493
stop, stop, stop

759
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:16,129
The curtains are drawn

760
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:20,160
All windows are shut

761
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,971
For a while...

762
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,571
have all the fun you want to

763
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:32,271
My pining is soaring...

764
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:36,276
how can l remain
in my senses?

765
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:39,916
don't stop me anymore, my love

766
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:53,931
O enemy...
it's a beautiful moment

767
01:14:54,403 --> 01:15:01,775
This youth craves
for your love

768
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:05,609
Take me in your arms...

769
01:15:06,348 --> 01:15:09,613
don't think of anything else

770
01:15:12,421 --> 01:15:15,413
Think of nothing else

771
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:31,439
Tara's jumping on his feet!

772
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:34,171
Let me watch!

773
01:15:34,543 --> 01:15:38,377
Tara, you're on your feet...?
Are you out of your mind?

774
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:41,349
What have l done?

775
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:45,379
Tara! You're standing on your feet!

776
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:48,789
l have cured you!

777
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:53,125
Shake hands!
Tara has recovered!

778
01:15:53,462 --> 01:15:55,327
l guess, you guys
have gone blind

779
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:59,327
He's standing on his feet!
Congratulations!

780
01:15:59,668 --> 01:16:02,899
Heed my prayer now, sirs!
l'm very poor man...

781
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:05,230
with a mother, two brothers
and three sisters

782
01:16:05,574 --> 01:16:07,565
Get your mother married,
find jobs for your sisters...

783
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:09,676
and get your brothers wedded.
- l can't get my mother married

784
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:12,143
l'll deal with that. Go away.
- l can't get her married

785
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:14,676
Get lost.
- Move it

786
01:16:19,555 --> 01:16:23,150
l'm feeling great love for you.
- Don't tell me

787
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:27,088
l wrote about fifty or sixty
duets for you

788
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:31,058
And you stand up in a single duet?
- l'm a Punjabi, you know!

789
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:36,030
l can't hold! That's why
the girl's clean bowled!

790
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:46,081
Mr Cobra, your wound has healed,
the fracture has been set right too

791
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:50,509
l've been asking you
to try and walk around

792
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:55,446
You don't respond to anything l say.
- l can't walk, doctor

793
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:59,192
At this rate, you'll never
be able to walk all your life

794
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:01,519
You were hurt only in one leg...
- Watch it

795
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:05,392
l've read about a patient
in a medical journal

796
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:09,135
He was crippled in both legs.
Only because of his will power...

797
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:11,462
he can walk and move around today.
Read it

798
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:15,402
l don't want to read it...
- For inspiration. Read it

799
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,479
This is amazing inspiration

800
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:33,760
Had you shown it to me earlier, l'd
have been running at the Asian Games

801
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:37,088
l'd have won a medal for lndia.
- Good!

802
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:40,425
l want to sit up.
- Certainly

803
01:17:40,769 --> 01:17:42,430
Open that.
- Of course

804
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,568
l want to sit

805
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:53,475
l can... sit up.
- Of course

806
01:17:53,782 --> 01:17:57,479
Let him keep lying, doctor.
Else, we'll be put to sleep

807
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:02,314
Hush... this is the treatment.
- Doctor... can l stand?

808
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:05,023
Of course!

809
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:09,890
Help me to my feet, doctor.
l want to stand

810
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:15,603
Easy...
- l can stand!

811
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:20,240
Let him sit, doctor.
- Shut up. He's being treated

812
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:22,942
Can l walk, doctor?
- Oh yes

813
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:24,501
Carefully

814
01:18:29,518 --> 01:18:31,611
You don't know him, doctor. ln a
little while, he'll ask if he can run!

815
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:35,822
l think l can run, doctor.
- Of course you can run

816
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:39,494
Let him run... it's the cure.
- l can run

817
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:41,159
Slowly

818
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:44,829
He'll run away!
- Exactly! l want him to run

819
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:51,062
Let me go! l can run.
You are great, doctor

820
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:55,840
Watch it... there's a glass-pane ahead.
- Stop him!

821
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,610
Where has he gone?
- He has run away!

822
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:09,515
l told you and you said
it was a cure!

823
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:12,383
After him! Get him!

824
01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:24,539
Wait there... shoot him
in the leg!

825
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:30,879
Not his legs, l've just
treated his leg

826
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:46,650
Don't you think our life has changed,
ever since we've come here?

827
01:19:47,062 --> 01:19:52,090
lt has changed, no doubt.
We haven't committed any robbery...

828
01:19:52,468 --> 01:19:58,407
nor theft, nor picked a pocket.
- That's not what l'm talking about

829
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:04,643
l'm talking about the moonlike beauty.
About Pinki, that is

830
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:09,713
She picked me up from the wheelchair
and transported me to her heart

831
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:15,352
l say, Tara. Priti's made a place
for herself in my heart

832
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:18,558
Why don't we live here then?

833
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:24,593
Don't you think this is a much better
life than the one we led earlier?

834
01:20:24,933 --> 01:20:28,596
What did we have anyway?
Running away from the cops...

835
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:31,599
and Cobra?
- Don't even talk about Cobra!

836
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:37,435
He's bitten us black and blue.
- l say, brother

837
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,639
We'll swim across
this river of love

838
01:20:42,951 --> 01:20:46,944
Let's kick this wheelchair
together!

839
01:21:29,428 --> 01:21:30,986
1 24...

840
01:21:31,363 --> 01:21:33,024
1 25...

841
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:34,956
1 26...

842
01:21:40,506 --> 01:21:44,567
What news have you brought
from Ram Singh?

843
01:22:13,405 --> 01:22:15,771
Have you had enough of the cells...

844
01:22:16,442 --> 01:22:19,605
that you've called me out
for a thrashing today?

845
01:22:20,613 --> 01:22:24,743
Even if you change the location,
you'll ask the same old questions

846
01:22:26,552 --> 01:22:32,047
Your first question: Where is the
ammunition you stole from the army?

847
01:22:34,426 --> 01:22:38,863
Your second question: Whom have
you sold the ammunition to?

848
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:44,894
Third question:
Where is your hideout?

849
01:22:45,437 --> 01:22:48,634
Right...?
- You forgot my fourth question

850
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:53,641
Where are your friends hiding?
- That question, l'll surely answer

851
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:57,982
My friends are close by

852
01:22:58,817 --> 01:23:01,445
Plans to rescue me are also in place

853
01:23:03,656 --> 01:23:05,851
The day l'm free...

854
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:09,953
you'll be finished, Ram Singh

855
01:23:10,663 --> 01:23:12,654
l'll give you the opportunity
right now

856
01:23:12,998 --> 01:23:15,057
Run away from here
and finish me

857
01:23:15,668 --> 01:23:18,000
You think you're very brave?

858
01:23:18,404 --> 01:23:20,668
Try crossing the main gate
and prove it

859
01:23:22,675 --> 01:23:25,667
l'm the only one standing
between you and your freedom

860
01:23:26,478 --> 01:23:28,673
No one will interfere

861
01:23:30,449 --> 01:23:32,917
With the handcuffs?
- Release him

862
01:23:38,857 --> 01:23:42,088
But remember something. lf l catch
you in the first attempt...

863
01:23:42,428 --> 01:23:46,091
you're getting ten blows.
The second time... five

864
01:23:46,765 --> 01:23:49,700
ln the third attempt, you won't be
able to take even one blow

865
01:23:50,769 --> 01:23:51,758
Go on

866
01:23:56,842 --> 01:23:58,275
Soldiers...

867
01:23:59,078 --> 01:24:02,411
this is Ram Singh.
Nobody will stop Panther

868
01:24:02,781 --> 01:24:05,011
Let him go anywhere he wants to

869
01:25:17,589 --> 01:25:20,854
Traitor! You threaten
a soldier with death?

870
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:45,041
That was four blows, Ram Singh.
Just one to go, okay?

871
01:25:45,818 --> 01:25:48,048
Hit me.
- The final blow, eh?

872
01:25:54,827 --> 01:25:59,161
Ladies, listen...
l'm a very poor man

873
01:25:59,498 --> 01:26:01,830
l have a mother, three sisters
and two brothers

874
01:26:02,167 --> 01:26:05,500
All three have got to be married.
How would Tara and Sitara be...

875
01:26:05,838 --> 01:26:08,500
for two of my sisters?
- Not good at all

876
01:26:08,841 --> 01:26:12,242
What's wrong with them?
- Go and find other suitors

877
01:26:12,578 --> 01:26:17,538
l'll do that if l can leave the house.
You won't let me go anywhere

878
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:21,212
By the way, why did you
say that, Priti?

879
01:26:21,587 --> 01:26:25,683
Obviously! He spoke of getting my
Sitara married to one of his sisters!

880
01:26:26,024 --> 01:26:29,653
Have you noticed his personality?
He's so handsome

881
01:27:10,836 --> 01:27:14,704
With the glitter of gold...

882
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:25,617
with the sparkle of silver...

883
01:27:30,856 --> 01:27:35,725
it was when the juice
of roses was extracted...

884
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:41,933
my beauty, my love...

885
01:27:43,735 --> 01:27:46,033
was created

886
01:28:16,001 --> 01:28:21,166
Those who look at me,
keep looking...

887
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:28,404
l'm the one they always
think about

888
01:28:31,984 --> 01:28:35,283
Take me in your arms, my love...

889
01:28:37,055 --> 01:28:40,718
make love to me

890
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:46,756
A bit concealed...

891
01:28:49,801 --> 01:28:54,670
the mischief of your beauty...

892
01:28:57,042 --> 01:29:01,001
it was when the juice
of roses was extracted...

893
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:08,011
your beauty, my love...

894
01:29:09,788 --> 01:29:12,256
was crafted

895
01:29:23,035 --> 01:29:24,593
Psst to you!

896
01:29:25,037 --> 01:29:26,026
Back again!

897
01:29:26,271 --> 01:29:30,708
This is Cobra speaking.
- Lovely voice. Call for you

898
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:34,035
Lovely voice...?
Must be my girlfriend

899
01:29:34,846 --> 01:29:36,837
Listen to the romantic chat
l have with her

900
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,150
Where are you, darling?
- This is Cobra

901
01:29:41,486 --> 01:29:46,719
Which cobra is this?
ls it the one we defanged...

902
01:29:47,059 --> 01:29:54,192
and made a public mockery of?
- This is Cobra, your father!

903
01:29:56,234 --> 01:29:59,761
lt was Cobra calling.
- l know

904
01:30:00,105 --> 01:30:02,471
Why did you give it to me then?
- l was scared

905
01:30:02,808 --> 01:30:06,266
l understand. l'm scared too.
- Let's sit down

906
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:09,770
Could he still be on the line?

907
01:30:13,885 --> 01:30:15,182
Still holding

908
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,750
Tara, Sitara...
please come and sit down

909
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:20,285
Have something to eat,
why're you standing there?

910
01:30:22,094 --> 01:30:25,086
lf you're not hungry, could l have
some juice served to you?

911
01:30:27,032 --> 01:30:29,057
What's the matter, son?
You boys look worried

912
01:30:29,401 --> 01:30:33,497
No worry...
it's just a bit of tension

913
01:30:33,872 --> 01:30:38,104
Actually, both of us had
the same nightmare last night

914
01:30:38,443 --> 01:30:43,278
A nightmare...? What was it about?
- We saw a snake... a cobra

915
01:30:44,116 --> 01:30:48,109
A venomous cobra.
- That's a very bad omen

916
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:53,280
When you have a nightmare like that,
it means your enemy's after you

917
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:59,758
But you needn't worry. Just find
a small snake and feed it some milk

918
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:03,533
How about feeding Chhotu instead?
- Good idea

919
01:31:04,136 --> 01:31:10,132
The headlines: The dreaded terrorist
Cobra has escaped from police custody

920
01:31:13,678 --> 01:31:15,942
Cobra has escaped from jail
on several occasions earlier...

921
01:31:16,281 --> 01:31:18,146
and the police are looking for him

922
01:31:22,954 --> 01:31:26,685
Know when a terrorist breaks jail?
- When?

923
01:31:27,159 --> 01:31:29,821
When he wants to extract revenge
from his enemies

924
01:31:30,162 --> 01:31:33,825
l saw it in Sholay
Gabbar runs away from jail...

925
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:37,727
and takes revenge from his enemy.
Cobra's taking revenge too

926
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:42,834
What's wrong with him...?
He hasn't even had any lunch

927
01:31:43,175 --> 01:31:45,837
He swallowed fear at breakfast

928
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:50,507
But why are you trembling?
- As if l'd be afraid!

929
01:32:05,397 --> 01:32:09,356
Brother! Cobra is here!
- Hit him!

930
01:32:15,207 --> 01:32:17,869
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

931
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:22,613
That's my question. Why are you
sleeping here, instead of the bedroom?

932
01:32:22,948 --> 01:32:27,351
Moron! We are guests and
guests can sleep anywhere

933
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:31,211
What are you doing here?
- Mr Ram Singh is leaving...

934
01:32:31,556 --> 01:32:35,356
for the outpost for a couple of days.
l came to clean the jeep

935
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:41,021
And these guys sleep just anywhere

936
01:32:44,236 --> 01:32:48,229
Cobra wouldn't have come here,
for fear of confronting Ram Singh

937
01:32:48,573 --> 01:32:53,033
But if Ram Singh himself leaves,
what happens of our safety?

938
01:32:53,945 --> 01:32:56,379
Say something.
- Know what?

939
01:32:57,115 --> 01:32:58,912
l have an idea.
- Shoot

940
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:01,719
Why don't we go to the border
with Ram Singh...

941
01:33:02,053 --> 01:33:05,250
and cross the fence
when we get the opportunity?

942
01:33:05,857 --> 01:33:07,916
What made you plan a trip
to the border with me?

943
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,093
We wanted to ask you something
about our character

944
01:33:11,429 --> 01:33:14,921
You ask him, brother.
- Me...? No, you ask him

945
01:33:15,267 --> 01:33:17,258
Go ahead and ask... what is it?

946
01:33:23,275 --> 01:33:25,266
Move it! Move!

947
01:33:26,278 --> 01:33:27,609
Freeze!

948
01:33:34,286 --> 01:33:35,548
Get in!

949
01:33:52,003 --> 01:33:53,630
Here they are

950
01:34:14,326 --> 01:34:18,319
Two more guys are coming

951
01:34:37,148 --> 01:34:38,342
Here you are

952
01:34:46,358 --> 01:34:48,349
lt won't go off.
- Try again

953
01:34:49,361 --> 01:34:51,352
lt went off,
but it didn't hit him

954
01:34:55,867 --> 01:34:58,165
The bullet hit his leg!

955
01:35:03,275 --> 01:35:07,371
From your face...

956
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:12,379
take off the mask...

957
01:35:13,385 --> 01:35:16,115
dear sir

958
01:35:16,521 --> 01:35:19,046
Let the veil be,
do not take it off

959
01:35:19,391 --> 01:35:22,189
lf the veil is taken off...
- Big deal?

960
01:35:22,527 --> 01:35:25,087
You've got a bullet in the leg
and you're singing songs?

961
01:35:25,397 --> 01:35:27,991
What's so special about him?

962
01:35:42,414 --> 01:35:44,405
You've shot me in the leg!

963
01:35:44,683 --> 01:35:48,119
You shot him in the leg again!
- lt's his mistake actually

964
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,854
His face has value in police circles
and the public

965
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:53,180
But how will the public know
what's behind the mask?

966
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:55,755
Let me drop the curtains
on your life!

967
01:35:57,429 --> 01:36:00,728
You don't even know...

968
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:03,999
your days are getting over

969
01:36:04,436 --> 01:36:07,872
The impossible is
about to happen...

970
01:36:08,206 --> 01:36:11,073
start counting your days

971
01:36:11,443 --> 01:36:14,879
One, two, three, four...
- Five, six, seven, eight...

972
01:36:15,213 --> 01:36:18,444
add it up to eleven,
buddy boy

973
01:36:24,155 --> 01:36:27,454
One and one is eleven...

974
01:36:27,859 --> 01:36:30,453
my friend

975
01:36:49,481 --> 01:36:51,813
l say...
- Tell me

976
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:54,141
Why has Ram Singh brought us here?

977
01:36:54,486 --> 01:36:59,480
Looks like we're getting the
huge reward on Cobra's head

978
01:37:00,425 --> 01:37:03,326
l've always thought that
the two of us are great men

979
01:37:03,661 --> 01:37:06,152
But time has always
prevented our success

980
01:37:06,498 --> 01:37:09,490
With times changing...
- Ram Singh will change too

981
01:37:12,504 --> 01:37:16,804
Welcome, Ram Singh.
What do you want to ask now?

982
01:37:17,142 --> 01:37:19,702
Not ask, l've come to
tell you something

983
01:37:22,647 --> 01:37:23,636
What?

984
01:37:23,848 --> 01:37:29,514
Your brother Cobra, who wanted
to kidnap me and have you freed...

985
01:37:31,322 --> 01:37:33,187
has been killed

986
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:44,324
l want to tell you something more

987
01:37:45,303 --> 01:37:48,204
lt wasn't me or
a soldier who killed him

988
01:37:49,307 --> 01:37:51,867
He was slain by a couple
of brave civilians

989
01:38:00,285 --> 01:38:02,549
l've brought them with me,
so you can see...

990
01:38:02,887 --> 01:38:06,550
our civilians are no less
than soldiers

991
01:38:13,097 --> 01:38:15,691
ls this a death sentence for us?
- l don't know

992
01:38:16,367 --> 01:38:19,894
We always find happiness
to protect sorrow

993
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:22,069
l don't know. l'm fed up

994
01:38:39,157 --> 01:38:44,595
Brother Panther, please don't pay
attention to what Ram Singh says

995
01:38:45,497 --> 01:38:48,898
Whatever happened was an accident.
- lt sure was

996
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:52,497
You could say brother Cobra
was destined to die

997
01:38:55,006 --> 01:38:59,033
And isn't God kind? He snatched
one brother from you...

998
01:38:59,377 --> 01:39:03,939
and gave you two brothers instead.
- Brothers. Buy one, get one free

999
01:39:06,618 --> 01:39:08,609
Brother Panther,
please be patient

1000
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:12,153
l will be patient

1001
01:39:12,524 --> 01:39:16,620
But your brother wasn't patient.
No wonder the scoundrel died!

1002
01:39:17,362 --> 01:39:19,353
The poor guy.
- Oh yes

1003
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:22,197
The day l escape from here...

1004
01:39:24,636 --> 01:39:26,729
l'll dig your graves

1005
01:39:27,071 --> 01:39:30,165
We're talking of patience
and he's talking of graves

1006
01:39:31,809 --> 01:39:34,778
Hold it. You might puke on his face

1007
01:39:44,889 --> 01:39:48,416
Why're you so sad?
Give me a smile

1008
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:52,656
What do you think of that car?

1009
01:39:55,266 --> 01:39:57,325
Let me take you for a drive.
- Where?

1010
01:39:57,669 --> 01:39:59,660
Wherever destiny takes us

1011
01:40:12,483 --> 01:40:16,476
Let's think it over again. Will we be
able to live without Pinki and Priti?

1012
01:40:16,821 --> 01:40:18,345
No, brother don't!

1013
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:22,888
We don't want to listen to the
tinkle of Pinki and Priti's bangles

1014
01:40:23,227 --> 01:40:25,354
We must heed the threat of Panther

1015
01:40:25,697 --> 01:40:28,393
Panther, who is caged...

1016
01:40:28,733 --> 01:40:33,295
he's baying for our blood

1017
01:40:33,705 --> 01:40:36,367
Turned your mind, didn't l?
- lf l say something...

1018
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:39,142
you'll lose your mind too
- What?

1019
01:40:39,477 --> 01:40:41,308
The car is gone

1020
01:41:11,943 --> 01:41:16,744
We've lost the dough,
but the goddesses are here

1021
01:41:17,582 --> 01:41:21,143
Let's forget what is gone and
appreciate what's coming our way

1022
01:41:27,692 --> 01:41:30,422
For beauty, we burn
in the fires of passion

1023
01:41:30,762 --> 01:41:34,163
Like wax, we melt

1024
01:41:34,565 --> 01:41:37,762
We're crazy, we sway

1025
01:41:38,236 --> 01:41:41,205
We slip up
and steady ourselves

1026
01:41:41,572 --> 01:41:46,441
There's no one
quite like us...

1027
01:41:46,778 --> 01:41:48,939
my love...

1028
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,775
One and one make eleven...

1029
01:41:55,787 --> 01:41:58,119
my love

1030
01:42:20,812 --> 01:42:23,007
Tara! Sitara!
Come on out!

1031
01:42:23,514 --> 01:42:28,508
What was that? Lightning? Thunder?
Or, has the roof come off?

1032
01:42:33,591 --> 01:42:36,389
What's up, son? What happened?
- l'm going to decide this today

1033
01:42:36,728 --> 01:42:39,424
Decide what?
- About Tara and Sitara's lives

1034
01:42:47,638 --> 01:42:50,630
You guys think l don't know
anything about you?

1035
01:42:50,975 --> 01:42:55,139
l know every thing. And today,
l've discovered your secret too

1036
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:56,640
l say, Tara...

1037
01:42:56,981 --> 01:43:00,144
looks like the lid has been blown
off our bank robbery

1038
01:43:04,622 --> 01:43:06,419
Stand right here

1039
01:43:06,858 --> 01:43:09,190
What are you girls doing there?
Come here

1040
01:43:15,933 --> 01:43:17,161
Hurry up

1041
01:43:24,642 --> 01:43:27,543
Lovely couples

1042
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:31,409
You think no one saw you
dancing and singing?

1043
01:43:37,655 --> 01:43:41,216
Every time l left for the border,
l always worried...

1044
01:43:41,559 --> 01:43:45,051
what would happen of my family,
if something happened to me

1045
01:43:47,598 --> 01:43:50,897
But l'm not worried anymore.
Even if something happens to me...

1046
01:43:51,235 --> 01:43:55,069
l know Tara and Sitara
will look after my family

1047
01:43:55,907 --> 01:44:00,901
l can't believe my luck that
l find such boys right at home

1048
01:44:05,483 --> 01:44:09,715
l'm so happy that you've finalised
a match for Priti and Pinki

1049
01:44:10,054 --> 01:44:12,579
Shouldn't you ask
Priti's parents too?

1050
01:44:12,924 --> 01:44:16,257
What's the problem? Take mother
and go over to their place

1051
01:44:16,928 --> 01:44:19,089
They won't find boys like these,
will they?

1052
01:44:19,931 --> 01:44:22,593
l'm so happy. lf Ram Singh
has sent the proposal...

1053
01:44:22,934 --> 01:44:26,927
it must be from a decent
and high ranking family

1054
01:44:27,638 --> 01:44:31,267
That's all right. But won't you
introduce the boys to us?

1055
01:44:31,943 --> 01:44:36,403
At once. Tara, Sitara...
don't feel shy

1056
01:44:36,747 --> 01:44:37,941
Come here

1057
01:44:42,119 --> 01:44:44,087
l say...

1058
01:44:44,956 --> 01:44:46,548
greetings

1059
01:44:49,894 --> 01:44:52,192
The brothers with
six bullets each

1060
01:44:54,232 --> 01:44:57,963
The same height and looks...
they'd look the same with beards

1061
01:44:58,703 --> 01:45:01,638
There were these scoundrels
who robbed my bank

1062
01:45:01,973 --> 01:45:05,966
These boys bear a striking
resemblance to those fellows

1063
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:10,371
We look like scoundrels and criminals
to him, although we're well dressed

1064
01:45:10,715 --> 01:45:12,774
lmagine what he'd say if were
were dressed in kurta-pajama!

1065
01:45:13,117 --> 01:45:16,382
l can't tolerate this...
- But l can tolerate it

1066
01:45:16,721 --> 01:45:21,181
We don't want a proposal like this one!
- Let me go ahead, if you don't want it

1067
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:23,554
Listen sons...

1068
01:45:23,995 --> 01:45:27,624
l was talking about
those two scoundrels

1069
01:45:27,999 --> 01:45:30,797
One of those scoundrels
looked just like you

1070
01:45:31,135 --> 01:45:33,399
He was talking of running
away with my daughter

1071
01:45:33,738 --> 01:45:36,206
Why're you calling us names
again and again?

1072
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:42,774
l told you we must leave.
- l'm abusing those two chaps

1073
01:45:43,147 --> 01:45:46,674
But we're offended.
- Why?

1074
01:45:47,018 --> 01:45:50,681
Obviously. We look alike.
- l see

1075
01:45:51,789 --> 01:45:53,689
Now tell me, which one of you
is the thief?

1076
01:45:54,025 --> 01:45:55,720
Both, in fact

1077
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:59,860
l want to know who's the thief
who stole my daughter's heart?

1078
01:46:00,197 --> 01:46:02,188
Who's my son-in-law?

1079
01:46:03,935 --> 01:46:06,369
l'm the one Mr Ram Singh sent.
- l see

1080
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:12,203
Let's hurry up. l'm getting late.
- This is my watch!

1081
01:46:13,344 --> 01:46:16,711
lt's mine! With a T for Tara!
- No, T stands for Tiku

1082
01:46:17,048 --> 01:46:20,211
lt's Tara!
You'll now say this S is yours

1083
01:46:21,953 --> 01:46:26,049
This S is my wife's !
- S stands for Sitara

1084
01:46:27,058 --> 01:46:29,720
Tara and Sitara.
- Strange coincidence

1085
01:46:30,061 --> 01:46:32,052
We bought them.
We got the receipts too

1086
01:46:32,229 --> 01:46:36,723
Come, let's sweeten our tongue.
- After bitterness comes sweet

1087
01:46:37,068 --> 01:46:39,059
Come, my boys

1088
01:46:40,871 --> 01:46:42,862
We know, you make very
good porridge, don't you?

1089
01:46:43,207 --> 01:46:46,734
Also cauliflower pancakes!
- How did you get to know? How...?

1090
01:46:47,078 --> 01:46:50,445
How many times will you ask...?
We know everything

1091
01:46:50,781 --> 01:46:53,875
This is the hall, there's the bedroom,
and a bathroom with a commode

1092
01:46:54,251 --> 01:46:57,482
The safe's over there.
- And a table, on which...

1093
01:46:57,855 --> 01:46:59,083
Hold it!

1094
01:47:12,069 --> 01:47:15,527
Let's discuss it with Mr Ram Singh
and finalise a date for the wedding

1095
01:47:15,873 --> 01:47:17,602
Your car keys, sir

1096
01:47:18,109 --> 01:47:20,100
Brother...
- l say?

1097
01:47:24,115 --> 01:47:25,912
lt's a surprise!

1098
01:47:26,117 --> 01:47:27,277
Found it!

1099
01:47:27,618 --> 01:47:29,609
Why's he rolling over the bonnet?

1100
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:36,286
Found it! The car!

1101
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:56,878
Get the stuff out, l say.
lt's going to make our lives

1102
01:47:57,214 --> 01:47:58,545
One moment

1103
01:48:00,151 --> 01:48:01,482
Who...?

1104
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:04,611
Your stuff is here

1105
01:48:06,157 --> 01:48:08,148
l'm getting it out.
- Your permanent stuff is here

1106
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:10,350
You take care of her...
l'll attend to this

1107
01:48:14,165 --> 01:48:15,962
What happened?
- Carry on

1108
01:48:16,167 --> 01:48:20,103
What's happened to him?
- l'm feeling shy... Carry on

1109
01:48:20,438 --> 01:48:22,770
Why've you come to meet me
so late in the night?

1110
01:48:23,174 --> 01:48:26,701
l couldn't help it.
l've found my heart after ages

1111
01:48:27,311 --> 01:48:29,871
Get a hold on your heart...
it's only for a few days

1112
01:48:30,181 --> 01:48:33,617
No way. l've spent
so many days without it

1113
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:36,181
l'm not letting it
slip out of my hands today

1114
01:48:36,787 --> 01:48:39,654
Go away, before someone comes here.
- Wide open

1115
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:42,515
What?
- Doors... here and there

1116
01:48:46,864 --> 01:48:48,855
Who's that...?

1117
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,191
Who is it? Tara and Sitara!

1118
01:48:51,535 --> 01:48:53,594
What are you doing here?
- This bag fell down.

1119
01:48:53,938 --> 01:48:55,872
We're putting it in

1120
01:48:56,874 --> 01:49:00,207
This is the bag in which those
thieves stuffed the loot!

1121
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:04,571
You boys have found my money!
You've found the bag!

1122
01:49:04,915 --> 01:49:06,906
You're like Gods to me!

1123
01:49:07,284 --> 01:49:09,878
Tara, Sitara...
the two of you are great!

1124
01:49:10,221 --> 01:49:15,716
Give us the bag.
- You are great guys! You're angels!

1125
01:49:34,411 --> 01:49:36,572
Every Romeo has left

1126
01:49:39,116 --> 01:49:41,516
Every lover-boy has left

1127
01:49:43,854 --> 01:49:45,719
This isn't love...

1128
01:49:46,056 --> 01:49:47,921
it isn't about lovers...

1129
01:49:48,259 --> 01:49:50,489
you're no friend...

1130
01:49:50,828 --> 01:49:54,525
your love...
is treacherous love

1131
01:50:05,042 --> 01:50:07,272
Every Romeo has left

1132
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,144
Every lover-boy has left

1133
01:50:14,585 --> 01:50:17,076
Let's not talk
about those crazy lovers

1134
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:22,489
Those fireflies
are better forgotten

1135
01:50:23,794 --> 01:50:25,762
lt wasn't love...

1136
01:50:26,096 --> 01:50:28,963
it wasn't about lovers...

1137
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:34,499
your love...
is treacherous love

1138
01:50:59,330 --> 01:51:02,561
Where's the show
of modesty anymore?

1139
01:51:04,101 --> 01:51:07,332
Where's the innocence
of yore?

1140
01:51:08,472 --> 01:51:10,565
The veil slips...

1141
01:51:11,075 --> 01:51:13,066
and nothing matters anymore

1142
01:51:13,344 --> 01:51:17,542
Nothing is sacred anymore,
the promises don't matter

1143
01:51:18,282 --> 01:51:21,683
Devastation is about to strike

1144
01:51:22,553 --> 01:51:25,351
Every Juliet has left...

1145
01:51:27,358 --> 01:51:29,918
every lover-girl has gone
into oblivion

1146
01:51:32,162 --> 01:51:34,892
Let's not talk
about those women...

1147
01:51:41,672 --> 01:51:46,974
it isn't love,
it isn't about lovers...

1148
01:51:47,378 --> 01:51:52,372
your love...
is full of deceit

1149
01:52:10,401 --> 01:52:12,062
Call the lover boy

1150
01:52:12,403 --> 01:52:14,064
Call lover-girl

1151
01:52:14,405 --> 01:52:15,997
Call Romeo

1152
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,101
Call Juliet over

1153
01:52:19,410 --> 01:52:21,401
Summon Sohni,
call Mahiwal

1154
01:52:21,612 --> 01:52:23,876
Bring Paro
and Devdas here

1155
01:52:24,214 --> 01:52:28,207
How many of them
will you bring...?

1156
01:52:31,422 --> 01:52:34,653
This is love only in name

1157
01:52:36,093 --> 01:52:39,426
What good is this joy?

1158
01:52:40,798 --> 01:52:44,757
When you're heart-broken,
left in the lurch

1159
01:52:45,202 --> 01:52:49,104
When your trust is betrayed...

1160
01:52:49,506 --> 01:52:53,135
The love in your eyes
is make believe

1161
01:52:54,445 --> 01:52:55,707
Every drunken lover has gone

1162
01:52:59,183 --> 01:53:01,777
Those special people
are no more

1163
01:53:04,154 --> 01:53:07,248
Don't even talk of
folk singers...

1164
01:53:08,659 --> 01:53:11,651
nor those who set
examples in true love

1165
01:53:13,464 --> 01:53:18,868
lt isn't about love,
or the beloved...

1166
01:53:19,203 --> 01:53:23,640
your love is treacherous

1167
01:53:53,804 --> 01:53:56,500
Love...

1168
01:54:05,516 --> 01:54:08,178
Brother, l don't believe it.
He looked like Cobra

1169
01:54:08,519 --> 01:54:10,510
Was he Cobra himself?

1170
01:54:16,527 --> 01:54:20,190
What a shameless man!
We threw you off the cliff...

1171
01:54:20,531 --> 01:54:23,523
and you still climb up?
- There was water down there...?

1172
01:54:23,867 --> 01:54:28,327
There was nothing.
God saved me

1173
01:54:28,672 --> 01:54:31,664
And now, you guys will do
just as l ask you to

1174
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:34,969
Why would God save him?
- Ask Him

1175
01:54:35,312 --> 01:54:38,281
Why would we listen to you?

1176
01:54:38,649 --> 01:54:41,083
We have always done the bidding
of only one person

1177
01:54:41,418 --> 01:54:45,548
Our mother!
- Your mother? Talk to her

1178
01:54:47,291 --> 01:54:48,781
Let me talk

1179
01:54:53,263 --> 01:54:55,731
Mother...? Why are you crying?

1180
01:54:56,066 --> 01:55:00,025
My son, these scoundrels have
kidnapped me and brought me here

1181
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:03,032
Where are the two of you?
- Brother, Mother's crying

1182
01:55:03,373 --> 01:55:05,307
Mother... are you all right?

1183
01:55:05,576 --> 01:55:11,378
These scoundrels have given me
nothing to eat... the rascals

1184
01:55:11,682 --> 01:55:13,980
Mother!
- Just you listen!

1185
01:55:14,384 --> 01:55:18,081
We're going to ruin your life,
you filthy...

1186
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:22,058
Don't hit my brother.
- No, brother... no

1187
01:55:22,392 --> 01:55:25,589
He has a gun and our mother.
lt's his day

1188
01:55:26,497 --> 01:55:29,466
So what's your problem?
- What do you want?

1189
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:34,066
Two things. Number one...
an entry into Ram Singh's house

1190
01:55:34,438 --> 01:55:39,273
l leave it to you to introduce me
as your paternal uncle or maternal

1191
01:55:40,477 --> 01:55:45,176
Number two: l want to
change my appearance

1192
01:55:45,716 --> 01:55:50,619
l'm sick of this beard and
l could be recognised too

1193
01:56:02,633 --> 01:56:06,626
Where was the need to bring all this?
- lt was necessary

1194
01:56:07,404 --> 01:56:11,636
lt's a token of goodwill.
And l'm no stranger

1195
01:56:12,109 --> 01:56:15,636
l'm the boys' maternal uncle.
- Uncle-snake-in-the-grass

1196
01:56:16,413 --> 01:56:17,402
He bites

1197
01:56:17,681 --> 01:56:20,081
You boys didn't tell me
you had an uncle too?

1198
01:56:20,417 --> 01:56:23,113
How could we? He sprang
before us only yesterday

1199
01:56:23,453 --> 01:56:28,220
When they were little children,
l went away to Africa

1200
01:56:28,592 --> 01:56:31,652
The tan has ruined his looks

1201
01:56:32,529 --> 01:56:36,863
My nephews are all praise for you

1202
01:56:37,434 --> 01:56:40,961
They say you've caught
the worst of criminals

1203
01:56:41,471 --> 01:56:47,307
Tell me something. Criminals
are normally held in jails

1204
01:56:47,678 --> 01:56:50,146
Where do you keep them?
- How can you ask such questions?

1205
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:53,347
Have some sweetmeats.
- l wasn't asking...

1206
01:56:53,684 --> 01:56:58,883
about anyone in particular. l only
asked where they keep the criminals

1207
01:56:59,389 --> 01:57:03,018
Some more, uncle.
- Let him ask, he's your uncle

1208
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,887
We hold dangerous criminals at
the Head Quarter's special cell

1209
01:57:07,464 --> 01:57:10,365
Special cell? You must have
very tight security then?

1210
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:15,695
Security? They have guns,
grenades... like this one

1211
01:57:16,473 --> 01:57:19,772
You mean even my nephews
can't get there?

1212
01:57:20,143 --> 01:57:22,168
No.
- Why not?

1213
01:57:22,512 --> 01:57:25,504
They're our heroes,
they've saved my life

1214
01:57:25,849 --> 01:57:29,114
ln any case, Tara's going
to marry my sister

1215
01:57:29,453 --> 01:57:32,183
Everyone there knows him.
He can go there whenever he wants to

1216
01:57:32,522 --> 01:57:36,049
You mean, l can't go there.
- No

1217
01:57:36,393 --> 01:57:42,229
Why not? During duty hours, relatives
can call on their folks at work

1218
01:57:43,467 --> 01:57:45,230
Wonderful

1219
01:57:45,636 --> 01:57:48,434
l have another question, Ram Singh...
- Try this, uncle

1220
01:57:48,805 --> 01:57:52,070
l'm sorry, by mistake
l gave you a chilli!

1221
01:57:52,743 --> 01:57:57,544
Bless you... but l love chillis.
- Really? So have another

1222
01:57:57,881 --> 01:58:01,749
Enough...
- Here's one more

1223
01:58:02,753 --> 01:58:03,947
Try another

1224
01:58:11,762 --> 01:58:15,755
Chhotu, you've brought uncle today?
- He wanted to see the regiment

1225
01:58:16,166 --> 01:58:18,760
Go ahead and show him around.
Go on

1226
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:22,102
This way, Uncle... this way

1227
01:58:24,775 --> 01:58:26,572
See the clout l wield?

1228
01:58:27,778 --> 01:58:30,576
l'm no lesser than Mr Ram Singh

1229
01:58:31,148 --> 01:58:34,083
Had you come alone, they've have
turned you away from the gate

1230
01:58:34,451 --> 01:58:37,784
They wouldn't have let you in, even
though you're Tara and Sitara's uncle

1231
01:58:38,789 --> 01:58:42,054
Chhotu's the one they respect!

1232
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:46,052
Nothing's happening to you
till you're with me

1233
01:58:46,463 --> 01:58:49,523
Come straight after me.
Don't turn anywhere...

1234
01:59:41,418 --> 01:59:44,854
Don't shoot! l'm not an enemy...
l'm Major Ram Singh's relative

1235
01:59:45,188 --> 01:59:46,587
Major Ram Singh's relative

1236
01:59:50,327 --> 01:59:54,855
l'm glad you've arrived...
or your guys would've shot me

1237
01:59:55,265 --> 01:59:57,426
Yes, they would.
This is restricted area

1238
01:59:57,667 --> 01:59:59,726
We have orders to shoot
at strangers

1239
01:59:59,870 --> 02:00:03,533
Major, you have very tight
security here. What's up?

1240
02:00:04,207 --> 02:00:06,869
We're holding a very dangerous
criminal here. Panther

1241
02:00:07,878 --> 02:00:10,210
Panther, did you say?

1242
02:00:11,014 --> 02:00:14,541
He's the criminal whose brother
my nephews have killed!

1243
02:00:14,951 --> 02:00:19,217
He has threatened to
come out of jail and...

1244
02:00:19,623 --> 02:00:23,491
Not to worry, Uncle.
He can never escape

1245
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:25,951
Not only do we have
very tight security...

1246
02:00:26,229 --> 02:00:30,495
the keys to the cell in which he's
locked is always in my custody

1247
02:00:30,901 --> 02:00:32,892
lt's safely kept
in my safe at home

1248
02:00:46,383 --> 02:00:48,715
Caught you, didn't l?
- What do you mean?

1249
02:00:49,252 --> 02:00:53,245
l know why you're secretly
moving around at this moment

1250
02:00:53,723 --> 02:00:55,588
What for?
- To steal

1251
02:00:56,059 --> 02:00:58,186
Steal...?
- Afraid, aren't you?

1252
02:00:58,495 --> 02:01:01,726
But you won't find anything there.
- Where ?

1253
02:01:01,998 --> 02:01:04,330
ln the kitchen.
You're hungry, aren't you?

1254
02:01:07,737 --> 02:01:09,728
You're hungry, right?
- Yes

1255
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:11,271
l'll go and cook something.
- Hush!

1256
02:01:11,942 --> 02:01:14,934
All are sleeping.
- May l go and cook something for you?

1257
02:01:15,345 --> 02:01:17,279
My hunger has vanished

1258
02:01:18,548 --> 02:01:20,379
Go on. Go

1259
02:02:28,018 --> 02:02:29,451
Dad! Mom!

1260
02:02:30,353 --> 02:02:33,516
What happened?
Let them sleep

1261
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:37,025
l've got to leave early for school.
lf l don't carry my fees...

1262
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,022
my teacher's going to kill me.
- So take the money from Mummy's purse

1263
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:42,625
But let them sleep. Go ahead

1264
02:03:01,117 --> 02:03:03,415
Where does Mummy
keep her purse?

1265
02:03:05,722 --> 02:03:07,713
She leaves the cupboard open!

1266
02:03:14,064 --> 02:03:19,627
Moron, you can't see anything.
- The purse is in the cupboard

1267
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:24,666
lt's not there!
You take a look

1268
02:03:25,075 --> 02:03:27,066
lf l find the purse,
l'm going to fix you good

1269
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:43,415
lt's right here

1270
02:03:45,328 --> 02:03:47,762
What's this ?
- l couldn't see it

1271
02:03:48,098 --> 02:03:50,089
Can you ever see anything
except food?

1272
02:03:50,433 --> 02:03:52,492
You'll find the rossogollas,
wherever they are

1273
02:04:18,862 --> 02:04:20,124
Tara...
- Yes, Sitara

1274
02:04:20,463 --> 02:04:23,796
Cobra's disappeared.
- He must be in the loo

1275
02:04:24,134 --> 02:04:26,125
He's not there.
- He's dark-skinned...

1276
02:04:26,469 --> 02:04:28,801
switch on the lights,
you'll find him

1277
02:04:29,139 --> 02:04:31,539
Get up, will you?
- What rubbish is this?

1278
02:04:31,875 --> 02:04:33,934
Let me sleep.
- l'm feeling scared!

1279
02:04:34,277 --> 02:04:36,802
Scared...? Scared of what?
- Cobra's not gone...

1280
02:04:37,147 --> 02:04:41,277
to free Panther, has he?
- lf he goes to free Panther...

1281
02:04:41,618 --> 02:04:44,610
it's good news for us.
He'll fall to the security's bullets

1282
02:04:44,954 --> 02:04:46,615
The bloody...
- Rat!

1283
02:04:46,956 --> 02:04:49,618
Not rat, the bloody...
- Rat!

1284
02:04:49,959 --> 02:04:52,689
Yes... rat!
- No, my boys

1285
02:04:53,029 --> 02:04:57,159
lf l die, who'll give you
the whereabouts of your mother?

1286
02:04:57,500 --> 02:05:01,493
Tell us something... where did you
disappear in the middle of the night?

1287
02:05:04,107 --> 02:05:07,440
To have this key made.
- lsn't that a key we heard of?

1288
02:05:07,777 --> 02:05:11,838
You mean we saw it earlier.
- We've broken so many locks

1289
02:05:12,182 --> 02:05:17,176
Must be the key to one of them.
- This is the key to Panther's freedom

1290
02:05:20,323 --> 02:05:22,655
Why has he thrown
the key in our face?

1291
02:05:22,992 --> 02:05:24,983
Explain this... why have you
thrown the key in our face?

1292
02:05:25,195 --> 02:05:29,325
l'll tell you. Because...
why did you throw it?

1293
02:05:29,666 --> 02:05:35,832
With that key, you're going to
free my brother Panther tonight

1294
02:05:36,206 --> 02:05:39,334
Why will the two of us
free your brother?

1295
02:05:39,909 --> 02:05:44,676
Because if you refuse to do that,
the Sun will rise tomorrow...

1296
02:05:45,014 --> 02:05:47,482
but your poor mother will
not see the new dawn

1297
02:05:47,917 --> 02:05:50,886
You're a bloody...
- Rat!

1298
02:05:51,221 --> 02:05:54,213
We'll do it for you...
let's shake paws!

1299
02:06:07,237 --> 02:06:09,899
Lower the beam.
- Tara?

1300
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:14,336
Can't be you in both places, can you?
The officer's here, open up quickly

1301
02:06:15,245 --> 02:06:17,236
Raise the barrier. Quick

1302
02:06:56,085 --> 02:06:59,077
Mr Ram Singh's car?
- He has just arrived

1303
02:07:00,023 --> 02:07:01,615
At this hour?

1304
02:07:06,095 --> 02:07:08,461
Must l awaken him?
- With love

1305
02:07:09,299 --> 02:07:10,425
Shall l?

1306
02:07:12,302 --> 02:07:13,963
l say, brother!

1307
02:07:14,304 --> 02:07:16,272
Brother Panther...

1308
02:07:16,573 --> 02:07:18,973
He's not reacting,
he's not dead, is he?

1309
02:07:19,309 --> 02:07:21,834
Say nice things...
let me try

1310
02:07:22,312 --> 02:07:27,113
Brother Panther...
you're not dead, are you?

1311
02:07:28,318 --> 02:07:30,980
You're the ones who are
going to die. At my hands

1312
02:07:31,321 --> 02:07:32,845
You can't escape

1313
02:07:41,264 --> 02:07:42,925
Tara and Sitara?

1314
02:07:44,567 --> 02:07:46,432
We're helpless

1315
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:52,471
Open the handcuff

1316
02:08:42,191 --> 02:08:46,821
l've found a truck driver.
We've got to leave in an hour

1317
02:08:47,163 --> 02:08:52,066
Where are we going?
- Wherever the truck takes us

1318
02:08:52,402 --> 02:08:55,599
You know, we have no place of our own.
- But...

1319
02:08:56,406 --> 02:09:00,399
we've ended up doing
something very horrible

1320
02:09:03,212 --> 02:09:05,874
What happened?
What is it, Mother?

1321
02:09:06,316 --> 02:09:09,410
What happened, Mother?
- l'm responsible for what you did

1322
02:09:10,219 --> 02:09:14,417
To save my life, the two of you
have risked your lives

1323
02:09:17,126 --> 02:09:20,095
Even my own children
wouldn't love me so much

1324
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:25,424
Why are you harping on that?
You're hurting our feelings

1325
02:09:27,236 --> 02:09:29,329
Have we loved her any less
than our own mother?

1326
02:09:29,672 --> 02:09:33,233
Listen to me, Mother.
What's one lifetime...

1327
02:09:33,576 --> 02:09:36,773
we could sacrifice
ten lifetimes for you

1328
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:44,117
What is the matter?
- We have some questions for you, sir

1329
02:09:44,454 --> 02:09:46,615
l'm sorry, l can't
talk to you

1330
02:09:47,457 --> 02:09:49,448
We're told you've been suspended

1331
02:09:51,127 --> 02:09:53,789
Two wanted thieves lived in your
house and you didn't even suspect...

1332
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:57,122
their mission was to rescue Panther?
You're such a big officer...

1333
02:09:57,467 --> 02:10:00,732
you hold such an important post...
how could you be deceived, sir?

1334
02:10:01,204 --> 02:10:05,800
Apart from being an officer,
l'm also an lndian

1335
02:10:06,476 --> 02:10:10,139
We lndians have a huge weakness

1336
02:10:11,481 --> 02:10:14,473
We're very emotional

1337
02:10:16,486 --> 02:10:21,287
When a poor man comes to our door,
we share our food with him...

1338
02:10:21,657 --> 02:10:24,490
without even finding out
whether he's hungry or not

1339
02:10:24,827 --> 02:10:26,818
When someone comes seeking shelter...

1340
02:10:27,163 --> 02:10:31,293
we give him shelter in our house,
without finding out...

1341
02:10:31,667 --> 02:10:34,830
what lies in his heart

1342
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:41,806
l was blind to have
wished to marry Tara

1343
02:10:42,512 --> 02:10:46,915
How was l to know that the man
l wanted as my life-companion...

1344
02:10:47,250 --> 02:10:51,118
would ruin my brother's
life some day

1345
02:11:01,531 --> 02:11:05,194
To save their mother's life, Tara
and Sitara had Panther released...

1346
02:11:05,535 --> 02:11:10,529
but it was poor Ram Singh
who had to bear the punishment

1347
02:11:10,873 --> 02:11:14,536
As someone truly said, he paid for
the sins the boys had committed

1348
02:11:21,551 --> 02:11:24,884
What are you doing...?
What?

1349
02:11:25,555 --> 02:11:27,921
You were the one who
always lent us courage

1350
02:11:28,257 --> 02:11:32,318
And we stand by you today.
We are with you

1351
02:11:34,564 --> 02:11:38,364
Dad, whenever l didn't
do well at my studies...

1352
02:11:38,701 --> 02:11:41,226
or was found lacking
in sports and games...

1353
02:11:41,571 --> 02:11:46,235
you were the one who always told me,
A soldier's son must never give up

1354
02:11:46,642 --> 02:11:50,305
lf the one who gave me hope
himself gives up...

1355
02:11:50,646 --> 02:11:54,138
what will happen of us?
- My son...

1356
02:11:54,584 --> 02:11:57,382
your father never gave up,
nor will he ever

1357
02:11:59,188 --> 02:12:01,850
No enemy has ever escaped
my eyes

1358
02:12:03,359 --> 02:12:05,759
What l regret is that those two
enemies lived in my own house...

1359
02:12:06,095 --> 02:12:07,926
and escaped my scrutiny

1360
02:12:08,364 --> 02:12:10,389
No, sir...

1361
02:12:11,367 --> 02:12:13,597
l'm the guilty one!

1362
02:12:14,670 --> 02:12:21,371
They made me tell them
everything about the family

1363
02:12:21,711 --> 02:12:26,705
l'd rather you shoot me, sir!
- Chhotu!

1364
02:12:28,317 --> 02:12:33,277
l'll kill those who have
betrayed all of us

1365
02:12:37,393 --> 02:12:38,621
Bastards!

1366
02:12:42,031 --> 02:12:44,022
Whom did the bullet hit?
- Not me

1367
02:12:51,641 --> 02:12:55,975
Tara, we came here to explain
our situation to him

1368
02:12:56,445 --> 02:12:58,640
But he's shooting at us
even before we can speak

1369
02:12:59,649 --> 02:13:07,715
l think this crisis that goes on
and on in our lives...

1370
02:13:08,457 --> 02:13:12,359
Mr Ram Singh, if you could hear
us out before you shoot at us?

1371
02:13:12,695 --> 02:13:14,060
l want to listen to nothing!

1372
02:13:14,397 --> 02:13:16,365
Nobody moves! Else, l'll shoot

1373
02:13:16,666 --> 02:13:20,329
Madam, you step here...
it's a request

1374
02:13:20,670 --> 02:13:22,661
You come here, brother

1375
02:13:25,675 --> 02:13:29,338
You're kidnapping me...?
- l swear it on God!

1376
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:32,341
Nobody moves!
Else, l'll shoot the old lady!

1377
02:13:32,682 --> 02:13:34,809
Dad! Save Grandma!
- Have patience

1378
02:13:35,151 --> 02:13:39,087
Fatso, not even your father
can save your grandma!

1379
02:13:39,388 --> 02:13:41,151
You know what that means?

1380
02:13:42,692 --> 02:13:44,683
Not a word against Dad!
- Patience

1381
02:13:44,994 --> 02:13:49,363
Sir, even if l die,
l'm going to fix these guys!

1382
02:13:49,699 --> 02:13:52,327
Cut that bloody crap!

1383
02:13:52,702 --> 02:13:55,034
You have a mother, two brothers
and three sisters

1384
02:13:55,371 --> 02:13:57,703
You're going to die without
getting them married?

1385
02:13:59,809 --> 02:14:04,269
Not my Mother...
- Your sisters will remain unmarried

1386
02:14:04,614 --> 02:14:08,050
l'll see how you don't
get your mother married!

1387
02:14:08,417 --> 02:14:12,148
No tricks, please.
- No smartness... no

1388
02:14:12,521 --> 02:14:16,514
l'm not playing any tricks.
l'll do just as you say

1389
02:14:16,859 --> 02:14:19,384
Only let my mother go

1390
02:14:19,729 --> 02:14:23,961
See? lt kills you, doesn't it?

1391
02:14:24,333 --> 02:14:27,734
That's how mothers are

1392
02:14:28,471 --> 02:14:31,406
Just as your love for your mother
makes you helpless...

1393
02:14:31,741 --> 02:14:34,869
the two of us were helpless too.
- True

1394
02:14:35,745 --> 02:14:42,173
Cobra had kidnapped our mother.
He asked us to have Panther freed

1395
02:14:42,518 --> 02:14:46,215
Had we not had Panther freed,
the scoundrel...

1396
02:14:46,555 --> 02:14:48,318
The bastard!
- The sonofagun...

1397
02:14:48,658 --> 02:14:50,455
the bloody owl...
- The ape!

1398
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:54,218
Come to the point.
- He'd have killed our mother

1399
02:14:54,563 --> 02:15:00,331
How could we give death to the
mother who gave us our lives?

1400
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:02,567
Don't cry, Tara...

1401
02:15:08,511 --> 02:15:10,775
Give me the gun.
- What's the problem?

1402
02:15:14,784 --> 02:15:20,780
Mr Ram Singh, we enacted this drama
to make you see the truth

1403
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:25,185
lf you still don't trust us,
take this gun...

1404
02:15:25,528 --> 02:15:28,463
and shoot us!
- What are you doing?

1405
02:15:28,798 --> 02:15:32,461
lf you must give the gun to someone,
give it to the mother...

1406
02:15:32,802 --> 02:15:37,466
she has a mother's heart!
And Ram Singh is only her son

1407
02:15:37,807 --> 02:15:41,004
Mr Ram Singh, please forgive us

1408
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:44,502
Circumstances have driven us
to commit these bad deeds

1409
02:15:44,914 --> 02:15:49,112
But we're not bad human beings.
- Mr Ram Singh...

1410
02:15:49,552 --> 02:15:53,488
we've never wanted to
ruin anyone's family

1411
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:56,120
Give us just one chance

1412
02:15:56,559 --> 02:16:00,051
We're the ones who set Panther free.
We'll be the ones to bring him back

1413
02:16:00,396 --> 02:16:03,490
That's not all.
Let me tell you, Mr Ram Singh

1414
02:16:03,833 --> 02:16:09,499
The respect and the happiness your
family has lost because of us...

1415
02:16:09,839 --> 02:16:14,503
we brothers will restore to you.
- That's not all

1416
02:16:14,844 --> 02:16:20,305
Just give us one more opportunity.
That's all there is to it

1417
02:16:22,752 --> 02:16:25,084
l see truth in what you say

1418
02:16:25,788 --> 02:16:28,018
Go on. l give you an opportunity

1419
02:16:37,933 --> 02:16:41,391
Pinki, l saw your interview
on television

1420
02:16:42,571 --> 02:16:45,404
You said that you're blind

1421
02:16:46,575 --> 02:16:51,603
Had you been blind, where would you
have found a handsome man like me?

1422
02:16:52,615 --> 02:16:57,177
l have a request...
please accept me

1423
02:16:59,889 --> 02:17:00,878
No?

1424
02:17:01,791 --> 02:17:05,887
She's willing, because she's shy.
- Don't tell me!

1425
02:17:07,963 --> 02:17:14,698
Please telephone Priti and tell her
that Sitara has turned a new leaf

1426
02:17:15,704 --> 02:17:19,902
And do tell yourself too, that
your Tara has also turned a new leaf

1427
02:17:20,910 --> 02:17:21,899
One moment

1428
02:17:23,579 --> 02:17:27,242
l called you a fatso.
- But he is a fatso

1429
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:36,586
Brother, we made tall claims and
spoke impressive lines in there

1430
02:17:36,926 --> 02:17:40,327
But where are we going
to look for Panther?

1431
02:17:40,663 --> 02:17:44,724
You played the lion
from Punjab in there

1432
02:17:45,267 --> 02:17:48,725
You spoke of restoring the family's
happiness and honour

1433
02:17:49,071 --> 02:17:54,065
Can't help it. lt's the Punjabi blood
which is forever on the boil

1434
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:57,338
But what are we going to do now?
- Brother...

1435
02:17:58,681 --> 02:18:00,945
that was the way mother showed us

1436
02:18:01,684 --> 02:18:03,948
A way out of this,
mother will show us too

1437
02:18:06,689 --> 02:18:08,350
Mother!

1438
02:18:15,965 --> 02:18:18,627
Tara, Sitara... the two scoundrels...
- What are you saying, Mother?

1439
02:18:18,968 --> 02:18:21,368
This is the place those two
scoundrels brought me to

1440
02:18:21,704 --> 02:18:25,401
Amazing! She has brought us
to the enemy's den!

1441
02:18:25,741 --> 02:18:28,767
That's how a mother is.
- Enough

1442
02:18:29,111 --> 02:18:31,409
This is no time for emotions,
it's action time

1443
02:18:31,747 --> 02:18:33,738
Go and keep your promise

1444
02:18:33,983 --> 02:18:38,511
Go and inform Ram Singh.
ln the meantime, we'll fix these guys

1445
02:18:38,854 --> 02:18:40,515
Watch it!

1446
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:43,550
Mother! You've learnt to drive?

1447
02:18:46,795 --> 02:18:50,663
Mother has learnt to drive, brother.
- That's how a mother is

1448
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,194
Right

1449
02:18:59,708 --> 02:19:04,304
l'm leaving your country, so l thought
l'd say bye to you one last time

1450
02:19:05,781 --> 02:19:08,341
You did throw your weight around
in that uniform

1451
02:19:08,817 --> 02:19:12,583
You will now bow your head
out of shame all your life

1452
02:19:14,023 --> 02:19:17,015
You asked me many questions
in custody

1453
02:19:17,493 --> 02:19:20,018
But Panther has the last word

1454
02:19:24,767 --> 02:19:27,031
Have you set the landmines?
- Yes

1455
02:19:27,836 --> 02:19:30,031
And the bombs?
- Yes sir

1456
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,704
Not a trace of evidence
we leave behind

1457
02:19:39,048 --> 02:19:42,609
We've loaded the stuff.
So let's move

1458
02:19:50,592 --> 02:19:53,254
Stop the van!
Chase!

1459
02:19:54,797 --> 02:19:56,458
l'm so happy today

1460
02:19:56,799 --> 02:20:00,735
Without any bloodshed,
or doing anything wrong...

1461
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:03,732
we've done something great
for the country

1462
02:20:04,073 --> 02:20:06,473
l'm so happy!
- Drive the van!

1463
02:20:06,809 --> 02:20:11,075
l feel like crying.
- Concentrate, will you?

1464
02:20:11,814 --> 02:20:13,611
Overtake the van!

1465
02:20:14,083 --> 02:20:15,414
Hold it!

1466
02:20:16,085 --> 02:20:20,078
Right or left? Where do we go?
- This is the first time...

1467
02:20:20,422 --> 02:20:23,755
we've done something right,
so take a right

1468
02:20:24,093 --> 02:20:26,857
That guy's gonna fall

1469
02:20:33,235 --> 02:20:36,534
l'm very excited today.
- Why?

1470
02:20:36,872 --> 02:20:41,741
Ram Singh will happily get us married.
After that...

1471
02:20:42,111 --> 02:20:49,108
we'll have kids from Pinki and Priti.
- Concentrate on the wheels!

1472
02:20:52,121 --> 02:20:55,784
What do l take now?
Right or left?

1473
02:21:10,873 --> 02:21:16,607
l'm even more excited.
- No excitement. Drive the van!

1474
02:21:16,945 --> 02:21:19,937
Listen...
- No, drive the van

1475
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:34,154
l say... have we returned
to the same place?

1476
02:21:37,166 --> 02:21:41,159
You kept saying right and
brought us to the wrong place

1477
02:21:43,172 --> 02:21:46,608
When the time is right,
you come to the right place

1478
02:21:46,942 --> 02:21:49,502
Your time isn't right.
Ours is

1479
02:21:50,179 --> 02:21:51,646
Get the clowns

1480
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:55,177
Strange story...

1481
02:21:56,452 --> 02:22:00,183
it begins and ends

1482
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:04,717
What destination...
- You can't sing! Not you!

1483
02:22:08,964 --> 02:22:10,955
Who told you to suggest
so many rights!

1484
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:15,432
You were the one who was driving.
- And who asked me to take right?

1485
02:22:16,972 --> 02:22:19,839
He couldn't understand,
nor could l...

1486
02:22:20,209 --> 02:22:23,201
What destination...?
- Not you! You can't sing!

1487
02:22:24,213 --> 02:22:27,876
Skip the nonsense.
- No nonsense, you don't know

1488
02:22:28,917 --> 02:22:34,014
This chap creates the trouble
and lands me in the soup

1489
02:22:34,389 --> 02:22:36,653
l create the trouble?
- Oh yes

1490
02:22:36,992 --> 02:22:41,224
Brother Panther, ask brother Cobra
who shot him in the leg

1491
02:22:41,930 --> 02:22:44,228
lt was him!
- One moment

1492
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:48,236
Where was the need to say that?
Landed me in trouble again

1493
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:51,830
Even if l shot at you,
who gave the gun to me?

1494
02:22:52,241 --> 02:22:54,675
lt was him!
- One moment!

1495
02:22:55,043 --> 02:22:58,774
Where was the need to say that?
All right, never mind

1496
02:22:59,114 --> 02:23:03,244
Ask him who gave him those kicks
and took him to the corner?

1497
02:23:03,919 --> 02:23:07,252
lt was him!
- One moment...

1498
02:23:08,056 --> 02:23:09,956
l forgot what l had to say...

1499
02:23:10,259 --> 02:23:14,559
where was the need to say that?
Oh yes, even if l pushed you around...

1500
02:23:14,997 --> 02:23:17,591
who was the one who
gave him the final kick

1501
02:23:18,133 --> 02:23:21,591
Who was it?
Who kicked you?

1502
02:23:24,873 --> 02:23:26,670
Who kicked you?

1503
02:23:26,975 --> 02:23:30,604
Both of us had kicked him.

1504
02:23:33,649 --> 02:23:36,083
Both of them had kicked me.
- l'm not sparing them!

1505
02:23:36,385 --> 02:23:38,012
Get them!

1506
02:23:52,034 --> 02:23:55,470
Where has the grenade disappeared?
- Why didn't it explode?

1507
02:23:56,305 --> 02:23:58,637
lt hasn't gone into a coma, has it?

1508
02:24:09,318 --> 02:24:11,115
There... gotcha!

1509
02:24:11,453 --> 02:24:14,650
Kick it. lt's been years
since we played soccer

1510
02:24:20,028 --> 02:24:22,895
l'm David Beckham!
- No, l'm David Beckham!

1511
02:24:23,232 --> 02:24:26,668
lt's me!
- Me!

1512
02:24:28,136 --> 02:24:31,128
What are they up to?
- They're playing with the bomb!

1513
02:24:32,207 --> 02:24:36,337
All right, l'm Ronaldo

1514
02:24:37,145 --> 02:24:38,009
Kick it

1515
02:24:38,347 --> 02:24:40,008
l'm Ronaldo!

1516
02:24:40,349 --> 02:24:43,341
How can you be Ronaldo and
David Beckham? That's not happening

1517
02:24:47,089 --> 02:24:50,490
They're coming for us...
- Let go!

1518
02:25:07,876 --> 02:25:09,707
Tara and Sitara...

1519
02:25:11,179 --> 02:25:13,943
scored a goal.
C'mon!

1520
02:25:19,087 --> 02:25:20,611
Find them!

1521
02:25:23,191 --> 02:25:25,386
Find them! Move it!

1522
02:25:33,135 --> 02:25:38,038
We're hiding in the tank, no doubt.
But can you drive it ?

1523
02:25:38,407 --> 02:25:41,740
l can't even ride a bicycle
and you talk about a tank?

1524
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:44,135
l'm only talking out of tension,
don't get worked up

1525
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:47,209
l once pushed a handcart,
but l can't even do that now

1526
02:25:53,155 --> 02:25:55,146
They're in the tank!

1527
02:26:07,536 --> 02:26:11,734
What's happening here?
- What's going on?

1528
02:26:13,508 --> 02:26:17,103
The headphone...
listen to the news

1529
02:26:19,281 --> 02:26:20,771
Kill them!

1530
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:24,786
What happened?
- They say they're going to kill us

1531
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:28,180
Brother! l'm so scared

1532
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:35,855
Numbers... ever played roulette?
- Yes

1533
02:26:36,264 --> 02:26:39,165
Try a lucky number.
- One moment

1534
02:26:41,470 --> 02:26:43,301
What's happening here?

1535
02:26:44,473 --> 02:26:46,771
Those guys are kidding us
out there!

1536
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:02,183
Know what?
Try one and one... it's eleven

1537
02:27:17,305 --> 02:27:19,170
Explosion, brother!

1538
02:27:20,242 --> 02:27:21,504
Shiva!

1539
02:27:28,683 --> 02:27:32,517
Remember what Mother used to say?
When nothing else works...

1540
02:27:32,854 --> 02:27:36,620
a prayer yields fruit.
So let's pray

1541
02:27:40,695 --> 02:27:43,220
God's gift!

1542
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:49,530
We played football with it, remember?
- Let's play catching the ball

1543
02:27:51,273 --> 02:27:56,540
lf you remember, when we gave it
a hard kick, it simply blew up

1544
02:27:57,879 --> 02:27:59,870
ls it the same one...? You take it!
- You take!

1545
02:28:00,782 --> 02:28:03,546
Toss it out... Go on!

1546
02:28:09,558 --> 02:28:13,221
Let's try some more noises?
- What noises?

1547
02:28:13,562 --> 02:28:16,554
Press these buttons,
something will give way

1548
02:28:33,682 --> 02:28:35,582
Something blew up out there!

1549
02:28:41,490 --> 02:28:43,981
Kasim, l'm not in the car...

1550
02:29:12,621 --> 02:29:15,886
You said you couldn't
even ride a bicycle

1551
02:29:16,224 --> 02:29:18,192
So how're you driving a tank?

1552
02:29:18,426 --> 02:29:23,193
A bicycle needs to be balanced...
this is balanced on its own

1553
02:29:23,632 --> 02:29:25,691
l don't get this. Can you explain?

1554
02:29:31,039 --> 02:29:34,099
Our bag of tricks...

1555
02:29:34,543 --> 02:29:37,637
the world will see

1556
02:29:38,380 --> 02:29:41,645
We're different...

1557
02:29:41,983 --> 02:29:44,781
there's no one
quite like us

1558
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:48,317
There hasn't been anyone like us...

1559
02:29:48,657 --> 02:29:52,320
nor will there ever be...

1560
02:29:54,462 --> 02:29:56,657
buddy-boy

1561
02:29:57,566 --> 02:30:00,228
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten and one...

1562
02:30:08,209 --> 02:30:11,474
one and one makes eleven...

1563
02:30:11,813 --> 02:30:14,338
buddy-boy

1564
02:30:23,692 --> 02:30:26,684
You don't even know...

1565
02:30:27,295 --> 02:30:29,263
your death is soon arriving

1566
02:30:29,598 --> 02:30:30,622
Stop!

1567
02:30:30,966 --> 02:30:33,958
The impossible
is about to happen...

1568
02:30:34,469 --> 02:30:37,336
so start counting
your days

1569
02:30:37,706 --> 02:30:40,607
One, two, three, four...
- Five, six, seven, eight...

1570
02:30:41,209 --> 02:30:43,700
ten and eleven...

1571
02:30:56,491 --> 02:31:00,291
Where have they gone? And who did
this all this? Mr Ram Singh?

1572
02:31:02,530 --> 02:31:04,395
There's Cobra!

1573
02:31:06,735 --> 02:31:08,202
Here you are.
- You use it

1574
02:31:08,536 --> 02:31:10,527
l have a bad aim. You shoot at him.
- l can't shoot at all

1575
02:31:10,872 --> 02:31:12,863
Let's try together.
- Suits me

1576
02:31:15,644 --> 02:31:18,078
We hit his leg again!

1577
02:31:19,180 --> 02:31:21,410
You shoot me in the leg again!
Brother...

1578
02:31:21,816 --> 02:31:24,751
Die, you swine! How long
am l going to carry you?

1579
02:31:27,555 --> 02:31:30,046
No one can tie Panther down

1580
02:31:33,428 --> 02:31:36,556
l'm not sparing you!
- Panther's running away

1581
02:32:12,734 --> 02:32:16,135
Like the other day,
won't you wager a bet today?

1582
02:32:16,805 --> 02:32:18,796
No more blows?

1583
02:32:20,008 --> 02:32:23,034
Today... you get only one blow

1584
02:32:23,344 --> 02:32:25,812
One? For Panther?

1585
02:32:50,839 --> 02:32:55,538
What is the story of Tara and Sitara?
Can you explain it?

1586
02:32:56,711 --> 02:33:01,512
You know l can't explain.
Still, l will try

1587
02:33:02,751 --> 02:33:07,518
Although Tara and Sitara
stay in darkness...

1588
02:33:07,856 --> 02:33:13,158
they give light to the whole world.
- My word!

1589
02:33:13,595 --> 02:33:17,190
For the first time, you've
explained it without any hiccups!

1590
02:33:17,866 --> 02:33:21,859
Also for the first time,
we have done something good

1591
02:33:22,370 --> 02:33:27,535
But there's something
piercing my heart

1592
02:33:27,876 --> 02:33:31,039
What?
- Ram Singh's family...

1593
02:33:31,412 --> 02:33:33,880
made no attempt to stop us!

1594
02:33:40,021 --> 02:33:42,683
You're leaving without telling me?
- As if you'd have stopped us

1595
02:33:43,024 --> 02:33:45,015
l could've dropped you
at the station in my jeep

1596
02:33:45,293 --> 02:33:48,558
We don't need any jeep.
- We can walk also

1597
02:33:48,897 --> 02:33:50,888
He's offering us a lift!

1598
02:33:51,232 --> 02:33:53,291
l've arranged a mare for you

1599
02:34:27,802 --> 02:34:30,600
For the first time ever
Tara and Sitara realised...

1600
02:34:30,939 --> 02:34:33,931
that good company could
reform the worst of them

1601
02:34:34,676 --> 02:34:39,010
When the power of one and one
helped humanity and the nation...

1602
02:34:39,347 --> 02:34:43,340
they had found their wives,
a family and a comfortable life

1603
02:34:44,452 --> 02:34:52,291
But old habits die hard.
They wouldn't guarantee otherwise
