1
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,739
" Libertine."

2
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,242
" Libertine."

3
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,482
" Tried all the 12 dices
and 18 tricks."

4
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,658
" To become the head of the troop."

5
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,486
" He is a libertine."

6
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,325
" Libertine."

7
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,498
" With regular song..."
"With fleet rhythm..."

8
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,667
" Fire with fire."
"With a lot of pain."

9
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,392
" He is a libertine."

10
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,498
" Tried all the 12 dices
and 18 tricks."

11
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,835
" To become the head of the troop."

12
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,670
" He is a libertine."

13
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,180
" With regular song..."
"With fleet rhythm..."

14
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,508
" Fire with fire."
"With a lot of pain."

15
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,446
" He is a libertine."

16
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:41,721
" Libertine."
"Libertine."

17
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:46,460
" He is a libertine."
"He is a libertine in this place."

18
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,966
" He is a libertine."
"He is a libertine in this place."

19
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,034
" Giving grief to his mother..."
"He is a libertine..."

20
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,538
" Giving grief to his mother..."
"He is a libertine..."

21
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,815
" He is a libertine."

22
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:20,927
" Libertine.
"Libertine.

23
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,902
This is the southern hill in Pala.

24
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,814
Long back, Vadakkenveettil
Kochouseph and his three sons...

25
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:43,216
And one daughter had left this
hill with him on the same day.

26
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,523
Dear Mariamma.

27
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,093
I am leaving this hill
with our children.

28
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:56,929
I am not happy to leave you alone.
But I have no option.

29
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:02,436
This Kochouseph's tears won't be
the food for our hungry children.

30
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:08,770
Our children and I will come regularly
on this day to see you.

31
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,609
After I die, these people will come.

32
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,112
Our children.

33
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,757
After Kochouseph died,
his three sons used

34
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:24,257
to come here without any obstruction.

35
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:43,142
Kochouseph is hardworking and sad. And
then you three sons unite and work hard.

36
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,414
Would your children who
are living in unity

37
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,479
fight each other to get the property

38
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,881
and money made from that?

39
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,813
That too in Vadakkenveettil house?

40
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,489
Kurian, what are you saying?

41
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,159
What I have seen is a dream.

42
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,659
But when I saw it repeatedly,
I got afraid.

43
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,826
Tomorrow, if that dream comes true,

44
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,986
then we would fail in
front of our father and

45
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,937
mother who are resting
in that catacomb.

46
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,267
My father. This is his problem.
Make us also scared.

47
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,444
That's why old people say,
pray to God before going to sleep.

48
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,744
I have told my brother
that there is nothing

49
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,843
serious to get worried
about this matter father.

50
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,018
Father, now, you decide what to do?

51
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:24,016
You know that our children who are
collector, police doctor and minister,

52
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,020
don't want our family property to live.
But time is not good.

53
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,126
Now, people are running busily here
and there not for loving each other.

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,301
It is to fight with others
and make others' fight.

55
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:42,501
Three of us and Katrina needs our family
house and this family catacomb only.

56
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,038
Before doing all that, we decided
to tell you about the one

57
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,743
who knows everything about
our father and us.

58
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,773
Did you ask Katrina's opinion
regarding this?

59
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:57,115
She who lives by praying and crying
itself is an example of wrong decision.

60
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,224
She doesn't have any objection.

61
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:08,298
Okay. We don't know
what Jesus' likes and dislikes.

62
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,969
Anyway, you have taken
this decision with good

63
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,403
heart Jesus will bless
you for this always.

64
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,500
I will also pray for this.

65
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,070
Vadakkenveettil house.

66
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,907
The family house situated in
ten acres of land in Thaliparambu.

67
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:32,584
The estate belongs to the family in
500 acres of land. Other farming land.

68
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,417
Related business.
Besides this V.V. Builders.

69
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:41,332
Hospital. School.
Hotel. Theatre.

70
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,503
Shopping mall.
V.V. Transport and Exporting.

71
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:50,936
Together around 1500 crore asset.

72
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,673
1500 crore which I said is
an estimated amount.

73
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,110
As per today's rate,
it would be more than that.

74
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,286
Anyway, we have to divide
that equally among everyone.

75
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,980
Except family house and the property
in which family house is situated.

76
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,448
Everything should be finalised
the day after tomorrow.

77
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,892
The children who are living
in distant places...

78
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,887
We have informed them.
They will come in time.

79
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,059
Documents are ready, right?
Yes.

80
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,961
Then let's finalise the date
which brother said.

81
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,569
Day after tomorrow means...

82
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,300
First of next month. Friday.

83
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,636
It is a good day.
Let it happen on that day.

84
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,908
Let property partition
of Vadakkenveettil

85
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:27,973
house happen that day
without any problem.

86
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,822
Brother, everyone has come, right?

87
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,157
This is main...

88
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,500
What unity.
This is an ideal joint family.

89
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,774
Let nuclear family of this age
see this joint family.

90
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,617
Correct. Before I finished saying,
he has come.

91
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,083
The minister of Vadakhenvedu.
He has kept the punctuality.

92
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,353
Sir, the inauguration of bridge
is at 11am.

93
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,856
Would the bridge collapse
if I don't inaugurate it at 11am.

94
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,688
Sir, we can't say that.
This belongs to our section.

95
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,032
What section? Let it get over.
This is property partition.

96
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,533
Come.

97
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,528
Everybody reached?
Father, what to say...

98
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,441
Our Thaliparmbu lrutty road, know?
I had made that.

99
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,479
Soon after the inauguration, when a
lorry passed by, it's tar was damaged.

100
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,375
People have planted
a plantain in the road.

101
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,550
Because of that, there is
problem in the assembly.

102
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,879
If I won't give explanation,
then the channel will say

103
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,215
that Public Works minister
V.V. Joseph is corrupted.

104
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,726
But they won't know that a minister in
Vadakkenvethil house needn't be corrupt.

105
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,896
Right?
Oh, yes.

106
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,231
Don't waste time by chatting.
You start reading the partition details.

107
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,571
Advocate. Wait.

108
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,400
What is the matter?

109
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,736
Well... He is not come.
Who?

110
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:06,671
Kochukunju.

111
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,344
Not come?

112
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,685
She told me that he would
come by yesterday night.

113
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,648
His mother.

114
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,590
Katrina.

115
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,099
Where is he?

116
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,735
Your son.

117
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,003
When I called him yesterday,

118
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,148
he told me that he is on
the way from Bangalore.

119
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,318
And he would reach here
before morning.

120
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,010
Then what happened?
Sun didn't rise for him yet?

121
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,190
He won't come.
I have told you 1000 times.

122
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,852
He is making us fool.
That's all.

123
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:57,893
This is not that.

124
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,498
He might be sleeping in someone's
house after drinking liquor.

125
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,862
That lousy...
Don't make me speak nonsense.

126
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,866
Stop it.

127
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,729
I want to know where he is now.
I want to know now.

128
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,032
Thankachan, call him.

129
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,341
Call Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.

130
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,042
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.

131
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,116
Yes.

132
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,615
I am Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.

133
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:57,189
What wind said is lie.
What sea said is lie.

134
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,290
What time said is lie.

135
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,061
But what my heart says is not lie.

136
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,227
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

137
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,329
I am here too.

138
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,201
Who is the hero of this auction?

139
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,865
Look. Him, Our Pappy.
Kappy?

140
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,274
Not Kappy.
Appakattil Pappy.

141
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,747
What is this, Pappy?

142
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,887
Why did they send you here?

143
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,888
Is the bosses of Appakattil
house bedridden after

144
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,686
drinking liquor from
their own distillery?

145
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,257
Earlier also, flashback was the same.

146
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:44,698
When my grandfather was doing this
business without any discrepancies,

147
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:49,238
the people in Appakattil house
had mixed poison in our liquor.

148
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,605
Around 40 people died
in that incident.

149
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,803
Thus Appakattil family
started this business.

150
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,813
How will he be the hero who
belongs to Appakattil family?

151
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,640
He is the villain.
Villain.

152
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:03,984
Your family had stopped this business
as per your grandfather's will.

153
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,283
Then why did you come here now?

154
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,255
That was stopped by my family.

155
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,828
This is the direct
satellite communication

156
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,194
between Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju

157
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,424
and my late grandfather Kochouseph.

158
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,932
Sir, if I tell you, you won't believe.

159
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,368
But Vadakkenveettil
Kochouseph appeared

160
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,271
today morning in 'Suprabhatam'
programme on 'Doordarshan'

161
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,708
and told me, " Son Kochukunju,
you don't leave that range."

162
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,102
" if you leave that range,
then your grandfather will become..."

163
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:29,843
" ...out of range."

164
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,712
Hey, don't say jokes here after
drinking and coming here.

165
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,011
Auction is going on here.

166
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,621
Hey, Pappy.

167
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,815
You have come here not to participate in
sweet pudding auction, right?

168
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,755
Came to participate in
liquor auction, right?

169
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,523
That's why Kochukunju drank
two pegs and came here.

170
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,394
Then only I will become interested
in participating in auction.

171
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:50,963
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

172
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,799
How much this Pappy call for auction?
Two.

173
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,305
How much?
Two crore.

174
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,839
That's nice.

175
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:04,641
Then Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju
calling 2.5.

176
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,614
That means two crore fifty lakh.

177
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,556
What happened?
You don't have a penny with you.

178
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,454
Then from where you will
pay this 2.5 crore.

179
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,059
Son, lousy P.

180
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,829
Kochukunju belongs to
Vadakkenveettil family.

181
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,799
If I sell the grass in our land,

182
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,202
then too I can make the
amount which you said.

183
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,933
You call more without
speaking nonsense.

184
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,546
Three.
What?

185
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,342
Three crore.
Is it?

186
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,109
Now nothing to look after.

187
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,251
Five crore.

188
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,920
I think officer didn't understand.

189
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,956
Five crore.
I mean five crore.

190
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,456
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

191
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,188
There is not punch for five.
Poor man.

192
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,866
Let Kochukunju call more.

193
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,092
Five crore five paisa.

194
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,033
I have heard this voice somewhere.

195
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,872
Pappy, what you are saying?

196
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,139
Why are you going like this?

197
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,372
Is there no fifty paisa coin more in
your family to win over Kochukunju.

198
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,050
If you are a man, then you call more?

199
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,219
Five crore one rupee.

200
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,285
Otherwise, I will say bad words.

201
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,280
I will say bad word to your
father's father Appakattil...

202
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,190
Kuttappan's father Kariyachan.

203
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,086
Hey.

204
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:25,721
Go.

205
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,727
Silence.

206
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,797
Auction is going to be finalised.
Okay.

207
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,799
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju,
five crore fifty paisa.

208
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,235
First, Second, Third.

209
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:40,969
Hey, Philipose.

210
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,174
Take.
50 paisa.

211
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,578
You put the remaining 5 crore.

212
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,905
Pappy, what is going on?
Brother, we lost that.

213
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,644
The fool of Vadakkenveettil,
Kochukunju.

214
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,511
Then why did you go from
Appakattil to there?

215
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,583
Brother, he has won the
auction for Rs.5 crore.

216
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,644
That means the fool in
Vadakkenveettil house is

217
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:28,919
playing game with Appakattil family
by accompanying that Philipose, right?

218
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,356
Where has he gone now?

219
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,362
In our route itself.
Then you go.

220
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,364
Your other brothers and
I will manage this.

221
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,002
Take the vehicle.
Hey, come.

222
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,746
Kochukunju.
Don't kill them.

223
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,850
So many people.
I too will go.

224
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,547
Good morning.

225
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,284
Hey, your family members had left
this route to Appakattil...

226
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,827
During the time of your grandfather.

227
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,431
Don't come there with
this vehicle of yours.

228
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,623
It will get punctured.

229
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,000
Did Appakattil family members
leave liquor business and...

230
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:17,471
Start the business of
gluing puncture?

231
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:21,612
There is one old rickshaw in my
house belonging to my grandfather.

232
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,543
The three wheels of that
are punctured.

233
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:28,310
If you have time, you can glue
the puncture of that too?

234
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,509
Hey, fool.

235
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,417
You will make us puncture
vehicle, right?

236
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,323
Brother, go.
Go play with people suited to you.

237
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,188
They are the number one
frauds in this place.

238
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,385
Don't do anything.
Leave them.

239
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,089
Hey.
Fool of Vadakkenveettil house.

240
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,064
If you are planning to shine with
the range which you captured,

241
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,328
then there won't be hand and
leg for you to enjoy that.

242
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,096
Understood?
Okay.

243
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,832
At last to wash you bump,

244
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,103
Philipose's right hand won't be there.
Okay.

245
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,473
To avoid that,

246
00:16:56,048 --> 00:17:00,007
you have to return the auction which
you won and leave this place.

247
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:00,742
Okay.

248
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,581
Leave it Achu.
Yes.

249
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,155
Let's go.

250
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,450
That's better.

251
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,184
Otherwise, you have to call
someone to wash your bump.

252
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,260
Go. Go.

253
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,564
Four of them are too fat.

254
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,861
Why don't they go for
some concrete work?

255
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,197
Came to win auction.

256
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,639
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

257
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,373
Is there some threat
in the last dialogue

258
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,211
which that fool in
Appakattil house said? Yes.

259
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,445
From the beginning onwards,
it was there.

260
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,946
Then...

261
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,482
Change the gear.
Changed.

262
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:11,555
Do you want to cut the hand and leg of
this libertine of Vadakkenveettil house

263
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:16,191
after becoming fat by sitting idle
and eating food from Appakattil kitchen?

264
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,159
If you have courage,
then cut it. Fool.

265
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,564
Hey.

266
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,626
It is your luck that basket is here.
Otherwise, I will show you.

267
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,878
Ummachan.

268
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,285
Before you come with your brothers
to fight with some...

269
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,024
You should see with whom
you are going to fight.

270
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,254
Otherwise, the bell in the
church will ring.

271
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,087
If something like that would happen,

272
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:11,735
then your wife and children
will kiss you.

273
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,266
Last kiss.

274
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,674
Don't come and fight with
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.

275
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,478
I will thrash you.

276
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:30,117
" He is a libertine."
"He is a libertine in this place."

277
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:34,759
" He is a libertine."
"He is a libertine in this place."

278
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
" Libertine."

279
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,228
" Libertine."

280
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,207
Turn right.

281
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,286
Vadakkenveettil.

282
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,730
Don't kill me.

283
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,526
I am having fever.
I am innocent.

284
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,828
Hey.
It's me.

285
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,005
It's me. Kochukunju.
Oh! You.

286
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,105
I thought they have come again
and hit me.

287
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,144
I think my brothers who have
come to take their

288
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,679
share from Vadakkenveettil have gone.
Gone?

289
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,976
Gone.

290
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,818
It's good.

291
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,148
Anyway, you also come with me.

292
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,286
What for?

293
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,187
Hey, Jesus was the great man who had

294
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,927
divided five breads among
five thousand people.

295
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,893
That was Jesus.

296
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,327
For that, he will come with you.
Why should I come?

297
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,396
Not that.

298
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,928
Whatever we get from there.

299
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,100
We will share among ourselves.

300
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:57,772
Jesus has shared the bread.
But your uncles will share slap.

301
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,738
Slap.

302
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,541
If I share that with you,

303
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:06,775
then Chandu's body won't
exist anymore, my son.

304
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,009
Let me live.

305
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,245
You go inside the house, my dear.

306
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,623
No one has defeated this Chandu yet.

307
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,952
If someone tries to defeat...

308
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,287
I will miss my last bus.

309
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,155
Let me go.
I am going.

310
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,261
Hey, Achu.

311
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,398
Big uncle's Benz.

312
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,463
Please forgive me Benz.

313
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,040
Poor mother.

314
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,903
Haven't closed the door.

315
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,971
Whether she poured water
in rice or not.

316
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,286
Good morning.

317
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:51,622
It has come true what I had
just now I thought about.

318
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,327
I was thinking that why the bosses in

319
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:56,824
Vadakkenveettil family
are sitting in darkness.

320
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,294
We were not sitting in darkness.
We made darkness for someone.

321
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,597
A libertine.

322
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:06,009
Who is that Nelson? Kochukunju,
don't tease us in the midnight.

323
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,312
What are you saying?

324
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:13,207
Tell me, for whose death anniversary
prayer you have come here now?

325
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,886
The member in this family who are at
responsible positions have come here.

326
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,079
But you who is roaming here and there
without work didn't come here.

327
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,885
I want the explanation for that.
Now itself.

328
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,509
Uncle, it's true that
I have told my mother

329
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,591
that I was on the way from Bangalore.

330
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,460
But Gundelpetu is on the
way from Bangalore.

331
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,501
I had to stop there.
Not for me.

332
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,702
For my younger uncle.

333
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,500
What nonsense are you saying?
For me?

334
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:38,566
What is this?

335
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:43,271
This uncle told me to buy 500 acres of
land and start potato farming there?

336
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,779
What farming?
Potato.

337
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,712
Don't eat.
Gas will form, Ask him.

338
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,146
Thankachan, is it true?
Yes.

339
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,446
Did you tell him?
Yes. I told him, But...

340
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,952
What but...

341
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,352
Stop it.
Your farming.

342
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,789
Our father had told us
when he was dying

343
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,623
that no one in this family
should do liquor business.

344
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,465
Don't play drama in front
of me after discarding

345
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:04,831
that you had gone for liquor auction.

346
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,128
My uncle.

347
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,033
Today morning, I have played a drama.

348
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,605
For our Philipose.

349
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,800
Otherwise, where will I get money to
participate in the liquor auction?

350
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,673
For drinking two pegs too,
I would take money from my mother.

351
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:16,438
Right, Nelson?

352
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,015
Then about partition.
My signature is needed for that.

353
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,379
I can put signature at anytime.
I am throughout free.

354
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,817
The minister, police, doctor,
soldier, etc...

355
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,856
Belonging to Vadakkenveettil would
come directly without calling.

356
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:32,325
Because they can utilise
the property as they like.

357
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,126
Fool.

358
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:39,267
Is your dead father here to do
partition as per your convenience.

359
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,233
Enough.

360
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,700
I will ask him.

361
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,770
Mother, no one understands
what I am saying.- No.

362
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:50,580
You tell me by remembering your father
whom everybody is always cursing.

363
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,044
Where were you?
That...

364
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,183
I hadn't reach.

365
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,854
I was unable to reach here,
that's true.

366
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,750
I am asking you what the
reason for that was.

367
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,852
I was unable to reach here.
That's all.

368
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,427
Mother, let's discuss and
come to a decision.

369
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:07,693
Go.

370
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,260
Go somewhere.

371
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:15,338
Earlier, when you ran away
from this house, that time...

372
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,338
I have cried a lot for you.

373
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,478
After you returned,
you have given grievance.

374
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,374
Now too.

375
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,372
Now, I can't tolerate it.
Go.

376
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,049
Go somewhere.

377
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,951
Mother, you have said this much.

378
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,624
Now, Kochukunju is saying something.

379
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,150
Good night.

380
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,456
One more thing.
Only for this night.

381
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,122
No one should misunderstand
that this is forever.

382
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,060
Let's meet again.

383
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,524
Good morning.

384
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:14,293
Mother.
Send one black tea.

385
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,130
Fool.

386
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,002
Fool, tell water with tea power.
Started.

387
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,365
Sugar is over four days back.

388
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,041
Who is there in front of the house?
Your father has come?

389
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,735
His black tea.
My mother.

390
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,746
That dead person was not my father?
Maybe true.

391
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,978
I am fair.

392
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,279
But my father was pure black.

393
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,123
Mother.

394
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,293
If black tea is not there,
then no problem. Take rice soup.

395
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,563
In the morning, she called me fool.
Today's day is gone.

396
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,301
Newspaper has come in the morning.

397
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,367
Good.
Let me keep it.

398
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,969
I can wrap something with this.

399
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,236
Let me see the market
of obituary column.

400
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,071
Only this much.

401
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,245
Live obituary column?

402
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,845
When he came?

403
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,581
Oh, my God.
Did someone kill him?

404
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,990
Oh! Not died.

405
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,353
Hey Vadakkenvedu, get up.

406
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,826
Haven't you gone?
Gone.

407
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,600
Then why did you come so early
in the morning?

408
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,137
Hey this is not Vadakkenvedu.

409
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,238
This is Odakkenveedu.

410
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,204
I meant my house.

411
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,808
Hey, fool.
Yes.

412
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,477
Take this.

413
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,838
I am having some other work.

414
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,547
Oh, my Parasshinikadavu God.

415
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,716
Who is this?

416
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,010
Small boss of Vadakkenveettil house?

417
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,178
Yesterday too, you have said
goodnight in your house, right?

418
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,681
Anyway, black tea is not wasted.

419
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,723
I have made for this fool.

420
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,453
Take this.
Thank you.

421
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,765
Every night, I drink a liquid with
this colour to make me hot.

422
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,630
In the morning when I get up,
I drink a liquid in this colour.

423
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,898
Mother, this is called colourful.

424
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,680
What wind said is lie.

425
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,372
What sea said is lie.

426
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,314
What time said is lie.

427
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:19,054
What we drink from bar is also not true.

428
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,554
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

429
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,727
A line like that was not there in that.

430
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,124
I was saying that what I drank
wasn't enough.

431
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,867
Come out and breathe.

432
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,626
Sir, what is this?

433
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,397
I don't have such bad habit.
But he...

434
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,139
Sorry.

435
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,536
I don't have any experience in that.

436
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:39,869
But I...

437
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,511
For this, experience is not needed.

438
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,577
You just breathe in this.

439
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,009
Why should I breathe in that?

440
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,912
For boiling milk in your
mother-in-laws fumeless stove.

441
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,883
Sir meant about Aluva stove.

442
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,920
Oh! Fumeless stove.

443
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,750
Are you teasing the policeman
who had come to check

444
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,926
whether you have drunk or not,
after drinking and

445
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,418
driving the vehicle in the midnight.

446
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,925
Oh! That is the matter.

447
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,861
You should have asked
that earlier itself.

448
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:06,230
Sir, we will get liquor by standing
in the queue in front

449
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,099
of beverages corporation for long time.
Yes.

450
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:14,301
But family members won't allow me to
drink that peacefully in the house.

451
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,328
If we think of drinking
by sitting somewhere,

452
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,144
that time you will come with torch.

453
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:25,382
If we go to the bar and
drink three pegs,

454
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,822
then you will come there
to test the breath.

455
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:31,894
Is he your son?

456
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:32,824
Hey. Hey.

457
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,098
Sir, government is getting
its major income in the form of

458
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:41,170
tax from the liquor which
we have drunk now.- Yes.

459
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,068
Is it?
No?

460
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,902
Take your vehicle to station
without wasting time.

461
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,509
What?
Take your vehicle.

462
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,508
Hey, haven't you heard what sir said.

463
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,309
It's okay.
You lift the vehicle.

464
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:58,745
Sir, you please help us.
We can't lift it alone.

465
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:03,087
Sir, this is 1964 model.
And not latest 916.

466
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,124
Fool.

467
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,728
What are you thinking about yourself?

468
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,591
What am I thinking about myself?

469
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,658
I will slap you.
Don't you know that?

470
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,502
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.

471
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,365
Sir, you are new here, right?

472
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,201
My dear sir.

473
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:24,177
The SP sir, whom you
salute four times...

474
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,577
Calicut SP Alex Thomas.

475
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,878
He is his younger brother.
Sorry.

476
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,215
He is his elder brother.

477
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:39,192
Unluckily, Public Works minister
Joseph Kurian is also my brother.

478
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,165
A lot of people including
collector and advocate.

479
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:51,369
Sir, before fighting each other,
let's say goodbye peacefully.

480
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,175
Sir, he is like this.

481
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,644
But the other people in his
family are in good position.

482
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:58,973
Very nice.

483
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,174
Are you roaming here and there
by saying your brothers.

484
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,013
Name who are in high positions.

485
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,714
I am leaving you today.

486
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,921
But you have to come to the
station in the morning itself.

487
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,821
Okay. I will come.

488
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,798
If you are planning to sit in the house
by saying the greatness of your family.

489
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,991
Then I won't care about
your brothers' position.

490
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,530
I will thrash you after coming
to your house.

491
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,865
Understood? Fool.

492
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,737
Yes, understood, R. Ganeshan Sir.

493
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,837
Go home.
Okay.

494
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,572
Achu.
Yes.

495
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,377
Let's...
Okay.

496
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:43,961
Hello.
Father.

497
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,754
Alex here.
What happened?

498
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,524
Problem is nothing else.
He himself.

499
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,868
Yesterday night, he had thrashed
the SI who was on duty.

500
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:56,071
Police team is about to come
there to take him.

501
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,798
To Vadakkenveettil house.

502
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,474
The result would come in the
department in the manner...

503
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,377
That the police has taken
SP Alex Thomas's brother in...

504
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,740
Custody for thrashing an SI.

505
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,315
Father, you tell me,
what should I do?

506
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,382
Let me come and do farming
after resigning this job.

507
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,680
You don't do anything.

508
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,221
I will show you what to do.

509
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:20,654
If I get this ladder, then I can climb
the wall of Puthur Remani's house.

510
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,127
Proper height.

511
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,937
Oh, my God, let him die in sleep.

512
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,236
It's better to die than get
thrashed by the police.

513
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,410
Hey... Hey...

514
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,479
Kochukunju. Hey...

515
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,747
What? Hey?
Get up.

516
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,817
Which fool is calling me?

517
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,581
Your late father.
Here.

518
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,949
On the roof.

519
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,787
Achu, why did you come
here in this midnight?

520
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,655
It's not night, it's day time.

521
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,262
Are you happy now?

522
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,796
I have told you several
times not to do it.

523
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,092
Then too, you have slapped.

524
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:58,660
Slapped?
Yes.

525
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,337
Who slapped you?
Not me.

526
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,505
Ganeshan SI.

527
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,266
They have left from there.
Full wing.

528
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,443
Take bath and get ready.

529
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,835
What you are saying?

530
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,981
We have parted with that
SI Ganeshan very decently.

531
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,312
You have converted that decent
man into eight bathrooms

532
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,513
and seven kitchens within two seconds.

533
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,553
You try to remember that.

534
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,520
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

535
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:33,136
There was a threat in the bad word
which SI Ganeshan called finally, right?

536
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,567
Yes. It was there.

537
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:41,305
Then let's change the gear, right?
No.

538
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,638
No.

539
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,744
You will come to Kochukunju's
house and thrash me, right?

540
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,543
SI fool.

541
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,895
This was actually happened there.

542
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,563
Should I explain more
by sitting in the roof?

543
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,127
Needed?

544
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,936
What is this?

545
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,801
If things go like this,
what will happen? Yes.

546
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,340
Enough. I have decided to stop drinking.

547
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,476
Is it true?

548
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,171
We won't drink even a peg.

549
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,243
Leave it.

550
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,918
What will I do for this incident?

551
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,849
That...
I will tell you what to do.

552
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:25,820
Leave this house now itself.

553
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,718
My mother.
Okay.

554
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,256
Achu, 27 years old.

555
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,363
Police had never come to this
house in search of a libertine.

556
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:39,092
If something like that would happen,
then I won't leave you.

557
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,705
What are you looking at?
Get out from here.

558
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:42,930
I am going.

559
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:47,334
Then too, Uncle, if Kochukunju
goes to the police station like this...

560
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,641
without going to the toilet, that
shame is also for this family, right?

561
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,507
Fool.

562
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,949
Police is better to wash your bump.

563
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,312
My mother.

564
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,249
Sir, let me tell you one thing.

565
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:04,121
If saying one thing is wrong in police
station, then let me tell you half.

566
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,397
Not half.
If you move your tongue...

567
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,530
Fool.

568
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,763
Today, you will see my real face.

569
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,458
Hey, beat him.

570
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,499
Stop. Stop.

571
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,106
Ganesh sir, everything has
its own manners.

572
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,508
Yesterday, I had thrashed you, sir.

573
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,148
So, you have to thrash me today.

574
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,476
That is the proper manner.

575
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,387
Before that, you should
realise one truth.

576
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,456
The truth that who you are
going to thrash.

577
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:39,824
I am the brother of Palakkad
SP Alex whom you salute.

578
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,689
Shut up, you fool.

579
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:47,735
These brothers of yours called and
asked me to thrash you soundly.

580
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,636
That is their order.

581
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,242
Did you think that you can live like a

582
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:57,039
fool by boosting your
family's reputation.

583
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:01,184
Order is from top level.
Thrash this fool.

584
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,769
Oh, my God.
Who is coming?

585
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:24,703
Who?

586
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,843
Supreme court Advocate Anand Sharma.
Is it?

587
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,342
Don't you read newspaper?
No. no.

588
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,138
Let me salute.

589
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,645
Good morning.

590
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,416
Mr. Ganesh.

591
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,318
I am Advocate Anand Sharma.

592
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,154
Please release him.

593
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,494
I am talking about those policemen.

594
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,660
The bail order of my client
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju is with me.

595
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:57,935
Good.

596
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,436
Don't you have any other work
in Supreme Court, Sir?

597
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,437
Yes.

598
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,206
Whenever I need it,
that time it is there.

599
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,351
As a part of that, I have come here.

600
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,981
My Sharma, what is the
need of all these?

601
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,248
Mistake is in Kochukunju's part.

602
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,949
Not only had I driven the
vehicle after drinking...

603
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:21,029
But also I had fight with
this SI Ganesh Sir.

604
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:26,226
Because of darkness, no one else
other than our Achu witnessed that.

605
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,437
Is there any stitch in your face?
Hey.

606
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,138
I am respecting you, Sir.

607
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,003
This client of yours has not
only broken the rule.

608
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:38,011
He had tried to kill a police officer
who was on duty.

609
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:43,543
If I write an FIR like that, then this
long envelope won't be enough.

610
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,745
For saving him from here.

611
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,018
Correct.

612
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,886
You have said that you were
doing your duty properly.

613
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:55,396
I am having a doubt that you
and your police officer

614
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,599
weren't sincerely doing your duty.
So don't worry.

615
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,308
Every time you cannot be in high.
Isn't it?

616
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,576
Sorry, Sir.
We are little late.

617
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,478
No. No.
You are in time.

618
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,619
Doctor, I want to test he and
other policemen to know

619
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,383
whether there is any alcohol
in their body.

620
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:22,658
I didn't understand.

621
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:26,420
Yesterday, you had caught my client
for driving vehicle after drinking.

622
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:30,225
I want to know how much alcohol
you had drunk yesterday.

623
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:34,234
After that, I will tell you
how to write the FIR.

624
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,700
Doctor, please check.

625
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,168
Sir.
Please don't check.

626
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,607
Yesterday, when we had gone
for checking, we got a full

627
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:46,272
bottle from some young men
who were coming from Mahi.

628
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,748
I had told him not to drink.

629
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,978
I too drank four pegs from that.

630
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,122
I don't know how much ASl had drunk.

631
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,848
You ask him.

632
00:39:56,093 --> 00:40:00,120
Did you understand
how to write the FIR now?

633
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,730
Well... I...

634
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,866
I don't have any other work.

635
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,300
That's why I have come with this big
envelope to take this small person.

636
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,370
May I go?

637
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:13,971
Shall I tell something?

638
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:18,478
If we drink something which is of
good quality, then smell won't come.

639
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:25,087
When you came and told me to breathe,
I got the smell of alcohol.

640
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,218
Son, do you have duty in
the same junction today?

641
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,660
Don't cry. Okay then.

642
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,828
Move. Move.

643
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,163
This Anand Sharma doesn't
have any other work.

644
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,560
Why did he come from Supreme
Court to save a person like him?

645
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,005
This is not like that.

646
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:45,434
That maybe some drama artist
who had come in his dress.

647
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,110
Don't speak nonsense.

648
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,346
The person who had come
is Anand Sharma itself.

649
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,344
That fool Ganesh had
informed me from station.

650
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,017
I had thought that today we will
get rid of his nuisance.

651
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,186
Instead of that, he has shined.

652
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,112
Bad luck.

653
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,086
As per grandfather's
will, the partition is

654
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:01,849
possible only if he
signs the documents.

655
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,257
If he won't agree, then we will lose
the 30 crore which we...

656
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,093
Had given advance for the
300 crore agreement with...

657
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,235
Mumbai party for private
harbour project.

658
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,700
Their last meeting is the next week.
Don't forget that.

659
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,532
Second payment is already due.

660
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,709
Do something before we have
to pay the third payment.

661
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,375
Our fathers are in between this.

662
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:26,443
Otherwise partition and his cremation
would take place on the same day.

663
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,986
Jokuttan has come.
Fish fry is ready.

664
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,211
You go open the door.

665
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,559
I am Kunju here and not Kuttan.
Kochukunju.

666
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,294
Move.

667
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,735
Oh, my mother Mary.
This is nice.

668
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,673
I am seeing for the first
time that the heirs

669
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:56,173
of Vadakkenveedu is
conducting a meeting.

670
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,161
I've come here because
Kochukunju thought to

671
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:02,641
give you company if I
get a chair & pegs.

672
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,238
We are not born to a
father who is enjoying

673
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:07,422
by sitting in a chair
and drinking two pegs.

674
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,423
That is true.

675
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,522
Advocate is a liar.
But what he said now is true.

676
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,099
I have earlier understood that these
children were not born for fathers.

677
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:25,204
Don't try to harvest after thrashing
Kochukunju and doing farming.

678
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,207
That's not possible.
Promise in the name of Mother Mary.

679
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:31,109
If I had come here after
drinking two pegs, then

680
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,606
I won't care whether
it is collector or SP.

681
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,285
I should have thrashed you.

682
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:40,947
Move aside. You thrash me.
I will kick your abdomen.

683
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,458
You became mad after
thinking about partition.

684
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,791
And now, you think only
about kicking others.

685
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:53,802
Brother, not only for me, who ever
is standing here has got abdomen.

686
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,872
If you come one more step forward,
then I will kick your abdomen.

687
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,633
Then you come here.
You go, fool.

688
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,306
Playing with Kochukunju

689
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,209
I am telling everybody once more.

690
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,818
Don't come and fight with
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.

691
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,919
I will thrash you.

692
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,054
Okay then.

693
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:35,943
It was you.

694
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,681
When I saw the sky, I felt so.
It would be you.

695
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:49,620
What is the matter?
Your face is dull.

696
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,620
Shall I call anyone in your ISRO
to get an explanation?

697
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,026
Go, drunkard.

698
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,463
Now, it is 11am, till now you
haven't drunk one peg.

699
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,432
Then what a drunkard you are...

700
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:01,628
Nice.

701
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,706
Nice lover.
You should always be like this.

702
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:09,378
What is the motive of this trip?
Something is there.

703
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,710
Now onwards, this Helen Varghese
is Dr. Helen Varghese. Understood?

704
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,209
In between, you became doctor.
Yes.

705
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,151
Anyway, it is good. Once in a while,
I can check my liver.

706
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:24,487
This doctor is not that doctor.
This doctor won't check your abdomen.

707
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,560
This doctor checks the sky.

708
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,555
Doctorate. PhD.

709
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,632
I am the person who got
doctorate for the first

710
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:32,497
time among the junior
scientists in ISRO.

711
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:35,672
I decided to roam in the credit of that.

712
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,234
That...
Don't worry.

713
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,067
I will spend money for everything.
You don't have anything in your hand.

714
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,079
Not that. There, your daddy and
mummy have landed.

715
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,180
For your introduction punch.

716
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,587
Dearest daughter is coming back to
Vadakkenveettil house after a long time.

717
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,658
Why should I lose that punch?
So, you go to your house first.

718
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,920
After that, we will roam.
You don't get tensed about that.

719
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:03,494
If I ride in this car like this,
where will we reach?

720
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,429
You tell me that.

721
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,596
If it is in this gear,
then under one lorry at least...

722
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,831
If it is lorry, then let it be.

723
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:40,969
" Oh, God..."
"Come and dance as lovers."

724
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:47,399
" I am in the libertine
nest of your mind."

725
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:54,807
" Oh, God..."
"Come and dance as lovers."

726
00:45:55,185 --> 00:46:01,556
" I am in the libertine
nest of your mind."

727
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:08,823
" Let's get wet in the rain."
"let's make waves in moonlight."

728
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:15,663
" Let's get wet in the rain."
"Let's make waves in moonlight."

729
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:23,006
" The Malayalam land
is hearing the songs."

730
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:10,219
" The flowers blossom in the garden."
"In the winter season..."

731
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:17,561
" White clouds won't rain."
"Marriage is to be held tomorrow."

732
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:24,935
" The eyes will flicker like a fish."
"The eyes will flicker like a fish."

733
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:35,115
" I will give you these
stars as my gift."

734
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:38,615
"I will give you these
stars as my gift."

735
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:46,419
" Malayalam has shouted..."

736
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:53,260
" Oh, God."
"Come and dance as lovers."

737
00:47:53,637 --> 00:48:00,600
" I am in the libertine
nest of your mind."

738
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:41,474
" I will bring the music in a flute."

739
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:48,587
" My baby, my small baby."
"I will make you my wings."

740
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:55,321
" In the lips." " In the finger tip."
"I will become a red butterfly."

741
00:48:55,632 --> 00:49:02,162
" In the lips." " In the finger tip."
"I will become a red butterfly."

742
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:09,539
" This lightened yard for you, my dear."
"This lightened yard for you, my dear."

743
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:16,683
" Malayalam has shouted."

744
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:24,183
" Oh, God."
"Come and dance as lovers."

745
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:31,357
" I am in the libertine
nest of your mind."

746
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:38,030
" Let's get wet in the rain."
"Let's make waves in moonlight."

747
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:44,870
" Let's get wet in the rain."
"Let's make waves in moonlight."

748
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:52,050
" The Malayalam land
is hearing the songs."

749
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:58,216
" The Malayalam land
is hearing the songs."

750
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,099
Reached.

751
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,664
We have come here when you
told us that you are coming here.

752
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,501
Where were you till now?
I have tried you several times.

753
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,171
How will you get her?
Her job is observing sky.

754
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,345
No range is available in
the sky, my son.

755
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,915
Yes. I was out of range.

756
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,349
I had roamed with my friends in
the happiness of getting doctorate.

757
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,523
Anyway, you have accompanied
that fool as your pilot, right?

758
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:30,784
He drove the car.
But I missed him at 'Maharani' bar.

759
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,119
Missed in the bar?

760
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,526
Yes. He wants to take blessing
from someone there.

761
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,859
Oh! Now, blessing is given
in the bar too?

762
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:41,526
Yes. His mother is a supplier in
'Maharani.' For taking blessing.

763
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,475
Don't fight with anyone because
of this. I know what to do.

764
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,209
Weasal's company for ant eater.
Yes.

765
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,541
Dear, you don't waste time by
giving explanation about him.

766
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,309
You freshen up and eat something.

767
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,481
Move.

768
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,893
Only Rs.10 rickshaw charge
from here to heaven.

769
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:15,566
Oh! My future wife is sleeping
after switching off the mobile.

770
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:20,739
Now, I understood that future
husband should climb the ladder.

771
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,904
Don't make noise.
It's me.

772
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,417
Look. Chicken pilaf.
Your libertine brought for you.

773
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,849
Go open the door.
Chicken pilav at this night?

774
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:40,593
If you ask me, I will make
even midnight as day.

775
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,321
Open the door.

776
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:47,262
Good morning, everybody.

777
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,433
Good morning.

778
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,532
Please be seated.
Thank you.

779
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,171
Take the documents.

780
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,715
You know, it's a share documents.

781
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,769
The original documents
which you've signed

782
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,617
by agreeing all the
demands of the company.

783
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:11,123
Menon sir. A small mistake.
That's why second payment...

784
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,727
It's okay.
But one thing.

785
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:17,027
The total investment for this project
is Rs.3,000 crore. Ten shareholders.

786
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,461
As per my interest, you have become
one of the ten shareholders.

787
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,401
Yes. A business with a dignified family
which is having a minister too.

788
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,404
I know, Mr. Menon.

789
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,634
Minister, you don't know
the present situation.

790
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,972
Remaining 9 shareholders are ready
to pay the full amount at any time

791
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,240
for this harbour project

792
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,055
if I hold them because of you,
then the loss for that would...

793
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,884
Be more than Rs.300 crore
which you are investing.

794
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,992
So, you should understand
the seriousness of that.

795
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,992
I have arranged this personal
meeting to inform you that.

796
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,734
Coming month 22nd is the dead line.
That's all.

797
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,531
Excuse me, mother.
I am ready.

798
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,460
Oh! God has listened to my prayer.

799
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,970
Mother, why do you want to go out?

800
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,870
Should I take my vehicle
or uncle's Benz?

801
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,047
Don't take anything.
Let's go walking.

802
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,041
That means you are going to church.

803
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,481
Yes. Do you know the
specialty of this day?

804
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,151
It is your father's 25th death
anniversary today.

805
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,558
You should also come with me
to the church for praying.

806
00:53:56,766 --> 00:54:01,066
Good. Is it for this you called
me in the morning?

807
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:06,570
Mother, go alone to pray for
giving my father's soul peace.

808
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,237
I am not coming.
Why are you not coming?

809
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:14,510
Every year, when I call you on this day,
you won't come with me.

810
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,583
I want to know why you
are not coming.

811
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:19,084
I am not interested.
That's all.

812
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,251
I have done that when I was a child.

813
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,825
A lot. That time I didn't
know the meaning of that.

814
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,589
When I came back after running away from
here, I understood the meaning of that.

815
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:36,099
I am not ready to pray for a person
who had died before I was born.

816
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,603
What you said?

817
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:41,307
Do you think that
besides your father who

818
00:54:41,308 --> 00:54:44,807
died before you born had
come to you mother?

819
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,211
If you are thinking so,

820
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,383
then your mother will
stop everything by

821
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,283
putting off the candle
which is lightened.

822
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,722
Mother, you don't stop anything.
I will stop this.

823
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:57,959
It's enough.

824
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,977
What you have done?

825
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:35,658
Now your mother's relationship
with this family is over.

826
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,832
Both of us won't live together
in this house.

827
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:43,936
You or me.
Decide who will go from here?

828
00:55:55,552 --> 00:56:02,287
I will go. I am a burden
in this house.

829
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:06,588
If so, then don't come
to this house again.

830
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:13,534
I will tolerate the grief
of that till my death.

831
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,572
Master.
Yes.

832
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,574
You have come.
Yes.

833
00:56:55,211 --> 00:57:00,205
If you open the door,
then I can see your face.

834
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:31,936
When you hadn't come, I thought
that you have forgotten me.

835
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:38,287
I can't forget you like that.
That is the fate of Kochukunju.

836
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,883
The ordeal which no son
in the world has faced.

837
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,024
What is this?

838
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,386
Love of my mother.

839
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:50,616
The gift for putting of
the candle which was

840
00:57:50,617 --> 00:57:52,800
kept in front of my
father who is alive.

841
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,971
One more chest is remaining, master.

842
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,470
If you feel what I have done is wrong...

843
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,635
I will get one slap from here also.

844
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,705
Did she slap you?
No.

845
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:09,547
This is not a problem for me
because Kochukunju didn't...

846
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,150
Get his mother's
love during childhood.

847
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:17,092
This is cuddling.
Cuddling for this libertine.

848
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:21,822
How much I have drunk, then too
it is not going from my heart.

849
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,595
Let's put an end for her
foolish role, right?

850
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:33,434
Please put an end to this
anonymous life, master.

851
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:42,512
I am burning like a kindle.
I can't go forward like this.

852
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,612
May I tell mother about this truth.

853
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,194
My mother had slapped
and pushed me out of the...

854
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,123
House by saying one among us
would live in that house.

855
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,292
Not only once, but several times.

856
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:05,702
My mind had told me to bring my
mother here in front of you.

857
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:12,212
No. No. My Katrina lived like a widow,
when her husband is alive.

858
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,200
When she comes to know
that she had cried

859
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:19,550
and lighted candle for
her alive husband.

860
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,723
Then she won't tolerate anything.

861
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,219
Once I have failed in front of
the reputation of that house.

862
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,665
If it would repeat, then
there was a meaning

863
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,133
for your mother's lightened candle.

864
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:33,566
You can say.

865
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,251
Till the grievance,
inside your heart ends.

866
00:59:35,252 --> 00:59:36,565
You can curse me.

867
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,672
I am deserved to listen that.

868
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,906
My Katrina shouldn't come here.
I have to go there.

869
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,141
I will come.

870
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:49,242
I will come on the day when this
father realises that my...

871
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:53,252
Son is eligible to compete
with that family.

872
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,358
Not as master.
As your father.

873
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,428
Enough, master.
This is enough for me.

874
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,595
I don't want any story or anything.

875
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:15,941
I have come here to listen this surety
which you have given me several times.

876
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:21,708
If liquor is there, then pour each peg.

877
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,119
I want to forget everything.

878
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,951
After that, I want to listen
to your masterpiece.

879
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,787
Which misled my mother?

880
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,387
No.

881
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,488
The master piece which brought
my mother in a good way.

882
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,818
" What wind said..."
"What sea said..."

883
01:00:56,085 --> 01:01:03,085
" What time said..."
"...is lie."

884
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:18,338
" What wind said..."
"What sea said..."

885
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:25,708
" What time said..."
"...is lie."

886
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:36,952
" My dear, it's not lie..."
"My heart is sad..."

887
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:13,824
" I wish to see you a lot..."
Father, coffee.

888
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,224
" We won't see, my dear."

889
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,229
Now, this is the sixth coffee
you are drinking today.

890
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:26,768
Hey, if my Katrina makes coffee, I will
drink twelve and not six at a time.

891
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,043
She got the taste of
my Mariamma in cooking.

892
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,010
Look, he is coming.

893
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:40,111
" What wind said..."
"What sea said..."

894
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,452
Nice. Very nice.

895
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:49,127
I have come to Vyanad in search of
nice variety of ginger for cultivation.

896
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,313
With that, I have got
you to play the drama

897
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:55,293
in the church which I have sponsored.

898
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:56,969
I am happy.

899
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:00,734
When everybody told me
that your drama was nice,

900
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,138
this Kochouseph's heart
was satisfied.

901
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,581
I have come here to
say goodbye to you.

902
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:11,316
I am thankful to you for
giving the love and affection.

903
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,820
Where are you going?

904
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,751
I don't know that.

905
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,654
I am having a lot of
characters in my mind.

906
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,493
For writing all that,
I need one house.

907
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,825
Where will I find that,
till there I will go...

908
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:30,835
If that house is enough,
then you can stay there.

909
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,937
I am not sure that
you would like that or not.

910
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,712
If you like, you can conduct
drama anywhere.

911
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:41,281
And you can sleep there.
What you are saying?

912
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:44,344
Shankaran.
Yes.

913
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,681
Open that door.
Okay.

914
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,874
I was just seeing this.

915
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:35,904
Kurian.

916
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,733
What you are doing?
Move aside.

917
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:39,908
Move aside.
What is this?

918
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,907
Let me kill him. Move.
I said move.

919
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,010
No.

920
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,010
Stop it.

921
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,918
Father, he has molested our Katrina.

922
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,418
I have given you place
to sleep to cheat me...

923
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,254
No. No.

924
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:03,157
I am not a cruel person to cut the
plant which has given me shade.

925
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:08,833
When I got the love and food which
I haven't got ever, I felt like living.

926
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,775
This is not because of wishing
something else.

927
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,941
She and my child who
is in her body...

928
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,614
We will go anywhere and live.

929
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:31,684
Please allow me.
This is my request.

930
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:34,788
Father.

931
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,800
Oh, my Jesus.

932
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,491
I have come because
Katrina told me to.

933
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,495
Otherwise, I should avoid this drama.

934
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,064
She told me that an
opportunity like this

935
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:12,430
has come on the marriage
day as prosperity.

936
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:17,771
I don't have much belief in all this.
Men must believe men.

937
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,940
If I haven't believed Neelakandan,
then there is no use for this journey.

938
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:24,676
Neelakandan in return trusts me.

939
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,782
When I saw your drama, I understood
that you used to say sob stories.

940
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:33,513
Neelakandan, the meaning of drama
is the grievance inside the village.

941
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,286
Our time is not ours.

942
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:40,856
That belongs to the people who want us.
Now, it is Neelakandan's.

943
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:46,126
Master, can you sing that
song for Neelakandan?

944
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,699
One time.
I will sing 100 times for you.

945
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:58,379
" When times goes..."
"...heat will burn."

946
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:04,213
" Waves won't accompany for this."

947
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:11,487
" Dear, your face won't
disappear from the sky."

948
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,616
You have told me that committee
members will wait here for me.

949
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,316
But no one is here, Neelakandan.

950
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,854
Neelakandan won't know how to lie.
I will say only the truth.

951
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,827
Even if it is not good.

952
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,262
Master, I haven't brought
you here for drama.

953
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:49,590
To deport you.

954
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,927
They have ordered to kill you.
Killing?

955
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:54,860
Yes.

956
01:07:55,404 --> 01:08:00,341
It is true that Kochouseph boss has
accepted the artist for his daughter.

957
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:04,104
But those brothers don't like
you to be their sister's husband.

958
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,441
And they also don't need you as their
brother-in-law. That is their order.

959
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,678
Master, you can decide what is next.

960
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,388
Fools.
This is cheating.

961
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,120
I won't leave anyone.

962
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,887
I won't leave if you play
drama to kill me.

963
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,150
This was only left.

964
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,917
I have waited here till you
wake up not because...

965
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:28,756
Neelakandan knife is not
strong to pierce your chest.

966
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:34,526
I thought, I won't do that to an artist
who would become popular tomorrow.

967
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,770
Read this.

968
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,640
This is the situation in the village.

969
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,882
They had informed Katrina that
they hadn't got your dead body.

970
01:09:54,657 --> 01:10:00,562
Now, in the church there, prayer might
be going on for the soul of dead Daveed.

971
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:09,665
They have buried Daveed
when I am alive.

972
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:14,499
If you go to Vadakkenveedu,
then not one...

973
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:19,240
Three people including the child
in Katrina's body would be killed.

974
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,346
In one tomb.

975
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,145
Master, can you please live?

976
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,584
Anywhere after changing your name.

977
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,084
Jesus.

978
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,874
Who is this? Kochukunju.
Yes.

979
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,880
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.

980
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:59,877
Neelan, this is not that old time.
Everybody is fighting with me.

981
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,818
I could come here now only
after solving all problems.

982
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,492
I haven't deliberately stopped coming.

983
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,390
See. New books of author.

984
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,163
Author.

985
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:16,734
Neelan.

986
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:21,672
An illiterate goon.
Now, became a writer.

987
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:25,442
First time in the world. Neelakandan.

988
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:29,343
I am regularly getting the
remuneration for this.

989
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:38,053
But after that, I haven't seen
the actual writer till now.

990
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:43,195
When I asked him to live
by changing name,

991
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:48,763
that great man has changed
his name from Daveed to Neelan.

992
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,538
I wish to see him by going there.

993
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,635
But...

994
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:09,991
When Appakattil family mixed poison
in distillery to defeat Kochouseph boss,

995
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:15,891
I had gone to exact revenge all alone.
I got this as remuneration for that.

996
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,326
This one leg.

997
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:23,898
I deserved to face all this.
That's why God is not calling me back.

998
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,906
I am hearing this from
the day I met you.

999
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:33,339
Anyway, Kochukunju won't leave
you like that.

1000
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,413
To any God.

1001
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:42,718
Now, I am having a father because of the
mercy of a goon called Neelakandan.

1002
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,590
Kochukunju needs your remaining
life to do retribution for that.

1003
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:55,927
Master has sent three-four
bottles of liquor which he had made.

1004
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,105
May I take one peg?
Not one.

1005
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:01,875
I want to drink six pegs of liquor
which master had made at a time.

1006
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:04,375
After that, this Neelakandan
wants to stand properly.

1007
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,380
Then not to stand properly...
It is to sit properly.

1008
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,445
God, you are great.

1009
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:18,452
Shekaran, don't say like that.

1010
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:22,627
Not God. This advocate is
great for us now.

1011
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:26,456
He had made the witness into accused.

1012
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:30,069
That's why my brother is
sleeping peacefully in my house.

1013
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:35,634
Otherwise, he would have been
sleeping in the jail now.

1014
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,740
I know that.

1015
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:41,446
That's why, I have
called Nelson sir here

1016
01:13:41,447 --> 01:13:44,946
by charting a flight
to appreciate him...

1017
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:49,723
Nelson sir, he is very stubborn
from his childhood.

1018
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,152
Libertine.

1019
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,416
Epilepsy.

1020
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:53,652
Oh, my God.

1021
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:57,498
At the age of 14, a girl is like flower.

1022
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:58,499
Oh!

1023
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:03,270
Not only had he captured what he liked
but he had also devoured her.

1024
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,496
Is this a trivial issue?

1025
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,408
Because of your luck,
that taxi driver came there.

1026
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:12,508
I have fought the case with the point
that he had taken her to the hospital.

1027
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:14,843
That is Advocate Nelson.

1028
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:18,681
Poor man. 14 year's life sentence
and Rs.3 lakh penalty.

1029
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,684
I have bought him that much.
That's enough.

1030
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,857
That much is enough for
an innocent person.

1031
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:27,017
A person like your brother is
there in our family also.

1032
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:32,626
I have started my career by
making him accused for...

1033
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:35,201
Robbing aunt's wedding chain which
I have robbed, in his head...

1034
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,801
You are an actual criminal advocate.

1035
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:43,711
Hey.

1036
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:45,707
Hey.

1037
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:50,882
Don't come near me.
I want him.

1038
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,282
If someone comes to block me,
then I will kill him.

1039
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:58,122
How many times I have
told you by falling

1040
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:01,387
in your leg that my
father is innocent.

1041
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,747
That time you had told
me that if he hadn't

1042
01:15:03,748 --> 01:15:05,897
committed the crime, the
court will release him.

1043
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,494
I won't leave you, fool.

1044
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:15,704
You won't be alive to punish
innocent people like my father.

1045
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,577
I won't leave you.

1046
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:38,758
Not me.

1047
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,429
He.

1048
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:41,864
He has come to kill me.

1049
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:44,864
Take him to the hospital.

1050
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,943
Oh, my God. Take him to the
hospital immediately.

1051
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,048
If I am alive, I will come back.

1052
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:05,385
Nuisance. Came to disturb me.
Shekaran, come.

1053
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,055
You can't go like this.

1054
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:10,959
If that person dies on the way
then we have to answer for his murder.

1055
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,464
So, you go after our owner comes.

1056
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,200
What is this?

1057
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,305
We will speak about everything
afterwards. Sir, please come.

1058
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,040
Come, Sir.

1059
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,648
You fool.

1060
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,814
What do you know about me?

1061
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,815
You know, I am a leading
criminal advocate.

1062
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,147
Sir, you have to co-operate with us.

1063
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:37,325
This hotel is having its own procedures.

1064
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,653
Our owner is very
strict about all these.

1065
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:43,054
Your owner. Call him here
without giving lecture.

1066
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:30,044
You?

1067
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:34,040
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju.
Libertine.

1068
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:37,216
Now, you are standing in my hotel.

1069
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:45,383
Why have you come to another state after
admitting your wife in delivery room?

1070
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:51,991
Or did you start doing Kochukunju's
job like drinking and fighting?

1071
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:58,902
Brothers have good qualities
only inside the house.

1072
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,908
I have come here for my work.

1073
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:04,510
In between that whoever comes
to obstruct, I won't mind it.

1074
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:10,651
Hello.

1075
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,619
Sir, I am Dr. Prasad speaking.

1076
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:17,251
Sir, he is no more.

1077
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:30,102
Hello.
It's me. Your mother.

1078
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:32,671
What is the matter, Mother?

1079
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,432
Where is Nelson?

1080
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,043
When I call his number,
something in Tamil is heard.

1081
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,775
Alice has delivered.
Baby girl.

1082
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,447
Son, you please inform this
to him somehow.

1083
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:45,779
I will inform him.

1084
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,390
Hey.
Fool.

1085
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,660
If you point your hand
at Kochukunju while

1086
01:18:55,661 --> 01:18:59,160
celebrating your
brother's case success...

1087
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:01,731
I will burn you alive.

1088
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:08,736
First call has come from the hospital.
The person you have stabbed has died.

1089
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,476
Second call was also from hospital.

1090
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:11,470
My mother.

1091
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,139
To inform you that a baby girl
is born for you.

1092
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,885
Nelson, the sin of killing will
be over by eating that.

1093
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,313
But you have created one
child and got rid of that.

1094
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,818
A baby girl is born.

1095
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:28,094
You won't bring her up for making
people like them to celebrate.

1096
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,321
Take it as a brother's advice.

1097
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,090
Kochukunju.
Yes. Kochukunju.

1098
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,434
Now, you tell me.
What do I have to do?

1099
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,038
Earlier I had undertaken the charge
of robbery which you have done?

1100
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:38,702
Should I undertake this
murder charge like that?

1101
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:39,435
Tell me.

1102
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,669
Kochukunju, I want to see my daughter.

1103
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:45,041
If the outside world comes to know
that I have killed a person...

1104
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:48,914
Then I am nothing.
I am begging you.

1105
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,118
Not as an advocate.
As a brother.

1106
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:56,182
I want to see my daughter. Please.

1107
01:19:56,725 --> 01:20:01,924
Nelson, you go.
Go see your wife and child.

1108
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:04,356
Kochukunju will manage this.

1109
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,695
If my fate is to go to jail for you,
then I will tolerate that too.

1110
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:10,201
You go.

1111
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,872
No. Nothing like that would happen.

1112
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,199
I will undertake this of fence.

1113
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:14,136
Nandan.

1114
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,992
Your job is not to
undertake the of fence

1115
01:20:15,993 --> 01:20:17,641
which a fool has
committed in my hotel.

1116
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,871
I know that.
But this... your brother, Sir.

1117
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:21,079
I will undertake this of fence.

1118
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:24,380
I am sure that I won't be in
the jail for long time for this.

1119
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:27,547
See.

1120
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,859
A friend is a relative
whom a person gets

1121
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,327
not with blood relation
but with karma.

1122
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,726
He is my brother formed like that.

1123
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:39,827
To appear for him, a lot of
reputed advocate will come.

1124
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,734
Not for money.
But for Kochu.

1125
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:46,997
Advocate of Vadakkenveettil.

1126
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,543
I have heard a lot of stories
about the people who ran...

1127
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:52,174
Away from the house
and come back as useless.

1128
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,310
In movies.

1129
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:57,080
All of you have repeatedly
told that story.

1130
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:58,252
In our house.

1131
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:00,353
But this story is different.

1132
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:05,757
Kochukunju had come back to
the house after making money.

1133
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,792
The entire assets in
Vadakkenveettil house

1134
01:21:08,793 --> 01:21:11,090
won't be enough for
competing with my assets.

1135
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:13,931
That in not one.
Not nine

1136
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:16,160
it must be around ten times
more than that.

1137
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:20,931
Go wear one golden waist chain
for your new born baby girl.

1138
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:24,942
This is not like the six gram wedding
chain which you had stolen.

1139
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:29,113
Our uncle will gift her 30 gram
golden waist chain.

1140
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:02,847
Oh! Has father reached?

1141
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,514
Why did you come here after
destroying the happiness of...

1142
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:09,118
A family when a baby girl
is born in this family?

1143
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:23,994
Daughter.
Don't touch my child.

1144
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:25,899
Alice.
No.

1145
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:29,502
Don't touch my child with the hand
with the blood stain of someone.

1146
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,735
Alice. I...

1147
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,248
Kochukunju has informed here.
In pure Malayalam.

1148
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,246
The sacrifice which you have
done for your brother...

1149
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,420
You would come late because
of the reason that you are...

1150
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:43,580
Compromising his case related
to stabbing someone.

1151
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,258
When I heard that I felt I have
delivered my daughter after...

1152
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,260
Carrying her in my body for nine
months has become waste.

1153
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:57,097
Son, why did you take the case of
the person whom no one doesn't need?

1154
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,831
For making this mother
listen all these too.

1155
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:02,505
Mother.

1156
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,771
Oh! Even his own mother said
he is a waste.

1157
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:09,448
When did you start loving
your brother like this?

1158
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,982
Stop this cross-examination.

1159
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:13,777
No one should come and teach me
whom I should love.

1160
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,115
I know what to do.

1161
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,192
Within a minute, you
felt that it was a waste

1162
01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:21,558
that you've carried my
daughter in your body.

1163
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:25,794
Hey. If I look after my daughter
by hardship throughout my life,

1164
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,294
then too, a wife like you will say about
carrying her nine months in your womb.

1165
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:30,400
It would be like that only.

1166
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,416
Mother.

1167
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:57,923
Mother, you won't cry for Kunjukunju
by listening to these people.

1168
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,832
Till yesterday I should have pierced
him into pieces, if I saw him.

1169
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:06,501
But today, my Kochukunju
is not that for me.

1170
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:12,177
He is younger to me in age.
But as per life, he is elder to me.

1171
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,583
What are you saying?

1172
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:19,185
Truth.
Promise in the name of mother.

1173
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:24,685
I have stabbed a person after drinking.
That person had died.

1174
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:30,521
Kochukunju has taken over that case
when he felt that I will go to jail.

1175
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,358
Earlier too, it was like that.

1176
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:40,204
My Jesus.
What am I hearing?

1177
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:45,374
Mother, you don't ask anything
more about your son.

1178
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:50,484
But. One thing is sure.
Mother, he is not Kochukunju.

1179
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:54,544
He is the great fellow in
Vadakkenveettil house.

1180
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:03,156
Till now the candles you have
lightened for him hasn't gone waste.

1181
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,629
That's sure.

1182
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:40,699
Wrong number.

1183
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,769
Yes, I am wrong.
But you come and open the door.

1184
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,375
Which door?
Heaven's door or hell's door?

1185
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:52,677
Oh, it's like that.

1186
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:53,881
Then look.

1187
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:55,773
This hell's door.

1188
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:03,620
Open the door without standing in
the balcony to get midnight wind.

1189
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,454
Don't wake up my mother.
Okay.

1190
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,293
Fed up with him.

1191
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,397
Thanks for Jesus.

1192
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:15,099
A girl is here in this
house who loves this

1193
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:18,599
libertine, so a person is
here to open the door.

1194
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:27,444
Mother has ordered not
to climb this step.

1195
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,712
Then let me go inside
without climbing the steps.

1196
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:38,959
Hey.

1197
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,457
Don't show circus by standing there.

1198
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,977
Are you thinking that
you are climbing on

1199
01:26:41,978 --> 01:26:43,192
the top of the elephant
after drinking?

1200
01:26:43,297 --> 01:26:45,463
You can say like that.

1201
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:49,296
I have promised my mother
that I won't climb this step.

1202
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:55,474
So, I am trying to come inside
without climbing the steps.

1203
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:00,979
I haven't climbed.

1204
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:03,810
Promising in the name of mother
this Kochukunju hasn't climbed the step.

1205
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:06,803
Mother has told me
that you will tolerate

1206
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:08,486
the sorrow of living without your son.

1207
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,884
That is mother's matter.

1208
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:13,923
But this son's sorrow,
that I should tolerate.

1209
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:16,494
That's why I came to see you.

1210
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:19,596
If you don't mind,
let Kochukunju come inside.

1211
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:25,596
Come inside without make up
others wake up.

1212
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,335
Thank you.

1213
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:30,901
I know that you have
poured water in the rice.

1214
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:34,343
So, some chilly is there with me.

1215
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:36,847
You please make chutney with this.
I will drink rice soup with this.

1216
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:38,780
I am feeling hungry.
That's why.

1217
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:44,116
Whatever you want, you go and make.

1218
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:48,021
Okay. Let it be.
Kitchen is there itself, right?

1219
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:53,861
" What wind said is..."

1220
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:04,439
What happened?
Mother said today is fasting festival.

1221
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:09,377
But by seeing all these,
it seems to be a big festival.

1222
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:13,544
Did uncle convert his
caste because of me?

1223
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:16,216
Let it be anything.

1224
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:18,888
What is for Jesus,
it is for him only.

1225
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,452
What is for Caesar that is
for Kochukunju.

1226
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:28,391
I have made this for my son.
I will serve you.

1227
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,966
Even though I have beaten
and thrown you from this house,

1228
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:34,935
then too, my son has come
back by realising my sorrows.

1229
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:38,403
Mother, today you are
in a sentimental mood.

1230
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:40,737
If so, you sit here.

1231
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:43,350
Kochukunju eats only after
my mother eats an handful of...

1232
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:45,051
Rice from Kochukunju's hand.

1233
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:13,805
" Without the knowledge of sky."
"Sun wakes up."

1234
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:18,543
" Mother, to see you..."

1235
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:23,483
" Sea is floating without
the knowledge of waves."

1236
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:28,492
" Mother, for cuddling you..."

1237
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:35,763
" I want to sleep in your arms
without talking anything.

1238
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:42,999
" Like a calf, my naughtiness..."

1239
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:49,912
" Without the knowledge of sky..."
"...sun wakes up."

1240
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:54,521
" Mother, to see you..."

1241
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:59,418
" Sea is floating without
the knowledge of waves."

1242
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:04,428
" Mother, for cuddling you..."

1243
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:49,737
" Mother, the temple of mercy..."
"You are the treasure of love."

1244
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:59,413
" Murmuring of rain..."
"Without closing your eyes..."

1245
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:08,989
" You will give me this fragrance..."
"This friendship."

1246
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:18,496
" Without the knowledge of sky..."
"...sun wakes up."

1247
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:23,336
" Mother, to see you..."

1248
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:28,174
" Sea is floating without
the knowledge of waves."

1249
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:33,410
" Mother, for cuddling you..."

1250
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:08,949
" The holy water which mother floats..."
"Are you blossomed star?"

1251
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:16,222
" Or are you burning candle?"

1252
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:23,430
" Telling slowly as provocation."
"In this journey."

1253
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:30,570
" Just to give rhythm."

1254
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:37,742
" Without the knowledge of sky..."
"...sun wakes up."

1255
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:42,480
" Mother, to see you..."

1256
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:47,420
" Sea is floating without
the knowledge of waves..."

1257
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:52,531
" Mother, for cuddling you..."

1258
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:59,733
" I want to sleep in your arms
without talking anything."

1259
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:07,380
" Like a calf, my naughtiness..."

1260
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,756
He is getting ready.

1261
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:26,923
Don't forget to give me what you'd
offered, if Kochukunju stops drinking.

1262
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:28,362
I am ready.
I am also ready.

1263
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:30,198
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

1264
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:31,428
When will we get the first peg?

1265
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,937
First peg? Oh, that...
Yes.

1266
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:36,939
They have requested that
at 10am in the morning...

1267
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:40,272
Kochukunju should inaugurate the
bar by drinking the first peg.

1268
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:44,039
Now too, they have called.
Then don't waste time. Let's go.- Wait.

1269
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:45,218
Hey, Achu.
Yes.

1270
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:48,546
I was supposed to ask you something.
What?

1271
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:53,784
The movie stars used to take some
money for inauguration, right?- Yes.

1272
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:59,123
Anyway, they want me to inaugurate
their bar, right?- Yes.

1273
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:03,292
Then, let's think in that way.
A gift in the form of money or bottle.

1274
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,635
I have arranged all these.

1275
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:11,801
Kochukunju has made market value by
drinking from bars through this place,

1276
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:15,039
even if Kochukunju doesn't need that,
then too this Achu won't leave.

1277
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,308
Not only one or two rupees,
I have asked them Rs.500.

1278
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:21,145
How much?
I have demanded Rs.50,000.

1279
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:23,983
They are ready to give more.
What?

1280
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,659
I was saying that they are
ready to give more.

1281
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:29,659
Oh! I see. Don't ask more.

1282
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:32,424
As a first business, this is enough.

1283
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,597
Then let's go.
Okay.

1284
01:34:34,802 --> 01:34:35,427
Son.

1285
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:38,171
I have forgotten about
this because I was busy.

1286
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:39,930
This is salted gooseberry.

1287
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:41,335
Mother, what is the use of this?

1288
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:44,238
When you go there, then he will
need something to eat with that.

1289
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:46,340
Touching.

1290
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:48,862
The first and last mother
who gives touching

1291
01:34:48,863 --> 01:34:51,177
to her son who is going
to drink liquor.

1292
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:52,852
Last mother. Give me.

1293
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,453
Let's go.
Oh, yes.

1294
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:56,055
Don't make it over.

1295
01:34:56,057 --> 01:34:59,857
If the plan goes flop, then you have to
come and see in the mortuary. Mother.

1296
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:05,923
Turn slowly. Turn slowly.
One human being is here.

1297
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:18,103
Building and the area is little old.
Yes.

1298
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:19,941
But the liquor available here is new.

1299
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:21,214
Yes, come.

1300
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:23,277
Thank you.

1301
01:35:25,152 --> 01:35:27,052
Welcome. Welcome.
Thank you. Thank you.

1302
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:29,154
I am doctor...
Dr. Thomas Vaidyan.

1303
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:30,549
Good. Good.

1304
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:33,485
Doctor, have you put this name
after getting MBBS graduation?

1305
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:35,261
Or is it your name which was
put when you are born?

1306
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:38,395
You are naughty.
This is our family name.

1307
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:40,226
Oh!- Come. Come.
Please come.

1308
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:43,062
Anyway it is good.
One doctor in one bar.

1309
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,237
It is very necessary.

1310
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:47,896
The people who come here to drink
have diseases like sugar and pressure.

1311
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:49,938
If a person's sugar would be down,
then we need a doctor...

1312
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:55,141
To give them sugar water
or sweet, right?- Yes.

1313
01:35:55,349 --> 01:35:57,681
Let's go inside.
Okay.

1314
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:01,247
Where is liquor? Give me liquor.

1315
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:04,083
Long time back, I had asked you
to give me one peg of liquor.

1316
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:06,659
I want to die by drinking.

1317
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:10,925
Achu.

1318
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:13,424
He is the person who starts drinking
in the early morning itself.

1319
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:15,301
He is showing all these because
he hasn't got liquor.

1320
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:17,270
You go inaugurate fast.
Then he will be okay.

1321
01:36:17,471 --> 01:36:20,929
Then I will inaugurate fast.
You go. Go.

1322
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:28,206
Too hot.

1323
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:31,280
I am going to die.

1324
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:35,114
Mochanam de-addiction centre.

1325
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:49,464
Hey, you drink this.
Help me. Help.

1326
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:58,438
What happened?
Why are you looking frightened?

1327
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:00,512
You haven't expected, right?

1328
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:05,775
If I play a drama like this, then only
we can lock a libertine like you here.

1329
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:07,450
Stop your drinking.

1330
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:11,950
If you won't obey,
then this doctor will handle you.

1331
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:18,922
Anyway, thanks.
Welcome.

1332
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:21,260
I am thankful to everyone.
Thank you.

1333
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:28,468
When I go to sleep after drinking
and I wake up late in the morning,

1334
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:32,093
I think about getting
rid of this bad habit.

1335
01:37:32,094 --> 01:37:34,709
But it was happened today.

1336
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:37,440
You have made it to happen.
That's god's grace.

1337
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:39,015
Achu.
Yes.

1338
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:40,118
It's good.

1339
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:42,523
It's good that you've
framed a story of

1340
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:44,724
inaugurating the bar and
joined them for this.

1341
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:46,119
Really?
Yes.

1342
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,125
Vaidyan, you tell me.
What?

1343
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:49,227
Doctor, you tell me.

1344
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:52,691
For removing the alcohol content
from my body...

1345
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,892
how long should I co-operate
with Vaidyan?

1346
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:56,693
Sorry doctor.

1347
01:37:56,904 --> 01:38:00,635
It's a silly job for me.
You are young and fresh.

1348
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:03,806
Maximum one month. One month.
One month.

1349
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:06,479
Let it be. One month is okay.

1350
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,978
Uncle. Nelson. Achu.
Yes.

1351
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:12,377
You tell my mother that after
one month,

1352
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,987
Kochukunju will come to Vadakkenveettil
house as a liquor-free person.

1353
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:18,388
Really?
Yes.

1354
01:38:23,197 --> 01:38:26,428
Today, I have taken the risk
of taming a mad elephant.

1355
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:28,397
Anyway, it was happened.

1356
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:32,772
Shall I give one more piece?
No. I will eat full.

1357
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:39,336
My Virgin Mary.
Let him spend one month there.

1358
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:40,911
Mother, you don't worry about that.

1359
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,083
If Kochukunju promised something,
that he would fulfill that.

1360
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:45,245
If he said he will spend one month
there, then he will do that.

1361
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:46,853
Believe me.

1362
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:50,513
Oh! That might be Ramakrishnan.

1363
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:52,021
Mother, tell him that I am not here.
Okay.

1364
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:54,353
Don't bring him here now.
Let me finish this.

1365
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:01,692
Praise Jesus.

1366
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:03,961
Who are you?

1367
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:06,298
I am Dr. Thomas Vaidyan.

1368
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:09,106
You are Kochukunju's mother, right?
Yes.

1369
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,640
Jesus. Mother.

1370
01:39:11,845 --> 01:39:14,211
Mother, you have done some good deeds.

1371
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:18,042
Fourteen years back I had
stopped drinking liquor.

1372
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:23,051
After that I have started one
hospital to treat drunkards.

1373
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:24,224
Mochanam.

1374
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:28,427
But I have broken that promise
and drunk nicely today.

1375
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,393
Are you here? Come here.

1376
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:35,226
Where is our world now?

1377
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:40,566
Holes have been formed in the
ozone layer above the earth.

1378
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:45,074
A R Rahman got Oscar.
Resoolpukutty got Oscar.

1379
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:49,409
Then why didn't Kochukunju of
Vadakkenveettil get Oscar award?

1380
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,083
I am disappointed because of that.

1381
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:56,348
Our world would end in 2050.
Ends by burning.

1382
01:39:56,557 --> 01:40:01,085
Right mother? Jesus.
Who is this?- Vaidya.

1383
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:03,757
I haven't said this truth.

1384
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:08,094
Kochukunju of this house
has told me this.

1385
01:40:08,902 --> 01:40:11,587
For whom, we will discard
liquor by living

1386
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:14,272
in a world which is going to destroy?

1387
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:18,434
When Kochukunju asked me that
let's live in this world by enjoying

1388
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:20,772
that time my heart was broken.

1389
01:40:22,983 --> 01:40:26,282
Then I didn't think anything else.
I have finished two full bottles.

1390
01:40:26,487 --> 01:40:31,618
Now, I am happy.
Mother, you son is a great man.

1391
01:40:31,825 --> 01:40:32,951
Mother.

1392
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:37,062
This Thomas Vaidyan has
come here now to take...

1393
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:41,724
Blessing from you who had given
birth to that great man. Bless me.

1394
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:51,941
Poor, doctor.

1395
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:54,826
Earlier he would become
off when he drunk.

1396
01:40:54,827 --> 01:40:57,340
But now, his mood went foul.

1397
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:01,187
My dear mother,
you don't show bad face.

1398
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:06,755
I promise in the name of Virgin Mary,
mother and this Vaidyan.

1399
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,427
Kochukunju hasn't drunk.

1400
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:10,359
Oh!

1401
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:13,693
Now, you understood.
Yes.

1402
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:19,535
My Nelson. This de-addiction
centre is for drunkards.

1403
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,538
And not for the people like me
who drink liquor.

1404
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:28,640
If my mother who stands here tells me,
then this Kochukunju will stop drinking.

1405
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:33,818
Mother, I am packing the remaining.

1406
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,219
Enough. You pack and take.

1407
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:39,154
However you take, you
have to reach this

1408
01:41:39,155 --> 01:41:41,884
body to Mochanam before
tomorrow morning.

1409
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:44,790
I haven't drunk,
so I am feeling hungry.

1410
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,225
Oh!

1411
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:02,410
Yes, Sharma.

1412
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:05,580
Nandan has been transferred
to Chennai central jail.

1413
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,484
I came to know that.

1414
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:10,688
You please make arrangement to
take him on bail as soon as possible.

1415
01:42:11,558 --> 01:42:14,425
For that, how much money I have to spent
and whoever is needed for taking bail.

1416
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:15,856
I won't mind all that.

1417
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:18,759
He will get bail.
There is no problem for that.

1418
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,931
But those three men are
in the same jail.

1419
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:44,620
What is the matter?

1420
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:47,784
Kochukunju.

1421
01:42:49,196 --> 01:42:55,465
A good news for us who are waiting
to meet him after releasing from jail.

1422
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:58,961
A dog that became fat
by eating his waste.

1423
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,299
His GM.

1424
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:02,466
He is now here.

1425
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:07,644
Now, that's enough for us
to satisfy our hands.

1426
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:23,325
You have come inside to eat after
eating his waste till now right?

1427
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:24,719
Fool.

1428
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:39,235
No.

1429
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,510
Don't do your old revenge against
my Bose towards me.

1430
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:44,013
He won't like that.

1431
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:45,515
He.

1432
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,514
That body should sleep as added body.

1433
01:43:48,822 --> 01:43:51,518
And he should bury that.

1434
01:43:51,758 --> 01:43:55,194
Then only Asif Ali lbrahim's
sons can sleep peacefully.

1435
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:56,529
His...

1436
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:27,727
Anwar, No.
Please listen to me.

1437
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,726
Even if you kill me, then too,
you can't win over my Kuchukunju.

1438
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:33,289
His Kochukunju.

1439
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:25,780
Nandan.

1440
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,387
Earlier you were injured.

1441
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,290
For us.

1442
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:32,890
But this.

1443
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,625
How will I tolerate this?

1444
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:37,796
You should tolerate.
You have to tolerate.

1445
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:39,966
I can't.

1446
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:45,560
Whoever had hurt you,
I won't leave them.

1447
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:50,139
Sharma. I need them.

1448
01:45:50,777 --> 01:45:52,142
In their place itself.

1449
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:55,311
Even if it is the jail, let it be.
No, Kochu.

1450
01:45:55,682 --> 01:45:58,480
Please listen to me.
Don't take it as serious.

1451
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:01,980
Lot of times you only told me
that they are your siblings.

1452
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:03,654
I am begging you.

1453
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:06,322
They... don't do that.

1454
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:07,720
Nandan, you don't block me.

1455
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:10,588
You don't say anything.
I know you very well.

1456
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:14,062
That's why I am telling you.
Let them do anything.

1457
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:21,301
But don't do anything by thinking about
Asim who loved us a lot for six years.

1458
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:23,173
Please.

1459
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:36,412
Hey. I have told you
that I will give you money.

1460
01:46:36,757 --> 01:46:40,022
I need only two-three photographs.
For my thesis.

1461
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:43,128
For this Veluchami,
money is not a matter.

1462
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:45,515
It's not right that
you have come to this

1463
01:46:45,516 --> 01:46:47,699
windmill without the
permission of owner.

1464
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:49,365
Oh! Go.

1465
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:52,868
This wind farm alone is here, right?
I will find another one.

1466
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:56,740
Don't get angry Madam.
One minute.

1467
01:46:57,644 --> 01:47:00,545
In this area, there is 4300 wind mill.

1468
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:03,307
Only one owner for these
entire 4300 wind mill.

1469
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:04,449
My owner.

1470
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:07,984
Whichever wind mill you go,
this is the situation.

1471
01:47:09,322 --> 01:47:10,220
Jesus.

1472
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,490
How will I make him understand about

1473
01:47:13,491 --> 01:47:16,556
astronomy, wind's direction, etc.
In Tamil.

1474
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:18,162
Madam, what you said?

1475
01:47:18,365 --> 01:47:21,493
Hey, you tell me who is your owner?

1476
01:47:22,335 --> 01:47:25,896
Madam. Don't worry.
I will tell you who my owner is.

1477
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:35,570
See, our boss's timing.
He has come in the right time.

1478
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:48,920
Boss.

1479
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,256
One madam has come to meet you.

1480
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:53,330
Madam?
Who is that?

1481
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:58,366
My Virgin Mary. She?

1482
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:02,508
Stop there.

1483
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:07,439
It's you! Why are you here?

1484
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:10,207
Why are you here?
That too in this fancy dress.

1485
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:15,778
My dear libertine.
You get into the vehicle now.

1486
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:19,356
I will tell you everything in detail.
Wait.

1487
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,521
Before entering into the vehicle
I want to know how...

1488
01:48:21,928 --> 01:48:27,730
The useless fellow in Vadakeveettil
house has become the God of this place?

1489
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:33,155
You have ran away from the house after

1490
01:48:33,156 --> 01:48:36,306
getting thrashed for
stealing aunt's chain.

1491
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,478
Not bull's vehicle.
It's bus.

1492
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:42,139
Let it be anything.
How you reached up to this level?

1493
01:48:43,216 --> 01:48:46,413
Everything has started in a vehicle.

1494
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:49,985
So, you get into this vehicle now.
I will tell you everything.

1495
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:56,287
Maybe because the
horoscope is Kochukunju's,

1496
01:48:56,429 --> 01:48:59,159
I have stopped in a
liquor shop in Erode.

1497
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,827
I don't know whether it is
luck or fate.

1498
01:49:03,537 --> 01:49:09,772
But I have seen my father for the first
time there who was supposed to be dead.

1499
01:49:09,976 --> 01:49:10,670
Father.

1500
01:49:11,444 --> 01:49:15,346
The father of this libertine
Daveed Lopos.

1501
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:19,515
Your father?
He is alive.

1502
01:49:20,253 --> 01:49:26,852
He is living with his tragic life
by writing some books.

1503
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:31,688
That day my father hugged me
and told me something.

1504
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:36,368
I won't fail in front of the people in
Vadakkenveettil house like his father.

1505
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:39,369
I should become a rich man.

1506
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:43,706
I have started from there
with that word.

1507
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:45,244
For living.

1508
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:48,480
I became the waiter of
Leopold cafe in Mumbai

1509
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,183
from the position of waiter
in that toddy shop.

1510
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:55,715
Then Maldives.
In the resort of a Philippines man.

1511
01:49:56,423 --> 01:50:02,555
Housekeeping job.
After that Kochukunju crossed the sea.

1512
01:50:03,897 --> 01:50:04,886
To Dubai.

1513
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:11,566
That city was the turning point
of my life.

1514
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:18,004
But I have reached
Dehra fish market in Dubai.

1515
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:21,743
I had seen my Nandan there.

1516
01:50:23,116 --> 01:50:29,248
After that, Nandan was my friend,
guide and sibling.

1517
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:30,485
Everything.

1518
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:35,159
Thus my dreams slowly got wings.

1519
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:42,528
Nandan also accompanied me in making
money to fulfill my father's wish.

1520
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:44,494
One midnight like that.

1521
01:50:51,077 --> 01:50:52,772
Kochu. Some problem is there.

1522
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:54,276
Reverse the vehicle.

1523
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:57,112
Kochu.

1524
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:05,604
I don't know whether
as a savior or to save

1525
01:51:05,605 --> 01:51:08,385
him God had brought
me in front of him.

1526
01:51:08,928 --> 01:51:10,623
Hafiz Ali lbrahim.

1527
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:16,959
In return for saving his life he
had offered me a new life.

1528
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:22,069
He might have felt sympathy by
hearing Kochukunju's life story.

1529
01:51:22,842 --> 01:51:26,073
He asked me whether I should
work along with him.

1530
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:36,755
For reaching my target,
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju...

1531
01:51:37,257 --> 01:51:39,487
Had become the right hand
of Hafiz Ali lbrahim.

1532
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:42,218
He owns a shipping company.

1533
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:47,597
His kingdom has spread
throughout the gulf countries.

1534
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:52,495
Hafiz Ali lbrahim was the
Sultan of Muhammad's holy land.

1535
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:55,067
Father, what is your right
to obstruct this?

1536
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:59,005
Three of us are the Board of Directors
of Mecca Shipping & Logistics company.

1537
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:00,769
We have promised them.

1538
01:52:01,047 --> 01:52:03,845
If it doesn't happen,
not only we suffer the loss of crores...

1539
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:05,847
But also we can't walk
outside because of shame.

1540
01:52:06,052 --> 01:52:08,350
It should happen like that.
Then only you will learn a lesson.

1541
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:17,027
Three of us are living in the shade
of Hafiz Ali lbrahim for long time.

1542
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,788
Now, we also need a life.

1543
01:52:18,998 --> 01:52:22,024
We know how to avoid the people
who are against us for that.

1544
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:24,533
Even if it is our own father.
Enough.

1545
01:52:24,971 --> 01:52:28,304
I knew that I should hear
this from your mouth soon.

1546
01:52:28,508 --> 01:52:30,909
Now onwards, there is no
place for these three

1547
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:33,309
sons in brother Hafiz's
heart and house.

1548
01:52:33,513 --> 01:52:35,811
Get out from here. Now.
At this moment.

1549
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:45,888
The trusted animal has come.

1550
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:52,224
Make some money and set up
your life before he dies.

1551
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:02,002
Brother, what is the problem?

1552
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:06,702
Problem is my fate.
They are my children.

1553
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,428
If I discard them through
karma, then too,

1554
01:53:08,429 --> 01:53:09,776
I can't avoid them
because of my dharma.

1555
01:53:09,983 --> 01:53:13,942
Those fools have taken
money from someone for...

1556
01:53:14,154 --> 01:53:18,113
Smuggling RDX under the
banner of Mecca Shipping company.

1557
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:22,360
Till now, Hafiz Ali
lbrahim's hand become

1558
01:53:22,361 --> 01:53:24,726
wet with the blood of innocent people.

1559
01:53:25,098 --> 01:53:26,531
I will never allow for that.

1560
01:53:33,673 --> 01:53:36,198
Nandan, I am scared.

1561
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:41,813
They won't even leave their father.
They will do anything.

1562
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:45,583
Kochu, you don't worry.
You are always with him, know?

1563
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:49,981
Besides that the prayers of
people whom he has helped.

1564
01:53:57,363 --> 01:53:58,330
Hello, Brother.

1565
01:54:04,971 --> 01:54:05,835
Brother.

1566
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:24,353
Brother.

1567
01:54:55,054 --> 01:54:55,816
Cheating.

1568
01:54:56,422 --> 01:55:01,223
The murder charge of the person whom
I loved as my own father, fell on me.

1569
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:04,888
I had suffered for four years.
In Dubai jail.

1570
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:08,963
It took four years to prove
that I am innocent.

1571
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:14,063
After proving that, the new chapter
in my life had started.

1572
01:55:14,774 --> 01:55:16,901
Advocate Anand Sharma.

1573
01:55:17,143 --> 01:55:20,476
Long back, he had realised his children.

1574
01:55:21,414 --> 01:55:26,408
So, he hadn't given his property
in their name.

1575
01:55:28,221 --> 01:55:32,920
Now onwards Hafiz Ali lbrahim's
kingdom is in your hands.

1576
01:55:34,961 --> 01:55:38,488
Vadakkenveettil Kochukunju
has become a boss...

1577
01:55:39,065 --> 01:55:42,523
with the wealth & responsibility
which I got.

1578
01:56:28,648 --> 01:56:31,811
Hafiz Ali lbrahim's children
are destroyed...

1579
01:56:32,085 --> 01:56:37,113
when they lost their father
who had guided them.

1580
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:39,624
They have jumped from
one mistake to another.

1581
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:43,122
But at last they were caught.
Here in India.

1582
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:49,799
Tamil Nadu police had recovered
two container AK-56 guns.

1583
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:51,300
They were sentenced for life.

1584
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:56,241
But with the power of money,
it was reduced to five years.

1585
01:56:58,077 --> 01:57:03,379
In one way, today is a good day
to open a flashback like this.

1586
01:57:04,517 --> 01:57:09,477
Brother Hafiz's sons' five years
of jail life is ending today.

1587
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:11,714
Kochukunju, your father.

1588
01:57:12,091 --> 01:57:14,992
Can I meet your father?
Yes.

1589
01:57:15,928 --> 01:57:16,917
Not only you.

1590
01:57:17,797 --> 01:57:20,493
All the members of Vadakkenveettil
house should meet my father.

1591
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:21,928
That day is not away.

1592
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:24,495
But before...

1593
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:28,168
The burden which I am carrying
for the last six years.

1594
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:31,002
I am going to get rid
of that tomorrow.

1595
01:57:41,454 --> 01:57:43,684
Why do you want to meet me urgently?

1596
01:57:46,559 --> 01:57:47,355
What is this?

1597
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:50,525
Earlier you have given this
to me with your hands.

1598
01:57:51,664 --> 01:57:55,964
The wealth of Hafiz Ali lbrahim.
The document of that.

1599
01:57:57,403 --> 01:58:02,932
The remuneration which I got
for loving him as a son.

1600
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:09,542
If his children are showing enmity
for this, then let it end like this.

1601
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:13,211
Why are you taking a decision
like this immediately?

1602
01:58:13,686 --> 01:58:15,313
They are...
They were in jail.

1603
01:58:15,855 --> 01:58:16,719
Till yesterday.

1604
01:58:18,591 --> 01:58:20,906
When they come from
jail after serving five

1605
01:58:20,907 --> 01:58:23,221
years, it is better to
give this back to them.

1606
01:58:23,696 --> 01:58:25,459
I felt that Sharma should do that.

1607
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:33,663
Good. You got a good mind.

1608
01:58:34,273 --> 01:58:39,575
If their revenge will end with this,
then let it get over.

1609
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:43,411
Going.

1610
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:17,116
What you think?

1611
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:23,520
We will remain in the jail
throughout our life.

1612
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,720
Did you understand?
May I tell you?

1613
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:34,862
I am Anwar Ali.

1614
01:59:38,104 --> 01:59:40,704
We are the three children born in the

1615
01:59:40,705 --> 01:59:43,303
blood of your old boss
Hafiz Ali lbrahim.

1616
01:59:43,676 --> 01:59:44,802
Younger brother.

1617
01:59:45,344 --> 01:59:46,311
Younger brother.

1618
01:59:46,846 --> 01:59:48,211
Why are you telling me all these?

1619
01:59:49,615 --> 01:59:53,142
My brother won't talk like this.
I have come here to meet you.

1620
01:59:53,352 --> 01:59:56,321
We too, have come to meet you.
Not for anything else.

1621
01:59:56,689 --> 01:59:58,418
Before going to house.

1622
01:59:58,624 --> 02:00:01,422
I want to see you sleeping in
front of your house in the...

1623
02:00:01,627 --> 02:00:07,156
North-south position by lightening
a lamp and allow you to sleep forever.

1624
02:00:09,535 --> 02:00:11,162
Shall we cuddle you?

1625
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:12,337
No.

1626
02:00:16,576 --> 02:00:19,739
Please leave me. I have come
here with justice for you.

1627
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:21,741
Your... your property.

1628
02:00:26,085 --> 02:00:28,849
We are not ready to hear
what you are going to say.

1629
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:32,922
Now onwards, you won't have
tongue to speak justice.

1630
02:00:33,559 --> 02:00:35,925
Your neck won't be even there.

1631
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,102
Please. Please.

1632
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,528
Nanda.

1633
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:51,103
Where are they now?

1634
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:53,772
They are going to Dubai
by flight tonight.

1635
02:01:57,209 --> 02:01:58,107
Brother.

1636
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:03,949
Hey, Anwar.
Yes.

1637
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:05,708
The Afghan who called
in the morning is calling.

1638
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:07,042
You pick the phone.
Okay.

1639
02:02:09,755 --> 02:02:10,551
Hello.

1640
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:12,387
Greetings, Brother.

1641
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:17,224
Because of your prayer
everything is fine.

1642
02:02:17,663 --> 02:02:22,066
Of course, we can definitely meet.
Bye. Bye.

1643
02:02:24,603 --> 02:02:26,628
They will meet us in the desert camp.

1644
02:02:26,839 --> 02:02:28,739
If this project works out,
we will get Rs.40 crores.

1645
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:30,306
This is not the matter of money.

1646
02:02:30,543 --> 02:02:33,524
This is an opportunity
to prove that Hafiz

1647
02:02:33,525 --> 02:02:36,504
Ali's children haven't
forgotten all plays.

1648
02:02:54,734 --> 02:02:58,431
Is this the place?
Yes, Balesa dessert camp.

1649
02:02:59,372 --> 02:03:02,535
This is locked.
You try to call them in phone.

1650
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,437
Oh! No range.

1651
02:03:52,825 --> 02:03:55,453
Yes. I have called you here.

1652
02:03:55,694 --> 02:03:57,628
For your last partnership business.

1653
02:03:57,830 --> 02:04:00,890
You have killed your father first
because of your greediness to money.

1654
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,897
After that, a lot of innocent people.

1655
02:04:03,102 --> 02:04:04,899
At last, you have killed that
innocent man who had come...

1656
02:04:05,037 --> 02:04:07,004
There to give you this gift
which I had got from your father.

1657
02:04:07,173 --> 02:04:09,471
Before allowing him to say
that you have killed him, right?

1658
02:04:09,675 --> 02:04:11,734
Fools born to a good father.

1659
02:07:21,133 --> 02:07:22,031
Hello Menon sir.

1660
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:24,299
Mr. Alex, I am returning
after conducting

1661
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:26,364
a last meeting with
other shareholders.

1662
02:07:28,007 --> 02:07:30,532
Only four days left for the
deadline which I told you.

1663
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:33,205
Our company doesn't have
an option for refunding.

1664
02:07:33,412 --> 02:07:35,710
Rs.30 crores which
you've given as advance.

1665
02:07:35,914 --> 02:07:37,939
That means, you lose that money too.

1666
02:07:38,417 --> 02:07:40,715
I know.
I know, Menon Sir.

1667
02:07:42,254 --> 02:07:45,223
At any risk, I will do that.

1668
02:07:59,872 --> 02:08:06,573
Now only I understood that Katrina
mother is taking books from my room.

1669
02:08:06,779 --> 02:08:07,905
You give me that.

1670
02:08:08,814 --> 02:08:09,576
What is this?

1671
02:08:10,282 --> 02:08:13,979
I think you have become sentimental
by reading the creation of Neelan.

1672
02:08:17,456 --> 02:08:20,983
Mother, are you feeling to worship
the author of this book?

1673
02:08:21,293 --> 02:08:22,521
I don't know why.

1674
02:08:22,895 --> 02:08:26,353
I am feeling that it is
similar to my life.

1675
02:08:27,466 --> 02:08:30,435
That's why Kochukunju
is keeping this.

1676
02:08:30,703 --> 02:08:34,935
Earlier when I left the house and went
I had met this writer one mid night.

1677
02:08:35,307 --> 02:08:38,765
After that he used to
send me his new creations.

1678
02:08:39,478 --> 02:08:40,274
Leave that.

1679
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:43,446
Why aunts want to meet me urgently?

1680
02:08:43,649 --> 02:08:45,344
That we will tell you.

1681
02:08:48,153 --> 02:08:49,450
Are you standing here?

1682
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:53,780
We should have to stand.
Now everything is in your hand.

1683
02:08:53,992 --> 02:08:54,890
What happened?

1684
02:08:55,094 --> 02:08:57,562
Did the bosses of this house
go to Kasi?

1685
02:08:57,830 --> 02:08:59,855
Oh! He started his jokes.

1686
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:01,794
I don't know whether you
remember or not.

1687
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,968
You are born in my hands.

1688
02:09:04,169 --> 02:09:09,539
That means my aunt was the midwife
of Vadakkenveettil house, right?

1689
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:16,779
Hey. You listen what aunts want
to tell you without teasing them.

1690
02:09:17,483 --> 02:09:21,715
Tell me, Aunt. Now, tell me.
I am ready to hear anything.

1691
02:09:21,987 --> 02:09:24,717
I will tell you the matter
without preface.

1692
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:26,284
Hey, Kochu.
Yes.

1693
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:29,459
That day, your uncles had
called and told the children...

1694
02:09:29,661 --> 02:09:33,859
That they will give
them their shares. Yes.

1695
02:09:34,066 --> 02:09:37,058
They have planned something with that.

1696
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:39,396
If some outsider will hear this,
what will they say?

1697
02:09:39,605 --> 02:09:43,234
It is like inviting someone, kept leaf
in front of that and not giving food.

1698
02:09:43,642 --> 02:09:44,631
Right?
Yes.

1699
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:47,141
Is it?

1700
02:09:47,746 --> 02:09:49,913
In brief, here everybody
is sitting by keeping

1701
02:09:49,914 --> 02:09:52,080
a leaf in front of them to have food.

1702
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:55,648
You tell me.
What should I serve in that leaf?

1703
02:09:55,854 --> 02:09:58,414
Should I serve buttermilk or pickle?

1704
02:09:58,624 --> 02:10:04,324
You be a good boy and sign in that.
Yes. That's all. I am ready.

1705
02:10:04,530 --> 02:10:07,328
Kochukunju is ready to sign
at this moment.

1706
02:10:08,133 --> 02:10:09,300
Promise in the name of Virgin Mary?

1707
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:12,498
Mary? Promise in the name
of Malayatoormala Muttappan.

1708
02:10:22,881 --> 02:10:24,075
Let's start.

1709
02:10:24,716 --> 02:10:25,512
Oh, yes.

1710
02:10:25,984 --> 02:10:27,349
Advocate. Wait.

1711
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:29,520
What?

1712
02:10:29,888 --> 02:10:31,355
Kochukunju is not here.

1713
02:10:35,727 --> 02:10:36,921
Hey, dirty fellow.

1714
02:10:37,296 --> 02:10:40,026
It is not mentioned in any religious
epics that we should worship God.

1715
02:10:40,232 --> 02:10:42,860
Trust and love that is only
mentioned in all that.

1716
02:10:43,068 --> 02:10:46,128
The thickness of all epics
became thick because of the...

1717
02:10:46,338 --> 02:10:51,708
Reason that people won't
understand these two things.

1718
02:10:51,910 --> 02:10:52,968
Why should I say lot?

1719
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:55,544
When Karl Marx wrote Das Capital,

1720
02:10:55,714 --> 02:10:57,807
it is because of this reason,
that book became thick.

1721
02:10:59,084 --> 02:11:00,142
Very nice.

1722
02:11:00,419 --> 02:11:02,717
That's why the uncles in
Vadakkenveettil house say

1723
02:11:02,921 --> 02:11:05,219
that this libertine's tongue
doesn't have license.

1724
02:11:05,424 --> 02:11:06,721
I am your son.

1725
02:11:09,094 --> 02:11:09,958
Who is this?

1726
02:11:10,596 --> 02:11:11,062
Hello.

1727
02:11:11,263 --> 02:11:12,560
Hello. Where are you now?

1728
02:11:13,265 --> 02:11:16,894
Uncle, I am here... Gundelpettu.

1729
02:11:17,936 --> 02:11:20,837
I have come here regarding
the matter of potato farming.

1730
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:23,405
A foreigner from Germany
has just landed.

1731
02:11:23,609 --> 02:11:26,077
When the foreigner landed here,
he asked me.

1732
02:11:26,278 --> 02:11:28,576
Hello Mr. Kochukunju,
can we meet today.

1733
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:31,078
I said, sure.
That's why I came here.

1734
02:11:31,884 --> 02:11:33,249
What you have done?

1735
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:36,984
Till now you haven't believed this,
I will handover phone to the foreigner.

1736
02:11:39,691 --> 02:11:41,090
Good evening Mr. Thankachan.

1737
02:11:41,293 --> 02:11:43,420
I have spoken to Mr. Kochukunju
regarding potato farming.

1738
02:11:43,629 --> 02:11:46,029
Yes. Foreigner.

1739
02:11:46,298 --> 02:11:48,095
No.
Give me.

1740
02:11:48,634 --> 02:11:52,434
Uncle, did you believe now?
Fool.

1741
02:11:52,804 --> 02:11:56,331
If you become happy after defeating
all of us, then don't come here.

1742
02:11:56,808 --> 02:11:59,276
The path of your late father
is suited for you.

1743
02:11:59,478 --> 02:12:02,777
What? Late father?
Now, I will give him.

1744
02:12:02,981 --> 02:12:04,448
Master, tell him some bad words.
Go.

1745
02:12:05,217 --> 02:12:06,013
What you said?

1746
02:12:06,251 --> 02:12:11,450
I will come there immediately
by thinking about my father.

1747
02:12:13,358 --> 02:12:14,256
Thankachan.
Yes.

1748
02:12:14,493 --> 02:12:19,294
Father and uncles are planning
to play a trick with...

1749
02:12:19,998 --> 02:12:22,967
Kochukunju, then you
tear grandfather's will.

1750
02:12:24,269 --> 02:12:26,737
This Alex knows what to do.

1751
02:12:43,622 --> 02:12:46,284
What happened, mother?
I am coming.

1752
02:12:47,059 --> 02:12:48,617
Uncle completed 700 years, right?

1753
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:50,185
Leave jokes.

1754
02:12:51,263 --> 02:12:54,357
I got tensed when I didn't get
you in line for two days.

1755
02:12:55,233 --> 02:12:59,897
You please come here.
Otherwise, I won't get peace of mind.

1756
02:13:00,572 --> 02:13:06,306
Here, everybody has come.
Again in the name of this...

1757
02:13:07,412 --> 02:13:09,642
Mother, you keep the phone.
I am coming.

1758
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:12,910
Let me change the gear to our house.

1759
02:18:03,008 --> 02:18:04,134
Fool, tell me.

1760
02:18:04,342 --> 02:18:08,676
From whose hand you took money to kill
Kochukunju hitting with this vehicle?

1761
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:10,575
Hey, tell me. Tell me.

1762
02:18:55,427 --> 02:18:58,225
You want to eat the food of
uncle's seventh birthday and...

1763
02:18:58,430 --> 02:19:01,558
This younger brother's
last rituals, right, brother.

1764
02:19:04,102 --> 02:19:05,660
Hey.
Don't move.

1765
02:19:05,870 --> 02:19:06,734
Hey. Kochukunju

1766
02:19:06,938 --> 02:19:08,633
if you raise hand at Kochukunju,

1767
02:19:09,274 --> 02:19:13,643
then I won't respect your IAS position.
I will thrash you.

1768
02:19:13,845 --> 02:19:15,904
Kochukunju.
Nelson, don't interfere in this.

1769
02:19:17,782 --> 02:19:20,262
Don't show your dirty behavior on an

1770
02:19:20,263 --> 02:19:22,742
auspicious day after
drinking and come here.

1771
02:19:23,121 --> 02:19:26,090
You have beaten my son.
Right, you fool.

1772
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:28,259
I have beaten him because
I am born to a good father.

1773
02:19:28,626 --> 02:19:30,924
If this father doesn't need that,
then move aside.

1774
02:19:31,796 --> 02:19:34,424
If you have come here to beat
everybody, then you beat me first.

1775
02:19:34,632 --> 02:19:36,600
Kochukunju. What happened to you?
Have you become mad?

1776
02:19:36,801 --> 02:19:38,769
I haven't gone mad.
He has made me mad.

1777
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:41,097
That son of this father.

1778
02:19:41,973 --> 02:19:43,099
Jesus.
Jesus.

1779
02:19:44,242 --> 02:19:45,209
Mother, do you want to see?

1780
02:20:10,635 --> 02:20:13,103
He will tell you the remaining
of what I said.

1781
02:20:13,405 --> 02:20:14,702
Tell them, you pig.

1782
02:20:16,875 --> 02:20:18,775
If you don't tell them,
I will kill you.

1783
02:20:22,814 --> 02:20:25,009
I will tell.
I will tell everything.

1784
02:20:25,316 --> 02:20:29,946
For killing sir, this SP sir
has given Rs.1 .5 lakh.

1785
02:20:30,155 --> 02:20:30,780
Hey.

1786
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:36,522
Listened?

1787
02:20:36,995 --> 02:20:39,225
Uncles and brothers of
Vadakkenveettil house.

1788
02:20:39,697 --> 02:20:43,463
He has given money not for fostering,
but to kill this younger brother.

1789
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:46,464
I want to know for what reason
he hired people to kill me.

1790
02:20:48,339 --> 02:20:50,637
What is this?
Is what he said true?

1791
02:20:50,842 --> 02:20:52,969
Is it true?
Yes.

1792
02:20:54,646 --> 02:20:55,237
Jesus.

1793
02:20:55,447 --> 02:20:59,975
We have decided to finish him
when he tried to make us fools...

1794
02:21:00,285 --> 02:21:03,652
with the power that
grandfather's property could...

1795
02:21:03,855 --> 02:21:06,323
Be shared only with his consent.

1796
02:21:08,193 --> 02:21:10,661
We have signed an agreement of Rs.300
crore for private harbour project.

1797
02:21:10,862 --> 02:21:13,047
We have also given Rs.30
crores as advance.

1798
02:21:13,048 --> 02:21:15,231
We were not ready to suffer that loss.

1799
02:21:15,433 --> 02:21:17,901
Not me only, these people also.
Let them deny.

1800
02:21:21,539 --> 02:21:22,665
Uncle, how is this?

1801
02:21:23,041 --> 02:21:26,568
Did you see a scene like this when
you saw a dream that he children in...

1802
02:21:26,744 --> 02:21:31,181
Vadakkenveettill house is
fighting for the property?

1803
02:21:33,952 --> 02:21:37,786
The scene of giving money for
quotation party for killing own brother.

1804
02:21:40,625 --> 02:21:44,857
Family and fathers are the same,
then you might have seen that too.

1805
02:21:45,897 --> 02:21:47,524
Earlier, habit was the same.

1806
02:21:50,568 --> 02:21:52,218
This is not for the
first time, a person in

1807
02:21:52,219 --> 02:21:53,867
the family is giving
money to kill someone.

1808
02:21:54,172 --> 02:21:55,867
Uncle, can you deny that?

1809
02:21:56,574 --> 02:21:58,371
By looking at this libertine's face.

1810
02:22:01,746 --> 02:22:02,713
Conduct everything.

1811
02:22:03,414 --> 02:22:07,373
Celebration of 70th birthday and
the feast of that. Conduct everything.

1812
02:22:07,952 --> 02:22:11,452
Don't dream that you
should live more to do

1813
02:22:11,453 --> 02:22:14,952
more sins by seeing
thousands of full moon.

1814
02:22:20,098 --> 02:22:25,559
Tell this to your children
whom you have brought up.

1815
02:22:26,104 --> 02:22:27,401
Advocate.
Yes.

1816
02:22:27,772 --> 02:22:30,798
You tell me in which document
should Kochukunju sign.

1817
02:22:31,209 --> 02:22:34,309
That is not because of
something else. It is

1818
02:22:34,310 --> 02:22:37,409
to avoid a war between
siblings like this.

1819
02:22:37,615 --> 02:22:41,017
When you share everything,
this Kochukunju

1820
02:22:41,018 --> 02:22:44,418
doesn't need even a sand from that.

1821
02:22:45,957 --> 02:22:47,356
Except these two hearts.

1822
02:23:27,765 --> 02:23:29,381
Now all the heirs have
signed the documents.

1823
02:23:29,382 --> 02:23:30,996
Let's handover the property document.

1824
02:23:50,822 --> 02:23:57,193
What I am giving is not a property.
It is the life of our father.

1825
02:23:58,162 --> 02:24:01,563
Whatever we sowed in this land
has given 100 percent harvest.

1826
02:24:05,937 --> 02:24:07,802
Lord Palani Murugan.

1827
02:24:08,339 --> 02:24:09,237
No sir.

1828
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:12,510
This property which
father and children had

1829
02:24:12,511 --> 02:24:15,479
made by hard work would
remain here like this.

1830
02:24:15,947 --> 02:24:18,313
That too by harvesting 100 percent.

1831
02:24:19,017 --> 02:24:22,817
I am not the actual owner who is
buying this. I am just benami.

1832
02:24:23,221 --> 02:24:26,315
That big man...
Look. He is coming.

1833
02:25:10,635 --> 02:25:13,263
When a person is alive,
he will become old.

1834
02:25:13,638 --> 02:25:14,696
That is natural.

1835
02:25:15,807 --> 02:25:20,176
But I am a person who
became old even after death.

1836
02:25:25,983 --> 02:25:27,712
If you didn't recognize me,
then I will tell you.

1837
02:25:28,419 --> 02:25:31,616
I am a theatre artist who
had come to this house long back.

1838
02:25:31,923 --> 02:25:34,050
My name is Daveed.

1839
02:25:41,432 --> 02:25:44,299
Come Sir. Come.
Firstly you take this document.

1840
02:25:44,769 --> 02:25:45,565
Document.

1841
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:48,068
Earlier too, I hadn't
come to Vadakkenveettil

1842
02:25:48,069 --> 02:25:50,366
house by seeing the
status of this family.

1843
02:25:50,575 --> 02:25:53,135
Now too, I haven't come by
thinking that, I don't need that.

1844
02:25:54,579 --> 02:25:59,312
I don't need this land which the
great Vedakeemveettil...

1845
02:25:59,617 --> 02:26:02,484
Kochouseph has made by hard work.

1846
02:26:02,854 --> 02:26:04,418
A person is here who is
eligible to own that.

1847
02:26:04,419 --> 02:26:05,982
In the blood of this street person.

1848
02:26:06,424 --> 02:26:08,956
Born in this family.
Not born for a father.

1849
02:26:08,957 --> 02:26:11,487
Born for a mother.

1850
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:16,322
The person whom you called
with nickname. This libertine.

1851
02:26:23,875 --> 02:26:24,671
He.

1852
02:26:25,376 --> 02:26:26,673
He has bought this.

1853
02:26:31,082 --> 02:26:34,347
He has acted in front of you
after growing that muck.

1854
02:26:40,424 --> 02:26:45,361
Kurien, if you hand won't sweat,
then give that in his hand.

1855
02:26:50,668 --> 02:26:52,693
Daveed. Please...
No.

1856
02:26:53,638 --> 02:26:58,803
No bungalow in the world has
raised up to the sky with pride.

1857
02:27:00,077 --> 02:27:04,036
Only artists have touched that
sky full of goodness with his hand.

1858
02:27:04,715 --> 02:27:08,776
With sword, you can cut one head.
But words will break heart.

1859
02:27:09,654 --> 02:27:14,819
May be due to that, when you send
Neelakandan with a sword in his hand,

1860
02:27:15,259 --> 02:27:16,817
he didn't do that.

1861
02:27:25,369 --> 02:27:27,997
One heart is here which
was hurt by me.

1862
02:27:28,873 --> 02:27:33,833
I am having only one word in
my heart to cure that hurt.

1863
02:27:40,685 --> 02:27:41,515
Pardon me.

1864
02:28:10,281 --> 02:28:11,213
Katrina.

1865
02:28:19,724 --> 02:28:23,785
Is there anymore tear left
with you to cry for me?

1866
02:28:24,996 --> 02:28:29,023
I can't believe it even as a dream.

1867
02:28:31,335 --> 02:28:38,335
Migratory birds are like that.
It will make nest in somewhere.

1868
02:28:39,010 --> 02:28:46,010
After that their children
will fly to that nest.

1869
02:28:47,852 --> 02:28:51,379
You have given a son for me
to come back to the nest...

1870
02:28:51,889 --> 02:28:55,882
Which this migratory bird
had made long back.

1871
02:28:57,361 --> 02:29:00,262
The guide of father.
My naughty boy.

1872
02:29:01,032 --> 02:29:01,999
Your libertine.

1873
02:29:02,833 --> 02:29:03,765
Master.

1874
02:29:04,201 --> 02:29:05,429
Don't make it over.

1875
02:29:06,037 --> 02:29:08,665
Master? Call me father. Libertine.

1876
02:29:09,974 --> 02:29:10,668
Mother.

1877
02:29:11,309 --> 02:29:13,334
If you throw me out of this house,
then let it be.

1878
02:29:13,978 --> 02:29:15,741
I am going to do something.

1879
02:29:31,062 --> 02:29:32,529
I know that it won't pain you.

1880
02:29:32,730 --> 02:29:36,257
You have hidden everything
from this mother.

1881
02:29:36,567 --> 02:29:39,092
For that, take this.

1882
02:29:43,741 --> 02:29:45,368
Are you happy now, my son?

1883
02:29:46,344 --> 02:29:47,709
Happy.
Okay.

1884
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:52,508
This what wind said...
What sea said...

1885
02:29:52,717 --> 02:29:55,015
And what time said...
Are lies...

1886
02:29:55,519 --> 02:30:00,115
" He is a libertine."
"He is a libertine in this place."

1887
02:30:00,324 --> 02:30:04,624
" He is a libertine."
"He is a libertine in this place."

1888
02:30:04,895 --> 02:30:08,763
" Giving grief to his mother."
"He is a libertine."

1889
02:30:09,467 --> 02:30:13,369
" Giving grief to his mother."
"He is a libertine."

1890
02:30:20,745 --> 02:30:22,474
" He is a libertine."

1891
02:30:27,685 --> 02:30:32,054
" Libertine."

1892
02:30:32,079 --> 02:30:36,079
