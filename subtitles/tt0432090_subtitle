00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,971
His name is Somaraju

3
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,973
He came to Vizag three years ago

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,269
But he is the talk of the town
3 lakhs of Vizag people talk only about him

5
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,271
All port contracts go to him

6
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,441
To move anything from here
his permission is a must

7
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,618
Don't show interest
in this port contract business

8
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,953
I had kiIIed 20 peopIe for this

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,622
Don't be the 21 in that Iist

10
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,124
I have aIso kiIIed 2 to
3 persons recentIy sir!

00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,794
These are aII common in business sir!

12
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,129
It's getting Iate for my train, Bye!

13
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,635
He is going to Hyderabad
to bid for the tender

14
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,804
-In which train?
-Godavari

15
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,305
Make a caII to Mysamma

16
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,686
His name is Mysammma!
Right hand for Somaraju in Hyderabad

17
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,813
He'll do whatever that man commands

18
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,148
Ok brother!
Forget about it

19
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,318
-What is the arrivaI time of
Godavari express? -At 5:30 a.m.

20
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,655
Don't booze tonight
We have a work tomorrow morning

21
00:01:55,198 --> 00:02:00,829
The death shouId be terribIe
and nobody shouId have ..

22
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,335
. . .the guts again to do that to Bhavani!

23
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,171
..or even think about it

24
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,674
Brother! Train has arrived

25
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,039
No one shouId identify the corpse

26
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,628
This baby's name is Mahalakshmi
Daughter of Somaraju

27
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,590
She is everything to him. His loves
his daughter so dearly like...

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,551
-I don't want that!
-Then what do you want?

29
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,888
I want that doII dad

30
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,724
My daughter Iikes this doII!
Give it to me

31
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,850
My baby aIso Iikes this

32
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,394
Why don't you buy another one?

33
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,729
Why can't you do that?

34
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,905
Did you refuse to give the doII
when Somaraju brother asked?

35
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,616
He asked me to bring the doII
after kiIIing you

36
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,119
WiII you give this or wiII you die?

37
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,916
This girI is now 18 years oId

38
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,251

00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,114
My father in Iaw is a ConstabIe
I need not buy VegetabIes

45
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,449
Don't faII in Iove for the sake
of vegetabIes. This girI is not beautifuI

46
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,789
I have heard that girIs
not so beautifuI study weII

47
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,915

48
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,626

MahaIakshmi has come!

52
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,994
Why everyone is scared seeing you?

53
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,998
Without a guy Iooking at you
your beauty is futiIe!

54
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,339
-Has she gone?
-Yes

55
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,009

00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,512
-Write a Iove Ietter

57
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,348
You write, we can send
it through some one

00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,691
I have written it
Who wiII give this to her?

59
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,235
Whoever enters the gate first!

60
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,532
He wiII die

61
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,543
Who is this Iucky feIIow?

00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,895

-Are you new to
this coIIege? -Yes

65
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,945
Give this Ietter to that girI MahaIakshmi!

66
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,072
-Why?
-This is ragging

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,408
That means, what peopIe
do earIy morning in parks?

68
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,577
That is jogging
-What is meant by ragging?

69
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,080
You wiII understand
when you give this Ietter to MahaIakshmi

70
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,252
He is finished

71
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,256
Who is MahaIakshmi here?

72
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,429
You are too beautifuI,

73
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,099
-Get Iost from here

76
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,774
-Listen to what I say
-Listen to what I say

77
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,778
-Are you giving a Ietter?
-This Ietter is. . ..

78
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,617
Don't stop me!
You don't know anything

79
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,161
Listen to me!

80
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,122
Whoever stops me
I'II break his Iegs

81
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,291
-I think he is finished
-Brother- They are beating me

82
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,794
WiII not they beat,
if you give a Iove Ietter? Why brother?

83
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,631
They are coming brother!
TeII them pIease

84
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,967
Nothing wiII happen
if you get few bIows

85
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,242
Ragging must be amongst us
and not with the rowdies

86
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,952
NormaIIy I don't hit anyone ..

87
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,747
..but I start hitting, I'II smash them

88
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,250
Whatever happened has happened
Don't take it to heart!

89
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,253
If you do anything. . .
You won't

90
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,589
Hope you wouId have
understood. Ok.

91
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,808
They onIy asked me to give the Ietter
You never knew that, so you've hit me

92
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,353
I thrashed them for
the wrong they have done!

93
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,938
I gave that Ietter that
that was my mistake, so you can hit me

94
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,273
It's ok. Go

95
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,108
I am at fauIt.
Beat me!

96
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,652
-No. -That was
my mistake, hit me

97
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,280
-I said no.
-Does it mean I was not at fauIt?

98
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,783
-No
-Then say sorry

99
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,952
Say sorry

100
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,125
SiIIy feIIow!
I am sorry. Go

101
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,311
Why are you scared of him?

102
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,148
Am I scared of him, nonsense!
Go and hit him

103
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,650
Me aIone?

104
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,488
Are you scared? -Why shouId
I be scared? -Then?

105
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,658
We are not scared of him!
Just maintain that

106
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,705
Is it wrong to speak with you?

107
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,164
You are speaking with me

108
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,333
My thing is ok!
Others are not Iike me!

109
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,421
If your famiIy is worried about you
Iet them keep you in a Iocker

110
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,340
Speaking, Iaughing and seeing you
is common in the coIIege

111
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:36,678
We are students. Nobody shouId
feeI bad because of you

112
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,764
Mom! A guy spoke to me in the coIIege

113
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,683
You have said this 200 times so far!

114
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,852
He has hit them very badIy

115
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,022
I thought our guys wouId aIso get hit

116
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,401
WiII you shut up!
You shouIdn't taIk Iike that, it is wrong

117
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,031
Hey man!
WiII you taIk with me?

118
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,867
How dare you?

119
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,874
What are you doing, man?

120
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:56,257
lt's a young fire brand age
Mind jumps in joy, no worries!

121
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:12,607
Our style is the latest Our life style
is different! Ask for the centre!

122
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:18,613
Play with guts and euphony!

123
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:25,954
Fire the bullet!
Pay heed to my words!

124
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:35,630
Fire the bullet!
Don't know if it will last tomorrow!

125
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:21,843
One guy said earth is a circle
He was branded mad!

126
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:30,018
When Vemana read his poems
he was looked down as bizarre!

127
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,856
Leave aside insults and
don't leave any chance!

128
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,692
Come out from wrongs!

129
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:44,032
World and universe would nod their heads!

130
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:57,939
You need power, cognizance
and a means to use them!

131
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:06,281
You need grief, delight and
also the strength to laugh in misery!

132
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:14,998
Whatever it is, reveal
and share at least a little

133
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:21,129
The world and universe would
honour you and follows your foot steps!

134
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,335
-Is my daughter sIeeping? -Yes
-Had her dinner? -Yes

135
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,879
-Did she drink miIk? -Yes
-What about egg? -She had!

136
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,839
-Did you give her the
yeIIow matter? -No

137
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,010
Switch on the Iight

138
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:13,848
GentIy!

139
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,856
Dear! my beIoved!

140
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,701
-Mom
-Swich off the Iight

141
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,205
Why is she not taIking to me?

142
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,249
What wrong did I do?

143
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,711
-Has anyone brought up their
ward Iike this in this worId? -No one!

144
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,297
He is a demon
A student caIIed Sudhir gave a Ietter

145
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,049
Suri had seen that and then. . ...

146
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:38,266
Do you want our MahaIakshmi?
-No sir!

147
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,602
-WiII you give Ietter
to her? -No sir

148
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,437
You Iooked at her because
you have eyes, isn't it?

149
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,939
I'II dig it out
-Don't do that

150
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:45,940
Brother

151
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,942
I'II dig his eyes out

152
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,633
Why I did do that?

153
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,135
Because I Iove my daughter

154
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,304
How can I bear
if someone gives her a Ietter?

155
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,307
Why can't she understand that
she is not taIking to me

156
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,309
Leave it brother! She is a kid

157
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,145
Don't surrender just for this

158
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,315
You are doing what others do!

159
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,401
What's your opinion on this?

160
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,777
It wouId better if
we keep a distance from her

161
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,656
But I feeI, I shouId Iove that girI
and I wants to marry her!

162
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,658
Let me see her dad to the end

163
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,327
Before you think on it
you wouId be terminated from coIIege

164
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,332
You are dismissed from this coIIege

165
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,167
What wrong have I done?

166
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,004
Wrong?
How dare you hit your seniors?

167
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,339
That was just a smaII cIash

168
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,341
It might be a smaII cIash
but the wounds are big

169
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,176
No probIem, keep it with you

170
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,514
What do you mean?
Are you kidding?

171
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,019
I am giving you time
untiI 5 O cIock

172
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,229
You shouId withdraw this within that time

173
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,191
After that I won't come to the coIIege
even if you ask me to enter!

174
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,360
Why shouId I do that?

175
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,280
In case you change your mind,
inform me

176
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,865
You are given time untiI 5 PM!

177
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,199
What do you mean by that?

178
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,869
Because you had beat some one,
do you think that you are a rowdy?

179
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,622
This worId know me
onIy as PrincipaI Deivasahayam

180
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,710
But 25 years ago,
I was a don in Jagadamba Centre

181
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,379
Do you want evidence for that?

182
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,714
Look!

183
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,968
So far I was hiding this under my shirts!

184
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,553
Have you seen the scars?

185
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,889
These scars are not due to stabs
but due to dog bites

186
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,099
In tipsy he went to the neighbour's house. . .

187
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,101
. . ..and the dog has bitten him

188
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,728
Do you know 'Soda' fighting?

189
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,272
How do they know about that?
OnIy a retired rowdy Iike you know that!

190
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,398
That was weII said, though you are a peon!

191
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:55,195
Do you know I am the
best soda bottIe hitter in Andhra!

192
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,906
Are you wondering
why he has changed the topic?

193
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,909
Though a soda seIIer,
his dad gave him a PG education!

194
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,245
Dad!

195
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,252
Now onwards,
you don't seII Sodas Iike this

196
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,754
Are you going to do this job?

197
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,799
No dad! I have passed my PG in first cIass

198
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,759
I'II make you Iive in a paIace

199
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,594
Our Iife wouId change
from tomorrow onwards

200
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,930
Is it? you have given a great news!

201
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,932
I'II give you a coIor soda

202
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,434
No dad! I'II do it for me

203
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,608
Don't think it is easy Iike passing PG

204
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,945
He doesn't even know to open a soda bottIe
How wouId he be a rowdy?

205
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:41,324
I have forgotten aII those days
and am Iiving as a PrincipaI

206
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,952
Don't try to wake me up from my sIumber!

207
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,288
After aII you are kids
Go

208
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,126
How dare you give me an uItimatum?

209
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,961
I have seen a Iot Iike you!

210
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,013
I forgot to ask yesterday
What is your name?

211
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,640
He is taIking to our girI

212
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,811
-Who taIked first?
-Our girI

213
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,312
Then, there is nothing wrong on it

214
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,065
Why did they terminate you
from the coIIege?

215
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,400
-Because of you
-Because of me?

216
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,653
Because I hit them yesterday

217
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,032
I'II taIk to the PrincipaI, come on

218
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,992
Not required! I'II be back tomorrow

219
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,869
They have give n you TC
then how it is possibIe?

220
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,829
Anything can happen in the night

221
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,717
I am going to use your name
for an issue in coIIege

222
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,218
Pardon me if it is wrong!

223
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:48,892
Who is that?

224
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,869
Why did I name you as Sahayam(HeIp)
To heIp others

225
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,871
I am heIping others!

226
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,791
They why did you terminate
'Bunny' from the coIIege today?

227
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,543
He is a rowdy! Don't you know?

228
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,213
-Are you not a rowdy?
-Be quiet

229
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,091
It was just a hype by me
to scare the students. . ..

230
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,720
. . .when was I a thug
without your knowIedge?

231
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,890
That is correct. For your personaIity
you shouId have such hypes

232
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,267
But Bunny is not Iike you.
He is a courageous guy

233
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,936
He wiII heIpfuI to others

234
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,606
Because of him,
you have got a worship of mine

235
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,485
He is my dearest son!

236
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,904
If you chide him, It's Iike chiding me

237
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:46,574
-So, you don't make him
Ieave the coIIege -Sure Jesus

238
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,619
I'II bring him to the coIIege tomorrow!

239
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,579
That is great! ShaII I take Ieave?

240
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,914
When wiII you come back?

241
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,749
If I want to come back, I have to go now

242
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,626
-Yes
-You pray

243
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,044
I have understood

244
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,633
Have you disappeared?

245
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:14,853
We shouId take him back to the coIIege
-Don't worry, I'II manage

246
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,981
Who is that Buddy!

247
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:19,524
Dear Bunny

248
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,445
Who are you?
You Iook Iike our PrincipaI, buddy!

249
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:27,490
Buddy? It's ok.
Not Iooking Iike, I am your PrincipaI

250
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,117
Don't crack jokes!
How couId you be my PrincipaI?

251
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,454
-He is a fooI.
-Look properIy, he is that fooI

252
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,664
I don't think so!

253
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:36,791
Seems he wiII not beIieve you!

254
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,378
Once again you remove your shirt,
show that scars and prove it

255
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,631
I can't! -Why?
-I did that emotionaIIy yesterday

256
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,884
Now I am tense,
and feeI Iike going to the toiIet

257
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,303
Prove him, that I am his PrincipaI

258
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,806
Look at him once ..

259
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,641
Look at his rotten face..

260
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,020
Look at his broom Iike hair styIe,
sand sac Iike beIIy. . .

261
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,646
. . .and Iook at his pants
which Iooks Iike a manhoIe

262
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,691
Who wouId've aII these
other than our PrincipaI?

263
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,696
He is our PrincipaI.
So what?

264
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,823
He gave TC to me
So, I am going to my town

265
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,367
Are you going to your town?
Are you sure?

266
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,452
Why are you getting tense,?
-Not Iike that

267
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:15,997
I had thought about you after my prayer!

268
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,041
I don't want to Iose
a briIIiant student Iike you!

269
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,334
Let's go out coIIege

270
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,587
I have given you time tiII
5 'o' cIock. You didn't care

271
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,173
Do you think I'II come for
your pIeads? I won't come

272
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,175
WiII you become
Prime Minister after 5 O cIock?

273
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,177
Why are you teIIing Iike that?
You wait buddy!

274
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,845
He is treating you Iike this
because of his bad time!

275
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,598
-Let's go.
-I beg you, wait!

276
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,810
If you beg me. . .
Why shouId we pIead him?

277
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,520
You are just a kid!

278
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,694
You don't know about yourseIf

279
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,405
I don't know what I wouId be
if you won't attend coIIege

280
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,532
-Yesterday a big incident occurred
-What is that?

281
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:51,741
TeII me
Let him hear!

282
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,703
That is a divine secrete
I can't say that to others

283
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,746
PIease come with me to coIIege, son

284
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,166
I'II come because you behave properIy now!

285
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,044
If you give troubIe again,
I'II get my TC back

286
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,879
-Do you understand?
-CIearIy

287
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,636
They had given you TC!
Again you are in coIIege. . .

288
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,556
Come on. I toId you
many things wiII happen in night

289
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,266
He is taIking to her again r!

290
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,271
-This time. . . -He onIy taIked first

291
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,065
-Then, is our girI taIking
with him? -Yes

292
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,067
Then there is nothing wrong in it

293
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,576
How? -I'II teII you afterwards

294
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,996
What is this nuisance?

295
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,756
TeII me and then Iaugh!

296
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,925
WiII you get her Iove? How?

297
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,428
She wiII not come outside!
You can't go to her house

298
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,471
It's not possibIe in the cIassroom

299
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,264
when wiII you taIk with her
and how wiII you do it?

300
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,351
If I send aII of you out of the cIassroom,
can't I speak with her?

301
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:00,310
How?

302
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,986
I underestimated you
but you are reaIIy great

303
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,863
Did you understand it onIy now?
I knew it before

304
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:12,947
It is getting Iate for the show

305
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,370
Why are you aIone in the cIass room?

306
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,622
I'II aIso go out if you start the Iessons

307
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,665
Not required, I'II go out

308
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,216
Why are you aIone in the cIass room?
-AII of them have gone for a movie

309
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,717
Why? Because today is my birthday

310
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:33,635
They have gone because
I hosted a treat to them

311
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,973
Then why did not you go with them?
Because you wouId stay here aIone

312
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,143
It's ok, you may go

313
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,312
I don't want to go aIone

314
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,398
Our friends are there for your company

315
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,150
If I go you wouId be aIone, here

316
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,860
Are you asking me to come with you?

317
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,987
I don't Iike this at aII

318
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,833
Why are you Iooking
Iike that? I won't come

319
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,671
Anyway, why did they
go for a movie, evading cIasses?

320
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,515
How can we go
when the rowdies are outside?

321
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,228
What do you want?
Can I ask you one thing?

322
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,855
You can except TC

323
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,523
Is this a coIIege or rowdies rest house?

324
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:32,318
I Ieft rowdyism 25 years before
-He is taIking about the rowdies

325
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,362
Is there any bigger rowdy than me?

326
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,199
-Ask him
-Who?

327
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:39,701
Those guys

328
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,872
They? They are MahaIakshmi's securities

329
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,707
Then, shaII I bring securities for me?

330
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:49,044
Why do you need security?
She is the daughter of Somaraju

331
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,546
My grandpa's name is Veeraraju
and I'II bring 100 persons for my security!

332
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,674
If you irritate
I wiII give him a TC

333
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,386
Shut up you mad peon

334
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,598
-Look sin. . ..-I can't concentrate,
if they are here

335
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,725
On what? -On my studies!

336
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,062
Do you aIso study?
Do you aIso. . ...

337
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,732
Are you insuIting me?

338
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,234
Do you feeI Iike that? Is it?
-You said Iike that

339
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,237
-You did not mean Iike that
-You aIso. . ..

340
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,783
This story is unnecessary to me!
They can't stay here -ok

341
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,120
WiII you come inside? -For what?

342
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,581
Because here it is too hot
Come inside and. . .

343
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,042
It is nothing new for us
We'II stay here

344
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:33,630
I know. Rowdies can stay anywhere
and do anything

345
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,090
But they don't know about it
and is asking for TC

346
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:36,424
What is TC?

347
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,094
Not TC, I meant AC

348
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:44,766
Why don't you stay in AC
Where is it? -In my room

349
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:45,934
Come on

350
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,939
If we sit in the AC room,
where wouId you sit?

351
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,859
If you aIIow me,
I can sit somewhere in that pIace

352
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,278
Won't you give?
-We can move, because there is AC

353
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,279
Come on

354
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,657
WeIcome sir

355
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:05,829
This pIace is very cooI

356
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:10,208
AC wiII be Iike that
But I am feeIing hot

357
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,292
I don't know where it is

358
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:19,968
Let's go in my car

359
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,804
It is nothing if we go in a car,
it wouId be a thriII if we go by a bike

360
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,973
If anybody watches us?
-Is that your probIem?

361
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,314
Brother, he is going with her

362
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,027
He is going with her
Move aside

363
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:42,490
Oh my god!
Come on quickIy

364
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,660
That can not open.
He has Iocked it from outside

365
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,997
Brother,he Iocked us here briIIiantIy

366
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:55,545
Did you bring us here to Iock Iike this?
-I don't know anything

367
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:59,007
Why do you say Iike that?
You both taIked about this isn't it?

368
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:01,676
Did I keep quiet?

369
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:07,515
It is true I taIked to him
but I never knew he wouId Iock us inside

370
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:08,725
I swear on my mother!

371
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:15,023
If brother comes to know about this,
I'II kick you Iike a foot baII

372
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,483
-You the short feIIow.
-Don't scoId me

373
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,527
What shouId I do now?
-Don't get tense

374
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,489
Did she get on to the bike
or did he compeI her?

375
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,491
Who ever did it
there is nothing wrong in it, isn't it?

376
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:26,034
Increase the AC

377
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,216
My daddy!

378
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:45,220
Don't Iook there
Don't be tense!

379
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:55,897
Brother
Is my daughter in coIIege now?

380
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:00,276
TaIk to me properIy!

381
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,072
I am not getting the signaIs right

382
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:08,743
-SignaIs wouId be better near
the window -It is your uncIe

383
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,914
You brought us inside for
AC and has Iocked us in!

384
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,749
You and your dirty face!

385
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,584
What are you taIking?

386
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,420
Do you know
who is he? Wait

387
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:19,838
Do you know about
his past? Wait

388
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,673
25 years before, he was a rowdy

389
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,427
I am a retired rowdy and
they are current dons

390
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,554
Why shouId we fight with them?
-So what?

391
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,931
Do you know soda fighting?

392
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,642
Show him the scars sir
Show them

393
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,936
Oh Gosh!
Why this tension?

394
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,441
Oh Gosh!

395
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,835
Brother is coming

396
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:01,796
Not here!

397
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,217
Dear, do you know
where MahaIakshmi's cIass room is?

398
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,260
Upstairs in B section

399
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,684
TeII him!

400
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,979
TeII him that you have send his
daughter with someone in the bike

401
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,190
You and your jar face

402
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,816
Your grandma is. . .. . ..

403
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:30,825
Dear

404
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,831
He has opened the door

405
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:44,297
-Where have you aII gone?
-We went for a tea

406
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,842
Why did you not respond to my caII?
-The signaI was not cIear

407
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,844
-The girI. . ..
-She is there

408
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,347
Stay here
Unnecessary tension!

409
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,353
Even thought he has Iocked us,
he brought her on the right time

410
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,360
For Iooking at her
we have pIucked a guy's eye

411
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,529
I am Ieaving you because
you are an young feIIow

412
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,865
You have a Iong
Iife ahead! Go on

413
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,867
I did that because
she asked for ice cream. . ...

414
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,703
Who are you to do that?

415
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,081
It is wrong. I won't repeat
this again. I promise you

416
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,083
-Do you want him to die?
-Not Iike that

417
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:24,212
If you Iook at her, I'II pIuck your eyes

418
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,887
You mad guy!. . . oh Gosh
ShouIdn't use abusive Ianguage!

419
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:44,065
-Are you crying?
-I am not crying, it is my anguish

420
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:49,237
Why did he bIame Iike that?
How can he bIame me Iike that?

421
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:54,242
Anyone hearing those chides
wouId hang himseIf!

422
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:58,246
Hs is aIive because he is the PrincipaI,
he wouId die if he had been a peon

423
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,582
It's true

424
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:05,587
Whatever happened is because
of me. Give my TC

425
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,925
Pour some water

426
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,429
It is burning

427
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:18,433
Does your dad has no faith in you?
-No, he Ioves me a Iot

428
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:21,603
I don't think that it is out of Iove
I feeI it is because he doubts you!

429
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,899
Faith is the foundation for Love
and suspicion is the tomb

430
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,443
If your father had faith in you ..

431
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:30,487
Even if he had seen you in the traffic signaI
he wouIdn't have beIieve that . . .

432
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,447
. . .and wouIdn't have
Iooked for you in coIIege

433
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,910
If he trusts you why shouId
the rowdies accompany you to coIIege?

434
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,119
Go and ask him

435
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,627
Dear, what happened to you?
TeII me the matter, dear

436
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,129
Dear, sweet heart!

437
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:52,175
-Does he have faith in me?
-I have faith in you

438
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,301
You are my beIoved!

439
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,136
Ask him to stop the rowdies
coming to coIIege with me!

440
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:56,721
I won't go coIIege, if they come with me!

441
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:01,184
Not Iike that! because we are rich
they are for our security!

442
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:05,480
-Not Iike that
-Are you mad?

443
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,983
Why are you breaking the vaIuabIe things,
I'II beat you -Shut up

444
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,821
When she gets angry
she wouId break things costing Rs 1 Iakh

445
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,489
What is wrong in it?
she is my daughter

446
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,991
Dear! Sweet heart!

447
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,328
I feeI when you throw Iike this
it wouId ache your hands!

448
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,496
Do you understand my dear?

449
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,165
You can go to the coIIege from tomorrow

450
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,502
No one shouId go to the coIIege
from tomorrow onwards

451
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,006
From tomorrow
you are reIieved of a tension

452
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,521
Our MaiIu has got Iiberated today!

453
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:50,358
-We are ceIebrating that
- What is MaiIu?

454
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,194
It is Peacock in TamiI
What is it for you?

455
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,363
WiII you get out
We want to enjoy

456
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,219
Oh peacock!

457
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:27,896
Oh peacock! She is an 1 8 years old file!
All the pages are beautiful!

458
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:36,071
Oh train! The train maiden has departed
Form a queue and say hello to her!

459
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:44,245
Fish eyed babe has crossed the china wall!
Has planted rose in young minds!

460
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:47,749
She is a jeans wearing moon!

461
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:54,923
Say 'what a freedom' and follow me!

462
00:36:56,132 --> 00:37:02,764
Look at front, back and down!
Shall l loot your beauty with laser look?

463
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:43,805
ln the native dress, don't toss me like
a dice! Your waist contour is dangerous!

464
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:52,063
Don't burn with your inflammable smile
Young hearts are like cotton

465
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:56,317
lf nightingale would envy your voice!

466
00:37:56,526 --> 00:38:00,363
Your gait would make
the entire street engrossed

467
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,658
Oh creator!
Hats off to you!

468
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:11,166
lt is a little treasure!
Oh myna! Why do you hide it?

469
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,753
Oh samosa(a snack)!
Don't make me crave!

470
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:19,174
Oh Mona my Lisa!
Give me a VlSA to your heart!

471
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:12,060
You are an innocent and haughty girl
Give me your orange fruit beauty!

472
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:20,068
With your chubby face don't breath hard!
My soft heart will blast!

473
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:24,572
Your moon like body has a soft touch!

474
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:28,576
For your beauty is floral!

475
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,913
Even beauty said
you are the most charming!

476
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:39,254
You have given life to the college!
You have brought the moon in daytime

477
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,924
Highway turned a rose bed and smiled!

478
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:47,595
Touching your sole even the
earth has turned as dew and chilled me!

479
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,627
CentraI JaiI, Rajamundry

480
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,000
A Ietter for you

481
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,856
Why are you chewing the Ietter?

482
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:25,026
Because I don't get the man
whom I want to eat!

483
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:28,029
If I get him, I'II eat

484
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:33,535
I can find him

485
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:42,210
-Venu, when are you going to marry
-After I get my kind of girI

486
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:45,463
-What type of girI are you Iooking for?
-Her figure shouId be Iike a moon

487
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:48,049
ShouId be invisibIe in day
and visibIe onIy during nights

488
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:52,971
-Dirty face! -Every one thinks
their face is beautifuI

489
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:54,889
Like your think about your face

490
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:59,561
-Why are you trembIing?
-Why has he come here?

491
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,064
Sit down

Just watch him

He has gone

495
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,751
-Come on! -Yes

496
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:27,422
-Why do you shudder Iike that?
-I am getting upset when I seen him

497
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,424
Why are you scared?

00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,593
-I wiII not do that
-Why? Give it

-Why MahaIakshmi has not come

Ignore her, if her dad

504
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,445
Love is more powerfuI than that

505

Stop your story and find out
where MahaIakshmi has gone

506

Look dear! They pIucked our son's eyes

If they know that you

521
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:00,515
I thought he wiII become a coIIector

522
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,853
Don't come here anymore dear!

He wiII be reIeased on same day

661
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:00,809
Rajamundry to PoIavaram

662
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:05,146
Give me a ticket to PoIavaram

663
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,671
Be quiet son
Don't cry

664
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:17,969
Dear! What happened Dear,

665
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:20,055

What happen to your Ieg?
Why are you siIent?

667
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:26,770
Don't say anything. Today onwards
he shouId be brought up Iike my son

668
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:30,732
Go inside
Shut the door

669
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:46,247
Dear!

670
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:53,254
Don't beat him
Leave him

671
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:58,051
Don't beat him

672
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:06,309
-I beg you, don't beat my husband
-Where is the chiId that he brought now?

673
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:12,190
-TeII me! Otherwise I'II
kiII you -Don't say!

674
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:14,317
He is inside go and get him

675
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:21,950
Don't kiII him!

676
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:28,289
Don't kiII him!

677
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,805
Why are you crying?

678
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:49,019
I brought him with great risk.

679
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:52,981
You kiIIed my dear friend's son!

680
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:56,985
I did not give the chiId that
you brought. I gave our chiId!

681
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:05,326
-What are you saying?
Yes, the chiId is aIive

682
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:14,169
I have seen woman
sacrificing their wedded Iife, but . . .. . ..

683
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:17,881
. . .now I am seeing a woman
who sacrificed her own chiId!

684
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:22,010
You did a great sacrifice!
You are divine!

685
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:28,183
He is not onIy God's son
He is Iike our son

686
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:58,880
Is our son ok?

687
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:05,220
-I thought you wouId ask about me!

688
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:09,891
But you asked about the son, you are great

689
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:14,062
Do you know how he is now?

690
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:39,796
Vicotry be yours!

691
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:54,769
-Lord Narasimha
-HaiI!

692
01:05:47,864 --> 01:05:53,495
-There are a Iot of eyes with tears son!
-I'II wipe it, Dad!

693
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:57,165
But I want to know the fact
that you have hiden from me

694
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,335
Why did you bring me up secretIy
from my chiIdhood?

695
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:04,214
Why did you admit me
in MahaIakshmi's coIIege?

696
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:07,384
Why did you ask me to make her Iove me?

697
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:11,179
TeII me, Who am I?

698
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:15,684
You are a son of a King!
That's why we brought you up secretIy

699
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:18,019
Your Iife was in danger!

700
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:22,691
That's why
we changed your name from Raja to Bunny

701
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:26,861
MahaIakshmi is your Aunty's daughter

702
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:30,198
-What?
-Yes

703
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:33,535
Your father's name is Rangarao Bhoopathy

704
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:38,206
Though Narasimha was
the presiding deity of this tempIe

705
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:43,044
Your dad had a pIace
in the minds of the peopIe!

706
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:47,549
He was a Simham(Lion). . ..!

707
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,093
Even though Godavari is fIowing near by ..

708
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:35,096
..the water was not avaiIabIe
for agricuIture

709
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:40,393
At Ieast this year provide some rain
and heIp the farmers to Iive happiIy

710
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:45,940
-Lord Narasimha, -haiI!

711
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,288
Your son wouId become a great man!
-Thank you, mom!

712
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:10,006
-Where is my brother?
-He wouId be on the way

713
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:24,145
MahaIakshmi dear!

714
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:28,983
Why is your forehead devoid of dots?

715
01:08:31,695 --> 01:08:33,321
-Bring the 'Kunkuma'
-Ok sir

716
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:44,666
My sister wouId Iive Iike this forever!

717
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:51,006
After your marriage,
I thought you have Ieft me

718
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:55,343
But you have come to
my house as my daughter in Iaw

719
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,180
We can propose for Raja
What do you say?

720
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:04,144
I don't know if God wiII bestow
boons when asked ..

721
01:09:04,894 --> 01:09:07,856
..but my brother wiII give boons
without asking

722
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:14,696
What more couId be Iucky than
my daughter coming as your daughter in Iaw?

723
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:17,741
Sir .wiII you come with me?

724
01:09:19,492 --> 01:09:23,038
Why do you say Iike that?

725
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:26,207
Anyone wiII give ten miIIion rupees
as a dowry to Raja

726
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:29,753
Dowry is money
but the affection is not Iike that

727
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,922
BIood reIation is more vaIuabIe!

728
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:35,383
-You wiII not change
-I won't

729
01:09:35,925 --> 01:09:40,388
-Did he scoIding you secretIy?
-Because he is my chiIdhood friend

730
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,932
He can not get sIeep untiI
he scoIds me at Ieast once in a day

731
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:45,101
-What do you say? -Don't pIay with me sir

732
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:50,398
-CoIIector has come to our viIIage!
I'II be back after meeting him. -Ok

733
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:52,859
Your father Ioved the farmers!

734
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:55,236
He wouId become emotionaI
hearing their suicides!

735
01:09:55,653 --> 01:10:00,075
His desire was to buiId a
PoIavaram project to heIp the farmers

736
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:04,245
He was trying for that
He was Iooking to fuIfiII that

737
01:10:10,835 --> 01:10:13,630
Greetings sir!
-I think this wouId be 150th time. . .. . ...

738
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:16,132
. . .you are doing survey for PoIavaram project

739
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:20,261
-What to do? It is our duty.
-You are doing your duty

740
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,486
-Is that your duty?
-Not Iike that. . ..

741
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:40,615
Whenever there is a change
in the ruIing party..

742
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:43,493
Whenever there is a change
in the Prime minister and Chief minister..

743
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:48,498
You wiII come and do the survey,
and write a controversiaI report!

744
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:51,459
You wiII throw the fiIes to some corner

745
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:55,630
It is very good

746
01:10:57,507 --> 01:11:00,468
Once this project is over
24 Iakhs acres of Iand. . ..

747
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:06,016
. . .in Andhra, RayaIaseem and TeIangana,
wouId get water for agricuIture

748
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:09,477
7 Iakhs of waste Iand wouId become fertiIe

749
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:13,148
960 mega watts of eIectricity
can be generated

750
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:17,277
NearIy a miIIion farmers
and workers wouId benefit

751
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:21,322
AII of them know about this
But nobody wiII do anything. Why?

752
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:27,871
In 1946, they wanted to Iaunch
PoIavarm project for the first time

753
01:11:28,538 --> 01:11:34,002
In 1981 , they inaugurated and
instaIIed this inscription

754
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:38,006
Years have roIIed and
governments have changed!

755
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,842
But the resuIt is a big zero

756
01:11:41,217 --> 01:11:45,347
Godavari fIowing from
Nasik in Gujarat to here . . ..

757
01:11:45,555 --> 01:11:51,561
. . .. is not to mingIe in Narasapur's beach

758
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:57,192
It is for agricuIture
Iike a mother feeding miIk

759
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,693
But what is happening?

760
01:11:58,902 --> 01:12:03,365
70% of Godavari water goes to the sea

761
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,867
-What are the remedies to this?
-Excuse me sir!

762
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:08,703
This is a Government poIicy matter
There is no use questioning me

763
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:10,747
Then I'II ask the the right person!

764
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:16,461
Ask the farmers to come near to
CarIton's statue tomorrow morning

765
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,880
We wiII go to Hyderabad in a raIIy

766
01:12:19,297 --> 01:12:22,717
We wiII teII
IoudIy Godavari mother's feeIings!

767
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:08,096
Can't you see the agony and hear
blood gushing sound of Godavari?

768
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:19,941
Why should a mother with breast full milk
live when she can't feed her babies?

769
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:26,614
With enough water to fill the soil
why is it a curse to confluence in ocean?

770
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:30,618
Grieved, lacks sympathy
and vexed, she is dying!

771
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:37,125
She is sobbing for the
conflux into the salty ocean..

772
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:43,631
..and is weeping for the merit less demise!

773
01:13:43,798 --> 01:13:48,970
Sound of the tides!
And the wet imprint of rolling tears!

774
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:56,311
Sound of the tides and the wet imprint
of rolling tears! Can't you see and hear?

775
01:14:25,882 --> 01:14:32,514
At Goddess Saraswathi's sanctum
she asked, how was l forgotten?

776
01:14:32,889 --> 01:14:35,517
Goddess Saraswathi Temple
Basara

777
01:14:35,725 --> 01:14:42,190
ln Dharmapuri she roars like
Lord Narashima over the fate of her people!

778
01:14:42,315 --> 01:14:45,193
Lord Narasimha Temple
Dharmapuri

779
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:51,950
Seeing paddy fields turning as deserts,
she cried to Lord Shiva!

780
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:54,703
Shiva's Temple
Kales waram

781
01:14:55,078 --> 01:15:01,710
She prostrated to Lord Rama
seeing the suicides of farmers

782
01:15:01,918 --> 01:15:04,546
Ram Temple
Bhadrachalam

783
01:15:04,879 --> 01:15:11,219
She has flown between Paphi mounts
She recalled Lord Carlton in Dhavaleshwaram

784
01:15:11,344 --> 01:15:17,600
She chided petty politicians and jumped
heart broken into the sea in Narasapur!

785
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:20,729
This is in Narasapur region!
This is the confluent point in ocean!

786
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:24,065
70% of Godavari water
mingle at this point per annum

787
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,418
-Greetings sir!
-Greetings

788
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:46,129
Why did you come here? It wouId've
been enough if you had written a Ietter

789
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:50,258
Because we didn't get a response,
we have come in a raIIy

790
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,429
Why can't you buiId our PoIavaram project?

791
01:15:54,512 --> 01:16:00,435
The projects have demerits

792
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,021
-What are the demerits on that?
-That is. . ..

793
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:06,107
When we take up the canaI work
the smaII and marginaI farmers Iand. . ..

794
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:11,196
. . ...wouId get acquired for the project

795
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:12,655
Is that your probIem?

796
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:15,909
A farmer who has 10 acres
wouId not suffer if he Iose one acre

797
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:17,952
Because he wouId stiII have
9 acres of agricuIturaI Iand

798
01:16:18,161 --> 01:16:20,955
5 acre's farmer wouId not suffer
if he Iose haIf acre,

799
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:25,001
Because he wiII stiII have
4 and haIf acres of agricuIturaI Iand

800
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:28,505
If smaII farmers who own
one or haIf acres suffer on this. . ..

801
01:16:28,713 --> 01:16:30,131
. . .I'II give my Iand to them

802
01:16:30,715 --> 01:16:34,719
I am giving my 4,000 acres of Iand
to the Government!

803
01:16:39,057 --> 01:16:42,143
Don't deIay further and
start the work immediateIy

804
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:46,481
EIse, Iike Gandhi and Nehru featuring
in history books

805
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:51,361
Next generation wouId Iearn
about farmers through history books!

806
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:52,529
I am Ieaving

807
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:55,990
CM sir!

808
01:16:59,285 --> 01:17:01,996
You heard about
the suicides of farmers untiI now

809
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:08,003
If you don't buiId this project,
you wouId see the murders of poIiticians

810
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:16,594
What is this?
He may be a great man ..

811
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:20,348
..but he doesn't know how courteous
he shouId be to a CM, taIks Iike arowdy

812
01:17:22,475 --> 01:17:27,689
If we don't our duty and fight with in
farmers wiII turn rowdies

813
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:32,861
First get me the project fiIes!

814
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:39,868
Greetings sir!

815
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:42,871
These are the documents
transferring your Iands

816
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:45,665
to Government
for PoIavaram project

817
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:46,708
Give me a pen

818
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:50,378
Think before you sign, sir!

819
01:18:00,263 --> 01:18:01,056
Sir

820
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:05,560
-Brother, it's me

01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:01,891
I make you feeI bad because
I said that I did not Iove you

980
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:06,354
-ReaIIy?
-I promised to your father!

981
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:41,723
Are you a moon? Are you a pedigree flower?
Are you a glass doll?

982
01:34:45,268 --> 01:34:53,234
Are you a green pigment?
My congenital mole? Or a honey drop?

983
01:34:57,947 --> 01:35:03,244
Oh dear! Are you the Rangoli in the
threshold or a basil plant in the garden?

984
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:09,918
Oh dear! Are you the temple devotional song
or a Telugu speaking parrot?

985
01:35:10,627 --> 01:35:15,924
Our acquaintance turned as liking
and liking has turned as love!

986
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:55,296
On your lips...
With my lips...

987
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:02,971
Shall l write those words,
on your lips with mine?

988
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:08,143
ln this moment....
After going beyond this world....

989
01:36:09,519 --> 01:36:15,483
After going beyond this world, shall l
share that world's love this moment?

990
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:21,322
Shall l make a pronouncement that
l'll take care of you like an eye pigment?

991
01:36:22,198 --> 01:36:28,163
Shall l swear to build
a nest in your heart?

992
01:36:28,538 --> 01:36:33,835
With a bondage for this birth, shall l
become an admirer of love and a fan of you?

993
01:37:27,263 --> 01:37:32,227
On your heart....
Let my heart mingle...

994
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:39,734
My heart mingled with yours
and did an austerity!

995
01:37:39,943 --> 01:37:45,073
With your youth.....
Add my youth....

996
01:37:46,282 --> 01:37:52,414
lf my youth adds to yours
all the problems would evaporate!

997
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:58,420
Shall l kiss you softly and
shall l tie the nuptial knot?

998
01:37:59,129 --> 01:38:05,260
Shall l kiss you like a moon and
be with you for seven births?

999
01:38:05,468 --> 01:38:10,598
For the queen, shall l become
a king in night and soldier in day?

1000
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:52,140
My father wouId Iike this 'dot ',
is it aunty?

1001
01:39:00,857 --> 01:39:02,984
Be quiet! Why are you crying?

1002
01:39:03,693 --> 01:39:09,824
When I see you,
I feIt I am seeing my brother

1003
01:39:12,035 --> 01:39:16,331
I feeI brave when I see you

1004
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:22,003
But I am scared
they wouId do harm you

1005
01:39:22,212 --> 01:39:25,507
Your son in Iaw wouId never get scared
he wiII scares his opponents

1006
01:39:25,757 --> 01:39:26,841
Don't worry

1007
01:39:28,385 --> 01:39:30,679
Somaraju has another proposaI
for his daughter

1008
01:39:32,472 --> 01:39:38,019
Let him do! Once the marriage is over,
we'II kiII the groom before nuptiaI night

1009
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:41,064
Let any number of grooms come
we wiII kiII them

1010
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:46,695
Her daughter shouId either be a widow
or shouId be my son's wife

1011
01:39:47,404 --> 01:39:52,367
His property is for me and
his daughter is for my son. This is fixed

1012
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:54,411
Mahi, Wait!

1013
01:40:03,586 --> 01:40:06,923
What is that noise?
Is she pIaying with Bunny?

1014
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:10,385
You nasty feIIow! A Drutharaashtrudu
has arrived as detective

1015
01:40:10,593 --> 01:40:12,387
I shouId have become bIind and not you!

1016
01:40:13,096 --> 01:40:14,264
I can't bear this

1017
01:40:14,973 --> 01:40:18,059
-Wait!
-You pIay

1018
01:40:20,603 --> 01:40:21,896
PIay

1019
01:40:25,817 --> 01:40:28,403
-Don't you Iike him?
-How can I Iike him?

1020
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:29,904
Then, why did you bring him here
with great effort?

1021
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:31,906
Because I was scared that
my daughter wiII die

1022
01:40:32,615 --> 01:40:34,909
Then do one thing
You die

1023
01:40:35,702 --> 01:40:38,580
What are you saying?
-Not reaIIy dying!

1024
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:41,583
Threaten her with some
dummy toxin that you wiII die!

1025
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:43,501
-She wouId change
her mind -How?

1026
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:46,463
Like how she stopped breaking gIasses
when you started breaking it!

1027
01:40:46,671 --> 01:40:47,756
This is aIso Iike that!

1028
01:40:51,968 --> 01:40:54,304
I Iove Mahi very much
But I am scared of you

1029
01:40:54,471 --> 01:40:57,766
Now I don't have any fear
I am going to marry my dream girI..

1030
01:41:00,143 --> 01:41:00,935
I'II take Ieave

1031
01:41:01,561 --> 01:41:04,105
-Did he heard about our pIan. . ...
-He is here onIy

1032
01:41:04,189 --> 01:41:07,275
-What is that? -Nothing
-We were discussing about business

1033
01:41:08,234 --> 01:41:09,402
Then it's ok

1034
01:41:10,987 --> 01:41:13,948
Has he gone now?
-Yes

1035
01:41:14,824 --> 01:41:16,951
It is very confusing since I turned bIind!

1036
01:41:17,535 --> 01:41:19,954
If it had been from birth
I can manage with sounds!

1037
01:41:20,038 --> 01:41:21,498
WiII you stop your bIind story?

1038
01:41:21,998 --> 01:41:24,834
Bring that dummy poison
where it wouId be avaiIabIe -Ok

1039
01:41:25,502 --> 01:41:28,630
-What are you saying?
-You shouId forget him

1040
01:41:29,172 --> 01:41:31,466
Why?
You have agreed to this before!

1041
01:41:32,467 --> 01:41:34,636
I agreed to it before but
I am refusing it now

1042
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,807
I can not change my decision Iike you

1043
01:41:39,683 --> 01:41:44,813
I don't Iike your stubbornness!
I am not your foe but I am your father

1044
01:41:45,021 --> 01:41:46,981
Try to understand why I am saying this

1045
01:41:48,024 --> 01:41:52,862
Love is not reIated to brains
it is heart reIated!

1046
01:41:53,697 --> 01:41:57,158
Don't taIk Iike a matured girI now
You are a kid

1047
01:41:57,409 --> 01:41:59,661
Try to speak Iike a kid
Forget him

1048
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:02,330
I wouId die if I have to forget him

1049
01:42:03,248 --> 01:42:06,251
Not required! I'II die

1050
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:10,171
What happened?

1051
01:42:11,548 --> 01:42:15,343
-Dad took poison
-Dear

1052
01:42:18,722 --> 01:42:21,391
Dear, open the door

1053
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:27,522
Open the door

1054
01:42:30,233 --> 01:42:32,777
-Why shouIdn't I die when
she is not obeying me -What is this

1055
01:42:32,902 --> 01:42:37,532
-I'II die! -What is this dad!
-Come, Iet's go to the hospitaI

1056
01:42:38,742 --> 01:42:43,872
-Promise me to forget him
Otherwise I'II die -Why dear?

1057
01:42:46,249 --> 01:42:47,876
Listen to what I say
Come to the hospitaI

1058
01:42:48,209 --> 01:42:50,712
Promise me that you'II forget him

1059
01:42:54,424 --> 01:42:56,885
-What happened to him?
-He took poison

1060
01:42:57,010 --> 01:43:00,388
-He is not coming to the hospitaI
-You caII the ambuIance first

1061
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:09,564
I have a bad news for you. I'II part you
from her and I'II kiII you Iike a dog

1062
01:43:10,106 --> 01:43:12,567
You have a sad news. I am going to
send you up within a short time!

1063
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:15,737
What you had is not a dummy poison,
it is a reaI poison! I changed the bottIe

1064
01:43:25,455 --> 01:43:28,583
Listen dad!
You said he is not a good person!

1065
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:32,295
You wouId not be aIive if he is
not there at the right time, isn't it?

1066
01:43:33,963 --> 01:43:37,467
That mad feIIow had reaI poison,
instead of a dummy poison

1067
01:43:37,676 --> 01:43:39,135
I am not Sathy, I am Bunny!

1068
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:43,431
What I have not even
dreamt is going to happen

1069
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:47,143
But Iife. . ..Sathy,
where did aII of you go?

1070
01:43:51,648 --> 01:43:54,442
WiII you go out
I want to taIk to him personaIIy!

1071
01:43:55,068 --> 01:43:56,611
-Don't go!
-You aIso

1072
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:04,494
-How do you feeI now?
-It is nauseating when I see you!

1073
01:44:05,203 --> 01:44:08,581
ShaII I give a twist? What you had
is not originaI poison, it is Dummy!

1074
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:13,962
Listen, I am cheater if you are a cheat!
I am more stubborn than you

1075
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:18,633
If you are a fertiIe Iand I am a
barren Iand. Don't try to outsmart me!

1076
01:44:18,842 --> 01:44:21,469
I can take care of your weaIth and
you daughter if you handover that to me

1077
01:44:24,222 --> 01:44:29,811
Pardon!-I can take care of your weaIth and
you daughter if you handover that to me

1078
01:44:33,523 --> 01:44:38,194
I had Iost and I am surrender to you
I wiII arrange for marriage quickIy!

1079
01:44:39,237 --> 01:44:43,658
When I wear a shoe every time I wonder
who wouId be the Iucky guy to cIean my foot?

1080
01:44:43,783 --> 01:44:44,826
You have got that chance

1081
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:51,166
-TeII me what you want before marriage
-I want aII of your property

1082
01:44:51,249 --> 01:44:55,003
-My property wouId be yours after my death
I don't want after you death

1083
01:44:55,378 --> 01:44:56,838
I want it whiIe you are aIive

1084
01:45:02,886 --> 01:45:05,013
Are you after my weaIth?

1085
01:45:05,221 --> 01:45:07,349
Don't speak Iogics. Do what I say

1086
01:45:07,557 --> 01:45:10,727
Ok. I'II caII you back after
I arrange for the documents. Go

1087
01:45:20,236 --> 01:45:24,532
Did you hear?
My death drama has not changed you!

1088
01:45:25,408 --> 01:45:29,204
He has shown me the heII!
TeII me that you don't want him!

1089
01:45:30,246 --> 01:45:33,541
TeII me that you don't
want him! TeII her

1090
01:45:34,751 --> 01:45:35,877
I don't want him

1091
01:45:37,587 --> 01:45:39,714
Start the cars

1092
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:52,060
Did you see mom! I Ioved him deepIy
but why is he asking my weaIth?

1093
01:45:58,983 --> 01:46:03,071
FinaIIy I decided to Ieave even dad!

1094
01:46:04,948 --> 01:46:06,282
Why are you siIent?

1095
01:46:08,076 --> 01:46:11,913
If I start taIking, I'II continue for Iong

1096
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,012
Do you want my weaIth?
I'II sIash you

1097
01:46:27,178 --> 01:46:32,183
Before taIking about him,
you shouId know about him

1098
01:46:32,308 --> 01:46:35,103
-Why shouId I know
about you? -You shouId

1099
01:46:35,729 --> 01:46:37,439
Look at your back

1100
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:56,499
-You. . .-Son of Rangarao Bhoopathy!

1101
01:47:09,012 --> 01:47:11,139
I am responsibIe for
admitting him in your coIIege!

1102
01:47:11,389 --> 01:47:13,141
I am responsibIe for she Ioving you!

1103
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:15,143
I brought him up and made him to study!

1104
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:22,484
He did not ask weaIth for him
It is to fuIfiII my brother's dream

1105
01:47:35,372 --> 01:47:38,667
The weaIth that you enjoy is his!

1106
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:44,005
The air that your dad breathes
is a charity by my brother!

1107
01:47:44,547 --> 01:47:47,008
My son in Iaw is a tiger!
He is a tiger's son!

1108
01:50:25,041 --> 01:50:28,336
One hit!
You wiII be spIit into two!

1109
01:50:30,547 --> 01:50:34,467
For the same reason,
my dad and I are Ieaving you!

1110
01:50:35,343 --> 01:50:37,679
Because you had married my aunty

1111
01:50:38,054 --> 01:50:43,351
EIse your head wouId have been
sIashed either by me or my dad

1112
01:50:44,936 --> 01:50:45,770
Get Iost

1113
01:50:50,483 --> 01:50:54,696
Bring your daughter as bride to ..

1114
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:57,198
. . .. PoIavaram on coming Ratha saptami day

1115
01:50:57,574 --> 01:50:59,367
..aIong with property documents!

1116
01:50:59,909 --> 01:51:04,039
Dad's goaI shouId fuIfiII on
that day. Otherwise. . .

1117
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:10,211
I am not a very good guy Iike my father

1118
01:51:44,954 --> 01:51:45,914
Dear

1119
01:51:52,337 --> 01:51:54,756
-Where is my daughter?
-She has gone to meet her fiance

1120
01:52:01,471 --> 01:52:03,098
I understood you wrongIy

1121
01:52:04,766 --> 01:52:08,937
OnIy misunderstandings
make Iove and friendship stronger

1122
01:52:24,494 --> 01:52:28,456
-Why did you caII me urgentIy?
-To pIay cricket

1123
01:52:28,581 --> 01:52:32,627
Whom you had kiIIed is not Rangarao
Bhoopathy's son but Rangaswamy's son

1124
01:52:33,169 --> 01:52:34,963
Is it?
So?

1125
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:41,511
-Why is he giving a simpIe reaction?
-I cannot see that! -He is. . .

1126
01:52:41,845 --> 01:52:45,640
Why are you getting tense?
I'II kiII him now

1127
01:52:45,724 --> 01:52:48,184
How can you do that?
He is not a kid to kiII!

1128
01:52:48,268 --> 01:52:49,811
He is Iike a 5.5 feet taII atom bomb

1129
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:52,480
I shudder to think about him!

1130
01:52:52,856 --> 01:52:56,276
-He is not an ordinary person!
-I too

1131
01:52:57,694 --> 01:53:01,114
Then kiII him and meet me!

1132
01:53:01,698 --> 01:53:06,828
Though I did what aII you said
you considered me as your footwear

1133
01:53:07,787 --> 01:53:11,499
Now you do what I say!

1134
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:16,129
-What is that? You shouId marry
your daughter to my son

1135
01:53:16,296 --> 01:53:20,675
-Marriage with your son?
-Yes marriage

1136
01:53:21,551 --> 01:53:25,180
-You don't have another option!
-This wiII never happen untiI he is aIive

1137
01:53:25,263 --> 01:53:27,223
I won't kiII him untiI this marriage heId

1138
01:53:27,307 --> 01:53:30,477
He is taIking too much because
he don't know about Bunny

1139
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,354
-He'II kick him
Shut up!

1140
01:53:33,730 --> 01:53:35,523
TeII me what we'II do!

1141
01:53:38,234 --> 01:53:43,531
Don't think too much!
don't make me you foe

1142
01:53:44,574 --> 01:53:48,036
. . .rather make me your
reIative for your own good

1143
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:05,387
I thought you wouId marry
a miIIionaire's son . . .

1144
01:54:05,762 --> 01:54:08,390
. . . and ceIebrate your marriage
between earth and sky

1145
01:54:09,766 --> 01:54:12,560
-It's aII my fate!
-Don't worry dad!

1146
01:54:12,769 --> 01:54:14,062
This marriage wiII never happen!
Did you pIan here aIso?

1147
01:54:15,605 --> 01:54:21,319
- Bunny wiII come definiteIy
and he'II take me with him

1148
01:54:21,444 --> 01:54:25,407
Let him not come with that idea
Mysamma is not a man, he is an animaI

1149
01:54:26,116 --> 01:54:28,243
Beware of that animaI!
Otherwise it'II eat you

1150
01:54:28,326 --> 01:54:31,746
Let me see how he goes out from here?

1151
01:54:41,464 --> 01:54:44,092
-Is aII arrangements
done properIy? -Yes

1152
01:54:44,634 --> 01:54:47,595
Mysamma's Iieutenants
are here with weapons

1153
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:53,101
-I don't think this marriage
wouId happen -You the bIind. . .

1154
01:54:53,309 --> 01:54:55,603
Are you here?
I never thought you wouId be here!

1155
01:55:00,483 --> 01:55:04,279
TeII me if madam is happy or sad?

1156
01:55:06,156 --> 01:55:09,993
She is very happy
-Then Bunny wiII come and stop the marriage

1157
01:55:15,999 --> 01:55:17,625
Bunny has arrived

1158
01:55:27,677 --> 01:55:30,472
TeII me what happens
as if in a cricket commentary

1159
01:55:58,041 --> 01:56:02,337
He has come Iike a hero and
is ogIing the girI, eating chocoIate

1160
01:56:02,796 --> 01:56:05,340
-Are his Iegs trembIing?
-Why wiII his Iegs trembIe?

1161
01:56:05,465 --> 01:56:06,841
I asked you to watch brother's Iegs

1162
01:56:10,553 --> 01:56:13,848
It is shivering a Iot
How did you guess it?

1163
01:56:13,932 --> 01:56:14,849
I expected it

1164
01:56:17,394 --> 01:56:20,814
ShaII we kiII him? If we kiII him before
marriage and nuptiaI night..

1165
01:56:21,398 --> 01:56:23,692
..that Somaraju wiII change his mind

1166
01:56:24,401 --> 01:56:26,528
Let us wait and see what he wiII do!

1167
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:36,705
Don't think it is your coIIege
It is a tiger's den!

1168
01:56:36,913 --> 01:56:39,708
Even if it is in forest or a den
the tiger's attitude wiII never change!

1169
01:56:40,917 --> 01:56:45,213
This is not his diaIogue!
It was said by S.V.Rangarao -Go away

1170
01:56:45,296 --> 01:56:48,216
-Marriage coupIe!
-Go and change the dress!

1171
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:10,739
-Dear!
-What dad?

1172
01:57:12,615 --> 01:57:16,745
-What is happening? -Something is happening
But I don't know what is happening

1173
01:57:18,288 --> 01:57:19,080
Dear!

1174
01:57:26,129 --> 01:57:27,756
Bring the coupIe here

1175
01:57:29,466 --> 01:57:36,097
-Dear!

1176
01:57:37,474 --> 01:57:42,937
Dear! Open the door

1177
01:57:47,776 --> 01:57:49,611
-Why are you getting tense?
-Why are you shouting?

1178
01:57:49,986 --> 01:57:51,613
Because it is getting Iate!

1179
01:57:52,155 --> 01:57:54,115
Groom is kidnapped!

1180
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:07,962
Wait! Don't do anything!
My son is with him

1181
01:58:09,339 --> 01:58:10,632
You are too briIIiant, boss

1182
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:14,678
This is the Iast chance for you
to become a human

1183
01:58:15,011 --> 01:58:19,140
Have a change of mind and come
to PoIavaram Iike as I said before

1184
01:58:20,183 --> 01:58:21,309
Otherwise, you bring him there

1185
01:58:21,518 --> 01:58:25,230
I think that you have onIy one son!
He'II not be aIive

1186
01:58:25,355 --> 01:58:26,147
I take Ieave

1187
01:58:49,212 --> 01:58:54,843
Bunny! seeing you,
my dress slips down!

1188
01:58:54,968 --> 01:59:00,348
Not everything
Take little!

1189
01:59:00,557 --> 01:59:06,187
Your aunt asked when
you would become her son in law!

1190
01:59:06,563 --> 01:59:09,190
-Bunny!
-Dear!

1191
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:14,863
Oh dear! l will plough your
cheeks with my kisses!

1192
01:59:15,071 --> 01:59:20,618
l'll take you with me!
What other work do l have?

1193
01:59:20,744 --> 01:59:26,541
lf anyone obstructs
would beat them away!

1194
02:00:08,958 --> 02:00:14,589
-Your beauty is hidden
in a nest -Hidden!

1195
02:00:14,714 --> 02:00:20,261
-l have caught old of a
jasmine bunch! -Bunch!

1196
02:00:20,387 --> 02:00:25,934
My mind would be
excited at the stroke of 1 'o' clock

1197
02:00:26,059 --> 02:00:31,439
When l unite with you
my feet would dance like Tsunami!

1198
02:00:31,981 --> 02:00:36,277
l won't leave your beauty!

1199
02:00:36,486 --> 02:00:40,323
Don't leave my youth!

1200
02:00:40,657 --> 02:00:46,454
Don't do, stop talking!
Let us kill shyness in darkness!

1201
02:00:46,621 --> 02:00:49,290
-Bunny buddy!
-What dear?

1202
02:01:42,552 --> 02:01:48,183
l'll steal your beauties
in the nights as well as day!

1203
02:01:48,308 --> 02:01:53,855
You will not bear when l do that!

1204
02:01:54,022 --> 02:01:59,527
-We should make an amorous journey!
-An amorous journey

1205
02:01:59,736 --> 02:02:05,367
Will shut the door and
mouth while doing that!

1206
02:02:05,742 --> 02:02:09,704
Move to a corner!

1207
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:13,875
At the right time give pleasure!

1208
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:20,048
Should make the rooster silent
instead the cot legs should crackle!

1209
02:03:03,466 --> 02:03:04,926
Open your eyes sIowIy!

1210
02:03:12,142 --> 02:03:15,270
-Can you see!
-I can see

1211
02:03:16,146 --> 02:03:19,774
Is this a dream or reaIity?
-It's true

1212
02:03:20,525 --> 02:03:24,446
Doctor sir, how I got my eyes?
-Because of Bunny!

1213
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:31,619
You. . .,I am Sudhir
my eyes were pIucked by you!

1214
02:03:32,454 --> 02:03:37,959
Last night my father passed away!
Bunny arranged to fix dad's eyes to you

1215
02:03:38,668 --> 02:03:43,506
I reaIized the harm what I did to you
after I Iost my eyes!

1216
02:03:44,549 --> 02:03:50,472
Though the bIinds can not see the worId
but they wiII sureIy know what is heII

1217
02:03:51,681 --> 02:03:54,142
Because these probIems are known . . .

1218
02:03:54,684 --> 02:03:57,312
Chiranjeevi has Iaunched an eye bank
and is asking for eye donation

1219
02:03:58,021 --> 02:04:01,483
If you can, donate eyes but don't pIuck it!

1220
02:04:19,042 --> 02:04:24,673
No. Enough of this fights.
Past is past. Let's stop at this

1221
02:04:26,549 --> 02:04:29,844
For the first time in my Iife
my wife asked me a question

1222
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:33,682
Even after knowing that
you're his father's murderer..

1223
02:04:34,224 --> 02:04:36,518
..my son-in-Iaw Iet you free for my sake

1224
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:40,855
Won't you change yourseIf
for your daughter's happiness

1225
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:46,194
I committed many mistakes for money
But I have understood now that I can..

1226
02:04:47,237 --> 02:04:51,199
..buy anything for a price, but not the . . .

1227
02:04:52,117 --> 02:04:54,703
. . . IittIe smiIe on my daughter's face

1228
02:04:56,246 --> 02:04:58,707
You didn't withstand when
I stopped taIking to you

1229
02:04:59,416 --> 02:05:01,543
Can you bear the tragedy if I die?

1230
02:05:04,087 --> 02:05:08,216
As a man I vied for property
but as a father. . .

1231
02:05:09,426 --> 02:05:12,053
No! Don't!

1232
02:05:12,929 --> 02:05:16,057
Let MahaIakshmi marry him

1233
02:05:18,518 --> 02:05:20,895
Don't do!

1234
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:33,616
-Lord Narasimha!
-HaiI!

1235
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:11,946
Where is my son?

1236
02:06:12,739 --> 02:06:15,116
Hand over my son to me

1237
02:06:15,658 --> 02:06:20,121
You think I am a human being
But I am not!

1238
02:06:20,246 --> 02:06:24,793
I am a buffaIo that kiIIs humans

1239
02:06:34,678 --> 02:06:38,807
He was aIso a buffaIIo
But now he has become a good man suddenIy!

1240
02:06:39,516 --> 02:06:43,812
My son shouId marry
his daughter here itseIf

1241
02:06:44,187 --> 02:06:48,483
-I shouId get his property!
-You must do it

1242
02:06:48,692 --> 02:06:51,152
Otherwise, I'II kiII aII the peopIe here!

1243
02:06:53,196 --> 02:06:58,827
I think you don't know about one thing!
I onIy kiIIed your father!

1244
02:07:03,998 --> 02:07:04,833
Wait!

1245
02:07:09,045 --> 02:07:11,673
Why aII of you are barking?

1246
02:07:13,258 --> 02:07:15,844
I'II burn aII of you with petroI!

1247
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,513
I have come here with a petroI tanker!

1248
02:07:19,222 --> 02:07:24,853
It is newIy Iaunched petroI! It'II give
more miIeage and aIso kiII more peopIe!

1249
02:07:27,397 --> 02:07:29,190
Bring my son out!

1250
02:07:30,108 --> 02:07:31,359
Why are you siIent?

1251
02:07:33,403 --> 02:07:39,701
I swear on god!!
I wiII kiII you here itseIf!

1252
02:07:41,244 --> 02:07:44,039
EIse, I am not Rangarao Bhoopathy's son!

1253
02:07:44,164 --> 02:07:49,711
Great! You shouId maintain that temper!

1254
02:07:49,919 --> 02:07:55,383
This fight is between us!
Let us not Iose our accompIices

1255
02:07:55,592 --> 02:07:59,220
I'II come aIone!
If you have guts, come aIone!

1256
02:07:59,429 --> 02:08:03,224
Anyone between us shouId
Iive today! Come on!

1257
02:08:13,777 --> 02:08:17,072
Don't you have confidence?
If you have guts, come on!

1258
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,909
We'II start the foundation work of
PooIavaram project on your tomb!

1259
02:08:21,034 --> 02:08:22,243
Come on

1260
02:08:23,953 --> 02:08:29,084
-You are just my thigh size!
-I'II stamp you to death! Come on!

1261
02:08:54,818 --> 02:08:55,610
Like that!

1262
02:09:50,874 --> 02:09:51,666
Son!

1263
02:10:06,222 --> 02:10:07,015
Come on

1264
02:10:31,081 --> 02:10:34,042
Your father's desire has
greater vaIue than your bIood!

1265
02:10:34,918 --> 02:10:38,338
Get up!
KiII him

1266
02:10:49,265 --> 02:10:50,058
KiII him

1267
02:11:47,490 --> 02:11:48,783
-Greetings sir!
-Greetings!

1268
02:11:49,492 --> 02:11:50,952
-Greetings!

1269
02:11:51,661 --> 02:11:53,288
-Are you Bunny?
-Yes sir

1270
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:57,125
You have saved your famiIy's prestige
in the name of your father

1271
02:11:59,169 --> 02:12:01,796
PoIavaram project was a dream of my father!

1272
02:12:02,005 --> 02:12:04,299
He wanted to give his weaIth for his dream!

1273
02:12:04,841 --> 02:12:07,802
Take this documents!
BuiId the project, sir!

1274
02:12:08,261 --> 02:12:11,473
In our country there are Iot of issues
when good work is initiated

1275
02:12:12,015 --> 02:12:14,142
There wouId be meaningIess
disagreements and bIames

1276
02:12:14,684 --> 02:12:19,647
I'II try to finish this project
in my term. Is it ok?

1277
02:12:19,856 --> 02:12:22,150
-Thank you sir!
-Greetings sir!

1278
02:12:22,359 --> 02:12:24,152
THE END
