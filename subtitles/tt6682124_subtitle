He was wrong about our Commissioner's sister, love-I see

5
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:11,724
This is not a sexual matter as you think, but pure love.

6
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,812
You don't know how deeply he was in love with her

7
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:19,024
Hey man, what have you done with Commissioner Sir's sister?

They're trying to forcibly marry me at home

I came to know that the next was engagement

I even forgot it was the Commissioner's house

51
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,496

But that judge was not silent.

He was given 2 years in prison.

69
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,749
The truth is that I married with pleasure.

What?

71
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:41,479
You are my Love. But I couldn't say no when my family brought me a nice prospect

Why did you tell me?

73
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:48,971
Since I didn't want to ruin my character before you, I said it with light tears.

74
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,059
What do I know you would come and make such a big mess?

75
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:58,011
I said it with you and I said different with my husband

I can't believe what you said

Have you come to stay here? - Yes

177
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,362
So, he will have to pay us the rent-OK

178
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,024
One month in advance: how much per day?

179
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,506
20 rupees a day: give it to him

180
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:24,488
You are speaking English well - Yes

181
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,130
What are you doing? - Begging, return to London

182
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,870
Did you lose property in London? - Are you mad or what?

183
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,950
I was in the same begging even there, and here?

184
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:35,926
I returned with my love to this land. Here, I came to change these idiots.

185
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:39,455
I hate Indian beggars. They don't have common sense

186
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,780
Show how you ask for the signs

187
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,350
Mister please! Mister please! - Hey! Stop!

188
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:47,794
Nasty fellows! - Then how do you beg?

189
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,330
I like this question

190
00:18:52,766 --> 00:19:03,198
Yes, Bob Marley! No no more men cry... I sing like this and show my cap like this

191
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:06,546
Any idiot with common sense would give a minimum of ten rupees.

192
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:09,630
Look, you have also given. Thank you

193
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:13,614
Mom, he's right there. He and that beggar are talking

194
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:17,142
Hey, why did you open the window? I said close, right?

195
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,310
Tea bro

196
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,918
What are you thinking, boss?

197
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:27,798
I'm thinking how to take care of those four, not four but five

198
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,009
what five

199
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,286
You broke his legs and do you know who took on the family burden?

200
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:34,794
About the agent's sister

201
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:39,578
Even she wanted to settle down in America or London like me

202
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:45,151
Because of this, she is singing in some clubs and taking care of the family.

203
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:47,022
We are both singers

204
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:49,507
I need to talk to that girl. Where would she be?

205
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,677
She can be found going to the Fusion cafe at night.

206
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,450
What is her name? -Anjali

207
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,354
Anjali? - Yes

208
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:03,403
You said the same name with which it irritates me, boss

209
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,479
Anjali! - Anjali, yes

210
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:33,527
"Oh God!"

211
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:45,844
"I'm waiting for you, come on dear"

212
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:56,598
"I'm singing your name, come on darling"

213
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:01,855
"The heart keeps crying saying to give it away"

214
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:07,014
"The heart makes me cry after it is given"

215
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:17,714
"I'm waiting for you, come on dear"

216
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:31,266
"Oh God!"

217
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:42,054
"No smile on the lip and no sensation in the eyes"

218
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:47,353
"I was never so sad because you are not with me"

219
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:52,512
"Even though I am physically here, my heart is not with me"

220
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:59,259
"Come down immediately without waiting any longer"

221
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:05,728
"Come on, dear"

222
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:16,454
"I'm waiting for you, come on dear"

223
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:43,548
"No sleep, no rest and no naughty fights of yours"

224
00:22:43,748 --> 00:22:48,620
"I remember nothing but you, no dreams but only tears"

225
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,914
"I gave myself to you, I don't exist with myself"

226
00:22:54,148 --> 00:23:02,739
"Can I live without you, bring back my heart, dear"

227
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,228
"Come on, dear"

228
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:18,254
"I'm waiting for you, come on dear"

229
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:29,477
Bye Bye

230
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,771
see you - hello

231
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:39,086
Take it

232
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,114
Take it

233
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,350
Boy, go fast. Move - Hello

234
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:52,687
Hello boy - Yes sir - Come on - quick

235
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,677
Come on, follow that - OK sir

236
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,294
brother, quick

237
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,942
Go a little further and pull over to the side - OK ma'am

238
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:17,206
Sister-in-law - What happened, dear?

239
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:23,122
That guy has been following me. He is trying to give me money

240
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:26,526
This partner? He is the reason for your brother's condition.

241
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:33,546
Come on in, darling. I will investigate your matter

242
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:37,714
Idiot, won't you let us live? Are you afraid that the boy will show money?

243
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:39,074
Come on show

244
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,629
Do you think our problems will go away with this little package?

245
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:46,822
We have spent deficiencies for hospitals, doctors and nurses

246
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,470
If you have mercy and you're human, bring bags

247
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:53,093
Does it scare you to show such small packages?

248
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:55,074
Hi, old lady! - hey

249
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:59,458
First you loved someone, you gave them a hand and then you got married, right?

250
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:06,072
That's... How do you know? - I have an ex. She would be like you when she is old

251
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,685
What is similar between her and me?

252
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,868
I have another package, do you want it? - Sure

253
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:11,464
You dirty old idiot

254
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:16,086
That old lady and the boy are very dangerous. The other three are very good

255
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,546
You must do a great job to take care of five people

256
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:22,670
Will she get into our lot? Mister please!

257
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,990
Hey, stop. No need, I'll do the job.

258
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:31,839
You must sell what you have and pay

259
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:37,072
Don't say opinion dialogues like you only have this and sell it

260
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:43,085
Sir, he's been watching you. Me and Anjali are working very hard. If you give us some time

261
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:48,221
There is no time dear, we live only a few days. If it takes time, I'll waste my time

262
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,890
Don't say it dear, you're like my eldest son

263
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,715
It's not me, I'm not your eldest son. Oh no!

264
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:58,194
You are not my mom, my mom is tall and fair like me. You are short

265
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:02,004
Look brother, look how he is

266
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:04,952
He is not my brother, everyone with a beard is my brother?

267
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:09,288
Not like that son, our Ranga Rao brought a kilo of oil from Kerala when he said

268
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:13,598
I am applying daily and his legs will be fine applying for a few days.

269
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:16,076
His debt will be paid off when he goes back to work.

270
00:26:16,276 --> 00:26:19,030
Lady, you cried just the same while taking money

271
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:22,482
You are crying the same when they ask you to pay the money. Mummy variety!

272
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:25,385
Isn't your heart melting after seeing my tears?

273
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,140
Does not melt, but hardens even more like a stone

274
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,114
How many tears will I have when you don't pick up the phone when I call?

275
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,034
No problem, even if you don't pay when the debt is taken

276
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:38,432
But we get frustrated if the call is not answered

277
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,965
OK, when you call, we'll pick up the call

278
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,648
Time's up to pick up the call, mama

279
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:46,298
It's a waste whether or not you pick up the call from now on, ma'am.

280
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:52,834
Look, sir, if you deliver the papers on the house by the end of the month, I'll sell this house and I'll be gone.

281
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,741
I met your debt, I met the lender

282
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,561
You're denying when I'm asking for my money

283
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:00,836
I'll pay that debt, don't ask them from now on

284
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,118
What will you pay for? - Because I broke his legs

285
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:09,830
OK, give it, you do one thing

286
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:12,956
If you give me a job, I'll pay the debt doing that

287
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:18,394
Hey, I'm thinking a bit when you said I broke his legs

288
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:21,570
If it was someone else, she would have pushed him by grabbing his neck

289
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:23,694
What a rascal, do you think I'm VIP?

290
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,852
Idiot, do you come home and make a nuisance for money?

291
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:30,295
I would pay when I want or I won't pay at all

292
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:34,918
Did you take the money or not? - I drank

293
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,781
Do you have to pay or not? - I will not, it is my wish

294
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:41,166
I'll break your legs if you don't pay, rascal. What are you saying, idiot?

295
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:56,436
Will you pay or not? - Hey, don't break his legs.

296
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:58,671
She should go back to her house, leave him

297
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:02,957
Leave it dear, leave it. I'll pay for it, man. Let me

298
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:07,461
Pay the money and take the bike - OK

299
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:16,749
There are millions of bad debts. If you say collect in the same style, I will give you 10%

300
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:19,160
You are my payback batch today

301
00:28:19,562 --> 00:28:22,069
OK give me that list - Hey get that bad debt list

302
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,805
Here my dear, not only this, I need another job

303
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:28,927
I have 100 cars. I'll give you one, drive it

304
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:32,471
I will drive. I need another job I have to take care of five there

305
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:37,060
What man, do you want to become Anil Ambani overnight? Watch this first

306
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:39,792
Are you calling the debtor?

307
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:44,793
He won't pick up the call. In case he picks him up, he won't say where he is.

308
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,627
Hello sir, do you have a package

309
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,124
Plot, from where? - From Hong Kong

310
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:51,885
So, bring it - Where are you?

311
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:53,841
Bulgashia - I'm coming sir

312
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:55,785
Who is this man?

313
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:58,901
Where's the package? Where is the?

314
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:04,536
You took money from Boss, right? Pay it back

315
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:06,192
You ask me for money, rascal?

316
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:07,745
Hey come on man

317
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:15,118
I'll get it, I'll get it

318
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:17,769
here

319
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:20,398
Sir, you have a package

320
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:26,497
Pay the money rascal, pay up, I'll get it tonight

321
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,942
Come on, idiot - Here, take it

322
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,122
Sir, you have a package

323
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:46,336
Who do you ask for money? Anjali, Kalighat Anjali here

324
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,486
Hello Anjali! This name of Anjali... - Anjali, my foot

325
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:54,830
Get the money, come on

326
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,910
I felt very happy hitting this Anjali than when I hit men

327
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:02,522
It was a great satisfaction to my heart.

328
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:06,254
Don't feel bad for me like I say

329
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,563
I am a very responsible person

330
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:17,450
Useless companions, who said? Who said that beggars were dressed in torn and shabby clothes?

331
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,806
How should beggars be? They should be very cute

332
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:24,005
It should look like one should feel talk once seen

333
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:30,085
Smile on the face, drums in the hands and a good song... It looks so good to see

334
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,706
The guy who gives a rupee will give two rupees

335
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,576
Instead of asking, he spreads his hands and begs saying please sir

336
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:41,278
Damn beggars! Look guys

337
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:49,030
Look at her, no one knows who she is. No one knows about your problems

338
00:30:49,408 --> 00:30:52,466
She covered her entire face and sat up. People are giving money

339
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:55,914
Why? It's the concept, guys. Is the concept

340
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:57,682
Update guys!

341
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:01,330
I'm driving car, for you. Enters

342
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:04,982
I won't, I've been waiting for an hour

343
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:09,590
I'll go home if you come in, I won't come

344
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:12,394
Why do not you come? - I hate to see you

345
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:19,468
Getting angry. Added, I can't stand to see you in front of the house

346
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:27,199
Seeing you, I feel like coming with a big stone at night and breaking both legs

347
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:33,377
Innocence on the face and violence on the inside, that's why I hate girls

348
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:40,998
Added, your name is Anjali. I want to cut her from all directions

349
00:31:41,672 --> 00:31:44,161
Come in, we'll go home. I'll get into another car.

350
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:48,594
Hey, get into this than that. Give me that money

351
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,044
I won't get in your car - Hey, get in the car

352
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,982
Hey, why did you take out the knife?

353
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:57,843
Police, police - Come on, call again

354
00:31:58,348 --> 00:31:59,279
Policeman!

355
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,670
Stop singing now, find a rich boy, crush him and marry him and walk away

356
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,042
I will take care of your family

357
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:21,346
You look like an article and you may have already put some online

358
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:26,894
Have you saved or not? You was make

359
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:35,690
This is common for you girls. A scapegoat and a standby

360
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,746
You said it great, bro - You said it great, friend

361
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,470
Are you human or animal?

362
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:54,112
What do you drink in front of the temple of the Goddess, idiots?

363
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:01,674
That God himself says nothing and why for you, idiot?

364
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:03,792
Hey let me Let me, who are you, rascal?

365
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,382
What is your annoyance in our area?

366
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:10,653
Did you make a mistake and hit me again?

367
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,774
I will file a complaint - Complaint, who are you going to complain to?

368
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:20,005
Son, these guys are hitting me. What man, is he your father?

369
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:23,473
You are not my son and I am not your father

370
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,735
No, hey, are you drinking or are we?

371
00:33:28,935 --> 00:33:30,612
Why do you say a stranger like your son?

372
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:33,041
Hey, why did you say that son?

373
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:36,928
Why did you go and hide behind him, man?

374
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:41,056
Come on buddy, he's our entertainment today. Bring it

375
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,471
hey come on man

376
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:48,208
Did you say he wasn't your dad?

377
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:58,513
No dad, but when someone comes after me, I'll go far for them.

378
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:17,923
Sir, is he your son or not?

379
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:22,444
Oh no, he is my son. Sarada Hospital and normal delivery, is speaking for

380
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,308
I asked to leave the house in anger

381
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:45,057
Which idiot did you like? You made him sleep on your lap

382
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,629
push it away

383
00:34:49,227 --> 00:34:50,433
Go rascal

384
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:01,093
Why did you hide behind me? - You won't hit if I'm behind you, right brother?

385
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,001
Go away - OK brother

386
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,861
You might think I'll let you melt when I see your fight

387
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:12,157
You got a package - Package?

388
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,960
You have to pay boss money, right? Come on give it

389
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,977
Still, what is your link to my debt? I have no money and I will not pay

390
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,173
I know how to collect if you don't pay

391
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:25,309
Your wife has kept a gold chain in the kitchen, I'll come and take it away

392
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,221
Hey, who is that girl?

393
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,598
It's the gift you gave, you made her come into my life

394
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:36,306
She walked in when I went for that agent

395
00:35:40,844 --> 00:35:46,594
The sun is too hot, she added, I'm not getting any customers. I am very frustrated

396
00:35:47,441 --> 00:35:51,505
When I was scolding myself thinking that all those problems were due to my Ex...

397
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:56,345
Then I heard exactly the voice of my ex. - Brother, give him a glass

398
00:36:04,644 --> 00:36:07,597
I am sorry! When did you get out of jail?

399
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:14,053
It's been so long since I saw you. What is this toto?

400
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:18,397
Are you driving a toto? What happened to you?

401
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:22,414
What do you drive up to after studying MBA?

402
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:28,674
Why do you ruin such a wonderful life? - What, booty? - Yes

403
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:30,761
Did you spoil yourself or did it spoil me?

404
00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:42,086
Hey!

405
00:36:44,554 --> 00:36:46,405
Hey stop rascal

406
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:49,697
Idiot, did I screw it up?

407
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,625
Idiot, stop! You!

408
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:56,373
Hey move

409
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:08,803
What happened Anjali, why are you running? - Foot race

410
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:11,446
Race race, with whom? -Usha

411
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,425
PT Usha? - Oh no, our husband Usha. My classmate

412
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:23,501
She came to our wedding, she wore a pink middy-pink middy?

413
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:30,793
She said that your husband is handsome and attractive, I told you right?

414
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:35,649
It's her, did you forget? - Is she in our wedding photos?

415
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:40,345
I will not show even if she is there. She is already looking out for you

416
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:44,674
That's why I don't even call her at our house

417
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,915
What if you don't call? Call the

418
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:49,367
Are we letting friends go or what?

419
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:55,275
If you call on Saturday or Sunday, let's plan something

420
00:37:56,356 --> 00:37:58,079
Who is this pink middy?

421
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:01,690
Sir, you have a package

422
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,205
Hello sir - There is an idiot, sir.

423
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:10,025
He took money and is not paying. He is giving warnings when he is asked

424
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:11,397
What should I do with it, sir?

425
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:14,731
Pick it up and hit it in the dark, he'd give it to himself

426
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:16,551
It can become a problem doing it

427
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:20,909
Trouble or my foot, are you going to court or what? You should treat cases like this only

428
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:22,898
No sir, he's a big shot

429
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:28,443
Hey, who's a big fish? There's nothing wrong with hitting when he made a mistake

430
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:29,442
What is his name?

431
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:32,309
Dilip Kumar, police inspector of the circle. What?

432
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:33,561
Why do you say my name, idiot?

433
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:37,683
You've taken money from boss, haven't you, sir? You should at least pay this now

434
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,010
Idiot, asking the police for money? You…

435
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:46,051
You said pick it up yourself, didn't you, sir? Shall I pick it up, sir?

436
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,398
Let, hey let me rascal

437
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,082
hey let me

438
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:54,383
Hey, what are you doing? - Move over, man.

439
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,938
Hello what's going on?

440
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:01,474
He is doing too much sir

441
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,994
Sir, I'm working on a recovery team.

442
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:09,778
As if you had goals in your department, similarly my boss has given me few goals

443
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:15,009
Sir took money and is not paying. When he questions him, he asks saying that he asked a policeman.

444
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,437
Your police people won't pay him money, sir?

445
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:19,940
How much should I pay you?

446
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,559
You should pay a lot, sir. But, I should give at least 50 now

447
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:26,466
How much do you have in your pocket? - Mister

448
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:29,266
How much is in the pocket? - I have twenty thousand sir

449
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:34,068
Go out, pick it up from your friends and give it to them, sir, that's it

450
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:43,338
Inspector Dilip Kumar, the entire department will not become a hero when there is a hero in it.

451
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:47,866
But with such a deed, the prestige of the entire department will be gone.

452
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:54,065
So, give 50,000 to not let the prestige of our department go - OK, sir

453
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:57,401
Sit down

454
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:02,881
Tea or coffee for you? - Tea, but green tea

455
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,806
So, are you working hard for the agent's family? Okay!

456
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:13,954
Do you know what my sister said about you?

457
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:18,498
Oh brother, he is a rogue. He just follows me

458
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,798
He is crazy about me Worst mate!

459
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:30,526
I believed that what my sister said was true. I thought you were a bum

460
00:40:31,872 --> 00:40:39,886
But, you beat up 20 cops for my sister on engagement day, then I saw love in your eyes

461
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,486
Then I knew that you were in love

462
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:53,318
And that my sister told a lie - Lord, don't talk about that girl

463
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:59,141
My friend, there is no need to upset my sister.

464
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:05,202
Any girl who has two options, would mark the best one.

465
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:10,906
Since my brother-in-law is in a better position than you, she married him.

466
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:16,894
You see, everyone in life wants the BBD, the biggest best deal

467
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:24,241
It's natural. You would also get married better when two girls show up, right?

468
00:41:25,664 --> 00:41:29,862
Don't rack your brain by thinking so much. All of these are common

469
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,354
You can't change the past. Look into the future

470
00:41:34,016 --> 00:41:35,765
Can I come in sir? Mister!

471
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:39,174
Check this case sir

472
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:41,930
What are you here, man?

473
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:44,165
Why did you come here, sir?

474
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,698
When did you come from jail, man?

475
00:41:49,784 --> 00:41:50,782
Are you still making fun of girls?

476
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:56,006
If you bother again I'll shoot you rascal

477
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:01,562
I didn't like that you made him sit and talk, sir

478
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:03,203
This green tea is added for him

479
00:42:03,403 --> 00:42:08,966
Anti oxidant is necessary after two years in prison, what? Take a sit

480
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:13,677
He doesn't know about his wife. I'm sorry to see

481
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:17,274
Do you know the theory behind begging? Everyone in this world is a beggar.

482
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:19,470
But, there is only one difference.

483
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:23,578
We pray outside the temple and the rich pray inside the temple

484
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:29,214
We ask for votes, seats, discounts, promotions.

485
00:42:30,352 --> 00:42:33,090
Begging is an art. It shouldn't be like begging

486
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,654
should be like asking

487
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:39,991
Hey you! Look at you! Having

488
00:42:40,832 --> 00:42:44,294
Look, he doesn't know how to beg. He is very poor at begging

489
00:42:44,504 --> 00:42:45,550
But she…

490
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:55,038
She begs without asking anyone. Our mother, the beggar's mother

491
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:56,854
Mother... beggar's mother!

492
00:42:58,204 --> 00:42:59,177
Stop

493
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:04,450
I have brought Bengal Biryani, family pack

494
00:43:05,776 --> 00:43:08,474
Why isn't he drinking when I say drink? Eat it

495
00:43:08,827 --> 00:43:12,142
Lamb or chicken, son? - Mom, why chicken or lamb, for us?

496
00:43:13,332 --> 00:43:15,157
Give that and send it away. Hey come out rascal

497
00:43:15,423 --> 00:43:19,766
It's not that sir, today is Ramzan and I brought him thinking that the whole family will eat

498
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:26,282
We know how to cook Biryani. We know how to eat biryani and we even know how to buy biryani

499
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:32,106
Do you have common sense or not? What do you think of yourself? You are a hero?

500
00:43:32,413 --> 00:43:37,502
I am not a hero, but a villain. I'll show you what villain is, rascal

501
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:39,333
Hello old lady, take it

502
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,274
You know how to eat and cook it seems - Hey - Hey

503
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,392
Stop, stop - Don't hit, man - suit pity

504
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,044
Hey idiot - Showing poses

505
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:09,527
If you don't eat biryani today, I'll break your brother's head.

506
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:33,352
Sir, some guy is forcing our family to eat biryani. Please sir, come sir

507
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:39,512
Is he?

508
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:46,076
What man, bothering the family look like?

509
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:49,838
Sir, lock him up, sir. It has become a great torture for us.

510
00:44:50,038 --> 00:44:52,328
Idiot, you torture a police family?

511
00:44:53,097 --> 00:44:55,197
Don't you want to be out? Will you go back in?

512
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:58,886
What idiot, do you think there is no one behind me?

513
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:01,549
Department! The whole department is behind me.

514
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:03,096
My foot is there

515
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:13,970
Has anyone given a single rupee? Did someone come to see at least? What?

516
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:19,257
Do you know how much debt you have? He doesn't know either

517
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:24,465
I am saying now I have cleared 70% of the debt.

518
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,926
That kid, I paid that kid's school fees

519
00:45:32,284 --> 00:45:36,745
Look at that old lady, she took money from me saying that she has pains here and there

520
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:42,546
After doing so much when I told you to eat Biryani, you called this and

521
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,201
of them came here with 40 sticks

522
00:45:47,676 --> 00:45:52,434
Excellent! I'm taking care of your family feeling guilt.

523
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:55,708
Who cares what you do? You have made my husband disabled.

524
00:45:55,908 --> 00:46:01,977
Madam, her own husband came that day with these same 20 people to break my legs.

525
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,137
If I was silent, he would have broken my legs

526
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,245
We would only know when ours are broken

527
00:46:10,678 --> 00:46:17,503
If you mess with me, I hit the same 20 that day. I broke his legs

528
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:21,880
It's no big deal for me to break another guy's legs

529
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,356
Think about it

530
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:38,304
That guy is so clear and why you confuse us? What he said is correct, right?

531
00:46:38,803 --> 00:46:42,212
Hello Murali, he is standing as a support for your family. He's fine, right?

532
00:46:42,986 --> 00:46:44,689
I ask because there is a girl in your house.

533
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:48,649
Did she ever bother you, dear? - No sir

534
00:46:49,002 --> 00:46:51,085
Did she speak any vulgar language? - No sir

535
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:54,049
And that? What is her mistake?

536
00:46:56,406 --> 00:47:01,205
To ask about the truth in what I said, she ran to the set

537
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:05,396
These ladies believe the lies but not the truth

538
00:47:09,214 --> 00:47:13,756
Did that man cancel our debt? - It really cleared up, dear

539
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:19,557
Just a little is pending and you don't need any tension now to lose your house

540
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:29,373
Look baby I'll tell you something if you don't confuse me

541
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:36,525
Why don't you marry that boy? He's taking you trouble, he's clearing your debts

542
00:47:37,694 --> 00:47:39,705
Will you get a better guy than him, anywhere?

543
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:42,500
I just gave my opinion, dear. It's your wish now

544
00:47:43,622 --> 00:47:47,292
I really liked the boy. If you don't marry him, I'll give him my daughter

545
00:47:47,518 --> 00:47:50,928
There is no doubt about that. She added that it is very difficult to be such idiots

546
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,318
Son! Son!

547
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:01,057
Son! - Mom, here

548
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:07,439
I've come son, I came saying that I can't be with your dad

549
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:13,494
Who would be with such a rigid man? I came saying that I would be with my son from now on

550
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:15,498
Look, I came with the suitcase

551
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,066
Dammit!

552
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:20,658
Who are these? - Our Supporters

553
00:48:21,896 --> 00:48:25,562
supporters! Who is he? - My roommate, mom

554
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:28,270
Hello, son, today is your birthday, right?

555
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:32,342
He had been in the temple and prayed. I even brought your favorite candy

556
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,631
Here, eat. What is this yellow rice?

557
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:39,498
It is a blessing of rice. Oh, a blessing of rice?

558
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:45,004
God bless you - Mom, I don't need God's blessings

559
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:46,204
don't say that son

560
00:48:46,404 --> 00:48:51,042
Either we have God's blessings or we don't, everyone here will die in a few days

561
00:48:51,816 --> 00:48:55,445
Only God has to live here forever and not us.

562
00:48:55,645 --> 00:48:58,651
I will even give my blessings and ask him to be here.

563
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:05,250
Oh no, you shouldn't say that to God. With his mercy, he would take good care of us all.

564
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:11,278
Okay? There are 4 million blind people in the world, ask him to give both eyes for at least one

565
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:14,074
Then I will believe that the God you believe exists

566
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:20,646
God does not come, he will not help. If necessary, he gives your blessings and that is enough

567
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:25,456
Live happily for 100 years: I don't need 100 years, 80 is enough

568
00:49:25,656 --> 00:49:30,716
OK, live healthy and happy for the years you want to live - OK

569
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:32,244
Cake ready - I should sing happy birthday now

570
00:49:32,444 --> 00:49:33,815
Why songs now, mom? We will sing

571
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:36,038
No, you do not. Who else now?

572
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:38,090
Hello girl, come here once

573
00:49:38,904 --> 00:49:41,762
You, it's my son's happy birthday. You come and sing

574
00:49:42,324 --> 00:49:46,780
Mom, you sing if you have to. I won't keep my cool if she sings

575
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,910
I die every day without being able to hear her voice every day at the bar.

576
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:57,498
Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

577

Come on guys, why is the box empty?

580
00:50:14,994 --> 00:50:18,087
You won't eat the candy unless you see this empty box and so on

581
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,843
Will I be without your dad? Goodbye son

You scream and immediately cry: am I doing it?

653
00:57:45,537 --> 00:57:48,834
Yes, you are. Is that why they call me psycho?

654
00:57:49,516 --> 00:57:54,379
I have no idea, they call me also as a rogue. I don't know why they call it that either.

655
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:59,552
Dude, creative people like us seem crazy about normal people.

656
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:02,930
That's why they call you a rogue and me a psychopath. Just look at them

657
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:11,807
Same script, nothing creative. Nothing creative!

658

It's fun, right? - Yes

662
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:37,033
But this is what I love to do.

663
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:42,763
When we cut off his hand like that with a blade...

664
00:58:42,963 --> 00:58:45,853
Hey, that's why they call you psycho

665
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:49,589
Is it wrong to cut? - What, court idiot? You do not make sense?

666
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:52,120
What is this Friend? Why are you mad?

667
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:56,069
What is a friend - Friend is a friend, you are my best friend

668
00:58:56,747 --> 00:58:59,158
I don't have anyone but you, I don't have any either

669
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:03,686
Friend, I would give my life for you. Because right now? - I will give

670
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:07,273
OK, give me - But first, I need a hug

671
00:59:07,747 --> 00:59:09,453
You won't cry again, will you? - Promise, I won't cry

672
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:12,641
OK, come on - I love you, Friend

673
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:18,245

Friend my friend best friend

676
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:33,089
Don't leak the subject of your escape in the media. The prestige of the department will be gone

677
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:35,437
Who said to take him to the hospital?

678
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,820
No sir, he is a prisoner and we had to take him as he was not feeling well

679
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:44,061
That is our procedure. One says stomach pain and another says out of breath, what will we do?

680
00:59:45,183 --> 00:59:54,598
(playing songs in Hindi)

681
00:59:55,015 --> 00:59:56,273
excuse me if

682
00:59:57,171 --> 01:00:02,419
I need to go to song rehearsal, ask her to get up. He should drop me - Oh

683
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:05,204
You know one thing, today is a total strike. You do not know

684
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,273
full strike? - Yes

685
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:10,533
Oh no, I have to go. How?

686
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:16,249
Where should she go? - Darjipada

687
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:18,870
Okay, move. Let's try something

688
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:25,329
Why try anything? Take my bike - This, will this work?

689
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:32,229
What do you mean? Look darling, take that bike, bend over and kick it

690
01:00:44,575 --> 01:00:48,377
I should ask you something, will you tell me? - What?

691
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:54,677
You tried to beat a girl on the roads one day

692
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:58,317
Not to beat, but I tried to kill

693
01:00:59,954 --> 01:01:01,836
Poor girl, what did she do?

694
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,992
Poor girl! Poor girl cheated on me

695
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:13,512
Will you kill if she cheats? Girls are very sensitive, they are very sensitive.

696
01:01:14,323 --> 01:01:17,899
They are like flowers, flowers!

697
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:22,062
Get off, get off first - What?

698
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,400
Come here in front of me

699
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:29,440
Are girls like flowers? - Yes

700
01:01:29,698 --> 01:01:32,404
You are a flower and she is a flower and what are we?

701
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:33,777
You are thorns

702
01:01:34,114 --> 01:01:37,244
So why did you wake up the sleeping thorn and ask to fall?

703
01:01:37,882 --> 01:01:41,662
Go, go walking - I should go practice the song

704
01:01:41,862 --> 01:01:45,048
I should also practice the song. My guitarist is waiting there

705
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:49,552
Please, time is up. I'm running late please come down - Go idiot

706
01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:58,132
Psycho, the great Psycho

707
01:02:00,626 --> 01:02:02,300
Wave!

708
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:06,704
Hello my love!

709
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:20,888
Nerd! I came for you and I'm wandering around the city and you...

710
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:22,636
What do you do?

711
01:02:24,138 --> 01:02:25,143
Will you run away

712
01:02:27,638 --> 01:02:30,032
It's not fair baby, it's not good at all

713
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:45,772
Giving you a kiss on the lips, taking you away, I wish to sleep on your lap

714
01:02:46,586 --> 01:02:51,864
I miss you so much. Just one kiss - No

715
01:02:52,322 --> 01:02:57,264
One, just one kiss please. Please no

716
01:02:58,262 --> 01:03:00,676
Only a kiss

717
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,900
Hello Friend! What friend, what are you here?

718
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:24,600
Why did she come and hide behind you? By any chance, is she in love with you?

719
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:28,232
No, are you in love with her?

720
01:03:29,749 --> 01:03:35,604
No, oh, thank God! You know, because I love her so much

721
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:42,184
That girl is mine, man. Come on give me that girl

722
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:45,884
Take if she comes to her will. Do not force

723
01:03:47,676 --> 01:03:51,301
Friend, you are my friend. OK I don't want to kill you

724
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:55,746
I should give you 150 rupees, right? I will give extra 50 rupees

725
01:03:55,946 --> 01:03:59,868
OK, give it to her. Give me that girl, I won't

726
01:04:01,274 --> 01:04:03,988
Why? -Why will I give in when she hides behind me?

727
01:04:07,854 --> 01:04:13,165
Hey, I broke out of jail for her and I went to jail for her

728
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:15,904
I need that girl, Dude. Don't get in the way

729
01:04:19,978 --> 01:04:22,043
As you wish - No!

730
01:04:58,501 --> 01:04:59,396
Dude!

731
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:22,660
Hey!

732
01:05:37,815 --> 01:05:38,597
Hi, friend!

733
01:05:45,163 --> 01:05:45,945
Dude!

734
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:03,760
Hi no!

735
01:06:15,857 --> 01:06:19,227
Oh no!

736
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:13,940
Dude, I'll take it even by killing you. I also say the same, Friend.

737
01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:16,448
Kill me and take her

738
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:24,580
So let me load my gun - load it

739
01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:38,697
Goodbye friend

740
01:07:46,741 --> 01:07:47,911
hey!

741
01:07:55,902 --> 01:08:00,412
I have no idea what this girl did, but he's frustrated.

742
01:08:00,862 --> 01:08:05,078
But he's hitting me back somewhere. He won't leave this girl so easily.

743
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:17,140
Anjali, where are you taking that carriage?

744
01:08:19,307 --> 01:08:22,494
Anjali, where are you going? Brother ask, right?

745
01:08:24,131 --> 01:08:26,205
For that man, why do you take it for him?

746
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:30,918
He is doing a lot for us. There's nothing wrong with giving him food for once, brother.

747
01:08:53,594 --> 01:08:56,573
What have you done to him? - Who?

748
01:08:56,863 --> 01:08:58,986
That psycho, what am I doing?

749
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:02,653
You cheated on him, it seems. He told me

750
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:05,401
Looks like he even went to jail because of you

751
01:09:07,891 --> 01:09:09,504
Maybe he would have come after you listening to your voice

752
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:11,653
You would have used it and then left it

753
01:09:13,571 --> 01:09:16,629
All girls are like that - Listen, I'll tell what happened

754
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:21,069
I won't let you eat unless you hear that

755
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:23,332
I saw it when I was in the last year.

756
01:09:24,963 --> 01:09:28,618
She always used to fall behind my friend Suneetha

757
01:09:28,907 --> 01:09:31,332
One day he came with a bucket full of gasoline to school

758
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:36,183
Psycho, the great Psycho

759
01:09:38,244 --> 01:09:41,257
And this is partition... Oh no!

760
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:46,357
Hi sir! - Hello, friends, how are you?

761
01:09:50,888 --> 01:09:51,750
Who are you?

762
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:59,219
Someone has broken my heart like this

763
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:04,729
My life has turned to ruin

764
01:10:08,016 --> 01:10:11,466
Hey hey you Leave that girl

765
01:10:12,032 --> 01:10:18,148
Teacher, she is not listening when I said Tiamo so many times

766
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:22,126
What is tiamo? - Professor Tiamo, I love you

767
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,746
But, but she's hating me. - Please

768
01:10:26,104 --> 01:10:28,374
That's why I came to burn it pouring the gasoline

769
01:10:29,132 --> 01:10:33,164
No no please Leave that girl, similar incidents are seen everywhere

770
01:10:33,364 --> 01:10:35,266
I beg you, leave that girl

771
01:10:36,617 --> 01:10:38,414
Not teacher? - No Please

772
01:10:39,508 --> 01:10:42,727
OK OK teacher OK

773
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:49,121
Since everyone cries when I said burn this girl, let's do one thing

774
01:10:50,764 --> 01:10:54,112
Ask this girl to pour the same gasoline on me and burn

775
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:56,595
In agreement? - Nerd

776
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,226
I can't live without you, darling. I have no right to live

777
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,195
I can't live without you - No please

778
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:09,209
Please kill Me. Take the bucket

779
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:15,116
Nerd! Please, I beg you

780
01:11:15,316 --> 01:11:17,726
If you don't burn, I will burn. Do it

781
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:23,738
Come on

782
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,615
Brothers, do any of you have a lighter?

783
01:11:55,739 --> 01:12:00,410
What idiot, you want to burn me? - Nope

784
01:12:01,396 --> 01:12:06,319
And you, rascal? Do you really pour gasoline when I say for fun?

785
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,594
You're not going to change

786
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:33,973
Did you kill my friends, rascal?

787
01:12:40,299 --> 01:12:41,193
Hey…

788
01:12:45,843 --> 01:12:49,904
You've lost your mind? Have I no right to live?

789
01:12:51,519 --> 01:12:54,705
Hey I'm telling you

790
01:12:57,015 --> 01:12:58,468
Hey, I'll die if the fire reaches

791
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:00,888
Hey, have you gone crazy?

792
01:13:01,647 --> 01:13:02,604
Hey don't come closer

793
01:13:04,642 --> 01:13:05,360
Nope!

794
01:13:07,118 --> 01:13:08,623
Hey someone tell her

795
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:24,964
Kill this crazy dog!

796
01:13:29,286 --> 01:13:30,464
Do you understand now?

797
01:13:41,494 --> 01:13:45,032
You said something yesterday, is it true?

798
01:13:45,977 --> 01:13:46,685
What?

799
01:13:47,054 --> 01:13:48,892
Kill me and take her

800
01:13:49,954 --> 01:13:54,888
Will you defend me? Do you have so much to give life?

801
01:13:56,614 --> 01:14:02,228
Today is world promise day. Promise!

802
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:08,344
Why should I make promises? You're asking for promise, what's the meaning?

803
01:14:09,858 --> 01:14:14,296
That means you don't believe us. So why should we make promises?

804
01:14:17,326 --> 01:14:21,148
Did our men ever ask you for any promises? Have you no shame?

805
01:14:21,446 --> 01:14:27,192
You should feel ashamed. You don't need to ask us, we'll stand up for you

806
01:14:27,651 --> 01:14:31,512
We die for you Just because you don't stop...

807
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:34,075
We are not like you guys

808
01:14:35,254 --> 01:14:35,956
huh

809
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,473
hey!

810
01:14:39,774 --> 01:14:40,540
Go idiot

811
01:14:40,982 --> 01:14:42,536
Hey, our brother has come

812
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,872
My brother is number one. Thank you, thank you friend.

813
01:14:53,278 --> 01:14:58,533
I have four boys who cry for me. Not four brothers, there are a total of 8 here.

814
01:14:59,046 --> 01:15:00,578
We will die brother, we will kill ourselves for you

815
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:01,872
Will you kill yourself?

816
01:15:04,294 --> 01:15:08,846
I don't understand something when there is a suicidal batch, guys

817
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:09,766
What is that, brother?

818
01:15:09,966 --> 01:15:15,881
When I was in jail for so long, why didn't any of you come to visit me?

819
01:15:16,538 --> 01:15:19,814
We thought to come, but... What, but rascal?

820
01:15:20,826 --> 01:15:23,914
Did you think to come? Do you promise again and say die for me?

821
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:28,110
All of you are not my friends. That boy is my friend

822
01:15:28,432 --> 01:15:30,994
My only friend, my Friend and my heartbeat.

823
01:15:31,896 --> 01:15:33,958
Hi Izaz bro

824
01:15:34,892 --> 01:15:38,646
We should kill him and catch her

825
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:42,342
Even her last wish was that

826
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:47,079
Sir - Sit down, sit down - Hello Lord

827
01:15:48,416 --> 01:15:49,634
Chair! Be seated sir

828
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:54,778
That psycho broke out of jail. You already know, right?

829
01:15:55,819 --> 01:16:01,454
I know sir. -The only name he wrote on the walls of his prison was Anjali.

830
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:12,743
Anjali - He took revenge on you

831
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:17,430
He can attack you at any time: he already attacked

832
01:16:20,657 --> 01:16:21,687
He saved me

833
01:16:27,957 --> 01:16:29,920
Why did not you tell me? Why did not you tell me?

834
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,851
I told him no - Hey, who are you to say no?

835
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:35,102
She is my sister. What if she happens to him tomorrow?

836
01:16:37,644 --> 01:16:42,066
OK, I'll put two of our agents on mufti - No

837
01:16:44,023 --> 01:16:47,498
I'm already here in mufti. I'll take care - Hey

838
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,669
Lord, keep them

839
01:16:51,988 --> 01:16:52,818
Give your phone one time

840
01:16:56,964 --> 01:16:59,398
This is my number. Call me right away if you hear from him

841
01:17:00,108 --> 01:17:03,166
But you're not going anywhere: the baby has many shows, my dear

842
01:17:04,064 --> 01:17:07,178
Let his show be done first and then you can have your shows - OK

843
01:17:07,919 --> 01:17:10,330
OK! I came to say the same

844
01:17:12,104 --> 01:17:14,254
I can't bear to hear what the commissioner says about you

845
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:18,197
Are you really a nice guy? - No sir

846
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,892
Hey, where are you taking me? - Hello, go away

847
01:17:29,092 --> 01:17:31,318
Shut up and come - Hey, mental

848
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:33,308
Hey, stop - Hey

849
01:17:33,508 --> 01:17:37,582
Both legs are paralyzed as the spinal cord is severely injured.

850
01:17:37,888 --> 01:17:41,166
The doctor comes from America. I'll show you these reports.

851
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:44,342
We don't know unless he arrives if there is a possibility or not

852
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:45,708
call me when I arrive

853
01:17:47,891 --> 01:17:49,972
Sorry!

854
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:57,355
What? - I'll be with you from today

855
01:17:57,725 --> 01:18:02,999
I'll go wherever you go - OK come on in

856
01:18:10,294 --> 01:18:11,428
Happy Valentines Day

857
01:18:12,474 --> 01:18:18,592
"I didn't like anyone like you"

858
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:25,846
"No one pinched my heart like you"

859
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:32,967
"Promise of God, I'm flat for you"

860
01:18:33,326 --> 01:18:41,064
"What have you done?"

861
01:18:48,902 --> 01:18:55,080
"I didn't like anyone like you"

862
01:18:56,002 --> 01:19:02,428
"No one pinched my heart like you"

863
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:09,616
"Promise of God, I'm flat for you"

864
01:19:10,181 --> 01:19:12,466
"What have you done?"

865
01:19:13,537 --> 01:19:19,831
"You shot throwing a smile"

866
01:19:20,861 --> 01:19:27,303
"I tried so hard to escape"

867
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,699
Hey, where's that guy? - Who?

868
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,479
Where is that automatic driver? - What autopilot?

869
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:37,226
What car driver, rascal?

870
01:19:42,641 --> 01:19:45,051
Come on, give a rascal - Here

871
01:19:48,025 --> 01:19:55,058
"If love is crazy, yes baby, I'm crazy"

872
01:19:55,389 --> 01:20:02,311
"The heart has wings and the stars are seen in the day"

873
01:20:06,409 --> 01:20:13,421
"If love is crazy, yes baby, I'm crazy"

874
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:20,198
“You drowned with beauty like the cyclone in the Bay of Bengal”

875
01:20:20,713 --> 01:20:27,467
"You did something with thought all day with a sharp look"

876
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:35,390
"What the heavens were you in for so long?"

877
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:42,642
"Where did you go escaping from my eyes?"

878
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:51,451
"I didn't like anyone like you"

879
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:59,080
"No one pinched my heart like you"

880
01:20:59,306 --> 01:21:06,061
"Promise of God, I'm flat for you"

881
01:21:06,525 --> 01:21:09,708
"What have you done?"

882
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:15,787
"You shot throwing a smile"

883
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:23,484
"I tried so hard to escape"

884
01:21:26,766 --> 01:21:27,999
You know that auto controller?

885
01:21:29,314 --> 01:21:31,494
Hey, why do you keep silent without an answer when I ask you?

886
01:21:32,504 --> 01:21:35,754
Hello, dark demon! Brother, she thinks of you as a fool

887
01:21:37,712 --> 01:21:41,442
Sir, please stop. Hello sir, don't shoot

888
01:21:41,642 --> 01:21:42,807
I beg you, don't shoot sir

889
01:21:43,374 --> 01:21:45,598
Sir, the thing is, she doesn't talk to anyone.

890
01:21:45,798 --> 01:21:47,416
What is her name? - Anjali, sir

891
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:53,272
Hello my Anjali? - No sir, beggar Anjali. My mom sir

892
01:21:54,133 --> 01:21:54,910
Why isn't she talking?

893
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,560
She's dumb, she can't talk. My mom sir

894
01:22:00,094 --> 01:22:01,907
Yes sir. What Sir

895
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:05,391
I melted, you should be lucky - I see

896
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:10,292
At least you have your mother with you. My mom left me

897
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:11,660
Where did she go, sir?

898
01:22:12,786 --> 01:22:18,759
When I was hurting that driving car, that idiot took my wife

899
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:22,752
Lord, oh no! - Do you know him by any chance? Tell

900
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:27,192
Sir, I have no idea who he is. But I have a car driver as a roommate.

901
01:22:27,418 --> 01:22:29,409
Shall I call and find out, sir?

902
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:31,468
By any chance, is he the same guy?

903
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:35,685
Come on mister, that guy hates girls

904
01:22:36,374 --> 01:22:38,795
I'll do one thing, sir. I'll call and find out if it's him

905
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:41,839
So it's not him. I'll make one call, sir

906
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:43,850
No, just a phone, sir

907
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:46,725
I said no and no. Rascal! - Oh no!

908
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:49,178
Here is today's collection sir

909
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:57,474
There is one more bad debt and your goal will be reached if you collect even that

910
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:59,137
should I give? - Please give the number

911
01:23:02,071 --> 01:23:04,938
This boy speaks very arrogant, dear

912
01:23:05,368 --> 01:23:07,347
Somehow you should collect from this fellow

913
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:11,801
Hello - Izaz Khan - Yes

914
01:23:12,269 --> 01:23:17,495
You have a package, from Hong Kong - Hong Kong, from whom?

915
01:23:17,704 --> 01:23:20,074
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan - What's Inside?

916
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:24,522
It is very heavy and I think it is an iron box. An iron box?

917
01:23:25,108 --> 01:23:27,023
Where are you? - Do you know Char Bungalow?

918
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:33,526
Go straight, then turn right, then make a U-turn. You have a dead end there

919
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:36,443
They found me right there - OK

920
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:43,778
Hey, who did you tell the address to? - Brother, to the parcel guy

921
01:23:45,044 --> 01:23:46,903
Who sent it? -Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan

922
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:49,978
It's been 20 years since he died, rascal

923
01:23:51,497 --> 01:23:53,109
That may be a police trap, why did you say the address?

924
01:23:53,309 --> 01:23:55,651
I thought you were my relative, brother. He said he'd be here in two minutes, brother.

925
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:22,823
Hello welcome to my world

926
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:28,630
Hey, God always showers at his best and I love it.

927
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,930
I miss you - Who is Ijaj Khan here?

928
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:39,086
It's me, what idiot? - we will talk

929
01:24:39,328 --> 01:24:44,726
Hello mental, when I'm talking here, why are you talking to him?

930
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:48,846
I came to recover, idiot. I'm going to take it now

931
01:24:49,737 --> 01:24:55,219
You don't understand something. Not that you take it, but I'll kill you, now

932
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:57,782
okay now what? - Give me, my Anjali

933
01:24:58,609 --> 01:25:00,199
Take your idiot, I need this guy

934
01:25:19,672 --> 01:25:24,591
If you got the guts kill me and take Anjali

935
01:25:43,228 --> 01:25:46,455
Hey, where's the credit card? Where is the debit card?

936
01:25:47,288 --> 01:25:49,164
Let me - Come on, get it out

937
01:25:49,364 --> 01:25:52,094
Take out the card. What is the PIN? - 52 - 52 - 5292

938
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:02,778
Yes, I have kissed. Yes!

939
01:27:06,674 --> 01:27:08,270
You made my life

940
01:27:12,372 --> 01:27:15,255
At the request of the public, once again

941
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:23,203
Dirty rascal!

942
01:27:49,981 --> 01:27:52,776
Blood, he has seen my blood. Brother, don't leave this guy.

943
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:56,635
Kill, kill this rascal right here. Kill, come on, kill the idiot

944
01:28:16,736 --> 01:28:21,177
A gangster was killed in the shootout between the psycho and the police and another gangster was injured.

945
01:28:21,377 --> 01:28:24,250
Encounter specialist Radha Mohan completes her Century

946
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:28,540
Century is over but the psycho has escaped. Won't that psycho get caught?

947
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:32,444
You unnecessarily came between Sir, otherwise I would have finished him off.

948
01:28:32,644 --> 01:28:36,799
What to finish rascal, give me the license or you? You…

949
01:28:38,332 --> 01:28:40,463
Anjali, have coffee

950
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,166
You will be with me? Promise!

951
01:28:50,544 --> 01:28:55,758
Sir, ask him to come in. - What scoundrel, you come to my house and ask my wife to enter?

952
01:28:56,421 --> 01:29:00,273
Sir, at least tell her to come in. He says the same thing again.

953
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:07,359
Relax, relax! Darling, take this Anjali inside - Come

954
01:29:09,525 --> 01:29:12,175
What is the name of the trapped boy? - Gandhi

955
01:29:12,465 --> 01:29:14,690
What, the criminal's name is Gandhi? - Yes

956
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:16,763
The bad time has begun

957
01:29:24,212 --> 01:29:28,158
You are in love? - I think so

958
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:34,450
There would be so many elephants in the forest. But the rogue elephant just stays apart

959
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:41,398
He doesn't get along with others. He seals off the entire forest when he goes berserk

960
01:29:43,225 --> 01:29:48,658
Making such a mischievous elephant fall in love is something else

961
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:54,549
He is not a human to fool like everyone else, he is an animal

962
01:29:55,971 --> 01:29:58,758
You shouldn't let go when you find such an animal

963
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:02,955
I got lost, don't get lost

964
01:30:03,545 --> 01:30:08,058
I don't know what you did, but it has turned against women.

965
01:30:09,098 --> 01:30:11,115
She is using foul language against the type of woman.

966
01:30:12,172 --> 01:30:15,007
Let him scold, even her scolding would sound good

967
01:30:16,109 --> 01:30:21,531
Hey, listen carefully. You urgently take this girl and leave the city, somewhere

968
01:30:22,285 --> 01:30:25,803
Nobody knows what she does and when... Where should I take her now, sir?

969
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:29,995
She go somewhere, man. I'll call after I kill him and then you can get her back

970
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:39,095
The gift given to us by the Calcutta police is the party by force.

971
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:46,347
Nature is very dangerous. Some strange people get along when it rains elsewhere

972
01:30:46,897 --> 01:30:51,027
It adds to the mood of this very positive girl. That's my tension

973
01:30:57,637 --> 01:30:58,503
What happened?

974
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:04,311
Did you say full tank? -She swallowed it

975
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:07,300
Like now? - You know how to walk, right? - Yes

976
01:31:09,762 --> 01:31:13,359
Hello, waterfall! Let's go

977
01:31:16,165 --> 01:31:20,141
Anjali! I will not come to that place

978
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:22,271
Come on friend, let's go. Come

979
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:26,371
Such a beautiful place - You move in and I'll come - OK

980
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:32,859
Yes!

981
01:31:41,549 --> 01:31:44,695
Hey, you saw it, right? Let's go

982
01:31:47,013 --> 01:31:48,591
You do not like me? - Nope

983
01:31:49,177 --> 01:31:50,835
Don't you feel like being here? - Nope

984
01:31:51,141 --> 01:31:55,063
Oh wait a minute. Do you have any backstory on this location?

985
01:31:55,281 --> 01:31:58,767
Yes, he had come with that lady. In that store

986
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:09,152
In the tent? What did you do? What did you do in the store?

987
01:32:09,685 --> 01:32:11,779
Why won't it happen when we stay here for three nights?

988
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,127
Hey, why are you crying?

989
01:32:19,773 --> 01:32:24,262
You, why are you crying? - Won't we cry when we get a second hand?

990
01:32:24,462 --> 01:32:28,447
Ma'am, there are no show room vehicles here. They are all second hand

991
01:32:33,981 --> 01:32:40,567
OK! I can't swim and I don't know what happens if I jump too

992
01:32:42,212 --> 01:32:43,055
I miss you

993
01:32:52,653 --> 01:32:54,838
Hey, why did you cry and why did you jump?

994
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:58,531
Why don't you speak? You're deaf

995
01:33:01,517 --> 01:33:08,327
Why are you so beautiful today? - Even a pig looks good when wet

996
01:33:08,537 --> 01:33:12,192
Nerd! There is something in your eyes: there is nothing

997
01:33:12,497 --> 01:33:14,659
Hey, look, what's there?

998
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:18,423
Something is pulling. Even the lips are cool

999
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:23,823
Come on, sing a song, my voice sounds horrible

1000
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:26,623
I want to hear the same - Hey, rascal! Hey!

1001
01:33:37,033 --> 01:33:46,123
"The first trance has been slowly overwhelmed because of you"

1002
01:33:47,153 --> 01:33:55,779
"When you're giving rise to sweet and spicy pleasure"

1003
01:34:02,273 --> 01:34:10,887
“The tender romantic rain drenched my heart”

1004
01:34:12,057 --> 01:34:19,220
"When it touched me like a raindrop"

1005
01:34:22,297 --> 01:34:30,115
"The first trance has been slowly overwhelmed because of you"

1006
01:34:53,073 --> 01:35:00,179
"When romance is driving from tapas to dreams and from dreams to heaven"

1007
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:02,881
"My heartbeat is getting disturbed"

1008
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:12,267
"It boiled once like heat and made me shiver again."

1009
01:35:12,902 --> 01:35:22,339
"It's a war inside me, is your love the victory?"

1010
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:30,743
"The first trance has been slowly overwhelmed because of you"

1011
01:36:03,789 --> 01:36:13,267
“When new signals and music are born at the same time, the celebrations begin”

1012
01:36:13,525 --> 01:36:17,907
"Is your dearest call a dream or a reality?"

1013
01:36:18,461 --> 01:36:22,907
"How to know if this is imagination or some magic"

1014
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:32,931
"I am the body and you are the life"

1015
01:36:33,593 --> 01:36:44,431
"The first trance has been slowly overwhelmed because of you"

1016
01:36:54,469 --> 01:36:55,347
Oh no!

1017
01:36:58,072 --> 01:36:58,935
Who are you, man?

1018
01:37:02,592 --> 01:37:03,887
Hello hello sir

1019
01:37:07,936 --> 01:37:10,823
How is your mom? - Well sir, well

1020
01:37:13,797 --> 01:37:18,235
Why didn't you tell me that Anjali is staying here?

1021
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:20,455
I didn't think it was that girl, sir

1022
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:31,335
Hi Bablu, is this your aunt's bed? - Yes

1023
01:37:38,514 --> 01:37:41,419
Hi, shut up guys! Your aunt is great, honey.

1024
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:49,640
Hi Bablu, am I marrying your aunt? - OK dude

1025
01:37:53,905 --> 01:37:56,547
Where will I go for my honeymoon? - Ooty - Ooty?

1026
01:37:58,433 --> 01:38:01,675
Is it better for me and my aunt to give birth to a boy or a girl? - Little girl

1027
01:38:05,117 --> 01:38:07,575
How will I call her? - Shakeera - Shakeera?

1028
01:38:09,956 --> 01:38:12,911
Will you marry my Shakeera? - I will, uncle

1029
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:16,791
So where are you going for your honeymoon? - Switzerland - Switzerland?

1030
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:25,205
Cutie Pie! Idiot, Ooty for me and Switzerland for me?

1031
01:38:25,405 --> 01:38:27,415
Do you think I'm a crazy guy, rascal?

1032
01:38:29,077 --> 01:38:31,384
Hello, everyone calls me a psychopath. But this guy is the psychopath.

1033
01:38:31,703 --> 01:38:38,640
He is psycho. Say rascal, he's not asking what marriage is. But will you go on your honeymoon?

1034
01:38:39,042 --> 01:38:40,979
Hello mental, what is this guy? He he knows everything

1035
01:38:41,814 --> 01:38:44,302
Hey, why did you put my glasses on?

1036
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:46,772
Give him the gun, man

1037
01:38:48,466 --> 01:38:49,767
Hello little psycho - Oh no!

1038
01:38:50,134 --> 01:38:51,614
Say where did your aunt go

1039
01:38:51,814 --> 01:38:54,830
The police sent guys from the house across the street, some where

1040
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:56,324
Where? - I do not know

1041
01:38:57,793 --> 01:39:00,764
for honeymoon? - What's honeymoon, man?

1042
01:39:03,642 --> 01:39:08,608
Who said that children are like gods? Look, look at our idiot son

1043
01:39:08,898 --> 01:39:11,886
hey! Hey, go away - No!

1044
01:39:13,905 --> 01:39:15,266
Hey shut up

1045
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:32,175
Hey, what are you doing? - Fishing, we are fishing

1046
01:39:32,889 --> 01:39:35,116
For dinner, we are fishing

1047
01:39:41,561 --> 01:39:47,104
I had to eat fish curry and sleep with another girl in the same tent

1048
01:39:50,377 --> 01:39:55,680
We should tell the truth, this girl is much better than my ex

1049
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:06,827
Oh no dog! - What happened?

1050
01:40:08,697 --> 01:40:14,136
I'm afraid of dogs. Dog bit me in childhood

1051
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:19,280
It didn't bite you now, did it? You are unnecessarily tensing

1052
01:40:20,174 --> 01:40:25,291
All dogs don't bite. - I also say the same, sir

1053
01:40:26,826 --> 01:40:30,387
Not just dogs but all girls don't bite

1054
01:40:47,605 --> 01:40:49,846
Don't lay down your hand with your old habits

1055
01:40:59,017 --> 01:41:01,293
Psycho says he don't rest until he gets Anjali

1056
01:41:01,493 --> 01:41:04,995
Will psychopaths really love? Do you know about love?

1057
01:41:05,405 --> 01:41:10,322
We have the famous psychiatrist Mr. Veera Bhadra Rao to talk to us about this.

1058
01:41:11,588 --> 01:41:12,354
Tell…

1059
01:41:16,666 --> 01:41:19,839
I don't know Mr. Veera Bhadra Rao, what is psycho?

1060
01:41:20,434 --> 01:41:24,832
Someone who is mentally unstable and affected by psychosis.

1061
01:41:25,697 --> 01:41:27,108
Psycho: yes

1062
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:33,411
Idiot, I do not understand psychopath and why do you say psychosis?

1063
01:41:33,814 --> 01:41:36,096
They have a mental lord, they don't know when and how to behave

1064
01:41:37,501 --> 01:41:40,514
Yes, correct point. What he said is correct, yes sir

1065
01:41:40,714 --> 01:41:45,183
Hey - No - Quiet, is this correct?

1066
01:41:54,211 --> 01:42:00,708
What did you say? Did you say that psychopaths don't know how to love?

1067
01:42:02,738 --> 01:42:06,828
Can you see my eyes, see how much I loved Anjali? My anjali

1068
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:13,263
Kolkata police have hidden my Anjali

1069
01:42:15,105 --> 01:42:22,896
Hello Commissioner, I will not leave any Anjali in the city until I get my Anjali.

1070
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:28,464
I will not leave any Anjali small, big, young and old.

1071
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:34,460
All the world! What's your name? - Srivatsav

1072
01:42:34,726 --> 01:42:37,471
Her full name - Anjali Srivatsav

1073
01:42:38,209 --> 01:42:39,116
Anjali!

1074
01:42:42,966 --> 01:42:43,971
Come on, move

1075
01:42:45,497 --> 01:42:47,275
Hello my daughter!

1076
01:42:47,761 --> 01:42:56,731
Facebook.com! Anjali, Kolkata! I need all the Anjalis on this list

1077
01:43:05,173 --> 01:43:11,591
I remembered the boys, Anjali Devi. Beggar, I mean her mother-Beggar, yes

1078
01:43:12,121 --> 01:43:13,015
Bring even her

1079
01:43:29,301 --> 01:43:31,519
It's me, Anjali speaking Mrs. Saraswathi

1080
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:39,291
The whole state is very disturbed. Parents and relatives of missing women are concerned

1081
01:43:39,617 --> 01:43:40,547
They are in protests - We want justice

1082
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:42,586
Calcutta police are on the lookout: we want justice

1083
01:43:42,786 --> 01:43:44,613
But, no news so far

1084
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,402
Where are you, man? - I'm in the forest

1085
01:43:46,602 --> 01:43:48,345
Come urgently to the city - Why sir?

1086
01:43:48,815 --> 01:43:52,251
That psycho is kidnapping every Anjali in town. Come quickly

1087
01:43:52,451 --> 01:43:57,417
Sir, the encounter specialist informed me that he would kill me and that I should come back.

1088
01:43:57,983 --> 01:44:00,085
I'm waiting for the call, here. My foot!

1089
01:44:00,802 --> 01:44:04,405
That psycho has kidnapped his wife, I mean even my sister.

1090
01:44:09,272 --> 01:44:13,540
You're handsome. But I hate your idiot husband, I'll kill him

1091
01:44:14,654 --> 01:44:19,454
Where is he and where are you? You are so Beautiful

1092
01:44:21,059 --> 01:44:25,069
Can I dance with you? No problem please come

1093
01:44:25,395 --> 01:44:27,785
Fear not, I'll show you how to do it. Go Go

1094
01:44:44,554 --> 01:44:49,711
Why man, why is your mama Anjali Devi not getting up?

1095
01:44:49,911 --> 01:44:54,389
I mean, she has joint pain. Mother!

1096
01:44:55,407 --> 01:44:59,013
Ask him to get up and sit next to you and that's enough

1097
01:45:02,444 --> 01:45:03,689
Call - Come on, idiot

1098
01:45:06,327 --> 01:45:08,546
no call mom

1099
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:17,838
Brother, this is not mummy but fool

1100
01:45:18,144 --> 01:45:21,462
Was it you who put that doll? - Yes sir - Why?

1101
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:27,198
Concept! My whole intention is to change the begging system.

1102
01:45:30,068 --> 01:45:33,768
I liked your idea, thank you. It's a great idea

1103
01:45:34,148 --> 01:45:40,504
She put a mask on this doll, made her sit on the road with great love, begging for money

1104
01:45:40,704 --> 01:45:42,707
and he is thinking of changing the whole system

1105
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,598
Idiot - The language has changed!

1106
01:45:45,823 --> 01:45:52,302
You showed this idol and told me as a mom. You said and added that she is dumb

1107
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:58,018
You make me cry. What? How do I see you, rascal?

1108
01:45:59,776 --> 01:46:02,993
Come on, say: brother, don't feel bad

1109
01:46:03,723 --> 01:46:08,945
But he thinks of you as a fool: do you show an idol and say like mom, rascal?

1110
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:11,965
Rascal! You're dead now - Oh no!

1111
01:46:15,991 --> 01:46:21,903
The kidnapping of so many women with the same name without age limit is recorded in the records of the Guinness book

1112
01:46:22,103 --> 01:46:25,169
Real Anjali wanted by Psycho is now live

1113
01:46:25,691 --> 01:46:28,843
Hi Psycho! You are listening?

1114
01:46:29,426 --> 01:46:30,400
Brother, he comes on TV

1115
01:46:30,963 --> 01:46:38,516
You! Anjali you need is with me. Don't hurt others

1116
01:46:39,802 --> 01:46:43,440
Call me. I'll take her where you tell me to bring

1117
01:46:45,019 --> 01:46:49,281
My number scrolls on TV. You can see? Call me

1118
01:46:49,555 --> 01:46:50,649
Call that number guys

1119
01:46:53,922 --> 01:46:57,493
The doctor came from America. I showed him the reports of his patients

1120
01:46:57,979 --> 01:47:00,925
He says to urgently talk to you: he is not raising brother

1121
01:47:02,486 --> 01:47:07,489
The doctor said that his legs will work operating. But, you have to deposit 10 faults at this time

1122
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:09,223
I don't have that much money with me now, sir

1123
01:47:09,432 --> 01:47:11,393
The doctor returns to America on the night flight again

1124
01:47:12,101 --> 01:47:17,815
If you can arrange it within an hour, I'll talk to the doctor and confirm the schedule.

1125
01:47:21,327 --> 01:47:25,042
Hey, I'm at the hospital, hang up. Hey, shut up! Hey!

1126
01:47:26,172 --> 01:47:29,382
I will not give you money without collateral. That's my policy

1127
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:31,731
Do you have a guarantee?

1128
01:47:32,084 --> 01:47:34,413
I collected so many millions for you. You will not believe me?

1129
01:47:34,718 --> 01:47:37,113
I won't believe it, dear. Business are business

1130
01:47:45,043 --> 01:47:48,373
I want ten lakh rupees dad, I have to operate on her brother

1131
01:47:49,023 --> 01:47:50,952
I came to you because I had no other way

1132
01:47:51,482 --> 01:47:56,497
I always thought of you as a dumb guy, but I never thought you were so responsible.

1133
01:47:57,687 --> 01:48:00,697
I am very happy as you are doing a lot for them.

1134
01:48:01,155 --> 01:48:05,313
But this poor father has nothing but my pension

1135
01:48:06,619 --> 01:48:09,929
I haven't saved anything, son. Ask your mom if you have to

1136
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:18,461
Who are you doing all this for, son? Are you in love with this girl by any chance, son?

1137
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:22,589
Hey, why are you hanging around these houses when they ask you to go with him?

1138
01:48:23,487 --> 01:48:26,551
There are 42 members with him. Even my wife is there in them.

1139
01:48:26,751 --> 01:48:28,965
Sir, I urgently need ten lakhs. Would you give me?

1140
01:48:29,387 --> 01:48:33,477
Why would I give, man? Kill him and get the reward

1141
01:48:36,524 --> 01:48:39,556
Hey... Hey, I'm in some money arrangements.

1142
01:48:39,756 --> 01:48:40,829
I'll fix it and I'll call you, hang up

1143
01:48:41,029 --> 01:48:42,817
How much do you need, man? - I need ten fouls

1144
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:46,451
I'll give it to you if you ask me, right? - Will you really give me?

1145
01:48:46,809 --> 01:48:48,518
Will you get Anjali? -Where should she go?

1146
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:51,636
Come to Shyam Bazar. Get on the tram running

1147
01:48:51,868 --> 01:48:53,551
Come on, hey...

1148
01:48:53,889 --> 01:48:56,435
Psycho seemed like a god to me at the time

1149
01:48:58,096 --> 01:49:00,843
I felt that God came to me in the form of Psycho

1150
01:49:02,252 --> 01:49:03,862
I got on the tram together with Anjali

1151
01:49:15,556 --> 01:49:19,082
How did you believe when I said give?

1152
01:49:22,764 --> 01:49:24,234
How do I see you, man?

1153
01:49:52,825 --> 01:49:55,322
Why you stopping me, man? Let me kill my friend

1154
01:50:02,601 --> 01:50:06,739
Let me kill you Friend - Give me ten then stab

1155
01:50:07,928 --> 01:50:10,914
What? - Give me ten and then stab

1156
01:50:15,228 --> 01:50:18,367
Can I stab if I give ten? - Yes

1157
01:50:20,637 --> 01:50:22,555
Really? - Yes

1158
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,243
You are not going to do anything? - Nope

1159
01:50:26,516 --> 01:50:29,215
Promise! - Hey, I hate promises.

1160
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,875
What promise, rascal?

1161
01:50:32,766 --> 01:50:35,327
You know what, Friend? You're a bigger psycho than me

1162
01:50:36,316 --> 01:50:37,779
Hello Chirag - Yes brother

1163
01:50:38,228 --> 01:50:40,375
How much money do you have in your house? - 1 lakh

1164
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:43,838
pull the chain

1165
01:50:45,065 --> 01:50:47,915
Come on, your problem is solved

1166
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,315
Hey, evict. Leave the money and get out

1167
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,273
let's go fast

1168
01:50:54,473 --> 01:50:57,587
I didn't feel bad when there was a robbery before my eyes

1169
01:50:58,133 --> 01:51:00,919
His brother's legs should improve and that's my goal

1170
01:51:01,329 --> 01:51:02,243
let's go fast

1171
01:51:02,764 --> 01:51:04,555
move move

1172
01:51:06,852 --> 01:51:08,580
Hey, hands up! - Wave

1173
01:51:08,828 --> 01:51:10,673
Hands up - Lord, one minute

1174
01:51:11,718 --> 01:51:13,628
I asked you for money and you didn't give me

1175
01:51:14,114 --> 01:51:18,898
He said give and gave five. He is fixing another five. Just go away for half an hour

1176
01:51:19,098 --> 01:51:22,230
What to leave, idiot? Hey, put the gun down, let's go gun down

1177
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:24,992
We can shoot even without holding it down. You see it…

1178
01:51:34,382 --> 01:51:36,095
move move

1179
01:51:42,627 --> 01:51:44,692
Hey move - shut up

1180

This is the dance bar, right? - Yes sir

1181
01:51:54,448 --> 01:51:58,930
The girls dance here and they all shower money, why aren't they here now?

1182
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:00,895
That's at night sir, not now

1183
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,405
Yesterday's night collection... Where is the night collection?

1184
01:52:03,605 --> 01:52:06,935
Tent has taken it. Boss took it, huh?

1185
01:52:08,372 --> 01:52:12,347
Dammit! I don't really understand a thing

1186
01:52:13,652 --> 01:52:15,855
Why should I give you money, man?

1187
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,803
Hey let's kill this guy

1188
01:52:31,293 --> 01:52:34,619
Hey idiot, don't you have a character?

1189
01:52:34,853 --> 01:52:37,231
Hello Ijaj, kill this rascal - Give him ten then stab

1190
01:52:51,245 --> 01:52:54,199
Hello brother - You - Hey, I have an idea. Wait wait!

1191
01:52:54,881 --> 01:52:56,786
Hello, all the ladies are with us, right?

1192
01:52:57,156 --> 01:52:59,267
Yes brother, do they have gold chains or not?

1193
01:53:01,096 --> 01:53:05,009
Yes brother. Cut everything, sell them in Marwadi and come to our place.

1194
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,342
Quick, okay!

1195
01:53:09,786 --> 01:53:13,361
Thief, thief, catch the thief. No, he is running away

1196
01:53:20,278 --> 01:53:21,251
The money is ready brother

1197
01:53:21,451 --> 01:53:24,532
Hey put extra 150 rupees on top of ten missing rupees

1198
01:53:24,807 --> 01:53:25,813

1199
01:53:32,251 --> 01:53:35,877
Here's your ten, man. I stand on the word

1200
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:38,576
I gave it in an hour, just an hour

1201
01:53:39,519 --> 01:53:42,128
Don't you dare talk about my character anymore

1202
01:53:43,447 --> 01:53:47,121
I have a character, idiot. Will you keep your word?

1203
01:53:49,235 --> 01:53:51,757
Go to the hospital and pay money. And you?

01:53:52,112 --> 01:53:54,386
I will come, you go - No

1205
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:05,662
Can I stab? - Yes

1206
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,606
You won't say anything, right? - Nope

Nope!

1210
01:55:00,715 --> 01:55:02,345
Why are you stopping me, Friend?

1211
01:55:03,051 --> 01:55:06,225
You stabbed, right? - Wish to stab for ten times

1212
01:55:06,876 --> 01:55:11,590
What did I stay? I said give ten and stab

1213
01:55:12,396 --> 01:55:16,558
You gave and stabbed. Agreement made - No!

1214
01:55:17,708 --> 01:55:20,287
This is cheating, Dude You don't have a character

1215
01:55:20,487 --> 01:55:22,563
I don't have a character, idiot?

1216
01:55:34,767 --> 01:55:36,513
Go, go and pay the money

Hey, why are you crying idiot? Why cry for him?

1220
01:56:40,842 --> 01:56:43,325
I'm fighting for you and you're crying for him

1221
01:56:43,615 --> 01:56:45,392
Crying for him, crying for him? - hey!

1222
01:56:46,734 --> 01:56:49,341
Don't hit her, idiot. I'll kill you psycho you idiot

1223
01:56:49,794 --> 01:56:56,504
Hey, why do you care? You said you weren't in love with her, right?

1224
01:56:56,846 --> 01:56:58,972
Hey, Friend, do you really love her?

1225
01:56:59,266 --> 01:57:03,044

1226
01:57:03,398 --> 01:57:04,592

Izaz! - Come on - Hello

1228
01:58:22,443 --> 01:58:25,090

01:58:40,083 --> 01:58:43,885
Hey brother! - Leave

Hey don't hit

1232
01:59:31,743 --> 01:59:34,313
Why, why did you save me Friend?

1233
01:59:35,768 --> 01:59:39,754
You called me Friend knowingly or unknowingly

1234
01:59:43,048 --> 01:59:46,520
I'm not a guy to kill a friend, I love you Friend

1235
01:59:48,206 --> 01:59:49,424
I need a hug

1236
01:59:58,482 --> 02:00:00,225
Is that the encounter specialist?

1237
02:00:05,502 --> 02:00:08,233
I hate kolkata police

1238
02:00:09,538 --> 02:00:11,220
That guy needlessly killed this guy

1239
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:14,393
I don't really have anger with this psycho

1240
02:00:15,438 --> 02:00:17,093
This boy did me no injustice

1241
02:00:17,815 --> 02:00:21,381
I reached out to that girl when this guy walked into my life

1242
02:00:21,991 --> 02:00:24,976
He is the reason for me to fall in love again

1243
02:00:25,621 --> 02:00:29,745
Murali will rejoin police duty in four days. That family is happy

1244
02:00:30,247 --> 02:00:34,449
I said goodbye to everyone. But I didn't understand what to say with Anjali

1245
02:00:38,991 --> 02:00:44,501
hey! - I can't make any promises. I don't know how long I'd be with you

1246
02:00:45,175 --> 02:00:48,401
If you feel like this moment is our whole life, come on

1247
02:00:56,002 --> 02:00:58,404
This is my second hand love story

1248
02:00:59,254 --> 02:01:08,052
"I have fallen silent in your love"

1249
02:01:08,486 --> 02:01:13,350
"This Love Effect Is Crazy"

1250
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:18,428
"I found out that this is the effect of appearance"

1251
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:43,352
"The world seems different to me now"

1252
02:01:43,722 --> 02:01:48,096
"It feels like this in the colors of love"

1253
02:01:48,610 --> 02:01:53,288
"Everything Changed While I Watched"

1254
02:01:53,658 --> 02:01:58,456
"In love we both become one"

1255
02:02:04,270 --> 02:02:13,696
"I have fallen silent in your love"

1256
02:02:29,402 --> 02:02:33,640
"A day in so much loneliness"

1257
02:02:34,266 --> 02:02:38,648
"One day we will end lives in love"

1258
02:02:39,126 --> 02:02:43,990
"Ask for what you want, but these moments never come back"

1259
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:49,044
“We will live full in the love of the other”

1260
02:02:59,716 --> 02:03:09,426
"I have fallen silent in your love"

1261
02:03:09,839 --> 02:03:19,981
"Hello love, how can you be away from me?"
