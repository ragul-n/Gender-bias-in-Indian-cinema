1
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:15,930
One who chants the name ol
God will always be happy.

2
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,933
Let us sing in praise
ol the pure Lord.

3
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:26,942
Those who believe in Him
are always victorious.

4
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,355
Catch him. l want
him alive.

5
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,470
Both were killed brutally.

6
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,475
One couldn't get even
a shroud.

7
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,479
This will be the plight ol
evey Indian soldier...

8
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,485
...who will dare to
delend me.

9
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:37,494
Friends, let's see, who dares
to stop our growing terrorism.

10
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,491
Kashmir, the crown ol India...

11
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:46,503
...is a heaven to evey
Indian.

12
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,502
We will convert it to hell.

13
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:56,513
Lile will become dear and
death cheap in Kashmir.

14
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:03,520
Shagur, my brother, this is
your mission.

15
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,521
All your instructions are
written here.

16
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:13,529
We are the sons ol the
same mother.

17
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,531
lndia spreads the message
ol peace throughout the world.

18
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:26,545
We will pile up corpses there
and make it get sullocated.

19
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,544
You have to accomplish
this mission.

20
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:35,550
l've done wonders in all
my missions till today.

21
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:47,569
l swear, l will excel in
this mission also.

22
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,565
You too will have to rise
up, Usman.

23
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:58,575
My actions speak louder
than my words.

24
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,574
Remember Wale Khan, this
time, entire India...

25
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:06,581
No need to remind me,
brother.

26
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,580
Entire India will
remember me.

27
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,586
Get this thought embedded
in your mind.

28
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,592
Then pull up your socks
to accomplish your mission.

29
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,595
Spread unrest throughout
the county.

30
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:27,603
We should hear mourning
voices eveywhere.

31
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,605
l can't tolerate the melody
ol Shehnai.

32
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:53,688
Come on, we have to reach
Vaishno Devi belore dusk.

33
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,691
The bus won't stop anywhere.
Madam, sit carelully...

34
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,695
Hury up, we've no time.
We've to reach there by dawn.

35
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,798
We've to linish oll the
M.L.A.

36
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,800
...blow oll a lew bridges.

37
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:53,808
We've to reach Kargil
belore night. Hury up.

38
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,879
Where are you?

39
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,899
Don't kill me. Have
mercy on me.

40
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:26,897
Please spare me alive.

41
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,900
A Rajput never spares
the lile ol an enemy.

42
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:34,910
Don't shoot. l am not
at lault.

43
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,912
After all, we belong to
the same brethren.

44
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,925
You will get one chance.
Look at this, English coin.

45
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,927
Head or tail?
Head.

46
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,948
You uttered the words
ol my heart.

47
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,956
He is Minister Vir Bhadra
Singh, alias Raja Sahab.

48
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,960
Three years ago, during the
luneral ol Major Rathod...

49
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:33,970
...colonel Balbir Singh Sodi
had attacked him.

50
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,971
An year ago, once again
he was attacked.

51
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,975
But he escaped due to
his good luck.

52
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,975
He was not present in
that vehicle.

53
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,977
What do you wish to say?

54
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:51,987
Look here.

55
00:18:52,048 --> 00:19:03,003
He is a replica ol colonel
Sodi. His name is Dadabhai...

56
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,000
...alias Devraj Hathoda. He
lives in this city only.

57
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:12,006
This is where he stays.

58
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:16,009
ln the same place, he owns
a Hammer lactoy also.

59
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,009
This is his prolession.

60
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,011
Though his name is Dadabhai,
he is not a hooligan.

61
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:24,017
The colony people treat him
like a messenger ol God.

62
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,017
Both the good and bad
are scared ol him.

63
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,019
He was sympathetic
with the poor.

64
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:33,027
Even in police records, he is
a respected man.

65
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,024
But l...

66
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,031
You suspect that he
may be Sodi.

67
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:42,035
Raja Sahab is the Chiel
Minister ol that state now.

68
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,035
...sacrilice my lile to
arrest this traitor.

69
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,041
The aim ol my lile is to
linish oll all these traitors.

70
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,047
Listen to me carelully.

71
00:19:56,112 --> 00:20:02,057
The mission you've to go is
not in the border...

72
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:06,059
...but it is a civil area.
You've to enlorce control...

73
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:10,063
...on both your words
as well as your bullets.

74
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:15,069
Did you lollow?
Yes sir.

75
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:24,078
Colonel Sodi's habits and other
details are there in this lloppy.

76
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,127
Balbir Singh had no
relatives.

77
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,129
He has a wile and a
daughter.

78
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,132
He does not smoke.
He hates alcohol.

79
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,135
He takes tea without sugar.

80
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:28,142
He is a man ol lew words.
He never gets angy.

81
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:32,145
Rascal, you can't escape
lrom me today.

82
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:50,177
Don't know, after whom
is this Dadabhai today.

83
00:21:50,227 --> 00:22:01,181
You can't save yoursell
lrom me, today.

84
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:15,198
Sitting on a lan rascal?

85
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:19,192
You've troubled me a lot.
Today, you're sure to die.

86
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:24,198
Saw Dadabhai's Pyjama, and it's
plight? Saw my shoes?

87
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,210
You're hungy and naked.
Thought me also to be like you?

88
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:42,216
l'll lix you properly.
Wait...Stop...

89
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:52,225
Catch him...Catch...

90
00:22:56,293 --> 00:23:01,236
Was this gimmick,
just to catch a rat?

91
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:06,241
Came to watch lun here?
Go and mind your own work.

92
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:09,242
A gentleman has come
to meet you.

93
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:12,245
Who is he? l don't
recognize him.

94
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,248
l have come lrom
Kitply company.

95
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,251
My younger brother is
working there.

96
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:22,256
He is not working there.
Then...

97
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,260
l've been sent by the boss
to inlorm you about this.

98
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,258
Boss gave Chotu and Sweety a job
due to your recommendation.

99
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,261
But they haven't joined
duty till today.

100
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:34,269
Evey morning he tells me
that he is going to Ollice.

101
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:38,272
l've come to tell you
that only.

102
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:42,276
He has been taking my jeep
since the last eight days.

103
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,276
He also takes money lor
5 liters ol petrol lrom me.

104
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:48,282
He takes the jeep and money
lor 5 liters ol petrol?

105
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:52,286
What type ol job is
he doing?

106
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:53,347
Oh! my love, you are a
No.1 girl.

107
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,347
l am a No.1 boy.

108
00:24:55,412 --> 00:25:02,359
My answer is you and
your answer is me.

109
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:16,372
Oh my love! l am a No.1
girl and you're a No.1 boy.

110
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:22,378
My answer is you and
l am your answer.

111
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,415
l'll remember all your
actions.

112
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,418
You too will remember mine.

113
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:09,423
You're intoxicated due
to your youth.

114
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:15,431
Come back to your senses.

115
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:33,448
You'll drown
in my looks.

116
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:42,457
ll you tease me,
you will be in trouble.

117
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:50,468
Let me dellate your ego
and make you senile.

118
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:09,488
Looks like our lriendship
will continue lorever.

119
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:13,487
Let me be embraced
by you.

120
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:19,495
l hope l don't kiss you.

121
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,548
Looks like Dadabhai is
not at home.

122
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,551
lt is a real lun to
stay alone.

123
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:22,556
You needn't lear anyone
nor can anyone restrict you.

124
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:26,560
You are your own master.

125
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:29,562
You can even sleep naked.

126
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,563
lt is indeed a lun to
sleep naked.

127
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:37,573
You're on the right track.
You will do me good.

128
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:44,581
No, no, l was just joking.
Please, pardon me.

129
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,580
You are my eveything.

130
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,583
Othe_ise whom do l
have in this big city?

131
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,586
Had you not ollered me a
shelter like an elder brother...

132
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,591
...l would've been
on streets now.

133
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:00,593
You say this and exploit
my weakness.

134
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:05,600
You know, l can't punish you,
as you'll leave me and go away.

135
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:09,603
No. l can never do
such a thing.

136
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:15,611
Then why don't you
obey me?

137
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:16,607
You roam with your pals
in Suleman's jeep.

138
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,610
You don't go to work and get
involved in a mess daily.

139
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,612
Have you ever thought
about your lile?

140
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:24,618
Without hard work, no one
will help you here.

141
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,620
From today, l will
obey you.

142
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:31,625
l won't even touch
Suleman's jeep.

143
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,625
l will go to work and
come home straight.

144
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,635
But never think that l will
Ieave you and go away.

145
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:45,641
Even my own brother can't
Iove me as you.

146
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:49,643
l assure you that l won't give
you a chance to complain about me.

147
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:04,660
Come here. l get moved
by your tears.

148
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,662
Go and have your lood.

149
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:16,672
Good that l saw you here.
l was just coming to meet you.

150
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,672
Did you come to tell me that
Chotu hasn't taken your jeep today?

151
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,678
How can he? He has
promised me.

152
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,678
But, even then...
Why do you intrude in the middle?

153
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:30,684
Yesterday night, l
advised him nicely.

154
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,684
He promised to behave properly
hencelorth. He's a good boy.

155
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,688
His grasping power is
vey last.

156
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:39,693
But...
What but...?

157
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:43,697
He won't even ask lor a
torn tyre lrom you.

158
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,707
Listen, today he has
taken my motor cycle.

159
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:56,712
What?
- And money lor 5 liters ol petrol.

160
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:02,718
Went with a motor cycle?
- With money lor 5 liters ol petrol.

161
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:10,724
Where does he go with
that money?

162
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,742
How did l lall
in love?

163
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:33,749
What's happened is
lor good.

164
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,747
Neither l know...

165
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,751
What is this nonsense?
This is robbey.

166
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:42,756
lt's ecstatic to kiss
each other stealthily.

167
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,759
You can't tolerate to see
anyone happy.

168
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:52,767
You purchase a ticket in
the last moment and come.

Now watch the lilm

170
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,769
Are you in a mood
to lay a bet?

You can get back the
money ol your tickets.

172
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:00,771
What is the bet?

173
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:04,778
Can you see that bald man
sitting in lront ol you?

174
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,780
Tap once on his head
and you get Rs.1001-.

O.K. what a lunny lellow!

179

Will you tap once again?

180
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:57,832
Don't do it. It'll prove
dangerous.

181
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,840
Did you think me to
be a rural man?

182
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:10,844
l was the Head Master ol the
School where you studied.

183
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,844

ol your bet with them?

184
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:16,848
Stop acting smart, O.K.?

00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,854

hooligan.

Sit behind.

188
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:02,897
Wait...
No one will touch him.

189
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:07,902
He has challenged me.
So, l'll deal with him.

190
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:09,901
No...

191
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,936
These days, you've made lile
troublesome lor people.

192
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,943
Thought the theatre to be
your lather's garden?

You better mind your

Whether l am a teacher
or a sharp shooter...

201

...you'll come to know
about it soon.

But l don't have money...

No...
Let it be.

220
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:55,127
We have a nice way to deal
with empty pockets here.

221
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,126
Look Madam...
Shut up...

222
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:59,131

Inspector...

...you can't arrest me here

00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:11,143
Are you related to a Kingpin?
Nothing like that.

00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:15,148
Presume that without paying
tax lrom Kiran's police station...

228
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:19,152
...none can release you other
than the God ol death.

Wish to lay a bet
with me?

230
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,162
You look like a pauper
party's leader.

231
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,163
Laying a bet with me,
who takes bribes?

232
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:36,170
Pardon me, but only real
Ieaders have money...

233
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:40,173
...though they belong to a
pauper party. Look here...

235
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:53,188
You look innocent, but in

Sometimes my battey
goes down.

241
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,233
By touching someone,
it gets recharged.

242

cum- press reporter.

243

discharged battey pop in now?

246
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:08,265
So, Mr. B.B.C., why do you keep

00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,266
God knows, lrom where

249
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:19,274
He is eating with his mouth
but is shaking his back.

250
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:23,277
Please sit down.

251
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:31,286

While passing by train, l saw

253
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:44,300
...and l couldn't resist that
sight. So l jumped lrom the train...

254
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:49,300
...and clicked your snaps.
l liked your style a lot.

255
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:53,307
You and actor Sunny Deol

00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,311
You're absolutely right.

00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:18,334
...will appear with
the other snaps.

260
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:21,334
You taking bribes.

261
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:26,341
The other one is inside.

262
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,346
Do you intend to blackmail me?

263
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,349
What do you think ol
yoursell?

264
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:41,356
l'm not Lady Diana to get panicked
by cheap journalists like you.

265
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:44,357
l am Lady Kiran.

266
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:48,362
Don't ty to challenge me.
l am a dangerous person.

With a Bengali Sari, you'll
Iook more dangerous.

268
00:41:55,432 --> 00:42:02,379
This lellow seems to be
a real man.

269
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:08,384
Othe_ise how could he talk
like this with a Police?

270
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:12,386
Madam, Dadabhai is coming.

271
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:16,390

No, he is Dadabhai.

272

ls he your brother?
He's a kingpin ol this city.

273
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,392
Then we'll settle our
scores later. Bye bye.

274
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:25,400
Looks like we will clash
here only.

275
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:10,444
But what was the need
lor you to come here?

276
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:16,452
You could've phoned me.
Pandu, release him.

277
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:20,454
Had he laid a bet
with you?

278
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:25,460
Then take out your money,
Madam. You've lost the bet.

279
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:29,463
Hey! where are you running?

280
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:34,469
You know, l never return the
money, l've won in a bet.

281
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,468
See, he ran away again.

282
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:39,472
Looks like, you've pampered
him a lot.

283
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:43,477
Actually, he is my
only weakness.

284
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,479
That rascal knows that
l love him a lot.

285
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:51,486
So he exploits my
weakness.

286
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:56,491
Saw how he laid
a bet with you?

287
00:43:56,553 --> 00:44:01,496
How much did he take?
Rs.15001-.

288
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:05,499
Take these Rs.15001-.

289
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:11,507
How can l take money
lrom you?

290
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:14,507
But that money was
not mine.

291
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:17,510
Then whose was it?

292
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:21,515
Think it to be God's money.

293
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:24,517
lt makes no dillerence il
he takes it or l.

294
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:27,520
Then give my money back.

295
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:37,534
What is happening there?
Is anyone dead?

296
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:41,534
A bomb has been planted inside
the station.

297
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,537
Along with the lock up,
policemen will also die.

298
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:49,544
You will die and make
me die too.

299
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,546
Help...

300
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:56,611

...all your illicit activities
will not come to the lime light.

00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:13,630
Tying to act smart with me?

303
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:18,633
This rascal had kept a
bomb in the police station.

304
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:23,638
Nab him. Bastard...

305
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,641

What are you doing?

310
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:07,683
When my battey goes down, by
touching someone, l get recharged.

311
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:11,685
l have heard that only car
batteries get discharged.

312
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:16,691
First time, l hear a man's
battey getting low.

313
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:21,696
This hair ol yours

How?

317
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:38,713
Hooligans chased me thinking

But l can't lollow how you
got attached to bombs.

328
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:30,764
The way you ran with a bomb
today in the police station...

329
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,764
...makes me leel that you
are well versed with bombs.

330
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:38,774
As he was a Bihari rogue, l
went to click his snap.

331
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:43,778
l saw a bomb there and got scared
that it might explode.

332
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:49,785
l showed my guts in that
vulnerable situation.

333
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:55,791
But your hands are like
iron, like an army man's hands.

334
00:48:55,852 --> 00:49:03,801
Aren't you scared ol bombs?
Our stories are alike.

335
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,805
l am called a kingpin though
l am not involved in gundaism.

336
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:13,807
Along with this, ''hammer'' is
also attached with my name.

337
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:19,815
How can l get scared with
these titles?

338
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:23,817
l want to take your interview.
Do you have a visiting card?

339
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,821
There is no need ol a card.

340
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:31,825
Utter my name to a rickshaw
driver, police man or taxi driver.

341
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:38,835
He will leave you at my
doorstep, understand?

342
00:49:38,895 --> 00:49:42,836
l lorgot, take this, O.K.
l will go now.

343
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:56,851
He gets annoyed a lot.
He smokes bidi also.

344
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:06,861
Does he take sugarless tea
and speak less?

345
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:13,867
ln my interview do you want
my place ol birth...

346
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:18,873
...names ol my parents,
how l came to this city?

347
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:25,882
Give me two cups ol tea
made lrom pure milk.

348
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:29,883
Mr. B.B.C. wants to take
my interview.

349
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,893
Be quick. Suleman, can
you see my interview?

350
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:51,906
My snap will come in the
paper tomorrow. Isn't it?

351
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:56,911
l know what you're going
to ask me.

352
00:50:56,973 --> 00:51:02,918
Listen to what l say.
Maulvi brother, come here...

353
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:06,920
Look, he is taking
my interview.

354
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:11,926
Takes these 2 cups ol rich
lresh tea lor you.

355
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:16,931
Poor tea lor the rest
ol them.

356
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:21,936
Rich tea means, more
milk and less water.

357
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:25,939
Poor tea means...
More water And less milk.

358
00:51:26,002 --> 00:51:32,949
No. There is only the smell
ol milk in water.

359
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:37,952
How much sugar lor you?
One spoon.

360
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:49,963
Do you take less sugar?

361
00:51:57,033 --> 00:52:01,976
l take a lot ol sugar.
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 spoons...

362
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:08,985
Look this is a standing
spoon in a tea cup.

363
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:12,986
l need more sugar.

364
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:38,011
This barbarian will
die ol diabetes.

365
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:43,017
He can never be Colonel
Sodi who talks so much.

366
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:50,024
How are you, Mr.B.B.C?

367
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:55,029
l know, what you are
thinking about.

368
00:52:55,091 --> 00:53:00,034
l make a lot ol noise.
Don't l?

369
00:53:00,096 --> 00:53:04,037
ln Uttar Pradesh, we drink
tea like this only.

370
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,043
l can't drink tea like
people living in a city.

371
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:13,046
l can't sip tea like a rat.

372
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:20,056
The real lun ol taking tea
is in how l drink.

373
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:24,057
How can you enjoy a
dance recital...

374
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,059
...without hearing the noise
ol bells in the ankles?

375
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:30,062
Who is he?

376
00:53:30,126 --> 00:53:33,065
A press reporter taking the
interview ol Dadabhai.

377
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:37,070
But today he will speak
so much that the...

378
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:39,070
...press reporter will be
glued to the cot.

379
00:53:39,135 --> 00:53:49,088
Now listen to my stoy.

380
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:51,082
ls someone dead?

381
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:53,084
There is a wedding in my
opposite house.

382
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:56,088
One more lellow has got
entangled in this trap.

383
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:59,091
Listen Munna. Stop playing
your music.

384
00:53:59,155 --> 00:54:02,094
My interview is in progress.
The tape can't catch my voice.

385
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:07,101
l am in a hury. l have to
go lor shopping.

386
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:12,106
Shopping lor the wedding
ol Balwant?

387
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:14,105
No, lor a luneral.

388
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,107
Hey! Who died?
Ramu uncle.

389
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:18,109
Buying things lor a luneral is
shopping lor younger generation.

390
00:54:18,174 --> 00:54:21,113
l have to go to Ramu's
house immediately.

391
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:24,116
Can't you take my interview
on some other day?

392
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,119
The day after tomorrow
is my birthday.

393
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:31,124
They celebrate nicely.
You too can join us.

394
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:35,128
Today, l have to go there.
O.K. Bye bye.

395
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:57,151
He gets annoyed, takes sugar
in his tea and also smokes.

396
00:54:57,214 --> 00:55:02,156
Now l need his linger
prints.

397
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:38,189
Looks like he was naughty
lrom his childhood.

398
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:39,189
What dirty snaps has he
clicked? Where is he?

399
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:42,194
This is a matter ol
my choice.

400
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:07,222
Your muscles are indeed
good.

401
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:10,223
Looks like you are vey lond
ol exercise.

402
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:14,228
Only sometimes, l do
exercise.

403
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:18,232
l had clicked a lew
snaps ol Salman Khan.

404
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:22,236
Since then l too was tempted
to do exercise.

405
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:28,244
He gave me all these tools to
exercise. He is a nice boy.

406
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:35,249
l have come here in a Bengali
Sari and he didn't see that.

407
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:38,251
He has been raving
about Salman Khan.

408
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:41,254
This police lady must be
thinking that...

409
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:43,255
...she has come in Bengali
sari and l am ignoring her...

410
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,257
...and talking nonsense.

411
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:50,265
But she looks lovely in
this Bengali sari.

412
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:56,270
Are you thinking ol
something?

413
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,274
No. We police think less
and act more.

414
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:03,276
Looks like my respect
is in danger.

415
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:07,281
Looks like her intentions
are not good.

416
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:12,287
Drive her out or else your
mission will remain incomplete.

417
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:17,292
Looks like you too are
thinking...

418
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:21,295
You've come to take your
snaps. Here they are.

419
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,303
Salman's muscles are
bigger than mine.

420
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:34,310
ll you stick his snap in your
house, you'll get motivated.

421
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:36,308
What can l do with this
down battey?

422
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:42,318
When l am praising about his
muscles, this lool...

423
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:44,316
...he is busy talking about
Salman. Looks like...

424
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:47,320
...l only will have to
hook him.

425
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:50,323
Lile is like a lover.

426
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:04,340
Today is your birthday.
So, you are born again.

427
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:18,357
Wow! what a nice couplet
was this. Listen to me also.

428
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:21,354
Let me hear.

429
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:27,363
l am a bhaiya lrom Banaras.

430
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:34,371
l can make anyone dance
to my tunes.

431
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:47,382
Once you get intoxicated,
you will remain so...

432
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:52,387
...with my stull.

433
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:57,392
l am your lan.
Your talks lure me.

434
00:58:57,454 --> 00:59:02,397
There are several lovers here.

435
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,467
Some are lair while
others are dark.

436
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:32,486
None can surpass me.
l am a unique person.

437
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:37,492
You're jolly and
l am carelree.

438
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:42,496
Our lriendship is
quite lamous.

439
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,502
Both ol us are mad
with love.

440
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,513
Let's create a conlusion.

441
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:01,513
Don't do like that,
my brother.

442
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:10,583
Flute...

443
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:17,594
When we rise up with
passion...

444
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:27,603
...the air will be lilled
with lun and lrolic.

445
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:34,611
They'll be awe struck
by our move.

446
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:39,614
We will prove ourselves.

447
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:42,615
We will change the scene
in a jil_.

448
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:46,620
We will make people lose
their senses...

449
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:50,624
When the curtain will rise...

450
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:54,628
...then none will be
exposed.

451
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:08,705
Move aside.
B.B.C. is coming.

452
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:12,706
l don't want a lift.
l will go on my own.

453
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:16,710
Where?
Yes.

454
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:20,714
Be carelul.

455
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:27,724
Do you know the way?
Yes.

456
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:38,739
Just tell me the way
to go home.

457
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:46,744
A bullalo will be
standing there.

458
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:50,744
Salute the statue ol
Gandhi and sit in a taxi.

459
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:56,752
O.K. You may go now.
What happened?

460
01:04:56,813 --> 01:05:02,758
Today is your birthday.
Yes.

461
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:07,762
Shall say a couplet?
Why not?

462
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:13,769
You'll neither make it
wet nor dy.

463
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:18,773
Rascal, don't cy.

464
01:05:18,835 --> 01:05:20,772
l will make this ill prayer
lor you.

465
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:22,774
Wow! What a style ol
saying a couplet.

466
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:28,784
One who hears this will
automatically reach Howrah bridge.

467
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:33,788
Hey! It should be
said like this.

468
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:35,787
Neither will l accuse
nor will l complain.

469
01:05:35,852 --> 01:05:38,791
May you live long. This
will be my prayer to God.

470
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:42,796
l said the same thing.

471
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:50,804
O.K. You may go now.

472
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:50,868
Oh God! Where will l go?
Both are calling me.

473
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:57,874
You are great God! Your
mercy is beyond words.

474
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:41,915
l am Brigadier
Bedi speaking.

475
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:45,919
Dadabhai and Balvir have
no habits in common.

476
01:07:45,982 --> 01:07:50,925
Even their linger prints
do not match.

477
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:54,928
l don't know what to do.
No Sir, the basic problem is...

478
01:07:54,991 --> 01:08:02,940
Please come in.

479
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:09,946
What nonsense are you
talking?

480
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:14,949
With whom are you talking?
My creative editor.

481
01:08:15,011 --> 01:08:19,954
As he can't lollow Bengali,
l've to talk in Hindi.

482
01:08:20,016 --> 01:08:27,965
Why are you seducing me?

483
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:31,965
Evey now and then you come
here wearing a sari.

484
01:08:32,028 --> 01:08:37,973
But l like you. So
l come here.

485
01:08:38,034 --> 01:08:41,975
l just don't like you.
Don't like me? You're mad.

486
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:42,973
You are an idiot. Don't
know, what he is up to.

487
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:47,982
Listen. Il l don't make
you love me, then...

488
01:08:48,044 --> 01:08:51,985
...l will change my name.

489
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:14,006
What is the reason lor
this trallic jam?

490
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:18,011
Some Minister might be
going.

491
01:09:18,074 --> 01:09:20,011
He wouldn't have even
started lrom his house.

492
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:26,021
They are called as people's
representatives.

493
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:29,021
But they're unaware ol the
sullerings ol the public.

494
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:31,022
You're vey correct.

495
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:33,024
These days, there is no dillerence
between democracy and capitalism.

496
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:35,026
l have heard ever since my
childhood that whenever...

497
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:40,034
...sins increased on earth, a
messenger was born to destroy them.

498
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:41,094
Looks like one more is dead.

499
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:45,098
He is Balvir Singh. Nab him.

500
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,283
Let us sing in praise
ol the great God.

501
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:22,319
Nanak redeems us ol
OUf sOffOWs.

502
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:29,326
May your grace be
there on me.

503
01:14:38,395 --> 01:14:45,342
lt is my good lortune that
l could come to a Gurudwara.

504
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:50,345
l am separated lrom my
near and dear ones.

505
01:15:53,470 --> 01:16:00,417
Belore l lose my eyesight,
Iet me look at you.

506
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:29,444
Be mercilul with me.

507
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:41,456
Let me wash oll my sins
at your leet.

508
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:46,641
He has been chasing
me in this city...

509
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:49,642
...and is waiting lor
an opportunity.

510
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:56,651
You've openly said to the world
that Balvir Singh is dead.

511
01:19:56,713 --> 01:20:03,660
Rise up Commissioner. Il you're
asleep even now...

512
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,663
...then hang a picture ol Balvir
and mine on your wall...

513
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:13,668
...so that it will constantly
remind you that...

514
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:19,674
...your death is in my hands.

515
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:22,675
Balvir Singh's death will make
you remain alive.

516
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:37,693
Why are you spoiling your health
by scolding the policemen?

517
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:43,697
Who is speaking?
Balvir Singh Sodi.

518
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,701
You're still not dead. Belore
that how can you keep quiet?

519
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:53,709
l will accept death the day l
chop you to pieces...

520
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:59,715
...and oller them to the
vultures with my own hands.

521
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:07,725
Traitor's blood don't run through
my veins lor the vultures to least.

522
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:15,729
Remember one thing nicely.

523
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:18,731
Those who come back alive after
death lead a wretched lile.

524
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:27,743
Then, he can neither die,
nor kill anyone easily.

525
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:43,758
Whenever you addressed me
as Chotu, l lelt that...

526
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:49,763
...l am grown up now. Why are
you still calling me as Chotu?

527
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:55,771
But today, l have realized
that you're indeed great.

528
01:22:00,837 --> 01:22:04,778
Address me as ''Chotu''
all my lile.

529
01:22:04,841 --> 01:22:11,788
l will never complain. Today
l've seen your true lorm.

530
01:22:11,848 --> 01:22:14,787
Don't ty to hide it
lrom me.

531
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:19,794
l have seen eveything
with my own eyes.

532
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:22,795
l've also learnt eveything
lrom your wile.

533
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:25,798
Do you know that your daughter's
having a heart ailment?

534
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:30,805
She badly needs a surgey.
They don't even have money.

535
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:34,808
They are staying in that
Gurudwara only.

536
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:38,812
l have just now admitted
Pinky in a hospital.

537
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:43,818
Please come with me.

538
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,821
But what was the need lor
you to come here?

539
01:22:47,884 --> 01:22:51,825
Earlier, l have conducted several
operations on your one word.

540
01:22:51,888 --> 01:22:53,825
But not even once have l
called you here.

541
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:57,831
We usually send the bill
to you later.

542
01:22:57,894 --> 01:23:04,841
Bear in mind that this child
is vey dear to me.

543
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:09,844
Appoint more doctors il needed,
but save her lile.

544
01:23:09,906 --> 01:23:14,849
Don't wory. Nothing will
happen to her.

545
01:23:36,933 --> 01:23:39,872
Mother...

546
01:23:41,938 --> 01:23:44,877
My child.

547
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:57,891
Oh! my God! please
save my child.

548
01:23:57,954 --> 01:24:03,899
One who bestows child to
a childless parent...

549
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,901
...please save my child.

550
01:26:02,078 --> 01:26:09,025
How is my child?

551
01:26:09,085 --> 01:26:14,028
Why are you quiet?
Is my Pinky alright?

552
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:19,033
l am sory. l could not
save Pinky.

553
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:32,045
Didn't l tell you that you
should save her at any cost?

554
01:26:32,108 --> 01:26:37,051
Call lor any number
ol doctors...

555
01:26:37,113 --> 01:26:41,054
But you disobeyed me.
You killed that poor child.

556
01:26:41,117 --> 01:26:48,064
l won't spare your lile.
l will kill you.

557
01:26:48,124 --> 01:26:53,067
How can you kill me lor the
lile ol an unknown girl?

558
01:26:53,129 --> 01:26:58,072
Who knows lrom where they come
to get operated on charity?

559
01:26:58,134 --> 01:27:02,075
No, she came to get operated
here as my daughter.

560
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:22,095
Don't become sentimental
as an army man.

561
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:26,099
This is the right punishment
lor your sins.

562
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:31,105
Perhaps my child was
punished lor your sins.

563
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:36,110
Since her childhood she was
branded as a traitor's daughter.

564
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:43,119
A heart ailment also attacked
and killed her.

565
01:27:43,179 --> 01:27:47,120
l will never lorgive you.

566
01:27:47,183 --> 01:27:52,126
Nothing is wrong with your
child, Mrs.Sodi.

567
01:28:01,197 --> 01:28:06,140
The drama is over now.
No, it has just started.

568
01:28:19,216 --> 01:28:22,154
Want to become a D.l.G?

569
01:28:22,219 --> 01:28:26,159
First learn to perlorm the
duties ol a Commissioner nicely.

570
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:30,163
ln my rule, in this vey
city, evading eveyone...

571
01:28:30,227 --> 01:28:34,167
...he is hiding as
Dadabhai.

572
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:39,173
You all are hovering round and
praising him all the time.

573
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:44,178
But Sir, you...
- l don't want to listen.

574
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:48,181
l will listen to only one
news lrom you...

575
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:53,187
...and that would be the news
ol the death ol Sodi.

576
01:29:16,273 --> 01:29:22,218
Did you say that the drama
has just started?

577
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:28,224
Evey time it starts, l will
raise and lower the curtain.

578
01:29:38,295 --> 01:29:45,242
With the help ol an innocent
child, you have not arrested...

579
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:51,247
...an army man, but a
lather, Ajit Aya.

580
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:54,247
This is not a big achievement.

581
01:29:54,311 --> 01:29:58,252
When l gave you a check mate
with your own coin...

582
01:29:58,315 --> 01:30:01,254
...you got humiliated.

583
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:06,261
Army men lace death courageously.
They are not cowards.

584
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:12,268
That is true lor army men,
not lor traitors like you.

585
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:32,344
Come with me.

586
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:36,350
Let's continue the
light later.

587
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:39,352
Colonel is hiding a lot ol things.
We should make him conless.

588
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:40,351
He is a real crook.

589
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:42,354
l will arrange to send him
to the Head Ouarters, tomorrow.

590
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:45,358
l will take him to the
Head Ouarters.

591
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:49,363
l have made complete arrangement
lor security.

592
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:51,363
Please permit me to take him.

593
01:31:51,428 --> 01:31:55,369
You often get excited and lose
your sell control.

594
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:57,369
This was a drama to make him
blurt out the truth.

595
01:31:57,434 --> 01:31:59,371
l have understood your move
vey well.

596
01:31:59,436 --> 01:32:03,377
As l have started this, permit
me to complete this mission.

597
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:19,394
Are you married?
Yes sir.

598
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:22,395
Are you married?
No sir.

599
01:32:22,459 --> 01:32:23,394
Then do one thing.
Yes sir.

600
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,395
You have accomplished your
mission.

601
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:32,410
Take leave and get married
to a nice girl.

602
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:38,414
That will relax your mind.
Understood?

603
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:44,420
But who will mary this moody
and egoistic lellow?

604
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:48,422
Our county is in need ol
such short tempered ollicers.

605
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:52,426
Perhaps he may also get
a girl ol his type.

606
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:32,466
She looked so innocent in
her childhood. But now...

607
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:47,480
Are you going out somewhere?

608
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:50,483
No, l mean after your bath...

609
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:54,488
As my job is over, l am
going tomorrow.

610
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:57,490
l thought ol returning the
negatives ol your snaps.

611
01:33:57,554 --> 01:34:01,495
Don't presume these army
men to be innocent.

612
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:05,499
They pretend to be innocent
but are real crooks.

613
01:34:05,562 --> 01:34:09,503
Look, how he has come
so well dressed...

614
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:13,507
But l like him with
his beard only.

615
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:16,509
Without his beard he
resembles a rogue.

616
01:34:16,573 --> 01:34:19,512
He is madly in love with
a police woman.

617
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:23,517
Negatives were just a
reason to meet me.

618
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:26,519
Are you thinking about
something?

619
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:31,526
Militay men think less
and work more.

620
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:34,527
Looks like he has come
here lully prepared.

621
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:38,532
ll he really loves me, then
under the prete_ ol...

622
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:42,536
...asking lor a soap, l will
call him inside the bathroom.

623
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:45,538
ll he brings it, then he will
get hooked. Yes! or else...

624
01:34:45,602 --> 01:34:55,555
No. When l have not asked lor
anything why this ''no'' now?

625
01:34:55,612 --> 01:35:00,555
Today l won't permit you to
go away after giving the negatives.

626
01:35:00,617 --> 01:35:06,562
Please sit lor ten minutes. l will
have a bath and come soon.

627
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:17,572
Wow! What a bomb is she.

628
01:35:17,634 --> 01:35:21,575
With one explosion, l will
get lixed.

629
01:35:21,638 --> 01:35:25,579
Today l will express
my leelings.

630
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:28,581
The whole regiment will go
haywire, il l am successlul.

631
01:35:28,645 --> 01:35:32,586
Wow! What a beautilul wile
does Ajit have...yes!

632
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:36,590
l didn't say a word and
you are saying yes?

633
01:35:36,653 --> 01:35:44,602
l mean, l will have tea and
go. Have your bath leisurely.

634
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:49,604
This army has gone
bonkers over me.

635
01:36:19,696 --> 01:36:22,635
Ajit, l have lorgotten the
soap outside.

636
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:31,650
l am in the bath tub now.

637
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:36,651
Will you get me my soap?
It's lying near you.

638
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:40,654
Today this lady is going
to take you in remand.

639
01:36:40,717 --> 01:36:45,660
Let it be. Il she is in
police, then l am in the army.

640
01:36:45,722 --> 01:36:50,665
l too know to conduct
a court martial.

641
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:04,680
Ready lor operation ''washing''
and that too militay washing.

642
01:37:04,741 --> 01:37:08,682
lt is the best and whitest
wash.

643
01:37:32,786 --> 01:37:36,760
Have l gone mad
due to love?

644
01:37:56,810 --> 01:38:02,788
Don't know, what has
happened to me.

645
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:10,794
Oh boy! You're a
lire cracker.

646
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:15,800
Oh girlie! You're
an explosion.

647
01:38:15,829 --> 01:38:22,809
Both your hearts
are young.

648
01:38:22,836 --> 01:38:27,812
You peeped into my
heart.

649
01:39:04,878 --> 01:39:07,850
As you're glued there,
where will you go now?

650
01:39:07,881 --> 01:39:15,863
Ever since l've seen you,
have l lost my sleep.

651
01:39:15,889 --> 01:39:18,861
You're intoxicated due to
Iove and l'm unallected.

652
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:23,868
You're a big liar and
have llicked my heart.

653
01:39:57,931 --> 01:40:02,907
Your coquettish habits
will drive me cray.

654
01:40:02,936 --> 01:40:07,912
You've mesmerized me
with your love.

655
01:40:07,941 --> 01:40:12,917
l've hooked you with me
and won the game ol love.

656
01:40:12,946 --> 01:40:17,922
Promise me that you'll
Iove me deeply.

657
01:40:57,991 --> 01:41:02,967
My heart beats at the
sight ol you.

658
01:41:02,996 --> 01:41:07,972
l will love you a lot.

659
01:41:08,001 --> 01:41:12,977
You're a magnet pulling
me towards you.

660
01:41:13,006 --> 01:41:15,978
You've made lile dillicult
without lood or water.

661
01:41:16,009 --> 01:41:18,981
You've given me such a
jolt that...

662
01:41:19,012 --> 01:41:20,982
...my heart is in my mouth.

663
01:41:21,014 --> 01:41:23,986
Wow! What a jolt ol

664
01:41:24,017 --> 01:41:26,989

l am telling you the truth.
l like you a lot, Ajit.

666
01:41:31,024 --> 01:41:37,002
Will you mary me?

667
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:41,004
Why are you quiet?

668
01:41:41,034 --> 01:41:46,010
Looks like the police woman
has melted in the bathroom.

669
01:42:10,063 --> 01:42:16,041
You're in militay and l am in
police. We'll have 2 kids.

670
01:42:23,076 --> 01:42:30,056
One will be in militay
and the other in police.

671
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:39,067
Please come...
- No, l've already had my bath.

672
01:42:39,092 --> 01:42:43,066
As such the nation's
plight is vey bad.

673
01:42:43,096 --> 01:42:48,072
Army and police should
work together.

674
01:43:42,155 --> 01:43:45,127
Have a cigarette?

675
01:43:45,158 --> 01:43:49,132
Sory, have a bidi in
your cigarette packet?

676
01:43:49,162 --> 01:43:54,138
Dadabhai's real choice...

677
01:43:56,169 --> 01:44:01,145
Don't you have...
Have you stopped smoking?

678
01:44:11,184 --> 01:44:21,170
Have you even stopped
talking too?

679
01:44:21,194 --> 01:44:27,172
Mr. Hammer, there is no use
ol keeping quiet.

680
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:33,178
You will be treated with so
much respect in the place...

681
01:44:33,207 --> 01:44:36,178
...where we are going that even
a dumb man will start singing.

682
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:38,179
l am a bhaiya lrom Banaras.

683
01:44:38,212 --> 01:44:43,187
Shall l make the spoon
stand?

684
01:44:43,217 --> 01:44:49,194
Have you stopped sipping
tea loudly?

685
01:44:49,223 --> 01:44:54,198
You're an expert in
Ieaving things.

686
01:44:54,228 --> 01:44:59,204
Today you've left this. Earlier
you had deserted your lamily.

687
01:44:59,233 --> 01:45:02,205
lt was a limit belore that.

688
01:45:02,236 --> 01:45:06,210
You gave up your duty, loyalty
and became a traitor.

689
01:45:08,242 --> 01:45:12,216
l am not a traitor.

690
01:45:12,246 --> 01:45:16,220
ll you wish to know the
reality then...

691
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,220
...stop control your tongue
and listen.

692
01:45:18,252 --> 01:45:24,230
This is not a drama but
a real stoy.

693
01:48:40,454 --> 01:48:44,428
This is impossible. You're
unable to understand.

694
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:46,428
This is a militay allair.

695
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:49,432
Till today, l've solved
all your problems.

696
01:48:49,463 --> 01:48:53,437
Be it lor election or to linish
a person in politics.

697
01:48:53,467 --> 01:48:59,445
Remember, who spreads
terrorism in this county?

698
01:48:59,473 --> 01:49:03,447
Better understand as l am not
used to making people understand.

699
01:49:03,477 --> 01:49:07,451
You've to release the 4 ol
them at any cost.

700
01:49:07,481 --> 01:49:11,455
My younger brother Shagur
is also one ol them.

701
01:49:11,485 --> 01:49:14,457
He is vey precious to me.

702
01:49:14,488 --> 01:49:18,462
l can't accord to lose him.

703
01:49:18,492 --> 01:49:22,466
But...
Nothing doing.

704
01:49:22,496 --> 01:49:23,464
lt is your responsibility
to release the lour ol them.

705
01:49:23,497 --> 01:49:28,473
l've been a joker in all
your games until now.

706
01:49:28,502 --> 01:49:33,478
But today in this game...

707
01:49:33,507 --> 01:49:36,479
Enough. Don't utter a word
now. Listen carelully.

708
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:40,484
Whenever Raja Sahab plays a
game...

709
01:49:40,514 --> 01:49:46,492
...he keeps the ace ol spades
with him. And in this game too...

710
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:50,494
...the ace will remain with me.

711
01:49:56,530 --> 01:50:00,504
Pick her up.

712
01:50:00,534 --> 01:50:04,508
Leave me.

713
01:50:10,544 --> 01:50:14,518
Terrorists kidnap Minister's
daughter.

714
01:50:14,548 --> 01:50:19,524
Today's hot news. Minister's
daughter kidnapped by terrorists.

715
01:50:19,553 --> 01:50:24,529
Cabinet Minister Veerbhadra
Singh's daughter has been...

716
01:50:24,558 --> 01:50:28,532
...kidnapped by terrorists
lrom her college ground.

717
01:50:28,562 --> 01:50:30,532
ln return they want the
release ol lour terrorists.

718
01:50:30,564 --> 01:50:32,534
These 4 were arrested by our
brave army.

719
01:50:32,566 --> 01:50:36,540
This situation has taken
a serious turn now.

720
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:40,544
Working Committee will meet at
Delhi tomorrow to decide.

721
01:50:40,574 --> 01:50:45,550
You're a senior cabinet
minister.

722
01:50:45,579 --> 01:50:49,553
Your lamily is renowned
lor its patriotism.

723
01:50:49,583 --> 01:50:55,561
Pardon me. This patriotism,
social service, all these words...

724
01:50:55,589 --> 01:50:58,561
...sound nice as long as
they're in books.

725
01:50:58,592 --> 01:51:05,572
Now you tell me. Other than
you and a lew senior politicians...

726
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:08,571
...is there anyone in today's
political lield who...

727
01:51:08,602 --> 01:51:13,578
...believes and acts on these
principles?

728
01:51:13,607 --> 01:51:17,581
Today politics has become
a prolession.

729
01:51:17,611 --> 01:51:21,585
lt means that the sacrilice
ol our soldiers in that mission...

730
01:51:21,615 --> 01:51:24,587
...was a total waste.

731
01:51:24,618 --> 01:51:27,590
Don't compare my daughter
with the army soldiers.

732
01:51:27,621 --> 01:51:30,593
At any cost, lor the sake ol
those lour terrorists...

733
01:51:30,624 --> 01:51:33,596
...l can't sacrilice
my daughter.

734
01:51:33,627 --> 01:51:38,603
Looks like Gandhiji's words
might come out true.

735
01:51:38,632 --> 01:51:44,610
Only statues are made ol such
Ieaders who sacrilice their lives.

736
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:50,615
Once an year they're cleaned
and garlanded. Rest ol the time...

737
01:51:50,644 --> 01:51:55,620
...birds oller their respect
on them.

738
01:51:55,649 --> 01:51:58,621
l've not come here to listen
to your speech.

739
01:51:58,652 --> 01:52:02,626
l want a decision and
that too in my lavor.

740
01:52:02,656 --> 01:52:06,630
This is outright blackmailing.
Presume it that way.

741
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:09,632
l want my daughter
alive at any cost.

742
01:52:09,663 --> 01:52:12,635
ll something happens to her,
then presume that...

743
01:52:12,666 --> 01:52:15,638
...this coalition government
is sure to lall.

744
01:52:15,669 --> 01:52:19,643
l have 30 M.Ps with me.

745
01:52:19,673 --> 01:52:22,645
Your govt. is running
on their strength.

746
01:52:22,676 --> 01:52:25,648
Think this as my verdict
and not a warning.

747
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:28,651
All know that once Veer Bhadra
Singh has given his verdict...

748
01:52:28,682 --> 01:52:31,654
...he'll never change that.

749
01:52:31,685 --> 01:52:33,655
What have they decided
in your meeting?

750
01:52:33,687 --> 01:52:36,659
Nothing has been decided
till now.

751
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:40,664
But l've given him
my verdict.

752
01:52:40,694 --> 01:52:45,670
Even il l had 10 daughters, l'll
sacrilice all ol them lor my county.

753
01:52:45,699 --> 01:52:50,675
l've sworn to linish oll all
the terrorists in our county.

754
01:52:50,704 --> 01:52:53,676
Under these circumstances, il
Ieaders like us will bow down...

755
01:52:53,707 --> 01:52:57,681
...then what will happen to the
people ol this county?

756
01:52:57,711 --> 01:53:00,683
What happened to the
decision ol the committee?

757
01:53:00,714 --> 01:53:04,688
At the moment, l can't
say anything.

758
01:53:04,718 --> 01:53:08,692
We will second our high
command's decision.

759
01:53:08,722 --> 01:53:11,694
ln the kidnapping case ol the
Home Minister's daughter...

760
01:53:11,725 --> 01:53:14,697
...there was a sudden turn
today.

761
01:53:14,728 --> 01:53:17,700
Due to this political
activities increased.

762
01:53:17,731 --> 01:53:20,703
ln the working committee
meeting, it was decided...

763
01:53:20,734 --> 01:53:24,708
...in absence ol Raja Sahab
that...

764
01:53:24,738 --> 01:53:29,714
...the 4 terrorists should be
relieved in place ol his daughter.

765
01:53:29,743 --> 01:53:35,721
A report in this conte_
lrom our Delhi correspondent.

766
01:53:35,749 --> 01:53:39,723
Can you tell us, who is the hero ol
this game played behind the curtain?

767
01:53:39,753 --> 01:53:42,725
Anything can happen
in politics.

768
01:53:42,756 --> 01:53:45,728
But there is a wild rumor
in Delhi that Raja Sahab...

769
01:53:45,759 --> 01:53:48,731
...is threatening to bring
down the government.

770
01:53:48,762 --> 01:53:52,736
This matter will not be
disclosed till tonight...

771
01:53:52,766 --> 01:53:54,736
...because those 4 terrorists
will be released tonight...

772
01:53:54,768 --> 01:53:57,740
...and Bharti will return
home.

773
01:53:57,771 --> 01:53:58,739
Bharti's return will
remain a secret lorever.

774
01:53:58,772 --> 01:54:02,746
Manoj Bajpai, New Delhi
Aaj Tak.

775
01:54:18,792 --> 01:54:20,762
Wait. Where are you going?

776
01:54:20,794 --> 01:54:22,764
ls the Minister inside?

777
01:54:22,796 --> 01:54:26,770
When l was about to go to his house
l realized that he is here.

778
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,772
When he is sick, he comes here
to rest. No one can meet him.

779
01:54:29,803 --> 01:54:32,775
Whatever you say l will meet
him today.

780
01:54:32,806 --> 01:54:36,780
You can't go inside
at any cost.

781
01:54:44,818 --> 01:54:48,792
Don't know when will our
blind public recognize...

782
01:54:48,822 --> 01:54:52,796
...the real lorm ol traitors
like you.

783
01:54:52,826 --> 01:54:58,804
You were giving big speeches
during TV interviews.

784
01:54:58,832 --> 01:55:02,806
Even il l had 10 kids, l
would've sacriliced...

785
01:55:02,836 --> 01:55:06,810
...all ol them lor the sake
ol this county.

786
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,810
And eveything turned
in just one day?

787
01:55:08,842 --> 01:55:14,820
Released those lour rascals in
return lor your daughter's lile?

788
01:55:14,848 --> 01:55:18,822
l am ashamed to lace dirty
Ieaders like you.

789
01:55:18,852 --> 01:55:20,822
You're crossing your
limits, Major.

790
01:55:20,854 --> 01:55:26,832
When a soldier is angy,
he will lost his sell control...

791
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:29,832
...and even enter inside
his enemies territoy.

792
01:55:29,863 --> 01:55:32,835
Know how many Indians
did they kill?

793
01:55:32,866 --> 01:55:35,838
How many women became
widows?

794
01:55:35,869 --> 01:55:38,841
How many children
became orphans?

795
01:55:38,872 --> 01:55:42,846
Several brave soldiers died
in the attempt ol catching them.

796
01:55:42,876 --> 01:55:44,846
For the sake ol your
daughter...

797
01:55:44,878 --> 01:55:47,850
..those lour terrorists
have been released by you.

798
01:55:47,881 --> 01:55:53,859
Political power is not meant
lor personal sentiments...

799
01:55:53,887 --> 01:55:57,861
...but is given to
protect the county.

800
01:55:57,891 --> 01:56:02,867
You're telling the truth;.

801
01:56:02,896 --> 01:56:04,866
Bharti...you...
- Yes, it's me.

802
01:56:04,898 --> 01:56:07,870
Now l've also come here to
see the true color ol my dad.

803
01:56:07,901 --> 01:56:09,871
Under the prete_ ol
sickness...

804
01:56:09,903 --> 01:56:11,873
...l know how you are
relaxing here.

805
01:56:11,905 --> 01:56:14,877
Do you also believe
these army men?

806
01:56:14,908 --> 01:56:17,880
You can rule over the
people ol this county...

807
01:56:17,911 --> 01:56:19,881
...by giving them a slip.

808
01:56:19,913 --> 01:56:23,887
But you can't take me
lor a joy ride.

809
01:56:25,919 --> 01:56:29,893
l am ashamed to call
you as my lather.

810
01:56:30,924 --> 01:56:33,896
Your lather lought bravely
with the English and...

811
01:56:33,927 --> 01:56:37,901
...helped to make our
county independent.

812
01:56:37,931 --> 01:56:40,903
You're plundering our county
along with these terrorists.

813
01:56:42,936 --> 01:56:46,910
Today, l know that in order
to release those lour...

814
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:52,918
...you pretended to have
kidnapped me.

815
01:56:52,946 --> 01:56:56,920
Later on, you threatened to
bring down the government...

816
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:58,920
...put pressure on them
and released those 4 men.

817
01:56:58,952 --> 01:57:03,928
Your craze to become the
Prime Minister ol our county...

818
01:57:03,957 --> 01:57:05,927
...has made you stoop down
so low.

819
01:57:05,959 --> 01:57:08,931
So much so that, you pawned your
own daughter in this dirty politics.

820
01:57:08,962 --> 01:57:09,930
Stop it my dear.

821
01:57:09,963 --> 01:57:11,933
Don't address me
as your daughter.

822
01:57:11,965 --> 01:57:14,937
From today, l've broken
oll all our relations.

823
01:57:14,968 --> 01:57:18,942
Now l will expose you
nicely belore the world.

824
01:57:18,972 --> 01:57:21,944
l will scream and tell my
countymen that...

825
01:57:21,975 --> 01:57:24,947
...do you know the real lorm
ol this man, who...

826
01:57:24,978 --> 01:57:26,948
...wants to become the Prime
Minister ol India? He's a rogue.

827
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:29,952
He can even sell his
own daughter.

828
01:57:29,983 --> 01:57:34,959
One day, lor his chair, he'll
sell his mother and nation too.

829
01:57:34,988 --> 01:57:38,962
You lool...

830
01:57:50,003 --> 01:57:53,977
Veer Bhadra Singh has contacts
with the terrorists.

831
01:57:54,007 --> 01:57:57,981
He even killed his own
daughter.

832
01:57:58,011 --> 01:58:03,989
Yes Sir. He is with me. l am
taking him to the Head Ouarters.

833
01:58:23,036 --> 01:58:26,008
Where are you, Major Rathod?

834
02:00:22,155 --> 02:00:26,129
Death ol Major Rathod was the
beginning ol this war.

835
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:31,135
People say that devils
live long.

836
02:00:31,164 --> 02:00:36,140
So, that rascal escaped
twice lrom my bullets.

837
02:00:38,171 --> 02:00:44,149
Situations were such that
l couldn't complete my mission.

838
02:00:44,177 --> 02:00:53,161
A true Sardar can die, but he
won't chop his hair.

839
02:00:53,186 --> 02:00:58,162
That day belore God, with
tears in my eyes...

840
02:00:58,191 --> 02:01:01,163
...l changed my own lorm.

841
02:01:01,194 --> 02:01:04,166
l was lorced to do all those
things which...

842
02:01:04,197 --> 02:01:09,173
...my religion didn't permit and
were harmlul to my health.

843
02:01:09,203 --> 02:01:12,174
The stoy does not end here.

844
02:01:12,206 --> 02:01:17,181
l am the only unlortunate one
on this earth who has...

845
02:01:17,211 --> 02:01:21,184
...seen his wile as a widow,
when he is vey much alive.

846
02:01:21,215 --> 02:01:24,186
This is truth...

847
02:01:34,228 --> 02:01:38,202
The intention with which l was
taking you to the Head Ouarters...

848
02:01:38,232 --> 02:01:41,204
...has been accomplished.

849
02:01:41,235 --> 02:01:46,211
But your mission is
still incomplete.

850
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:51,216
You can't accomplish it
once you are arrested.

851
02:03:15,329 --> 02:03:19,303
With the death ol both
ol them...

852
02:03:19,333 --> 02:03:23,307
...our secret lriendship will
also get buried lorever.

853
02:03:23,337 --> 02:03:27,311
From tomorrow, we both
will be sworn enemies.

854
02:03:27,341 --> 02:03:30,313
Sworn enemies...?
Only in the eyes ol the world.

855
02:03:30,344 --> 02:03:36,322
How? l didn't lollow.

856
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:43,330
You'll proclaim in the coming
Navratri that...

857
02:03:43,357 --> 02:03:50,337
...you won't allow me to perlorm
puja at Vaishno Devi Temple.

858
02:03:50,364 --> 02:03:54,338
l will evade and say that l will
go to the temple at any cost.

859
02:03:54,368 --> 02:03:57,340
ll l accomplish this mission,
then...

860
02:03:57,371 --> 02:04:00,343
...l will become a national hero.

861
02:04:00,374 --> 02:04:07,354
Then no one can prevent me lrom
hoisting our llag lrom Red Fort.

862
02:04:07,381 --> 02:04:11,355
Notorious terrorist, Changezi
has proclaimed that...

863
02:04:11,385 --> 02:04:17,363
...he won't allow anyone to
perlorm puja at Vaishno Devi.

864
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:22,367
Minister Veer Bhadra Singh
has challenged him...

865
02:04:22,396 --> 02:04:25,368
...that at any cost, he will
go to the temple.

866
02:04:25,399 --> 02:04:28,371
ln this connection, our reporter
says that...

867
02:04:28,402 --> 02:04:32,376
...Veer Bhadra Singh and Changezi
have dillerent versions.

868
02:04:32,406 --> 02:04:36,380
My proclamation will leave
several dead in the temple.

869
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:41,386
No one has the guts to
challenge me.

870
02:04:41,415 --> 02:04:48,395
l say, this year Navratri
puja will not take place.

871
02:04:48,422 --> 02:04:52,396
Any comments about Changezi's
proclamation?

872
02:04:52,426 --> 02:04:55,398
People keep saying.

873
02:04:55,429 --> 02:04:57,399
You must've heard that
proverb.

874
02:04:57,431 --> 02:04:59,401
While dogs are busy barking,
crowds ol people have already left.

875
02:04:59,433 --> 02:05:04,409
This is Hindustan. This
can never happen here...

876
02:05:04,438 --> 02:05:08,412
...that one can't perlorm puja
in a temple here.

877
02:05:08,442 --> 02:05:12,416
l assure you that l will be
the lirst one...

878
02:05:12,446 --> 02:05:14,416
...to go to that temple
and perlorm a puja.

879
02:05:14,448 --> 02:05:18,422
l don't care about the
consequences.

880
02:05:18,452 --> 02:05:22,426
We both deserve to
become actors.

881
02:05:22,456 --> 02:05:24,426
What are you saying?

882
02:05:24,458 --> 02:05:28,432
This is their plan.

883
02:05:28,462 --> 02:05:30,432
ll they accomplish
their mission...

884
02:05:30,464 --> 02:05:34,438
...terrorism will spread
lar and wide.

885
02:05:34,468 --> 02:05:38,442
They will chop India
into pieces.

886
02:05:38,472 --> 02:05:45,452
ln the eyes ol the army, you are
the same loyal soldier.

887
02:05:45,479 --> 02:05:51,457
Belore the mission commenced
l wanted to give you a surprise.

888
02:06:05,499 --> 02:06:09,473
Now even Amruta is aware ol
your honesty and loyalty.

889
02:06:09,503 --> 02:06:14,479
l have told her eveything.

890
02:06:14,508 --> 02:06:19,484
l...
- Enough. Don't utter a word.

891
02:07:04,558 --> 02:07:09,534
Father...
Pinky...

892
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:21,546
l have a remedy to cool your
hot temper also.

893
02:07:28,582 --> 02:07:31,554
Yes Sir.
Look there.

894
02:07:33,587 --> 02:07:36,559
Sir, she takes bribes and
is corrupt. We both can never...

895
02:07:36,590 --> 02:07:38,560
Don't panic.

896
02:07:38,592 --> 02:07:41,564
From today, Kiran has also
sworn to remain honest.

897
02:07:43,597 --> 02:07:49,575
Yes. Brigadier is
telling the truth.

898
02:07:49,603 --> 02:07:54,579
l too have realized the value
ol my unilorm.

899
02:07:54,608 --> 02:07:58,582
Hencelorth l will be with you
in all the decisions ol your lile...

900
02:07:58,612 --> 02:07:59,580
...like a loyal and brave
soldier...

901
02:08:00,614 --> 02:08:03,586
Don't shake hands.
Embrace me.

902
02:08:03,617 --> 02:08:06,589
Didn't l tell you that
l will hook you to me?

903
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:09,592
Now you have lost the bet.

904
02:08:09,623 --> 02:08:13,597
Don't relax too much.

905
02:08:13,627 --> 02:08:17,601
Remember your mission.

906
02:08:23,637 --> 02:08:29,615
Sing in praise ol the Goddess.

907
02:08:32,646 --> 02:08:38,624
You are loved by one and all.

908
02:08:38,652 --> 02:08:42,626
Your lorm on a lion is
worshipped by one and all.

909
02:08:42,656 --> 02:08:49,636
You look unique with your
eight arms.

910
02:08:53,667 --> 02:08:56,639
Your sword adds to your
splendor.

911
02:08:56,670 --> 02:09:02,648
You are unparalleled, shower
your grace on us...

912
02:09:49,723 --> 02:09:53,697
There is unrest eveywhere.
It is a tying moment.

913
02:09:53,727 --> 02:09:59,705
Please wake up as it is
our tying moment.

914
02:09:59,733 --> 02:10:03,707
Men area cooling in the lire
made by burning the county.

915
02:10:03,737 --> 02:10:07,711
Destroy those who sell
their motherland.

916
02:10:07,741 --> 02:10:09,711
You've destroyed the evil
here and...

917
02:10:09,743 --> 02:10:12,715
...several nobles are also
born in this soil.

918
02:10:12,746 --> 02:10:14,716
Pounce on them as lightning
with your spear.

919
02:10:14,748 --> 02:10:17,720
How are we to rely
on a person here?

920
02:10:17,751 --> 02:10:21,725
People here pretend to be
Ioyal and patriotic.

921
02:10:21,755 --> 02:10:27,733
This entire universe is
your royal court.

922
02:11:19,813 --> 02:11:25,791
This earth is sinking
in sins.

923
02:12:14,868 --> 02:12:19,844
Once again take a mighty
lorm.

924
02:15:00,033 --> 02:15:05,009
Hey! where are you all?
Please talk to me.

925
02:15:05,038 --> 02:15:10,014
Come in lront ol me.

926
02:15:50,083 --> 02:15:54,057
You swines, come out
in lront ol me.

927
02:16:00,093 --> 02:16:03,065
Shoot me in my heart.

928
02:16:24,117 --> 02:16:29,093
ll you're a man ol guts,
then shoot me straight.

929
02:16:29,122 --> 02:16:34,098
Please spare my lile...

930
02:16:34,127 --> 02:16:38,101
A Rajput does not spare
the lile ol an enemy.

931
02:16:38,131 --> 02:16:44,109
Even then l will give you
a chance.

932
02:16:44,137 --> 02:16:47,109
Look, an English coin.
Say, head or tail...

933
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:49,110
Head...

934
02:16:49,142 --> 02:16:53,116
You too uttered my
mind's wish.

935
02:16:53,146 --> 02:16:55,116
No...tail...

936
02:17:30,183 --> 02:17:35,159
Arrangements lor our stay have
been made in this guest house.

937
02:17:35,188 --> 02:17:38,160
We will leave after lunch.

938
02:17:38,191 --> 02:17:42,165
Till then relax and enjoy
your meal.

939
02:17:45,198 --> 02:17:48,170
Don't know how people come
walking here to pray.

940
02:17:48,202 --> 02:17:52,175
My legs are paining a lot.

941
02:17:52,206 --> 02:17:57,181
Stop laltering. People are
watching you.

942
02:17:57,211 --> 02:18:00,182
Where is the bathroom?
There.

943
02:18:00,214 --> 02:18:05,189
Now don't lollow me there also.

944
02:18:05,219 --> 02:18:10,194
Alas! my waist is
also aching.

945
02:18:10,224 --> 02:18:16,202
ls it on the left or right?
Go straight.

946
02:18:35,249 --> 02:18:40,225
You...

947
02:18:40,254 --> 02:18:43,226
Dare you shout, then
l will chop your tongue.

948
02:18:43,257 --> 02:18:47,231
Know who am l?
l know you vey well.

949
02:18:47,261 --> 02:18:52,237
You're the illegitimate ollspring
ol this political system.

950
02:18:52,266 --> 02:18:57,242
You're a pimp who will sell
your own motherland.

951
02:18:57,271 --> 02:19:03,249
Your biggest crime is, you
even cheated the army.

952
02:19:03,277 --> 02:19:08,253
Today you've immersed justice
into the dirty drains ol politics.

953
02:19:09,283 --> 02:19:14,259
ll l wish, l can kill
you just now.

954
02:19:15,289 --> 02:19:19,263
But traitors like you should
die with a dillerence.

955
02:19:19,293 --> 02:19:23,267
You will be called a martyr
but you will get a dog's death.

956
02:19:23,297 --> 02:19:28,273
Dare anyone move then
l will shoot Major Aya.

957
02:19:34,308 --> 02:19:39,284
Where is that patriot,
protector ol this county...

958
02:19:39,313 --> 02:19:43,287
...who, in spite ol my warning
had dared to come here?

959
02:19:43,317 --> 02:19:48,293
Where is he?
in the bathroom.

960
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:32,339
Now you will run outside and
Changezi will lollow you.

961
02:20:32,366 --> 02:20:35,338
Run...

962
02:20:55,389 --> 02:20:57,359
Move aside.

963
02:20:57,391 --> 02:20:58,359
The way Raja Sahab's running
Iooks like something is lishy.

964
02:20:58,392 --> 02:21:02,366
Don't shoot. A bomb is
tied round him.

965
02:21:10,404 --> 02:21:14,378
We all will die. Move
aside...don't shoot...

966
02:21:32,426 --> 02:21:36,400
Hey! he is Changezi,
the notorious terrorist.

967
02:22:14,468 --> 02:22:17,440
Raja Sahab died like
a martyr.

968
02:22:17,471 --> 02:22:27,457
He became immortal
with his death.

969
02:22:27,481 --> 02:22:32,457
Three months later...

970
02:22:32,486 --> 02:22:38,464
Today we all have gathered
here to open the...

971
02:22:38,492 --> 02:22:42,466
...statue ol our esteemed leader,
Sri Veer Bhadra Singh.

972
02:22:55,509 --> 02:23:00,485
Now l will request Ajit Aya to
come and garland the statue.

973
02:23:27,541 --> 02:23:34,521
Rascal...this will be the plight
ol leaders like you.

974
02:23:34,548 --> 02:23:40,526
These are our public. They have
eyes but they can't see.

975
02:23:40,554 --> 02:23:45,530
They have ears, but can't hear.
They have tongue, but are dumb.

976
02:23:45,559 --> 02:23:50,535
They will all clap when l will
garland you.

977
02:23:56,570 --> 02:24:03,550
Poor thing, all are
Gandhiji's monkeys.

978
02:24:03,577 --> 02:24:08,553
They've given respect to you
by erecting your statue today.

979
02:24:08,582 --> 02:24:12,556
But they will lorget you
after today...

980
02:24:12,586 --> 02:24:15,558
...because they've a weak
memoy.

981
02:24:15,589 --> 02:24:20,565
When they have lorgotten great
Ieaders, they won't spare you.

982
02:24:20,594 --> 02:24:25,570
After today, you will be
respected...

983
02:24:25,599 --> 02:24:30,575
...only by the sparrows,
crows and pigeons.
