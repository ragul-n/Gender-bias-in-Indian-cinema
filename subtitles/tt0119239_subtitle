1
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,314
- They've arrived, sir!
- I know that.

2
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:58,861
Long live Justice Sinha!

3
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:04,768
Move aside... go on!

4
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:16,181
It's time for the meeting, sir.
Excuse me.

5
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,878
Long <i>live...!</i>

6
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:23,485
Here's a real social-worker
after Mahatma Gandhi.

7
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:26,485
- He's cast a spell on the public.
- We're social workers, too.

8
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:29,488
But no one cares for me...
I'm talking about myself

9
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:32,190
- But they're bothered about you.
- Get to work!

10
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:38,604
The open-door policy has now brought
us to the crossroads, gentlemen.

11
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:42,130
On the one hand is the
path to prosperity...

12
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:45,839
...which demands great sacrifice.

13
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,678
On the other, there is the path
of peace and brotherhood.

14
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:59,349
Now, are we prepared for a struggle
so that we may prosper in future?

15
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:03,386
Or do we wish to be happy
as we are?

16
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:06,295
That is the question
before us today.

17
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,463
This is wonderful!

18
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:14,330
Caught between the devil and
the deep blue seas, isn't it?!

19
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:18,509
We'd better not stray from
our point of discussion.

20
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,546
We have been discussing this
for long in any case.

21
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:26,816
I think we must adopt the path of
modernization and progress, Governor.

22
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:31,548
We must permit foreign companies to
have free trade in our country.

23
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:37,121
We must tolerate the difficulties
we are likely to encounter.

24
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,466
We can't have roses
without thorns, can we?

25
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:47,367
We must not let foreign companies
set foot on our soil!

26
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:51,608
Between holding a gun to the
temple and enslaving someone...

27
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,004
...and buying them out with dollars,
there is no difference whatsoever.

28
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:58,916
You mean, the snake in the
grass, don't you? Beautiful!

29
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:04,220
You're the best of patriots,
if ever there was one!

30
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:09,324
This is the age of billionaires
and millionaires, Mr. Minister!

31
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,826
The power brokers
don't matter much.

32
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,158
The fallen statues of the icons
in Russia bear out this fact!

33
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,836
Think of the money that the open-door
police will bring into the country.

34
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:28,272
You're right. The influx of foreign
currency will strengthen our Rupee.

35
00:06:28,648 --> 00:06:30,513
We will be self-reliant.

36
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:34,344
We will not have to mortgage our
gold-reserves with other nations.

37
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:38,488
- Our country will roll in wealth!
- No! It will go bankrupt!

38
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:43,792
The multi-nationals will rob
the country of its wealth.

39
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,428
Their computers will render
millions of our workers jobless.

40
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,563
This will result in inflation. Those
living in flats will move to slums...

41
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:53,533
...and those from the slums
will be out on the streets...

42
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:58,903
...only to be crushed under the
swanky cars of the corporate sector!

43
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:03,979
It is because of stubborn people like
you that this country was divided!

44
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,510
There were widespread riots;
Gandhi was assassinated...

45
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,285
...and the Babri mosque
was demolished!

46
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:11,282
You are penny wise
and pound-foolish!

47
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,157
You invoke the name of Lord Rama
only to defame him!

48
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:17,887
Stop being a stooge of the
foreign companies, Mr. Chaudhary!

49
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:22,130
It's ordinary cloth that will make
your shroud! Not dollars!

50
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:26,095
- Mr. Vilasrao...
- Don't scream! I can do that, too!

51
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,598
Please be calm...
Sit down, both of you.

52
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:38,982
For a moment I thought
we were in Parliament!

53
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:45,480
We only stand to gain from
the open-door policy!

54
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:47,621
Please go ahead and
sign the ordnance.

55
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:50,829
Please be cautious in every
step you take, sir!

56
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:54,961
This has to do with the future of
the millions of the country.

57
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,403
We have had a pretty good debate
on the open-door policy today.

58
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,735
It's true, the issue is complicated
and not very simple.

59
00:08:07,346 --> 00:08:12,807
But I hope to find a solution
in about a fortnight.

60
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:16,344
We will surely find a
middle-path...

61
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:23,386
...which preserves the welfare of
the people and their progress.

62
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,364
I thank all of you
for being here.

63
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:34,228
The briefcase contains
a million Rupees, Vilasrao.

64
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:39,504
Just make sure that
there is no strike.

65
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:43,406
You have oiled the
machinery, Mr. Modi.

66
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:48,651
I will now skirt the issue of
the workers' demands.

67
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:52,124
You look worried, even
after the recoveries?

68
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:56,422
I've been thinking about
the open-door policy.

69
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,430
If multi-nationals are
allowed entry...

70
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:02,993
...all this work will be
accomplished by computers.

71
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:06,801
That the workers will
starve is a truth.

72
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:11,198
What is worse is that our
livelihood will be endangered.

73
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,078
We must now see whose opinion
the Governor approves of...

74
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,779
...and whom he eventually snubs.

75
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,651
You have a high Blood Pressure.

76
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,787
You don't seem to be
taking your medicines.

77
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:28,890
I remind him even in the office.
But he refuses the medicine.

78
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:32,627
- You may leave, Mr. Ishwar.
- You're getting rid of me!

79
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,524
This contains the memo of today's
meeting and tomorrow's program.

80
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:41,095
I will leave now. Please see that
he takes his medicines.

81
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:47,143
Everyone is worried about your
health, except your own self.

82
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,072
So long as Dr Gandhi is around,
nothing will happen to me.

83
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:58,749
But people need doctors to
even walk around these days!

84
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:05,587
Wrong! A personality like you needs
a lawyer, too, besides a doctor.

85
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:14,565
"After whatever you've thought,
you have to get along with me"

86
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:21,177
How does the B.P.
Read today, Dr Gandhi?

87
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:24,543
His condition is not very good.

88
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,247
Oh, come on!

89
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:29,481
It's not his work that
is worrying him, doctor.

90
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:33,152
We have some problems
in the family.

91
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:35,960
Would you go outside
and play, son?

92
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,956
Why keep secrets from them?
They're like family.

93
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,866
You know he married me
and took Sahil for his son...

94
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,204
...after the death
of my husband.

95
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,436
He loves Sahil more than he would
love his own son.

96
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,506
But, for some reason, Sahil is
drifting away from him.

97
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,904
He is always aloof and withdrawn.

98
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:58,215
I have nothing against Sahil...

99
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,620
Why don't you have a heart
to heart talk with Sahil?

100
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:03,420
But what will I
discuss with him?

101
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:06,020
I remember a couplet for
this delicate situation.

102
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:10,927
"What could be the reason
for this strife?"

103
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:14,256
There is no strife
between us, Mr. Thanawala.

104
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,361
Sahil is still a kid.

105
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:19,294
He will himself realize
how much I love him.

106
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:49,127
You are very late, son.

107
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:56,694
You must return a bit early.
We miss you at dinner...

108
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:06,471
Why must we be strangers? Why can't
we live like father and son?

109
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:08,846
You are undoubtedly my mother's
second husband...

110
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:12,479
...but you are not
my father.

111
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,546
- May I have a word with you?
- But who are you?

112
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:52,115
I'm a salesman... I sell love.

113
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:56,755
I service beautiful girls like you,
absolutely free of charge.

114
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,193
- Pardon me?!
- I know the art of making love.

115
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:07,071
If I kiss you, you can assume you
have excelled in the test of love.

116
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:09,664
You would like to excel,
wouldn't you?

117
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:12,575
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a salesman, too.

118
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:17,211
I sell junk! I set guys like
you right, without any charge!

119
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,374
This is not your vice-den!
It's my college!

120
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,223
Thanks for helping me.

121
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,300
You look familiar. Have we met?

122
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:13,894
- Yes. On several occasions.
- But you've just joined college.

123
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:19,237
But you've known me for years.
We have a great friendship.

124
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:23,275
I have no friends.
I'm all alone.

125
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,643
You still haven't changed. You were
like this even as a child!

126
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:32,184
Always racing away
on the red bicycle!

127
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,486
When did you return from
boarding-school?

128
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:38,252
- It's a month now.
- Then why didn't you meet me?

129
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,527
I wanted to give you
a surprise.

130
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,494
Which is why I took an admission
in your college.

131
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,964
I wanted to see if you'd
recognize me.

132
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,738
And what did you see?

133
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:52,104
That you're still as you were...
absolutely lonely.

134
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:55,207
I won't consider myself
a loner anymore.

135
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:56,913
Neither will I.

136
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,746
I've got to see the Principal!
I'll meet you tomorrow!

137
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,860
- I apologize for my uncle.
...that's in the past.

138
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:21,170
You won't punish me for
what my uncle did?

139
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:23,338
- Not at all.
- Will you consider me a friend?

140
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,908
- Why not?
- Let's have an ice-cream then!

141
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,479
Not today. Perhaps on
another occasion.

142
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:42,960
Welcome, Mr. Diwan! ...Relax!
Your snacks are served!

143
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:46,020
Well, what's all this
appeasement in aid of?

144
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:51,026
Looks like a new scheme to get me
to increase your pocket-money.

145
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:56,106
Who's worried about pocket-money?
I've stumbled upon the treasure!

146
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,406
Had you been to a garment sale
or to the college?

147
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,543
- To college. Know whom I met?
- Whom did you meet?

148
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:04,809
I met Sahil there.

149
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:09,981
He's as tall as a lamp-post!
Like a true-blooded Punjabi!

150
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,218
How did you recognize him?

151
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:14,291
I'd never forgotten him that
I had to recognize him!

152
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,094
I must say, against all hopes,
he has grown to be handsome.

153
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:18,686
Did he recognize you?

154
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:22,592
- Did he talk to you?
- Why wouldn't he?

155
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:25,798
We're friend again, Papa!

156
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:28,873
I'm thrilled! It's as if my
childhood has returned to me!

157
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,875
Wait... sit down here.

158
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:38,579
There's a big difference between the
friendship of childhood and youth.

159
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,444
Don't forget; I'm his father's
personal secretary.

160
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:45,083
So what?

161
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:48,618
Why pursue a path that we
don't intend to take up?

162
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,494
How can you bring up
these cliches, Papa?

163
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:55,026
He hasn't bought you over, just
because you're his secretary!

164
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,567
Do you need to seek his permission
everytime you breathe?

165
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:03,600
Mercy on me, sir...
A penny for me!

166
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:07,376
Quiet! Obstinate girl!

167
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,805
Just remember this much, dear.

168
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:14,078
It's a young girl who carries
the trust of her father's honor.

169
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:19,683
I won't say another word.
Do as you please. Okay?

170
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,223
I'm not obstinate, dad...
I'm only very sentimental.

171
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,259
If you consider my
happiness a burden...

172
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,328
...I will do as you say.

173
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:37,437
It will bother me, no doubt.
But I'll cry over it.

174
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:41,705
You're not only sentimental...
you're an actress, too!

175
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:46,012
You know I can
never see you cry!

176
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:50,012
I played horse for you earlier;
I'll now play an ass!

177
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:54,183
I'll even tolerate Governor's
slap for your sake, okay?

178
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:03,230
Bloody idiot! Do you
know who Sahil is?

179
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:07,603
He's the Governor
Jaisingh Sinha's son!

180
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,964
I'm trying to get my daughter
married to him...

181
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:12,334
...and you take on
enmity with him?

182
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:16,613
You're thinking of my marriage;
and you haven't spoken to me!

183
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:22,281
I'm sorry. I wanted to surprise you.
I didn't want to tell you as yet.

184
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:27,251
But thanks to this idiot,
I've blurted out the truth.

185
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:33,624
Your Dad has been trying to get
you engaged to the Governor's son.

186
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:36,191
It's a good family and the
boy's good, too.

187
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:39,798
Well, then... do you approve
of your dad's choice?

188
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:44,134
We will pursue this, only
if you approve of it.

189
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:49,273
Do you agree? Speak up...
don't feel shy.

190
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:50,841
I agree.

191
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:56,581
Let's go to the Governor's house
with the proposal immediately.

192
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,425
Who's that?

193
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:09,995
Why don't you speak?

194
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:12,466
Any problem?

195
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,430
Are you dumb?

196
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,740
Your father seems to have
a lot of money to waste!

197
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:25,343
Who's that? Speak up!

198
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:40,354
Why are you bothering me? Have
you nothing better to do?

199
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,000
- Is that the Governor's bungalow?
- Yes. Go on.

200
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:47,467
Stop talking and put
Mr. Sahil Sinha on the line.

201
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:52,009
- What is this regarding?
- Idiot! Who are you?

202
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:54,843
I'm Mr. Diwan's
very special servant.

203
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,646
Haven't you recognized me? I'm a
friend of Mr. Diwan's daughter...

204
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:03,678
...since her childhood
and through her life.

205
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:06,981
Sahil! It is you!

206
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,288
What can I do for you?

207
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:19,895
Promise to meet me
in my dreams tonight.

208
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:23,498
I'd do that, even if
you didn't ask me to.

209
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:04,706
It has nothing to do with business;
it's a family affair, sir.

210
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:06,777
Which is why I've brought
my family along.

211
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:09,776
Where's Sahil? ...relax.
I'll find him.

212
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,951
- Which room is it?
- The first one upstairs.

213
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:18,023
Does your daughter
already know my son?

214
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:20,930
They're studying in
the same college.

215
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:27,766
Eat, while you see the snaps.
I've made this on my own.

216
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,369
But you were a glutton as a kid!
Always hogging something.

217
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,836
- Really?
- As if you don't remember!

218
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:36,136
You even used to snatch
my food from me!

219
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,782
You remember everything about
our childhood, don't you?

220
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:41,778
He told his mom only
this morning...

221
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,814
...that he wants to have a
great birthday bash this year.

222
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,487
- That's wonderful!
- He had a special reason, he said.

223
00:32:50,294 --> 00:32:53,559
Your visit now explains what the
special reason could be.

224
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,424
Here's how you looked
as a kid.

225
00:32:57,835 --> 00:33:00,065
The snap was taken at Aksa beach,
while on a picnic.

226
00:33:00,972 --> 00:33:03,236
He didn't say a word to us.

227
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:07,341
We know from you now as to
what this is all about.

228
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,077
May we consider this alliance
as cemented then?

229
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:13,212
Certainly.

230
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:16,280
- You're crying in this picture!
- Don't you remember?

231
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:20,982
I threw water on your face and you
threw me down on the rocks!

232
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,157
It had hurt my cheeks badly.
The scars remained for long.

233
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:26,258
Dad thought my face
was ruined forever.

234
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:31,227
That cheek, right?
But there's no scar there.

235
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,267
The scars have faded.
But the wound remains.

236
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:39,542
- Sahil is not at home.
- He must've gone out.

237
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:41,677
Sit down, dear.

238
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:45,671
It's you we were talking about,
even after you had left.

239
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:49,682
Shall we celebrate the alliance
with sweets, Governor?

240
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:52,419
In that case, may I apply a balm?

241
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,853
Wonderful! You will apply a balm now
for an injury of childhood!

242
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:58,491
- I was very innocent then.
- Are you a wise man now?

243
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:03,124
Not at all.
I've gone mad and crazy now.

244
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:06,293
May I apply the balm then?

245
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,607
Daddy!

246
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:19,644
Look who's here!

247
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:23,687
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings, son.

248
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,988
He has come to discuss something
very important with you, Dad.

249
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:31,554
I've come to invite you to my
birthday party next week.

250
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:35,857
You will not be there as the
Governor's personal secretary.

251
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,258
You will be my personal guest.

252
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,136
Do attend the party.

253
00:34:53,117 --> 00:35:02,822
I'm grateful to you for attending
my elder son's birthday party.

254
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:05,527
It's a matter of pride
for every father...

255
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,592
...to watch his son grow
as tall as he himself is.

256
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:14,268
I'm even more proud, for my son
is two inches taller than me!

257
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:18,402
He even wears shoes
bigger than mine!

258
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:22,206
It's true that my son
has now grown up.

259
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:26,306
As a responsible father then,
it is my duty...

260
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:30,483
...to do whatever
my son feels like doing.

261
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:32,754
This is his right.

262
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:38,157
On this occasion therefore, I want
to give my son a beautiful present.

263
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:43,794
A present he loves.

264
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,930
Something he will have
to keep all his life.

265
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:58,345
You've guessed it! I want to
announce his engagement!

266
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:03,385
The girl is sincere, kind-hearted
and beautiful...

267
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:08,155
...and best of all, my son
loves her.

268
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:17,760
The girl is Mr. Chaudhary's daughter...
Sheetal Chaudhary.

269
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:32,405
Put the ring on her finger, son.

270
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:39,245
Just a minute, Mom.

271
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:48,028
On my birthday today, I wished to
pour my heart out to you.

272
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:53,863
But the Governor has poisoned the
atmosphere, before I could do that.

273
00:36:58,276 --> 00:36:59,971
He likes to create drama...

274
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:04,142
...and every word of what he said
was a lie.

275
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:09,045
How would he know what
my heart craves for?

276
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,522
He does not approve of the girl
I am in love with.

277
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:20,422
It's a blow to his respect to accept
her as his daughter-in-law.

278
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:26,435
Because she happens to be Isha, the
daughter of his personal secretary.

279
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:36,138
What madness is this? I have done
everything as per your liking.

280
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,482
Don't call this force on me
as something I like.

281
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:41,641
Why don't you admit...

282
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:45,920
...that you will not get me engaged
to your P.A.'s daughter?

283
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:53,162
You loved Sheetal till yesterday.
What made you change overnight?

284
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:57,559
What change? Who has
fed you the stories?

285
00:37:57,935 --> 00:37:59,493
Are you stoned?

286
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,742
Stop arguing and apologize
to Mr. Chaudhary.

287
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,873
Apologize to Sheetal, too.

288
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:13,139
You have subjected my love
to ridicule, Governor!

289
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,984
It's you who must apologize!

290
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:18,184
You're talking nonsense!
They're all watching us.

291
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:23,157
Stop messing with me, or else
I'll strip you before all of them!

292
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,721
What are you talking
about, Sahil?

293
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,389
Don't interfere, Mom!

294
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:33,236
You will strip me?
Strip your father?

295
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:36,139
- Never mind him, please...
- You have spoilt him!

296
00:38:37,074 --> 00:38:38,006
This is the limit!

297
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:41,042
I'll give him another chance.

298
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:46,146
He'd better apologize to everyone,
or he won't like the consequences.

299
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,677
What more harm can you
do to me anyway?

300
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:50,348
I'll throw you out of my house!

301
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,446
You'll be out on the streets,
to be rejected everywhere!

302
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:56,492
There's no place for cheapsters
like you in my house!

303
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:59,427
You've proved you are
my step-father, haven't you?

304
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:06,264
You heard him. He has admitted that
he was only interested in my mother.

305
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:09,669
- Not to accept me as his <i>son...</i>
- Insolent rascal!

306
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:19,705
Why have you stopped? Dig the
knife in your mother's heart!

307
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:24,082
To kill your father, you will first
have to pierce my heart!

308
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:32,085
Had he only not been your husband,
I'd have dug the knife in him!

309
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:53,074
What are you laughing for?

310
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,788
I can't help it! It's
something we must mourn...

311
00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:01,091
...but I can't help laughing
looking at you guys!

312
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,292
Get out! Go outside and laugh!

313
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:08,857
Even if Chaudhary's daughter does
not marry the Governor's son...

314
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,063
...what is certain is that...

315
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:14,127
...they're one now.

316
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:18,435
We're one, too, Vilasrao.

317
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:27,776
I swear by the Gods!
I won't let things go haywire.

318
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:33,618
We must find a serious cure for
this grave problem, minister.

319
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:37,355
You're right.

320
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:40,552
I wish to say something.

321
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:47,969
Whether Sahil cares for me or not,
I love him with all my heart.

322
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,636
I will someday make a place
for myself in his heart.

323
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:55,479
Why aren't you trying to
see the point?

324
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,947
Your Dad has nothing against
Diwan and his daughter.

325
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,874
In fact, he likes Isha.

326
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:04,717
But you will be happier
if you marry Sheetal.

327
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:08,218
That's enough, Dr Gandhi!
Don't defend your friend anymore!

328
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,960
Who the hell is he to decide
things in my life?

329
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:16,227
Stop drinking now. Go home.

330
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:19,495
I'm going to decide this tonight!

331
00:42:14,191 --> 00:42:15,522
Yes?

332
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:19,194
What is it?

333
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:26,062
I'm helpless. I can do
nothing about this.

334
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:49,223
Mr. Governor!

335
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:23,960
Father!

336
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:30,222
God! Who did this?
Who did it to you? Speak up!

337
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:34,126
Speak!

338
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,735
Is anybody there?!

339
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:49,384
Mother...

340
00:43:51,155 --> 00:43:55,592
It wasn't me, mother...
I've done nothing!

341
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:57,722
What else can I say,
My Lord?

342
00:43:58,062 --> 00:44:01,964
He launched an attack on the deceased
at the party on August 29th!

343
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:04,391
Thanks to the guests who
were present there...

344
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:06,693
...he contained
his sinful intentions!

345
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:09,130
On the night of the 30th,
he found the opportunity...

346
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:10,271
...and killed his father!

347
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:14,734
Without wasting the court's
time, Your Honor...

348
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,979
...l'd like to present leading
personalities of the city...

349
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:19,248
...who stand testimony to
Sahil's waywardness!

350
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:23,241
I swear by every holy Text! Had
Shardadevi not intervened...

351
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:30,084
...he'd have killed his father on
the night of August 29th itself!

352
00:44:32,062 --> 00:44:37,432
I was stunned to see his true colors
on the night of the 29th.

353
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:40,833
He attacked his father
with a dagger in hand!

354
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:45,468
He screamed that he
would kill him!

355
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:49,742
He has killed the Governor!
That's the cent percent truth!

356
00:44:50,848 --> 00:44:54,375
The poor Governor tried
to make him see sense.

357
00:44:54,718 --> 00:44:56,845
He was beside himself,
addressing him as his "son".

358
00:44:57,421 --> 00:45:01,983
But this boy had
murderous intentions.

359
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:05,228
He's a step-son. No wonder he
could do something so heinous!

360
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:06,890
There's no doubt at all!

361
00:45:07,431 --> 00:45:10,059
He is the one who has
killed the Governor!

362
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:17,806
When the police arrested Sahil Sinha
at the site of the crime on the 30th

363
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:20,303
...he was dead drunk.

364
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:26,077
The finger-prints on the weapon of
murder and the deceased's body...

365
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:29,874
...belonged only to Sahil Sinha.

366
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,454
I have been appointed
to defend Sahil Sinha.

367
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:45,801
It's a record that I have
never lost a case in my life.

368
00:45:46,236 --> 00:45:50,673
But I would like to
lose this case today.

369
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:58,437
This is the Will of the Governor
Sinha, which was entrusted to me.

370
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:03,146
It clearly states that the
heir to all his wealth...

371
00:46:03,587 --> 00:46:05,851
...will be not his
only son, Harsh Sinha...

372
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,921
...but Sahil Sinha.

373
00:46:10,294 --> 00:46:14,355
It was his lust for wealth that
compelled him to murder his father.

374
00:46:15,098 --> 00:46:19,592
He showed his true colors, the
moment the Will was prepared.

375
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,734
That is a lie!
And so is your case!

376
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:28,509
I have not killed my father!
But nobody believes me!

377
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:34,717
So I am a liar! So is the police,
the case and the witnesses!

378
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,348
But a mother would never
lie on such an occasion...

379
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:45,722
...especially when her son is
being sent to the gallows!

380
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,593
I'd therefore like your permission
to present Sharda Devi in court.

381
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:54,701
Permission is granted.

382
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:05,046
So, Sharda Devi... what did you see
at the scene of the crime?

383
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:08,582
Is it a lie that the accused
was dead drunk?

384
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:11,787
Is it a lie that he was in
a murderous mood?

385
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:17,317
Is it a lie that he mercilessly
stabbed your husband to death?

386
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:18,895
It's true.

387
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:26,868
Every word that you
have uttered is true.

388
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:31,831
He is the one who has
killed my husband.

389
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:34,471
He has killed his father!

390
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:38,913
It's better to be childless,
than have such issues!

391
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:46,016
You could have killed me, too!
Why didn't you?

392
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,120
Why didn't you kill me, too?

393
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:58,665
The verdict will be
pronounced tomorrow.

394
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:08,171
In view of the testimony of witnesses
and the evidence at hand...

395
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:10,603
...this court reaches
the conclusion that...

396
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:17,284
...that Sahil Sinha mercilessly
killed his father.

397
00:48:17,888 --> 00:48:23,155
Under the Indian Penal Code 302,
this court awards Sahil Sinha...

398
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:30,160
...Rigorous lmprisonment
for 14 years.

399
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:49,442
How could this happen, Sahil?!
I can never live without you!

400
00:48:52,155 --> 00:48:58,788
This is a lie, Isha. Believe me.
I have been framed.

401
00:49:01,431 --> 00:49:04,559
But I know for sure today...

402
00:49:05,135 --> 00:49:09,003
...how much my father loved me.

403
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:09,898
Let's go.

404
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:19,979
Do something for Sahil, dad!

405
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:23,213
Get in.

406
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,948
- I want to have a word with him.
- Not allowed... get in!

407
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,282
Give us a minute, inspector?
Please?

408
00:49:30,694 --> 00:49:31,786
You have only a minute.

409
00:49:33,397 --> 00:49:38,130
No matter what anyone says, I will
always consider you innocent.

410
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,034
Won't you embrace me,
before I leave?

411
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:46,568
There's a locket in
my pocket, Sheetal!

412
00:49:46,977 --> 00:49:49,946
Quietly pull it out. I haven't
told anyone about it.

413
00:49:50,747 --> 00:49:53,409
I found this in Dad's hand
when he breathed his last.

414
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:55,115
Make sure you keep it safely.

415
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:58,386
This might perhaps take me
to the real killer!

416
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:09,326
Shut the door.

417
00:50:39,629 --> 00:50:40,118
Move!

418
00:51:09,793 --> 00:51:11,920
You show me your strength?!

419
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:15,260
You have murdered your father!

420
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,823
You have killed your father!

421
00:51:19,069 --> 00:51:20,536
You dare show me
your strength?!

422
00:51:21,938 --> 00:51:23,166
You show me your strength?!

423
00:51:27,277 --> 00:51:28,471
You have a lot of steam, eh?

424
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,011
This was the reception
on your arrival!

425
00:51:32,516 --> 00:51:38,546
Behave like newly married bride!
Keep your voice and eyes lowered!

426
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:43,758
Or you're going to get
the stick again!

427
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:47,788
Hurry up in the <i>queue...!</i>

428
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,709
Give that to me... just get lost!

429
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:06,978
Give me a plate, guys... Quick!

430
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:23,425
So, "chicken-chilly"?
You're fuming, aren't you?

431
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,627
He's a tender guy!

432
00:52:27,304 --> 00:52:32,674
Calm down... calm down, son.
This will aggravate the situation.

433
00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:36,679
Besides, they're
professional killers.

434
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,804
Sit down.

435
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:45,419
You want to eat, right?
Share my food with me.

436
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:47,913
I'm an old man, as it is.
I can't eat so much.

437
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:49,718
Let's eat.

438
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,158
What crime are you serving
a sentence for?

439
00:52:53,563 --> 00:52:55,360
I have been accused of
killing my father.

440
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:57,466
Is it true?

441
00:52:58,068 --> 00:52:59,933
That's what the Law thinks.

442
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:04,336
And my mother does not
believe my innocence too.

443
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,699
But I believe you.

444
00:53:09,546 --> 00:53:12,106
I'm no longer interested
in the world outside.

445
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:15,009
I'm all alone.

446
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:19,452
Our landlord set my wife
and kids on fire.

447
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:22,783
I'm serving a sentence
for killing him.

448
00:53:24,594 --> 00:53:26,619
I'm not interested
in going out.

449
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:31,430
But you have to find the
real killer of your father.

450
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:34,161
You have to win back
your mother's trust.

451
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:37,200
How will I do that? An escape
from here is impossible!

452
00:53:37,874 --> 00:53:39,865
There is only one way
of getting out of here.

453
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:43,008
Through the waters, that is.

454
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,143
You can escape through the sea.

455
00:53:45,582 --> 00:53:47,675
- The sea?
- Yes.

456
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:53,082
In eleven years, I have found
a weakness in this jail.

457
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:54,855
What is the weakness?

458
00:53:55,258 --> 00:53:58,523
All the refuse and dirty water of
the jail flows into the sea...

459
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:00,523
...through a drainage system.

460
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:02,555
But where is this drain?

461
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:05,424
In the dark-cells, the oldest
portion of this prison.

462
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:08,362
It's pitch dark in there.

463
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,195
When they want to give
someone severe punishment...

464
00:54:10,507 --> 00:54:12,668
...they send the prisoner
to that cell for some days.

465
00:54:13,076 --> 00:54:15,101
If you somehow manage
to reach that cell...

466
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:17,242
...there is hope for you.

467
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:20,941
Exactly two feet under the commode
in the toilet is the drain...

468
00:54:21,284 --> 00:54:22,649
...which leads to the sea.

469
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:25,453
How far will I be able
to swim in the sea?

470
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:27,416
Let me explain, son.

471
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:33,159
If you can arrange for a boat,
you can escape this prison.

472
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:44,774
Listen, No. 22!
There's a girl here to see you.

473
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:50,368
Sheetal? You?

474
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,313
- How are you?
- I'm fine. But how's mom?

475
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,053
She still hasn't gotten
over the shock, they say.

476
00:55:00,357 --> 00:55:02,484
I had great difficulty in getting
permission to meet you.

477
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:05,124
I might not come again, and I
was compelled to call on you.

478
00:55:09,499 --> 00:55:12,593
- Will you do me a favor?
- I can do anything for you.

479
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:15,665
- This could be dangerous.
- I don't care.

480
00:55:16,072 --> 00:55:22,534
You must arrange for a boat to
arrive at the creek next Wednesday.

481
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:24,143
- Are you planning to...
- You're right.

482
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:27,015
I can prove my innocence
only after escaping!

483
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:29,748
But you must be careful.

484
00:55:30,186 --> 00:55:34,247
If there's an enquiry,
you must not get involved.

485
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:36,089
Don't worry.

486
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,288
There are people in the city
who would do anything for money.

487
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:42,189
I will set it up.

488
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:44,964
If just talking isn't enough...

489
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:48,333
...do you want me to lay
a bed in here?

490
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:49,832
Go away, Sheetal.

491
00:55:51,808 --> 00:55:52,433
Look after yourself.

492
00:55:57,213 --> 00:56:01,240
That's not a bad idea...
but it's only an idea.

493
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:09,281
Lower your gaze!
Or you get the stick!

494
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:29,673
Get up, punks... and get lost!

495
00:56:30,947 --> 00:56:33,643
Get cracking, buddy.

496
00:56:36,386 --> 00:56:37,284
What's wrong with him?

497
00:56:37,654 --> 00:56:38,586
Let's take a look.

498
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:51,931
You are parasites! You feed on
the government and the public.

499
00:56:52,502 --> 00:56:54,402
You live on left-overs!

500
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,571
- Here's your food...
- He's getting smart!

501
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:25,592
What's going on over here?
Stop it, I say!

502
00:58:26,396 --> 00:58:28,523
Stop it, or you get the stick!

503
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,013
You've made a big mistake
by hitting me!

504
00:58:47,283 --> 00:58:50,150
- I'm going to kill you!
- It's not his mistake, sir!

505
00:58:50,386 --> 00:58:51,444
He's not at fault, sir!

506
00:58:51,955 --> 00:58:54,150
They've made life
miserable for him, sir!

507
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:58,250
They're driven him crazy!
He's not to blame, sir!

508
00:58:58,561 --> 00:58:59,687
Out of my way, old man!

509
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:02,290
You've been given 14 years
in prison, haven't you?

510
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:06,465
Each day will be like
14 years for you!

511
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:11,465
Take them away and throw them
in the dark cell!

512
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:13,537
Get in!

513
00:59:45,008 --> 00:59:49,104
He's thinking of
serving us grilled!

514
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:53,874
I can spare you guys
on one condition.

515
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:59,411
- We agree to every condition!
- You must do as I say.

516
00:59:59,689 --> 01:00:02,021
- Sure, we will! Tell him, Shiva!
- All right.

517
01:00:04,427 --> 01:00:04,984
Take this piece of iron.

518
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:06,385
Follow me.

519
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,733
If you want to escape...

520
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:16,903
...you must dig a 2-feet pit
under the commode in four days.

521
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:19,031
This is the only way
we can escape.

522
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:20,564
Is that the truth?

523
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,101
I've even arranged for
a boat on Wednesday.

524
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:26,515
I must say! You're more
crooked than we are!

525
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:29,551
He has even bumped off his old man...
I'm only kidding.

526
01:00:30,153 --> 01:00:33,088
- Start digging immediately.
- Get cracking, buddy.

527
01:01:56,506 --> 01:02:01,773
Damn it! It's already 2 feet!
But there's no way of escape!

528
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:04,043
There's no god-forsaken
gutter in here!

529
01:02:04,947 --> 01:02:07,780
You've gone crazy, feller!
You're simply nuts!

530
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:12,043
And we've been digging away!

531
01:02:19,262 --> 01:02:24,325
It's four days since they were
locked away in the dark cell, sir.

532
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:26,999
Hunger and thirst must have dried
up their intestines by now!

533
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,531
We won't get to know,
even if they die.

534
01:02:30,072 --> 01:02:33,371
Let's go and take a look.

535
01:02:39,115 --> 01:02:41,515
Look at that!
We've found the tunnel!

536
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:45,887
This is the main gutter!
I can even hear water flowing!

537
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:52,786
Let's scram! Hurry up!

538
01:03:00,803 --> 01:03:01,633
Someone's coming this way.

539
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:50,080
So, smart-ass?! Are you
rid of your arrogance?

540
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:55,120
You've invited trouble
by provoking me!

541
01:03:55,558 --> 01:03:59,324
Spend another 3 days here and
you will come to your senses!

542
01:04:00,062 --> 01:04:02,622
The bastards!

543
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,360
They dare mess with me!

544
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:45,235
No, jailer! I will use
the stick today!

545
01:04:45,975 --> 01:04:50,810
Once I'm through, you will never
be able to wield the stick again!

546
01:04:59,322 --> 01:05:00,914
There's something fishy in there.
Let's check it out!

547
01:06:50,499 --> 01:06:53,559
No!

548
01:07:13,322 --> 01:07:14,721
Sahil has escaped from prison!

549
01:07:17,059 --> 01:07:19,619
You... ought to be
happy now, dear.

550
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:25,862
I'm delighted, father!
I'm thrilled!

551
01:07:26,268 --> 01:07:29,931
What has your police force
been doing, Patwardhan?

552
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:32,500
Why hasn't the convict
been nabbed?

553
01:07:32,908 --> 01:07:35,103
I'm being hounded by
calls from the Capital!

554
01:07:35,444 --> 01:07:36,877
I'm the only one they
seem to find!

555
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:40,010
The police have fanned out
in all directions, sir.

556
01:07:40,316 --> 01:07:43,080
Now look... this is not something
you can hush up, okay?

557
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:46,314
I want results!
And quick results at that!

558
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:49,981
If my position is threatened
because of your incompetence...

559
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:54,659
...I swear by Shiva! I will have
you transferred to Kashmir!

560
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:56,021
Go away.

561
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:00,965
Listen... how did
the convicts escape?

562
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,470
He went out through
the commode, sir.

563
01:08:06,075 --> 01:08:09,841
This is no ordinary case, sir.
The minister wants quick results.

564
01:08:10,479 --> 01:08:15,212
There is only one officer who can
help you in such a sticky situation.

565
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:16,609
Who are you talking about?

566
01:08:16,986 --> 01:08:19,750
Who will the disciple talk
about, except his Guru?

567
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,248
No! Not Udham Singh!

568
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:26,493
There you are! He's talking
about a savage, sir!

569
01:08:26,795 --> 01:08:28,660
He's always looking
for a blood-bath!

570
01:08:28,964 --> 01:08:32,092
He's a law unto himself;
does anything that fancies him.

571
01:08:32,434 --> 01:08:34,493
He defies his seniors! The
boss does not like him either!

572
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:37,930
He has suspended him on 3 occasions!
Ask him!

573
01:08:38,274 --> 01:08:41,710
- I suspended him only 3 months ago.
- There you are!

574
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:45,069
He's eccentric and arrogant, all
right. But he's good at his work!

575
01:08:45,481 --> 01:08:46,948
He's a Class One Officer!

576
01:08:53,956 --> 01:08:55,685
There he is, sir.

577
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:03,289
- Hello, sir!
- Who's that?

578
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:08,535
It's me! Your fan! One who has
always admired your guts.

579
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:11,771
- I'm your...
- A sycophant!

580
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:20,276
Sit down.

581
01:09:20,883 --> 01:09:22,214
Look who's here to meet you.

582
01:09:23,652 --> 01:09:28,089
I see! The boss, eh?
Welcome, sir. Sit down.

583
01:09:28,657 --> 01:09:32,855
- What will you have?
- You know I don't drink.

584
01:09:33,495 --> 01:09:35,520
Let it arrive, sir.
I'll have it.

585
01:09:36,232 --> 01:09:39,929
He wants to discuss something
very important with you.

586
01:09:40,436 --> 01:09:46,068
Why not? He remembers me whenever
he's in hot-waters.

587
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:51,510
Isn't that true? Charity begins...
when the end is near!

588
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:55,613
It's two day since you've escaped.
The cops must have cooled off.

589
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:57,282
You guys can leave.

590
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:05,082
There you are, sir! Didn't I say
he would surely turn up?

591
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,053
Welcome to the department.

592
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:10,756
Give that to me.

593
01:10:13,702 --> 01:10:16,762
I want to ask you something before
I resume my duties, sir.

594
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:20,072
Whose law do I follow? My own?
Or that of the department?

595
01:10:21,076 --> 01:10:22,236
I want immediate results!

596
01:10:23,045 --> 01:10:28,540
Which means, I will not be asked
why I fired at their chests.

597
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:30,815
They always aim at our heads...

598
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,451
...and we are ordered to
fire at their legs!

599
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:37,524
Does the Government take us cops
to be sacrificial lambs?

600
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,451
That they feed us and
throw us around to die?

601
01:10:41,163 --> 01:10:42,824
Such laws are of
no use, sir.

602
01:10:43,299 --> 01:10:46,826
Your speech always sends
my adrenalin soaring, sir!

603
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:48,635
And I break into
a cold sweat!

604
01:10:49,438 --> 01:10:53,067
You will have to stay
within limits, Udham Singh.

605
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,237
I take on the spot
decisions, sir.

606
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:59,136
I decide the fate of the people
I find on the spot, sir.

607
01:10:59,848 --> 01:11:04,114
Do anything you wish.
But I want results.

608
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,547
Study this file.

609
01:11:08,824 --> 01:11:11,486
- I don't need it, sir.
- Why not?

610
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:16,325
It's a case of jail-break in which
three convicts have escaped prison.

611
01:11:16,665 --> 01:11:20,123
They are Sahil Sinha, Ganpat
Wagle and Shiva Murlidharan.

612
01:11:20,502 --> 01:11:22,197
The first mentioned has
killed the Governor.

613
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:24,664
The other two were serving
sentences for petty crimes.

614
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:33,845
It's exactly 27 hours, 22 minutes
and 15 seconds since they escaped.

615
01:11:34,116 --> 01:11:36,346
There is no lead. Isn't that
what the file says?

616
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,914
- How do you know all this?
- Didn't I tell you, sir?

617
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:41,482
I concentrate on
one thing at a time.

618
01:11:42,124 --> 01:11:43,955
I hit the bottle,
when I drink.

619
01:11:44,326 --> 01:11:46,317
But when I'm on duty,
it is only duty I do.

620
01:11:46,795 --> 01:11:48,956
I can spend all 24 hours
in the line of duty.

621
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:51,865
I will only be obsessed
with my duty now.

622
01:11:52,401 --> 01:11:56,098
And I will drink only after
I have closed this case.

623
01:12:04,913 --> 01:12:07,245
Send word to your families.

624
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:09,584
You will not go home
till this case is solved.

625
01:12:10,486 --> 01:12:14,013
The last time I
worked with him...

626
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,219
...I started suffering
from High Blood Pressure.

627
01:12:16,892 --> 01:12:20,225
The next step after High Blood
Pressure is a failure of the heart!

628
01:12:22,431 --> 01:12:24,831
- Why don't you join us, buddy?
- No. Go on ahead.

629
01:12:25,167 --> 01:12:26,691
Think it over.
You're making a mistake.

630
01:12:27,102 --> 01:12:29,536
Well, take care...
See you, if we live.

631
01:12:33,242 --> 01:12:35,142
Get in, Sahil.

632
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:42,875
- Where's the locket, Sheetal?
- I knew you'd ask for it.

633
01:12:43,352 --> 01:12:45,217
I've brought it along.

634
01:12:47,589 --> 01:12:49,489
This is the first step
towards my goal.

635
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:53,023
No. Your first step is my house.
The police are all around.

636
01:12:53,562 --> 01:12:55,052
You will spend the
night at my place.

637
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:59,691
Our old mansion would be the
ideal place for you to hide.

638
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:01,629
The police can never
get there.

639
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:08,777
Where are the fugitives?

640
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:17,644
Let me go, Inspector!
Or I'll shoot this girl!

641
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,988
I'm exhausted, Sheetal.

642
01:13:29,665 --> 01:13:32,600
I've escaped from prison.
But where will I go?

643
01:13:33,902 --> 01:13:36,735
There seems to be
darkness all around.

644
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:41,037
Who could be the real killer?

645
01:13:42,311 --> 01:13:46,441
I don't know if I will be
able to solve the riddle.

646
01:13:46,882 --> 01:13:49,009
You mustn't think too much.
I'm with you now.

647
01:13:49,418 --> 01:13:51,181
Give all your worries to me.

648
01:13:52,054 --> 01:13:53,521
You have been a very
good friend, Sheetal.

649
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,451
You have done something so
dangerous and difficult.

650
01:13:56,825 --> 01:14:02,593
No. It was easy. It's something
else that is difficult.

651
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:05,795
- What?!
- I'll explain later.

652
01:14:06,168 --> 01:14:09,035
Freshen up. I'll go and get you
something to eat.

653
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:11,497
I'll lock the door
from outside, okay?

654
01:15:01,423 --> 01:15:03,516
Hold it, Inspector!

655
01:15:03,859 --> 01:15:08,057
Lower your gun! Or I'll color
this guy's head with blood!

656
01:15:09,264 --> 01:15:12,028
Lower the gun, I say!

657
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:29,206
Anything amiss and the bullet
would have smashed my skull!

658
01:15:29,518 --> 01:15:32,646
But I had faith in
your marksmanship, sir!

659
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:34,252
But I had no faith.

660
01:15:52,107 --> 01:15:54,871
Didn't you ask me
what is difficult?

661
01:15:55,277 --> 01:15:57,370
This love of mine is
the greatest difficulty.

662
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:49,561
Sheetal? Open the door.

663
01:21:54,936 --> 01:21:58,167
The name is Inspector Udham Singh.
May I come in?

664
01:21:58,573 --> 01:21:59,164
No.

665
01:22:11,619 --> 01:22:14,281
I came to check out the
decor of your room.

666
01:22:17,859 --> 01:22:25,766
Looks like there was someone else
with you in this room last night.

667
01:22:26,134 --> 01:22:27,362
There are two beds.

668
01:22:29,437 --> 01:22:33,771
I'm in the habit of lying on
the sofa, while I'm reading.

669
01:22:34,075 --> 01:22:36,908
I go to bed, when
I'm really sleepy.

670
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,206
That's a nice habit. But I can't
see any book in your room.

671
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:46,379
- Where is Sahil Sinha?
- How would I know?

672
01:22:46,821 --> 01:22:49,984
You're wasting my time and
my daughter's too, Inspector.

673
01:22:50,425 --> 01:22:53,292
The boatman who helped the
convicts escape...

674
01:22:53,628 --> 01:22:57,325
...was paid half a million Rupees
by a girl.

675
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:59,089
Could be true. So?

676
01:22:59,567 --> 01:23:01,432
That's enough! I've got to
leave for the office.

677
01:23:01,803 --> 01:23:05,466
I must say. This is
a neat and tidy room.

678
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,168
No wonder then that any particle of
dust stands out like a sore thumb.

679
01:23:11,913 --> 01:23:14,973
Where could sand from the seas
have gotten into your room from?

680
01:23:15,483 --> 01:23:18,680
It was windy last night.
That must have caused this.

681
01:23:19,054 --> 01:23:25,254
Not even a storm could bring sand
into your room, Miss Sheetal.

682
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,653
Because your room does not
face the seas.

683
01:23:28,696 --> 01:23:30,288
I can hear water flowing.

684
01:23:31,066 --> 01:23:32,966
Excuse me. I was going
for a bath.

685
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:38,696
I want to know which soap you use!
The secret of your beauty!

686
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,103
Do not forget your
limits, Inspector!

687
01:23:42,277 --> 01:23:44,939
I can have you suspended with
a single telephone call!

688
01:23:45,914 --> 01:23:48,405
That's nothing unusual for him.

689
01:23:48,883 --> 01:23:51,875
He's been more under suspension
than on duty!

690
01:24:02,864 --> 01:24:04,058
He has escaped from the window.

691
01:24:04,799 --> 01:24:05,993
We arrived late, sir.

692
01:24:07,068 --> 01:24:09,832
- Why do we always arrive late?
- Shut up!

693
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:11,802
I know where he
must have gone.

694
01:24:12,207 --> 01:24:16,735
Wait, Inspector... you asked
about the sand, didn't you?

695
01:24:17,312 --> 01:24:19,439
It's the sand that was
on Sahil Sinha's shoes.

696
01:24:19,747 --> 01:24:21,544
Sheetal! What nonsense
are you talking?

697
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:27,013
You're right. There was someone else
with me in this bedroom last night.

698
01:24:27,422 --> 01:24:29,322
It was Sahil Sinha.

699
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:32,992
I'm the girl they told you about.

700
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:36,189
I'm the one who helped him
escape from the prison.

701
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:37,828
And I will continue
to help him.

702
01:24:38,299 --> 01:24:40,995
Because I know he's innocent!
And what will you do?

703
01:24:41,536 --> 01:24:43,697
Arrest me? Hang me?

704
01:24:44,139 --> 01:24:45,766
I do only one thing at a time.

705
01:24:46,374 --> 01:24:49,002
I want Sahil Sinha.
...Dead or alive.

706
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:52,971
And I have decided to save him!
Because I love him!

707
01:24:53,615 --> 01:24:56,209
Those in love can do a lot!
Just you remember that.

708
01:24:58,286 --> 01:25:01,881
- She's threatening us, sir!
- Must I take her in custody?

709
01:25:03,391 --> 01:25:06,758
She's a kid, inspector. Please
don't pay attention to her.

710
01:25:07,128 --> 01:25:08,823
Which is why I am
not arresting her.

711
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:11,955
I have an advise for
you, Mr. Chaudhary.

712
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,393
Send her away to Agra.

713
01:25:15,103 --> 01:25:17,333
They have the country's
largest madhouse there.

714
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:20,766
Let's go.

715
01:25:29,851 --> 01:25:32,149
- Yes?
- I'm Inspector Udham Singh.

716
01:25:32,854 --> 01:25:34,185
Is Mr. Ishwar Diwan there?

717
01:25:34,722 --> 01:25:37,384
- No.
- Who are you?

718
01:25:37,692 --> 01:25:39,956
I'm his daughter, Isha.
Please come in.

719
01:25:41,196 --> 01:25:43,164
No thank you.
I'm comfortable here.

720
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:46,724
What's all this about, Inspector?

721
01:25:47,936 --> 01:25:49,767
I have been following
Sahil Sinha's trail.

722
01:25:51,706 --> 01:25:53,139
He didn't come here,
did he?

723
01:25:53,675 --> 01:25:57,668
No. You can come inside
and take a look.

724
01:25:58,046 --> 01:25:59,809
You were going to get
engaged to him, right?

725
01:26:00,381 --> 01:26:01,177
Yes.

726
01:26:01,716 --> 01:26:03,980
He will certainly come
to meet you.

727
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:06,678
You appear to be a sensible girl.

728
01:26:07,322 --> 01:26:11,383
Tell him not to harass me and make
me run around unnecessarily.

729
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:13,558
Or he will face
the consequences.

730
01:26:14,262 --> 01:26:16,992
I will gun him down
the moment I see him.

731
01:26:40,255 --> 01:26:43,622
We find it difficult to
handle one woman at home!

732
01:26:44,092 --> 01:26:48,153
And this young chap has gone
for a fling with two of them!

733
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,263
What could be his formula?

734
01:26:50,565 --> 01:26:52,624
Concentrate on your work, Pandu.

735
01:26:53,034 --> 01:26:57,903
If you lose your job, you will forget
the formula of handling your wife!

736
01:27:04,045 --> 01:27:05,137
Your life is in danger!

737
01:27:05,713 --> 01:27:07,442
The Inspector will
shoot you at sight!

738
01:27:08,283 --> 01:27:10,615
We must go away to
some far-off place!

739
01:27:10,752 --> 01:27:16,452
If something happens to you,
I will die without you!

740
01:27:17,592 --> 01:27:20,891
I love you, Sahil...
I love you very much!

741
01:27:21,462 --> 01:27:23,225
I love you very much, too.

742
01:27:23,898 --> 01:27:27,356
But how long will I keep
running away from this problem?

743
01:27:27,802 --> 01:27:30,930
- I'll have to find a solution.
- How?

744
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,431
Perhaps Doctor Gandhi can help me.

745
01:27:35,877 --> 01:27:40,439
He's one man my father discussed
all his problems with.

746
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:48,006
There you are! This is how
he jumps all day!

747
01:27:48,348 --> 01:27:50,942
He thinks Sahil Sinha
has arrived!

748
01:27:51,484 --> 01:27:52,610
Shut up!

749
01:27:53,286 --> 01:27:58,053
Do something, doctor! Or I'm
going to be a nervous wreck!

750
01:28:02,729 --> 01:28:03,991
This is Sahil, doctor.

751
01:28:05,432 --> 01:28:07,400
Who is that?!

752
01:28:08,435 --> 01:28:10,335
It's a patient of mine.

753
01:28:14,774 --> 01:28:18,369
I've got to meet you, Dr. Gandhi.

754
01:28:18,645 --> 01:28:19,976
I want to meet you, too.

755
01:28:22,182 --> 01:28:26,175
I want to discuss
a secret with you.

756
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:27,812
A secret?!

757
01:28:28,688 --> 01:28:35,150
Yes. But it wouldn't be proper to
reveal it over the phone.

758
01:28:37,664 --> 01:28:41,998
Come to my house at 10.30 tonight.

759
01:28:44,571 --> 01:28:45,663
And take care.

760
01:30:17,964 --> 01:30:19,056
Who's that?

761
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:22,658
Murder! You have
murdered my master!

762
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:31,141
Murder! A bloody murder!

763
01:31:27,801 --> 01:31:30,861
- What the hell are you up to?
- Trying to figure out the case!

764
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:34,001
- How must he have stabbed him...
- Will you stab me?!

765
01:31:34,307 --> 01:31:38,073
That's exactly how my master died,
while he sat there in his chair.

766
01:31:38,578 --> 01:31:40,341
File the F.I.R.!
Cut the bloody drama!

767
01:31:40,747 --> 01:31:44,774
- We have filed the F.I.R., sir!
- Sahil Sinha has murdered him!

768
01:31:47,687 --> 01:31:50,781
- Is this knife from your house?
- No... I see, question him!

769
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:54,385
Could you find any
finger-prints, Neelkanth?

770
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:58,219
This is his second murder, sir.
He won't make the mistake again.

771
01:31:58,698 --> 01:32:00,928
He's now a B.C., after
his stint in prison.

772
01:32:01,201 --> 01:32:04,102
- What's that?
- A Bachelor of Crime.

773
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:11,039
Both these daggers seem to be
of the same make and mould.

774
01:32:11,778 --> 01:32:13,473
They appear to be part
of a knife-set.

775
01:32:14,914 --> 01:32:16,142
Which set could that be?

776
01:32:16,783 --> 01:32:19,684
My God! There goes
another gentleman!

777
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,580
I don't understand why he must
have killed doctor Gandhi.

778
01:32:23,923 --> 01:32:26,153
If he doesn't mind, I would
like to offer some help.

779
01:32:26,493 --> 01:32:29,360
Please do. I'd welcome
any help from the public.

780
01:32:29,796 --> 01:32:31,058
What do you propose to do?

781
01:32:31,431 --> 01:32:34,195
We can announce a reward for those
who have him arrested, brother.

782
01:32:34,934 --> 01:32:40,429
Anyone capturing Sahil alive or dead
will get 10 million Rupees.

783
01:32:41,407 --> 01:32:45,901
Perhaps the lure of money will make
the public get hold of him.

784
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:50,545
Why do we need the police, if we're
going to take help from the public?

785
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:58,046
Patwardhan! Your department is
a liability to the state treasury!

786
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:01,518
What do the police get from your
treasury anyway, Mr. Minister?

787
01:33:01,928 --> 01:33:04,522
3,500 for the inspectors and
2500 for the constables?

788
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:07,729
Not even attendants in banks would
work for such a pittance nowadays!

789
01:33:08,535 --> 01:33:10,002
Who's this arrogant man?

790
01:33:10,403 --> 01:33:13,600
I haven't donned this uniform to
make 3,500 from you?

791
01:33:14,207 --> 01:33:16,402
Neither am I interested in making
money from under the table!

792
01:33:17,744 --> 01:33:20,406
I have this obsession of
cleaning society of its filth!

793
01:33:21,447 --> 01:33:26,976
Anyone who has this obsession
is often an arrogant man.

794
01:33:28,254 --> 01:33:31,087
That's Inspector Udham Singh...
He's in-charge of the case.

795
01:33:33,293 --> 01:33:36,524
He's the one who shot dead the
other two convicts.

796
01:33:36,829 --> 01:33:38,126
I see!

797
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:46,030
I'm confident now that he will
surely nab the killer!

798
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:49,099
Please arrest that man
immediately, Mr. Commissioner!

799
01:33:49,409 --> 01:33:51,104
Or else, my daughter
could lose her life!

800
01:33:51,511 --> 01:33:52,910
What's wrong, Mr. Diwan?

801
01:33:53,346 --> 01:33:55,541
Sahil Sinha has run away
with his daughter.

802
01:33:55,949 --> 01:33:58,782
His daughter and his car have been
missing since last night, sir.

803
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:06,354
Where have you brought me so
far away from the city, Isha?

804
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:12,063
Your life is in danger. You are now
being accused for Gandhi's murder.

805
01:34:12,532 --> 01:34:15,160
Staying in the city
could claim your life.

806
01:34:15,835 --> 01:34:19,965
But I can't find a way if
I run away from the problem.

807
01:34:22,642 --> 01:34:24,507
Your life is like
my own life, Sahil.

808
01:34:25,011 --> 01:34:29,175
And I'm taking my life away
from all the dangers.

809
01:34:30,149 --> 01:34:33,050
To a place where we live...
and that, does.

810
01:34:33,353 --> 01:34:38,723
- What's that?
- Our love, Sahil.

811
01:34:43,162 --> 01:34:47,599
10 million! It's a bloody
goldmine, boss!

812
01:34:48,001 --> 01:34:51,562
The forest guard confirms
what this newspaper says.

813
01:34:52,005 --> 01:34:56,499
That the boy has entered
our state with the girl.

814
01:34:56,909 --> 01:35:00,743
This money has virtually
walked into our state, Sikander.

815
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,772
No one, not even the cops, must
get their hands on this boy.

816
01:40:58,838 --> 01:41:02,501
Your time is up.

817
01:41:04,377 --> 01:41:05,173
Get up.

818
01:41:12,885 --> 01:41:18,084
Hand him over to us, Inspector

819
01:41:21,227 --> 01:41:25,459
No! Don't make that mistake!

820
01:41:26,332 --> 01:41:30,564
Take a look over there.

821
01:41:36,609 --> 01:41:37,735
Leave the girl alone!

822
01:41:38,411 --> 01:41:40,675
It has to do with 10 million
Rupees, Inspector.

823
01:41:41,881 --> 01:41:45,282
We don't trust you, Inspector.

824
01:42:06,138 --> 01:42:09,767
I have been framed, Inspector.
I have killed no one.

825
01:42:10,643 --> 01:42:11,541
Please let me go.

826
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:13,344
I do only one at a time.

827
01:42:13,813 --> 01:42:16,043
Right now, I'm busy catching you.

828
01:42:16,549 --> 01:42:20,747
- Why don't you understand...
- My only goal is Sahil Sinha!

829
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:24,851
And my only goal is to find
the true killer of my father!

830
01:42:25,157 --> 01:42:29,491
Stop arguing with me! Or I'm
going to drag your corpse away!

831
01:42:29,862 --> 01:42:34,231
In that case, open fire!
Or you will regret it.

832
01:42:40,306 --> 01:42:42,467
You have used up all
the six bullets it had.

833
01:42:42,808 --> 01:42:44,537
Now try and save yourself
from me!

834
01:43:22,948 --> 01:43:26,281
There's no point in waiting here.
Let's return.

835
01:43:52,111 --> 01:43:53,738
Where are you going
with the will?

836
01:43:54,747 --> 01:43:57,341
- Answer me!
- It will help Sahil, mother.

837
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:59,945
Don't you know what he has
done to your father?

838
01:44:00,419 --> 01:44:02,080
Sahil can't be a bad man.

839
01:44:02,454 --> 01:44:06,788
- Stop arguing and give that to me...
- No!

840
01:44:12,064 --> 01:44:12,996
What have you come here for?

841
01:44:13,432 --> 01:44:16,629
Aren't you satisfied, now that
you have killed your father?

842
01:44:17,036 --> 01:44:18,765
I have not killed anyone, Mom.

843
01:44:19,238 --> 01:44:23,038
I'm looking for the real killer.

844
01:44:23,509 --> 01:44:28,503
I don't want to talk to you. Go
away... or I will call the police!

845
01:44:28,981 --> 01:44:31,381
- Please forgive him, Mother.
- Keep out of this!

846
01:44:32,017 --> 01:44:35,475
And should you want me to live,
don't talk to him ever again!

847
01:44:36,522 --> 01:44:40,219
He means nothing to us.

848
01:44:40,759 --> 01:44:42,249
You have no brother!
Do you understand?

849
01:44:42,628 --> 01:44:46,621
You are making the very
mistake I made, mother.

850
01:44:47,066 --> 01:44:50,661
I could understand how much Dad
loved me, only after losing him.

851
01:44:51,103 --> 01:44:55,972
I hope you don't realize the truth
only after you have lost me.

852
01:45:01,914 --> 01:45:04,280
What was that, sir?
I must ask Mr. Gupta to eat...

853
01:45:04,717 --> 01:45:07,515
...give this file to
Magistrate Narayan...

854
01:45:07,953 --> 01:45:09,978
...and whom am I supposed to call?

855
01:45:10,322 --> 01:45:16,557
Idiot! Give the file to Mr. Gupta,
telephone Magistrate Narayan...

856
01:45:16,962 --> 01:45:19,522
...and you yourself may
go and eat!

857
01:45:19,865 --> 01:45:24,734
He was here yesterday, to
take his father's will away.

858
01:45:25,871 --> 01:45:30,399
Is it the same will the advocate
Thanawala had prepared?

859
01:45:30,743 --> 01:45:32,404
- The one which figured in court?
- Yes.

860
01:45:43,222 --> 01:45:48,660
Are you back? Go away, I say!

861
01:45:55,334 --> 01:45:56,995
Sahil! It's you, son?!

862
01:45:58,003 --> 01:46:02,337
What's up, son? You look worried!

863
01:46:03,409 --> 01:46:07,778
A grave injustice has been
done to you! Sit down...

864
01:46:08,047 --> 01:46:12,245
It's thanks to you that I have
been branded a murderer!

865
01:46:13,285 --> 01:46:15,185
You're mistaken, son.
I've done nothing!

866
01:46:17,723 --> 01:46:21,716
Try ringing the bell or screaming
and I'll crush your hand!

867
01:46:23,829 --> 01:46:26,161
Everything's going
haywire, sir.

868
01:46:26,532 --> 01:46:29,126
My mind has gone blank!
I've got to call Mr. Gupta...

869
01:46:29,468 --> 01:46:32,995
...ask the magistrate to have a bath
and who's to be given the food?

870
01:46:37,609 --> 01:46:38,803
- Hello!
- Hi.

871
01:46:40,546 --> 01:46:43,447
I think I've seen you somewhere.
Now where was that?

872
01:46:45,818 --> 01:46:47,080
- I remember now!
- Do you really?

873
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:49,579
I saw his picture
in the newspapers!

874
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:53,617
You must have. I interview people
as I'm interviewing your boss.

875
01:46:53,959 --> 01:46:56,359
Please do a good job. This is
his first interview!

876
01:46:56,695 --> 01:46:58,356
Sure! I will do a good job!

877
01:47:05,404 --> 01:47:10,933
After this interview, the boss's
picture will appear in the newspaper!

878
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:15,177
- What is it?
- It's the Governor's will!

879
01:47:15,647 --> 01:47:19,845
Yes! And you did not reveal every
detail of this document in court!

880
01:47:20,185 --> 01:47:22,380
You have concealed the most
important factor!

881
01:47:22,855 --> 01:47:25,119
It says that should something happen
to me after father's death...

882
01:47:25,491 --> 01:47:27,686
...you will be custodian
of all his wealth!

883
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:31,587
So you killed my father and
framed me for the murder!

884
01:47:31,964 --> 01:47:34,558
That would clear your path!

885
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:40,661
- Where is Thanawala's office?
- Who's that? I don't remember.

886
01:47:41,774 --> 01:47:46,768
- But you work for Thanawala!
- Oh yes! I work for him!

887
01:47:49,815 --> 01:47:52,147
Mercy, son! Have mercy on me!

888
01:47:52,484 --> 01:47:54,918
- Admit to your crime first!
- I confess!

889
01:47:55,421 --> 01:47:59,016
I have betrayed the Governor!
I was blinded by greed!

890
01:47:59,725 --> 01:48:02,922
- So I manipulated the will.
- You've committed the murders, too!

891
01:48:03,295 --> 01:48:06,389
That's not true, son!
I have committed the murders.

892
01:48:06,665 --> 01:48:08,599
You won't come around politely!

893
01:48:08,934 --> 01:48:12,563
- Have you seen this man?
- It's a familiar face...

894
01:48:13,505 --> 01:48:17,464
- Where have you seen him?
- You can't remember, right?

895
01:48:17,776 --> 01:48:19,937
How much are you going
to hit me, Sahil?

896
01:48:20,245 --> 01:48:23,578
Give it a thought! What would I
gain out of murdering Dr. Gandhi?

897
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:28,276
- Of course, I remember...
- Speak up then!

898
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:29,746
I saw him in a lawyer's office.

899
01:48:33,659 --> 01:48:36,787
- Oh yes! I remember it all!
- Do you really?

900
01:48:37,296 --> 01:48:39,730
I've seen this guy in
Thanawala's office!

901
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,639
That had to be Thanawala!

902
01:49:09,795 --> 01:49:13,424
I remember a couplet, now
that I'm in this state.

903
01:49:13,765 --> 01:49:16,290
Wouldn't you like to hear it?

904
01:49:16,668 --> 01:49:20,434
"The trees and the roses...
they all know how I feel"

905
01:49:20,806 --> 01:49:25,641
"If there's anyone ignorant,
it's the cops"

906
01:49:26,712 --> 01:49:29,977
Wow! Now here is a poet
in bandages!

907
01:49:30,415 --> 01:49:33,714
This is a casualty ward,
not a poet's conference.

908
01:49:34,386 --> 01:49:35,910
Please give us your
statement, Mr. Thanawala.

909
01:49:37,222 --> 01:49:41,955
Sahil Sinha flung me down
from the 2nd floor...

910
01:49:42,261 --> 01:49:44,195
...with the intention
of killing me.

911
01:49:44,596 --> 01:49:46,826
Make sure you press charges against
him for murder, Inspector.

912
01:49:47,499 --> 01:49:50,798
We'd have done that, had
only you been murdered!

913
01:49:51,803 --> 01:49:56,365
- But it will now Section 307.
- That's right. Half a murder.

914
01:49:56,975 --> 01:49:58,442
But why did he attack you?

915
01:49:59,144 --> 01:50:05,947
He wants to kill everyone who
testified against him in court.

916
01:50:06,985 --> 01:50:10,318
Shut up! What on earth
are you laughing for?!

917
01:50:10,756 --> 01:50:13,054
You had testified
against him, too!

918
01:50:15,694 --> 01:50:18,686
I think this ward could do
with some more beds, sir.

919
01:50:18,931 --> 01:50:20,455
For an emergency, that is.

920
01:50:20,899 --> 01:50:22,924
Please do something
about this, Udham Singh!

921
01:50:23,302 --> 01:50:25,964
He has committed three killings
while you are still around!

922
01:50:26,772 --> 01:50:30,003
- Two and a half, actually.
- This is half a murder, you know.

923
01:50:30,475 --> 01:50:32,204
All right! That makes it
2 and a half murders!

924
01:50:32,477 --> 01:50:34,206
The police have done
all they could.

925
01:50:34,947 --> 01:50:38,075
It would be wise now to make our
own arrangements of security.

926
01:50:38,483 --> 01:50:42,544
If I happen to kill the
boy in self-defense...

927
01:50:42,888 --> 01:50:46,051
...will I be guilty of murder?
- No.

928
01:50:48,293 --> 01:50:54,698
Stop laughing! And ask the
Commissioner to give us protection!

929
01:50:55,167 --> 01:51:01,333
I want special security arrangements
around me, through out the day!

930
01:51:01,707 --> 01:51:05,643
Please don't worry.
I'm investigating the case.

931
01:51:06,645 --> 01:51:11,981
I can't figure it out. Who's the
killer, if not Thanawala?

932
01:51:12,517 --> 01:51:17,648
It was a cleverly executed murder
right inside the house.

933
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:20,991
He was familiar with the
topography of the house.

934
01:51:21,393 --> 01:51:23,122
Which is why no one saw him.

935
01:51:24,029 --> 01:51:27,590
It has to be someone we know...
someone close to us.

936
01:51:28,867 --> 01:51:30,266
But who can that be?

937
01:51:32,137 --> 01:51:35,072
Whoever he was, he couldn't have
been a friend of your Dad.

938
01:51:36,975 --> 01:51:41,776
I think it's either a feud or a large
gain that has motivated this murder.

939
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,513
The large gain! You're right!

940
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:47,617
Since my father was a Governor,
a public figure...

941
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:50,488
...somebody must surely have
gained from his death!

942
01:51:51,189 --> 01:51:53,555
And I'm a mere student...

943
01:51:53,992 --> 01:51:57,758
...who could frame me for murder
and gain from it?

944
01:51:58,597 --> 01:52:04,399
The real killer! No wonder he put
a reward of 10 million on my head!

945
01:52:04,703 --> 01:52:07,695
So I'd get caught and his
misdeeds would remain a secret!

946
01:52:08,306 --> 01:52:11,400
You're talking about Meghnath
Chaudhary and his brother!

947
01:52:14,012 --> 01:52:17,140
Why have you brought me here?
What have I at the Shipping Yard.

948
01:52:17,783 --> 01:52:20,684
What's all this about, Sheetal?
Why don't you tell me?

949
01:52:24,356 --> 01:52:29,692
What are you hiding, Sheetal?
Why have you brought me here?

950
01:52:30,028 --> 01:52:34,829
- I have a surprise for you, Daddy.
- Really? What is it?

951
01:52:46,411 --> 01:52:48,572
Sahil wants to ask you
some questions, dad.

952
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,677
This is not done, Sheetal.
You shouldn't have done this.

953
01:52:51,016 --> 01:52:53,678
What makes you scared to
see me here, Mr. Chaudhary?

954
01:52:54,219 --> 01:52:56,278
Why have you broken
into a cold sweat?

955
01:52:56,621 --> 01:52:59,818
No, I'm not scared, Sahil.
This area belongs to me.

956
01:53:00,525 --> 01:53:03,016
If I wish, I could see that
you don't leave alive.

957
01:53:03,328 --> 01:53:07,230
That's my first question. Why do
you want to have me killed?

958
01:53:07,566 --> 01:53:09,830
- What?! Why would I...
- Answer him, dad.

959
01:53:10,135 --> 01:53:11,397
I understand it all!

960
01:53:11,837 --> 01:53:17,241
You wanted the Governor's signature
on some important documents.

961
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:22,076
- Didn't you?
- Yes. I did.

962
01:53:22,748 --> 01:53:27,447
And you killed the Governor because
you did not get his signatures!

963
01:53:27,953 --> 01:53:33,050
What?! You're crazy! I have
not killed any Governor...

964
01:53:33,658 --> 01:53:37,025
- Admit it! You have killed him!
- But I haven't...

965
01:53:38,563 --> 01:53:41,031
You've gone mad, Sahil!

966
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:44,334
I swear by my daughter!
I have not killed anyone!

967
01:53:44,669 --> 01:53:46,330
- You're lying...
- Hold it, Sahil!

968
01:53:46,605 --> 01:53:48,129
He hasn't killed him,
if he says he hasn't.

969
01:53:48,607 --> 01:53:50,472
He'd never take a false
oath in my name!

970
01:53:50,876 --> 01:53:54,676
Okay, Sahil! I've cheated people
in business! I've been a fraud!

971
01:53:55,013 --> 01:53:56,537
But I am not a murderer!

972
01:53:56,882 --> 01:53:58,975
Then why have you placed a reward
of 10 million on my head?

973
01:53:59,251 --> 01:54:02,516
- Have I...
- It was me, not him.

974
01:54:02,788 --> 01:54:05,723
I'm going to keep the money
to myself now, brother.

975
01:54:06,324 --> 01:54:08,690
I've even telephoned
Inspector Udham Singh.

976
01:54:09,494 --> 01:54:11,621
You have called the wrong place.

977
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:15,388
Because you're going to need
an ambulance, not Udham Singh.

978
01:55:58,803 --> 01:56:01,328
Your face is worth
looking at, Inspector!

979
01:56:01,673 --> 01:56:05,109
It appears as I've snatched
a bone from a dog's mouth!

980
01:56:07,012 --> 01:56:10,504
I'm feeling sorry for you!

981
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:14,450
I'd advise you to save some
of your laughter, Miss Sheetal.

982
01:56:15,053 --> 01:56:19,217
This is how you will laugh
when I shoot Sahil.

983
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:23,049
Because you will be an
absolute lunatic by then.

984
01:56:23,395 --> 01:56:26,421
Come on, inspector!
Stop dreaming!

985
01:56:26,998 --> 01:56:30,331
You can't as much as touch Sahil,
so long as I'm alive!

986
01:56:32,304 --> 01:56:37,571
Watch out... careful, please!
Be gentle!

987
01:56:42,547 --> 01:56:47,849
I remember another couplet
hearing you groan like this.

988
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:52,686
"He's here in my ward,
thanks to Sahil"

989
01:56:53,058 --> 01:56:57,222
"I gape at his plasters
and my own bandages"

990
01:56:59,764 --> 01:57:02,062
There he is!
The poet in bandages!

991
01:57:02,534 --> 01:57:06,402
My word! He seems to have been
run over by a road-roller!

992
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:10,374
Shut up!

993
01:57:10,675 --> 01:57:13,906
- That's the second half-murder.
- You're right!

994
01:57:14,412 --> 01:57:17,245
- You can call it three murders!
- Shut up!

995
01:57:18,083 --> 01:57:21,177
- It's not me. He's laughing!
- Never mind.

996
01:57:21,553 --> 01:57:23,817
May we record his statement
now, Mr. Neelkanth?

997
01:57:24,356 --> 01:57:27,382
My foot! He's in bad shape!

998
01:57:27,726 --> 01:57:30,194
He has a dog's leash!
And a iron-rod in his feet!

999
01:57:30,795 --> 01:57:32,228
Is it really iron?

1000
01:57:38,436 --> 01:57:41,564
Why must you endanger
your life for Sahil?

1001
01:57:41,973 --> 01:57:44,203
He doesn't love you. So why
must you keep chasing him?

1002
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:46,840
There's no saying when he will
have a change of heart.

1003
01:57:47,245 --> 01:57:49,406
And I'm helping him only
because I'm in love with him.

1004
01:57:49,748 --> 01:57:51,909
You're making a mistake!
He's using you!

1005
01:57:52,317 --> 01:57:55,081
- He loves only Isha!
- That's not true!

1006
01:57:55,553 --> 01:57:59,080
Not any longer! He used to
love her earlier. But now...

1007
01:57:59,457 --> 01:58:01,288
...he trusts only me!

1008
01:58:04,195 --> 01:58:08,791
I'll get him to tell me tonight
that he loves me alone!

1009
02:04:01,519 --> 02:04:04,750
What brings you to the police
station so early in the day?

1010
02:04:05,223 --> 02:04:08,283
- I've been here all night.
- Have you got a new case now?

1011
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:13,558
I've been trying to figure out
what Sahil Sinha really is.

1012
02:04:13,998 --> 02:04:15,363
I've been going through his file.

1013
02:04:15,733 --> 02:04:19,499
Why be so interested in his file,
when you're going to gun him down?

1014
02:04:19,971 --> 02:04:23,202
This file tells me
who his next target is.

1015
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:31,214
That's the money
I pay you, as usual.

1016
02:04:31,716 --> 02:04:38,781
And this is your birthday gift.
A golden wrist-watch.

1017
02:04:39,190 --> 02:04:41,624
So you remember my birthday, too!

1018
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:44,122
It's a nice gift.

1019
02:04:45,062 --> 02:04:48,930
A golden-watch!
Just what you like, boss.

1020
02:04:52,336 --> 02:04:54,736
I have a gift for you, too.

1021
02:04:55,406 --> 02:04:57,499
The locket you had lost...

1022
02:04:57,842 --> 02:05:01,744
...in my father's hands when
you murdered him!

1023
02:05:02,146 --> 02:05:06,207
This is not my locket.
But today it will belong to me.

1024
02:06:43,414 --> 02:06:46,042
Hit him! Clobber him!

1025
02:07:13,377 --> 02:07:16,039
Kill him! Give it to him!

1026
02:07:27,792 --> 02:07:31,990
No! If you kill me, you will never
know who killed your father!

1027
02:07:32,296 --> 02:07:35,322
I know who did it!
I know the killer!

1028
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:39,593
- Who killed him?
- It was a political killing!

1029
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:43,236
It was the Minister
who murdered him!

1030
02:07:48,079 --> 02:07:51,606
Let Vilas Rao alone, Sahil!

1031
02:07:52,049 --> 02:07:53,277
You're catching the wrong man!

1032
02:07:54,652 --> 02:07:57,314
This is police matter.
He's a run away convict!

1033
02:07:58,522 --> 02:08:01,320
You think he's a convict!
Not us!

1034
02:08:02,059 --> 02:08:05,460
The young man has done what we
couldn't do in all these years!

1035
02:08:05,997 --> 02:08:09,489
He has taught a crooked
union leader a lesson!

1036
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:11,595
We will not let you
take him away!

1037
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:15,363
Out of my way!

1038
02:08:17,642 --> 02:08:19,405
Out of my way, I say!

1039
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:44,993
Here's a couplet to celebrate
your arrival, Vilas Rao.

1040
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:53,600
"A great time will be had
when the wounded get together!

1041
02:08:54,912 --> 02:08:58,507
- Minister!
- What is it?

1042
02:09:00,951 --> 02:09:04,819
Come closer... I've made
a very big mistake.

1043
02:09:05,256 --> 02:09:08,692
I had to tell Sahil you're guilty,
to save myself from him.

1044
02:09:08,959 --> 02:09:10,483
Damn you!

1045
02:09:11,228 --> 02:09:13,128
Forgive me, please.

1046
02:09:13,597 --> 02:09:20,161
Another couplet, while
you leave, Minister.

1047
02:09:20,805 --> 02:09:29,611
"I shall await you till you
come here, hurt by Sahil"

1048
02:09:34,518 --> 02:09:37,214
Here you are, Anna!
This is 2 million Rupees.

1049
02:09:37,621 --> 02:09:41,318
Tell you what, mister?
Go to sleep peacefully.

1050
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:46,186
This will be our first
and last meeting.

1051
02:09:47,231 --> 02:09:48,528
I will not meet you again.

1052
02:09:49,934 --> 02:09:54,394
But I will certainly send you
Sahil Sinha's dead-body.

1053
02:09:58,309 --> 02:10:00,971
You must bring the minister
to the show tomorrow.

1054
02:10:01,312 --> 02:10:03,644
- Or I'll have to leave the city.
- Leave the city?

1055
02:10:03,981 --> 02:10:07,075
Yes, Sheetal. For how many days
can I run away from the law?

1056
02:10:07,351 --> 02:10:09,114
Udham Singh has been following him
like his death.

1057
02:10:09,487 --> 02:10:11,216
If the killer is not caught
by tomorrow night...

1058
02:10:11,689 --> 02:10:14,658
...both of us will leave the city
and go away somewhere...

1059
02:10:15,059 --> 02:10:16,617
...where nobody recognizes us.

1060
02:10:16,927 --> 02:10:19,293
But I have a feeling that
I'm close to my goal.

1061
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:21,698
You have always been close
to your destination, Sahil.

1062
02:10:22,366 --> 02:10:24,596
I'm your goal!

1063
02:10:28,172 --> 02:10:32,370
See you tomorrow, Sahil. I will
bring the minister to the show.

1064
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:36,771
How much will you help me? Won't I
ever get the chance to help you?

1065
02:10:37,081 --> 02:10:40,278
Don't worry. You're the one I will
look to, when the need arises.

1066
02:10:41,385 --> 02:10:45,378
It's necessary for the Minister
to come tomorrow, Sheetal.

1067
02:10:45,756 --> 02:10:47,724
Have faith in me. Bye...

1068
02:10:55,299 --> 02:10:59,565
What's up? Sheetal is much too
kindly disposed towards you.

1069
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:02,962
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch. It's simple.

1070
02:11:04,175 --> 02:11:07,508
She's not really as simple
as she appears to be.

1071
02:11:08,012 --> 02:11:11,880
She's evil, deep within.
You mustn't trust such girls.

1072
02:11:12,683 --> 02:11:15,083
- Don't you trust me?
- I do trust you.

1073
02:11:15,619 --> 02:11:20,386
But I don't trust woman. Hell hath
no fury like a woman spurned!

1074
02:11:20,691 --> 02:11:24,787
Really? What if I cut
myself off from you?

1075
02:11:25,229 --> 02:11:29,063
- You'll cut yourself off from me?
- Suppose I do. What will you do?

1076
02:11:30,067 --> 02:11:32,092
- I'd devour you!
- How'd you do that?

1077
02:11:38,275 --> 02:11:41,210
So you're willing to be
our Chief Guest!

1078
02:11:41,779 --> 02:11:47,240
To see the girls dance, I will
cancel all my other programs.

1079
02:11:48,519 --> 02:11:51,420
But I have a problem.

1080
02:11:52,022 --> 02:11:55,150
Problem? What problem?

1081
02:11:55,793 --> 02:12:00,093
There's someone who is
baying for my life!

1082
02:12:01,799 --> 02:12:06,793
I take my security guards along,
wherever I go.

1083
02:12:07,238 --> 02:12:12,266
We would not like to inconvenience
you in such a situation.

1084
02:12:12,610 --> 02:12:16,068
I'll try to find another Chief
Guest for my function.

1085
02:12:16,647 --> 02:12:22,381
- Let's go.
- Wait... don't be dejected!

1086
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:26,749
I'll definitely find a way.

1087
02:12:27,758 --> 02:12:34,095
For your sake especially, I will
leave my guards outside the hall.

1088
02:12:41,305 --> 02:12:44,502
You will be there on time,
won't you?

1089
02:12:44,942 --> 02:12:46,569
Certainly! He has arrived!

1090
02:19:23,173 --> 02:19:27,701
What the hell is all this?
Where are you taking me?!

1091
02:19:28,045 --> 02:19:30,411
Let me go! For God's sake!

1092
02:19:30,747 --> 02:19:35,207
What are you doing?
Leave me alone!

1093
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:44,750
Don't try something funny, because
this revolver is loaded today.

1094
02:19:45,095 --> 02:19:48,030
You have been lucky so far.
But your bad days begin.

1095
02:19:49,333 --> 02:19:50,800
Step out, Miss Isha.

1096
02:19:52,536 --> 02:19:55,096
Let us go, Inspector.
Or I'll kill the Minister.

1097
02:19:55,839 --> 02:19:57,636
- Go ahead and kill him.
- What are you saying?!

1098
02:19:58,241 --> 02:20:00,573
I have just one goal...
and that is Sahil Sinha.

1099
02:20:01,578 --> 02:20:02,374
Come out.

1100
02:20:03,647 --> 02:20:07,674
Open fire, if you must.
But I will not stop.

1101
02:20:19,129 --> 02:20:19,788
Go on.

1102
02:20:21,164 --> 02:20:24,691
Inspector! I'll have you suspended!

1103
02:20:25,435 --> 02:20:29,895
I won't spare you!
Help me, someone!

1104
02:20:32,542 --> 02:20:33,907
What have you done, sir?!

1105
02:20:34,945 --> 02:20:38,574
Only a truthful man
can take a bullet.

1106
02:20:39,549 --> 02:20:44,111
That young man's courage
reminds me of my youth.

1107
02:20:45,722 --> 02:20:49,123
I have suddenly woken up
to the human in me.

1108
02:20:49,459 --> 02:20:51,757
I didn't ever see
this side of you, sir.

1109
02:20:52,329 --> 02:20:55,765
We were wrong, Neelkanth.
That boy can't be the killer.

1110
02:20:56,533 --> 02:21:00,299
What are you doing, son?
Stop playing with fire!

1111
02:21:00,704 --> 02:21:05,300
I swear! I have not
killed the Governor!

1112
02:21:05,642 --> 02:21:07,974
Don't make me angrier, or
I'll burn your feet!

1113
02:21:10,647 --> 02:21:15,448
You're making a mistake, son!
I have not committed the murder!

1114
02:21:15,786 --> 02:21:18,220
You're lying!
Vilas Rao has himself named you!

1115
02:21:19,556 --> 02:21:25,358
I swear by the holy rivers!
I have not killed anyone!

1116
02:21:29,666 --> 02:21:32,464
I kept the insurance documents
at home, since you told me to.

1117
02:21:33,003 --> 02:21:34,265
We'll leave, once we have
collected the documents.

1118
02:21:35,439 --> 02:21:36,428
Welcome.

1119
02:21:37,841 --> 02:21:41,834
You've come at a good time, Diwan.
Greetings, Mrs. Sinha.

1120
02:21:44,281 --> 02:21:47,717
We were about to have the tea.
You must join us, too.

1121
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:53,819
- I've good news for you, Mrs. Sinha.
- Really?

1122
02:21:54,191 --> 02:21:56,182
- I have news of your daughter.
- Have you found her?

1123
02:21:56,793 --> 02:21:59,591
- Please sit down.
- Did you find her?

1124
02:21:59,963 --> 02:22:04,491
I thought that Sahil had forcibly
run away with your girl.

1125
02:22:05,001 --> 02:22:07,834
The truth is that she has
left with him, on her own.

1126
02:22:08,171 --> 02:22:09,138
How can that be?!

1127
02:22:10,507 --> 02:22:15,444
It's true. You hid the truth from
me, although you knew everything.

1128
02:22:15,812 --> 02:22:19,407
- What are you trying to say?
- The tea, sir.

1129
02:22:19,916 --> 02:22:22,714
I don't know what you've been
planning on the sly.

1130
02:22:23,453 --> 02:22:26,479
But the truth is that
you have lied to me.

1131
02:22:27,123 --> 02:22:30,149
And a man normally lies under
two kinds of situations.

1132
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:32,792
Either when he is in danger or
when he wants to keep a secret.

1133
02:22:34,764 --> 02:22:38,461
How much sugar would you like?
...how much of sugar?

1134
02:22:39,870 --> 02:22:44,000
You will be happy to know that
your son is not the murderer.

1135
02:22:44,975 --> 02:22:48,376
- What?
- I told you! Sahil wouldn't do that.

1136
02:22:49,679 --> 02:22:52,773
He is a victim of circumstances.
He is innocent.

1137
02:22:53,216 --> 02:22:56,617
Is Sahil really innocent?

1138
02:22:57,654 --> 02:22:59,019
Who is the real killer?

1139
02:23:00,290 --> 02:23:03,691
The hunt is on, Mr. Diwan.
We'll find him.

1140
02:23:07,430 --> 02:23:11,161
These are the Kashmiri daggers
used in the murders.

1141
02:23:13,403 --> 02:23:16,634
These daggers are part of a set.

1142
02:23:17,274 --> 02:23:20,971
Daggers like this are normally
sold in sets of sixes and sevens.

1143
02:23:21,478 --> 02:23:25,209
I must find out which set
these daggers belong to.

1144
02:23:25,549 --> 02:23:27,847
Can you tell me something
about them, Mr. Diwan?

1145
02:23:28,151 --> 02:23:30,847
Take a careful look. Go on...

1146
02:23:31,187 --> 02:23:34,918
Don't beat around the bush.
Come to the point.

1147
02:23:36,426 --> 02:23:40,055
How do I put it?
This is an old habit.

1148
02:23:40,463 --> 02:23:42,124
I have all the bad habits.

1149
02:23:42,599 --> 02:23:47,536
For instance, I got into your
house, without your permission.

1150
02:23:47,871 --> 02:23:50,840
I made tea for myself and
looked around the place.

1151
02:23:51,107 --> 02:23:52,699
You have a nice house.

1152
02:23:58,014 --> 02:24:02,713
But this particular picture has
landed me in a dilemma.

1153
02:24:03,219 --> 02:24:07,952
What can the picture of a
sinking ship in your house mean?

1154
02:24:09,993 --> 02:24:11,927
- Are you a pessimist?
- No.

1155
02:24:14,197 --> 02:24:18,634
Go and fetch me a packet
of cigarettes, Neelkanth.

1156
02:24:25,141 --> 02:24:29,100
You interpret the picture wrongly,
because you haven't looked carefully.

1157
02:24:29,412 --> 02:24:30,572
I'm an optimist.

1158
02:24:31,247 --> 02:24:36,344
Look closely. The ship is fighting
against the storm...

1159
02:24:36,686 --> 02:24:38,210
...and sailing towards the shore.

1160
02:24:38,622 --> 02:24:39,919
I don't think so.

1161
02:24:41,124 --> 02:24:43,786
Your ship is sinking,
Mr. Diwan!

1162
02:24:45,195 --> 02:24:48,790
In fact, it has already sunk!

1163
02:25:04,681 --> 02:25:07,149
Those daggers are
part of this set!

1164
02:25:07,651 --> 02:25:11,178
Your husband's killer is standing
before you, Mrs. Sinha!

1165
02:25:11,521 --> 02:25:15,218
What?! Ishwar?! You?

1166
02:25:15,625 --> 02:25:17,115
You killed my husband!

1167
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:19,187
Yes. I've killed him!

1168
02:25:19,696 --> 02:25:23,928
- But why?
- I was helpless!

1169
02:25:24,234 --> 02:25:27,397
The Governor refused to accept his
daughter as his son's bride.

1170
02:25:27,937 --> 02:25:29,632
Years of loyalty had been wasted!

1171
02:25:30,006 --> 02:25:32,770
He was not given the status he
sought! So he killed his master!

1172
02:25:35,478 --> 02:25:37,810
I was blinded in my love
for my daughter!

1173
02:25:38,214 --> 02:25:39,841
But why did you kill Dr Gandhi?

1174
02:25:40,383 --> 02:25:42,943
Dr Gandhi was going to
tell Sahil the truth!

1175
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:48,551
I got to his place before
Sahil could and killed him, too!

1176
02:25:49,025 --> 02:25:55,157
What had we thought you to be!
And what are you really?!

1177
02:26:01,271 --> 02:26:05,071
Beware! Do not try to stop me!

1178
02:26:06,409 --> 02:26:10,470
I'm an optimist! I've killed
twice! I can kill again!

1179
02:26:11,514 --> 02:26:13,744
Don't compel me to shoot you!
Leave the kid alone!

1180
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:16,648
Drop your gun! Go on!

1181
02:26:35,338 --> 02:26:38,068
Let me go!

1182
02:26:49,652 --> 02:26:52,177
Believe me, son! I have not
committed the murders!

1183
02:26:52,522 --> 02:26:54,854
Speak the truth! Or you will
go straight to hell!

1184
02:26:55,291 --> 02:26:57,657
The Minister is speaking
the truth, Sahil.

1185
02:26:58,862 --> 02:27:04,562
- Leave him alone.
- Yes. Leave me alone!

1186
02:27:05,602 --> 02:27:07,934
- The killer has been found.
- The real killer?!

1187
02:27:08,638 --> 02:27:10,003
How did it happen? And when?

1188
02:27:10,406 --> 02:27:14,206
You ought to thank Inspector Udham
Singh for finding the real killer.

1189
02:27:14,811 --> 02:27:18,076
You don't need to run away now.
You're a free man.

1190
02:27:18,848 --> 02:27:22,511
- But who is the real killer?
- It's not me! I swear!

1191
02:27:22,852 --> 02:27:23,716
I have not committed the murder!

1192
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:25,044
Who is it?

1193
02:27:26,089 --> 02:27:28,683
It wouldn't be right to
utter the name here.

1194
02:27:30,059 --> 02:27:32,687
We don't need to hide anything
from Isha. Speak up, Sheetal!

1195
02:27:33,329 --> 02:27:35,092
The truth will be a
terrible blow for her.

1196
02:27:36,866 --> 02:27:39,266
What is it, after all?

1197
02:27:39,669 --> 02:27:43,070
Tell me... who is the killer?

1198
02:27:46,242 --> 02:27:49,575
It's her father...
Ishwar Diwan.

1199
02:27:51,581 --> 02:27:52,639
What are you talking about?!

1200
02:27:56,619 --> 02:27:58,450
She's lying! The bitch!

1201
02:28:02,225 --> 02:28:03,692
Hasn't she shown her true colors?

1202
02:28:04,394 --> 02:28:05,383
The envious bitch!

1203
02:28:05,862 --> 02:28:08,854
But remember!
Sahil belongs only to me!

1204
02:28:09,799 --> 02:28:12,461
Udham Singh has arrested
your father with the proof!

1205
02:28:12,869 --> 02:28:14,393
He has even confessed
to his crime!

1206
02:28:14,838 --> 02:28:17,238
Go to the police station,
if you can't believe me!

1207
02:28:17,807 --> 02:28:19,240
Your father is now
in police custody.

1208
02:28:21,344 --> 02:28:24,780
No! This can't be true!

1209
02:28:27,116 --> 02:28:31,553
My father could never do this!
He couldn't ever kill someone!

1210
02:28:33,156 --> 02:28:37,286
This is a lie! A bloody lie!

1211
02:28:39,429 --> 02:28:41,260
Isha! Wait!

1212
02:28:43,766 --> 02:28:46,132
Please, Sahil... leave me
alone for the moment.

1213
02:28:47,136 --> 02:28:48,569
I love you very much...

1214
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:51,907
...and you belong only to me!

1215
02:29:01,784 --> 02:29:06,448
I can't understand why Diwan
would kill my dad.

1216
02:29:07,056 --> 02:29:10,048
Isha is looking for the answer
to the question, too.

1217
02:29:10,526 --> 02:29:12,653
Which is why she has
gone to meet her father.

1218
02:29:13,396 --> 02:29:17,526
Go home, Sahil.
Your mother is worried about you.

1219
02:29:18,835 --> 02:29:20,735
Why are you quiet, mother?
Say something.

1220
02:29:21,304 --> 02:29:24,933
You ought to be happy. The police
will now set Sahil free.

1221
02:29:25,275 --> 02:29:26,742
He will now live with us.

1222
02:29:34,350 --> 02:29:37,012
Mother... are you
still angry with me?

1223
02:29:37,854 --> 02:29:42,348
I'm angry with myself...
I have misunderstood you.

1224
02:29:43,393 --> 02:29:48,558
It was Ishwar who committed the
murder... and I accused you!

1225
02:29:49,999 --> 02:29:51,864
Please forgive me, my son!

1226
02:29:52,168 --> 02:29:53,362
Forget the past, mother.

1227
02:29:56,506 --> 02:29:58,098
Forgive me, son!

1228
02:30:00,443 --> 02:30:04,607
It's fun drinking after
the game is over, Neelkanth!

1229
02:30:05,381 --> 02:30:07,542
You're right! It's like
full value for money!

1230
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:09,808
The game is not over yet!

1231
02:30:13,790 --> 02:30:15,519
We still have a bottle left!

1232
02:30:22,098 --> 02:30:24,999
Come in, Sahil. There's
a strong wind outside.

1233
02:30:30,606 --> 02:30:33,006
You've had enough!
What are you up to, Pandu?

1234
02:30:33,176 --> 02:30:38,614
No! Like the boss, I will do
one thing at a time today!

1235
02:30:39,015 --> 02:30:41,142
I'm going to get drunk!

1236
02:30:52,462 --> 02:30:54,293
Brother! May I take this?

1237
02:30:55,765 --> 02:31:01,362
The locket is still a riddle.
Okay... go and play with it.

1238
02:31:06,009 --> 02:31:09,308
- The weather's very bad, okay?
- Yes. Terrible weather.

1239
02:31:09,979 --> 02:31:11,071
It's time you guys left.

1240
02:31:39,976 --> 02:31:42,968
- Will you be able to drive it?
- Sure.

1241
02:31:43,279 --> 02:31:44,576
You've had a lot to drink!

1242
02:32:04,534 --> 02:32:06,934
I've opened the locket, Sahil!

1243
02:32:07,503 --> 02:32:09,994
- Go ahead and play with it.
- Look what's inside it!

1244
02:32:10,473 --> 02:32:13,135
- Stop bothering me!
- Come and take a look.

1245
02:32:14,043 --> 02:32:15,567
All right. Here I come.

1246
02:32:19,582 --> 02:32:22,050
You need to give it a push.

1247
02:32:23,820 --> 02:32:26,482
Not there, idiot!
Come behind me!

1248
02:32:29,025 --> 02:32:30,583
Push the bike! Not me!

1249
02:33:47,336 --> 02:33:48,303
You?!

1250
02:34:15,865 --> 02:34:18,663
Pushing the bike is
not going to help.

1251
02:34:19,268 --> 02:34:22,101
Let the bike be there.
Let's spend the night here.

1252
02:34:23,105 --> 02:34:26,233
We're cops. We can't spend the
night on the pavements!

1253
02:34:26,676 --> 02:34:30,669
Let's sleep here, since the
bike is not starting up.

1254
02:34:31,113 --> 02:34:32,671
Let's have another drink, too!

1255
02:34:36,519 --> 02:34:41,320
Rush to the police station!
I'll summon an ambulance!

1256
02:34:51,801 --> 02:34:56,670
The locket?! Even the police
couldn't find the locket!

1257
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,568
Where did you find it?

1258
02:34:59,041 --> 02:35:00,338
You can't hide a murder.

1259
02:35:00,977 --> 02:35:02,103
That's my locket!

1260
02:35:02,778 --> 02:35:04,939
How much more will
you shield your daughter?

1261
02:35:06,182 --> 02:35:09,777
I will! Till as long as I live!
I'm her father!

1262
02:35:10,286 --> 02:35:13,653
Besides, there's nothing
wrong with my daughter.

1263
02:35:14,156 --> 02:35:17,421
She only has a nasty temper...
but she was like this as a kid.

1264
02:35:17,893 --> 02:35:21,056
She loses her temper, only
when someone scolds you.

1265
02:35:21,397 --> 02:35:24,264
D'you remember how Dr Gandhi's
dog had bitten you as a child?

1266
02:35:24,433 --> 02:35:28,062
It was found dead the next day.
Isha had killed it.

1267
02:35:29,272 --> 02:35:34,972
Yes! And Dr Gandhi said, since she
was not mentally balanced...

1268
02:35:35,378 --> 02:35:37,369
...she be sent away to
a boarding school.

1269
02:35:37,813 --> 02:35:40,646
They sent her away,
despite my protests.

1270
02:35:41,217 --> 02:35:43,242
Dr Gandhi had done
that deliberately.

1271
02:35:43,619 --> 02:35:45,314
He wanted to separate
the two of you.

1272
02:35:45,655 --> 02:35:48,283
Your father wanted that, too.
But destiny willed otherwise!

1273
02:35:49,258 --> 02:35:52,887
You met in the college and
your love blossomed.

1274
02:35:53,729 --> 02:35:58,962
And when you held her hand
before everyone at the party...

1275
02:35:59,302 --> 02:36:03,500
...her confidence received a boost.
She went mad with joy.

1276
02:36:04,173 --> 02:36:09,338
But Dr Gandhi and your father
rejected her the very next day.

1277
02:36:09,945 --> 02:36:11,003
What is your status anyway?

1278
02:36:11,514 --> 02:36:13,709
D'you want me to sacrifice
my son for your happiness?

1279
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:18,811
This idiot knows everything!
But he still wants me to...

1280
02:36:20,356 --> 02:36:26,192
Diwan! It's better to compromise,
when you can't find a solution.

1281
02:36:26,862 --> 02:36:34,997
I begged of your father
for my daughter's happiness.

1282
02:36:35,438 --> 02:36:38,965
I pleaded with him and fell at his
feet for my daughter's happiness!

1283
02:36:39,241 --> 02:36:40,003
But he wouldn't
listen to me!

1284
02:36:40,309 --> 02:36:41,799
I was humiliated
and thrown out.

1285
02:36:42,845 --> 02:36:45,109
She had gone berserk
with hatred and rage!

1286
02:36:46,048 --> 02:36:49,313
I won't spare him for this!
Who does he think he is?

1287
02:36:50,453 --> 02:36:54,150
Who the hell is he?
I'll kill him!

1288
02:36:55,124 --> 02:36:58,150
I'll kill him!
Let me go, Dad!

1289
02:36:58,761 --> 02:37:00,729
- No, my child... Don't!
- Leave me alone!

1290
02:37:02,631 --> 02:37:10,436
Why?! Tell me why don't
you leave us alone?

1291
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:14,676
Why do they want to
separate me from Sahil?

1292
02:37:15,511 --> 02:37:19,379
Tell me... why must
I let them live?

1293
02:37:20,583 --> 02:37:23,643
I had panicked to see my
daughter shattered like this.

1294
02:37:24,153 --> 02:37:26,815
The shock of being separated
from you was killing her!

1295
02:37:29,091 --> 02:37:31,286
I thought she would somehow
bear the shock.

1296
02:37:32,194 --> 02:37:34,924
But she killed your father
in a fit of rage.

1297
02:37:40,603 --> 02:37:42,798
She did all this for
your sake, son.

1298
02:37:43,806 --> 02:37:45,933
She wanted you for herself.

1299
02:37:46,342 --> 02:37:48,572
But you came to be accused
for the murder.

1300
02:37:49,044 --> 02:37:50,944
And she had lost you again.

1301
02:37:51,781 --> 02:37:55,376
Her world was shattered and she
decided to speak the truth.

1302
02:37:55,785 --> 02:37:59,744
Don't stop me! I will surrender to
the police and save Sahil's life.

1303
02:38:00,122 --> 02:38:03,353
Sahil will never marry you, once
he gets to know the truth!

1304
02:38:04,393 --> 02:38:05,621
Then what am I to do?

1305
02:38:06,462 --> 02:38:08,726
Why did you do all this,
to begin with?!

1306
02:38:09,732 --> 02:38:11,359
I don't know the reason.

1307
02:38:11,834 --> 02:38:15,099
They separated me from Sahil
in childhood.

1308
02:38:15,538 --> 02:38:17,836
And when Sahil was accepting me
at the party...

1309
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:21,801
...the Governor landed a slap
on the face of our love!

1310
02:38:22,344 --> 02:38:25,780
It was Sahil who held
the dagger then...

1311
02:38:26,215 --> 02:38:29,116
- Had only I held the dagger...
- No, dear!

1312
02:38:29,685 --> 02:38:35,089
Be patient! For God's sake!
I'll find a way out.

1313
02:38:35,858 --> 02:38:38,418
And when you met her
after escaping from jail...

1314
02:38:38,894 --> 02:38:42,853
...she did not want
to lose you at any cost.

1315
02:38:43,299 --> 02:38:45,824
But Dr Gandhi had started
suspecting Isha.

1316
02:38:46,268 --> 02:38:49,066
And since he was going to
reveal the truth to you...

1317
02:38:49,405 --> 02:38:51,100
...lsha killed him, too.

1318
02:39:10,159 --> 02:39:13,754
What have you done?
Another murder to hide one?

1319
02:39:14,296 --> 02:39:16,924
I can kill a hundred men
for Sahil.

1320
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:21,633
I will kill anyone who
dares to come between us!

1321
02:39:21,904 --> 02:39:23,098
Come to your senses!

1322
02:39:23,672 --> 02:39:26,232
Before the police arrive,
you must escape!

1323
02:39:26,709 --> 02:39:28,870
You must take Sahil and go away
to some faraway place!

1324
02:39:29,078 --> 02:39:34,607
I made the mistake of being silent,
although I knew everything.

1325
02:39:35,084 --> 02:39:36,574
I kept it all a secret.

1326
02:39:37,052 --> 02:39:41,648
Because Isha is my only child...
and I love her very much.

1327
02:39:42,525 --> 02:39:48,054
I'm willing to atone for
the sins Isha has committed.

1328
02:39:49,732 --> 02:39:51,757
Let me serve a sentence
instead of her.

1329
02:39:52,167 --> 02:39:54,829
This has been a secret...
and please keep it a secret.

1330
02:39:55,504 --> 02:39:58,996
You can't use blood to adorn
your daughter's forehead.

1331
02:40:03,646 --> 02:40:06,240
You're locked in here!
And I thought you'd fled!

1332
02:40:06,715 --> 02:40:07,704
What happened?

1333
02:40:08,117 --> 02:40:11,609
Another half-murder! Someone
has stabbed Udham Singh!

1334
02:40:12,488 --> 02:40:15,048
The killer is here.
Who could have stabbed him?

1335
02:40:15,491 --> 02:40:20,190
Go, Sahil! Go and stop Isha!
Go on!

1336
02:40:28,571 --> 02:40:31,369
What makes you call me?

1337
02:40:31,707 --> 02:40:32,867
Who else is at home right now?

1338
02:40:33,642 --> 02:40:36,907
My parents are out.
I'm all alone.

1339
02:40:37,313 --> 02:40:41,306
I can't see the servants around.
But why did you ask?

1340
02:40:42,518 --> 02:40:45,487
- What happened, Sheetal?
- There's a power-failure.

1341
02:40:46,689 --> 02:40:49,055
- It's very dark out here.
- There's going to be a storm.

1342
02:40:49,391 --> 02:40:52,451
Shut the doors and windows
and don't let anyone inside.

1343
02:40:54,363 --> 02:40:55,523
I'll be there soon.

1344
02:41:10,379 --> 02:41:14,110
Isha! You gave me a scare!

1345
02:41:14,583 --> 02:41:16,448
- Were you talking to Sahil?
- Yes.

1346
02:41:17,219 --> 02:41:20,552
- What brings you here?
- I've come to apologize, Sheetal.

1347
02:41:21,190 --> 02:41:24,887
I spoke a lot of nonsense
to you this morning.

1348
02:41:25,494 --> 02:41:31,490
I misbehaved with you. I wonder
what had gotten into me.

1349
02:41:32,234 --> 02:41:33,394
Please forgive me.

1350
02:41:34,203 --> 02:41:41,371
Why apologize? In your shoes,
perhaps I'd have done the same.

1351
02:41:41,710 --> 02:41:46,477
No, you wouldn't.
I'm one of a kind.

1352
02:41:47,049 --> 02:41:49,540
Well then... have
you forgiven me?

1353
02:41:50,285 --> 02:41:53,254
Okay, I have. Is that enough?

1354
02:41:53,622 --> 02:41:54,987
Wait till I shut the door.

1355
02:41:56,759 --> 02:42:01,526
You need not worry.
I've already shut the door.

1356
02:42:02,064 --> 02:42:03,622
Nobody can get in.

1357
02:42:05,801 --> 02:42:09,168
I've never seen such a storm.
Someone's going to land in trouble.

1358
02:42:11,674 --> 02:42:17,442
You love Sahil very much,
don't you?

1359
02:42:17,813 --> 02:42:18,973
Let's not talk about it.

1360
02:42:22,751 --> 02:42:28,587
Tell me... to what lengths can you
go for Sahil's sake?

1361
02:42:29,058 --> 02:42:32,858
I don't understand.

1362
02:42:33,162 --> 02:42:37,223
I want to see what limits
your friendship extends to.

1363
02:42:37,499 --> 02:42:39,057
Please! Let's not
talk about this.

1364
02:42:40,235 --> 02:42:46,504
I want to know what
you can do for Sahil.

1365
02:42:47,843 --> 02:42:49,572
I can lay down my life for him.

1366
02:42:52,815 --> 02:42:55,477
There lies the difference
between you and me.

1367
02:42:56,752 --> 02:42:58,982
I can lay down my life
for Sahil, too.

1368
02:43:00,089 --> 02:43:02,489
But only to have him
for myself.

1369
02:43:03,192 --> 02:43:06,958
I can even kill those
who come between us!

1370
02:43:25,247 --> 02:43:29,377
If there is anyone between
Sahil and me, it's only you.

1371
02:43:29,818 --> 02:43:30,785
What madness is this?

1372
02:46:57,592 --> 02:46:59,492
What are you up to, mister?
You can't leave!

1373
02:47:01,830 --> 02:47:04,230
What are you doing, sir?
You can't do this!

1374
02:47:29,624 --> 02:47:33,720
You're hurt, Sahil!
What happened?

1375
02:47:36,031 --> 02:47:38,829
Where is Sheetal?
Where is she?

1376
02:47:39,968 --> 02:47:42,163
Save me, Sahil!

1377
02:47:43,171 --> 02:47:49,132
She's scared without reason.
Ask her to come out.

1378
02:47:50,045 --> 02:47:51,774
Don't let her mislead you, Sahil!
She has gone mad!

1379
02:47:52,614 --> 02:47:54,343
She has a dagger!
She wants to kill me!

1380
02:47:56,018 --> 02:47:58,077
A dagger? Where is it?

1381
02:48:00,555 --> 02:48:01,487
Come out, Sheetal.

1382
02:48:02,391 --> 02:48:04,586
You don't understand, Sahil!
She's gone mad!

1383
02:48:05,761 --> 02:48:09,390
Should you have faith in me...
come out, Sheetal.

1384
02:48:37,025 --> 02:48:39,687
Save me, Sahil! Don't ever be
separated from me!

1385
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:03,049
Isha! Drop the dagger!

1386
02:49:03,952 --> 02:49:09,322
No, Sahil! Leave me alone!
Let me pierce it through her heart!

1387
02:49:09,925 --> 02:49:11,984
Let me go!
Just this once, Sahil!

1388
02:49:12,294 --> 02:49:13,261
Don't be crazy, Isha!

1389
02:49:13,595 --> 02:49:17,429
Let me go... just this once!

1390
02:49:54,302 --> 02:49:56,202
Why did you do all this, Isha?

1391
02:49:59,908 --> 02:50:01,500
It was for you, Sahil...

1392
02:50:02,677 --> 02:50:04,508
It was only to have you!

1393
02:50:05,413 --> 02:50:07,176
But please don't hate me!

1394
02:50:08,483 --> 02:50:11,850
We've loved each other since
we were kids, haven't we?

1395
02:50:12,254 --> 02:50:15,155
I've always belonged to you, Isha!
Only to you.

1396
02:50:16,892 --> 02:50:21,955
I couldn't trust my fate...

1397
02:50:25,534 --> 02:50:30,233
Hold me close to your bosom, Sahil!
Embrace me!

1398
02:50:53,662 --> 02:50:56,961
Lord Shiva! You alone
are you my savior!

1399
02:50:57,332 --> 02:50:58,799
Hail Lord Shiva!

1400
02:51:01,937 --> 02:51:04,701
Relax, Minister... nothing
will happen to you.

1401
02:51:05,507 --> 02:51:10,740
I have a couplet for the
bad condition you are in.

1402
02:51:11,213 --> 02:51:20,781
"Why will a minister die, when the
whole hospital looks after him?"

1403
02:51:22,290 --> 02:51:25,589
The poet in bandages! They got
beaten up for nothing!

1404
02:51:26,027 --> 02:51:28,052
The real killer turned out
to be someone else!

1405
02:51:29,264 --> 02:51:33,633
Friends! Lead a comfortable
life in the hospital!

1406
02:51:34,002 --> 02:51:35,993
Don't get into such
a mess again.

1407
02:51:36,338 --> 02:51:40,104
Or we meet again; after the
thrashing you receive!
