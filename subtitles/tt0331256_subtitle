1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,930
You're going to die a dog's death!
God is not going to forgive you!

3
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,100
The curse of a prostitute
will kill you!

4
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,032
This is war against prostitutes
in a month's time

5
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,369
And our cops are fast asleep,
- Not asleep

6
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,455
They're hand-in-glove
with the criminals

7
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,042
''lf they wish, they can clean
the system in a minute''

8
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:34,255
Who knows which prostitute is going
to have her face disfigured next

9
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,123
''How much more
will you make me wait?''

10
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,627
''Take this for a night of reckoning
and come over''

11
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,799
''lf the lamp is extinguished,
you might regret it''

12
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,635
Patience, you whore''

13
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,639
The fruit of patience
is always sweet

14
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,601
''lf you're so restless,
take off your clothes''

15
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,647
My officer does not have the time

16
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,989
She sounds like one of those
poetic sorts... watch your step

17
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:21,071
''What trip is that, baby...?
Why haven't you stripped?''

18
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,952
You charge money for creating
the ambience with poetry?

19
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,291
Take off your clothes,
Get to work

20
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,467
Strip, baby, Strip''

21
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,474
''lf l strip, you're going
to regret it''

22
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:57,691
You could lose your
police uniform forever

23
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,194
Who are you?

24
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,537
''What is the matter,
A, C, P, Digvijay Pandey?''

25
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,500
Won't you disfigure my face
like the other whores?

26
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:22,257
What has stopped you...?
My face? Or is it my gun?

27
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,559
l wonder how the cops could have
someone mad like you on the force!

28
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,562
Are you out of your mind?
Are you crazy?

29
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,566
You're in the wrong business,
You ought to be in the movies....

30
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:44,279
not the police force, l conduct a
raid here and you hold a gun to me?

31
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,449
To your senior...?

32
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,036
Put that away

33
00:06:55,832 --> 00:07:00,795
''That act won't work on me, A, C, P,
You're sick''

34
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,466
''You ought to be in a loonybin,
not the police force''

35
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:11,222
Now let's stop this hide-n-seek
because you've been caught red handed

36
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:22,525
Even if l believe for a moment that
this is all A, C, P, Pandey's doing...

37
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,945
l still can't take
any action against him

38
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,534
Because you conducted the operation
outside your jurisdiction

39
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,290
''lt's the police's duty to
prevent crime, wherever it occurs''

40
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,337
You needn't lecture me on the
functioning of the police department

41
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,047
Sir, l thought...''

42
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:12,075
l don't know what the truth is,
But l know Prabha wasn't lying

43
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:22,877
''lf you think she wasn't lying,
she ought to prove it, sir''

44
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,757
What else can l say to you?

45
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,459
My lotus from the police force
appears to be angry with me today

46
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,050
''lt isn't you, Uncle,
l'm angry at myself

47
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,893
Stay in the sunshine and
you're bound to get a tan

48
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,273
You join the police force and
look for peace in your job...?

49
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:30,612
''lt hurts, Uncle,
You gave me such a great tip off...''

50
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,283
''but what happened? Despite catching
him red-handed, nothing came of it''

51
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,331
l can now understand why a capable
constable like you...

52
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,626
quit the force after putting in
18 years of service

53
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,295
You must've been very hurt

54
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,633
The reason behind my quitting
the police force is a street...

55
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,639
''on which l've put
a ''no-entry'' board''

56
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:03,019
''But what should l be doing, Uncle?
l sometimes feel...''

57
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,897
that if we are to really
protect society...

58
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,109
we must first protect it
from its own saviours

59
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,364
l quit the police force to
overcome my helplessness...

60
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,741
and harassment by my seniors

61
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,332
''Now look, Prabha,
You can either change the world...''

62
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:31,673
or live with its rotten
and antiquated rules

63
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,681
A police uniform is something
everyone can wear

64
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,520
But not everyone is a police officer

65
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,525
''To play the saviour,
you have so much at stake''

66
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:56,823
''Your love, your home,
your family...''

67
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,827
and your life too

68
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,249
And not everyone is prepared
to do that

69
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:14,299
There is no one l can call my own,
As for my life...

70
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:21,056
it's always at stake, l'm not going
to let the system scare me

71
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,560
l'm going to change it

72
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,168
Madam, this is Constable Vijay''

73
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,089
Doctor Mahesh Mirchandani was
murdered this morning at his bungalow

74
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,676
''Please come soon,
- All right, l'm coming over''

75
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,989
When did it happen?
- Between 3 and 5 this morning

76
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,367
''When the cleaner came for the
car-keys at 6 a, m.....''

77
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,329
this is the state he found him in,
- Any clues?

78
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,292
That...

79
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,628
''The best place on earth,
Your lndia''

80
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,636
Every joy is yours

81
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,389
Every sorrow is mine

82
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,727
''Madam, this syringe,
- Where did you find it?''

83
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,021
Beside the body

84
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:39,361
Send it to the lab, l want a report
on this with the post-mortem report

85
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,710
''Madam, who could the killer be?
- Get these flowers''

86
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,254
l want to see the cleaner

87
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,597
That'll tell us about the killer,
- The bulb?

88
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,850
lt's not a bulb,
- So what is it?

89
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,395
lt's called a surveillance camera

90
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,192
Let's see

91
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,819
Where will we find him?
- Come here

92
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,159
This is where you'll find him,
Mariam Florist

93
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,404
Does this man stay here?
- Yes, Upstairs, Room No 111

94
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,990
This way?
- That's right

95
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,312
Get the jeep ready!

96
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,793
l can't understand how
Aditya got caught

97
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,966
l think we'll have to move
elsewhere for some days

98
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,429
''What for, Parshuram?
So many of our men were caught...''

99
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:11,099
''but none of them opened their mouth,
despite being tortured by the police''

100
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,603
Our silence and our oath of celibacy
are our strongest weapons

101
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,858
Aditya is your right hand man,
That girl can't make him squeal

102
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:30,243
''No, Banjara, She's an honest woman,
And when the enemy is honest...''

103
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,496
you've got to be extra careful

104
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,667
You never know what
she might strike with

105
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,463
l'll have to meet Prabha Narayan

106
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,257
lt's a victory for
the entire department

107
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,927
Congratulations to you too

108
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,014
Pandey, what are you doing here?''

109
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:58,438
Prabha was amazing! She caught
Dr Mirchandani's killer in 12 hours

110
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,490
What is the matter, Mr Pandey?''

111
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,951
You don't seem to be happy
at Prabha's victory

112
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,623
''Mirchandani was
a friend of mine, sir''

113
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:25,632
Why do you think someone could have
killed a kind soul like Mirchandani?

114
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:34,683
''Sir, l can answer that question
in just 10 minutes''

115
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:39,020
Please entrust this case to me...
it's a request

116
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:46,695
lf l don't make him squeal
like a parrot...

117
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,072
you can treat me like a dog

118
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,660
This is exactly why l'm not
entrusting the case to you

119
00:24:55,286 --> 00:25:00,291
''Remember, Pandey, l can't let any of
my officers use their position...''

120
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:05,547
to settle their personal scores,
Prabha's the one who'll handle this case

121
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,844
''She's a woman, sir,
What can she do?''

122
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,348
She got her hands on
the guy by fluke...

123
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,393
and the whole department
makes a heroine out of her

124
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,604
l don't know what your problem is

125
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:26,776
''lf you have a drinking problem,
get yourself treated, Pandey''

126
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:31,948
''lf you can't even do that,
please do me a favour''

127
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:38,246
''Till you sober down, just don't
wear this uniform, Okay? Go now''

128
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,835
''l don't drink, sir...
l gave it up three years ago''

129
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,421
l don't drink

130
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,675
''But you've giving that case to me, sir
- Go away''

131
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:59,684
The police accuses you
of homicide

132
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:04,481
At about 4 a, m, on February 12...

133
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,985
you are said to have slit the throat
of social-worker Mirchandani...

134
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:15,992
''thereby mercilessly killing him, for
which you will be tried in this court''

135
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,953
Do you confess to the crime?

136
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,627
Do you confess to the crime?

137
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,094
Answer me

138
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,097
Do you confess to the crime?

139
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:54,656
Pictures recorded on Dr Mirchandani's
surveillance camera amply prove...

140
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,659
that he's the one who
committed the murder

141
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,496
''ln the last 24 hours,
this man has not uttered a word''

142
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:06,876
Such behaviour is expected only from
a seasoned criminal or a terrorist

143
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:11,256
He has used his silence to withhold
the names of his accomplices...

144
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:16,177
and his own motives,
During his arrest...

145
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,515
he even launched a murderous attack
on senior lnspector Prabha Narayan

146
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:27,188
l request the court to accept the
police request for a 14 day remand...

147
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,608
so that they can get to
the bottom of this affair...

148
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,528
only after they make him talk

149
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,823
''You are not our enemy,
Your system is''

150
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,493
''Since you are a nice person
in the system...''

151
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,996
''you are only being given a warning,
Give up this case...''

152
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:29,584
''or else, you will be burnt down
along with your police station''

153
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,121
God has given you a nice face

154
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:11,543
You ought to have become a film star,
Why did you commit a murder?

155
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:18,550
Hey handsome... you're the one
l'm talking to

156
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,220
''You were being quite a smartass
in court, weren't you?''

157
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,431
''You couldn't bring yourself
about to speak, could you?''

158
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,308
You think you're very smart?

159
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,898
''You've heard of me, haven't you?
The name is Prabha Narayan''

160
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:40,196
The worst of criminals wet their pants
when they hear my name

161
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:45,326
Tell me your name... Go on

162
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,621
You think you're a big shot?

163
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:58,131
So what do l call you...?
A bastard? Or a sonofabitch?

164
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,302
Tell me your name, Quick

165
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,139
lf l get to work on you...

166
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:11,686
you'll forget the names of
your father and your forefathers

167
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,564
So tell me your name

168
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,399
You won't?

169
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,739
Gawde... are you guys all dead?

170
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,162
Let me see why you won't speak

171
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,667
You're forcing me to do something
l've been avoiding

172
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:38,046
''Gawde, get started,
He won't speak''

173
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:45,053
Think it over, This guy Gawde
carries a mean punch

174
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,932
Are you talking?

175
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,435
So you are not talking?

176
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:10,954
You act saintly and
give us murderous looks?

177
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:17,752
What's your trip?
Who are you?

178
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,549
You're not telling?

179
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,404
You won't talk?

180
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,433
Stop him!

181
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,209
He's a very dangerous man, Prabha''

182
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:42,671
Know why?

183
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,801
Because he isn't scared of
losing anything

184
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:52,681
Even if the whole of your police
department were to torture him...

185
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:57,519
they couldn't still make him
open his mouth

186
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:01,064
lt isn't about that, Uncle''

187
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,693
l know what is it about

188
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:10,990
lf you don't make him talk in the rest
of the 12 days of his remand...

189
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,619
this case will be entrusted
to Digvijay Pandey

190
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,331
And you won't be able to
bear the humiliation

191
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:25,797
''Prabha, man can somehow come
to terms with his own sorrow''

192
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:32,971
But it shatters him to see his
enemy rejoice, lsn't it?

193
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:40,729
Digvijay Pandey will have a
celebration at your failure

194
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:48,361
''The truth is that, despite
the best of my efforts...''

195
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:52,991
l can't stomach the fact that it was
the enemy who saved my life

196
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,331
The world thinks that l'm the one
who arrested him

197
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:06,838
''Whereas the truth is, he embraced
death to save my life''

198
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:13,887
Who is he? Why did he do that?
l want to find out

199
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,779
Love, you can't stop''

200
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:38,661
lt's a fire you can't start...

201
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,790
a fire you can't put out

202
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:46,002
You're drunk,
You're talking rubbish

203
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,672
l don't even know who he is

204
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:57,847
''That's what your brains say, Prabha,
And the values you have imbibed''

205
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,311
Your values compel you
to give death...

206
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,647
''to the one who gave
you life, isn't it?''

207
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,609
They want to send him
to the gallows

208
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,406
And your heart just won't
agree with that

209
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,748
''That's what you are
worried about, isnt it?''

210
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:32,799
Your heart is in conflict with your
mind and seeks something else

211
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:40,181
This body of yours...
it heeds your heart

212
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:48,648
There's another thing you must remember,
All is fair in love and war

213
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:55,864
There's another way of finishing
your enemy... befriend him

214
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:59,534
Give him all your love

215
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:05,498
Only your love can open
the seal on his mouth

216
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:53,672
What madness is this?

217
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,803
What is it that stirs my heart?

218
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:08,269
''What madness is this?
What is it that stirs my heart?''

219
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:14,067
''l wish time would freeze
in our love''

220
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,028
My love...

221
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,656
my love

222
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,874
What madness is this?

223
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,877
What is it that stirs my heart?

224
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:38,341
''l wish time would freeze
in our love''

225
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:42,012
My love...

226
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,556
my love

227
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:28,516
''l'm surrounded by a storm...
how will l find the shores?''

228
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:34,189
''Till my madness comes to my rescue,
my heart shall remain on fire''

229
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:38,193
Love is so difficult...

230
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:46,868
''Love is so difficult,
love is life...''

231
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:52,624
''l wish time would freeze
in our love''

232
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:57,629
My love, my love''

233
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:04,260
My love, my love''

234
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,984
''l know what pain
my heart holds''

235
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:06,656
''We're all mad at heart...
we just won't relent''

236
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:10,660
Hearts in love...

237
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:19,294
''Hearts in love,
lost in the haze...''

238
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:25,342
''how l wish time would freeze
in our love''

239
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:29,763
My love, my love''

240
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:36,686
My love, my love''

241
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:43,360
lt's 2 a, m,
Aren't you going home?

242
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,061
Your life's in danger, Prabha''

243
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,106
Who's this?

244
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,526
You forget your enemy's voice?

245
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:27,737
You?

246
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,366
l'm worried about you,
Guess why

247
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:37,497
l've been told by an informer that
if l wish to save your life...

248
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:42,460
l must get to your house
right now

249
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:50,510
That chap in the murder case...
his group plans to bump you off tonight

250
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:55,557
l swear it on you... l'm willing
to spend the night with you

251
00:41:56,307 --> 00:42:00,145
Let me see who touches you...
except me

252
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,192
l got to know that
the boy isn't talking

253
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:12,282
We'll get him to tell us which group
or gang he belongs to

254
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,202
''His remand gets over
in 48 hours, you see''

255
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,623
''lf he still doesn't sing,
we'll kill him in an encounter''

256
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,795
''Do l come over then?
- No, sir''

257
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:31,259
''Why must you take all the trouble
at this hour, for my sake?''

258
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:39,100
Do me a favour, Tell your informer
to spread the word...

259
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:47,692
that l'm keeping the doors
of my house open tonight

260
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:53,365
''Anyone can come over and
bump me off, if he has the guts''

261
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:58,787
''As for that boy,
l've made up my mind''

262
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:04,250
''Without as much as raising a finger,
l'll get him to tell me the truth''

263
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,094
What did she say?

264
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:23,812
She's going to take a beating...
from me

265
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:28,400
l'm beginning to get worried Prabha

266
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,653
May l know what progress
you have made?

267
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:40,286
What l must say is that
this man is an enigma

268
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:44,666
Remember the graffiti he scribbled
on Dr Mirchandani's walls?

269
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,838
''The best place on earth,
your lndia''

270
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:54,843
''Every joy is for you,
All sorrows are for us''

271
00:43:56,553 --> 00:44:01,516
The graffiti clearly indicate how
angry he is with us and our system

272
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:08,356
''Whom and why he's angry with,
it's necessary to find out''

273
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,391
l'm taking you out somewhere

274
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:52,484
A place whose silence
even you will find unbearable

275
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:01,951
Cover his face

276
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,567
l've brought you to your own house

277
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:50,333
''The fires outside you can always
put out, firefighter Aditya Kashyap''

278
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:56,006
But how will you put out the fire
that rages in your heart?

279
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,301
By committing another murder?

280
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:09,894
What happened here?
What happened in this house...

281
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:15,275
to turn a life-saver like you
into a killer?

282
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:20,196
lt's not just my life,
You have saved many lives...

283
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,782
while you risked your own

284
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:29,622
You got these scars when
you saved 16 children...

285
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:35,253
''in a school on fire, isn't it?
You have committed a murder...''

286
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:41,551
but you are not a killer!
You can't even kill properly!

287
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:48,016
''Before killing the doctor, you
administered anesthesia to him''

288
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,187
''You can't see anyone
suffering, can you?''

289
00:46:52,854 --> 00:46:55,065
You must've wept so much
after killing him

290
00:46:56,775 --> 00:47:00,487
''Now look, Aditya, This is the
last house in the lane''

291
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:04,491
Your game of hide-n-seek is over

292
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:09,788
Now tell me clearly why
you committed this murder

293
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:20,548
Whose blood is that
on the walls?

294
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:24,969
Who was it whose death
killed the human being in you?

295
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:30,892
What happened here that turned
a saviour into a killer?

296
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:38,233
''Now look, Aditya, The trauma and
pain a man goes through...''

297
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:44,739
''after his first killing,
l very well understand''

298
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,540
A killing has taken place
at the hands of a saviour

299
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,586
Do you want to know my story?

300
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:03,466
You're afraid to tell me
about yourself

301
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:08,179
Maybe you will tell me of your pain
after you get to hear my story

302
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:17,188
l'm a whore's daughter,
l don't know who my father is

303
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:23,069
My childhood was a journey
through hell

304
00:48:31,786 --> 00:48:36,416
''My child, go out, l want to discuss
something with the lnspector''

305
00:48:48,553 --> 00:48:52,015
God Almighty!
What anger!

306
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:59,731
''Shalini, your daughter
is ready for it''

307
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:04,444
''Dilawar, sit inside,
Go on child... go outside and study''

308
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:12,077
''No, you take her bag
and go out today''

309
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:17,832
l want to talk to her in privacy,
- Don't get closer to my daughter!

310
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,711
l'm willing to pay you
four times the money

311
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,924
Don't you touch my daughter!
- You hold a policeman's collar?

312
00:49:26,424 --> 00:49:29,719
''Don't touch my daughter, l say!
- Whore!''

313
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:38,937
Take that... and that!

314
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:57,622
You grab a policeman's collar?
You whore!

315
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:28,153
That rotten police officer's blood
haunts me in my dreams even today

316
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:37,704
lt will continue to haunt me till
l reform a killer like myself

317
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:46,212
No sin in the world is beyond pardon

318
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:53,386
Neither is a sin so insignificant
that it can be ignored

319
00:50:57,307 --> 00:51:03,146
l had made up my mind in
the remand home itself...

320
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:09,611
''that as part of this society,
l would change the system''

321
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:14,657
l haven't become a police officer
just for the heck of it

322
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,414
''l will fight this battle,
till l die...''

323
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:25,085
so that l can integrate people
like you into the mainstream

324
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,675
Only by restoring your pride
and honour to you...

325
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:34,010
will l find my peace

326
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:39,307
But l won't be able to achieve
all that without your help

327
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:46,731
''l need your help, Aditya,
l need your help''

328
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:51,695
''Please help me, Aditya...
please help me''

329
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:13,360
''l gave away my heart to you
without even asking who are you''

330
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:23,370
''This is a decision
of the heart...''

331
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:30,752
''this is what my heart decides
without even asking who you are''

332
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:38,968
''l gave away my heart to you
without even asking who are you''

333
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:28,977
''My heart won't heed me...
who has ever controlled his heart?''

334
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,357
''l'm being drawn to you...
what strings pull me?''

335
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:46,244
''Something's gotten into you...
you are taking deep breaths''

336
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:52,000
''You are mad and you're
talking like a madman''

337
00:54:55,253 --> 00:55:00,342
''Maybe l'm mad...
tell me who you are''

338
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:09,100
''l gave away my heart to you
without even asking who are you''

339
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:19,027
''This is a decision
of the heart...''

340
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:26,618
''this is what my heart decides
without even asking who you are''

341
00:55:55,355 --> 00:56:00,276
''ln you, l have faith,
What trust is this?''

342
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:05,824
''Why's my heart so helpless?
What love is this?''

343
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:17,168
''l'm not restless without reason,
Not without reason do l pine...''

344
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:23,258
''l'm the one you always
dreamt of, believe me''

345
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:25,010
My eyes...

346
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:31,766
''my eyes look into yours
and l know who you are''

347
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:40,358
''l gave my heart away to you
without even asking who you are''

348
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:51,453
''This is a decision
of the heart...''

349
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:57,667
''this is what my heart decides
without even asking who you are''

350
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:25,862
lf l have caused you any pain
by telling you about my agony...

351
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:36,706
You're the first man l have
told my dirty past out

352
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:43,963
Maybe l find echoes of my past
in your silence

353
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:51,554
''When l told you about my past,
for the first time l realised...''

354
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:56,101
how a burden is relieved
when you share it with someone

355
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:01,022
You can have that peace
and that relief too...

356
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:05,652
if you could tell me
about your past

357
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:15,662
l say this not as a police officer,
l talk to you as a friend

358
00:58:17,872 --> 00:58:20,041
l want to hear your voice

359
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:27,882
l can't stand your silence anymore,
Say something!

360
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:35,932
''Why don't you understand? This silence,
which you think is your strength...''

361
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:38,601
is taking you towards your death!

362
00:58:42,939 --> 00:58:45,942
Please try to understand
what l'm saying

363
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:57,746
Your information is correct?
- Yes, He's Satyakam's son

364
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:04,919
''Get yourself on the case,
lf he tells Prabha, we're finished''

365
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:07,088
l've worked out a ploy, Wait

366
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,091
ls the boss up?
- He's expecting you for breakfast

367
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:18,683
What are you getting at?
- Something you don't care to hear

368
00:59:20,852 --> 00:59:24,022
You didn't put me on Mirchandani's case
because you think that as his friend...

369
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:32,947
''l might get emotional, l might subvert
the law, l might take personal cause''

370
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:37,077
So you put your protege on the case
and what has she delivered?

371
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:42,707
She has turned the police station
into a brothel

372
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:48,755
Yesterday... excuse us...

373
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:56,137
yesterday she was dressed to kill
when she took the accused to his house

374
00:59:57,263 --> 01:00:02,268
''Under pretext of investigations, for
2 hours they stayed behind closed doors''

375
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:06,773
''l didn't make it up,
l found out from the police station''

376
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:12,278
How much it has affected
our morale...

377
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:20,870
''how can l say it in as many words?
- Digvijay, in her techniques...''

378
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:27,794
Prabha has bettered you, She took him
out with my permission

379
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:34,217
This will end in a mess

380
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:38,471
l beg of you! For God's sake
let me handle this case

381
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:43,018
''Else, this whore's romance
will cost us dearly''

382
01:00:45,603 --> 01:00:47,522
A whore's daughter... isn't she?

383
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:02,746
Now...?

384
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:09,252
''When you can't do straight,
you get crooked''

385
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:19,179
When the foe starts behaving
like a friend...

386
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,434
something's wrong

387
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:29,230
We just want to tell you
that your ace goon...

388
01:01:29,689 --> 01:01:34,194
who is also precious
for Prabha Narayan...

389
01:01:34,986 --> 01:01:40,158
will be produced in court
secreted from the public eye

390
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:42,243
She's using Azad Road

391
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:44,829
Are you doubting me?

392
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:53,338
Why is a police informer
passing news to me?

393
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:58,343
Why this sudden affection for
a revolutionary? What's the ploy?

394
01:01:59,135 --> 01:02:04,140
''What you do for the revolution,
we do for the money''

395
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:11,773
Give him money

396
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,784
Here's more,
Now get out

397
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:26,162
l think it's a police plot

398
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:37,799
Plot or ploy, risk we must take''

399
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:44,639
''Not risking it, will be more dangerous,
- You mean...?''

400
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:55,316
Meaning? Whatever was spoken
about Aditya and Prabha...

401
01:02:56,401 --> 01:03:00,655
doesn't pierce your heart?
Doesn't it make you angry?

402
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:09,414
This is what l feared

403
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,754
She has seduced Aditya

404
01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:18,757
Now...

405
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:25,096
if we don't free Aditya
from her clutches...

406
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:33,146
this will be the first case of
violation in our organisation

407
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:44,282
Which we shall never allow

408
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:39,462
l reasoned with you...

409
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:41,548
l spoke to you like a gentleman

410
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:46,803
''lf you won't give in,
here's a shootout''

411
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,810
Aditya, come out''

412
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:01,526
Aditya, come out''

413
01:05:03,778 --> 01:05:04,821
Come out

414
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:07,949
Get him

415
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:14,164
No

416
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:58,124
''Wonder why l didn't shoot? Because,
once he saved my life, Score settled''

417
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:09,010
But how did Parshuram find out
which road we're using? Find out

418
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:17,686
Our crooked plot worked

419
01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:20,939
Parshuram freed him

420
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:23,066
Right there on Azad Road

421
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:32,325
''Don't celebrate prematurely,
or you'll invite the evil eye''

422
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:39,082
''He's free,
but we still got to kill him''

423
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:45,714
Now the case will come to me,
And l will kill him...

424
01:06:46,047 --> 01:06:49,509
in an encounter

425
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:04,607
Encounter

426
01:07:09,779 --> 01:07:11,406
Got screwed?

427
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:25,045
l told you, right here...''

428
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:29,090
''this is a mistake,
let me handle this case''

429
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:32,719
l got nothing against her,
She's... sister-like

430
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:39,768
You were right about equal gender
opportunities in the police department

431
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:44,773
''Noble thought, l appreciate it,
That isn't where the mistake happened''

432
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:52,155
''How do l put it? The methods,
experiments in handling criminals...''

433
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:55,825
is what is hurting the department,
- l know that...

434
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,997
my senior is pleased with my failure,
But right now...

435
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:05,460
we must put aside personal differences
considering the department's reputation

436
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,671
What's left for consideration?
Hauling in such criminals...

437
01:08:08,004 --> 01:08:10,674
''extracting confessions,
remanding them to custody...''

438
01:08:11,007 --> 01:08:14,094
it's all a waste of our time
and public money

439
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:17,472
They ought to be killed,
- This mentality...

440
01:08:18,014 --> 01:08:21,685
''because of this, the common man thinks
that the police is criminal''

441
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:28,066
You can squabble over your differences
for the rest of your lives

442
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,112
Tell me, how to resolve this crisis?''

443
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:43,164
''Put this man's mug in the papers,
asking for information, Period''

444
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:47,961
''The media will ridicule us,
they will sensationalise this''

445
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:54,759
Better keep it under covers,
- Cover-ups isn't our job

446
01:08:55,051 --> 01:08:59,556
Our job is to expose,
For the sake of reputation...

447
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:01,599
a policeman cannot endanger
the common man

448
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,980
Prabha, place the advertisement''

449
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:12,986
Pandey, you will handle this case''

450
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:45,727
lt was one of our informants who sold
news about the Azad Road diversion

451
01:09:46,394 --> 01:09:48,438
Uncle gave you the tip?
- Yes

452
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:53,151
Bring him over, l'm coming

453
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:06,748
So it's you who has caused
this embarrassment

454
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:12,587
l lost a case because of you!
- How am l to blame?

455
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:15,840
''Just because Uncle says something,
l'm hauled in...?''

456
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:24,224
The last time you came here
were you pimping for your mother?

457
01:10:24,974 --> 01:10:32,232
You think cops are suckers? You told
Parshuram, How did you find out?

458
01:10:32,982 --> 01:10:34,109
What news?

459
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:44,494
Remember your Mummy's breast?
- Digvijay Pandey gave me the news

460
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,750
He told me to tell Parshuram,
He even paid me

461
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,920
Take him away,
- Come

462
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:07,767
''lf senior officers play politics...
- No, this isn't politics''

463
01:11:09,144 --> 01:11:12,564
Digvijay is somehow connected
to Parshuram or Aditya

464
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:15,775
Not as plain as it seems

465
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:19,529
Find Uncle

466
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,454
Get out

467
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:31,207
My obeisances priest!
- Stay away

468
01:11:31,499 --> 01:11:35,211
Then show me someplace
where your God isn't

469
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:40,216
Drunken driving or what?

470
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,757
Every joy... yours

471
01:12:22,008 --> 01:12:25,178
And the woes... mine

472
01:12:27,972 --> 01:12:30,225
The greatest place on earth

473
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,228
Your lndia

474
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:35,563
Singing?

475
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,824
What's in your hands?

476
01:12:46,991 --> 01:12:49,536
Show me, what are you hiding?''

477
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:59,838
How are you related to him?
What do you know about him?

478
01:13:00,922 --> 01:13:05,719
Tell me what you know?
- l wronged him

479
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:12,767
Still can't wipe out that night
six years ago

480
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:33,163
''What are you writing, Mr Revolutionary?
- Must be something against me''

481
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:37,125
Our hard earned money goes into
doing good for the country

482
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:43,214
And these revolutionaries write crap
about me just to sell their papers

483
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:45,175
l write crap?

484
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:53,224
You put up the mineral water factory
on lands for welfare of tribals

485
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:56,144
''One minute...
- Pandey, let him talk''

486
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:58,229
Yes and so?
- You're making millions...

487
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:04,069
''selling water at 12 bucks a bottle,
but it actually belongs to tribals''

488
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:07,697
''ln return, what do the tribals get?
This...?''

489
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:13,703
You know why the water
is this colour?

490
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:19,751
Because it's adulterated
with toxic chemicals

491
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:24,005
''The poor tribals drink it,
the take ill, they die''

492
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:29,678
l'm going to expose this
at tomorrow's press

493
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:33,848
And l need your help

494
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:41,731
''Why do you need our help? You got
this guy helping you, what's his name?''

495
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:43,817
''Parshuram,
- The terrorist, right?''

496
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:45,819
What do you mean?
- On your say-so...

497
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:48,488
he blew up a factory worth 120 million,
- l know nothing of that

498
01:14:48,988 --> 01:14:50,198
You don't?

499
01:14:51,991 --> 01:14:53,201
You're lying

500
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:58,206
Why are you hitting me?
l might be against him

501
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:02,293
l'm also against terrorism
or any kind of violence

502
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:05,922
This weapon of mine is enough,
- What's your weapon?

503
01:15:06,381 --> 01:15:07,674
My weapon is enough

504
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:12,721
What are you doing?
My papers...

505
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:15,432
Name your accomplices, Talk

506
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:26,693
Name your accomplices

507
01:15:38,913 --> 01:15:41,750
Show him your weapon

508
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:46,171
Piss on him

509
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:49,257
Watch his weapon,
- What are you doing?

510
01:15:50,967 --> 01:15:52,218
Piss on him

511
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:54,137
Piss

512
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,281
l'm not having this one

513
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:15,700
Pandey...
- Shut up

514
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:18,036
This is how l'm treated?
- Listen to me

515
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:24,000
lt's a fake whiskey!
- l've ordered an English whisky

516
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:30,090
''Sit, listen, Why get worked up?
l'll buy a nice whisky''

517
01:16:33,843 --> 01:16:39,683
Even hardened criminals can't stand
a police beating, So talk

518
01:16:40,183 --> 01:16:44,688
''Else, he's going to kill you
and l won't be able to do a thing''

519
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:55,198
lt's not death that l fear,
After l'm dead...

520
01:16:56,991 --> 01:17:01,996
''if they find my son,
he's going to be dead''

521
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:05,000
He's a straight boy

522
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:11,006
l think you're a nice sort

523
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:22,684
''My son's photo is inside my pocket,
Hide the photo, please''

524
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:27,439
Hide the photo

525
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,361
Please, constable''

526
01:17:56,343 --> 01:18:00,138
He talked or didn't he?
- Not a word

527
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:03,308
He will talk, he will''

528
01:18:04,559 --> 01:18:05,685
l will

529
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:18,948
Maybe l would've been better off
as a dog wagging my tail...

530
01:18:20,992 --> 01:18:31,044
talking your language,
You wouldn't waste a bullet

531
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:39,928
''Here Pandey, look
what the revolutionary writes''

532
01:18:41,971 --> 01:18:46,768
''The greatest place on earth,
Your lndia''

533
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:52,774
Bastard! This isn't your lndia?

534
01:18:54,734 --> 01:18:59,572
Not my lndia!
This isn't my lndia

535
01:18:59,989 --> 01:19:06,913
Not my lndia! This isn't the lndia
my forefathers gave their lives for

536
01:19:08,581 --> 01:19:16,339
''This lndia is the country you wolves
are raping, selling out every day''

537
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,677
l spit on you

538
01:19:44,075 --> 01:19:45,744
Clean the mess

539
01:19:56,921 --> 01:19:59,924
l recorded Satyakam's murder
as a police encounter

540
01:20:00,925 --> 01:20:04,220
''Poor Aditya, we refused
to accept his complaint''

541
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:08,641
ln my helplessness
l killed a good man

542
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,526
Not helplessness, hypocrisy''

543
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:26,534
You expect me to empathise
with your helplessness?

544
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:34,834
l despise you! Now l understand
why the system lies in this state

545
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:39,297
''More than evil deeds by evil men,
the loss is made far greater...''

546
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:42,217
because of the silence
of the few good...

547
01:20:42,717 --> 01:20:44,844
and the cowardice
of impotent policemen like you

548
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,641
ln my eyes you have fallen...

549
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:57,607
fallen from grace,
Now instead of pitying yourself...

550
01:20:58,108 --> 01:21:06,157
''will you do something for your employer
of 18 years, Mr Madhusudan Gokhale?''

551
01:21:07,617 --> 01:21:13,581
Or would you rather live the rest
of your life like vermin? Speak

552
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:27,762
l'll do what it takes to rise in esteem,
- Where can l find Aditya?

553
01:21:30,056 --> 01:21:38,314
Talk, l must stop Aditya,
His next target is Digvijay Pandey

554
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:45,613
As long as l wear this uniform
l won't let him take another life

555
01:21:50,076 --> 01:21:50,994
Tell me

556
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:59,586
''They're still operating from the same
place, 27 kilometres from Mumbai...''

557
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:02,881
the jungles on the outskirts

558
01:22:04,841 --> 01:22:06,134
Life...

559
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:09,804
''is a never-ending battle,
a battle in which equations change''

560
01:22:16,644 --> 01:22:24,986
Take yourself, The hunter is hunted,
Digvijay Pandey is looking

561
01:22:25,653 --> 01:22:32,452
Wants to kill you, And now l know
why his informant sold us news...

562
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:34,954
about the digression

563
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:44,422
But l too have made my move,
l have sent information...

564
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:49,177
you will visit the mausoleum
of Shah Baba at midnight...

565
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:51,471
alone, unarmed''

566
01:22:52,722 --> 01:22:55,558
l had to lay the bait
for the hunt

567
01:22:57,852 --> 01:23:05,735
He will come to kill you,
But we will kill him, Not you

568
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:13,201
''Because, a lover can't pull a trigger,
lt takes guts to pull a trigger''

569
01:23:18,915 --> 01:23:24,129
Takes guts, Not to pull a trigger,
Takes guts to throw the gun away

570
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:30,677
''Their miseries, their woes
are a veritable goldmine for you''

571
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:34,556
ln your business of terrorism
that's your capital

572
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:40,437
Your struggle will be recognised only
when it's a struggle for justice...

573
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:43,523
not for vendetta

574
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:55,285
''Aditya, l know what happened to your
father, for which l apologise''

575
01:23:57,746 --> 01:24:01,082
Our department is tainted
for his murder

576
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:09,382
''Aditya, come with me,
l'll give you justice''

577
01:24:09,924 --> 01:24:11,384
Ms Prabha, one minute''

578
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:17,432
Be under no wrong impression,
You are here...

579
01:24:18,933 --> 01:24:23,355
because we let you come,
As for your fanciful logic...

580
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:28,360
we do not subscribe to it,
Our struggle might be the same...

581
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:34,366
but our ways are different,
What you insist on calling terrorism...

582
01:24:34,949 --> 01:24:40,080
is our rebellion against
a corrupt society and men like Pandey

583
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:45,627
''Whom only bullets can eradicate,
Not your law, not your verdicts''

584
01:24:47,128 --> 01:24:53,510
Give up the gun, lt didn't know a Gandhi
it doesn't recognise your mission

585
01:24:56,054 --> 01:25:04,813
''Aditya, give me one chance, Spit on me
if l don't have Digvijay cashiered''

586
01:25:05,897 --> 01:25:09,442
''For the first time, l have solid
evidence against Digvijay''

587
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:14,322
He cannot escape,
Think Aditya...

588
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:18,159
''using the gun, you will kill
only one Digvijay''

589
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:24,332
But take him to court and you expose
the system that fosters terrorism...

590
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:32,674
in the name of eradicating terrorism,
- She places her lover in a quandary

591
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:36,678
Between a rock and a hard on

592
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:44,686
Now where do you go? Knocking?
On the doors of the system...

593
01:25:45,353 --> 01:25:48,690
that refused to lodge a complaint
about your father's disappearance?

594
01:25:50,066 --> 01:25:56,031
Go over, To the policemen who pissed
on your father before they shot him

595
01:25:57,073 --> 01:25:59,159
Where do you go?

596
01:26:01,578 --> 01:26:08,626
Ask justice of this system that never
let you give your father his last rites?

597
01:26:09,544 --> 01:26:11,171
Wag your tail?

598
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:20,638
Always remember one truth,
As long as you hold this...

599
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:27,354
you can make the mightiest dance

600
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:42,786
Don't shut on yourself the doors
to return to the folds of society

601
01:26:45,872 --> 01:26:51,753
Enough Ms Prabha, Please do not
take advantage of our hospitality

602
01:26:52,962 --> 01:26:54,881
''Until we're done,
my boys will look after you''

603
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:04,659
''Try as much we wish
to forget Him...''

604
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,412
Him...

605
01:28:08,038 --> 01:28:12,959
we think of Him even more

606
01:28:19,507 --> 01:28:24,637
''We try to forget Him,
- Yet we remember Him''

607
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:20,860
''We pour our hearts out
to Him''

608
01:29:21,444 --> 01:29:26,408
''Yet we realise,
it's all our excuse''

609
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:38,294
''We try to forget Him,
- Yet we remember Him''

610
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:14,789
''Surrender to Him,
even if death be mine''

611
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:19,836
Then l am blessed

612
01:30:26,676 --> 01:30:31,639
''We try to forget Him,
- Yet we remember Him''

613
01:31:17,811 --> 01:31:22,107
ln a moment l am separated...

614
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:27,612
''from the One
l waited ages to meet''

615
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:39,833
''We try to forget Him,
- Yet we remember Him''

616
01:31:45,922 --> 01:31:50,468
''Try as much we wish
to forget Him...''

617
01:31:51,052 --> 01:31:53,471
Him...

618
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:58,893
we think of Him even more

619
01:32:29,966 --> 01:32:34,012
''The more we try to forget Him...
- We remember Him''

620
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:02,624
Stop Aditya

621
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:08,213
Aditya has surrendered,
He was a fugitive

622
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:10,757
Prabha Narayan declares war
on the system...

623
01:33:11,257 --> 01:33:13,426
plans to take on
top police officials

624
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:44,207
You realise...

625
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:50,588
this affidavit may lead to
your sentencing

626
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:59,180
You may even be given life,
- l have already served life

627
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:06,646
The last six years l have lived
inside a horrible dungeon

628
01:34:12,902 --> 01:34:14,320
My truth...

629
01:34:15,905 --> 01:34:17,741
will set me free...

630
01:34:19,909 --> 01:34:21,745
makes life easier

631
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:42,557
ln light of the affidavits by
ex-head constable Madhusudan Gokhale...

632
01:34:43,058 --> 01:34:49,481
the court orders an inquiry into
Satyakam Kashyap's death in encounter

633
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:55,820
Madhusudan Gokhale's deposition
may be treated as first information

634
01:34:56,738 --> 01:35:04,079
The enquiry report may be submitted
to this court within six months

635
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:08,083
This court...

636
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:14,506
suspends Assistant Commissioner Pandey
and lnspector Patil and orders...

637
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:20,053
''that Messrs Pandey, Patil and Gokhale
may not leave this city...''

638
01:35:20,595 --> 01:35:26,685
without lnspector Prabha Narayan
order in writing

639
01:35:33,858 --> 01:35:37,028
Why are you crying?
ls someone dead?

640
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:39,698
Shut up

641
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:43,785
Shut up

642
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:51,376
Don't hit me! My wife has deserted me
the kids won't even talk to me

643
01:35:52,877 --> 01:35:57,799
l've been cashiered!
- We'll get our jobs back

644
01:35:58,299 --> 01:36:02,637
ls this
the first departmental enquiry?

645
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:10,854
Has any policeman or any politician
ever been jailed in our country?

646
01:36:12,522 --> 01:36:15,316
You don't know?
Uneducated oaf

647
01:36:17,861 --> 01:36:23,199
How can we be jailed?
Try to understand...

648
01:36:23,825 --> 01:36:30,457
this enquiry will just go on and on,
Prabha Narayan won't last that long

649
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:37,213
''Prabha Narayan, l'll transfer you
out of life''

650
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:59,110
''You have made me so happy,
l don't mind dying''

651
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:03,823
''l'm full of hope, self-confident,
l'm on a new high, thanks to you''

652
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,625
l love you

653
01:37:17,796 --> 01:37:19,005
Dearly

654
01:37:22,884 --> 01:37:29,516
l fell for you at first sight,
But it took me time to face the truth

655
01:37:32,644 --> 01:37:39,192
''One needs courage to love,
particularly when you know...''

656
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:45,740
that you make no difference
to the object of your love

657
01:37:48,743 --> 01:37:51,162
''l should be leaving,
l remembered something urgent''

658
01:37:59,921 --> 01:38:05,969
''l know, l'm not your destiny,
Many Adityas like me need you''

659
01:38:08,596 --> 01:38:14,477
What l feel about you
is quite something else

660
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:26,197
l have so little time,
This case is getting over

661
01:38:30,535 --> 01:38:35,749
''Will l see you ever again? Let me
take a good look at you, please''

662
01:38:38,877 --> 01:38:43,423
''You aren't going to hang, Because you
surrendered, because of your help...''

663
01:38:43,923 --> 01:38:48,928
the court will be lenient,
lf you help me...

664
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:54,768
''to set your friends upon the right path,
you may be pardoned...''

665
01:38:56,269 --> 01:39:03,151
you can start life anew,
- Will you be with me in my new life?

666
01:39:06,529 --> 01:39:13,286
May l hope for your love?
lt's said...

667
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:21,419
''that a little place for you in the heart
of your loved one, makes you immortal''

668
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:27,300
Do you love me?

669
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:25,525
''When someone takes your heart,
loves you, makes you dream...''

670
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:29,487
then vanishes...

671
01:40:30,196 --> 01:40:35,618
''all those true love stories
you believed in...''

672
01:40:36,244 --> 01:40:40,832
are prayers gone unheard

673
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:47,380
Oh why did l dream of desire?

674
01:40:48,423 --> 01:40:52,927
lt's heart-rending

675
01:41:47,774 --> 01:41:52,570
Our distance, my helplessness...''

676
01:41:53,405 --> 01:41:58,284
''it's all true,
yet l don't want to believe''

677
01:42:01,996 --> 01:42:10,755
''Wet tears, upon empty paths,
we trail a caravan of memories''

678
01:42:13,925 --> 01:42:21,516
''ln silence, l nurture my obsessions,
lt's heart-rending''

679
01:43:24,913 --> 01:43:32,754
''Hopes, desires, l am nurturing,
where else can l send my dreams?''

680
01:43:36,966 --> 01:43:42,389
''You never said some things,
l left things unsaid...''

681
01:43:42,972 --> 01:43:47,811
why are we left wordless?

682
01:43:48,978 --> 01:43:56,403
''What's come over me,
what have l lost?''

683
01:43:56,986 --> 01:43:59,322
lt's heart-rending

684
01:44:00,699 --> 01:44:08,039
''When someone takes your heart,
loves you, makes you dream...''

685
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:11,751
then vanishes...

686
01:44:12,627 --> 01:44:17,757
''all those true love stories
you believed in...''

687
01:44:18,675 --> 01:44:23,471
are prayers gone unheard

688
01:44:37,736 --> 01:44:39,070
''Aditya, from the simplicity with which
you made your point...''

689
01:44:43,658 --> 01:44:47,996
''it's clear that you have come
to a decision about your life''

690
01:44:48,997 --> 01:44:53,835
''Even behind the bars,
l thought as if you're free''

691
01:44:55,378 --> 01:45:00,633
''l'm the one who is in a quandary,
l've dedicated myself to policing''

692
01:45:01,509 --> 01:45:04,971
''On the other hand, the urge
to end the loneliness in my life''

693
01:45:06,389 --> 01:45:11,311
''For the first time l realise that
we haven't all the time in our lives...''

694
01:45:11,853 --> 01:45:17,692
''to get whatever we wish
to say, do or achieve in life''

695
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:24,282
''l want to speak my heart to you,
l want to escape my loneliness...''

696
01:45:24,908 --> 01:45:32,457
''l wish to soar
to touch the heavens''

697
01:46:10,495 --> 01:46:11,329
Bitch

698
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:14,374
Want to make heaven on earth?

699
01:46:16,876 --> 01:46:18,420
Want to change the system?

700
01:46:22,757 --> 01:46:24,592
l am the system! Change

701
01:46:27,846 --> 01:46:29,806
Where are you going?

702
01:46:50,744 --> 01:46:53,955
You're doing it for the boy!
How would you have him?

703
01:46:54,956 --> 01:46:57,208
Has the hots?
Has he made you happy?

704
01:46:57,792 --> 01:47:00,628
How did he do it?
Show me how he did it

705
01:47:01,796 --> 01:47:04,632
''You want to ruin me,
so you can be?''

706
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:07,427
Whore's daughter

707
01:47:08,803 --> 01:47:10,138
Get this...

708
01:47:11,806 --> 01:47:13,475
you're dead

709
01:47:13,475 --> 01:47:15,060
l'll become a commissioner

710
01:48:11,866 --> 01:48:14,703
What are you saying?
- The truth

711
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:18,915
Digvijay Pandey attacked Prabha

712
01:48:22,544 --> 01:48:27,632
''The doctors tried their best,
but she had lost so much blood...''

713
01:48:28,883 --> 01:48:30,093
she died

714
01:48:35,724 --> 01:48:41,062
''Once again, you must turn to stone,
First, get out of here''

715
01:48:43,398 --> 01:48:49,487
''Parshuram has everything organised,
After all, you're one of us''

716
01:48:50,905 --> 01:48:55,744
''Tomorrow, On Saturdays,
the garbage truck comes''

717
01:48:56,911 --> 01:49:03,084
Just get inside the truck,
Parshuram will take care of the rest

718
01:49:05,545 --> 01:49:11,801
You must find Digvijay
before the police find him

719
01:50:07,982 --> 01:50:15,365
Look at the state you're in,
What if she was really dead?

720
01:50:17,784 --> 01:50:25,250
lt was a false alarm,
- False alarm? Meaning...

721
01:50:26,584 --> 01:50:29,295
Prabha is alive?
- Eye for eye

722
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,465
Limb for limb

723
01:50:33,008 --> 01:50:35,260
And deceit for deceit

724
01:50:40,598 --> 01:50:43,518
For the sake of the organisation
if we can set you free...

725
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:47,605
we can also kill you

726
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:54,112
Don't force me Parshuram,
l have given up violence

727
01:50:56,114 --> 01:50:59,951
Get out of my way,
l must go to Prabha

728
01:51:04,664 --> 01:51:05,749
Peace

729
01:51:07,709 --> 01:51:11,171
''l'll send you to her!
Patience, Aditya...''

730
01:51:12,047 --> 01:51:14,424
''we will send you to her,
for a reunion''

731
01:51:14,966 --> 01:51:16,426
But not here

732
01:51:17,218 --> 01:51:23,224
''Up there, First you, then she,
Have a honeymoon in heaven''

733
01:51:25,602 --> 01:51:31,983
''But before l give you a farewell,
for the sake of the organisation...''

734
01:51:32,692 --> 01:51:39,157
l must teach my boys a lesson,
ln our organisation...

735
01:51:40,575 --> 01:51:43,495
how we treat lovers

736
01:51:45,789 --> 01:51:50,669
''The man who fought oppression,
the man who demanded equality...''

737
01:51:51,211 --> 01:51:58,468
holds a gun on an unarmed man? Am l not
to have a chance to fight for my life?

738
01:52:02,931 --> 01:52:03,932
You will

739
01:52:08,978 --> 01:52:15,777
Of course you will, One who wins
will run the organisation

740
01:54:14,062 --> 01:54:15,730
Where is Prabha?

741
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:21,069
Where is Prabha?

742
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:32,997
Careful while l make a call

743
01:56:26,528 --> 01:56:33,493
''Surrender to Him,
even if death be mine''

744
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:45,171
Then l am blessed

745
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:12,115
What are you doing?

746
01:57:16,911 --> 01:57:17,954
24 hours

747
01:57:22,584 --> 01:57:25,628
lf l can't find Digvijay Pandey
in 24 hours...

748
01:57:26,588 --> 01:57:29,716
l'll set fire to
every police station in this city

749
01:57:32,802 --> 01:57:41,144
''Don't worry, Time is evil's worst foe,
Someone will surely lead us to him''

750
01:57:43,396 --> 01:57:44,939
Aditya, no...''

751
01:57:44,939 --> 01:57:46,316
Madam! What happened?

752
01:57:48,777 --> 01:57:52,405
Someone was here,
- No one

753
01:57:53,573 --> 01:57:56,242
''Who came here?
- No one, madam''

754
01:57:56,785 --> 01:57:58,286
Lie down,
- No

755
01:58:01,831 --> 01:58:08,129
''My every pore tells me someone came,
it was Aditya''

756
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:16,805
''My body never lies to me,
- Yes, you are right''

757
01:58:17,847 --> 01:58:24,771
Last night, He came,
He drugged my colleague and he escaped

758
01:58:25,814 --> 01:58:29,275
''We must stop him,
else everything is ruined''

759
01:58:30,193 --> 01:58:32,278
''No, stay in bed,
- l must stop him''

760
01:58:32,862 --> 01:58:36,658
No madam...

01:58:59,681 --> 01:59:03,643
The car is here,
- You took your time

762
01:59:05,353 --> 01:59:08,648
Picked up a customer on the way?

763
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:13,319
No takers for my looks

764
01:59:13,945 --> 01:59:20,493
''Had to find a new guy, He wants
30,000 for a hike out of town''

765
01:59:21,536 --> 01:59:23,329
That's when we pay him

766
01:59:24,497 --> 01:59:25,874
Your tip

767
01:59:26,791 --> 01:59:30,045
Remember? The lion spared the man
who drew the bone from his paw

768
01:59:30,545 --> 01:59:33,965
And l spare you,
