109
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:42,471
What happens to those
who want to get down midway?

00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,241
She is also new
to the city it seems

178
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,230
There must be
someone else around

179
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,416
1 second, sis

180
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:15,406
Excuse me

181
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:18,127
Can you help me
with directions?

182
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,016
- What?
-Address?

183
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,817
l'll call you back

184
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,568
Some girl needs help

185
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:34,551
My name is Selvi
That's my cousin

186
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,838
lt's her 1st time in Chennai
She's come for an interview

187
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,670
She is scared

188
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:44,089
Can you please board her
onto #15B bus?

189
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,184
l came to drop a friend here
l'm already late for work

190
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:49,333
Sir, please

191
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:53,149
l should have picked her up
l had to come to Kanchipuram suddenly

192
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:56,826
She got 92 marks in her under-grad
But too scared to come to the city

193
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:59,450
Even now she's working
as a school teacher forjust 3000 bucks

194
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:03,866
l forced her to apply
She will definitely get the job

195
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:05,956
Rs 25,000 salary

196
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:09,760
Middle class family
Please help her

197
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,698
Thank you, sir
Can you give the phone to her?

198
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:16,807
Tell me, sis

199
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:20,035
He'll put you in the bus
l have briefed him

200
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:21,287
Okay

201
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:25,645
Be careful
Hope you know what l'm implying

202
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,366
Call me after the interview

203
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,989
Okay, sis

204
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:41,139
Come out, there's a petrol bunk to the left
Go straight, you'll see a traffic signal

205
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,453
Opposite that is an arch
Catch #1 5B bus from there

206
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:48,144
Get a ticket
for KMC, get down

207
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:50,223
That's your bus
You can get in

208
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:23,590
Will you come in with me?
Till l get into bus #37G?

209
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:24,991
Conductor will help you

210
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:26,590
Seems like someone is following me

211
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:30,440
You left your bag behind
What happens if the bus suddenly leaves?

212
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,601
How can you give me a 100 rupee note
for a ticket that costs only Rs 3?

213
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:44,424
You sit over there
l'll sit here

214
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,347
All those who haven't got a ticket, buy it

215
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:51,760
Ticket...ticket

216
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:54,799
- Where do you want to go?
- 2 KMC

217
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:01,522
Arumbakkam

218
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,190
Watch your step

219
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:08,535
Get in slowly

220
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:10,804
Get your tickets

221
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,195
Where?
Broadway?

222
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:34,395
All those who haven't got a ticket, buy it

223
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:36,899
Why are you standing
on the foot board?

224
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:40,129
We have to get down here

225
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:45,283
My sister said 7 stops later
Only 5 stops have gone by

226
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:49,574
You need to get down in KMC
This is KMC stop

227
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:54,631
l counted correctly
We passed 5 stops

228
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,744
This is a limited stop bus

229
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:04,301
- What was the last stop?
- KMC

230
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:05,708
Happy?

231
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,576
Sorry

232
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,694
- What's your name?
- Don't get offended

233
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:27,802
l won't ask who you are or what you do
Similarly l expect you not to

234
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:40,638
l've heard lots of stories of city guys
stealing and even selling girls!

235
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:46,201
l've read in the papers and TV

236
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:50,179
l don't mean you in particular
This is quite common

237
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,844
Danush, it's me, l couldn't
reach the HR department

238
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:19,307
l've been suffering
from a bad stomach

239
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:24,175
5 or 6 times

240
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,123
Can you ask for an hour's permission?

241
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:30,289
Okay, thanks

242
00:25:32,695 --> 00:25:37,334
l need to make a call
l'll call from a booth

243
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:46,454
lt's me, Amudha
Thank God he came along

244
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:47,930
Why are you gallivanting with him?

245
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,326
You said 7 stops
but KMC stop was the 5th

246
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:57,303
Luckily he told me where to get down

247
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:04,003
Just to be on the safe side
l thought l'd describe him to you!

248
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:08,511
He's the right height
Not too short nor too tall

249
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,592
Aquiline nose
l'll be out in a minute

250
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:22,285
Blue pant torn in places
White shoes

251
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,683
Okay but take care

252
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:30,158
Bus-stop is on the opposite side

253
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,841
My sis asked me to take the subway

254
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,499
Your bus is here

255
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,140
Get in

256
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:38,824
- Which one?
- Both are same

257
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:42,245
l didn't know where to get down
in that bus

258
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:44,653
Can you come with me till that stop?

259
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:48,299
You must be joking?!
l'm already very late for work

260
00:27:48,978 --> 00:27:50,986
But you got permission

261
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:54,258
Get in or take your hand off
Just a minute

262
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,548
l'll definitely help you
when you come to my place!!

263
00:27:57,654 --> 00:27:59,443
Okay, fine
Just get in

264
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:07,927
You sit over there
l'll sit here

265
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:26,881
Bus

266
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:30,044
l am in the bus!

267
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:03,150
My dad's on the line
Cut the phone

268
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:10,834
Tell me, dude
l was talking to my dad!

269
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,336
Tomorrow?

270
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,870
Mayajaal theatre

271
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,152
lf it's car, l am game

272
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:27,864
Stop

273
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:42,233
Oh gosh!
He was inside!

274
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:47,232
Did your sister ask you
to get down halfway?

275
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:56,065
Your seat was empty
So l thought you got down without me

276
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:01,771
Give me a cigarette

277
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:10,860
Give me the exact amount

278
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:13,419
Do you have 5 rupees?

279
00:30:14,672 --> 00:30:15,982
Do you have 5 rupees?

280
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:17,158
Give me

281
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:33,110
Do you smoke?

282
00:30:37,562 --> 00:30:39,024
Booze?

283
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:40,659
l drink

284
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:45,756
The other vice also?

285
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,030
Means?

286
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:50,106
Loot?
Murder?.

287
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:55,041
Then in your home town
murder and loot are not listed as crimes?

288
00:30:58,307 --> 00:30:59,256
Sanjit?

289
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:05,118
lt's me, your phone was switched off
That's why l informed Danush

290
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:09,445
My leg is still aching

291
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,085
Can l take leave for half a day?

292
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,293
Thank you, Sanjit

293
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:25,194
- Cramps?
- No!

294
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:31,336
1st you claimed you had a bad stomach
Now you said your leg was aching

295
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:38,322
Follow traffic rules to be alive!
Distracted by girls you die!!

296
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:09,535
New girl in Chennai, a truly rare find!
She stares, she smiles, one of a kind

297
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:14,786
Why did she barge into my life?
Such a pest, she gives me strife!

298
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:24,064
New girl in Chennai, a truly rare find!
She stares, she smiles, one of a kind

299
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:34,243
What did mom and dad name their daughter?
lf you ask me, l'd name her miss Bother!

300
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:58,640
My sis asked me to take a 'share auto'?

301
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:03,501
She doesn't believe a word l say
A pain that got glued to me today

302
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:07,986
My heart can not leave her high and dry
ln a dilemma...my mind's in a quandary?!

303
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:17,341
Like the seeds scattered within a red chilly
He sizzled and spluttered inside, helplessly

304
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:27,516
Sailing on the blue sky, fluffy clouds in a haze
Scurrying somewhere with no time to laze

305
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:37,061
Like rain and sun together, hand in hand
Where is this short trip planning to land?

306
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:47,944
Wonder what his parents name their heir?.
lf you ask me, l'd name him 'Load bearer'

307
00:34:17,177 --> 00:34:22,067
Has she come to buy a ship or two
Or a pair of slippers or shoe?

308
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:26,875
Will she take my life out, no clue
How l wish l knew

309
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:31,797
Will her impact be a short preview
Or as long as a train winding through

310
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:36,214
When will she say 'goodbye'?
Totally fogged is this guy

311
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:41,080
How wrong could l have been
to think of her as innocent queen!

312
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:50,880
She kills me with her question-galore
l was angry then...not anymore

313
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:56,387
Doubts she collected...202 or more
all her doubts glued together...

314
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:16,236
She giggles, she glowers, one of a kind
New to Chennai she's a truly fine find!

315
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:27,925
God save me!

316
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:43,288
Those who are here for the interview
go up to the 1st floor

317
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:58,336
Hello

318
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:00,345
Bag?

319
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,078
l'll be back

320
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,000
- Excuse me
- Yes, madam

321
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:37,196
-A guy wearing blue tattered jeans?
- He left long ago

322
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,406
- Then my bag?
- l thought he was with you

323
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,282
He came to help me
find the way here

324
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:46,134
How could you trust
a stranger blindly like this?

325
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:49,909
- He seemed decent
-All thieves here look decent

326
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,978
He won't have a mole and colored hanky
like the villains in our old films

327
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,085
- ls he your husband?
- Yes, but not good, right?

328
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:40,520
He's simply super
l like him

329
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:43,049
Will you marry me?

330
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:45,456
Why do all guys
ask me the same question?

331
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:50,061
Mom, this guy is also
proposing to me

332
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:51,244
Come here, you chatterbox!

333
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,811
Don't embarrass me, mom!

334
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,901
Lift him up

335
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,463
Prop him up on that side
Open your eyes

336
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,700
Give him some water
Get up

337
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:14,360
Can you hear me, sir?

338
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:27,104
This is helpline 108

339
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:28,862
There's been an accident
near Vizhupuram

340
00:38:28,964 --> 00:38:31,037
- Which place?
-Arasur

341
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:32,449
Which vehicle?

342
00:38:32,582 --> 00:38:34,492
Govt bus collided
with a private bus

343
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:37,119
- How many got injured?
- Many

344
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:40,453
How did it happen?

345
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:42,276
May be he was talking over
the phone while driving

346
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:43,779
More than half are dead

347
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:47,015
Private bus from Chennai
Govt bus from Trichy?

348
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:51,427
- How many died on the spot?
- 30 to 40

349
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:52,395
30 to 40?!

350
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:56,200
Stop the press
We have to change the headlines

351
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:00,586
Water, sir

352
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,476
Open your eyes
Which place are you from?

353
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,206
He's dead

354
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:39,615
Trichy 259 Km

355
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,859
Chennai 257 Km

356
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:50,209
Shall l hide and see(k), dear?
Or help your back with lather?

357
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:56,201
Oh! Please...never
l'd then surrender

358
00:39:56,298 --> 00:40:00,042
This flower is held to bloom
by a tiny fragile stem

359
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,614
The protected pure jasmine flower
blossomed from its shyness cover

360
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,906
Few months before

361
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:23,649
Your stuff is ready
You can collect it by 6:00 P.M

362
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:25,703
Greetings

363
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:28,454
Kadiresa, is your girl
wearing red today?

364
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:30,181
Beware! You are seeing herfrom far

365
00:42:30,283 --> 00:42:32,805
Like my wife, she may end up
as a nasty surprise!

366
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:37,607
What Kadiresa?
You look very bright today

367
00:42:40,784 --> 00:42:42,858
ls your girl
wearing black today?

368
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,969
- Yours is red?
- Yes

369
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:53,745
What are you gaping at?
This is another one, next door

370
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:56,049
So long as you don't
get thrashed!

371
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:00,983
Why are you wearing khaki
right from home?

372
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,984
My girl is in a polytechnic college
So that's my color

373
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:05,716
ls this color co-ordination
what you are being paid for?.

374
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:07,892
That's why l shouldn't employ
such immature boys

375
00:44:39,683 --> 00:44:44,835
Who are you? Come out
Anyone can get the wrong idea

376
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,268
Oh! They won't get
the same wrong idea

377
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:49,505
...when you signal from here
or show all your teeth!!

378
00:44:50,503 --> 00:44:52,446
How does it bother you
if l signal some girl over there?

379
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:58,469
- That 'some girl' is me!
- Her hair is really long

380
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:02,691
Yes, it is long

381
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:04,740
l agree you can't see
my face too well

382
00:45:04,846 --> 00:45:07,302
Won't you know to differentiate
mother and daughter?

383
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:12,144
You waved out to my mom also
How can l tell her its mistaken identity?!

384
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:16,396
lf l leave at 8:30, you could have waited
for me from 8:15 to 8:45 A.M

385
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:20,046
Otherwise wait
on this side, same time

386
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:23,892
Why keep waving
from here for past 6 months?

387
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:29,011
From 4th day that you started 'hitting' on me,
l saw you here in front of your building

388
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:34,902
- Then saw you in the tea shop, puffing
- l don't smoke

389
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:36,694
l know
That ebony guy smokes

390
00:45:36,795 --> 00:45:38,934
You drink milk, don't you?

391
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:44,243
l thought of giving you 2 tight slaps
But you look smart, so l changed my mind

392
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:47,069
Salary?
Rs 9000?

393
00:45:47,616 --> 00:45:49,624
Today is the 6th
You haven't opened your salary cover?

394
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:52,767
Daily alarm at 5:00 A.M
l saw your mobile

395
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:53,914
lsn't it for me?

396
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:57,059
'Parvathi' is saved in your phone
ls that your mother's #?.

397
00:45:57,156 --> 00:45:59,230
Oh! Gosh! Why did you
call my mother?

398
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,093
Don't believe
whatever this girl said, ma

399
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:07,615
She thought my hand-stretches
were signals to catch her attention

400
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:11,585
Which girl?
Did you dream something wild?

401
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,329
- What did you tell my mother?
- l didn't, you are the one who blabbered

402
00:46:17,773 --> 00:46:21,320
l have to go to work
l'll talk to you this evening, ma

403
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:22,601
Hello! Kadiresa

404
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:27,658
You think someone will misunderstand us
You are so petrified of your mother

405
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:31,564
But you draw my attention
by matching your shirt to my dress!

406
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:33,358
Are you in love with me?

407
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:41,808
See you at 5:00 P.M
in lbrahim park

408
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:47,256
- l am at work till 7:00 P.M
-Ask for permission

409
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:50,006
- My boss won't give 2 hours off
- Then take leave

410
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,825
l haven't taken off
since the day l joined work

411
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:54,298
You've started
your love story?

412
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:56,601
Hereafter start playing hooky
at work, learn to lie,

413
00:46:56,702 --> 00:47:01,014
...fight, borrow money,
go to court and face the cops

414
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,680
Be ready to face all this

415
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,928
Bring your salary cover
when you come!

416
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:30,787
For months, 6 long months
l mooned for my dainty duchess

417
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:39,690
For weeks, 24 or more weeks
l waited (im)patiently for my princess

418
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,062
Eyes didn't retire
Ears couldn't hear

419
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:44,813
Hungerwas a stranger
Lips lacked cheer

420
00:47:49,012 --> 00:47:51,217
Hands just halted
Feet simply faltered

421
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:54,165
l was agitated,
with a muddled mind

422
00:47:57,912 --> 00:48:03,316
For months together l pined

423
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:16,953
For 6 long months altogether
l ached for my precious flower

424
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:44,584
ln the park, road, auto or bus
l didn't see her in any of these places

425
00:48:44,683 --> 00:48:49,508
Neither at the theatre or in the street
l saw her at a distance, some 600 feet

426
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,173
Woods, slope, summit or valley
Neither here nor there is she

427
00:48:56,273 --> 00:49:00,781
She wasn't impressed, half orwhole
l'm right there in her heart and soul

428
00:49:00,883 --> 00:49:09,681
Maybe she paused to see me, in my street
l went past her, ignoring her complete

429
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:14,673
For long, l longed
for my tender tendril!

430
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:23,891
For months, 180 or more days
l waited (im)patiently for my angel

431
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:46,915
l didn't call her, no phone number
l didn't even pen her any love letter

432
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:51,718
l didn't send a messenger or follow
How did this happen, l don't know

433
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:58,439
No fights or sarcastic remarks either
No stare, no smile...neither

434
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:02,665
l didn't hold her hand or act rudely
How did she fall in love with me?

435
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:11,880
She merged into my soul as one
My perfect match, my home-run!

436
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:17,006
l thirsted for her, my sweet honey

437
00:50:17,107 --> 00:50:28,526
For months, 6 months
l fell in love fanatically

438
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:34,934
Eyes didn't retire
Ears couldn't hear

439
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:37,818
l felt no hunger
Lips lacked cheer

440
00:50:47,264 --> 00:50:51,128
l wooed her frantically

441
00:51:02,503 --> 00:51:04,675
lbrahim park

442
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:13,831
lf l hadn't wasted 6 months,
we'd also be here as a couple

443
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:19,400
Rascal!

444
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:23,948
Oh gosh!
Why is he here?

445
00:51:25,009 --> 00:51:26,919
Have you forgotten me, bro?

446
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:29,511
l am Pandi's younger brother

447
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:31,946
He works with my brother

448
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:36,821
Don't blow my cover off
She's got hooked on to me!

449
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,952
My classmate
Wants help with her Math

450
00:51:40,823 --> 00:51:42,515
At least change the subject, dude!

451
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:44,632
One minute

452
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:49,748
Don't tell his brother
that you saw us together

453
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:51,477
- Take this ice cream?
- No, it's okay

454
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,693
l didn't even taste it

455
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:17,315
Go to Esprit

456
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:23,465
Shall l ask right now
if she also loves me?

457
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:27,172
Did you apply lipstick?

458
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:32,553
lce...

459
00:52:37,648 --> 00:52:38,630
Pay him and come

460
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:42,732
- How much
- 150?

461
00:52:42,834 --> 00:52:44,722
From our village Arasurto Trichy
it is only 90 bucks

462
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:48,617
ls it your 1st time by auto rickshaw?
You'll get used to it

463
00:52:49,877 --> 00:52:54,833
Esprit is a boutique
l thought it was a hotel

464
00:53:04,155 --> 00:53:08,313
- What's your hip size?
- l don't know

465
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:09,587
Don't know?

466
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:15,928
Can you measure his hip?

467
00:53:16,032 --> 00:53:17,014
Lift your hands

468
00:53:17,504 --> 00:53:20,735
lsn't there a guy to do this?
lt's okay

469
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:26,042
- 30
- Thanks

470
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:28,668
Why all this fuss?

471
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:35,199
My cousin shares your size
So l'll know what to buy for him

472
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:39,743
Cousin?! You brought me here
to know his size

473
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:42,113
l paid auto-fare on top of this

474
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,249
Will these 2 match?

475
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:55,568
Soooper match!
l mean it

476
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:56,526
Go

477
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:08,875
lt is torn
l think its old

478
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:13,175
Then this?
This one?

479
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,184
- ls everything torn?
- That's the trend

480
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:18,901
What a threadbare style!!!

481
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:20,826
Since its for your cousin
why should l care?!

482
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,242
Take whatever you want

483
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,052
Looks like its made
for your cousin

484
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:34,911
- Rs 6000, ma'am
- 6000?

485
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,767
- Give me cash
- What?

486
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:38,876
l am telling you to pay

487
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,347
Why should l pay
for your cousin?

488
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,108
Just pay

489
00:54:45,895 --> 00:54:49,192
How did Mr Dusky catch that girl
with just 1 ice cream?

490
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:54,759
This will be only Rs 300-400 in the shop
of my choice, shall we go there?

491
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:56,423
Pay!!!

492
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:10,442
Oh God! What's he doing?
You've counted thrice

493
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:11,855
Let me count

494
00:55:11,954 --> 00:55:16,211
Will 6000 become 7000
if you count for the 4th time?

495
00:55:16,308 --> 00:55:18,643
- Notes might be stuck
- High hopes!

496
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,113
Thank you, ma'am

497
00:55:25,847 --> 00:55:28,150
She glitters like gold

498
00:55:30,937 --> 00:55:31,799
Phone

499
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:37,174
My boss
Don't talk

500
00:55:38,685 --> 00:55:43,902
l sprained my neck badly at work

501
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:50,239
They applied ointment and gave
pain killers plus 2 injections

502
00:55:51,362 --> 00:55:53,632
Which hospital?

503
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,920
Esprit hospital, bro?

504
00:55:58,341 --> 00:56:01,638
l'll come to work tomorrow

505
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:08,964
- lt happened just like you predicted
- What?

506
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:17,389
Love means lie, ask permission, take leave
1st day itself l did 2 out of the 3!

507
00:56:24,529 --> 00:56:25,576
What do you want to order?.

508
00:56:27,474 --> 00:56:29,362
Masala dosa?
(pancake with potato filling)

509
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,203
lt's a coffee shop

510
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,676
That's okay, l'll have coffee
after l eat my dosa

511
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:38,480
You get only coffee here!

512
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,134
Ask for instant coffee

513
00:56:43,673 --> 00:56:46,009
Choose from this menu card

01:11:49,629 --> 01:11:51,703
l don't like any bride
you've seen so far

683
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:53,754
Then tell me
what you expect

684
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:59,383
You won't understand if l tell you
overthe phone, l'll talk to you later

685
01:12:02,754 --> 01:12:04,643
You sit here
l'll sit there

686
01:12:26,829 --> 01:12:30,725
lt'll be a tough match this time

687
01:12:57,946 --> 01:12:58,994
We have to get down here

688
01:13:21,412 --> 01:13:22,689
Oh crap! Office van!!

689
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,949
Your team mate is here
playing truant

690
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:28,454
Mani, reverse the van

691
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:34,594
Get in, dude

692
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:38,114
There's no rule that you can't
get into the company vehicle on your day off

693
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:41,415
His leg is aching
How will he get in?

694
01:13:41,677 --> 01:13:42,855
Oh! l thought it was his stomach!

695
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:46,374
Stomach ache traveled down
to his leg apparently!! Right?

696
01:13:48,464 --> 01:13:49,479
Get in

697
01:14:06,168 --> 01:14:10,163
Call him
Soooper, dude!!

698
01:14:10,777 --> 01:14:12,436
lt's not what you think

699
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:15,442
l went to drop my friend
in Koyambedu, l met her there

700
01:14:15,772 --> 01:14:19,385
She's new to Chennai
Scared...didn't know the way

701
01:14:19,518 --> 01:14:20,412
This is more than enough

702
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:23,064
New to Chennai
Can't find her way!

703
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:24,989
Look who's talking?
Personification of a typical lndian bride!

704
01:14:27,328 --> 01:14:30,013
Don't laugh
They'll misunderstand us

705
01:14:30,241 --> 01:14:33,090
Even if she doesn't laugh
we will misunderstand

706
01:14:33,859 --> 01:14:37,276
You went to drop your friend
in your bike?!

707
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:40,709
Oh gawd! l forgot
l parked it in the bus stand

708
01:14:41,095 --> 01:14:42,022
Wonder if it's still there!

709
01:14:42,118 --> 01:14:44,421
How will you remember with a girl
like this by your side?!

710
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,535
Excuse me

711
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:47,903
He's a fine boy!

712
01:14:48,201 --> 01:14:53,124
l tried proposing to him for 2 years
in all the languages that exist in vain!!

713
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,108
Are you looking at this chain?

714
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:59,563
Then, a nitwit knowing
my entire history married me!

715
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:03,211
This is that good Samaritan!

716
01:15:11,955 --> 01:15:13,450
Bye, buddy

717
01:15:22,104 --> 01:15:24,472
Sister, we are at Ashok nagar

718
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:29,492
There's a Ganga grocery stores
From there if you go straight

719
01:15:29,595 --> 01:15:31,930
You will see a play ground
Go past that and turn right

720
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:35,191
There's a temple
Take 2nd right from there

721
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:38,458
No one tells an address
short and sweet in this city?

722
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,826
l'll give it to him

723
01:15:40,928 --> 01:15:41,822
Address

724
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:54,368
You hung-up half way? That's all?
She gave me elaborate directions

725
01:15:54,726 --> 01:15:56,832
She told you the way
She told me the address

726
01:15:59,272 --> 01:16:02,754
1 Cadbury's, 2 Good day biscuit
2 Five star bars

727
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,437
1 Kings cigarette
Brand is Kings, right?

728
01:16:17,584 --> 01:16:20,302
l meant to ask you
What happened to your interview?

729
01:16:20,432 --> 01:16:24,046
l got selected, but Bangalore,
so l declined their offer

730
01:16:38,488 --> 01:16:42,768
Your description of him matches perfectly
Not too tall nor too short

731
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:47,579
But 1 point you were off target
in your analysis

732
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,539
You said he looks dubious?
He looks trust-worthy on 1st sight

733
01:16:51,646 --> 01:16:52,508
That was then

734
01:16:53,023 --> 01:16:59,288
She was suspicious of you
Especially to trust a stranger in Chennai

735
01:16:59,394 --> 01:17:01,664
Chennai means only bad people, huh?

736
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:08,475
Places like Madurai, Coimbatore
and Nammakkal are full of local residents

737
01:17:08,805 --> 01:17:11,108
Only Chennai is cosmopolitan

738
01:17:11,623 --> 01:17:13,184
Chennai has many faces and many facets!

739
01:17:13,607 --> 01:17:17,351
Chennai also has its share of good
and bad people like all other cities

740
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:19,272
Sorry...l agree

741
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,029
How can l make you
stand outside like this?

742
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:22,725
Let me offer you coffee?
Come in

743
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,388
l have to go
l have some urgent work

744
01:17:25,485 --> 01:17:28,334
You must come home next time
No excuses

745
01:17:28,526 --> 01:17:29,541
Sure

746
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:31,493
Come, let's go in

747
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:33,776
l'll take leave

748
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:38,032
1 moment

749
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:41,299
You won't misunderstand me
if l say something?

750
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:45,522
lf a girl asks you for help
board her in #15B

751
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:51,924
But to take the effort of #37G,
1 hour permission, half day leave,

752
01:17:52,056 --> 01:17:54,359
wait till interview gets over...

753
01:17:54,457 --> 01:17:56,978
full day...loss of pay

754
01:17:57,115 --> 01:17:59,482
Don't be so accommodative
Be a little street- smart

755
01:18:00,732 --> 01:18:01,626
Okay

756
01:18:03,902 --> 01:18:04,982
My name is Amudha!!!

757
01:18:12,129 --> 01:18:14,912
lf you come to Trichy,
do come home

758
01:18:15,906 --> 01:18:19,934
Me and Trichy?
lf l come...let's see

759
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:24,289
He seems a good guy
How could you think ill of him?

760
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:27,556
Bring that roti to the table

761
01:18:27,656 --> 01:18:31,716
Ifthis had been my husband, even 15 years later
he'd have told the whole world...

762
01:18:31,817 --> 01:18:33,923
...'your cousin caused me loss of pay'!!!

763
01:18:34,282 --> 01:18:37,960
Such nice guys you come across
only when you travel

764
01:18:41,421 --> 01:18:44,718
Forever with a toy
Eat and then you can play

765
01:18:45,647 --> 01:18:48,332
Hereafter Chennai will remind you
only of him, right?

766
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:10,486
What did you decide about yourjob?

767
01:19:15,227 --> 01:19:17,978
Amudha, what did you decide
about yourjob?

768
01:19:19,806 --> 01:19:23,637
l got over my fear of Chennai only now
How will l go to Bangalore?

769
01:19:30,435 --> 01:19:33,502
- What are you preoccupied about?
- Nothing, sis

770
01:20:22,233 --> 01:20:27,385
l can't call you
l don't know your name or alias

771
01:20:27,483 --> 01:20:32,635
l christened you anew
but you are totally oblivious

772
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:34,108
Nick name l've given you

773
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:35,319
Did your sister ask you
to get down halfway?

774
01:20:35,422 --> 01:20:37,878
...everyone can find out too

775
01:20:37,983 --> 01:20:43,070
lf l say this name once, so pure
sleep will take a detour

776
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:48,060
l repeat your name to myself
as 'love- talk' daily

777
01:20:48,164 --> 01:20:54,309
My love for you far exceeds
what you feel for me

778
01:20:59,176 --> 01:21:00,868
You have to get down
in KMC, right?

779
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:03,106
Mother, listen to my poetry

780
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:06,310
l can't believe l believed
Why did l believe?

781
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:11,116
ls there a reason to believe
or disbelieve? Sure, there is

782
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:14,510
l believe, to trust is life
How is it?

783
01:21:14,607 --> 01:21:25,523
Befitting beautiful names for benefit
A name that's so hot and happening

784
01:21:36,249 --> 01:21:41,466
When uttered, my lips spark a flame

785
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:46,649
lt's not Sunny, Aditya, Suresh, Surya,
Ravish, Aadhavan or Arya?

786
01:21:46,749 --> 01:21:51,966
A name that's so refreshingly cool
When muttered, my heart feels the same

787
01:21:52,063 --> 01:21:57,084
Neither is it Nadish, Varun, Salil orJalesh,
name of a river or sea, so think afresh!

788
01:21:57,185 --> 01:22:06,976
Warm fuzzy but doesn't have sacred fame
Not beastly but a stunning proper name

789
01:22:07,078 --> 01:22:12,165
lt isn't a pet name or title
though it sparkles halo and goodwill

790
01:22:12,263 --> 01:22:18,049
Shall l whisper my surname?!??

791
01:22:23,213 --> 01:22:25,156
- Hi sis!
- How are you?

792
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:26,826
New house
Looks awesome

793
01:22:26,926 --> 01:22:30,670
Uncle, you look awesome too
Like a college student

794
01:22:31,088 --> 01:22:33,161
-Ask your sister
- What's all this?

795
01:22:33,265 --> 01:22:36,943
- l got father a shirt with my 1st salary
- But this shirt looks familiar?

796
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:38,953
He wore an identical shirt!?

797
01:22:54,906 --> 01:22:57,460
- lt's the longest name ever
- What happened?

798
01:22:57,563 --> 01:23:00,019
- lt was just fake jewelry
...leave you breathless for sure

799
01:23:00,124 --> 01:23:05,211
lf you ask me more details
my reply just fails?

800
01:23:05,311 --> 01:23:10,550
Shortest name that passes by
within the wink of an eye!

801
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:15,744
How do l express this suspense
lt's a language beyond sense

802
01:23:15,843 --> 01:23:20,930
When spoken, lips tend to zip

803
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:25,406
When written, honey will drip?

804
01:23:25,511 --> 01:23:30,663
lt's a Thamizh name pure and true
no foreign influence inserted into

805
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:36,427
Shall l recite my last name?!

806
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,735
Nose not aquiline enough!

807
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:49,034
l don't like his eyebrows
l can't call you

808
01:23:49,137 --> 01:23:51,594
l don't know your name or alias

809
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:56,883
l christened you anew
but you are totally oblivious

810
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:01,804
l repeat your name to myself
...as 'love- talk' daily?

811
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:10,195
My love for you far exceeds
what you feel for me

812
01:24:11,835 --> 01:24:13,046
What's all this?

813
01:24:13,852 --> 01:24:14,780
Move aside

814
01:24:16,348 --> 01:24:17,396
l asked you to move aside

815
01:24:20,959 --> 01:24:25,238
Curly hair
Aquiline nose

816
01:24:26,305 --> 01:24:27,166
This is life

817
01:24:27,265 --> 01:24:29,241
How did you decide
on a single day's acquaintance?

818
01:24:30,787 --> 01:24:35,808
You served my brother-in-law tea
when he came to see you

819
01:24:36,357 --> 01:24:42,208
He drank the tea and said he liked you
You said the same

820
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:47,493
Your decision was made in those few minutes
that you spent serving him tea!

821
01:24:48,554 --> 01:24:52,931
lf you compare that
l shared a whole day with him

822
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:58,756
l like him
Please, sis

823
01:25:04,881 --> 01:25:07,752
Okay, l'll talk to my uncle

824
01:25:49,093 --> 01:25:51,199
What will l do without you?!

825
01:25:52,935 --> 01:25:54,462
Get up

826
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:00,423
My dearest!

827
01:26:06,156 --> 01:26:11,079
Jasmine

828
01:26:12,206 --> 01:26:13,581
Buy some jasmine

829
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:19,150
Give 1 cubit

830
01:26:26,804 --> 01:26:28,049
Buy some jasmine

831
01:26:28,214 --> 01:26:29,741
- Grandma, give 4 elbow-lengths
- Why 4?

832
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:33,488
lt's for his new bride with love
Why deny him that pleasure?!

833
01:26:35,032 --> 01:26:40,916
- l have only 2 elbow-lengths left
lf you buy it, l can go home!

834
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,738
The enticing parrot, bride-to-be
cocooned in her love so true

835
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:31,022
That jasmine, happy in its love
blossomed for him anew

836
01:27:35,314 --> 01:27:37,005
- Do you have a pen?
- Yes, l do

837
01:27:54,842 --> 01:27:55,825
Don't get annoyed, sir

838
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,621
Better to graze 4 buffaloes
than drive this white elephant!.

839
01:28:13,346 --> 01:28:14,394
- What happened, bro?
- Flat tyre

840
01:28:14,499 --> 01:28:15,481
Get the spare tyre

841
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:29,408
Aren't you Manivel's son?
Don't you work in Trichy?

842
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:30,758
That girl traveling with you...

843
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:34,506
Your dad told me about your love
lt's not wrong these days

844
01:28:35,051 --> 01:28:38,052
Your parents have had a tough life
Take care of them well

845
01:28:41,102 --> 01:28:42,597
Step on it hard...fast

846
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:44,459
- Press hard
- You got a flat tyre?

847
01:28:44,559 --> 01:28:47,179
-Are any seats vacant in your bus?
- Yeah, 5

848
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,380
Those who don't want to be delayed
take that bus, 5 seats are vacant

849
01:28:51,186 --> 01:28:53,675
No dude, l'll go ahead,
you come later

850
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:05,078
- Murugesan hasn't come?
- He will come in the next trip, bro

851
01:29:13,596 --> 01:29:14,545
Move

852
01:29:19,326 --> 01:29:20,887
Why is he running a marathon?!

853
01:30:10,804 --> 01:30:18,576
Pick up the phone, daddy

854
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:22,102
Dad's coming home
Truly, sweet heart

855
01:30:24,379 --> 01:30:28,275
My daughter's on the line
Tell her l am on my way to see her

856
01:30:29,885 --> 01:30:31,926
l'll give it to the uncle
sitting next to me

857
01:30:34,911 --> 01:30:39,103
- Did you have lunch, uncle?
- l did...did you?

858
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:43,800
- l want lots of toys
- He's got you plenty of toys

859
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:47,482
He'll see you soon
l'll give the phone to your dad

860
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:54,854
l'll be there in 4 hours
Let me talk to your mom

861
01:30:56,264 --> 01:30:58,818
l'll be there in 4 hours, dear
See you soon

862
01:31:00,138 --> 01:31:01,283
ls there some crisis at home?

863
01:31:01,386 --> 01:31:04,421
l was in Dubai for 5 years
My wife was expecting

864
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:11,176
She was in her 8th month, when l left
My child is 5 now, yet to see her

865
01:31:12,015 --> 01:31:16,686
Every time l called, only if l said
'l'm coming to see you' she'll hang up

866
01:31:17,617 --> 01:31:19,211
Now she isn't believing me
when l'm really going to see her

867
01:31:19,314 --> 01:31:22,098
My office even extended
my visa for 5 more years

868
01:31:22,195 --> 01:31:26,223
What do l gain by just making money
and not being with my wife and child?

869
01:31:26,421 --> 01:31:29,968
l said 'to hell with money'
and l'm heading back home

870
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,336
My name is Ramesh

871
01:31:52,384 --> 01:31:53,791
Crap! lt got disconnected

872
01:31:57,154 --> 01:31:59,195
Yes, this is Pooja

873
01:31:59,491 --> 01:32:01,597
Final year engineering
Meenakshi college

874
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:04,544
My hometown is Kulithalai
Dad's a school teacher

875
01:32:05,446 --> 01:32:10,914
My phone # is 97101 14845

876
01:32:13,769 --> 01:32:16,039
What? Why am l saying all this?

877
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:18,275
lf you can give me details,
why can't l?!

878
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:25,572
Let me help you

879
01:32:28,687 --> 01:32:32,366
Listen to me
Koel bird, my dear

880
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,409
Enough

881
01:32:35,955 --> 01:32:40,594
When do l garland you?
ls that date near?

882
01:32:40,757 --> 01:32:48,824
Your eyes entice me
to follow you willingly

883
01:32:49,881 --> 01:32:50,677
ls everyone in?

884
01:32:50,777 --> 01:32:52,436
All of you please ensure
that the passenger next to you is in

885
01:32:52,537 --> 01:32:55,222
Sir, you can sit here
He went in that bus

886
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:20,517
How many times did l tell you
to pick me up from home?!

887
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:22,434
l am terrified of your father

888
01:33:22,535 --> 01:33:25,765
- So, if he intimidates you, you'll ditch me?
- No, l won't

889
01:33:25,928 --> 01:33:27,041
You better not do that!

890
01:33:29,162 --> 01:33:32,359
lf l see you here again
l'll slice you into half!

891
01:33:40,718 --> 01:33:46,220
l never spoke a single word out of turn
As l was talking, he hit me

892
01:33:46,577 --> 01:33:49,360
His colleagues ganged up with him

893
01:33:53,652 --> 01:33:54,862
lt hurts

894
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:02,094
Hold it

895
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:12,697
- Are you a doctor?.
- No, nurse

896
01:34:13,212 --> 01:34:16,509
Oh yeah! Your face
deserves a doctor!

897
01:34:16,606 --> 01:34:23,133
l made up my mind right from childhood
l'll fall in love with a nurse and marry her

898
01:34:27,299 --> 01:34:28,509
What else did he tell you?

899
01:34:28,835 --> 01:34:34,107
That he went behind you for 6 years
But l didn't believe him

900
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,469
Open your mouth

901
01:34:45,418 --> 01:34:46,629
What he said was true

902
01:34:47,787 --> 01:34:50,690
He followed me for 6 years
l was indifferent

903
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:52,650
Do you know
what he said in the end?

904
01:34:52,749 --> 01:34:54,659
Do you think you are Rathi?
(Hindu Goddess of love)

905
01:34:54,766 --> 01:34:57,669
l've been hitting on you for 6 years
You are ignoring me royally

906
01:34:57,776 --> 01:35:00,712
Let me see if you can get
anyone else better than me

907
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:01,839
Get lost

908
01:35:03,218 --> 01:35:06,285
On all counts
l'm better than him

909
01:35:06,387 --> 01:35:08,624
Better educated
with a betterjob

910
01:35:08,724 --> 01:35:10,285
Better looking

911
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:14,831
lf you see me alone
maybe l'm not up to the mark

912
01:35:14,967 --> 01:35:18,514
But compared to him
l am little betterfor sure

913
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:23,000
Come to Govt. hospital tomorrow

914
01:35:23,194 --> 01:35:26,512
-Are you a nurse in GH?
- No, l work in KMC

915
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,877
- Then why should l come there?
- Will you do as l tell you?

916
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,168
ls this form
to register our marriage?

917
01:35:39,938 --> 01:35:42,143
Did you bring your snap?
Give it to me

918
01:35:43,203 --> 01:35:46,947
Generally, they won't do it in General hospital
Maybe 'cos you are a nurse, they agreed

919
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:53,662
- What's your full name?
- M.Kadiresan

920
01:35:55,368 --> 01:35:57,507
- Date of birth?
- 5 l 9 l 88

921
01:36:06,509 --> 01:36:09,991
- Sign here
- What's this?

922
01:36:10,671 --> 01:36:14,251
Organ donation

923
01:36:16,721 --> 01:36:19,472
Shall l ask my folks at home
and then sign this form?

924
01:36:19,571 --> 01:36:21,514
Did l ask permission?

925
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,177
Why are you such a scaredy-cat?

926
01:36:24,277 --> 01:36:27,442
You are cremated even a day later
you'll stink to high heaven!

927
01:36:27,542 --> 01:36:29,681
Even the pallbearer
will clamp his nose tight

928
01:36:30,327 --> 01:36:32,979
You are giving up
what's decaying into the soil

929
01:36:36,538 --> 01:36:39,736
Understood? What?

930
01:36:39,867 --> 01:36:43,665
You are cremated even a day later
you'll stink to high heaven!

931
01:36:43,805 --> 01:36:45,594
Will you sign?

932
01:36:51,136 --> 01:36:54,749
- Only after l die, right?
- Of course

933
01:36:58,627 --> 01:37:01,825
- How old are you?
- 23

934
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:06,332
- How old do you think l am?
-About 20

935
01:37:07,335 --> 01:37:11,461
l know guys love
to put us down!

936
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:14,272
Compared to you, l am 4...

937
01:37:14,378 --> 01:37:17,892
4 years less?
l thought you must be only 19

938
01:37:17,996 --> 01:37:20,680
4 months olderthan you!

939
01:37:22,061 --> 01:37:23,720
Doesn't matter, so what?

940
01:37:29,104 --> 01:37:30,250
Did you assume
l was a gullible idiot?

941
01:37:30,417 --> 01:37:32,523
You used a moron
to break my hand!

942
01:37:46,968 --> 01:37:51,672
Then, l'd have been forced to
tell you how he maligned you

943
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:53,265
That's why l didn't tell you

944
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:56,442
Serves him right

945
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,119
l am only worried
about the 4 months age difference

946
01:38:09,346 --> 01:38:10,294
See you

947
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:13,498
Bro, stop

948
01:38:21,287 --> 01:38:23,709
Wait! 4 months isn't a big deal

949
01:38:23,848 --> 01:38:26,598
Tendulkar's wife Anjali is
5 years older than him

950
01:38:27,305 --> 01:38:30,307
You aren't Tendulkar
Neither am l Anjali!!

951
01:38:30,731 --> 01:38:34,310
l may not be Tendulkar to you
But you are definitely Anjali to me

952
01:38:37,262 --> 01:38:38,407
Go, sit there

953
01:38:51,924 --> 01:38:54,227
- l haven't come for any treatment
- l know

954
01:39:02,808 --> 01:39:05,143
Loosen your hand,
it won't hurt

955
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:21,758
Hold it that way
for a while

956
01:39:28,483 --> 01:39:31,266
She also changes from colored dress
to work clothes

957
01:39:33,989 --> 01:39:37,089
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Let's meet on Thursday in Mukkambu

958
01:39:37,191 --> 01:39:39,712
Thursday...4 days

959
01:39:40,457 --> 01:39:42,978
l said we'll met in Mukkambu on Thursday

960
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:55,717
Did you get it?

961
01:40:08,789 --> 01:40:12,205
You took a HlVtest?
And you didn't even tell me!

962
01:40:14,487 --> 01:40:18,612
Are you my cousin,
classmate or childhood friend?

963
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:20,722
lf we are in love,
we should marry, right?

964
01:40:20,986 --> 01:40:25,298
Then we should live happily for 50 years?
Shouldn't l know about my soul mate?

965
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:28,885
You drooled over me,
l did the same?

966
01:40:28,989 --> 01:40:32,733
We introduced ourselves
And now we claim to love each other

967
01:40:32,831 --> 01:40:34,260
Then paint the city red

968
01:40:34,368 --> 01:40:37,598
Brush against each other in the road
while walking, pretend its accidental

969
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:40,349
Pretending to sleep in the bus and casually
slipping head onto the other's shoulder

970
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:43,070
'Nose to nose play' in the theatre!

971
01:40:43,172 --> 01:40:45,082
l won't buy all these?

972
01:40:45,349 --> 01:40:48,099
lf you love me you should know
about all the hassles you'll face

973
01:40:48,197 --> 01:40:50,140
That's why l asked you
to meet my dad and Sendhil

974
01:40:50,247 --> 01:40:53,347
Same way l need to know
what l'm getting into, loving you!

975
01:40:53,448 --> 01:40:56,199
lf we don't know this
and we get married,

976
01:40:56,297 --> 01:41:03,272
...your friend will tarnish
my reputation to you

977
01:41:03,404 --> 01:41:07,781
Your sister-in-law will brainwash you
about our age difference

978
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:12,262
Your dad will object
to my dad being a cop

979
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,448
This in toto is Manimekalai

980
01:41:14,545 --> 01:41:17,328
You may have hassles or may not

981
01:41:17,426 --> 01:41:21,137
But if you do,
you should be courageous

982
01:41:21,268 --> 01:41:23,887
lf you are with me on this
let's continue our love, otherwise tata!

983
01:41:25,397 --> 01:41:28,595
Then, you didn't love me
truly all these days?

984
01:41:29,271 --> 01:41:31,694
lf you can face problems,
we can continue this love

985
01:41:33,945 --> 01:41:35,025
l'm ready

986
01:41:37,563 --> 01:41:42,169
- Think deeply before you say yes
- Ready

987
01:41:43,069 --> 01:41:44,411
Take an hour's time

988
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:32,593
l've thought long and hard

989
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:35,473
Even if my friend tells me
a guy was 'hitting' on you for 6 years

990
01:42:35,571 --> 01:42:38,769
...even if my sister-in-law
brainwashes me about our age difference

991
01:42:38,869 --> 01:42:44,086
...my parents object to an alliance
into a cop family, l won't listen to them

992
01:42:44,503 --> 01:42:45,910
- You won't change your mind?
- No

993
01:42:47,256 --> 01:42:49,494
Okay
l love you

994
01:42:50,682 --> 01:42:53,465
- What's this?
- What do you mean 'what's this'?

995
01:42:53,659 --> 01:42:56,694
- l expected something big?
- Big?

996
01:42:57,341 --> 01:42:59,644
Spend quality time together

997
01:43:01,215 --> 01:43:04,282
Nurses don't get permission
l came despite that, you know

998
01:43:04,832 --> 01:43:05,847
You could take off

999
01:43:06,144 --> 01:43:08,087
- What reason will l give?
- Tell some lies!!

1000
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:12,247
You were the one
who said love makes us lie!!

1001
01:43:43,665 --> 01:43:51,087
You moistened me from head to toe
Without warning you awakened me to glow

1002
01:43:51,188 --> 01:43:57,420
You made my heart
fly out of reach

1003
01:43:59,095 --> 01:44:05,427
More or less you made me dissolve
Putting up your price you made me revolve

1004
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:09,908
- l'll hug you when we are married
- You do that, but l'll hug you now

1005
01:44:14,366 --> 01:44:18,230
You dinned into me with knack
that our love is on the right track

1006
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:22,461
Oh! My heart goes lub-dub...lub-dub
in its song and speech!

1007
01:45:09,589 --> 01:45:17,263
lnto my eyes, one day,
you entered as a seed

1008
01:45:17,368 --> 01:45:24,977
ln front of my eyes, within my heart
you blossomed into a tree indeed

1009
01:45:25,084 --> 01:45:32,856
What's the next inventory?
Heart will replay our love-story

1010
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,703
Love peeps hesitantly
like a kitten wide eyed

1011
01:45:36,801 --> 01:45:40,283
...knocks fear, ignorance and shyness aside

1012
01:45:40,387 --> 01:45:46,718
Love sees...surveys
Finally surrenders!

1013
01:45:54,633 --> 01:45:56,194
Manimekalai, come here

1014
01:45:57,354 --> 01:46:00,006
Didn't l tell you someone keeps waving to me?
Come and take a look for yourself

1015
01:46:03,053 --> 01:46:05,028
Oh Gawd! Her mom's coming!

1016
01:46:05,261 --> 01:46:08,230
He isn't waving at you
He thinks it's me

1017
01:46:10,224 --> 01:46:11,785
Yeah, we love each other

1018
01:46:14,545 --> 01:46:15,276
Come home

1019
01:46:15,378 --> 01:46:16,688
- l want you to come home
- l won't

1020
01:46:16,786 --> 01:46:18,281
l am afraid of your father

1021
01:46:18,963 --> 01:46:19,760
Get lost

1022
01:46:20,756 --> 01:46:27,731
Oh God, who molded men
with hearts of wax

1023
01:46:28,343 --> 01:46:35,536
...one glimpse at a female
male hearts melted to relax

1024
01:46:36,026 --> 01:46:43,929
This golden silence
l love in every sense

1025
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:51,420
Your words and breath captivated me so
Memories you left behind ignited me to glow

1026
01:46:51,521 --> 01:46:55,713
Memorizes...memorializes
to success it panders!

1027
01:46:55,811 --> 01:46:58,146
Call your dad and
tell him about our love

1028
01:46:58,244 --> 01:47:00,449
- l'll call him tonight
- Call right now

1029
01:47:00,549 --> 01:47:02,175
l don't have enough balance
in my mobile to make a call

1030
01:47:03,238 --> 01:47:09,187
You made my heart
fly out of reach

1031
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:18,534
We are all for it

1032
01:47:20,205 --> 01:47:22,727
- Okay?
- They approved of us

1033
01:47:24,367 --> 01:47:27,751
Everyone's approved of me at home, right?
Why do you want me to go to Arasur?

1034
01:47:27,857 --> 01:47:30,608
Ask them to come and see the bride formally
We can go there after our wedding

1035
01:47:31,218 --> 01:47:33,423
lf l take you after our wedding,

1036
01:47:33,523 --> 01:47:36,786
...everyone will say
'Kadiresan has a beautiful bride'!

1037
01:47:36,884 --> 01:47:38,576
But if l take you now they'll say

1038
01:47:38,678 --> 01:47:40,980
'Kadiresan's got a hot looking chick'!!
That's why

1039
01:47:41,078 --> 01:47:44,428
So you need that 'superfigure' adjective!

1040
01:47:46,265 --> 01:47:47,509
Okay, we'll go

1041
01:47:50,363 --> 01:47:54,620
- Won't you ever get angry with me?
- Never

1042
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,985
- Even if l do something wrong?
- No, not even then

1043
01:47:57,213 --> 01:48:01,274
Why? Why won't you be angry?
You should get angry if l am wrong

1044
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:07,673
Otherwise 10 years later you'll say
'have l ever got mad at you'?!

1045
01:48:07,778 --> 01:48:10,048
Manimekalai won't fall for all this!

1046
01:48:10,147 --> 01:48:12,220
lf l do something wrong, l wont,

1047
01:48:12,324 --> 01:48:16,319
...but if l do, then get mad at me
Let's yell, fight and forget

1048
01:48:16,421 --> 01:48:17,851
Understood?

1049
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:21,440
Get angry
Get mad at me

1050
01:48:25,609 --> 01:48:27,552
- lt's not happening
- Get lost

1051
01:48:27,658 --> 01:48:29,994
Wait
1 minute

1052
01:48:30,092 --> 01:48:31,270
l'll try to get angry

1053
01:48:33,965 --> 01:48:36,038
- l'm not able to
- Useless!

1054
01:48:37,742 --> 01:48:42,633
Listen to me
l'll get angry now

1055
01:48:43,825 --> 01:48:49,294
However short tempered you are
is this how you treat a woman?!

1056
01:48:49,396 --> 01:48:52,812
When will you women learn
not to be subjugated by men?

1057
01:48:52,917 --> 01:48:57,327
You'll never reform
When will our country change?

1058
01:48:57,431 --> 01:49:01,688
- l didn't realize l'd pushed you so hard...
- This is how you should get angry!

1059
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:03,412
l'll be ready and
waiting for you at home

1060
01:49:03,513 --> 01:49:05,401
- Come and meet my parents
- Your home?

1061
01:49:05,498 --> 01:49:08,020
- l'll meet you at the bus stand
- Come home and pick me up

1062
01:49:08,123 --> 01:49:10,907
- l'll wait in the bus stand
- Come home

1063
01:49:12,221 --> 01:49:15,157
Who's getting down in Arasur?

1064
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,190
Who's getting down in Arasur?

1065
01:49:21,569 --> 01:49:25,116
Manivel's son!
My son is bringing our car to Vizhupuram

1066
01:49:25,219 --> 01:49:26,780
l'll drop you at home
Don't get down

1067
01:49:29,765 --> 01:49:32,035
Conductor! You don't have to
change your rules for us

1068
01:49:32,134 --> 01:49:34,207
You can stop in Vizhupuram
We have our carto pick us up

1069
01:49:34,311 --> 01:49:35,293
As if l care!

1070
01:49:38,344 --> 01:49:39,686
ls this your place?

1071
01:49:39,785 --> 01:49:43,878
Down this road is a banyan tree
Past that is home

1072
01:49:48,557 --> 01:49:50,729
Granny, phone's ringing

1073
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:53,733
No complaints have l, my Lord invincible

1074
01:49:53,871 --> 01:49:57,036
No regrets whatsoever,
Lord invisible Krishna

1075

- Have we reached Vizhupuram?
- We just went past

1084
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:00,131
Missed it?

1085
01:51:05,102 --> 01:51:06,990
- Stop the bus, sir
- Why?

1086
01:51:07,087 --> 01:51:09,389

1087
01:51:09,487 --> 01:51:12,750
How will you get another bus now?

Your sister had shifted her house

1118
01:57:26,545 --> 01:57:29,863

Can't bearthis pain

1125
01:59:46,734 --> 01:59:47,716
Don't cry

1126
01:59:48,270 --> 01:59:52,811
The guy with me

01:59:52,944 --> 01:59:54,952
Don't worry
Nothing will happen

1128

Hello Manimekalai,

02:00:33,697 --> 02:00:37,211
There was an accident on the way

1136
02:00:37,347 --> 02:00:41,243
Oh my God! Accident?

1137
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:42,625

- You can't see your mom now, honey
- l will see

1142
02:01:21,686 --> 02:01:23,956
Do you know who this girl is?

Home town Kulithurai

1144

Kadiresa...get up
How could you leave me and go?

What will l do?

1147

She is very serious
Doctor's orders not to let anyone in

1148
02:03:39,089 --> 02:03:41,032
Please go out

1149
02:03:44,403 --> 02:03:47,754
He'd have got down earlier
l am to blame!

1150
02:03:49,173 --> 02:03:53,430
Don't cry
Did we anticipate an accident?!

1151
02:03:53,687 --> 02:03:55,248
Why should this accident happen?

1152
02:03:55,576 --> 02:03:58,741
What wrong did he do?
ls it an age to die?

1153
02:03:59,001 --> 02:04:04,022
l can never find another man like him
There's only one Kadiresan, sir!

1154
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:13,949
Where's the doctor's room?

1155
02:04:14,624 --> 02:04:15,835
Take them to ward #7

1156
02:04:16,833 --> 02:04:19,703
- l am a nurse in KMC, Trichy
- Sit down

1157
02:04:20,418 --> 02:04:23,900
ln the accident here...Kadiresan

1158
02:04:26,757 --> 02:04:30,883
He has donated his organs
He and l together...

1159
02:04:33,128 --> 02:04:37,188
He's a good man
He shouldn't have died

1160
02:04:40,972 --> 02:04:42,630
Did you take treatment, first?

1161
02:04:43,084 --> 02:04:46,981
At least his heart, eyes
and kidney should be used

1162
02:04:47,245 --> 02:04:50,116
Take whatever you can

1163
02:04:54,993 --> 02:04:57,645
When he's here
our Amudha must be safe

1164
02:04:58,483 --> 02:05:02,991
- Didn't she come to see you?
- She's fine, isn't she?

1165
02:05:03,605 --> 02:05:04,718
Where is she?

1166
02:05:04,982 --> 02:05:08,049
l'd have never sent her
if l knew this would happen

1167
02:05:17,178 --> 02:05:22,265
Why are you all disturbing the patient?
Don't cry, come out

1168
02:05:24,606 --> 02:05:29,528
Out...fast

1169
02:05:35,234 --> 02:05:37,504
Let him go in and see

1170
02:05:38,244 --> 02:05:40,896
Make sure you don't disturb her
Come out soon

1171
02:05:52,906 --> 02:05:54,433
Can you hear me?

1172
02:05:57,388 --> 02:06:01,252

l didn't know l loved you
when you were with me

1175
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:17,235
Only after you left me...

1176
02:06:17,653 --> 02:06:20,687
This 6 months at least 50 times
l'd have come to

1177
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:23,027
...Koyambedu bus stand
thinking you'd come

1178
02:06:24,055 --> 02:06:31,030
How many days l've roamed
in #15B and #37G?!

1179
02:06:32,731 --> 02:06:37,971
Amudha and Trichy
That's all l knew about you

1180
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:50,328
l knew you'd come in search of me
But...

1181
02:06:52,003 --> 02:06:53,345
...not like this

1182
02:06:57,542 --> 02:07:00,445
Don't disturb her
Come out

1183
02:07:20,815 --> 02:07:25,192
What's your name?

1184
02:07:31,412 --> 02:07:32,460
Gautham

1185
02:07:32,692 --> 02:07:34,548
Gautham?

1186
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:55,699
You left me, Kadiresa

1187
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:25,674
Life got wrecked

1188
02:08:26,668 --> 02:08:28,556
Lifeless body...shattered

1189
02:08:28,652 --> 02:08:31,239
How we brought you up
with so much love!

1190
02:08:31,598 --> 02:08:34,763
You left us alone to suffer

1191
02:08:42,258 --> 02:08:45,740
Bonds broken...dust to dust

1192
02:08:46,132 --> 02:08:50,868
Heart forgets love and trust

1193
02:08:58,010 --> 02:09:09,209
No one can destroy death
...our last breath

1194
02:09:11,743 --> 02:09:26,305
Neither are we God
to conquer death

1195
02:09:26,918 --> 02:09:29,341
ls this form to register our marriage?

1196
02:09:31,879 --> 02:09:34,117
l'll hug you when we are married

1197
02:09:39,115 --> 02:09:42,050
Why aren't you even rejoicing
that l'm coming home to see you?

1198
02:09:42,189 --> 02:09:45,037
Shall l arrange a band and
fanfare to receive you?

1199
02:09:47,887 --> 02:09:51,434
Our body is a home
with 9 ways to enter

1200
02:09:51,537 --> 02:09:57,802
Then, a ground that only
God can administer!

1201
02:09:59,987 --> 02:10:04,364
Lives got crushed

1202
02:10:11,129 --> 02:10:13,169
Dude, we should never drive after drinking

1203
02:10:13,914 --> 02:10:17,232
Do you listen, if l ask you not to drive
at breakneck speed, with kids by your side?

1204
02:10:17,371 --> 02:10:20,154
Gopal, if you feel sleepy
stop for a while by the road side

1205
02:10:21,116 --> 02:10:23,452
Bro, don't talk over the phone while driving

1206
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,816
Dad, don't drive fast
l'm scared

1207
02:10:31,823 --> 02:10:38,107
