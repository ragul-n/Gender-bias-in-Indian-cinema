1
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,022
' Mytruth is that I
don' t have any truth.'

2
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,857
' I have so many names.'

3
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,291
' So many faces.'

4
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,198
' I speak Iies.'

5
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,365
' I hide faces behind faces.'

6
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,371
' I work for the
Intelligence department.'

7
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,975
' At  times, willingly.
At  times, unwillingly.'

8
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,079
' People call me an informer.'

9
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,373
It' s me, calling
from the battlefield.

10
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,743
Countless of our men
have become martys.

11
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:09,785
Satan wants to capture our
land and shed our blood.

12
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,131
He wants to erase our identity.

13
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,723
It' s wrong.

14
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,100
It' s wrong that a thought
captures the entire world.

15
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,736
And tries to kill everybody.

16
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:27,144
We will take our war to every
country, every city, every street.

17
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,680
Enemy is hiding everywhere.

18
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,412
We have to annihilate him.

19
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:39,423
Either he will die or our last
soldier.. will die fighting.

20
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:44,061
We are fighting not for our
own self but for our children.

21
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,423
For our truth and to
keep our world chaste.

22
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,693
A new method of war has started.

23
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,165
Which the world has
never seen.. or imagined.

24
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,275
Do you accept our mission?
- Yes, sir.

25
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,716
I am not afraid of
any army in the world.

26
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,380
I am just afraid of informers.

27
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,450
Because they get close
to us as our friend.

28
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,294
And they break us from within.

29
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,467
If possible, be alert from them.

30
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,838
' I have adorned my life like this.'

31
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:40,241
' I have adorned my life like this.'

32
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,412
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

33
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,787
' The lines of fate stopped midway.'

34
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,795
' Destination came to a standstill
with the sound of footsteps.'

35
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,100
' I erased the desires of kin.'

36
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,831
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

37
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,114
Goddess, Your son
pleads for Your shelter.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,283
Accept his offering.

39
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,513
And fulfill his desire.

40
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:30,225
On unfamiliar paths.

41
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,872
I can' t understand anything..

42
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,490
Carefully!
Carefully! Slowly! Slowly!

43
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,824
Move!

44
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,024
Here! Hold this!

45
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,828
Come inside. Come.

46
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,436
Sir, please get in.

47
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:16,906
Hurry up!

48
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,251
Come on! Come on! Raigard!

49
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,931
Yes!

50
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,062
We have found Mahendra Thappa, sir.

51
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,398
We have him on our sight.

52
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,466
A big fish.

53
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,334
Morning, sir. - Morning!

54
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,469
Good morning, sir!

55
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,603
Show me!

56
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,078
Sir, he is Mahendra Thappa! Nepali!

57
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,275
Six months ago, he crossed the
border and he entered lndia.

58
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,945
He is a very dangerous man, sir.

59
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,112
Wanted for 20 political murders.

60
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,949
Interpol has
declared red alert on him.

61
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,955
20 minutes ago we
received the news that..

62
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,961
..he is roaming around with a
Naxalite group in Andhra Pradesh.

63
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,963
In fact, right now,
we are going to him..

64
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,089
..with the aid of GPS tracker.

65
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,224
Show me.

66
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,584
Sir, we will have to launch a
surprise attack tonight itself.

67
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,980
We need your orders.

68
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,111
At tack and kill!

69
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,983
He will get neither a warning
nor a chance to save himself.

70
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,991
Sir, we can' t take a
chance with these people.

71
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,724
We won' t get such a chance again.

72
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,124
First, tell me, where did
you receive this news from?

73
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,321
Sir, SP intelligence Rathod.

74
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,163
Right now, he is on the spot.
He has sent this news.

75
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,530
Is any informer of the
lntelligence, a part of the group?

76
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,663
Sir, only Rathod has the
information about that.

77
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,229
Call Rathod. - Yes, sir.

78
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,366
From this cell.

79
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,670
Sir, your phone?
- Yes!

80
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,682
Hello. - Rathod!
This is Subramaniam.

81
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,412
Yes. Hello, sir. I was
waiting for your call.

82
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,011
Home Minister wants to
talk to you. - Give!

83
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,353
Hello! SP Rathod reporting, sir!

84
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,683
Is the news confirmed?

85
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,751
Yes, sir. Right now the
moving mark on GPS, is my man.

86
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,621
He has identified the target.

87
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,756
I am giving the order
of a surprise attack.

88
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,392
Surprise attack!

89
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,231
Tell him to clear
the area immediately.

90
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,198
But sir, there is no
means to warn him.

91
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,771
Doesn' t he have a cell?

92
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,035
Sir, they don' t
allow him to keep one.

93
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,446
If they find any such thing then
they kill the person on the spot.

94
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,478
Can our commando recognise him?

95
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,777
No, sir.

96
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,111
What did you say his name is?

97
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,483
I didn' t give you his name, sir.

98
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,187
If you didn' t tell me
then he too will be killed!

99
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,320
I am sorry!

100
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,454
Sir! Sir, one minute!

101
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,055
Sir, don' t disconnect! Please!

102
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,664
Sir, I have a request! - Yes!

103
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,402
At  the time of attack, I want the
permission to remain on the spot.

104
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,732
Granted!

105
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,070
Thank you, sir!

106
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,805
Sir.. is this your personal number?

107
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,809
Can I save this number?

108
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,482
First, save your informer.

109
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,815
Interesting fellow!
Rathod! I would like to meet him.

110
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,316
Yes, sir!

111
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,344
Stop!

112
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,348
Frisk them!

113
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,184
Bend!

114
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,129
An outside leader
has come. That' s why.

115
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,856
Found a policeman in the afternoon.

116
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,123
There were two more.
But they ran way.

117
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,260
What is in this?

118
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,561
Get up!

119
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,136
Hold this!

120
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,574
1 km from here. 607 metre. Got it?

121
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,276
607 metre. - Yes, sir.

122
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,172
Rathod! SP lntel!

123
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,236
Captain Dorjee! Special
Task Force! Grey Hounds.

124
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,175
And he is Captain Veer Singh.

125
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,609
For the past one hour, their
position has not changed. Why?

126
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,916
They have put up the camp.

127
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,864
Where is the wood? - There.

128
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,197
Go and get it.

129
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,262
No, you get it.

130
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,474
Comrade! Get up!

131
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,615
What' s the duty of a true soldier?

132
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,283
To fight unto death, comrade.

133
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,625
To fight till you die!

134
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,976
Go to sleep. - You sleep.

135
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,263
Sir, camera has been installed.

136
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:18,995
Switch it on.

137
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,775
Clear the path and
go back! Over and out!

138
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,420
Prepare for alpha.

139
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,021
Alpha! Combat position!

140
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,797
Your man is with them too.

141
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,639
That' s why he has come. To save him.

142
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,315
Is somebody else in the jeep?

143
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,955
Sit!

144
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
He has worn clothes
like them. Who is he?

145
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,330
Some extremist.

146
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,567
Must be a rapist or a serial killer.

147
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,067
He must have brought
him from the lockup.

148
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,335
When their people
will do the body count..

149
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,904
..then the number should match.

150
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,407
Oh!

151
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,543
What' s the next plan?

152
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,044
Everything is in position.

153
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,384
The firing will start as
soon as I give the order.

154
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,513
I have a request.

155
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,924
First, kill this
guard using the silencer.

156
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,453
Then stop the firing
for seven seconds.

157
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,964
Seven seconds is too long.
They will start firing.

158
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,793
Okay. Five seconds.

159
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,132
Not a moment more than three.

160
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,668
He is the one!

161
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,055
No!

162
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,492
Hold on!

163
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,862
No! No!

164
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,833
No!
- No!

165
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:10,960
Don' t shoot him!

166
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,162
No!
- No!

167
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,829
No!

168
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,642
No! - Don' t shoot him!

169
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,681
No! No!

170
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,913
No! No!

171
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,262
Sorry, sir! - lts okay!

172
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,556
Captain Dorjee! Thanks!

173
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,262
Let' s meet over a drink sometime.

174
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,595
You are welcome.

175
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,287
' Unknown life. Unfamiliar paths.'

176
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:13,594
' The distances walk together.'

177
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,969
' The desire to live..
made me an informer.'

178
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:24,068
' The desire to live..
made me an informer.'

179
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,071
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

180
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,311
' I have adorned my life like this.'

181
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,085
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

182
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,247
What happened, dear?

183
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,458
We have just received
the news that dangerous..

184
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,626
..was killed by Grey
Hound' s commandos in an attack.

185
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,459
Interpol had declared
red corner notice against..

186
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,528
..Mahendra Thappa, aged 34.

187
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,471
And he is a dangerous arms expert.

188
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,472
We received Mahendra
Thappa' s correct..

189
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,944
..whereabouts in lndia,
a short while ago.

190
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,544
Sir!

191
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,613
Home Minister' s post is miles
away from the reality of the field.

192
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,753
That' s why I wish to know.

193
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,821
Relax.

194
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,564
No need to reveal the name.

195
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,495
I just want to know
what kind of a man is he..

196
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,905
..to play with his life,
again and again.

197
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,538
He is not a man. He is a boy, sir.

198
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,171
Aged 1 9 years old.

199
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:40,241
I see! You make
children do such things?

200
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,024
This is the story of all the
informers in the world, sir.

201
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,519
His parents died in
a train accident..

202
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,255
..when he was 12 years old.

203
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,788
He didn' t gel with his relatives.
He ran away.

204
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,528
He came on the street.

205
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,527
At  the age of 18, he
was caught in a roundup.

206
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,267
As such, the boy was innocent, sir.

207
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,276
I did what every
intelligence officer does.

208
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,215
' You will be in
prison for six years.'

209
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,280
' When you will be released, you
won' t be able to recognise yourself.'

210
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,083
' I didn' t do anything.
I didn' t do anything.'

211
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,288
' There is one way.'

212
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:29,591
' You will escape the sentence
and you will earn some money too.'

213
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,729
Do they work for money?

214
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,570
When the world is harsh with a kid..

215
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,582
..though he is innocent,
then to prove himself right..

216
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,245
..that kid is ready to do anything.

217
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,913
Money is just an excuse, sir.

218
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,021
To support their existence.

219
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,658
I opened it.

220
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,327
Fine. Now try to open this.

221
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,668
That was a 3 lever.
Not with the key.

222
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,165
With the wire.

223
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,006
My heart searches.

224
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,604
My heart searches.

225
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,740
Come on! Come on!

226
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,011
Since ages.

227
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,814
Since ages.

228
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,879
On unfamiliar.

229
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,891
On unfamiliar.

230
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,826
Paths!

231
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,292
My heart searches.

232
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,300
My heart searches.

233
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,166
Since ages.

234
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,229
Since ages.

235
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,174
On unfamiliar.

236
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,301
On unfamiliar.

237
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,639
Good! Fire!

238
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,373
He is an ordinary
man like you and me.

239
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,173
He has many desires.

240
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,184
The only difference is
that we don' t see death.

241
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,811
And he sees it everyday.

242
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,650
And..

243
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,983
Shall I leave, sir?

244
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,993
You want to say something else too.

245
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,664
Sir, the informer doesn' t
face danger from his enemy.

246
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,665
Then?

247
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,701
The intelligence department.

248
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:21,404
You mean to say our
men kill them. Why?

249
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:29,181
Already I have
revealed too much, sir.

250
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,153
I am going to retire
after a few months.

251
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:40,222
Please, sir. I want to spend
the rest of my life peacefully.

252
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,033
Hello.

253
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,702
Return after a week to Hyderabad.

254
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,836
To my house.

255
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,144
Anju!

256
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,465
How are you? - I am fine, aunt.

257
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,329
Sit.

258
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,074
Who is it? - Kailash has come.

259
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,802
Rahul!

260
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,804
Aunt! - Yes.

261
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,106
The tap at the back is leaking.

262
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,774
And there is no
bolt on the door too.

263
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,376
I will just repair it.

264
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,178
I will make your uncle
do all these chores.

265
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,752
You eat.

266
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,820
Aunt, he again saved my life.

267
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,223
How will I repay his favour..

268
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,258
Don' t be indebted
to policemen, dear.

269
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,863
They put you into trouble.
And then they only save you.

270
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,978
Ajay! - Yes.

271
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,510
Again you put
Kailash' s life in danger.

272
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,782
How many have died till now?

273
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,124
Eleven? Twelve?

274
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,296
Kailash shouldn' t die.

275
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,860
Promise me.

276
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,812
Uncle.. I want to leave this work.

277
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,339
What will you do?

278
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,814
What do you know besides this job?

279
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,219
I have money. How
much have I earned?

280
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,349
Around 4.5 lakhs.

281
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,485
That' s it? One and half years of
toil, facing so many dangers..

282
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,551
..and just 4.5 lakhs.

283
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,825
Uncle!

284
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,024
Money is distributed
amongst everyone..

285
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,225
..from the senior
level to the junior level.

286
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,562
You don' t worry. I won' t
send you back to the jungle.

287
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,568
At  least, earn 10 lakhs.

288
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,042
Then you can leave.
I won' t stop you.

289
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:12,575
Don' t change the lock.
Don' t stick the poster.

290
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,182
Don' t put up the rod.

291
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:18,189
Don' t bring your friends.
Don' t play music.

292
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,849
And don' t make a noise.

293
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,533
Oh! So the kids were right!

294
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,602
You study in class 10th?

295
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,005
You sit in the class with a beard?

296
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,041
I had to leave
studies for a few years.

297
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,304
So I have forgotten everything.

298
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,605
So, now it must be difficult.
You want tuitions?

299
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,950
No, I will do it by
myself in a few months.

300
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,116
I like that spirit. Roshni.

301
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,249
Kailash. - Bye.

302
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:03,357
I have nothing besides you.

303
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:08,072
My heart is crazy for you.

304
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,509
You don' t get the one you want.

305
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:17,172
I have found the world of dreams.

306
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,583
Beloved! Beloved!

307
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,256
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

308
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:31,660
I have nothing besides you.

309
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,957
My heart is crazy for you.

310
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,600
How long will you lie
to that innocent boy?

311
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,272
For so many years, you
didn' t even realise this.

312
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,669
In my world, truth and a
lie are like twin brothers.

313
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,106
Who is who? At  times even
parents can' t differentiate.

314
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,343
Again you are lying.

315
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:03,050
Why does my heart beat with you?

316
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:12,631
What love sways in my eyes?

317
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,436
The capricious bird of my heart.

318
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,702
Follows you.

319
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,137
Why does it suffer?

320
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,476
Why is it nervous of the beloved?

321
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,999
No! - Yes!

322
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,130
Sing like this!

323
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,474
Hey, come on!

324
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,739
Okay! Try this!

325
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,613
Wow! Great!

326
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,252
I met you and
everything became beautiful.

327
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,724
Brother Kailash, your
uncle has come to pick you up.

328
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,391
You go. I will just come. - Okay.

329
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,058
My uncle has come.

330
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,460
There is a wedding in his family.

331
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,099
I will return in a week.

332
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:54,797
Have faith.

333
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,806
' I could never belong to
my kin or to strangers.'

334
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:10,321
' I couldn' t fulfil
the desire of breath.'

335
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:11,447
Come on!

336
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:15,525
' Everybody forgot my existence.'

337
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,625
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

338
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,102
What do you do?

339
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,837
I? I open locks!

340
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,506
What' s your name? - Kailash.
And yours?

341
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,407
Vinayak Marathe.

342
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,381
' Your new name is Vinayak Marathe.'

343
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,452
' Your father' s name
Devi Prasad Marathe.'

344
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,785
' Hyderabad' s don
Mamu' s old shooter.'

345
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,623
Do you know? I am from Nagpur.

346
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,126
In Nagpur, you find
such beautiful girls.

347
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,523
Do come with me someday.

348
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,123
' You have to learn to talk,
walk and think like him.'

349
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,862
' You have to pick
up all his traits.'

350
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,261
' Very soon.'

351
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,135
And I have learnt how to shoot too.

352
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,699
Do you know how to open locks?

353
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,734
I will teach it to you.

354
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,141
I will open this in a jiffy.

355
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,477
' Remember, you won' t get much time.'

356
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,616
Come on! Get out!

357
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,149
Come on!

358
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,458
Come!

359
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,230
' I have adorned my life like this.'

360
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,203
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

361
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,336
Come on! Come on!

362
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,616
' The lines of fate stopped midway.'

363
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:50,913
' Destination came to a standstill
with the sound of footsteps.'

364
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:56,616
' I erased the desires of kin.'

365
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,221
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

366
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,625
If you want to console
yourself then listen.

367
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,397
He was in prison twice.

368
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,933
For the charge of raping
10-12 years old girls.

369
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,466
He was released.

370
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,944
The gang where I am
sending you, its boss is Mamu.

371
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,944
He looks like an old man.
But he is very smart.

372
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,651
And then Pasha and Biju.

373
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,317
You have to get close to Pasha.

374
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,227
Fool, are you
listening to me? - Yes.

375
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:40,235
If you pity him then you
will forget everything!

376
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,966
Then it will be your turn. Got it?

377
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,640
Drop him to Charminar. - Yes, sir.

378
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:52,281
I will wait for you at
different places thrice in a week.

379
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,246
Where is the paper?

380
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,245
Everything is
written in this. Read it.

381
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,250
And wear this.

382
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:03,353
Hail Hussein!

383
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,266
There is a prayer on my lips.

384
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,666
Please, appear before us.

385
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:16,935
The dawn of Mecca.
Please, appear before me.

386
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,602
There is a prayer on my lips.

387
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,340
Please, appear before us.

388
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,949
Who are you? Why have you come?

389
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,774
Vinayak Marathe from Nagpur.

390
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:29,811
Come! Come!

391
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,623
Hey, he is our man. - Okay.

392
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,292
Any cell phone? - No, nothing.

393
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,029
' Don' t take your cell along.'

394
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,628
' If they saw it, then they will
immediately slit your throat.'

395
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,309
Vinayak Marathe has come.
From Nagpur.

396
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,780
' The gang where I am
sending you, its boss is Mamu.'

397
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,915
' He looks like an old man.
But he is very smart.'

398
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,420
Greetings, sir. Uncle Mamu.

399
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,987
Call me Mamu. It' s sufficient.

400
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,824
Sit.

401
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,465
You were supposed to
come in the morning, right?

402
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,063
Why are you late?

403
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,829
I got late because of the rally.

404
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,337
Father has sent this for you.

405
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,430
The first bullet of your father.

406
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,766
He fired it 30 years ago.

407
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,700
Riots were going on near Charminar.

408
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,704
An insane man came to
kill me with a sword.

409
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,772
Your father fired.
And he saved my life.

410
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:11,782
Look.. the names of both
of us are written on it.

411
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,449
Is that so? - Yes.

412
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:20,620
You didn' t know what
this envelope contained?

413
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,502
' My father! He doesn' t do anything!'

414
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,130
' He just sits at home!
He doesn' t say anything!'

415
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,599
No, Mamu!

416
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,407
Give me your residential number.

417
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,145
071287654382.

418
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,955
Hello! - Devi!

419
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,422
Who? - How are you?

420
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,622
Mamu! I am fine!

421
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,029
You didn' t tell your son
what the envelope contained.

422
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,160
Envelop! I don' t think I told him.

423
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,168
Okay. Talk to your father.

424
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,775
Did you reach there? - Yes.

425
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,571
Did you reach there?

426
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,917
Yes.

427
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,182
If you act smart, Mamu
will teach you a lesson.

428
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,580
Give the phone to Mamu.

429
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,454
Yes, tell me.

430
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,461
Mamu, if he didn' t work properly..

431
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,053
..then remember our old formula.

432
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,469
Your father said, if
you don' t work properly..

433
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,940
..then to beat your
bare body with a stick.

434
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,469
Where are you going? Sit! Sit! Sit!

435
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,149
Do you play cards? - Yes.

436
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,946
Which game do you play? Rummy,
three cards game.

437
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,483
Anyone.

438
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,049
Do you have money?

439
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,550
Yes.

440
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,685
Take it out! Come on! Take it out!

441
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,492
Take out some more.

442
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,228
Yes.

443
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,914
Show.

444
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,588
But..

445
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,590
Do you have more money?

446
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,734
No. My pocket is empty.

447
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:41,001
Empty? Then go and learn the work.

448
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,976
Mamu, can I borrow 1 00 rupees?

449
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,269
Go! Show him the work!

450
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,549
You lost and you are
asking for a loan!

451
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,275
Come on!

452
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,282
Chhotu! - Yes, Mamu!

453
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,649
Introduce him to sister. - Okay.

454
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,662
Pasha!

455
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,943
A guy too.

456
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,979
You do it. I like it.

457
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,593
Pasha.. he..

458
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,160
Vinayak Marathe.

459
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,328
That Devi Prasad.

460
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,331
Our old shooter from Nagpur.

461
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,938
His son.

462
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,637
' You have to get close to Pasha.'

463
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,106
Greetings, brother Pasha.

464
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,944
What all things can you do?

465
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,345
I.. can open locks.

466
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,959
Go. Open that.

467
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,092
What else do you know?

468
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:46,123
I do small menial jobs.

469
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,795
You don' t know how to play cards?

470
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,830
I improved after playing with Mamu.

471
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:59,104
Don' t ever play with him.
He has marked all the cards.

472
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,669
He sends you home empty-handed.

473
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,675
He emptied my pocket
as soon as I came.

474
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,943
And you stole my heart.

475
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,678
Go. I will call you again.

476
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,122
I will just come.

477
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,060
Hey!

478
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,703
If you smile and
flirt with her again..

479
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,309
..then I will cut
your lips with a blade.

480
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,644
Why does Pasha always talk angrily?

481
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,122
I will narrate the
entire story in short.

482
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,117
Mamu' s son-in-law was beaten up..

483
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,127
..by the policemen in the lockup.

484
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,527
Because of that, Mamu
suffered a heart attack.

485
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:54,860
And he became weak.

486
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,731
Sister and Biju are looking
after the entire business.

487
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,132
And Mamu, he only plays cards.

488
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,603
Who is Biju? Mamu' s son?

489
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,807
He is Mamu' s mistress' s son.

490
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,667
His mother is a Muslim.
We are Hindus.

491
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,406
His mother can' t come here.

492
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,678
Biju doesn' t have any support.
That' s the problem.

493
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,677
But Pasha too is a Muslim.

494
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:20,485
Pasha is sister' s lover.
Mamu heeds sister.

495
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,684
Things are like this
since the beginning.

496
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,492
A couple of years ago,
Pasha was a shooter.

497
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:29,362
Now he rules over us.
That' s the problem.

498
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,893
Clean it quickly.

499
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,902
Today is a big day.

500
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,569
The planning has been
going on for many days.

501
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,769
The car has left from home.

502
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,437
It will reach there in ten minutes.

503
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,568
Okay.

504
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:46,172
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.

505
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,242
Car' s number.

506
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,449
My number is 1.
Yusuf, you are number 2.

507
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,721
Go from the left side. First,
kill the gunman.

508
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,785
Then kill the driver from the front.

509
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,457
Raza. - Yes.

510
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,196
You are number 3. - Okay.

511
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,592
Come from the left and
kill the minister. - Okay.

512
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,860
Empty all the six bullets.
Don' t worry. - Okay.

513
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,261
Shrikant. - Yes.

514
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:08,863
You are number 4.

515
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,599
Your target is
minister' s wife and daughter.

516
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,271
Vicky! Reddy! Chalan!

517
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,874
Show the pistol to the people.

518
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,745
Kill anybody who stops you.

519
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:28,216
Shekhar! Raju! Mastan!

520
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,356
Ride the auto
which Yusuf showed you.

521
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,758
1 1, 1 2.

522
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,230
Chhotu! Vinayak!

523
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,233
You people handle the public.

524
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,904
Who is watching! Who is not running!

525
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,239
If anybody clicks
photos from the cell phone..

526
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,299
..then immediately
point him out to me.

527
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,908
Five minutes still left.

528
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,979
Don' t make haste.

529
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,774
Everything will be done slowly.

530
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,254
The car has left the stadium.

531
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,321
Near the stadium. Two more minutes.

532
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,660
Pasha!

533
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,265
Tell me, beloved.

534
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,472
Did you give breakfast to Vinayak?

535
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,009
That poor guy must have come hungry.

536
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,274
Breakfast! I see!

537
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,339
I will just give it to him.

538
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,009
Feed him properly.

539
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,817
Shrikant! - Yes, brother.

540
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,760
You go on number 1 1.
- Okay, brother.

541
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,355
Number 4 is yours.

542
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:42,957
Number 4!

543
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,434
Wife! Daughter! Yours!

544
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:50,569
If you miss the aim,
then I will kill you.

545
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,304
On the spot.

546
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,796
' I will keep my heart pure, uncle.
I won' t kill anyone.'

547
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,335
' No matter what happens.'

548
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,615
' You will have to walk on fire.'

549
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:42,348
' But your feet
shouldn' t burn. Fire.'

550
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,439
O Goddess.

551
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:08,442
What happened?

552
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,577
I don' t know, sir.

553
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,120
Reverse the car! Hurry up! Hurry up!

554
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:12,847
Okay, sir!

555
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,981
Hurry up!

556
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,582
A car is behind, sir.
- Reverse the car! Hurry up!

557
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,717
What happened?

558
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,056
Hurry up!
- I am doing it, sir!

559
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,543
Come on!

560
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,411
Shoot! Shoot!

561
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,449
Hey, why couldn' t you shoot?

562
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:22,449
Maybe the revolver got stuck.

563
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,216
No, brother! Brother,
it' s not my mistake.

564
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,014
Brother, the revolver got stuck.
I did what you said.

565
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,822
Please! It' s not my mistake,
brother. Please.

566
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,035
Hey, Marathe!

567
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,639
Greetings! Biju!

568
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,980
Mamu' s step-son!

569
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:25,181
Don' t be afraid. Pasha
won' t be seen for a few days.

570
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,515
We have to keep the
police' s honour intact too.

571
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,517
So he left!

572
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,924
Mamu is bribing them. Look.

573
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,532
This is the custom of Hyderabad.

574
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:40,536
Here you do your work lovingly.

575
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,198
Mamu plays cards the whole day.

576
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,872
The business runs smoothly.

577
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,542
If anybody has any problem then..

578
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,546
..come to Mamu with money.

579
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,615
Meaning you will lose your money
and the problem will be solved.

580
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,882
Your language is so impure.

581
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,554
In Hyderabad, you
don' t talk like this.

582
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:01,750
So how do you talk here?

583
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,224
The problem is alleviated.

584
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,626
Nowadays, my luck is bad.

585
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,956
Why? What happened?

586
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,895
The police seized my
goods worth two crores.

587
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,570
Mamu scolded me so much.
Do you know?

588
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,632
What goods?

589
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,177
Our regular stuff. Cocaine,
marijuana.

590
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:24,037
I dealt with
cocaine worth 1 0 crores.

591
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,048
With God' s grace
they didn' t find it.

592
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,585
Otherwise, Mamu
would have beheaded me.

593
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:31,646
Didn' t you bribe the policemen?

594
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,053
I bribed all the policemen!

595
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,181
From the senior level
to the junior level.

596
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:38,126
But there is a new top
force at Maharashtra border.

597
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,121
Task force!

598
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:41,255
That' s what I said.

599
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:45,591
Task force! They seized the
goods and arrested the people.

600
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,665
Now I don' t even have men.

601
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,602
Brother, I am there. I
can do anything you say.

602
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,940
Wow! Fine! I will show
you something this evening!

603
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,006
Come! Come! Come!

604
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:02,750
I want to hide the goods
in 2-4 carriages like this.

605
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,619
Nobody should find out.

606
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,820
But brother Biju, why bullock-carts?

607
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,816
This is my new idea!

608
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,823
Look, for the bullock-carts,
you don' t need any documents.

609
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,291
You can cross the border
anytime by the unpaved road.

610
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,624
No policeman. No check point.

611
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,632
Make a small box for me.

612
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,100
Nobody should feel suspicious.

613
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,045
No box can be made here.
It' s futile to think.

614
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,640
Look here. We can keep it here.

615
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,313
You keep grass here for the hay.

616
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:38,846
If the buffalo put its mouth in it..

617
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:39,980
..then it will consume drugs.

618
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,649
And it will start flying in the sky.

619
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,920
So what else to do?

620
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,856
Hang on!

621
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,797
Brother Biju, it' s done.

622
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,665
Vinayak will make
such a box for you..

623
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,678
..that forget the police.. not even
a policeman' s father can find it.

624
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,008
So come on!

625
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,205
Get me the things. I
will begin right away.

626
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,683
Okay! Okay! Okay!

627
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,288
Here is your box. Almost ready.

628
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,700
Is this a box? Its
bullock-cart' s wood.

629
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,041
We will become rich!

630
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,977
My beloved is a gypsy man.

631
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,112
Your heart is gypsy.

632
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,442
My beloved is a gypsy man.

633
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,913
Your heart is gypsy.

634
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,978
Stop! Where are you all going?

635
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,450
We have to search the carts.

636
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:48,782
You people stand aside.

637
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,124
Search it. - Yes, sir.

638
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,786
Search it properly.

639
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,455
Bangle of your name.

640
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:55,789
Bangle of your name.

641
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:56,924
Listen! - Yes.

642
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,793
Become my partner. - What?

643
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,735
I trust you.

644
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,397
My youth is salacious.

645
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,468
My youth is salacious.

646
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:09,006
Your heart is gypsy.

647
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,137
Have a drag!

648
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,739
Look, brother. A
liquor vendor doesn' t drink.

649
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,215
But you can smoke.

650
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,418
It' s the sign of friendship.

651
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:19,421
When two people smoke then
their hearts unite, my friend.

652
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:20,814
What if I get intoxicated?

653
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,358
The girls are there. Come on.

654
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:30,897
In my house, at
the village square.

655
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,092
The cot makes a noise.

656
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,365
The cot inflames my body.

657
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,831
The dark nights.

658
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,773
The dark nights.

659
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,170
The dark nights.

660
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,305
The dark nights.

661
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,780
Where are you
taking me, brother Biju?

662
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:46,907
Vitamin pills!

663
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,042
Hi!

664
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,518
She is Mumtaz. And her friend.

665
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,120
Hey! Mumtaz! - Hi!

666
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,251
I am still young and single.

667
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,785
These girls belong to good families.

668
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,457
They are not call girls.
Do it in style.

669
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,794
What do you mean?

670
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,131
Violence won' t get you anything.

671
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:09,067
If you ask lovingly,
you get everything.

672
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,399
Got it?

673
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,465
Bangle of your name.

674
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,407
Bangle of your name.

675
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,810
Adorn me with it, gypsy man.

676
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,815
Adorn me with it, gypsy man.

677
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,287
Listen! Are you a transvestite?

678
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,823
Why, brother Biju?

679
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,820
That girl said
that the whole night..

680
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,297
..you people were just chatting.

681
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,567
She belongs to a
decent family. - So?

682
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:47,835
Girls from decent
family don' t like guys?

683
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,103
Brother Biju!

684
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,314
Here comes the ocean! Here it is!

685
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:01,848
Here it is!

686
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:18,407
Allah, shower Your grace.
And make me rich!

687
00:51:28,352 --> 00:51:30,411
My youth is salacious.

688
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,889
My youth is salacious.

689
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,619
Your heart is gypsy.

690
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,970
I have heard that you
people had great fun.

691
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:55,909
Come. Sit.

692
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,239
Sit!

693
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,934
Show. Show me the cards.

694
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,144
Enough, Mamu! Enough!

695
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:40,417
Take it! Fill your pockets.
I am giving you money.

696
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,349
Enough, Mamu! Enough!

697
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,554
It' s enough! Not my
pocket but my heart was empty!

698
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,153
And everybody' s love has filled it.

699
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:48,557
What else do I want?

700
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,254
What' s going on there?

701
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,658
I am just whiling away my time.

702
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,189
You are not doing anything?

703
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,133
Not much, uncle.

704
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,392
Met Pasha?

705
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:30,600
Who? Yes, he! I met him yesterday.

706
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,338
Top level criminals
come to meet Pasha.

707
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:43,075
He is the most important man.

708
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,619
Nobody knows his real name.

709
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,282
His code name is Saaya.

710
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,288
Interpol has declared a
reward of 1 crore on him.

711
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,030
And he is his deputy. Mustafa.

712
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:00,025
Not just that. ClA, too,
is searching for them.

713
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,504
You will earn money from them too.

714
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,631
In dollars.

715
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,394
Whom are you working with?

716
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:31,792
Biju?

717
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,127
Yes.

718
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,536
In his drugs business.

719
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:38,732
Yes.

720
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,133
Tell me about him.

721
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,068
I have heard, he again
started his business.

722
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,076
Is that so? I don' t know.

723
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,083
You went to him!

724
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,682
How did he hide the goods?

725
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:16,705
Today, it' s my treat. I
have got a part-time job.

726
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,771
O great! Congrats!

727
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,782
Cheers!
- Cheers!

728
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,454
Let' s go to watch a
film tonight. - Okay.

729
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,183
Which one do you want to watch?

730
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,788
Anything. Which good
film is being shown?

731
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,789
You tell me.

732
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,858
Have your sandwich.

733
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,409
So, say something.

734
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,207
You say something.

735
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,278
What is it? What are you
doing here? What happened?

736
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,685
You entice girls from good families.

737
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,746
Inspector, talk respectfully! I
am talking to you respectfully.

738
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:01,882
Leave me! - What are you doing?

739
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,216
Leave me! - Madam, you don' t know!

740
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,624
Leave me! - We have
his four years record.

741
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,161
He is lying! What record?
He is lying!

742
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,287
I am lying!

743
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,301
Leave from here! I
know everything about him!

744
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,168
You know everything? - Yes!

745
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,838
And I have come here willingly.

746
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,766
Let' s go!

747
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,647
He is lying. He lied. I..

748
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,713
Roshni, I didn' t do anything..
- Don' t say anything.

749
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:39,190
I know. You can' t be what these
people are claiming you to be.

750
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,530
But you are also not
what you say you are.

751
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,194
I don' t know what to think of you.

752
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,540
Roshni, listen to me. I.. - Please.

753
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:54,935
Our friendship..

754
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:02,412
Our friendship..
Iet' s leave it here.

755
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:04,544
Roshni!

756
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,751
My heart searches.

757
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,232
Since ages.

758
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:27,232
On unfamiliar paths.

759
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,807
Got it, partner?
Don' t take it seriously.

760
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,938
What do you mean?

761
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,108
Be like a man!

762
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,674
You too, brother Biju.

763
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,348
Mumtaz! Meenu!

764
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,614
Come on!

765
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,349
Listen..

766
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,357
Carefully, brother Biju.

767
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,321
Brother Biju! Brother Biju,
what happened?

768
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,090
Blood?

769
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:53,827
Uncle!

770
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,207
Vinayak! Are you..

771
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,705
Who are you?

772
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,220
Vinayak, who are you?

773
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,821
Uncle, please! Please!

774
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,239
' I could never belong to
my kin or to strangers.'

775
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,138
' I couldn' t fulfil
the desire of breath.'

776
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:42,010
' Everybody forgot my existence.'

777
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,754
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

778
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,317
' I know you are risking your life.'

779
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,423
' But I promise you that this
will be your last assignment.'

780
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:57,762
' Henceforth, you won' t
have to work as an informer.'

781
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,338
Vinayak! Get up!

782
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,098
Carefully!

783
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,768
Here.

784
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,439
Forgive me.

785
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,718
So many times you say this.

786
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,789
This is normal in this business.

787
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,451
What' s your mistake?

788
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,323
You too could have died.

789
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:29,990
How is he?

790
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,227
Show me!

791
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,864
' Mustafa comes to meet Pasha.'

792
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,432
' You help us nab Mustafa.
And your work is over.'

793
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,135
The angle was wrong.

794
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,804
Otherwise you too
would have died with Biju.

795
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:49,344
Enough of pampering.

796
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,485
Come on! Go outside.

797
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:53,380
Vinayak!

798
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:58,058
Why did you tell him to
go out? He needs rest!

799
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:03,094
If you want a child, I will
give you one within nine months.

800
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,360
Got it?

801
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,898
Is that so? Give me one!

802
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,497
You are acting too smart!

803
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,504
All because of this Vinayak!

804
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,312
I feel like slitting your throat.

805
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,513
But actually you are lucky for me.

806
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,519
5 crores profit in drugs.

807
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,185
Then Biju died.

808
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:33,854
Two jackpots.

809
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,490
Because of you.

810
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,933
No, brother. I didn' t do anything.

811
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:43,333
No, brother. I didn' t do anything.
Why are you talking like a girl!

812
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,875
What' s your age? - Around 20-21.

813
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,076
Still a kid!

814
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,115
Brother, I am not a kid. I am a man.

815
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,050
You are a man!

816
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,992
So talk, see and do
things like a man.

817
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:09,322
Here.

818
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,230
Go and wash that car!

819
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,185
Pasha! - How are you?

820
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,384
I am fine!

821
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,587
What are you looking at?

822
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,358
This is not a tourist place.
Go and do your work.

823
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,093
' In lndia, humans
are not appreciated.'

824
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,464
' Life is of no value.'

825
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:51,873
' Whenever there is a
flood or an earthquake..

826
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,602
..then people shatter.'

827
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,537
' They become homeless.
They disappear.'

828
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:59,210
' Poor people sell their daughters.'

829
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,950
' Farmers are even ready
to sell their own self.'

830
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,421
' They are in high demand
in foreign countries.'

831
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:10,084
' A young boy aged 19 is
bought for 20000-25000.'

832
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,887
' By chopping their bodies
and selling their parts..

833
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,452
..you get 1 crore.'

834
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:18,899
' lt' s easy to nab Pasha.'

835
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:21,300
' So I am searching for
the dangerous goons.'

836
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,904
' Like Mustafa.'

837
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:26,035
' By nabbing him, this
business can be stopped.'

838
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,274
Closing your eyes
won' t do! Understand?

839
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,478
What is that?

840
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,612
It' s called endoscope.

841
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:43,921
And that is a camera. To
click photos inside the stomach.

842
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,085
With a small computer.

843
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,553
I see!

844
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:57,302
Come! Come! Brother Mustafa!
- Brother Pasha!

845
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:58,670
You don' t miss me.

846
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,067
Shall I rip my heart apart
and show you? - You too!

847
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,337
Come!

848
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,347
Kasim! The boxes will reach
the ship in one or two hours.

849
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,009
Quickly load it in the chopper.

850
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,578
' And he is his deputy. Mustafa.'

851
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,490
' Not just that. ClA too
is searching for them.'

852
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:04,733
Nothing..

853
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:12,672
Here comes the message.

854
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:44,102
Nothing..

855
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,251
Mr. Rehman, greetings.

856
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:54,585
Greetings. What are you
sending in the parcel?

857
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:55,783
I am hungry.

858
01:04:55,858 --> 01:05:00,454
One dish of chicken. And
bread along with it too.

859
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,588
Great!

860
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,794
Sir doesn' t know.
The food is for free.

861
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,668
But the bearer
should receive some tip.

862
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,798
Surely.

863
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,301
Thanks, brother Pasha!

864
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,434
Greetings!

865
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,068
Thanks, sir. - Greetings!

866
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,806
Come on!

867
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,712
Hurry up! Hurry up!

868
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,414
You did your work correctly. Great!

869
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,761
I didn' t do anything,
brother. You did everything.

870
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,792
Whoever did it.. its good.

871
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:47,333
If you work like this..
then you will become rich.

872
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:50,236
Thanks, brother.

873
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,578
Here. - I don' t drink.

874
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,348
Have a drink today.

875
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,249
Here.

876
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:15,762
Oh no!

877
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,150
Turn around, my dish of chicken!

878
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,822
Goodnight.

879
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:44,791
Goodbye.

880
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,767
' I have adorned my life like this.'

881
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:54,607
' Every time I donned a new mask.'

882
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:05,143
Hello!

883
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,278
Zero Charlie! - Yes, Charlie!

884
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:07,616
There' s a special
information for you.

885
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:08,747
Write it down!

886
01:07:11,726 --> 01:07:14,627
We have just
received news from Mumbai..

887
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:16,630
..boxes filled with human organs..

888
01:07:16,698 --> 01:07:18,632
..were found at the
shores of the sea!

889
01:07:18,767 --> 01:07:21,292
These human organs
were filled in 20 boxes.

890
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:23,633
And it is believed that it
was being sent to Europe..

891
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:24,763
..and Arab countries as a part of..

892
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:28,036
..international human
organ trafficking!

893
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:31,636
Right now, you can see
pictures of Mustafa..

894
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:32,839
..who was killed in this encounter.

895
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:33,972
Hello!

896
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:35,377
Ghorpade! - Yes.

897
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,049
This has happened because
of two of your officials!

898
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:38,378
Rehman and Rathod!

899
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,117
But we don' t want them.

900
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:41,779
We want their informers.

901
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:44,286
It is important to avenge
brother Mustafa' s death.

902
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:45,785
You will be rewarded handsomely.

903
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,258
Hello!

904
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:56,326
Rathod! I.G,
lntelligence, Ghorpade speaking.

905
01:07:56,671 --> 01:07:58,798
Yes sir.

906
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:01,905
Mustafa' s killing has
put everyone under shock.

907
01:08:02,243 --> 01:08:04,734
You mean the underworld. - Us too.

908
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:07,907
Mustafa' s brother is a
very influential don in Egypt.

909
01:08:08,716 --> 01:08:10,149
There is a lot of pressure on us.

910
01:08:10,285 --> 01:08:11,411
What pressure, sir?

911
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:15,951
They feel, Mustafa was killed
because of one of our informers!

912
01:08:16,391 --> 01:08:17,790
Hello! Hello, Rathod!

913
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:19,826
Hello! Hello! - Yes, sir.

914
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:22,428
Sir, I don' t know anything about it.

915
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:25,727
Do you know the SP of
lntelligence of Mumbai, Rehman?

916
01:08:26,134 --> 01:08:27,726
I do know him, sir.

917
01:08:28,136 --> 01:08:30,229
Someone told him about Mustafa.

918
01:08:32,874 --> 01:08:37,743
Then.. it will be better if
you ask him about Rehman sir.

919
01:08:37,946 --> 01:08:39,072
He won' t tell!

920
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:42,875
And anyway, Rehman
just got the information!

921
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:45,942
And not the name of the informer.

922
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,724
What can I do, sir?

923
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:53,753
I want the name, Rathod.

924
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:56,391
The name of one person.

925
01:08:56,798 --> 01:08:57,856
That' s it!

926
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:01,869
I don' t have any such name, sir.

927
01:09:03,204 --> 01:09:04,466
They are offering 20 lakhs.

928
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:05,797
Think about it.

929
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:07,765
I will call you
again in the evening.

930
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:10,835
Oh no!

931
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:15,482
Don' t forget. - Fine!

932
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,808
Wait.

933
01:09:19,754 --> 01:09:20,812
Baba!

934
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:27,487
Soon 12 lakhs will be
deposited in your account.

935
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:29,863
' But I can' t get you out now.'

936
01:09:30,164 --> 01:09:33,395
' Everyone will come
after you and seek you out.'

937
01:09:33,768 --> 01:09:35,292
' Wait for some more days!'

938
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:37,799
' There is a lot of
pressure on me too.'

939
01:09:38,206 --> 01:09:39,298
' And stay alert!'

940
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:43,173
Bring everyone out?

941
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:44,505
Come on!

942
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,144
Who gave the information
about brother Mustafa!

943
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:47,339
Who did it?

944
01:09:47,415 --> 01:09:48,507
What are you doing? - Leave me!

945
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:50,114
What happened?

946
01:09:51,286 --> 01:09:52,776
Look!

947
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:54,047
Come here.

948
01:09:54,188 --> 01:09:56,782
I didn' t do anything!

949
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:57,916
Tell me!

950
01:09:58,059 --> 01:09:59,117
But, what has he done.

951
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,318
Quiet!

952
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:03,963
Let go of me!

953
01:10:04,532 --> 01:10:07,057
Who gave the tip? - I Don' t know!
I don' t know anything!

954
01:10:07,135 --> 01:10:08,193
I don' t know anything!

955
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:10,328
Who was it? - I don' t know anything!

956
01:10:10,805 --> 01:10:11,863
Tell me!

957
01:10:12,273 --> 01:10:13,831
What are you doing?

958
01:10:15,109 --> 01:10:17,134
Don' t take this matter lightly?

959
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:19,807
We will have to take
the responsibility..

960
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:21,007
..of brother Mustafa' s death!

961
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:24,010
Now, either the informer dies or us!

962
01:10:24,152 --> 01:10:25,210
Really!

963
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:28,912
How do you know that one
of them is a betrayer?

964
01:10:29,357 --> 01:10:30,847
Who else can it be?

965
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,128
This Yusuf, Razaq, Shrikant.

966
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,553
They are my people.

967
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,024
It can' t be one of them!

968
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:38,357
So, who else is left?

969
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,163
Why can' t it be you?

970
01:10:41,336 --> 01:10:42,394
Me!

971
01:10:44,205 --> 01:10:45,866
I didn' t think from
this point of view.

972
01:10:47,408 --> 01:10:49,273
Yes, it can be.

973
01:10:49,577 --> 01:10:52,375
Either you leave
these children alone.

974
01:10:54,449 --> 01:10:57,316
Or else, I will tie you up
the same way and ask you.

975
01:10:58,519 --> 01:11:00,453
Careful! Careful!

976
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:03,584
The doctor has said that..
- I will die after you.

977
01:11:04,592 --> 01:11:07,891
Not before. Don' t worry.

978
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,898
You shouldn' t do that to
your future son-in-law!

979
01:11:12,533 --> 01:11:15,900
You don' t know, your
daughter is pregnant.

980
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:20,999
How do you know that you
are the father of that child?

981
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:23,910
Fine, I won' t ask.

982
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:25,404
Fine.

983
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:31,010
Move aside!

984
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,294
Rathod. - Sir, none of
my men are on that job.

985
01:11:44,432 --> 01:11:45,899
You collected a reward
from the department too..

986
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:48,629
..in the name of
your unknown informer.

987
01:11:48,936 --> 01:11:50,631
And you say there is no one.

988
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:55,101
They are more stubborn then you are.

989
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:56,968
Who is he?

990
01:11:57,178 --> 01:11:58,941
Is it your son?

991
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:03,382
Final offer, 30 lakhs.

992
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:19,122
Pasha! Kill him!

993
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:27,999
Carefully!

994
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:29,202
What happened to him.

995
01:12:29,277 --> 01:12:31,677
Mamu' s entire gang is present here.

996
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:36,542
Come, come, the fried
rice is ready, come one.

997
01:12:36,617 --> 01:12:38,084
Come, come, come.

998
01:12:38,152 --> 01:12:40,985
Come. Serve yourselves.

999
01:12:41,122 --> 01:12:43,022
You take this.. - Brother,
please pass it on.

1000
01:12:56,304 --> 01:12:57,999
Don' t barge in.

1001
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,013
Who is he?

1002
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:21,354
Come here!

1003
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:23,053
Everyone come here!

1004
01:13:23,197 --> 01:13:24,721
Come on, everyone come here!

1005
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:26,057
Come on, everyone go!

1006
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:27,192
Eat later. Come on!

1007
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:30,395
Go ahead!

1008
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:34,065
Take a look at him!

1009
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:40,036
He is the murderer
of brother Mustafa.

1010
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:44,682
Are you listening, S.P sir?

1011
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:49,655
All we want is a name, that' s all.

1012
01:13:51,025 --> 01:13:52,117
Just point at him!

1013
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:55,053
I will respectfully drop you home

1014
01:13:57,231 --> 01:13:58,528
Pasha' s promise, sir.

1015
01:13:58,766 --> 01:14:01,291
' You have put
Kailash' s life in danger.'

1016
01:14:01,736 --> 01:14:03,169
' Kailash shouldn' t die!'

1017
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:06,232
' Promise me!'

1018
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,589
' This mask should
never be revealed!'

1019
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:34,294
' Because this mask is your truth!'

1020
01:14:36,337 --> 01:14:38,328
' Because this mask is your world!'

1021
01:14:41,809 --> 01:14:43,333
' Your fact!'

1022
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,192
You were crying!

1023
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:08,460
No, not at all!

1024
01:15:08,603 --> 01:15:09,661
Scared. - Not at all.

1025
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:10,761
You should be scared!

1026
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:12,100
Come here! Come here!

1027
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,298
Take a look at him!

1028
01:15:13,374 --> 01:15:14,432
Didn' t you recognise him?

1029
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:15,566
Didn' t you recognise him?

1030
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:16,701
You are his informer! - No!

1031
01:15:16,777 --> 01:15:17,835
He is your boss! - No!
I don' t know him!

1032
01:15:18,112 --> 01:15:19,170
I never saw him! - You don' t
know him! I never saw him!

1033
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:20,373
Take a look, closely!

1034
01:15:20,514 --> 01:15:21,572
Look! Look!

1035
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:22,707
Why did you cry, tell me.

1036
01:15:22,783 --> 01:15:23,841
Why did you cry?

1037
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:25,176
Tell me! He killed brother Mustafa

1038
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:26,377
! - So?

1039
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:27,512
He was our brother? - So?

1040
01:15:27,588 --> 01:15:28,646
Our business runs
because of him! -Yes, so?

1041
01:15:28,723 --> 01:15:29,781
So I was feeling bad that..
- You were feeling bad.

1042
01:15:29,857 --> 01:15:31,119
Tell me, why were you feeling bad?

1043
01:15:31,192 --> 01:15:32,250
Tell me!

1044
01:15:32,326 --> 01:15:33,384
Brother Mustafa died because of him.

1045
01:15:36,564 --> 01:15:37,622
That' s why you were crying?

1046
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:46,162
So sad about brother
Mustafa' s death! - Yes, brother.

1047
01:15:51,312 --> 01:15:52,370
Do one thing!

1048
01:15:52,713 --> 01:15:56,547
Come here. He killed your
brother Mustafa, isn' t it?

1049
01:15:58,886 --> 01:16:00,183
You kill him.

1050
01:16:14,168 --> 01:16:15,226
Here.

1051
01:16:17,204 --> 01:16:19,832
You have one bullet.
I have one bullet.

1052
01:16:20,775 --> 01:16:23,369
Number 6! Start!

1053
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:24,770
' No matter what happens!'

1054
01:16:25,446 --> 01:16:27,346
' Even if someone
points a gun at you..'

1055
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:32,376
' But your true identity
shouldn' t be seen on your face.'

1056
01:17:05,286 --> 01:17:06,344
You killed him!

1057
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:08,313
Really!

1058
01:17:09,957 --> 01:17:11,254
Very good.

1059
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:16,627
My gun was empty!

1060
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:22,727
Are you all listening?

1061
01:17:23,471 --> 01:17:24,699
This policeman died!

1062
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,640
And we didn' t even find
out the name of the informer.

1063
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:30,975
We still haven' t avenged
brother Mustafa' s death.

1064
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:33,304
If you sit at home and play cards..

1065
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:34,780
..then this is bound to happen.

1066
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:41,312
Thanks, man.

1067
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,848
You are very lucky for me!

1068
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:47,517
Third time lucky!

1069
01:17:48,262 --> 01:17:49,388
Hat-trick!

1070
01:18:03,444 --> 01:18:04,706
' Third time lucky!'

1071
01:18:05,012 --> 01:18:06,274
' Hat-trick!'

1072
01:18:07,815 --> 01:18:08,941
' Who are you?'

1073
01:18:09,016 --> 01:18:10,347
' Mummy!'

1074
01:18:10,618 --> 01:18:11,676
' Who are you?'  ' Mummy!..'

1075
01:18:11,752 --> 01:18:13,014
' I will always keep my
heart clear, father!'

1076
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:16,313
' I won' t kill anyone,
no matter what happens.'

1077
01:18:16,657 --> 01:18:18,716
' Fire!'

1078
01:18:18,793 --> 01:18:20,420
' Fire!'

1079
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:34,307
Mamu, I have heard that our
kind of work is going on..

1080
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:37,344
..near Mumbai.

1081
01:18:39,547 --> 01:18:40,707
Can I go there?

1082
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,644
You want to go!

1083
01:18:47,488 --> 01:18:48,716
You have completed a hat-trick!

1084
01:18:51,992 --> 01:18:53,323
That' s it! Go!

1085
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:02,393
Listen!

1086
01:19:05,339 --> 01:19:07,364
Won' t you stay for
Mamu' s funeral procession?

1087
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:09,804
He passed away!

1088
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:12,803
Last night!

1089
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:22,514
The heart searches!

1090
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:26,787
For ages.

1091
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:37,401
In unknown paths!

1092
01:19:38,706 --> 01:19:45,407
A moment of.. Iove.

1093
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:57,456
In the arms of.. Iife.

1094
01:19:57,958 --> 01:20:07,128
Even if your feet halt,
the caravan doesn' t stop.

1095
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:11,972
Convey your message
through your eyes!

1096
01:20:12,139 --> 01:20:16,667
Your face tells a story.

1097
01:20:17,144 --> 01:20:22,776
Will you have a puff?

1098
01:20:23,017 --> 01:20:24,917
Forget him, he is insane.

1099
01:20:26,754 --> 01:20:34,024
A moment on my breath!

1100
01:20:36,163 --> 01:20:39,462
In the path.. of life!

1101
01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:41,092
Did you find anything?

1102
01:20:41,168 --> 01:20:43,636
In the path..

1103
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,466
The water here is very deep.

1104
01:20:45,606 --> 01:20:47,870
Sometimes big fishes come here.

1105
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:50,473
Once, I got my hands
on a big fish too.

1106
01:20:51,612 --> 01:20:52,977
Very big fish.

1107
01:20:54,014 --> 01:20:56,175
It had a name too. Mustafa.

1108
01:21:00,788 --> 01:21:01,914
Rehman!

1109
01:21:03,157 --> 01:21:04,488
SP, intelligence.

1110
01:21:09,029 --> 01:21:10,189
Goodbye.

1111
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:15,928
Rathod told me about you.

1112
01:21:16,837 --> 01:21:18,668
He knew that his life was in danger.

1113
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:21,473
When I spoke to him for
the last time he said to me..

1114
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:27,503
..take care of Kailash!
Don' t let my promise break!

1115
01:21:29,216 --> 01:21:31,548
Now you don' t have to do this work.

1116
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,020
Your 12 lakhs are safe and sound!

1117
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,982
You are free!

1118
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:40,959
Come along with me, right now.

1119
01:21:42,162 --> 01:21:45,689
I will give you a new
life and a new name.

1120
01:21:45,899 --> 01:21:47,764
Rehman sir.

1121
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:50,496
Will you do one thing for me?

1122
01:21:51,772 --> 01:21:54,502
Will you take that 12 lakh rupees..

1123
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:57,806
..and give it to Rathod sir' s
wife and mother on my behalf.

1124
01:21:59,246 --> 01:22:00,577
Give it to her.

1125
01:22:02,249 --> 01:22:08,245
And tell her that, your
son has given it, accept it.

1126
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:11,982
And if possible, forgive him!

1127
01:22:22,836 --> 01:22:24,565
There is a very big
operation going on here.

1128
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:27,798
Explosives are being imported.

1129
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,571
There are many foreigners too.

1130
01:22:31,745 --> 01:22:34,543
In this small village, l
can only sit at the shore..

1131
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:35,673
..and keep a watch on them.

1132
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:38,981
If you can take to their roots..

1133
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,583
Then, I will find out their secret.

1134
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:43,746
You won' t change
your mind, isn' t it?

1135
01:22:45,092 --> 01:22:48,550
To get you out of here,
and plant you there..

1136
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:52,588
..I will have to
sacrifice two scapegoats.

1137
01:22:57,171 --> 01:23:00,607
Sir. How did you
know my whereabouts?

1138
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:04,978
Why? What do you think?

1139
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:08,679
You are the only
informer of the department!

1140
01:23:20,594 --> 01:23:21,652
Look!

1141
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:22,991
This corpse cannot be identified.

1142
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:24,188
The fishes have
devoured his entire face.

1143
01:23:24,331 --> 01:23:26,196
This.. this shirt
belonged to Vinayak! Isn' t it?

1144
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,595
His head is missing.

1145
01:23:29,103 --> 01:23:30,730
The one you killed in my place.

1146
01:23:30,871 --> 01:23:31,929
Who was he?

1147
01:23:32,306 --> 01:23:34,206
Was his crime
worthy of being killed?

1148
01:23:34,641 --> 01:23:36,074
You don' t have to know about that.

1149
01:23:37,177 --> 01:23:38,337
But sir..

1150
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:42,906
The people handling the operation..

1151
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,281
..were lsmail' s men!

1152
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:52,018
Ismail is from the
Mumbai underworld.

1153
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:56,556
But he has influences in Egypt,
Yemen and the Russian underworld.

1154
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,624
Maybe he..

1155
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:03,402
But that can be found
out only after going in.

1156
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:06,072
I am ready! - Are you sure?

1157
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,300
Why are you doing this?

1158
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:10,669
Why am I doing it?

1159
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,675
To avenge my father' s death.

1160
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:20,583
He lay down his
life to keep me alive.

1161
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,615
Yes!

1162
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,456
There is one problem!

1163
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,191
Ismail won' t let any
Hindu come close to him.

1164
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:39,435
You will have to go in as a Muslim!

1165
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:42,507
So what? I will become a Muslim.

1166
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,541
It is not just about
changing your name, son.

1167
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:48,343
The entry ticket is very expensive.

1168
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,448
They will give you an injection
and make you say everything.

1169
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,285
Only then will they let you come in.

1170
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,091
Then..

1171
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:03,291
You will have to accept lslam!
With a true heart.

1172
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:04,723
Completely!

1173
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,428
There is no other way.

1174
01:25:11,205 --> 01:25:16,541
Do you accept lslam with your
own will and with a pure heart?

1175
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:27,079
Yes, I accept lslam with my
own will and a true heart.

1176
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,104
Your name is Shehzad Khan!

1177
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,712
Your father' s name
is Ghulam Ahmed Khan!

1178
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,151
You were born in Aligarh!

1179
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:59,648
Your education, till 7th standard!

1180
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,689
In Aligarh Government school.

1181
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:04,782
After that, you spent
5 years in the Madrasa!

1182
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:07,226
Then you were sent to Jalalabad.

1183
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:09,054
But the doctors there,
considered that..

1184
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,792
..you weren' t capable of
training with weapons.

1185
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,369
You kept working in their
Arabic kitchen for 3 months.

1186
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,733
And then you were
sent back to Aligarh!

1187
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:19,334
And they kept you on standby!

1188
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,473
Kailash! - Forgive me, mother.

1189
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:35,146
Look, son, what are
you apologising for?

1190
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,748
What else could you have done?

1191
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:42,295
Your mother is always with you!

1192
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,392
Goodbye!

1193
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:54,606
They are taking
advantage of your innocence.

1194
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:57,109
The path you have set out on..

1195
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,169
..you won' t be able to
come back from there.

1196
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:04,414
I have lost my husband, l
don' t want to lose my son!

1197
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,188
Come back to your mother, son!

1198
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:09,514
Come back.

1199
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:10,750
Goodbye!

1200
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:29,135
Sir, you are killing an
innocent cook and sending me there.

1201
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,507
We didn' t kill Shehzad.

1202
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:33,704
We don' t kill innocent people.

1203
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:37,776
He realised his mistake in
Jalalabad, and came to us.

1204
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:40,251
He came to his senses!

1205
01:27:41,255 --> 01:27:43,815
We sent him home to
wait for the right moment.

1206
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:47,224
And now, the right time has come.

1207
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:51,160
Tomorrow he will ask for
permission from his local leader..

1208
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:52,290
..to come to Mumbai.

1209
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:55,696
And as soon as he leaves
from there and comes to us..

1210
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:59,172
You will leave from
here and go to lsmail..

1211
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,299
..taking his identity!

1212
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:07,906
Who is brother Yusuf!

1213
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:12,550
Shehzad Khan!

1214
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,917
Take your pants off! - Why?

1215
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:19,317
Take it off.

1216
01:28:21,295 --> 01:28:24,594
Sir, what was the need
to cut me off like this?

1217
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:27,659
They will check
you from head to toe.

1218
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:33,496
And by the way, it is
the sign of a real man.

1219
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:39,538
And then..

1220
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,209
The image of your eyes, meaning..

1221
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:43,307
..they will do your retinal check.

1222
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:46,217
That' s why we have entered
the image of your eyes..

1223
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:49,814
..in their computers
by the name of Shehzad!

1224
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:51,449
All the best.

1225
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:53,789
You will pass this test!

1226
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:12,343
We will take you
inside the lion' s cave.

1227
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:18,247
But after that.. what
will the lion do with you..

1228
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,378
..that' s what I am worried about.

1229
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,823
Greetings brother lsmail!
- Greetings.

1230
01:29:45,746 --> 01:29:48,442
So son, get to work. Go!

1231
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:08,365
Go, keep the box!

1232
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:24,542
Will you have a cigarette?

1233
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:29,952
Where does this
vehicle go to? - Dadar!

1234
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,076
Tell me, what do you want?

1235
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,003
Give me four chocolates.

1236
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:59,677
How much? - 50!

1237
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:11,864
Want one? - Thank you!

1238
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:14,759
Thank you!

1239
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,736
Who operates this fax? - l!

1240
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:20,897
What is your name? - Manjoor!

1241
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:24,875
I am Shehzad! I work in
the mansion, there. - Fine!

1242
01:31:27,581 --> 01:31:28,980
We will meet later. - Fine.

1243
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:42,928
250-300 foreigners have arrived!

1244
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:45,689
They have been kept
at different places.

1245
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,658
How do you know?

1246
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:49,864
Ismail has opened a special kitchen.

1247
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,667
Special Arabic food is
being prepared for them.

1248
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,876
Is there anyone else
along with lsmail? - No!

1249
01:31:57,411 --> 01:31:59,641
Sure? - Yes!

1250
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:01,839
Here!

1251
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,614
I have seen this picture before too.

1252
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,052
His codename is Saaya!

1253
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:10,488
But I haven' t seen this man before.

1254
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:14,422
Keep lsmail as your target!

1255
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:15,621
You will surely find out something.

1256
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:20,997
Have you.. found a way to
send message in an emergency?

1257
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,161
I will!

1258
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:29,733
Manjoor! Manjoor!

1259
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:31,772
Keep this, I will be back soon!

1260
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:33,040
Fine!

1261
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:38,509
Here, eat this.

1262
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:42,718
I have made it for you,
how is it? - Very nice.

1263
01:32:43,524 --> 01:32:45,458
Give your brother too. - Okay!

1264
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:46,959
Brother Shehzad, will
you come tomorrow too?

1265
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:52,097
Go! Go!

1266
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:12,063
Wake him up!

1267
01:35:14,074 --> 01:35:15,132
What happened? Where did
you get this phone from?

1268
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:16,267
- I don' t know anything!

1269
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:17,605
Tell me, where did you
get this phone from?

1270
01:35:17,678 --> 01:35:18,736
I don' t know anything! Tell me!

1271
01:35:18,812 --> 01:35:20,905
Brother, leave me! Leave me!

1272
01:35:20,981 --> 01:35:22,676
Where are you taking me?
Bring him along!

1273
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,012
Leave me! Leave me!

1274
01:35:24,084 --> 01:35:25,142
Come on.
- I don' t know anything!

1275
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:29,246
Hey! - Hey, Wasid!

1276
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:31,949
I don' t know anything!

1277
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,084
Brother Shehzad, l
didn' t do anything!

1278
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,855
Bring him!

1279
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,108
Brother!

1280
01:36:01,021 --> 01:36:03,819
Here! Take it!

1281
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,221
If you want to be with us..

1282
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:11,730
..then you will have
to become one of us!

1283
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:12,990
Here!

1284
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,309
Yes!

1285
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:18,789
What is your name?

1286
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:24,395
' My name.. my name.'

1287
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:26,166
' Vinayak Marathe!'

1288
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,834
' Before that, it
was something else.'

1289
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:32,740
' Before that, it
was something else.'

1290
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:34,212
' Before that, it
was something else.'

1291
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:35,839
' I have many names.'

1292
01:37:37,117 --> 01:37:38,175
' I have many names.' 
' Which one should I tell you?'

1293
01:37:38,252 --> 01:37:40,311
' I have many names.'

1294
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:42,413
Name!

1295
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:48,359
' I accept lslam with my
own will and a true heart.'

1296
01:37:48,862 --> 01:37:50,830
' Your name is Shehzad Khan!'

1297
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:54,399
My name is Shehzad Khan!

1298
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:04,266
My name is Shehzad Khan!

1299
01:38:04,912 --> 01:38:06,140
What is the name of your father?

1300
01:38:06,847 --> 01:38:08,838
' Why should I answer?'

1301
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:13,844
What is the name of your father?

1302
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,889
' Why are you asking?'

1303
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:18,282
' I told you, my father is dead!'

1304
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,963
' What else do you want?'

1305
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:37,037
' Remember, Shehzad only
knows Arabic, Urdu and Hindi'!

1306
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:40,273
What did you say?

1307
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:46,046
What is the name of your father?

1308
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:49,378
' Remember your father' s
name is Ghulam Ahmed Khan!'

1309
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:59,422
My father' s name is
Ghulam Ahmed Khan.

1310
01:39:23,857 --> 01:39:25,848
You sit in the store all night?

1311
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:27,917
Yes brother, but
sometimes I fall asleep too.

1312
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:33,123
Listen, I want to fax a
love letter to my girlfriend!

1313
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:35,400
But no one should know about it.

1314
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:36,927
I am there, brother.

1315
01:39:37,004 --> 01:39:39,029
No just one, I will
send as many as you want.

1316
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:42,465
Today evening, I will send your
paper by folding it like a rocket.

1317
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:47,037
Fax it! And after the
job is done, whistle.

1318
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:48,871
Our personal signal.

1319
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:50,007
Okay!

1320
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:51,511
Eat some more, come on!

1321
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:41,093
I love you too!

1322
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,450
Sir! Come sir.

1323
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:08,117
The name of the four informers.

1324
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:11,396
Four of your people work with me.

1325
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:13,462
How many of you are there?

1326
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:17,996
Why do you want it?

1327
01:41:18,472 --> 01:41:20,531
We paid you 1
crore for every person.

1328
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:22,134
What other reason do you want?

1329
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:24,070
Even call girls earn money!

1330
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:26,072
We have to look out
for our reputation too.

1331
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:31,417
You know we had gold business.

1332
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:34,749
After a long time, we
are restarting that again!

1333
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:37,421
Very big consignments are arriving.

1334
01:41:37,891 --> 01:41:39,620
We wanted it for its protection.

1335
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:44,559
Those explosives. Those foreigners!

1336
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:46,565
Your men told you
only half the story.

1337
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:48,432
All that is for export.

1338
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,434
The explosives are
for industrial purpose.

1339
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,769
And those foreigners are our guests.

1340
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:57,439
They have arrived,
tired from the lraq war.

1341
01:41:57,978 --> 01:41:59,172
They will go back there.

1342
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:02,106
What can be done?

1343
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:04,444
If you want to gain reputation
in the international business..

1344
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:05,917
..then we need to do all this.

1345
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:11,917
Why didn' t Rehman come?

1346
01:42:11,992 --> 01:42:13,118
He is insane!

1347
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:14,455
I had told you!

1348
01:42:15,195 --> 01:42:17,789
That means, amongst these four men,
Rehman' s man is also there.

1349
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:19,056
There is one.

1350
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:20,524
He didn' t say!

1351
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,200
We found him out.

1352
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:25,869
There can be some
other informer of his too.

1353
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:28,866
Doesn' t seem like it.

1354
01:42:29,076 --> 01:42:30,134
Keep an eye on him!

1355
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:34,013
The department keeps
an eye on everything.

1356
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:37,943
By the way, are you
alone in this operation?

1357
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:42,088
Or is there some Saaya along?

1358
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,214
Saaya!

1359
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,095
IG sir, I have been doing
this business for so long..

1360
01:42:49,229 --> 01:42:51,026
..that, I don' t need a partner.

1361
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,697
We will need 2 crores more.

1362
01:43:02,576 --> 01:43:03,975
Have it sent by tomorrow morning.

1363
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:31,533
Why did you look towards me?

1364
01:43:31,672 --> 01:43:33,799
He suddenly asked me, that' s why..

1365
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:35,533
The bullet will be
fired suddenly too.

1366
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:38,539
I apologise, sir.

1367
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:41,209
Round them up!

1368
01:43:42,616 --> 01:43:44,277
Yes! Yes!

1369
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:53,017
Come on, come. Sit here!

1370
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:41,932
Are you an informer?

1371
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,138
Say the truth!

1372
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:51,081
You won' t have to
endure anymore pain!

1373
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:36,720
I have seen him!

1374
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,188
Saaya!

1375
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:41,657
It' s him!

1376
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,194
The department has sold itself.

1377
01:45:46,807 --> 01:45:48,672
The fools have made a report..

1378
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:50,733
..that only gold is
being smuggled in.

1379
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:53,673
Everyone has sold themselves.

1380
01:45:54,748 --> 01:45:56,739
Four people were killed yesterday.

1381
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:58,878
They were our men.

1382
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:01,948
One of them was my informer.

1383
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,687
A very big operation
is being undertaken.

1384
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:08,087
But this isn' t just about smuggling!

1385
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:11,357
But I can' t say what' s going on.

1386
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:15,234
I have a bit of an experience, sir.

1387
01:46:15,836 --> 01:46:17,030
Please listen to me.

1388
01:46:18,839 --> 01:46:20,306
Bring the evidence, Kailash!

1389
01:46:20,974 --> 01:46:22,032
What do they want to do?

1390
01:46:22,109 --> 01:46:23,167
What are their plans?

1391
01:46:23,243 --> 01:46:24,767
Then you see, I will
turn their world around.

1392
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:26,975
I will take it
directly to the Home Minister!

1393
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:30,716
But right now, I am being followed..

1394
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,446
..by the people of
my own department.

1395
01:46:35,255 --> 01:46:38,247
I don' t want them to
reach you through me.

1396
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:41,791
Listen, if anything happens to me..

1397
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:44,387
..then, there is another
way to deliver the evidence.

1398
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:45,726
Who?

1399
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:50,132
Your mother! - Mother!

1400
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:33,840
' It is called endoscope.'

1401
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:36,312
' And that' s the camera!'

1402
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:38,374
' With that, you click the
photos of inside the stomach!'

1403
01:47:45,392 --> 01:47:46,791
What the hell! Hello!

1404
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:48,794
Sir, this is inspector
Rao from Hyderabad! - Yes!

1405
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:50,921
Sir, Pasha is coming to Mumbai..
by today 5..30 Jet Airways flight!

1406
01:47:50,997 --> 01:47:52,055
Pasha is coming to Mumbai!

1407
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:53,863
And you are telling me now!

1408
01:47:54,201 --> 01:47:56,066
It is 6..30, the
flight must be landing.

1409
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:57,797
Sir, I am very sorry,
sir, actually..

1410
01:47:57,871 --> 01:47:59,463
Do you have his
latest mobile number?

1411
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:03,336
Greetings brother Pasha!

1412
01:48:05,879 --> 01:48:07,938
I want to track a
mobile number in Mumbai!

1413
01:48:08,882 --> 01:48:09,940
The number is..

1414
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:12,813
What happened?

1415
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:14,080
Why have you made such a face?

1416
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:16,815
By driving the vehicle at
20 kilometres per hour..

1417
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:18,881
..we are dead tired!

1418
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:22,021
Do you have a GPRS tracker?

1419
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:24,887
I am activating GPRS tracker!

1420
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:27,230
Was there any problem?

1421
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:28,358
If there would have
been any problem..

1422
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,493
..then we would have been
blown along with the explosives.

1423
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:31,835
Satellite tracking has started.

1424
01:48:32,906 --> 01:48:34,100
Leave for the bus stand.

1425
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:35,573
You can sleep in the
bus for Hyderabad.

1426
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:38,509
His information is
downloading on your system.

1427
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:40,375
You can listen to his voice,
and stop it too.

1428
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:42,972
Greetings, brother Pasha! -
Greetings, brother lsmail!

1429
01:48:43,049 --> 01:48:44,107
Greetings!

1430
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,311
And if you want, you can
take over the call too.

1431
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:49,913
Was everything fine from our side?

1432
01:48:50,056 --> 01:48:52,320
The right way, on the right time.

1433
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:53,450
Thank God!

1434
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:54,994
Go and tell this to sir too.

1435
01:48:55,061 --> 01:48:56,119
He will meet you personally.

1436
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:57,390
First, let us eat something. - Yes.

1437
01:49:00,867 --> 01:49:02,994
Hyderabadi kebab,
especially for you!

1438
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:04,127
Here.

1439
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:05,330
And along with that if we
can get bread from Mumbai..

1440
01:49:05,405 --> 01:49:06,997
..then that' s even better!

1441
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:27,085
Bring the fried rice.

1442
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:42,966
What is the matter, brother Pasha?

1443
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:44,101
Didn' t you like the food?

1444
01:49:45,445 --> 01:49:46,912
No! Eat.

1445
01:49:47,113 --> 01:49:50,310
That boy! I saw him
after a long time.

1446
01:49:50,984 --> 01:49:53,111
What is his name? - Vinayak Marathe!

1447
01:49:53,653 --> 01:49:55,587
No, no his name is Shehzad Khan!

1448
01:49:55,655 --> 01:49:57,179
He is the kitchen help.

1449
01:49:57,657 --> 01:49:59,181
He is our boy. Eat!

1450
01:50:13,673 --> 01:50:14,935
Personal!

1451
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:16,134
Wow, brother!

1452
01:50:21,014 --> 01:50:22,675
Pasha! - Sir.

1453
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:24,942
You fulfilled your promise!

1454
01:50:25,352 --> 01:50:26,410
Now it' s our turn!

1455
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:30,411
I am your slave,
sir. This was my duty.

1456
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:31,952
We will meet in the evening.

1457
01:50:32,025 --> 01:50:37,691
Sir.. sir, just a minute,
the signal is a bit weak here.

1458
01:50:38,565 --> 01:50:40,624
There was a small thing,
sir! - Tell me.

1459
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:43,501
I feel, the situation
here is very strange.

1460
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:48,964
We don' t keep any place for
anything strange, in our camp.

1461
01:50:49,709 --> 01:50:50,971
Yes, I know sir.

1462
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:55,981
But.. what can I say,
there is one thing..

1463
01:50:56,049 --> 01:50:57,710
..that you are not aware of!

1464
01:50:59,052 --> 01:51:00,713
Or you weren' t informed about it.

1465
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:04,188
What is it? Who didn' t inform me?

1466
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:07,989
Hello, Ramesh! Ramesh,
what are you doing? - Sir!

1467
01:51:08,061 --> 01:51:10,325
What? What? What? What? What is
the condition of the market? - Hello!

1468
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:11,591
What is the rate of Reliance? - Sir.

1469
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,656
Hi Bubba, what' s happening
with the wave, man? Hello!

1470
01:51:13,733 --> 01:51:15,325
What' s up! What' s up! What' s up!

1471
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:16,596
What' s happening with the wave?

1472
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:19,070
Everything is done!
Let' s check it out.

1473
01:51:19,606 --> 01:51:20,664
What are you saying?

1474
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,002
You want me to slap you!

1475
01:51:22,075 --> 01:51:23,599
You don' t listen to anyone!

1476
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:25,076
What can you do? You tell me!
You don' t listen to anyone!

1477
01:51:25,145 --> 01:51:26,669
What can you do?

1478
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:29,408
This.. - What did you want to say?

1479
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:32,347
There is a boy, sir.

1480
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:34,478
At  your place.

1481
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:36,079
Hello, police control room!

1482
01:51:36,156 --> 01:51:37,680
Hello, police control room!

1483
01:51:37,757 --> 01:51:39,418
Who is speaking?

1484
01:51:39,492 --> 01:51:40,550
What is the disturbance?

1485
01:51:41,094 --> 01:51:42,755
Fine, Ramya, send a car there.

1486
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:46,430
Who is this speaking? Hello.. hello..
hello.. - Send the entire squad!

1487
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:49,093
The entire squad should go there!
Sir! - Not on the phone.

1488
01:51:49,769 --> 01:51:52,033
Come near the film
city lake near Powai!

1489
01:51:52,172 --> 01:51:53,230
I am coming, sir.

1490
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:15,058
Sir! - Where are you, Pasha?

1491
01:52:16,196 --> 01:52:17,527
I have reached, sir.

1492
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:20,055
But I can' t see you!

1493
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,667
I will be there, soon.

1494
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,072
' Oh no!'

1495
01:52:35,148 --> 01:52:36,615
' He has come completely prepared.'

1496
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:39,744
' I will have to do something or
else that boy will be in danger.'

1497
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:52,155
Hello! - Hello, son.

1498
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:55,100
Son, you have returned
from school! - Yes, papa.

1499
01:52:55,168 --> 01:52:57,762
Son, give the phone to your mother.

1500
01:52:57,837 --> 01:53:00,431
Mother has gone to the market, papa.

1501
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:06,704
Son.. always take care of
your mother! - Fine, papa!

1502
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,648
But.. papa, where are you?

1503
01:53:09,716 --> 01:53:12,116
I am right here! No
matter where I will be..

1504
01:53:12,185 --> 01:53:13,652
..but I am always with you, son.

1505
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,778
Thank you, papa!

1506
01:53:15,855 --> 01:53:18,187
Goodbye, son! - Goodbye, papa.

1507
01:53:18,391 --> 01:53:20,859
I love! - I love you too, son!

1508
01:53:30,603 --> 01:53:32,127
I love you too, son!

1509
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:54,422
Brother Pasha, come behind!

1510
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:17,649
Who are you? Who are you, you fool!

1511
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:20,183
Move it!

1512
01:54:41,608 --> 01:54:43,200
You will kill Pasha!

1513
01:54:44,344 --> 01:54:46,403
Just one bullet, and that too wrong.

1514
01:55:04,297 --> 01:55:07,562
I had said, the
situation is not right!

1515
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:28,319
Sir.. there is a boy..

1516
01:55:29,255 --> 01:55:30,313
What about him?

1517
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:39,730
That means the angle wasn' t wrong!

1518
01:55:50,476 --> 01:55:51,534
Which man, Pasha?

1519
01:55:51,678 --> 01:55:52,736
What is his name?

1520
01:56:34,387 --> 01:56:36,719
Greetings! - Yes, sir!

1521
01:56:37,056 --> 01:56:39,923
What is the situation? Is
the operation under control?

1522
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:42,588
Yes! - I wanted to know the details.

1523
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:44,323
Send it, like always!

1524
01:56:44,397 --> 01:56:45,796
On the secret e-mail lD!

1525
01:56:45,865 --> 01:56:47,332
To defeat the new technology..

1526
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,732
..we have to resort
to the old methods.

1527
01:56:50,336 --> 01:56:52,327
Net, mobile, nothing is safe now.

1528
01:56:52,472 --> 01:56:55,066
Example! Is there
any threat to the plan?

1529
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:56,670
The plan is safe.

1530
01:56:56,743 --> 01:56:58,005
Goodbye!

1531
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:01,671
' The plan is safe.'

1532
01:57:05,084 --> 01:57:08,349
' The plan.. is safe.'

1533
01:57:11,891 --> 01:57:13,358
What happened to the kitchen?

1534
01:57:13,426 --> 01:57:14,484
Everything has been closed.

1535
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,618
We don' t need you from tomorrow.

1536
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:16,753
And the guests.

1537
01:57:16,829 --> 01:57:18,353
They are all leaving.
Where are they going?

1538
01:57:18,431 --> 01:57:19,625
What do you care about that?

1539
01:57:19,766 --> 01:57:21,097
Go and look after you work.

1540
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:32,972
Listen, what are these
empty suitcases for?

1541
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:34,513
The foreigners that are leaving.

1542
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,514
Maybe it' s for them! - Okay!

1543
01:57:53,132 --> 01:57:57,728
' In this world, no one
is a friend or a brother!'

1544
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:02,407
' We have come alone
and we will go alone!'

1545
01:58:03,609 --> 01:58:06,544
' Like always, I haven' t
come to beg for my life.'

1546
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:09,404
' I am ready to die.'

1547
01:58:10,616 --> 01:58:13,414
' But even after every
possible efforts of mine..

1548
01:58:13,486 --> 01:58:15,477
..if I don' t reach my destination!'

1549
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:20,154
' Then hold my finger and help
me walk those last few steps.'

1550
01:59:28,995 --> 01:59:30,053
The mansion is ablaze!

1551
01:59:30,129 --> 01:59:31,187
Won' t you help?

1552
01:59:31,264 --> 01:59:32,526
I have to stay here!

1553
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:33,657
By the way, what are you doing here?

1554
01:59:46,746 --> 01:59:47,804
Quickly!

1555
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,291
How did this happen?

1556
02:00:20,847 --> 02:00:22,576
Go and gather all the boys.
- As you wish!

1557
02:00:49,676 --> 02:00:51,735
Sit down!

1558
02:01:07,827 --> 02:01:09,692
Who' s left? - The new cook!

1559
02:01:11,631 --> 02:01:13,360
Search for him! - As you wish!

1560
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,294
I want him alive!

1561
02:01:53,172 --> 02:01:54,662
We found him
unconscious near your room.

1562
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:30,840
' Mother, this is my first and
maybe my last letter to you.'

1563
02:02:31,711 --> 02:02:32,905
' Rehman sir is no more.'

1564
02:02:34,447 --> 02:02:36,381
' Except for you, there is
no one else in this world!'

1565
02:02:37,717 --> 02:02:39,378
' Believe in
everything I say, mother!'

1566
02:02:40,453 --> 02:02:42,921
' Their plan was so
deep but still so easy!'

1567
02:02:43,456 --> 02:02:44,923
' I have just understood them.'

1568
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:48,725
' Tomorrow morning,
between 9..20 and 9..27..

1569
02:02:48,795 --> 02:02:49,853
..within 7 minutes, 20
human bombs will take..

1570
02:02:49,929 --> 02:02:51,453
..20 suitcases
filled with explosives.'

1571
02:02:51,731 --> 02:02:53,790
' And trigger a blast in
20 buildings of the city.'

1572
02:02:57,804 --> 02:02:58,862
' Where do people run
when there is a blast..

1573
02:02:58,938 --> 02:02:59,996
..in the building,
where do people go?'

1574
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:02,799
' Millions of people
will come on the street.'

1575
02:03:02,942 --> 02:03:04,000
' To run away!'

1576
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:06,878
' Thinking that this road
will lead them to safety!'

1577
02:03:08,181 --> 02:03:10,479
But death is awaiting
them on these streets!'

1578
02:03:13,486 --> 02:03:15,818
' 200 more human bombs will
stand at different places..

1579
02:03:15,888 --> 02:03:18,288
..in taxi' s with
explosives in the suitcase.'

1580
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:20,149
' I am sending you all the details..

1581
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:22,285
..of their place of
hiding and the blast.'

1582
02:03:23,329 --> 02:03:25,490
' This will be the worlds
biggest terrorist attack, mother!'

1583
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:27,832
' Millions of innocent
people will lose their lives.'

1584
02:03:29,035 --> 02:03:30,093
' Mother, you are the
only person that can..

1585
02:03:30,169 --> 02:03:33,434
..take this news to the right people,
and stop this from happening!'

1586
02:03:38,444 --> 02:03:39,502
Stop!

1587
02:04:27,894 --> 02:04:28,952
Don' t move!

1588
02:04:43,009 --> 02:04:44,067
Go! You go!

1589
02:05:58,451 --> 02:05:59,918
I can' t feel anything.

1590
02:06:01,587 --> 02:06:04,385
Neither fear, nor pain.

1591
02:06:05,257 --> 02:06:06,656
That' s the sign of a brave man.

1592
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:09,318
Well done!

1593
02:06:11,664 --> 02:06:14,132
Multiple fractures!
Arterial rupture!

1594
02:06:15,134 --> 02:06:17,534
Slowly, this ground
will soak up your blood.

1595
02:06:19,071 --> 02:06:20,538
And then, your life too.

1596
02:06:22,141 --> 02:06:25,304
There can' t be a
better death than that.

1597
02:06:29,615 --> 02:06:30,673
Endoscope!

1598
02:06:38,624 --> 02:06:40,023
If our evidence
would have gone out..

1599
02:06:40,092 --> 02:06:43,027
..then what would have
happened to our mission?

1600
02:06:44,597 --> 02:06:48,397
I praise your
intelligence more than your courage.

1601
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:52,096
You are a genius, Shehzad!

1602
02:06:53,973 --> 02:06:55,031
Or, whoever you are.

1603
02:06:55,708 --> 02:06:56,970
Genius!

1604
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:12,387
Truth serum, the lie detector test.

1605
02:07:13,259 --> 02:07:14,317
How did you dodge that all?

1606
02:07:15,227 --> 02:07:16,387
You were unconscious at that time.

1607
02:07:19,231 --> 02:07:21,665
You accepted what was false.

1608
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:23,997
Truth always remains the truth.

1609
02:07:25,071 --> 02:07:27,005
And false will always remain false.

1610
02:07:27,673 --> 02:07:30,073
I have accepted
lslam with a pure heart.

1611
02:07:31,744 --> 02:07:36,078
And until I die, l
will remain Shehzad Khan!

1612
02:07:38,017 --> 02:07:40,747
I am asking about the lie.

1613
02:07:42,021 --> 02:07:43,079
Lie!

1614
02:07:44,323 --> 02:07:47,315
Lie is killing those innocent
people in the name of Allah!

1615
02:08:05,778 --> 02:08:07,439
Stop this destruction!

1616
02:08:09,381 --> 02:08:11,042
It is against the norms of lslam!

1617
02:08:12,118 --> 02:08:17,283
I beg to you on behalf of
those millions of innocent people.

1618
02:08:18,758 --> 02:08:20,316
Spare their lives!

1619
02:08:21,127 --> 02:08:22,458
If you had time..

1620
02:08:23,395 --> 02:08:25,386
..then I would have
thought you to walk on my path.

1621
02:08:26,499 --> 02:08:29,593
But regretfully, you are dying!

1622
02:08:31,737 --> 02:08:32,795
Die comfortably.

1623
02:08:35,407 --> 02:08:37,068
Here is your enemy' s salute!

1624
02:08:55,828 --> 02:08:58,422
Greetings! How is it?
- Everything is fine.

1625
02:08:59,365 --> 02:09:01,162
An informer got to know the plan!

1626
02:09:02,768 --> 02:09:04,099
But we caught him.

1627
02:09:04,336 --> 02:09:06,770
What about him? - He will die along!

1628
02:09:06,839 --> 02:09:08,101
Where is he?

1629
02:09:08,641 --> 02:09:09,699
Right in front of me!

1630
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:12,107
He is breathing his last.

1631
02:09:12,178 --> 02:09:14,772
What about the plan? -
Just like we wanted.

1632
02:09:14,847 --> 02:09:16,644
Goodbye. - Goodbye!

1633
02:10:31,924 --> 02:10:35,690
God.

1634
02:10:42,268 --> 02:10:49,936
God.

1635
02:10:50,542 --> 02:10:53,272
What a strange wish you have?

1636
02:10:56,282 --> 02:10:58,807
That I should die happily.

1637
02:11:02,221 --> 02:11:04,348
My blood repaid its debt!

1638
02:11:07,493 --> 02:11:12,624
I have no regrets with anyone.

1639
02:11:12,765 --> 02:11:18,465
God.

1640
02:11:18,537 --> 02:11:25,705
Without your will..
no one can do anything!

1641
02:11:29,782 --> 02:11:39,987
O Lord, I have a few moments left.

1642
02:11:40,993 --> 02:11:46,989
God.

1643
02:12:39,451 --> 02:12:44,980
God.

1644
02:12:45,057 --> 02:12:48,515
God.

1645
02:12:48,594 --> 02:12:49,856
No one should survive!

1646
02:12:50,062 --> 02:12:51,324
Spare no one. - Yes, sir.

1647
02:12:51,397 --> 02:12:53,331
Sir. - Sir, the
information was right.

1648
02:12:54,066 --> 02:12:56,694
It is surprising that.. - We are
preparing for the attack, sir.

1649
02:12:56,769 --> 02:12:58,327
We will attack in
the next 30 minutes.

1650
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:02,407
The smear on the fax, was it blood?

1651
02:13:02,941 --> 02:13:03,999
It seems so, sir.

1652
02:13:06,345 --> 02:13:09,644
That means he is injured.

1653
02:13:09,715 --> 02:13:11,410
It is our duty to save his life.

1654
02:13:11,683 --> 02:13:15,949
But sir, his name,
face.. we don' t know anything.

1655
02:13:19,691 --> 02:13:21,750
You mean to say that one man..

1656
02:13:21,827 --> 02:13:24,352
..that can save the entire Mumbai.

1657
02:13:25,898 --> 02:13:27,024
We can' t save him!

1658
02:13:33,505 --> 02:13:36,372
Go. Finish the
operation this night itself.

1659
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:39,441
In the morning, no one
should know that the country..

1660
02:13:39,511 --> 02:13:44,380
..passed through such a
great threat tonight. Go.

1661
02:13:44,450 --> 02:13:45,508
Sir!

1662
02:13:46,852 --> 02:13:50,982
' Unknown life. Unfamiliar paths.'

1663
02:13:52,057 --> 02:13:56,391
' The distances walk together.'

1664
02:13:58,397 --> 02:14:02,458
' The desire to live..
made me an informer.'

1665
02:14:03,735 --> 02:14:07,398
' The desire to live..
made me an informer.'

1666
02:14:07,473 --> 02:14:09,737
No survivors! Kill them all!

1667
02:14:09,808 --> 02:14:12,538
' Every time I donned a new mask..'

1668
02:14:18,517 --> 02:14:25,753
God.

1669
02:14:36,535 --> 02:14:37,763
50 stinger missiles!

1670
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:39,501
50 grenades!

1671
02:14:39,705 --> 02:14:41,502
Do you want to start a war?

1672
02:14:42,441 --> 02:14:45,638
I pay you for the goods
and not for asking questions.

1673
02:14:45,711 --> 02:14:49,442
Fine, this is my new assistant,
Emanuel Gonsalves!

1674
02:14:49,515 --> 02:14:50,709
He will handle your order.

1675
02:14:53,051 --> 02:14:55,042
His, I am Gonsalves!

1676
02:14:55,854 --> 02:14:57,515
Everything will happen
according to the plan.

1677
02:14:58,123 --> 02:14:59,181
Don' t worry.

1678
02:15:02,461 --> 02:15:11,529
Oh Lord.

1679
02:15:26,618 --> 02:15:27,778
We have to live on..

1680
02:15:27,853 --> 02:15:31,220
We have to live on
even after dying.

1681
02:15:31,490 --> 02:15:35,153
We have to live on
even after dying.

1682
02:15:35,227 --> 02:15:39,561
Live on!

1683
02:15:40,165 --> 02:15:44,568
Live on!

1684
02:15:45,837 --> 02:15:50,501
Let the oceans of
your pain, thrive in you!

1685
02:15:50,642 --> 02:15:55,238
Let the oceans of
your pain, thrive in you!

1686
02:15:55,514 --> 02:15:57,573
So what if you are lonely!

1687
02:15:57,649 --> 02:15:59,514
Live alone.

1688
02:15:59,585 --> 02:16:03,248
Live on!

1689
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:08,649
Live on!

1690
02:16:09,228 --> 02:16:12,720
Live on!

1691
02:16:24,076 --> 02:16:28,945
You will find
shade in the sunlight.

1692
02:16:29,014 --> 02:16:33,747
Walk a few steps along with me.

1693
02:16:33,952 --> 02:16:43,224
You will find
happiness in your sorrows!

1694
02:16:43,562 --> 02:16:48,158
Let the oceans of
your pain, thrive in you!

1695
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:52,896
Let the oceans of
your pain, thrive in you!

1696
02:16:53,205 --> 02:16:55,230
So what if you are lonely!

1697
02:16:55,307 --> 02:16:57,241
Live alone.

1698
02:16:57,309 --> 02:17:00,767
Live on!

1699
02:17:01,913 --> 02:17:06,179
Live on!

1700
02:17:07,586 --> 02:17:08,644
We have to live on..

1701
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:12,121
We have to live on,
even after dying.

1702
02:17:12,257 --> 02:17:16,250
We have to live on,
even after dying.

1703
02:17:16,328 --> 02:17:19,991
Live on!

1704
02:17:20,999 --> 02:17:25,595
Live on!

1705
02:17:26,204 --> 02:17:29,605
Live on!

1706
02:17:31,143 --> 02:17:37,776
Live on!

1707
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:42,348
Live on!
