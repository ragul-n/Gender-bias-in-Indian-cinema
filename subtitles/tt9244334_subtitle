1
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,653
Kumaran, you're being
too miserly here.

2
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:51,468
If I say any further, I'll....
- Master, talk to her, please.

3
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:53,775
This Tresyamma has been doing
this job for 30 years now.

4
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:56,612
I have conducted around 200
weddings as well. In many ways!

5
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:59,000
But this is the first time
something so cheap has happened.

6
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,525
This wedding was not fixed
yesterday or today, right?

7
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,781
But now, it's like you're searching for
a ground when you feel like shitting!

8
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:07,149
Tresyamma has a point, President.

9
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:08,336
My dear Tresyamma,

10
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:11,351
if a girl's wedding doesn't
happen in the name of dowry,

11
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,375
it's the people here
who are disgraced.

12
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,399
Dowry?

13
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,532
Manoharetta!

14
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:22,946
Chetta, move it fast.
- Where were you, Kunjatta?

15
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,540
I've been waiting for so long.

16
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:26,814
Here.

17
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,563
I'll give now.

18
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,501
Hey!

19
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,586
Didn't you hear that old
hag shouting over there?

20
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,040
Ask her to get lost!

21
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,265
Dude, you...!

22
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,329
Fish!

23
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,829
Brewed fish!

24
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:56,838
It's a great cure for bronchitis!

25
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,034
Come here.
- What is it?

26
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:11,395
Please.

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,702
Nuisance!
Hold this.

28
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,056
Okay!

29
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:18,307
Why did you call me?

30
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:22,103
I've been wanting to say something to
you for many days now, Anila dear.

31
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:24,071
Don't you have any
shame, Satheeshetta?

32
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:26,468
On the wedding eve of the
girl you were going after,

33
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:28,774
you're trying the same tricks
on her younger sister?

34
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:31,030
Well, I had a different
approach towards Anitha.

35
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:33,622
Oh no!
- Are you going? Stop, Anitha.

36
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:35,193
I mean, Anila.

37
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:36,225
Listen to me.

38
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,459
Continue, Satheeshan.

39
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:42,249
Say it... Don't be afraid.

40
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:45,410
Her elder brother is asking, right?
Say it!  - I don't have anything to say!

41
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,283
I'm getting tensed seeing all this.
- Watch & learn!

42
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:50,880
It's your wedding next month, right?

43
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,036
Welcome!

44
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,481
There's your father.

45
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:55,927
Welcome! Welcome!

46
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:59,428
Look who's standing here proudly!
- Come here.

47
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,419
Hey! I'll have a couple
of drinks today.

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,638
Just 2 drinks!
- That's all!

49
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:13,715
You rascal! I know what
your intentions are!

50
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,068
For now, the bride's brother should
stand here & welcome the guests.

51
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,553
Where are you going, dad?
- Let me go have a couple of drinks!

52
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:20,194
Aren't you my sweetheart?
- Okay! Go!

53
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,145
Let this be an auspicious start!

54
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,184
Cheers!

55
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:29,645
Where did she go?

56
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,923
Won't you come early tomorrow?
The auspicious time is at 8.30 AM.

57
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:35,426
I'll come.
- Let's go together.

58
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,082
Shalini!

59
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,113
Don't you have a petromax lamp?
- During the wedding eve!

60
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,363
Go and check the fuse!

61
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:43,422
Isn't it dark? Shall I check after the
power is back? - Go & check, I say!

62
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:45,206
You'll drive me crazy!

63
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:49,627
Josetta, will you
sort it anytime soon?

64
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,396
I'll sort it out right away!
- You needn't keep saying it.

65
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,626
1... 2... 3...
- Phew! Thank God!

66
00:04:56,677 --> 00:04:57,970
Okay, Chetta.
- Bye, Chetta.

67
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,054
Manoharan, is there
anything left at home?

68
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,936
This Josettan is too much!

69
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,067
Kunjatta...

70
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,767
Dude...

71
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:12,271
There is some problem.

72
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,583
Master...

73
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,786
Look.

74
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,748
What is it, Master?

75
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,329
She's gone!

76
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:35,912
Without telling anyone,
Anitha left.

77
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,547
How can we stand idle, Master!

78
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,769
Shouldn't we bring her back?

79
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:43,308
Come, Master.

80
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:44,907
No!

81
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,106
You should be here.

82
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,905
Master, she will listen to me.

83
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,027
Manoharan!
You should stay here.

84
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:54,294
Leave me, Master.

85
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:55,835
Son...

86
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,287
It's not just one
person who's gone!

87
00:05:58,862 --> 00:05:59,862
It's two people!

88
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,061
  - Dad!!

89
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:06,318
Dad! Get up, dad!

90
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:08,639
Dad!

91
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:11,820
Open your eyes, dad!

92
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,503
Dad!

93
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,706
Open your eyes, dad!

94
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:22,323
'May the eyes not turn moist'

95
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,524
'May the mind not falter'

96
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:28,830
'Don't be weak even for a
moment, O dear flower'

97
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:31,280
'Up in the sky,
beyond the clouds'

98
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,916
'As a symbol of mercy'

99
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:37,821
'There is the light of the moon shining
bright for you, always with you'

100
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,584
'While you close your eyes daily'

101
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:47,357
'I shall sing as the breeze
of the country roads'

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,302
'I'll caress you as the finger of sun rays,
to wake you up in the morning'

103
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:55,551
Master...

104
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,401
We have a marquee and
chairs here already, right?

105
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,690
Master...

106
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:03,862
This wasn't supposed
to end this way!

107
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:12,640
Ask those who went in search of her,
 to come back, Master.

108
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,413
No one has to come
back here now.

109
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,155
Son...

110
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:44,748
'When your feet burn on the path of fire,
I'll shower as a rain upon you from my heart'

111
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:49,433
'I shall awaken within you,
as hundred wings'

112
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:53,807
'To cross the distances of time'

113
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:58,573
'I shall be the food in your hands'

114
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:02,954
'To feed the little
dove, on her lips'

115
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:07,493
'I shall be the shadow of your life,
without moving away even for a second'

116
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:15,287
'Continue the journey of your life,
rise up as much you dreamt'

117
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:22,099
It's difficult to leave this house
with this girl, one fine morning...

118
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,075
But I'm helpless, Manoharan.

119
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:27,778
One month.
I can't extend it any further, son.

120
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:30,160
Ikka, some more time?
- I'm helpless, dear.

121
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:36,513
I'll pay some money for the
time being and handle Ithakka.

122
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,232
You go ahead.
- Okay, Master.

123
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:44,970
'I shall wait for you at this courtyard,

124
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:50,036
for you to perform rituals
of my death anniversary'

125
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,596
'I shall write lessons
with the font of love'

126
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:59,037
'In each chapter of life'

127
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:03,691
'To hold on to while
you fall down'

128
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:08,305
'As a pillar of memories at
the edge of the verandah'

129
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,776
'I shall be the shadow of your life,
without moving away even for a second'

130
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:20,016
'Continue the journey of your life,
rise up as much you dreamt'

131
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:33,578
'O lovely cloud, Shyama...
Come to me, with your message of love'

132
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:36,945
Some people here are throwing so much
attitude, ever since their wedding got fixed.

133
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:39,555
Don't act so tough, Shyama.
The boat will topple.

134
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:44,655
And, if you have any doubts about
marriage, just ask this Satheeshettan.

135
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,028
I'll clear everything.

136
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,804
Go and clear it for your wife,
you rascal!

137
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:53,707
Girls look really beautiful
when they are angry!

138
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:59,901
Oh no!
He seems to be quite angry!

139
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,112
I think the weather
would turn quite bad!

140
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,116
Would there be rain and thunder?

141
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:07,460
There won't be rain,
but thunder is confirmed!

142
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,944
Chetta, can you take me
to a different bank?

143
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,522
Wherever I take you,
you'll get what you deserve!

144
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,530
He is coming.
Don't let him get away.

145
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,085
Let him get down.

146
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,363
Don't jump! If you jump, I'll
come swimming & catch you!

147
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,388
Come here!

148
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:23,558
Should I?

149
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:27,016
Manoharan!

150
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,768
You're angry that I didn't visit
you after your dad died, right?

151
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,999
Leave me.
- Don't say anything. Let's have a tea.

152
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:34,671
Take your hands off!
- Come with me!

153
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,679
What's the point saying that it's
the famous Madayimattam house?

154
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:39,723
If the girl is wayward,
it's done for, right?

155
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:42,880
It's been a while since both of them
have been going around in Aleppey.

156
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,238
Everything that had to happen has
already happened. That's what I heard.

157
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:48,186
You hag! If you speak any further,
I'll chop off your tongue!

158
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:49,401
Whom are you trying to scare?

159
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,868
It's the family which should stop
the girl from going wayward.

160
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,322
You have a younger sister, right? Who knows
who all she would go with? - You hag!

161
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,891
I'll...
- No, Manoharetta!

162
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,579
Leave him! Let me see
what he will do!

163
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:03,968
If you want to see how weddings of girls
from good families are conducted,

164
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,509
come for Sukumaran's
daughter's wedding next week.

165
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:08,129
I'll save a plate for you!

166
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:10,000
To hog and go!
- Leave me!

167
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,680
Whom are you staring at?

168
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:12,758
Get lost!

169
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,038
You bloody hag!

170
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,397
Aren't you done yet?
- Yes.

171
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:31,848
You go ahead.
- Aren't you coming?

172
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,660
No.
You go and give it.

173
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,156
Hi ladies!

174
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,112
Chechi!

175
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:50,558
Move away!

176
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:10,174
Manoharetta,
there's a big problem.

177
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,424
This wedding won't happen.

178
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,778
What is it? - The bride has
Saturn's curse in her horoscope.

179
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,841
Sukumarettan fixed the wedding,
hiding that fact.

180
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:18,551
Knowing that, the groom's family
and villagers have come here.

181
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:22,633
You could have mentioned
it to them, Sukumaretta.

182
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:24,087
But now...

183
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:25,766
Manoharan...

184
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:29,219
During the match making, I had told
everything privately to the groom.

185
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,661
He said he doesn't
have any problem!

186
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,488
What more can I do, son?

187
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,254
Come.

188
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:45,707
We'll sort it out.

189
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:48,879
Master...

190
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,575
I'll tell you one solution.

191
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:54,044
I've spoken to them & arrived
at a compromise. - What is it?

192
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:58,148
Well, if you're ready to make some
more offers regarding the dowry,

193
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:00,702
this wedding will happen on time,
as promised.

194
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,612
Otherwise? - How can you say this
at this last moment, Tresyamma?

195
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,362
I borrowed money from
everywhere I could,

196
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,183
and sold everything I had,
to conduct this wedding.

197
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:13,539
What's remaining is this house,
and 10 cents of land.

198
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,284
Then you can write it in
the groom's name, right?

199
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,201
So, shall I give them your word?

200
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:23,537
Where will I go with my wife,
and my two younger daughters?

201
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:25,351
Then you sit here,
hugging your house!

202
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,634
Let her and her younger
sisters remain unmarried,

203
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:29,596
and talk about their poverty to
each other, for their whole lives.

204
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:31,652
Tresyamma, how can
you talk like this?

205
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:34,029
People are listening!
- Let them listen!

206
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:37,052
Master, I just told him
the only solution left.

207
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,522
That's awesome!

208
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,194
15 sovereigns and now
the house and the land around!

209
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:44,194
You've won a bumper, Tresyamma!

210
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:48,032
Well, when the dowry is increased,
your commission would also increase, right?

211
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:50,867
We need a treat!
- Who invited you here?

212
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:53,830
Didn't you invite me here, specially?

213
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,533
To hog and go!

214
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:57,753
And, for the information
of the guests who've come,

215
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,409
We don't have any girls here, whose curses
will be cured if we pay more dowry,

216
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,156
to be married away
from this village!

217
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,579
Who are you to say that?

218
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:07,063
Just because you're sad that
your sister eloped with someone,

219
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:08,829
are you trying to stop
others' weddings?

220
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:11,016
We'll decide what will happen here.

221
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,731
What if we're not getting the
girl married to him? - Manoharan!

222
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,394
Calm down, Sukumaretta.

223
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:18,238
You said everything to that
schmuck who's going to marry her,

224
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:19,697
and he agreed to
everything, right?

225
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:21,182
Then what's the problem?

226
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:23,307
So the groom is also
involved in this?

227
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:24,870
Or let them say that's not true.

228
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,495
It's not the groom who takes
decisions, back in our town.

229
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,796
It is the elders in his family.

230
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:31,633
We're not getting our girl
married to such a wimp!

231
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:34,037
If you're so smart,
you bring a groom!

232
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,235
What?
Cat caught your tongue?

233
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,469
Bring a smart guy who'll marry a
girl with the Saturn's curse.

234
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:45,805
If you can't, stop
blabbering and get lost!

235
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:02,198
There's a daring young
man in this town man,

236
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:05,096
who will marry her without
taking a single penny as dowry!

237
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:06,891
You want to see him?

238
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:09,226
Master...

239
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:10,374
Satheeshan!

240
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,147
Bro, I won't do it again.
- Don't be scared.

241
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:17,351
Come, Satheeshan.

242
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,444
Come, walk.

243
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,037
Walk, Satheeshan!

244
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:22,780
Lalithechi?
- Yes.

245
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:27,014
You don't have any objections
to this marriage, right?

246
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:29,642
Well...

247
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,789
Marriage?
Whose marriage?

248
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:34,357
Your marriage!
- Get lost, Manoharan!

249
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,086
Marriage, it seems!

250
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,758
I want to see how you'll get him
married without his consent.

251
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:41,923
You don't agree to marry this girl, right?
- No way!

252
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:52,809
I agree.
- He has agreed.

253
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,524
Really?
- She has Saturn's curse!

254
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,908
It's just a horoscope issue,
and not an ill repute, right?

255
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:58,933
Get me married!

256
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:21,603
'Dance, O' snake'

257
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:24,010
'Dance, O' snake'

258
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:27,573
I realized only now that the
Saturn’s curse is true.

259
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:28,675
Shut up, man!

260
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:31,505
'Satheeshan, tie the wedding
necklace on her neck!'

261
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,701
I didn't think twice.
Why?

262
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:36,628
Who said it?

263
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,160
Manoharan!

264
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:39,990
My very own Manoharettan!

265
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,719
Bro, have a drink!

266
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,203
It's my first night, right?
I will sleep off!

267
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,108
It was better to trade
this house & land instead!

268
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:53,067
He will sell all of it very soon!
Watch out!

269
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,505
Manoharan, keep this.
- What is this, Sukumaretta?

270
00:16:57,247 --> 00:17:00,167
This is for my happiness.
- I didn't do it for money.

271
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,183
Son, if a girl child is born,

272
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,594
her father will sleep peacefully,

273
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:09,766
only on the day he can trust that
she was married to a good guy.

274
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,453
Sukumaran will sleep peacefully tonight.
- For the last time.

275
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:17,344
Master, you were here?
Everything is ready there!

276
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,727
Come on!

277
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:19,891
This guy!

278
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,278
This? - They were going to buy a
coffin with this, right? Keep it.

279
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,681
Go! Go! Go!

280
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:35,245
Bro, one more drink!
- No! Get going!

281
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,746
Go outside and drink!
- What is this, man?

282
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,429
Is he going to wrestle or what?

283
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:43,655
Manoharetta...

284
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,206
Such a disaster!

285
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:49,583
Manoharetta, Shyama
chechi is calling you.

286
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,667
Might be to thank you.
Go, Manoharetta.

287
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:00,569
You needn't thank me...
- Really, Manoharetta...

288
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,593
You'll be seeing my dead
body tomorrow!

289
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,739
Shyama, I did it for your good!

290
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:06,437
Here's the milk, dear.

291
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:09,201
Go give it to him.

292
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:21,406
Good night!

293
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,730
'First Night'

294
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:47,640
With that night, Manoharan changed the
destiny of Mullakkara village forever.

295
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:51,256
Manoharan became the synonym
for weddings to them.

296
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,858
Mullakkara's very own Manoharettan.

297
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,975
The youngsters of the village
shortened his beautiful name,

298
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,413
Madayimattam Manoharan,
to Ma-Ma.

299
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:03,626
For the past 22 years, Manoharettan
has been conducting marriages,

300
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:09,029
of all the girls who didn't elope, have a
love marriage or never even fell in love.

301
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:13,056
A wedding day at Mullakkara,
after all the changes it went through.

302
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,588
I told him so many times...

303
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,963
He has come with a stupid bouquet!
- We're all ready. We will leave now.

304
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:24,310
Oh God! You aren't ready yet?

305
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:26,130
Why are you sitting here like this?

306
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,716
Calm down, girl.
- I'm not coming.

307
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,816
Wear that dress, at least.
It's time to go to the Church.

308
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:34,732
Don't think I'll come for the wedding
holding this stupid bouquet!

309
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:36,160
You can go and marry
if you want to, aunty!

310
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,240
For that, your uncle has to die.

311
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,014
Look at this, aunty.

312
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,364
I just asked to buy
one like this, right?

313
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:46,007
That's Priyanka Chopra's bouquet.
Do you know how much it costs?

314
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:49,847
I don't want to know anything.
I need this bouquet! That's a must!

315
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,743
These girls...
Hey Maria!

316
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,985
You're still putting make-up here? Your
daughter is still not ready. You know that?

317
00:19:57,673 --> 00:19:59,096
Apply that as well, boy.

318
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,247
This woman! Hey! It's time
to leave to the Church.

319
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,749
Look at that face,
trying to get make up on!

320
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,319
Hey! Both the bride and her
mother are not ready yet!

321
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,217
The boat to the Church
hasn't come either.

322
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,915
And you, her uncle, is standing
here, looking at the sky?

323
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,986
All that will happen.

324
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,595
I'm wondering what
to do about this.

325
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,484
But still..
- Aunty, you calm down.

326
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,531
If it is Manoharettan who's
handling this wedding,

327
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,960
everything will happen right on time.
- I hope so.

328
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:33,474
Father...

329
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,356
It was you?

330
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:39,130
After taking up all the work,
where did Manoharan go?

331
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,269
My dear Chetta, there are not just 1
or 2 weddings today. There are three!

332
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:43,827
And there is only
one Manoharettan!

333
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,405
Come, Father Siby.
Let's sit inside.

334
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,296
Hey! Where are you going?
Come here.

335
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,468
Had I known Hindi,
I'd have killed you!

336
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,931
Hey! Don't do a job which you don't know.
Which is the coconut tree?

337
00:20:55,994 --> 00:20:56,994
That one.

338
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:00,992
All this should have been
done earlier, Johnnykkutty.

339
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:03,296
Climbing coconut trees on the
morning of the wedding day?

340
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,625
Namaste.

341
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,358
Hey! This is the blouse you gave
to Molly Chechi for stitching.

342
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:09,363
Here are your jasmine
flowers, aunty.

343
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:21,022
Lisa, dear... - Wow.
- Here's the bouquet.

344
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,530
Get ready quickly!
- But where's the beautician?

345
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:26,695
He didn't come yet?
Oh my God!

346
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:29,357
You...!!

347
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,859
When a new movie that's supposed
to release today is waiting there,

348
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:35,864
you're polishing this old print?
Go!

349
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,633
All of you get ready, please!

350
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:48,786
Josetta, call the bride.

351
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,279
Call her.
- Oh no!

352
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,595
Sister, I can't find her here.

353
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:55,846
Oh no! My daughter is gone!
God! My daughter is missing!

354
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:58,519
Aunty, keep quiet.
She would be here. Let me see.

355
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,457
Where did this girl go?

356
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:02,634
Smile.
- Like this?

357
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:04,042
A little more.
- Hey!

Oh my God!

359
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,463
Get in, Chechi.
Get in, kids.

360
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:10,706
We're running late!
Get in!

361
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,112
Kunjatta, where is Manoharan?

362
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:32,546
Manoharettan is here.

363
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,484
Manoharetta!
- Everything is okay, right?

364
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:35,664
All okay!
- Lift me up.

365
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:37,219

366
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:40,323
Won't you park the
boat & come fast?

367
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:42,028
It's time for the wedding.
- Manoharetta!

368
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:43,302
What is it?

369
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:44,755
Manoharetta, the wedding
won't happen, it seems.

370
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,734
This is not the first time, right?
Tell me the matter.

371
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:48,697
That Father Murikken
is really angry.

372
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:50,580
It's the Father, right?
- Yes.

373
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,674
I don't have anything
more to say, Kuriakose!

374
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,722
If they are so adamant,
let them get married at some other Church!

375
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:58,319
But they should find some
other Church to be buried at!

376
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,037
How can you say so at
this last moment, Father?

377
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,948
When I asked her to say the
prayer two weeks back,

378
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,293
she sent the prayer on WhatsApp.

379
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:08,613
Then why don't we do the wedding, Holy
Communion and everything else on WhatsApp?

380
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,599
WhatsApp expert, it seems!

381
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,756
So it's not fair
to blame Father.

382
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,342
But Father...
- No way!

383
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:16,084
No way! No way!
No way!

384
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:19,800
If there is a man who's daring enough
to defy me and conduct this marriage,

385
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,257
 in this Mullakkara,

386
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:22,894
I'd like to see him!

387
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,090
I'll show you!

388
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:25,747
Please move.

389
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,107
Manoharan, don't interfere
in Church matters.

390
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:31,862
This is your problem, Vicar.
You get too emotional for silly matters.

391
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:33,912
Manoharan!
- I'm not interfering!

392
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:36,091
The Changanassery Diocese
can intervene, right?

393
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:47,372
If the Bishop has said so from the Diocese,
there's nothing else to think about.

394
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:49,522
The Diocese is more important
than everything else, right?

395
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:51,795
Wedding is at 11.30 AM.
Don't forget to wear your vestment.

396
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:54,384
Father has agreed.
- All of you, go to the Church.

397
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:55,550
Aren't you happy now?

398
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:57,635
You're happy, right?
- Of course.

399
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,292
Really happy!
So relieved now.

400
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,331
Manoharetta!

401
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:02,802
You are quite something!

402
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:05,266
Are there any priests who
won't fall for the Diocese?

403
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,352

matter, Manoharetta?'

to decide, after that.

00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:23,937
I know that.

509
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,141
Where did this come from?
Is it a letter bomb?

510
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,843
My dearest Smitha, your thoughts
create waves in my heart.

511
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:36,317
If Puthenthode is for the Vattakkayal lake,
Smitha is for Ashwin.

512
00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:37,631
Such disciplined kids!

513
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:40,436
Turn it off!

514
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:43,045
The sovereignty of the king...

515
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:45,474
The supremacy of the nobility,

516
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:48,894
and the privileges of the
Catholic priesthood.

517
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:55,745
The French Revolution was an 18th century
(1789–1799) political and social revolt

518
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:04,339
that transformed the French system of
enlightenment based on the above mentioned.

519
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:10,467
The trial and execution of the king was
a critical event in the revolution

520
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,093
Say it!

521
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:17,344
Say it again! If Puthenthode
is for Vattakkayal? Say it!

522
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:19,285
Will you write so again?
- Enough, Kunjatta.

523
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,837
If you both do such
mischief again...

524
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,688
Get lost!

525
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:25,110
You too!
- Phew! Saved!

526
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,425
Don't go!

527
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:27,926
You go with her, Master.

528
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,395
Come.

529
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:32,381
- Leave my hand, Master.
- What is this, Teacher?

530
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:34,271
Are you teaching
the kids here to shoot?

531
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:36,412
What can I do?
Those kids are mischievous!

532
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,816
And Manoharetta.... My salary?

533
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,153
Is that the big deal here?

534
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:43,560
To get me tensed in vain
and spoil my mood!

535
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:46,625
Do you know how many teachers run
their families without salary?

536
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:47,821
Right?
- Of course.

537
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:50,337
Sreemathi teacher... Shashikala teacher...
Shylaja teacher... Deepa teacher...

538
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:51,750
Shyamala teacher..
- I don't know about that.

539
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:54,903
The one who can realize the development
dreams of Mullakkara village,

540
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:57,264
the pride of our village,

541
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,747
Puthenpuraykkal Kunjumon sir presents,

542
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:02,584
with world class facilities,

543
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,864
the first houseboat service in India with
a swimming pool, is being launched...

544
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:11,490
Swimming pool?

545
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,599
Water must have filled up due
to a hole in the boat.

546
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:14,758
Swimming pool, it seems!

547
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:17,570
But Kunjumon's growth
is something else!

548
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:20,567
He was a kid who used to run
around here, wearing shorts.

549
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:22,664
He went to the Middle
East and made money!

550
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:24,612
Why say more?

551
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:27,602
He's the 'King of the lake'
in this village, right?

552
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:30,893
When is he getting married?
- Tomorrow!

553
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,683
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

554
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,457
Tomorrow?
His wedding?

555
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:37,286
Not wedding! Kerala Fortune Lottery
results will be out tomorrow.

556
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:39,770
And...
Kunjumon's wedding!

557
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:41,134
No one has to dream about it.

558
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,385
I'll conduct that wedding.
Right, Ambrose?

559
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,392
Of course.
- What about Manoharan then?

560
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,322
Yeah right!
Manoharan!

561
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:51,159
It's not like the alliances he
brings from this locality! - Then?

562
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:55,643
This Tresyamma has already found
out a great alliance for Kunjumon.

563
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:58,535
He just has to give his approval...

564
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,868
Then, this Tresyamma will conduct it.

565
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:03,245
The biggest wedding
of this village.

566
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:07,214
With that, Manoharan
will be out of work!

567
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,081
Move!

568
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:11,311
Sit here.

569
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,033
Enough of your reading!
You don't have an exam tomorrow, right?

570
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,463
Manoharan....

571
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,580
I heard that Father
Murikken gave you trouble

572
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:22,745
during Mamoottil Antony's
daughter's wedding?

573
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,546
Finally, you sorted it by getting a letter
from the Changanassery Diocese, right?

574
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:29,627
You have influence at
the Diocese too, huh?

575
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:30,916
Diocese?
- Yes.

576
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,047
Manoharettan even tried
to call Vatican!

577
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:35,298
Then? - He didn't have balance
talk time on his phone.

578
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,422
Vatican, it seems!

579
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:42,144
One who hasn't seen Vagathanam
is going to call Vatican? Get lost!

580
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:43,775
Anyway, the wedding was awesome.

581
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,589
Does that need to be
said out loud, Josetta?

582
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,024
Ever since some people
have gone out of field,

583
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:51,431
which wedding that Mullakkara Manoharettan
conducted has been bad? Tell me!

584
00:33:51,456 --> 00:33:54,822
Hey! Get two cups of tea,
with a lot of froth!

585
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:57,063
Some people here like it that way!

586
00:33:57,254 --> 00:34:00,896
Lottery ban, under the consideration
of the Government. - Is it?

587
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:03,029
Some people would be
in trouble, Chetta.

588
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:06,764
Manoharetta, don't mock someone
on their face like this.

589
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:11,129
After all, we need to show some respect
to people who're so old, right?

590
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,725
Stop it!
Enough!

591
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:14,733
What? - Enough.
- Let him say it, Ambrose.

592
00:34:14,758 --> 00:34:17,592
He's the darling here, right?
The MaMa of the villagers!

593
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,414
You hag!
Just sit idle at some place!

594
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:23,649
If you say something about my Manoharettan,
I'll break your back! - Do it, then!

595
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,556
Try hitting her!
- What will you do?

596
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:27,181
Satheeshan, calm down.

597
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,022
After all,

598
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:31,960
isn't he a token of remembrance of
the last wedding that she conducted?

599
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,399
Let him sit there.
- Hey!

600
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:34,561
No! No!

601
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,695
Though my wife
eloped with someone,

602
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:38,429
he is taking real
good care of her.

603
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:39,671
And it's my personal life!

604
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,578
Don't try to mess with that!

605
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:43,357
It's okay, Ambrose.

606
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,568
She will find a good girl for you!

607
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:47,544
By the way, did she have a kid yet?
- Yes.

608
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,637
Two kids.
- Pillai Chetta, here's the money.

609
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:52,176
Move your tummy!

610
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:54,302
With the change, buy a lottery
ticket & tear it off!

611
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:57,078
You can't buy it once
it's banned, right?

612
00:34:57,103 --> 00:34:58,887
Manoharetta, you go ahead.
I will be here.

613
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:00,242
Go to your shop!

614
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:03,658
Don't laugh too much!

615
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,391
It's out of his love for me.
- Hey! Hey!

616
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,004
Get lost!
- I'll get back at you later!

617
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:08,744
Love, it seems!

618
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:21,112
Not here!

619
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,216
I'll break both your legs!

620
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,779
I'm fed up with you guys!

621
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:29,579
Not us!

622
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:31,126
Started in the morning itself!

623
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:33,321
I'll bash both of you up!

624
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:35,072
Started shouting in
the morning itself?

625
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:38,376
Go inside & play!

626
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:39,838
Go!

627
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,569
Why are you looking
at me like this?

628
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,199
Manoharetta, if it goes on
like this, I'll kill myself.

629
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:50,520
I'll kill myself for sure.
- Tell me the matter.

630
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,231
The elder one is old
enough to be married.

631
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:54,962
When someone comes for an alliance
with her, if they ask for her mother,

632
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,892
we'd have to say that she
has just given birth!

633
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,377
Two Dosas...
- What?

634
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Well, Dosa...

635
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:02,323
Here.

636
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:03,721
Here's the chutney.

637
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:09,039
My dear Shyama,
please stop crying!

638
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:12,505
Isn't he taking real
good care of you & kids?

639
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:14,519
Isn't he running the shop well?

640
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:17,498
Isn't he taking care of your parents too?
Then what?

641
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,123
How can I ask a husband
not to love his own wife?

642
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:24,271
Oh no! Ask him not to love me like this.
- Like what?

643
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,450
Like this.

644
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:27,999
Then I'll have to ask him to
keep the shop open at night too.

645
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,414
Or, shall we get goons to hit him,
and get him paralyzed below his hip?

646
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,930
Hey!  - Only if you want it.
- He won't be paralyzed so easily.

647
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,846
In a way, you can
be happy, right?

648
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:39,831
He changed his old habits, and he never
looks at any other woman now, right?

649
00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:42,423
Don't worry.
- To be worried, there's someone else here.

650
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,393
A naughty brat who has inherited
her dad's old character.

651
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:48,120
I don't know what's
going to happen to her!

652
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:50,003
Don't worry about
unnecessary things!

653
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,003
It will happen when it's time.

654
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:53,844
Or this Manoharan
will make it happen.

655
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:55,580
You go and rest for now.

656
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:56,998
Rest?

657
00:36:57,045 --> 00:36:59,388
I actually have to rest
for all 365 days now.

658
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:04,598
Unnecessary hurdles!

659
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:09,049
How many months pregnant are you now?
- Eight!

660
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:17,314
Mom, get me a glass of water!

661
00:37:17,774 --> 00:37:20,483
Come and get it if you want.
You're in 10th grade now, right?

662
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:22,814
Won't study a thing,
and watching TV all the time!

663
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:24,751
Turn it off and go
and study, Meenu!

664
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:27,528
I'm fed up of you, mom!
Won't even let me watch a movie!

665
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:29,095
This Mini hasn't gone wayward!

666
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,223
Please forget everything,
and accept me back.

667
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:38,136
Mama (Uncle), didn't
you buy chocolates?

668
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:41,243
Mama? I've told you a 100
times not to call me Mama!

669
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,797
What else will she call her
only uncle, Manoharetta?

670
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:45,667
Either Manoharetta, like
everyone calls me...

671
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,436
Or Manoharan uncle.
Understood?

672
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:49,802
What's happening?
- What?

673
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,418
Will anyone pass from
the tutorial this time?

674
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,052
They might.
- They should!

675
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,920
I'll get that done.
- For the time being,

676
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,523
you needn't teach her.

677
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,921
Master was looking
for you today.

678
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:00,961
Kunjatta told me.

679
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,108
So, once we elope and come back,

680
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:06,225
the families would get us
married quickly, is it?

681
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,170
Hey you!!

682
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:10,779
You're in front of this,
all the time?

683
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:13,276
All the time,
watching this Kunchacko Boban?

684
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:16,490
He's the one who misleads girls!

685
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:19,722
Hey! When it's evening,
go read some book!

686
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:22,420
Or I'll burn all of this,
and rip it apart. Understood?

687
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,099
Shall I get you some
porridge, Manoharetta?

688
00:38:26,142 --> 00:38:27,142
You shall.

689
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,385
I've heard this somewhere!

690
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:50,661
Manoharan!

691
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:52,772
What's happening with
Rameshan's daughter's alliance?

692
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,783
The groom has to come
from Dubai, to fix it!

693
00:38:54,818 --> 00:38:56,836
Chechi, is it enough if you
fetch water like this?

694
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:58,479
Don't you want to
get married again?

695
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,361
Go say that to your aunty!
- What are you doing here?

696
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:02,040
Go to your class!
- Yeah right! Class, it seems!

697
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,509
Let her be here, Manoharan.

698
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:07,023
I don't even get to
see you these days.

699
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,079
My dear teacher,

700
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:11,068
match making, betrothals, weddings, naming
ceremonies, ear-piercing ceremonies...

701
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:12,777
I need to find time in between all
this, right?

702
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:15,174
You're only bothered
about other people.

703
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,783
Do you remember how old you are?

704
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:17,816
Thirty...
- 47.

705
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,635
Can't you tell him
about it, Kunjatta?

706
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,093
So there's no one
to talk about me!

707
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:23,352
I am like Mullaperiyar
dam in the rainy season!

708
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:25,306
Can't say when I would explode!

709
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:28,909
Finally, after exploding, don't blame
Mani Aasan for it. - Get lost.

710
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:31,721
Manoharettan won't get commission
for his own wedding, right?

711
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:33,897
Manoharetta, if you had
married at a young age,

712
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,440
you would have had a
good daughter like me now!

713
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:37,166
That's why I'm not getting married.
Understood?

714
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:39,840
Where were you?
- Here he is.

715
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,109
Who's this?
Unniyarcha?

716
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:43,499
Hey! I've told you a
thousand times...

717
00:39:43,524 --> 00:39:45,546
.. not to come to the kitchen,
wearing this dress.

718
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:47,537
There's a girl of
marriageable age here.

719
00:39:47,724 --> 00:39:48,875
Yeah right!
- Really?

720
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:51,218
I'm ready to get married?
- Not like that.

721
00:39:51,274 --> 00:39:53,000
She must have meant that you
need to be tied up somewhere!

722
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:56,146
I never get to see you these days.
- Yes.

723
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,669
Who else takes care of the
tutorial, fields and farms?

724
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:00,749
Your dad Kumaran!

725
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:02,514
Don't get me talking!
Come.

726
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:03,608
Come here.

727
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:05,253
Swearing at my dad?
- Cutting lentil fruit?

728
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,553
No.
I'm making tea.

729
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:11,962
Did you want to meet me urgently,
to make me apply oil like this?

730
00:40:11,987 --> 00:40:13,110
Get lost!

731
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:16,345
Achu had called from Bangalore.

732
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:18,079
She calls daily, right?

733
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:21,093
I had brought so many
proposals for her!

734
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,272
Then she would say that she
has to finish her studies!

735
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,390
Then how can I?
- Then....

736
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:26,953
Now we can proceed confidently.

737
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:29,045
Her course will get
over this week.

738
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:30,789
Is it?

739
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:33,799
When I said that her studies
is about to be completed,

740
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:35,420
look at his excitement!

741
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:38,028
Hey! She's just finishing her studies.

742
00:40:38,122 --> 00:40:41,226
But before that, we
should find a good groom.

743
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:42,909
My dear Master!

744
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:44,489
What did you think?

745
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,694
I'll get a first class groom for her.

746
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:48,675
Kunjatta!
- Kunjatta?

747
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,778
This guy?

748
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,810
Give it.

749
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,485
Oil, right?
- Moron.

750
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,510
Get the diary!

751
00:40:57,143 --> 00:40:58,143
Look at this.

752
00:40:58,257 --> 00:41:03,230
This is a list of first class grooms,
I've personally found for her.

753
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,992
See!
Look!

754
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:07,313
Do you want a doctor, or an engineer?

755
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:08,494
Or a businessman?

756
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:09,898
Look!
- Where?

757
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:11,006
Let me see.
- Look.

758
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,223
Just check it and tell
me which one you want!

759
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:15,355
Not you. Her.
- Tell him. - You tell him.

760
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,793
You tell him.
- You tell him.

761
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,144
Tell me!

762
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:20,209
Well, Manoharan....

763
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:24,507
We'd like it to be a good groom
from this town itself...

764
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:25,547
Yes.

765
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:27,268
We don't have anyone
else, Manoharan.

766
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,350
That's why...

767
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:30,843
The horse in Sharapanjaram (movie)
will have more gratitude.

768
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:32,613
Wasted my time!
- Hey!

769
00:41:32,638 --> 00:41:35,835
Manoharan, I asked only for
this small thing, right?

770
00:41:36,103 --> 00:41:37,868
Rest everything you
can do as you wish!

771
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:40,065
If so, we should get
her married to someone

772
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,644
who's ready to stay here
after marriage, right?

773
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:42,876
Of course!

774
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:46,234
You know how many losers are there in our
list, ready to stay in the wife's house?

775
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:47,252
Give it here.

776
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:54,005
Look! It's clear from his face, that
he's ready to stay at the wife's house.

777
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,275
Where? Let me see.
- His name is Sachi, from Kochi.

778
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Sheesh! This one?

779
00:41:57,507 --> 00:41:59,620
Sheesh! We don't
need such schmucks!

780
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,909
A fine young man from
this village itself.

781
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:04,876
Are there any fine young
men in this village?

782
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:08,244
Whoever it is, we are okay,
if Manoharan approves.

783
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,515
Such a guy?

784
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:12,116
My dear people!

785
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:16,172
The one who can realize the development
dreams of our Mullakkara village,

786
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:18,489
the pride of our village,

787
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:21,742
Puthenpuraykkal Kunjumon sir presents,

788
00:42:21,778 --> 00:42:23,619
with world class facilities...

789
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:26,090
Like he said, that's
a good proposal!

790
00:42:26,732 --> 00:42:29,351
I've taught him 4
times in 3rd grade.

791
00:42:29,407 --> 00:42:31,663
I've taught him
twice in 6th grade.

792
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:33,695
Total - 12.
So it's plus two!

793
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,929
Sheesh! But he's
not at all tall.

794
00:42:35,975 --> 00:42:38,028
Get lost!
Height doesn't matter.

795
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:39,365
He is good looking!

796
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:41,275
It's not about the
height, Master.

797
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,490
Is it about the length then?

798
00:42:42,533 --> 00:42:43,753
Must be about the weight then!

799
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:45,593
We don't need that.
- Why?

800
00:42:45,617 --> 00:42:47,676
Though he's rich,
he has only studied till 10th grade!

801
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,010
Would that be enough
for our Achu?

802
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:50,238
Hey!

803
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:51,718
When his father died,

804
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,093
I know how the situation
of their family was.

805
00:42:54,544 --> 00:42:57,363
With this 10th grade education,
if he can earn so much...

806
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:58,581
he is really smart!

807
00:42:58,936 --> 00:43:00,183
Extremely smart!

808
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:01,623
But still, Master...

809
00:43:02,004 --> 00:43:03,626
Do we really need it?

810
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:06,344
Anyway, you go there
and do an inquiry.

811
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:09,061
We can know how the situation is, right?

812
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:10,587
- Yes.

813
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,331
Am I hearing the
truth, Manoharan?

814
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,451
What's your opinion, Kamalechi?

815
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:20,821
Do you even have
to ask, Manoharan?

816
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,572
I agree not just 100,
but 200%.

817
00:43:22,597 --> 00:43:23,597
100 is fine!

818
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:25,521
Did Teacher & Master
say anything?

819
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:26,760
Leave all that to us, Chechi.

820
00:43:26,796 --> 00:43:28,078
If you agree,

821
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:29,588
we'll take care of the rest.
Right?

822
00:43:29,613 --> 00:43:30,921
Of course, I agree.

823
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:33,127
I'm ready to host the
wedding even tomorrow.

824
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,595
Not tomorrow.
- But...

825
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,941
Shouldn't we ask him once?

826
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:38,225
That's what.
Where is Kunjumon?

827
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:50,572
His look is fine, right?

828
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:53,798
Has he gone a bit overboard?

829
00:43:54,143 --> 00:43:55,143
No!

830
00:43:55,462 --> 00:43:56,526
Slightly...

831
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,025
It's not like you said.

832
00:43:59,795 --> 00:44:00,922
The price is a little high.

833
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:02,519
And it needs work too.

834
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,183
Okay then!
As we agreed upon!

835
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,390
What's up, Kunjumon?

836
00:44:08,637 --> 00:44:10,058
Looks like you've fixed a deal?

837
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,212
How many boats do you have now?
- This is the fifth.

838
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:14,480
The price is a bit high.
But if I renovate it,

839
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:15,601
it will be awesome.

840
00:44:15,812 --> 00:44:18,437
Those 4 running ones are not
enough during the tourist season.

841
00:44:18,508 --> 00:44:21,404
I heard that you solved the land
encroachment case of the resort,

842
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,991
by paying bribes!

843
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:27,506
That's why the people here call
my boss 'King of the lake'.

844
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,627
Sudhi...
- Let him praise you!

845
00:44:29,851 --> 00:44:31,286
What's happening then?

846
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:32,866
There's a small news for you.

847
00:44:38,223 --> 00:44:40,021
You didn't say anything
about the marriage.

848
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:41,886
Did you have food, Manoharettan?

849
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,262
That time is over, right?

850
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:45,534
It's only 2 PM, right?

851
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,111
I mean, did you have lunch?

852
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:49,652
I'll have it.

853
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:51,595
You didn't say anything
about what I told you.

854
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:53,003
Manoharetta...

855
00:44:53,122 --> 00:44:54,494
I have some dreams.

856
00:44:55,575 --> 00:44:56,947
To reach those dreams,

857
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,007
I will go to any end.

858
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:01,282
Don't go further to the end.
You'll fall into the lake.

859
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:02,307
Sudhi!

860
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:04,793
Or no need.

861
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,385
Not just this marriage...

862
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:09,035
I'm not ready for any marriage,
right now.

863
00:45:09,363 --> 00:45:10,363
Business!

864
00:45:10,555 --> 00:45:13,021
Business is the only thing on my mind now.
- Correct!

865
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,601
I want to grow.

866
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:16,664
Across this lake,

867
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:18,715
there's a world that
you haven't seen!

868
00:45:18,964 --> 00:45:20,647
I want to grow and blossom there too.

869
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:21,649
You may grow!

870
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:24,116
But isn't it good to have someone with you,
to pour water & add manure?

871
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:25,968
It's not that, Manoharetta.

872
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:27,870
A wedding in between
all this rush?

873
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,380
There will be some rush
for the wedding feast.

874
00:45:29,405 --> 00:45:31,215
But we'll see to it that there's
no rush at the Mandapam.

875
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,307
And this wedding is only
for one day, right?

876
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,950
You can grow,
on the rest of the days!

877
00:45:34,977 --> 00:45:35,977
I can...

878
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:38,153
Mom!

879
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:39,333
What is this, Manoharetta?

880
00:45:39,382 --> 00:45:40,802
You won't even let someone grow?

881
00:45:40,827 --> 00:45:43,123
Even otherwise, he's not fully grown yet.
- Shut up!

882
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,189
Yes, son.
She's a really nice girl.

883
00:45:45,313 --> 00:45:46,553
I have seen her.

884
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,735
Sharada Teacher &
Master's grand-daughter.

885
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,478
Agree to it!
- Yes!

886
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,990
Whenever it is, you need to
get married, right Kunjumon?

887
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:55,262
And this is a girl from our village,
and a great family too.

888
00:45:55,287 --> 00:45:56,342
Even your mom approves!

889
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:58,641
Just nod your head,
and I'll take care of the rest!

890
00:45:59,771 --> 00:46:00,937
Agree to it, son!

891
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,117
When all of you are
saying so much,

892
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:04,928
what do I say?

893
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,010
So, as we agreed upon!

894
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,711
Then I'll talk to Master,

895
00:46:07,737 --> 00:46:09,560
and make arrangements
for them to visit you.

896
00:46:09,585 --> 00:46:10,585
Just let us know.

897
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,670
Shall I leave then?

898
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:12,695
Where?

899
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,424
Yes.
I forgot that it's a boat.

900
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,809
There are 4 acres beyond this.

901
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:23,643
And more on this side.
 - A total of 10-12 acres.

902
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,712
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

903
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:28,739
Why did you get late?

904
00:46:29,176 --> 00:46:31,402
Well, we...
- Come, come. Let's go inside.

905
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:32,655
Come. Let's go inside.

906
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:36,582
The construction of an 8000 sq. ft. house
is going on, at the adjacent property.

907
00:46:36,847 --> 00:46:39,956
He saw this house in some Tamil movie,
liked it & bought it for a big price!

908
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,420
Which was that movie?

909
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,526
'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya'.
- Yes.

910
00:46:43,954 --> 00:46:48,782
Ever since he saw 'Titanic', he really
wanted to buy a ship like that.

911
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:51,392
It was me who told him that the
lake wasn't wide enough for that.

912
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:52,666
Sudhi!

913
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:53,968
I swear!

914
00:46:53,993 --> 00:46:55,797
Lucky that he didn't
watch 'Jurassic Park'.

915
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,320
We're thinking of a date after the
construction of the new house is over.

916
00:46:59,437 --> 00:47:00,437
What is it, Master?

917
00:47:02,078 --> 00:47:05,482
If so, shall we fix it before
the coming 'Karkidakam' month?

918
00:47:05,545 --> 00:47:06,545
What say, Manoharan?

919
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:07,733
Well...

920
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,045
Master, one minute.

921
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,164
Come.

922
00:47:17,657 --> 00:47:19,680
Where are they going?
- Show them around the house.

923
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,648
Teacher, let me show
you around the house.

924
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,669
Come.
- They're also going?

925
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:29,483
Come here.

926
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,816
Everyone is leaving?
What happened?

927
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,191
Is the Jilebi (sweet) not good?

928
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:37,245
How can you alone decide
about the wedding?

929
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,270
Any problem?

930
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:40,235
What about the other stuff?
- Is it about the feast?

931
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:41,282
No!

932
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,692
Seeing the bride!

933
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:43,893
You can see her always
after the wedding, right?

934
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:45,403
Then don't say that
you've had enough!

935
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:48,580
Isn't there a ceremony like that,
before the wedding?

936
00:47:48,871 --> 00:47:50,556
It's my only wedding, right?

937
00:47:50,643 --> 00:47:53,493
Understood. You can meet Achu the
day after she comes from Bangalore.

938
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:54,816
Sure?
- Sure!

939
00:47:55,596 --> 00:47:56,801
Two years?

940
00:47:56,891 --> 00:47:58,018
What are you saying, Master?

941
00:47:58,222 --> 00:47:59,574
What can I do?

942
00:47:59,902 --> 00:48:01,307
She had called this morning.

943
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,331
She wants to join for a
PG course, it seems.

944
00:48:03,471 --> 00:48:04,913
She said she cleared the entrance,

945
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:07,202
and that the classes
will begin next week.

946
00:48:07,297 --> 00:48:09,156
That's all?
I got really scared.

947
00:48:09,544 --> 00:48:11,637
She can continue her studies
even after marriage, right?

948
00:48:11,685 --> 00:48:13,318
He's not a guy who'll
have a problem with that.

949
00:48:13,343 --> 00:48:14,506
Let the ceremony happen now.

950
00:48:14,796 --> 00:48:17,538
Hey! You just talk to
her over the phone.

951
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:19,576
This has to be discussed
in person, to sort it out.

952
00:48:19,788 --> 00:48:21,164
Her exams will get over
tomorrow anyway, right?

953
00:48:21,203 --> 00:48:22,647
I'll go there myself and bring her.

954
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:26,176
I'll go in person, make her
understand everything, and bring her!

955
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:28,589
She will understand when I say it.

956
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:29,951
Don't worry, Master.

957
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:31,611
Let the ceremony happen for now.

958
00:48:31,731 --> 00:48:32,731
Okay.
- Come.

959
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:36,750
So, everything as
we agreed upon!

960
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:41,258
The wedding between them has been fixed
on an auspicious day, next month.

961
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:43,563
So, let everything be beautiful!

962
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,977
So be it.
- One selfie, please.

963
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:46,696
Am I there in it?

964
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:52,159
And your last hope is also gone!

965
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:55,214
It is Manoharan who's
conducting Kunjumon's marriage.

966
00:48:55,794 --> 00:48:57,323
That too, with Master's
granddaughter.

967
00:48:57,348 --> 00:48:59,300
Can a bigger wedding
happen in this village?

968
00:48:59,442 --> 00:49:00,783
You are done for, Tresyamma!

969
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:02,033
Don't say that!

970
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:03,635
She has lottery with her, right?

971
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,049
What if she wins it?

972
00:49:05,104 --> 00:49:08,658
Or if you really work hard,
you can get this Ambrose married!

973
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,392
I'm only destined
to raise the cattle.

974
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:11,807
Someone else is
drinking the milk!

975
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:14,147
Enough!
Don't show off too much!

976
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:17,893
The sun is not going to rise in the west,
with this one night, right?

977
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:19,924
Let's see!

978
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:22,674
Hey! Did you know?

979
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:24,876
Our Mama & Kunjatta are leaving.
- Where to?

980
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:26,142
To Bangalore.

981
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:29,147
Remember everything I told you?

982
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:32,455
Give Nanuettan the money for painting,
and for cleaning the fields.

983
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:34,705
And pay the advance for the
wedding feast as well.

984
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,002
I'll do all that.
You go without any worry!

985
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,227
I'm not worried at all.

986
00:49:38,294 --> 00:49:39,971
But when I come back after 2 days,
all this should be done.

987
00:49:39,996 --> 00:49:41,074
Don't worry.
I'll do everything.

988
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,113
Then...
Just because I'm not here,

989
00:49:43,138 --> 00:49:46,355
never allow the boys and
girls here to mingle!

990
00:49:46,426 --> 00:49:47,426
Hey!

991
00:49:52,485 --> 00:49:55,345
After snatching away everything else,
you've snatched this big one too?

992
00:49:55,604 --> 00:49:56,604
Remember one thing!

993
00:49:57,217 --> 00:50:00,378
As long as this Tresyamma is alive,
this wedding won't happen.

994
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:01,468
I won't let it happen!

995
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:04,948
From here on,
I'm re-writing your horoscope!

996
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,252
You started writing
horoscopes now?

997
00:50:07,816 --> 00:50:10,924
Chedathi, it's been 22 years
since I started this job,

998
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:12,105
and since you stopped it.

999
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:14,013
So, mark your calendar.

1000
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,608
If I have given the word,

1001
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:18,731
on the date and time agreed upon,

1002
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:21,095
this Manoharan will conduct
their wedding... - beautifully!

1003
00:50:22,265 --> 00:50:23,522
Let's see!
- Let's see!

1004
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:25,699
Awesome, Manoharetta.

1005
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:29,145
I can see properly now.

1006
00:50:29,754 --> 00:50:31,691
So, see you after I come back.
- Yes.

1007
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:35,364
Nice.
Where did you steal it from?

1008
00:50:35,582 --> 00:50:37,160
I bought it during the festival.

1009
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:38,185
Manoharetta...

1010
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:40,630
Come back soon.

1011
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:42,106
Go to your shop!

1012
00:50:43,777 --> 00:50:45,291
It's out of love.
- I can see that.

1013
00:50:45,316 --> 00:50:47,455
Shall we sit inside?
- No. Let 4 people see us!

1014
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,886
4 people?
Who are they?

1015
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,070
He has actually left, man!

1016
00:51:05,102 --> 00:51:06,280
Now we'll have a blast!

1017
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
Yaay!

1018
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:05,757
Can't get through to her.

1019
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:07,279
Where do we search for her now?

1020
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:08,740
Give me her photo.

1021
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:10,421
Keep trying her on
the phone, okay?

1022
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:11,703
Don't go missing!

1023
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,086
Who won't go missing here?

1024
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:14,359
This girl...
Sorry.

1025
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:16,812
This girl..
Do you know her?

1026
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:18,368
From Alappuzha.

1027
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:21,952
Bhaiyya, is the science block this way?
(in broken Hindi-Tamil-Kannada)

1028
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:23,943
You might find it.
You should be able to.

1029
00:52:23,968 --> 00:52:25,444
Sheesh! Malayalis!

1030
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,396
Crazy fellow!
Monkey!

1031
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,354
Where would she be?

1032
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,330
Stop!

1033
00:52:33,535 --> 00:52:34,644
This girl...

1034
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:37,433
There?

1035
00:52:44,336 --> 00:52:45,988
Excuse me.
Nothing.

1036
00:52:46,232 --> 00:52:47,295
No?

1037
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:48,507
This must be her.

1038
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:50,544
I was just checking, man!

1039
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:52,418
Not this one.

1040
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:55,345
What is this?
A mobile tower?

1041
00:52:55,377 --> 00:52:56,822
Chechi, Achu?
- What?

1042
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:58,978
Mullakkara... Master... Daughter?
- Master?

1043
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:01,436
Manoharan... Kunjatta..
- Oh! Kunjatta?

1044
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:03,193
Okay! Come! Come!
- Where are you taking me?

1045
00:53:03,218 --> 00:53:05,255
Leave me.
Don't do anything to me.

1046
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:10,926
Dear...

1047
00:53:12,082 --> 00:53:13,082
This girl...?

1048
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:15,636
Son...

1049
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:38,194
Manoharetta!

1050
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:41,801
What look is this?

1051
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:43,403
Let that be.
Have you come alone?

1052
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:44,681
No.
Kunjatta has also come.

1053
00:53:44,879 --> 00:53:46,013
Then where is he?

1054
00:53:46,334 --> 00:53:47,572
Yeah... Where did he go?

1055
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:02,609
Isn't that our Kunjatta?

1056
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:04,881
You!!

1057
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,411
Manoharetta!

1058
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:08,758
Come here!

1059
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:10,930
(Kisses)
- Has he gone crazy or what?

1060
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:12,641
Come!
- (Kisses)

1061
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,998
Chechi, one more round.
Please!

1062
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:16,233
No! No!
Come!

1063
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:25,065
Okay!

1064
00:54:25,477 --> 00:54:27,354
Come
Go ahead, girl. Hug me!

1065
00:54:28,472 --> 00:54:29,579
Is he a monk or what?

1066
00:54:29,696 --> 00:54:30,844
To hug and give blessings?

1067
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,817
Come.
Hold me tightly.

1068
00:54:33,224 --> 00:54:34,344
Kunjatta!

1069
00:54:34,517 --> 00:54:35,583
One minute, bro!

1070
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:37,790
Click it!
- Bro?

1071
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:40,746
Kunjatta has gone out
of hand, Manoharetta!

1072
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:42,550
Look for someone else now.

1073
00:54:43,097 --> 00:54:45,660
These fans are too much!
They weren't leaving me only!

1074
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,472
Manoharetta, I'm not coming back
to that bloody village again!

1075
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,910
Kunjatta, awesome!

1076
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:53,160
Wear this attire back home too.
Let everyone get shocked.

1077
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:54,246
Let that be.

1078
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:55,972
Look at you!

1079
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:58,555
You chopped off all that long hair...

1080
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,871
and you've become all skinny!

1081
00:55:00,188 --> 00:55:01,785
Why?
Awesome, right?

1082
00:55:03,111 --> 00:55:05,249
It's your wedding in one month.

1083
00:55:05,714 --> 00:55:07,747
Before that, eat something
and become healthy!

1084
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:09,610
Preparations have begun there!

1085
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:11,904
Master & Teacher are really excited!
- Yes.

1086
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:13,623
They're all waiting for you
to come back after the exams.

1087
00:55:14,555 --> 00:55:16,209
Manoharetta, I...

1088
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,234
I've got admission for PG here.

1089
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:19,451
I have a stipend too.

1090
00:55:19,476 --> 00:55:20,943
I want to study that as well.

1091
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:23,332
So what? You can continue studying
after marriage too, right?

1092
00:55:23,357 --> 00:55:24,669
You can teach him as well.
Right?

1093
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,216
It's not that, Manoharetta.

1094
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,402
Classes will begin
the coming week.

1095
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:29,990
Then I'll have classes
for one more year.

1096
00:55:30,015 --> 00:55:31,775
I worked so hard
to get this seat.

1097
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,852
Can't you just apply
for one month's leave?

1098
00:55:35,439 --> 00:55:37,283
I'm asking only for
one more year, right?

1099
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,993
You don't have to
think too much, dear.

1100
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:41,850
Master & I have discussed
and decided everything.

1101
00:55:42,178 --> 00:55:44,600
Okay?
We'll be leaving after tomorrow's exam.

1102
00:55:46,272 --> 00:55:47,506
I can't come, Manoharetta.

1103
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:48,751
Why?

1104
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,091
Any certificates are pending?

1105
00:55:50,153 --> 00:55:52,629
Then Kunjatta will collect it and come.
Right? - Yes.

1106
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:55,253
Hey!

1107
00:55:55,462 --> 00:55:56,785
You don't have to think too much.

1108
00:55:57,374 --> 00:55:58,845
Study well for tomorrow's exam.

1109
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:00,949
We have to leave tomorrow evening.
Okay?

1110
00:56:01,035 --> 00:56:02,035
I'll come tomorrow.

1111
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:04,940
I'm in love with someone.

1112
00:56:15,325 --> 00:56:16,458
What did you say?

1113
00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:18,281
I'm in love with someone.

1114
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,872
You should get us married.
- What did you say?

1115
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:25,552
What are you doing?
- Move away!

1116
00:56:25,577 --> 00:56:27,244
Leave me!
- No, Manoharetta! No!

1117
00:56:27,272 --> 00:56:30,670
There are 2 people who have prepared
everything and waiting for you there!

1118
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:33,131
Forgetting them, you want to
go with some random scoundrel?

1119
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,156
Manoharetta!

1120
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:35,616
You should have some gratitude!

1121
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:37,499
It won't happen, dear!

1122
00:56:37,992 --> 00:56:39,648
Whoever is with you....

1123
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:41,764
this Manoharan won't be with you.
Remember that!

1124
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,068
Come, Manoharetta!

1125
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:44,272
Come!

1126
00:56:44,406 --> 00:56:45,835
I am hurt!
Really hurt!

1127
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:46,985
Come, Manoharetta!

1128
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:06,001
You know Vadakkedathu
Pappettan's daughter?

1129
00:57:06,432 --> 00:57:07,432
Sujatha!

1130
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:10,200
She's 5.25 feet tall.

1131
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,747
Perfect weight.

1132
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,300
Good looking too.

1133
00:57:13,417 --> 00:57:14,768
You know how beautiful she is?

1134
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:16,801
They're well off,
even financially.

1135
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:19,676
Just that she's not so
educated or progressive.

1136
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:21,582
But she's perfect
to be a house-wife.

1137
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:25,461
Since this is not happening,

1138
00:57:25,486 --> 00:57:27,345
shall we consider
that for Kunjumon?

1139
00:57:27,354 --> 00:57:28,830
Go say that to your ...

1140
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:31,661
I'm going crazy here and...

1141
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:32,713
Manoharetta!

1142
00:57:32,955 --> 00:57:34,677
Aren't there any other
girls in the world?

1143
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,330
Or won't there be
any more weddings?

1144
00:57:36,483 --> 00:57:38,052
You just have to put
your mind into it!

1145
00:57:38,165 --> 00:57:40,907
Kunjumon's wedding will definitely
happen on the proposed date!

1146
00:57:40,987 --> 00:57:42,412
Or we will make it happen!

1147
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:44,079
Leave it, Manoharetta!

1148
00:57:45,608 --> 00:57:47,006
I can't leave it so easily, man!

1149
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,921
Each time I get a girl married,

1150
00:57:50,453 --> 00:57:52,382
it's like I'm getting
my own sister married.

1151
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:56,151
Do they see me just as a broker?
- No.

1152
00:57:56,609 --> 00:57:58,221
I'm their elder brother!
Elder brother!

1153
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:04,475
Their own elder brother.

1154
00:58:05,134 --> 00:58:06,431
That's how they have seen me.

1155
00:58:06,952 --> 00:58:07,952
And vice versa!

1156
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:10,709
Except one of them.

1157
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:11,834
Who's that?

1158
00:58:19,658 --> 00:58:20,658
And then?

1159
00:58:22,038 --> 00:58:23,038
Then what?

1160
00:58:23,979 --> 00:58:25,956
I had to conduct her
wedding as well.

1161
00:58:26,326 --> 00:58:27,519
Great!

1162
00:58:27,652 --> 00:58:32,058
Manoharetta, you must be the only broker
who got his own girlfriend married,

1163
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:34,175
for the first time in the world!

1164
00:58:35,089 --> 00:58:36,839
Such was my situation then!

1165
00:58:39,317 --> 00:58:40,804
But I'm not sad
because of that.

1166
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:45,124
I wasn't able to save her!

1167
00:58:54,035 --> 00:58:55,245
Shalini!

1168
00:59:00,753 --> 00:59:02,010
Manoharan, my child!

1169
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:04,690
Save my child!

1170
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:21,502
Shalini!

1171
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:23,791
Shalini!

1172
00:59:32,517 --> 00:59:35,548
When I lost my parents that day,

1173
00:59:36,017 --> 00:59:38,144
they left me in
Manoharettan's hands.

1174
00:59:39,421 --> 00:59:41,127
However much he
gets angry at me,

1175
00:59:42,938 --> 00:59:44,539
however much he shouts at me,

1176
00:59:46,142 --> 00:59:47,579
Manoharettan can understand me.

1177
00:59:49,557 --> 00:59:52,355
So she's your daughter who was
not born to you, right?

1178
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:58,434
She will obey what I say.

1179
00:59:59,956 --> 01:00:02,976
Leaving everything or everyone else
in this world, she will come with me.

1180
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:04,403
Wait and watch.

1181
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,680
Wait and watch!

1182
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:09,942
Didn't you pour water?

1183
01:00:13,048 --> 01:00:14,633
I'm relieved!
It's done finally!

1184
01:00:21,032 --> 01:00:22,032
Come.
Let's go!

1185
01:00:27,759 --> 01:00:29,196
Okay Madam.
Thank you.

1186
01:00:30,568 --> 01:00:32,081
Here's all your luggage.

1187
01:00:32,874 --> 01:00:33,874
Here.

1188
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:35,174
Come.
Let's go.

1189
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:43,049
Shall we eat a burger?
- Burger?

1190
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,206
Come on! It's time for the train.
- Is it?

1191
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:53,789
Leave me!

1192
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:37,010
Please move.

1193
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:42,801
Bloody rascal!

1194
01:01:43,254 --> 01:01:44,874
[speaking in Kannada]

1195
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:49,468
Is this a Kannada movie or what?

1196
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:52,606
Is this a movie shooting?
- Then there should be a camera, right?

1197
01:01:52,718 --> 01:01:53,798
Yes.

1198
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:57,986
Are the teachers sending goons to hit the
students for getting low marks in exams?

1199
01:01:58,084 --> 01:01:59,554
Get lost!
This is not all that.

1200
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:00,989
Then?
- That's his uncle.

1201
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:03,985
His wedding was fixed with a
minister's daughter here.

1202
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,688
But he's in love
with a girl here.

1203
01:02:05,713 --> 01:02:07,407
They've come after knowing that.
 - Why?

1204
01:02:07,453 --> 01:02:08,488
To kill her!

1205
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:12,302
So it's the Manoharettan of
Bangalore who's rocking here.

1206
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,287
But no one is intervening!

1207
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:16,848
[Continues speaking in Kannada]

1208
01:02:23,204 --> 01:02:25,636
What's wrong with him?

1209
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:28,439
Nice boy.
Good looking, too.

1210
01:02:28,781 --> 01:02:30,294
Good college...

1211
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:32,388
Marriage with a minister's daughter.

1212
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,327
And then doing
unnecessary things!

1213
01:02:34,352 --> 01:02:35,457
These guys should be...

1214
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:38,277
No one is reacting!
- Where did she go?

1215
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:40,473
Yes. Where is she?

1216
01:02:55,156 --> 01:02:57,367
Manoharetta, do something.
Or it will be a problem!

1217
01:02:57,622 --> 01:02:58,622
What can I do?

1218
01:02:59,126 --> 01:03:01,080
He should have been thrashed
by me instead of them!

1219
01:03:01,105 --> 01:03:02,346
Not that, Manoharetta.

1220
01:03:02,394 --> 01:03:03,758
If something happens to him,

1221
01:03:03,782 --> 01:03:05,391
our Achu might do something drastic.

1222
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,072
Don't get me tensed!

1223
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:13,306
Manoharetta, this will be a problem.
Listen to me!

1224
01:03:13,339 --> 01:03:14,853
Go and compromise!

1225
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:16,238
How?

1226
01:03:16,464 --> 01:03:19,573
You've compromised much bigger
problems back home so easily, right?

1227
01:03:19,678 --> 01:03:20,957
You can do it!

1228
01:03:21,129 --> 01:03:24,552
Hey! We can go back to Kerala with
our Achu, only if he is alive.

1229
01:03:24,577 --> 01:03:25,601
Go, Manoharetta!

1230
01:03:25,626 --> 01:03:28,218
If anyone has the courage
to oppose us, come on!

1231
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:30,461
Hey! Wear this!

1232
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:32,601
We've never failed, whenever
you've worn this. Go!

1233
01:04:52,314 --> 01:04:54,335
Brother, a compromise?

1234
01:04:55,869 --> 01:04:58,955
The moment you step
out of this campus,

1235
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,509
I will kill you!

1236
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:02,903
Thank you.

1237
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:04,575
Come on!

1238
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:06,426
Didn't you hear him?
Come on!

1239
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:09,743
Oh no!
Don't do anything!

1240
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:10,932
Please don't.

1241
01:05:11,471 --> 01:05:12,684
I have to get down.

1242
01:05:12,723 --> 01:05:13,775
Put me down.

1243
01:05:14,197 --> 01:05:15,369
I have high B.P.

1244
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:26,133
Don't topple me.
My disk will slip.

1245
01:05:26,282 --> 01:05:27,424
Put me down.

1246
01:05:36,003 --> 01:05:37,392
You guys are in serious trouble!

1247
01:05:37,841 --> 01:05:40,004
What?
- My dear bro, you're in trouble!

1248
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:41,704
You should leave this
place at the earliest.

1249
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,756
If their people see you,
they will kill you!

1250
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:44,802
Who?

1251
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,698
Manoharettan!
- It's true.

1252
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:48,849
Now all their anger would
be towards Manoharettan.

1253
01:05:49,772 --> 01:05:50,880
Are you satisfied now?

1254
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,489
Are you satisfied now?

1255
01:05:53,204 --> 01:05:55,350
After killing the hopes
of an entire family...

1256
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:56,914
What are you looking at?

1257
01:05:57,077 --> 01:05:59,890
I didn't see all this when you
shamelessly got beaten up like a dog!

1258
01:05:59,978 --> 01:06:01,299
If you are a man with a spine,

1259
01:06:01,452 --> 01:06:03,607
you should be brave enough
to answer back to them!

1260
01:06:03,854 --> 01:06:06,422
Instead, you shouldn't be
getting beaten up, for romancing!

1261
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:09,393
I stood there and got beaten up,
only because I'm a man with a spine!

1262
01:06:09,418 --> 01:06:10,617
He's speaking in Malayalam!

1263
01:06:10,642 --> 01:06:11,642
His mother is a Malayali.

1264
01:06:13,439 --> 01:06:14,995
They didn't come looking for me.

1265
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,011
They came looking for the
girl I'm in love with.

1266
01:06:17,036 --> 01:06:18,036
To kill her!

1267
01:06:20,721 --> 01:06:23,270
It's not like I don't know how
to answer or hit them back.

1268
01:06:23,431 --> 01:06:25,165
It's only because I
love her so much!

1269
01:06:25,172 --> 01:06:26,604
Enough!
Enough!

1270
01:06:27,262 --> 01:06:28,326
Don't say anything more!

1271
01:06:29,127 --> 01:06:31,665
Talking back after
ruining a girl's life?

1272
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,932
Manoharetta, no.
- You shut up!

1273
01:06:34,136 --> 01:06:35,136
I know her.

1274
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,940
She won't be disobedient.

1275
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,994
After alluring her...

1276
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:40,583
Let me talk, please.
- Shut up!

1277
01:06:44,529 --> 01:06:45,529
What was your intention?

1278
01:06:46,439 --> 01:06:48,195
How did you threaten
and lure her?

1279
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:49,352
Tell me!

1280
01:06:53,813 --> 01:06:55,461
It was me who told him that I love him!

1281
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,531
Satya, he has come inside.

1282
01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:02,749
Come!

1283
01:07:03,596 --> 01:07:04,596
I'm not coming.

1284
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:05,920
Achu, don't be adamant.

1285
01:07:05,966 --> 01:07:07,127
I'm not coming, Manoharetta.

1286
01:07:10,238 --> 01:07:12,823
Achu, listen to Manoharettan now.
Go!

1287
01:07:13,124 --> 01:07:14,263
Let them kill me!

1288
01:07:14,391 --> 01:07:17,361
But I won't come unless Manoharettan
promises me that he'll stand by me.

1289
01:07:19,088 --> 01:07:21,004
Manoharetta, agree to it!

1290
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:46,519
'Beside every path,
where we reach, searching each other'

1291
01:07:46,544 --> 01:07:54,049
'Why does the beat in my
heart become fervent?'

1292
01:07:54,432 --> 01:08:01,431
'How many more days shall pass,
away from each other?'

1293
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:05,095
'O magical city'

1294
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:08,910
'On your paths'

1295
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:14,511
'Give us a place,
to share dreams'

1296
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:40,036
'Are we not able to spread smiles
to each other, in every moment?'

1297
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:47,949
'Are words from our hearts going back,
as soon as they reach the lips?'

1298
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:55,219
'Sharp pairs of eyes, on the flowers
that blossomed on the paths'

1299
01:08:55,244 --> 01:09:02,759
'Day and night, did you hear the sound
of the roaring sea, in our lives?'

1300
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:06,318
'O magical city'

1301
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:10,004
'On your paths'

1302
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:15,568
'Give us a place,
to share dreams'

1303
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:22,805
'Beside every path,
where we reach, searching each other'

1304
01:09:22,836 --> 01:09:27,995
'Why does the beat in my
heart become fervent?'

1305
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,020
Come!

1306
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:32,807
Let's go this way!

1307
01:09:35,068 --> 01:09:37,180
Wait. Turn to the left.
- Why?

1308
01:09:37,205 --> 01:09:39,357
Haven't they said that
everything will be all right?

1309
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:43,530
I can't breathe!

1310
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,686
I had told you that
we'll wear pants.

1311
01:09:45,944 --> 01:09:46,944
Why?

1312
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:49,710
Over there!

1313
01:09:49,748 --> 01:09:50,748
Come!

1314
01:09:57,677 --> 01:09:59,338
Run!
- I'm not able to run!

1315
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:01,024
Didn't I tell you that
I had a slip disk?

1316
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,680
Run!

1317
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:14,225
We're trapped, Manoharetta.

1318
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:19,916
Manoharetta, come!

1319
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:23,213
Come!
- Don't stand there staring. Come fast!

1320
01:10:24,157 --> 01:10:26,111
Come and get in!
Fast!

1321
01:10:26,895 --> 01:10:28,860
Get in, Manoharetta.
- Let's go!

1322
01:10:46,937 --> 01:10:49,178
It's risky if you try to
get out of the city now.

1323
01:10:49,502 --> 01:10:50,833
They won't reach here anyway.

1324
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:52,510
This is my house.
Come.

1325
01:10:52,675 --> 01:10:53,675
Get down.

1326
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,840
Come.

1327
01:11:02,063 --> 01:11:03,063
Come.

1328
01:11:04,308 --> 01:11:05,456
Daddy!

1329
01:11:05,653 --> 01:11:06,653
My kids!

1330
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:09,507
What's your name, dear?
- Chinnu.

1331
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:10,532
I'll get tea for you.

1332
01:11:11,398 --> 01:11:13,241
Which grade are you studying in?
- 3rd grade.

1333
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:15,881
Who drew all these?

1334
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,171
Me and my sister.
- Wow.

1335
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:19,967
Your sister is also smart, huh?

1336
01:11:33,272 --> 01:11:34,272
Brother...

1337
01:11:57,676 --> 01:11:58,676
Don't cry.

1338
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:04,490
I never expected you here, dear.

1339
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,552
Though what you did was wrong,

1340
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,631
you're living happily, right?

1341
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:12,035
That's enough for your brother.

1342
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:16,341
Mistake?

1343
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:22,492
I didn't do wrong, Chetta.

1344
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:24,977
I was the one who was wronged.

1345
01:12:25,686 --> 01:12:26,686
You were wronged?

1346
01:12:28,222 --> 01:12:29,932
We invited all relatives
and villagers...

1347
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,627
arranged all the gold and
money they asked for...

1348
01:12:34,089 --> 01:12:36,189
When you left everything
behind and went away,

1349
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,215
our father died of heartbreak!

1350
01:12:39,797 --> 01:12:41,559
Still, we were the ones
who wronged you?

1351
01:12:42,343 --> 01:12:43,343
Tell me.

1352
01:12:45,259 --> 01:12:46,259
I know, Chetta.

1353
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,686
The preparations were all grand!

1354
01:12:52,055 --> 01:12:53,476
But shall I ask you one thing?

1355
01:12:54,851 --> 01:12:57,078
The first and last word in a marriage,

1356
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,262
is the consent of the girl
who's going to get married.

1357
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:03,473
Did you ask for my consent?

1358
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:07,665
Had you asked for my consent?

1359
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:17,128
After fixing everything,

1360
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:21,420
when everyone was getting
ready for my wedding,

1361
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:26,242
at least , for once...

1362
01:13:27,046 --> 01:13:28,702
did you feel like
calling me next to you,

1363
01:13:29,547 --> 01:13:31,312
and asking me whether
I agree to it or not?

1364
01:13:34,054 --> 01:13:36,086
We only wished the
best for you, dear.

1365
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,100
The best?

1366
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:40,876
What's best?

1367
01:13:41,955 --> 01:13:44,171
You arranged the gold & money
they asked for, it seems.

1368
01:13:46,597 --> 01:13:47,844
However much you pay,

1369
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:50,397
however much you
cover her in gold,

1370
01:13:51,147 --> 01:13:53,044
you can't put a price
for a girl's consent.

1371
01:13:54,707 --> 01:13:55,731
Hey!

1372
01:13:56,774 --> 01:13:58,422
I was the one who was
wronged, Chetta.

1373
01:13:59,514 --> 01:14:00,785
Even after so many years,

1374
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:03,203
aren't you doing
the same mistake,

1375
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,863
to Achu as well?

1376
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:08,863
Did you ask for her consent
before fixing this wedding?

1377
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:14,816
It's her choice.

1378
01:14:15,345 --> 01:14:16,399
It's her life.

1379
01:14:18,627 --> 01:14:19,707
Agree to it, Chetta.

1380
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:34,277
It's me, Manoharan.

1381
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,362
It's heavenly here because
Manoharettan is not here.

1382
01:14:37,379 --> 01:14:38,642
I hope he doesn't
come back soon.

1383
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:41,563
The kids are having a blast
for the past 2-3 days!

1384
01:14:42,069 --> 01:14:43,752
Let them have a blast, man!

1385
01:14:43,799 --> 01:14:47,377
How long is this going to go on?
Only until they come back!

1386
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,525
Manoharan & Kunjatta went saying
they'll back the next day.

1387
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,128
But there's no news about them!

1388
01:14:52,457 --> 01:14:54,849
However far they go,
they come back the very next day!

1389
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:56,319
- Yes.
- What distance?

1390
01:14:56,348 --> 01:14:59,304
You're talking so much about people
who've never been outside Alappuzha.

1391
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:00,737
What do you know?

1392
01:15:00,823 --> 01:15:04,362
They have gone to look for the girl,
to Bangalore!

1393
01:15:04,387 --> 01:15:05,430
So what?

1394
01:15:05,455 --> 01:15:06,643
So what?

1395
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,410
Which world are you living in?

1396
01:15:08,649 --> 01:15:12,439
A girl who has gone to Bangalore, and
a rocket sent to space are the same!

1397
01:15:12,464 --> 01:15:14,119
Has anything come back
in the shape it went?

1398
01:15:14,144 --> 01:15:16,119
Why?
- You fool! - Yes?

1399
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:19,148
Lasar ettan of the other shore,
sent his daughter to study in Bangalore.

1400
01:15:19,173 --> 01:15:21,556
And when he went there looking for
the girl, what did he see? - What?

1401
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:23,653
The girl was living with a guy!

1402
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:27,049
Is it?
- She said it, right? Ask her.

1403
01:15:27,074 --> 01:15:28,761
And so many such stories.

1404
01:15:28,848 --> 01:15:31,808
Don't talk nonsense,
Tresya Chedathi.

1405
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:34,062
Then why didn't they come back,
after going to look for her?

1406
01:15:34,086 --> 01:15:36,964
They've sent the girl to study
in Bangalore! Bangalore!

1407
01:15:36,989 --> 01:15:38,481
How do you know this, Tresyamma?

1408
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:40,326
Where did Tresyamma
Chedathi do her pre-degree?

1409
01:15:40,351 --> 01:15:42,358
Where?
It was in Bangalore!

1410
01:15:42,383 --> 01:15:43,582
Is it?
- Hey boy!

1411
01:15:43,614 --> 01:15:44,944
Don't talk too much!

1412
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:47,295
Where's your Mama & assistant,
who went looking for the girl?

1413
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,528
Tell me!
Tell me!

1414
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,250
Tell me.

1415
01:15:51,785 --> 01:15:52,785
Tell me.

1416
01:15:52,978 --> 01:15:54,997
If I call you,
won't you come with me?

1417
01:15:55,339 --> 01:15:56,528
Oh no!
I am scared!

1418
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:58,230
Whom are you scared of?

1419
01:15:58,277 --> 01:16:00,042
Your family?
Or these villagers?

1420
01:16:00,464 --> 01:16:02,408
What if Manoharettan...?
- Manoharettan!

1421
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,900
Ask him to get lost!
Monster!

1422
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,691
Whatever happens,

1423
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,596
whoever locks you up,

1424
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,212
if you close your eyes once,

1425
01:16:09,683 --> 01:16:11,001
you can hear my heartbeat.

1426
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,368
Close your eyes!

1427
01:16:12,806 --> 01:16:13,873
Close your eyes!

1428
01:16:22,262 --> 01:16:23,262
I can hear it!

1429
01:16:25,433 --> 01:16:26,887
Manoharettan!

1430
01:16:27,808 --> 01:16:29,358
Oh my God!

1431
01:16:31,437 --> 01:16:32,437
Oh no!

1432
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:36,419
Why is everyone running?

1433
01:16:36,444 --> 01:16:38,240
Why are the kids running?
Did a boat sink?

1434
01:16:46,013 --> 01:16:47,742
What happened now?
Didn't I tell you?

1435
01:16:47,796 --> 01:16:49,303
He's coming back
with empty hands!

1436
01:16:52,194 --> 01:16:54,139
She must be living with someone there.
- Is it?

1437
01:16:54,164 --> 01:16:56,616
Whatever this Tresyamma
has said, has never...

1438
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:00,630
There's the girl.

1439
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:04,049
This has got nothing to do
with what you said, Tresyamma!

1440
01:17:04,999 --> 01:17:09,184
Getting run out while boasting very well,
 is too bad!

1441
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,662
The heart of certain
hags are like charcoal!

1442
01:17:11,982 --> 01:17:14,176
Trouble at some places,
gossip at some places.

1443
01:17:14,201 --> 01:17:15,655
Why isn't anyone speaking up?

1444
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:17,898
Why should we stay silent
and tolerate this hag?

1445
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,126
She will have to pay a
price for this bragging!

1446
01:17:22,408 --> 01:17:23,572
A huge price!

1447
01:17:25,283 --> 01:17:28,192
The problem is not with
Bangalore or Madras!

1448
01:17:28,403 --> 01:17:29,634
It's your mind!

1449
01:17:29,891 --> 01:17:31,017
Can't you be good, you hag?

1450
01:17:32,316 --> 01:17:33,972
The Collector is a nuisance now.

1451
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,969
Get him transferred somehow.

1452
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:38,672
Won't even let me do
business peacefully.

1453
01:17:39,971 --> 01:17:40,997
Boss!

1454
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:30,362
'The brave and mighty hero,
whom I've always dreamt of'

1455
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:37,216
'You are the lovely, beautiful heroine,
who has captured my heart'

1456
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:45,248
'Searching for the shore where stars
twinkle like silver fireflies'

1457
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:51,586
'On a swan-boat,
we would cross the seven oceans'

1458
01:18:52,069 --> 01:18:58,880
'With just a look, you captured the
kingdom of my heart, at first sight'

1459
01:18:58,905 --> 01:19:05,526
'O beauty, your smiles turned this
mighty king into a tame deer'

1460
01:19:26,318 --> 01:19:32,904
'O Goddess, come and
bless my kingdom'

1461
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:40,156
'Play the tunes of love,
on the mystical Veena'

1462
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:46,962
'I shall wear the fine cloth
stitched by the full moon'

1463
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:53,631
'Let's turn the sapphire towers,
into a stage to dance'

1464
01:19:53,682 --> 01:19:59,857
'When I come, open the dream mansion,
built by the sculptor of love'

1465
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:07,420
'With just a look, you captured the
kingdom of my heart, at first sight'

1466
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:14,218
'O beauty, your smiles turned this
mighty king into a tame deer'

1467
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:26,888
'The brave and mighty hero,
whom I've always dreamt of'

1468
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:33,709
'You are the lovely, beautiful heroine,
who has captured my heart'

1469
01:20:35,003 --> 01:20:41,763
'Searching for the shore where stars
twinkle like silver fireflies'

1470
01:20:41,788 --> 01:20:47,843
'On a swan-boat,
we would cross the seven oceans'

1471
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:55,398
'With just a look, you captured the
kingdom of my heart, at first sight'

1472
01:20:55,437 --> 01:21:01,883
'O beauty, your smiles turned this
mighty king into a tame deer'

1473
01:21:19,687 --> 01:21:20,824
Remember everything I said?

1474
01:21:20,849 --> 01:21:22,193
You will be with me, right?

1475
01:21:22,675 --> 01:21:23,845
I can't help it, right?

1476
01:21:24,959 --> 01:21:25,959
Hey!

1477
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:29,466
No one there should suspect that
you don't want to marry him.

1478
01:21:30,402 --> 01:21:32,072
What's there to suspect in this?

1479
01:21:32,547 --> 01:21:34,742
If he's going to marry her,
people might suspect.

1480
01:21:34,993 --> 01:21:36,555
But if he's going to marry her,

1481
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,223
there is nothing to suspect.

1482
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:40,848
I'm wondering which one
would happen among these!

1483
01:21:41,372 --> 01:21:42,602
Do you have any doubts?

1484
01:21:43,085 --> 01:21:44,593
What all are you saying?
- No, bro.

1485
01:21:44,618 --> 01:21:47,139
If he marries her, he will take
her to Bangalore directly.

1486
01:21:47,164 --> 01:21:48,437
And if our guy is marrying her?

1487
01:21:48,462 --> 01:21:49,887
There are so many facilities!

1488
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:52,730
A great AC office,
right at the junction.

1489
01:21:52,923 --> 01:21:55,017
Resort...
Houseboats...

1490
01:21:55,114 --> 01:21:56,114
Look at me!

1491
01:21:56,139 --> 01:21:57,801
He even has a European commode.

1492
01:21:57,963 --> 01:21:59,773
We just have to sit like this.

1493
01:21:59,798 --> 01:22:01,349
You & your commode!
- Oh no!

1494
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:05,099
Get lost!
- And he has a swimming pool too!

1495
01:22:06,165 --> 01:22:08,079
Catch it!
- Swim in the pool then!

1496
01:22:10,011 --> 01:22:12,026
Hey! Clear your doubts
& come there quickly!

1497
01:22:13,599 --> 01:22:15,425
Go there and paint it there!

1498
01:22:18,045 --> 01:22:19,158
Get down carefully.

1499
01:22:19,183 --> 01:22:21,396
Look who's here! Come! Come!
- Master!

1500
01:22:23,115 --> 01:22:26,173
My darling!
- You look so weak, my dear Master!

1501
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:28,324
Why?
 Teacher isn't giving you any food?

1502
01:22:28,972 --> 01:22:30,821
Give me the suitcase.
Give it here.

1503
01:22:31,152 --> 01:22:33,627
Dear, are you doing good?
- Yes, Chechi.

1504
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:37,008
Oh my God!
Didn't you erect the marquee yet, Master?

1505
01:22:38,605 --> 01:22:41,379
Will anyone erect a marquee
one month before the wedding?

1506
01:22:41,404 --> 01:22:44,644
It's Nalappattu Narayanan
Master's granddaughter's wedding!

1507
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:46,160
Let all the people know!

1508
01:22:46,965 --> 01:22:49,041
Sheesh! What is this paint?

1509
01:22:49,066 --> 01:22:50,243
You didn't like it, dear?

1510
01:22:50,268 --> 01:22:52,266
Achutty...
- Teacher...

1511
01:22:52,313 --> 01:22:53,356
My dear...

1512
01:22:54,525 --> 01:22:56,356
What is this attire, dear?

1513
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:59,098
Leave all that. Where's the gold and
clothes for the wedding, Sharadamma?

1514
01:22:59,138 --> 01:23:00,666
There's still time for all that!

1515
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:02,189
So you didn't buy it yet?

1516
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:03,807
What is this, Manoharetta?

1517
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:07,061
When he came and told me, I thought I'll
have to come directly to the Mandapam.

1518
01:23:07,614 --> 01:23:09,489
By the way, where is the Mandapam?

1519
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:11,012
We'll arrange all that.

1520
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:12,687
Let's build the Mandapam there.

1521
01:23:12,712 --> 01:23:14,878
A Mandapam on a broad stage.

1522
01:23:14,934 --> 01:23:16,703
Sharadamma, come.
Let's catch up!

1523
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:19,227
Which is going to be my bedroom
for first night? - This girl!

1524
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:21,881
Nice!
- Master!

1525
01:23:22,354 --> 01:23:23,453
Go & come back on Saturday!

1526
01:23:23,478 --> 01:23:25,347
Manoharetta!
- It's Kunjatta.

1527
01:23:26,979 --> 01:23:29,111
Why are you wearing a wreath?

1528
01:23:29,136 --> 01:23:31,452
If there was any more delay,
I'd have been under a wreath now.

1529
01:23:31,477 --> 01:23:33,255
Did you come swimming
from Bangalore?

1530
01:23:36,142 --> 01:23:37,142
Go & change your clothes.

1531
01:23:39,742 --> 01:23:41,496
What is this?
- Who knows!

1532
01:23:44,301 --> 01:23:47,277
[Humming]

1533
01:23:50,082 --> 01:23:52,230
Go.
Go and tell him the matter.

1534
01:23:52,457 --> 01:23:53,457
Go!

1535
01:24:06,898 --> 01:24:08,031
Master...

1536
01:24:09,867 --> 01:24:11,265
I can't hold on any longer.

1537
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,836
Why should you hold on?

1538
01:24:13,175 --> 01:24:15,089
Just go ahead and pee!

1539
01:24:15,531 --> 01:24:16,531
Not that, Master.

1540
01:24:17,811 --> 01:24:18,932
Our Achu...

1541
01:24:19,798 --> 01:24:21,531
She's not like we thought, Master.

1542
01:24:21,816 --> 01:24:24,635
Of course!
She shocked us, right?

1543
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:28,081
We suspected in vain that she
won't agree to the wedding.

1544
01:24:29,159 --> 01:24:30,159
It's not that, Master.

1545
01:24:31,323 --> 01:24:34,717
She is old and mature enough to take
a decision now, Master.

1546
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,339
No! Isn't that why we took a
decision regarding her marriage?

1547
01:24:41,971 --> 01:24:43,455
Tell him!
Tell him the matter!

1548
01:24:44,642 --> 01:24:46,126
This wedding won't happen, Master.

1549
01:24:46,536 --> 01:24:48,051
That's what I also thought...

1550
01:24:48,419 --> 01:24:50,622
... until you came
back from Bangalore.

1551
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,256
I became relieved only now.

1552
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:55,900
Tell him!

1553
01:24:57,233 --> 01:24:58,568
Come here, Master.

1554
01:24:59,733 --> 01:25:01,638
Careful.
- Don't hold me.

1555
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:03,349
Don't hold me.
- Sit there.

1556
01:25:03,927 --> 01:25:05,068
Sit there.

1557
01:25:05,654 --> 01:25:06,654
Don't talk!

1558
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:08,255
Listen to everything
I have to say!

1559
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,468
Tell me!

1560
01:25:09,515 --> 01:25:10,538
Here.
Take this.

1561
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,220
Give it!
- Have it.

1562
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,519
I tried my best to
dissuade her, Master.

1563
01:25:19,516 --> 01:25:21,855
But she's adamant
about her decision.

1564
01:25:23,943 --> 01:25:25,390
Now the only thing we can do,

1565
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:27,952
is to fulfill her wish.

1566
01:25:30,218 --> 01:25:31,319
She...

1567
01:25:32,124 --> 01:25:33,741
She is in love with a
boy from Bangalore.

1568
01:25:36,895 --> 01:25:37,895
But...

1569
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:40,371
Why did she do this to us, Master?

1570
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:43,945
Leave it.

1571
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,499
What else can I say?

1572
01:25:46,644 --> 01:25:48,727
Forgive me for not
saying it so far.

1573
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:50,446
Leave it.
- Wait, Master.

1574
01:25:52,906 --> 01:25:54,398
What else can I say?

1575
01:25:54,423 --> 01:25:55,871
No.
I said I'm leaving.

1576
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:02,028
Only I heard...
Only I heard the whole thing.

1577
01:26:02,195 --> 01:26:04,366
The one who's supposed to hear this,
is lying there!

1578
01:26:07,815 --> 01:26:09,299
Wasted money on the
bottle in vain!

1579
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:13,240
Shall I tell this to Teacher?
- Get lost! Teacher won't drink!

1580
01:26:14,456 --> 01:26:15,756
Oh no!
Is he dead?

1581
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:21,565
Didn't you tell me that they
shouldn't suspect anything?

1582
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,699
How was my acting?

1583
01:26:22,724 --> 01:26:24,028
One slap I'll give you!

1584
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,520
It was like a Telugu film!

1585
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:27,880
Is it a problem, Manoharetta?
- Yes.

1586
01:26:27,905 --> 01:26:30,150
Then I'll make it a little
more realistic from tomorrow.

1587
01:26:30,175 --> 01:26:31,475
A 'Pothettan' touch!

1588
01:26:31,755 --> 01:26:33,595
Poth (bull) or buffalo...
Whatever!

1589
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,254
Just do as I say, dear.

1590
01:26:36,807 --> 01:26:39,668
Kunjatta and me presented this proposal
to him, upon Master's request.

1591
01:26:39,717 --> 01:26:41,161
He was not at all interested.

1592
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:44,198
He said decently that
he is yet to grow.

1593
01:26:44,437 --> 01:26:45,847
Didn't listen.
- Who?

1594
01:26:46,184 --> 01:26:47,894
Me!
- Manoharetta!

1595
01:26:48,465 --> 01:26:49,995
No point saying all that now.

1596
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:52,433
Well, you talk to him directly.

1597
01:26:52,741 --> 01:26:54,966
Talk to him?
Me?

1598
01:26:55,037 --> 01:26:56,421
Get lost, Manoharetta!

1599
01:26:56,593 --> 01:26:59,663
When you talk directly,
present this matter subtly.

1600
01:26:59,889 --> 01:27:02,802
He was forced into this, right?
So he'll back out himself.

1601
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,762
Don't say anything, Manoharettan!
I won't do it.

1602
01:27:04,817 --> 01:27:06,107
Listen to me!
- Manoharetta!

1603
01:27:06,147 --> 01:27:07,940
Manohare... - Here! Here!
- Oh! You were here?

1604
01:27:07,965 --> 01:27:09,284
Didn't you wear this cloth yet?

1605
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:10,792
Why do I need this now?
- You need it.

1606
01:27:10,817 --> 01:27:13,168
Didn't you get ready, dear?
They are about to reach.

1607
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:14,812
Who?
- The groom & party.

1608
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:15,671
Groom & party?

1609
01:27:15,695 --> 01:27:19,427
Didn't they say that they will come the
next day after we're back from Bangalore?

1610
01:27:19,452 --> 01:27:20,615
To whom?
- To me!

1611
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,035
But you didn't tell me!
- Does danger come after announcing?

1612
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,148
They are about to reach.

1613
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:25,258
Go & get ready, dear.

1614
01:27:25,314 --> 01:27:26,826
Teacher... Master...

1615
01:27:26,858 --> 01:27:28,592
Did you take bath, dear? - No.
- Good.

1616
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:30,118
Master!

1617
01:27:30,165 --> 01:27:31,587
Teacher...
- Yes.

1618
01:27:31,615 --> 01:27:33,412
Snacks & tea are ready, right?

1619
01:27:33,437 --> 01:27:34,882
Didn't you eat anything yet?

1620
01:27:34,907 --> 01:27:36,093
Not for me.
They are about to reach.

1621
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:37,889
Who?
- The groom & party! - Oh no!

1622
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:40,022
But there's nothing here.

1623
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:42,912
Shouldn't you store at least some
sweets, in a prospective bride's house?

1624
01:27:42,937 --> 01:27:45,680
Where is Master?
- He is sitting there after applying oil!

1625
01:27:45,705 --> 01:27:47,269
is he going to fight a war?
What do we do now?

1626
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:49,901
You do one thing.
Go to the market and buy something.

1627
01:27:49,926 --> 01:27:51,262
Oh God!
Where is she now?

1628
01:27:53,959 --> 01:27:56,759
I'm wearing a T-shirt with
your photo on it, boss. See!

1629
01:28:00,722 --> 01:28:02,246
Comb your hair properly.

1630
01:28:04,787 --> 01:28:06,387
Everyone is here.
- Yes.

1631
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,659
Let boss get down first.

1632
01:28:09,155 --> 01:28:10,420
Now everyone else can come.

1633
01:28:11,615 --> 01:28:13,443
Oh God!
There are plenty of people!

1634
01:28:14,553 --> 01:28:15,553
Give it to me.

1635
01:28:15,855 --> 01:28:17,661
Welcome! Welcome.
- Good morning, sir.

1636
01:28:17,951 --> 01:28:20,172
Enough! This was such
a surprise visit.

1637
01:28:20,197 --> 01:28:22,339
You could have just walked
over that bridge, right?

1638
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:23,398
This was for some weight!

1639
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,977
Then why stop at a houseboat?
Why didn't you come in a jangar?

1640
01:28:25,002 --> 01:28:26,653
That's saved for the wedding!
- Oh God!

1641
01:28:27,251 --> 01:28:28,251
Go ahead.

1642
01:28:28,463 --> 01:28:29,463
Go inside.

1643
01:28:29,519 --> 01:28:30,519
Please go.

1644
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:34,952
Though he owns houseboats
and a 2 storeyed house,

1645
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:36,460
and an AC office,

1646
01:28:36,755 --> 01:28:37,989
and he's very rich now...

1647
01:28:38,398 --> 01:28:43,305
In spite of all this, we had a doubt whether
he's old or big enough to get married!

1648
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,983
Rascal... - But since Manoharan
brought this proposal,

1649
01:28:49,108 --> 01:28:51,842
She's also planning
to do a PG course.

1650
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,405
That's when Manoharan
told us about Kunjumon.

1651
01:28:54,433 --> 01:28:56,664
If Manoharan recommends,
I don't have to think twice.

1652
01:28:57,014 --> 01:28:58,014
Us too.

1653
01:29:04,998 --> 01:29:06,645
I want to....

1654
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:07,990
That's all?
Come.

1655
01:29:09,857 --> 01:29:11,599
I'll be right back.
- There he goes again.

1656
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:17,530
- They've even offered an apartment for him
at Burj Khalifa if he goes back.

1657
01:29:17,963 --> 01:29:18,963
Over here.

1658
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:21,224
Hey!

1659
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,849
Here?
- We usually go here.

1660
01:29:24,111 --> 01:29:26,021
Hey! I don't want to pee.
- Then?

1661
01:29:26,483 --> 01:29:28,294
I wanted in private.

1662
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:29,530
Go ahead.
Talk!

1663
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,957
To Achu!

1664
01:29:32,874 --> 01:29:34,092
Is that it?

1665
01:29:34,123 --> 01:29:35,233
I mistook you.

1666
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,106
Just go up from here,
and turn left.

1667
01:29:37,131 --> 01:29:38,131
Go!

1668
01:29:38,952 --> 01:29:39,952
Poor thing.

1669
01:29:41,026 --> 01:29:43,243
Is this a hostel?
There are so many rooms.

1670
01:29:43,577 --> 01:29:44,930
Where is she hiding?

1671
01:29:45,832 --> 01:29:46,832
Sorry.

1672
01:30:02,755 --> 01:30:04,179
Why are you looking
at me like this?

1673
01:30:04,927 --> 01:30:05,927
Well...

1674
01:30:06,989 --> 01:30:08,017
I...

1675
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:09,387
You?

1676
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,536
I...

1677
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:13,230
Are you in any kind
of tension, Achu?

1678
01:30:14,145 --> 01:30:15,145
No!

1679
01:30:17,866 --> 01:30:19,882
I have a little bit of tension.

1680
01:30:22,976 --> 01:30:23,976
You can...

1681
01:30:24,987 --> 01:30:25,987
... say something.

1682
01:30:26,667 --> 01:30:27,667
Well...

1683
01:30:28,049 --> 01:30:29,049
Well?

1684
01:30:32,939 --> 01:30:35,082
There's no other eligible
bachelor like you,

1685
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:37,425
anywhere in this village.

1686
01:30:38,324 --> 01:30:39,521
Not on the other shore too.

1687
01:30:39,563 --> 01:30:41,409
Yes. Not on the other shore too.

1688
01:30:41,434 --> 01:30:42,434
Yes.

1689
01:30:42,758 --> 01:30:45,498
A nice house,
a nice family...

1690
01:30:45,718 --> 01:30:47,216
So much money...

1691
01:30:47,827 --> 01:30:50,920
And, handsomeness that
would tempt any girl.

1692
01:30:51,664 --> 01:30:53,723
But... shall I ask you something?

1693
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:58,896
Won't you get a better
girl than me, Kunjettan?

1694
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:02,788
14 years...

1695
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,700
Move away.

1696
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:09,050
For the past 14 years,

1697
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:11,929
... there has been a
dream in my heart.

1698
01:31:12,911 --> 01:31:13,911
Houseboat...

1699
01:31:14,566 --> 01:31:17,442
Tourism, real estate, business...

1700
01:31:18,049 --> 01:31:20,739
... and everything else I've
touched, have turned into gold.

1701
01:31:21,098 --> 01:31:23,610
You also would know that
Kunjumon, like everyone else.

1702
01:31:24,671 --> 01:31:25,671
But...

1703
01:31:26,575 --> 01:31:29,079
There's a secret that I've
been carrying in my heart.

1704
01:31:30,713 --> 01:31:32,892
Akshay...
Ajmal...

1705
01:31:33,564 --> 01:31:34,564
Akash...

1706
01:31:35,731 --> 01:31:38,275
Ashwathi Ramachandran...
- Present, teacher!

1707
01:31:40,642 --> 01:31:42,719
Akhil...
Anuraj...

1708
01:31:43,521 --> 01:31:44,666
Kunjumon PP?

1709
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:46,885
Kunjumon PP?

1710
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:50,072
Kunjumon PP!
- Present, Teacher!

1711
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:55,219
When I was expelled for failing in
the same class for the 3rd time,

1712
01:31:55,516 --> 01:31:57,399
I had only one dream.

1713
01:32:00,074 --> 01:32:02,834
A face that made a boy who was wearing
half-shorts in the LP school,

1714
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:05,528
dream to become today's
'King of the lake'.

1715
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:07,520
Ashwathi Ramachandran.

1716
01:32:08,349 --> 01:32:09,349
My Achu.

1717
01:32:10,385 --> 01:32:11,963
Kunjetta, I...

1718
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:14,509
Whatever I've achieved,
was for you.

1719
01:32:15,287 --> 01:32:17,197
Whatever I'm going to achieve,
is for you.

1720
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,483
The house from
'Vinnaithaandi'...

1721
01:32:20,187 --> 01:32:24,081
... and my Taj Mahal that I'm
building for you, in 8000 sq. ft.

1722
01:32:24,694 --> 01:32:25,874
All that is for you!

1723
01:32:27,402 --> 01:32:28,583
Ever since I can remember,

1724
01:32:29,342 --> 01:32:30,505
you've been in my heart!

1725
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:33,847
I won't let you go,
for anything or anyone!

1726
01:32:34,558 --> 01:32:37,542
I swear! I swear!
I swear!

1727
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:41,104
Oh my God!
I swear!

1728
01:32:55,941 --> 01:32:57,086
Oh my God!

1729
01:32:58,237 --> 01:32:59,362
So you didn't tell him?

1730
01:33:00,151 --> 01:33:02,049
How do I tell him, Manoharetta?

1731
01:33:02,471 --> 01:33:05,645
If I can't forget Satya,
whom I've known only for 3 years,

1732
01:33:05,661 --> 01:33:08,700
how do I tell someone who has had
only me in his heart since childhood,

1733
01:33:08,731 --> 01:33:10,327
that I love someone else?

1734
01:33:10,352 --> 01:33:12,935
I don't know anything. Try
to convince him somehow.

1735
01:33:12,959 --> 01:33:14,242
Manoharetta!

1736
01:33:15,219 --> 01:33:16,219
Oh no!

1737
01:33:17,297 --> 01:33:19,132
Kunjatta, I've been waiting for so long!

1738
01:33:19,784 --> 01:33:21,030
You're standing here?

1739
01:33:21,055 --> 01:33:22,763
Come there.
- Go! Get everything ready.

1740
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:25,569
Are you going to dance now?
- We might have to.

1741
01:33:25,594 --> 01:33:28,914
Have you given dates to 2
grooms for match-making today?

1742
01:33:28,954 --> 01:33:30,310
I don't get you.
- He has come here.

1743
01:33:30,335 --> 01:33:31,897
Who?
- That guy from Bangalore.

1744
01:33:31,922 --> 01:33:33,439
800 Crores guy.
Satya!

1745
01:33:33,543 --> 01:33:35,014
What is he doing here?
- I don't know.

1746
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:36,514
Looks like he's coming here.

1747
01:33:36,561 --> 01:33:38,501
What about them?
- Get rid of them somehow.

1748
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:39,561
Or it will be a clash.

1749
01:33:40,811 --> 01:33:42,282
Who asked you to
buy so much stuff?

1750
01:33:42,326 --> 01:33:44,657
Buying snacks is a problem now?
- They should finish eating, right?

1751
01:33:48,153 --> 01:33:49,382
You didn't eat anything, Kunjumon!

1752
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:51,694
Until he gets married,
boss won't eat anything.

1753
01:33:51,797 --> 01:33:52,912
Sudhi...
- Please eat.

1754
01:33:52,936 --> 01:33:54,813
Didn't work?
Then please eat.

1755
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:57,901
Let's leave quickly before the bad time
starts after the inauspicious time.

1756
01:33:57,926 --> 01:33:59,825
Bad time?
Is there a time like that?

1757
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:01,638
It wasn't there,
but it can come anytime!

1758
01:34:01,941 --> 01:34:04,067
Shall we leave? Come, Chetta.

1759
01:34:04,116 --> 01:34:06,708
Are all of you leaving?
You didn't eat anything!

1760
01:34:06,748 --> 01:34:08,886
Take it in your hand.
You can eat it on the way back.

1761
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,450
Chetta, the boat will leave. Go fast.
- Please come.

1762
01:34:12,692 --> 01:34:15,043
Oops! I forgot something.
- Enough!

1763
01:34:15,129 --> 01:34:17,131
You've got enough blessings.
It's already too much.

1764
01:34:17,156 --> 01:34:19,520
Bye, Manoharan.
- He's a respectful guy.

1765
01:34:19,822 --> 01:34:20,822
Phew!

1766
01:34:40,432 --> 01:34:41,994
He came looking for
you, Manoharettan.

1767
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:44,206
Look who's here!

1768
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:45,999
Where were you all this while?

1769
01:34:46,058 --> 01:34:48,229
We were all waiting for you.

1770
01:34:48,742 --> 01:34:50,488
Yes.
- Didn't you recognize him, Master?

1771
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:52,053
Who is he?
- No one recognized him?

1772
01:34:52,078 --> 01:34:53,679
No.
- I also don't.

1773
01:34:53,843 --> 01:34:55,412
Didn't you recognize him?
- Master...

1774
01:34:56,317 --> 01:34:57,631
Master!
- Yes.

1775
01:34:59,512 --> 01:35:00,590
Master!

1776
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:03,173
Did you recognize him?

1777
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:06,531
He's a new Master who has to come to teach
some new subjects, at our tutorial college.

1778
01:35:06,587 --> 01:35:07,712
He's a Master?
- Yes.

1779
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,126
Master?
- Yeah.

1780
01:35:09,854 --> 01:35:13,524
From his attire, I thought he's a
student who came to get admission.

1781
01:35:13,549 --> 01:35:14,757
What's your name, Master?

1782
01:35:14,797 --> 01:35:15,820
Satya.

1783
01:35:15,859 --> 01:35:17,623
Why don't you come inside then?
- No!

1784
01:35:17,648 --> 01:35:18,756
It's not time for that yet.

1785
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:20,928
We have to discuss
about the salary.

1786
01:35:20,986 --> 01:35:22,288
Right?
Come, dear.

1787
01:35:23,788 --> 01:35:25,616
Such a nice boy, right Master?

1788
01:35:26,249 --> 01:35:27,678
Why did you come here now?

1789
01:35:27,732 --> 01:35:29,615
Now me coming here is a problem?

1790
01:35:29,752 --> 01:35:32,858
You left me there for them to kill me,
and came here to get her married?

1791
01:35:32,896 --> 01:35:34,823
It's not a wedding.
They just had some tea.

1792
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:36,118
Tea?
- Manoharan, have some tea.

1793
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,864
See! Tea!
That's all!

1794
01:35:37,896 --> 01:35:39,808
Then why did you say that I'm a Master?

1795
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:41,739
Can I make you a Principal
as soon as you came?

1796
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:46,184
It will be fun.
Come, Master.

1797
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:47,386
Will it be a problem?
- No!

1798
01:35:51,184 --> 01:35:52,520
Go wear a shawl and come.

1799
01:35:52,999 --> 01:35:54,242
Why do I need a shawl now?

1800
01:35:54,436 --> 01:35:55,962
Kids these days...

1801
01:36:00,056 --> 01:36:01,056
Hey!

1802
01:36:04,765 --> 01:36:05,922
What all have you studied?

1803
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:08,035
I have passed M.Com.

1804
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:11,451
Will that be enough to
tame those naughty guys?

1805
01:36:11,656 --> 01:36:12,656
Master...

1806
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:15,501
Though the tutorial college is
in my granddaughter's name,

1807
01:36:15,526 --> 01:36:17,485
it's he who runs it.

1808
01:36:19,888 --> 01:36:21,938
Before I finished,
she is here!

1809
01:36:22,946 --> 01:36:24,001
This is my granddaughter.

1810
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:25,325
Ashwathi.

1811
01:36:25,576 --> 01:36:26,673
And a happy news...

1812
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:28,657
We fixed her wedding today.

1813
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:31,051
Slightly...

1814
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,173
Hello.
- Hello!

1815
01:36:35,885 --> 01:36:37,467
She studied in Bangalore.

1816
01:36:37,593 --> 01:36:40,353
It was Manoharan who brought
this proposal as well.

1817
01:36:45,561 --> 01:36:47,489
Thank you very much.
We had a great time.

1818
01:36:47,529 --> 01:36:49,130
See you during the next holidays.

1819
01:36:49,169 --> 01:36:51,609
No! No! You must come
for my marriage!

1820
01:36:51,634 --> 01:36:53,678
Your marriage? - Yeah.
- Oh wow!

1821
01:36:53,703 --> 01:36:55,659
My first and last marriage!

1822
01:36:55,698 --> 01:36:57,173
That'd be great!

1823
01:36:57,198 --> 01:36:59,525
Come with your family.
- Definitely! Sure! Thanks a lot.

1824
01:37:00,095 --> 01:37:02,351
See you next time.
- Thank you very much.

1825
01:37:02,882 --> 01:37:04,538
Our boss is too good.

1826
01:37:04,742 --> 01:37:07,124
He speaks English so easily!

1827
01:37:07,602 --> 01:37:08,787
Not just easily...

1828
01:37:08,812 --> 01:37:12,195
Who else can speak English
like our boss in this village?

1829
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,799
Get me some poison, Iago...
- The foreigners haven't left?

1830
01:37:16,431 --> 01:37:18,364
I will not expostulate with her.

1831
01:37:18,819 --> 01:37:20,905
Lest her body and beauty...

1832
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:24,405
unprovide my mind
this night, Iago.

1833
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:27,446
And Iago says, 'Do it not with poison'.

1834
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:29,719
'Strangle her in her bed'.

1835
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:31,540
Othello says...

1836
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:34,601
Boss, your wedding is fixed?
Aren't you going to invite us?

1837
01:37:34,774 --> 01:37:36,453
Definitely...
I won't invite you.

1838
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,539
Okay then.

1839
01:37:57,887 --> 01:37:59,949
So that their love
doesn't part ways,

1840
01:38:00,067 --> 01:38:02,004
and that your life won't get ruined,

1841
01:38:02,234 --> 01:38:03,582
I am informing this to you.

1842
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:07,323
Is this why you called
me in such a hurry?

1843
01:38:08,066 --> 01:38:10,097
Someone jealous of you
might have written this!

1844
01:38:10,819 --> 01:38:12,274
I understood who it is.

1845
01:38:12,992 --> 01:38:13,992
Who is it?

1846
01:38:14,017 --> 01:38:16,388
Abjud Kamshi..
- Abjud Kamshi...

1847
01:38:16,442 --> 01:38:17,902
From his name, seems
like he's a Bengali.

1848
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:19,403
Will a Bengali write
in Malayalam?

1849
01:38:19,428 --> 01:38:21,505
Not Abjud Kamshi.
Abhyuthayakamshi (well-wisher).

1850
01:38:21,745 --> 01:38:23,291
You don't even know
to read Malayalam!

1851
01:38:24,637 --> 01:38:26,074
The font was such!

1852
01:38:27,817 --> 01:38:29,074
This is a tension now.

1853
01:38:29,099 --> 01:38:30,099
For me too.

1854
01:38:30,442 --> 01:38:34,135
What if there's some problem like it's
mentioned in this letter? - That's what.

1855
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:39,227
Anyway, she studied in
some other place, right?

1856
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:41,438
There might be some scratches and dents.
- Yes.

1857
01:38:41,523 --> 01:38:43,860
Sudhi, you can say
anything about me.

1858
01:38:44,057 --> 01:38:45,924
But if you say something
about that poor girl?

1859
01:38:45,949 --> 01:38:47,387
I'll drown you in this lake!

1860
01:38:48,637 --> 01:38:49,808
Manoharetta!

1861
01:38:50,312 --> 01:38:52,566
Though he's a loser..
- Yes!

1862
01:38:53,152 --> 01:38:56,874
It's about a wedding, right?
We can reconsider our decision, right?

1863
01:38:57,603 --> 01:38:58,603
Manoharetta...

1864
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:01,233
My Achu won't do all that.
I'm sure.

1865
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:02,905
What are you sure about?
- I am sure.

1866
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:06,124
When I got such a letter,
I wanted to let you know.

1867
01:39:06,156 --> 01:39:07,156
That's all.

1868
01:39:07,538 --> 01:39:09,108
Even if everyone
else says whatever,

1869
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:11,989
you shouldn't have
said so, Manoharettan!

1870
01:39:12,014 --> 01:39:13,765
You shouldn't have!
- You shouldn't have!

1871
01:39:14,742 --> 01:39:15,742
I shouldn't have!

1872
01:39:16,808 --> 01:39:18,319
But since it's a wedding...
- Please!

1873
01:39:18,769 --> 01:39:20,811
But before making a decision...
- Manoharetta...

1874
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:22,340
No?
- No!

1875
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:25,871
Okay then.

1876
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:27,840
Come.

1877
01:39:29,432 --> 01:39:31,141
This is why all post
offices shut down.

1878
01:39:31,496 --> 01:39:34,016
Bloody Abjud Kamshi.
- Oh my God!

1879
01:39:34,873 --> 01:39:36,429
It's so hot.
- Take it away!

1880
01:39:38,974 --> 01:39:41,968
You shouldn't be riding this boat.
You should be driving a ship!

1881
01:39:43,226 --> 01:39:45,151
You and your ancient tricks!

1882
01:39:45,176 --> 01:39:47,726
My dear Manoharettan,
he's head over heels in love.

1883
01:39:47,829 --> 01:39:49,722
He won't back out, with
an anonymous letter.

1884
01:39:49,777 --> 01:39:52,268
But what did I do?
- So didn't you write the letter?

1885
01:39:52,387 --> 01:39:53,618
Your dad wrote it!

1886
01:39:53,643 --> 01:39:54,844
Dad wouldn't have written it.

1887
01:39:54,976 --> 01:39:55,976
So you didn't write it?

1888
01:39:56,158 --> 01:39:58,192
Not me. - Then who?
- Then who?

1889
01:39:58,694 --> 01:39:59,694
Then who?

1890
01:39:59,741 --> 01:40:03,207
Past, present, future, love
failure, humiliation...

1891
01:40:03,257 --> 01:40:04,981
I can predict all of these!

1892
01:40:06,057 --> 01:40:07,342
Just 100 Rupees!

1893
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:13,636
It's true that both of them
are from this village.

1894
01:40:13,661 --> 01:40:14,903
And we know the groom too.

1895
01:40:14,981 --> 01:40:18,237
But should we be so progressive, that we
needn't match the horoscopes, teacher?

1896
01:40:18,637 --> 01:40:21,003
I came to know only now that the
horoscopes weren't checked.

1897
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,105
That doesn't matter.

1898
01:40:23,485 --> 01:40:24,930
Times are changing, right?

1899
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:28,696
After both of them meeting, talking to
each other, and fixing the wedding,

1900
01:40:28,734 --> 01:40:30,466
what's the point in
checking horoscopes now?

1901
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:33,836
You know the fate of the liberals
who built a wall, right?

1902
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,520
But still..
- Don't say anything, Teacher.

1903
01:40:35,545 --> 01:40:37,029
I will convince Manoharettan.

1904
01:40:37,059 --> 01:40:38,918
Then I'll come with the
right guy for this.

1905
01:40:45,484 --> 01:40:46,574
Stop.

1906
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:48,035
Why did you get so late?

1907
01:40:48,154 --> 01:40:49,523
We're not coming in a car, right?

1908
01:40:49,563 --> 01:40:51,380
Climb up.
- We came on a boat, right?

1909
01:40:51,405 --> 01:40:52,991
Shouldn't I come?
- Help him up.

1910
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:55,140
Hey! Will it be happen?

1911
01:40:55,709 --> 01:40:57,113
We need to stop it,
not make it happen, right?

1912
01:40:57,175 --> 01:41:00,173
Yes. - Don't worry about anything.
I've taught him everything. Say it!

1913
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,293
Past, present, future.
I'll sort everything out.

1914
01:41:02,318 --> 01:41:04,122
Just 100 Rupees.
- Forget the past.

1915
01:41:04,447 --> 01:41:06,747
Whatever happens,
their horoscopes shouldn't match.

1916
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:07,821
Just 50 Rupees.

1917
01:41:08,144 --> 01:41:09,722
50 Rupees, fine.
Don't reduce it any further.

1918
01:41:09,747 --> 01:41:11,236
No.
Come...

1919
01:41:14,285 --> 01:41:16,062
O Almighty!

1920
01:41:18,141 --> 01:41:19,583
Oh no!

1921
01:41:19,608 --> 01:41:21,194
What is it?
- Tell me the truth.

1922
01:41:21,404 --> 01:41:22,973
Did you bring me to get
my horoscope torn?

1923
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:24,656
What is it?
- Do you know who that is?

1924
01:41:25,002 --> 01:41:26,126
Attukal Ramakrishnan.

1925
01:41:26,263 --> 01:41:29,040
Who's that?
- An expert in this subject. - Is it?

1926
01:41:29,182 --> 01:41:31,580
He will kill me, if he sees me.
- Then take the money.

1927
01:41:31,817 --> 01:41:33,220
I don't want your money or anything.
- Manoharan!

1928
01:41:33,268 --> 01:41:35,413
Come here.
- No boat? - Swim & go!

1929
01:41:38,796 --> 01:41:39,796
Master...

1930
01:41:40,408 --> 01:41:42,626
I don't understand
how this happened.

1931
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:45,022
What?
- In the horoscope of this girl,

1932
01:41:45,047 --> 01:41:46,693
I can see a major curse.

1933
01:41:46,718 --> 01:41:47,895
Oh no!
What is it?

1934
01:41:47,995 --> 01:41:51,047
The girl born on 'Purada' star sign,
on a no-moon night,

1935
01:41:51,115 --> 01:41:53,190
will not have a
happy married life.

1936
01:41:53,508 --> 01:41:54,875
Oh no!
- Master!

1937
01:41:59,515 --> 01:42:00,515
That means?

1938
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,111
It means that she
will become a widow.

1939
01:42:02,136 --> 01:42:04,140
Stop it! Stop painting!
Enough! Enough!

1940
01:42:04,165 --> 01:42:05,174
Enough!

1941
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,367
But, on the night of
Pournami (full moon)...

1942
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,421
Isn't that an adult film?

1943
01:42:09,011 --> 01:42:12,223
a male horoscope,
born with the star sign 'Punartham'...

1944
01:42:12,654 --> 01:42:15,090
will solve all the horoscope
issues of this girl.

1945
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,562
Both these horoscopes
match very well.

1946
01:42:20,345 --> 01:42:21,463
Thank God!

1947
01:42:21,488 --> 01:42:23,785
The owners of these horoscopes, have a
bonding from the previous life itself.

1948
01:42:25,105 --> 01:42:26,887
Wishing you a long and
happy married life!

1949
01:42:31,415 --> 01:42:32,817
That shouldn't be happening!

1950
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:36,489
Thirumeni, keep a couple
of those shells on 'Shu'.

1951
01:42:36,507 --> 01:42:37,582
Everything will be all right.
- Keep quiet.

1952
01:42:37,607 --> 01:42:39,507
Idiot.
Speaking nonsense?

1953
01:42:39,722 --> 01:42:40,722
Let that be.

1954
01:42:41,065 --> 01:42:43,520
Who's the man who brought
the groom's horoscope?

1955
01:42:44,106 --> 01:42:45,656
Here he is.
- This is the man!

1956
01:42:48,071 --> 01:42:50,297
You are a learned man!
It's written on your face!

1957
01:42:54,674 --> 01:42:56,494
Manoharetta, have this.

1958
01:42:58,652 --> 01:43:00,339
Who doesn't wish for happiness?

1959
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:02,822
But, what if we have to
pay a huge price for it?

1960
01:43:03,047 --> 01:43:06,544
When I am here, why should
you worry about a price?

1961
01:43:07,486 --> 01:43:10,017
Don't be shattered when you hear
what I'm going to say. - No.

1962
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:13,863
Marriage is something that
will happen only once in life.

1963
01:43:13,888 --> 01:43:16,122
No! If you get divorced, it
can happen again! - Sudhi!

1964
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:20,998
So, we should be really careful
while taking that decision.

1965
01:43:21,645 --> 01:43:23,794
But we've already
taken that decision!

1966
01:43:24,356 --> 01:43:26,414
You made me take that
decision, Manoharettan.

1967
01:43:26,757 --> 01:43:29,166
Right?
- Yes.

1968
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:30,410
Yes.

1969
01:43:30,935 --> 01:43:32,427
It's a proposal that I brought...

1970
01:43:32,865 --> 01:43:34,612
So I'll tell you the truth myself.

1971
01:43:34,642 --> 01:43:35,802
Manoharetta, no!

1972
01:43:35,962 --> 01:43:37,196
I can't hold on any longer.

1973
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:38,842
Why are you holding it?
Drink it!

1974
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:41,301
Bottoms up!

1975
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:46,842
Manoharetta, tell me what it is.

1976
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:54,654
She lost her mental balance due to
the cruel ragging by the seniors...

1977
01:43:55,787 --> 01:43:58,297
and was in Kundanahalli
hospital there for two weeks.

1978
01:43:58,339 --> 01:43:59,643
It's like Kuthiravattam here.

1979
01:44:00,788 --> 01:44:03,285
She can turn violent any moment,
when she feels more love.

1980
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:05,787
A peculiar disease which
causes suicide tendency.

1981
01:44:06,865 --> 01:44:08,654
Brain wrestle-mania eyedrops.

1982
01:44:10,173 --> 01:44:12,152
When it was confirmed that it
can't be cured through medicine,

1983
01:44:12,177 --> 01:44:14,727
doctors advised to get her married to
see if there would be any improvement.

1984
01:44:16,076 --> 01:44:17,865
Her situation was so bad!

1985
01:44:17,955 --> 01:44:21,465
It's a disease that can happen to
one or two people in a million..

1986
01:44:21,484 --> 01:44:22,603
These eye-drops...

1987
01:44:22,832 --> 01:44:24,447
Even her mom had these eye-drops!

1988
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:28,300
She was picking her tooth, after
dinner, holding her child in hand.

1989
01:44:28,325 --> 01:44:31,298
She went out to get some fresh air,
jumped into the lake & committed suicide.

1990
01:44:31,323 --> 01:44:33,457
it was Manoharettan
who saved that child.

1991
01:44:33,745 --> 01:44:34,745
Yes.

1992
01:44:35,284 --> 01:44:36,581
Out of love for her..

1993
01:44:37,185 --> 01:44:39,771
and the hope that it will be cured
after her wedding... I did it.

1994
01:44:41,028 --> 01:44:42,028
But...

1995
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,914
If I don't say this
to you even now,

1996
01:44:44,553 --> 01:44:46,716
it will be the biggest
mistake I'm doing to you!

1997
01:44:48,687 --> 01:44:49,927
A proposal that I brought...

1998
01:44:50,635 --> 01:44:51,850
I'm dropping it myself.

1999
01:44:53,766 --> 01:44:55,449
This wedding should never happen.

2000
01:44:55,953 --> 01:44:57,199
Manoharetta!

2001
01:44:58,371 --> 01:44:59,505
I am also a patient.

2002
01:45:00,764 --> 01:45:03,004
Is this a hospital or what?
So many patients...

2003
01:45:03,529 --> 01:45:05,268
This disease doesn't have a cure...

2004
01:45:05,664 --> 01:45:07,929
and moreover, this disease
doesn't have eyes or ears...

2005
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:09,546
and this disease won't be cured.

2006
01:45:12,468 --> 01:45:14,101
My undying love for her.

2007
01:45:15,135 --> 01:45:18,483
Because of that... Only because of that,
I did a mistake to you.

2008
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:22,289
Mistake?
- Send that boat to the east, you idiot.

2009
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:24,791
They have reached the junction.
- Move the mic!

2010
01:45:25,072 --> 01:45:26,180
Go ahead and announce it!

2011
01:45:26,205 --> 01:45:27,542
Okay!
- Start the boat!

2012
01:45:28,095 --> 01:45:29,555
My dear people,

2013
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:31,638
The pride of this village,

2014
01:45:31,694 --> 01:45:35,334
our sweetheart and favourite,
our dear Kunjumon's...

2015
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:40,301
Puthenpuraykkal tours & travels'
fourth houseboat service...

2016
01:45:40,326 --> 01:45:42,137
Boss! They are coming.

2017
01:45:45,353 --> 01:45:47,781
Are you going to marry
Manoharan's sister, boss?

2018
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,529
Shouldn't you be showing
all this to her?

2019
01:45:49,578 --> 01:45:52,521
You idiot!
If Manoharan is impressed with me,

2020
01:45:53,164 --> 01:45:54,269
then she is my girl.

2021
01:45:54,376 --> 01:45:55,776
What I did was wrong.

2022
01:45:56,955 --> 01:45:58,084
It was due to my love.

2023
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:00,994
I did it out of my love for her.

2024
01:46:01,935 --> 01:46:05,021
But I won't surrender her for
any disease or medicine!

2025
01:46:05,242 --> 01:46:06,242
Kunjumon!

2026
01:46:07,091 --> 01:46:08,603
Let her do anything
she wants to me!

2027
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,153
Let her hit me.
Let her kill me.

2028
01:46:11,572 --> 01:46:13,372
But this Kunjumon won't
be alive without her.

2029
01:46:13,725 --> 01:46:14,725
I'll look after her.

2030
01:46:15,794 --> 01:46:17,216
I love her.

2031
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:21,611
I love her, Manoharetta.

2032
01:46:25,896 --> 01:46:27,158
Manoharetta...

2033
01:46:30,152 --> 01:46:32,003
I didn't know that she
was an unwell child.

2034
01:46:33,354 --> 01:46:34,636
It's okay.
- Manoharetta...

2035
01:46:36,753 --> 01:46:37,797
Saw who's coming?

2036
01:46:39,635 --> 01:46:41,175
Tell him.
- You tell him.

2037
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:42,652
You tell him.
- Sir...

2038
01:46:43,113 --> 01:46:44,277
Look who's coming!

2039
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:04,451
Manoharetta...
- Oh! It was the patient? I got scared.

2040
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:06,126
You carry on.
- Okay.

2041
01:47:07,458 --> 01:47:08,458
I was just...

2042
01:47:09,372 --> 01:47:11,299
Why is she going to the tutorial?

2043
01:47:11,413 --> 01:47:12,962
Who?
- Achu.

2044
01:47:13,695 --> 01:47:14,695
Well...

2045
01:47:14,959 --> 01:47:17,594
It's you and her, who have to run
the tutorial from now on, right?

2046
01:47:17,638 --> 01:47:19,296
So, to understand everything...

2047
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:20,797
What is it?

2048
01:47:20,912 --> 01:47:22,037
I was just...

2049
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:23,227
I...
- You?

2050
01:47:23,636 --> 01:47:25,254
Don't misunderstand me, Manoharettan.

2051
01:47:25,427 --> 01:47:26,521
No, I won't.

2052
01:47:27,038 --> 01:47:29,089
If I could get the
phone number...

2053
01:47:29,538 --> 01:47:31,262
That's all?
Take it.

2054
01:47:32,114 --> 01:47:37,782
Say it.
- 9847074575.

2055
01:47:38,989 --> 01:47:40,324
Don't call during
the night, okay?

2056
01:47:41,304 --> 01:47:43,010
It's tomorrow! It's tomorrow!

2057
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:44,402
Tomorrow's Kerala lottery.

2058
01:47:44,432 --> 01:47:45,805
Buy it only if you want to!

2059
01:47:48,452 --> 01:47:50,233
[Singing]

2060
01:48:03,994 --> 01:48:04,994
Hello.

2061
01:48:07,306 --> 01:48:11,985
I was busy due to the
purchase of a new boat...

2062
01:48:12,595 --> 01:48:13,938
That's why I couldn't call you.

2063
01:48:15,519 --> 01:48:16,519
For this new boat...

2064
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:19,538
I want to name it
after you, my dear.

2065
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:20,597
Shall I do so?

2066
01:48:21,751 --> 01:48:23,548
Name it Kunjatta P Kumaran.

2067
01:48:24,733 --> 01:48:26,371
Damn it!
Was it you, you scoundrel?

2068
01:48:26,482 --> 01:48:27,786
Hang up & get lost, you dog!

2069
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:33,980
Got happy in vain.

2070
01:48:38,076 --> 01:48:39,076
Very good!

2071
01:48:39,613 --> 01:48:41,200
And the crooked Iago...

2072
01:48:41,823 --> 01:48:45,441
And for Cassio,
let me be his undertaker.

2073
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:48,015
You shall hear more by midnight.

2074
01:48:56,104 --> 01:48:57,799
You should take her phone
number at least today, boss.

2075
01:48:57,838 --> 01:48:58,994
I will take it.

2076
01:48:59,187 --> 01:49:00,187
Come, let's go.

2077
01:49:00,212 --> 01:49:01,579
Get lost.
- Okay!

2078
01:49:04,009 --> 01:49:06,033
Does he look like he can
take classes so well?

2079
01:49:06,058 --> 01:49:08,600
That smile... That walk..
Moreover, he's a bachelor too.

2080
01:49:08,659 --> 01:49:10,276
Anyone would look at him!

2081
01:49:10,301 --> 01:49:11,301
That's true.

2082
01:49:57,305 --> 01:49:58,305
Kunjumon!

2083
01:49:58,935 --> 01:50:00,785
Both of them are at a young age.

2084
01:50:01,246 --> 01:50:02,577
We've seen this so many times.

2085
01:50:03,139 --> 01:50:06,634
Finally, it shouldn't be like some
random guy going away with the girl.

2086
01:50:27,935 --> 01:50:31,803
'The marquee is rising up... There's a
smile on the lips of the villagers'

2087
01:50:31,828 --> 01:50:34,506
'There's a burning ember
within the heart'

2088
01:50:35,213 --> 01:50:39,097
'The wedding flag is being hoisted...
Dreams are rising sky high'

2089
01:50:39,127 --> 01:50:41,806
'It gets more exciting
as it goes on'

2090
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:47,900
'If the sacred thread for the wedding
locket is not prepared properly'

2091
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,275
'Things will go for a toss tomorrow,
brokers will hang dead'

2092
01:50:52,306 --> 01:50:55,323
'It will be an endless deadlock, dear'

2093
01:50:55,348 --> 01:50:58,838
'Did you see this
wedding festival?'

2094
01:50:58,917 --> 01:51:02,943
'The excitement of this festival rises,
as you keep watching it'

2095
01:51:27,102 --> 01:51:30,492
'We should go buy
the wedding dress'

2096
01:51:30,711 --> 01:51:34,055
'We should invite the
entire Panchayat'

2097
01:51:34,546 --> 01:51:41,674
'White-washing all the walls,
and hanging lamps all over the way'

2098
01:51:41,702 --> 01:51:45,561
'It's a celebration at the bride's house,
the groom is in tension'

2099
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,436
'Some people to trouble him'

2100
01:51:47,461 --> 01:51:52,413
'All the ingredients are coming together,
and we are counting days to the wedding'

2101
01:51:52,557 --> 01:51:56,696
'Did you see this
wedding festival?'

2102
01:51:56,717 --> 01:52:00,410
'The excitement of this festival rises,
as you keep watching it'

2103
01:52:15,108 --> 01:52:21,997
'Who came by your door, without
anyone else seeing, O girl?'

2104
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:29,525
'Is it the breeze of the wedding Sindoor,
or the full moon, accompanying your man?'

2105
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:33,356
'As the night makes way for day,
as the heartbeats become intense'

2106
01:52:33,409 --> 01:52:37,291
'The smell and taste of the kitchen
is up in the sky, and on our tongues'

2107
01:52:37,347 --> 01:52:40,563
'This endless race will
come to an end tomorrow'

2108
01:52:40,588 --> 01:52:44,154
'Did you see this
wedding festival?'

2109
01:52:44,179 --> 01:52:48,175
'The excitement of this festival rises,
as you keep watching it'

2110
01:53:05,103 --> 01:53:07,151
You are such a
schmuck, Kunjumon!

2111
01:53:07,486 --> 01:53:08,937
What do you lack?

2112
01:53:09,132 --> 01:53:12,413
You have lots of money,
an office, houseboats...

2113
01:53:12,438 --> 01:53:15,218
... and farms too...
- Well, what about height?

2114
01:53:15,382 --> 01:53:16,561
Yeah, right!

2115
01:53:16,586 --> 01:53:20,249
I'd have gotten him a much better girl,
with this height itself.

2116
01:53:21,978 --> 01:53:24,763
Manoharan dumped this on
your head, deliberately.

2117
01:53:24,788 --> 01:53:26,088
No doubt about that.

2118
01:53:26,259 --> 01:53:27,259
Of course!

2119
01:53:27,782 --> 01:53:30,110
He will leave, taking his
commission after the wedding.

2120
01:53:30,381 --> 01:53:34,703
Then it will be my boss, who has to carry
someone else's dirty linen for a lifetime!

2121
01:53:34,828 --> 01:53:38,992
Your boss' life remains, to guard
her from jumping over the fence.

2122
01:53:39,017 --> 01:53:41,898
You!!
- Why are you getting angry at him?

2123
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:43,397
What's wrong in what he said?

2124
01:53:43,989 --> 01:53:46,186
There are some games going on,
without anyone knowing.

2125
01:53:46,211 --> 01:53:47,912
No one believes us, right?

2126
01:53:47,998 --> 01:53:49,996
It's a proposal brought
by Manoharan, right?

2127
01:53:50,512 --> 01:53:52,719
If this is her game towards you,
who are going to marry her,

2128
01:53:52,744 --> 01:53:55,214
what all games she would
have played, at that city?

2129
01:53:55,386 --> 01:53:57,439
You scoundrel!
- Leave him!

2130
01:53:57,573 --> 01:54:00,893
If you have so much daring,
you shouldn't be showing it to him.

2131
01:54:00,922 --> 01:54:03,537
Ask her why she's giving
affection to that Master,

2132
01:54:03,578 --> 01:54:06,741
without giving you, her prospective groom!
- I will ask her!

2133
01:54:06,766 --> 01:54:09,811
You should ask her!
You have only one night to ask her that.

2134
01:54:09,836 --> 01:54:11,259
I will ask her tonight,
right away!

2135
01:54:11,369 --> 01:54:13,242
She will know who this Kunjumon is!

2136
01:54:13,688 --> 01:54:14,688
Move!

2137
01:54:16,691 --> 01:54:17,691
He left?

2138
01:54:19,807 --> 01:54:22,089
Chedathi, did it work?

2139
01:54:22,245 --> 01:54:23,878
How can it not work?

2140
01:54:24,244 --> 01:54:26,854
That Manoharan's game would end today!

2141
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,969
This Tresyamma will end it!

2142
01:54:36,757 --> 01:54:38,546
You're so naive, Manoharetta.

2143
01:54:39,828 --> 01:54:41,586
You've conducted
so many weddings!

2144
01:54:41,866 --> 01:54:45,041
But you couldn't even
stop this one wedding!

2145
01:54:45,588 --> 01:54:48,571
First you gave a word here,
that you'll get her married to Kunjumon.

2146
01:54:49,150 --> 01:54:52,235
Later you gave a word in Bangalore,
that you'll get her married to Satya.

2147
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:55,996
Even after fooling Teacher,
Master and these villagers...

2148
01:54:56,543 --> 01:54:59,327
We couldn't stop the wedding
that was fixed, Manoharetta!

2149
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:03,266
You can't do it, Manoharetta.
You can't!

2150
01:55:06,711 --> 01:55:07,953
If nothing works,

2151
01:55:08,888 --> 01:55:11,216
there's a final act
of 'Throwing dust in the eye'.

2152
01:55:11,648 --> 01:55:12,880
I will do that finally.

2153
01:55:42,861 --> 01:55:44,298
What are you doing here, Kunjettan?

2154
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:45,846
To tell her something.

2155
01:55:45,871 --> 01:55:47,791
Speak softly.
This is a bride's house.

2156
01:55:47,838 --> 01:55:49,017
Who does she think she is?

2157
01:55:49,342 --> 01:55:51,107
Even after walking in
front of me for so long,

2158
01:55:51,146 --> 01:55:53,885
has she ever felt like talking to me,
or even looking at me?

2159
01:55:54,826 --> 01:55:56,429
She can talk to the outsider
who came yesterday!

2160
01:55:57,884 --> 01:55:59,446
I don't have good looks
or education, right?

2161
01:55:59,712 --> 01:56:00,743
I'm not tall either.

2162
01:56:01,072 --> 01:56:02,360
By my love within is true!

2163
01:56:03,381 --> 01:56:05,053
This love and
nonsense is useless.

2164
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:09,000
Or, if the love is true,
can't it be recognized?

2165
01:56:10,226 --> 01:56:11,258
You tell me.

2166
01:56:11,594 --> 01:56:12,594
No, Kunjetta.

2167
01:56:15,296 --> 01:56:17,419
It's hard to
recognize true love.

2168
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:19,528
If it could be recognized,

2169
01:56:19,991 --> 01:56:21,889
you wouldn't have asked
this to me, Kunjettan.

2170
01:56:24,798 --> 01:56:25,798
Akshay...

2171
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:27,641
Ajmal...

2172
01:56:28,614 --> 01:56:29,614
Akash...

2173
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:31,001
Bhaskar...

2174
01:56:31,397 --> 01:56:32,498
Kunjumon PP...

2175
01:56:33,059 --> 01:56:34,059
Kunjumon PP?

2176
01:56:37,012 --> 01:56:38,012
Sorry.

2177
01:56:54,549 --> 01:56:56,880
Couldn't you hint it
to me at least once?

2178
01:56:57,725 --> 01:57:00,091
What can I say to you,
when your wedding has been fixed?

2179
01:57:01,484 --> 01:57:04,477
If Achu's mistake was that she
didn't recognize your love.

2180
01:57:05,075 --> 01:57:07,910
You did the same mistake to someone else.

2181
01:57:09,023 --> 01:57:10,023
To me.

2182
01:57:11,332 --> 01:57:12,363
Love...

2183
01:57:12,872 --> 01:57:14,246
It's hard to recognize it.

2184
01:57:29,635 --> 01:57:30,635
Move! Move!

2185
01:57:37,568 --> 01:57:38,568
Did you know?

2186
01:57:39,387 --> 01:57:41,519
Yesterday... He.. Missing...

2187
01:57:41,681 --> 01:57:42,840
What is he saying?

2188
01:57:43,446 --> 01:57:44,871
Since yesterday night,

2189
01:57:44,945 --> 01:57:46,778
our Kunjumon has gone missing.

2190
01:57:46,982 --> 01:57:48,232
Really?
- Yes.

2191
01:57:49,427 --> 01:57:51,942
After a long 22 years,

2192
01:57:52,091 --> 01:57:54,232
a wedding has been cancelled
in our Mullakkara.

2193
01:57:54,703 --> 01:57:56,985
But this was too much!
- So sad.

2194
01:57:57,016 --> 01:57:59,656
That poor Master..
- How will he bear this?

2195
01:57:59,681 --> 01:58:00,948
'Shop closed today'

2196
01:58:13,605 --> 01:58:14,605
Look!

2197
01:58:17,464 --> 01:58:18,699
It's a sad scene, bro.

2198
01:58:19,183 --> 01:58:20,428
Support me strongly!

2199
01:58:21,818 --> 01:58:23,084
My dear child, Master...

2200
01:58:24,134 --> 01:58:25,505
Go!
- Master!

2201
01:58:25,649 --> 01:58:27,248
What am I hearing?
- Crying, right?

2202
01:58:28,241 --> 01:58:29,241
Manoharan...

2203
01:58:29,987 --> 01:58:31,364
All the villagers are here.

2204
01:58:31,724 --> 01:58:33,568
The marquee and the
feast are ready.

2205
01:58:33,803 --> 01:58:36,975
To be in a situation in which the
groom is missing on the wedding day?

2206
01:58:37,017 --> 01:58:38,817
How can I face the
villagers now?

2207
01:58:40,897 --> 01:58:41,974
Teacher...

2208
01:58:43,626 --> 01:58:46,260
If my child does
something drastic...

2209
01:58:46,337 --> 01:58:48,384
... we won't stay alive.
- Oh God!

2210
01:58:48,409 --> 01:58:51,291
Our Thomas sir's daughter
took poison & died. - Oh no!

2211
01:58:51,683 --> 01:58:52,750
Say it.
Say it!

2212
01:58:53,364 --> 01:58:54,401
Master...

2213
01:58:54,503 --> 01:58:55,568
Shall I say something?

2214
01:58:55,639 --> 01:58:57,269
What's the point in
saying anything now?

2215
01:58:57,764 --> 01:59:00,753
You had warned me back then itself,
that we don't need this proposal!

2216
01:59:00,778 --> 01:59:02,082
True.

2217
01:59:02,207 --> 01:59:05,833
You brought so many good proposals for her.
- Yes.

2218
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:09,276
We wished that she should
be near us, always.

2219
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:14,002
And now, what have
we done to her life?

2220
01:59:14,631 --> 01:59:15,631
Say it!

2221
01:59:16,106 --> 01:59:18,404
Manoharan... You tell me.

2222
01:59:18,711 --> 01:59:20,634
What should we do now?

2223
01:59:22,056 --> 01:59:23,102
Master...

2224
01:59:23,352 --> 01:59:24,695
If you nod your head,

2225
01:59:24,969 --> 01:59:27,476
we'll get her married to a
better boy than that Lilliput,

2226
01:59:27,501 --> 01:59:28,998
at the time we already decided.

2227
01:59:29,023 --> 01:59:30,234
Nod your head, Master.

2228
01:59:31,257 --> 01:59:32,257
Where's your hand?

2229
01:59:32,557 --> 01:59:33,953
Everything will be beautiful.

2230
01:59:35,929 --> 01:59:36,929
Nod your head, Master.

2231
02:00:12,982 --> 02:00:14,539
Here.
Give the 'Dakshina' to Manoharan.

2232
02:00:16,554 --> 02:00:17,728
That's amazing!

2233
02:00:20,481 --> 02:00:22,327
The drama was fantastic!

2234
02:00:24,538 --> 02:00:25,905
What a screenplay!

2235
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,366
Such amazing acting!

2236
02:00:27,881 --> 02:00:29,295
Many years back,

2237
02:00:29,373 --> 02:00:32,599
you barged into a similar
wedding I had fixed,

2238
02:00:32,624 --> 02:00:33,896
and destroyed my career!

2239
02:00:34,634 --> 02:00:35,704
But...

2240
02:00:36,056 --> 02:00:37,672
Today is my day!

2241
02:00:39,668 --> 02:00:42,862
Tresyamma, this is not the place to
settle the problems between you both.

2242
02:00:42,887 --> 02:00:44,218
It's my granddaughter's wedding.

2243
02:00:44,484 --> 02:00:46,648
Please don't create any trouble.

2244
02:00:46,849 --> 02:00:48,928
I haven't come to
create trouble, Master.

2245
02:00:49,339 --> 02:00:51,287
We came to attend the wedding.

2246
02:00:52,967 --> 02:00:56,601
But where's the groom you had
fixed her marriage with?

2247
02:00:57,795 --> 02:00:59,600
You needn't interfere in all that.

2248
02:00:59,707 --> 02:01:02,121
Manoharan & I will decide all that.
- That's it.

2249
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:04,511
One answer for all the questions.

2250
02:01:04,645 --> 02:01:05,645
Manoharan.

2251
02:01:05,956 --> 02:01:07,050
Tresyamma...

2252
02:01:07,075 --> 02:01:09,855
If he says something, then there
are no questions or answers!

2253
02:01:10,652 --> 02:01:13,457
But there is someone
like this here, right?

2254
02:01:13,859 --> 02:01:16,960
First you gave a word here,
that you'll get her married to Kunjumon.

2255
02:01:17,476 --> 02:01:20,530
Later you gave a word in Bangalore,
that you'll get her married to Satya.

2256
02:01:20,862 --> 02:01:24,243
Even after fooling Teacher,
Master and these villagers...

2257
02:01:24,374 --> 02:01:27,172
We couldn't stop the wedding
that was fixed, Manoharetta!

2258
02:01:29,094 --> 02:01:30,322
He is a cheat!

2259
02:01:31,837 --> 02:01:33,806
By pimping her to this guy,

2260
02:01:33,831 --> 02:01:37,290
and taking commission to snatch
your money and wealth that way...

2261
02:01:37,407 --> 02:01:39,711
.. this wedding is a drama
that he's performing!

2262
02:01:40,001 --> 02:01:41,344
Otherwise let him say,

2263
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,180
that he doesn't know
this guy already.

2264
02:01:46,099 --> 02:01:47,208
Master, I...

2265
02:01:47,919 --> 02:01:49,028
Is she saying the truth?

2266
02:01:49,542 --> 02:01:51,075
Did you know him earlier?

2267
02:01:51,828 --> 02:01:53,416
Did you know him?

2268
02:01:55,584 --> 02:01:58,704
I considered you like
my own son so far.

2269
02:01:58,826 --> 02:02:01,338
I have only trusted
everything you've told me.

2270
02:02:01,448 --> 02:02:04,596
And you did this to me?
- Master, I...

2271
02:02:04,961 --> 02:02:06,072
Master...

2272
02:02:07,781 --> 02:02:10,792
Tell me.
What was your intention?

2273
02:02:11,562 --> 02:02:13,987
Wouldn't I give you anything,
if you had asked me?

2274
02:02:14,061 --> 02:02:15,232
Tell me!

2275
02:02:15,444 --> 02:02:16,577
It was my choice.

2276
02:02:17,868 --> 02:02:19,748
Manoharettan did all this for me.

2277
02:02:23,803 --> 02:02:25,860
She is like my daughter, Master.

2278
02:02:27,389 --> 02:02:28,896
What intention
would I have then?

2279
02:02:32,528 --> 02:02:34,894
I am a brother who had to
stay away from my own sister,

2280
02:02:35,449 --> 02:02:37,544
because I never realized
what she wanted.

2281
02:02:39,136 --> 02:02:41,737
I only wished that you shouldn't
go through what I did, Master.

2282
02:02:43,917 --> 02:02:45,284
But there's one thing, Master.

2283
02:02:45,886 --> 02:02:47,112
When it comes to marriage,

2284
02:02:47,732 --> 02:02:49,847
the consent of the girl is
the most important factor.

2285
02:02:52,732 --> 02:02:53,802
It's her choice.

2286
02:02:54,896 --> 02:02:55,896
It's her life.

2287
02:02:56,732 --> 02:02:57,732
Agree to it, Master.

2288
02:03:00,312 --> 02:03:01,610
Everything will be beautiful.

2289
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:04,070
It's all for the good, Master.

2290
02:03:10,785 --> 02:03:14,771
Well, where did our earlier
groom Kunjumon go?

2291
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,062
I raised her so well.

2292
02:03:19,117 --> 02:03:22,140
I will kill myself.
I won't stay alive.

2293
02:03:22,181 --> 02:03:24,924
There's no point in
crying like a dog now.

2294
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:27,414
I had told her back then itself,
not to let her loose.

2295
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:30,305
It must be our daughter.
Go and check.

2296
02:03:32,321 --> 02:03:33,321
Open it.

2297
02:03:42,382 --> 02:03:45,115
We didn't know anything, Manoharetta.
I swear!

2298
02:03:52,618 --> 02:03:53,714
Don't cry, you fool.

2299
02:03:57,596 --> 02:03:59,103
Years back,

2300
02:03:59,565 --> 02:04:01,135
within one moment,

2301
02:04:01,455 --> 02:04:02,931
if I could get you both married,

2302
02:04:04,325 --> 02:04:06,605
without this Manoharan's knowledge,
in this Mullakkara,

2303
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:09,369
no eloping would happen,

2304
02:04:10,558 --> 02:04:12,067
and neither would a wedding happen!

2305
02:04:14,461 --> 02:04:15,691
If nothing else works,

2306
02:04:16,349 --> 02:04:18,386
there's a final act
of 'Throwing dust in the eye'.

2307
02:04:19,104 --> 02:04:20,292
I will do that finally.

2308
02:04:30,056 --> 02:04:31,056
I'm coming!

2309
02:04:45,283 --> 02:04:46,283
Manoharetta...

2310
02:04:51,532 --> 02:04:52,552
You?

2311
02:04:52,669 --> 02:04:53,669
I...

2312
02:04:58,180 --> 02:04:59,372
Not the one we love...

2313
02:05:00,939 --> 02:05:03,362
We should live our life with
the one who loves us.

2314
02:05:04,708 --> 02:05:06,098
Please help us, Manoharettan.

2315
02:05:06,536 --> 02:05:07,536
Us?

2316
02:05:16,518 --> 02:05:17,765
We have to get down!

2317
02:05:19,827 --> 02:05:20,920
And where are they?

2318
02:05:32,311 --> 02:05:33,311
Hello!

2319
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:35,298
Dear, you...
- Mom!

2320
02:05:35,423 --> 02:05:36,751
This is our first night.

2321
02:05:36,928 --> 02:05:38,031
I'll call you later.

2322
02:05:44,199 --> 02:05:45,199
For dad...

2323
02:05:46,074 --> 02:05:48,219
Hello?
- The problems here are all solved.

2324
02:05:49,390 --> 02:05:50,550
Ask them to come to Kerala.

2325
02:05:51,903 --> 02:05:53,913
Along with them,
all of you should also come.

2326
02:06:00,486 --> 02:06:01,486
Did you understand now?

2327
02:06:02,076 --> 02:06:04,279
Without the knowledge of
Manoharan in this Mullakkara,

2328
02:06:04,302 --> 02:06:05,536
no first night...

2329
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:08,060
Who's next?

2330
02:06:17,391 --> 02:06:18,391
What is she doing here?

2331
02:06:18,963 --> 02:06:20,210
What's the time?

2332
02:06:22,838 --> 02:06:24,033
9.30 PM.

2333
02:06:25,822 --> 02:06:27,463
The hag has gone mad!

2334
02:06:28,826 --> 02:06:30,574
I have to go to Thrissur.

2335
02:06:31,905 --> 02:06:35,074
I have to find a good groom
for actress Samyuktha Varma.

2336
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:42,296
Am I okay?
