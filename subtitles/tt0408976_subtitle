00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,334
Friends, the book-launch for which
we've congregated here, today.

3
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:23,415
The author of that book
need not be introduced.

4
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,334
The ink of his pen has
always left a mark on our minds.

5
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:33,875
That person is none other
than our very own Siddharth Das.

6
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,541
Come, please.

7
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,458
Things that have been said
and things that haven't been said.

8
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,042
The stories of this book were
facets of reality, once upon a time.

9
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,457
Those bygone moments,
are still alive..

10
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,084
..in this book,
in the form of words.

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:18,832
Yes. Nine and half!

12
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:25,875
Friends, this book has
a story, it's incomplete.

13
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,416
it’s unsaid. Neither have l been
able to think of the end of this..

14
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,416
..story nor will l ever be
able to know about it.

15
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:44,750
That's why.. that's why this
story is incomplete, even today.

16
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:58,084
l proudly dedicate this
story book to your college.

17
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,791
Principal, this
room of the college..

18
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:08,208
..has been closed for years,
isn't it? - Yes.

19
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,792
This used to be the painting room.

20
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,625
We've changed it into a store room.

21
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,749
Why? Why, sir?

22
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,792
Better mind your own business.

23
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,749
Why are you keeping
the library book here?

24
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,749
l told you to mind your
own business, that's it.

25
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,499
And listen!
- Yes?

26
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,333
This room should remain
closed as it was before.

27
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,875
This room should never open,
under any circumstance.

28
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:49,750
Certain rooms, certain secrets,
are better if they remain closed.

29
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:50,208
'My delight, my tantrums, crazy
fellow, I’m scattered all over.'

30
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:56,792
'Why do you fear, come, savour me.
What else do l say to you?'

31
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:00,958
Happy-go-lucky!

32
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:23,000
'Bitter gaze on a sweet poison,
we both are happy-go-lucky!'

33
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:19,041
Slowly, you fell for me.

34
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:26,041
'As if this road, that road, all
the roads, turned towards my street.'

35
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,916
'l fell for you, the
first time l saw you.'

36
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,542
'Whether you accept or deny,
we've been bonded together.'

37
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:34,958
'From within you, slowly,
something happens to you, too.'

38
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,124
'l know it, you know it,
and everyone knows it.'

39
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,958
'Even then, why do you feel shy?'

40
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:55,125
'I’m a girl, afraid of you, don't
tease me, everyone's watching.'

41
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:02,459
'l smiled a little and got trapped,
l swear. You're too smart!'

42
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,458
Thank God that you've
returned from America.

43
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,708
Here, see for yourself, it's been
4 years, yet, nothing has changed.

44
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,499
The same clock, the same building..

45
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,332
..the same compound, the same sky.

46
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,249
Everything is the same.
Even the professors are the same.

47
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,832
You're right.
Nothing has changed here.

48
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,708
Even your habit of chattering
unnecessarily, hasn't changed.

49
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:31,917
But don't you feel that the colour
of this building is a little weird?

50
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,166
What difference does it make?

51
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,166
You're right.
What difference does it make?

52
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,166
You know, Manav.
- l know Manav.

53
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,915
No! You, Manav.
- Of course l know Manav (human).

54
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,375
You're such a.. I’ll bash you!

55
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:49,708
Manav, there're 263
girls in our college.

56
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:54,083
Out of that, he has
proposed to 261 girls.

57
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,874
But he couldn't attract even one
of them. - And the remaining two?

58
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:01,207
They're seeing each other,
what'll he do between them?

59
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:07,583
Hey pal! l forgot something.
- Where? in America?

60
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,292
Listen!

61
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,625
Your kerchief.
- This isn't mine.

62
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,125
Keep it. - But it isn't mine!
- Good, it isn't mine, too.

63
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,833
Come, let's share it.

64
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,875
Let's meet in the evening,
at the canteen.

65
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:19,249
Did you recognize?

66
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,334
Drunkard!

67
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:27,375
Why are you standing?
Please sit. it’s clean.

68
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,790
I’ll introduce you to the others.

69
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:36,208
This is Akshay. That..
Shanty! And this is Manav.

70
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,500
And this is my friend, Vishal.

71
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:45,291
Are you coming with me
in the evening? - Where?

72
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:51,250
For her engagement.
Shanty, tell her.

73
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:54,333
lf you come, we can get
to know each other better.

74
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,957
Look, she has confirmed.
it’s her engagement.

75
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,875
Later on, they'll be marrying, too.
- Everything has been fixed.

76
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:13,417
Where are the kids? They haven't
come yet. - I’ll check it up.

77
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:17,875
Oh God! People have lost gallons
of weight, waiting for you.

78
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,333
For example, look at me.

79
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,665
What's happening? Tell me.
- Nothing.

80
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,916
Nothing. We were about to kiss.

81
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,209
So what? We're going to get engaged.

82
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,665
We can kiss, isn't it?

83
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,333
Manav, why are you feeling shy?

84
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,957
He isn't a decent fellow.

85
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,374
Do you know what kinds
of movies does he watch?

86
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,459
Reshma Ki Jawani! (Reshma's
burning desires) - Shut up!

87
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,874
Just a minute.

88
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,374
Scoundrel! Did you go
to watch the movie, alone?

89
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,041
Sorry, pal. Shall l
tell you the story? - Yes.

90
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,540
it’s mind-blowing. The
promos that they shown on TV..

91
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,250
..are nothing. Balbir Pasha enters
after the 3rd scene, itself.

92
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,417
What you are saying?

93
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:40,125
Was it difficult to find the house?

94
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,874
What happened?
- Nothing.

95
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,416
Hey pal! Will you keep on
looking at each others' face..

96
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:57,500
..or will you dance a bit, too?

97
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,708
it seems you haven't
recovered from the shock, yet.

98
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,875
Don't worry,
everything will be alright.

99
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,500
The kids will drop you home.

100
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:25,916
Are you all mourning for
the soul of that chandelier?

101
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,540
Drunkard! - Yes?
- Shall l tell you something?

102
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:34,416
What? - Only if you
could've saved Disha.

103
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,041
Then you would've
got engaged to Disha..

104
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,791
..even before Manav
got engaged to Shanty.

105
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:43,583
l didn't even think about it, pal.
l lost such a good opportunity.

106
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,958
You can get another opportunity.
- How?

107
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,792
lf Disha stands under
that chandelier, once again.

108
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:55,583
Shut up! Even if Disha stands
under that chandelier again..

109
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,749
..what is the guarantee that the
chandelier will fall on her, again?

110
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,875
Do you guarantee for that?
You? Do you guarantee?

111
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,125
Do you guarantee?
- Yes. For Kabir.

112
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,832
l mean, guarantee.

113
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,291
Kabir has guaranteed to me
that he won't fall on any girl.

114
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,959
Open the door!
Kabir, what are you doing?

115
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,916
What kind of driving is this?
- Have you gone mad?

116
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,749
You apply the brakes,
You don't break the brakes.

117
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,500
Pal, l saw a wall of ice, there.
- What?

118
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,875
There isn't any ice, there.
- Here's..

119
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:50,041
Where is it? We can't see anything.

120
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,833
Where are the car's keys?
- in the car.

121
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,125
I’ll drive the car,
You sit at the back.

122
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,624
C'mon!
- C'mon!

123
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:05,209
it’s strange.
- What's happened to him?

124
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:37,415
What will you drive a car?
The tires are punctured.

125
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,332
What do we do now? The tires
are punctured, and the cold here..

126
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:46,542
..it's too cold out here.
- Then shiver.

127
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:50,666
What's that?

128
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:54,542
Do one thing, you change the tires.

129
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:56,332
Come, Kabir. Let's go.

130
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,542
Where are you going?
C'mon, change the stepny.

131
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,749
But, pal.. - Your mother
will be pleased with you.

132
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,166
But, pal.. - You couldn't
become a mechanical engineer..

133
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,707
..at least become a mechanic
and make your mother proud.

134
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:09,250
Ok, bye. I’m coming.

135
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:29,917
The door's open. Somebody
must've kept it open, for us.

136
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:31,707
it seems that this house had
remained closed for many days.

137
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:35,084
it’s good that you told us, else
we wouldn't have known about it.

138
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:56,959
Who is it?

139
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,791
What happened?
- What happened? Tell me.

140
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:16,208
in that grave.. - Disha, what's
happening? - That curtain.. curtain!

141
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,999
You are frightened by a curtain?

142
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,541
Today, you all have to admit
that Kabir is the most cowardly..

143
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,041
..fellow in our whole group.

144
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:28,750
Listen to what l say!
Manav, when l go in the room..

145
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,917
.. that curtain trapped me.

146
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,165
Have you gone mad?

147
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,875
We need wood, don't
we need to light a fire?

148
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,125
He attacked as if he needed a
woman, and not wood, to burn.

149
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:53,375
lf one has such friends,
then why would one need enemies?

150
00:24:54,875 --> 00:25:01,250
I’ve got worn out,
trying to move this tire.

151
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:22,917
Look, there's a room over there.
- Where? - Over there.

152
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:27,041
it must be too dirty.
- Of course it must be dirty.

153
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:36,250
I’m fine, pal.

154
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,292
What happened?
- That.. - Who is it?

155
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:55,458
Who is there?
- Nobody, pal. it’s me.

156
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,082
He had come. He's the
one who pulled my chain.

157
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,792
There's no one there. Your chain
must've got stuck to this window.

158
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:24,542
He's somewhere here.
- Who?

159
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:30,000
Amar.
- Amar? - Amar, my love.

160
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:34,958
Meaning, you've a boyfriend?

161
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:36,624
When you can be my boyfriend..

162
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,583
..then why can't
she have a boyfriend?

163
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:44,875
But I’m not after your life.
- You're mistaken. He..

164
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:48,875
Psycho, isn't it? We can
understand that by his actions.

165
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:55,208
Amar can do anything.
He can come anywhere.

166
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:14,875
it seems Amar has returned.
- This crack wasn't there.

167
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,499
How did it appear suddenly?
- Amar did all this.

168
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,332
He's a ghost. Anything
can happen in his presence.

169
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,332
Disha can be attacked.
The painting can fall.

170
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,999
There can be a crack in the wall.

171
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,416
Now watch, blood
may drip from the crack.

172
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,999
What's this? Water is dripping.

173
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,332
it seems her boyfriend
isn't a powerful ghost.

174
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:41,083
Shut up! Enough. You've said
enough about my Amar. Enough!

175
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:45,250
You're seeing whatever
is happening here.

176
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,584
My Amar is dead. He's dead.

177
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:05,916
But even today, l feel
that he's here somewhere.

178
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,083
Near me.

179
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,457
All the four tires of the
car have been blasted, pal.

180
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,709
What are you saying? - I’m speaking
the truth, pal. Mother promise!

181
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:23,750
What?

182
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:28,292
Kabir, go and check.
- Akshay, why don't you believe me?

183
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,292
Your brains have gone cold.
Come, sit near the fire. C'mon.

184
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:42,292
He's right. All the four tires
have been blasted.

185
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:50,124
Was she scarier that you?
- Greetings, sir.

186
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:54,375
Wow! You repaired the punctures
of all the four tires, so soon.

187
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,166
There was a puncture in
just one tire. - One?

188
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,666
But all the 4 tires were punctured
last night. - Yes, pal.

189
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,708
No, just one tire was
punctured, sir. - How much? - Rs.50.

190
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:07,708
Here.
- Thank you, sir.

191
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,249
You said that all the four tires
were punctured last night.

192
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,666
l swear on my mother, pal.
l saw it with my own eyes.

193
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,666
Then who repaired the other three?
Amar Khanna?

194
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:18,666
Stop your nonsense.
- Yes, Amar Khanna must've come.

195
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:22,915
Amar Khanna? How do they
know Amar Khanna?

196
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:26,042
Ok, madam.
I’m just late by 5 minutes.

197
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,624
I’m coming! I’m coming!

198
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:36,291
O my Rajdhani Express!
I’m coming.

199
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:40,250
She blabbers so much, but l love..

200
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,584
You, here?

201
00:30:57,334 --> 00:30:58,832
l had come to give
this jacket of yours.

202
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,249
No! Please. Wear it.

203
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,249
it looks nice on you.

204
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,624
Were you going somewhere?
- College.

205
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:09,708
l, too, was going to college.

206
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,416
There's a limit to be late.

207
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,416
What does he think of himself?

208
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,665
Only girls make boys wait like this.

209
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:22,459
And I’m.. earlier, he used
to be late by 10 -15 minutes.

210
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:25,249
But today.. - 40.

211
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,125
He's late by 40 minutes.

212
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:54,542
The minutes will change to hours,
and the hours, to days.

213
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,249
What do you mean?

214
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,249
Meaning, you've
already got engaged.

215
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,665
Now, he'll take you for granted.

216
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,790
Shut up! What do you
know about my Manav?

217
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,291
l was just..
- What 'l was just'?

218
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:11,500
Go and take care of your Kabir,
else you won't even get engaged.

219
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,917
Look there.
Kabir is flirting with a girl.

220
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,458
These girls! They talk
to you on the first day..

221
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,916
..and hold your hands,
on the second.

222
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:26,416
Really? How do you know?

223
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:29,750
l, too, had done
the same thing.

224
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,291
Your silky hair are so beautiful.

225
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:38,375
They've been made exclusively
for a person like me.

226
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:52,292
Whenever l stay like this
with Manav, l like it very much.

227
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:59,209
But whenever Manav stay
with Disha, l don't like it at all.

228
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:04,958
Manav and Disha look so good,
together. isn’t it, Shanu?

229
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:11,375
Pal, l meant to say that
it's Manav's mistake.

230
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:15,042
Manav shouldn't have
done like this.

231
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:22,374
What's your jacket doing with her?
Why are you so late?

232
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,874
The weather wasn't good.

233
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,374
Not the weather but your
mind isn't good, anymore.

234
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:32,417
I’ve been waiting for you so long.
And you've come so late.

235
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,957
You're looking so beautiful.

236
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:43,250
And your silky hair
Look so beautiful. - That..

237
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:50,292
l got it straightened, today.
- Really? - That's the reason why.

238
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:56,792
l wasn't talking about you,
but about Disha.

239
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,457
What are you doing here?
- She's inside, l was..

240
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,541
Who? - Disha.

241
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:07,582
Your would-be sister-in-law.
Your mother.. - Not mother.. no!

242
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:11,625
No! - Mother.. - No! Later.

243
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,416
Why are you going inside?
- Book. Library.

244
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:17,958
l was going to submit it. - Really?

245
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,416
Are you going inside
to submit the book..

246
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:24,292
..or are you going in to meet her?

247
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:29,000
I’m going to meet her. So?

248
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,750
Look. - C'mon, show.

249
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,707
l.. me.. and..

250
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,000
Remain within your limits.

251
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:56,457
it’s a coincidence that l, too,
had come to take this book.

252
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,749
Where are you taking me?
- There.

253
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,457
These untold things..
- What?

254
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:04,042
it’s the title of this book.

255
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,124
it seems that you
like reading books.

256
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:10,875
Not so much, but l surely
want to read this book.

257
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,750
is that so?
What's there in this book?

258
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:22,875
About love. That only two
people feel. But do not say it.

259
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,375
More than listening,
it's about understanding.

260
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:34,917
More than saying,
it's about doing it.

261
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,375
And more than seeing,
it's about feeling it.

262
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:45,582
Did you see?

263
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,916
This is a library, Shanty.

264
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:49,499
I’ll take care of you!

265
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,042
Shanty, listen to me.

266
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:04,540
These untold things,
Disha's favorite book.

267
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:08,791
lf l come to know what this is,
then I’ve come to know about Disha.

268
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,707
Move! Come here.
Get lost, man!

269
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,540
l was talking to him.

270
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:16,540
My dear, reader's digest, you
like reading books, isn't it? - No!

271
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:20,084
What 'no'? You keep roaming
around with such fat books.

272
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:22,041
Do you practice playing
badminton with them?

273
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:24,540
l don't read books.
l practice balancing.

274
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,540
it’s a modeling exercise. Look.

275
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:29,708
Balancing? Do you
do balancing? - Yes.

276
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:32,540
Then do it.

277
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:35,583
Not this. Balance my life.

278
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,749
How? - Take this book.

279
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,958
Read it. - No! - There're a few
love talks in this. Listen to me.

280
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:44,582
Tell me about these love talks.

281
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:50,958
l want to impress Disha.
- No! Disha?

282
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:56,125
l don't want any relationships.

283
00:36:56,667 --> 00:37:00,792
When l don't have to fulfill any
relation, then why should l keep it?

284
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:12,874
You want to remove it?
- Yes. - C'mon.

285
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:16,167
When l don't have to fulfill any
relation, then why should l keep it?

286
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:23,209
You don't love me?

287
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:26,000
No. - No?

288
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:37,667
Not even now?

289
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,875
Did you read the book? - Why
are you after that book?

290
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,124
For the sake of my mother.
- What?

291
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,791
it’s my mother's wish that l
should get married soon.

292
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:51,708
Before my hair turn gray, my
mother wants to see my children.

293
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:53,290
You and your dreams!

294
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:55,958
Both are in your hands. Keep the
phone down and go read the book.

295
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:58,791
Ok. Call up after an hour.

296
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:05,041
After an hour? Ok.
I’ll call up after 5 minutes.

297
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:24,583
Read it?
- Yes, l read the book.

298
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,375
in it, it's written
that Amar Khanna..

299
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:40,125
Disconnected!?

300
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,917
Who are you?

301
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,542
I’m asking who you are.

302
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,500
We forgot to buy popcorn.
I’ll get it.

303
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:29,584
He must surely have
gone to meet Disha.

304
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,957
Yes. Had you let him
stand outside, then..

305
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:36,584
..he wouldn't have
given popcorn as an excuse.

306
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:45,999
Just a minute.

307
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,749
Has the movie started?

308
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,041
Shanty hasn't started
screaming yet. it’s a horror film.

309
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,041
Shanty, you? l was coming
in, with the popcorn.

310
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,499
You got scared, isn't it?
- Why should l be scared?

311
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,499
Only those who do
wrong things, get scared.

312
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,875
Like you. I’ve been watching
since the engagement day.

313
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,500
Since the time Manav saved your
life, you're constantly after him.

314
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:13,999
You've started thinking
that he's your own.

315
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,040
Shanty, what are you saying?
- I’m telling the right thing.

316
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,708
You were boasting so
much about your love.

317
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:23,124
And now, you're after my love!

318
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,292
l haven't seen such a shameless
girl like you, till date.

319
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:44,083
l apologize to you on
behalf of Shanty’s behalf.

320
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:54,958
Had l been in Shanty’s place, l too,
would've done the same thing.

321
00:44:56,833 --> 00:45:00,000
Everyone wants their love.
My love, too, was like that.

322
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:06,459
What had happened
between you and Amar Khanna?

323
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:11,082
l used to love
him more than my life.

324
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:16,958
Maybe that's the reason
why life fell short for us.

325
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:21,958
We had a lot of love
and emotions for each other.

326
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:29,375
But God gave less time to one,
and more to the other.

327
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:36,500
isn’t it strange? it’s so difficult
for me to spend the time.

328
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:42,207
And he didn't get
enough time to spend.

329
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:47,167
I’m angry with that God, who
separated me from my Amar.

330
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:53,667
I’m angry with that Amar,
who is doing all this.

331
00:45:55,375 --> 00:46:00,333
I’m angry with my
fate that gave me life.

332
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,709
And gave death to Amar.

333
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:16,709
lf you've got life, then
you've to live that life.

334
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:23,709
Live!

335
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:34,167
Meaning?
- Shanu's coming. - Shanu?

336
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:41,542
Chhotu! Bring a cup
of coffee for Shanu.

337
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,166
Shall l tell Shanu whatever
you were saying about her?

338
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,832
What? - What was he
saying about me?

339
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:53,042
Forget it, pal. You know that
he's mad. Blabbers continuously.

340
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:55,583
Yes.
- Will you have something?

341
00:46:55,584 --> 00:46:59,166
No. Tell me, what
was he saying about me?

342
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:02,416
Tell her. What all you
were saying behind her back?

343
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:05,708
You were saying that she's
a coward, Disha is so brave.

344
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:10,207
Leave it! isn’t he a coward?

345
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:14,500
But how dare he
compare you with Disha?

346
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,541
Do you know what
all he was saying?

347
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,750
He was saying
that Disha is so smart.

348
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:22,207
She's so adventurous.

349
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:25,207
No, l won't bet with you, this time.

350
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:28,584
What bet?
- This idiot has placed a bet..

351
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:32,207
..that Disha can go to a jungle,
even at midnight.

352
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:35,207
And that Shanu can't
even go to the library.

353
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,874
And even if she goes to the
library, what else will happen?

354
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:41,791
What will happen? - We'll say
that she's as brave as Disha.

355
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:44,249
What difference will it make?
She'll win the bet.

356
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,459
No! I’m going to the library,
that too, alone. Right now!

357
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:51,249
Understood?
- Shanu, your coffee.

358
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,249
Once, l screamed while
watching a horror movie..

359
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,249
..and they thought
of me as a coward.

360
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,624
Actually, l was scared
of the heroine's makeup.

361
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,791
And when everyone was scared,
then l was laughing.

362
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,249
They don't know that horror
films are made not to scare..

363
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,915
..but to make you laugh.

364
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:12,541
Actually, it's my mistake. l
always listen to these people.

365
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:18,625
This is the last time.
From here to the library..

366
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:25,167
I’m not going to get scared.
I’m not scared. I’m not a coward..

367
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,208
Lizard!

368
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,542
Remove it!

369
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:45,334
Move! Get lost!

370
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:52,208
I’m going to the library.

371
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:56,375
They think of me as a coward.

372
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:22,333
Yes, l remember that book,
'A few untold things'.

373
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,333
l myself locked up that
book in the store room.

374
00:49:25,334 --> 00:49:27,333
A long time back. That too,
when you asked me to do so.

375
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:30,333
lf you had locked it up, then
how did it reach the library?

376
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:33,875
l don't know anything.
l, myself, am shocked.

377
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:37,375
it’s possible that our professor
or our student must've..

378
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,458
Principal! What are you saying?

379
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:42,333
lf l had asked you
to lock up that book..

380
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:46,375
..then there was definitely
a reason behind that.

381
00:49:53,334 --> 00:49:56,708
50000 copies of
that book were published.

382
00:49:56,708 --> 00:50:00,000
it was sent to 5 different cities.
Not even a single book reached.

383
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,624
2 of the trucks fell into a pit.

384
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,790
The ship sank along
with the whole consignment.

385
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:10,374
And one of the trucks
caught fire by itself.

386
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,417
People say that someone
must've set fire to it.

387
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:23,540
The copy that l had
asked you to lock up..

388
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:27,250
..that's the last copy of that book.

389
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:35,625
The last 4 pages of
the book are such that..

390
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,792
..wherever it goes..

391
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:47,125
l told you, l want the book back.

392
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:34,000
l know, you're trying to scare me.

393
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:48,542
Leave my hand!

394
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:54,583
Enough of jokes! You're
always trying to scare me!

395
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,124
Why are you so scared?

396
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,540
l was shit scared!

397
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:04,416
I’ll take care of that Nupur.
What does she think of herself?

398
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:09,750
Nupur is in Delhi.
- She's in Delhi?

399
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:12,041
Then is her ghost
sitting in the storeroom?

400
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:16,458
Come, I’ll show you. - Kabir,
now she's trying to scare us.

401
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:22,458
Maybe she doesn't know that
the only one who can scare..

402
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:26,125
..Akshay, is Talli.
- Talli? - He's got such a face!

403
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,458
He was born dead. A glimpse of his..

404
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,458
..face is scarier
than a 3 hour horror film.

405
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:41,458
Shanty, had you seen
Talli's face in this darkness..

406
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:45,625
..then you would've
forgotten Manav's face.

407
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:57,041
Thank you, sir.

408
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,000
Nupur!

409
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,415
Kabir, Talli speaking.

410
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:21,290
Talli, where are you.
- At Nupur's house.

411
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,500
But she's in Delhi. - I’m sure
that there's something fishy here.

412
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,290
You come here, immediately.

413
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:33,667
I’m coming, wait there.

414
00:54:45,084 --> 00:54:51,375
Friend, this girl..

415
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,875
The book is here.

416
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,666
A few untold things..'

417
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:25,875
This book. Don't know whether this
book is cursed or not..

418
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:29,208
..but, before something
goes wrong, l should keep this..

419
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:35,833
..book in the library.

420
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:40,084
Talli, are you alright?

421
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:43,707
Kabir.. there..
- There, what?

422
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:47,084
Why are you so scared?
- C'mon, let's get out of here.

423
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:53,250
Will you tell me something?
- I’ll tell you later. Let's go!

424
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:57,250
Will you..
- C'mon. let's go

425
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:13,292
What's it, Talli? Why
aren't you saying anything?

426
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:21,125
Talli, what happened?
- Go!

427
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:48,667
My bag! My bag..

428
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,333
it’s in Kabir's car!

429
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,749
Kabir, listen.
- Yes, tell me, Talli.

430
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:10,708
That book.. my bag
is in your car, pal.

431
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:19,208
Yes, it's here. - Listen,
there's a book in that bag.

432
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:22,791
I’ve to keep that book back
in the college, today. That's it.

433
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:26,042
Yes. That's alright.
What's the problem in that?

434
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:28,624
We'll be meeting in
college for Manav's performance.

435
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,791
We can keep it then.
- Ok. Then.

436
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:35,041
What's the matter?
Why are you so scared?

437
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:39,083
Nothing. Actually.. that book..

438
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:45,833
Don't read that book, Kabir.

439
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:49,041
Kabir, are you listening?
Whatever is in that book..

440
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:52,375
I’ll explain it to you, later.

441
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:57,000
I’ll meet you in college, ok?
- Ok.

442
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:04,041
The book has to be kept in the
college. it shouldn't be read, too.

443
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:05,332
What's all this?

444
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:08,833
l think Talli is trying
to hide something.

445
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:11,917
Let's see what's in this book.

446
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:15,709
A few untold things!?'

447
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:37,333
Talli, I’ve read the book. - l had
told you not to read the book.

448
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:40,749
Why did you read it?
- Listen to me, pal.

449
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:46,333
Don't say anything. Listen to me.
Meet me in the college, right now.

450
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:50,500
I’m coming there.
- Ok.

451
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:11,041
Keys.. purse.

452
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,375
Talli!

453
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,041
Where is Talli?

454
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,375
Kabir. - Where are you, pal? - On
the first floor. Waiting for you.

455
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,375
Come soon.
- Ok, I’m coming.

456
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,708
C'mon. - Where?
- The show's there, pal.

457
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,040
We can go to the show later,
we've to go the library, first.

458
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:11,250
I’ve to keep this book.

459
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:19,040
Pal, don't know where this Kabir is.

460
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:25,416
You search for him there.
I’ll look for him, here.

461
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:41,584
Kabir, where are you?
- I’m here, outside the library.

462
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,457
But the library is closed,
what're you doing there? - Yes.

463
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:47,958
Where are you? - l told you that
I’m waiting for you in the storeroom.

464
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:52,459
Come fast, pal.
- Ok. I’m coming.

465
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:03,292
Talli!

466
01:04:00,459 --> 01:04:05,584
lf Talli's phone is here,
then who's calling me?

467
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:22,625
Pal, l called him at college but..

468
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:26,000
My phone, my phone is with him.

469
01:04:26,334 --> 01:04:29,791
You remembered very soon.

470
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,291
Look there.

471
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:57,707
Finally you found your book.
- Yes, thank God!

472
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,374
But where did you go to
leaving this book here.

473
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,374
Nupur must have come. He
must have gone to receive her.

474
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,583
We'll meet both of them at
the show. - That is all fine, but..

475
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:06,915
..leaving it here
like this, it's wrong, pal.

476
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,665
The library must have been closed.
That's why he left it here.

477
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:11,875
You got your book. Now
let's get out of here. C'mon.

478
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:15,208
But..
- C'mon.

479
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:24,749
I’m so excited that you
are going to perform today.

480
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,334
I’m sure that your today's performance
will be your best performance ever.

481
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:34,374
What happened? Are you
thinking of something else?

482
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:37,749
l was just thinking that
has someone informed Disha.

483
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:41,042
Why should someone inform her?
Can't she come on her own?

484
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:46,208
What happened to your mood?

485
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,459
You have been thinking only of her
from the day she came to the college.

486
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:55,749
You are always talking about her.

487
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,541
l, now, realize it that whatever
I’m thinking about you is true.

488
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:05,416
it’s not like that. She
is lonely in the college.

489
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:10,416
Protective for her. And for me.

490
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,749
Today you have to take a decision.

491
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:16,375
After all what do you want?

492
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:24,292
Do you love her? Tell me.
I’ll just get out of the way then.

493
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:28,708
I’ll break up this engagement.

494
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:36,750
it is true that she has
some strange attraction.

495
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:40,917
This forces me to be
with her, support her.

496
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,375
But that doesn't
mean that l love her.

497
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:48,917
To be with her.

498
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:54,917
Support her, what does
she have, a strange attraction.

499
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,458
Shanty left so soon.
You must have fought again.

500
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:10,459
Don't worry, pal,
she'll be back soon.

501
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,458
What happened? What are
all of you worried about?

502
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:16,166
Nothing, pal, normal stuff.
They had a fight again.

503
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:19,500
Yes. We will narrate this long
tale to you, some other time.

504
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,832
Now his performance is there.
C'mon Manav. Let's go.

505
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:26,292
l have to go to Disha's house.
What does she think of herself?

506
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,166
I’m not going to spare her, today.

507
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:32,708
A decision will be made, today.

508
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:41,792
Hello, is any body there?

509
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:49,209
Whom do you want to meet?
- Disha. Where is she?

510
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:52,666
Disha?
- Yes, I’m searching for her.

511
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,666
You know her?
- Yes, l know her very well.

512
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:00,291
By the way, who are you?

513
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:03,875
I’m Disha's mother.

514
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,250
Please call Disha.
l want to meet her, right now.

515
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:13,249
But how can you meet her?

516
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,125
it’s very necessary that l meet her.
Today we have to decide.

517
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,916
I’ve tolerated too much.
l can't tolerate any more.

518
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:24,291
Disha had tolerated too much.
- Where is Disha?

519
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:28,375
it’s been 22 years
since Disha died.

520
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:28,250
'When l fell in
love l didn't think'..

521
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:32,000
.. l couldn't understand
or analyze anything.'

522
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:39,209
'Now that I’ve given my heart then
there is no one else who l can see.'

523
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:46,209
'No matter whoever says anything.'

524
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,374
'No matter whoever says anything,
l just want to say this..'

525
01:10:54,375 --> 01:11:00,750
'l will always be with you.'

526
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,209
Shanty, there's a call from Nupur
for you at the college phone booth.

527
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:34,500
'There is no distance between
us when my heart is close to me.'

528
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:41,875
'You are my life and
the feeling of existence.'

529
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:04,833
'l can't concentrate on
anything else without you, now.'

530
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:11,792
'Without you l won't
take a single breath, now.'

531
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:16,583
'l will always be with you.'

532
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:24,250
'When l fell in
love l didn't think'..

533
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:28,124
.. l couldn't understand
or analyze anything.'

534
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:31,792
'Now that I’ve given my heart then
there is no one else whom l can see.'

535
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:41,333
'No matter whoever says anything.'

536
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:49,291
'No matter whoever says anything,
l just want to say this..'

537
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:56,584
'l will always be with you.'

538
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:19,291
Nupur, enough of the jokes.

539
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:24,541
Now, listen carefully
what l have to say.

540
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:30,500
Disha is already dead.

541
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,375
Calm down, my child, clam down.

542
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:06,875
No child, no. Calm down.

543
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:27,915
Doctor, what has happened to her?

544
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:32,666
She is in deep shock due
to some unknown incident.

545
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:34,416
She won't be able
to speak for a while.

546
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:37,040
But that doesn't mean that she
won't be able to speak forever.

547
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:40,040
She would be fine
after resting for a while.

548
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:43,040
The medicines that l have
given her should be given on time.

549
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:46,542
Remember, she needs rest.

550
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:01,542
Okay, I’ll go now.

551
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:06,708
Thank you, ma'am,
that you contacted me.

552
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:10,375
But how did you get my number?
- l got her from her mobile.

553
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:14,292
My name is Sunita, Sunita Menon.

554
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:20,542
Sunita Menon! Akshay,
haven't you heard about her?

555
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,207
She is a very famous astrologer.

556
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:26,417
They are know as
Aura readers in English.

557
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:30,083
Some people also call
them messengers of God.

558
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:31,999
And some people call
them black magicians.

559
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,083
I’ve even heard that they have the
power to control ghosts and spirits.

560
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:39,124
That means your life is in danger.

561
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:41,791
You also come in the
categories of ghosts and spirits.

562
01:17:41,792 --> 01:17:44,332
Talli, think about this, if
there would not have been any..

563
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:48,082
..ghosts and spirits
then where would she be.

564
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:51,457
Her company runs only
because of ghosts and spirits.

565
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,584
What a profession it is
and what a name she has got.

566
01:17:56,417 --> 01:18:02,750
Whatever may be the name,
my work is to help people.

567
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:09,166
And this is not
my work but my hobby.

568
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:12,124
lf you wish, then you
can stay in my guest room.

569
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:15,040
it won't be a guest
room but a ghost room.

570
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:19,000
Come, come.

571
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:20,667
Manav, Disha!

572
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:27,083
Shanty, believe me there is
nothing between Disha and me.

573
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:34,000
Manav, Disha! She...

574
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:39,333
Control yourself Shanty, there is
nothing like this, l am with you.

575
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:51,167
Sunlight, darkness!

576
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:59,791
Shanty, try to understand what l am
Saying. All this is your imagination.

577
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:03,250
There's no such thing. - it’s
not an imagination. it’s a fact.

578
01:20:03,584 --> 01:20:06,207
Ms. Sunita, look outside
there's darkness and light..

579
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:10,542
Whatever she can
see l can also see.

580
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:14,791
There is an aura of
some spirit around you.

581
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,624
No way. l don't
believe in such things.

582
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:22,791
Your belief or disbelief
won't change the truth.

583
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:26,832
That, what l can't see..
- it’s not necessary..

584
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:30,083
..that what you
can see is the truth.

585
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:36,417
Shanty’s fear is for real.
And this is the proof to it.

586
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:49,915
You'll get all the
answers to your questions.

587
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:53,750
But there is only
one solution for that.

588
01:20:54,334 --> 01:20:58,334
l have to call upon
that spirit with my powers.

589
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:22,999
What is she doing?
- She is celebrating Diwali.

590
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,333
When else would we
light so many candles?

591
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:28,666
All this is for calling the spirit.
- Oh, yes.

592
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:30,541
The spirit would come,
we'll have candle light dinner..

593
01:21:30,542 --> 01:21:33,708
..with them and..
- Don't be afraid.

594
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,791
Those who are unaware of
the powers of the nature..

595
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:40,584
..I’m not disheartened
by their mockery.

596
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:43,583
Maybe you don't know this
but the night of Diwali..

597
01:21:43,584 --> 01:21:48,374
..is also the night of
Amavasya (moonless/new moon).

598
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:52,334
To remove the darkness
we light up the candles.

599
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:58,542
C'mon. All of you
come within the circle.

600
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:06,500
To call upon the
spirit all of you should..

601
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:11,625
..lay your hands on this board.

602
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:16,833
After that l would
invoke the spirits.

603
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:26,250
During that no one should
remove their hands from this board.

604
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:32,624
After the chant is
over the spirit would..

605
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:36,042
..arrive here by itself.

606
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:44,292
Until the séance is going on no
one will get out from the circle.

607
01:22:48,459 --> 01:22:52,209
lf you go out than
your life maybe endangered.

608
01:22:56,083 --> 01:23:00,708
it means that we are in this
circle, here the spirit won't come.

609
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:06,500
The spirit can come any where but
it cannot harm anyone in this circle.

610
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,749
You call Amar Khanna's spirit.

611
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:14,083
He is the source
of all the troubles.

612
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:41,417
There is no such spirit.
lf it was there than..

613
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:44,666
..it would arrive here by itself.

614
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:48,499
I’m telling you, call
upon the spirit of Disha.

615
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,917
Shanu, what are you saying? How can
she come here? She is still alive.

616
01:23:52,209 --> 01:23:53,707
She is dead. Please Ms. Sunita..

617
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:57,458
..call the spirit
of Disha. She is dead.

618
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,958
We will find it out right now.

619
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:53,125
Even Disha's spirit didn't arrive.

620
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,208
it would come only
if it was there. C'mon.

621
01:26:59,209 --> 01:27:05,417
Why did you call upon me?

622
01:27:12,792 --> 01:27:17,124
You are a twenty years old spirit.
What do you want from these kids?

623
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:21,375
Death! - l told you that
Disha is dead. She killed Kabir too.

624
01:27:22,042 --> 01:27:25,249
You.. you killed Kabir?

625
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:30,000
Yes, l killed Kabir and Nupur too.

626
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:34,500
Whoever tries to come in
my way, I’ll kill everyone.

627
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:40,167
You can't harm anyone until I’m
here. You are under my control.

628
01:27:41,042 --> 01:27:46,500
No one can stop me. l can
come and go as l please.

629
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:50,500
l won't let you go. l won't!

630
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:15,208
Stop, no one should
step out of the circle.

631
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:51,708
'Hello daddy, yes, l read the book.
it’s written that Amar Khanna..'

632
01:29:00,792 --> 01:29:02,791
'Nupur is in Delhi,
so is there a..

633
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:06,250
..ghost of hers waiting
in the store room?'

634
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:14,457
'in that room, the curtains'..

635
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:15,791
'My Amar is dead.'

636
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:21,750
'l killed Kabir and Nupur too.'

637
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,875
This is our misfortune that
the séance couldn't be completed.

638
01:29:33,084 --> 01:29:36,875
Otherwise we would have to
come know what Disha wanted.

639
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,542
And why is she after
the lives of all of you.

640
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:44,084
lf you hadn't saved Akshay, today..

641
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:46,415
..then Disha would have killed him.

642
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:49,875
What is the guarantee that
Disha won't try to kill us again?

643
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:51,999
Today, Disha has shown us, that..

644
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,542
..she can do anything anywhere.

645
01:29:57,250 --> 01:30:00,416
This is the worry
that is troubling me too..

646
01:30:00,416 --> 01:30:04,290
..that Disha's spirit
has become very powerful.

647
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:08,624
The power of her spirit
can't be decreased or vanquished.

648
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:12,125
We should at least come
to know, what she wants.

649
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:19,290
Why has she killed Nupur and Kabir?

650
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:22,583
C'mon. C'mon.

651
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:17,374
Akshay, Akshay. - Talli?
- I’ve read the book.

652
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:20,500
What is the matter, Talli?
Talli, tell me what happened.

653
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:24,374
There is Disha's
story in this. - What?

654
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:29,000
Yes. l had suspected that
Disha and this book are connected.

655
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:31,541
My suspicions have
come true, Akshay.

656
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:34,541
Nupur and Kabir had read this book.

657
01:31:34,542 --> 01:31:36,541
Therefore Disha
killed the two, my friend.

658
01:31:36,542 --> 01:31:38,541
But, why would Disha kill
anyone for reading the book?

659
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:44,000
Friend, because she didn't want
anyone to know that she's dead.

660
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:49,708
Nupur and Kabir had come to
know of her reality, friend.

661
01:31:49,709 --> 01:31:52,374
But why is she doing like this?

662
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:58,333
To find out.. to find this out.
I’ll have to go to Krishna Cottage.

663
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:01,207
Krishna Cottage?
- Yes, Krishna Cottage.

664
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,457
That same bungalow,
that same haunted house..

665
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:07,166
..in which we had stayed
the night of Manav's engagement.

666
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:12,000
Disha had met us for
the first time on that day.

667
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:18,165
Now, to know what is
the reason for Disha..

668
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,416
..to enter into our lives,
I’ll have to go to Krishna Cottage.

669
01:32:21,417 --> 01:32:24,416
Have you gone crazy?
Have you gone mad?

670
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:26,749
l will not let you go there.

671
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,165
l will have to go,
Akshay. Because of me..

672
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:30,749
..two of our
friends have been killed.

673
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:33,416
But Talli, where did you know this?
What's your fault in this?

674
01:32:33,417 --> 01:32:37,375
it is my fault, friend!
- No. You will not go.

675
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:42,041
Akshay, the story of this
book had started with me.

676
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:46,041
And l shall be the
one to finish it too.

677
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:32,167
Talli! - Akshay, Akshay! - Talli.
Talli, are you all right?

678
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:34,291
Akshay, thank God
that you have come, friend.

679
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:37,541
Didn't l tell you that we'd get
some clue in this Krishna Cottage?

680
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:40,833
Look at this.

681
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,791
Did you understand? Did
you understand, friend?

682
01:34:43,792 --> 01:34:47,375
This is the reason
that Disha is after us.

683
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:50,541
l don't understand
what we should do.

684
01:34:50,542 --> 01:34:51,791
Talli. - Yes? - You don't worry.

685
01:34:51,792 --> 01:34:53,791
We'll take this and show
it to Mrs. Sunita.

686
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:55,874
But what is the use in
showing it to Mrs. Sunita.

687
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,332
Talli, you don't worry. Don't
worry. I’m with you.- Akshay..

688
01:34:57,333 --> 01:34:59,332
..we ourselves will have to do
something. Listen to me, friend.

689
01:34:59,333 --> 01:35:02,875
Talli, listen to me!

690
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:54,250
Talli!

691
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,250
Talli!

692
01:35:58,791 --> 01:36:02,957
l tried to explain to him! But he..!

693
01:36:02,958 --> 01:36:05,458
He knew that there was
a danger to his life here.

694
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:08,374
Even then, he came here.
He was saying..

695
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:10,666
..that twenty two years ago,
Disha used to stay here.

696
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:12,999
Her reality would
be unearthed from here.

697
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,666
Has her reality been found out now?

698
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:16,374
How did Talli come
to know that Disha..

699
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:18,499
..stayed here twenty-two years ago?

700
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:21,666
From the book. A few untold things.'

701
01:36:21,667 --> 01:36:23,999
Nor would he have read that
book and neither would have..

702
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,958
A few.. untold.. things?'

703
01:36:29,667 --> 01:36:32,958
This is Professor Das's story.

704
01:36:33,667 --> 01:36:37,292
We'll have to go to
Professor Das's house.

705
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:55,333
Disha.

706
01:36:55,708 --> 01:37:00,333
Your innocent face, is as
fresh in my mind and heart..

707
01:37:00,417 --> 01:37:05,333
..as every bad memory that
is connected with your life.

708
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:12,334
l had thought that this
incident would be the last, but no.

709
01:38:29,542 --> 01:38:33,083
Where is this Lover's Point?

710
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:41,999
What an exquisite thing, friend!

711
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:48,083
it’s going on together,
dance as well as romance.

712
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:54,374
The boy is lucky. He is going
on the right path, the right path.

713
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:55,874
What did you say?

714
01:42:55,875 --> 01:43:00,291
What will you do?
What will you do?

715
01:43:00,292 --> 01:43:04,375
I’ll kill you, understood?
- Have you gone crazy?

716
01:43:19,042 --> 01:43:22,667
Amar, Amar, listen to me.

717
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:26,083
What is the matter?

718
01:43:26,084 --> 01:43:28,249
l want to speak to you
about something important.

719
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:31,708
Even l have some important work.
I’ve to return the book.

720
01:43:33,084 --> 01:43:34,832
I’ve to wait again. l think l will
have to wait throughout my life..

721
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:37,249
..to tell you the
matters of my heart.

722
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,708
Hi Disha!

723
01:43:39,084 --> 01:43:40,708
Hi Sid.

724
01:43:40,833 --> 01:43:43,415
Today's rose day,
will you become my partner?

725
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:46,708
Sid, we are just friends,
and I’ve got my partner.

726
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:20,750
'Lonely, lonely, moments.'

727
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:26,792
'My roads are so lonely.'

728
01:44:28,333 --> 01:44:33,084
'Please come and hold me.'

729
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,125
'The road is
waiting for you to come.'

730
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:45,125
'Turn back and see now.'

731
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:51,792
'This kind of union
may occur again or not.'

732
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:57,792
'You are my everything.'

733
01:45:02,542 --> 01:45:07,125
'l love immensely, please come.'

734
01:45:08,542 --> 01:45:12,833
'l am waiting for you, please come.'

735
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:27,875
'lf we ever get separated
on the journey'..

736
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,582
'..l will stay
close to you forever.'

737
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:35,875
'l will walk listening to the sound
of your footsteps and find you.'

738
01:46:43,042 --> 01:46:47,917
'The innocent aromas of
love have spread in the air.'

739
01:46:48,625 --> 01:46:53,917
'Please touch me today and
feel my untouched memories.'

740
01:46:55,458 --> 01:47:00,250
'A togetherness like this
may never happen.'

741
01:47:08,625 --> 01:47:12,583
What is this? - it is
the symbol of our love.

742
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:15,499
You are misunderstanding
this relationship.

743
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,959
Our relationship has
become something else, Amar.

744
01:47:19,667 --> 01:47:22,041
See, Disha. More than friendship..

745
01:47:22,042 --> 01:47:25,959
..and lesser than love,
there is another relation too.

746
01:47:26,333 --> 01:47:29,625
And that is our relation.

747
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:57,374
Disha, you?

748
01:47:57,375 --> 01:48:00,541
How did all this happen? -
Sir, this is Vishal. - Did you see?

749
01:48:00,542 --> 01:48:02,416
Vishal and his
friends have been murdered.

750
01:48:02,417 --> 01:48:05,667
These three used to
stay in our Cottage.

751
01:48:06,208 --> 01:48:08,708
Where are you going?
- Down.

752
01:48:08,709 --> 01:48:11,708
Are you crazy? lf you go down
the police will not spare you.

753
01:48:11,709 --> 01:48:14,207
They won't spare me? Why?

754
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,416
Because the police suspect
that you've murdered them.

755
01:48:16,417 --> 01:48:18,374
Murder? No.

756
01:48:18,375 --> 01:48:20,416
We'll have to
escape from here, Amar.

757
01:48:20,417 --> 01:48:22,708
We'll have to escape from here?
I’ve murdered them?

758
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:24,124
You fought with them.
You had threatened them..

759
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:26,708
..that you would kill them!
Everybody had heard it!

760
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:29,541
Yes. But l had said
all that in a fit of rage.

761
01:48:29,542 --> 01:48:33,375
The police will not believe
what you say, Amar. At any time..

762
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:42,542
You don't worry, Amar.

763
01:48:42,542 --> 01:48:48,000
We'll go away somewhere far.
l will never leave your side, Amar.

764
01:48:50,542 --> 01:48:52,124
l want to go back.
See, I’m telling you.

765
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:54,124
l..- I’m telling you
let's go back. - l won't let you..

766
01:48:54,125 --> 01:48:57,709
See stop the car. I’m telling you..
- No Amar!

767
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:11,041
This means, you killed
Vishal and his friends.

768
01:49:11,166 --> 01:49:15,041
No Amar, actually! - Tell me,
why did you kill them?

769
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:19,749
You killed them so
that you could be with me?

770
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:23,041
You knew that they
would suspect me.

771
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:27,375
And when l would have no
other way out.. then.. you..

772
01:49:27,792 --> 01:49:31,750
..l would have to be with you.
I’d have to go with you.

773
01:49:32,625 --> 01:49:34,457
l love you.

774
01:49:34,458 --> 01:49:38,584
Never. You will never be able
to achieve me. You stop the car.

775
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:44,083
Stop the car. Stop the car.
I’m telling you, stop the car.

776
01:49:44,208 --> 01:49:48,083
I’m telling you, stop
the car. Stop the car.

777
01:50:09,667 --> 01:50:13,750
Amar, you can't leave me and go!

778
01:50:17,667 --> 01:50:21,125
Disha, come up! Come up!
Come up! - No!

779
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:25,125
Disha! Come up!
Disha, come up!

780
01:50:47,709 --> 01:50:49,166
Kabir!

781
01:50:52,542 --> 01:50:55,834
There was an ice
wall there. Friend!

782
01:51:19,709 --> 01:51:23,708
l still can't understand one thing.

783
01:51:23,709 --> 01:51:26,291
lf Disha wanted
to be with me, then..

784
01:51:26,292 --> 01:51:29,875
..why did she
wait for so many years?

785
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:36,291
According to me..

786
01:51:36,292 --> 01:51:40,500
At which age she had lost
Amar in her previous birth..

787
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:45,542
..now, she wishes to be
with Manav at the same age.

788
01:51:47,417 --> 01:51:51,915
She put the book from the
storeroom to the library.

789
01:51:51,916 --> 01:51:56,208
But, Kabir and
Nupur read it, before you.

790
01:51:58,417 --> 01:52:01,915
And those poor people had
to die before their time.

791
01:52:01,916 --> 01:52:04,332
Because, she did not
want that anyone else..

792
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:07,332
..should find out the
relation between you both.

793
01:52:07,333 --> 01:52:09,332
Not only that..

794
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:13,542
..she preserved your
body in an ice mountain.

795
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:19,374
And she has preserved
it for so many years.

796
01:52:19,375 --> 01:52:23,250
So that, when you see it,
you remember everything.

797
01:52:23,625 --> 01:52:26,458
Why did she do all
this to be with me?

798
01:52:26,459 --> 01:52:29,916
Why didn't she kill me before?

799
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:34,957
Because killing is not
Disha's final objective.

800
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:39,250
lf you kill yourself and
surrender yourself to Disha..

801
01:52:39,375 --> 01:52:43,458
..then your death
doesn't have any importance.

802
01:52:43,459 --> 01:52:45,957
This is nature's rule.
- What do you mean?

803
01:52:45,958 --> 01:52:47,374
Manav will have to go with Disha..

804
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:49,374
..and give up his
life at the same place..

805
01:52:49,375 --> 01:52:53,666
..where Amar had died
in his previous birth.

806
01:52:53,667 --> 01:52:57,292
After his death, he will have
to surrender himself to Disha.

807
01:52:57,375 --> 01:52:59,374
Can't we stop her in some way?

808
01:52:59,375 --> 01:53:02,374
We can stop her. But only when..

809
01:53:02,375 --> 01:53:06,292
..the horoscope of Manav
and you are united.

810
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,999
The Disha won't be
able to do anything.

811
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,499
What do you mean to say?

812
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:16,292
Disha wishes to fulfill the actions
of her previous birth in this birth.

813
01:53:16,667 --> 01:53:19,416
lf you both marry,
then according to your..

814
01:53:19,417 --> 01:53:24,292
..horoscope and actions, you
will belong to Shanty only.

815
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:30,041
No. l can't put
Shanty’s life in danger.

816
01:53:30,042 --> 01:53:32,874
Why only Shanty?

817
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:36,333
All of us have our
lives in grave danger.

818
01:53:36,875 --> 01:53:41,041
Without achieving you,
she will not find any peace.

819
01:53:41,042 --> 01:53:44,708
There can be a danger
in this solution.

820
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:48,666
But there is no
other solution to save us.

821
01:53:51,708 --> 01:53:56,334
Manav. Till date fate has tried us.

822
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:02,334
Today, for the
first and the last time..

823
01:54:02,459 --> 01:54:07,375
..we shall test fate
for the sake of our love.

824
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:13,375
lf there is a life long
relation between our lives then..

825
01:54:13,459 --> 01:54:19,375
..whether the lifespan is
less or more, how does it matter?

826
01:54:22,875 --> 01:54:25,458
Then, even you understand something.

827
01:54:25,459 --> 01:54:28,666
lf something happens to you,
then l will always help you.

828
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:31,749
Whether life..

829
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:35,042
..or death.

830
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:43,375
'Om! in the name of the Fire God!'

831
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:47,375
'Om! in the name of the Earth God!'

832
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:17,541
Till the time their
marriage rituals are done..

833
01:55:17,542 --> 01:55:23,917
..Manav and Shanty should
not come out of this circle.

834
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:32,500
Wait! Stop this marriage!
Stop this marriage!

835
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:38,041
Manav, what is she saying?
Our marriage?

836
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:41,041
l think that Disha is again..

837
01:56:41,042 --> 01:56:43,041
She won't let us
get married. l will..

838
01:56:43,042 --> 01:56:45,208
No! Shanty!

839
01:56:45,209 --> 01:56:48,541
What do you want after all? I’ll
marry Manav under any circumstances.

840
01:56:48,625 --> 01:56:52,209
Manav, Manav wait, Manav.
- Did you hear that? - Wait!

841
01:58:02,292 --> 01:58:08,917
She's gone, Manav.
Manav, it's hurting me a lot.

842
01:58:16,292 --> 01:58:22,333
it’s hurting me a lot.

843
01:58:22,334 --> 01:58:26,917
Manav, look at this.
See what she has done to me.

844
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,999
it’s hurting me a lot!
- Wait. Manav!

845
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,625
No, Shanty, no! Shanty, no!

846
01:58:52,833 --> 01:58:56,292
May God protect them!

847
01:59:00,375 --> 01:59:06,834
What did l do?

848
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:17,666
l will kill her. l will kill her.
You want to marry her don't you?

849
01:59:18,375 --> 01:59:24,833
l will kill her.

850
01:59:27,209 --> 01:59:29,374
l will kill her!

851
01:59:29,375 --> 01:59:32,708
You want that l should go
with you, don't you? - Manav!

852
01:59:33,042 --> 01:59:38,041
it’s all right, then.
l will go with you.

853
01:59:38,042 --> 01:59:42,667
But you leave my Shanty.
Please, spare my Shanty.

854
01:59:49,209 --> 01:59:52,208
l can't live without you.

855
01:59:52,209 --> 01:59:56,667
You've given your test.
For your love.

856
01:59:59,042 --> 02:00:02,500
Now, it's my turn. l will
have to go. l will have to go.

857
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:13,708
Disha! Disha!

858
02:00:23,833 --> 02:00:28,209
Where are you? Here.
l have come. l have arrived.

859
02:00:33,416 --> 02:00:36,415
l have been waiting for
this moment since many years.

860
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:38,457
Today, my wait has come to an end.

861
02:00:38,458 --> 02:00:41,124
Will you answer a question of mine?

862
02:00:41,125 --> 02:00:43,958
What do you want?

863
02:00:43,959 --> 02:00:49,750
My body, my soul, my heart, what?

864
02:00:51,125 --> 02:00:55,750
Everything. l want everything.

865
02:00:56,291 --> 02:01:01,750
My body, my soul.
l will give you everything.

866
02:01:02,959 --> 02:01:07,750
But l will stay related to the one,
to whom l have given my heart.

867
02:01:07,875 --> 02:01:12,499
l have loved her. Shanty.

868
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:15,792
And today, l have to
lose myself just for her.

869
02:01:16,167 --> 02:01:20,792
Lose? Even l had lost you once,
by giving up my life.

870
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:25,166
l can't lose you again now.

871
02:01:25,167 --> 02:01:28,499
l have spent such a long
time between life and death.

872
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:31,499
Just for you.

873
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:36,125
Without you, l couldn't live,
and nor could l die.

874
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:41,792
The one whom you've been
waiting for since long if he..

875
02:01:41,917 --> 02:01:47,833
..comes to you, except achieving
him, nothing else matters.

876
02:01:49,542 --> 02:01:52,249
But today..
today l will get everything..

877
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:54,541
..that l want.

878
02:01:54,542 --> 02:01:58,917
Except my love.
l can't give you my life.

879
02:02:01,542 --> 02:02:02,833
My death.

880
02:02:05,208 --> 02:02:09,000
But my death is for you.

881
02:02:09,542 --> 02:02:14,541
Only my death!

882
02:02:14,542 --> 02:02:20,875
See, Amar. The wave of
the wind is with me today.

883
02:02:23,042 --> 02:02:29,875
Even this breeze is with me.
These valleys are with me too.

884
02:02:31,542 --> 02:02:38,375
Nature wishes this too.
That you should become mine.

885
02:02:38,542 --> 02:02:41,875
You haven't understood yet,
what love really is!

886
02:02:42,542 --> 02:02:45,207
What is the meaning of
achieving after losing.

887
02:02:45,208 --> 02:02:46,958
Today nature isn't supporting you..

888
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:51,415
..but it is supporting
Shanty and me.

889
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:53,999
Which lover has such
a death in his fate..

890
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,415
..that he dies for
the one that he loves.

891
02:02:58,416 --> 02:03:02,249
Disha, your love
could never be immortal.

892
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:08,875
But today my love.. my love
will become immortal forever.

893
02:03:59,042 --> 02:04:03,959
See, Disha, today
the wave of the winds..

894
02:04:04,042 --> 02:04:07,959
..these valleys,
this breeze is with me.

895
02:04:10,667 --> 02:04:14,959
Today, my love will become
immortal forever and ever.

896
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:22,625
You have lost.

897
02:05:11,709 --> 02:05:14,374
How are you feeling now, son?

898
02:05:14,375 --> 02:05:16,207
How did l come here?

899
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:19,667
Some girl left you
here and went away, son.

900
02:05:20,709 --> 02:05:23,374
She didn't give her
name or address.

901
02:05:23,375 --> 02:05:29,000
l don't know who she was.
But she gave this for you.

902
02:05:32,417 --> 02:05:36,041
l will bring some tea for you, okay?

903
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:55,041
Manav, you must be thinking
as to how you got your life back.

904
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:58,582
Don't think that
your life is my defeat.

905
02:05:58,583 --> 02:06:02,165
l haven't lost and nor will l lose.

906
02:06:02,166 --> 02:06:04,749
How could l let
your love be immortal?

907
02:06:04,750 --> 02:06:07,165
When my love is immortal.

908
02:06:07,166 --> 02:06:13,083
Meeting you, l could not achieve
you, but l have understood love.

909
02:06:13,208 --> 02:06:18,083
Your happiness is with Shanty.
My happiness is in your happiness.

910
02:06:18,292 --> 02:06:20,291
Maybe, this is what is called love.

911
02:06:20,292 --> 02:06:23,207
Not taking, but giving.
l understood this..

912
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:26,207
..when l saw that you were ready..

913
02:06:26,208 --> 02:06:29,457
..to even give up
your life for your love.

914
02:06:29,458 --> 02:06:32,207
Today, for the
First time, l am with you.

915
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:35,207
Not like the shadow
that spreads darkness..

916
02:06:35,208 --> 02:06:40,083
..at all the time and at every
step, but today l am with you..

917
02:06:40,208 --> 02:06:45,083
..like that warmth whose light
shall help in your every journey.

918
02:06:45,667 --> 02:06:48,499
Then, you may take up any journey.

919
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:52,333
When any of the sun
rays fall upon you then l..

920
02:06:53,208 --> 02:06:58,125
.. will come like a new morning,
being a smile on your face.

921
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:00,125
Forever.

922
02:07:00,292 --> 02:07:02,207
'We are tied in the
bonds of memories..'

923
02:07:02,208 --> 02:07:05,666
..'please hold the
end of the bindings.'

924
02:07:05,667 --> 02:07:11,125
'Let me melt in your embrace again,
take my name again.'

925
02:07:18,208 --> 02:07:23,166
'l am that flame that will
light you and will melt myself.'

926
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:27,249
'The sun of the
morning is for you..'

927
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:30,709
'l am the night, l will set.'

928
02:07:30,709 --> 02:07:36,166
'Such a reunion
may occur again or not.'

929
02:07:36,542 --> 02:07:41,167
'You are my everything.'
