1
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:39,476
Delhi...

2
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:40,610
1999

3
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,211
One year ago India had
conducted a nuclear test...

4
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,417
and joined the nuclear power club.

5
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:50,218
The world was moving
into the new millennium.

6
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:55,229
And, I'd just begun reporting
for a news channel.

7
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:56,563
I was posted in Delhi.

8
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:16,312
Delhi... the city where I was born.

9
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:17,447
Where I grew up.

10
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:19,320
The city I never understood.

11
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,731
If Mumbai is about money...

12
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:28,662
then Delhi is about power.

13
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:30,326
Connections...

14
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:31,461
Influences...

15
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:32,595
Contacts...

16
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,607
Without these
any application is futile.

17
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:44,473
And every fight is about...

18
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,350
who you are.

19
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:49,417
Everybody is someone in Delhi.
Nobody is a nobody.

20
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:06,361
Are these pearls of wisdom
or an over-simplification...

21
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,963
I'm not sure.

22
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:11,375
So, I tried to
understand Delhi my way.

23
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:13,703
I failed.

24
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,514
I wondered if Delhi was
like any other metropolis.

25
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:20,919
But the more I learnt,
the less I understood.

26
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,655
Finally, I gave up trying.

27
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:07,423
Delhi was gearing up for
the summer with water coolers.

28
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,768
And for the Cricket
world cup with TV sets.

29
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,362
But then the spotlight moved
from cricket and the heat...

30
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,374
to another big event.

31
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:23,713
The Pakistani army and
militants seized the Kargil peaks.

32
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,379
The Indian government launched

33
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:29,444
a major military
operation to reclaim Kargil.

34
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:31,451
The Kargil war had begun.

35
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:33,915
Indians wore
patriotism on their sleeves.

36
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,858
Victory to India!

37
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:38,453
In the past cricket
united the country...

38
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,726
and now the war.

39
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,466
I went to Kargil.

40
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,728
I was reporting from Kargil
when another incident took place.

41
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:50,065
Something that would change the
face of politics and power in Delhi.

42
00:05:58,077 --> 00:05:59,135
Hello...

43
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,539
Who is it.

44
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,009
One second.

45
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:10,079
Sabrina...

46
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:12,014
It's Dileep on the line...

47
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:13,558
he says its urgent.

48
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,218
Okay, mom.

49
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:21,693
- Hello? - Sabrina, Dileep here.

50
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:24,827
Dileep, it's two a.m.

51
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:27,697
Sabrina, Jessica is hurt,
come quickly.

52
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,574
What do you mean she is hurt?

53
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:30,901
She has hurt herself.

54
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:33,974
She keeps hurting herself.

55
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:35,707
Take her to a doctor.
She will be okay.

56
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,975
I can't come now.
Anyway you are all with her.

57
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,642
Sabrina, it's a bullet wound.

58
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,048
What do you mean?

59
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,589
She has been shot.

60
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,117
What!

61
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:54,593
Sabrina, Dilip is here.
- Where is she?

62
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:58,068
Where is she, Dilip? Dilip,
where is she?

63
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,999
Sabrina. - How is she?
- Sabrina, she will be fine.

64
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,130
How is she?
- Just relax.

65
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:02,538
What happened?
- Sabrina, just relax.

66
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:04,132
- How did this happen?
- Just be cool.

67
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:06,534
- How can someone shoot her
just like that - Don't panic.

68
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:07,943
- Sabrina, relax.
- Weren't you all there?

69
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,546
- Why didn't you do something?
- We weren't there.

70
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:11,082
- You didn't do anything?
- Sabrina, relax.

71
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,549
- It happened so quickly.
- Shot with a bullet...

72
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:14,085
was it a fight?
How did this happen?

73
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:15,552
- But...
- Sabrina, listen.

74
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,555
- But how could someone walk in
with a gun?

75
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,614
Vikram Jaisingh was there.
- Where is he?

76
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,020
I saw her down... She was down, sir.

77
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:24,890
I... I... I couldn't do anything.

78
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:30,892
This guy... This crazy rogue...
He just... He just came and... He just...

79
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:33,902
Go ahead... go on.

80
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,899
Vikram?

81
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:40,573
Vikram...

82
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:41,704
Vikram.
- They came...

83
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:42,839
- Look at me.
- Poor Jess.

84
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:43,973
What happened?

85
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,650
He pulled out his gun and
he just shot her. - Who?

86
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,251
He just shot her. I swear...
- Who? Who shot at her?

87
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,585
Vikram... what happened?

88
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:52,715
They asked for drinks.

89
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,589
Vikram, how did it happen?
- I said we were out of drinks.

90
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,854
Who shot her? Look at me. Vikram.

91
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:56,986
He pulled out the gun.

92
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:58,120
Look at me, Vikram.

93
00:07:58,197 --> 00:07:59,255
He just shot her.

94
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:00,593
Vikram!

95
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,198
How did this happen?

96
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,666
Who shot at her?

97
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:17,745
Ladies and gentlemen, coming
up is your last track for night.

98
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:21,885
Ladies and gentlemen, so go on
until you get the power. So get set...

99
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,953
Go.
- Go.

100
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,771
Hi, Jess.

101
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:58,780
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope
you're having a fabulous time.

102
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:01,850
Well now give it up
to... 'Lust for Life'.

103
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:17,737
Jess, come on. Hurry up!

104
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:20,804
- Jess, aren't you coming
for coffee? - In ten minutes.

105
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,671
- You coming?
- No, have to go to college tomorrow.

106
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:27,749
Come on. - Jess, I'm really tired.
Don't irritate now.

107
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:29,745
Ya.

108
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:37,089
Your daughter is so thin.

109
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:38,753
So she is.

110
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,955
Your place is lovely.

111
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:44,025
The best in town.
- I know. I know.

112
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:45,361
Peter...

113
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:48,167
Peter! This is my husband Peter.

114
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,766
Hi, Peter!
- Peter, this is Bernard.

115
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,777
Chairman of the YCM Group.

116
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:55,780
Thank you. Cheers! - You guys
are having a good time? - Ya.

117
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,782
Alright. Alright.

118
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:04,120
It's crazy... - You know this guy?
He's gonna burn the ramp next year.

119
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:06,723
Vikram, meet Elton, Reena...
- Hi! - Hi!

120
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:09,056
If you want to walk
the ramp in Delhi...

121
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:10,387
these are the guys.

122
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:13,329
I'll keep that in mind... Excuse me!

123
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:56,898
- Jess... Jessica...
- What?

124
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,778
Who are those guys?

125
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:04,040
I have no idea.

126
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,783
Yeah... - Rahul! - One sec. One sec.
I'm not a genie or something.

127
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,980
Albert.
- Ya. - Pass an orange juice.

128
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,850
Jessica, so finally you have
decided to marry me. - Shut up!

129
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,986
- How many coupons do
you have? - Two... why?

130
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,853
Drinks finishing you
may not get them later.

131
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,057
Oh! You're out of drinks?

132
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:43,885
Here. Enjoy this.
- I love you, Jess.

133
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,890
Shut up!
- Still love you.

134
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,892
Now don't you tell me the
drinks are over. - Over.

135
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,019
No.
- Yes.

136
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:52,893
No.
- Yes. Come on.

137
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:56,833
Jess, come on. Please. Please.

138
00:11:56,902 --> 00:11:58,369
You always save the last one for me.

139
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,837
Come on. Please.

140
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:04,033
Please.

141
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,914
I knew it. I love you.

142
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:12,917
Please...
- Everybody loves you.

143
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:15,111
Now what?

144
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:16,381
Cleaning up, what else?

145
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:19,524
- We want drinks.

146
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:21,115
Sorry, sir, bar is closed.

147
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:23,184
I'm sure you will have
something somewhere.

148
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:25,992
Sorry, guys. The drinks are over.
- Exactly, sir. Really sorry.

149
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:27,464
Come on, Jess. We have lots to do.

150
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,864
You served everyone else.

151
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:44,074
Hey, Dileep!

152
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,342
Watch it pal!

153
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,410
What are you doing?

154
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:50,478
We didn't get a drink,
while you have two!

155
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:53,885
Anyway, carry on.

156
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,564
Mallika, your restaurant...

157
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:04,227
your parties, they're just too good.

158
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,564
Sweetheart, this is nothing.

159
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,975
Wait and see. It's going
to get bigger and better.

160
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:14,979
O my God! It's totally wild
out there. - Ya. Just like you.

161
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:19,975
I'm starving. Please
give me something to eat.

162
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,577
Behind the counter.

163
00:13:24,523 --> 00:13:26,252
- What? - Look, you will find it.

164
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,921
Peanuts?
- That's what I get paid.

165
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:31,326
Peanuts.
- Vikram, please...

166
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:32,988
- Hey there... pour us
a few drinks as well.

167
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:36,200
- I already told you,
drinks are over.

168
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:37,326
Come on...

169
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:40,465
Here...

170
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,597
take this and give us the drinks.

171
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:42,935
Please, you must be kidding!

172
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,268
We're out of drinks.

173
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:46,001
Sir, seriously...

174
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:47,136
Enough!

175
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:48,338
Don't try to 'sir' me!

176
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:49,946
We want the drinks.

177
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:51,944
He told you...

178
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,475
we're out of drinks.

179
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:57,086
Why don't you give us yours?

180
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:07,955
You know, I wouldn't even let
you have a sip of my drink...

181
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,024
for your thousand bucks.

182
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,108
Can I have a sip of you
for whatever you want?

183
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:22,041
Sir, that's enough.

184
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:26,982
We are completely out of drinks.

185
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:28,110
Now, you listen to me!

186
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:29,245
Take this and give us the drinks.

187
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:30,579
Come on, do it.

188
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:31,987
- What's the problem here?

189
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,051
Nothing at all, we want drinks.

190
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:38,058
We told you outside
the drinks are over.

191
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,188
How many times do we tell you?

192
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:40,322
Don't you get it?

193
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,060
No, I don't.

194
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,070
Stop it! I said stop it!

195
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:53,076
What the hell is this!

196
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:54,604
Don't you understand?

197
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,079
Just get out of here.

198
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,608
What did you say?

199
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:00,743
I say get out.

200
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,079
What?

201
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,214
I say get out.

202
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,348
Skank!

203
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:09,551
Now, will I get a drink?

204
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:13,222
Now?

205
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:14,356
I told you we're out of drinks.

206
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,625
- Come on, let it be.

207
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,033
Now?

208
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,161
Now?
- Put the gun away.

209
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:22,102
Now?
- Put the gun away.

210
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,232
Yes or no?

211
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:24,566
Put the gun away.

212
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:25,701
Now!

213
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:27,039
I said the drinks...

214
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,201
You idiot, what did you do?

215
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,064
You shot her.

216
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:53,462
I didn't do it.

217
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:55,664
- Why did you shoot her?

218
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:57,399
You shot her.

219
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,144
Why did you shoot her?

220
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:04,406
Why did you shoot her?

221
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,541
I... I didn't do it.

222
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:06,675
Lucky... run away...

223
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:07,810
Run... now!

224
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:09,553
- Give me the gun!
- I didn't shoot her.

225
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:12,215
Peter. Peter. Peter.

226
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:15,221
Stop that man. He has a gun.

227
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:19,089
- What happened?
- Sorry...

228
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,170
Somebody shot Jessica.

229
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:34,437
Somebody shot Jessica.

230
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:43,246
Somebody shot Jessica.

231
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:47,318
He shot her...

232
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:50,193
because she refused
to give him a drink?

233
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,324
Take down his statement for
the FIR and get him to sign.

234
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:57,459
Sir, right now?

235
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:00,328
Where is my baby?
- Jess.

236
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,270
Where is my baby?
- Mom. Mom.

237
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:05,674
She'll be fine.
- I'll just go and see her.

238
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:07,678
Mom, she'll be fine.

239
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,270
- I want to...
- She will be fine, mom.

240
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:12,146
Mom, she'll be fine.
She will be fine.

241
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:13,275
I will...
- Mom, she will be fine.

242
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:14,683
We need to take the
patient to AIIMS hospital.

243
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:17,346
Now!

244
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:27,356
She is gone.

245
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:31,833
Jessica is gone.

246
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:35,171
- No, Sabrina, she will be fine.

247
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,366
She is gone.

248
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:39,574
She's stopped breathing.

249
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,527
Hello, we are rolling

250
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:10,339
Meera, you are live.
You are on air.

251
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,204
Pakistani soldiers and
militants have been...

252
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,270
Beaten back by the Indian army.

253
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,206
After a month and half long war...

254
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:22,344
the Indian army has
reclaimed Tiger Hill.

255
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,614
On one hand...

256
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,358
there is joy and victory,
on the other...

257
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,222
there is despair for the martyrs.

258
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,490
Of course, it is sad.

259
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:34,555
Be it our soldiers or theirs.

260
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:35,827
We are all human.

261
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:37,292
We are soldiers.

262
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:39,303
We wear this uniform
to protect our country.

263
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:42,238
In a war, you either
kill or get killed.

264
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:43,899
Victory to India!

265
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:45,567
Victory to India!

266
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,644
We kill by profession.
Not by choice.

267
00:18:47,846 --> 00:18:49,711
If we don't kill them,
they will kill us.

268
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:51,243
This war that raged
for a month and a half...

269
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:54,251
claimed the lives of
countless Indian...

270
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,310
and Pakistani soldiers.

271
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:59,319
Both countries are now
faced with a critical question.

272
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:00,922
Was this war necessary?

273
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,259
Reporting from
Kargil for the last time...

274
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:04,852
with cameraman Mitul Dixit...

275
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,330
this is Meera Gaiti, for NDTV.

276
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:14,869
Excuse me!
- Yes, ma'am.

277
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,271
Can I have a newspaper please?

278
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:17,740
Sure, ma'am. I'll just get it.

279
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:22,274
Excuse me!

280
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,411
I've seen you somewhere.

281
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:29,276
Right, on TV!

282
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:32,284
You're really something!

283
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,289
Hi, I'm Anuj.

284
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:36,952
Hello!

285
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,356
I've never experienced
war like this.

286
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,295
It was amazing...

287
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:45,694
It was like watching
an action film.

288
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,294
It was so exciting.

289
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:49,966
Huge weapons, wide-gauge tanks...

290
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,305
rockets, airplanes, bunkers...

291
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:53,901
and the bodies of our soldiers.

292
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:57,906
I am sure you enjoyed that as well.

293
00:19:58,517 --> 00:19:59,575
I mean...

294
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:00,709
If you were there...

295
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,514
you would've been shitting bricks.

296
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:04,649
Excuse me! What did you say?

297
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,054
If you were there you
would've been shitting bricks.

298
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,988
Enjoyed it... nonsense!

299
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:15,328
Excuse me, ma'am! Your newspaper.

300
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,658
Thank you.

301
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:18,726
He is at the Manali guest-house.

302
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:32,874
It is safe...

303
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:34,350
but not for long.

304
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,083
You've seen the newspaper reports.

305
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,682
He is young, it was an accident.

306
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,554
Remember when we were young?

307
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:51,368
This is no fun and games,
he has killed someone.

308
00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:54,835
Do whatever it takes,
but save my Monu.

309
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,045
What are you thinking about?
He is our own.

310
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,372
Your son or mine...
I know it's painful.

311
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,382
Who was the girl?

312
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:12,384
Some small-time model.

313
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:14,652
She went and died
but dug a grave for us.

314
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:17,391
- What is this?
- See for yourself.

315
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:18,520
Tell me.

316
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:20,590
Open it and see.

317
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:26,470
You got a job?

318
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:28,062
As an assistant manager.

319
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,401
That too in Dubai!

320
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:31,066
India doesn't deserve me, babes.

321
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,473
Yeah, sure! When do you join?

322
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,602
Next month.

323
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:34,736
Did you tell mom and dad?

324
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:35,871
You will tell them.

325
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:38,074
You'll tell them and convince them.

326
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,474
Very smart.

327
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:40,809
Okay, I got to go.

328
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:42,409
You're coming for the party tonight?

329
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:43,545
No, I'm not coming.

330
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:44,680
Why not?

331
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:45,814
I get bored.

332
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,619
Shut up, come for a little while.

333
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:48,750
I'll make a sexy cocktail for you.

334
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:50,818
But I don't drink.

335
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:53,155
Virgin.

336
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:54,690
What did you say?

337
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,757
I was talking about the cocktail.

338
00:21:57,102 --> 00:22:00,094
Jess... I'll get you!

339
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:01,638
See you girls at the party.

340
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:03,037
And bring the prude.

341
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:04,575
This prude isn't coming.

342
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:06,440
- I'll see you at home
in the morning.

343
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:09,440
Lord Jesus...

344
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:12,712
You alone are holy
and compassionate.

345
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:15,709
Forgive our sister her sins.

346
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:20,524
In death you open the gates of
life for those who believe in you.

347
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:26,459
Do not let our sister be
parted from you, Lord.

348
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:30,726
But by your glorious power give
her life, joy and peace in heaven...

349
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:34,465
where you live
forever and ever. Amen!

350
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:35,797
Amen!

351
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:16,509
Dad, now don't start
crying like grandma.

352
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:19,042
Here I don't have time for
a boyfriend and...

353
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:20,914
you're talking marriage.

354
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:24,645
Yes, dad, I'll visit soon,
I promise.

355
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:28,519
Ok, dad, now don't bore me.
I've to go, dad. Bye. Love you.

356
00:23:57,288 --> 00:24:00,086
Meera, marry me!

357
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:01,887
Your girlfriend says
you're lousy in bed.

358
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,619
Try me.
- Try this.

359
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:06,095
- You're a celebrity now.

360
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:09,029
Great work. Congratulations!

361
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:10,959
Thank you.

362
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,559
I wanted to see you.

363
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,104
I wanted to talk to you about...
- Vacation?

364
00:24:14,572 --> 00:24:16,563
Raise? Cabin?

365
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:17,969
My new assignment.

366
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:20,575
What would you like to do?

367
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:22,577
What would you like me to do?

368
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:29,110
What about this?

369
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:39,259
These days even Hindi film
politicians aren't villains.

370
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,593
He's not gonna get away.

371
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:44,333
There are about 300
eyewitnesses or so.

372
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,598
- And not just anyone.

373
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,605
Models... bureaucrats.

374
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:50,607
Celebrities... police officers.

375
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:53,600
It's an open and shut case.
He's gone.

376
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:55,676
It's a very big story.

377
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:57,009
There is a lot of
public interest in it.

378
00:24:57,816 --> 00:24:59,010
This is Crime Beat stuff.

379
00:24:59,617 --> 00:25:02,279
Why don't you let
Rajesh Roy cover it?

380
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:03,945
He even looks like a criminal.

381
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:06,888
I think I deserve a much
bigger and better story.

382
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,619
Come on, Meera! To
match your profile...

383
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,820
India is not going
to fight another war.

384
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:15,631
I haven't declared
myself a war correspondent.

385
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:19,630
But I get the feeling that
my profile is being lowered.

386
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:22,696
Oh! You are such a witch,
Meera. You know that?

387
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:23,965
Of course I know.

388
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:25,168
What else did you think I was?
- Check out the news quick.

389
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:28,303
Manish Bhardwaj has
been arrested. It's live.

390
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:29,975
The witch is always right.

391
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:37,916
- Manish Bhardwaj has surrendered
himself at the Chandigarh court.

392
00:25:38,256 --> 00:25:40,190
- Police have taken him
into custody.

393
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:43,659
- He is being taken to
Delhi for questioning.

394
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:48,198
We would like to
tell our viewers that...

395
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,666
Manish Bhardwaj's
father Pramod Bhardwaj is...

396
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:53,067
a minister in the Haryana cabinet.

397
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:56,663
When Pramod Bhardwaj was
questioned about this matter.

398
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:58,670
Look...

399
00:25:58,743 --> 00:26:00,677
he is being framed.

400
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:04,074
I have full trust
in the legal system.

401
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:06,673
The truth will be out.

402
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:08,944
My son is innocent.

403
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:10,949
What if he isn't?

404
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:15,750
He will be.

405
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:21,093
Pramod Bhardwaj just said that
his son, Manish is innocent.

406
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,223
- June! - Mom?

407
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,701
The truth will be out when
the court gives it's verdict.

408
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,828
Listen...

409
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:30,165
Mom.

410
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,118
let's ask B. R.
Pandit to fight the case.

411
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,724
He is a well known criminal lawyer.

412
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,717
He has fought many such cases.

413
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,390
He has a 95 % success rate.

414
00:26:53,464 --> 00:26:54,726
And the other?

415
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,391
Who?

416
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:57,729
The lawyer...

417
00:26:58,336 --> 00:26:59,860
with the 100 % success rate.

418
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:00,996
Oh, Shyam Tolani?

419
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:03,735
He's retired.

420
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,334
He doesn't fight cases anymore.

421
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:08,344
He will, ask him his price.

422
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,742
We asked...

423
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:12,744
but he didn't budge.

424
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:17,880
Do whatever it takes,
but I want my Monu.

425
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:22,755
Sir, I was furious.

426
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:26,429
I was ready to pay a thousand bucks.

427
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:29,762
But she refused to give me a drink.

428
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,229
Did you know her?

429
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:34,295
No.

430
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:37,832
Then?

431
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,168
Sir...

432
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:42,037
then I...

433
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:43,171
I pulled out my gun.

434
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:47,375
Which one?

435
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:50,447
.22 bore, Italian Barreta.

436
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:52,514
When did you buy it?

437
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:55,050
Sir...

438
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:56,925
four months ago from Ambala.

439
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,125
Sir, I only wanted to scare her.

440
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:05,528
Nobody said a word.

441
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:10,805
I wanted to fire two
inches from her ear.

442
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:17,008
You wanted to fire two
inches from her ear?

443
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:18,406
Yes.

444
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:21,213
You wear spectacles, right?

445
00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:25,817
Did you wear them that night?

446
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,086
No, sir.

447
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,288
Look here...

448
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:38,361
how many inches is this from my ear?

449
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:57,053
Bloody b******.

450
00:28:58,256 --> 00:29:01,384
Two inches from her ear?

451
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:05,120
Go on.

452
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:11,867
What happened next?

453
00:29:17,608 --> 00:29:18,870
Listen...

454
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:22,070
don't be scared.

455
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:25,279
We are with you.

456
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:28,084
Mistakes happen.

457
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:31,878
Mistakes happen, right?

458
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:34,886
Now talk.

459
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,225
Now!

460
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:05,246
Listen...

461
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:10,319
I've been paid not to hit you.

462
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:11,986
Lots.

463
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:13,994
But if you don't talk...

464
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:16,392
my hand will do the talking.

465
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:23,938
So... you fired the bullet
two inches from her ear.

466
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:25,667
Okay?

467
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:27,202
Then what happened?

468
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:28,670
Tell me.

469
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:31,940
Sir... then I fled from there.

470
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:22,997
I think she's dead.

471
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:27,999
Who was she?

472
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:29,130
Some Jessica.

473
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,203
We're dead.

474
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:39,616
Vishal... we'll get screwed.

475
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:41,609
Real bad.

476
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:43,210
My car is still there.

477
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:46,020
Bloody hell, we are screwed.
My car... it's still there.

478
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,148
Wait here... stay here.

479
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:49,022
Lucky and I will bring it back.

480
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,287
Stay here. Come on Lucky...

481
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:51,419
Come on!

482
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,091
Vishal...

483
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:58,559
my pistol...

484
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:00,695
I hid it nearby.

485
00:32:01,372 --> 00:32:02,430
Where?

486
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:09,370
Come on.

487
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:10,505
Come on, Lucky.

488
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:11,773
Sir...

489
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:13,380
It was almost dawn...

490
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,586
We drove back to Lucky's house.

491
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:33,596
Sir, the deputy wants to see you.

492
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:36,533
Didn't you tell him, I'm busy?

493
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:39,736
I did, but he insisted.

494
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,138
Coming.

495
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:01,097
Go on, take a break.

496
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:34,129
The police have arrested
two more suspects in...

497
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:36,132
connection with the Jessica case.

498
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,134
Vishal Rastogi...

499
00:33:38,202 --> 00:33:40,864
son of U.P. minister R. D. Rastogi.

500
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,398
Lucky Singh...

501
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:45,874
an MBA and a resident of Delhi.

502
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,138
Police have also confiscated the
car in which the suspects fled

503
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:54,145
While combing through the car...

504
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:57,619
the police also
recovered a live cartridge.

505
00:33:57,888 --> 00:34:01,153
Which is being
treated as prime evidence.

506
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:05,559
Police had found two similar
.22 bore shell casings at Keno's.

507
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,557
One bullet hit the roof...

508
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,293
and the other bullet hit Jessica.

509
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:13,159
All three are from the same pistol...

510
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:16,695
which was most likely
used to shoot Jessica.

511
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,298
Just a minute... Just a minute...

512
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:20,173
Just a minute... let me speak...

513
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:21,302
let me speak... Just a minute...

514
00:34:21,512 --> 00:34:24,174
We still haven't
found the murder weapon.

515
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:26,647
Which is a .22 bore pistol.

516
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,782
Sir, do you have
any other evidence?

517
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:31,916
Yes, there is a lot of
circumstantial evidence.

518
00:34:32,189 --> 00:34:33,247
Police have arrested the suspects...

519
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:34,382
what are your comments?

520
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,656
My sister has been murdered.

521
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:41,589
And...

522
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,524
my family and I...

523
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,196
we believe...

524
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:47,261
and hope...

525
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:50,864
that the culprit will be punished...

526
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,533
and justice will prevail.

527
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,406
He is the son... just a minute!

528
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:57,470
He is the son of a
powerful politician.

529
00:34:57,548 --> 00:34:59,880
Are you afraid that
he might go scot free?

530
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,278
No!

531
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:05,413
Ma'am... Ma'am...

532
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:07,286
You never say anything to
Meera didi.

533
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:10,417
Nobody can say anything to Meera.

534
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:12,223
But, where is she?

535
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:13,354
I don't know.

536
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:25,566
Sometimes we don't value things...

537
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:27,235
as much as we should.

538
00:35:28,512 --> 00:35:31,447
Actors refuse a classic
thinking it isn't a great story.

539
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,377
People don't invest in an insurance
scheme thinking it might be a scam.

540
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:40,250
Young boys and girls are
so enamoured by a stranger...

541
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:42,258
that they fail to
recognize their soulmate.

542
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:46,256
Similarly, a
journalist ignores an incident...

543
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,388
thinking there's no story in it.

544
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:50,597
Something similar happened to me.

545
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:53,532
I thought it was a
run-of-the-mill story.

546
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:57,266
Not a milestone in the
history of a new India.

547
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:08,342
Sabrina...

548
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,281
you better be alert.

549
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:12,812
Do you know who you are up against?

550
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:16,686
What do you mean by that?

551
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:20,761
He murdered my sister
in front of everyone.

552
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:22,356
I know it.

553
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:23,559
You know it, the police know it...

554
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,631
And the 300 people there...

555
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:26,829
Only seven people.

556
00:36:29,707 --> 00:36:31,038
Nobody else was there.

557
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:36,311
Are you joking?

558
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,438
It is a joke.

559
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:42,046
I despise your
'high-society' people.

560
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:45,315
I'm tired asking them...
over and over...

561
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,985
"Were you at Keno's that night?"

562
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:51,388
I left at midnight.

563
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,319
It was my wife's birthday.

564
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:55,058
Uncle, I left at midnight.

565
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:56,594
I had exams.

566
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,328
I had to go to the
college in the morning.

567
00:36:58,402 --> 00:36:59,460
I swear.

568
00:36:59,537 --> 00:37:02,005
Sir, I left before the firing.

569
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:03,733
I guess around midnight.

570
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:05,871
I left at 12 O' clock.

571
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:08,538
Actually, we left.

572
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:10,341
Me and my boyfriend
had a plan, so you know...

573
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:11,472
we had to leave.

574
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:12,743
Were you at the party?

575
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,011
12 O' clock I was out.

576
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:19,885
You see, my husband was
coming from Singapore that day.

577
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:21,355
Business meeting.

578
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:24,019
So I remember leaving at
12 O' clock to pick him up.

579
00:37:27,097 --> 00:37:28,428
It's too hot in here.

580
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,356
How do you people work?

581
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:33,363
Can you please at
least turn on the AC?

582
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:37,767
Were you at Keno's that night?

583
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,035
I had left the place.

584
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:40,770
- I guess around... - Midnight?

585
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,369
I'm sure you left at midnight.

586
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:47,450
If I was there, I wouldn't
have let the a******* escape.

587
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,645
No, sir, we weren't drinking.

588
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:51,047
Did I ask you?

589
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:53,589
If you drank water...

590
00:37:53,657 --> 00:37:54,919
or a coke...

591
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:56,050
or juice...

592
00:37:56,393 --> 00:37:57,451
Did I ask?

593
00:37:57,995 --> 00:38:00,395
No, we never drank anything.

594
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:01,795
We left at midnight...

595
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:02,923
Enough!

596
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:05,128
Not one word!

597
00:38:09,607 --> 00:38:10,665
You tell me.

598
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:12,608
When everybody...

599
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:15,409
all 300 left at midnight...

600
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:18,410
were there ghosts
dancing at the party?

601
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:28,687
How can you hang out
with such people, Sabrina?

602
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,422
What kind of people are these?!

603
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:35,760
A girl lost her life and...

604
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:44,965
Here...

605
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,435
this file contains the
names of seven witnesses...

606
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:51,447
and their statements.

607
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:55,509
Vikram.

608
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,919
He saw the bullet being fired.

609
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,114
And lodged the FIR.

610
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:03,184
Yes.

611
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:06,520
It was him.

612
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,058
Take a closer look.

613
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,128
Yes.

614
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,802
He shot Jessica.

615
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:32,485
Don't worry,
it's merely a formality.

616
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:38,619
Sir...

617
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:40,491
Only these seven people...

618
00:39:40,564 --> 00:39:44,227
have told us
what happened that night.

619
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:46,968
- Okay? - Okay.

620
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:48,761
They are our prime witnesses.

621
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:54,101
The case will be presented
before the court for a hearing.

622
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:58,981
But if one of them
lies for any reason...

623
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,041
Then anything can happen.

624
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,781
What do you mean,
anything can happen?

625
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:08,114
What do you think I mean...

626
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:09,717
use your imagination.

627
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:13,187
Go on.

628
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:58,766
Well, ma'am...

629
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,305
I want to do what is right.

630
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:06,173
I am poor, with a wife
and two little kids.

631
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:08,913
I don't want to get into a mess.

632
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,311
Try to understand my plight.

633
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:16,790
What about my plight?

634
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:20,191
My sister is no more.

635
00:41:26,203 --> 00:41:30,003
Just tell the court what you saw.

636
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:33,007
Only because you were there.

637
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,144
What about
the other 300 people there?

638
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:39,882
Please... excuse me.

639
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:42,145
I can't do this.

640
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:46,353
Is someone threatening you?

641
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,217
Who is it?

642
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,758
One witness is dealt with.

643
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:56,357
What about the others?

644
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:58,692
They will come around too.

645
00:42:01,038 --> 00:42:02,699
Sir, they are being threatened.

646
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:06,231
They would complain if
they were threatened.

647
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:08,310
And the police would
provide protection.

648
00:42:08,378 --> 00:42:10,312
What about protecting our witnesses?

649
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,315
But we don't have a witness
protection programme in India.

650
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:14,842
We follow a procedure.

651
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:17,182
If we receive a complaint...
we will take action.

652
00:42:17,254 --> 00:42:20,382
How do you expect us to Take
action without a complaint?

653
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:23,785
Even then we will keep a watch.

654
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:28,063
That's Mr. Saxena, the prosecution
lawyer And a good friend too.

655
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:30,263
Hello!
- He has promised to do his best.

656
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,662
Ms. Sabrina...

657
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:34,333
witness tampering is quite normal.

658
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:37,333
But don't be worried about it.

659
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:39,340
We have a strong case.

660
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,671
I have a feeling that boy...

661
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,808
will go free.

662
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:52,012
No.

663
00:42:54,758 --> 00:42:57,158
How can he go free?

664
00:42:57,761 --> 00:42:59,160
I mean, how can he be set free?

665
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:01,355
Honour is...

666
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:06,235
My honour is still alive.

667
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,432
I will tell the truth.

668
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,233
I told the police...

669
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,702
I will tell the court as well.

670
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:13,771
I swear, don't worry.

671
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,709
I hadn't lost hope.

672
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:21,183
But you've given me courage.

673
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:22,776
Thank you.

674
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:24,380
Why do you say that?

675
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:27,713
She was your sister, she
could've been mine too.

676
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,318
Your tea.

677
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:37,396
As I was saying, Ms. Sabrina...

678
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:38,729
I have...

679
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,734
This problem.

680
00:43:41,138 --> 00:43:42,469
If you could...

681
00:43:43,006 --> 00:43:44,064
I mean...

682
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:46,934
Go on...

683
00:43:47,477 --> 00:43:48,739
tell me.

684
00:43:48,812 --> 00:43:50,746
You see...

685
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:04,355
He said he wants to
tell the truth in court.

686
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:07,021
Dad...

687
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:09,960
of all the people present
that night...

688
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:13,497
He is the poorest and
most vulnerable.

689
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:15,429
That's why...

690
00:44:15,505 --> 00:44:17,097
I understand, my dear.

691
00:44:30,787 --> 00:44:31,845
Hello, sir.

692
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:34,181
We...

693
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:36,782
don't have 50,000 rupees right now.

694
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:38,986
Here's 20,000.

695
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:41,261
It's okay, this will do.

696
00:44:41,798 --> 00:44:43,527
I shall take the rest later.

697
00:44:45,002 --> 00:44:46,993
- Mr. Dharam... - Yes?

698
00:44:48,538 --> 00:44:50,199
We gave you the money...

699
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:52,001
because you needed it.

700
00:44:52,876 --> 00:44:54,537
Please only tell the truth
in court.

701
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:57,875
Not for me or anyone else.

702
00:44:57,948 --> 00:44:59,006
I will, madam.

703
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:02,279
I will tell the truth.
I swear, I will.

704
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:14,823
I don't know about mum,
but Sabrina...

705
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:17,091
I am with you.

706
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:19,897
I want that man punished.

707
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:34,177
I don't know, Sabrina.

708
00:45:44,528 --> 00:45:45,586
Thank you.

709
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:48,864
I saw him...

710
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:51,595
and yet in a way, I didn't.

711
00:45:54,137 --> 00:45:57,595
I'm not sure. I don't know.

712
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:02,402
I'm so confused.

713
00:46:05,415 --> 00:46:09,215
But Jess... Poor Jess.

714
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:25,896
You want some?

715
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:36,037
You now what, Mallika...

716
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:40,440
she adored you.

717
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:30,961
Vikram.

718
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:34,698
Everything hinges on his testimony.

719
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:38,238
Vikram is their star witness.

720
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,300
He registered the FIR.

721
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:45,310
If Vikram identifies Manish
in court...

722
00:47:45,715 --> 00:47:50,379
then no lawyer in the
world can help your son.

723
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:53,382
I'll take care of him, Mr. Pandit.

724
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:57,323
I shall prepare
each witness for you.

725
00:47:58,728 --> 00:47:59,990
You look after the trial.

726
00:48:01,064 --> 00:48:02,463
Leave the witnesses...

727
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:04,261
to me.

728
00:48:06,336 --> 00:48:07,997
Then it comes down to...

729
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:10,733
the ballistics report.
What's the progress, R.D. sir?

730
00:48:29,426 --> 00:48:30,757
Hello?
- Hello...

731
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:32,493
- Vikram? - Yes.

732
00:48:33,763 --> 00:48:35,355
Hi. Sabrina.

733
00:48:39,236 --> 00:48:40,362
How are you, Vikram?

734
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:46,100
- Who is it? - You
know I've been trying to...

735
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:47,701
Hello?

736
00:48:47,777 --> 00:48:49,039
Vikram?

737
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:50,304
Are you there?

738
00:48:53,316 --> 00:48:54,374
Hello?

739
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:56,448
Hello... aunty...

740
00:48:57,053 --> 00:48:58,111
Sabrina here.

741
00:48:58,188 --> 00:48:59,450
Jessica's sister.

742
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:14,064
What happened?

743
00:49:14,537 --> 00:49:15,595
They hung up.

744
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:23,270
Sir...

745
00:49:24,748 --> 00:49:25,806
Thank you.

746
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:40,420
Taxi!

747
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,358
Ballygunj?

748
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:58,505
Namaste.

749
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:43,350
Tea?

750
00:50:56,906 --> 00:50:58,567
Vikram isn't here.

751
00:50:59,242 --> 00:51:00,300
What?

752
00:51:00,377 --> 00:51:02,242
I mean, Vikram isn't home right now.

753
00:51:02,912 --> 00:51:04,379
You just said he is!

754
00:51:04,447 --> 00:51:06,915
Yes, but he went out.

755
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:09,518
I need just five minutes.

756
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:12,180
Madam, I told you,
he isn't home right now.

757
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:14,580
Now, go away, leave!

758
00:51:14,724 --> 00:51:16,191
I've come from Delhi.

759
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:19,854
I already told you.
Why don't you understand?

760
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:23,729
You're here to create trouble.

761
00:51:36,946 --> 00:51:39,881
Jess, wake up.

762
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:42,747
It's Sunday, let's go to church.

763
00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:43,877
I don't want to.

764
00:51:43,953 --> 00:51:46,285
Let me sleep.

765
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,955
Or we'll have to listen
to mom's sermons all day!

766
00:51:51,227 --> 00:51:56,494
Jess.

767
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:58,564
Jess?
- Please let me sleep!

768
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:00,569
Wake up, sleeping beauty!

769
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:25,986
They were here.

770
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:34,393
And you let them in?

771
00:52:36,005 --> 00:52:38,269
Sabrina, I opened the door...

772
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:39,467
and they were outside.

773
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:40,935
What could I do?

774
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,341
"What could I do?"

775
00:52:43,346 --> 00:52:45,746
Dad, their son killed Jess.

776
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:47,680
"What could I do?"

777
00:52:48,017 --> 00:52:52,681
They are threatening and
bribing the witnesses...

778
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:55,951
I'm not sure if he
will ever be punished.

779
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:57,287
"What could I do?"

780
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:00,888
He will go free, dad, free!

781
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:02,022
Sorry...

782
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:04,424
Sorry, dear.

783
00:53:10,507 --> 00:53:18,642
Why is life so frail...

784
00:53:19,315 --> 00:53:28,656
Trying to eke out a living...

785
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:37,323
Is this really life...

786
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:46,940
Once it was like
the butterflies...

787
00:53:47,744 --> 00:53:52,340
bright and carefree...

788
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:56,351
Unlike the earthworms
living underneath...

789
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:16,030
Hello... Sabrina?

790
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:17,764
We have a problem.

791
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,898
We have a problem.

792
00:54:18,975 --> 00:54:21,375
One of the two shell
casings that was...

793
00:54:21,444 --> 00:54:23,378
sent for forensics
has been replaced.

794
00:54:23,446 --> 00:54:26,040
What do you mean replaced?
How is that possible?

795
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:28,976
It is possible.

796
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,578
Anything is possible.

797
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:37,985
Leave the room.

798
00:54:43,132 --> 00:54:44,793
I took seven million rupees.

799
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:48,403
For not hitting him in the lock-up.

800
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:54,068
What are you staring at?

801
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:56,936
Everybody takes bribes.

802
00:54:57,947 --> 00:54:59,005
Get it?

803
00:54:59,082 --> 00:55:00,413
Only the reasons change.

804
00:55:04,153 --> 00:55:06,485
Which day and age do you live in?

805
00:55:11,494 --> 00:55:12,756
Who replaced the bullets?

806
00:55:13,963 --> 00:55:15,487
Probably Kuldeep Singh.

807
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:17,624
Kuldeep Singh?

808
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:18,892
Lab-in-charge.

809
00:55:19,702 --> 00:55:21,636
He belongs to R. D.
Rastogi's community.

810
00:55:22,438 --> 00:55:24,030
Rastogi is pulling the strings.

811
00:55:24,974 --> 00:55:27,169
Take my word, talk to
the DCP immediately.

812
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:30,173
Otherwise the case I've
built up, will go down the drain.

813
00:55:32,782 --> 00:55:35,444
Sir, all I am saying is...
- Don't be paranoid, Sabrina.

814
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:38,179
Prosecution has handed the case
to the investigating officers.

815
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:41,183
We have to trust them,
and you have to trust us.

816
00:55:41,524 --> 00:55:44,584
Sir, I'm doing that but
please try to understand.

817
00:55:45,128 --> 00:55:48,461
There is some foul play.
The bullets have been changed.

818
00:55:48,531 --> 00:55:50,192
Sabrina, that's not possible.

819
00:55:51,134 --> 00:55:52,465
Even then if you insist...

820
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:53,793
I will look into it.

821
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:57,137
Well, I have many
more cases to attend?

822
00:55:57,473 --> 00:55:58,531
Will you please?

823
00:56:00,943 --> 00:56:02,467
Send Mayur in.

824
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:04,679
- Sir... - Please, Sabrina!

825
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,235
- Phone! Where's the phone?

826
00:56:33,843 --> 00:56:34,901
Okay.

827
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:40,039
Hello?

828
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:46,249
When? Okay, I'm coming over.

829
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:48,250
- What? - I have to go.

830
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:50,650
Now? You can't do this.

831
00:56:52,528 --> 00:56:54,587
Of course I can.
It's a free country.

832
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:58,925
What're you doing?

833
00:56:59,202 --> 00:57:00,260
Going.

834
00:57:00,536 --> 00:57:01,696
What am I supposed to do?

835
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:06,531
Fly solo.
- What!

836
00:57:10,146 --> 00:57:11,875
We've just received
information that...

837
00:57:11,948 --> 00:57:16,214
Indian Airlines flight number
IC-814 from Kathmandu to Delhi...

838
00:57:16,285 --> 00:57:17,752
has been hijacked.

839
00:57:18,154 --> 00:57:20,554
There were about 200
passengers on board.

840
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:23,921
Sources indicate that the
flight will be taken to Amritsar.

841
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,554
We have no information about
the hijackers and their motives.

842
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:31,024
Listen to this...

843
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:32,691
the flight is being
taken to Afghanistan.

844
00:57:33,302 --> 00:57:36,032
The hijackers have demanded
the release of three terrorists.

845
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:38,573
And one of them is Jaish-E-Mohammed
chief, Maulana Masood Azhar.

846
00:57:39,108 --> 00:57:40,575
I've heard the Indian
government has decided...

847
00:57:40,643 --> 00:57:42,907
to release the terrorists in
exchange for the passengers.

848
00:57:44,247 --> 00:57:46,181
- My sources told me.
- Mine haven't.

849
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:48,840
Let's face it.
Your sources suck. Mine don't.

850
00:57:48,918 --> 00:57:50,943
Damn you! - In your dreams.
- Who are your sources?

851
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,580
Do you really think I'm gonna
answer that? - Okay. How reliable?

852
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:55,988
More than yours.

853
00:57:56,058 --> 00:57:57,116
Sometimes you are such a bitch.
- Sometimes? All the time.

854
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,585
Okay, everyone. IC814
is the biggest story.

855
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:03,188
Everyone get on it. Every news
report should be related to it.

856
00:58:03,266 --> 00:58:05,097
Let's be the first to get
everything out there, alright?

857
00:58:05,601 --> 00:58:07,068
Meera leads the story.
Everyone backs her up. Got it?

858
00:58:07,136 --> 00:58:08,194
Yes, sir.

859
00:58:08,271 --> 00:58:11,001
Gaurav, there are new
developments In the Jessica case.

860
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:13,268
It seems like the
witnesses are being influenced.

861
00:58:13,342 --> 00:58:16,004
Listen, cutie!
IC-814 is now priority.

862
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:17,602
But, Gaurav the Jessica case...
- Shut up!

863
00:58:18,147 --> 00:58:20,138
Listen guys, IC-814 is priority.

864
00:58:20,616 --> 00:58:22,607
If someone wants to pursue
another story, go ahead.

865
00:58:22,685 --> 00:58:24,619
The others can come with me,
I'll need a lot of support.

866
00:58:24,854 --> 00:58:26,617
So start moving your feet right now.

867
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:47,640
Trust me, Ms. Sabrina, I swear.

868
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:50,803
I swear he is staying
at a five-star hotel.

869
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,642
They have given him
ten million rupees.

870
00:58:52,882 --> 00:58:54,941
They offered Vikram...

871
00:58:55,651 --> 00:58:56,709
ten million...

872
00:58:57,253 --> 00:58:58,379
or a bullet.

873
00:58:58,654 --> 00:58:59,746
He made a smart choice.

874
00:59:00,389 --> 00:59:01,651
They asked me what I wanted.

875
00:59:04,327 --> 00:59:06,192
I'll do what is right.

876
00:59:06,662 --> 00:59:09,392
Exactly what I told you,
I will testify on your behalf.

877
00:59:09,732 --> 00:59:12,030
I may be poor but I'm honest.

878
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,139
This... it's only
because I'm in need, I swear.

879
00:59:18,674 --> 00:59:20,335
Which hotel is he staying at?

880
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:25,806
Good evening. Leela.
How may I help you?

881
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:30,675
I'm concerned about a
friend of mine. Vikram Jai.

882
00:59:31,287 --> 00:59:35,121
He was supposed to check in yesterday
or day before. Has he checked in?

883
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:36,916
Your name, ma'am?

884
00:59:37,693 --> 00:59:39,888
- Sabrina. - Just a moment, please.

885
00:59:42,331 --> 00:59:44,356
Mr. Vikram checked in day before.

886
00:59:44,934 --> 00:59:46,697
Would you like to
leave a message for him?

887
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:51,230
Ma'am...

888
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,702
Hello?

889
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:55,868
Didn't I tell you?

890
00:59:59,715 --> 01:00:01,307
- Hi...
- Hi, ma'am.

891
01:00:01,717 --> 01:00:04,914
My friend Vikram Jai is staying here.
I'd like to meet him.

892
01:00:05,187 --> 01:00:06,814
Sure, ma'am.
Could I have your name please?

893
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:07,947
Sabrina.

894
01:00:10,192 --> 01:00:13,719
Ma'am... was it you who
called last evening?

895
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:18,727
Yes. - Ma'am, I'm afraid,
Mr. Vikram checked out last night.

896
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:27,402
Ma'am.
- Yes. - I told him you had called.

897
01:00:30,746 --> 01:00:34,739
The Indian government has
freed the hostages on board...

898
01:00:34,817 --> 01:00:35,875
IC-814 after six days.

899
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:37,212
In exchange for the passengers...

900
01:00:37,286 --> 01:00:40,221
the government had to
release three terrorists.

901
01:00:40,756 --> 01:00:41,882
Ours is a soft state.

902
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:44,885
Why does the Indian
government always give in?

903
01:00:45,494 --> 01:00:49,487
Tough call, two hundred
innocent people or three terrorists.

904
01:00:50,766 --> 01:00:51,824
Just a minute.

905
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:53,159
The circus is over.

906
01:00:54,103 --> 01:00:55,764
I'm going home, bye.

907
01:00:55,838 --> 01:00:56,896
Bye.

908
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:03,172
Give me two minutes, Sabrina.

909
01:01:03,245 --> 01:01:04,303
Bye, Meera.

910
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:33,802
Hi! Meera.

911
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:36,102
Hi!

912
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,338
I've seen you on TV.

913
01:01:40,449 --> 01:01:42,815
Hang in there. That
rogue is going down.

914
01:01:43,819 --> 01:01:45,810
Sabrina. Come. We are ready for you.

915
01:01:46,822 --> 01:01:48,187
See you.
- Bye.

916
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:53,295
Sabrina, the trial is
about to begin.

917
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:57,128
What do you expect from it?

918
01:02:02,505 --> 01:02:03,904
Would you like to say something?

919
01:02:05,374 --> 01:02:07,842
Perhaps something about Jessica.

920
01:02:08,577 --> 01:02:09,839
Yes.

921
01:02:15,384 --> 01:02:16,442
Jessica...

922
01:02:16,919 --> 01:02:18,011
is my sister.

923
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:21,147
I mean, she was.

924
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,483
But she could've been
anyone's sister.

925
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:28,521
My parents adored her.

926
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:33,867
She could've been
anyone's adorable daughter.

927
01:02:35,471 --> 01:02:37,234
She was a simple girl.

928
01:02:38,874 --> 01:02:41,900
She had dreams like any other girl.

929
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:44,172
She wanted to own a restaurant.

930
01:02:45,514 --> 01:02:46,879
She wanted to fall in love.

931
01:02:48,884 --> 01:02:50,476
She wanted to marry.

932
01:02:52,888 --> 01:02:54,879
And have lots of children.

933
01:02:57,893 --> 01:03:00,259
But before she could
fulfill her dreams...

934
01:03:02,898 --> 01:03:04,092
she was shot dead.

935
01:03:06,035 --> 01:03:09,004
The circumstances in
which this happened...

936
01:03:09,071 --> 01:03:11,369
I mean, just because...

937
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:14,967
at that moment...

938
01:03:15,044 --> 01:03:17,911
she couldn't give someone a drink.

939
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:20,506
She was shot dead because...

940
01:03:22,084 --> 01:03:27,920
someone with a pistol in his
hand and power in his head...

941
01:03:28,924 --> 01:03:33,258
decided that her life was
cheaper than a glass of his drink.

942
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,228
Is the value of life...

943
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:43,171
so cheap in our country?

944
01:03:43,939 --> 01:03:45,270
Cheaper than a drink?

945
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:49,168
We can understand that
you and your family...

946
01:03:49,245 --> 01:03:50,542
I don't think you can.

947
01:03:53,549 --> 01:03:56,609
I'm... I mean I'm sorry.

948
01:03:59,555 --> 01:04:01,955
This could've happened...

949
01:04:02,024 --> 01:04:03,491
to anyone.

950
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:07,962
I've lost my sister.

951
01:04:09,598 --> 01:04:11,498
My parents lost their daughter.

952
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:13,693
Dad, I am going. See you tomorrow.

953
01:04:13,769 --> 01:04:16,431
But it could've been anyone else.

954
01:04:17,306 --> 01:04:22,039
Do you think the outcome of this
case will have a message for society?

955
01:04:23,078 --> 01:04:25,706
I have no idea, but Aditi...

956
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:29,080
I made a promise to Jess.

957
01:04:30,586 --> 01:04:32,713
And to myself.

958
01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:35,987
Until justice is served...

959
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:38,050
I won't cry.

960
01:04:42,665 --> 01:04:44,724
Tinki, bring me the pickle.

961
01:04:45,234 --> 01:04:47,225
She deserves it.

962
01:04:47,603 --> 01:04:49,070
She was a very brave girl.

963
01:04:53,242 --> 01:04:54,300
Me...

964
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:56,335
and her friends...

965
01:04:57,346 --> 01:05:00,315
most of whom were
with her that night...

966
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:04,617
All owe it to Jess.

967
01:05:07,022 --> 01:05:08,319
And I am sure they will do it.

968
01:05:13,629 --> 01:05:15,028
They are here. Get the camera ready.

969
01:05:28,444 --> 01:05:29,502
What's happening here?

970
01:05:31,046 --> 01:05:32,104
Some parade?

971
01:05:37,286 --> 01:05:38,412
Some VIP?

972
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:41,380
Get lost!

973
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,067
Sir, sir... One question... Sir...

974
01:06:29,104 --> 01:06:30,628
Just like that.

975
01:06:30,706 --> 01:06:32,503
It is stated it very clearly.

976
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:56,127
Sir, I would like to
present the case of my client.

977
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:01,134
When you bumped into
him at the party...

978
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:04,469
you had two drinks in your hand?

979
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,598
Yes.

980
01:07:05,874 --> 01:07:09,139
And, how drunk were you?

981
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:11,737
I don't remember, sir.

982
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:14,274
But...

983
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:19,583
you do remember that the
person you bumped into...

984
01:07:20,155 --> 01:07:21,213
was him.

985
01:07:22,891 --> 01:07:27,885
Yes.
- Are you sure? - Yes.

986
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:30,459
You're lying.

987
01:07:30,532 --> 01:07:32,693
Objection, your honour.
- Overruled!

988
01:07:33,168 --> 01:07:34,226
Your honour...

989
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,400
We need to point out...

990
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,706
a person who doesn't
remember how many drinks he had...

991
01:07:42,778 --> 01:07:45,645
remembers clearly that...

992
01:07:45,848 --> 01:07:51,480
he bumped into my client
amongst the 300 people there.

993
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:01,489
Did you see him with the gun?

994
01:08:04,433 --> 01:08:06,367
He looks somewhat like him.

995
01:08:07,436 --> 01:08:08,664
But I am not sure.

996
01:08:09,204 --> 01:08:10,796
Objection, sir.
- Overruled!

997
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:11,931
Is it him?

998
01:08:13,409 --> 01:08:14,603
I'm not sure.

999
01:08:14,676 --> 01:08:15,734
I object, sir.

1000
01:08:16,211 --> 01:08:17,269
Is...

1001
01:08:17,946 --> 01:08:20,437
- this him?
- I object, sir.

1002
01:08:20,682 --> 01:08:21,740
Overruled!

1003
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:23,275
- Is it him?

1004
01:08:24,887 --> 01:08:26,752
- Is it him?

1005
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:31,223
I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

1006
01:08:31,794 --> 01:08:33,227
I'm not sure.

1007
01:08:33,295 --> 01:08:34,694
The witness is being intimidated.

1008
01:08:35,597 --> 01:08:38,225
The witness is being intimidated.
Sir!

1009
01:08:44,573 --> 01:08:45,699
He was the guy.

1010
01:08:46,475 --> 01:08:47,635
Who was the guy?

1011
01:08:48,644 --> 01:08:50,544
That man... He was the guy.

1012
01:08:51,847 --> 01:08:52,905
Are you sure?

1013
01:08:54,249 --> 01:08:55,307
What do you mean?

1014
01:08:55,717 --> 01:08:58,481
Are you sure he was the guy?

1015
01:08:59,855 --> 01:09:00,981
I am not blind.

1016
01:09:01,256 --> 01:09:02,416
He was the guy.

1017
01:09:02,624 --> 01:09:05,354
This man was the guy.
This man was the guy.

1018
01:09:05,427 --> 01:09:08,521
Order! Order!
- Move away.

1019
01:09:08,597 --> 01:09:09,655
Order in court.

1020
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,558
It was him.

1021
01:09:15,504 --> 01:09:16,562
Ms. Naina...

1022
01:09:17,506 --> 01:09:18,871
are you sure?

1023
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:20,799
It was him?

1024
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:22,334
Yes.

1025
01:09:22,878 --> 01:09:25,642
What was he wearing?

1026
01:09:26,281 --> 01:09:28,272
Black trousers and a maroon shirt.

1027
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:30,879
You are sure?
- I am sure.

1028
01:09:33,288 --> 01:09:37,281
By the way, what were you wearing?

1029
01:09:42,297 --> 01:09:43,457
Go on.

1030
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:45,533
Answer my question.

1031
01:09:47,436 --> 01:09:48,664
What were you wearing?

1032
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:53,365
I guess you had one drink too many.

1033
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,768
Perhaps...

1034
01:09:56,845 --> 01:09:57,903
you don't remember.

1035
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,948
I was a wearing a red Versace dress.

1036
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:05,512
With a strapless
pink Eveselaron bra.

1037
01:10:07,322 --> 01:10:09,916
I also remember the color,
the make and the style of...

1038
01:10:09,992 --> 01:10:12,722
the undergarment
I was wearing under that dress.

1039
01:10:15,664 --> 01:10:18,326
I remember it all too clearly,
Mr. Pandit.

1040
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:21,599
Would you like me to
tell you all of that?

1041
01:10:25,507 --> 01:10:26,565
No.

1042
01:10:28,343 --> 01:10:29,935
That won't be necessary.

1043
01:10:31,013 --> 01:10:32,412
I saw nothing, I was on the roof.

1044
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:35,348
You told the police you saw him.

1045
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:37,351
- I saw nothing, I was on the roof.
- That's a lie.

1046
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:38,909
- I was on the roof.
- You're lying.

1047
01:10:38,987 --> 01:10:40,420
- I was on the roof.
- Thats a lie.

1048
01:10:40,489 --> 01:10:41,820
- I was on the roof.
- He is lying.

1049
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:44,358
I was on the roof.
- How long will you stay there?

1050
01:10:44,426 --> 01:10:45,484
It's time you climbed down.

1051
01:10:45,761 --> 01:10:47,888
People came, someone was shot,
the police arrived...

1052
01:10:47,963 --> 01:10:50,090
About time you came down!

1053
01:10:57,973 --> 01:10:59,031
Silence please!

1054
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,519
Sir, I wasn't here in Delhi.

1055
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:16,050
My mother was ill,
I was with her in the village.

1056
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:17,850
I swear, sir.

1057
01:11:18,393 --> 01:11:19,451
I object, sir.

1058
01:11:20,395 --> 01:11:21,453
Witness hostile.

1059
01:11:21,997 --> 01:11:23,931
- The witness has been bought.
- Overruled!

1060
01:11:24,132 --> 01:11:25,394
Your honour...

1061
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:30,065
I'd like to call upon the most
important witness in this case.

1062
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:31,797
May I?

1063
01:11:31,873 --> 01:11:32,931
Proceed.

1064
01:12:20,956 --> 01:12:23,823
- Mr. Vikram Jaisingh...

1065
01:12:25,827 --> 01:12:28,796
do you recognise that man?

1066
01:12:34,136 --> 01:12:35,194
Answer me.

1067
01:12:36,838 --> 01:12:38,465
I'm sorry, I don't understand Hindi.

1068
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,472
Can you please ask
your question in English?

1069
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:45,106
I'm sorry, my mistake.

1070
01:12:46,214 --> 01:12:47,647
Do you know this man?

1071
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,146
I saw him at the party.

1072
01:12:54,489 --> 01:12:58,585
You saw him? Was he the one
who shot Jessica that night?

1073
01:13:02,964 --> 01:13:06,627
'Somebody shot Jessica.'

1074
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:20,572
No.

1075
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:21,940
Objection, sir.

1076
01:13:22,517 --> 01:13:23,609
Witness hostile.
- Objection overruled!

1077
01:13:23,685 --> 01:13:25,118
The witness is
retracting his statement.

1078
01:13:26,655 --> 01:13:29,556
Silence! Silence in court!

1079
01:13:30,759 --> 01:13:31,817
Witness may proceed.

1080
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:33,119
They were two guys.

1081
01:13:33,862 --> 01:13:35,056
One tall and one short.

1082
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:37,690
Objection, sir.
- The short guy fired at the ceiling.

1083
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:39,864
And the tall guy at Jessica.

1084
01:13:39,935 --> 01:13:40,993
I object, sir.

1085
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:44,561
And the short person resembled him?
- Objection, sir.

1086
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:45,697
Somewhat.

1087
01:13:45,774 --> 01:13:47,605
I'm not too sure.

1088
01:13:47,809 --> 01:13:48,901
Objection, sir.

1089
01:13:48,977 --> 01:13:50,535
Go on...
- Witness hostile.

1090
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,874
In his statement he said
that two bullets were fired...

1091
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,611
by Manish Bhardwaj.

1092
01:13:56,685 --> 01:13:57,982
The statement was taken in Hindi...

1093
01:13:58,053 --> 01:14:00,180
and as I said I don't know Hindi.

1094
01:14:00,555 --> 01:14:02,546
I didn't know what was
written in the police paper.

1095
01:14:02,624 --> 01:14:03,886
Your honour, Vikram is lying.

1096
01:14:04,025 --> 01:14:06,687
We read out the
entire statement to him.

1097
01:14:06,762 --> 01:14:08,957
He signed only after
understanding every word.

1098
01:14:09,097 --> 01:14:11,565
As I said earlier
I don't understand Hindi.

1099
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,565
Do any of these three
people resemble the person...

1100
01:14:13,769 --> 01:14:17,296
who shot Jessica that night?

1101
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:18,834
I object, sir.

1102
01:14:18,907 --> 01:14:21,102
Mr. Saxena, let him finish.

1103
01:14:23,812 --> 01:14:25,871
Go on. Answer me.

1104
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:30,244
Do any of these three resemble
the person who shot Jessica?

1105
01:14:32,721 --> 01:14:35,189
No.
- Objection, sir. Objection.

1106
01:14:35,257 --> 01:14:36,918
Overruled! Continue.

1107
01:14:36,992 --> 01:14:39,051
As the prime witness,
Vikram, just said...

1108
01:14:40,195 --> 01:14:42,686
There was a tall man
who shot at Jessica.

1109
01:14:43,064 --> 01:14:45,589
And a short one who
fired at the ceiling...

1110
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:47,999
who somehow resembled my client.

1111
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:51,003
The bullets were fired
by two people.

1112
01:14:51,606 --> 01:14:53,767
The bullets were fired
from two different pistols.

1113
01:14:54,609 --> 01:14:55,667
To prove this...

1114
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:57,135
your honour...

1115
01:14:57,345 --> 01:15:00,610
I'd like to call upon,
forensic expert, Kuldeep Singh.

1116
01:15:00,682 --> 01:15:01,740
Sir...

1117
01:15:01,817 --> 01:15:03,751
the two used shell casings
that the police sent us...

1118
01:15:03,885 --> 01:15:05,614
were from different pistols.

1119
01:15:05,687 --> 01:15:09,020
Sir, the casings we sent to the
lab were from the same pistol.

1120
01:15:10,225 --> 01:15:11,351
The casings have been replaced.

1121
01:15:11,626 --> 01:15:12,684
Sir...

1122
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:15,092
According to the prosecution...

1123
01:15:15,297 --> 01:15:17,356
my client is lying...

1124
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:19,867
prime witnesses are lying...

1125
01:15:20,068 --> 01:15:22,730
a government officer is lying...

1126
01:15:23,638 --> 01:15:25,037
then what is the truth?

1127
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,072
That which the evidence
doesn't show?

1128
01:15:33,648 --> 01:15:35,240
When will we get
the bloody judgement?

1129
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:38,950
I need to go for a leak.
- Enough is enough.

1130
01:16:32,974 --> 01:16:35,169
Faith... there it goes again...

1131
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,904
Crushed into bits and pieces...

1132
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:41,915
Trying hard to
hide from itself...

1133
01:16:43,251 --> 01:16:45,913
Faith... beaten and bruised...

1134
01:16:45,987 --> 01:16:48,717
Alive with a false pride...

1135
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:52,783
Like a storm rips through me...

1136
01:16:54,062 --> 01:17:04,199
Faith has brought
my heart to tears...

1137
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:06,730
Faith...

1138
01:17:06,808 --> 01:17:15,216
has brought my
heart to tears...

1139
01:17:26,027 --> 01:17:28,757
Faith, falls prey to fear...

1140
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,230
Splits my heart...

1141
01:17:31,299 --> 01:17:36,293
Grips me with arms open wide...

1142
01:17:37,772 --> 01:17:39,296
Pushes me to the
edge of destruction...

1143
01:17:39,374 --> 01:17:41,899
Pulls me inside out...

1144
01:17:41,977 --> 01:17:48,780
As a vampire sucks me dry...

1145
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,805
Faith, the sprit is dying...

1146
01:18:21,883 --> 01:18:24,818
Memories strewn all around...

1147
01:18:24,886 --> 01:18:29,880
Bereft of any hope...

1148
01:18:30,091 --> 01:18:32,821
Crushed under the feet...

1149
01:18:32,894 --> 01:18:36,830
Of this ever changing world...

1150
01:18:36,898 --> 01:18:40,834
Of hollow shadows...

1151
01:18:40,902 --> 01:18:43,302
Set ablaze and
burnt to ashes...

1152
01:18:43,371 --> 01:18:45,965
Faith... mocked and scorned...

1153
01:18:46,374 --> 01:18:51,243
It crumbles and
rots at night...

1154
01:18:51,312 --> 01:18:53,974
Stripped bare of its soul...

1155
01:18:54,115 --> 01:18:56,845
Like footsteps on water...

1156
01:18:56,918 --> 01:19:02,185
Tosses and turns every night...

1157
01:19:02,257 --> 01:19:06,853
Faith has brought
my heart to tears...

1158
01:19:06,928 --> 01:19:12,457
Faith...

1159
01:19:12,867 --> 01:19:18,271
Faith has brought
my heart to tears...

1160
01:19:18,339 --> 01:19:22,935
Faith...

1161
01:19:23,011 --> 01:19:26,003
There it go again...

1162
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:28,879
Crushed into bits and pieces...

1163
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:33,944
Trying hard to
hide from itself...

1164
01:19:34,155 --> 01:19:36,885
Pushes me to the
edge of destruction...

1165
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:39,290
Pulls me inside out...

1166
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:45,230
As a vampire sucks me dry...

1167
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:24,933
- Didi...

1168
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:26,064
- Coffee.

1169
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:46,017
What the...

1170
01:20:54,235 --> 01:20:56,965
The headline that
morning was a slap in the face.

1171
01:20:57,038 --> 01:20:58,505
It proved me wrong.

1172
01:20:58,706 --> 01:20:59,968
One murder.

1173
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:01,565
300 high profile witnesses.

1174
01:21:01,643 --> 01:21:03,634
'An open and shut case. No story.'

1175
01:21:03,978 --> 01:21:05,036
'But I was wrong.'

1176
01:21:05,647 --> 01:21:06,978
'I felt betrayed.'

1177
01:21:07,048 --> 01:21:08,174
'I felt let down.'

1178
01:21:08,249 --> 01:21:10,979
'It reminded me once again
that Delhi is about power.'

1179
01:21:11,052 --> 01:21:13,987
Power rests in the
hands of powerful people.

1180
01:21:14,055 --> 01:21:15,522
The common man...

1181
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:16,989
Can only grin and bear it.

1182
01:21:17,392 --> 01:21:18,450
This was a fact.

1183
01:21:18,526 --> 01:21:20,050
But I wasn't ready to live with it.

1184
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:29,262
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1185
01:21:30,338 --> 01:21:34,001
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1186
01:21:34,075 --> 01:21:40,207
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1187
01:21:49,891 --> 01:21:53,520
All accused in the Jessica murder
have been exonerated by the court.

1188
01:21:53,661 --> 01:21:54,719
Finally!

1189
01:21:54,796 --> 01:21:57,731
Its not happening.

1190
01:22:15,683 --> 01:22:16,741
Damn it!

1191
01:22:17,752 --> 01:22:21,051
The court has given four main
reasons for exonerating them.

1192
01:22:21,556 --> 01:22:23,046
The most important of which...

1193
01:22:23,157 --> 01:22:27,150
is the volte-face by
the prime witnesses.

1194
01:22:27,428 --> 01:22:30,420
All three witnesses had stated

1195
01:22:30,531 --> 01:22:33,432
That they saw Manish fire.

1196
01:22:33,534 --> 01:22:36,867
But in court they denied...

1197
01:22:37,038 --> 01:22:40,166
Having seen him.

1198
01:22:40,641 --> 01:22:44,543
The court also accepted forensic
expert Kuldeep Singh's report...

1199
01:22:44,645 --> 01:22:47,739
That the pistol she was shot with...
The murder weapon...

1200
01:22:47,849 --> 01:22:50,181
couldn't be produced in court.

1201
01:22:50,485 --> 01:22:52,009
Nor could the police prove that...

1202
01:22:52,086 --> 01:22:55,920
both bullets were fired from the same
gun belonging to Manish Bhardwaj.

1203
01:22:56,057 --> 01:23:00,460
The judge criticised the police
for major lapses in this case and...

1204
01:23:00,528 --> 01:23:03,463
The judge criticised the police
for major lapses in this case and...

1205
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:05,055
also remarked that the
police couldn't piece together...

1206
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:07,464
the sequence of events.

1207
01:23:07,535 --> 01:23:09,093
All of which could have
proved that Jessica was...

1208
01:23:09,203 --> 01:23:11,671
We'd like to remind
our viewers that...

1209
01:23:11,773 --> 01:23:14,469
Manish's father,
Pramod Bhardwaj is a ...

1210
01:23:14,542 --> 01:23:16,100
minister in the
Haryana state cabinet.

1211
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:19,805
Mom, tea is ready.

1212
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:22,540
Mom.

1213
01:23:52,547 --> 01:23:54,174
Mother Goddess, pray for us...
- Say it aloud.

1214
01:23:54,248 --> 01:23:55,840
Mother Goddess!

1215
01:23:55,917 --> 01:23:57,509
Couldn't hear you...
- Mother Goddess!

1216
01:24:04,692 --> 01:24:10,187
Goddess on the lioness!
- Mother Goddess, pray for us.

1217
01:24:15,736 --> 01:24:21,106
Mother Goddess, pray for us.
- Everyone say it aloud.

1218
01:24:24,846 --> 01:24:30,216
I couldn't hear you...
- Mother Goddess, pray for us.

1219
01:24:30,284 --> 01:24:33,549
Say it together.
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1220
01:24:44,732 --> 01:24:49,829
Hail Mother Goddess!
- Mother Goddess, bless us.

1221
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,188
Say it with love!
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1222
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:12,122
The Goddess on the lion!
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1223
01:25:12,193 --> 01:25:14,127
The Goddess residing on the hill.
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1224
01:25:14,195 --> 01:25:15,924
Everyone say it together.
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1225
01:25:15,997 --> 01:25:17,931
- Say it with love.
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1226
01:25:17,999 --> 01:25:19,591
Say it with love.
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1227
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:21,259
Everyone say it together.
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1228
01:25:21,335 --> 01:25:24,327
Hail Mother Goddess!
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1229
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,266
Dad.

1230
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:03,368
Dad.

1231
01:26:04,745 --> 01:26:05,803
No.

1232
01:26:08,382 --> 01:26:10,646
Why? - Because I said so,
Meera. That's why.

1233
01:26:11,752 --> 01:26:12,810
Gaurav.

1234
01:26:24,031 --> 01:26:26,727
Gaurav. No!

1235
01:26:29,237 --> 01:26:30,295
No!

1236
01:26:43,951 --> 01:26:48,081
Have you lost it? Move. Move.

1237
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:51,420
Ok, I'm not good at saying sorry,
but I am saying it.

1238
01:26:51,826 --> 01:26:52,884
I want to do this.

1239
01:26:52,994 --> 01:26:54,154
Perhaps you didn't
understand earlier...

1240
01:26:54,228 --> 01:26:55,286
so let me spell this out for you.

1241
01:26:55,696 --> 01:26:57,789
N. O.
- F. O.

1242
01:26:58,366 --> 01:26:59,697
You said that when
you thought this was...

1243
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:01,359
an open-and-shut case, celebrity.

1244
01:27:01,435 --> 01:27:02,770
What's changed?

1245
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:04,761
Because he got away with it, dammit.
He shouldn't have.

1246
01:27:04,872 --> 01:27:07,705
That scum bug should be in jail
and not at the next happening party.

1247
01:27:08,142 --> 01:27:10,702
He shot her, you know it, I know it.

1248
01:27:10,778 --> 01:27:13,212
300 witnesses know it and
half of this country knows it.

1249
01:27:13,314 --> 01:27:15,839
And he still got away with it.
- And no one gives a damn, Meera.

1250
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:17,247
There is no story!

1251
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,250
The court has
pronounced 'The End'! So...

1252
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,378
Goodnight. See you.

1253
01:27:23,324 --> 01:27:25,451
Don't be an idiot.
I want to do this.

1254
01:27:25,726 --> 01:27:28,456
But why?
- Because justice has been denied.

1255
01:27:28,829 --> 01:27:30,387
You can live with it, I will not.

1256
01:27:30,464 --> 01:27:32,830
This is activism not journalism.
Okay?

1257
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:36,265
We are supposed to
provide news and opinions.

1258
01:27:36,337 --> 01:27:37,395
Not deliver justice.

1259
01:27:37,471 --> 01:27:38,733
Come on, Gaurav.

1260
01:27:38,873 --> 01:27:40,738
We often create news...

1261
01:27:40,808 --> 01:27:42,275
to spruce up our profile.

1262
01:27:42,476 --> 01:27:44,740
We don't think about
what is right or wrong.

1263
01:27:44,812 --> 01:27:46,404
Let's face it. You have done it.
I have done it.

1264
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:47,811
All of us have done it.

1265
01:27:48,115 --> 01:27:51,050
But here's a chance
to make things right.

1266
01:27:51,152 --> 01:27:53,177
Or at least, to make an effort.

1267
01:27:54,322 --> 01:27:56,950
Come on, Gaurav. We owe it
to ourselves as journalists.

1268
01:27:57,124 --> 01:27:59,251
And more importantly
as human beings.

1269
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,850
Stop being so dramatic, Meera.

1270
01:28:02,096 --> 01:28:03,358
I'm not being dramatic.

1271
01:28:03,998 --> 01:28:06,296
But now I think we need dramatics.

1272
01:28:07,768 --> 01:28:08,826
So here it is.

1273
01:28:09,503 --> 01:28:11,368
Either you let me do this story...

1274
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:13,063
or else, fire me.

1275
01:28:16,177 --> 01:28:17,769
Get your 50 kilos off my car.
- 49...

1276
01:28:17,845 --> 01:28:21,781
Get off.
- So you are not firing me.

1277
01:28:21,849 --> 01:28:23,339
There's nothing we can do now.

1278
01:28:26,954 --> 01:28:28,012
Actually, we can.

1279
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:30,516
I have an idea.

1280
01:28:33,227 --> 01:28:36,355
Sometimes you...
- Act like a sweetheart.

1281
01:28:45,906 --> 01:28:46,964
Hello?

1282
01:28:47,074 --> 01:28:48,132
Aditi, it's Meera.

1283
01:28:48,242 --> 01:28:49,903
- Can you come over?
- Now?

1284
01:28:50,177 --> 01:28:52,042
No, perhaps when you
have time to spare.

1285
01:28:53,047 --> 01:28:55,015
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.

1286
01:28:55,082 --> 01:28:56,845
Hello! I was just being sarcastic.

1287
01:28:56,984 --> 01:28:58,815
Wake up and smell the coffee, girl.

1288
01:29:00,821 --> 01:29:03,847
You're not in a nine
to five government job.

1289
01:29:04,825 --> 01:29:07,089
This is the world of television
news and I want you here right now.

1290
01:29:07,561 --> 01:29:10,029
I'm sorry, Meera. I'll just leave.

1291
01:29:10,164 --> 01:29:12,860
Good. Grab a tissue
and wipe those tears.

1292
01:29:12,933 --> 01:29:15,458
I'm about to make you famous.
- What!

1293
01:29:15,569 --> 01:29:19,835
I remember what you said
before the IC-814 hijack.

1294
01:29:20,441 --> 01:29:21,499
What?

1295
01:29:21,575 --> 01:29:23,839
That witnesses were
influenced in the Jessica case.

1296
01:29:23,978 --> 01:29:25,570
I think we should pursue the story.

1297
01:29:26,514 --> 01:29:27,947
Let's nail that rogue.

1298
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:32,847
He is a model and an actor, right?

1299
01:29:33,287 --> 01:29:35,255
Yes, but why?

1300
01:29:38,993 --> 01:29:41,962
This whole style is sensationalistic.
It's just dead wrong.

1301
01:29:42,062 --> 01:29:43,393
Why do you always say 'no'?

1302
01:29:43,464 --> 01:29:44,522
Is that your favourite word?

1303
01:29:44,598 --> 01:29:46,532
Meera, this is against
journalistic ethics.

1304
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,862
Forget ethics, Gaurav.

1305
01:29:47,968 --> 01:29:49,367
What do our ethics say?

1306
01:29:49,937 --> 01:29:51,370
That we should cover our eyes.

1307
01:29:51,472 --> 01:29:52,871
If it's wrong, we should ignore it.

1308
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,135
To turn a blind eye.
and sleep peacefully!

1309
01:29:55,242 --> 01:29:56,869
No, but they don't endorse this.

1310
01:29:56,944 --> 01:29:59,913
What do I want to do? Kill someone?

1311
01:30:00,247 --> 01:30:02,408
I only want to bring forth
the truth.

1312
01:30:02,883 --> 01:30:03,941
In my own way.

1313
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:06,110
Who decides if your
way is right or wrong?

1314
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,085
Do it.
- What?

1315
01:30:08,889 --> 01:30:12,325
For the sake of
justice and truth, go ahead.

1316
01:30:15,629 --> 01:30:16,891
Thank you, sir.

1317
01:30:25,272 --> 01:30:27,331
Hello?
- Hello...

1318
01:30:27,641 --> 01:30:30,337
Hi, this is Aditi from
Future Films, Mumbai.

1319
01:30:30,444 --> 01:30:32,275
May I speak with Vikram, please?

1320
01:30:32,646 --> 01:30:33,908
About what?

1321
01:30:34,014 --> 01:30:36,278
It's regarding
the casting of a film.

1322
01:30:36,383 --> 01:30:38,408
Oh, just hold on a second!

1323
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,578
Vikram?

1324
01:30:40,654 --> 01:30:43,248
There's a call for you from Mumbai.

1325
01:30:43,357 --> 01:30:44,415
Just a minute.
- Come.

1326
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:52,922
Hello! - Hi! Is that Vikram?
- Ya.

1327
01:30:54,034 --> 01:30:55,934
Who's calling? - Vikram,
I am calling from Future Films...

1328
01:30:56,003 --> 01:30:57,664
regarding our next film.

1329
01:30:57,938 --> 01:31:01,135
So this story is about
two guys and two girls...

1330
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:02,937
set in Delhi university.
- Okay.

1331
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:06,944
And these two guys have...
- I think I have seen you somewhere...

1332
01:31:12,953 --> 01:31:14,477
I can't remember where, but I have...

1333
01:31:15,956 --> 01:31:17,014
Really?

1334
01:31:39,346 --> 01:31:40,973
Tell him, 'don't try this on me'.

1335
01:31:42,716 --> 01:31:44,479
Don't try that on me.

1336
01:31:44,585 --> 01:31:45,711
You little flirt.

1337
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,487
No, I'm being serious here.

1338
01:31:47,555 --> 01:31:49,648
Serious? Okay, anyway...

1339
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:52,254
Seriously, let's talk about work?

1340
01:31:52,359 --> 01:31:53,417
Yes.

1341
01:31:53,527 --> 01:31:56,189
Oh sorry! This is Michele.
- Hi, Michele! - Hello!

1342
01:31:56,263 --> 01:31:57,321
She's gonna be famous.

1343
01:31:57,998 --> 01:32:00,023
Ok, now the film is bilingual.

1344
01:32:00,134 --> 01:32:01,999
What languages do you speak?

1345
01:32:02,369 --> 01:32:05,998
I speak English, Hindi, Bengali...

1346
01:32:06,307 --> 01:32:09,276
This film is in English and Hindi.

1347
01:32:09,376 --> 01:32:11,037
What's his Hindi like?

1348
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:13,238
It's fine. Absolutely fine.

1349
01:32:13,314 --> 01:32:15,373
In fact I am shooting for
a Hindi film next month.

1350
01:32:15,683 --> 01:32:19,016
And I auditioned for it. The script
was given to me in Hindi...

1351
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:20,279
and I got the part.

1352
01:32:21,088 --> 01:32:22,555
Tell him, you don't want his biodata.

1353
01:32:23,157 --> 01:32:24,385
Tell him to speak in Hindi.

1354
01:32:24,758 --> 01:32:28,194
Could you speak to us in
Hindi for about two minutes?

1355
01:32:28,662 --> 01:32:30,459
What do you want me to say?

1356
01:32:30,531 --> 01:32:31,589
Why don't you tell me...

1357
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:35,362
Would you? I want to hear the
shape of your voice. Speak to me.

1358
01:32:35,469 --> 01:32:37,699
I'm wondering... what do I say...

1359
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:39,295
You could say anything...

1360
01:32:39,406 --> 01:32:41,135
that could assure her.

1361
01:32:43,043 --> 01:32:44,101
I've come...

1362
01:32:44,178 --> 01:32:46,043
a long way to meet you.

1363
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:50,043
And I hope, I can
shoot this film with you.

1364
01:32:50,517 --> 01:32:52,314
Shooting's already begun, handsome!

1365
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:56,082
Give us some more...
- Some more?

1366
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:58,055
Yes. Anything.

1367
01:33:01,261 --> 01:33:02,319
That dumb...

1368
01:33:04,732 --> 01:33:06,256
Tell him to deliver
a movie dialogue.

1369
01:33:07,067 --> 01:33:08,557
Give us a dialogue from a movie.

1370
01:33:08,669 --> 01:33:09,727
I don't remember dialogues.

1371
01:33:09,803 --> 01:33:13,068
But, since you're talking
about Hindi, I can tell you this.

1372
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,801
Hindi and Bengali have...

1373
01:33:15,109 --> 01:33:16,167
one major difference.

1374
01:33:16,276 --> 01:33:17,709
Okay.
- What's with the 'okay', Aditi?

1375
01:33:18,178 --> 01:33:20,237
Let him show off his Hindi skills.

1376
01:33:20,414 --> 01:33:21,472
What?

1377
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:22,707
What...

1378
01:33:22,783 --> 01:33:24,444
what's the major difference?
- Well...

1379
01:33:25,085 --> 01:33:27,679
in Bengali there is no sex.
- What?

1380
01:33:27,788 --> 01:33:32,122
There is no sex.
I mean, there is no gender.

1381
01:33:32,326 --> 01:33:35,625
In Hindi you would say,
he comes or she comes...

1382
01:33:35,696 --> 01:33:36,754
but in Bengali...

1383
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:38,730
it's 'he comes' for both genders.

1384
01:33:38,832 --> 01:33:41,164
Oh, so in Hindi 'she comes'...

1385
01:33:41,235 --> 01:33:43,533
But, in Bengali it
would be 'it comes'.

1386
01:33:43,637 --> 01:33:46,105
That's interesting.
I didn't know that.

1387
01:33:46,273 --> 01:33:47,331
Doesn't know Hindi?!

1388
01:33:48,108 --> 01:33:49,200
He can give tuitions in Hindi.

1389
01:33:49,443 --> 01:33:50,501
What are the projects...

1390
01:33:50,577 --> 01:33:51,635
Aditi...

1391
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:53,110
get up and slap him.

1392
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,647
Interesting projects...

1393
01:33:54,715 --> 01:33:55,773
I said, slap him.

1394
01:33:55,849 --> 01:33:57,248
These are really nice pictures.

1395
01:33:57,317 --> 01:33:58,375
Those are my most recent pictures.

1396
01:33:58,452 --> 01:33:59,510
You are looking
really good in this.

1397
01:33:59,586 --> 01:34:01,110
And if you...

1398
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:05,853
Just joking. Continue.

1399
01:34:07,127 --> 01:34:10,619
Are you okay?
- Ya. Are you?

1400
01:34:11,165 --> 01:34:15,431
Apple anyone? No? Sure?

1401
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:22,675
Thanks. You can just go through his
pictures and see the ones you like.

1402
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:26,138
Oh... I haven't told her...

1403
01:34:26,246 --> 01:34:29,147
and I don't think I need to, but...

1404
01:34:29,216 --> 01:34:31,582
would you have a visa problem?

1405
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:33,277
Visa? No, why?

1406
01:34:33,353 --> 01:34:37,585
No, in case we decide to
shoot some portions abroad...

1407
01:34:37,658 --> 01:34:39,626
- I meant, due to the case.

1408
01:34:41,361 --> 01:34:42,419
No.

1409
01:34:43,163 --> 01:34:44,221
- No.

1410
01:34:44,398 --> 01:34:46,161
Manish had fired the bullet.

1411
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,297
The whole world knows it.

1412
01:34:48,402 --> 01:34:49,892
Then why doesn't the
world do something about it?

1413
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:52,899
Nobody can do a damn thing!

1414
01:34:57,411 --> 01:34:58,901
You mean Pramod Bhardwaj?

1415
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,347
Look, all these guys...
the whole gang...

1416
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:05,476
No one can touch them.

1417
01:35:05,919 --> 01:35:07,181
Weren't you there as well?

1418
01:35:13,393 --> 01:35:15,623
If you had to choose between
ten million rupees and a bullet.

1419
01:35:16,563 --> 01:35:17,860
What would you do?

1420
01:35:19,433 --> 01:35:20,695
Not an easy choice.

1421
01:35:22,536 --> 01:35:23,594
No, it's not.

1422
01:35:25,372 --> 01:35:26,634
I don't want ten million.

1423
01:35:28,475 --> 01:35:30,238
But I don't want a bullet either.

1424
01:35:34,648 --> 01:35:36,206
So can we talk about the film now?

1425
01:35:38,218 --> 01:35:39,276
What is truth?

1426
01:35:39,353 --> 01:35:41,218
Only what can be proved?

1427
01:35:41,288 --> 01:35:42,448
Or the truth itself?

1428
01:35:42,823 --> 01:35:44,222
This and many other questions...

1429
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:46,225
have arisen In the...

1430
01:35:46,293 --> 01:35:48,261
Jessica murder case.

1431
01:35:48,462 --> 01:35:50,259
Was justice served?

1432
01:35:50,464 --> 01:35:51,522
What's the reason...

1433
01:35:51,632 --> 01:35:53,224
that one by one,
the prime witnesses...

1434
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,359
retracted their statements?

1435
01:35:55,736 --> 01:35:58,500
While all the evidence
seemed to aide the accused.

1436
01:36:33,807 --> 01:36:34,865
Hey, speak!

1437
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,343
As I was saying...

1438
01:36:41,949 --> 01:36:43,541
Hey, it still sounds like
Meera on TV.

1439
01:36:44,818 --> 01:36:46,342
Oh!
- Bring down the aggression.

1440
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:48,287
Now that's difficult to control.

1441
01:36:48,422 --> 01:36:49,480
Ok, we will go again.

1442
01:36:51,825 --> 01:36:52,883
Hello?

1443
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,951
It's Sabrina, Shankar.

1444
01:36:55,495 --> 01:36:56,962
Please accept my sympathy.

1445
01:36:58,832 --> 01:37:00,026
But I can't help you.

1446
01:37:01,635 --> 01:37:02,693
Try to understand.

1447
01:37:02,903 --> 01:37:04,370
Why are you so scared?

1448
01:37:04,838 --> 01:37:06,032
It's natural, madam.

1449
01:37:06,974 --> 01:37:08,441
Who is threatening you?

1450
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,037
I can't spell out the details.

1451
01:37:11,645 --> 01:37:13,374
You're smart enough to understand.

1452
01:37:15,816 --> 01:37:17,340
- Sir...
- Yes, I'm watching it.

1453
01:37:17,417 --> 01:37:18,782
What happened that night?

1454
01:37:19,519 --> 01:37:21,316
Everybody knows what happened.

1455
01:37:21,655 --> 01:37:24,522
You were there, Shankar,
but I wasn't.

1456
01:37:25,325 --> 01:37:26,383
But so were 300 other people.

1457
01:37:26,927 --> 01:37:28,326
They couldn't do a thing.

1458
01:37:28,662 --> 01:37:30,926
And I'm just a lowly waiter.

1459
01:37:30,998 --> 01:37:32,056
What did you see?

1460
01:37:32,866 --> 01:37:34,527
I said everything in my statement.

1461
01:37:35,936 --> 01:37:38,336
Was the police so
incapable and helpless...

1462
01:37:38,405 --> 01:37:41,374
that they couldn't prove an
open-and-shut case in court?

1463
01:37:41,942 --> 01:37:44,467
Was money and power
used to influence justice?

1464
01:37:48,015 --> 01:37:49,073
It was a bidding war.

1465
01:37:50,918 --> 01:37:52,351
Both sides were ready to give.

1466
01:37:52,686 --> 01:37:53,846
And I readily accepted.

1467
01:37:54,888 --> 01:37:58,483
One side dangled a lot
more and I sang their tune.

1468
01:37:58,692 --> 01:37:59,989
What are you saying! Really?

1469
01:38:00,694 --> 01:38:01,752
I swear.

1470
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:05,489
Can justice be auctioned?

1471
01:38:20,047 --> 01:38:23,414
Dad, I'm not stressed out.
Just seems like that on TV.

1472
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:25,441
I'm not lying, dad.

1473
01:38:25,919 --> 01:38:26,977
Promila?

1474
01:38:29,723 --> 01:38:31,384
Dad, I can look after myself.

1475
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:36,122
I can stay alone. Please. Promila.

1476
01:38:38,398 --> 01:38:39,797
Promila.

1477
01:38:39,933 --> 01:38:40,991
Dad. Dad, I'll just
call you back. Promila.

1478
01:38:44,471 --> 01:38:45,529
Promila.

1479
01:38:56,616 --> 01:38:57,674
What is it?

1480
01:38:57,751 --> 01:38:58,877
What's wrong, didi?

1481
01:38:59,486 --> 01:39:00,544
Nothing.

1482
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,417
There's someone at the door,
I'll take a look.

1483
01:39:03,156 --> 01:39:04,418
Go, make some coffee.

1484
01:39:08,628 --> 01:39:09,686
Skank!

1485
01:39:10,497 --> 01:39:12,556
I heard that. Go, make some coffee.

1486
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:51,528
Let's go back.

1487
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:55,474
- I was ready to pay
a thousand bucks.

1488
01:39:57,010 --> 01:39:58,534
- But she refused to
give me a drink.

1489
01:39:59,813 --> 01:40:02,475
- Sir, I wanted to fire
two inches from her ear.

1490
01:40:05,218 --> 01:40:06,480
- You wear spectacles, right?

1491
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:08,078
- Yes, sir.

1492
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:11,148
- Did you wear them that night?

1493
01:40:12,559 --> 01:40:13,617
- No, sir.

1494
01:40:13,693 --> 01:40:15,786
This is explosive.
- What do you mean 'explosive'?

1495
01:40:16,029 --> 01:40:18,054
It's damn explosive.

1496
01:40:18,565 --> 01:40:22,661
You have seen the witnesses
admitting that they lied in court.

1497
01:40:22,736 --> 01:40:26,570
What was the truth they
were forced not to divulge?

1498
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,535
You can now hear the truth.

1499
01:40:28,842 --> 01:40:30,571
Straight from the horse's mouth.

1500
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:33,508
This is what Manish
Bhardwaj had to say...

1501
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:35,741
when the police
questioned him about that night.

1502
01:40:37,117 --> 01:40:38,675
- Sir, I was furious.

1503
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,646
- I was ready to pay
a thousand bucks.

1504
01:40:44,057 --> 01:40:45,718
- But she refused to give me
a drink.

1505
01:40:47,194 --> 01:40:49,958
- Sir, I wanted to fire
two inches from her ear.

1506
01:40:50,597 --> 01:40:51,757
- You wear spectacles, right?

1507
01:40:52,799 --> 01:40:53,857
- Yes, sir.

1508
01:40:54,201 --> 01:40:55,259
- Did you wear them that night?

1509
01:40:57,537 --> 01:40:58,595
- No, sir.

1510
01:40:58,672 --> 01:41:02,130
- Two inches from her ear?

1511
01:41:04,077 --> 01:41:06,272
- Sir, then an old woman came in.

1512
01:41:07,881 --> 01:41:10,679
She screamed...
Why did you shoot her?

1513
01:41:12,152 --> 01:41:13,278
Sir... then I fled from there.

1514
01:41:15,088 --> 01:41:18,023
- I took a ride on a scooter.

1515
01:41:19,159 --> 01:41:22,128
- Sir, there was
a field behind the motel.

1516
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:28,566
- Sir, I was terrified.

1517
01:41:29,236 --> 01:41:32,296
Are we supposed to
ignore this bitter truth?

1518
01:41:32,906 --> 01:41:34,703
Sabrina...
- Dear...

1519
01:41:34,774 --> 01:41:36,639
can you increase the volume...

1520
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:40,111
a little bit.

1521
01:41:44,918 --> 01:41:47,648
Let it go, dad. Forget it.
It's over.

1522
01:41:47,721 --> 01:41:48,949
No, it's not over.

1523
01:41:49,589 --> 01:41:51,580
This case has raised questions for...

1524
01:41:51,658 --> 01:41:53,853
the police, the government,
the legal system.

1525
01:41:53,927 --> 01:41:56,657
And we demand answers.

1526
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:59,956
We believe that justice wasn't
delivered in the Jessica case.

1527
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,667
Justice was denied.

1528
01:42:01,868 --> 01:42:04,598
We think that money and power were
instrumental in burying the truth...

1529
01:42:04,671 --> 01:42:07,606
and tampering with the evidence.

1530
01:42:07,941 --> 01:42:10,603
We think the police failed
miserably in doing their duty.

1531
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,605
And in producing the
evidence in court.

1532
01:42:13,213 --> 01:42:16,614
We strongly believe this
case deserves to be reopened.

1533
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:18,349
Justice should prevail.

1534
01:42:18,885 --> 01:42:21,683
'Justice for Jessica' is our
initiative to demand justice.

1535
01:42:21,955 --> 01:42:23,855
For Jessica, her family

1536
01:42:24,157 --> 01:42:25,351
and all of us.

1537
01:42:25,692 --> 01:42:27,819
If you think justice was denied...

1538
01:42:27,894 --> 01:42:32,354
type 'Justice for Jessica' on
your phone and text it to 6-6-8-8.

1539
01:42:43,643 --> 01:42:45,702
Yes. Thanks.

1540
01:42:46,846 --> 01:42:49,371
Meera.
- Speak.

1541
01:42:49,649 --> 01:42:52,641
We have received a thousand texts
and calls in 20 minutes. - What?

1542
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:54,186
Yeah, the phone lines are jammed.

1543
01:42:54,254 --> 01:42:55,380
We are getting so many calls.

1544
01:42:55,722 --> 01:42:57,212
You have to go live in 90 seconds.

1545
01:42:59,092 --> 01:43:00,389
What! 90 seconds?

1546
01:43:00,727 --> 01:43:02,126
Come on, then...
What are you doing here?

1547
01:43:02,195 --> 01:43:03,389
Meera, your skirt...
- I don't need it.

1548
01:43:06,266 --> 01:43:08,257
Ya.

1549
01:43:08,335 --> 01:43:11,327
We're getting calls from all over...
Calcutta, Hyderabad, Gwalior...

1550
01:43:11,404 --> 01:43:12,735
Come on, guys. Move. Move. Move.

1551
01:43:12,806 --> 01:43:17,402
Meera, you have to take a few.
- Going in 15...

1552
01:43:17,744 --> 01:43:22,078
10. 9. 8. 7.

1553
01:43:22,148 --> 01:43:28,678
6. 5. 4. 3. 2.

1554
01:43:28,755 --> 01:43:31,883
Ok, guys, go.
- 1. Go.

1555
01:43:33,693 --> 01:43:35,422
I think justice was denied.

1556
01:43:36,229 --> 01:43:40,825
Police, government, law and
order are mere words in our country.

1557
01:43:41,701 --> 01:43:42,759
I have a daughter too.

1558
01:43:42,836 --> 01:43:45,430
If they can go scot free,
anyone else can.

1559
01:43:45,772 --> 01:43:47,763
Money and power can't
buy everything.

1560
01:43:47,841 --> 01:43:50,935
No. I want justice for Justice.

1561
01:43:51,011 --> 01:43:56,347
Mumbai too is furious with the
verdict. What do you have to say?

1562
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:59,010
Whether it's Delhi or Mumbai,
people will be furious.

1563
01:43:59,085 --> 01:44:01,246
He has confessed to his crime.

1564
01:44:01,321 --> 01:44:02,913
Then why isn't he punished?

1565
01:44:03,256 --> 01:44:04,848
This is a matter of law and order.

1566
01:44:04,924 --> 01:44:08,951
The common man will either
go to the police or the court.

1567
01:44:09,029 --> 01:44:11,395
And if they are not just,
where do we go?

1568
01:44:11,464 --> 01:44:12,726
It's true.

1569
01:44:12,799 --> 01:44:15,927
It's quite scary and
even more so for women.

1570
01:44:16,002 --> 01:44:19,802
I feel I have been denied justice.
I feel very angry.

1571
01:45:08,388 --> 01:45:10,083
We want justice. We want justice.

1572
01:45:10,156 --> 01:45:11,783
We want justice. We want justice.

1573
01:45:11,858 --> 01:45:13,325
Justice for Jessica!

1574
01:45:13,393 --> 01:45:16,328
Justice for Jessica!

1575
01:45:16,396 --> 01:45:17,988
Justice for Jessica!

1576
01:45:20,333 --> 01:45:24,360
We have with us retired Chief
Justice of India, C. N. More.

1577
01:45:25,405 --> 01:45:26,463
Sir...

1578
01:45:26,539 --> 01:45:27,801
the public is angry...

1579
01:45:27,941 --> 01:45:30,034
with the police, the government...

1580
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:31,168
with the legal system.

1581
01:45:31,478 --> 01:45:33,469
Well, you see, our legal system...

1582
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,940
- was created by
the British in 1860.

1583
01:45:37,417 --> 01:45:39,214
- And we are
following it to this day.

1584
01:45:39,285 --> 01:45:40,877
This circus is still going on?

1585
01:45:40,954 --> 01:45:42,945
In those times criminals used
to commit a crime and flee on...

1586
01:45:43,022 --> 01:45:44,956
a bullock-cart or a horse-cart.
- I don't believe this.

1587
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,558
- Things are different today.

1588
01:45:47,894 --> 01:45:49,384
- We have progressed.

1589
01:45:50,363 --> 01:45:51,421
What's with you?

1590
01:45:51,898 --> 01:45:54,492
- Unless we overhaul
our legal system...

1591
01:45:54,901 --> 01:45:56,095
these things will continue.

1592
01:45:56,903 --> 01:45:58,837
And those who can misuse it...

1593
01:45:58,905 --> 01:46:00,065
will continue doing so.

1594
01:46:00,507 --> 01:46:01,565
Yes, sir.

1595
01:46:02,442 --> 01:46:03,500
Yes, just a minute.

1596
01:46:04,177 --> 01:46:05,235
Yes, I'm giving it to him.

1597
01:46:05,311 --> 01:46:06,505
Sir, it's the Chief Minister.

1598
01:46:11,184 --> 01:46:12,242
Yes, sir?

1599
01:46:12,986 --> 01:46:14,510
Public anger is at boiling point.

1600
01:46:15,321 --> 01:46:16,447
We can't afford to take this risk.

1601
01:46:17,524 --> 01:46:18,889
The high command is
of the same opinion.

1602
01:46:20,059 --> 01:46:22,584
Moreover, it's affecting
the image of the party.

1603
01:46:22,996 --> 01:46:24,054
Sir...

1604
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:25,589
trust me.

1605
01:46:27,066 --> 01:46:28,465
It's just a gentle breeze...

1606
01:46:28,535 --> 01:46:29,866
and it will pass.

1607
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:31,869
It seems more like a storm...

1608
01:46:33,206 --> 01:46:34,537
that will destroy all of us.

1609
01:46:36,009 --> 01:46:39,445
Sir, at least you should trust...

1610
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:50,417
Do whatever it takes,
but save my Monu.

1611
01:46:59,165 --> 01:47:00,894
All of us know who is responsible.

1612
01:47:00,967 --> 01:47:02,127
Everyone knows this.

1613
01:47:02,202 --> 01:47:05,035
The government may be mute,
but we aren't!

1614
01:47:05,104 --> 01:47:07,937
We have to do something,
we can't remain inside our homes.

1615
01:47:08,007 --> 01:47:09,975
They got away
with Jessica's murder.

1616
01:47:10,043 --> 01:47:11,977
Someday they'll get away
with raping one of us.

1617
01:47:12,245 --> 01:47:13,974
Just because they have power
and money they can do anything?

1618
01:47:14,247 --> 01:47:17,944
No. We want justice for Jessica.
I want justice for Jessica.

1619
01:47:18,017 --> 01:47:20,986
We all want justice for Jessica.
- Justice for Jessica!

1620
01:47:21,054 --> 01:47:23,454
Justice for Jessica.

1621
01:47:23,523 --> 01:47:24,922
Justice for Jessica.

1622
01:47:24,991 --> 01:47:27,482
Meera, the 'Middle-Finger-Protest'
from Chandigarh is online.

1623
01:47:27,927 --> 01:47:30,657
Middle finger? Pass them through.

1624
01:47:31,998 --> 01:47:33,056
Terrific name!

1625
01:47:33,132 --> 01:47:35,191
My friend and I, thought
it would blow everyone away.

1626
01:47:35,268 --> 01:47:36,326
It's unbelievable!

1627
01:47:36,402 --> 01:47:38,267
We are 15 in all and
in one voice we say:

1628
01:47:38,338 --> 01:47:39,396
Justice for...

1629
01:47:39,472 --> 01:47:40,530
Justice for...

1630
01:47:40,607 --> 01:47:41,938
No, no! Justice for...

1631
01:47:42,008 --> 01:47:43,066
Justice for...

1632
01:47:43,142 --> 01:47:44,200
No! Justice for?

1633
01:47:44,277 --> 01:47:45,335
Justice for...

1634
01:47:45,411 --> 01:47:47,675
I'll say it myself,
Justice for Jessica.

1635
01:47:48,281 --> 01:47:51,079
The legal system and
police are helpless.

1636
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:53,141
Why weren't the witnesses protected?

1637
01:47:53,219 --> 01:47:56,985
Every democracy
needs witness protection.

1638
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,956
To safeguard justice and victims.

1639
01:47:59,292 --> 01:48:02,693
Or witnesses will
continue to be threatened.

1640
01:48:11,037 --> 01:48:12,231
- 6-6...

1641
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,005
- 8-8...

1642
01:48:15,508 --> 01:48:16,566
Did it go through?

1643
01:48:18,578 --> 01:48:21,046
- Yes, it did.
- Thank you.

1644
01:48:21,314 --> 01:48:24,715
Just don't tell Sabrina,
she might get angry.

1645
01:48:24,984 --> 01:48:26,042
I won't tell her.

1646
01:48:26,119 --> 01:48:29,054
Justice for Jessica!

1647
01:48:29,122 --> 01:48:31,989
Justice for Jessica!

1648
01:48:32,058 --> 01:48:34,993
Jessica. Jessica.
Justice for Jessica!

1649
01:48:35,061 --> 01:48:37,120
Jessica. Jessica.
Justice for Jessica!

1650
01:48:37,196 --> 01:48:39,994
Mr. Shyam Tolani,
can you see the public's ire?

1651
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,000
The truth was disguised as
a lie and presented in court.

1652
01:48:43,469 --> 01:48:44,731
And the guilty were set free.

1653
01:48:45,338 --> 01:48:46,498
Who is guilty...

1654
01:48:47,073 --> 01:48:48,301
who is innocent?

1655
01:48:48,675 --> 01:48:52,167
What gives you, the media,
the right to decide this?

1656
01:48:53,079 --> 01:48:55,741
The correct decision
is given by the court.

1657
01:48:56,082 --> 01:48:57,515
And the court has done that.

1658
01:48:57,584 --> 01:49:00,212
The decision itself was wrong,
Mr. Shyam Tolani.

1659
01:49:01,087 --> 01:49:02,145
Why?

1660
01:49:02,355 --> 01:49:05,620
Just because you think so?

1661
01:49:06,025 --> 01:49:10,359
The evidence... the witnesses...
mean nothing to you?

1662
01:49:11,598 --> 01:49:17,036
You have tarnished the judicial
system of this great country.

1663
01:49:17,103 --> 01:49:18,161
But sir...

1664
01:49:18,371 --> 01:49:20,532
people go to the court for justice.

1665
01:49:20,607 --> 01:49:23,770
And who decides whether or not,
justice was delivered?

1666
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:25,168
You?

1667
01:49:25,244 --> 01:49:26,506
The media?

1668
01:49:37,056 --> 01:49:38,114
Hello!

1669
01:50:01,814 --> 01:50:04,146
Ma'am. You can't park here. Ma'am.

1670
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:07,075
Where do I park? Do it yourself.
- Ma'am.

1671
01:50:19,165 --> 01:50:23,363
What?

1672
01:50:23,436 --> 01:50:26,234
The High Court will issue
this press release tomorrow.

1673
01:50:26,305 --> 01:50:28,773
They are issuing a 'suo
moto' notice to the police.

1674
01:50:28,841 --> 01:50:32,106
Seeking an explanation for
why the accused were set free.

1675
01:50:32,178 --> 01:50:34,840
You're sure?
- You want to bet on it?

1676
01:50:35,181 --> 01:50:39,777
Wow, this is a major development.

1677
01:50:41,187 --> 01:50:42,779
Sir...

1678
01:50:42,855 --> 01:50:44,152
Listen...

1679
01:50:44,223 --> 01:50:46,783
listen...

1680
01:50:47,326 --> 01:50:50,124
We will reply to the
High Court notice.

1681
01:50:50,196 --> 01:50:51,857
Sir...
- But sir...

1682
01:50:52,131 --> 01:50:53,189
Please!

1683
01:50:53,266 --> 01:50:55,131
We are appealing in
the High Court against ...

1684
01:50:55,201 --> 01:50:57,396
the decision of the lower court.

1685
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:58,528
- Ma'am...
- Sir...

1686
01:50:58,604 --> 01:51:00,128
Sir, I have a question.

1687
01:51:00,473 --> 01:51:02,441
What if the High Court
dismisses the appeal?

1688
01:51:05,411 --> 01:51:09,142
I hope this
investigation does not bury us.

1689
01:51:09,749 --> 01:51:11,148
Don't worry.

1690
01:51:12,218 --> 01:51:15,551
Public memory is very short.
And we will take care of the rest.

1691
01:51:16,489 --> 01:51:20,687
- A martyr's grave is always fresh.

1692
01:51:22,228 --> 01:51:24,696
- We also know how to
turn martyrs into villains.

1693
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,017
- Call Sabrina,
we need her reaction. - Okay.

1694
01:53:36,629 --> 01:53:38,790
What is it?

1695
01:53:39,832 --> 01:53:41,766
I received this text
a few minutes ago.

1696
01:53:43,569 --> 01:53:46,333
Candlelight march for Jessica,
India Gate...

1697
01:53:46,839 --> 01:53:49,307
5th February, 5 o'clock.

1698
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:52,309
Day after tomorrow at five p.m.

1699
01:53:53,379 --> 01:53:55,313
I will be there. Will you?

1700
01:53:55,848 --> 01:53:58,316
We were so high, man...

1701
01:53:58,384 --> 01:53:59,976
and we got him to spend everything.

1702
01:54:00,586 --> 01:54:03,521
- Think about it.
- Why do you idiots drink so much?

1703
01:54:04,323 --> 01:54:05,381
That's a new text.

1704
01:54:05,858 --> 01:54:07,052
New text message.

1705
01:54:10,863 --> 01:54:11,921
What's this?

1706
01:54:12,665 --> 01:54:15,930
Candlelight for Jessica,
India Gate, five p.m.

1707
01:54:16,002 --> 01:54:17,367
I got it too.

1708
01:54:17,436 --> 01:54:20,701
Isn't she the girl who
got shot at a party?

1709
01:54:21,407 --> 01:54:23,398
- It's sad. - Should we go?

1710
01:54:40,359 --> 01:54:42,793
She is very upset,
doesn't want to speak to anyone.

1711
01:54:42,862 --> 01:54:44,056
Try again, I'll talk to her.

1712
01:55:46,625 --> 01:55:48,422
The entire country
is fighting for you...

1713
01:55:48,494 --> 01:55:49,620
and now you don't want to fight?

1714
01:55:50,563 --> 01:55:51,621
No.

1715
01:55:51,697 --> 01:55:52,755
Why not?

1716
01:55:53,165 --> 01:55:57,795
Because I already know what you
showed and what the public saw on TV.

1717
01:55:58,504 --> 01:56:00,597
I screamed myself hoarse
but nothing came of it.

1718
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,431
The police and the
legal system did not help.

1719
01:56:03,843 --> 01:56:05,435
Nor can you do anything now!

1720
01:56:06,045 --> 01:56:08,707
I don't want to go through
this all over again, I'm fed up.

1721
01:56:09,682 --> 01:56:11,479
My sister was murdered and
then my mom passed away.

1722
01:56:11,784 --> 01:56:13,046
Dad is in hospital.

1723
01:56:13,519 --> 01:56:16,147
I haven't had a life with the police,
evidence, court cases.

1724
01:56:16,522 --> 01:56:20,720
The last time I checked I was 22.
Just 22.

1725
01:56:21,193 --> 01:56:23,491
I don't have a life.
I don't have a boyfriend.

1726
01:56:24,196 --> 01:56:26,892
A normal life which every
normal girl experiences.

1727
01:56:27,099 --> 01:56:28,964
I have to beg for it.

1728
01:56:29,668 --> 01:56:31,465
I want to live but I can't.

1729
01:56:31,871 --> 01:56:35,500
I am tired of running around
the police and the courts.

1730
01:56:36,642 --> 01:56:38,075
I can't do this anymore.

1731
01:56:38,477 --> 01:56:41,173
There is no hope. There never was.

1732
01:56:42,214 --> 01:56:44,205
I just want to move on.
I am fed up.

1733
01:56:45,951 --> 01:56:47,009
You are fed up?

1734
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:49,610
You don't want to fight anymore...

1735
01:56:50,122 --> 01:56:51,180
because you're fed up?

1736
01:56:51,757 --> 01:56:53,224
Are you watching a movie...

1737
01:56:53,659 --> 01:56:55,126
that you're fed up and
you want to walk away?

1738
01:56:56,162 --> 01:56:58,062
Since when is this
your personal battle?

1739
01:56:58,697 --> 01:57:01,029
You don't understand...
- Yes, I don't understand.

1740
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:04,492
I don't understand how you can
let your sister's killers get away.

1741
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:06,501
I don't understand how
you can give up...

1742
01:57:06,572 --> 01:57:08,005
when the entire nation
is fighting for her.

1743
01:57:08,808 --> 01:57:09,866
She was your sister.

1744
01:57:10,576 --> 01:57:12,510
Not mine and not of
the hundred and...

1745
01:57:12,578 --> 01:57:13,636
thousands who are
fighting out there.

1746
01:57:14,513 --> 01:57:16,504
And you are fed up? Rubbish!

1747
01:57:18,517 --> 01:57:21,918
Don't look away, Sabrina. Look
at me and you better listen to me.

1748
01:57:22,521 --> 01:57:24,512
All the work that you
have done will mean nothing.

1749
01:57:25,524 --> 01:57:26,923
This is not the time to give up.

1750
01:57:26,992 --> 01:57:29,119
This is the time to
get back to rogues...

1751
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:33,128
Do you even know what the public
is doing for your sister?

1752
01:57:33,999 --> 01:57:36,263
We have received more than
two hundred thousand messages.

1753
01:57:36,602 --> 01:57:38,263
And everyday we get thousands more.

1754
01:57:38,938 --> 01:57:41,907
These messages will be taken
to the President of India.

1755
01:57:44,143 --> 01:57:45,201
The pressure is rising.

1756
01:57:45,611 --> 01:57:47,238
On the police and the judiciary.

1757
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:48,740
On the entire establishment.

1758
01:57:49,782 --> 01:57:52,717
And you want to walk away from
this just because you're fed up?

1759
01:57:53,052 --> 01:57:54,110
You're 28.
You don't have a boyfriend.

1760
01:57:54,186 --> 01:57:55,244
And you don't have a normal life.

1761
01:57:56,288 --> 01:57:59,553
This is not about you or
how you feel, sweetheart.

1762
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:02,560
This is about Jessica.
And you better understand that.

1763
01:58:06,966 --> 01:58:08,763
The candlelight is
tomorrow at five p.m.

1764
01:58:09,135 --> 01:58:10,193
You have to be there.

1765
01:58:10,703 --> 01:58:12,227
And I am not leaving
till you say a yes.

1766
01:58:39,331 --> 01:58:42,164
And he said... Amitabh
Bachchan's shameless imitator.

1767
01:58:42,334 --> 01:58:44,325
Those dialogues were hilarious.

1768
01:58:45,337 --> 01:58:47,271
- Are you kidding me?
- I just couldn't control... Hey!

1769
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:54,737
Bloody scoundrel.

1770
01:58:54,813 --> 01:58:55,871
Stop, you idiot.

1771
01:58:56,015 --> 01:58:57,676
You're smiling? Bloody scoundrel!

1772
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:58,808
Go faster...

1773
01:58:59,618 --> 01:59:00,676
Go faster!

1774
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:02,778
How dare you touch her!

1775
01:59:03,355 --> 01:59:04,686
How dare you touch her!

1776
01:59:04,757 --> 01:59:06,952
- Jess, let him go.
- How dare you touch her, rascal.

1777
01:59:07,026 --> 01:59:08,084
Let him go.

1778
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:09,218
Let him go?

1779
01:59:09,295 --> 01:59:10,626
Go and touch your mother!
- I lost balance on the cycle.

1780
01:59:10,696 --> 01:59:12,095
- Jess...
- I will teach you a lesson.

1781
01:59:12,164 --> 01:59:13,791
- That's enough.
- Cycle lost balance?

1782
01:59:13,866 --> 01:59:16,061
- Jess, leave him.
- You think you can get away?

1783
01:59:16,135 --> 01:59:17,727
Why are you fighting with him?
- I am sorry.

1784
01:59:17,803 --> 01:59:19,031
- Go apologize to your mother!
- Jess?

1785
01:59:19,104 --> 01:59:21,231
You scoundrel,
how dare you touch her?!

1786
01:59:21,307 --> 01:59:24,003
- Are you mad?
- Jess, enough. - You scoundrel.

1787
01:59:24,376 --> 01:59:25,843
- She is mad.
- Bloody hell!

1788
01:59:25,911 --> 01:59:28,812
- Running away now?
- Let him go!

1789
01:59:29,315 --> 01:59:31,010
- Try and touch me.
- Jess, let him go.

1790
01:59:31,317 --> 01:59:33,376
Have you lost it?
You want to let him go?

1791
01:59:34,386 --> 01:59:35,648
Jess, forget it, let him go.

1792
01:59:35,721 --> 01:59:36,779
Forget it?

1793
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:39,655
Idiot, stop being a nerd.

1794
01:59:39,725 --> 01:59:41,659
This is Delhi, you
have to learn to fight.

1795
01:59:41,794 --> 01:59:43,352
Today it was just a touch,
someday it could be rape.

1796
01:59:43,729 --> 01:59:44,787
Learn to stand up for yourself.

1797
01:59:44,863 --> 01:59:45,921
Idiot!

1798
01:59:45,998 --> 01:59:47,056
Forget it!

1799
02:01:54,993 --> 02:01:58,326
In pain...

1800
02:01:59,031 --> 02:02:01,932
the heart cries out...

1801
02:02:02,868 --> 02:02:05,530
a prayer...

1802
02:02:06,805 --> 02:02:09,535
Prayer...

1803
02:02:10,943 --> 02:02:17,507
that is balm to my pain...

1804
02:02:17,583 --> 02:02:21,280
You should've recognised that
b******. - And it's prayer...

1805
02:02:21,353 --> 02:02:23,321
It could've been me
instead of Jessica.

1806
02:02:24,823 --> 02:02:26,814
I did, didn't I?

1807
02:02:27,493 --> 02:02:32,829
I told them what I saw.

1808
02:02:32,898 --> 02:02:34,365
Didn't I, Peter?

1809
02:02:35,434 --> 02:02:37,163
I confessed to what I saw.

1810
02:02:38,837 --> 02:02:41,101
If the court doesn't believe...

1811
02:02:41,573 --> 02:02:42,870
how is it my fault?

1812
02:02:42,941 --> 02:02:48,402
You lied, mom.
- Why? Why is everybody blaming me?

1813
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,414
Why is everybody blaming me, Peter?

1814
02:02:51,850 --> 02:02:59,916
Why are they blaming me?

1815
02:03:00,926 --> 02:03:07,490
Despair pleads at
the Lord's door...

1816
02:03:08,867 --> 02:03:15,898
Why doesn't joy reign...

1817
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:19,406
What's your comments being
Delhi's CM?

1818
02:03:19,611 --> 02:03:24,071
From what I've heard and seen,
I feel justice was denied.

1819
02:03:24,583 --> 02:03:32,080
As a woman, it saddens me
even more.

1820
02:03:32,624 --> 02:03:39,154
Bow your head...

1821
02:03:40,032 --> 02:03:42,500
Say a prayer...

1822
02:03:43,602 --> 02:03:49,268
Speak up..."

1823
02:04:59,978 --> 02:05:03,243
Without saying a word...

1824
02:05:03,482 --> 02:05:07,316
Without moving your lips...

1825
02:05:07,386 --> 02:05:12,221
Call out... call out...

1826
02:05:12,991 --> 02:05:18,258
Mr. President, we have received
more than 200,000 SMSes...

1827
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:19,991
and lots of emails in this case.

1828
02:05:20,666 --> 02:05:23,260
Listen to your heart... Speak up...

1829
02:05:23,335 --> 02:05:27,237
Thank you. I will have a look at it.

1830
02:05:27,306 --> 02:05:28,364
Thank you, sir.

1831
02:05:29,074 --> 02:05:31,099
Has your party
pressured you into resigning?

1832
02:05:31,176 --> 02:05:32,507
Absolutely not.

1833
02:05:32,578 --> 02:05:34,136
There's no pressure at all.

1834
02:05:34,613 --> 02:05:35,671
Namaste.

1835
02:06:01,173 --> 02:06:04,665
Mr. President, what do you have
to say about the Jessica case?

1836
02:06:04,743 --> 02:06:08,770
You see, I have got
more than 200,000 SMSes...

1837
02:06:09,548 --> 02:06:12,711
and I am going
through each one of them.

1838
02:06:13,285 --> 02:06:18,052
Let me assure you, if something's
needed from my end...

1839
02:06:18,123 --> 02:06:20,057
I will not hesitate in doing that.

1840
02:06:24,062 --> 02:06:25,791
We have to give it
a lot of thought...

1841
02:06:26,064 --> 02:06:29,795
if we need to overhaul
our judicial system.

1842
02:06:30,135 --> 02:06:34,367
So that those who seek justice,
aren't denied of it.

1843
02:06:35,741 --> 02:06:36,799
Say what you will...

1844
02:06:37,509 --> 02:06:38,635
but there are some
serious questions.

1845
02:06:40,345 --> 02:06:44,441
The fact is nobody has the right
to make a mockery of the judiciary.

1846
02:06:46,251 --> 02:06:47,377
What's your opinion, Rekhaji?

1847
02:06:53,358 --> 02:06:57,089
"What you call prayers..."

1848
02:06:57,295 --> 02:07:03,530
"it's not just to
heal the wounds."

1849
02:07:04,369 --> 02:07:09,238
"it's not just to
heal the wounds."

1850
02:07:09,307 --> 02:07:12,834
"It's also strength,
it's also revolution..."

1851
02:07:13,211 --> 02:07:19,150
"it's also a
path to get justice."

1852
02:07:19,217 --> 02:07:20,275
The person...

1853
02:07:20,352 --> 02:07:22,377
"It's also a path
to get justice."

1854
02:07:22,454 --> 02:07:23,546
for whom you are here...

1855
02:07:24,623 --> 02:07:28,753
I am here for her as well.

1856
02:07:28,827 --> 02:07:34,595
Thank you.

1857
02:07:34,666 --> 02:07:41,128
"Let's pray together."

1858
02:07:41,306 --> 02:07:48,144
Despair pleads at
the Lord's door...

1859
02:07:48,213 --> 02:07:56,177
Why doesn't joy reign...

1860
02:07:57,189 --> 02:08:03,219
These days of pain
seem infinite...

1861
02:08:03,295 --> 02:08:05,286
That evening I saw India come
together for the third time.

1862
02:08:05,363 --> 02:08:08,161
It felt as if
they had suffered injustice.

1863
02:08:08,233 --> 02:08:10,463
And Jessica was talking
through them.

1864
02:08:10,902 --> 02:08:12,733
Sabrina wasn't alone and helpless...

1865
02:08:12,904 --> 02:08:14,166
the entire nation was with her.

1866
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:15,731
It was fighting for her.

1867
02:08:16,341 --> 02:08:17,501
The public raised its voice.

1868
02:08:17,776 --> 02:08:19,175
They were asking the same question.

1869
02:08:19,511 --> 02:08:22,708
And someone had to give an answer.

1870
02:08:22,781 --> 02:08:27,912
"Speak up."

1871
02:08:48,573 --> 02:08:52,737
In pain...

1872
02:08:53,912 --> 02:08:57,348
the heart cries out...

1873
02:08:58,717 --> 02:09:06,954
a prayer...

1874
02:09:21,439 --> 02:09:25,967
You won, Sabrina.

1875
02:09:27,479 --> 02:09:29,242
The High Court has
issued a press release.

1876
02:09:29,881 --> 02:09:31,576
The High Court accepted the appeal...

1877
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:34,414
by the police against
the lower court judgement.

1878
02:09:34,986 --> 02:09:36,715
The case is being fast-tracked.

1879
02:09:48,834 --> 02:09:50,699
This case raised serious questions.

1880
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:52,828
The High Court...

1881
02:09:53,305 --> 02:09:54,863
would like a rehearing of this case.

1882
02:09:55,774 --> 02:09:57,969
The High Court has issued...

1883
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:01,001
non-bailable warrants
against the accused.

1884
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:03,677
And the hearing of this case...

1885
02:10:04,783 --> 02:10:05,841
You see...

1886
02:10:05,951 --> 02:10:08,442
the High Court will
fast-track this case.

1887
02:10:09,354 --> 02:10:11,345
And will hold its
hearings on a daily basis.

1888
02:10:12,457 --> 02:10:14,015
So that in this case...

1889
02:10:14,526 --> 02:10:15,618
justice is delivered.

1890
02:10:16,595 --> 02:10:17,653
And soon.

1891
02:10:19,698 --> 02:10:20,756
You won.

1892
02:10:54,733 --> 02:10:58,794
Meera, thank you.

1893
02:11:16,354 --> 02:11:19,755
As I told you I never
understood Delhi. I never will.

1894
02:11:20,558 --> 02:11:22,355
And just when I had
begun to accept that...

1895
02:11:22,427 --> 02:11:24,520
Delhi belongs to the powerful...

1896
02:11:24,696 --> 02:11:27,096
that's when the
power left their hands...

1897
02:11:27,432 --> 02:11:28,990
and went to its rightful place.

1898
02:11:29,734 --> 02:11:30,792
To the hands of the people.

1899
02:11:31,836 --> 02:11:33,360
The Supreme Court held
Manish Bhardwaj guilty...

1900
02:11:33,438 --> 02:11:35,372
for the murder of Jessica.

1901
02:11:36,107 --> 02:11:38,098
He was sentenced to
life imprisonment.

1902
02:11:38,977 --> 02:11:41,104
Vishal Rastogi and Lucky Singh
were sentenced for four years each.

1903
02:11:42,847 --> 02:11:44,508
Last year, Sanjit passed away.

1904
02:11:45,383 --> 02:11:47,374
Sabrina still
manages her travel agency.

1905
02:11:48,053 --> 02:11:49,486
She still doesn't have a boyfriend.

1906
02:11:50,522 --> 02:11:52,854
And I am still a witch.

1907
02:13:32,757 --> 02:13:39,060
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1908
02:13:40,098 --> 02:13:47,231
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1909
02:13:52,510 --> 02:13:54,068
"Delhi's left me..."

1910
02:13:54,145 --> 02:13:57,637
"Delhi's left me..."

1911
02:13:57,715 --> 02:14:00,946
"Delhi's left me stunned."

1912
02:14:01,086 --> 02:14:04,715
"Delhi's left me..."

1913
02:14:04,789 --> 02:14:08,122
"Delhi's left me stunned."

1914
02:14:15,266 --> 02:14:19,066
"Delhi's left me..."

1915
02:14:19,137 --> 02:14:22,231
"Delhi's left me stunned."

1916
02:14:22,540 --> 02:14:29,537
"Delhi's left me stunned."

1917
02:14:29,614 --> 02:14:36,281
"Damn Delhi..."

1918
02:14:36,688 --> 02:14:40,146
"This powerful city...
This ruthless city..."

1919
02:14:40,225 --> 02:14:43,956
"It left me stunned."

1920
02:14:49,134 --> 02:14:52,626
"It has left me..."

1921
02:14:52,704 --> 02:14:56,299
"It has left me
completely shocked."

1922
02:15:10,722 --> 02:15:17,150
"What shall I do? O Lord!"

1923
02:15:17,228 --> 02:15:20,061
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1924
02:15:20,131 --> 02:15:27,094
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1925
02:15:27,172 --> 02:15:29,800
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."

1926
02:16:01,973 --> 02:16:04,066
"Damn Delhi..."

1927
02:16:05,677 --> 02:16:07,907
"Damn Delhi..."

1928
02:16:09,013 --> 02:16:12,847
"This powerful city...
This ruthless city..."

1929
02:16:12,917 --> 02:16:16,648
"It left me stunned."

1930
02:16:25,396 --> 02:16:28,695
"Delhi's left me..."

1931
02:16:28,766 --> 02:16:31,963
"Delhi's left me stunned."

1932
02:16:32,403 --> 02:16:35,770
"Delhi's left me..."

1933
02:16:35,907 --> 02:16:39,274
"Delhi's left me stunned."

1934
02:16:41,012 --> 02:16:44,914
"She's here. She's a witch.

1935
02:16:44,983 --> 02:16:47,918
She's got a heart of gold,
but she swears a lot."

1936
02:16:47,986 --> 02:16:51,945
"Move aside. Move aside."

1937
02:16:54,425 --> 02:17:00,955
"She is full of passion.
Move aside."

1938
02:17:01,699 --> 02:17:07,968
"This is hot blood.
Move aside."

1939
02:17:08,973 --> 02:17:12,704
"She is a bit naughty.
She is a bit mischievous."

1940
02:17:13,111 --> 02:17:17,070
"She is a bit intoxicating.
She's a bit poisonous."

1941
02:17:17,148 --> 02:17:20,015
"She's a firecracker.
She's a bomb waiting to explode."

1942
02:17:20,285 --> 02:17:25,450
"She's super spicy.
She's feisty."

1943
02:17:25,523 --> 02:17:28,720
"She gutsy."
