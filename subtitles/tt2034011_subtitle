1
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,507
I am sorry.

2
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,709
Hey! Wait. Wait.

3
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:28,413
Good morning, Reema.
- Good morning, Seema.

4
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,210
I'm Reema. And I'm Seema.

5
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,474
You forget daily.

6
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,280
So the two of you exchange
your names.

7
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,615
And there will be no confusion.

8
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,588
Good morning, Mr. Rishi Malhotra.
- Good morning.

9
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:39,124
How come you are late today?
What happened? - Because of Rishi.

10
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:43,662
I'll also make him late one day.
Late Rishi Malhotra.

11
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:48,231
I'll empty an entire bottle of
phenyl in his protein shake.

12
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:49,700
How cheap! - How mean?

13
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:51,634
Kriplani sisters, I am joking.

14
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,902
As it is, when I get this pageant
account he'll die anyway.

15
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,871
Because of the burden
of his failure.

16
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:01,142
Rishi, it's a very important
day for you today.

17
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:02,608
Why? Is Kartik dead?

18
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:03,842
Come on, Rishi.

19
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,551
I'll make an offering of
Rs.1.25 the day he dies.

20
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,348
At Siddhivinayak. - Just Rs1.25.

21
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,218
The offering will be equivalent
to his market value.

22
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,314
Forget all this.

23
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:14,257
Listen, I know... - Today it will
be decided as to who...

24
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,488
...gets the beauty pageant account.
- Of course, I know.

25
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,325
Do you guys have any
doubts about me?

26
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,831
No, pal. There is no doubting you.

27
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,758
Is there any other guy
who is as smart...

28
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:23,894
...well behaved and well groomed.

29
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,762
There is no one more
honest and sincere.

30
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,397
There is no one more hardworking...

31
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,441
...and intelligent than you
in the entire office.

32
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,634
Never mind the office.
Not even in the country.

33
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,213
And your communication skills.
Awesome.

34
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,747
Do you know when I had
joined the office...

35
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:38,613
...my dream was to get out
of this 5x5 cubicle...

36
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,414
...and I will have a 30x30
cabin on the 20th floor.

37
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,853
And I'll have my personal
book shelf...

38
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,391
...tie rack and a personal
toilet too.

39
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,326
And I'll never have to stand
alongside those peons and...

40
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:51,557
You know what I mean.
- Kartik, sir.

41
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,256
Rishi, sir.

42
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:54,763
Wadhwa sir has called you.

43
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:57,200
Keep your fingers and toes
crossed. - All the best.

44
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,864
Sir, you called. - My regards,
sir. - Good morning, sir.

45
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,338
What's good about the morning?

46
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,438
The morning is good when
you do some work.

47
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,807
Sir,
I've got all the tickets booked.

48
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:06,607
And this time,
I've got a 20% discount too.

49
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,308
And sir, I've cracked a very good
deal with the catering unit.

50
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,475
They are including Italian
too in the menu this time.

51
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,518
You love Italian, sir. - And sir,
I've even got 50% discount...

52
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,145
...from Intercontinental
for the rally.

53
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,621
Sir, I used my uncle's influence.

54
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,351
I've got a very good sponsorship...

55
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,427
...from the taxi service
without any uncle.

56
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:22,756
Are you speaking the
truth or are...

57
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:25,457
...you just trying to impress me?
- Sir, I never lie.

58
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,430
And sir, I'm doing everything
to impress you...

59
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,899
...because how will I
get a promotion...

60
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,432
...if you are not impressed.

61
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:32,763
I am impressed.

62
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,771
Sit down. - Thank you, sir.

63
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,239
I need a guy who is not just
responsible and talented...

64
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:42,212
...but is honest and sincere
too for this account.

65
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:42,907
Absolutely right, sir.

66
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,310
And is not just honest and
sincere, but he is also...

67
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,909
He is also hardworking
and intelligent, sir.

68
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,381
Spot on. - Thank you sir.

69
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:51,218
And not just hardworking
and sincere, but is...

70
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,693
But is not just dynamic.
He is a dynamite.

71
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,554
Someone whose duty is to
play with challenges...

72
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:00,565
...and know very well how
to tackel the pressure.

73
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,700
I am sorry for eavesdropping,
guys.

74
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:04,294
But am I right, sir?

75
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,735
Bang on, Mr. Ravi Agarwal.

76
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,466
That is why I am giving you the...

77
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,201
...responsibility of this pageant.

78
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,409
Boys, meet this young and
dynamic find of mine.

79
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,737
Mr. Ravi Agarwal.

80
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,438
He is the captain of the
national rugby team.

81
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:19,450
And our new vice president
of Paradigm entertainment.

82
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:21,677
Congratulate him. - Yes sir.

83
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,715
Congratulations.
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

84
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,692
Congrats. - I promise I'll
not disappoint you, sir.

85
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,886
And I am not giving this
responsibility only to you.

86
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,320
And I'm also giving two guys
who are very sincere...

87
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:36,425
...intelligent, responsible,
honest, hardworking and talented.

88
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:39,300
Mr. Kartik lyer.
And Rishi Malhotra.

89
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:43,874
Welcome,
young men, welcome to my den.

90
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:46,506
Bring the books carefully.

91
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,510
I've been carefully collecting
these since my college days.

92
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,174
Just these many?

93
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,909
That's because they
are the choicest.

94
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:58,655
You know what.
I always had a dream...

95
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,389
...as to when I'll get out
of my 3x3 small cabin...

96
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,191
...and get into such a magnificent
sprawling 20x20...

97
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:06,322
Sir, 30x30.

98
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,392
You are right. 30x30.

99
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,663
I'll sit in such a magnificent
30x30 office...

100
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:13,500
...where I'll have my personal...

101
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,541
Personal book shelf, personal
secretary, personal tie rack.

102
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,337
Yes. And my personal... - Toilet.

103
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:19,404
Exactly.

104
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,408
You guys understand me so well.

105
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,446
We'll enjoy working together.

106
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:26,843
Come on. Let me show you some
latest rushes of glamour.

107
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,747
Come on. - Sir. - Lights off.

108
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,889
And now let's watch.

109
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,370
Hi, I am Shabana Raza.

110
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:50,635
And I'm from Mumbai.

111
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,375
I'm 20 years old.

112
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:03,619
My vital stats are 32-24-36.

113
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:09,556
I don't like people who tell
lies unnecessarily.

114
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:13,098
The ones who use manipulation
to progress in life.

115
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,726
So if I can find a friend
in this contest...

116
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,860
...so I'll think I've already won.

117
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,467
The last song of the night

118
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:55,871
Girls, let us rock tonight.

119
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,780
The last song of the night.

120
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:06,545
Girls, let us rock tonight.

121
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,756
Find an excuse, pal.

122
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:13,587
We don't want to go home.

123
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,855
Don't care even if you
stop breathing...

124
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,760
...but your legs must not stop.

125
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,266
Dance as if you freaking
don't care, my friend.

126
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:23,665
Don't care if this night
comes to an end...

127
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,295
...but don't stop the music.

128
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:31,940
Don't care even if the entire
city is woken up...

129
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:34,237
...don't stop the music.

130
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,712
Don't care if this night
comes to an end...

131
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:40,684
...but don't stop the music.

132
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,699
Live carefree. Who knows what's
in store tomorrow?

133
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:03,242
Don't care if anyone stops you,
keep the party going on.

134
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:13,446
Don't care if anyone stops you,
keep the party going on.

135
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,578
Don't care even if you
stop breathing...

136
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,553
...but your legs must not stop.

137
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:20,558
Dance as if you freaking
don't care, my friend.

138
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,128
Don't care if this night
comes to an end...

139
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,562
...but don't stop the music.

140
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,829
Don't care even if the entire
city is woken up...

141
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,803
...don't stop the music.

142
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,934
Don't care if this night
comes to an end...

143
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,338
...but don't stop the music.

144
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:44,844
Listen to the beat track.
- The party is going on non-stop.

145
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,646
The music makes me crazy.

146
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,516
So make a large one, baby.

147
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:50,145
I am going to dance and moving.

148
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,917
Going to get it grooving.

149
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,625
The party is going to
continue all night.

150
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,593
Because this night
is without curfew.

151
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:59,256
I am also watching the
one you are watching.

152
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:02,334
Be just a little wary of me,
pal.

153
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,837
Hey,
she will be mine in a flash.

154
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,431
What's that you wish for?

155
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,705
She'll come into my arms,
darling.

156
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:16,407
Pal, forget all the grudges
in your heart.

157
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:19,718
Dance as if you freaking
don't care, my friend.

158
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,349
Don't care if this night
comes to an end...

159
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,856
...but don't stop the music.

160
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:30,590
Don't care even if the entire
city is woken up...

161
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:32,654
...don't stop the music.

162
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,295
Don't care if this night
comes to an end...

163
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,860
...but don't stop the music.

164
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,715
Hey, Reema Seema. - Does everyone
have their boarding cards? - Yes.

165
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:57,779
Good. - My seat is next to
Ms. Shabana, right? - Yes. It is.

166
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:01,190
It took a lot to arrange the seat.
- You double checked, right?

167
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,750
Yes, Rishi.
Yours is the window seat.

168
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:04,762
And Shabana?
- The seat right next to yours.

169
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,890
Your seat number is 6f
and Shabana's is 6e.

170
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,191
No disturbance.

171
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,572
Oh. Ms. Ria Dixit. - Oh. Hello.

172
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,309
You are looking gorgeous,
aren't you? - Thank you.

173
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,670
Have you collected the
boarding pass etc?

174
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,578
Or do you want some help? - No.
No. Don't worry.

175
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,549
I've upgraded myself in
to business class.

176
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,778
You know It's too hot in economy
I really can't sit there.

177
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:28,912
Oh. That reminds me.

178
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,816
The competition will be
really tough this time.

179
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,825
The competition will be tough.
But not for me.

180
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,319
For the rest.

181
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,555
See you. - Alright. See you.

182
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:50,335
Mr. Rishi. Kartik.

183
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,870
Hello, guys. - Yes sir. - Come on.
You must focus on your work.

184
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,846
Please. - Yes sir. - Yes
sir. - Alright. Thanks.

185
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:58,249
Hi. May I help you?

186
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,419
Excuse me. - Hey. Moron.

187
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,257
Here. Let me keep it.

188
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:10,252
Thank you. - It's really heavy.

189
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:11,796
If you don't mind. What's in it?

190
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:14,264
Nothing.
Just some necessary things.

191
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,200
So that means I should
also be in that bag.

192
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,132
In the coming days,
you'll need me a lot.

193
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,265
Rishi Malhotra.
Manager of Paradigm entertainment.

194
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:26,607
Oh. I'm Shabana Raza. Contestant.

195
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,543
Nice meeting you. - Same here.

196
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,741
Can I keep my bag now
if you're done.

197
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,142
Oh, sorry. - No, no. Don't worry.

198
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,583
Please. Please. Have a seat.

199
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:35,912
Okay. - Your bag.

200
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,784
Thank you. - You're welcome.

201
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,888
I'll help you again and again.

202
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:41,491
And you'll thank me
again and again.

203
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,189
So it's better if we
become friends.

204
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:45,789
Kartik lyer.

205
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:48,323
Senior Manager.
Paradigm entertainment.

206
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:52,838
Wow. I am Shabana Raza.
- Of course. I know.

207
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,167
My God! I am so lucky.

208
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,401
I am sitting with the
two most important...

209
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,703
...people of this contest.

210
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:01,240
Do you want to sit on my window
seat? - It's beautiful. - Can I?

211
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:03,212
Sure. - Thank you so much

212
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,213
Thank you. - Come. Come.

213
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:06,842
You don't mind, right.
- No. Not at all.

214
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:11,546
Hello boys. - Good morning,
sir. - Good morning, sir.

215
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:13,316
Do you mind if I sit
with these two?

216
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:14,450
Oh. Not at all.

217
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,256
You may sit on my business
class seat.

218
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,729
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

219
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,696
By the way, Ravi Agarwal.

220
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,124
President of this organization.

221
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,669
And the boss of these two.

222
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:28,697
Well it was lovely meeting you.
- My pleasure. - Bye.

223
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:15,845
Come on. Come on.

224
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,523
5... 6... 7... 8.

225
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,291
Be confident...

226
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:25,286
Straighten your back...
enough stomach in...

227
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,663
Know to enough you tonight

228
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,301
Okay, girls.
We'll change the music now.

229
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,303
I want to see the real
choreography. Alright?

230
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:35,602
So be alert. Cell phones off.
- And back into the wings.

231
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,336
Move. Move. - Make four copies.

232
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:40,441
And one to Wadhwa sir. One to
Ravi sir. - Me and... - Kartik.

233
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,105
Yes ma'am. - Have the props
arrived from the finale...

234
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,274
...of the stage measurements.
- I see. They haven't.

235
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:47,185
You had told Rishi, isn't it?
- Yes, Mr. Kartik.

236
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:50,387
Are we studying in a nursery?
- You had told him and him.

237
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,650
You should've got it if Rishi
hasn't. - Not a big deal.

238
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,486
Anyway, stay here. - I want to
discuss something with you.

239
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:58,189
Reema, get me some coffee.
- I am Seema. - Whatever.

240
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:00,726
Where the heck is everyone?

241
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,225
Where is the music?

242
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,171
5... 6... 7... 8.

243
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:21,176
Hi. Can you help a bit?

244
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:25,455
Look, I have practiced this pose.
But I am a little confused...

245
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,419
...whether I should turn
left or right.

246
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:30,526
Ouch. Easy. It is hurting me.

247
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:34,260
You know. I am a totally confused.

248
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,698
This is my first time. - So I was
just wondering what I should do.

249
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,330
I am really nervous.

250
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,565
Do whatever you want.

251
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,403
Simple. - Next. - Oh no.

252
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,342
Yes. Yes.

253
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,883
5... 6... 7... 8.

254
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:01,550
Next...

255
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,827
Rishi sir... - Walk straight.

256
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,529
This choreographer is like Hitler.

257
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,292
She just needs a stick
in her hands.

258
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,101
I'm so nervous, Rishi sir.
- Don't be nervous.

259
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,137
I was also really nervous
until a few years.

260
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:14,172
Are you also a model? - No.
In the school.

261
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,441
When teacher would ask me
to read an essay on cow.

262
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,608
Now I've learnt the trick.

263
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,740
The trick is in these
beautiful eyes.

264
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,674
Look into my eyes.

265
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,079
What do you see?

266
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,545
Dark circles. - Not down.

267
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,715
In my eyes. Look into my eyes.

268
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,824
And pretend as if every
thing in my heart...

269
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:39,326
...is reverberating in your
mind like a loudspeaker.

270
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:40,456
Got it?

271
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,424
Exactly.

272
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,796
Look at the choreographer
with this confidence.

273
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,903
Wow! Thank you, sir.

274
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:53,504
Next. - They're calling me.
- Don't be nervous. Okay.

275
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:55,342
I'll be watching you from
among the audience.

276
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:56,574
It's all in the eyes.

277
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:06,851
That's my girl.

278
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:13,090
Pose. Wow.

279
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,104
Wonderful.
We'll do it one more time.

280
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,301
Brilliant.

281
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,439
Lovely, girl.

282
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:35,575
Very nice. That's great, Shabana.

283
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,689
I just gone to stage -Really.

284
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,190
I can't believe it.

285
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:42,183
She praised me.

286
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:44,089
She praised me.

287
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:45,562
You are the lucky girl.

288
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:47,423
I don't know if I am lucky or no.

289
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,866
At first I was so scared of her.

290
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,533
All the plans... - Rishi sir.

291
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,196
Hi. - Hi.

292
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,802
Sorry. I'll see you later.

293
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:57,300
Rishi sir.

294
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,305
I'll talk to you later.
- We'll meet again. - Yes.

295
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:03,847
Oh God! Rishi sir.

296
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,907
I never realized that
just making...

297
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,416
...eye contact could do wonders.

298
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,722
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you.

299
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:16,886
Come on. Move.

300
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:19,892
Shabana, you were very good.
Inside.

301
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,732
Thank you so much, Kartik sir.

302
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,231
Do you know? - No.

303
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,303
Rishi sir told me that make eye...

304
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,339
...contact with the choreographer.

305
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,270
With confidence. - I see.

306
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:30,939
Actually you know what? - What?

307
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:32,575
It worked. - Really.

308
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:37,279
Good, Rishi. Very good.
- But Rishi didn't tell you this.

309
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:39,340
There will be four
judges tomorrow.

310
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,282
With whom will you make
eye contact then?

311
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,615
You'll fall while walking.

312
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,214
Eye's are two and...

313
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:46,484
Judges are four

314
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:49,284
This is real injustice.

315
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,757
But don't worry. - Rishi will
get you justice for sure.

316
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:54,797
Right? - Give him time... I'm sure
he'll come up with something.

317
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,924
Right, Rishi?

318
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,235
Ma'am, Rishi.

319
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,228
Oh. Rishi, where were you?

320
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:02,204
I've been looking all
over for you, sweety.

321
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:03,501
Come with me to my room.

322
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,168
I want to discuss something
very important with you.

323
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:06,404
Ma'am, I am working.
I am right here.

324
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,537
It's very important, Rishi.
Come. - Please. Please.

325
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,911
I am very sorry. - Shabana... And
don't remain awake for too long.

326
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,640
Try to sleep early.
- I'll talk to you later.

327
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:14,345
Come on, Rishi. - Bye.

328
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:17,587
Rishi sir is very nice.

329
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,282
He is so helpful. - Yes.

330
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:20,655
Otherwise what difference
does it make to anyone...

331
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,694
...whether I lose or...
- You are absolutely right.

332
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:24,456
He is very helpful.

333
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,497
What do you mean?
- At times I wish I was like Rishi.

334
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,228
He is so good with girls.

335
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:32,600
Girls fall for him so easily.

336
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:33,862
I mean...

337
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,203
I have not fallen for him.

338
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:40,208
I... I am not talking about you.

339
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,179
That choreographer... inside.

340
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,815
I don't know what spell
Rishi has cast on her.

341
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,879
He will help her a bit.
And in return...

342
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:52,547
I mean, it's his personal matter.
What do we care?

343
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:53,682
Do we?

344
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:12,572
Hello. - It's a wake up
call for Ms. Shabana.

345
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:16,571
Rishi sir.

346
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:19,584
A beautiful sunrise is waiting
for you outside your window.

347
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:22,449
Oh it's morning... obviously.

348
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:25,182
And some beautiful flowers
outside your door.

349
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,314
For me?

350
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,326
Hold on a second.

351
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,761
Why did you send this, Rishi sir?
- Nothing.

352
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:40,168
Just a small reward.

353
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:42,238
For trusting me.

354
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,935
Okay. Where are you right now,
Rishi sir?

355
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,370
On the phone.

356
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:47,809
Close to your ear.

357
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:51,648
And very soon I will have
breakfast with you.

358
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:55,314
8:30. Don't be late. Okay.

359
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,528
See madam's attitude.

360
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,296
She got compliments after
one rehearsal.

361
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:14,895
And her behavior has changed.

362
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,435
Look. What looks she is giving!

363
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,670
Good morning.

364
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,280
Good morning, Rishi sir.

365
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,918
Thanks for sending the flowers.

366
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,850
But you need not do all this...

367
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,513
Before you say anything else...

368
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,352
...I want you to see someone.
- Come.

369
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:33,448
Come.

370
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:37,924
I think this manager has got the
duty of managing Shabana.

371
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:40,856
Rishi sir.

372
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,267
Why are you doing all this?

373
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:46,768
What do you want from me?

374
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:52,140
You think I am doing all this
to gain something from you?

375
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:55,441
Yes. - Fine. I won't help you.

376
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,239
What's the need?

377
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,350
Rishi sir, you should have
some understanding...

378
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,112
...about these things.

379
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,586
Shabana, you are the most talented
person in this contest.

380
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:07,490
I don't want some mediocre girl
to win instead of you.

381
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,760
If like me, you also lag behind
in spite of being talented...

382
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:12,729
...I will feel very bad.

383
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,659
I am so sorry, Rishi sir.

384
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,632
I overreacted.

385
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:19,568
But you feel I am doing all this...

386
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:22,469
...so that I can expect something
from you in return.

387
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,634
Fine. I will stay away from you.

388
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:28,911
Rishi sir. Rishi sir, please.

389
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:30,772
Rishi sir, I am so sorry.

390
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:32,274
I just overreacted.

391
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,142
How could you?

392
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:36,611
You see,
last night Kartik sir told me...

393
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:39,122
So you trust Kartik sir more?

394
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:43,351
There are such ungrateful people
in this world, aren't there?

395
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,153
I got him a job.

396
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,523
I did his work and got
him a promotion.

397
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:50,599
I made him independent.

398
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,294
But he...

399
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:57,242
Let it be. Forget all this.

400
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,668
You were going to show me
something, weren't you?

401
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:02,539
Mr. Raheja.

402
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,679
He is the main sponsor
of the event.

403
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:05,841
Our main judge.

404
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,551
On the left side.

405
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,777
Rishi,
Mr. Raheja is going to Delhi...

406
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:11,720
...for an urgent board meeting.
- You know, don't you?

407
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,189
I hope you will inform.

408
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,119
Come on.
- Yes. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

409
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,320
Scoundrel.

410
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,130
Mr. Malhotra,
we should be grateful...

411
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:25,101
...that you took out time and came
here. - You never have time.

412
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,630
Anything for you.

413
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:27,762
Thanks, sir.

414
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,267
What time does the show start?
- Sir, in ten minutes.

415
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:32,435
Ten minutes. - My luggage was
coming in another car.

416
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:33,637
If you could,
you just find out that...

417
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:35,577
I will check it right away, sir.
- Thanks.

418
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:37,911
Sir,
meanwhile, have our special drink.

419
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,282
I have especially ordered
it for you, sir.

420
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:41,710
Sure. - Ravinder.

421
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,320
Bring it.
- Sir, your special drink.

422
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,422
Ravinder! What have you done?
- Oh, my God.

423
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,490
I am sorry about this, sir.
- I am very sorry about this.

424
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:55,760
Need some help here.

425
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:57,893
Why has my luggage still not come?

426
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:00,703
Sir, I can manage this.
- Yes. Come with me.

427
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:02,364
We will manage it.

428
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:06,339
Sir. - Your suit.

429
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,077
It's absolutely clean.

430
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,647
Thank you. - And a brand new tie.

431
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:11,740
Thank you.

432
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:14,245
The show must have started, right?

433
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,617
No, sir. I have postponed
it for five minutes.

434
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:18,584
Really?
- I told you I will manage this.

435
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,718
Okay. I am impressed.

436
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:22,250
Come, sir.

437
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:25,153
Eight models.

438
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:26,821
Tough choice.

439
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,163
So, who is the favorite?

440
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,128
Sir, I have seen the rehearsals.

441
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,364
But I don't want to influence you.

442
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:36,303
What makes you think you
can influence me?

443
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:39,176
You must have a favorite.

444
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:42,839
Since you are insisting so much,
there is a contestant.

445
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:45,846
I think it is contestant
number eight.

446
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:47,575
Confident walk.

447
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:48,710
Lovely smile.

448
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,149
And beautiful eyes.

449
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:53,284
Contestant number eight, right?
- Yes.

450
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,155
Her name is Shabana Raza.

451
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,454
Shabana. - Raza.

452
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:58,620
I'll look for her.

453
00:26:58,797 --> 00:26:59,821
Let's go.

454
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:02,464
I think Shabana is going to
give a tough competition.

455
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,429
What? - Talk about yourself, babes.

456
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:05,560
Not with me.

457
00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:08,863
Everyday girls like Shabana
book their return ticket...

458
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:10,403
...from Mumbai Central.

459
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:13,376
If she doesn't go back within
a year, she will surely...

460
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:16,476
...be seen in some mother-in-law,
daughter-in-law serial.

461
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:19,774
Mark my words. - Daughter-in-law's
role will suit Shabana.

462
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:22,680
Daughter-in-law's role
will suit you.

463
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:25,382
Shabana will get the
mother-in-law's role.

464
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:33,856
Oh, baby.

465
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:35,156
So, Ms. Shabana.

466
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,702
Who else has sent you flowers?

467
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:41,468
Nobody else. Only Rishi sir.

468
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,164
He is so sweet.

469
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:44,733
Quite smart.

470
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:47,643
You have chosen a good means
to win the pageant.

471
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,907
By making a deal with
that simpleton.

472
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,180
What are you saying? - Oh, baby.

473
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:56,151
For the past six years I wasn't...

474
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:58,222
...whiling away time in
the modeling industry.

475
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,450
When you were playing
flirting games...

476
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:02,288
...with small kids in school...

477
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,423
...I was learning how
to walk the ramp.

478
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,861
Yes. But why are you saying
all this to me?

479
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,326
Because I need to set
you in your place.

480
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,501
So that you don't come in my way.

481
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:15,799
So now,
can you get out of the way?

482
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,707
Shabana.

483
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:27,115
I was looking for you.

484
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:30,487
What happened? - Nothing.

485
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:32,182
Did somebody say something to you?

486
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,622
I told you that I don't
want to talk about Ria.

487
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:37,318
She is so rude.

488
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,188
Forget Ria.

489
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:42,099
There is no comparison between
the two of you.

490
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,199
Rishi sir,
please just leave me alone. Okay?

491
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:45,496
Okay. Tell me something.

492
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:49,340
If Ram is Sita, who is Ram?

493
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:52,868
What? - Lf Ram is Sita, who is Ram?

494
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,437
Who? - Tailor.

495
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,079
Rishi sir,
that was such a stupid joke.

496
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,484
But it made you laugh, right?

497
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:05,212
Shabana, be positive.

498
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:06,681
Smile.

499
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,292
And win the jury's heart as well.

500
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:11,390
And yes, one more thing.

501
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,397
Mr. Malhotra is the main
sponsor of this round.

502
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,860
And he is wearing a silver tie.

503
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:19,800
He is the man you must
concentrate on.

504
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,158
He is radiant like the moon.

505
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:47,829
At times he is proud
like the sun.

506
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,803
The passion of the whole world
dwells in his eyes.

507
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:54,895
My beloved.

508
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:01,345
He thunders like the lightning.

509
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:03,740
And showers like the rain.

510
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:09,378
At times close to me,
at times you dwell in my heart.

511
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:13,780
I am smitten, beloved.

512
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:19,593
I have lost my heart to you.

513
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:23,896
My beloved.

514
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:28,705
My beloved.

515
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:33,734
My beloved.

516
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:38,780
My beloved.

517
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:43,944
My beloved.

518
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:04,402
My heart stops beating
if you don't come.

519
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:15,646
My heart stops beating
if you don't come.

520
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:23,585
His love made me lose
all my senses.

521
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:28,926
He is my destination
as well as my path.

522
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:36,636
He beats in my each heartbeat.

523
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:39,674
He is the twinkle of my eyes.

524
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:44,309
He has even stolen my soul.

525
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:49,677
I am smitten, beloved.

526
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:54,753
I have lost my heart to you.

527
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:58,761
My beloved.

528
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:04,864
My beloved.

529
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:09,535
My beloved.

530
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:58,379
Thank you.

531
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:02,185
And the winner is...
contestant number eight.

532
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:03,488
Ms. Shabana Raza.

533
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,654
Congrats.

534
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:12,226
Hi.

535
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,695
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

536
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:18,673
What happened to your prediction,
Ria?

537
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:21,402
It's beginner's luck, darling.

538
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,180
It works once,
not again and again.

539
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,641
We will see in the next round.

540
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,505
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

541
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,692
Scoundrel.

542
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,633
You speak a lot, don't you?

543
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:57,165
Now speak.

544
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,075
Who's there?

545
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:09,109
One bad dream... go to sleep.

546
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,279
Scoundrel.

547
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:21,289
Good morning.

548
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,133
Good morning, Rishi sir.

549
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:24,692
Kartik.

550
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:26,227
Sorry.

551
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:28,365
I thought it is Rishi sir.

552
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:30,704
He gives me a wake up
call every morning.

553
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:31,833
Is that so?

554
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,571
Does he deliver the newspaper too?

555
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:34,702
One minute.

556
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:42,147
Yes, Kartik sir. - Actually, I
called up to congratulate you...

557
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:43,854
...for winning yesterday's contest.

558
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,384
Thank you.
But it was just the first round.

559
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:51,319
I am really tense about today's
Ms. Beautiful Hair round.

560
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:53,288
I couldn't sleep the whole night.

561
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:55,730
Don't worry. I know that you
will win this contest.

562
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:59,200
You know what? - You have got the
most beautiful hair in the world.

563
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:01,169
You are very sweet, Kartik sir.

564
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,296
Really. You...

565
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:05,867
My hair.

566
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:08,541
Hello, Shabana. Are you alright?
- My hair. - Hello. Shabana.

567
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:10,273
My hair. Oh, my God.

568
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,178
Shabana, I will just come.

569
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:13,750
Just give me two minutes. Okay?

570
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,314
Hello. - Hello.

571
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:24,358
Hello.
Hello. - Rishi sir. - Rishi sir, I...

572
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,453
Hello.

573
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:29,265
Rishi sir, this is Shabana.

574
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,197
I can't hear anything. Hello.

575
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,804
Oh, my God.

576
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:41,269
Oh, my God.

577
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,472
Oh, my God.

578
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:45,109
I am finished.

579
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,309
Last night the sponsor
sent a hair harbal

580
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,685
I think I got an reaction
with that herbal.

581
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:56,353
I should have listen
to the hair expert.

582
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:58,190
I am such a fool.

583
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:02,795
Don't cry. Don't cry.

584
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,664
Everything will be fine.
Shabana, listen to me.

585
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:05,862
You will be fine.
You will be fine.

586
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:11,337
Look, I have a friend who is a
hair specialist. - In Panjim.

587
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:13,639
We will go to him.
He will help us. Okay?

588
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,179
But today is carnival. - So?

589
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:18,340
There will be traffic on the road.

590
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:21,344
Oh, God. - Fine. Fine. Let's
do one thing. - Oh, my God.

591
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,178
Get ready quickly
and come outside.

592
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,788
I will wait for you outside. Okay?

593
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,784
Hello.
Yes. - This is Ravi Agarwal...

594
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,557
...vice president of Paradigm
entertainment.

595
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,564
Look, I want a jet ski scooter
in ten minutes.

596
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:36,764
By ten minutes,
I mean ten minutes. Got it?

597
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:37,858
Yes.

598
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:53,213
Come.
- We want to go to the beach. Sit.

599
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:55,576
Come on. Quick.

600
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:00,524
You?

601
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:02,723
Rishi sir. - Where were you?

602
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,563
I think he has got a sore throat.

603
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:09,360
Rishi, go quickly and gargle
with mouthwash.

604
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:10,764
You will feel better. Go. Go.

605
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:16,071
Rishi sir, what are you saying?
We don't understand anything.

606
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,198
I can understand.

607
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,299
I understand his language a bit.
Right?

608
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,578
Rishi, come on.
It's okay. I will manage.

609
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,343
He is saying,
'Today, go with Kartik.'

610
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:27,645
'Because he is unwell.'

611
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:32,248
He is so sweet. He is taking
me to a hair specialist.

612
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:38,557
Yes. Yes. - We won't spare them.
We won't spare the sponsors.

613
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,790
You had brought them, right?
Look at this. - Bad products.

614
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:44,759
Fine. Fine.

615
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:46,326
Fine. You tackle them.

616
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:48,302
I will take her to the
hair specialist. Fine?

617
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,171
You need medicine.

618
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,175
Come on. Come on. Quick.

619
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,840
Okay. Okay, Rishi. Bye.

620
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:58,707
Hey buddy give me two
life jacket please.

621
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:02,447
Come. Come.

622
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:07,581
Rishi.

623
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,526
Don't worry. - I will hold
on to Kartik sir tightly.

624
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,560
And I am a good swimmer too.

625
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:16,393
Hold this. - Yes. - Bye, Rishi sir.

626
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,833
Come on. We are getting late.
- Thank you. - Bye, Rishi. - Bye.

627
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,600
Bye. Take your medicine.

628
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:23,196
Bye, Rishi sir. Bye.

629
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,094
Marvelous.

630
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:55,501
You are looking gorgeous.

631
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:57,335
I am so sorry, Kartik sir.

632
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,436
You saved my life today
really you did.

633
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,508
No. I mean, that is...

634
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:06,340
That's alright.

635
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:09,244
Shabana ma'am. - Shabana ma'am.

636
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,783
Yes. You also call me Kartik sir.

637
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,224
Why are you pulling my leg?

638
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:18,156
Shabana Raza you're requested
to report back stage...

639
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:21,231
Somebody is calling my nmber.
- When will my turn come?

640
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:22,590
What?

641
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,292
Somebody is calling your number.

642
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:26,694
I am being called.
- Yes. - Kartik sir.

643
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,531
I mean, Kartik, wish me luck.

644
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:29,797
Bye.

645
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:34,437
All the best, Shabana.

646
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:02,131
Wow! Amazing!

647
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:06,677
From all of them she had nice
hair... - I think she should win...

648
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:08,311
You got it.

649
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:33,294
Cow is the mother of all animals.

650
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:35,905
And India will worship the cow.
- Cow is a multipurpose animal.

651
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,300
Not only is it used for milk,
but it is also...

652
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,740
...used for transportation.

653
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:40,936
Cow's milk is used to make curd,
cheese, tea and coffee.

654
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:44,939
You can do it.

655
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,844
Don't be nervous.

656
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,516
You know, Shabana.

657
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:52,582
I can't tell tall tales
like others.

658
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,452
I am a simple man.

659
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,886
I mean, boy.

660
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:58,452
I...

661
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:01,630
I feel shy to say it.

662
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,131
Do you know, Shabana?

663
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:06,896
After meeting you the motto
of my life has changed.

664
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:10,135
Earlier I wanted to earn
a lot of money.

665
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:12,439
I wanted to prosper in life.

666
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:17,511
But now,
I just want to be with you.

667
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:18,839
Hi, Shabana.

668
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,682
Shabana,
I have written a poem for you.

669
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:26,654
Open the window of your heart.
- And let my love enter.

670
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:28,455
We will love each other.

671
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,288
Whether it's spring,
summer or winter.

672
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:37,127
Shabana.

673
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:38,932
That day has arrived, Shabana.

674
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,131
When I can open the
door of my heart...

675
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,334
...and send it to the door of
your heart to ring the bell.

676
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:51,546
Very... very, very bad, Kartik.

677
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,312
I love you, Shabana.

678
00:42:58,489 --> 00:42:59,786
I really love you.

679
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,793
Shabana, forget whatever happened.

680
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:06,222
Now, nobody will deceive you.

681
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:09,595
Come into my arms, Shabana.

682
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:13,499
Even the air won't be able to
touch you, leave alone Rishi.

683
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,174
You can do this, Kartik lyer.

684
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:25,577
I told you to keep it in your bag.
- So many times I've tell you...

685
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,242
- See the time.
We are getting late.

686
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:29,548
Don't give me any excuses.
- Come on. Come on.

687
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:56,307
I rang the bell first. - Get lost.

688
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,143
Look. We are grown up boys.

689
00:43:58,549 --> 00:43:59,880
It's not good to quarrel.

690
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:01,748
I want to talk to her for two
minutes. You come later.

691
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:02,649
Do you think I am a waiter?

692
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,483
I want to talk to her for two
minutes. You come later.

693
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:05,647
I would have left.

694
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,824
But you see,
Shabana and I are going on a date.

695
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:10,292
Tell me whatever you want to say.
I will tell her. - Okay? Go.

696
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:11,418
Get lost.

697
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:14,193
She is my date. - Got it?

698
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:17,393
You fool,
in today's date she is my date.

699
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:20,262
No matter when you come,
she will be my date.

700
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:22,563
Understood? - Shabana can't belong
to anyone besides me.

701
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:24,438
I made her win the first time.

702
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:26,176
I gave my tie to Malhotra.

703
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,208
I flattered him for Shabana's
sake. - She is mine. Got it?

704
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,845
I was also not whiling away time.

705
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:32,773
I took her to the hair stylist.

706
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:35,283
I made her win the round.
Did you understand? - She is mine.

707
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:38,617
She is mine. - She is mine. - Mine.

708
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:39,781
She is mine. - Mine.

709
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,914
She...

710
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:44,318
Shabana.

711
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:47,457
Shabana. - Disgusting. - I
can explain. - Shabana.

712
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:48,896
I can really explain. - Get lost.

713
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:51,325
Shabana.

714
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,573
Why are innocent eyes upset?

715
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:08,341
Why are sweet talks aloof?

716
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:13,349
Don't be sad and lost.

717
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:15,888
Know this.

718
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:18,457
I am in love with you.

719
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:22,531
Shabana, don't be upset.

720
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:27,360
Shabana, smile.

721
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,404
Let a smile linger on your lips.

722
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:37,608
Shabana will be my life.

723
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:42,344
Shabana. Shabana.

724
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:46,854
Will be my life.

725
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,787
Shabana. Shabana.

726
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:55,694
Will be my...

727
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:19,650
Listen.
I say that the world is bad.

728
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,418
People talk sweetly.

729
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:24,790
And then deceive you.

730
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:27,125
Trust me.

731
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:29,389
I am an honest guy.

732
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,866
Everybody loves.

733
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,899
But my love is good.

734
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:37,629
I wish on a falling star.

735
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,468
Forgive me.

736
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,574
What was done was done.

737
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,738
Shabana.

738
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:47,410
Shabana, don't be upset.

739
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:51,644
Shabana, smile.

740
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:57,158
Let a smile linger on your lips.

741
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:02,194
Shabana will be my life.

742
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:07,260
Shabana. Shabana.

743
00:47:08,873 --> 00:47:11,706
Will be my life.

744
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:16,611
Shabana. Shabana.

745
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:21,279
Will be my life.

746
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,831
Please get it now.
- Just sort it out.

747
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:42,703
Hurry up. Hurry up. You can't
smoke now. - Let's go out.

748
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:47,404
You don't have to do all this.

749
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:52,648
Your two admirers must have
planned something for you.

750
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,774
Right?

751
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:56,180
They made you win two rounds.

752
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,879
This is no big deal.

753
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,181
But remember one thing.

754
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:05,526
No matter how many ruses you
play with both of them...

755
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:08,262
...but I will win this contest.

756
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,791
And if you are talented...

757
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:14,535
...try to win on your merit.

758
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:18,265
I promise you.
I will quit this industry forever.

759
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:26,182
Before we announce the names
of the three finalists...

760
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,145
...I want to tell you that...

761
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:29,844
...we have a special guest
amidst us today.

762
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:33,518
Eminent filmmaker Mr. Madhur
Bhandarkar.

763
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,844
Sir, what do you think about
this fashion pageant?

764
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:07,347
It was fabulous.

765
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,153
Very talented girls.

766
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,584
And I wish the best girl wins.

767
00:49:12,563 --> 00:49:14,497
Thank you so much. Thank you.

768
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:35,744
I participated in this
competition...

769
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:37,844
...so that I can make some friends.

770
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:41,450
And I think I have
made friends here.

771
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:49,832
And the moment we all have
been waiting for.

772
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:54,499
The winner of Ms. Glamourama 2011.

773
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:57,137
Ria Dixit.

774
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:21,196
Shabana. - Shabana. - Shabana.

775
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:23,165
You have not eaten anything
since morning, Shabana.

776
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,427
This was my line. - So?

777
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:27,870
Shabana, please come out.
- Come out for me, Shabana.

778
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:28,768
Shabana, look.

779
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:30,932
You used to say that winning
is not important for you.

780
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:34,508
She said it just like that.
She meant it? - Oh, my.

781
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:37,672
Shabana, Rishi is criticizing you.

782
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:39,646
He thinks you couldn't
have won the contest.

783
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,344
When did I say that? - Just now.
Just now. - Shabana.

784
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:43,852
Shabana, come out. Open the door.

785
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:45,922
I will come inside and lock it,
Shabana. - Shabana.

786
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:48,420
Shabana, open the window. - I will
enter through the window. - Okay?

787
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,323
Shabana, please.
- Shabana, don't listen to him.

788
00:50:50,394 --> 00:50:51,691
Shabana, please open the door.

789
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:53,286
Please. - Shabana, open the door.

790
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:56,730
Open the door. - For me,
Shabana. - Shabana, please.

791
00:50:57,768 --> 00:51:01,169
Look Shabana,
I've stolen this sash for you.

792
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:04,607
This will look even
better when it...

793
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:07,371
...is put around your slim waist.

794
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:09,912
And when this crown is
put in your hair...

795
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:13,248
...it will glitter even more
with the glow of your face.

796
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:15,480
What are you doing, Shabana?

797
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:16,744
You're tickling me.

798
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:20,215
Shabana, how come you've
hair on your hands?

799
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:22,721
And stop snoring, Shabana.

800
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:24,589
Please. You make so much noise.

801
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:31,860
Where is that madam?

802
00:51:32,236 --> 00:51:34,170
Ma'am went to Mumbai by 6
o'clock morning flight.

803
00:51:34,238 --> 00:51:35,603
It means she checked out. - Yes.

804
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,738
I would've found her
now if you hadn't...

805
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:39,400
...been checking me out all night.

806
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,444
You still haven't understood.
That she is mine.

807
00:51:41,512 --> 00:51:42,774
Because I am a very nice boy.

808
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:44,780
Have you ever looked at
yourself in the mirror?

809
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:46,406
What if I make her my girlfriend?

810
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:47,609
I'll leave the city.

811
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:49,345
So come on.
Start packing right now.

812
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:52,285
Okay. - Hey.

813
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:25,883
Hello. - Hello.

814
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,687
I want to meet Ms. Shabana.

815
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:30,517
I'll call her.

816
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:43,635
Kartik, you?

817
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,798
Yes Shabana. Me.

818
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,207
What are you doing here?

819
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:49,575
I was waiting for you until now.

820
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,211
Now I am talking to you.

821
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,645
We can't talk here. - Why? Wouldn't
you invite me in? - No. No.

822
00:52:54,718 --> 00:52:56,743
Please. Let's go from here. - Why?
What happened?

823
00:52:57,187 --> 00:52:58,654
But Shabana, tell me.
What happened?

824
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:01,390
Have you gone crazy?
What are you doing here?

825
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:03,649
I should ask you this question.

826
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:05,888
You left without telling me.

827
00:53:06,263 --> 00:53:08,322
You should've at least said
bye to me before leaving.

828
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:10,263
But now I'll say bye
before leaving.

829
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:11,562
Okay. Goodbye Kartik sir.

830
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:13,395
I really can't be here.

831
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:14,528
Hey Shabana.

832
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:19,300
I love you, Shabana.

833
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:22,239
All the days we were together...

834
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,444
...I felt that we are made for
each other every moment.

835
00:53:29,453 --> 00:53:33,287
Will you Shabana Raza
take me Kartik lyer...

836
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:35,886
...to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

837
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:38,919
Kartik, what are you saying?

838
00:53:39,196 --> 00:53:40,686
Look, you can say no if you want.

839
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:42,723
I will not feel bad.

840
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:44,732
Yes. But I want to tell you...

841
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:48,327
Yes. Did you just say yes?
- Yes. But I want to say that...

842
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:50,406
You just said yes.
Right? - Yes, I had. But...

843
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:53,637
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Shabana. - What?

844
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,302
You might not have got the crown.

845
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:57,276
And I might not have
got a promotion.

846
00:53:57,548 --> 00:53:59,345
But both of us have met
each other, Shabana.

847
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:01,714
This is what you want to say,
right?

848
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,714
You may take the girl away
by saying my lines.

849
00:54:05,155 --> 00:54:07,316
Yours? - But you will be able
to meet it, Kartik?

850
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:10,451
Will you be able to understand
all of Shabana's feeling?

851
00:54:11,428 --> 00:54:13,293
Will you be able to fulfill
every wish of her?

852
00:54:14,698 --> 00:54:17,223
Look Shabana,
don't fall for what he says.

853
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:20,426
The one who loves you is me.

854
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:24,366
The one who wants to
marry you is me.

855
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:28,143
And I'm the one you love.

856
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:33,276
Listen. Listen to your heart.

857
00:54:34,117 --> 00:54:35,209
She's listening.

858
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,111
She's listening. - She isn't deaf.

859
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,189
My name is reverberating
in her heart.

860
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:43,720
Kartik. Kartik. Kartik.

861
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:46,557
Guys, stop pressuring me. Please.

862
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:48,855
I mean.

863
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,463
I love both of you a lot.

864
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:54,670
And I also know both of
you like me a lot.

865
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,806
I mean I might not find the
friends I have found in you...

866
00:54:57,908 --> 00:54:59,500
...anywhere in the world.

867
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:04,303
But choosing one of you is
very difficult for me.

868
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:07,584
When I come to such a
stage in my life...

869
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:10,678
...I don't take the decision.
Someone else takes it.

870
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:12,414
Shabana. Shabana.

871
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:15,123
I will have to go.
- I am sorry. I am sorry.

872
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:17,356
Shabana. - Shabana. - Who? - Who?

873
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:19,486
Shabana, tell me.

874
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:20,787
Who?

875
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:23,623
Leave me. - Leave me.

876
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:27,867
Brother, is anyone here?

877
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:31,301
Is anyone listening to us?

878
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:47,455
My darling.
My sweetheart. Don't worry.

879
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:51,122
Don't strain your intelligent
brain.

880
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:53,453
Go.

881
00:55:54,564 --> 00:55:55,656
Whose voice is that?

882
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:56,790
How do I know?

883
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:03,736
Idiot,
be respectful to the guests.

884
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,637
My dry fruits.

885
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:08,811
My cashew nuts. My almond.

886
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:11,103
Give me a hug.

887
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:13,376
Give me a kiss.

888
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,408
What's wrong?

889
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:18,644
There is no feeling in your
kiss or in your hug.

890
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:20,188
Are you feeling alright?

891
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,225
Where are we?
- Why have you brought me here?

892
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:24,624
They have lost their memory.

893
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:25,885
No problem.

894
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:29,662
Son, you have been kidnapped.

895
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,226
Kidnapped!
- So your memory has come back.

896
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:38,767
Son, I am extremely sorry from the
extreme corner of my heart.

897
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:40,900
And I had told my tough baldy...

898
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:43,305
...that they shouldn't be hassled
when they are kidnapped.

899
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:47,509
But see how they have destroyed
your beautiful face.

900
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:48,775
I am sorry, son.

901
00:56:48,852 --> 00:56:51,685
My blood pressure had shot up.

902
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:54,382
After all, I'm Shabana's uncle.

903
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:55,515
Uncle!

904
00:56:55,926 --> 00:56:57,917
Bless me. - God bless.

905
00:56:58,195 --> 00:56:59,423
Hugs, uncle.

906
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:00,496
Kiss, uncle.

907
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:05,734
Dearies,
my experience says that since...

908
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:09,105
...you can't take a nap during
the kidnapping...

909
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:10,867
...the guy gets tired.

910
00:57:11,374 --> 00:57:12,705
That's why have some snacks.

911
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,336
Try dry fruits.

912
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:17,274
There are cashew nuts,
almonds, raisins.

913
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:19,482
Thank you, uncle. - Sure, uncle.

914
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:23,880
Actually, I wanted to ask you why
you kidnapped us like this.

915
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:25,279
I was forced to, son.

916
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:29,223
Look, if I would've said to
you that I am a poor man.

917
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:32,227
There is not even a cot
in my house to sit.

918
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:34,362
Would you have given my
Shabana a second look?

919
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:37,326
If I would've told you that
I am a man who is ill.

920
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:38,560
My knees pain.

921
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:42,126
You would've thought Shabana
belongs to a family of patients.

922
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:43,570
Would you have formed a
relationship with her?

923
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,906
If I had called you and told you
that I am thief, a robber...

924
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:50,645
...would you have answered my call?
- Enough, uncle.

925
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,610
Love doesn't care about religion,
caste...

926
00:57:52,682 --> 00:57:55,150
...fair and dark, rich and poor,
deaf and dumb, rich and poor...

927
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:57,152
...old and new,
slim or handicapped.

928
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:58,448
What is he saying?

929
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:00,113
You've made me happy.

930
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:02,453
You've made me happy.

931
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:03,821
You've made me happy, Kartik

932
00:58:04,227 --> 00:58:06,627
Rishi, uncle.
- Kapoor. - No. Malhotra.

933
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,129
But Rishis are Kapoors.

934
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,357
Forget him, uncle.

935
00:58:09,432 --> 00:58:10,126
Sorry, uncle.

936
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,191
I might be crossing my limit.
- Never mind a robber.

937
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:15,430
If you were a underworld don,
a criminal or a dacoit...

938
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:17,473
If you had committed 8-10 murders.

939
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:19,804
Even if you were into smuggling,
illegal activities...

940
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:21,605
...or extortion,
I would've come to you even then.

941
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:25,239
Because true love doesn't care
about these things, uncle.

942
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:28,245
This is amazing. Amazing.

943
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:36,189
You are like sugar.
And he is like candy.

944
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:39,451
This is great. - Listen, morons.

945
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:40,720
You see.

946
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:43,422
For the first ever time I have
met boys who consider me...

947
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:46,627
...the helpless uncle of a niece.

948
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:48,637
Don't hide anything from them.

949
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:50,228
They are our nephews.

950
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,774
Take out your knives and guns.

951
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:55,777
And show them who uncle really is.

952
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:59,906
He is a don. He is a don.

953
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:10,718
Sons, do you want me to give
my introduction again?

954
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:12,755
I am Uncle of Shabana.

955
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:14,595
Hello sir. - The don of dons.

956
00:59:14,698 --> 00:59:16,427
Panchu Don from Punjab.

957
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:20,435
My USP is that the police of no
country are looking for me.

958
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:22,505
And I am looking for a match for...

959
00:59:22,572 --> 00:59:24,540
...my Shabana in all the countries.

960
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:27,233
And I have found him today.

961
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:29,507
Mr. Wong. - Yes sir.

962
00:59:29,746 --> 00:59:32,476
This is my son-in-law.
- Both of them.

963
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:35,210
Mr. Wong, you are wrong.

964
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:37,843
This is the small confusion
in my life.

965
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:41,190
That my Shabana is always
double minded.

966
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:43,316
I have to give her
everything double.

967
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:45,326
She wanted admission in college.

968
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:48,258
But she couldn't decide whether
she wants arts or science.

969
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:50,363
I said dear, do both.

970
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:53,231
She wanted a car. - And she
couldn't decide if she wanted...

971
00:59:53,303 --> 00:59:56,295
...a white one or a red one.
- I told her take both.

972
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:57,873
And now when she wants to marry...

973
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:00,803
...my baby is not able to decide
whether she wants you or him.

974
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:05,614
I told her dear, I can give you
everything double in life.

975
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:07,683
But I can't give you
double husband.

976
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:10,844
That is why I got both
of you kidnapped.

977
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:14,882
Now I'll train both of you.
- Training?

978
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,650
Yes. Since you have to handle
my business later.

979
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:19,888
The one who clears this training...

980
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:22,529
...will go to my Shabana.

981
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:25,826
Uncle,
I was thinking of going home...

982
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:28,700
...once before the training starts.
- Where are you going?

983
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:30,262
Rishi, actually you stay here.

984
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:31,840
I'll go and meet my uncle.

985
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:33,739
Where are you going, son?

986
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:36,236
I am also your uncle.

987
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:38,439
And this is also your house.

988
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:42,848
Now you will go home only
with the wedding card.

989
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:50,826
Yes, Chaubey?

990
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:53,192
The news is right, boss.
- He is upstairs.

991
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:56,258
He watches 'Ramayan' on TV with
his family at 2 o'clock.

992
01:00:56,366 --> 01:00:58,834
We will attack him before
his 'Ramayan' begins.

993
01:00:58,902 --> 01:01:01,496
We have less time and more work.
Let's go!

994
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:03,129
Yes, boss, let's go.
Come on! - Tell me the address.

995
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:05,174
Room No. 223, 22nd floor.

996
01:01:05,275 --> 01:01:06,833
Good! He is already near to God!

997
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,105
It will be easy to
finish his game!

998
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:11,373
The whole battalion
will come along!

999
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:13,406
Come on!

1000
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:20,623
Which floor? - 22nd floor.

1001
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:22,615
Come on!

1002
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,496
Hey, oldie, you have come now?

1003
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:12,866
I am waiting for you
since so long.

1004
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:15,201
I will drink tea after
you will go.

1005
01:02:15,311 --> 01:02:17,506
Idiot! And you have come now?

1006
01:02:17,614 --> 01:02:20,742
Come on! I wonder which gutter's
water you have drunk.

1007
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,875
Hey atleast give the milk and go.

1008
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:35,455
Yes? Whom do you want?

1009
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:39,226
Hey? What are you doing?
- Why are you coming inside?

1010
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:40,735
Leave me! Who are you?

1011
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:43,336
Sir, look who has barged in!

1012
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:44,872
He pushed me aside and rushed in!

1013
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:45,870
Who the hell is he? - Who is he?!

1014
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:48,168
He is her boyfriend who
has reached home now.

1015
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:49,233
Madam, I don't know who he is.

1016
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:50,870
I know he is her boyfriend
because of whom...

1017
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:53,173
...we are put to shame
in our society.

1018
01:02:53,249 --> 01:02:54,648
I have witnessed it today.

1019
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:56,844
If you want to work at our place,
then work decently.

1020
01:02:57,086 --> 01:02:58,348
If you are up to such indecent
actions, I will fire you.

1021
01:02:58,421 --> 01:02:59,319
Shut up both of you!

1022
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:01,220
You have reduced this house
to a fish market.

1023
01:03:03,393 --> 01:03:04,485
Who are you, brother?

1024
01:03:04,627 --> 01:03:06,356
Why have you come here?

1025
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:10,160
Sunaina?

1026
01:03:11,601 --> 01:03:12,727
Love?

1027
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:16,895
No. I want water...

1028
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,239
Please bring water for him.

1029
01:03:23,112 --> 01:03:24,545
Now tell me. What's the matter?

1030
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:27,882
Sir, I'm from good family sir.

1031
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,185
My passport application
has been rejected.

1032
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:32,345
Please sign it, sir.

1033
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:35,280
I see! - Yes.

1034
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:37,856
So you are Manoj Tagye...

1035
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:41,229
Doesn't any law and order
prevail in the world?

1036
01:03:41,331 --> 01:03:42,662
The formalities are incomplete.

1037
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:44,165
The documents are insufficient.

1038
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:45,666
There is no police verification.

1039
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:47,760
How can I issue the
passport for you?

1040
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:53,539
You are my father! You are my God!
- You are my master.

1041
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,100
You are my Lord.

1042
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:56,644
You are my guardian.

1043
01:03:57,347 --> 01:04:00,544
Since childhood I was
away from abroad.

1044
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,675
Now when it is my turn
to go to abroad...

1045
01:04:02,752 --> 01:04:04,617
...you are not giving
your signature.

1046
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:06,120
I am your child too, sir.
- Stop it!

1047
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:09,590
My respect lies between your legs,
sir. - Hey, leave my kurta.

1048
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:12,184
You let me leave this country
and I will leave your legs.

1049
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:13,660
I swear by my mother.
- Come on, leave my legs.

1050
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,095
Please sign, sir. Sign it.

1051
01:04:15,164 --> 01:04:17,632
Sister-in-law, tell sir to sign
it. - Please give me a pen!

1052
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,531
A pen! - I have brought the pen,
sir. - Okay.

1053
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:21,126
Did you sign it? Did you sign it?

1054
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:24,365
Sir, please say. - I have signed
it. - Are you happy now?

1055
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:27,239
Sir,
you have saved a poor man from...

1056
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,868
...getting heart-broken today.

1057
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,807
May your children live
and suck your blood.

1058
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,144
Sister-in-law. - Yes?

1059
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:37,216
Whatever work you
have from today...

1060
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,586
...theft, burglary, ransom, murder,
to seize any house...

1061
01:04:41,691 --> 01:04:44,592
...killing contract,
any work XYZ, anything.

1062
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:46,252
I don't have your number with me.

1063
01:04:46,362 --> 01:04:47,590
So you please call me.

1064
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:50,463
Boss, is the work done? - Whenever
Munna takes up some work...

1065
01:04:50,566 --> 01:04:53,364
...think the work is done.
- Munna sir. - Yes?

1066
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:55,461
Uncle has told you to give an
urgent training program.

1067
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:57,631
Who has to be given the training?
- Here he is, sir.

1068
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,174
Which training he has to be given?

1069
01:04:59,242 --> 01:05:01,642
Of constable or watchman.
- Of son-in-law.

1070
01:05:02,178 --> 01:05:04,442
Then we will have to go to the
hostel. - Come on, move!

1071
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,573
Look, you have some
misunderstanding, brother! - Look! Hello?

1072
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:11,776
All the dons of the country,
whether they are from Kashi...

1073
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:13,882
...Mathura, Ayodhya or Tirupati.

1074
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,284
All of them,
A to Z, report to uncle.

1075
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:19,884
The fact is, my business is
spreading widely nowadays.

1076
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:22,661
What are we getting from all
around? - Breeze, boss!

1077
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:25,299
Shut up, dog!
- It's takeover, boss!

1078
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:26,665
Yes,
we are talking about takeover.

1079
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:28,897
We are having some dispute
problem in Kashmir...

1080
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:31,640
...while we are regularly
in touch with Pakistan.

1081
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,838
And Uncle is in no mood to do
business with Bangladesh.

1082
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:38,376
Uncle is just learning
Chinese today. - Oh!

1083
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:42,417
He feels one day Uncle's
moonlight...

1084
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:45,420
...will glow at Chandni Chowk.

1085
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:47,421
What do you all feel? - Darkness.

1086
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:49,218
Oh, you bloody!

1087
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:52,656
Which place is it?
- What sort of atmosphere is this?

1088
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:54,788
I am unable to breathe.
I am suffocated.

1089
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:56,422
I am Munna Military.

1090
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:58,762
Uncle has handed me the
responsibility to train you.

1091
01:05:59,268 --> 01:06:02,294
And this is your hostel. - You will
stay here. - Hostel? - Hostel?

1092
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:03,429
Of which university?

1093
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,736
Underworld Prathmik
Pathshala hostel.

1094
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:08,637
The pangs of love are fluttering
in your heart, right?

1095
01:06:09,078 --> 01:06:10,102
Come here.

1096
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:14,680
Tell something true... - Okay.

1097
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:16,841
Do you love Shabana?

1098
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,788
Actually, I want to tell you...
- Mr. Munna, the truth is...

1099
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:21,288
Speak up!

1100
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,880
Yes, I love Shabana.
- I love her too.

1101
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:24,887
I love her truly.
- I love her sincerely.

1102
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:26,185
Then live here!

1103
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:30,227
Sir, how can we stay here?
- Why not?

1104
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,823
Do you have cable TV here? - No.

1105
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,630
Okay, any cold drinks or beer
is available in the fridge?

1106
01:06:33,703 --> 01:06:34,635
Sorry. We forgot to keep it.

1107
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:36,433
You won't be getting any
newspaper here too. - No.

1108
01:06:36,506 --> 01:06:38,599
How will I sleep on
this folding bed?

1109
01:06:38,674 --> 01:06:40,266
I've a back pain problem.

1110
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:43,278
Munna sir, actually I am used to
drinking mineral water. - Yes.

1111
01:06:43,346 --> 01:06:45,075
My stomach becomes upset
without it. - Yes.

1112
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:46,740
You have not become
the son-in-law yet!

1113
01:06:48,117 --> 01:06:49,675
Remember one thing carefully!

1114
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,153
Don't try to flee from here.

1115
01:06:52,488 --> 01:06:54,456
It won't make any difference
on my health.

1116
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:57,219
But yes, tears will well
up in Shabana's eyes.

1117
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,791
Two drops of tears had welled up
in Shabana's eyes last year...

1118
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:02,428
...and Uncle became furious.

1119
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:04,466
I explained to him,
Uncle, please.

1120
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:06,525
These are the tears of joy.

1121
01:07:06,636 --> 01:07:07,830
But he killed three men.

1122
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:11,102
He replied, Whether they are
tears of joy or sorrow...

1123
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:15,173
...I don't want to see any
tears in Shabana's eyes.

1124
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:05,356
There are two ways
to run the world.

1125
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:08,854
Either run the world
or leave the world.

1126
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:11,429
Guns or Roses

1127
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:15,169
Fire! - Mummy!

1128
01:08:15,271 --> 01:08:16,295
Once more!

1129
01:08:18,274 --> 01:08:19,434
Once more!

1130
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:22,534
Run! Run! The police are here!
The police are here.

1131
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:29,611
Oh, mummy!

1132
01:08:35,358 --> 01:08:37,292
Shoot them...

1133
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:51,035
Inspector, please save us.

1134
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:54,736
We are kidnapped. Take us from
here. - Why are you doing this?

1135
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:56,141
Inspector!

1136
01:08:56,545 --> 01:08:57,705
Don Munna. - Yes?

1137
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,239
They are saying they
have been kidnapped.

1138
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:02,579
Look! Look!
- Munna sir, are they our men?

1139
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:03,811
Are they our men?

1140
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,485
Come here. Come here. Touch
my feet. - Yes, boss.

1141
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:19,767
What are you saying?

1142
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:21,861
It's paining badly. - Yes.

1143
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:24,439
Shall I say something?
- Yes, please.

1144
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,303
Both of you should run
away from here.

1145
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:29,211
My uncle is a very
dangerous person.

1146
01:09:29,312 --> 01:09:31,280
But, Shabana, you didn't
tell us before...

1147
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,109
...that your uncle is
an underworld don.

1148
01:09:33,182 --> 01:09:34,444
Exactly!
At least we would not have...

1149
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:35,711
...got trapped in this hell. - Yes.

1150
01:09:35,785 --> 01:09:37,878
If I would have told,
you wouldn't have befriended me.

1151
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,178
If I would have told...

1152
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:41,314
...you wouldn't have fallen
in love with me.

1153
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:43,415
No, no. Rishi meant to say
if we knew about it...

1154
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:47,121
...we would have told your
uncle to surrender. - Yes.

1155
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:48,662
That's it. That's it. - Yes.

1156
01:09:48,764 --> 01:09:50,288
That Sandesh had said the same.

1157
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:51,590
Sandesh?

1158
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:52,691
But...

1159
01:09:53,736 --> 01:09:56,364
Hey! Don't cry,
Shabana! Please don't cry.

1160
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:58,600
Look, you are under your uncle's
oath. - Don't cry, Shabana.

1161
01:09:58,674 --> 01:09:59,834
Shabana, control your emotions.

1162
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:02,738
Your uncle can never see tears
in your eyes. - Yeah.

1163
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:07,111
Never mind.
I will marry someone else.

1164
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:08,240
Really?

1165
01:10:09,618 --> 01:10:12,212
But what if your uncle
comes to know?

1166
01:10:12,788 --> 01:10:14,756
Let him come to know!

1167
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:17,383
But both of you don't
repeat the mistake...

1168
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,722
...which Prathmesh had made.

1169
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:20,185
Prathmesh?!

1170
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:22,463
Both of you will have to
forget about me. - Yes.

1171
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,632
What will happen at the most?

1172
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:27,659
Uncle will kill me.
- And what will he do to me? - Hey!

1173
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:28,829
What?!

1174
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:33,469
So both of you run away!

1175
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:35,771
Great idea!
I have seen a window on that side.

1176
01:10:35,845 --> 01:10:37,437
I will jump from it and run away.
Okay?

1177
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:39,640
Okay, bye. You go.
- See you. Bye. - Bad idea! - Why?

1178
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,107
Adesh had done the same mistake.

1179
01:10:42,318 --> 01:10:43,478
Adesh?!

1180
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,313
Then you tell us what the
right option is. - Yes.

1181
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:50,155
Both of you will have to leave
this country. - What? - What?

1182
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:54,192
Greece.
- To Greece? - Yes. - But why Greece?

1183
01:10:54,263 --> 01:10:57,289
That is the only country
where uncle can't reach.

1184
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,800
But do you how far Greece is.

1185
01:10:59,902 --> 01:11:01,529
How will we go to
Greece so easily?

1186
01:11:01,871 --> 01:11:03,771
I will have to call Swadesh
for that. - Swadesh?!

1187
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:05,204
He runs a travel agency.

1188
01:11:05,608 --> 01:11:06,768
But there is a problem.

1189
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:08,833
Swadesh is not answering my call.

1190
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:12,639
Oh, God! I wonder whether
he is alive or... - No, no!

1191
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:14,147
Or uncle has killed him...

1192
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,582
Shabana, please don't cry.
Don't cry. - Oh, my God!

1193
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:18,585
Shabana, please!
Look, don't go out crying.

1194
01:11:18,687 --> 01:11:20,655
Even if you feel like crying,
then cry from within.

1195
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:22,514
Like this. Listen!

1196
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:24,855
Who are Swadesh,
Adesh, Sandesh and Prathmesh?

1197
01:11:26,729 --> 01:11:29,664
See! She forgot to mention
Balwinder's name. - Balwinder?

1198
01:11:29,765 --> 01:11:31,494
All of them were interested
in Shabana.

1199
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,624
And now?

1200
01:11:33,636 --> 01:11:36,764
They are no more? - Yes.
They failed during the training...

1201
01:11:36,872 --> 01:11:38,772
...so uncle made their
lives unsuccessful.

1202
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:40,907
Well, it's inauspicious to take...

1203
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:42,508
...the names of the dead at night.

1204
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:45,337
Both of you sleep peacefully.
- Peacefully?

1205
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:48,148
Yes. Tomorrow is a difficult day.

1206
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:49,814
Everyone get out of the car.

1207
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,814
And listen,
stand here looking down.

1208
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:55,318
No one will recognize you.

1209
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:56,823
Usmaan the eunuch lives here.

1210
01:11:56,892 --> 01:11:59,224
Usmaan, the eunuch? - Yes.
He was uncle's important henchman.

1211
01:11:59,295 --> 01:12:01,855
But he backstabbed him and
ran away with the pillow.

1212
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:04,258
Understood? Both of you have
to bring that pillow.

1213
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:06,527
'Takiya' means a pillow, right?
- Yes.

1214
01:12:06,635 --> 01:12:10,093
You have brought us so far to
bring the pillow? - Yes. - Oh, darn!

1215
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:10,729
Hello? Where are you going?

1216
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:12,706
I will bring a new pillow
from Chor Bazaar.

1217
01:12:12,775 --> 01:12:14,140
I will accompany him too.

1218
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:15,734
Shut up!
- It is uncle's special pillow.

1219
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:18,269
He wants it and it's final.
The matter is finished.

1220
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,473
Go and bring the pillow from
Usmaan, the eunuch. Go!

1221
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:22,847
Is Usmaan Chakka really a eunuch?
- What did you say?

1222
01:12:22,918 --> 01:12:24,886
He is asking, is Usmaan eunuch?

1223
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:26,720
Plot no. 3. Bungalow no. 3.

1224
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:29,256
I am sorry. Sixer.

1225
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:31,849
Come on, go and bring it.
- Lf you try to act over-smart...

1226
01:12:31,927 --> 01:12:33,827
Won't you accompany us?
- Everyone knows me here.

1227
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,796
Do you want the India-Pakistan
match to begin here?

1228
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:37,389
Here? - Right here.

1229
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,297
Come on, go from here.

1230
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:51,402
Excuse me.
- Yes? - Where is brother Usmaan?

1231
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:55,681
I think Usmaan is very dangerous?

1232
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:57,184
He started crying as soon
I mentioned his name.

1233
01:12:57,253 --> 01:12:59,346
Shut up! I think someone
has died here. Come on.

1234
01:12:59,622 --> 01:13:01,613
Sister, where is brother Usmaan?

1235
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:03,215
What's wrong?

1236
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:05,226
Why are you crying?
Hello? - Hey, what have you done?

1237
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:05,692
No, no, brother...

1238
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:08,127
...I just asked sister about
brother Usmaan's whereabouts.

1239
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:11,464
Brother Usmaan? Yes.
He is no more. - What?

1240
01:13:11,734 --> 01:13:13,793
Look,
he is sleeping like a child there.

1241
01:13:19,808 --> 01:13:22,333
Good grief! Brother Usmaan!

1242
01:13:22,845 --> 01:13:25,712
Why did God have to take
you away today?

1243
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:29,281
At least you should have informed
us before going.

1244
01:13:29,585 --> 01:13:31,348
I am not brother Usmaan.
He is inside.

1245
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:32,781
Come on! - I am sorry.

1246
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:34,150
Let's go inside.

1247
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:41,387
Keep patience.

1248
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:42,759
Usmaan, the eunuch has died.

1249
01:13:43,432 --> 01:13:46,367
Usmaan,
the eunuch has died but which...

1250
01:13:46,435 --> 01:13:48,528
...is our pillow among these?

1251
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,445
Is this aunty laughing or crying?

1252
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,242
How are you, brothers?

1253
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:03,576
Hello, aunt. - Hello.

1254
01:14:03,686 --> 01:14:07,452
Your father must be an aunt.
It's me! Me! - I am me too.

1255
01:14:07,523 --> 01:14:10,253
It's not me, I've droped you...

1256
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:13,260
Mrs. Munna? - Oh! - Hello. - Hello.

1257
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:14,819
Your husband had come here
today morning. - Yes.

1258
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:17,798
Why are you solemnizing a wedding
at a funeral? - It's me!

1259
01:14:18,267 --> 01:14:19,825
Munna sir, you are here?!

1260
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:21,667
Yes, I have gone mad.

1261
01:14:22,137 --> 01:14:24,833
Brother Usmaan is no more.
- So the plan is cancelled?

1262
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:26,772
How is the plan cancelled?

1263
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:28,843
Take it. Both of you keep
a handkerchief each.

1264
01:14:30,312 --> 01:14:33,770
Brother Usmaan has vomited on
this pillow the last time.

1265
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:37,552
I will keep it with him.

1266
01:14:37,653 --> 01:14:39,587
Please give it to me, son.

1267
01:14:40,356 --> 01:14:43,291
This is that pillow.
- Yes, it is the one. - That's it.

1268
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,418
Come on, wrap it.

1269
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:48,296
Both of you have not come
for a film shooting...

1270
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:49,763
...you have come to a funeral.

1271
01:14:50,266 --> 01:14:51,597
So? - Wrap it round your head.

1272
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:55,136
Both of you wait here,
I will wait outside. - Okay.

1273
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:57,367
Brother Usmaan!

1274
01:14:57,806 --> 01:15:01,606
Brother Usmaan, I will keep your
favourite pillow with you.

1275
01:15:10,653 --> 01:15:12,883
Brother, pick up the dead body.

1276
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:18,651
Yes, carry it.
Come on, carry it. - Yes, come on.

1277
01:15:49,491 --> 01:15:50,753
Listen! Stop!

1278
01:15:52,127 --> 01:15:54,322
Everything has gone wrong.
Everything has gone wrong.

1279
01:15:54,396 --> 01:15:55,829
Come over there. Come over there.

1280
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:19,331
Hey, stop!

1281
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:22,136
Is your information correct?
- My information is perfect, sir.

1282
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,178
You must be aware, 'Uncle', sir.

1283
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,077
Uncle is very dangerous, sir.

1284
01:18:26,148 --> 01:18:27,877
Uncle and the others are
connected with the underworld, sir.

1285
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:30,778
Uncle's two dangerous
men Munna and Rishi...

1286
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:34,117
...sent me to bring the pillow
from brother Usmaan's shroud.

1287
01:18:34,189 --> 01:18:35,747
Look at my face, sir.
- Do I seem a goon to you?

1288
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:37,587
I am not dangerous, sir.
- But uncle is very dangerous.

1289
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:40,321
Uncle Nehru was our first prime
minister of Independent India.

1290
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:42,587
What connection does uncle
have with all this?

1291
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:44,529
That's what I am saying, sir.

1292
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,535
I and uncle don't have any
relation. - No relation at all.

1293
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,662
I have been trapped in it.
- I need your help, sir. Please.

1294
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:52,229
This entire plan was
made by Rishi.

1295
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:54,070
Rishi and Munna took
away the shroud.

1296
01:18:54,142 --> 01:18:55,268
They seized it and escaped
in the truck.

1297
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:56,402
In fact I say Rishi should
be sentenced...

1298
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:57,274
...to lifetime imprisonment.

1299
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:59,405
Hold on a minute.
When they ran away in the truck...

1300
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:01,540
...then how did you escape?
- I didn't board the truck, sir.

1301
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:02,641
I came running to you.

1302
01:19:02,718 --> 01:19:05,744
But Usmaan's men chased me
instead of chasing the truck, sir.

1303
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:06,810
Who is this Usmaan?

1304
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:07,783
Usmaan is the person who is
wrapped in the shroud.

1305
01:19:07,856 --> 01:19:08,584
The shroud is in the truck.

1306
01:19:08,657 --> 01:19:10,124
It is uncle's men who have
run away with the truck.

1307
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:11,853
Enough! Are you saying the truth?

1308
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,118
I swear by my mummy,
I am telling the truth, sir.

1309
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:25,603
You, fools.

1310
01:19:26,275 --> 01:19:29,369
First of all tell me who
thought of the idea...

1311
01:19:29,611 --> 01:19:31,841
...to hijack the funeral.

1312
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,479
Boss. Me.

1313
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,607
It's me.

1314
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:38,785
You fool. You.

1315
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:41,655
Don't you eat dates these days?

1316
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:44,122
Just because there's 'Military'
in your name...

1317
01:19:44,192 --> 01:19:48,652
...will you make my friend's dead
body parade on the streets?

1318
01:19:50,065 --> 01:19:51,089
Boss

1319
01:19:51,366 --> 01:19:52,628
It was a mistake, please.

1320
01:19:52,734 --> 01:19:54,429
You didn't make a mistake.

1321
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:58,766
I did.
- Useless. Fool. Stupid. - Boss, no.

1322
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,441
Whenever boss is angry...

1323
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:07,572
...he starts slapping himself.
- Strange.

1324
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:10,376
He slaps himself when he is angry.

1325
01:20:10,752 --> 01:20:13,585
And he slaps us when he is happy.

1326
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:16,850
Uncle. - Listen to us once.

1327
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:19,683
We didn't know you
will be so hurt...

1328
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:21,353
...about uncle Usmaan's death.

1329
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:23,631
Are you feeling fine? - Yes.
- That is good.

1330
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:25,860
I have managed to control
my anger...

1331
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:27,068
...after keeping my head on the
pillow. - Good, good, good.

1332
01:20:27,135 --> 01:20:28,602
Drink the water. - Were you hurt?

1333
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,338
Boss, you can hit me with
anything affectionately...

1334
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,465
...and I won't mind.
- You made me happy.

1335
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,334
You made me happy.

1336
01:20:36,411 --> 01:20:37,469
You made me happy.

1337
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:39,738
Why are you crying?

1338
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:41,479
These are tears of joy.

1339
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:42,743
Okay, now take it off.

1340
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:44,343
Not your clothes.

1341
01:20:44,453 --> 01:20:45,750
Get the diamonds from this.

1342
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:54,590
Great.

1343
01:20:55,163 --> 01:20:56,221
Now throw it away.

1344
01:20:56,665 --> 01:20:58,257
Not the diamond.
Thrown the pillow.

1345
01:21:00,302 --> 01:21:02,463
Boss, here comes your hero.

1346
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,436
Come on. - You really troubled us.

1347
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:05,666
Come on, stand straight.

1348
01:21:09,878 --> 01:21:10,902
Stop.

1349
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:14,315
No, uncle. - Mother.

1350
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,607
Mother.

1351
01:21:16,885 --> 01:21:17,909
You were amazing.

1352
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,284
I mean you were really amazing.

1353
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,288
What a feat you have achieved.
- Really, what?

1354
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:27,487
I knew that you can
never be useless.

1355
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:30,729
Military, come here to listen
to an interesting story.

1356
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:33,357
He has reminded me of my past...

1357
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:36,235
...when I learning how
to be a gangster.

1358
01:21:36,338 --> 01:21:37,703
It happened in '73.

1359
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:41,199
My consignment was supposed
to land on Versova Beach.

1360
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:42,467
Do you remember?

1361
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:43,745
You do remember.

1362
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:47,713
Our rival gang attacked
us to get the goods.

1363
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:49,606
I fled in the car.

1364
01:21:49,818 --> 01:21:50,876
They chased me.

1365
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:52,377
Do you remember?

1366
01:21:52,688 --> 01:21:55,589
You do remember. - After that I
barged inside a police station...

1367
01:21:55,691 --> 01:21:57,124
...and they entered after me.

1368
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:58,716
They thought that I have
the consignment...

1369
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:03,197
...but my men had already fled
with the consignment.

1370
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:04,729
Do you remember? - When?

1371
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:06,493
You do remember.

1372
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:09,328
I had done such a daring feat.

1373
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:12,840
Son, by doing such a daring feat...

1374
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:15,570
...you have repeated history,
in golden words.

1375
01:22:15,777 --> 01:22:20,214
From today your chances of
marrying Shabana is brighter.

1376
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:22,607
Son, give me a kiss.

1377
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:26,651
What is wrong?
- There is no feeling in your kiss.

1378
01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:28,689
How can it be,
uncle, how can it be?

1379
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:32,791
Sorry,
uncle, but I won't lie to you.

1380
01:22:33,628 --> 01:22:36,290
I am not worthy of this praise.
- It is someone else.

1381
01:22:36,364 --> 01:22:37,388
Who is it?

1382
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,394
Rishi. - Muni (sage).

1383
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:42,294
Malhotra.
- But Rishis are normally Muni's.

1384
01:22:42,404 --> 01:22:44,372
They are Malhotra's,
uncle, Malhotra's.

1385
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,368
Rishi, why are you quiet?
- Why are you quiet?

1386
01:22:47,442 --> 01:22:50,775
Tell uncle that the entire
master plan was yours.

1387
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:53,244
What nonsense are you blabbering?
- Nonsense.

1388
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:55,282
We were stuck in a messy
situation, uncle.

1389
01:22:55,383 --> 01:22:57,476
I thought we can never
get out of it.

1390
01:22:57,753 --> 01:23:01,245
But, Rishi.
You have such a sharp mind, Rishi.

1391
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:03,253
Truly great. - Tell them.

1392
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:07,317
Tell, Uncle, that you told me to
hide in the police station...

1393
01:23:07,429 --> 01:23:09,624
...so that you can bring
the pillow to uncle.

1394
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,393
Tell uncle that the entire
master plan...

1395
01:23:11,466 --> 01:23:15,493
...to destroy all the members of
the rival gang... was yours.

1396
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:17,534
Was it mine or yours? - Angry.

1397
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:21,905
I executed it but the
basic plan was yours.

1398
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,475
And I can never take your
share of credit, Rishi.

1399
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:29,817
This was your idea
and you are quiet.

1400
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:32,482
Where did you learn this
sacrificing nature?

1401
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:33,815
It's from childhood, uncle.

1402
01:23:33,922 --> 01:23:36,618
That is why I am saying that...

1403
01:23:36,691 --> 01:23:38,352
...the rightful person
for this love...

1404
01:23:38,426 --> 01:23:40,758
...you were showering on me
is Rishi. - Bless you, son.

1405
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:42,521
Bless you.

1406
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:44,059
I knew it.

1407
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:46,134
He can be useless.

1408
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,600
But you will always be useful.

1409
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:50,228
Rishi.

1410
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:52,597
What are you starting at, Rishi?
- Give uncle a hug.

1411
01:23:52,707 --> 01:23:55,198
Don't you see how happy uncle is?

1412
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:59,474
Son, Shabana will be so
happy to know this.

1413
01:24:00,549 --> 01:24:01,880
I always knew.

1414
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:04,118
Rishi's are very smart.

1415
01:24:04,219 --> 01:24:05,447
Move your hands, son.

1416
01:24:05,554 --> 01:24:07,522
Let me pull your cheeks.

1417
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:10,723
Please, son. Please, son.

1418
01:24:11,326 --> 01:24:12,350
Please, son.

1419
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:14,461
Very good. Very good.

1420
01:24:14,563 --> 01:24:16,622
Very good. Very good.

1421
01:24:16,731 --> 01:24:19,291
Rishi, have this chicken.
- No, thank you.

1422
01:24:19,367 --> 01:24:20,493
Why are you saying Thank you?

1423
01:24:20,569 --> 01:24:22,298
I have saved this leg
piece for you.

1424
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:23,628
Here.

1425
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,874
And curd. - There is no more curd.

1426
01:24:28,143 --> 01:24:30,577
Get us some curd. - Enough.

1427
01:24:30,912 --> 01:24:32,277
Stop your flattery.

1428
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:34,441
Now I know your stature.

1429
01:24:34,549 --> 01:24:37,677
You try to flee and tell uncle
that It was my idea.

1430
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:38,810
Rogue.

1431
01:24:39,688 --> 01:24:40,780
You are right, Rishi.

1432
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:44,352
I am a rogue,
scoundrel and a lowly man.

1433
01:24:45,327 --> 01:24:46,817
There is no comparison between us.

1434
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:49,594
I thought about it,
Rishi, and realised that...

1435
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:52,189
...you deserve Shabana
more than me.

1436
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:54,529
And you deserve freedom, isn't it?

1437
01:24:54,836 --> 01:24:56,736
I should rot between these
low-class gangsters.

1438
01:24:57,372 --> 01:24:59,431
And you will live comfortably
outside.

1439
01:25:00,108 --> 01:25:01,132
Isn't it?

1440
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:04,474
Though you are such a great man...

1441
01:25:04,579 --> 01:25:06,240
...you passed such a cheap comment.

1442
01:25:06,848 --> 01:25:09,078
Just think of all the things
you have done for Shabana.

1443
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:10,309
You even hit me.

1444
01:25:10,785 --> 01:25:11,809
What have I done?

1445
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:15,656
Shabana can never repay what
you did for her. - Me?

1446
01:25:15,724 --> 01:25:17,191
I am completely sure, Kartik.

1447
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:20,590
Shabana and you will
always be happy.

1448
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:23,697
No, Rishi, I am sure.

1449
01:25:24,299 --> 01:25:27,200
That you will always
keep Shabana happy.

1450
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:29,130
Okay. - See.

1451
01:25:29,537 --> 01:25:32,199
You two are confused as well,
aren't you? - A lot.

1452
01:25:32,807 --> 01:25:34,832
I came here to thank you two...

1453
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:36,804
...that instead of running
away you two...

1454
01:25:36,878 --> 01:25:38,607
...are going through
with this trial.

1455
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:41,543
We are not, he is making us.
- What?

1456
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:43,743
No, no, nothing.

1457
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:46,085
Look what I brought?

1458
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:49,290
Pudding.
- I made it myself. - Really.

1459
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,717
Today is a press conference.

1460
01:25:52,193 --> 01:25:55,685
And I know that Riya will
insult me publicly.

1461
01:25:56,298 --> 01:25:57,856
About the number of
films she signed...

1462
01:25:58,099 --> 01:25:59,623
...the number of endorsements
she signed.

1463
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:02,534
And,
Shabana, what have you signed?

1464
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:06,373
Forget it, I am not going.

1465
01:26:07,142 --> 01:26:09,838
Oh, no. You should really go
for the press conference.

1466
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:11,773
Yes, you must go and you
must speak the truth.

1467
01:26:11,846 --> 01:26:13,438
That you are getting married.

1468
01:26:14,683 --> 01:26:16,344
With whom? - With Rishi.
- With Kartik.

1469
01:26:17,752 --> 01:26:18,776
How sweet.

1470
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,883
But only uncle will
take that decision.

1471
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:23,851
You two just work hard.

1472
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:25,149
Okay.

1473
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,194
I will tell you where you
need to work hard.

1474
01:26:27,295 --> 01:26:29,286
Boss wants to avenge
Shabana's defeat...

1475
01:26:30,098 --> 01:26:32,328
...so you just need to kidnap
someone today, that is all.

1476
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:35,401
Kidnap? Whom? - Riya. Riya Dixit.

1477
01:26:35,503 --> 01:26:37,266
It's the name of a girl.

1478
01:26:37,372 --> 01:26:39,431
Keep the car running,
the petrol is expensive.

1479
01:26:41,142 --> 01:26:42,837
Understood? - Very good.

1480
01:26:43,211 --> 01:26:44,769
Keep your mouths open
and eyes closed.

1481
01:26:46,047 --> 01:26:48,038
Why?
- You have come to a blind school...

1482
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:49,741
...so you should look
like blind men.

1483
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:52,713
Don't see or hear anything.
- Just understand.

1484
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:54,712
How will we do this kidnapping?

1485
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:56,316
They are really crazy?

1486
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:57,688
We will have to think
of something quickly.

1487
01:26:57,759 --> 01:27:00,592
Otherwise Bittu.
He will put out a hit on us.

1488
01:27:01,563 --> 01:27:02,587
Look.

1489
01:27:02,664 --> 01:27:04,791
Open the sticks, open the sticks.

1490
01:27:08,336 --> 01:27:09,769
Carefully, carefully. - Sorry.

1491
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:12,864
Sorry. - And my name is Shabana.

1492
01:27:20,849 --> 01:27:24,546
Hello, we are here in Navyug Blind
school's 50th anniversary.

1493
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:27,220
Where the beauty queen of
Paradise Entertainment...

1494
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:31,323
...Shabana Raza has announced
her marriage.

1495
01:27:33,094 --> 01:27:34,288
This is shocking news.

1496
01:27:34,529 --> 01:27:37,123
What is the reason of taking
such a big step suddenly?

1497
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:40,591
Is it the influence of politics
in beauty pageant?

1498
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:43,201
Sister, where is the toilet?

1499
01:27:43,471 --> 01:27:45,132
Just a minute,
I will take you there.

1500
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:47,538
Wait. - Just look after
him. - You are so nice.

1501
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:49,610
Come on. You want to go as well.

1502
01:27:50,178 --> 01:27:51,805
Yes. - Come on. Let's go, brother.

1503
01:27:54,049 --> 01:27:55,141
Walk together.

1504
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:59,080
Hello, gorgeous. You two.

1505
01:27:59,754 --> 01:28:02,086
Here? - Where have you guys been?

1506
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:04,723
We two were actually slightly
busy. - Busy.

1507
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,321
We just came here to
congratulate you.

1508
01:28:07,429 --> 01:28:08,589
Congratulations my foot.

1509
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:11,359
I won the contest and she
is being photographed.

1510
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,700
Look, we have a great idea.

1511
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:16,633
And this way your photographs...

1512
01:28:17,105 --> 01:28:18,766
...will be everywhere. - Oh, really.

1513
01:28:19,374 --> 01:28:23,105
How? - Someone kidnapped
Riya after the contest.

1514
01:28:23,445 --> 01:28:25,436
Think about it.
Understand. - What rubbish?

1515
01:28:25,547 --> 01:28:26,571
Not rubbish.

1516
01:28:26,881 --> 01:28:28,781
Now think, media frenzy.

1517
01:28:28,883 --> 01:28:32,683
Channels. - Newspapers. - Sympathy.
- Page three. Page one.

1518
01:28:32,754 --> 01:28:33,778
Exactly.

1519
01:28:34,622 --> 01:28:36,590
Think about it.
- You will be all over.

1520
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:39,752
Move back. Move. Save me. Save me.

1521
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:43,194
Move back.

1522
01:28:45,567 --> 01:28:48,161
You think this idea will work.
- I don't know.

1523
01:28:48,269 --> 01:28:50,169
But our job is done.
- What do you mean?

1524
01:28:50,271 --> 01:28:52,796
We had to kidnap you and so
we did. - Kidnap, what?

1525
01:28:53,074 --> 01:28:55,565
Yes, we got kidnapped first
and now you. - Welcome.

1526
01:28:55,643 --> 01:28:57,133
But why did you kidnap me?

1527
01:28:57,245 --> 01:28:59,213
So that when you aren't there
then Shabana can go...

1528
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,304
...for the international
pageant in your place.

1529
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:02,315
That's why? Understood.
- Now be seated quietly.

1530
01:29:05,487 --> 01:29:06,681
The job is done.

1531
01:29:06,788 --> 01:29:09,780
Can we take her back?
- What is the hurry?

1532
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:12,785
No, Munna... - But the job is done.

1533
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:14,123
Can we take her back?

1534
01:29:14,295 --> 01:29:15,626
What will she do outside?

1535
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:20,056
Munna. Carefully. - Everyone.

1536
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:21,159
Munna. - Munna.

1537
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:22,362
Munna. - Just a minute.

1538
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,502
Your sister-in-law is here.

1539
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:29,767
Song.

1540
01:29:30,545 --> 01:29:31,569
Start.

1541
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:32,837
Play it. Play it.

1542
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,380
Don't worry, we are there.

1543
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,517
Just a minute.

1544
01:29:53,568 --> 01:29:56,628
Damsels.
There are so many stories.

1545
01:29:57,205 --> 01:29:59,332
Skimpy minis.

1546
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:00,665
Take them little.

1547
01:30:00,742 --> 01:30:01,800
Shake them little.

1548
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:04,374
Rock and roll.

1549
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:06,674
A little hip-hop too.

1550
01:30:06,848 --> 01:30:09,282
A little English words.

1551
01:30:10,151 --> 01:30:12,119
Swing, do you think it shows.

1552
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,415
Hey smart alec, now I know you.

1553
01:30:14,722 --> 01:30:18,089
Come a little closer.
- My sights wander.

1554
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:19,251
It searches for you.

1555
01:30:19,327 --> 01:30:22,262
Big brother,
play that big boom box louder.

1556
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:24,621
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1557
01:30:24,732 --> 01:30:26,529
Thank you for this song.

1558
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:31,502
Thank you to the baby for
dancing all night long.

1559
01:30:31,806 --> 01:30:34,274
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1560
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:36,468
Thank you for this song.

1561
01:30:36,578 --> 01:30:41,606
Thank you to the baby for
dancing all night long.

1562
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,855
I am like gold.

1563
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:56,695
Touch me in a way.

1564
01:30:56,898 --> 01:31:01,198
Get me dancing to the song.

1565
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:04,168
I am like gold.

1566
01:31:04,372 --> 01:31:06,397
Touch me in a way.

1567
01:31:06,774 --> 01:31:12,212
Get me dancing to the song.

1568
01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:18,278
Today is your chance,
who is stopping you.

1569
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:23,520
Ask for millions,
who is stopping you.

1570
01:31:23,925 --> 01:31:28,328
Today is your chance,
who is stopping you.

1571
01:31:29,163 --> 01:31:33,156
Ask for millions,
who is stopping you.

1572
01:31:33,268 --> 01:31:37,204
The heart's happy, jolly, peppy.

1573
01:31:37,438 --> 01:31:40,601
My heart's stuck on your gait.

1574
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:43,302
Big brother,
play that big boom box louder.

1575
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:45,311
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1576
01:31:45,413 --> 01:31:47,608
Thank you for this song.

1577
01:31:48,182 --> 01:31:52,744
Thank you to the baby for
dancing all night long.

1578
01:31:52,854 --> 01:31:55,186
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1579
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:57,485
Thank you for this song.

1580
01:31:57,725 --> 01:32:02,753
Thank you to the baby for
dancing all night long.

1581
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:14,904
Live freely today.

1582
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,640
Drink from the cup of life.

1583
01:32:17,845 --> 01:32:22,782
Only for you I am going to
dance all night long.

1584
01:32:22,884 --> 01:32:24,715
Live freely today.

1585
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:27,551
Drink from the cup of life.

1586
01:32:27,755 --> 01:32:32,590
Only for you I am going to
dance all night long.

1587
01:32:35,196 --> 01:32:39,565
I will make an explosion
lost in the enthusiasm.

1588
01:32:40,134 --> 01:32:44,434
I will raid the locker
of your heart, baby.

1589
01:32:44,872 --> 01:32:49,536
I will make an explosion
lost in the enthusiasm.

1590
01:32:49,844 --> 01:32:53,439
I will raid the locker
of your heart, baby.

1591
01:32:53,548 --> 01:32:57,746
The heart's happy, jolly, peppy.

1592
01:32:58,386 --> 01:33:01,082
My heart's stuck on your gait.

1593
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:04,124
Big brother,
play that big boom box louder.

1594
01:33:04,225 --> 01:33:06,193
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1595
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:08,691
Thank you for this song.

1596
01:33:08,896 --> 01:33:13,731
Thank you to the baby for
dancing all night long.

1597
01:33:13,835 --> 01:33:16,133
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1598
01:33:16,404 --> 01:33:18,463
Thank you for this song.

1599
01:33:18,673 --> 01:33:23,235
Thank you to the baby for
dancing all night long.

1600
01:33:23,678 --> 01:33:25,578
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1601
01:33:28,616 --> 01:33:30,345
Thank you, Mr. DJ.

1602
01:33:32,887 --> 01:33:35,412
Hey smart alec, now I know you.

1603
01:33:37,692 --> 01:33:40,627
My sights wander.
- It searches for you.

1604
01:33:40,695 --> 01:33:43,596
Big brother,
play that big boom box louder.

1605
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,638
Shabana.
- Shabana, what are you doing?

1606
01:33:52,407 --> 01:33:54,068
Shabana, I am sorry, Shabana.

1607
01:33:54,442 --> 01:33:57,104
Listen to me, Shabana.
- Shabana, at least tell us...

1608
01:33:57,178 --> 01:33:58,645
...are these apples from
Kashmir or Himachal?

1609
01:33:58,713 --> 01:34:00,874
From hell.
Where you two are headed.

1610
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:03,310
I trusted you two.

1611
01:34:03,418 --> 01:34:05,682
And I thought that you
two only love me.

1612
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:08,788
But I didn't know that you two are
like the rest of the boys...

1613
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:12,758
...vagabond, girl-chasers, rogues...

1614
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:14,487
Shameless. - Shameless.

1615
01:34:14,595 --> 01:34:15,823
Brazen. - Brazen.

1616
01:34:16,831 --> 01:34:18,765
I hate you. - I hate you two.

1617
01:34:18,866 --> 01:34:22,165
And, Munna, it was your
responsibility. - What were you doing?

1618
01:34:22,236 --> 01:34:24,136
Shabana,
these children are innocent.

1619
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:25,705
And you know our gang.

1620
01:34:25,807 --> 01:34:27,297
The girl is from a good family.

1621
01:34:27,508 --> 01:34:29,305
But the problem was
that they never...

1622
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:30,742
...saw such a live dance before.

1623
01:34:30,845 --> 01:34:32,506
They only saw it on television...

1624
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,172
...that is why they slipped,
that's all.

1625
01:34:34,248 --> 01:34:35,840
But my fingers won't slip.

1626
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:38,250
Three, two... - No.

1627
01:34:38,352 --> 01:34:39,876
One. - Shabana!

1628
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:44,824
Goodbye...

1629
01:34:46,694 --> 01:34:48,662
See, you said One, two, three.

1630
01:34:49,197 --> 01:34:51,859
And I fired the bullets.
- That's called coordination.

1631
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:55,796
Uncle, you...
Fired. - Uncle. - Thank you.

1632
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:58,566
Uncle, I saw him myself
helping the girl elope.

1633
01:34:58,639 --> 01:34:59,435
What nonsense are you blabbering?

1634
01:34:59,507 --> 01:35:00,565
Shut up, I haven't finished yet.

1635
01:35:00,641 --> 01:35:03,610
Uncle, he isn't just a thief
but a cheat and a deceiver.

1636
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:06,736
When the time comes he can
deceive you as well.

1637
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:09,373
Uncle, he is the biggest cheater
around this factory.

1638
01:35:10,651 --> 01:35:11,675
After you.

1639
01:35:11,786 --> 01:35:13,413
Rishi is absolutely right, Uncle.

1640
01:35:13,855 --> 01:35:16,517
I am a big cheat.

1641
01:35:16,624 --> 01:35:18,148
You just reject me.

1642
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:21,592
And get Shabana married to Rishi.

1643
01:35:22,363 --> 01:35:23,660
Congrats, Rishi. Congrats.

1644
01:35:24,765 --> 01:35:26,357
Calm down, son. Calm down.

1645
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:29,898
We will know who is honest
once the truth is out.

1646
01:35:30,671 --> 01:35:34,198
Take a look,
today's news in the papers.

1647
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:36,440
Military.
I won't invite you separately.

1648
01:35:36,544 --> 01:35:37,568
Come here. Come on.

1649
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:39,908
Read what's written here?
- What is written?

1650
01:35:40,348 --> 01:35:42,543
Its written that Riya
has been eliminated...

1651
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:43,584
...from the beauty pageant.

1652
01:35:43,651 --> 01:35:46,313
Riya has been eliminated
from the beauty pageant.

1653
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:49,184
Because she spread the false
rumour of her kidnapping.

1654
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:51,815
Because she spread the false
rumour of her kidnapping.

1655
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:53,822
Now my Shabana will win the crown.

1656
01:35:54,095 --> 01:35:56,290
Now my Shabana will win the crown.

1657
01:35:56,697 --> 01:35:58,528
This is not written here,
I am saying this.

1658
01:35:58,866 --> 01:36:00,060
Idiot.

1659
01:36:00,134 --> 01:36:03,501
Kartik. You really turned
out to be a big rogue.

1660
01:36:03,604 --> 01:36:07,233
If a rogue, scoundrel, and
a crook joins our gang...

1661
01:36:07,508 --> 01:36:10,705
...then our gang will be famous
in the entire world.

1662
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:12,472
That was great.

1663
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:15,208
I mean you were great. - No, no.

1664
01:36:15,316 --> 01:36:16,510
You were great.

1665
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:18,443
Give me a kiss, son.

1666
01:36:20,087 --> 01:36:22,282
What is wrong?
- There is no feeling in your kiss.

1667
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:25,591
That is okay.
- Sometimes the feeling is there...

1668
01:36:25,693 --> 01:36:28,457
...but it seems as its not there.
- Isn't it, Shri? - Rishi.

1669
01:36:28,529 --> 01:36:29,826
Gyani (Intelligent).
- No, Malhotra.

1670
01:36:29,897 --> 01:36:32,365
But Rishis are normally Gyani's.
- That is fine.

1671
01:36:32,466 --> 01:36:33,899
Look, Kajuputra. Badamputra.

1672
01:36:34,302 --> 01:36:37,135
The competition between you
two has become very tough.

1673
01:36:37,238 --> 01:36:39,365
Now only after you pass
the next test...

1674
01:36:39,473 --> 01:36:43,239
...I will reach a verdict about
who Shabana should marry.

1675
01:36:43,611 --> 01:36:46,079
Military,
here Shabana will get married...

1676
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:47,511
...and go to her husband's home.

1677
01:36:47,582 --> 01:36:50,142
And here I will retire
and leave for Kabul.

1678
01:36:50,251 --> 01:36:52,776
I have got my passport.

1679
01:36:53,054 --> 01:36:56,581
Directly to Lon...
- Great. - What happened?

1680
01:36:56,657 --> 01:36:58,420
I haven't reached Kabul yet...

1681
01:36:58,759 --> 01:37:01,159
...and you directly boarded
a flight for London.

1682
01:37:01,262 --> 01:37:03,696
I got down, I got down.

1683
01:37:04,599 --> 01:37:06,863
Who will look after
the business later?

1684
01:37:07,301 --> 01:37:08,393
Won't we be tense?

1685
01:37:08,502 --> 01:37:10,163
I was thinking I will go...

1686
01:37:10,271 --> 01:37:11,295
Don't think.

1687
01:37:11,672 --> 01:37:13,105
You just do your work.

1688
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:16,074
Shell out your passport.

1689
01:37:16,143 --> 01:37:17,337
You want to see it. - Yes.

1690
01:37:18,379 --> 01:37:20,313
Take a look. - It's a new one. New.

1691
01:37:21,482 --> 01:37:22,506
Absolutely new.

1692
01:37:24,218 --> 01:37:26,550
Here,
I have given you a permanent visa.

1693
01:37:26,654 --> 01:37:28,315
You can go anywhere you want.

1694
01:37:28,422 --> 01:37:30,720
Take a look.

1695
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:35,219
Lie on your bed and look.

1696
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:39,655
Watch the Qutub Minar
of Kathmandu.

1697
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:41,891
India. India.

1698
01:37:42,269 --> 01:37:44,669
You are talking about yourself.
- Think about us as well.

1699
01:37:45,306 --> 01:37:46,500
We had so many dreams.

1700
01:37:46,607 --> 01:37:48,666
We were going to be the
vice-president of this company.

1701
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:52,202
I had heard that love makes a
man achieve great heights.

1702
01:37:52,413 --> 01:37:56,247
But look at where love brought us.

1703
01:37:57,351 --> 01:37:59,717
Now you tell us,
Munna, what should we do?

1704
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:01,554
How do we get out of here?

1705
01:38:02,523 --> 01:38:05,458
The boss needs some time to think.

1706
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,789
Today is a conference of dons.

1707
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:10,290
Though he is one of boss's men...

1708
01:38:10,398 --> 01:38:12,423
...but he was instigating
others against the boss.

1709
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:13,724
But remember

1710
01:38:14,335 --> 01:38:16,394
Don't you dare mention
about last night.

1711
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:19,436
Come on. - How much do you
talk on the mobile?

1712
01:38:24,078 --> 01:38:25,568
Munna. - Come on here.

1713
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,704
Come sit here.

1714
01:38:27,348 --> 01:38:28,872
Take your seat.
- What is wrong, Munna?

1715
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:30,681
Who are these two boys?

1716
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:34,644
They are no boys but the
boss's son-in-law.

1717
01:38:35,156 --> 01:38:37,283
By the way, I am Krishnan.

1718
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,115
Rishi. - Kartik.

1719
01:38:39,226 --> 01:38:40,784
Salim Lichhad. - Pawan Dhua.

1720
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:42,089
I am Qazi Lenden.

1721
01:38:42,263 --> 01:38:44,197
I am Pakya. I speak English.

1722
01:38:44,298 --> 01:38:46,289
Maqbool. Maqbool.

1723
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
Omkara.

1724
01:38:48,803 --> 01:38:49,827
Quiet.

1725
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:53,630
Munna, any special reason for
calling us in this meeting?

1726
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:55,675
The answer to all your
questions is in this.

1727
01:38:56,444 --> 01:38:58,435
When this rings all the secrets
will be revealed.

1728
01:38:58,546 --> 01:39:00,844
Why does the boss always
stay away from us?

1729
01:39:01,082 --> 01:39:02,413
Why doesn't he speak
to us personally?

1730
01:39:02,483 --> 01:39:04,417
I don't understand this video.

1731
01:39:04,852 --> 01:39:06,444
Maqbool. Maqbool. Maqbool.

1732
01:39:06,554 --> 01:39:09,182
Actually there are lot of risks
in business these days.

1733
01:39:09,256 --> 01:39:10,587
And the boss doesn't
want to play...

1734
01:39:10,658 --> 01:39:13,650
...the game of cops and robbers
after watching his health.

1735
01:39:15,196 --> 01:39:19,257
My dear gangster brothers.

1736
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,694
I want to make an important
announcement to all of you.

1737
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:28,098
You do know that I am tired
of running from the police.

1738
01:39:28,576 --> 01:39:30,134
My ankles are giving up.

1739
01:39:30,778 --> 01:39:32,803
I am losing weight as well.

1740
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:37,247
So I have decided to retire.

1741
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:39,114
But before retiring I want to...

1742
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:42,519
...reshuffle the cabinet
of my gang.

1743
01:39:42,623 --> 01:39:44,352
Qazi,
you will handle the quarrel...

1744
01:39:44,425 --> 01:39:46,086
...beating and murder department.

1745
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:50,296
Maqbool, all the extortion
dens will be under you.

1746
01:39:50,564 --> 01:39:54,330
Pakya, you will handle the
kidnapping and ransom department.

1747
01:39:54,602 --> 01:39:56,763
And, Krishnan, smuggling.

1748
01:39:57,037 --> 01:39:58,766
So my gangster brothers.

1749
01:39:59,206 --> 01:40:02,437
Go, and become the bosses
of your own business.

1750
01:40:02,543 --> 01:40:03,567
Have fun.

1751
01:40:03,644 --> 01:40:06,340
Not today. Tomorrow.

1752
01:40:07,148 --> 01:40:09,844
Tomorrow is my niece Shabana's
happy birthday.

1753
01:40:10,284 --> 01:40:12,582
And I am going to announce
her engagement as well.

1754
01:40:13,687 --> 01:40:15,279
I will announce her engagement...

1755
01:40:15,389 --> 01:40:18,051
...and then return to
my country Kabul.

1756
01:40:18,459 --> 01:40:20,620
Wow. - Congratulations.

1757
01:40:20,694 --> 01:40:22,184
Now we will get a bigger share.

1758
01:40:22,596 --> 01:40:24,120
You are a don now too.

1759
01:40:24,331 --> 01:40:26,299
Congratulations, Maqbool sir.
You are now a don.

1760
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,698
Qazi sir, many, many congrats.
- Thank you.

1761
01:40:29,136 --> 01:40:30,694
Sir, we want a treat now. - I will.

1762
01:40:30,805 --> 01:40:33,239
You must have at least
25% stake now. - 25%?

1763
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:36,366
In a corporate deal it should
be at least 50%.

1764
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:39,545
No, I think the last I heard it
was somewhere between 25-30%.

1765
01:40:39,613 --> 01:40:42,605
No, I think it's been changed.
- Amendment 2B. - Absolutely.

1766
01:40:43,717 --> 01:40:45,275
What are these sons-in-law saying?

1767
01:40:46,687 --> 01:40:49,383
They are talking about business.
- Both of them are B. Com.

1768
01:40:49,857 --> 01:40:51,791
MBA. - MBA.

1769
01:40:53,427 --> 01:40:56,294
Yes. MBA. - See,
basically what I mean to say is...

1770
01:40:56,397 --> 01:40:59,298
...now you must have at least
50% stake in export-import.

1771
01:40:59,366 --> 01:41:01,095
What are they saying?
- Meaning partnership.

1772
01:41:01,168 --> 01:41:02,829
You must have at least
50% partnership.

1773
01:41:02,903 --> 01:41:07,363
Yes. - No, no, son-in-law. - We
will now get 10%. - 10%!

1774
01:41:07,474 --> 01:41:09,499
But, Kartik, 10% is nothing. - Yes.

1775
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:12,204
Of the 10%, 47% will be office
expenses. - Exactly.

1776
01:41:12,313 --> 01:41:13,803
.5% will be conveyance. - Correct.

1777
01:41:13,914 --> 01:41:17,577
And 2% will be personal expenses.
- Oh my, God.

1778
01:41:17,685 --> 01:41:19,812
This is unbelievable.

1779
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,616
I need a board.
You will soon know.

1780
01:41:23,858 --> 01:41:25,257
Yes, the board is here.

1781
01:41:25,593 --> 01:41:27,151
Chalk. Give me a chalk.

1782
01:41:27,728 --> 01:41:29,491
But what are they trying
to explain us?

1783
01:41:30,231 --> 01:41:32,665
Your share is 10%.
- Now calculate the expenses.

1784
01:41:32,733 --> 01:41:34,394
.7% office expenses. - Plus.

1785
01:41:34,501 --> 01:41:37,595
.5% personal expenses. - .5%.

1786
01:41:37,838 --> 01:41:41,797
2% conveyance. - 2% plus 1.5%
for education of children.

1787
01:41:41,909 --> 01:41:44,207
And unforeseen expenses
like marriage...

1788
01:41:44,278 --> 01:41:45,802
...final rites, and birthdays.

1789
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,104
Approximately 1%.

1790
01:41:47,214 --> 01:41:50,206
Plus... Do you have any investment?
- No. - Insurance?

1791
01:41:50,284 --> 01:41:52,718
SIP, mutual funds.
- We have none. - PPF. - No.

1792
01:41:53,554 --> 01:41:55,749
They don't have any investment.
- They don't have any saving.

1793
01:41:55,856 --> 01:41:58,552
Son-in-law, is everything fine?
- Nothing is fine.

1794
01:41:58,626 --> 01:42:00,116
The income is 10% and
expenditure is...

1795
01:42:00,194 --> 01:42:02,355
...approximately 11.4%. - Exactly.

1796
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:06,327
Meaning. - It means sine theta
upon cosine theta...

1797
01:42:06,433 --> 01:42:08,458
...equals to tang theta.

1798
01:42:08,869 --> 01:42:10,336
Doctors.

1799
01:42:10,571 --> 01:42:13,438
Look into my eyes and tell
me will they be fine?

1800
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,632
How can they be fine?

1801
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:16,903
If they don't get tan theta,
then death.

1802
01:42:17,311 --> 01:42:19,211
House loan.
They will lose their houses.

1803
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,338
They will lose their
wife's jewellery.

1804
01:42:20,414 --> 01:42:21,745
They children will have
to live on the streets.

1805
01:42:21,815 --> 01:42:23,680
And they will ask you with
tears in their eyes...

1806
01:42:23,751 --> 01:42:27,812
...that Papa, papa, why did
you give birth to us.

1807
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:32,484
Sons-in-law.
- We want this tan theta as well.

1808
01:42:32,593 --> 01:42:33,821
Isn't it, brothers?

1809
01:42:33,928 --> 01:42:36,829
We want it, don't we? - Yes, yes.
We want it. - I want it too.

1810
01:42:36,897 --> 01:42:39,229
You want it too. - You will get
it. - Forget this tan theta.

1811
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,392
I want a share in the diamonds.

1812
01:42:40,467 --> 01:42:42,833
Qazi, when will I get a
share in the diamonds?

1813
01:42:42,937 --> 01:42:44,302
What are you saying?

1814
01:42:44,672 --> 01:42:46,196
I don't have the diamonds.

1815
01:42:46,774 --> 01:42:47,866
He might know.

1816
01:42:48,142 --> 01:42:50,133
I don't have the diamonds.

1817
01:42:50,244 --> 01:42:53,077
Uncle Usman would know about the
diamonds. - Silent everyone.

1818
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:56,411
First find out who took the
diamonds from Usmaan. - Find out.

1819
01:42:56,483 --> 01:43:00,214
Otherwise I won't spare anyone.
- Why don't you all understand?

1820
01:43:00,321 --> 01:43:02,118
The boss is duping us all.

1821
01:43:02,456 --> 01:43:04,549
Munna, go and tell the boss...

1822
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:05,785
...that we want to talk
to him personally.

1823
01:43:05,859 --> 01:43:08,293
Pakya.
Don't say anything about the boss.

1824
01:43:08,595 --> 01:43:09,687
He is like my father.

1825
01:43:10,297 --> 01:43:12,492
My father was crazy and
so is your boss.

1826
01:43:12,766 --> 01:43:14,631
Boss's sycophant,
don't make me lose my mind.

1827
01:43:14,735 --> 01:43:17,465
Munna, tell the boss that we
want a share in the diamond.

1828
01:43:17,905 --> 01:43:19,839
This... this 10% won't do.

1829
01:43:20,274 --> 01:43:22,367
Otherwise I will kill everyone.

1830
01:43:30,651 --> 01:43:31,675
Tell him, Munna.

1831
01:43:31,885 --> 01:43:34,217
How these two boys ruined
uncle's entire plan...

1832
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:36,448
...in the conference.
- What do I say?

1833
01:43:36,523 --> 01:43:38,286
They started speaking in English.
- I was tensed.

1834
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:40,793
Don't be tensed,
Military, don't be tensed.

1835
01:43:41,261 --> 01:43:44,196
Thankfully they uttered nonsense
in the conference.

1836
01:43:44,431 --> 01:43:47,229
At least I know who is loyal
and who is not in my gang.

1837
01:43:47,301 --> 01:43:48,495
Yes, I found out as well.

1838
01:43:48,569 --> 01:43:51,094
Uncle, if these jokers ruined
your game once...

1839
01:43:51,171 --> 01:43:53,298
...then what is the guarantee
that they won't do it again.

1840
01:43:53,374 --> 01:43:55,569
Uncle,
they aren't fit for Shabana.

1841
01:43:56,276 --> 01:43:58,141
Congratulations. - What happened?

1842
01:43:58,245 --> 01:43:59,769
For the first time Nandu
said something.

1843
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,347
And he said the right thing.

1844
01:44:01,582 --> 01:44:03,846
But, boss, who is this new boy?
- He isn't new.

1845
01:44:04,084 --> 01:44:06,416
He is my sister's son.

1846
01:44:06,653 --> 01:44:08,746
Military,
he is going to Kabul with me.

1847
01:44:08,822 --> 01:44:10,289
So get his passport made.

1848
01:44:10,357 --> 01:44:12,848
Making a passport is
a difficult job.

1849
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,455
When you are with him he
will manage everything.

1850
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:16,654
The cake is ready.

1851
01:44:18,365 --> 01:44:21,892
Come on. - Let's blow Shabana's
cake and murder it.

1852
01:44:22,603 --> 01:44:23,627
Shabana.

1853
01:44:24,271 --> 01:44:26,739
Your late father gave me
this Rampuri dagger...

1854
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,398
...on his deathbed and said...

1855
01:44:28,509 --> 01:44:31,842
...Cut Shabana's 21st birthday
with this dagger.

1856
01:44:32,346 --> 01:44:35,338
And before there are
tears in my eyes...

1857
01:44:35,616 --> 01:44:39,177
...stab this cake with this
dagger and cut it.

1858
01:44:43,557 --> 01:44:46,720
Happy birthday to you.

1859
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:50,455
Happy birthday to you.

1860
01:44:50,664 --> 01:44:54,122
Happy birthday dear Shabana.

1861
01:44:54,234 --> 01:44:57,465
Happy birthday to you.

1862
01:44:58,338 --> 01:45:00,238
That was great.

1863
01:45:03,644 --> 01:45:05,202
Fire the bullets.

1864
01:45:07,081 --> 01:45:08,275
Burst the balloons.

1865
01:45:08,882 --> 01:45:12,340
Uncle. - Dear, I have diabetes.

1866
01:45:12,453 --> 01:45:13,511
But that's fine.

1867
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:16,145
When you are offering me so
affectionately then go ahead.

1868
01:45:17,291 --> 01:45:18,815
Bless you, dear. Bless you.

1869
01:45:19,226 --> 01:45:20,853
May all your wishes come true.

1870
01:45:21,428 --> 01:45:24,829
And may you get married soon.
- No, uncle.

1871
01:45:25,099 --> 01:45:26,191
We are not in a hurry.

1872
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,400
You can take your time.
- Yes, uncle.

1873
01:45:28,502 --> 01:45:30,766
And you shouldn't be hasty
in such matters.

1874
01:45:31,305 --> 01:45:34,365
But, son...
- Uncle, don't worry at all.

1875
01:45:34,908 --> 01:45:37,843
I knew that you will be
confused just like you.

1876
01:45:38,412 --> 01:45:42,781
That is why I got...
two rings made for the engagement.

1877
01:45:43,217 --> 01:45:45,344
Very good, dear. Very good.

1878
01:45:45,452 --> 01:45:48,421
Happy birthday to you.

1879
01:45:48,722 --> 01:45:51,714
Happy birthday to you.

1880
01:45:52,259 --> 01:45:57,561
Happy birthday dear Shabana.

1881
01:46:22,256 --> 01:46:23,314
What are you doing?

1882
01:46:23,724 --> 01:46:25,749
I came here to eat.
- I am trying to run.

1883
01:46:26,226 --> 01:46:27,716
There are guards everywhere.

1884
01:46:28,562 --> 01:46:30,826
I still didn't understand
the entire thing. - Yes.

1885
01:46:31,298 --> 01:46:32,856
Even after all that happened...

1886
01:46:33,133 --> 01:46:34,828
...uncle still thinks we
are his sons-in-law.

1887
01:46:35,402 --> 01:46:36,869
What else can a girl's uncle do?

1888
01:46:37,137 --> 01:46:39,128
What do you mean?
- He is helpless in this situation.

1889
01:46:39,406 --> 01:46:40,737
He isn't helpless...

1890
01:46:41,441 --> 01:46:43,204
...I feel this is something bigger.

1891
01:46:43,477 --> 01:46:47,709
Doctor Wong,
I called you here to thank you.

1892
01:46:48,749 --> 01:46:52,446
So cleverly you removed
the germs in my teeth...

1893
01:46:52,853 --> 01:46:54,616
...and filled it with diamonds.

1894
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:59,181
Now I can leave India
without any problem.

1895
01:47:05,632 --> 01:47:07,156
What is wrong with everyone?

1896
01:47:07,267 --> 01:47:09,667
Shabana's life seems
to be in trouble.

1897
01:47:09,736 --> 01:47:11,465
If you want your niece then
keep your mobile on.

1898
01:47:11,538 --> 01:47:13,802
And be at a place where you get
network. - We will call you.

1899
01:47:13,874 --> 01:47:16,434
Come on. - Come on. - But what is
the connection with the network?

1900
01:47:16,543 --> 01:47:17,567
They don't know.

1901
01:47:18,145 --> 01:47:19,442
Munna. - Munna.

1902
01:47:19,746 --> 01:47:22,442
Burst some crackers.

1903
01:47:22,549 --> 01:47:24,244
Today is my niece's
happy birthday.

1904
01:47:24,518 --> 01:47:27,578
Uncle, someone kidnapped Shabana.
- What?

1905
01:47:27,821 --> 01:47:30,654
Who dared to kidnap my niece?

1906
01:47:30,757 --> 01:47:33,089
Uncle, that brawny man Kamaal.

1907
01:47:33,193 --> 01:47:34,524
He kidnapped my niece.

1908
01:47:34,595 --> 01:47:37,428
No, no, he kidnapped
her for the diamonds.

1909
01:47:37,497 --> 01:47:39,863
And he has left this balloon
for you. - Balloon. - Yes.

1910
01:47:40,234 --> 01:47:42,134
What is written on it?
- Shall I read it? - Yes.

1911
01:47:42,269 --> 01:47:46,171
If you want your niece then send
both your sons-in-law...

1912
01:47:46,473 --> 01:47:49,806
It was written they have
to reach Dream Point...

1913
01:47:50,077 --> 01:47:51,601
...with the diamonds by 12 o'clock.

1914
01:47:57,618 --> 01:47:59,142
Both the sons-in-law are here.

1915
01:48:04,825 --> 01:48:06,122
Wonder where they are?

1916
01:48:06,727 --> 01:48:07,751
Don't want it.

1917
01:48:12,833 --> 01:48:14,391
Diamond. - Krishnan.

1918
01:48:14,501 --> 01:48:15,525
Go on.

1919
01:48:27,547 --> 01:48:28,878
They both are going up.

1920
01:48:30,284 --> 01:48:32,548
Almonds and pistachios for me.

1921
01:48:32,653 --> 01:48:35,281
And raisins and cashew
for my wife.

1922
01:48:40,227 --> 01:48:42,661
Hold this.
I will attend the phone.

1923
01:48:42,896 --> 01:48:45,763
My sweetheart,
today will be a catastrophe...

1924
01:48:45,832 --> 01:48:47,231
...today love will be disappointed
in your lane.

1925
01:48:47,301 --> 01:48:49,496
Boss, they both went to
the third floor. - Fine.

1926
01:49:08,822 --> 01:49:10,346
There are three doors here.

1927
01:49:11,391 --> 01:49:14,724
This one? - No, no.
It must be that one.

1928
01:49:15,462 --> 01:49:17,760
Have you ever been to the,
'Horror House'? - What are you saying?

1929
01:49:28,709 --> 01:49:30,540
Oh, mummy! Mummy!

1930
01:49:30,644 --> 01:49:31,736
Not, mummy but papa.

1931
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,693
I think they want to call
us at the horror house...

1932
01:49:55,802 --> 01:49:57,463
...and scare us to death
by the ghosts.

1933
01:49:57,571 --> 01:49:59,835
But you all don't get scared.
- There is nothing called ghosts.

1934
01:50:00,073 --> 01:50:01,233
It is just superstition.

1935
01:50:01,308 --> 01:50:02,400
If any ghost tries to scare you,
tell me.

1936
01:50:02,476 --> 01:50:04,034
I will teach a good lesson...

1937
01:50:07,814 --> 01:50:09,679
Mr. Kamaal,
you opened a 'Horror House'?

1938
01:50:09,783 --> 01:50:11,148
To hell with Kamaal!

1939
01:50:11,251 --> 01:50:12,548
Take away my mask first. - Yes.

1940
01:50:13,353 --> 01:50:14,581
Mr. Munna, you?!

1941
01:50:15,522 --> 01:50:16,853
Oh Gosh, ghost!

1942
01:50:17,357 --> 01:50:19,621
Don't be scared.
It is superstition.

1943
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:21,828
I am sure. - Both of you
give me the diamonds...

1944
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:24,220
...and I have arranged for
your escape. Okay?

1945
01:50:24,297 --> 01:50:26,458
But what about Shabana? - Why are
you so concerned about Shabana?

1946
01:50:26,533 --> 01:50:28,694
She is like my daughter.
- I will reach her to her uncle.

1947
01:50:29,102 --> 01:50:30,467
This is my plan!

1948
01:50:31,505 --> 01:50:33,405
It means you have kidnapped
Shabana?!

1949
01:50:35,242 --> 01:50:36,766
Who has ruined my career?

1950
01:50:36,877 --> 01:50:38,105
Uncle. - Yes.

1951
01:50:38,578 --> 01:50:40,409
Who shot a bullet on my passport?

1952
01:50:40,647 --> 01:50:41,773
Uncle. - Yes.

1953
01:50:42,315 --> 01:50:43,805
Who seized the diamonds?

1954
01:50:44,084 --> 01:50:45,142
Uncle. - Yes.

1955
01:50:45,252 --> 01:50:47,379
So whose niece will be kidnapped?

1956
01:50:47,487 --> 01:50:48,511
Whose? - Whose?

1957
01:50:49,823 --> 01:50:52,087
Uncle's! - Uncle's! - Yes! Yes! Yes!

1958
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,127
This entire plan is mine.
Give me all the diamonds.

1959
01:50:54,194 --> 01:50:55,320
The plan is yours, Munna.

1960
01:50:55,395 --> 01:50:56,885
But the real inheritors
of the diamonds...

1961
01:50:57,130 --> 01:50:59,655
...are brother Usman's nephews,
I and Vasim. - Yes. - Son-in-law...

1962
01:50:59,733 --> 01:51:02,395
...give the diamonds to us and
get your wife released.

1963
01:51:07,307 --> 01:51:09,901
If I don't shoot these ghosts and
convert them into humans...

1964
01:51:10,177 --> 01:51:11,474
...don't call me Panju Don!

1965
01:51:11,912 --> 01:51:13,345
Such a big deception!

1966
01:51:13,447 --> 01:51:15,210
Both of you have brought
uncle here?!

1967
01:51:16,616 --> 01:51:19,585
Munna sir, we didn't invite uncle
here. - We didn't. Yeah.

1968
01:51:20,587 --> 01:51:22,316
Run from here! Run!

1969
01:51:24,324 --> 01:51:26,622
See! They have shut the
door out of fear.

1970
01:51:29,563 --> 01:51:30,791
Oh, where are we trapped?

1971
01:51:31,131 --> 01:51:33,258
We didn't benefit anything,
instead we are in a loss.

1972
01:51:33,633 --> 01:51:36,466
Neither do I want Shabana
nor her love.

1973
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:37,832
Or these fake diamonds.

1974
01:51:38,205 --> 01:51:40,366
But if we will be here,
we will really die.

1975
01:51:41,241 --> 01:51:42,538
Come on, let's go to that hut.

1976
01:51:42,642 --> 01:51:44,132
At least our life will be saved.

1977
01:51:52,452 --> 01:51:54,443
Munna sir,
why are you firing at us?

1978
01:51:54,521 --> 01:51:56,580
I am holding it in my left hand,
so I couldn't control.

1979
01:51:56,656 --> 01:51:59,420
What are you saying? - Give me the
diamonds. - It is a Ionely place.

1980
01:51:59,493 --> 01:52:01,188
Please give me. Give me. Give me.

1981
01:52:02,429 --> 01:52:04,454
Son-in-law, give me the diamonds.
- Okay.

1982
01:52:04,764 --> 01:52:05,890
Shabana is with Vasim.

1983
01:52:06,333 --> 01:52:07,664
I will tell Vasim. Hurry up.

1984
01:52:07,901 --> 01:52:10,267
Hey, wait!
How will he give it to you?

1985
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:12,265
I counted till ten first.
Give it to me.

1986
01:52:12,339 --> 01:52:14,204
Shut up! You don't know to
count more than eight...

1987
01:52:14,274 --> 01:52:15,605
...and you want ten diamonds?

1988
01:52:16,176 --> 01:52:18,144
If you want Shabana,
then throw the diamonds here.

1989
01:52:18,345 --> 01:52:21,178
Hurry up! Give it here! - Hurry
up! Make it fast! - Yes, yes. - Yes.

1990
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:24,684
No! No! - Don't hand over
the diamonds to them...

1991
01:52:24,751 --> 01:52:26,878
...till they send Shabana here.

1992
01:52:27,554 --> 01:52:31,183
Munna, you traitor! - Who? Me?

1993
01:52:31,258 --> 01:52:32,282
Yes, you!

1994
01:52:32,492 --> 01:52:34,790
You too became greedy on
seeing the diamonds?!

1995
01:52:35,195 --> 01:52:38,494
I will smash you under my shoe no.
9.

1996
01:52:38,598 --> 01:52:39,929
There is a great confusion here.

1997
01:52:40,367 --> 01:52:41,857
Why don't you all call
a conference...

1998
01:52:41,935 --> 01:52:43,402
...and decide in a democratic
way that...

1999
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:46,098
...who should get the diamonds.
- Yes. Always better.

2000
01:52:46,506 --> 01:52:48,303
I got them. - Oh, my God!

2001
01:52:48,408 --> 01:52:49,705
Come on, give me the diamonds!

2002
01:52:49,776 --> 01:52:51,539
Otherwise I will bury both
of you son-in-laws...

2003
01:52:51,611 --> 01:52:53,442
...from where I have come.

2004
01:52:54,881 --> 01:52:57,782
Whose son-in-laws are we?!
- We are being addressed as...

2005
01:52:57,851 --> 01:52:59,148
...'Son-in-law' since
such a long time.

2006
01:52:59,219 --> 01:53:01,153
Neither do we have any
love for Shabana...

2007
01:53:01,221 --> 01:53:02,779
...nor real diamonds in our pocket.
Understood?

2008
01:53:02,856 --> 01:53:04,414
We don't love Shabana at all.

2009
01:53:04,691 --> 01:53:06,852
The real diamonds are studded
in uncle's teeth. - Yes.

2010
01:53:07,093 --> 01:53:08,720
Late Mr. Wrong removed the
germs from his teeth...

2011
01:53:08,795 --> 01:53:11,593
...and implanted the diamonds.
- Oh, oh! See the wonder!

2012
01:53:11,698 --> 01:53:13,427
The elephant has two
set of teeth...

2013
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,195
...one to show off and the
other to chew with.

2014
01:53:15,268 --> 01:53:20,467
Traitor, you want to cut
the hand with fed you?

2015
01:53:20,574 --> 01:53:22,474
The diamonds are studded
in uncle's teeth.

2016
01:53:22,542 --> 01:53:23,634
Break uncle's teeth.

2017
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,162
Get aside!

2018
01:53:53,573 --> 01:53:54,767
This ghost is peeing!

2019
01:53:58,178 --> 01:53:59,736
We will get you released
from here.

2020
01:54:01,548 --> 01:54:02,776
Are you all right, Shabana?

2021
01:54:03,316 --> 01:54:05,784
How the hell will I be fine
after hearing all this?

2022
01:54:05,885 --> 01:54:08,854
Sorry, Shabana. - Leave it!
- But we didn't intend to hurt you.

2023
01:54:09,122 --> 01:54:10,749
But we can't risk our lives too.

2024
01:54:10,857 --> 01:54:13,382
Yes, Shabana, look look... - Liar!

2025
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:14,825
Please accept some eligible goon
of your criminal world.

2026
01:54:14,894 --> 01:54:17,692
And tell your uncle to set us free
from this trouble. Please.

2027
01:54:17,797 --> 01:54:20,288
No way! I hate you two!
- But, Shabana... - Listen, Shabana...

2028
01:54:20,367 --> 01:54:21,425
Get out of my sight!

2029
01:54:34,147 --> 01:54:35,910
Shabana!
Shabana, please listen to me.

2030
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:37,673
Shabana, listen to us!
- Please, Shabana.

2031
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:40,151
Shabana, we can't handle this
bloodshed and violence.

2032
01:54:41,621 --> 01:54:43,418
We have not even fired
a fake gun till date...

2033
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:44,752
...forget about a real one.

2034
01:55:03,843 --> 01:55:05,105
Shabana is calling me!

2035
01:55:07,347 --> 01:55:08,678
Oh, uncle has run away!

2036
01:55:09,416 --> 01:55:12,283
Shabana! My cutie pie! My raisin!

2037
01:55:12,519 --> 01:55:16,182
My moon! Are you all right?
- Uncle! Uncle!

2038
01:55:16,423 --> 01:55:17,617
Good grief! Blood!

2039
01:55:17,824 --> 01:55:21,225
Wretched guys,
my delicate daughter whose hands...

2040
01:55:21,327 --> 01:55:23,124
...should have been adorned
with henna...

2041
01:55:23,229 --> 01:55:24,696
...you have smeared it with blood?

2042
01:55:25,632 --> 01:55:27,532
Whom you used to feed sweets
during childhood...

2043
01:55:27,734 --> 01:55:30,100
...you have shot a bullet at her?
- No.

2044
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:32,667
Uncle, this is not my blood!

2045
01:55:33,339 --> 01:55:36,433
It is Nandu's blood.
- Nandu? - Please come soon, uncle.

2046
01:55:36,509 --> 01:55:38,807
Where is Nandu?
- Oh, Nandu has died. Come soon.

2047
01:55:38,912 --> 01:55:42,712
Nandu took the bullet on his
chest which was shot at me.

2048
01:55:42,816 --> 01:55:46,343
Uncle, today Nandu has repaid
the debt of your blood.

2049
01:55:46,619 --> 01:55:49,554
At least my blood is useful
for some of my dear one.

2050
01:55:50,757 --> 01:55:53,487
Yes, uncle. Your daughter
who is dearest to you...

2051
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:55,550
...is no less than
anyone for Nandu.

2052
01:55:55,628 --> 01:55:57,619
No, no.
Nothing will happen to you.

2053
01:55:58,565 --> 01:56:00,328
Munna! - What happened?

2054
01:56:01,534 --> 01:56:03,263
Look at him... - He is not dead yet!

2055
01:56:03,369 --> 01:56:05,564
He is not dead.
But you did try your best.

2056
01:56:06,372 --> 01:56:09,273
You want the diamonds, right?
Take this!

2057
01:56:09,642 --> 01:56:11,166
And this! And this!

2058
01:56:12,645 --> 01:56:14,510
Why are you hitting yourself
in a graveyard?

2059
01:56:14,581 --> 01:56:16,572
What will the corpses think?
- They will turn aside.

2060
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:19,582
I catch your feet.
- Leave my feet. - Left it.

2061
01:56:19,652 --> 01:56:21,620
Kamaal,
take away all the diamonds.

2062
01:56:21,688 --> 01:56:23,656
Look, I am giving everything
to him in your presence.

2063
01:56:23,723 --> 01:56:25,748
I don't want the diamonds.
- I don't want them too.

2064
01:56:26,192 --> 01:56:27,750
I beg of you.

2065
01:56:28,361 --> 01:56:30,761
Please let me go to Kabul
with peace and harmony.

2066
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:32,229
Kathik, it's a good news.

2067
01:56:32,298 --> 01:56:34,232
Uncle is taking Aman (Harmony)
And Shanti (Peace)...

2068
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,631
...to Kabul instead of us. Yeah.

2069
01:56:35,702 --> 01:56:37,329
Look,
this is the right opportunity.

2070
01:56:37,437 --> 01:56:39,405
Till the sad song of underworld
is going on... - Yes?

2071
01:56:39,506 --> 01:56:41,201
We will get out of here. - Yes.

2072
01:56:41,508 --> 01:56:42,566
Grab the mask. - Yes.

2073
01:56:44,477 --> 01:56:46,206
Oh, oh! - Oh, Badam and Kaju. - Yes?

2074
01:56:46,312 --> 01:56:48,473
Don't you want to say anything
in your clarification?

2075
01:56:48,548 --> 01:56:50,175
Please forgive us.

2076
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:53,510
We are sure that Shabana will
choose a good boy for her. - Yes.

2077
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:55,520
She will not choose,
she has already chosen.

2078
01:56:56,523 --> 01:56:57,547
Congrats. Good.

2079
01:56:57,624 --> 01:56:59,683
No, no, I am Manglik. She must
be talking about you. - Me...

2080
01:56:59,759 --> 01:57:01,727
Not anyone among both of you.
- Then who next?

2081
01:57:01,828 --> 01:57:04,854
Uncle,
I am talking about our Nandu...

2082
01:57:05,331 --> 01:57:06,593
Our Nandu!

2083
01:57:10,570 --> 01:57:13,300
Uncle,
the person who is so dear to you...

2084
01:57:13,406 --> 01:57:15,806
...how can he be any
less for Shabana?

2085
01:57:16,709 --> 01:57:18,836
Oh, dear! - Worthless guys...

2086
01:57:19,078 --> 01:57:22,206
...neither you are fit for my
Shabana or my business.

2087
01:57:22,315 --> 01:57:24,783
Remember one thing. - That you
have not rejected Shabana...

2088
01:57:24,851 --> 01:57:27,183
...in fact Shabana has rejected
you. - Yes. - Yes.

2089
01:57:27,387 --> 01:57:28,820
You have let such
a good girl and...

2090
01:57:28,888 --> 01:57:30,480
...such a fantastic opportunity
slip out of your hands.

2091
01:57:30,557 --> 01:57:33,390
You will repent for it!
- Go! Get out of my sight!

2092
01:57:33,493 --> 01:57:36,326
Really? - Really? - Come on,
get lost! - Go away!

2093
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,391
We are saved!
- Yes, we had a narrow escape.

2094
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:45,603
Hey, are you blind? - Yes!

2095
01:57:46,039 --> 01:57:47,529
You spoiled brat of
a rich father...

2096
01:57:47,607 --> 01:57:48,733
I am so sorry, sir. I am so...

2097
01:57:48,808 --> 01:57:50,833
I am so sorry.
- Are you okay? - Yes, I am fine.

2098
01:57:51,077 --> 01:57:52,066
Oh, darn! You are okay.

2099
01:57:52,145 --> 01:57:54,136
Hurry up, sit in my car.
I will take you to the hospital.

2100
01:57:54,214 --> 01:57:56,114
Come on, let's go.
Let's not waste time. Hurry up!

2101
01:57:56,182 --> 01:57:59,345
Oh, darn, guys! How can I be
so careless? I am sorry.

2102
01:57:59,619 --> 01:58:00,779
What was I just thinking?

2103
01:58:01,187 --> 01:58:02,848
I should have been more careful.
- Don't worry.

2104
01:58:03,089 --> 01:58:04,556
I am feeling so guilty.
- No, no, don't worry.

2105
01:58:04,624 --> 01:58:06,524
We are fine.
We are absolutely fine. Yeah.

2106
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,857
Are you okay? - No.

2107
01:58:10,096 --> 01:58:11,688
I think his mind has been injured.

2108
01:58:11,798 --> 01:58:13,857
Don't worry, guys.
I am just trying my level best...

2109
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:15,226
...to get to the hospital on time.

2110
01:58:15,301 --> 01:58:16,825
To which doctor are you taking me?

2111
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:18,662
He is close by. The clinic
is located near my house.

2112
01:58:18,738 --> 01:58:20,103
Do you stay here nearby?

2113
01:58:21,207 --> 01:58:23,573
Good idea! So why don't we
leave him at the clinic...

2114
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:25,338
...and wait at your house?

2115
01:58:25,445 --> 01:58:28,209
Oh, I really wish but you know
I have to go to Chembur...

2116
01:58:28,314 --> 01:58:30,145
...to attend my friend's
engagement. - I see.

2117
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:32,584
How sweet! I have to go there too.

2118
01:58:32,819 --> 01:58:35,413
To attend the engagement?
- No, to Chembur. - Me too.

2119
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:39,859
I too want to visit Chembur
Government hospital.

2120
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:42,091
My family doctor,
Mr. Desai practices there.

2121
01:58:43,162 --> 01:58:45,096
We will drop you here at OPD.

2122
01:58:45,331 --> 01:58:47,322
Free treatment is available
for the poor here. Okay?

2123
01:58:48,635 --> 01:58:50,603
You are so funny, Rishi.

2124
01:58:50,703 --> 01:58:53,433
As soon you see a good girl,
you start cracking dirty jokes.

2125
01:58:53,773 --> 01:58:56,674
What is your good name? - Shabana.

2126
01:58:59,312 --> 01:59:00,370
Shabana?! - Shabana?!

2127
01:59:01,748 --> 01:59:03,443
Stop the car! - Stop the car!
