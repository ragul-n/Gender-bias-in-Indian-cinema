4
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,910
The witnesses' testimony, the evidence...

5
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,670
and the public prosecutor's
arguments have proven that...

6
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,449
you, Jagannath...

7
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,200
absconded from prison before the
completion of your 10-year term.

8
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,340
And you murdered Roshanlal too.

9
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,989
The Court and the law have given you
many opportunities to defend yourself.

10
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,290
But you kept refusing.

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,609
Your lips remain sealed.

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,620
The Court gives you one last opportunity
to offer the proof of your innocence.

13
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,840
If you reject this offer...

14
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,630
the Court will be compelled
to pronounce its verdict.

15
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,140
Speak! Do you have
anything to say?

16
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,080
In that case, the Court, in accordance
with the jury's verdict...

17
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,500
hold you responsible for the murder
of the late Roshanlal...

18
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,030
- and under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code...
- Stop!

19
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,420
I request the Court's mercy.

20
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,070
I'm the younger brother
of the accused.

21
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,460
The law's discourse had no effect
on the accused.

22
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,460
Perhaps blood may speak
to blood? Milord...

23
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,299
please grant me an opportunity
to reason with my brother.

24
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,170
- Permission granted.
- Thank you!

25
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,430
Bhaiyya [brother], say something.

26
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,420
Speak for our sake,
if not for your own.

27
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,666
Don't you remember? When we
were young, you used to tell me...

28
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,776
it's written that it's wrong to steal,
it's a sin to lie?

29
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,950
I used to steal...
I lied...

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,750
You used to say it's a grave sin
to kill someone, to commit murder.

31
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,830
I walked that sinful path.

32
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,380
I should be standing
in your place.

33
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Bhaiyya, what happened?
How did this happen?

34
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,440
I'll go crazy, wondering...

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,260
how the man who showed me the way
ended up on this destructive path.

36
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,030
How? Say something...

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,780
Please tell us...
you won't speak?

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,359
All right. I swear upon Munna
that I'll break my promise.

39
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,489
No! No.

40
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:17,110
No... why is my soul being punished
instead of my body?

41
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,220
I will speak...
I will speak.

42
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,800
It is true that I was a brigand.

43
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,600
It is true that I escaped
from prison.

44
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,240
My love for my child
compelled me.

45
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,340
It is also true that
I committed a murder.

46
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,710
I pronounced the verdict
for all these crimes...

47
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,789
on myself before
coming here today.

48
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,230
Other than the death penalty...

49
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,220
the Law has no other punishment
for my crimes.

50
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,010
Now that I am being
compelled to speak...

51
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,400
I want to know...
I want to ask...

52
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,150
if the punishment for murder
is death...

53
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
how did these paths towards
death come to be?

54
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,720
How did a murderer
reach this destination?

55
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,270
I wasn't born a murderer.

56
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,090
I don't know what
blood [lineage] means.

57
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,250
Nor am I aware of
blood relationships.

58
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,400
I haven't experienced
a mother's love...

59
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,830
or a father's guidance.
But, yes...

60
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,679
I know hatred and cruelty...
and I know how to commit atrocities.

61
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,900
Because I was brought up
in this environment!

62
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,609
As a child, I would hold my
younger brother close to me...

63
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,400
and beg for a few crumbs of
affection and sympathy.

64
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,990
But all we got was hatred,
animosity and cruelty!

65
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,630
We were given stones
instead of food.

66
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,640
We got deceit in return
for our honesty.

67
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,500
We were beaten for
our hard work...

68
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,860
Sorrows, troubles,
humiliation, insults...

69
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,330
You lazy good-for-nothing!

70
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,210
You think it's your
father's property?

71
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,070
Seth...

72
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,040
Why do you bring
our father into this?

73
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,799
You pipsqueak! How dare you
argue with me? Get lost!

74
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,870
Sethji... the fault was mine.

75
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,400
- Beat me if you wish. Why are you beating my brother?
- Shut up!

76
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,090
What are you glaring for?

77
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,440
Are you done?!
Give us our month's pay.

78
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,446
Pay? If you work
without pay for a year...

79
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,540
you still cannot compensate
my loss. Get lost.

80
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,070
Get lost! Get lost,
you disloyal wretch.

81
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,370
Dishonest fellows! Wonder where
you come from! Get out.

82
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,039
You goons!

83
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,270
Raju, the Seth has deducted
a whole month's salary.

84
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,440
- Now what will we eat?
- We can sell the seth's watch.

85
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,200
Raju! You stole again!

86
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,550
- Day by day, you're becoming a thief.
- A mere thief, bhaiyya?

87
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,730
- I'm going to be a master thief!
Raju!

88
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,190
The book says thieving is a sin.

89
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,080
Burn that book! We lost
our pay because of it!

90
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,310
Impertinent wretch! I'll pull your
tongue out if you criticise this book.

91
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,540
- Give the watch here! - I won't give it.
- I'll return it. - No, I won't.

92
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,210
- I tell you...
- Thief! Thief! Catch them, somebody!

93
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,780
Thief, thief! Thief!

94
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,640
- My watch!
- Thanks to you, we lost the seth's watch too.

95
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,860
The day is almost over
and I am dying of hunger!

96
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,080
Starving to death is preferable to
living off stolen property.

97
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,600
God, are you angry?

98
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,940
Because Raju committed theft?

99
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,690
He's ignorant, O Lord.
Please forgive him.

100
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,100
No one gave us anything.
Now, please provide us with food.

101
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,750
- We are very hungry.
- He won't give us anything.

102
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,670
Having lived with men,
he's become stone-hearted too.

103
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,620
- I'll give you food.
- Where will you get it from?

104
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,580
- We can sell mother's mangalsutra [wedding chain].
- No!

105
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,400
It's all we have left to remember
her by. It belongs...

106
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,740
to both of us equally.
Promise me...

107
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,279
you will never part
with this heirloom.

108
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,610
I'll never part with it.

109
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,916
- Are you going to fill your stomach with promises?
- What do we do?

110
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,860
No one will give us
a single penny.

111
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,880
A penny? Here, son, I'll
give you plenty. Happy?

112
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,340
And if you run an errand for me,
I'll pay you Rs.10.

113
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,329
- What's the job, sethji?
- Go to the railway godown...

114
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,990
- and bring back a small parcel.
- Robbery?

115
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,420
Robbery? No, my dear,
where's the theft in this?

116
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,420
- This is yours and mine.
- What's that mean?

117
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,650
- What's 'yours and mine' mean?
- How do I explain to a child?

118
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,359
Listen... suppose this book is
in your hands. Whose is it? Yours.

119
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,730
But if I snatch it, and it's in
my hands, whose is it? Mine.

120
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,479
If it's with you, it's yours,
and if it's with me, it's mine.

121
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,470
So how is this theft?

122
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,390
Come on, bhaiyya... let's play
yours and mine. Come on.

123
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,340
- Why are you worried, son?
- Come on, let's do it. - I'll pay you Rs.10.

124
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:45,041
[Inaudible]
[whispering]

125
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,610
Meet me near the car.

126
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,170
Look!

127
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,820
Bhaiyya!

128
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,990
Bhaiyya!

129
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,170
We did pick up the parcel
but the police came after us.

130
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,440
My brother and I were separated.

131
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,020
Then why have you come alone?
Get lost, you scoundrel!

132
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,100
Stop the car, driver!
I say, driver, stop the car!

133
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,590
Get out, you bastard.
Get lost!

134
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,710
Get lost, you scoundrel!

135
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:36,310
For two pennies...
for two bits...

136
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,910
- honor can be bought and sold...
- Raju! Raju...

137
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:52,220
- Raju! Raju!
- In these bazaars filled with hunger... - Raju...

138
00:11:53,150 --> 00:12:00,140
- men are bought and sold...
- Raju! Raju...

139
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,030
No! No... No!

140
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,550
God! Now I can't be bought
for two pennies, O Lord!

141
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,610
Your hypocritical world
looted me.

142
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,510
I lost my father's guidance,
my mother's embrace.

143
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,510
That didn't satisfy you, so you
took my brother away from me?

144
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,849
For a fistful of gram?

145
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,400
You're a lifeless stone idol. If a heart
beat within your breast...

146
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,140
then you wouldn't mock
man's suffering.

147
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,076
Snatching away every semblance
of support, you wouldn't say...

148
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,520
that when there's no one
to depend on, there's always God.

149
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,230
God, I've come here today,
to tell you...

150
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,430
that from now on,
I'll be my own God.

151
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,380
And I'll establish a world that
will be better than yours.

152
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,000
Hey! Hey, my wallet!

153
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,610
Dear sirs, that had my
entire month's pay in it.

154
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,666
I've been robbed! My children
will starve. What will I do now?

155
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,630
Hey, look, there he is!
Stop him!

156
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,180
- Catch him!
- Don't let him escape! - Get him!

157
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,390
Where did he go?
There's no road ahead.

158
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,470
Come on, get in.

159
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,735
[knocking the door]

160
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,230
Click a photo.

161
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,740
- Inform Patrol 2424.
- Patrol 2424 speaking.

162
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,860
We didn't find any trace of the thief.
Nothing besides his footprints.

163
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,780
We followed the car tracks,
but even those disappeared suddenly.

164
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,520
Make sure you don't
suddenly disappear.

165
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,200
Catching the Boss
is no child's play.

166
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,880
- Good day. - Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

167
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,310
- Understood?
- It won't happen again, Boss.

168
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,500
Babu...

169
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,729
- What's today's takings?
- All this loot, boss!

170
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,100
Distribute it amongst yourselves.

171
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,790
Because the loot that's
come my way today...

172
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,470
has confounded the whole world.

173
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,949
It's worth millions.
Look at it.

174
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,420
I suspect Rajkumar had a hand
in stealing this necklace.

175
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,140
- Rajkumar [Prince]? Which Prince?
- The Prince of pickpockets...

176
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,010
Prince Abdul Karim,
alias Rana Ramchander...

177
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,010
alias His Highness Kartar Singh,
alias Prince... etc., etc.

178
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,390
He has had his share
of big time thefts.

179
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,440
Inspector saheb, this time
he has stolen your intelligence!

180
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,918
- What do you mean?
- This Prince...

181
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:15,898
alias etc., etc., etc.
The one you suspect?

182
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,320
- Yes?
- He's scheduled to be released from this jail today.

183
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:20,029
- Oh.
- Look, there he is.

184
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,930
- Saab, namaste!
- Namaste, namaste.

185
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,460
Arre, Mr. Chaubey?

186
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,680
Good morning, Salam aleikum, Sat Sri
Akal... tell me, what brings you here?

187
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,800
You're a very fortunate man,
Rajkumar.

188
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,350
You haven't stepped out and Inspector
Chaubey has come to arrest you again.

189
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,120
- Jailor Saab? - Hmm?
- Whenever Mr. Chaubey wants a raise...

190
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,320
he can only think of me!
But this time, he's mistaken.

191
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,596
- Tell me, Mr. Chaubey, what's the matter?
- The fact is that...

192
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,460
a necklace worth Rs1.2 million
has been stolen.

193
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,990
Rs.1.2 million? Phew!

194
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,880
This... was this shoe also stolen?

195
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,070
This is a sample of the
thief's shoe... size 12.

196
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,030
- Size 12?
- Yes.

197
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,070
Mr. Chaubey, I used to be
a Size 8.

198
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,670
Languishing in prison has shrunk
my feet to a 6.5. Take a look.

199
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,290
Come on, have a look. Arre, saheb,
this is a magnificent foot.

200
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,090
It seems to be my big brother's.
Here, have a look.

201
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,050
Er, Rajkumar, your
release orders have arrived.

202
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,340
And here are your possessions.

203
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,340
Tie this for me, Jailor saheb.

204
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,170
Oh ho! Rajkumar, where did
you steal these gold beads from?

205
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,910
Mr. Chaubey, this is the
only thing that isn't stolen.

206
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,360
It's a memento of my late mother.

207
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,760
A way to trace
my missing brother.

208
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,150
Rajkumar, I don't want you
to come to this jail again.

209
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,780
You know you have
already served ten terms.

210
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,160
But this time, Mr. Chaubey,
forgive me, you were mistaken.

211
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm lucky that we met here. Would you
have spared me otherwise?

212
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,640
I won't spare any pains even now.
I have to arrest that crook.

213
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,526
The owner of the necklace has offered
a reward of Rs.10,000.

214
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,129
And you'll get a raise too,
Mr. Chaubey! Yes?

215
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,370
Hey, we're so glad you're out.

216
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,786
- Where're the rest?
- Julie has a cold, Boss...

217
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,340
and JD has an upset stomach.
So they couldn't come.

218
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,090
- How's Worli junction?
- Boss, you've been relaxing here...

219
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,130
And we've landed
in heaps of trouble.

220
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,420
- Never mind. Let's start.
- What?

221
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:16,480
Iri Ra raka, aaka ka baaka,
baaka ka taaka, Worli ka naaka

222
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,870
The world is exploding, drop
a firecracker every now and then

223
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,840
Look at the poor, their plight

224
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,480
lnflames my heart, that sight

225
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,980
The work is done
by poor, mute Kallu...

226
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,550
while the rewards are
enjoyed by Uncle Shambhu

227
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,820
The world is exploding, drop
a firecracker every now and then

228
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,650
If you know how to make them bow

229
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,246
The world, O Lala,
will be at your feet

230
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,750
The world is cruel,
and will follow

231
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,419
those whom the world
deems worthy

232
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,810
The world is exploding, drop
a firecracker every now and then

233
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,710
What a glance is yours,
O infidel...

234
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,250
that leaves a traveler
bereft on the trail

235
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,840
Things have been
Topsy-turvy today

236
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,490
The robber was being robbed

237
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,300
The world is exploding, drop
a firecracker at every step... Ha!

238
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,419
I dance on the streets, singing

239
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,120
Teaching beauty the art of love

240
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,850
My song is rollicking

241
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,600
So much better than Rock n' Roll

242
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,920
The world is exploding, drop
a firecracker at every step

243
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,830
[Humming nonsense lyrics] Trying to
steal the watch, huh? Go on, pull!

244
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,590
Heh... No, Boss. I was just
looking at the time.

245
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,949
It's 12 o'clock. Trying to
outsmart your Boss, Boss?

246
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,870
You thought this was
your older brother's?

247
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,636
I did think so but you didn't give me
the chance to realise...

248
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,820
Why are you wasting time
on small thefts?

249
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,840
Try your hand at something big.

250
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,680
You inserted your big feet;
how will I try my hand...

251
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,760
That's a magnificent foot!

252
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,630
- You're a size 12, aren't you?
- Huh? Get lost. Go about your work.

253
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,280
Look what I've brought home.

254
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,850
- What's all this?
- Today, I've bought out the toy shop.

255
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,080
- Put that here, Jugnu.
- But, for whom?

256
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,270
- For Munna, of course. Who else?
- For our son? - Yes.

257
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,030
He has to be born first. Then,
he will play with these toys...

258
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,236
and when he turns five,
then he will sit in this car.

259
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,740
No, my dear, you don't understand.
You don't know anything.

260
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,570
My son will be born
driving a car.

261
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,320
- What say, Jugnu?
- Yes, sir!

262
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,810
Hopes are indeed very pleasant...

263
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,300
but don't tire yourself out
chasing those dreams.

264
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,480
My dear wife, I'm not
chasing dreams.

265
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,910
My hopes and dreams chase me.

266
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,860
- What's so funny?
- I didn't laugh at what you said...

267
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,620
I was laughing at your shoes.

268
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,320
My shoes? Why so?

269
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,449
I heard the news on the radio that
an expensive necklace was stolen.

270
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,929
The thief's foot is
as large as yours.

271
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,836
- Size 12.
- Look, my dear wife, right now, I'm very hungry.

272
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,740
I want my food right away.

273
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,880
How wonderful, my dear wife.
You're amazing!

274
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,180
You cook bitter gourd so well that
I, who enslave the world...

275
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,220
am enamored of this dish.

276
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,620
As if you would starve without this
bitter gourd if I were to die tomorrow.

277
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,980
Firstly, you're mistaken that
you will die tomorrow.

278
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,820
And if you were to go, I'll have you
write down the recipe first.

279
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,010
There's nothing special
about the recipe.

280
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,160
I cook them in
your presence daily.

281
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,350
But... I add a special something
before I serve you.

282
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,240
What's the special ingredient,
my dear?

283
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,810
Your dear wife puts
her love into it.

284
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,020
You are amazing, my dear wife!

285
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,320
Seems like Lord Indra's court
has descended on Juhu.

286
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,600
- Boss? - Yes?
- You've been staring hard at the girl in the middle.

287
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,120
- What's the matter?
- She's an amazing chick.

288
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,939
She's a golden goose.

289
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,560
You will remain a goldsmith!
Look at her through my eyes.

290
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,750
I've a keen eye, Boss.

291
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,450
Didn't you notice? She has
two notes worth Rs.1,000 each.

292
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,040
- How do you know?
- Boss, Santa...

293
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,720
Boss, at the Santa Cruz
gas station...

294
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,660
she bought 10 gallons of fuel.

295
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,250
And she changed
two 1000-rupee notes.

296
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,320
We would have snatched it right there,
Boss, but we didn't get a chance.

297
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,410
- So what's the plan?
- We'll assemble at Juhu tonight.

298
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,100
And by morning we'll
have the money. What say?

299
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,469
Then we must lay a trap.

300
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,120
- But how?
- That's what I'm wondering.

301
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,680
Do watch! Raj Kapoor's
new film, Shree 420.

302
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,139
Don't miss it. Please watch
Raj Kapoor's amazing performance.

303
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,110
Please come and watch.
Don't miss it.

304
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:47,490
- Don't miss the new film, Shree 420.
- Raj Kapoor. - Don't miss it. - Shree 420.

305
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,480
- Boss, the trap is laid!
- How?

306
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,790
The trap has been laid.
Don't ask questions, just run.

307
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,780
- Run, Boss! - Run!
- Run, Boss. - Run! - Run!

308
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:04,120
- Raj Kapoor! - Raj Kapoor!
- Hey! Police! - Raj Kapoor!

309
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:12,250
- [Muffled shouts of 'Raj Kapoor!']
- Where's Raj Kapoor?

310
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,050
- Where are you going?
- You have to go here, Boss. Go!

311
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:50,630
[Muffled shouts and
exclamations continue.]

312
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,610
- Raj Kapoor! Meena, Raj Kapoor!
- Listen... listen... - Yes, tell me.

313
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,480
- Look, he's speaking to you.
- Please, help me.

314
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,980
- These people are chasing me thinking I'm Raj Kapoor.
- Thinking?

315
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,980
- You are Raj Kapoor. - Excuse me?
- You put on an act in real life too.

316
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,456
- Excuse me, what a strange thing to say.
- You're Raj Kapoor, right?

317
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,410
Not at all.
Look, when I lie...

318
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,466
- people believe me, but when I speak the truth, no one...
- Well, never mind.

319
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,290
This gave us a chance
to meet you.

320
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,460
You must attend our party
this evening.

321
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,006
- Your party? - Yes.
- But... but...

322
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,930
Why don't you call for
a change of clothes?

323
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,710
- The tele... telephone is out of order.
- Never mind. We'll arrange something.

324
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,179
Do come with us.
Let's go. Please, come.

325
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,500
Iri Ra raka, aka ka baka,
baka ka taka...

326
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,640
- How are the clothes?
- They are alright.

327
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,790
It seems like they were tailored
just for me. It's fine.

328
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,260
Raj Saab, how many awards
have you won?

329
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,800
I've had plenty of awards.
So far, I've had ten opportunities.

330
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,090
And if Mr. Chaubey comes along,
then I'll get another one.

331
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,350
But Raj Saab, you won an award
at Karlovy Vary for Jagte Raho.

332
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,970
- Who's this Chaubey from Mathura...
- Mem saheb...

333
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,470
Chaubeys aren't only
from Mathura.

334
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,379
Our 'Vary Karlovo' has
the very best of Chaubeys.

335
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,260
- 'Vary Karlova'?
- Yes, of course.

336
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,180
Huh? Never mind.
Whatever be the name...

337
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,850
- How was the place?
- Oh, it has changed for the better.

338
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,790
They have added a couple of dishes,
the radio stays on, and...

339
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,290
- there isn't a bedbug to be seen.
- Bedbug? - Of course.

340
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,426
Men and bedbugs stay together.

341
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,900
But they have sprayed
two rounds of DDT that...

342
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,230
though humans survived,
the bedbugs were bumped off.

343
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,530
That's very good!
Where else did you go?

344
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,510
Where did we get a chance to
roam around? During the day...

345
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,851
we were restricted to the compound
and locked up at night.

346
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,470
Er... forgive me, but
why are you whispering?

347
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,959
Listen... you...

348
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,536
did you go to Karlovy Vary?
Or to prison?

349
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,300
I've been to prison
many times too.

350
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,070
- You? Jail?
- Yes, of course.

351
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,860
Just yesterday, I went to jail for a film.
And today, I enacted that scene for you.

352
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,590
Too good! Raj Saab...

353
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,356
- You... you are indeed a very good artiste.
- There's no doubt about that.

354
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,630
Raj saheb... give her a chance
in your next film.

355
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,530
- She can be a good actress. - Be quiet.
- Yes, I had the same thought.

356
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,100
- Huh?
- So? Why don't you make a film with him?

357
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,379
- How?
- You are rich, aren't you?

358
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,930
- Where do I have any control over it? My uncle is guarding it like a snake.
- Snake?

359
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,840
Miss, don't worry. I know
how to catch snakes too.

360
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,780
You must have a fair idea having
watched Awara and Shree 420, right?

361
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,430
Raj Saab, you sing very well.
Please sing for us.

362
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,970
Me? Actually, the fact is...

363
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,750
film songs aren't any fun
without other characters.

364
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,616
If only there were boys and girls,
costumes, sets...

365
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,936
If you could make arrangements...

366
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Don't worry, sir, they're all here.

367
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,590
Oh, you have all that?
Then the song will be amazing!

368
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,740
Only the boy and girl
are missing.

369
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,170
Dear sir, look over there.
A girl... and a boy!

370
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,340
Of course! And she's wealthy
and I'm broke.

371
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,790
You are a girl and I'm a boy

372
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,980
My heart skips a beat
when I look at you

373
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:03,050
Under the coconut tree,
stands a girl from Madras

374
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,100
Like a delicate cotton bud

375
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:21,290
Teasing me is a boy from Punjab

376
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,530
Who looks like a rose in bloom

377
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:29,750
You are a boy and I'm a girl

378
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,270
My feelings flared
when I saw you

379
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,450
You are a girl and I'm a boy

380
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,189
My heart skipped a beat
when I saw you

381
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,850
When tales of your beauty
reached me in Punjab

382
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,810
I have traveled
to your threshold

383
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,490
When I heard your name, dear sir,
I left Madras behind

384
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,790
And here I am
standing beside you

385
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,220
You are a boy and I'm a girl

386
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,899
My feelings flared
when I saw you

387
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,319
You are a girl and I'm a boy

388
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,090
My heart skipped a beat
when I saw you

389
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:16,920
Your eyes are intoxicating and
your gait is that of a peahen

390
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,000
And my heart said,
'This is amazing'

391
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,490
You're no less, my beloved,
you're like the full moon

392
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,649
Even the moon fades before you

393
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,230
You are a boy and I'm a girl

394
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,799
The flames of desire
blazed in my heart

395
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,819
You are a girl and I'm a boy

396
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,529
My heart skipped a beat
when I saw you

397
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,190
Watch out, my girl

398
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,980
Be careful, my boy!

399
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,030
Sir, I've stayed in hotels
all over the world.

400
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,779
But I've never witnessed
such a theft.

401
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,740
- It's never happened in our hotel before.
- Then where did her money go?

402
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,780
- First, ask her whether she even had any money.
- How dare you!

403
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,510
Write down my address. I'll send
the money as soon as I reach.

404
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,210
- Take this.
- Why?

405
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,330
- You may need it.
- Thank you!

406
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,130
200... and 220...

407
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,400
- 420.
- Excuse me? Did you say something to me?

408
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,550
I was counting the money.
Raj Saab...

409
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,950
I'll never ever forget
your kindness.

410
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,950
- You were inconvenienced because of us.
- Not at all.

411
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,720
Where's the inconvenience?
It's your money, after all.

412
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,830
- I beg your pardon?
- Of course!

413
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,879
Look, the more films you watch,
the more money we get.

414
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,050
Alright, Raj Saab, tell me,
where do I return this money?

415
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,910
Listen, don't send it
to the studio.

416
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,910
Then where do I send it?

417
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,090
Er... that... let it be. I'll take it
some other time.

418
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,549
- But... Raj Saab, you...
- Listen to me...

419
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,279
- Hmm?
- I'm not Raj Kapoor.

420
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,800
- No?
- No.

421
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,549
Whoever you are,
you are very nice.

422
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:56,580
Iri Ra raka, aka ka baka...

423
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,470
Baka ka tata, tata ka taka

424
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,380
Iri Ra raka...
aka ka baka

425
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,339
Hey! Hey, once you
reach Pune...

426
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,680
your uncle will drive all this
out of your mind.

427
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,500
- Ara Ra Ra raka indeed...
- Why did you have to remind me of him?

428
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,770
This uncle has made
my life a misery!

429
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,140
My father earned
all this wealth. He died...

430
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,370
leaving this idiot
as my trustee.

431
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,740
By making you his trustee, my father
left a snake to guard his wealth!

432
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,080
I cannot allow you
to decide my fate.

433
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,290
I will not marry this donkey!

434
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,350
It's a sin, my dear, to call
your future husband names.

435
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,230
She has my permission, uncle.

436
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,896
In today's times, a woman should
at least have this freedom.

437
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,220
Shut up, idiot!

438
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,150
Did you see how he kept quiet?

439
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,840
My dear, you come from
an affluent family.

440
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,490
- You need a slave. Not a husband.
- A chicken, at that.

441
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,350
We can always get you
an equal match, my dear...

442
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,130
but they will never
do your bidding.

443
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,960
Do my bidding?

444
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,640
Or yours?

445
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,920
I don't want your wealth
to be squandered.

446
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,810
Your late father worked hard
to accumulate this wealth.

447
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,779
And you want to appropriate
this wealth for free.

448
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,340
My father willed...

449
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,069
that when I marry, the wealth would
belong to my husband and me.

450
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,646
And you... you want me to marry
this idiot, so that...

451
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,250
- you continue to control this wealth.
- Yes, that's what I want.

452
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,290
If you refuse this alliance,
I'll have to use force.

453
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,500
Make arrangements
for the wedding.

454
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,230
Hey, photographer!
Take a photo quickly.

455
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,040
- I want proof of my child's wedding.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,980
- I am dead!
- Shut up!

457
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,190
She can run away
from the wedding venue...

458
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,580
but she can't
escape my clutches.

459
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,940
Advertise her photo in the newspapers
and say she absconded with Rs.100,000.

460
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,440
Announce a reward of Rs.10,000
for anyone who finds her.

461
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,110
No, no, this is impossible.
I can't believe it.

462
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,190
Look... look at this...

463
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,920
Can such an innocent girl
abscond with Rs.100,000?

464
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,440
The poor girl does look very innocent.
Why, what's wrong?

465
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,930
Just read this. Her uncle has
given an advertisement...

466
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,880
stating that she's absconded
with Rs.100,000.

467
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,570
And offering a reward of Rs.10,000
to the person who finds her.

468
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,120
- Poor thing. She's in big trouble.
- Trouble? Why?

469
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,040
Of course! All the rogues
in the city will be after her.

470
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,069
And that man with
the size 12 shoes?

471
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,820
I wonder what schemes
he must be plotting.

472
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,640
- We have it made!
- Why? What happened?

473
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,450
Look... look at this. She's the same girl
who disposed of Rs.2,000.

474
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,510
But boss, you only
gave us Rs.1,580.

475
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,110
- You gave back Rs.420.
- So what?

476
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,580
- So what? Now she's played a hand for Rs.100,000.
- What do you mean?

477
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,939
It says here that this girl
ran way with Rs.100,000.

478
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,770
And there's a
Rs.10,000 reward.

479
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,350
Then our film's made!

480
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,560
Ha! 'Film's made' indeed!
That's all you care about!

481
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,390
Dude, all the big-time rogues must
be after her for the Rs.100,000.

482
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,220
Porter! Porter!

483
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,510
- Khan Saab, do you want a hotel?
- No, sir. Porter!

484
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,816
Khan, stay at our hotel. All the
Pathans from Peshawar stay there.

485
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,640
Sir, I said I don't want
a hotel!

486
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,920
- Porter!
- Move it. Khan Saab doesn't require a hotel.

487
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,230
- Khan Saab... Khan Saab, have you come from Pune?
- Yes, sir.

488
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,799
Khan Saab, you came from Pune.
Was there a girl in your compartment?

489
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,089
- What sort of girl?
- This one, Khan Saab. This one.

490
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,940
Oh, yes, yes... this girl
got in at Pune.

491
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,600
She spoke very politely, said
she had no one in the world.

492
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,270
You say you're her brother?
You are lying!

493
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,910
I swear upon God she's my sister,
Khan Saab. Look...

494
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,620
- She looks so beautiful.
- So she's your biological sister?

495
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,470
- If you do find her, give her Abdul Rehman's regards.
- I will.

496
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,680
Why are you drawing on
your beard and mustache?

497
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,170
Why don't you remove yours
and stick it on, big brother?

498
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,670
Who are you? Who?

499
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,870
Hey, move it. Idiots!

500
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,650
How are you,
my dear Abdul Rehman?

501
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,430
Khan, you've come
to Bombay alone?

502
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,540
Why didn't your father,
Baba Khan, come with you?

503
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,840
Hey, I don't know you, mister!

504
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,060
Why are you calling me 'Mister'?
Call me 'uncle'.

505
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,340
I'm your father's friend, Badruddin
Pitalwala. And you're my guest.

506
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,950
Hey, I won't go
with you, mister.

507
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,366
What do you mean you won't go?
I'll carry you home.

508
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,710
Badruddin Seth, you can't
take him, he's my guest.

509
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,380
- Don't cry now. Come, my boy, let's go.
- I won't go, uncle. Hey!

510
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,460
- Hey, Badru, come on.
- Shamshu's father! Hey...

511
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,450
- What happened, Begum?
- That wretch took my burqa.

512
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,100
Go inside! Praise God that
you didn't go along with the burqa.

513
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,720
Get inside!

514
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,966
That 'papadwala' is toast now.
Boss has come out in a burqa.

515
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,629
Now 'big brother' has had it.

516
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,010
Don't waste time,
my boy, get in.

517
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,906
- You... - Time's...
- Hey, Khan Saab, why are you leaving me behind?

518
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,330
- I've no one to call my own.
- Who's this woman?

519
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:53,400
What's this, Khan Saab? Who's
this woman? Why is she crying?

520
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,330
What can I say? He's upset with me
and is leaving the house.

521
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,990
- What can I do? I've five kids...
- But who are you?

522
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:03,400
May God bless you. Marry ten times
if you wish; when am I stopping you?

523
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,880
- But why are you abandoning me?
- Hey, begum... Hey... hey, begum!

524
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:11,240
Why are you chasing him? My boy,
Abdul Rehman isn't even married.

525
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,246
If he's unmarried, where did these
five children come from?

526
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,710
My dear sir, this woman is lying.
Blatantly lying.

527
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,900
You've forgotten, uncle. Why
don't you tell him, Khan Saab?

528
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,640
You attended our wedding, uncle.
Have you forgotten?

529
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,336
What's this, my dear Abdul Rehman,
why aren't you saying anything?

530
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,900
That this is a fraud, a farce?
Call the police!

531
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,580
- Police! Police!
- Heck, I'll call the police!

532
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,576
He had five kids, married her,
and now, he's abandoning her?

533
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,089
A Pathan is abandoning his duty?

534
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,986
Take the woman with you
or we will force you.

535
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,330
Thank you. May Allah
protect you, Khan Saab.

536
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,750
May Allah protect you. Now don't
dishonor your name, Khan Saab...

537
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,820
- let's go home to our children.
- Come on, get in.

538
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,149
- Go on. - Sit inside. - Sit.
- Go on, mister.

539
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,350
- Go on. Get going. - It's sheer fraud.
- Drive on, cabbie.

540
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,770
Go on, my dear.
Allah be with you.

541
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,430
You can't outsmart
your boss, Boss.

542
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,350
What sort of a woman are you?

543
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,950
Men usually kidnap women; you're
a woman kidnapping a man?

544
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,870
Matters of the heart always
run counter, Khan. What can I do?

545
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,990
Remember this, whether you
are a good woman or bad...

546
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,410
you won't get anything from me.
I'm an impecunious Pathan.

547
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,720
I have nothing!
Just leave me alone!

548
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,680
I agree that you are a poor Pathan.
I also agree that I should leave you alone.

549
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,870
- But, my Khan, where will you go?
- Arre, I'm a Pathan.

550
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,500
I'll go somewhere,
find a place...

551
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,820
- You just leave me alone.
- Oh, but what am I for, then?

552
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:39,090
My dear Khan, I'll make
room for you... in my heart.

553
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,110
- Hey, driver, take us to Hotel Victory.
- Go to hell!

554
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,970
- Damn you!
- May Allah protect you! Do go freshen up.

555
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,386
- Why don't you bathe quickly? I'll just get a priest.
- A priest?

556
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:53,210
- Priest? - Yes.
- Begum, you're thinking of getting married?

557
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,490
You've trapped me!

558
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,770
Hey, now go shower quickly.
It's getting late.

559
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,330
May Allah protect me. Now I'll
have to take a bath, begum!

560
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,130
You've trapped me, damn it!

561
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,330
Begum, you really trapped me.

562
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,569
What have you got
yourself into, Madhu!

563
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:16,750
Uff! Priest... girl... wedding...

564
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,040
How can two girls
get married? Uff!

565
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,090
Begum! The water is freezing!

566
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,260
I'm dead!

567
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,890
Don't try to sneak a look.

568
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:05,030
I swear upon God, begum,
I didn't come to look at you.

569
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,529
I came to get my clothes,
my dear.

570
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,426
May Allah protect me,
Khan Saab...

571
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,346
in my hurry, I brought
your senior wife's clothes.

572
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,870
She doesn't wear men's clothing.

573
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,890
Oh dear! Then what will I... I...
wear after my shower, begum?

574
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:21,396
May Allah protect you.
Here's your senior wife's coat...

575
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,870
You can wear this to get married.
Open the door and take it.

576
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,470
All right, begum.
I'll take it.

577
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,970
Give it here, begum.
Give it.

578
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,710
Now will you come out,
or shall I join you?

579
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:37,866
No, no, no, don't come here, begum.
What are you saying?

580
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,819
You... I... I'm showering, begum.
What sort of woman are you?

581
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,440
Boss!

582
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,820
- And the thing?
- It's in here.

583
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,029
[Singing]

584
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,100
[Singing continues.]

585
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,280
Oh, my dear! Begum!

586
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,060
Snake! Snake!
Help! Snake!

587
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,550
Who's this, begum?

588
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,700
Raj Kapoor?

589
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,840
Didn't I tell you I know
how to catch snakes?

590
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,450
And don't you remember?
I'd told you I'm not Raj Kapoor.

591
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,840
- Then who are you?
- Whoever I am, I'm very nice. Isn't that so?

592
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,730
But... you...

593
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,650
- Such deceit!
- Even my heart had deceived me at Juhu.

594
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,160
I was left gazing after you, while
my heart traveled with you to Pune.

595
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,100
So this charade was planned
to take back your heart?

596
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,800
- If you have no use for it, return it.
- Whom do I address it to?

597
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,190
His Highness Rajkumar,
C/o any police station, Bombay.

598
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,716
'Raj Kapoor' at times...
'Rajkumar' at others...

599
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,149
If you want to say my name
with love... then, Rajan.

600
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,000
- Rajan!
- Again.

601
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:09,990
- Say that once again.
- Rajan.

602
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,760
I wish... I wish... I could
take your photograph.

603
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,006
My photographs were published in
the newspapers. Didn't you see them?

604
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,660
- I saw them and thought...
- What?

605
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,150
All the world's rogues
will be chasing you.

606
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,560
- There's one right here.
- You're right.

607
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:34,930
- Then you tell me what I should do.
- You fraud...

608
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,009
Hey, listen!

609
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,080
Hey, tarry awhile; where are you
going, my crazy girl?

610
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,330
- Won't someone stop her?
- Okay

611
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,850
Promise me
that you will never...

612
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,960
- deceive me.
- Okay!

613
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,290
You put on a show
of being rich...

614
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,790
but you really are Mr. Fraud

615
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,250
I'm not like that at all...

616
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:39,020
- so clean up your act when you visit.
- Okay!

617
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,859
Promise me...
that you will never

618
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,970
- deceive me
- Okay!

619
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,720
Your whimsies are rather attractive...

620
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,160
and rip the strands of my heart

621
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,259
Please warn your graces...

622
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,460
- to stop this atom bomb,
- Okay!

623
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,279
Tarry awhile; where are you
going, my crazy girl?

624
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,180
- Won't someone stop her?
- Okay!

625
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,900
You're passionate, I'm carefree

626
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,340
We're two birds of a feather

627
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,050
If you consent,
perhaps I can live...

628
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,940
- for a couple of days loving you.
- Okay

629
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,609
Hey, Rajan, the lift isn't halting.

630
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,020
Tarry awhile, where are you
going, my crazy girl?

631
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,930
- Won't someone stop her?
- Okay

632
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:16,780
Promise me that you will never...

633
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,290
- deceive me.
- Okay

634
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,000
Got here, big brother?

635
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,230
You won the gamble at the station,
so you took her away.

636
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,390
I'll handle it from here.

637
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,380
Aren't you stretching a bit?

638
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,296
How dare you try
to abduct another's wife?

639
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,530
I need the money, not a wife. Give
me the Rs.100,000, you keep the wife.

640
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,950
She's not my wife.
She's the golden goose.

641
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,860
A golden goose! I'd to use
many a subterfuge to get her.

642
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,379
Let's do one thing.
Give me the gold...

643
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:40,779
- and you keep the goose. Yes?
- The problem is even I prefer the gold.

644
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:45,060
- Isn't the game going too far, big brother?
- The game can end too.

645
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:48,160
- Can't we reach an agreement?
- What do you want?

646
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,230
The fruits of my labor, which I
would have got from her uncle.

647
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,899
You give me Rs.10,000 and
I'll consider you her uncle.

648
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,930
- What do you think?
- Hmm, you seem to be an intelligent man.

649
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,140
- Here. Take this.
- That's more like it.

650
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,680
Uncle Badruddin,
you are very lucky.

651
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:19,270
Uncle, one doesn't usually get something
worth Rs.100,000 for just Rs.10,000.

652
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,940
Forgive me, Khan Saab.
I was broke, my friend.

653
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,410
Sorry, huh... Bye.

654
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,650
We've searched her, boss.
We've searched her bags too.

655
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,080
- We found nothing.
- Then why was this fake advertisement published?

656
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,530
- I'm asking you, girl!
- My uncle...

657
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,430
is the trustee of my wealth.
It's worth millions.

658
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,759
He wants to kill me
to usurp that wealth.

659
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:09,350
Hmm... I'll keep you alive
to obtain that same wealth.

660
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,960
I've already given away
Rs.10,000 as reward.

661
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,490
I'll have to recoup that
from your dastardly uncle.

662
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,100
I'm not a cheat! It's true...

663
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:31,230
Have you begun to deceive yourself,
Rajan? You? Gambling for big stakes?

664
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,640
- Where did you get this from?
- He must have ruined some innocent soul.

665
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,080
You've strangled my hopes.

666
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,770
You've auctioned my love
for you.

667
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,140
You've strangled me!

668
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:48,350
- Why, had enough? - He's folded.
- Can't you stop it?

669
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,859
- Die, Rajan!
- Die! And that's the end of that nuisance.

670
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:56,010
If you thought me a nuisance, you should
have killed me, torn me to pieces...

671
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,670
- But... this betrayal? This deceit? Why?
- Why?

672
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,870
Why? Because this is what
the world taught me.

673
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,270
The years molded me.

674
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,170
My principles are underlined by fraud;
deceit governs my life.

675
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:13,430
I'm what I am. I can't change.
No one can make me change.

676
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:17,110
And that's because you haven't
known a mother's love...

677
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,580
You do not recognise
a sister's affection.

678
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,320
Nor are you fated
to realize a wife's ardor.

679
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:27,370
You've never sought your life's goals
in another's eyes.

680
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,410
You have lost, Rajan.
You haven't gained anything.

681
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,800
You're an unfortunate man.
You spurned me...

682
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,950
Me! The person who could have
given you the world.

683
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,040
The one person who could have
given you everything you wanted.

684
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,380
The one who could have given
you everything.

685
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:48,560
You are right. You could have
given me everything.

686
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,940
I'll look for you.

687
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,390
I'll look for you, Madhu.

688
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,160
It would be great, my friend...

689
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,360
if, at the New Year's party,
this girl, Madhu Sharma...

690
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,970
- Yes?
- Would be present.

691
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,529
- Word!
- We have our little ways to bring her around, pal.

692
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,799
- Really! - Really?
- Yes. - Is that so?

693
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,290
Then, get her into
such a mood...

694
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,509
such a mood
that she gets flirty...

695
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:21,320
and says, "I'm in love,
I'm in love with you...

696
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,330
Oh, my, what do I do?"

697
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:35,460
I've fallen in love with you,
oh, what do I do?

698
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:09,120
My piercing gaze, babuji...

699
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,900
has learned to cast hundreds
of magic spells

700
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,570
Stir this intoxicating gaze of mine
into your goblet of wine

701
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,470
Drink to your heart's content.
Live to the fullest

702
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,340
Go on, drink up!

703
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:32,740
I've fallen in love with you,
oh, what do I do?

704
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,480
Everyone's crazy about my beauty,
Mister John

705
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,400
They flutter like moths
around this flame, O Baba Khan

706
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:11,180
You are a cartoon,
you are a braggart

707
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,960
Your moustache resembles
the tail of a bear

708
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,980
And here I go...

709
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,700
Well, alright, bye-bye

710
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:28,640
We've fallen in love with you,
oh, what do we do?

711
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:50,540
- Madhu's gone? - Gone.
- Where did she go?

712
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:52,890
- Come, let's look for her. Gopi!
- Yes?

713
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,446
Go look for her!
I'll call Boss.

714
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:06,299
Tell me... What?!
But where were you?

715
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,050
Go after them! They shouldn't be
allowed to get away. I'm coming.

716
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,060
What happened?
Where are you going?

717
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,500
Someone's broken into the safe
and stolen the money.

718
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,100
I'm going to the police.

719
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,770
I don't understand your business.

720
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,790
You have to get up at night
to go to the police.

721
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,500
- Let go. - I want to tell you something.
- Let go, they're coming. - Listen!

722
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,190
You dare come in between?
Kick him! Teach him a lesson!

723
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,939
Who's... Who is that?

724
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,870
I... I'm not a thief.

725
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:08,540
Those brigands are after me.
They will kill me.

726
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,029
- Please save me, my sister.
- Who are they?

727
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:16,120
- Why do they want to kill you?
- Thieves... thieves...

728
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,649
They want to stake my life
for the money it will win them.

729
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,000
Don't worry, my dear.
No one can harm you here.

730
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,709
- It won't take them long to get here.
- I'll shut all the doors.

731
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,320
Sit down and relax.
Look, there's water there.

732
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,640
Have some water, you'll feel
better. Don't worry.

733
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:06,419
Hey, what's this? Don't worry,
my dear. I've closed all the doors.

734
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,580
Open the doors, my sister.

735
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,340
Fate has thrown me back
into his snare.

736
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:20,490
- Sister!
- Whose snare? What do you mean?

737
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,830
If this house... if this house
belongs to the man...

738
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,680
- whose portrait this is...
- This is my husband's portrait.

739
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,440
No! No! No... this portrait is that
of the brigand...

740
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,690
who's trying to kill me.

741
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:40,770
You're lying! Your tears cannot
besmirch my husband's honor.

742
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,940
- The whole world knows him to be a good man.
- No!

743
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:51,740
No... you've mistaken
the Devil for God.

744
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,610
Open the door.

745
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,950
If this girl escapes,
the Boss will kill all of us.

746
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,270
- Let go of me. - Boss...
- Let go! - We've got the girl.

747
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,400
- Let go of me!
- Very good!

748
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,900
Now she'll know the consequences
of escaping from our custody.

749
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,320
Remove the veil!

750
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,650
The veil has fallen.

751
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,690
You cannot fool me any more.

752
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,560
- But...
- Has the cat got your tongue?

753
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
- Why don't you ask how I got here?
- How?

754
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,846
You went in search of a thief...

755
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,660
and Fate brought her
to your house.

756
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,520
That innocent girl is not
a thief. You are!

757
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,629
- Kamala... Leave us alone!
- No!

758
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,850
Let them know who I am.

759
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,790
Let them know your
alternate reality.

760
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,490
They should also know...

761
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,830
that those who abduct women, can
have their womenfolk abducted too.

762
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,140
This is how they're abducted.

763
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,680
Enough! Enough, Kamala!

764
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,620
You haven't seen
the world I have seen.

765
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,580
The world of a brigand?

766
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:26,670
One who has caused people
immense pain!

767
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,390
One who has murdered innocents.

768
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:32,456
One who set others' peace
and happiness ablaze...

769
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,880
to illuminate his home.

770
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,720
I saw you...

771
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:41,280
- and thought you were God.
- God?!

772
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,650
God? God has
no place in my life.

773
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,850
How can God enter
the Devil's domain?

774
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,600
You lifeless stone idol,
watch this if you can...

775
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,470
Today, I've established a world
where there is no place for you!

776
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,400
This is my victory!
This is my triumph!

777
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,270
No! No! No...
this is your downfall.

778
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,410
Don't consider this
your victory. Why?

779
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:13,900
Because, today, I'm leaving you
in a world of darkness.

780
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,529
- My dear wife!
- Don't you dare!

781
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:19,100
Don't call me that!
My child...

782
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,850
will not be born to be called
the child of a thief and a brigand.

783
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:24,490
You won't be able
to see your son!

784
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,620
You won't be able
to hear his voice!

785
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,849
Even your shadow
will not darken his life.

786
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,930
You will look for us everywhere
but will never find us.

787
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,290
You've mistaken
the Devil for God.

788
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:55,350
My child will not be known as
the child of a thief and brigand.

789
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:58,620
Even your shadow
will not darken my son's life.

790
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:43,266
I had lost my senses,
I was befuddled.

791
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:45,729
But what were you all doing?
Why didn't you stop her?

792
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,630
Her tears left us
stunned too, boss.

793
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,340
This should not have happened.
Go, look for her, all of you!

794
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,660
And if you don't find her,
I'll smash your heads!

795
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,020
I took many blood
samples, Mr. Rajkumar.

796
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:05,210
But... only yours matched.

797
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:10,110
Then, what's the problem, doctor? If
my blood can save her, here it is.

798
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,170
- Really?
- My child...

799
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,780
I... I don't want the
blood of a thief.

800
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,450
I don't want the
blood of a thief.

801
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:28,160
I don't want the
blood of a thief.

802
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:32,140
- I don't want it.
- Are you ready, Rajkumar?

803
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,690
No! No...

804
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,110
What happened, Rajkumar?

805
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:46,890
Didn't you hear, Doctor? "I don't want
the blood of a thief."

806
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,750
And you know, Doctor,
that I am a thief.

807
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,776
I'm not a good man.
My blood will poison her.

808
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,480
It will kill her. I don't wish to kill her.
Don't give her my blood.

809
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,510
But your blood will save her,
Rajkumar. It's God's will.

810
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:03,000
Or your blood would not
have matched hers.

811
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,440
These emotions wouldn't have
made themselves felt.

812
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,716
You have changed, Rajkumar.
Come, don't waste time.

813
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,240
It doesn't feel right, doctor...

814
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:13,040
This is the first sign
of humanity.

815
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:17,120
Good has triumphed over evil.
Congratulations.

816
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:18,750
Congratulations.

817
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,790
God...

818
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,110
years ago, in front of you...

819
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:32,219
at this very place,
I'd spurned your world.

820
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,190
I'd vowed I would
create my own world.

821
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:39,330
I did everything your world
would consider disreputable.

822
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,710
If you could, I'm sure you
would have witnessed that...

823
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,610
that today, your world
bows to me.

824
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:52,620
Yet, I continued to cling to the
one good thing in your world.

825
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:56,020
I loved my wife.

826
01:11:56,290 --> 01:12:02,400
And now, when that love was to bear
another soul who would hate your world...

827
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,820
you took that life itself
from me.

828
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,160
Remember this, O God...

829
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,330
the flames of my vengeance
will never be doused.

830
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:14,960
If my wife doesn't
return home by morning...

831
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,150
I'll destroy everything
that's beautiful in your world.

832
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,880
And wherever I see
another innocent soul...

833
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,050
I'll silence it... like this!

834
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,930
I... I...

835
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,710
- I'm alive?
- Yes...

836
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,730
Far from death.
You're in my house.

837
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,920
But I wanted to die.

838
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:01,929
- You saved me.
- God did.

839
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,930
- It's His will.
- But I don't want to live.

840
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:11,240
I don't want the shadow of a thief and
brigand to fall upon my unborn child.

841
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,800
The shadow of a thief
and brigand...

842
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,540
- Who's that brigand?
- The father of the child I bear.

843
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:25,370
Your husband?
What's his name?

844
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,210
I wouldn't speak his name
then because I was his wife.

845
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,460
And now I won't speak his name
because it's disreputable.

846
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,400
I want neither this child,
nor this life.

847
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:43,016
Let me die! I want no trace
of this name to remain...

848
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,340
Don't say that.

849
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,720
You can destroy his lineage,
but the stains will remain.

850
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,730
Your child will be born, my sister.
It'll definitely be born.

851
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:01,070
A child... who doesn't know
his father's name...

852
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,470
who will never see
his father's face...

853
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:09,450
what will his life be like?

854
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,390
His life will be what
you wish it to be.

855
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:19,900
I... I myself... am...

856
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,450
this house...

857
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,960
Please consider me your brother.

858
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,060
I... I...

859
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:36,770
I'll... I'll consider my sister's child
dearer than my own.

860
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,040
I swear...
I swear that...

861
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,401
even the shadow of a thief
shall not fall upon your child.

862
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:46,700
The rent has increased.
And the doctor has asked you...

863
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,860
to arrange for some money
if possible.

864
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,570
Earlier, we used to
double our money, Boss.

865
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,670
You decided to go straight,
but our families are starving.

866
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,776
Come back to our
old business, Boss.

867
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,166
- Drop this scourge!
- Everything will be fine, Boss.

868
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:03,330
Your boss is dead! Thieves and theft
will not come near this house.

869
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,060
My sister needed good food, milk,
medicines... I couldn't give her anything,

870
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,170
except my honesty, my friends.

871
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:14,570
Everyone may die, but I'll never let
her faith be extinguished.

872
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,240
God!

873
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,500
I want to sell this ring.

874
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:37,580
It looks simple but I'll have
to inquire about its value.

875
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,070
Please wait.

876
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,370
Look, you can't get
more than Rs.25 for this.

877
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,480
- Only Rs.25?
- Yes.

878
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,240
It's an expensive watch.
Just Rs.25... Madhu...

879
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,330
What? The girl is in the shop?

880
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,179
Don't let her go. I'm coming.

881
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,599
Believe me... I've changed.

882
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,890
- Trust me.
- I'd trusted you.

883
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:13,440
But you sold me... you auctioned me
off to the highest bidder.

884
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:16,290
- I hate you!
- Listen!

885
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,220
I love you.

886
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,860
I think about it day and night.
I'm filled with regret.

887
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,060
I go crazy wondering why
I sold my beloved to that goon.

888
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:33,910
- Trust me!
- The man you call a goon?

889
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,490
I can trust him. Not you.

890
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,820
I know what will happen
if he finds me.

891
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:41,280
But with you... anything.

892
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,660
You heard that?

893
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:47,250
Between the two of us,
the girl trusts me more...

894
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,250
- than you.
- Don't interfere. This is a personal matter.

895
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,540
I have bought this personal matter
for Rs.10,000.

896
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,950
- Understand?
- Rajan!

897
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,920
- Learned your lesson?
- Rajan!

898
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:13,010
Look at this, Mr. Chaubey.
Look... look at it carefully.

899
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,370
The mark of that size 12 shoe
is imprinted on my face.

900
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,630
Trust me, Mr. Chaubey, I can
catch him just like that!

901
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:19,626
You mean to say such a big
police department...

902
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:21,759
runs on the help of
pickpockets like you? Huh?

903
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,710
Get lost! Wise guy.

904
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:28,440
Mr. Chaubey, firstly,
I'm no longer a thief.

905
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,120
And that's why I starve, like any
ordinary, respectable person.

906
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,030
And secondly, the fact is I've
taken on some responsibilities.

907
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:39,690
Really? Congratulations!
Have you got married?

908
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:43,559
No, no... My respected elder sister
has come to stay with me.

909
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,230
That's why I've given up thieving.
I want to live honestly.

910
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,416
Mr. Chaubey, life has handed me a
great opportunity. If you help me...

911
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,379
I'll be successful too... and,
Mr. Chaubey, you'll also get a raise.

912
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,870
Arre, why are you always concerned
about my salary? Huh?

913
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:59,436
What's the matter? Do you think
you can handle that brigand?

914
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:02,046
Mr. Chaubey, absolutely! Absolutely!
Just hear me out...[whispers]

915
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:05,040
[Whispers]

916
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:10,469
I have some good news, Boss.
We have a buyer for our diamonds.

917
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:14,410
- He offers hard cash.
- You don't think it's a con, do you?

918
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,920
When it's a matter of life and death,
I'm never deceived, Boss.

919
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,000
- Who is he?
- He's the Prince of the underworld.

920
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,450
Extremely wealthy, and
deals in hard cash.

921
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,116
Just a little bit of alcohol,
and a comely young girl...

922
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,040
and Boss, a little bit
of music thrown in...

923
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:34,010
and then listen to the
joyous tinkle of money rolling in.

924
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,270
Welcome, your highness.
Please come in.

925
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:40,510
[Speaking 'foreign' language.]

926
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,276
[Speaking 'foreign' language.]

927
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:51,010
- What did you say?
- The arrangements are wonderful.

928
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:52,870
I'm flattered.

929
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,620
[Incomprehensible]

930
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:28,059
Beautiful! What a sweet voice!
Can I entertain some hopes?

931
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:32,940
We don't disappoint our guests.
But my heart is closed to men.

932
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,410
Oh, I see you have been
deceived in love. Hmm?

933
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,849
- How can you say that?
- My ancestors were astrologers.

934
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:43,530
I'm an astrologer. I can tell you
the secrets of your heart.

935
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:47,630
- What can you tell me?
- Ah... when you met him...

936
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,759
neither you nor he
were the same again.

937
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,320
You were deceiving the world,
and he was deceiving you.

938
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:58,256
- You've thrown me into confusion.
- How can I do that?

939
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,880
You're still in love with him.

940
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,550
You're bashful here; while over there,
he is repentant.

941
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,900
- He's repentant?
- Very repentant. He loves you a lot, my dear.

942
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:08,770
Will he... will he meet me once?
Just once?

943
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,740
- Do you love him too?
- Very much.

944
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:14,550
- Really?
- I love and hate him equally.

945
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:17,080
- Swear upon God, you love him?
- Yes!

946
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,370
You love him very much?

[Incomprehensible]

01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:57,160
Listen, love, you are my world

01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:02,370
Come, let's be in love, my beloved,
and all these hurdles will vanish

Our hearts have begun
to beat as one

973
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:12,650
Who's celebrating in my heart today,
who's on a picnic?

974
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,370
By God! I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

975
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,031
- Now tell me, how can I be of service?
- Your highness...

976
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:24,230
Thank you for doing me the honor
of stepping into my humble home.

977
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:27,030
- Now, down to business.
- Of course.

978
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:29,720
But I'd prefer to
talk business in private.

979
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,290
Your men will have to wait here.

980
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:35,730
Oh! Er... will your men
wait here too?

981
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:38,440
- Absolutely! Without a doubt. Please come this way.
- Let's go.

982
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,610
Show me the necklace.

983

Look at this!
Look at this, your highness.

I swear! Tell me the price!

987

Its price? Its price is
Rs.120,000.

988
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:12,366
- Rs. 120,000? - Rs.12 lakh.
- Rs.12 lakh? Abdullah, come quickly, come here.

989
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,940
- Why are you calling Abdullah?
- Oh, don't worry...

990
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:17,680
- he's my cashier. - Oh.
- Take out the money.

991
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,990
Here, take the money.
Rs.12 lakh.

992

Oh ho ho... by God!
What an amazing piece!

993
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,550
What will my wife say
when she wears this!

994
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,540
You are under arrest, Mr. Jagan!

995
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,050
- What are you doing, Abdullah?
- You're under arrest, too.

996
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,370
Get up, Jagan. Don't you dare
try escape!

997
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,326
Listen... arrest everybody! Nobody
should be allowed to escape!

998
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:41,650
Come with me.

- Yes, tell me.
- There are no charges against you.

1002
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,506
But you may be required as witness.
You may leave now.

1003
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:09,210
You haven't filed any charges against
that sweet-voiced beauty, have you?

Rajan Saab...

1007
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:51,890
My dear, if you want
to marry Mr. Rajan...

1008
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:54,380
I'm very happy.
But, come home.

1009

- I'll organise a grand wedding.
- Please don't interfere in this matter.

- Inspector saheb... - Hmm?
- Please make her understand...

Brother! Come home quickly.
Sister is very ill.

Madhu, I'll see you later.

1015

The midwife has also given up hope.
What will happen now?

1016
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:51,816
If anything happens to sister, then
God knows how Rajan will face it.

1017
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,930
He has pinned all his hopes
on this unborn child.

1018
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,490
God forbid if anything
happens to mother or child...

1019
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,390
Rajan will be shattered!

1020

Child?

1022
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,660
Another deception?

to ten years' imprisonment.

- Have you... again... No.
- Then?

1031
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:57,056
- This money?
- Have you forgotten that I'd helped nab a thief?

1032
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,160
The thief is behind bars and
I got the reward of Rs.10,000.

God bless that brigand.

The darkness of his fate
has illuminated our home.

Our home is illuminated.

All our worries are over, my sister.
The times have changed.

1037

This money will give us a new
home, a fresh life and happiness.

- Yes, Boss.

a theater company.

Theater company?
Where? Which one?

1042
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:33,680
She has gone out of the country
with the theater company.

- She went out of the country?
- Yes.

1044

She didn't even meet me?

1045
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:41,970
Did I commit an offence?

1046
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,920
What... what could
have gone wrong?

1047
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:58,200
Forget the past, sister.

1048
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:02,530
I joined your theater
so I could forget.

far away from his world.

- Far, far away...
- And after four years...

- when you return to Bombay?
- I'll never return to Bombay.

Now I will never come
to Bombay. Never!

- Yes.
- Right. Today I'll show you something new.

it has everything...

Madhu Sharma.

No one can meet her.

Please tell her that
Rajan wants to meet her.

01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,620
- So you are Mr. Rajan? - Yes.
- You cannot meet her at all.

Please go away from here.
Get out!

01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:00,670
- Look... - Mm?
- You take Raja to the hall.

1071
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,760
- Okay. - I'll think of something.
- Alright. Come on.

come here inebriated...

Today's our day, who knows
what the future holds?

1101

You deem me a stranger,
O, recognise your love

Why... why have you
come here?

01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:49,070
- Go away!
- Go away?

1107
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:53,090
I've been searching for you
for years. I found you today.

1108
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:57,389
What right do you have
to look for me? How dare you!

1109
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:00,660
Madhu, do I not have any right?

1110
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:05,040
- What's my offence, Madhu?
- Who are you that I should tell you your offence?

1111
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:09,120
- But, Madhu, listen...
- Baba... leave her be.

1112
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,850
- Come, let's go home. I'm hungry..
- Ln a moment.

1113
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:14,180
Go on, then. Go home.

1114
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:17,110
- Well done, well done! - The child is hungry!
- What a performance, sir!

1115
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:21,056
His performance was all very well, sethji,
but see what he's done to my face!

1116
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,460
It looks great. Your contract
is canceled from today.

1117
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,210
You're the villain,
and he's the hero.

1118
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:27,210
Throw this hero out!

1119
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,520
He's such a fine actor, gives a
performance worth a lakh of rupees.

1120
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:33,010
It's either him or me,
Seth saheb.

1121
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,009
What will I do without you?

1122
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:37,780
Heroes like him are
a dime a dozen.

1123
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,560
Go on, get out! Go!

1124
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:56,580
- Hey, Raja, wait up!
- Hurry up, mother.

1125
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,120
Oh ho! Where are you going,
Raja Saab?

1126
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:06,170
- Arre! - Raja!
- Raja Saab is...

1127
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:09,830
going to Ranibagh.
A motor car is going with him.

1128
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:12,620
And it will race with me.

1129
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:15,650
- Here, boss.
- Idiot! No.18... - Boss!

1130
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:18,260
- Sorry, Boss.
- Come on, come on...

1131
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,720
- Raja!
- See how close it is, mother! - Raja!

1132
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,240
- Catch up with the car ahead, driver!
- Follow it.

1133
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,250
Take the pistol...

1134
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,530
Before Madhu can escape,
kill her!

1135
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:50,389
- When?
- Now!

1136
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,580
- But, Boss...
- No ifs and buts!

1137
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:54,389
- Throw the ball!
- Come on, come on!

1138
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:14,496
[Muffled shouts and exclamations.]

1139
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,866
- The child is all right.
- What happened?

1140
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:18,590
- Let me assist you.
- Leave it be.

1141
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:22,420
[Muffled conversation.]

1142
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:27,780
If the child's mother or any of his
relatives inquire about him...

1143
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:30,741
- tell them Madhu Sharma has taken him. Come on, driver.
- Yes, ma'am.

1144
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:33,559
- Arre, which Madhu Sharma?
- She... - Raja!

1145
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,960
Don't worry, ma'am, your child
is fine. He had fainted...

1146
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,976
The famous actress, Madhu Sharma,
took him away.

1147
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,300
- Madhu Sharma?
- Yes.

1148
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,650
She's Mr. Jagan's wife.

1149
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:45,730
Boss, that child must surely
be his, too.

1150
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:49,460
- Bhabhi! [Sister-in-law] - How does it
matter to you? Get in.

1151
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,400
- But Boss...
- Come on! Driver!

1152
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:57,426
- He met with an accident, bhaiyya.
- Accident?

1153
01:38:57,450 --> 01:39:01,050
Yes. And some actress called
Madhu Sharma took him away.

1154
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:04,630
- Madhu Sharma... where? Which hospital?
- I don't know, bhaiya!

1155
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:07,260
People said he was slightly hurt.

1156
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:10,930
- Bhaiyya! Bhaiyya...
- Don't worry, my sister.

1157
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,320
- Don't worry. I'll bring him back.
- Bhaiyya!

1158
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,320
Why did you bring me here?

1159
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,059
My car hit you...

1160
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,410
- and you fell unconscious.
- So you did me a favor?

1161
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,790
Yesterday, you threw my Baba out,
and today you're doing me a favor?

1162
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,580
You love your Baba
very much, don't you?

1163
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,200
Baba loves me too.

1164
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,820
- Really?
- Yes.

1165
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:40,309
- Listen... - Mm?
- Your Baba...

1166
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,110
does he love your mother
very much?

1167
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,650
Why wouldn't he?
Mother loves him a lot too.

1168
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:48,840
You're the only one
who fights with him.

1169
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,700
What do you know...

1170
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:02,950
Anyway... alright, tell me...

1171
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:06,870
does your Baba love
your other siblings too?

1172
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:10,500
My siblings?
Where do I have any?

1173
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:13,840
Why? Your Baba didn't have
any other children?

1174
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:17,549
- When did my Baba get married?
- What?

1175
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:20,670
Not married?

1176
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,360
Then how's your mother
related to your Baba?

1177
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:25,940
My mother is Baba's...

1178
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:32,340
Catch him! Catch him...

1179
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:36,019
Raja! My dear,
you've saved my life!

1180
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,559
- Come on, Raja.
- Rajan!

1181
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,490
- Take him.
- Okay.

1182
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,730
Rajan! Rajan...

1183
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,760
- Let me go.
- I've got you back with such difficulty.

1184
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:53,360
- How can I just let you go?
- Then don't let me leave, Madhu.

1185
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:56,250
Have me thrown out.
Call your men.

1186
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:00,250
- Won't you forgive me?
- Why are you mocking me?

1187
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,610
I am an ordinary
motor mechanic...

1188
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:06,900
and you... a
world famous actress.

1189
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:09,100
Please don't shame me.

1190
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:14,016
I... I thought you were
a married man...

1191
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,670
and so, left you, Rajan.

1192
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:21,600
Believe me, I love you more
than I love myself.

1193
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:24,410
I've pined for you
all these years.

1194
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:30,520
You punished both of us for
such a tiny misunderstanding?

1195
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,540
I'm culpable. Punish me.

1196
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:39,990
- What punishment can I give you?
- I'd you...

1197
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,589
thrown out;
you... you can slap me.

1198
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,969
- How many?
- One.

1199
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,599
- That won't do.
- Two?

1200
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:55,769
All right then.
Make it eight... nine... ten...

1201
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:13,740
Your eyes shoot darts
as sharp as can be

1202
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,370
Not one or two
but eight, nine, and ten

1203
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:32,220
My love, I admit defeat.
Enough!

1204
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,589
Enough is enough

1205
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,940
O fair one, how are your
wrists so delicate?

1206
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:16,469
I surrender to you, my dearest

1207
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:22,330
I haven't ever seen such beauty,
slim as a sugarcane

1208
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:32,010
O how sweet you are...

1209
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:36,019
I've been ensared by
your charming conversation

1210
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:40,670
Not once, not twice,
but eight, nine, ten [times]

1211
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:45,339
O fair damsel,
I admit defeat... Enough!

1212
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,740
Enough is enough

1213
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:52,590
Your eyes shoot darts,
as sharp as can be

1214
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:25,700
Go on with you,
don't flirt with me

1215
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:29,389
You have twisted my delicate wrist

1216
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:35,140
You not only stole my heart
but also made a hue and cry about it

1217
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:44,429
Tell me, how do I not leave you?

1218
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:48,990
You cast taunts at me,
laughing all the while

1219
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,400
Not one, not two,
but eight, nine and ten

1220
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:57,970
My love, I admit defeat.
Enough!

1221
01:44:58,030 --> 01:45:00,420
Enough is enough

1222
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:05,330
Your eyes shoot darts
as sharp as can be

1223
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:38,130
My dearest, tell me,
where are you going...

1224
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:41,580
with that sparkle in your eyes?

1225
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,320
I'll love you, fair damsel,
I'll love only you

1226
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:55,770
Even if they arrest me
for loving you

1227
01:45:57,030 --> 01:46:00,780
My veins have begun to tremble

1228
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:05,530
Not once, not twice,
but eight, nine, and ten [times]

1229
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:09,950
Fair one, I admit defeat.
Enough!

1230
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:12,390
Enough is enough

1231
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:18,180
Your eyes throw darts
as sharp as can be...

1232
01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:49,889
Stay away from me, my love
Don't say I didn't warn you

1233
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,480
Keep your heart safe

1234
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:59,270
I may look innocent but
I'm as deadly as a bullet

1235
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:07,600
I have kept snakes as pets

1236
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:13,030
Your snake-like tresses
have already bitten me

1237
01:47:13,710 --> 01:47:16,936
Not once, not twice
but eight, nine and ten [times]

1238
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,430
Enough is enough

1239
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:23,120
Your eyes throw darts
as sharp as can be

1240
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:27,660
Not one, not two,
but eight, nine and ten

1241
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:32,110
My love, I admit defeat.
Enough

1242
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,700
Enough is enough

1243
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:39,310
Your eyes throw darts
as sharp can be

1244
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:56,620
- You're new here?
- Yes.

1245
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:00,650
- Babu! - Boss!
- How are you here? You had escaped, hadn't you?

1246
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:02,900
Thanks to your son, Boss!

1247
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:05,300
My son? I have no son.

1248
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,856
My son died, along with his mother,
even before he was born.

1249
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,770
No, Boss.
Your son is alive.

1250
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:14,150
- What are you saying?
- It's the truth, Boss. Come here.

1251
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:18,550
I saw both your wife
and your son.

1252
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,180
I wanted to speak
to bhabhi, Boss...

1253
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:24,799
- but Roshanlal stopped me.
- Roshanlal!

1254
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:28,440
- Is that wretch still involved in this story?
- Yes, Boss.

1255
01:48:29,410 --> 01:48:32,540
He wanted me to murder
his niece Madhu.

1256
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,219
Trust me, Boss.
I would have killed her...

1257
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,520
but your son saved her life.

1258
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,450
Your son's courage is amazing!

1259
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:44,389
So that means my son
has taken after me.

1260
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:47,650
I'm so unfortunate that
I cannot even see him.

1261
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:49,730
But you've seen him,
how does my son look?

1262
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:52,580
His facial features
resemble bhabhi's...

1263
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:54,990
and in courage, he
could be your clone.

1264
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:58,330
A mixture of you both.
That's your son.

1265
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:00,679
But I can't even see him once.

1266
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,070
Babu, can you tell me
where to find him?

1267
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:07,930
Roshanlal can tell you
where to find him, Boss.

1268
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:12,456
Roshanlal, Roshanlal!
Roshanlal...

1269
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:16,299
But how do I leave here?
How do I escape?

1270
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:22,560
No!...No!

1271
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,230
Such a huge defeat!
Such a complete rout!

1272
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:31,570
Can't this... can't one
put an end to this darkness?

1273
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:34,930
Can't these chains be broken?!

1274
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,600
I'll break these chains!

1275
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:39,930
I'll break these walls!

1276
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:41,530
I'll break them.

1277
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:54,530
He escaped!

1278
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,180
Mother... mother, look!

1279
01:50:25,290 --> 01:50:27,680
This criminal broke out of jail!

1280
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:35,070
Jagannath, your life is over.

1281
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,469
No, there's a spark of hope.

1282
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:43,330
And I'll extinguish
that spark like...

1283
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,820
I've come to you as
a desperate father, Roshan.

1284
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:51,790
I am searching for my child,
and you can help me.

1285
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:54,450
Roshanlal demands a price
for any help he offers.

1286
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,110
- What's the price?
- I'm willing to pay anything.

1287
01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:00,790
You will have to commit
two murders. Two.

1288
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:04,580
One for you.
And one for me.

1289
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:08,700
I have failed to remove Madhu
from my path.

1290
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:12,580
Now you have to murder her.

1291
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:16,730
- That's the first.
- And the other?

1292
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:19,220
Rajan. Your old enemy...

1293
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:22,280
- and Madhu's lover.
- No!

1294
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,240
I'll search for my son...

1295
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:27,400
on my own.

1296
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,330
And having met him once...

1297
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,910
having met him once,
if I'm not yet arrested...

1298
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,990
then, Roshanlal, two murders
will take place.

1299
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:39,790
One is you... and
the other, Rajan!

1300
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,410
Jagan! Now you can't escape!

1301
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:45,416
Inspector, I came
to meet my son...

1302
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,089
- Once I meet him, I'll surrender myself.
- No!

1303
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:49,710
Inspector...

1304
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,540
Jagan!

1305
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:01,450
Wretch! Escaped again!

1306
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,870
Why are you staring at me?
Follow him!

1307
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:07,550
- Found him?
- No! Not there either.

1308
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:09,220
- Look there!
- We did, sir.

1309
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:20,019
Ghost!...Ghost!

1310
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:22,900
- Ghost!
- Where?

1311
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:25,760
How silly! Are you scared?

1312
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:31,420
'Ghost, ghost' indeed! Let me see
what a ghost looks like.

1313
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:37,860
Hey, where did the ghost go?

1314
01:52:45,730 --> 01:52:47,129
Hey, ghost! Come out!

1315
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:53,150
- Are you in pain?
- Yes.

1316
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,200
Then why don't you say
that you need help?

1317
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,849
- But who will help me?
- I will.

1318
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,930
There was a dialog in the film,
Hunterwali...

1319
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:07,030
"The brave help the weak."

1320
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:09,480
And I'm brave.
Give me your hand.

1321
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,600
Come with me.

1322
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,060
Of course, my friend! I've
seen you somewhere before.

1323
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:39,220
He must be in
one of these houses.

1324
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:42,010
Yes... I remember.

1325
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:45,260
Your photo was published...

1326
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,010
- saying you were a brigand?
- Yes.

1327
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,020
You know that photo of yours?

1328
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:51,810
I showed it to my mother.

1329
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:53,900
Mother twisted
the newspaper and...

1330
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:58,190
and handed me
such a thrashing...

1331
01:53:58,510 --> 01:54:00,390
that I began to see stars.

1332
01:54:00,610 --> 01:54:02,469
If your mother came to know...

1333
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,990
that you helped a criminal...

1334
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:09,170
- then?
- So what will happen? I'll get another thrashing.

1335
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:11,030
Have you seen the film,
'Hatimtai'?

1336
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:14,780
Remember that character
who helped Hatimtai?

1337
01:54:18,270 --> 01:54:20,150
I'll fetch you something to eat.

1338
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:33,440
It seems like you fill
my thoughts

1339
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:46,839
You weren't there, but...

1340
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:55,320
it seems like
you are ever present

1341
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:10,170
What will you do, tell me,
if you fall in love with me?

1342
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:16,179
If I make you pine for me, tell me,
what will you do?

1343
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:49,840
Crazily attracted to
your divine beauty...

1344
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:56,130
I'll remove your veil
with trembling hands

1345
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:14,110
And if you can't get your hands on it,
tell me, what will you do?

1346
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:20,300
If I make you pine for me,
tell me, what will you do?

1347
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:26,320
What will you do, tell me,
if you fall in love with me?

1348
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:32,190
If I make you pine for me,
tell me, what will you do?

1349
01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:54,250
One day, you will be
caught unawares

1350
01:56:55,590 --> 01:57:00,320
And then I'll tarry awhile
in the shadow of your tresses

1351
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:18,180
And if you don't find that shade,
tell me, what will you do?

1352
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:24,380
If I make you pine for me,
tell me, what will you do?

1353
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:30,480
What will you do, tell me,
if you fall in love with me?

1354
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:36,180
If I make you pine for me,
tell me, what will you do?

1355
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:58,210
Those nights that will be lonesome
without you

1356
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:04,410
I will share my deepest feelings
with you in my dreams

1357
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:22,380
What will you do, tell me,
if you don't dream?

1358
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:28,480
If I make you pine for me,
tell me, what will you do?

1359
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:34,490
What will you do, tell me,
if you fall in love with me?

1360
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,580
If I make you pine for me,
tell me, what will you do?

1361
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,520
- Now?
- Hmm?

1362
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:06,770
- Now? I want to read your palm.
- Why?

1363
01:59:09,230 --> 01:59:12,379
I want to see how many
children you will have.

1364
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:19,669
What happened? The only hope I have
of finding my long-lost brother...

1365
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:21,969
- it can't be bought.

1366
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:24,710
Don't worry. I'll look for it too.
We'll surely find it.

1367
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,580
Found it! Rajan, I found it!

1368
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:49,980
I found it!
It's this, right?

1369
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:53,059
- Yes.
- Here.

1370
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:59,230
You keep it. This is
what I wanted to give you.

1371
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:01,860
- Rajan!
- It's a memento of my mother.

1372
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:04,049
Keep it safe, Madhu.

1373
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:14,050
- What happened?
- I've never known a mother's love.

1374
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:19,070
How nice it would have been,
had your brother been found too...

1375
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:21,110
and if mother was around.

1376
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:26,969
I don't have a mother, Madhu.
But, God gave me a sister instead.

1377
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:30,180
- She is mother, sister, everything...
- You talk about her everyday...

1378
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:33,320
- but never take me to meet her. Hmm?
- Shall we go today?

1379
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,950
- Let's meet her today? - Yes.
- Now? There's a Diwali puja at home today.

1380
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:40,870
We'll assume Goddess Lakshmi has
visited our humble abode. Come.

1381
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:43,160
Arre, I haven't even changed
after the show.

1382
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:44,880
Let me change. You go on.

1383
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,330
- Hmm?
- Please do come.

1384
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,130
My mother made my Baba
give up all his crooked ways.

1385
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,190
Didn't your son's mother
make you give up theft?

1386
02:00:57,530 --> 02:01:01,190
Son, I wish I was your Baba.

1387
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:06,570
My father was a great thief too.

1388
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,890
But when mother came,
he straightened up.

1389
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:13,030
Once he stopped thieving,
we starved.

1390
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:17,960
Mother was ill and I
was just about to be born.

1391
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:23,610
- There wasn't a penny at home.
- Who told you all this, son?

1392
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:26,610
Baba, of course. Who else?

1393
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:31,440
- And yet he didn't steal?
- Not at all.

1394
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:35,640
- Then what did he do?
- He caught a big criminal.

1395
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,200
- Someone like you.
- Then? - Then what?

1396
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:41,540
Just like a hero gets rewarded
for catching a criminal...

1397
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:44,610
my Baba too got a reward.
Rs.10,000!

1398
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:47,830
- Rs.10,000?
- Yes.

1399
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:52,530
Then I was born
and mother got well.

1400
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:56,500
Then we had a new home
and everything was alright.

1401
02:01:58,370 --> 02:01:59,780
Everything became all right.

1402
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:04,759
Everything became alright!
Child of my enemy...

1403
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:08,570
your father built a new house;
he began life anew!

1404
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:11,809
Why don't I just
strangle you? Why?

1405
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:14,250
Have you stooped so low, Jagan?

1406
02:02:14,970 --> 02:02:18,150
Avenging yourself on this
innocent child? Shame on you!

1407
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:22,059
- What happened then?
- Mother blessed the criminal...

1408
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:26,390
saying that he had
done us many favors.

1409
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:38,000
Do you know, my son,
who that thief was?

1410
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,940
Mother doesn't know
and Baba doesn't tell me.

1411
02:02:42,350 --> 02:02:43,550
That criminal...

1412
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:48,400
I was that criminal, son.

1413
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:07,890
You?

1414
02:03:10,230 --> 02:03:12,379
You escaped from prison
and found refuge in my home?

1415
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:16,640
Yes, in that house, which was built
with the reward for my arrest.

1416
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,010
I had vowed not to allow even the
shadow of a thief to fall on Raja.

1417
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:24,560
- Go downstairs, Raja!
- No! Let the child remain here.

1418
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:27,490
- He sheltered me.
- Sheltered? - Yes.

1419
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:30,520
I was hiding from the cops
when this child brought me here.

1420
02:03:30,690 --> 02:03:33,169
- I didn't know this was your home.
- Come here, Raja!

1421
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:35,990
- Come here, Raja!
- Why did you bring this man here?

1422
02:03:36,270 --> 02:03:39,660
Why? Does your mother know
you've given refuge to a criminal?

1423
02:03:40,150 --> 02:03:41,349
No, Baba.

1424
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:46,600
- Mother hates thieves and rogues.
- She hates them.

1425
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:49,230
- And you help them.
- No, Baba...

1426
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,730
he too, has a child like me.

1427
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:55,410
- He's looking for him.
- So how does that concern you?

1428
02:03:57,820 --> 02:04:00,019
You lie to deceive
even this innocent boy?

1429
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:04,860
- The times are bad. Even my truths
are seen as lies.- Get lost!

1430
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,860
- I won't let you ruin this house.
- My life is being ruined.

1431
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:11,040
If I go out of this house, they will
catch me and hang me.

1432
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:13,350
Then I won't
be able to see my son.

1433
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:17,320
- I have no sympathy for thieves.
- I may be a thief...

1434
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:21,410
but I am also a father.
Let me stay here tonight.

1435
02:04:21,450 --> 02:04:23,886
I beg of you. You won't
see my face in the morning.

1436
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:26,550
I don't want to see it even now.
A thief in this house...

1437
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,340
Don't forget you
were a thief, too!

1438
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:33,250
I used to be, but not any more.

1439
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,280
You could never know
why I changed.

1440
02:04:38,230 --> 02:04:40,530
Whose hard work and
whose faith built this home.

1441
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:43,050
You must have had the support
of a good person.

1442
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:47,840
Once, I had the support
of a good person too.

1443
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:51,540
But you were fortunate that
you reformed yourself.

1444
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:55,740
Whereas I remained who I was. Still...
you and I share the same brotherhood.

1445
02:04:56,170 --> 02:04:57,800
As a brother, give me sanctuary.

1446
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:03,220
Even if you had been my biological
brother, I still wouldn't let you stay.

1447
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:05,870
- Get out!
- One night, just one night.

1448
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:08,180
- Get out!
- Let me stay for one night... - Get out!

1449
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,670
- No, Baba!, no!
- Raja!

1450
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:12,280
I won't let him go. He has
done us many favors.

1451
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:14,610
Raja! Move aside, Raja!

1452
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:17,860
You struck this innocent child!

1453
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:20,556
- Had you not been his father...
- What are you saying?

1454
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:23,470
I would have broken your neck!
Now you will leave here.

1455
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:25,260
Go on! Get out of here!

1456
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:41,630
Open the door!

1457
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:53,389
- Is there no one here?
- Raja! My son!

1458
02:05:54,710 --> 02:05:56,810
- It seems the rogue has taken Raja too.
- Bhaiyya!

1459
02:05:57,350 --> 02:06:00,300
- Find my Raja! Find my son, bhaiyya!
- Don't worry.

1460
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:02,660
I'll definitely find Raja.

1461
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,500
Mr. Rajan... this way!

1462
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:15,860
This is the photo of
the man who took Raja.

1463
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:18,850
He's the same rogue I helped nab,
for which I was rewarded.

1464
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:23,720
- He's my husband.
- What are you saying? - Yes...

1465
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:28,990
But Raja doesn't know
he's his father.

1466
02:06:30,710 --> 02:06:33,010
So he found out
that we stay here.

1467
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:37,050
- That's why he's taken my Raja away.
- No, my sister.

1468
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:39,640
- He doesn't know Raja is his son either.
- No?

1469
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:42,360
No! Raja!

1470
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:44,850
Raja!

1471
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:54,170
- Have courage, sister.
- How do I be brave, bhaiyya?

1472
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:57,840
He'll surely eke out
his revenge on Raja.

1473
02:06:57,930 --> 02:07:00,070
Trust me, I will
bring Raja back.

1474
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:01,980
I'll stake my life
to bring him back.

1475
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:05,090
- May I come in?
- Madhu...

1476
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:09,880
our Diwali has been ruined.
She is my older sister.

1477
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:11,920
This is Madhu.
I'll meet you later.

1478
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:20,580
- I have seen you somewhere.
- You look familiar, too.

1479
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:26,070
- This... is this yours?
- Yes, Rajan gave it to me.

1480
02:07:27,090 --> 02:07:30,020
It's a memento of his late mother
and long-lost brother.

1481
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:34,360
Rajan? Long-lost brother?

1482
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:37,710
Then they are brothers!

1483
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,380
- This is a disaster, a disaster!
- What happened?

1484
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,860
- No, not him.
- This one?

1485
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:48,700
- Not this one.
- Raja!

1486
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:57,679
Now nobody can harm you.
God has offered us sanctuary.

1487
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:00,260
I don't want to face Him.

1488
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:02,410
Then why does he
keep calling me?

1489
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:04,400
- Come let's leave.
- Where will you go?

1490
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:08,730
- Where there is no God.
- But God is everywhere.

1491
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:12,300
- Come on! Fold your hands.
- No!

1492
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:15,650
I used to think you
a good man, my friend.

1493
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:19,730
Son, you don't know the punishments
he's inflicted upon me!

1494
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:24,180
What are you saying?
Can God ever be harsh?

1495
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:27,420
Wasn't he harsh when he took my
parents away in my childhood?

1496
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:31,000
I had a younger brother,
he separated us.

1497
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:35,269
And soon, we were separated
like a broken string of beads.

1498
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:37,970
Do you still expect me
to pray to Him?

1499
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:41,160
I stopped praying to him.

1500
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:44,790
He must have been testing you.
Mother used to say...

1501
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:47,850
that when God loves you,
he also tests you.

1502
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:50,050
He gives you a few sorrows too.

1503
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:52,980
Didn't your mother
teach you even this?

1504
02:09:53,930 --> 02:09:55,440
He took my mother too.

1505
02:09:56,710 --> 02:10:00,080
I made my own world.
I had a wife...

1506
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:02,509
I was about to be a father.

1507
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,380
He snatched them away too.

1508
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:07,160
All my life, He's only
taken from me...

1509
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:12,120
It's good that God
didn't give you your son.

1510
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:14,890
Or you would have made him
exactly like you!

1511
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:20,330
- Why? Why don't you speak?
- What do I say?

1512
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:23,516
- Do you want your child? - Yes.
- Do you want your child's mother?

1513
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:26,310
- Yes! - Do you want your brother?
- Yes, yes. - Then, beg!

1514
02:10:27,270 --> 02:10:31,110
Then beg. Beg for forgiveness, and
he will grant you everything.

1515
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:34,350
- Forgiveness?
- Why?

1516
02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:37,320
Are you afraid? God...

1517
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:41,670
please forgive him.
Give him back his child.

1518
02:10:41,910 --> 02:10:44,540
- Please give him his child, God, please...
- God!

1519
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,120
God... God, please forgive me.

1520
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:51,370
I was mistaken. No one can
win against you.

1521
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:55,070
God... I committed
an offence against you.

1522
02:10:56,240 --> 02:11:00,450
I am guilty of offences against
my wife, my child...

1523
02:11:00,550 --> 02:11:02,300
my brother, against
the whole world.

1524
02:11:02,470 --> 02:11:05,710
I cannot face you.

1525
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:08,870
Won't you forgive me?

1526
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:12,980
There's no doubt that
there's nothing good about me.

1527
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,480
And you are without sin.

1528
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:17,860
So if you do not forgive me...

1529
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:20,680
what's the difference
between us?

1530
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:24,090
God, he should find
his son by morning.

1531
02:11:27,930 --> 02:11:30,680
Police... police...

1532
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:40,046
The voices were coming from here.
Where did he disappear so quickly?

1533
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:41,420
Let's look elsewhere.

1534
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,150
- Arre...
- I can't go any further.

1535
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:53,049
I want to quench my thirst...

1536
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,390
but there's no water.

1537
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:58,920
You're thirsty, aren't you?
You want water, right?

1538
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:01,240
I'll get you water right away.

1539
02:12:03,070 --> 02:12:05,660
Jagannath,
there's water close by...

1540
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:07,889
but you don't know
how to quench your thirst.

1541
02:12:08,430 --> 02:12:10,570
I can quench your thirst.

1542
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,170
I can bring you your child.

1543
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:16,490
But the price remains the same.
Two murders.

1544
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:21,006
Roshanlal, rather than be
a murderer in my son's eyes...

1545
02:12:21,030 --> 02:12:23,210
it's better I don't
find my son at all.

1546
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:27,830
I can kill my lifelong hope...

1547
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:31,160
but I can't take a human life!

1548
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:33,000
- I can't!
- You can't?

1549
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:36,070
Then I'll have to commit
a murder, Jagannath.

1550
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:38,830
I regret that it will be yours.

1551
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:47,950
- Tell me, Jagannath, will you do as I say?
- No! No!

1552
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,926
- No!
- You won't?!

1553
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:58,950
[Sounds of fighting,
muffled exclamations]

1554
02:13:09,810 --> 02:13:11,250
- Hey, what're you doing?

1555
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:13,440
- What do you...?
- Thief, thief!

1556
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:15,430
Scoundrel!

1557
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:21,050
You wretch!
How dare you hit a child!

1558
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:28,120
Do as I say or
I'll kill the child.

1559
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:46,620
When he raised
his hand against you...

1560
02:13:47,020 --> 02:13:49,890
I don't know what happened to me.
I couldn't control myself, Raja.

1561
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:51,690
Forgive me, Raja.

1562
02:13:57,860 --> 02:13:59,730
- Roshanlal!
- He shot him!

1563
02:14:03,940 --> 02:14:06,879
Jagan... Nath...

1564
02:14:07,890 --> 02:14:09,610
- Any news, lnspector Saab?
- No.

1565
02:14:09,970 --> 02:14:12,370
- We got a message saying Jagan committed a murder.
- Murder?

1566
02:14:12,510 --> 02:14:14,560
Yes, murder. The Chief lnspector
has ordered...

1567
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:16,566
that all police stations
in the city be alerted...

1568
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:17,980
and all citizens warned.

1569
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:20,270
Okay, driver ready? Come on.

1570
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,360
The criminal Jagannath who has
escaped from prison...

1571
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:36,160
whose photo has been published
in the newpapers...

1572
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:40,050
has just committed a murder.

1573
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:43,490
He is absconding
with an innocent child.

1574
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:45,870
That child's life is in danger.

1575
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,530
The police have requested...

1576
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:02,660
that he be watched for
at every checkpoint, searched for.

1577
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:05,469
The person who
nabs him will be rewarded.

1578
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:16,570
Look over there!

1579
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:38,580
Move! Move out of the way!

1580
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:49,139
Come down, Jagan!

1581
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:54,320
Move! Move!
Out of the way!

1582
02:16:55,410 --> 02:16:58,340
We can go up the stairs.
But all the doors are shut.

1583
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:00,889
- Break the doors and go up!
- Alright!

1584
02:17:02,058 --> 02:17:04,849
- Jagan! Jagan, come back!
- Don't shoot, lnspector Saab.

1585
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:07,039
The child will fall with him.
It's his child!

1586
02:17:07,350 --> 02:17:10,320
- Yes.
- Jagan! Your child has been found!

1587
02:17:10,799 --> 02:17:12,779
- Where's he?
- He is with you!

1588
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:23,179
He doesn't believe you,
lnspector Saab. I'll convince him.

1589
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:25,129
I have sworn I'll
bring back the child.

1590
02:17:25,209 --> 02:17:26,879
Wait! Take some help.

1591
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:29,460
- Take some men with you.
- Then, he will never believe me.

1592
02:17:29,709 --> 02:17:31,309
Let me go alone, lnspector Saab.

1593
02:18:11,638 --> 02:18:12,948
Don't follow me!

1594
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:18,020
Jagan, don't risk the child's life.
Trust me, he is your child.

1595
02:18:18,270 --> 02:18:19,850
You can't cheat me anymore.

1596
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:27,440
Jagan!

1597
02:20:32,190 --> 02:20:33,760
Why are you after me?

1598
02:20:34,810 --> 02:20:37,189
I just want to see
my child once.

1599
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:40,390
Trust me, Jagan,
this child is yours.

1600
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:44,270
Don't try to deceive me.
I am not a murderer anymore!

1601
02:20:44,710 --> 02:20:46,990
I have accepted my defeat
in front of God.

1602
02:20:47,950 --> 02:20:50,960
God, why are your people
following me...

1603
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:52,900
why do they want to kill me?

1604
02:20:53,230 --> 02:20:54,730
Why won't you believe me?

1605
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:58,710
How do I believe that
your son is mine?

1606
02:20:58,890 --> 02:21:01,460
This is my sister's son,
not mine.

1607
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,720
He's your child.

1608
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:07,030
My sister showed me your
photo in the newspaper.

1609
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:09,190
She worshipped you.

1610
02:21:09,570 --> 02:21:11,640
The day she learned that
you are a criminal...

1611
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:15,640
she fled your life, your house,
your world.

1612
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:17,500
She was pregnant then...

1613
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:20,230
and she didn't want you
anywhere near him.

1614
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:22,720
This is the police speaking
through you.

1615
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:25,220
If you need the
reward money again...

1616
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:27,800
then I promise you,
let me find my son.

1617
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:30,839
I'll let you catch me again,
and you can claim the reward.

1618
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:35,789
- Police!
- Jagan!

1619
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:38,710
- Jagan!
- Don't follow me.

1620
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:41,520
I've vowed not to kill...

1621
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:51,330
My dear wife...

1622
02:21:54,220 --> 02:21:56,599
- My dear son's mother!
- Where's my child?

1623
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:59,340
Tell me where he is!
Where is he?

1624
02:22:00,330 --> 02:22:02,600
- Here you are, sister.
- Munna! - Here he is.

1625
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:04,910
Don't worry. Raja is\n absolutely fine.

1626
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:10,260
- Shot? Where have you been shot?
- Ln the arm, brother.

1627
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:15,449
- Brother?
- If I were to die saving one brother from killing the other...

1628
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:19,310
- it would be too small a sacrifice.
- Brother?

1629
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,360
Yes, bhaiyya.

1630
02:22:35,740 --> 02:22:37,980
Bhaiyya! Bhaiyya...

1631
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:39,900
Brother!

1632
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:44,630
- Bhaiyya!
- Bhaiyya...

1633
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:49,360
- Bhaiyya!
- Promise me...

1634
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:52,380
you will never tell my son
that I'm his father.

1635
02:22:53,620 --> 02:22:56,180
Why? Why, bhaiyya, why?

1636
02:22:57,790 --> 02:23:00,710
Once my fate has been decided...

1637
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:03,410
you, members of
the respected jury...

1638
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:05,990
and you, Judge saheb...

1639
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:09,070
and all of you will return...

1640
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:13,116
to your homes, where you will
hug your children to your bosom...

1641
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:14,650
and talk to them lovingly.

1642
02:23:16,010 --> 02:23:17,840
I'm the only
unfortunate person...

1643
02:23:18,830 --> 02:23:21,000
who will go straight
to the gallows.

1644
02:23:22,210 --> 02:23:24,050
And even in my last moments...

1645
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:27,830
I will not be able to
address my child as my own.

1646
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:31,870
I ask you all... tell me...

1647
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:34,830
can there be a greater
punishment than this?

1648
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:42,480
It's okay. I'm a murderer
in the eyes of the world.

1649
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:44,250
I've killed.

1650
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:49,720
But I'm not a murderer
in God's eyes. Or my own.

1651
02:23:51,940 --> 02:23:55,440
I've taken a life to save a life
- of this innocent child...

1652
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:57,790
who transformed an atheist
into a believer,

1653
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:00,040
and a devil into a human being.

1654
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:04,180
Today, you can sentence
one Jagan to the gallows.

1655
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:07,050
Do so. But remember...

1656
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:10,790
as long as orphans are treated
with hatred...

1657
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:15,160
as long as there are no arrangements
for their education and upbringing...

1658
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,960
thousands of lives like mine will
end up on the paths of crime...

1659
02:24:19,350 --> 02:24:20,650
and be destroyed.

1660
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:29,600
If, being a good human being...

1661
02:24:30,370 --> 02:24:32,300
isn't acceptable to my Destiny...

1662
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:35,120
I'm happy...

1663
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:39,960
to sacrifice my life
for the sake of humanity.

1664
02:24:41,410 --> 02:24:43,950
I am glad to sacrifice my life.

1665
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:48,420
I have nothing more to say.

1666
02:24:57,530 --> 02:24:58,730
Accused Jagannath...

1667
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:03,539
the Court and the jury are
sympathetic to your testimony.

1668
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:07,050
Therefore, on the charge
of Roshanlal's murder...

1669
02:25:07,790 --> 02:25:09,200
the Court acquits you.

1670
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:12,939
But on the charge of
breaking out of jail...

1671
02:25:13,430 --> 02:25:16,960
the Court sentences you
to two years in prison...

1672
02:25:17,660 --> 02:25:21,860
that you will serve along with
your remaining five years.

1673
02:25:22,860 --> 02:25:23,970
Sir!

1674
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:45,500
Forgive me, my friend.
I couldn't find your son.

1675
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:50,490
But by the time you come out,
I'll surely find your son.

1676
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:53,650
- Truly, my friend...
- Raja...

1677
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:58,949
- call him 'Baba' [father] once.
- Why?

1678
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:03,599
He didn't find his son,
did he? So, you say it.

1679
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:06,380
Go on, son.

1680
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:10,949
- Baba!
- My child!

1681
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:14,420
- My child!
- Father!

1682
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:25,550
I'm handing you my
dearest possession.

1683
02:26:34,410 --> 02:26:37,850
Please forgive me.
I've troubled you a lot.

1684
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:42,280
Right now, I can give you nothing
but my blessings.
