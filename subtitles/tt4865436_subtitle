1
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:14,198
Shall we, Siya?

2
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,102
I am scared.

3
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:20,004
Siya, I'm sure
you'll be just fine.

4
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,634
I am with you, too.

5
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,968
Sir, everyone's waiting for you.

6
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:39,978
Shall we?

7
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:53,446
Hi.
- Hello.

8
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:54,726
Hello.
- Hello.

9
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:56,143
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:56,273 --> 00:01:57,509
Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,743
Two years ago

12
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:28,773
I didn't just lose my elder
brother in the plane crash

13
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:34,088
in fact, I also lost
my best friend, my idol.

14
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:37,207
Few are fortunate to have
a brother like Vikram Diwan.

15
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,158
I'm sure you must be thinking

16
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,196
why I built this hospital
in his memory

17
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,953
although I am
a successful hotelier.

18
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:48,275
I'd like to tell
all of you a story.

19
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:51,365
I was 8 and Vikram was 13.

20
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,435
He had a friend named Karan.

21
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:56,583
Vikram would spend all time
with him and play with him.

22
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,193
One day, when I
returned from school

23
00:02:58,323 --> 00:02:59,552
Vikram wasn't eating

24
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:01,273
because Karan didn't
come home that day.

25
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,380
Later, we found out that
he was in the hospital.

26
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,490
He had a problem with his liver.

27
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:09,031
And there was just
one way to save him.

28
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,670
And that was to find a donor

29
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,938
whose blood group
matched with him.

30
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,959
Vikram and Karan had
the same blood group.

31
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,110
Vikram didn't even
hesitate once

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,310
before he decided to donate
half of his liver

33
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,269
to save his friend.

34
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:29,645
Since that day,
Vikram became my role model.

35
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:34,427
He went to great lengths
in order to help the needy.

36
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,267
And so, every needy person

37
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:40,392
will receive free help at
Vikram Diwan Memorial Hospital.

38
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,714
This is the first time
when I feel

39
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:55,833
I've managed to become
somewhat like him.

40
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,632
The News India crew is waiting.
- Yeah.

41
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,773
Ma'am,
the News India crew

42
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:04,990
is ready for the one-on-one
interview with you.

43
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:08,501
Is it necessary?

44
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,099
No need to worry.

45
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:13,389
Just be honest.

46
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:16,603
Yes.

47
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:21,457
Hello, this is Priya Verma
from News India.

48
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,419
On today's special program

49
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:26,566
we'll talk about
women's empowerment.

50
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,297
We are reporting live

51
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:31,615
from Vikram Diwan Memorial
Super-Specialty Hospital

52
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:34,954
that was inaugurated
moments ago.

53
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,714
Our special guest for the day
is the woman

54
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:44,329
that helped Aditya Diwan
in fulfilling his dreams.

55
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,104
Mrs. Siya Diwan.

56
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:48,012
First of all,
hearty congratulations

57
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,053
on the inauguration
of this hospital.

58
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:51,290
Thank you.

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,732
They say behind every
successful man is a woman.

60
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,728
So are you the woman
behind Aditya Diwan's success?

61
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,981
I don't think so!

62
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,792
I don't think a woman
ever stays in shadows.

63
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:11,529
So I would rather say

64
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,528
that I am the woman
who has always been

65
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,819
besides
the successful Aditya Diwan

66
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:17,542
and not behind him.

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,526
Mrs. Diwan, one of the
responsibilities of the press

68
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,184
is to destroy rumors.

69
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:29,005
We heard that prior
to your marriage

70
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:33,329
you had an affair with
Aditya's elder brother Vikram.

71
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,535
Is this true or not?

72
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:43,254
Yes, it's true.

73
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,412
And it's not a rumor.

74
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:47,442
When Vikram died

75
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,730
I was pregnant with his child.

76
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:52,696
But we weren't married yet.

77
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:55,440
And Aditya didn't
want Vikram's child

78
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,889
to stay devoid
of his family name.

79
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,713
That's why he married me.

80
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,081
But after sometime
I suffered a miscarriage.

81
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:11,750
And I lost my baby, too.

82
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,877
Maybe God didn't want me

83
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:20,108
to keep any memento
from my past.

84
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,034
But God made sure

85
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,750
that a nice man like
Aditya becomes my companion

86
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:32,077
so that I can move on in life.

87
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:13,846
"I'm obsessed
to make you mine."

88
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,666
"Since long."

89
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:24,524
"Make me a bad habit"

90
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:29,900
"is what I have to say to you."

91
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:56,843
"Let a wave of sensation
run down"

92
00:07:57,188 --> 00:08:00,928
"my otherwise calm body."

93
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:04,976
"Let me stare into those"

94
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:12,095
"mesmerizing eyes
that are as deep as an abyss."

95
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:17,613
"Let's get wet in
the deluge of desires."

96
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:20,878
"Come.."

97
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:30,821
"I'm obsessed with
never letting you go ever."

98
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:33,516
"Since long."

99
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:41,618
"Let me dwell in your eyes"

100
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:46,932
"is what I have to say to you."

101
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:13,430
"Don't stop me."

102
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,323
"I am completely obsessed now."

103
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:20,842
"That's how crazy I am."

104
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,321
"Take a look at me."

105
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,961
"I'm suffering too."

106
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:31,246
"I'm completely
shattered to pieces."

107
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:34,080
"There's no turning back now."

108
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,160
"Whatever this is,
it feels right."

109
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,356
"Come.."

110
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:50,111
"I'm obsessed with
becoming one with you."

111
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:53,097
"Since long."

112
00:09:54,195 --> 00:10:00,853
"Let me stay close to you"

113
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,276
"is what I have to say to you."

114
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:16,714
"I'm obsessed
to make you mine."

115
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:19,511
"Since long."

116
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:24,915
"I'm obsessed
since long."

117
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,746
The Hong Kong delegates are
on their way from the airport.

118
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,060
And they'll be here
in 15 minutes.

119
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,381
Thank you, sir.

120
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,144
Kaaya, I want you
to head this meeting.

121
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:05,123
Aditya, this deal is worth
5 billion.

122
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,982
And if anything goes wrong

123
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:11,022
our company will never
be able to bear the loss.

124
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:14,670
And I think
I'm not yet capable.

125
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,589
Kaaya, I know you're more
capable than you think you are.

126
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,179
Two years ago, you joined
this company as a secretary.

127
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,750
And now you're perfectly
handling all my big companies.

128
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,779
And let's not forget

129
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:30,577
you did splendid job with
our soft drink department

130
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:33,626
which has increased
our sales by seven fold.

131
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,626
So now go ahead
and head the meeting.

132
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:38,387
All the best.

133
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,856
I don't know
how to thank you, but..

134
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,067
Thank you.

135
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,505
I can't believe my eyes.

136
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,615
What did you possibly see,
Mr. Vaswani?

137
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,533
It's hard to believe
that a random person

138
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,015
can gift you
something so expensive.

139
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,384
What gift? Show me.

140
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:57,703
Sir, it's as big as
it's expensive.

141
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,693
What?

142
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:01,536
I mean, you must come down
to see it for yourself.

143
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:31,494
Who is it, sir?

144
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,262
Find out.

145
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:41,685
Saurav Singhania.

146
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,574
Never heard of him before.

147
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:46,003
What does he do?

148
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,163
Vaswani was saying

149
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:50,082
he's the owner of some
group of international funds.

150
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:52,413
And also owns a few
iron and steel factories.

151
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:54,763
Impressive.

152
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,762
And the reason for this favor.

153
00:12:56,893 --> 00:13:00,161
I've accepted his lunch
invitation to find that out.

154
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,770
Lunch invitation?

155
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,265
He has invited us both
at his office.

156
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,893
You'll come along, right?
- No.

157
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:09,519
Why?

158
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,720
What will I do out there?

159
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,879
And anyway, these business
meetings are very boring.

160
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,119
I see.

161
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,478
Are you trying to tell me
you don't want to meet a person

162
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:21,460
who gifts an Audi
to someone he doesn't know.

163
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:25,133
I would..

164
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:28,047
By the way, is he handsome?

165
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,888
Handsome is as handsome does.

166
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,363
Welcome!

167
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:17,260
Welcome to my kingdom!

168
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,864
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

169
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:39,379
Thank you for inviting us.

170
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:41,404
Pleasure is all mine.

171
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:43,982
This is Mr. Dixit.

172
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,967
He looks after
my entire business.

173
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,826
You must be wondering why I was
so eager to meet you two.

174
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,571
Well, I have something
to show you.

175
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:28,372
I guess even we don't know
this much about ourselves.

176
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:33,061
May I ask why you're
so interested in our lives?

177
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:36,335
You can say that
I'm a big fan of yours.

178
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:39,640
Only film stars and cricketers

179
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,905
have fans in this country,
Mr. Singhania.

180
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:45,166
This is the first time
when I heard

181
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,246
that even businessmen have fans.

182
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:49,941
Well, actually
I'm a fan of every person

183
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:53,156
who achieved something
in life on their own.

184
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:58,567
You expanded your business
so rapidly

185
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:00,929
after losing your father
and elder brother.

186
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:02,179
It's remarkable.

187
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,727
You have really
great business sense.

188
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,097
We were supposed
to talk business.

189
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:10,955
Yes.

190
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:13,814
Is it okay if I borrow
your husband for a minute?

191
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:15,115
Sure.

192
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:19,221
Mr. Dixit, show
Mrs. Siya around the office.

193
00:16:22,421 --> 00:16:23,294
Please.

194
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:24,826
Let's have a drink.

195
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:27,693
Scotch. Vodka. Bourbon.

196
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:30,306
Malt.
- Excellent.

197
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,140
Do you know the difference
between birds and humans?

198
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:42,160
Birds build a nest

199
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:45,598
just big enough for them.

200
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:49,529
And humans..

201
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:53,272
Well, humans are never
happy with their home.

202
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,112
They want to make it bigger.

203
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,365
Like I am sure

204
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,242
you want to expand
your business as well.

205
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:07,602
And I want to help you
fulfill this dream.

206
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:11,236
I'll give you all
the money you need.

207
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:15,148
Diwan is a big name

208
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:18,516
and every bank and financial
institution lineup at my door

209
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,843
to lend us money.

210
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:24,320
Cheers.

211
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,602
See that's true.

212
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,272
But for the money you borrow

213
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:32,940
you'll have to mortgage
your property and pay interest.

214
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,791
Every creditor does that.

215
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:38,280
But not me.

216
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,629
With me, there's no guarantee.

217
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,515
No mortgage. No interest.

218
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,749
Are you out of your mind?

219
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:49,170
You'll lend me money without
any guarantee or interest?

220
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:51,596
And whatever amount you want.

221
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,196
But why will you do it?

222
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,027
Why just you?

223
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,946
Why would anyone
do such a thing?

224
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:03,266
I don't know about the rest
but I am a businessman.

225
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:05,204
And this is a business deal.

226
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,065
What deal?

227
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:11,139
This is a signed check.

228
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:14,034
You can fill in whatever
amount you like.

229
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,461
Just send Siya over
for one night.

230
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:19,879
You rascal!

231
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:22,350
I will kill you.

232
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,031
How dare you!

233
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:32,029
No one has dared to mention Siya
in front of me.

234
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,618
Don't make this mistake again

235
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:37,549
or else next time,
you won't get time to regret.

236
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,683
You're new to this city.

237
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:42,363
Take my advice and leave.

238
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,386
As long as
Aditya Diwan is here

239
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:50,638
you can't even breathe
let alone do your business.

240
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:55,970
We shall see.

241
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,341
We shall.

242
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,225
Siya, let's go.

243
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,640
What's wrong?
- Nothing. Let's just go.

244
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:12,939
Aditya, what happened?

245
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:30,735
The game's begun.

246
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:59,631
Couldn't you see before
opening the door?

247
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,437
This isn't obstruction

248
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,141
it's a door
to a better future, Satya.

249
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:12,972
How do you know my name?

250
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:16,203
Your brother Raghunath Kamath
is in jail, isn't he?

251
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,812
Yes, but how do you know?
- Never mind.

252
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,517
Look,
your brother's bail papers.

253
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,395
You must do something for me

254
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:33,912
if you want to
see your brother free.

255
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:36,146
What is it?

256
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,393
More.
- Yeah.

257
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:49,195
Go ahead, I'll join you later.

258
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:50,433
What's wrong?

259
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:51,954
Aren't you coming
along for lunch?

260
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,113
No, Mr. Akash asked me
to do something.

261
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:58,233
I'll go deal with that first.
Go ahead, I'm coming.

262
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:01,216
I'll go. Don't be late.
- Yes.

263
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:30,896
You gave 21 runs
in an over.

264
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:33,038
But you were
clean bowled by me. - Shut up.

265
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:39,704
Harshit.
- Harshit.

266
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,265
Harshit.
- What happened?

267
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,135
Harshit. Harshit.
- What happened?

268
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:45,034
Harshit. What's wrong?
- Tell us.

269
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:47,023
Yes, sir. Right, sir.

270
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:48,582
Okay, that will be done, sir.

271
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:49,702
Thank you, sir.

272
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,702
Right. - Aditya!
Something's definitely wrong.

273
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:55,102
We're receiving many complaints
regarding our soft drinks.

274
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,143
What complaints?

275
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,182
Some kids started puking
after drinking our soft-drinks

276
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,300
and some fell sick.

277
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:01,061
And our sources in the
secretariat have informed us

278
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:02,620
that there's going
to be an inquiry.

279
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,910
And I just don't understand
how is that possible!

280
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:09,977
Aditya Diwan.
- Down! Down!

281
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,607
Aditya Diwan.
- Down! Down!

282
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:13,539
Aditya Diwan.
- Down! Down!

283
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,098
Please stay back. Please.

284
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,850
Please stay back.
- Down with Aditya Diwan.

285
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,077
I said stay back.
- Down with Aditya Diwan.

286
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:27,104
Stay back. Move back.

287
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:31,730
Move. Move.
Stay back.

288
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,660
Stay back. Move.

289
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:36,255
Stop making this poison!

290
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:38,177
Shut it down!

291
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,014
Stop making this poison!

292
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:41,733
Shut it down!

293
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,493
Stop making this poison!

294
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:45,698
Shut it down!

295
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:47,421
Mr. Aditya Diwan

296
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,733
we must take the latest
batch of your soft drinks

297
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:51,691
to our Lab for testing.

298
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,570
And you must shut down
your factory

299
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:55,612
until we don't get the results.

300
00:22:56,748 --> 00:22:58,725
Shut it down!

301
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,517
Shut it down!

302
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:03,575
Okay, inspector.

303
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,131
Even I don't want anyone falling
sick after drinking this.

304
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:10,042
I am ready to cooperate.
- Thank you.

305
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:12,011
Officer.

306
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:15,856
Down with Aditya Diwan!

307
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:19,086
'These people only know
how to make profit.'

308
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:20,847
'They would even sell poison
if they profited from it.'

309
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:21,887
'They are selling us poison.'

310
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:23,696
'Such people should be hanged.'

311
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:27,370
'As you can see
the huge crowd'

312
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:30,693
'gathered behind us
and they're clearly furious.'

313
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:33,114
'Police have sent
the latest batch for testing..'

314
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:45,890
Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Siya.

315
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:47,620
Who is this?

316
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:50,230
What? You forgot me so soon?

317
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,760
Saurav Singhania.

318
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:54,599
Yes.

319
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,318
How did you like my second gift?

320
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:58,519
Gift? What gift?

321
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:02,013
Oh, so Aditya didn't
tell you anything.

322
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:03,878
About what?

323
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,717
The thing that can
solve all your problems.

324
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:10,690
Hatred can turn into love if..

325
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:14,485
Only if you want..

326
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:16,747
What do you mean?

327
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:20,047
Actually, you should
ask your husband.

328
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:24,439
He'll tell you.

329
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,599
You were all over
the news today.

330
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,318
You must be really worried.

331
00:24:57,478 --> 00:24:58,585
Part of the job.

332
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:02,764
Keeping things from me must
also be part of your job, right?

333
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:06,596
What? What did
I hide from you?

334
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:10,410
You never told me
what happened between

335
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,915
Saurav Singhania and you
that day?

336
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:16,106
He's crazy.
Stop thinking about him.

337
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:17,961
He's done all this!

338
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:21,303
What?

339
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:23,542
Everything that's happening
in our soft-drink factory.

340
00:25:23,673 --> 00:25:26,304
It's a sabotage.
He's behind it all.

341
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:29,301
Who told you?
- He told me.

342
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:31,063
He called.
- What did he say?

343
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:34,152
That you know why he's
making our lives miserable.

344
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:37,780
And only I can make it
all go away.

345
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:39,971
Siya, just forget it.

346
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:41,779
Why?

347
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,789
What does he want?

348
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,719
Why don't you tell me?
- I can't tell you.

349
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,960
Aditya, please! Tell me.

350
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:04,873
He wants to

351
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:07,984
spend a night with you.

352
00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:14,113
That's what that crook wants.

353
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:17,788
And that's why he's..

354
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:19,942
Siya..

355
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:23,182
He's a vulgar rascal
with a lot of money.

356
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:28,253
No Aditya,
that can't be the only reason.

357
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,062
I am sure there's
something more to it.

358
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:38,849
Maybe he's saying all this
to provoke you, confuse you

359
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,381
and hiding his true motive.

360
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:43,578
Find out, Aditya.

361
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:45,615
Find out!

362
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,621
"Never last, never last,
can you come on top?"

363
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,997
"Never last, never last.."

364
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:50,270
"Check this out."

365
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,722
"When I don't get
the liberty"

366
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:06,399
"to touch you."

367
00:27:08,518 --> 00:27:12,884
When I don't get
the liberty to touch you."

368
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:17,253
"I get that liberty
in my dreams."

369
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:21,651
"But even in my dreams
when I try to touch you."

370
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,941
"I wake up."

371
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:37,757
"Aren't you ashamed of
talking dirty like this?"

372
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:42,049
"Don't your mom and your
sister teach you anything?"

373
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:45,981
"My reputation isn't tarnished,
thank the Lord"

374
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:49,206
"that you wake up."

375
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:53,607
"Meet Bros."

376
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,199
"Meet Bros."

377
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:04,232
"Let me touch your body
and it'll change your gait."

378
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:06,433
"Touch my lips with yours"

379
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,712
"and it'll melt your heart."

380
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:13,152
"Ignore these shenanigans
and fill my arms."

381
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:17,750
"Forget all your worries,
and let's enjoy life."

382
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:22,870
"I can understand
your naughty behavior."

383
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:27,247
"Don't your mom and your
sister teach you anything?"

384
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:31,122
"My reputation isn't tarnished,
thank the Lord"

385
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,936
"that you wake up."

386
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,343
"Your kiss is really killer."

387
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,663
"I hope it doesn't
turn into a love-bite."

388
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,902
"I am scared of
your intentions."

389
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,462
"You might turn
my days into nights."

390
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:07,501
"Stop flirting"

391
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:09,797
"why are you after me?"

392
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:14,180
"I know how to cure
your fever of love."

393
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:19,347
"Why do you make promises
and break it every day."

394
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:23,860
"And come in my dreams
to lure my heart again."

395
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:28,098
"But even in my dreams
when I try to touch you."

396
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,629
"I wake up."

397
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,760
This soft-drink incident

398
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:56,822
has ruined the image
of our other companies.

399
00:29:57,982 --> 00:29:59,771
Not only did we have
to stop production

400
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:03,340
in fact, we had to call back
the stock in the market as well.

401
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,589
There must be a way.

402
00:30:08,689 --> 00:30:09,740
There is one.

403
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:11,859
What's that?

404
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:14,299
Vaswani.

405
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:28,878
Aditya.
- Look, Kaaya.

406
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:32,794
I want you to resign
and take the blame.

407
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:33,926
This is the only way

408
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:36,004
to save our companies
from total annihilation.

409
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,965
You know I am innocent.
I didn't do anything.

410
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:40,258
I know.

411
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:45,392
But someone other than me will
have to take responsibility.

412
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,048
I can't trust anyone else.

413
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,642
The company will
take good care of you.

414
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:52,134
You will keep
getting your salary.

415
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:53,692
In fact for lifetime.

416
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,481
And the law can't touch you.

417
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:57,321
We'll get the best team
for your case.

418
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,245
And what if I don't agree?

419
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,616
Sorry, you have no choice.

420
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:04,238
The company has already
released a press statement

421
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:07,245
stating that you're responsible
for everything.

422
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,815
You know what, Aditya?
You're a real crook.

423
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:23,246
And I don't need
your fake sympathy.

424
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:27,315
And yes, keep the salary
for yourself.

425
00:31:27,445 --> 00:31:29,005
You might need it.

426
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:51,672
Stop. Stop.

427
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:53,431
Ms. Kaaya,
did you already know

428
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:55,391
that the cold drink
wasn't fit for drinking?

429
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,839
Ma'am, please tell us..
- They still haven't recovered..

430
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,880
Aditya has foiled your plans by
blaming Kaaya for everything.

431
00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:08,817
This is the just the beginning.

432
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:13,236
How long can he hide
behind innocent women?

433
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:18,557
We have to go to Malaysia for
the Business Chamber Summit.

434
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,039
I think we should leave.

435
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:27,889
This girl, Kaaya.

436
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:31,003
Call her, I want to
talk business with her.

437
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,377
Welcome.

438
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:08,546
Thank you.

439
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,860
I am Dixit.
- Hi.

440
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,454
I hope you had
a pleasant journey.

441
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:16,763
Everything was fine.

442
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:18,504
Please come.
- Thank you.

443
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:23,688
Please come.
I'll show you your room.

444
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:30,103
Please come.

445
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:32,573
Mr. Singhania is really happy

446
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:34,815
that you accepted
his invitation.

447
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,652
But he's also apologized.

448
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:41,010
He couldn't receive
you personally

449
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,370
because he was
busy in his meetings.

450
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,015
It's okay, I can understand.

451
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,272
Mr. Singhania would like you
to have dinner with him tonight.

452
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,947
Of course.
- Thank you.

453
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,043
Cheers.
- Cheers.

454
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,246
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

455
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:04,067
Thank you for this
beautiful evening.

456
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:09,297
I believe if you put
your heart into something

457
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:12,403
the result is always beautiful.

458
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:14,579
True.

459
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,034
I want to offer you something.

460
00:34:19,564 --> 00:34:20,808
From my heart..

461
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:24,923
Friendship.

462
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:27,132
I don't make friends
that quickly.

463
00:34:27,772 --> 00:34:30,546
And anyway, you're not
interested in my friendship.

464
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,320
What do you mean?

465
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,638
Just that I know
you want to use me

466
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:40,462
to ruin Aditya Diwan.

467
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:45,488
After all, the enemy
of my enemy is a friend.

468
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,008
Wow.

469
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:53,238
Beauty and brains.

470
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,499
You must be very dangerous.

471
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,565
Not as dangerous as you.

472
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,133
But my brains tell me

473
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:04,083
that you're ready to
pay any price for this.

474
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:09,044
But Mr. Singhania,
I am not for sale.

475
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:13,044
Who are you still
being loyal to, Kaaya?

476
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,034
Someone who humiliated you

477
00:35:16,163 --> 00:35:18,170
and have you thrown out
of his company.

478
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,523
I don't think about profit
and loss while making friends.

479
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,094
What's done is done.

480
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:26,852
Anyway, what's the offer?

481
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,557
Double of whatever
Aditya's giving you.

482
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,469
Not interested.

483
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,658
Four times more.
- Not interested!

484
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:39,736
Any figure you want, tell me.

485
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,696
No.

486
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:48,146
You wouldn't have come here

487
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:49,877
if you weren't
interested in my offer.

488
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:51,827
And it's impossible

489
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:54,180
that you're uninterested
in my offer after coming here.

490
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:58,589
That only means that
I am asking the wrong question.

491
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:05,290
The right question is
what do you want?

492
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:13,767
I have a morning flight.

493
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:16,781
And you have until
tomorrow morning

494
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:19,776
to figure out
what I want.

495
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:21,728
Good night.

496
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:45,296
I hope you liked
our hospitality.

497
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:47,017
It was better than I expected.

498
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:48,506
Thank you.
- Yes.

499
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,569
I wanted you to be
my guest a little longer.

500
00:36:56,944 --> 00:36:58,466
But you were right.

501
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,623
No one can put a price tag
on our friendship.

502
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:03,974
It's alright.

503
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:05,622
Thank you
for the wonderful stay.

504
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:08,284
Aditya killed my sister.

505
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,189
Our parents died in a car crash
when we were young.

506
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:28,939
Since then I raised
Sangeeta as my daughter.

507
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:33,943
She met Aditya in college.

508
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:36,487
And they became friends.

509
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:38,918
Soon their friendship
blossomed into love.

510
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,937
Aditya meant everything
to Sangeeta.

511
00:37:45,468 --> 00:37:46,655
But he..

512
00:37:50,412 --> 00:37:52,297
He just used her like a slave.

513
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:59,488
Sangeeta couldn't tolerate this

514
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,696
and she killed herself
by consuming poison.

515
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:08,159
I still remember the night

516
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,751
when I rushed to her room.

517
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:16,669
My sister died

518
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,624
right in my arms.

519
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:27,860
That day I decided.

520
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:32,246
That no matter what

521
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:36,134
I will destroy Aditya Diwan.

522
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:58,311
If you know the price
of my friendship

523
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:01,321
you should know
I can even die for you.

524
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,915
This hard disk has
all the information

525
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:11,599
about Aditya's business.

526
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,478
It will help you to destroy him.

527
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:25,346
Thank you.

528
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:33,909
And yes,
my motive behind coming here

529
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,474
was to know the reason
behind your silence.

530
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:38,785
And now this reason

531
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:43,893
has compelled me
to know you better.

532
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:51,463
"Give me.
Give me, give me love."

533
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:52,632
"Then give me more."

534
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:55,312
"Take some love from me too."

535
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:57,936
"My lover gave you down
and I feeling low."

536
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,941
"Again and again and again."

537
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:03,899
"What's danger,
what danger, what danger."

538
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,218
"Take me down, down, down."

539
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:09,220
"What's danger,
what danger, what danger."

540
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,972
"Take me down, down, down."

541
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,513
"Take me down, down, down."

542
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:21,256
"Take me down, down, down."

543
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,610
"Show me that you can love."

544
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,234
"O Baby, take me in your arms."

545
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:29,114
"Everything I ever
imagined in my dreams."

546
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:31,915
"O baby, just do all that."

547
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,843
"Show me that you can love."

548
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,838
"O Baby, take me in your arms."

549
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,712
"Everything I ever
imagined in my dreams."

550
00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:42,712
"O baby, just do all that."

551
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:45,322
"You're my love."

552
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:47,912
"You're my intoxication
of nights."

553
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,603
"You're my love."

554
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:53,264
"Arouse my body in slumber."

555
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:55,902
"You're my love."

556
00:40:56,032 --> 00:40:58,600
"You're my intoxication
of nights."

557
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:01,228
"You're my love."

558
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,911
"Arouse my sleeping body."

559
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:16,786
"That's reason that
I cannot love no other."

560
00:41:16,915 --> 00:41:17,466
"My love."

561
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:19,381
"This life I'm gonna
live it longer."

562
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:20,027
"My love."

563
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:22,070
"Under your spell, girl.
I'm down under."

564
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:22,705
"My love."

565
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:25,345
"I keep coming back
for more and more and more."

566
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:27,303
"That's reason that
I cannot love no other."

567
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:28,064
"My love."

568
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,000
"This life I'm gonna
live it longer."

569
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:30,703
"My love."

570
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,662
"Under your spell, girl.
I'm down under."

571
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:33,302
"My love."

572
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:35,769
"I keep coming back
for more and more and more."

573
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:43,076
"Your crazy eyes touched me
in this dark night."

574
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:48,103
"Something happened
to me and my breath."

575
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:53,473
"Your crazy eyes touched me
in this dark night."

576
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:58,884
"Something sizzled
down my lazy breath."

577
00:41:59,514 --> 00:42:02,105
"You're my love."

578
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,738
"You're my intoxication
of nights."

579
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:07,417
"You're my love."

580
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,758
"Arouse my body in slumber."

581
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:12,712
"You're my love."

582
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:14,821
"You're my intoxication
of nights."

583
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,999
"You're my love."

584
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:20,384
"Arouse my body in slumber."

585
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:46,318
"This winter feels so hot."

586
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,108
"There's no shame anywhere."

587
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:54,348
"Sweetheart, we've made
a legitimate mistake."

588
00:42:54,477 --> 00:42:57,027
"This winter feels so hot."

589
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,626
"There's no shame anywhere."

590
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:05,120
"Sweetheart, we've made
a legitimate mistake."

591
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:08,666
"Let me make things
hot for you."

592
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:11,234
"Bring my lips close to yours."

593
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,318
"Everything I ever
imagined in my dreams."

594
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:16,194
"Just do all that."

595
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:18,904
"You're my love."

596
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:21,239
"You're my intoxication
of nights."

597
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:24,182
"You're my love."

598
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:26,511
"Arouse my body in slumber."

599
00:43:26,942 --> 00:43:29,460
"You're my love."

600
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:32,101
"You're my intoxication
of nights."

601
00:43:32,231 --> 00:43:34,741
"You're my love."

602
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,429
"Arouse my body in slumber."

603
00:43:40,149 --> 00:43:42,758
"You're my intoxication
of nights."

604
00:43:45,428 --> 00:43:47,642
"Arouse my body in slumber."

605
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:48,313
Hello.
- Hello.

606
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:50,927
Yeah, Kaaya, tell me.
Aditya's having his breakfast.

607
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:53,311
Okay, put me on speaker.
I don't have time. Quick.

608
00:44:56,682 --> 00:44:57,598
Yeah, Kaaya. Go ahead.

609
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,764
Aditya, the information
I gave Saurav

610
00:44:59,895 --> 00:45:02,404
won't harm us in any way.
- Good.

611
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,923
But I found out
something very important.

612
00:45:05,053 --> 00:45:06,123
What's that?

613
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:08,042
Do you know a girl
called Sangeeta

614
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,074
who went to the
same college as you?

615
00:45:11,132 --> 00:45:12,602
Yes, I remember.

616
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:13,963
There was a girl. Yes.

617
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:16,802
And you two loved each other.

618
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,370
What nonsense!
She loved me, but not me.

619
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,531
She was a mad girl, you know.
Obsessive.

620
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,500
She committed suicide.
She gave up her life for you.

621
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,038
What?

622
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,058
I don't know
anything about this.

623
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:32,488
Yes. And Saurav Singhania
is Sangeeta's brother.

624
00:45:32,618 --> 00:45:34,007
What?
- Yes.

625
00:45:34,137 --> 00:45:35,447
And he wants to ruin you

626
00:45:35,577 --> 00:45:37,657
in order to avenge
his sister's death.

627
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:40,657
Now it all makes sense to me.

628
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:43,446
Don't forget to
clone Saurav's phone.

629
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:45,500
And keep informing me.
- Okay.

630
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:50,895
You were right, Siya.

631
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,133
This a revenge story.

632
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:55,843
He's not just a
rich vulgar rascal.

633
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:58,004
But a rich vulgar
cunning rascal.

634
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,684
But Aditya, if all this
is just a misunderstanding

635
00:46:00,814 --> 00:46:02,083
then why don't you
just clear it out?

636
00:46:02,212 --> 00:46:04,050
But that won't make
a difference, Siya.

637
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:06,121
If we want to stop Saurav

638
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:08,691
then we'll have to
play this game his way.

639
00:46:09,552 --> 00:46:10,679
What?

640
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,223
Persuasion. Bribe.
Punishment and divide.

641
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,410
Vaswani.
- Yes, sir.

642
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:20,839
There was a girl called Sangeeta

643
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,684
who studied in my
college with me. - Yes.

644
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,047
I want her brother's
entire life history.

645
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:26,349
Okay, sir.

646
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,388
If he knows everything about us

647
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,608
then we must also know
everything about him.

648
00:47:40,878 --> 00:47:44,249
Do you have to go?
- I don't want to either.

649
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,680
But I haven't met mom
for a long time now.

650
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:48,248
She's missing me.

651
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:51,795
I've lost my heart to you.

652
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:54,706
I can't bear you going away.

653
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:58,488
Promise me,
you'll come back soon.

654
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:01,487
Promise me.

655
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,032
I promise.

656
00:48:05,908 --> 00:48:09,450
It's time for my flight
and your meeting.

657
00:48:10,506 --> 00:48:11,570
Shall we?

658
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:25,321
Saurav has entrapped Kaaya.

659
00:48:26,384 --> 00:48:28,601
We're getting the information
we want.

660
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:30,660
The plan is working.

661
00:48:50,435 --> 00:48:51,236
I got the phone.

662
00:48:51,366 --> 00:48:52,840
Now listen to me very carefully.

663
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:56,609
First, remove SIM card
from Saurav's phone.

664
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,172
Done.

665
00:49:00,755 --> 00:49:03,475
Next attach the SIM card
to the SIM reader.

666
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:06,076
Just like we attach the SIM
card in the mobile phone.

667
00:49:06,435 --> 00:49:07,393
Done.

668
00:49:09,837 --> 00:49:12,744
Now attach the SIM reader
to the adapter.

669
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:15,197
And attach the adapter
to your phone.

670
00:49:15,473 --> 00:49:16,342
As soon as you do that

671
00:49:16,473 --> 00:49:18,421
you'll see a pop-up
window on your phone.

672
00:49:18,552 --> 00:49:20,501
It's giving me an option,
'Yes or No'.

673
00:49:20,632 --> 00:49:25,181
Press 'Yes' and wait 10 seconds
for the process to complete.

674
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,412
As soon as the process
completes, press Ok.

675
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:32,432
I hope she does it.

676
00:49:34,668 --> 00:49:35,790
Come on!

677
00:49:59,302 --> 00:50:00,775
Yes, Mr. Singhania,
how can I be at service?

678
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:01,894
Fool.

679
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:02,855
I've told you a thousand times

680
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:05,094
whenever we speak on phone,
we won't say each other's name.

681
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:07,156
Sorry, sir.
- Now listen to me carefully.

682
00:50:07,286 --> 00:50:09,160
According to your source

683
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:10,575
Aditya's company has
invested a lot of money

684
00:50:10,704 --> 00:50:12,301
in the Telecommunication's Bill

685
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:15,212
which will soon be passed
by the Parliament.

686
00:50:15,342 --> 00:50:18,531
And if this is okayed, Aditya's
company will make a fortune.

687
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,050
Right?
- Yes, the information is right.

688
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,010
And if the Bill
is rejected then..

689
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,210
His company will
incur huge losses

690
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,970
and will have to be shut down.
- Of course.

691
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:26,730
Exactly.

692
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,049
So this Bill should
get rejected.

693
00:50:29,178 --> 00:50:30,785
But sir, what will
you gain from all this?

694
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:32,938
You can say

695
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:36,167
that I stand to gain
from Aditya's losses.

696
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:37,407
I get it, sir.

697
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:40,287
Don't worry. This Bill
will never get through.

698
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:42,880
How does he know all this?

699
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:46,588
Everyone's got money to bribe.

700
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:50,855
Aditya, what will you do now?

701
00:50:57,412 --> 00:50:58,382
Aditya Diwan speaking.

702
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:02,849
Mr. Aditya, don't embarrass me
by saying your name.

703
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:05,322
Do you remember your promise?
- Of course I do.

704
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:06,723
Don't worry.

705
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:09,370
I've the biggest number of MPs.

706
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,841
The Bill will be approved
by tomorrow morning.

707
00:51:11,971 --> 00:51:15,676
That's fine,
buy 10 more MPs.

708
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:20,000
There's no need for that.

709
00:51:20,129 --> 00:51:22,613
I know, but I still don't
want to take a chance.

710
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:24,277
I'm sending over more money.

711
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:26,489
Fine, as you wish.

712
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:31,622
Let's see what Saurav Singhania
does now?

713
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:43,904
Hello.

714
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:45,443
Kaaya.

715
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,596
We need to deliver
500 million

716
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:49,599
to telecommunication
Minister Dutta's home.

717
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:52,112
Give this job to
someone trustworthy.

718
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,578
Don't worry.

719
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,237
I've confirmed from my sources.

720
00:52:03,949 --> 00:52:06,975
That Bill will
never get approval.

721
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:12,631
And as for the plan ahead

722
00:52:14,118 --> 00:52:15,468
it's already begun.

723
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,626
You know what to do.
Just be careful.

724
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:39,265
Don't worry, ma'am.
I've done this before.

725
00:52:39,395 --> 00:52:41,864
And yes, switch off
your phone for safety.

726
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:43,216
So that no one can track you.

727
00:52:43,345 --> 00:52:44,592
Yes, madam.
- Leave.

728
00:52:55,231 --> 00:52:58,502
Sir, we've made a big mistake.
- What's wrong?

729
00:52:58,816 --> 00:53:01,112
Saurav Singhania is
not Sangeeta's brother.

730
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,620
What?
- Yes, sir.

731
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,698
Her brother passed away five
years ago in a car accident.

732
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,939
He lied to Kaaya
to mislead her.

733
00:53:10,068 --> 00:53:11,179
And we were celebrating

734
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:13,465
that we'll get all the
information through Kaaya.

735
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:18,585
This means, he already knew
that we sent Kaaya.

736
00:53:19,267 --> 00:53:20,242
Yes.

737
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:21,863
Oh my God!

738
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:25,496
Vaswani, we must stop the money
we sent to Dutta at any cost!

739
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:26,656
Yes, sir.

740
00:53:32,857 --> 00:53:35,215
Hello.
- I was about to call you.

741
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,200
The money's on the way.

742
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:39,464
Stop it at all cost.
- What?

743
00:53:39,703 --> 00:53:42,253
Aditya, the truck
left 15 minutes ago.

744
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:43,372
And his phone's
switched off too.

745
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:45,694
Stop him at all cost.
It's a trap!

746
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:47,453
Trap? What trap?

747
00:53:47,582 --> 00:53:49,451
Kaaya, this is not the time
to explain everything.

748
00:53:49,581 --> 00:53:51,322
Just chase the money
and stop it!

749
00:53:58,823 --> 00:53:59,807
Mr. Dutta.

750
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,610
Mr. Dutta is speaking to
the PM on the other line.

751
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,689
Please call later.

752
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,529
I must speak to
Mr. Dutta immediately.

753
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:08,368
Tell him
it's Aditya Diwan calling.

754
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:10,926
Sir, no one's more important
than the Prime Minister.

755
00:54:11,057 --> 00:54:13,335
I'll call you when he's free.

756
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:15,287
Hello.

757
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:17,421
Idiot!

758
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:45,642
Pick up the goddamn phone.

759
00:54:45,771 --> 00:54:47,138
Pick up the phone.

760
00:54:50,304 --> 00:54:53,296
These businessmen only
care about themselves.

761
00:54:55,622 --> 00:54:58,011
Hello, sir.
The Minister's still busy.

762
00:54:58,667 --> 00:54:59,879
I'll ask him to call you.

763
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:01,719
You idiot,
I told you it's urgent.

764
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,439
Give the phone to
Mr. Dutta immediately.

765
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:05,517
I need to speak to him
right now.

766
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:07,567
Hello! Hello!

767
00:55:08,781 --> 00:55:09,872
Damn!

768
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:30,833
Where are you going?

769
00:55:30,963 --> 00:55:32,343
Tell Mr. Dutta that
his package has arrived.

770
00:55:32,474 --> 00:55:36,074
Watchman, let him through.
- Fine, go.

771
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:41,831
Come on.

772
00:55:41,961 --> 00:55:43,109
Straight.

773
00:55:52,832 --> 00:55:53,907
Get down.
- Why, sir?

774
00:55:54,037 --> 00:55:54,908
Get down.

775
00:55:55,038 --> 00:55:57,388
It's only mangoes.
- Mangoes.

776
00:55:57,518 --> 00:55:59,188
Show me.
- Come, sir.

777
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:00,987
Let me show you.
- What's inside?

778
00:56:01,117 --> 00:56:04,106
Open these crates. Come on.

779
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,025
Sir..
- Where?

780
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:09,144
I don't know whose it is.

781
00:56:09,795 --> 00:56:12,066
'As Telecommunication
Minister Dutta'

782
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:15,301
'was arrested
red-handed taking bribe'

783
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:17,425
'the Home Minister,
Delhi has withdrawn'

784
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:20,891
'his proposed Telecommunication
Bill from the parliament.'

785
00:56:21,022 --> 00:56:22,504
'And he has also said'

786
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:25,087
'that he's appointing a
fast-track enquiry commission'

787
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:28,063
'regarding Dutta's bribe case.'

788
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:29,502
'According to our sources'

789
00:56:29,632 --> 00:56:31,222
'the Delhi Home Ministry
has stated'

790
00:56:31,352 --> 00:56:33,981
'that till the enquiry
commission submits its report'

791
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,592
'the telecommunication
bill won't be..'

792
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:38,031
No!

793
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:40,860
Aditya, listen to me. Calm down!
- Rascal!

794
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,661
Calm down, Aditya, listen to me.

795
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:45,909
That Saurav!
I will destroy him!

796
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,470
Well, here I am, Mr. Diwan.

797
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:56,977
Now destroy me.

798
00:56:57,106 --> 00:56:58,365
Who the hell are you?

799
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:01,467
Why are you doing this?

800
00:57:02,065 --> 00:57:04,415
So you know that
my name isn't Saurav.

801
00:57:04,545 --> 00:57:07,222
So let's say I am Gaurav.

802
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:10,344
How's that?
- I am not a fool.

803
00:57:11,258 --> 00:57:13,953
I don't know why
you're doing all this.

804
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:18,732
But I know you're
trying to ruin me

805
00:57:18,863 --> 00:57:20,383
and I won't let that happen.

806
00:57:21,302 --> 00:57:23,199
Listen to that.

807
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:26,119
So you haven't
understood anything yet.

808
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,076
Siya, please explain
your husband.

809
00:57:30,468 --> 00:57:32,089
I mean there's no point
in ruining your whole life

810
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,810
for just one demand.

811
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,313
You rascal.
- Aditya.

812
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:37,369
Aditya, let go.

813
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:39,449
I only believe in love
and not violence.

814
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:41,180
You got the wrong guy.

815
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:46,327
Whoever you are,
I will find out the truth

816
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:49,381
even if I have to
risk my life for it.

817
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:52,340
I'll find out who you are
and I'll destroy you.

818
00:57:52,977 --> 00:57:54,257
I will finish you!

819
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:58,166
You're a strange man.

820
00:57:58,296 --> 00:57:59,096
So you'd rather give your life

821
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,043
and not your consent
to this union.

822
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:07,476
Now this is going to be fun.

823
00:58:08,213 --> 00:58:10,106
Because I never quit

824
00:58:10,814 --> 00:58:12,814
and you don't want to quit.

825
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:17,343
So we must wait
and watch who wins.

826
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:20,072
Because both of us can't win.

827
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,559
And I'm loving this.

828
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:37,911
Please! Please! Please! Please!

829
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,870
Please calm down everyone!

830
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,670
The Minister is on his way.

831
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:44,150
He'll present his side
of story in detail.

832
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,390
After that if anyone
has any questions

833
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:47,669
then he can ask them.

834
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,942
Please be patient.

835
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:54,917
Move please. Stay back. Back.
Move aside.

836
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,728
I would like to
clearly state

837
00:59:02,157 --> 00:59:04,094
that the truck carrying cash

838
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:06,905
seized by the CBI
outside my home

839
00:59:07,035 --> 00:59:09,745
is that I have no
connection to that money.

840
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:11,546
Nor do I know anything about it.

841
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:14,385
Why? Who? And what
this money was sent for?

842
00:59:14,514 --> 00:59:17,303
Mr. Minister, the truck
was seized outside your home.

843
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:18,383
So it was meant for you, right?

844
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,983
If there's a buffalo
standing outside your home

845
00:59:21,113 --> 00:59:22,812
will that make
the buffalo yours?

846
00:59:24,246 --> 00:59:25,262
According to our sources

847
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:27,301
this money was
sent to buy out few MPs.

848
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:28,062
Is it true?

849
00:59:28,192 --> 00:59:30,462
Please think before
you ask question.

850
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:32,060
Everyone knows

851
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:34,981
our party has a majority
in the Parliament.

852
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,660
So why would we buy
out MPs from other parties?

853
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:38,821
Who does the money belong to?

854
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:40,699
The police are carrying
out an investigation.

855
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:43,739
'But according to my
experience in politics'

856
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:47,498
'I can definitely say
that a businessman friend'

857
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:50,267
'of the opposite party
is trying to instigate me.'

858
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,618
'Excuse me.'

859
00:59:51,749 --> 00:59:52,867
'Thank you.'

860
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:56,787
Sir, by telling the media

861
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:59,226
that this can be the job
of an industrialist

862
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:04,901
Dutta has tied
the noose around you.

863
01:00:08,145 --> 01:00:09,934
And now he can
stoop to any level

864
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:11,844
in order to save
his reputation and post.

865
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:14,793
Sir, could it be possible

866
01:00:15,102 --> 01:00:16,667
that Saurav has joined
hands with the Minister.

867
01:00:16,797 --> 01:00:18,053
Kill that Saurav.

868
01:00:18,183 --> 01:00:20,941
Finish him, I don't care.
Just finish that rascal.

869
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:26,920
Aditya.

870
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:32,570
In order to get out
of this situation

871
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:36,730
before we kill Saurav,
we must find out

872
01:00:36,859 --> 01:00:40,074
how he knew that we sent Kaaya.

873
01:00:41,963 --> 01:00:42,996
Where's Kaaya?

874
01:00:44,176 --> 01:00:45,367
I don't know, sir.

875
01:00:45,497 --> 01:00:48,307
I've been trying to call her,
but her phone's switched off.

876
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:50,815
I don't know where she is.

877
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:09,694
"How did this happen?"

878
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:13,921
"How did this happen?"

879
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:18,041
"How did this happen?"

880
01:01:18,172 --> 01:01:22,331
"How did this happen?"

881
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:35,039
"Whenever I think of you
it only makes me cry."

882
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:36,958
"O tormentor you should know"

883
01:01:37,087 --> 01:01:39,277
"I love to hate you, baby."

884
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:43,477
"Whenever I think of you
it only makes me cry."

885
01:01:43,606 --> 01:01:45,355
"O tormentor you should know"

886
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:47,499
"I love to hate you, baby."

887
01:01:53,564 --> 01:01:55,564
"I love to hate you, baby."

888
01:02:01,963 --> 01:02:03,962
"I love to hate you, baby."

889
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,444
"Why did you.."

890
01:02:15,575 --> 01:02:18,591
"Why did you listen
to your mom?"

891
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:22,709
"When I used to say that
my heaven's at your feet."

892
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:23,871
"Why did you.."

893
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,947
"Why did you listen
to your mom?"

894
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:31,398
"When I used to say that
my heaven's at your feet."

895
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:33,707
"Why did I stay quiet?"

896
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,826
"Why didn't I scream I say?"

897
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:37,666
"Every time you tormented me."

898
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,717
"I love to hate you, baby."

899
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:47,914
"I love to hate you, baby."

900
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:56,291
"I love to hate you, baby."

901
01:03:24,507 --> 01:03:26,286
Kaaya! Kaaya!

902
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:30,427
You're a cheat.

903
01:03:31,147 --> 01:03:33,348
I love you
and you stab me in the back.

904
01:03:34,307 --> 01:03:36,266
And you take the knife
and stab me back.

905
01:03:45,145 --> 01:03:46,227
I missed you.

906
01:03:53,582 --> 01:03:57,161
Look, I was only following
Aditya's instructions.

907
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,566
You win and I lose.

908
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,409
Please let me go.

909
01:04:03,357 --> 01:04:06,536
Don't worry.
I am not Aditya.

910
01:04:07,003 --> 01:04:09,513
I won't show you dreams
of heaven and throw you in hell.

911
01:04:10,335 --> 01:04:11,739
But the choice is yours.

912
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:17,371
If you want
you can be with me again.

913
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:19,010
Close to me.

914
01:04:20,513 --> 01:04:22,914
I haven't forgotten
our nights together.

915
01:04:23,456 --> 01:04:26,617
Or you can stay in jail
with convicts like you.

916
01:04:27,337 --> 01:04:28,726
And they too I'm
sure will give you

917
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:31,573
many-many nights
that you'll never forget.

918
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:37,934
Almost forgot.
I want you to hear something.

919
01:04:46,184 --> 01:04:47,443
'Hello.'

920
01:04:47,572 --> 01:04:48,638
'Kaaya.'

921
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,722
'We need to deliver 500 million'

922
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:52,970
'to Telecommunication's
Minister Dutta's home.'

923
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:55,384
'Give this job to
someone trustworthy.'

924
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,010
'Don't worry.'

925
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:02,955
You thought only you can
tap phones and record calls.

926
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:04,639
What's the first rule of enmity?

927
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:07,729
Never, ever, ever
underestimate your enemy.

928
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:11,220
Never underestimate your enemy.

929
01:05:11,622 --> 01:05:13,117
And this dialogue's
repeated in every movie.

930
01:05:13,248 --> 01:05:15,358
Really. Shame on you.

931
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:21,204
I could've released this
recording to the media.

932
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:23,830
Or handed it over to the police.

933
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:26,748
But I know you're
just a pawn in this game.

934
01:05:28,245 --> 01:05:29,555
And so I want to
give you a chance

935
01:05:29,686 --> 01:05:30,634
to save yourself from all this.

936
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:31,807
What say?

937
01:05:32,785 --> 01:05:33,954
Do you want to
clear out of this?

938
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:35,204
What do you want?

939
01:05:45,361 --> 01:05:46,441
Kaaya.

940
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,591
Hello, Kaaya.
Where have you been?

941
01:05:48,722 --> 01:05:50,879
Aditya, I am tired.

942
01:05:51,685 --> 01:05:53,189
First, the soft drink
factory case

943
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,923
and now the
Communication's Bill.

944
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,475
How long are you going
to use me for your profit?

945
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,198
I want out.

946
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:05,202
Please protect me.

947
01:06:05,468 --> 01:06:08,639
I am tired, Aditya.
I am tired.

948
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,347
Come back to Mumbai, Kaaya.
We'll work something out, yeah?

949
01:06:12,476 --> 01:06:15,274
No! No more deals!

950
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:17,720
I just want a
letter of assurance

951
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:21,584
stating that I've nothing
to with these incidents.

952
01:06:21,715 --> 01:06:23,556
That's it.
- Don't you trust me, Kaaya?

953
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:25,474
No, I don't trust anyone!

954
01:06:26,008 --> 01:06:29,464
If you don't help me
and give me that letter

955
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:33,508
I'll tell the press that
you tried to bribe the Minister.

956
01:06:34,452 --> 01:06:35,821
It's simple, Aditya.

957
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:39,315
If I go down
I'll take you with me.

958
01:06:39,911 --> 01:06:41,056
Damn it!

959
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,558
And the award goes to Kaaya!

960
01:06:55,198 --> 01:06:59,337
Kaaya, you're so beautiful,
so talented, so dangerous.

961
01:06:59,468 --> 01:07:01,983
You should've been an actor!
Really.

962
01:07:04,283 --> 01:07:07,354
Okay, enough.
I am sorry.

963
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,662
Please stop crying. Please.

964
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:15,406
Please stop.

965
01:07:16,105 --> 01:07:19,043
I told you
I am with you.

966
01:07:20,952 --> 01:07:22,043
Enough.

967
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,761
You're my responsibility now.

968
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,373
That's it.

969
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:31,441
We're one team, right?
- Yeah!

970
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:35,127
We're one team.

971
01:08:00,975 --> 01:08:03,175
Do come in my dreams and tell me

972
01:08:03,535 --> 01:08:05,496
if there's life after death.

973
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:09,455
Okay?

974
01:08:14,694 --> 01:08:15,944
Take care of this.

975
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:30,655
Kaaya is dead.

976
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,170
Aditya.

977
01:08:39,889 --> 01:08:41,450
This wasn't Kaaya.

978
01:08:43,049 --> 01:08:44,328
What do you mean?

979
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,699
I mean, it was
Kaaya speaking

980
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:50,048
but the words were not hers.

981
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:53,447
I am a woman. I can sense it.

982
01:08:55,384 --> 01:08:56,966
You mean Saurav Singhania.

983
01:08:57,832 --> 01:09:01,755
Yes. I think he's trying
to use her against us.

984
01:09:01,885 --> 01:09:03,724
Ms. Siya is absolutely
right, sir.

985
01:09:04,952 --> 01:09:07,535
He's trying to set you up
in a bigger mess.

986
01:09:09,263 --> 01:09:10,593
Take my advice, sir.

987
01:09:10,722 --> 01:09:14,993
Siya and you must
leave India for few days.

988
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:16,673
Vaswani, what are you trying..

989
01:09:16,802 --> 01:09:20,673
Sir, I am well-versed
with the law of the land.

990
01:09:20,802 --> 01:09:24,174
Please take my advice
and leave for USA tonight.

991
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:25,550
I'll make all the arrangements.

992
01:09:25,681 --> 01:09:27,990
I am not a coward.
I am not going anywhere.

993
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,822
Sir..
- Aditya. Vaswani is right.

994
01:09:31,951 --> 01:09:34,045
We need to retreat
to think clearly.

995
01:10:02,334 --> 01:10:03,356
Let's go.

996
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:51,701
Hello.

997
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:53,584
It's done.

998
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:02,133
Come on, have some.
- Of course.

999
01:11:02,264 --> 01:11:04,305
Yes, Mr. Singhania.

1000
01:11:05,263 --> 01:11:07,051
I told you I am the only man

1001
01:11:07,182 --> 01:11:09,271
who can get you
out of this quagmire.

1002
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:11,850
You don't need to worry now.

1003
01:11:11,981 --> 01:11:14,934
Mr. Singhania, I never
doubted your ability.

1004
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:19,775
So I expect you'll keep
your end of the promise.

1005
01:11:20,738 --> 01:11:22,529
Of course, Mr. Singhania.

1006
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:23,583
Of course.

1007
01:11:42,209 --> 01:11:45,123
I am sorry, Mr. Diwan.
You're under arrest.

1008
01:11:45,444 --> 01:11:46,935
How dare you touch me!

1009
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:51,019
I am no petty thief whom an
ordinary cop like you can touch.

1010
01:11:51,806 --> 01:11:55,549
My name's Aditya Diwan.
Do you know who I am?

1011
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,022
I do.

1012
01:11:57,335 --> 01:11:59,003
And I also know

1013
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:02,195
that you've been charged with
the murder of Ms. Kaaya Sharma.

1014
01:12:04,423 --> 01:12:05,363
What?

1015
01:12:08,499 --> 01:12:11,067
On the day of the first hearing
we've received information

1016
01:12:11,197 --> 01:12:14,875
that the police have found
Kaaya Sharma's body

1017
01:12:15,005 --> 01:12:17,038
few miles outside Mumbai,
from a deserted road.

1018
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:18,398
Murder mixed with politics.

1019
01:12:18,528 --> 01:12:21,197
Well yes, this happens to be one
of the biggest cases this year.

1020
01:12:21,328 --> 01:12:22,798
And as you can see
right behind me

1021
01:12:22,928 --> 01:12:24,518
we're outside this
court bringing to you

1022
01:12:24,647 --> 01:12:25,557
every single update.

1023
01:12:25,686 --> 01:12:27,680
This case looks
quite interesting

1024
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,528
even before it started.

1025
01:12:41,004 --> 01:12:44,874
Stay back. Stay back everyone.

1026
01:12:45,004 --> 01:12:47,131
Sir, we have a question, sir.

1027
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,392
What's your connection to
Kaaya Sharma's murder? - Sir..

1028
01:12:49,523 --> 01:12:51,402
Do you have anything to do with
Kaaya Sharma's murder case, sir?

1029
01:12:51,532 --> 01:12:52,872
Sir..
- Please answer us.

1030
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:53,912
Sir, please.

1031
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:55,711
Sir, please.
Please answer us.

1032
01:12:55,841 --> 01:12:57,286
Sir, please.
You have to answer.

1033
01:12:58,481 --> 01:12:59,880
Please be seated.

1034
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,109
Mr. Public Prosecutor,
you may proceed.

1035
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,974
Your Honor, right from
pesticide being found

1036
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:14,638
in Mr. Aditya Diwan's
soft drink factory

1037
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:17,397
to the Telecommunication Bill

1038
01:13:18,277 --> 01:13:24,512
Mr. Aditya Diwan used
Ms. Kaaya cunningly.

1039
01:13:25,315 --> 01:13:27,226
When Mr. Diwan felt

1040
01:13:27,356 --> 01:13:32,594
that she's becoming a threat
for him or his business

1041
01:13:32,723 --> 01:13:35,793
then Mr. Diwan got rid of her.

1042
01:13:40,113 --> 01:13:41,150
Your Honor

1043
01:13:42,712 --> 01:13:44,192
this is not a case.

1044
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:48,351
It's just a bail
application hearing.

1045
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,659
Whether my client,
Mr. Aditya Diwan

1046
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:53,340
is guilty or not

1047
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,180
we'll find that out later.

1048
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,661
Mr. Prosecutor,
can you prove here

1049
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:01,980
that Mr. Diwan is involved
in this murder

1050
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:04,218
and he needs to be questioned?

1051
01:14:04,348 --> 01:14:08,980
Your Honor, I have evidence
to prove all the facts.

1052
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:20,223
My Lord, this is the recording
of two telephonic conversations

1053
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:23,895
that happened between
Mr. Aditya and Ms. Kaaya Sharma.

1054
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:25,536
Along with the lab certificate

1055
01:14:25,664 --> 01:14:29,186
which proves that these are
Mr. Aditya Diwan

1056
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:30,838
and Ms. Kaaya Sharma's voices.

1057
01:14:57,379 --> 01:14:58,658
'Hello.
- Kaaya.'

1058
01:14:59,498 --> 01:15:00,727
'We need to deliver
500 million'

1059
01:15:00,858 --> 01:15:02,819
'to Telecommunication
Minister Dutta's home.'

1060
01:15:03,578 --> 01:15:05,292
'Give this job to
someone trustworthy.'

1061
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:06,497
'Don't worry.'

1062
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:12,655
Order! Order!

1063
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:14,259
Silence please.

1064
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:18,055
My Lord, this is
the second recording

1065
01:15:18,419 --> 01:15:23,445
which proves that
Ms. Kaaya was tired of all this

1066
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:26,693
and wanted to stay
away from everything.

1067
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:31,030
'Hello, Kaaya,
where have you been?'

1068
01:15:31,973 --> 01:15:33,925
'Aditya, I am tired.'

1069
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:35,962
'First the soft
drink factory case'

1070
01:15:36,092 --> 01:15:37,602
'and now the
Communication's Bill.'

1071
01:15:37,732 --> 01:15:40,921
'How long are you going
to use me for your profit?'

1072
01:15:41,051 --> 01:15:42,160
'I want out.'

1073
01:15:42,531 --> 01:15:43,882
'Please protect me.'

1074
01:15:44,012 --> 01:15:46,849
'I am tired, Aditya.
I am tired.'

1075
01:15:57,088 --> 01:15:59,757
'Kaaya, come back to Mumbai.
We'll work out something, yeah?'

1076
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,757
'No, I don't trust anyone!
It's simple, Aditya.'

1077
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:05,366
'If I go down
I'll take you with me.'

1078
01:16:09,299 --> 01:16:12,764
My Lord, we're worried
that Mr. Aditya Diwan

1079
01:16:12,894 --> 01:16:16,474
can tamper with evidence
and intimidate the witnesses.

1080
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:19,153
So I request the court

1081
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,673
that Mr. Aditya Diwan
shouldn't be granted bail

1082
01:16:22,804 --> 01:16:25,477
until the police doesn't
complete their investigation.

1083
01:16:25,607 --> 01:16:26,735
That's all, Your Honor.

1084
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:34,590
After listening
to all the arguments

1085
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,871
the court orders Aditya Diwan

1086
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:38,831
to be remanded
in police custody

1087
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:41,658
until the police conducts
its investigation.

1088
01:16:57,794 --> 01:16:58,706
Move. Step back.

1089
01:16:58,836 --> 01:17:01,065
Is it true that you
murdered Kaaya Sharma?

1090
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:02,145
Move.

1091
01:17:02,275 --> 01:17:04,523
Are there more people
involved in this?

1092
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:07,634
The evidence is against you.
How can you run from here?

1093
01:17:09,331 --> 01:17:11,104
How are you connected
to Kaaya Murder case?

1094
01:17:11,234 --> 01:17:12,357
Please tell us.

1095
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:15,882
Mr. Diwan, what secrets did
Kaaya know about you?

1096
01:17:17,374 --> 01:17:18,742
Please tell us.

1097
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:22,066
Sir..
- Move. Let him go.

1098
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:40,388
'My faith in the law of
this country has been restored.'

1099
01:17:40,519 --> 01:17:45,697
'The opposition has used one
of their industrialist friend'

1100
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,338
'in order to humiliate me.'

1101
01:17:47,467 --> 01:17:48,866
'What's his name?'

1102
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,178
'Aditya Diwan?'

1103
01:17:50,307 --> 01:17:52,056
'Yes, Aditya Diwan.'

1104
01:17:52,187 --> 01:17:54,866
'This is the first time
I even heard his name.'

1105
01:17:56,026 --> 01:17:58,345
'But I promise'

1106
01:17:58,475 --> 01:18:00,735
'I'll take strict
actions against him'

1107
01:18:00,865 --> 01:18:03,855
'and he'll never
forget my name.'

1108
01:18:05,105 --> 01:18:06,959
This politician is a rascal.

1109
01:18:07,702 --> 01:18:09,213
We helped him attain power

1110
01:18:09,343 --> 01:18:12,658
and now he'll use
Mr. Aditya as a pawn

1111
01:18:13,782 --> 01:18:17,302
for his politics and sacrifice
him in order to save his post.

1112
01:18:19,062 --> 01:18:21,582
He won't let him
come out of jail.

1113
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:24,571
I don't know what to do.

1114
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,165
You only have five minutes.

1115
01:18:55,614 --> 01:18:59,003
Siya, tell Vaswani to get
the best legal team.

1116
01:19:01,538 --> 01:19:03,573
Get me out of here soon.

1117
01:19:05,186 --> 01:19:07,492
Just get me out
of this goddamn place.

1118
01:19:09,972 --> 01:19:13,532
I will handle that, but..

1119
01:19:13,691 --> 01:19:14,771
But what?

1120
01:19:16,411 --> 01:19:18,290
After you left,
outside the court..

1121
01:19:29,129 --> 01:19:32,411
You know, I can get your husband
out of jail if you want.

1122
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:35,455
But you see

1123
01:19:37,838 --> 01:19:41,188
my wishes alone don't count.

1124
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:44,631
You should too.

1125
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:53,920
Rascal!

1126
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:03,409
Siya, listen to me carefully.

1127
01:20:03,811 --> 01:20:05,845
Even if I'm jailed for life

1128
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,077
you won't let that
Saurav intimidate you.

1129
01:20:11,248 --> 01:20:12,530
Promise me!

1130
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:15,591
Just promise me!

1131
01:21:01,992 --> 01:21:03,871
You took really long
to get here.

1132
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,148
You win.

1133
01:21:11,669 --> 01:21:13,549
I don't know why
you're doing this.

1134
01:21:14,575 --> 01:21:16,554
But tonight, I..

1135
01:21:19,028 --> 01:21:21,097
I don't know what
happiness you get

1136
01:21:21,227 --> 01:21:23,827
by taking advantage
of someone's helplessness.

1137
01:21:25,252 --> 01:21:28,106
But I want evidence
to prove Aditya innocent.

1138
01:21:37,145 --> 01:21:38,744
My father used to tell me.

1139
01:21:40,248 --> 01:21:41,842
No one gets rich easily.

1140
01:21:42,622 --> 01:21:46,572
Behind every fortune,
there's a crime.

1141
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:51,197
You're not helpless
nor am I.

1142
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:55,050
I don't know what
you're talking about!

1143
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,317
That's all right.

1144
01:21:56,702 --> 01:21:58,736
And anyway,
you didn't come here to debate.

1145
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,776
So why are we getting
into a debate, right.

1146
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:04,743
We should do what
you're here for.

1147
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:06,591
So come on.

1148
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:08,836
Seduce me.

1149
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:12,718
I am not a slave whom you
paid to make you happy.

1150
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:15,081
I don't please for money.

1151
01:22:15,814 --> 01:22:17,946
No one really does it for money.

1152
01:22:20,737 --> 01:22:24,358
Even a prostitute doesn't
charge you for sex.

1153
01:22:25,976 --> 01:22:29,391
In fact, she charges you for
leaving your bed after the sex.

1154
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,452
You can leave too

1155
01:22:35,012 --> 01:22:36,373
with the evidence.

1156
01:22:37,476 --> 01:22:40,415
You're a cheap rascal!

1157
01:22:53,829 --> 01:22:55,093
Here you go.

1158
01:22:55,928 --> 01:22:57,051
It'll help you.

1159
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:59,792
See, the way I see it
you've only two choices.

1160
01:23:01,432 --> 01:23:03,052
Either you be a slave

1161
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,175
or you be a widow.

1162
01:23:37,282 --> 01:23:45,485
"How do I say
how restless I am in your love?"

1163
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:53,619
"I want to look in your eyes
and steal your dreams."

1164
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:05,934
"How do I say
how restless I am in your love?"

1165
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:15,211
"I want to look in your eyes
and steal your dreams."

1166
01:24:15,694 --> 01:24:21,967
"That's my shadow"

1167
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:30,869
"the place where
you're standing now."

1168
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:36,696
"I am alive"

1169
01:24:37,036 --> 01:24:44,970
"and the reason is you."

1170
01:24:46,754 --> 01:24:52,086
"I am alive"

1171
01:24:52,541 --> 01:25:00,533
"and the reason is you."

1172
01:25:22,773 --> 01:25:26,982
"It's an intoxication,
it's a poison."

1173
01:25:27,112 --> 01:25:31,580
"What do we call this love?"

1174
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:35,694
"What do we call this love?"

1175
01:25:36,061 --> 01:25:40,340
"It's an intoxication,
it's a poison."

1176
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:44,760
"What do we call this love?"

1177
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:49,226
"There's a saga that's
been incomplete for a long."

1178
01:25:49,357 --> 01:25:53,127
"Let's complete it."

1179
01:25:53,257 --> 01:25:59,416
"How can I forget you?"

1180
01:25:59,835 --> 01:26:07,935
"You're my first mistake."

1181
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:14,216
"I am alive"

1182
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:23,304
"and the reason is you."

1183
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:48,956
"You don't know my intentions."

1184
01:26:49,087 --> 01:26:53,446
"I'll steal your breath."

1185
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:57,715
"My heart's telling me
to be a criminal."

1186
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:02,033
"There's peace
beyond these crimes."

1187
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:08,084
"I am the lost night"

1188
01:27:08,475 --> 01:27:16,735
"and you're my
pleasant morning."

1189
01:27:17,343 --> 01:27:22,731
"I am alive"

1190
01:27:23,132 --> 01:27:31,432
"and the reason is you."

1191
01:27:40,018 --> 01:27:42,077
I want evidence of
Aditya's innocence.

1192
01:27:42,207 --> 01:27:43,560
What's the hurry?

1193
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:10,187
What are you thinking?

1194
01:28:18,933 --> 01:28:21,807
It's been three months
since papa died.

1195
01:28:23,389 --> 01:28:25,449
The lawyer is going
to read out his will soon.

1196
01:28:27,061 --> 01:28:30,667
Just scared that papa didn't
give me any responsibility

1197
01:28:31,546 --> 01:28:33,068
that I can't handle.

1198
01:28:33,397 --> 01:28:34,537
Don't worry

1199
01:28:34,667 --> 01:28:37,297
I'm sure papa didn't give you
any responsibility

1200
01:28:37,426 --> 01:28:38,718
that you can't handle.

1201
01:28:39,752 --> 01:28:42,785
Brother, you're not dressed yet.

1202
01:28:42,915 --> 01:28:45,211
We're getting late.
- 10 minutes.

1203
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:54,173
With everyone's permission

1204
01:28:54,303 --> 01:28:56,662
I would like to
start reading this will.

1205
01:29:01,657 --> 01:29:04,492
I, Raghavendra Diwan am
making this will

1206
01:29:04,622 --> 01:29:07,932
in complete senses and not
under anyone's pressure.

1207
01:29:09,397 --> 01:29:12,053
I believe if
Diwan Group of Companies

1208
01:29:12,182 --> 01:29:14,049
wants to achieve
new heights of success

1209
01:29:14,179 --> 01:29:17,849
then it needs experience
as well as zest.

1210
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:21,128
And so I consider
myself fortunate

1211
01:29:21,258 --> 01:29:23,728
that I have two sons who
trust and love each other.

1212
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,737
Vikram and Aditya.

1213
01:29:26,497 --> 01:29:29,006
I want my elder son Vikram Diwan

1214
01:29:29,136 --> 01:29:31,647
to be the heir
to all my properties

1215
01:29:31,777 --> 01:29:34,018
and the chairman
to Diwan Group of Companies.

1216
01:29:34,776 --> 01:29:36,885
And my younger son Aditya Diwan

1217
01:29:37,016 --> 01:29:38,393
will become the vice president.

1218
01:29:41,505 --> 01:29:42,904
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1219
01:29:43,938 --> 01:29:45,834
We'll do as papa wanted.

1220
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:48,334
I am so happy.

1221
01:29:59,812 --> 01:30:01,641
Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

1222
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:04,121
I am so, so happy today.
- Thank you.

1223
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:07,239
Aditya, I am sure there's
an informer in our boardroom.

1224
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:10,319
How else did Siya know that I
am the chairman starting today?

1225
01:30:10,449 --> 01:30:12,278
It must be that Vaswani.

1226
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:14,038
'Madam, I got some good news.'
It's him, isn't it?

1227
01:30:14,169 --> 01:30:16,088
Aditya, you're so mean.

1228
01:30:16,982 --> 01:30:18,917
Yes, it was Vaswani.
- Okay.

1229
01:30:19,048 --> 01:30:20,888
Now come on,
will you give me a hug or not.

1230
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,067
Yeah.

1231
01:30:23,807 --> 01:30:26,437
And on this joyous occasion,
tonight there's a celebration.

1232
01:30:26,566 --> 01:30:27,689
A party.

1233
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:30,195
Now run to the salon
and I'll pick you up at 8.

1234
01:30:30,326 --> 01:30:31,395
Okay?

1235
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:32,515
See you.

1236
01:30:36,105 --> 01:30:38,451
Vikram, you're 15 minutes early.

1237
01:30:39,563 --> 01:30:41,116
I am still getting ready.

1238
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:47,580
You cheat!

1239
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:50,432
You were showering him with
your love today, weren't you?

1240
01:30:50,562 --> 01:30:52,961
Since he became the chairman
and took over the property

1241
01:30:53,092 --> 01:30:54,511
you showed your true colors.

1242
01:30:54,641 --> 01:30:56,590
Now I understand your true plan.

1243
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,191
First, please both the brothers.

1244
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,849
And then find your happiness
with the richer one.

1245
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:07,218
Are you crazy?

1246
01:31:08,612 --> 01:31:11,972
You know I love you.

1247
01:31:14,383 --> 01:31:18,666
And it was your decision
to hide our affair.

1248
01:31:18,797 --> 01:31:21,110
We decided to fall in love

1249
01:31:21,715 --> 01:31:23,373
not to make deals in love.

1250
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:27,956
You think I am making a deal?

1251
01:31:28,395 --> 01:31:32,583
So? If you really love me
then prove it to me.

1252
01:31:32,714 --> 01:31:34,890
Prove that you're not
in this for the money.

1253
01:31:35,596 --> 01:31:36,703
Tonight, after the party

1254
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:38,833
you'll come with me
to my bedroom.

1255
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,992
And if you don't do it

1256
01:31:41,806 --> 01:31:43,885
then I promise you I'll
never see your face again.

1257
01:31:44,454 --> 01:31:46,111
If you're not with me

1258
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:48,427
you're against me.

1259
01:32:03,396 --> 01:32:04,219
Hey.
- Congratulations.

1260
01:32:04,348 --> 01:32:05,345
Thank you.

1261
01:32:06,368 --> 01:32:07,458
Hi, Aditya.
- Hi.

1262
01:32:07,587 --> 01:32:08,697
Where's Vikram?

1263
01:32:08,827 --> 01:32:10,257
The host is late
at his own party.

1264
01:32:10,386 --> 01:32:12,096
This is not fair.
- Cheers.

1265
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:12,816
Hi.
- Hi.

1266
01:32:12,947 --> 01:32:14,243
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1267
01:32:14,827 --> 01:32:16,742
Hello, Aditya. Where's Vikram?

1268
01:32:16,946 --> 01:32:18,628
He'll be here soon.

1269
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,010
No, he's already here.

1270
01:32:22,544 --> 01:32:25,020
There he is!
The man of the moment.

1271
01:32:25,995 --> 01:32:26,934
Congratulations.

1272
01:32:27,064 --> 01:32:28,494
Thank you so much.

1273
01:32:28,624 --> 01:32:29,646
Hi, Siya.

1274
01:32:31,236 --> 01:32:32,403
Hi.

1275
01:32:32,823 --> 01:32:33,995
Meet Mr. Mehta.

1276
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:35,692
Old associate of ours.
- Hi.

1277
01:32:35,822 --> 01:32:37,372
Hello.
- Hi.

1278
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,810
How are you?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

1279
01:32:38,942 --> 01:32:40,069
How are you?
- All okay.

1280
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,939
Everybody, may I have
your attention please.

1281
01:32:55,498 --> 01:32:56,539
Thank you.

1282
01:32:57,226 --> 01:32:59,258
Where's Aditya?
Aditya.

1283
01:32:59,858 --> 01:33:00,926
Aditya.

1284
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:04,096
There he is.
Come here.

1285
01:33:04,416 --> 01:33:06,136
Yeah.
- My handsome younger brother.

1286
01:33:18,178 --> 01:33:21,572
First of all, both of us
want to thank you, all of you.

1287
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:24,184
For making it here
at such a short notice.

1288
01:33:25,173 --> 01:33:26,763
By coming here,
all of you proved

1289
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:29,413
that what our papa
said was right.

1290
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:31,333
He always said

1291
01:33:31,711 --> 01:33:35,971
that 'friends can make you
feel happiest in the world'.

1292
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,402
And we're very fortunate

1293
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:43,321
that we have so many friends
to be a part of our happiness.

1294
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:44,784
So thank you, all of you.

1295
01:33:47,765 --> 01:33:49,409
But..

1296
01:33:50,087 --> 01:33:51,247
There's someone here

1297
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:55,728
who can add to our happiness.

1298
01:34:04,115 --> 01:34:07,366
Siya, you know I love you a lot.

1299
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:12,405
And I know I'll never
be happy without you.

1300
01:34:13,087 --> 01:34:15,220
So why don't we
live together forever

1301
01:34:15,988 --> 01:34:18,197
and make each other happy?

1302
01:34:24,983 --> 01:34:26,150
Will you marry me?

1303
01:34:28,228 --> 01:34:30,480
Oh come on, say yes.
- Say yes.

1304
01:34:30,811 --> 01:34:32,080
Say yes.

1305
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,390
Say yes.
- Say yes!

1306
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,353
Come on.

1307
01:34:37,599 --> 01:34:39,404
Say yes.

1308
01:34:39,797 --> 01:34:40,839
Yes!

1309
01:34:45,278 --> 01:34:46,412
Siya.

1310
01:35:18,651 --> 01:35:20,708
Don't doubt me so much.

1311
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:25,271
How many times do I tell you
that I only love you.

1312
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:27,750
I can't live without you.

1313
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:31,309
If that's true
then help me kill Vikram.

1314
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,160
What?

1315
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:36,739
Aditya..

1316
01:35:36,869 --> 01:35:39,032
Aditya, I..

1317
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:42,948
I cannot kill anyone.

1318
01:35:44,088 --> 01:35:45,627
I can't do it.

1319
01:35:46,678 --> 01:35:48,199
Strange love!

1320
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:52,164
You don't want to see
your lover happy.

1321
01:35:54,769 --> 01:35:57,175
What happiness will you get
by killing your elder brother?

1322
01:35:57,304 --> 01:35:58,945
He's not my elder brother.

1323
01:35:59,669 --> 01:36:00,933
He's my enemy.

1324
01:36:01,063 --> 01:36:03,307
He snatched away
everything I ever wanted.

1325
01:36:04,643 --> 01:36:06,533
Mom's favorite son.
Dad's respect.

1326
01:36:06,663 --> 01:36:08,863
School, college,
studies, sports..

1327
01:36:08,993 --> 01:36:10,582
He was better than me
in everything.

1328
01:36:13,622 --> 01:36:15,795
When I fell for you,
he snatched you too.

1329
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:18,760
I am tired of being no.2.

1330
01:36:19,604 --> 01:36:22,782
I want to be no.1.
I want to be the best.

1331
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,432
Enough.

1332
01:36:26,379 --> 01:36:27,476
Enough!

1333
01:36:28,236 --> 01:36:30,234
I won't get anything
as long as he's alive.

1334
01:36:33,437 --> 01:36:35,033
I want to be the chairman.

1335
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,057
The owner.

1336
01:36:38,403 --> 01:36:39,897
Are you with me or not?

1337
01:36:41,817 --> 01:36:44,054
Are you with me or not?

1338
01:36:51,815 --> 01:36:53,748
Definitely I will. Okay.

1339
01:36:56,093 --> 01:36:57,963
Anyway, let's meet and talk.

1340
01:36:58,093 --> 01:36:59,252
Okay, see you, bro.

1341
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,492
Thanks. See you.

1342
01:37:02,853 --> 01:37:04,603
Neha, inform the pilot
that we're ready.

1343
01:37:04,733 --> 01:37:05,833
Okay, sir.

1344
01:37:09,331 --> 01:37:12,250
I am gonna miss you so much.
- I'll miss you too.

1345
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:16,017
See you.

1346
01:37:57,002 --> 01:37:58,291
You're alive

1347
01:38:00,093 --> 01:38:01,614
but your face.

1348
01:38:03,705 --> 01:38:05,043
How's it possible?

1349
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,201
How can anyone survive
such a plane crash?

1350
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,113
That's why, no body was found.

1351
01:38:12,085 --> 01:38:13,513
And with plastic surgery..

1352
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,681
I can't believe it.

1353
01:38:22,478 --> 01:38:25,827
Look Vikram,
this is not my fault.

1354
01:38:30,383 --> 01:38:31,582
Just shut up.

1355
01:38:35,181 --> 01:38:36,935
I didn't want to

1356
01:38:38,675 --> 01:38:40,514
spend a moment with you.

1357
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:42,073
I still don't.

1358
01:38:42,585 --> 01:38:45,155
I did this to show you
the truth.

1359
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:48,179
And anyway

1360
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:51,138
you were always so cheap

1361
01:38:52,912 --> 01:38:54,150
and you still are.

1362
01:38:55,258 --> 01:38:57,007
Only your price has changed.

1363
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:06,228
What's this?

1364
01:39:06,988 --> 01:39:08,261
With these papers

1365
01:39:09,067 --> 01:39:10,259
you must return everything

1366
01:39:10,387 --> 01:39:12,948
that you and your husband
took from me.

1367
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:18,793
You want evidence for
Aditya's innocence, don't you?

1368
01:39:20,882 --> 01:39:22,543
I think you should get going.

1369
01:39:28,985 --> 01:39:30,657
How is that possible?

1370
01:39:31,865 --> 01:39:33,412
Saurav is Vikram.

1371
01:39:35,236 --> 01:39:37,205
Are you sure?
- Yes, Aditya.

1372
01:39:37,874 --> 01:39:42,062
The tattoo and everything
that I only told Vikram.

1373
01:39:42,193 --> 01:39:43,788
He knows everything.

1374
01:39:44,263 --> 01:39:45,802
He's definitely Vikram.

1375
01:39:47,622 --> 01:39:49,282
Sometimes I feel

1376
01:39:50,298 --> 01:39:52,487
God's definitely against me.

1377
01:39:53,897 --> 01:39:55,856
Some game He's playing with me.

1378
01:39:56,863 --> 01:39:58,375
I can hear Him laughing.

1379
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:03,875
He wants you to
sign these papers

1380
01:40:04,006 --> 01:40:08,047
and return him his properties,
business, everything.

1381
01:40:08,177 --> 01:40:10,716
Only then will he handover
the evidence of your innocence.

1382
01:40:13,191 --> 01:40:15,380
He has played a really big plan.

1383
01:40:16,497 --> 01:40:18,457
Our plans are foiled.

1384
01:40:20,417 --> 01:40:22,170
What do we do now, Aditya?

1385
01:40:22,995 --> 01:40:25,584
I won't let God win.

1386
01:40:27,535 --> 01:40:29,791
He might have saved Vikram

1387
01:40:30,972 --> 01:40:33,333
and got me locked up behind bars

1388
01:40:34,533 --> 01:40:36,806
and turned the world against me

1389
01:40:39,092 --> 01:40:40,962
but I will win.

1390
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:43,612
Aditya, please.

1391
01:40:44,925 --> 01:40:46,490
You're scaring me now.

1392
01:40:48,811 --> 01:40:52,401
You are not a loser
if you fall.

1393
01:40:54,076 --> 01:40:56,802
You are a loser
if you don't get up.

1394
01:40:59,169 --> 01:41:02,814
It's time to rise up
in this game, Siya.

1395
01:41:11,036 --> 01:41:12,307
Here are the papers.

1396
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:26,252
First handover the evidence
of Aditya's innocence.

1397
01:41:27,386 --> 01:41:28,482
Shucks..

1398
01:41:31,635 --> 01:41:33,602
Let me check the papers first.
- Yes.

1399
01:41:40,732 --> 01:41:41,864
What kind of a joke is this?

1400
01:41:44,578 --> 01:41:45,897
Where are his signatures?

1401
01:41:46,288 --> 01:41:48,202
Your finger is bleeding.

1402
01:42:14,805 --> 01:42:16,834
Saurav! Saurav! Saurav!

1403
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:18,743
Saurav! What's wrong?

1404
01:42:18,874 --> 01:42:20,855
Saurav! Are you okay?

1405
01:42:21,241 --> 01:42:23,233
Saurav! Are you okay?
Saurav! Saurav!

1406
01:42:23,391 --> 01:42:24,942
What did you do to him?

1407
01:42:25,073 --> 01:42:26,992
Saurav! Saurav!

1408
01:42:27,123 --> 01:42:28,752
Saurav! My dear Saurav!

1409
01:42:28,979 --> 01:42:30,060
Saurav!

1410
01:42:30,784 --> 01:42:31,551
Saurav!

1411
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:32,953
Saurav, are you okay?

1412
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,700
Saurav! Saurav!

1413
01:42:34,831 --> 01:42:38,332
Mr. Dixit,
he'll be dead in an hour.

1414
01:42:38,965 --> 01:42:40,899
By the time,
you take him to the hospital

1415
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:44,948
they conduct the tests
and give him an antidote

1416
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:46,988
it'll be too late.

1417
01:42:50,075 --> 01:42:51,179
So what do we do?

1418
01:42:53,776 --> 01:42:56,560
There's one way.
- Yes.

1419
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:00,866
If I tell you
what poison it is.

1420
01:43:00,996 --> 01:43:02,524
Tell me! Tell me!

1421
01:43:03,365 --> 01:43:05,694
But for that,
without wasting his time

1422
01:43:05,825 --> 01:43:09,617
you must right away
handover all the evidence

1423
01:43:09,746 --> 01:43:11,503
of Aditya's innocence.

1424
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:15,224
Come on, be quick for his sake.

1425
01:43:16,183 --> 01:43:17,692
Saurav, just be there.

1426
01:43:17,823 --> 01:43:19,142
Saurav, just be there.

1427
01:43:22,469 --> 01:43:23,472
Here.

1428
01:43:23,782 --> 01:43:24,981
Tell me the name.

1429
01:43:28,191 --> 01:43:29,130
Saurav! Saurav!

1430
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:30,130
Saurav!

1431
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:31,459
Tell me the name.

1432
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:34,460
Saurav! Saurav!
You'll be all right.

1433
01:43:34,847 --> 01:43:36,026
Belladonna.

1434
01:43:37,701 --> 01:43:39,848
Saurav. You'll be all right.

1435
01:43:39,978 --> 01:43:42,266
Saurav! Saurav!

1436
01:43:54,252 --> 01:43:55,455
Mr. Dixit.

1437
01:43:56,176 --> 01:43:57,255
Mr. Dixit.

1438
01:43:57,768 --> 01:43:59,334
Yes, doctor.

1439
01:44:00,134 --> 01:44:03,004
We've given Mr. Singhania
the antidote.

1440
01:44:03,134 --> 01:44:05,763
But for the next 12 hours
I can't promise anything.

1441
01:44:05,894 --> 01:44:07,205
Anything is possible.

1442
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:10,216
And we don't know whether
it has affected any organ.

1443
01:44:10,508 --> 01:44:12,092
Only time can tell.

1444
01:44:13,788 --> 01:44:14,858
Don't worry.

1445
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:26,130
'The air pressure over the
Arabian sea is decreasing.'

1446
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:28,839
'Due to which the
weather is changing.'

1447
01:44:28,969 --> 01:44:30,798
'If we talk about North India'

1448
01:44:30,928 --> 01:44:32,854
'entire Northern
region of India'

1449
01:44:32,984 --> 01:44:34,677
'has been impacted
by cold waves as we speak.'

1450
01:44:34,808 --> 01:44:36,918
'Due to heavy
snowfalls in Srinagar'

1451
01:44:37,048 --> 01:44:41,166
'the temperature has dipped
below minus 3 degrees.'

1452
01:44:42,092 --> 01:44:44,756
'Breaking News of the hour is'

1453
01:44:44,887 --> 01:44:47,731
'that Kaaya Sharma's
real murderer has been found.'

1454
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,045
'The police recently recovered'

1455
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,795
'the body of a man called
Manish Surve from a van'

1456
01:44:52,925 --> 01:44:54,794
'parked outside a farmhouse.'

1457
01:44:54,924 --> 01:44:57,684
'The police have also stated
that this is a suicide case.'

1458
01:44:57,814 --> 01:45:00,237
'Police have also found
some love-letters'

1459
01:45:00,366 --> 01:45:01,433
'and photographs
from Manish's home'

1460
01:45:01,563 --> 01:45:03,513
'which he wrote to Kaaya.'

1461
01:45:03,643 --> 01:45:05,792
'The police have also said'

1462
01:45:05,923 --> 01:45:08,233
'that these pictures
and love-letters prove that'

1463
01:45:08,361 --> 01:45:10,391
'Manish Surve was
a silent lover.'

1464
01:45:10,522 --> 01:45:13,232
'And his obsession was the
motive behind Kaaya's murder.'

1465
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,990
Mr. Diwan, now that you've
been acquitted, how do you feel?

1466
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:18,758
Do you know who was
trying to set you up?

1467
01:45:19,749 --> 01:45:23,191
All I know is that I had full
faith in the judicial system.

1468
01:45:23,593 --> 01:45:26,349
And I am happy that the
truth is before the world.

1469
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:28,887
And everyone knows
I am innocent.

1470
01:45:29,457 --> 01:45:30,907
Thank you.
- Sir, sir.. one more question.

1471
01:45:31,037 --> 01:45:32,170
Sir.
- Sir, please sir.

1472
01:45:42,815 --> 01:45:43,933
Yes.

1473
01:45:45,078 --> 01:45:46,196
Yes.

1474
01:45:47,302 --> 01:45:49,914
Right now,
all we can do is wait.

1475
01:45:50,573 --> 01:45:52,413
The doctor's said that
anything is possible.

1476
01:45:52,542 --> 01:45:55,692
Sir, Mr. Singhania
is not in his room. - What?

1477
01:46:16,299 --> 01:46:18,688
Welcome back, sir.
- Thank you.

1478
01:46:20,789 --> 01:46:22,515
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

1479
01:46:41,612 --> 01:46:44,663
Vaswani, was it so important
to come here today?

1480
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:47,906
Bringing me to a place like this
right after I got out of jail.

1481
01:46:48,729 --> 01:46:51,214
Sir, this project was
on hold for a long time.

1482
01:46:51,342 --> 01:46:53,613
And we've invested
lot of money in it.

1483
01:46:53,743 --> 01:46:55,332
I thought why don't I
take final approval from you

1484
01:46:55,462 --> 01:46:57,462
and start it again.
- Okay.

1485
01:46:58,457 --> 01:47:00,519
Sir, I'll get the blueprint.

1486
01:47:24,547 --> 01:47:25,286
Within two weeks

1487
01:47:25,417 --> 01:47:27,259
Aditya group of company's
should have a clean image

1488
01:47:27,388 --> 01:47:28,885
before the world.

1489
01:47:29,015 --> 01:47:31,335
Yes, we can't afford
to waste any more time now.

1490
01:47:31,465 --> 01:47:34,027
Don't worry, we've already
prepared a strategy.

1491
01:47:44,271 --> 01:47:46,004
This is the only way
to cover our losses.

1492
01:47:46,133 --> 01:47:48,842
We have all the reports..
- Sir, your lives are in danger.

1493
01:47:48,972 --> 01:47:50,892
We must leave immediately.
- What's wrong?

1494
01:47:51,023 --> 01:47:52,162
Saurav's here.

1495
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:54,490
We have to leave immediately.
Let's go.

1496
01:48:03,514 --> 01:48:04,240
Oh, Gosh!

1497
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:06,729
What happened?
- Run! Hurry up.

1498
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:08,048
Come on.

1499
01:49:27,635 --> 01:49:29,006
I am sorry, Vikram.

1500
01:49:30,894 --> 01:49:32,322
I am really sorry.

1501
01:49:34,874 --> 01:49:37,200
This was entirely Aditya's plan,
not mine.

1502
01:49:37,991 --> 01:49:40,096
I let Aditya talk me into it.

1503
01:49:42,223 --> 01:49:45,389
Please give me a chance
to prove that I still love you.

1504
01:49:46,974 --> 01:49:48,269
I was right.

1505
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,309
You were always cheap
and you still are.

1506
01:49:53,073 --> 01:49:54,588
Please believe me, Vikram.

1507
01:49:55,747 --> 01:49:57,260
I'll give you anything you want.

1508
01:49:57,389 --> 01:49:58,459
Whatever.

1509
01:49:59,318 --> 01:50:02,464
I've realized Aditya
can't belong to anyone.

1510
01:50:05,711 --> 01:50:06,841
I am sorry.

1511
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:14,746
Really?

1512
01:50:15,832 --> 01:50:17,114
Let's hear your offer.

1513
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:21,740
My offer is behind you!

1514
01:50:32,850 --> 01:50:35,023
There's no difference
between you and me.

1515
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:38,000
Whatever I did,
it was for the money

1516
01:50:39,006 --> 01:50:40,600
and now you're doing the same.

1517
01:50:54,118 --> 01:50:55,298
There's a difference.

1518
01:50:56,366 --> 01:50:58,296
Your built castles
in the air

1519
01:50:59,296 --> 01:51:00,871
and mine dream was
firmly on the ground.

1520
01:51:57,804 --> 01:52:00,595
I'd cry silently than I'd smile.

1521
01:52:00,726 --> 01:52:02,622
I hated you!

1522
01:52:12,369 --> 01:52:13,553
What's strange is that

1523
01:52:13,684 --> 01:52:16,353
how did you survive
after killing you twice?

1524
01:52:16,921 --> 01:52:20,512
But I think God will
fulfill my desire today.

1525
01:53:31,568 --> 01:53:33,947
You kept praying to God
for my death

1526
01:53:36,348 --> 01:53:37,880
and I kept praying
for yours.

1527
01:53:46,564 --> 01:53:50,105
Now you'll know how it feels
when your loved one cheats you

1528
01:53:52,105 --> 01:53:54,825
and deserts you.

1529
01:54:42,890 --> 01:54:45,615
You never tried to understand
your elder brother.

1530
01:54:56,749 --> 01:54:58,587
You could've just said it once

1531
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:03,112
and he would've happily
given you everything.

1532
01:55:04,824 --> 01:55:07,210
He would've given me everything?

1533
01:55:11,727 --> 01:55:12,930
Then who are you?

1534
01:55:14,452 --> 01:55:15,279
Who are you?

1535
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:18,341
I regret you'll never know
this secret in this life.

1536
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:50,168
Saurav! Saurav! Saurav!

1537
01:55:50,564 --> 01:55:51,633
Saurav!

1538
01:55:51,763 --> 01:55:54,136
Saurav! Are you okay?
Saurav! Saurav!

1539
01:56:14,376 --> 01:56:16,309
Karan is conscious.

1540
01:56:17,698 --> 01:56:18,938
He's going to live.

1541
01:56:25,379 --> 01:56:26,665
'The game has begun.'

1542
01:56:26,795 --> 01:56:28,985
'Saurav has entrapped Kaaya.'

1543
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:30,209
'Kaaya is dead.'

1544
01:56:39,073 --> 01:56:40,783
'Vikram had a friend
named Karan.'

1545
01:56:40,913 --> 01:56:43,503
'Vikram would spend time
with him and play with him.'

1546
01:56:44,577 --> 01:56:46,172
'He had a problem
with his liver.'

1547
01:56:48,975 --> 01:56:50,422
'Vikram didn't even hesitate'

1548
01:56:50,552 --> 01:56:54,671
'before deciding to
donate half of his liver.'

1549
01:56:56,189 --> 01:56:59,406
Karan my friend,
so finally you took my advice.

1550
01:57:00,442 --> 01:57:01,451
Yes, I thought

1551
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:04,499
I'd personally invite
my best friend to my wedding.

1552
01:57:04,629 --> 01:57:05,979
You're getting married. When?

1553
01:57:06,109 --> 01:57:07,217
Soon.

1554
01:57:07,348 --> 01:57:08,859
And you can meet Siya
under that pretext.

1555
01:57:08,988 --> 01:57:10,897
That's great news, man.
Congratulations.

1556
01:57:11,027 --> 01:57:12,417
And please congratulate
Siya also for me.

1557
01:57:12,547 --> 01:57:13,377
Definitely I will.

1558
01:57:13,507 --> 01:57:15,018
Anyway, let's talk
when we meet.

1559
01:57:15,147 --> 01:57:17,651
Okay, see you soon.
- I'll see you at the airport.

1560
01:57:27,183 --> 01:57:29,344
I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

1561
01:57:52,238 --> 01:57:53,933
7.
- Yes.

1562
01:57:54,474 --> 01:57:56,299
1
- Yes, Yes.

1563
01:57:56,579 --> 01:57:57,929
5
- Yes.

1564
01:57:58,058 --> 01:58:00,873
54..

1565
01:58:13,843 --> 01:58:14,954
Aditya!

1566
01:58:16,759 --> 01:58:17,960
Siya..

1567
01:58:31,965 --> 01:58:33,249
I promise

1568
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:37,333
I'll take back everything

1569
01:58:40,862 --> 01:58:42,743
they snatched from you.

1570
01:58:45,634 --> 01:58:46,875
I promise.

1571
01:58:50,834 --> 01:58:52,153
I promise!

1572
01:59:08,526 --> 01:59:10,245
What if you had been harmed?

1573
01:59:10,879 --> 01:59:12,043
I would've died.

1574
01:59:15,321 --> 01:59:17,235
You gave me this life.

1575
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:19,168
You proved one thing.

1576
01:59:21,914 --> 01:59:25,139
Blood ties are not
the only relation.

1577
01:59:26,475 --> 01:59:28,152
The real relation is of pain.

1578
01:59:30,322 --> 01:59:32,952
It's easy to be called brother

1579
01:59:34,812 --> 01:59:38,280
but difficult to be one.

1580
01:59:41,581 --> 01:59:43,919
You're my real brother.

1581
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:47,497
You're my real brother.

1582
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:50,886
You're my real brother.

1583
02:00:36,025 --> 02:00:45,100
"I'm obsessed
to make you mine."

1584
02:00:45,588 --> 02:00:47,778
