1
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:24,900
Why is he following me?

2
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:13,946
Start quickly. Let us go from here.

3
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:16,078
Why did you get in? l invited
trouble to save you.

4
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,148
Please save me! O God! O God!

5
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:26,755
You look like den boss. Are
you an underworld person?

6
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:30,768
No. l am an ordinary business
man. l came for jogging.

7
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,167
Then why is he shooting you?

8
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,240
l too don't understand that.
Why is he shooting me?

9
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,241
Why are you asking me?
You should know that.

10
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,583
l pray to you. Please get down.

11
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:50,583
l pray to you. Please save me.

12
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,925
Get out of the vehicle! Get down!

13
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:06,196
l thought that you would save me.
Why did you throw me out?

14
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:08,205
l threw you out to save you.
Go to that house.

15
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:09,604
Then you will be safe.

16
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:27,825
Greetings, seth! - Welcome!
Do you want to have some tea?

17
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:36,158
Who are you?

18
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,966
ls it necessary to know that?
Do you have any heart problem?

19
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,632
No. - Then l can tell you.
We kidnapped you.

20
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,641
Kidnap!? - Kidnap means
we capture some person..

21
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:51,115
..make a call to his family
members and demand money.

22
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:52,650
That's the story.

23
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:54,242
Mr. Jagadiswara Rao! ls that you?

24
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:55,650
Yes, it's him.

25
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:58,815
Stop talking now and make a call
to your house. Ask for two lakhs.

26
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,261
Why are you here, you idiot?

27
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:03,988
Hey, ATM! What did l tell you?

28
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,664
l told you just to scare
him with that revolver.

29
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,199
But why did you chase
us shooting with it?

30
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:09,666
What if the bullet hits anybody?

31
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,862
Why are you worried? These
are dummy bullets.

32
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:13,131
They will not harm anyone.

33
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,673
Hey! Where are you going? Though
they are dummy bullets..

34
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:22,737
..if l shoot you from this range
your head will blow off.

35
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,749
Are all of you belongs
to the same gang?

36
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,752
Yes. We are all social workers.
We help public.

37
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:30,685
You have to pay him two lakhs.
Pay him in front of us..

38
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,351
..and then go home. The
story will be over.

39
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:38,696
Mr. Jagadiswara Rao! ls
this proper for you?

40
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,288
You told me to give that
money to Pandudada.

41
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,423
l gave him.

42
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,695
But he took half the amount
as his commission.

43
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:45,703
Who will pay that money? Do
you think l will leave you?

44
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:47,898
What do you think of me? Don't
try to play with me.

45
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,031
Stop it.

46
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:52,872
Did you meet Pandudada
before coming to me?

47
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:54,971
Actually..
- Yes, he met.

48
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,912
l gave the money when
he threatened me.

49
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,711
My father always says
not to cheat anyone..

50
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,911
..and don't tolerate if
you see anyone cheating.

51
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,322
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
- l am tightening my pants.

52
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,722
Okay.

53
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,322
Meeting Pandudada is
your first mistake.

54
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,922
Hiding that from me is
your second mistake.

55
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,057
Mistake means..

56
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:18,733
Hey, ATM!
- Yes! - How much are two times two?

57
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:20,203
Five!
- lsn't it four?

58
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,330
Our calculation will
be like that only.

59
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,931
Make a call to your home and ask
your wife to bring five lakhs.

60
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,944
lf she asks why tell her
that you were kidnapped.

61
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:34,743
Kidnap!?
- Bye, brother! - Sorry, brother.

62
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:36,219
But don't spare that idiot.

63
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:40,759
l will not leave him. l will
kill him. You can go.

64
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,953
Hey! Come on, make the call.

65
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,825
Otherwise your wife
will become a widow.

66
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:49,766
My name is ATM. That means
any time murder.

67
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:53,028
Hey, dish! - Yes! - What will you
get by inserting card at ATM?

68
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,231
We get money.

69
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,240
What will come out if l
stab him in the stomach?

70
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:57,366
His intestines will come out.

71
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:59,774
Did you understand? Come
on ring it. - Come on!

72
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,971
He is calling.

Why did you come here again?

79
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,402
Pandudada's men are here.

80
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:42,150
Did you make the call?
l will not leave you.

81
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:43,881
Take out the weapons.

82
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:49,294
Hey, who will open the door?
- l am sorry, boss.

83
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:54,298
Open it. Close it now.

84
00:06:55,034 --> 00:07:00,836
Alas! My hand! My hand!
- Sorry, boss. Please forgive me.

85
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,841
Who told me that Pandudada
came here?

86
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:04,967
Actually..

87
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,839
Don't you know my level? Me

88

Hey! Do we need brother to

89
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,174
Are you too slapping me?

90
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:13,842
Don't worry, brother. We can
take care of them. Go inside.

91
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:17,320
Hey! No need to stop your work.

Give me single tea.

00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:09,231
He hit me there again.

97
00:08:30,362 --> 00:08:31,920
Hey! Take him to the hospital first.

98
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,123
Hey! Do that first.

He is finished.

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,894
My son too run away from
home and came here.

172
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,228
But he didn't become
a thief like you.

173
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,626
He studied hard and became
a doctor. Come on.

174
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,562
This is what l was feared of.

175
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,432
Sarcoma loco of the intestine!

176
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:46,374
What does that mean, sir?

177
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,839
l know just a few words.

178
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:50,771
Don't confuse me with
your questions.

179
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,518
l will kill you.

180
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:56,384
Doctor! My son ate the pen.
What should l do?

181
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,422
Ask him to write with pencil.
Go now. - Okay, sir.

182
00:13:58,557 --> 00:13:59,649
Who gave her training?

183
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:00,782
Please come.

184
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,918
Sister! Do you need me for this?
You should manage it.

185
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,524
Mother! Father!

186
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,795
What is this, doctor? Why didn't
you tell me that they are coming?

187
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:12,461
Since you are very busy
we received them.

188
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:15,665
Thank you, doctor. How
are you, mother?

189
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:17,469
We are fine. How are you?

190
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:19,271
l am very happy, mother.

191
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:22,279
He says like that. But 24 hours
he thinks only of patients.

192
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:24,607
He doesn't remove the stethoscope
while sleeping also.

193
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:28,749
lsn't it? - Doctor, l think..
- l exaggerated it. lsn't it?

194
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:31,288
l too felt that.
- Thank you very much.

195
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,688
My child! He is injured. Treat him.
- Okay, father.

196
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:44,901
Are you Shankar..

197
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:49,463
My God! He is very serious.
Take him in immediately.

198
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,902
Doctor! l will take care of him.
- Okay.

199
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,443
What were you about to say? Rascal!

200
00:14:56,548 --> 00:14:58,982
No need to worry now. Malhotra
is a nice doctor.

201
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:00,450
He will take care of him.

202
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:02,247
l think you might be very tired.
Go inside and take rest.

203
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,845
Rest! Your father's health
is not well these days.

204
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:06,447
Then let us take him
to a good doctor.

205
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:07,582
Yes, you are right.

206
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,752
What is the need for that
when you are there?

207
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:16,799
Actually, father.. son treating
father means.. it's not..

208
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:18,335
Then why did you become a doctor?

209
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:19,734
But you didn't make him a doctor.

210
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:22,804
He means that l took
it as a challenge..

211
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:23,932
The doctor took it as a challenge..

212
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,270
..and with my efforts.
- With his own efforts..

213
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,277
..l myself.. - ..he himself..
- ..became a doctor.

214
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,403
Thank you, doctor.

215
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:31,540
How dare you try to reveal
Shankardada's identity?

216
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:34,281
What happened?
- They are beating.

217
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:38,345
No, mother. They are stitching. lt
pains a little while stitching.

218
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,481
That is why he is shouting.

219
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:40,683
Go and take rest.

220
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:44,489
l brought five lakhs. l pray to you.

221
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:45,824
Please release my husband.

222
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,296
Should l finish her?

223
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:52,296
Look here, madam. lf you think
that money can save life..

224
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:54,770
..then the rich people
will never die.

225
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,500
Don't worry about your husband.

226
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,838
Doctor Madhusudan! Please
take care of that case.

227
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:00,309
Thank you.
- Come on, sister-in-law.

228
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:03,904
Sister-in-law!? - Yes. l will
explain you if you come with me.

229
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,776
Go. God is there to save everyone.

230
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,513
And these doctors are
there to treat him.

231
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,782
Your husband will be safe. Go.

232
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,592
What happened to her husband?

233
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:18,390
He got excess of cholesterol.
We cut and removed it.

234
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:21,658
Did you bring the full amount?

235
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,598
Yes, l did. Where is my husband?

236
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:25,329
Don't worry. Go and sit in the car.

237
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:26,495
He will come in two minutes.

238
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:27,833
l will finish him if he
tries to act over smart.

239
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:32,335
Hey, rascal! lf l see you here
again, l will kill you.

240
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:36,476
The lives of so many people
are in your hands.

241
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:37,742
Take care of them.

242
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:41,341
Okay.
- Greetings, sir. - Greetings.

243
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:47,355
l saw you here when l came
here last time also.

244
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,359
Didn't your legs cure yet?

245
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:51,495
He got paralysis. They cannot
be cured so quickly.

246
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:52,621
Please come on.

247
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:56,363
Uncle! Uncle! - l am alright.
l was slipped. Thank you.

248
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,867
lt's alright.

249
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:14,379
Wonderful! This is really wonderful!

250
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:16,716
Father did something which
l couldn't do as a doctor.

251
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:18,380
Father! My teachers told
me that sometimes..

252
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,516
..people regain their limbs
in situations like this.

253
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:24,721
ls that so? - Yeah! Brain syndrome
of neurological synthesis.

254
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,388
ln this happiness l will climb
the trees, hills and..

255
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:29,399
..roam around the world by foot.

256
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,729
l got my legs back.

257
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:33,737
You shouldn't jump like that.
You got them just now.

258
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,397
l still have to do some work.

259
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:36,872
Father! You go upstairs.

260
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,602
Uncle! Please stay here.
- Let them go.

261
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,407
Uncle! Please stay here.
Uncle! Uncle!

262
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,482
Hey! Bash him up without
making any noise.

263
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:51,415
Hey, you got the gate
pass. Come on now.

264
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:53,423
What's all this? What
is happening here?

265
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:54,549
l don't understand anything.

266
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,423
You cannot understand also.
This is a big story. Come on.

267
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:05,762
Whatever you may say l
don't like this drama.

268
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:07,498
You should have told them
the truth a long time ago.

269
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,437
l tried many times to tell them.
ln the beginning..

270
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,839
..l was afraid that
he might scold me.

271
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,969
But now l am afraid that the
truth might hurt them badly.

272
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,447
What are you saying? l feel
that you should say. - No.

273
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,448
They stay with us just for
one week every year.

274
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,450
Though we are lying to
them this one week..

275
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:25,989
..it gives them enough joy to spend
the rest of the year happily.

276
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,524
That is enough for me.

277
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:28,921
How long can we continue this?

278
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:30,654
Why don't you tell them
the truth at least now?

279
00:18:30,762 --> 00:18:31,786
Then the problem will be cleared.

280
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:45,800
Shankar! What are you thinking?

281
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:47,872
Nothing, mother.

282
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,003
Come here.

283
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:56,645
Mother! l feel very happy
when you hold me like this.

284
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,488
ln my childhood when l used to
cry that father slapped me..

285
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:04,653
..you used to hold me like this.
All my pain used to go away.

286
00:19:05,864 --> 00:19:08,560
What do you used to say then?

287
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,897
Jantar Mantar Choo Mantrakali!

288
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:12,697
All the pain should go away.

289
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:17,507
lf we hold affectionately
someone who is in pain..

290
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,510
..their pain will lessen.

291
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:23,571
That's true. Correct!

292
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,978
Shankar! Stand up once.

293
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:30,520
What for, mother?
- Come here.

294
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:38,723
Now tell me why you are worried.

295
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:42,526
Mother! What if l am not a doctor?

296
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,997
What are you saying? Don't
say that even for fun.

297
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:48,937
We cannot tolerate that.
Do you understand?

298
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:08,715
Greetings, sir!
- Greetings! Who are they?

299
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,556
They are some mad fellows.
Why to bother about them?

300
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:13,563
Do you want to have coconut water?

301
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:14,962
Give me one which has coconut in it.

302
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:17,034
Okay, sir.
- How much is it?

303
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:18,568
Give me a coconut.

304
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,898
lf you want to have only water
it is seven rupees..

305
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:21,563
..if you want coconut in that,
then it is ten rupees.

306
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:29,103
Excuse me! l think
l saw you earlier.

307
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:32,181
Yes, you did Dr.Ramalingeswara Rao.

308
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:35,048
Though you forgot me
l didn't forget you.

309
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:41,091
You are Mr. Satya Prasad.
- That's correct.

310
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:45,251
O my goodness! lt has been
very long since l met you.

311
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:46,591
Such a long time!

312
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,060
How are you?

313
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,860
Do you know each other, sir?

314
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,667
He was first doctor when a hospital
was built in our village.

315
00:20:56,908 --> 00:21:00,776
He worked there for five years.
Are you thinking why l am here?

316
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,880
My son Shankar Prasad started
a hospital here.

317
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,609
He named it after me.

318
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:10,286
ls there a hospital in this
area that l don't know?

319
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:12,687
What's the rule that you
should know everything?

320
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,622
Which coconut do you want?

321
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:17,160
One minute! Did your Shankar
become a doctor?

322
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,627
Do you remember l used
to say in those days..

323
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:23,826
..that my son too will become
a doctor like you?

324
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:26,233
Yes, sir. He became
a doctor as you said.

325
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,102
lt is not a lie. Tell me which
coconut you want, sir.

326
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:31,903
One minute! Didn't l tell
you to wait? Wait!

327
00:21:32,077 --> 00:21:34,637
This is very surprising. l don't
know that your son's hospital..

328
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,044
..is there near my house.

329
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:38,638
What if you don't know that, sir?

330
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,650
Tell me which coconut you want.

331
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:44,654
Shut up! Okay? Come on,
my house is nearby.

332
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:45,848
Let us talk on the way.

333
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:52,660
l don't understand something. l
know all the doctors in this area.

334
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:53,992
ln them your son..

335
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:55,657
Why don't you take
some bananas, sir?

336
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:08,175
Why do you laugh for everything?

337
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,142
This is called laughter therapy.

338
00:22:11,883 --> 00:22:14,681
When we are much tensed we should
laugh loudly like this.

339
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:17,687
Then the blood pleasure will
come down automatically.

340
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:23,084
That is why whenever l get
angry l laugh loudly.

341
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:25,886
Please sit down. Bring a tea.

342
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:27,021
Greetings, sir!

343
00:22:32,904 --> 00:22:34,769
ln which college did your
Shankar study MBBS?

344
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,706
l don't know. He ran away from
the house in childhood.

345
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,379
But after coming here he became
a doctor as l wished.

346
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,781
Fortune always smiles
at good people.

347
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:51,988
How is your daughter Chitti?

348
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,718
She is fine. She too
became a doctor.

349
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:58,259
ls she married?

350
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:00,729
No. l am searching for the groom.

351
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:09,399
l know a doctor. Chitti knows
him from her childhood.

352
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:15,277
l have his photo with
me too. How is he?

353
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,746
Why are you laughing?
Are you laughing..

354
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:24,754
..thinking that my son is
handsome or with tension?

355
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,959
No! No! l liked your son.
That is why l am laughing.

356
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:30,027
l shall decide just now. Chitti!

357
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:38,968
Come, my child!
- Yes, daddy.

358
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,437
Mr. Satya Prasad!
- Greetings, uncle.

359
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,034
Did you recognize him?

360
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:46,835
We used to be in their neighborhood
in Bhuvanagiri.

361
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,944
Chitti! Take a look at this photo.

362
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:56,848
Both of you used to play
marbles together.

363
00:23:56,955 --> 00:24:02,257
And steal guavas. He is the
one who taught you swimming.

364
00:24:02,427 --> 00:24:06,796
Shankar!? That means you are..

365
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:09,128
Sorry, uncle. l couldn't
recognize you.

366
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:12,792
Are aunty and Shankar fine?

367
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:13,962
Yes, they are.

368
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:17,199
Okay. Sunita! Coming to
the point straight.

369
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,206
lf you like then Shankar will
become my son-in-law.

370
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:26,313
Dad! - Yes, my baby. l will settle
the marriage only if you agree.

371
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,830
''Hold my hand''

372
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:46,898

373
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:56,308
''Hold my hand''

374
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,041

''Kiss my cheeks and make them blush''

380
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,870
''Or it is an oath on me''

381
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:24,075
''l will wink at you till
you melt with shyness''

382
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:26,871
''Depend on me to do this''

383
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:30,070
''O God, don't titillate me so much''

384
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:33,548
''Come to me O colorful bird''

00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:42,366
''You are letting your beauty

414
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:45,033
''How can l hold myself back now''

415
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:47,174
''You want me to stop my games''

416
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:48,506
''You come to me late in the day''

417
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:51,639
''Now you should come only
when l have the mood''

418
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:55,185
''O golden doll, how can l stay
away from you that long''

419
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:58,050

''Come to me dressed as a groom''

423
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:12,397
''l shall serve you my
youth in a platter''

424
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:14,535
''Hold my hand''

425
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,266
''Tie the knot with this beauty''

426
00:29:16,374 --> 00:29:19,070
''Hide me in your heart, O young man''

427
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,201
''Wear the saree''

428
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:23,007
''You are not alone anymore''

429
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:25,548
''Color your lips, O young lady''

430
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:38,218
Marriage!? l won't marry.

431
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:41,360
There are many problems for that.

432
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:45,297
Okay. Come on, Mahalaxmi.
- Where to? - Back to village.

433
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:48,236
Village.. - There sons do not
speak against their parents.

434
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,373
What is this, mother?
Why don't you tell him?

435
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:57,237
What's wrong in what he said?
l have only one desire.

436
00:29:57,348 --> 00:29:59,248
Before l die l want to play
with your children.

437
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,787
lt seems that it will
not happen. Let it be.

438
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:06,519
l will die without fulfilling
that desire.

439
00:30:06,624 --> 00:30:09,388
Sit down! Why do you talk
meaninglessly, mother?

440
00:30:09,494 --> 00:30:11,052
What are you saying?

441
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:18,064
Look Mr. Madhusudan! l am
talking to you, doctor.

442
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:22,068
Why don't you tell them?

443
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:26,471
Yes, uncle. Since Shankar
is a doctor..

444
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,546
..he spends all the day in the
hospital. He doesn't have time.

445
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:33,083
How can he marry? Sister-in-law
will be bored.

446
00:30:36,287 --> 00:30:38,152
Normal girls cannot understand
his feelings.

447
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:41,281
lf sister-in-law too is a doctor,
she will understand his feelings.

448
00:30:41,392 --> 00:30:43,087
They will become a good couple.

449
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:46,094
He said exactly the same
thing l wanted to say.

450
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:54,301
Why are you laughing, father? Tell
me why you both are laughing?

451
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:55,497
l expected that you
will say this thing.

452
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:57,096
That is why we selected
a doctor for you.

453
00:30:57,308 --> 00:30:59,105
They brought a doctor
for you, doctor.

454
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:01,603
l understood it, doctor.

455
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:07,710
Dr.Madhusudhan! You gave
a wonderful idea. Thanks!

456
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:12,448
l unnecessarily trapped my friend.

457
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,322
Where did you get
this match, father?

458
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:19,122
The girl is Chitti.
- Who is Chitti?

459
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:24,795
Guess!
- ls that fat Chitti?

460
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:31,301
Chitti! Shankar called you.

461
00:31:31,442 --> 00:31:33,535
Chitti! Shankar's phone.

462
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:35,611
Shankar?
- Yes, talk to him.

463
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:39,675
Dad, don't mind.
- l don't mind. Talk. - Dad!

464
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,155
Hello!
- Hello, Chitti! ls that you?

465
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:48,157
Good morning, doctor. lt
seems that you wake up..

466
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:49,556
..earlier than l do.

467
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:53,159
Not early! l didn't
sleep last night.

468
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:55,289
Why? Was there any emergency?

469
00:31:55,466 --> 00:32:00,165
Not an ordinary one. lt
may blow out my fuse.

470
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:02,364
Hey, Shankar! Why are
you talking like that?

471
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:03,667
This is the way l always talk.

472
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:07,710
Okay, l too will talk
like that. Now tell me.

473
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,769
l heard that you became
a big doctor.

474
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:11,246
How much fees are you collecting?

475
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:14,508
What fees? Chitti!
l am not a doctor.

476
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:17,516
l know.
- What do you mean?

477
00:32:17,622 --> 00:32:19,647
You used to be like a rowdy
in your childhood.

478
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:21,247
You are talking like one now.

479
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:25,521
No. Now l got promotion.
l am a social worker.

480
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,188
That means l will organize the
meetings, settle the issues..

481
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:29,732
..and collect money from the
people. Did you understand?

482
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,597
Shankar! What is this?

483
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:33,397
Do you talk with patients
too in this manner?

484
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:38,266
Damn..! Chitti! What
l am telling is true.

485
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:40,469
l don't have any patients
and l am not a doctor.

486
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:42,469
Please believe me.

487
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:46,409
Chitti! l don't have time to
tell my entire story to you.

488
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:48,542
When l come to your house
tell your father that..

489
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:50,746
..you didn't like me or l am
not suitable for you. Okay?

490
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:54,220
Another important thing. My
father shouldn't know..

491
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,623
..the things that l told
you about myself.

492
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,355
He cannot bear the truth.
Okay? Please!

493
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:02,432
Shankar! What are you talking about?

494
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:07,232
Try to understand, Chitti.
l am telling you the truth.

495
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:09,636
Listen. You didn't like me.

496
00:33:09,774 --> 00:33:15,235
And my father shouldn't know
this matter. Please! Okay?

497
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:16,506
Shankar!
- See you, bye!

498
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:21,247
Use those tablets three times a
day. You will be alright. Okay?

499
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:22,509
Please come, father.

500
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:26,647
Hello! Hello!

501
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:31,518
Wear this dress. You mother
specially got stitched it for you.

502
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:36,659
Very shy guy!

503
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,928
Yes. lt is very nice, father.

504
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:42,795
Come on, Chitti! l am ready.
You are late. Come on.

505
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:49,945
Why are you looking at it like that?

506
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,541
Do you have to collect
money from anyone?

507
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,878
Collect money?
- Do you want to kidnap anyone?

508
00:33:58,522 --> 00:34:02,288
Kidnap!? - Or else do you want
to break the limbs of anyone?

509
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:04,552
Hey, Laxmi! What are
you talking about?

510
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:07,464
Then why is his photo here?

511
00:34:07,832 --> 00:34:10,892
He is the person who is
going to marry Chitti.

512
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:14,833
O my God! Marriage with Shankardada?

513
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:29,313
Daddy! What happened?

514
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:33,854
You go to the hospital.

515
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:36,986
To the hospital? But you said
that Shankar is coming.

516
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:42,522
l forgot to tell you. They
are not coming today.

517
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:44,533
They called me that they
will come next week.

518
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:49,798
You go. You are getting
late now. Go!

519
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:51,340
l will follow you later. Okay?

520
00:34:51,642 --> 00:34:53,610
Okay, dad. Bye!

521
00:34:58,716 --> 00:35:02,015
Wow! You are looking wonderful!

522
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,746
Your face is shining
like that of a groom.

523
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:05,617
You look fantastic!
- That's true.

524
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:07,884
l am already tensed. Do one thing.

525
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,619
After l reach there call me
after every five minutes.

526
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:13,356
Tell me that it is urgent
that l come here.

527
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:15,360
lf l cannot come from there
within twenty minutes..

528
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:16,694
..play some drama and bring me here.

529
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:18,359
Don't worry. l am here.

530
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:19,900
l was telling your dialog.

531
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,369
What are you talking about?

532
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:23,904
Nothing, father. l am telling them
to take care of the hospital.

533
00:35:24,008 --> 00:35:25,703
Hospital and patients
will not go anywhere.

534
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,573
Why don't you come with us?

535
00:35:27,745 --> 00:35:29,713
How can he come, madam? He has to
call after every five minutes.

536
00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:31,775
Phone? What phone?

537
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,641
What phone? lsn't it fan?

538
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:36,447
l said fan only.
- Father thought it as phone.

539
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:38,054
The fan in the out patient
ward must get repaired.

540
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:39,520
You must go now, uncle.

541
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:42,786
l will die if you hit me, boss.

542
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:43,985
Be careful!

543
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:03,578
Didn't l tell you? Laughter therapy.

544
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:11,677
Shankar! ln which college
did you do your MBBS?

545
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:16,957
l mean doctor course.

546
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:21,689
Osmania medical college!

547
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:24,760
Osmania! Good!

548
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,095
ln what did you do your
specialization?

549
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:36,443
ls it hands, legs, bones or neck?

550
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:44,052
Are you alright? Don't worry at all.

551
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:47,916
Give him glucose immediately.
Call me if it is very urgent.

552
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:49,458
l will come there immediately.

553
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,529
ls there anything wrong? Why
is he talking about glucose?

554
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,630
Your father proudly said
that you became a doctor.

555
00:36:57,835 --> 00:37:01,464
l think you too are very
proud to be a doctor.

556
00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:03,935
What is there to feel
proud about this?

557
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:09,474
Are you ashamed if not proud,
Dr. Shankar Prasad?

558
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:13,812
Please! -

559
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:26,155
Talk to me. Answer! Come on!

560
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,693
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

561
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:32,666
ls there something wrong? Hey, dish!

562
00:37:32,803 --> 00:37:36,170
Your parents are very happy
that you became doctor.

563
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:41,166
Don't you feel guilty on
seeing that, Shankardada?

564
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:51,714
Come on, father. l think he
doesn't like this match.

565
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:54,723
What? Don't l like this match?

566
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:57,583
lf so don't you know the reason?

567
00:37:57,962 --> 00:38:02,524
My daughter is a doctor. Do
you know what doctor is?

568
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:06,533
Do you know what respect a doctor
gets from the society?

569
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:09,865
Why should l marry my daughter
to a man like you?

570
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,067
Father! Come on, let us go.

571
00:38:12,176 --> 00:38:16,738
Wait! Doctor! What are
you talking about?

572
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:21,874
Truth! l am speaking the truth.
You son is a goon.

573
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:25,547
He kidnaps people for money.

574
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,891
People of Hyderabad
call him Shankardada.

575
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:32,554
lf you don't know the truth that is
known to everyone in this city..

576
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:35,564
..means you are a fool.

577
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:38,758
Stop it. You already
said many things.

578
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:46,104
Shankar! What is he saying?

579
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:58,782
Shankar! Are you not a doctor?

580
00:39:14,972 --> 00:39:21,104
Doctor! Please forgive me.
l made a big mistake.

581
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:25,774
l cannot control my pain using
laughter therapy like you do.

582
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:32,945
This pain will be with me
as long as l live. Bye!

583
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:35,958
Doctor! Bed number 4
patient is serious.

584
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,618
You must come immediately.

585
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:00,643
You forgot to take your shawl.

586
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:04,648
l am leaving my pride and prestige.

587
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:09,653
Let it be there only.
lt will remind him..

588
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,254
..the pain he gave to his father.

589
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:38,681
This is the first time l saw him
going out without the shawl.

590
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:43,822
Why did you lie to us?

591
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:51,696
l was scared. Many years after
l ran away from home..

592
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:56,967
..l made a phone call to father. l
thought that he'll ask how l was.

593
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:59,975
But he asked me what l
was doing in Hyderabad.

594
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:02,045
He asked if l became
a rowdy or goon.

595
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:08,780
l was confused and scared. And
told that l became a doctor.

596
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:16,249
Mahalaxmi!
- Ask father to stay back, mother.

597
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:18,922
He will not listen.

598
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:32,202
Mother! l made a mistake. At least
slap me before you leave.

599
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:43,748
l am very sad. Please hug me once.

600
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:50,086
Mahalaxmi! Will you come
or should l go alone?

601
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:12,341
Here, take the bag.
- Get in. Drive!

602
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:27,153
Have some more, buddy.

603
00:42:27,264 --> 00:42:28,288
l am already over drunk.

604
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:34,633
Come on have it. lt is natural
to have troubles. Don't bother.

605
00:42:39,176 --> 00:42:40,973
Why are you crying?

606
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:49,309
l am not crying. The pain in my
heart is coming out as tears.

607
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,978
Please forget it. Nothing
is in our hands.

608
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:58,989
Had l saw Chitti there,
l would have..

609
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:02,259
Think of me as Chitti and tell
me what you want to say.

610
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:03,996
You are Chitti!

611
00:43:06,236 --> 00:43:10,070
Hey, Chitti! What did l
tell you in the phone?

612
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,004
You asked me to tell my father
that l didn't like you..

613
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:14,543
..after you came to my house.
- But what did you do?

614
00:43:14,645 --> 00:43:16,613
l told him that Shankar is
not a doctor but a goon.

615
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:20,277
Why did you slap me, buddy?

616
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,010
Why would l slap you?
You are my buddy.

617
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,481
You are Chitti. l slapped Chitti.

618
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:27,079
Why are you both fighting?

619
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:30,021
Nothing! l was talking to Chitti.

620
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,157
Buddy! He is Chitti. Hey,
you are Chitti.

621
00:43:34,264 --> 00:43:35,356
Yes, l am Chitti.

622
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:37,228
Are you Chitti?
- Yes. l am Chitti.

623
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:39,029
He is finished today.

624
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:42,363
Hey, Chitti! What did l
tell you in the phone?

625
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:44,167
You asked me to tell my father
that l didn't like you.

626
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:46,367
lsn't it?
- Yes. - But what did you do?

627
00:43:46,476 --> 00:43:49,240
l told him that Shankar is
not a doctor but a goon.

628
00:43:51,348 --> 00:43:52,645
Why did you hit me?

629
00:43:53,483 --> 00:43:55,508
Why would l hit you? You are
like my little brother.

630
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,382
Why would l hit my little brother?

631
00:43:57,487 --> 00:43:59,114
l pray to you. Please leave me.

632
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:02,317
l slapped Chitti. Chitti! - l pray
to you. l don't want this role.

633
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:03,518
Please change the character.

634
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:05,527
What should l do now?
- Brother! Lingam's character.

635
00:44:05,629 --> 00:44:07,062
Okay, l will do Lingam character.

636
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:10,460
You scoundrel! Rascal!
l will kill you.

637
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,400
Please forgive me. l don't want
any character. l will be myself.

638
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:15,130
No one is cooperating.

639
00:44:17,307 --> 00:44:21,209
Hey, who is trying to
remove that board?

640
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:23,074
Keep it there.
- Hey, do as he says.

641
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,546
Sorry, boss! Please forgive
us. We will fix it back.

642
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:30,086
Pull it back.
- Please sit down. Sit down, buddy.

643
00:44:30,187 --> 00:44:32,087
My father's name is written on that.

644
00:44:32,522 --> 00:44:34,353
My father should always be there.

645
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:40,761
Father felt very bad.
He is a respectful man.

646
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,291
He never steps out
without the shawl.

647
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:49,301
He left that means his prestige
was ruined completely.

648
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:52,101
And l am the reason for that.

649
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:55,110
Calm down! - l gave a lot
of pain to my parents.

650
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:58,438
l made a big mistake.
- You didn't make any mistake.

651
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:00,516
Calm down! Please calm down.

652
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:03,450
The reason for all this is Lingam.

653
00:45:03,553 --> 00:45:05,521
l will not spare him.

654
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:07,647
lt's alright. Have this.
- Yes, take it.

655
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:09,123
He gave me a lot of pain.

656
00:45:09,226 --> 00:45:11,126
Yes, it is indeed painful.
- How dare he abuse me?

657
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:13,128
Forget it. Have some drink.

658
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:19,130
Hey! l took a decision.

659
00:45:19,236 --> 00:45:20,533
What is that?

660
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:22,600
l will become a doctor.

661
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,671
Don't come to any conclusions now.

662
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:26,140
Let us discuss about this
tomorrow morning.

663
00:45:27,444 --> 00:45:32,677
Do you think l am drunk? l
have taken the decision.

664
00:45:32,783 --> 00:45:34,341
l shall become a doctor.

665
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:36,419
What will you do by
becoming a doctor?

666
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:39,350
l will marry Chitti and teach
her father a lesson.

667
00:45:39,523 --> 00:45:41,491
You will definitely
do that. Don't worry.

668
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:44,492
What should one do
to become a doctor?

669
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:46,494
You have to do doctor course
to become a doctor.

670
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,824
Very good. You know everything.

671
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:50,422
He is very intelligent.

672
00:45:51,535 --> 00:45:53,696
ln which school should l
study to become a doctor?

673
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:56,170
ln our municipal school.
- Yes, that's all.

674
00:45:56,273 --> 00:45:58,173
ls it? You too are intelligent.
- Thanks!

675
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:00,373
Both of you must do
me a small favor.

676
00:46:00,477 --> 00:46:01,501
What is that?

677
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:04,705
Get me a seat in the doctor school.

678
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,375
l will study there and
become a doctor.

- Boss, style!

845
00:58:18,448 --> 00:58:19,710
Hey! What happened to him?

846
00:58:19,816 --> 00:58:21,647
Suicide case! He took poison.

847
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:23,514
Why don't you take him in?
Why did you leave him here?

848
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:25,712
His mother is filling the form.

849
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:31,324
Doctor! - Yes. - Please
treat that guy. Please!

850
00:58:31,427 --> 00:58:32,860
Sorry! My duty is over.

851
00:58:32,962 --> 00:58:34,930
He seems to be dying.
Come and see him.

852
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:37,261
Let him die. What can l do?

853
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:39,266
What did you say?

854
00:58:39,368 --> 00:58:40,733
That is suicide case.
We cannot treat him..

855
00:58:40,837 --> 00:58:42,737
..unless the police comes
and files the case.

856
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:45,273
lf l kill you now, will this
hospital people try to save you..

857
00:58:45,374 --> 00:58:47,604
..or wait for the police to
come and file the case?

858
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,268
Come on, quick. Bring him.

859
00:58:54,584 --> 00:58:56,279
Don't worry. lf they hang
him upside down..

860
00:58:56,385 --> 00:58:59,286
..all the poison he
took will come out.

861
00:58:59,388 --> 00:59:01,288
Nothing to worry.
- Who are you?

862
00:59:01,491 --> 00:59:03,550
Shankar Prasad, MBBS first year.

863
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:07,287
Come to me if the doctor says
anything. l'll take care of him.

864
00:59:07,396 --> 00:59:09,296
l will be in the first year
class. Don't worry.

865
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:29,381
Hello! Hello, madam!

866
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:31,316
Where is first year class?

867
00:59:31,621 --> 00:59:33,987
What for?
- l am already late.

868
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,715
For what?
- To the class.

869
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:39,586
What work do you have in the class?

870
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:44,498
l am first year student.
- Are you a student?

871
00:59:44,634 --> 00:59:46,659
Yeah! l am top ranker
in the entrance.

872
00:59:48,538 --> 00:59:50,597
Go ahead and turn left.
- Thanks!

873
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:56,510
One minute, please! - Yeah! -
Turn your face to left, please.

874
00:59:58,714 --> 01:00:00,511
Yeah?
- Full turning.

875
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:18,633
Don't worry. S,u,n is Sun and i,t,h
a is itha. So your name is Sunitha.

876
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:20,361
Did you see how smart l am?

877
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:23,438
Do you think this to be fun?
l am Dr. Sunitha.

878
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:25,370
Then why did you write Sanitha?

879
01:00:27,577 --> 01:00:28,703
She seems to be mad.

880
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:40,647
Good morning, sir.

881
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:13,951
Good morning, everybody. l am
Dr. J. Ramalingeswara Rao!

882
01:01:14,056 --> 01:01:16,889
The dean of this college.
Please sit down.

883
01:01:19,795 --> 01:01:22,025
First of all l want to
tell you something.

884
01:01:22,131 --> 01:01:28,900
Many of the good doctors of our
state are from this college.

885
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:32,497
Hey, ATM! Didn't you find any
other college in Hyderabad?

886
01:01:32,608 --> 01:01:34,439
All of you should be proud that you
are the students of this college..

887
01:01:34,543 --> 01:01:37,444
..which has a glorious history
of hundred years.

888
01:01:37,546 --> 01:01:40,982
This institute has a history
of producing good doctors.

889
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,449
That Lingam is in front of me and
speaking something in English.

890
01:01:43,653 --> 01:01:46,451
No. Great doctors! Who among you..

891
01:01:46,555 --> 01:01:49,922
..wants to become good doctor?

892
01:01:53,996 --> 01:01:57,454
You! Tell me. Will you
be a good doctor?

893
01:01:57,566 --> 01:01:59,727
Yes, sir.
- How can you be so sure?

894
01:01:59,902 --> 01:02:04,737
Sir! l love people. l will treat
my patients as friends.

895
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,003
l will help them not like
a doctor but as a friend.

896
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:11,477
Well, young lady! We are
not here to make friends.

897
01:02:12,682 --> 01:02:15,480
ln my 25 years of service
l never made friendship..

898
01:02:15,584 --> 01:02:19,816
..with any of my patients. l never
thought about their pain.

899
01:02:20,923 --> 01:02:24,689
But just tried to reduce that pain.

900
01:02:25,695 --> 01:02:29,495
And l have done well. And
l don't love my patients.

901
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:34,836
Confused? Well, let me explain.

902
01:02:37,707 --> 01:02:40,505
Look at this hand. Rock study!

903
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:46,842
lt performed thousands of
operations. lt didn't shake. No!

904
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:52,518
But if l had to operate my daughter
it will shake for sure.

905
01:02:52,722 --> 01:02:57,785
Why is that? Because
l love my daughter.

906
01:02:57,893 --> 01:02:59,520
lt is not good to treat
patients as friends..

907
01:02:59,628 --> 01:03:03,189
..or developing affection
towards them.

908
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:09,069
For you patient means a body which
got disease. That's all.

909
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:11,139
So, wish you all the best.
Any questions?

910
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:16,735
Yes, your honor! Sir! l am here.

911
01:03:17,913 --> 01:03:21,144
Whose hand is that?
- A man who got 98.33 percent.

912
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,547
What do you mean?

913
01:03:31,927 --> 01:03:33,554
ls it necessary that a dying
person should fill the form..

914
01:03:33,662 --> 01:03:36,563
..near the causality to
get treatment, sir?

915
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,232
lsn't it true?

916
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:46,103
The class tomorrow will begin 8.30
in the morning. Sharp! Bye!

917
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,072
98.33 percent, Shankar Prasad?

918
01:03:55,951 --> 01:04:00,581
How is it possible?
How is it possible?

919
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,587
How would l know, sir?

920
01:04:02,691 --> 01:04:04,591
Yes, how would you know?

921
01:04:04,894 --> 01:04:10,594
98.33? l don't understand
how he came so far.

922
01:04:10,699 --> 01:04:12,929
Why are you worried, daddy?

923
01:04:13,035 --> 01:04:15,595
All my tension is about you.

924
01:04:15,805 --> 01:04:18,137
What?
- Yes. Do you know who he is?

925
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,209
He is a big goon. Didn't l tell you?

926
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:25,008
One minute!
- What? - Did he see you?

927
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:30,609
Yes. - Did he? Finished!
Everything is finished!

928
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,620
What, daddy? He cannot recognize
me. Did you forget?

929
01:04:33,722 --> 01:04:37,089
Yes. He cannot recognize you.
- Then?

930
01:04:37,193 --> 01:04:40,629
Yeah! Yeah! Thank God! Thank God!

931
01:04:42,064 --> 01:04:44,828
He shouldn't know that
you are my daughter.

932
01:04:44,934 --> 01:04:46,162
Shouldn't Shankardada too know this?

933
01:04:46,836 --> 01:04:51,637
No one should know about it.
You go. Please go.

934
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,298
Okay, sir.
- Go!

935
01:04:53,843 --> 01:04:57,301
Ramalingeswar Rao! Calm
down! Calm down!

936
01:05:06,021 --> 01:05:08,717
What is the need for you to
stay in this dirty hostel?

937
01:05:08,824 --> 01:05:09,848
lt's alright.

938
01:05:09,959 --> 01:05:11,654
Hey! Where is room number twelve?

939
01:05:11,861 --> 01:05:13,658
This is it.
- l will bring the luggage, boss.

940
01:05:13,762 --> 01:05:17,129
Okay.
- What a short room!

941
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,667
How can you become a doctor
if you study in this room?

942
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:21,133
Come on, let us go
to another college.

943
01:05:21,237 --> 01:05:23,671
ATM! Do you know why God sent
me to this college only..

944
01:05:23,772 --> 01:05:25,865
..when there are many other
colleges in our State?

945
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:27,738
l don't know. He didn't
say anything to me.

946
01:05:27,977 --> 01:05:33,938
God said, ''Go settle the score with
Lingam made your father cry.''

947
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:36,677
You've discussed it with God,
then it's settled.

948
01:05:36,785 --> 01:05:37,945
Hey! Bring the luggage in.

949
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,682
We are coming. Where should
l put these? - Put it there.

950
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,691
Hey! Arrange everything neatly.

951
01:05:54,904 --> 01:05:56,166
This place is better for you.

952
01:05:56,272 --> 01:05:57,705
This small room is not
enough even for you.

953
01:05:57,806 --> 01:05:59,239
Why don't you throw
the other fellow out?

954
01:05:59,341 --> 01:06:01,241
Hey, throw him out.
- Hey, get down!

955
01:06:02,144 --> 01:06:04,305
Excuse me! What is this?

956
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:06,711
lf you do like this l will
complaint to higher authorities.

957
01:06:06,815 --> 01:06:08,180
How dare you complain against..

958
01:06:08,284 --> 01:06:10,252
ATM! Calm down! l will talk to him.

959
01:06:10,352 --> 01:06:14,049
Come and sit here. Come on, brother.

960
01:06:14,156 --> 01:06:15,180
What is your name?

961
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:17,054
Chilukuri Veera Venkata
Subrahmanya Swami.

962
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,184
Swami is enough. Have it.

963
01:06:19,295 --> 01:06:21,126
My parents don't agree, sir.
- Will you drink if they agree?

964
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:22,720
No need for that. He will
automatically drinks..

965
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:24,992
..if he stays with me for a few
days. - l think one day is enough.

966
01:06:26,936 --> 01:06:28,130
What is this?
- Chocolate, sir!

967
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:30,735
My grandmother told me that l
will become fat if l eat it.

968
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:31,999
Very good! Eat it!

969
01:06:32,107 --> 01:06:33,734
No matter how much you eat you
are not going to become fat.

970
01:06:33,842 --> 01:06:35,070
Give it to me. Boss is speaking.
Turn to him.

971
01:06:35,177 --> 01:06:37,008
Swami! We are roommates.

972
01:06:37,112 --> 01:06:38,739
We must have some understanding.

973
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:40,212
How will it work if there
is no corporation?

974
01:06:40,316 --> 01:06:41,943
lt is co-operation and
not corporation, sir.

975
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:43,814
How dare you? What brother
tells is right.

976
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:45,750
Wait! lt's alright.
Come on, sit down.

977
01:06:45,854 --> 01:06:46,946
Hey, leave him.

978
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:50,216
Swami! Think all my items as your
own. You can use all of them.

979
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:51,759
Except boss's underwear.

980
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:52,952
Because it will fall down.

981
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:57,965
This movement is called hyper
extension and this is flex.

982
01:06:58,067 --> 01:06:59,762
Now combination of all
these three movements..

983
01:06:59,868 --> 01:07:02,234
..you can wave your hand to
somebody like this. Okay?

984
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:04,898
Below the wrist we have the palm.

985
01:07:05,007 --> 01:07:08,773
Swami! Do you want some? Have
them. They are tasty.

986
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:10,105
Please let me hear, sir.

987
01:07:10,212 --> 01:07:11,304
l came second in the exams
for the first time.

988
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:12,903
How do you think l got
the first place?

989
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:17,244
By eating chickpeas. Have some.

990
01:07:18,988 --> 01:07:20,046
Do you want to have some?

991
01:07:22,157 --> 01:07:24,955
So now you know what a hyper
extension movement is.

992
01:07:26,095 --> 01:07:29,394
Now the eight bones
in the wrist are..

993
01:07:29,498 --> 01:07:32,262
Are we clear so far? Any questions?

994
01:07:32,368 --> 01:07:35,804
Yes, Mr. Lingam! l asked
a question yesterday.

995
01:07:35,904 --> 01:07:37,132
You haven't answered it yet.

996
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:39,201
Speak in English!

997
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:43,340
Yenki's marriage, Subbi's
death anniversary.

998
01:07:44,113 --> 01:07:46,809
What?
- You ask me to talk in English.

999
01:07:49,685 --> 01:07:54,486
l am talking about the stupid
rule of your hospital.

1000
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:56,490
ls it necessary that a dying
man should fill a form?

1001
01:07:56,692 --> 01:07:59,490
Just get out.
- Why should l?

1002
01:07:59,595 --> 01:08:01,028
What do you say, Swami? Have some.

1003
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,495
Please get out!

1004
01:08:02,698 --> 01:08:07,499
l topped, and l paid the fees,
l am not going anywhere!

1005
01:08:07,603 --> 01:08:08,763
Have it.

1006
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:12,500
Alright! Fine!

1007
01:08:12,808 --> 01:08:14,503
lf this man doesn't leave at once..

1008
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:18,842
..then there will be no more
lectures on Anatomy this year.

1009
01:08:19,715 --> 01:08:22,047
Shankar! Don't make a mess.
Please go out.

1010
01:08:22,718 --> 01:08:25,016
Please! Please Shankar!
- Please Shankar!

1011
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:28,119
Please Shankar!
- Please Shankar! - Please Shankar!

1012
01:08:28,223 --> 01:08:29,247
Fine. Fine! l'll leave.

1013
01:08:29,358 --> 01:08:32,521
Why should anyone else lose
out? You teach them well.

1014
01:08:32,628 --> 01:08:35,859
Hey, Swami.. pay attention,
and teach me in the room.

1015
01:08:37,733 --> 01:08:38,791
Sorry, baby.

1016
01:08:41,837 --> 01:08:43,998
Lingam uncle! Why do you get tensed?

1017
01:08:44,106 --> 01:08:46,540
Eat these chickpeas with jaggery.

1018
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:47,870
All your tension will go.

1019
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:49,942
Why do you get angry?

1020
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,547
Get out!

1021
01:08:52,648 --> 01:08:54,548
Don't you want them? Okay.

1022
01:08:55,751 --> 01:09:00,552
Hey, ATM! Just now l blew off
the fuse of that Lingam.

1023
01:09:00,656 --> 01:09:03,557
He got very angry and
sent me out of class.

1024
01:09:03,992 --> 01:09:06,552
l happily came out.
His face was defused.

1025
01:09:06,662 --> 01:09:07,754
Why are you shouting?

1026
01:09:07,996 --> 01:09:10,556
That Lingam, l mean
Dr.Ramalingeswar Rao..

1027
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,634
..asked me to get out.

1028
01:09:12,768 --> 01:09:17,831
He is jealous that l topped
the class. ldiot!

1029
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:20,170
Why do you always treat him
in a disrespectful manner?

1030
01:09:20,275 --> 01:09:22,573
He is the head of this college.
Do you know that?

1031
01:09:22,678 --> 01:09:24,839
l don't bother even if he is a head.

1032
01:09:24,947 --> 01:09:27,780
Both he and his daughter
is big nuisance.

1033
01:09:27,883 --> 01:09:29,578
l shall teach them a lesson.

1034
01:09:29,785 --> 01:09:31,116
What did his daughter do?

1035
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,586
She is also like her father.

1036
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:36,055
l made a small request
that she keep quiet.

1037
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,785
But she revealed the
truth her father.

1038
01:09:37,893 --> 01:09:40,589
That Lingam insulted
me and my parents.

1039
01:09:40,896 --> 01:09:43,592
First time in my life
l saw my father crying.

1040
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:45,189
l'll not spare them.

1041
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:52,998
Why are you tensed? Be cool!
Don't worry. Go happily.

1042
01:09:53,108 --> 01:09:54,598
Hey, are you still on line?

1043
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,873
Sunitha, a friend of mine. Hey,
no! Nothing like that.

1044
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,141
Coming to Lingam's issue this
is just the beginning.

1045
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:02,217
You just wait and watch how l
give him shocks at every step.

1046
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:04,148
Doctor! Doctor!
- What happened, madam?

1047
01:10:04,253 --> 01:10:05,686
My son is attempting suicide again.

1048
01:10:07,823 --> 01:10:10,758
Vijay! Have you gone mad?
- Leave me!

1049
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:12,690
Throw it away. What are you doing?

1050
01:10:12,928 --> 01:10:14,088
Matron!

1051
01:10:14,196 --> 01:10:16,630
Leave me! Let me die!
l don't want to live.

1052
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:19,633
Vijay! Calm down! - lf you don't
keep quiet l'll kiss you myself.

1053
01:10:19,735 --> 01:10:21,635
ATM! Calm down! Go away.
- Don't stop me, buddy.

1054
01:10:28,844 --> 01:10:30,903
Sister! Make the tetanus
injection ready.

1055
01:10:32,214 --> 01:10:34,648
Now tell me what your problem is.
Did you fail in exam or..

1056
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,186
..fought with the friend
who took money from you?

1057
01:10:38,287 --> 01:10:41,256
What's there to think, buddy?
He might have loved a girl.

1058
01:10:41,356 --> 01:10:43,187
She might have dumped
him and he became mad.

1059
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,726
Shut up! Don't say a word
about her. She is my life.

1060
01:10:45,961 --> 01:10:51,866
This is the story of heart.
- Mad fellows!

1061
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:54,993
Hey, buddy! Look at your mother.
She how worried she is?

1062
01:10:55,103 --> 01:10:56,661
Do you want to die for
a girl who dumped you..

1063
01:10:56,772 --> 01:11:00,208
..leaving your mother, who loves
you, in sorrow? Are you not ashamed?

1064
01:11:00,309 --> 01:11:03,142
Listen to me. This love and
all its feelings are trash.

1065
01:11:03,245 --> 01:11:04,678
Forget everything.

1066
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,871
What do you know about love?

1067
01:11:09,885 --> 01:11:10,943
That's true.

1068
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,687
What do l know about love?

1069
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:19,761
Laila and Majnu know that.
Paru and Devadas know that.

1070
01:11:20,062 --> 01:11:23,691
And after them it is only
you who know what love is.

1071
01:11:23,799 --> 01:11:26,700
But l do have a love story.
Do you want to hear that?

1072
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:57,728
''Chaila chaila.. Chaila chaila''

1073
01:11:58,934 --> 01:12:01,903
''The name of the girl l fell
in love with, was Laila''

1074
01:12:03,939 --> 01:12:06,134
''Chaila chaila.. Chaila chaila''

1075
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:08,402
''The name of the girl l fell
in love with, was Laila''

1076
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:10,740
''How great was her style!''

1077
01:12:10,846 --> 01:12:13,076
''Her gait caused me to drool''

1078
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:17,345
''l blew up like a bomb when
l saw her rosy lips''

1079
01:12:17,452 --> 01:12:21,946
''My heart started to pound
when l saw her slim waist''

1080
01:12:22,124 --> 01:12:26,754
''My blood started to pump on
seeing her milky skin tone''

1081
01:12:26,962 --> 01:12:31,228
''l was struck by the fever of love''

1082
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:35,429
''O man, this love is
indeed an illusion''

1083
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:39,974
''This is a din, though
a mesmerizing one''

1084
01:12:40,142 --> 01:12:44,772
''O man, this love is
indeed an illusion''

1085
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:49,178
''This is a din, though
a mesmerizing one''

1086
01:12:49,985 --> 01:12:53,250
''Chaila chaila.. Chaila chaila''

1087
01:12:54,423 --> 01:12:56,948
''The name of the girl l fell
in love with, was Laila''

1088
01:13:18,013 --> 01:13:19,071
What happened after that, boss?

1089
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:22,014
Till that time l used to
roam like a free bird.

1090
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:25,415
But from that day l could not
roam freely or boss around

1091
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,818
Only one thing was on
my mind.. romance!

1092
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:41,829
''l stopped drinking from
the moment l saw her''

1093
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:46,167
''l started jogging early
in the morning''

1094
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:48,843
''l quit smoking on day 1 ''

1095
01:13:48,944 --> 01:13:50,844
''l stopped bashing others on day 2''

1096
01:13:50,946 --> 01:13:55,042
''On day 3 l used the butcher's
knife to bring her flowers''

1097
01:13:56,051 --> 01:13:58,042
''l pitched in a tent
in front of her home''

1098
01:13:58,153 --> 01:14:00,121
''l applied scent all over my body''

1099
01:14:00,288 --> 01:14:04,247
''l spent all my money
trying to woo her''

1100
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:09,023
''At that she turned to
me and smiled a little''

1101
01:14:09,297 --> 01:14:13,859
''She managed to play havoc with
that sweet smile of hers''

1102
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:18,065
''O man, this love is
indeed an illusion''

1103
01:14:18,173 --> 01:14:22,872
''This is a din, though
a mesmerizing one''

1104
01:14:23,245 --> 01:14:25,873
''Chaila chaila.. Chaila chaila''

1105
01:14:28,183 --> 01:14:31,880
l never had any hopes from life
but l pinned my hopes on her.

1106
01:14:31,987 --> 01:14:33,420
l had many dreams.

1107
01:14:33,522 --> 01:14:35,888
l thought that she was mine.

1108
01:14:35,991 --> 01:14:41,088
But one fine day.. she got married.

1109
01:15:00,348 --> 01:15:08,915
''All my dreams have come to naught''

1110
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:17,926
''They became tears but evaporated
without dropping''

1111
01:15:21,236 --> 01:15:23,261
What happened after that?

1112
01:15:25,307 --> 01:15:30,939
What else could happen? The
next day, in our locality..

1113
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:32,946
..entered the lovely Aishwarya!

1114
01:15:33,181 --> 01:15:37,948
''O man, this love is
indeed an illusion''

1115
01:15:38,153 --> 01:15:42,146
''This is a din, though
a mesmerizing one''

1116
01:15:43,258 --> 01:15:46,955
''O man, this love is
indeed an illusion''

1117
01:15:47,062 --> 01:15:51,362
''This is a din, though
a mesmerizing one''

1118
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,965
''Chaila chaila.. Chaila chaila''

1119
01:15:56,171 --> 01:15:59,231
''Why do you young guys make
an issue out of nothing?''

1120
01:16:00,008 --> 01:16:04,502
Brother, love is just a small part
of life but not life itself.

1121
01:16:04,613 --> 01:16:07,980
lt is a crime to take one's
life or that of the girl..

1122
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:10,313
..for such a trivial matter.

1123
01:16:10,418 --> 01:16:12,579
lt cannot be forgiven. Understand!

1124
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:17,386
''lt is not wrong to be defeated
but it is to die''

1125
01:16:17,492 --> 01:16:21,394
''lf death is the only remedy
why would anyone be here?''

1126
01:16:22,364 --> 01:16:26,460
''Life is not a joke but
a gift given by God''

1127
01:16:27,102 --> 01:16:31,004
''No one has the right
to end it mid-way''

1128
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:35,539
''Smile and dance, trouble
will run away from you''

1129
01:16:35,644 --> 01:16:40,479
''Cross this hurdle and nothing
shall stop you from winning''

1130
01:16:40,582 --> 01:16:44,484
''O man, this life is an illusion''

1131
01:16:45,053 --> 01:16:49,012
''O man, this life is an illusion''

1132
01:16:49,224 --> 01:16:53,558
''O man, this life is an illusion''

1133
01:16:54,129 --> 01:16:58,293
''O man, this life is an illusion''

1134
01:17:00,335 --> 01:17:03,031
Come, my friend.
- Thank you, brother.

1135
01:17:05,273 --> 01:17:08,037
That guy is smiling after many days.

1136
01:17:09,344 --> 01:17:11,505
l think he'll be fine
now. Thank you.

1137
01:17:11,613 --> 01:17:13,444
Why do you give me the credit?

1138
01:17:13,582 --> 01:17:17,040
Why do you tease everyone?

1139
01:17:17,352 --> 01:17:22,449
Did you come here to study or
to make fun of one and all?

1140
01:17:22,557 --> 01:17:24,047
Not all. Just Mr. Lingam.
l'll teach a lesson..

1141
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,060
..to that man and his daughter.
Take this.

1142
01:17:27,162 --> 01:17:29,255
No thanks. What did
my Chitti do to you?

1143
01:17:29,497 --> 01:17:32,330
Why do you say 'my'?
Do you know her?

1144
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,128
Of course.. my best friend.
- ls it!

1145
01:17:35,437 --> 01:17:38,270
Poor Chitti isn't even aware
of what her father does.

1146
01:17:38,373 --> 01:17:40,398
Does her father do so
many dirty things?

1147
01:17:40,508 --> 01:17:44,274
No. She said that he messed up a
marriage proposal a few days ago.

1148
01:17:44,512 --> 01:17:47,345
lt was l who was at the
receiving end that day.

1149
01:17:47,449 --> 01:17:49,747
That is why l am angry with him.
- Really!?

1150
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:53,081
She is motherless. Or
the mother would have..

1151
01:17:53,188 --> 01:17:55,554
..made her father understand.

1152
01:17:55,657 --> 01:17:59,149
l think the mother couldn't
bear him and left for heaven.

1153
01:17:59,261 --> 01:18:01,092
And Chitti might be
missing her mother.

1154
01:18:03,465 --> 01:18:07,094
Ms. Sunitha, how is that fatty?
- Fatty!?

1155
01:18:07,202 --> 01:18:08,635
Yes.. that's how l call her.

1156
01:18:08,737 --> 01:18:10,295
We both were good friends
as children.

1157
01:18:10,405 --> 01:18:13,101
l used to teach her swimming too.

1158
01:18:15,744 --> 01:18:17,769
Why do you laugh?
What happened then?

1159
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:24,112
While l was teaching her to swim..
- What happened?

1160
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:27,284
Her suit came off.

1161
01:18:29,491 --> 01:18:30,583
Stop it!

1162
01:18:33,328 --> 01:18:35,125
She would be wearing
saris now, of course.

1163
01:18:37,432 --> 01:18:40,663
How does she look like now?

1164
01:18:42,337 --> 01:18:43,804
She looks somewhat like me.

1165
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,340
She might look a little
less beautiful than you.

1166
01:18:48,576 --> 01:18:51,340
Rather, she is more
beautiful than me.

1167
01:18:51,513 --> 01:18:54,141
ls it true? l want to
see Chitti someday.

1168
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:57,642
Her father will kill her.
- Nonsense!

1169
01:18:58,453 --> 01:19:01,547
l feel like using swear words
just at his thought.

1170
01:19:02,657 --> 01:19:06,684
You said that Chitti is your
friend. Why don't you make us meet?

1171
01:19:07,529 --> 01:19:13,434
Why?
- Don't ask.. please.

1172
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:18,163
l'll do it if you promise not to
get into trouble with any professor.

1173
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:22,173
l'll have to think
over it. l'll try.

1174
01:19:23,478 --> 01:19:27,175
Observing him carefully. Such
interesting cases are rare.

1175
01:19:27,382 --> 01:19:31,182
The fact is that this boy is in
this stage since six years.

1176
01:19:33,388 --> 01:19:36,721
He is alive but is more
like a live corpse.

1177
01:19:36,825 --> 01:19:40,591
You say that he is alive. Why
describe him as a corpse?

1178
01:19:40,695 --> 01:19:42,788
Why don't you put him
in the children's ward?

1179
01:19:42,897 --> 01:19:45,798
Why keeping among these corpses?
This is too much.

1180
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,733
Mr. Shankar, he doesn't have
bodily needs like us.

1181
01:19:48,837 --> 01:19:51,806
lt is wasting a bed to
put him in the ward.

1182
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,200
Now see this. You can observe
that the light of this torch..

1183
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:58,404
..goes only till his eyeballs
and not beyond.

1184
01:20:04,652 --> 01:20:07,678
Stop doing it.
- Why?

1185
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:09,484
He will be in pain because
of the light in his eyes.

1186
01:20:09,591 --> 01:20:10,751
Shankar, please sit down.

1187
01:20:10,859 --> 01:20:15,228
He will have no pain because he
cannot see or hear or talk.

1188
01:20:17,665 --> 01:20:19,223
His senses are all dead.

1189
01:20:19,534 --> 01:20:21,764
There is nothing that can
be done about this subject.

1190
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,566
Why do you address him as
'subject'? Doesn't he have a name?

1191
01:20:24,672 --> 01:20:29,439
He does. lt is Sri Rama
Chandra Murthy.

1192
01:20:29,611 --> 01:20:33,240
lt is a very nice name. Why
don't you call him so?

1193
01:20:33,348 --> 01:20:36,249
He cannot hear anything in any case.

1194
01:20:36,351 --> 01:20:39,252
His parents died before his
very eyes in an accident.

1195
01:20:42,557 --> 01:20:43,717
He is in a coma ever since.

1196
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:48,455
No. He is searching for his
parents with the same eyes.

1197
01:20:48,563 --> 01:20:51,464
He is afraid of losing
them if he closes them.

1198
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,792
This boy will not stay
here any longer. Sorry!

1199
01:20:54,903 --> 01:20:55,927
Come, my boy.

1200
01:20:56,037 --> 01:20:58,062
Hey, where are you taking him?
- To the children's ward.

1201
01:20:58,173 --> 01:21:01,074
He says that giving you a bed
is a waste! No sympathy at all!

1202
01:21:01,976 --> 01:21:09,781
Sorry.. Sorry, Sri Ram.
ls it painful?

1203
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:17,890
My heart is wrung to see
you in this state.

1204
01:21:18,993 --> 01:21:21,291
Were you like this since six years!

1205
01:21:21,996 --> 01:21:26,831
None of these doctors seem
to have pity on you.

1206
01:21:26,935 --> 01:21:28,630
They aren't even considering
you a human being.

1207
01:21:28,837 --> 01:21:31,305
They read a few books
and feel they are gods.

1208
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,808
Hey doctor, give those headphones.

1209
01:21:48,957 --> 01:21:52,654
Sri Ram.. see how your heart beats!

1210
01:21:52,961 --> 01:21:56,055
From now on you should tell
everyone that you are alive.

1211
01:21:57,198 --> 01:21:59,063
Would you like to hear it yourself?

1212
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:13,010
You are alive.. 100 percent.

1213
01:22:13,214 --> 01:22:16,672
lf anyone questions it, make
them hear your heartbeat.

1214
01:22:28,997 --> 01:22:30,089
Hey, ATM..

1215
01:22:30,798 --> 01:22:33,164
He just took the subject
out of the classroom.

1216
01:22:33,268 --> 01:22:34,701
Didn't you do anything?

1217
01:22:34,802 --> 01:22:36,360
What should l do? Fight him?

1218
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:38,905
He caught me by the throat.
l could've died.

1219
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:41,700
He uses un-parliamentary language
in the classroom.

1220
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,773
His language is like that
of slum-dwellers.

1221
01:22:44,012 --> 01:22:45,707
What is this? ls this
some country bar?

1222
01:22:45,914 --> 01:22:48,212
Stop here.

1223
01:22:48,349 --> 01:22:50,249
Get it in quickly.

1224
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,912
Send a circular that all students
shall talk only in English.

1225
01:22:55,023 --> 01:22:56,183
Yes, you are right.

1226
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:58,191
We all want him suspended.

1227
01:22:58,293 --> 01:23:00,727
Or warn him to talk
to us with respect.

1228
01:23:00,828 --> 01:23:04,264
No one has the guts to warn him.
So.. better rusticate him.

1229
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:07,391
One sec.. we can't do
anything to him. - Why?

1230
01:23:07,502 --> 01:23:08,799
What reason will you offer?

1231
01:23:09,103 --> 01:23:14,200
That he asks questions or that
he talks disrespectfully?

1232
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:18,738
We shouldn't forget that he stood
first in the pre-medical exam.

1233
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:22,949
He can't be removed unless
the reason is very strong.

1234
01:23:24,118 --> 01:23:28,350
Hey, man in whites! Where
is the children's ward?

1235
01:23:28,456 --> 01:23:29,923
Go ahead and take a left turn.

1236
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:36,156
There is only one way
we can send him out.

1237
01:23:36,965 --> 01:23:41,766
Mr. Rafi, set the exam paper
for this term yourself.

1238
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:47,772
The paper should be the toughest
ever this college had.

1239
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:52,369
Sure, sir.
- Take care that he doesn't cheat.

1240
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:57,782
He will fail and be rusticated
the very next day.

1241
01:23:57,885 --> 01:23:59,785
And will be out of college!

1242
01:24:05,994 --> 01:24:10,055
Bring them all here. Arrange
them properly.

1243
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:13,465
Mr. Shankar brought in a bed.

1244
01:24:14,168 --> 01:24:16,329
Oh my god! C'mon.

1245
01:24:18,306 --> 01:24:22,003
And you, mind your language.
Why do you give him respect?

1246
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:25,409
l'm sorry sir. lt is just Shankar.
- That's better.

1247
01:24:26,014 --> 01:24:28,005
This is your personal bed.

1248
01:24:28,116 --> 01:24:30,277
You can rest here without
having any problem.

1249
01:24:30,385 --> 01:24:32,819
No one will bother you from today.

1250
01:24:38,126 --> 01:24:40,026
Buddy, Lingam is here.

1251
01:24:40,128 --> 01:24:41,823
Welcome, father-in-law!

1252
01:24:41,929 --> 01:24:44,830
Stop this nonsense.

1253
01:24:44,932 --> 01:24:46,832
ls this a hospital or
an amusement park?

1254
01:24:48,136 --> 01:24:49,831
Shankar!
- What is it, father-in-law?

1255
01:24:49,937 --> 01:24:52,030
What is all this?
- Say cheese!

1256
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:56,499
May l ask what is happening here?
- Please do.

1257
01:24:57,045 --> 01:24:59,912
Shankar Prasad, l've
to ask you something.

1258
01:25:00,214 --> 01:25:02,842
What are you up to now? ln
my 25 years of service..

1259
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:06,511
..l came across many
people like you.

1260
01:25:06,621 --> 01:25:09,317
And l know what to do with them.
- He's ranting in English.

1261
01:25:09,424 --> 01:25:10,857
See how l answer him back!

1262
01:25:13,161 --> 01:25:16,858
See, uncle! Vulture eating
hundred buffaloes.

1263
01:25:16,964 --> 01:25:19,865
One cyclone.. finished. How is it?

1264
01:25:19,967 --> 01:25:21,867
Our boss is speaking
in English! Great!

1265
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:25,865
Don't you know the saying
about the vulture..

1266
01:25:25,973 --> 01:25:30,069
..that ate a hundred buffaloes
being killed in a small storm?

1267
01:25:31,179 --> 01:25:34,205
lt means that even the mighty
are done in quite easily.

1268
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:38,484
Shut up! Who is the vulture?

1269
01:25:38,586 --> 01:25:40,554
You are the vulture
and l the cyclone.

1270
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:47,027
Buddy, you learnt so much
English in just 5 days.

1271
01:25:47,128 --> 01:25:51,064
ln 5 years you will learn so much
that he will just vanish.

1272
01:25:53,468 --> 01:25:56,904
Shankar, your deeds are not good.
- Why do you say so?

1273
01:25:57,004 --> 01:25:58,904
l want the bed to be
removed right now.

1274
01:26:01,275 --> 01:26:06,303
You'll pay for this. C'mon.
- Let's go.

1275
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:19,248
Hey, crop his hair well.
He must look like a hero.

1276
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,385
Or l'll cut your throat.
- Ok, sir.

1277
01:26:21,496 --> 01:26:23,930
Do it fast. l must take
him out into the sun.

1278
01:26:24,031 --> 01:26:25,123
Why into the sun?

1279
01:26:25,233 --> 01:26:28,999
The sun rays give vitamin D
to the body. lt is healthy.

1280
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:33,204
You've learnt a lot.
- Don't praise me.

1281
01:26:33,374 --> 01:26:35,934
You are very intelligent.
- Shall l tell you something?

1282
01:26:36,377 --> 01:26:38,937
How many bones do you
think the body has?

1283
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:42,149
All we know is to break bones.
When did we ever count them?

1284
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:46,414
l know the count. 206..
l learnt it yesterday.

1285
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:49,012
You've already become a doctor.
Why do you need the college?

1286
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:50,283
l too feel the same.
- Excuse me!

1287
01:26:56,330 --> 01:27:00,289
He feels very shy.
- l want to talk to you. - Ok.

1288
01:27:01,335 --> 01:27:03,963
Shankar, you've to
change your habits.

1289
01:27:04,071 --> 01:27:07,563
You mean this?
- No, it is the way you talk.

1290
01:27:07,675 --> 01:27:11,167
All the professors are angry
with you. Specially the Dean.

1291
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:13,509
Why should l change for that man? -
Why are you always against that man?

1292
01:27:15,082 --> 01:27:16,982
Oh God, l've begun to talk like you!

1293
01:27:17,185 --> 01:27:20,177
l am telling you seriously.
- Ok, boss.

1294
01:27:20,354 --> 01:27:24,154
The term exam is going to be very
tough, especially for you.

1295
01:27:24,358 --> 01:27:27,987
lf you fail you'll be
sent out of college.

1296
01:27:33,367 --> 01:27:35,995
l am talking to you. Why
do you look elsewhere?

1297
01:27:49,217 --> 01:27:50,411
My goodness!

1298
01:27:50,518 --> 01:27:52,076
He looks like a hero!

1299
01:27:57,391 --> 01:28:00,417
Shankar, please prepare
well for the term exam.

1300
01:28:01,229 --> 01:28:04,096
lf you pass l'll make
you meet Chitti.

1301
01:28:06,234 --> 01:28:09,203
Promise!
- Yes!

1302
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:12,206
Hail Mohd. Rafi!

1303
01:28:14,242 --> 01:28:17,040
Why did you all come here again?

1304
01:28:18,246 --> 01:28:23,047
Uncle, come on. Let's play carom.

1305
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:24,583
How do you do, uncle?

1306
01:28:24,685 --> 01:28:27,051
We all came to play carom.

1307
01:28:27,154 --> 01:28:31,056
ls this a club that you come to
play when you like? - Shut up!

1308
01:28:36,297 --> 01:28:39,596
The paper is very tough isn't it?
- Yes, indeed.

1309
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:45,532
Will you please help me a little?

1310
01:28:48,175 --> 01:28:50,234
No? Please attend to your duty.

1311
01:28:57,451 --> 01:29:02,252
Alimentary canal! Did
you finish writing?

1312
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:06,759
The answer to question 4 is ..
Spinal cord atrophy induces..

1313
01:29:06,861 --> 01:29:12,094
Talk slowly..
- Ok, take it down..

1314
01:29:14,302 --> 01:29:15,428
Why can't you keep quiet?

1315
01:29:15,536 --> 01:29:18,596
Don't make noise. l
can't concentrate.

1316
01:29:19,307 --> 01:29:23,175
Write down now.. Spinal..
- Tell me the spelling.

1317
01:29:23,344 --> 01:29:30,512
S P l N A L.. C O R D..

1318
01:29:39,427 --> 01:29:41,395
lt was quite difficult, doctor.

1319
01:29:41,629 --> 01:29:43,529
Best of luck!
- Thanks.

1320
01:29:44,432 --> 01:29:47,128
Some students are cheating.
Be watchful.

1321
01:29:48,502 --> 01:29:52,131
This boy is a genius! Great!

1322
01:29:53,341 --> 01:29:57,141
lf Shankar Prasad gets his
medical degree here..

1323
01:29:57,244 --> 01:30:02,147
..then in the future street
language will rule this hospital.

1324
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:07,149
Rafi, l want to know how he got
so many marks in the test.

1325
01:30:07,355 --> 01:30:11,155
How would l know, sir?
- Yes, how would you know it?

1326
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:16,319
Did you ask for Shankar Prasad?
- Yes, call him in.

1327
01:30:17,365 --> 01:30:19,333
Did you want to see
me, uncle Lingam?

1328
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,634
l'm sorry. Doctor uncle, what for?

1329
01:30:24,739 --> 01:30:30,575
Mr. Shankar, you seem to
have come first again.

1330
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:33,779
Thank you!

1331
01:30:35,383 --> 01:30:38,511
How!? How is it possible?

1332
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,653
lt is because of our professors.

1333
01:30:40,755 --> 01:30:42,586
l mean they teach quite well!

1334
01:30:42,723 --> 01:30:44,782
What do you want to do?
- l want to make you cry.

1335
01:30:45,559 --> 01:30:47,527
That's what you think l will say.

1336
01:30:47,628 --> 01:30:50,722
But l actually want to
be Shankardada MBBS.

1337
01:30:50,831 --> 01:30:53,197
By cheating like this
and passing the exams?

1338
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,393
Doctor uncle found it out!

1339
01:30:55,569 --> 01:30:59,198
Correct, l did cheat. l'll do
in future too! Do what you can.

1340
01:30:59,306 --> 01:31:03,208
What did he say?
- He says 'Do what you can'.

1341
01:31:03,511 --> 01:31:05,877
What did you say just now?

1342
01:31:06,414 --> 01:31:08,746
l said you can't pluck
even a hair on my body.

1343
01:31:09,417 --> 01:31:10,611
What did he say!?

1344
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:14,752
You still don't know my might.

1345
01:31:14,855 --> 01:31:17,221
l can send you out of this college.

1346
01:31:20,428 --> 01:31:24,762
Did you already forget how l
separated your father from you?

1347
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:30,229
How can l forget that? lt is
still fresh in my memory.

1348
01:31:30,438 --> 01:31:33,236
That is why l took it as a
challenge and got a seat here.

1349
01:31:33,441 --> 01:31:36,433
l will graduate here
and become a doctor.

1350
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:40,410
l shall marry your daughter
and become your nemesis.

1351
01:31:42,616 --> 01:31:44,379
Didn't you still follow me, uncle?

1352
01:31:44,485 --> 01:31:46,248
He wants everything told in English.

1353
01:31:46,487 --> 01:31:49,251
ln front there is
crocodile festival!

1354
01:31:53,461 --> 01:31:54,450
What did he say?

1355
01:31:54,562 --> 01:31:57,588
That there is a crocodile
festival in front.

1356
01:31:58,799 --> 01:32:02,257
l mean that there is more
trouble in store for you.

1357
01:32:02,369 --> 01:32:03,927
You look cute, uncle.

1358
01:32:25,659 --> 01:32:28,628
Please give me a minute
before you break.

1359
01:32:29,597 --> 01:32:33,499
A little boy who cannot see as
we do wants to say something.

1360
01:32:34,468 --> 01:32:35,492
Please listen to him.

1361
01:32:37,671 --> 01:32:40,299
l too want to see and
enjoy the movies and..

1362
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:44,707
..all beautiful things in
this world. But l can't.

1363
01:32:44,812 --> 01:32:46,837
There are many blind people like me.

1364
01:32:46,947 --> 01:32:48,847
You all are very kind-hearted.

1365
01:32:48,949 --> 01:32:51,315
lf you care for us and
donate your eyes..

1366
01:32:51,418 --> 01:32:54,478
..we too shall be able
to see and enjoy life.

1367
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:59,784
You heard this little boy's request.

1368
01:32:59,894 --> 01:33:04,854
Please sign the form to
donate your eyes today.

1369
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:08,329
And if you come to know
of anyone's death..

1370
01:33:08,435 --> 01:33:12,337
..please convince the relatives to
donate the eyes of the deceased.

1371
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:14,873
And see to it that the eyes
reach the nearest eye bank..

1372
01:33:14,975 --> 01:33:16,670
..within the prescribed time limit.

1373
01:33:16,777 --> 01:33:21,339
Let us donate our eyes after death
and bestow sight to the needy.

1374
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:23,844
Please think about it and implement.

1375
01:33:36,897 --> 01:33:38,524
The country will never develop.

1376
01:33:38,632 --> 01:33:41,362
No one keeps their promise.
What is this?

1377
01:33:41,468 --> 01:33:42,696
What happened now?

1378
01:33:42,803 --> 01:33:45,533
You said that you will introduce
me to Chitti..

1379
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:47,368
..if l top the exams.
But you didn't do it.

1380
01:33:47,474 --> 01:33:48,702
Actually you too..

1381
01:33:48,809 --> 01:33:51,369
Madam! l thought that you are
the only good person here.

1382
01:33:51,478 --> 01:33:52,877
But you too..

1383
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,538
l mean if you introduce
me to Chitti..

1384
01:33:54,648 --> 01:33:57,378
..l will confirm that you
are a good person. Please!

1385
01:33:57,484 --> 01:34:00,385
Listen, Shankar! Though Chitti
wants to meet you..

1386
01:34:00,487 --> 01:34:03,547
..she couldn't since you are
fighting with her father.

1387
01:34:03,657 --> 01:34:06,387
Dude he's like the incredible Sulk.

1388
01:34:06,493 --> 01:34:08,393
Why don't you stop abusing the dean?

1389
01:34:08,495 --> 01:34:12,397
lt is possible only after
jantar manter treatment.

1390
01:34:12,499 --> 01:34:13,557
Jantar mantar!?

1391
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:15,396
Jantar mantar choo mantrakali!

1392
01:34:15,502 --> 01:34:17,402
All the pain should go away.

1393
01:34:17,504 --> 01:34:18,903
My mother told me in my childhood.

1394
01:34:19,006 --> 01:34:22,908
lf anyone is worried or tensed then
go and give him a nice hug.

1395
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:25,740
lt is an anti-tension drug.
Didn't you understand?

1396
01:34:25,846 --> 01:34:29,407
Hey, can't you see it's wet there.

1397
01:34:29,516 --> 01:34:33,418
l keep cleaning, people
keep walking.

1398
01:34:37,725 --> 01:34:39,090
One minute!

1399
01:34:40,461 --> 01:34:44,090
l'll die sweeping.

1400
01:34:44,198 --> 01:34:46,598
Hey! Why do you all
walk this way only?

1401
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,099
Why don't you go that way?

1402
01:34:48,202 --> 01:34:53,105
Sorry, uncle!
- Sorry!? l don't need your sorry.

1403
01:34:53,207 --> 01:34:56,108
That word is not new for me.
Everyone says the same.

1404
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:58,110
What is your name, uncle?

1405
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:02,108
You want to complain? Go and do it.

1406
01:35:02,216 --> 01:35:06,118
My name is Yadagiri. Ch.Yadagiri!
Move away.

1407
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:09,121
l don't want to complain.
l want to thank you.

1408
01:35:14,228 --> 01:35:15,286
Really..

1409
01:35:18,232 --> 01:35:24,137
Everyone thanks doctors
for making them well.

1410
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:29,141
No one thanks you for picking their
rubbish and cleaning the wards.

1411
01:35:29,777 --> 01:35:33,144
lt is to you whom they should
thank in the first place.

1412
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:38,150
l just want to say thanks
to you, uncle.

1413
01:35:52,533 --> 01:35:54,160
This is enough, my child.

1414
01:35:54,702 --> 01:35:57,170
You are the first person who
spoke nicely with me..

1415
01:35:57,271 --> 01:36:00,172
..in my entire service.
This happiness is enough.

1416
01:36:01,275 --> 01:36:02,333
Bye, uncle.

1417
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,245
Sorry, uncle!

1418
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:12,578
Forget it. l'll take care of it.

1419
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:18,748
Did you see?
- You cooled his anger magically.

1420
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,256
Didn't l tell you about jantar
mantar choo mantrakali?

1421
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,418
Ask that Lingam to come and hug me.

1422
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,257
l will cure all his diseases.

1423
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:27,257
But you are not going to
stop abusing him. ls it?

1424
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:31,267
l will not. l will suck
his life out slowly.

1425
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:34,270
Shankar!
- Madam!

1426
01:36:34,806 --> 01:36:37,274
What about introducing Chitti?

1427
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:39,434
Thanks!

1428
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:42,274
l've decided. l'm making a
call to Dubai immediately.

1429
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,607
Dubai? To whom, daddy?

1430
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:49,881
To Abbas. He will come
and slay that Shankar.

1431
01:36:49,988 --> 01:36:51,285
Who is this Abbas guy?

1432
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:54,290
He was my patient.
He is in Dubai now.

1433
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:56,292
l performed piles operation.

1434
01:36:56,394 --> 01:37:02,299
He told me to call him
if l get any problem.

1435
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:06,300
Daddy! Stop it. This way of talking
is not suited for you.

1436
01:37:06,504 --> 01:37:09,302
Yeah! But that is not important
for me. Shankar must be..

1437
01:37:11,676 --> 01:37:14,304
Hello! - Hello, Chitti!
This is Shankar speaking.

1438
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:17,642
What is it?

1439
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:18,807
Didn't Dr.Sunitha talk to you?

1440
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:22,317
About what?
- l topped the exams again.

1441
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,650
lt's turned into a habit of course!

1442
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,314
So, what do you want?

1443
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:29,484
You promised to meet me
if l top the exams.

1444
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:31,323
Meeting him!?

1445
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,659
Shankar! l can't meet you.

1446
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:38,327
Chitti! lt's wrong to break a
promise. l want to talk to you.

1447
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:40,336
But Lingam uncle shouldn't
know this at any cost.

1448
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:42,338
l mean your father Lingam.

1449
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:46,342
Okay. Tomorrow evening let
us meet in ecstasy club.

1450
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:50,676
Club!? Okay. Thanks.
- Bye!

1451
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:51,840
Oh, no! l will kill
that bloody idiot.

1452
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:53,507
Daddy! Daddy! Don't worry.

1453
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:56,348
l have a plan with which Shankar
will stop teasing you.

1454
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:02,849
l trust you. But be
very careful! Okay?

1455
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,359
You don't worry, dad.

1456
01:38:11,569 --> 01:38:14,367
Why are they dancing in the dark?

1457
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:15,700
Why didn't they switch
on the lights?

1458
01:38:16,574 --> 01:38:19,372
Why are you tensed? ls
it for sister-in-law?

1459
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:27,714
Go away! ls she the one?
- She is very fat.

1460
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:30,379
You only said that she is very fat.

1461
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:31,887
That's in her childhood.
Now she is very slim.

1462
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,389
ls that so? Then where is she?

1463
01:38:40,598 --> 01:38:44,728
Shankar! - She is calling you.
She might be the one.

1464
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,906
Go now! Come on!

1465
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:55,411
Shankar! How are you doing?

1466
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,744
O my God! You are looking
really handsome!

1467

Hey, listen to me. l

You are so handsome and so sweet!

1473
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,758
Sister-in-law! Hey,

Come on, Shankar! Dance!

Shankar! Why are you feeling so shy?

1484
01:40:16,027 --> 01:40:21,488
You are so young! Hey! Look at me.

1485
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:23,997

My boyfriend.
- What do you mean by boyfriend?

1489
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:33,501
Boyfriend means boyfriend.

1490
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:36,671
You know he gives me good
company during weekends..

1491
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:39,511
..parties and in picnics.

1492
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:41,676
Actually you don't have
any girlfriend?

1493
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:43,515
Don't you have any girlfriends?

01:40:44,155 --> 01:40:47,522
You are so nice! So sweet!

Chitti! You changed a lot.

Oh, Shankar! ?

1502
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:10,045

You go.
- Come on, dear! - Coming!

1504
01:41:16,187 --> 01:41:17,552
Bye!

1505
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:19,884
Come on let us go.

1506
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,566
O my God! You must have seen it.

1507
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:31,896
lt was so funny.

1508
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:34,904
Really!? - He was very much
disappointed on seeing me.

1509
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,566
He said 'Chitti! You changed a lot'.

1510
01:41:38,776 --> 01:41:40,903
Didn't he doubt you?
- No! No!

1511
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:42,570
Even a bit?
- No!

1512
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,581
He didn't doubt but was very
much worried about you.

1513
01:41:50,221 --> 01:41:55,591
Daddy! What.. - l am really sorry.
But l had to hear it.

1514
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,593
Boyfriend means?
- Uncle!

1515
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:02,757
Even though l sent you l
was very much worried..

1516
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:04,926
..that he might recognize the truth.

1517
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,765
Really you did a marvelous job.

1518
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,099
Fantastic! l am proud of you.

1519
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:09,604
Are you happy now, daddy?

1520
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:11,607
l am really happy. Boyfriend means?

1521
01:42:13,311 --> 01:42:17,611
Enough! Stop it now. Everything
went as planned.

1522
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,615
Don't know how bad he felt.

1523
01:42:25,156 --> 01:42:29,616
This is very bad. Anyone
would feel pity about me.

1524
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:31,126
But you are smiling.

1525
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:33,628
Were you so upset about Chitti?

1526
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:37,633
All my dreams were shattered.

1527
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:41,637
ln our childhood she used to talk
to only me and no other boy.

1528
01:42:41,839 --> 01:42:47,641
But now she danced with a bunch
of guys in front of me.

1529
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:50,646
ln her childhood she used
to feel very shy..

1530
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:53,649
..if her swim suit slips a
little bit while swimming.

1531
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:57,653
But now she is shamelessly..

1532
01:42:58,022 --> 01:43:00,650
Don't ask me. l feel pain in
my heart if l think about it.

1533
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:04,159
ls she the same Chitti whom
you used to call fatty?

1534
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:07,662
lt is because of that fatty my
heart is broken now. Forget it.

1535
01:43:09,033 --> 01:43:12,662
Madam! You too are a doctor.
Look how decent you are.

1536
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:14,670
You are very lovely.

1537
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:21,678
l mean you look very pretty.

1538
01:43:21,879 --> 01:43:25,679
Past is past. l think you
must forget Chitti now.

1539
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:28,013
And stop fighting with dean now.

1540
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:29,848
Your way of talking
is also very nice.

1541
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:33,014
Even Chitti used to speak
like this in our childhood.

1542
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:36,685
Every time l saw you l felt that
Chitti would also be pretty like you.

1543
01:43:36,894 --> 01:43:39,692
But l am not Chitti. lsn't it?

1544
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:41,025
Yes.

1545
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:49,705
'Why shouldn't you be my Chitti?'

1546
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:52,708
'Whenever l thought about Chitti,
l used to think about you.'

1547
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:56,710
' But now it is you who
is in my heart.'

1548
01:43:57,081 --> 01:44:00,710
What?
- What? - You said something.

1549
01:44:03,421 --> 01:44:07,721
What did you hear?
- Did you say anything?

1550
01:44:08,359 --> 01:44:12,728
No. - l felt that you
said something to me.

1551
01:44:20,104 --> 01:44:22,732
No! No! No! No! l don't agree, boss.

1552
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,900
She heard the words that l
said to her in my heart.

1553
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,740
Why would she smile shyly otherwise?

1554
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:30,746
She is in love with me. l am sure.

1555
01:44:32,283 --> 01:44:35,741
Don't you believe? You are jealous.

1556
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,754
My mother always told me. lf
we think of something good..

1557
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:41,086
..about some one in our heart,
then it will surely reach them.

1558
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:43,251
And that good work will happen.

1559
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:48,764
Didn't you understand? This is
called telepathy in English.

1560
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:50,094
This is general knowledge.

1561
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:53,098
Whatever you may say but l am
in love with her for sure.

1562
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:56,264
She too is in love with me.
This is true. lsn't it?

1563
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:57,772
l know that you will agree.

1564
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:03,779
l should talk about love with
a child like you but..

1565
01:45:08,152 --> 01:45:10,780
Hey, Sri Ram! You blinked at me.

1566
01:45:11,422 --> 01:45:14,789
Doctor! Doctor! Sri Ram has moved.

1567
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:16,120
Moved!?
- Yes. He blinked at me.

1568
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:17,785
ls it?
- Yes, come here.

1569
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:19,795
Come on. He blinked at me just now.

1570
01:45:20,331 --> 01:45:23,789
Hey, Sri Ram! Doctor is here.
Do it once again.

1571
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:27,131
Please do it once again.

1572
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,139
Mr. Shankar! He is in this
condition since six years.

1573
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:31,299
lt is impossible.

1574
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:33,808
Boss! No, boss! Please
wait for a while.

1575
01:45:33,911 --> 01:45:35,970
Sri Ramachandra Murthy! l
know that you can hear me.

1576
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,308
You can do it again if you want.

1577
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:40,815
Blink your eyes just once.
Please do it once.

1578
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:43,978
Otherwise they think that l
am lying. Sri Ram! Please!

1579
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,147
Okay, everybody! Let's all
go back to our work.

1580
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:49,988
Just once.. - Stay here and wait
for him to blink his eye.

1581
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:52,824
lnform me as soon as
he does that. Okay?

1582
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:00,335
What is this, Shankar?
What happened?

1583
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:02,837
Nothing, Sunitha! l
was talking to him.

1584
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,840
He answered me by blinking his eyes.

1585
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:06,842
But no one believed it.

1586
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,344
Don't you too believe?

1587
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:12,847
Shankar! He cannot hear anything.

1588
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:17,182
Your words will reach to his
ears but not to his brain.

1589
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:20,348
Where else will it go?
Should l tell you that?

1590
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:24,188
lt reaches his heart. Let
me tell you something.

1591
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:25,853
Believe it or not if you have
strong feelings for some one..

1592
01:46:25,963 --> 01:46:27,362
..then your thoughts will
surely reach him.

1593
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:29,864
Shankar! Everything that we
believe cannot be science.

1594
01:46:31,235 --> 01:46:32,532
Sorry!

1595
01:46:36,407 --> 01:46:38,875
Sunita! l am thinking
something in my heart.

1596
01:46:39,243 --> 01:46:41,871
l am sure that it will reach you.

1597
01:46:44,748 --> 01:46:49,549
Mike test! One! Two! Three!

1598
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:52,554
Sunitha! l think that you
are in love with me.

1599
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:58,561
lf that is true you will turn back.
You will turn back. Turn back.

1600
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:21,583
Boss! Doctor is in love
with me. Shall l proceed?

1601
01:47:22,953 --> 01:47:28,186
Okay. Now you blink at me
but not in front of others.

1602
01:47:28,292 --> 01:47:29,589
Anyway, thanks!

1603
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:33,595
l met Dr. Madhusudan's son
yesterday. He is also a doctor.

1604
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,598
Neurosurgeon! Very good
looking fellow!

1605
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,597
l want you to meet him once.

1606
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:42,604
''The day has began, O friend!''

1607
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,105
''l will give you shock after
shock, Lingam uncle''

1608
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:45,607
Shankardada is here.

1609
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:47,609
He brought a flower bouquet for you.

1610
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:50,612
So what? Why are you afraid
as if he brought a bomb?

1611
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:53,114
You don't know about him.
Hurry up! Go inside.

1612
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:55,617
Come on, go inside. Go!

1613
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:59,621
''With this tension you
cannot even sleep.''

1614
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:03,625
''l shall see how far
this drama goes.''

1615
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,786
''l rang the calling
bell in your heart.''

1616
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:08,626
''Come and open the door, uncle''

1617
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,635
Good morning, Dr.Ramalingeswar Rao!

1618
01:48:14,004 --> 01:48:16,632
Me!? Mr. Ramalingeswar Rao!?

1619
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,640
Doctor uncle, Lingam uncle etc..

1620
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,642
l have decided not to call
you like that in future.

1621
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,143
May l know why?

1622
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:24,146
Definitely! First take this bouquet.

1623
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,648
Why are you giving it to me?
Give it to Chitti. Come on.

1624
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,650
Oh, no! Don't call her.

1625
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:31,653
l think you are disturbed.
- You are right.

1626
01:48:32,356 --> 01:48:36,986
Now my heart is filled with
flowers, thorns and feelings.

1627
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:38,652
What is it? What did you say? What?

1628
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,662
Nothing. l just want to say
it is in bad condition.

1629
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,163
But used some heavy dialogs.
That's all.

1630
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:43,665
Forget it. Take this bouquet.

1631
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,166
No! No! You give it to her.
Come on! Come on!

1632
01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:48,670
No, sir. - Come on! - Let us
sit in the lawn and talk.

1633
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:50,672
Okay, come!
- First take this bouquet.

1634
01:48:55,879 --> 01:48:58,177
Sorry! Sorry!
- lt's okay. lt's okay.

1635
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:04,687
l gave you a lot of tensions. l
came here to say sorry to you.

1636
01:49:06,056 --> 01:49:08,684
lt is l who made the mistake.
Yes, it is my mistake.

1637
01:49:08,892 --> 01:49:11,690
What if you have passed by cheating?

1638
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:14,025
You are a gem.
- Thank you!

1639
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:16,691
Chitti will be fortunate to
have a husband like you.

1640
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:20,700
Wait! l shall introduce Chitti
to you. Chitti! Chitti!

1641
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,705
Sir! Don't call her. Sorry!

1642
01:49:24,908 --> 01:49:26,205
Okay.

1643
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,039
l already met Chitti.

1644
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:33,709
Did you? You naughty!

1645
01:49:34,918 --> 01:49:36,215
How is she?

1646
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:40,722
l want to tell you a truth.

1647
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:43,725
l felt that Chitti she is too wild.

1648
01:49:45,095 --> 01:49:46,892
l know she's a motherless child..

1649
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:49,727
But you ought to control her a bit.

1650
01:49:49,933 --> 01:49:53,733
lt is not late yet. You can
control her if you want to.

1651
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:57,739
Yeah! Yeah!
- Yes, you can.

1652
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,742
But once you two are married she
will automatically change.

1653
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:07,749
Don't call her. Because l
don't want to marry her.

1654
01:50:08,452 --> 01:50:11,751
Shankar! Her heart will..

1655
01:50:13,123 --> 01:50:14,750
What will happen to her now?

1656
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:16,758
What are you saying, sir? l
cannot dump my happiness..

1657
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,259
..to protect your daughter
from falling off.

1658
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,091
You only tell me. Am l wrong?

1659
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:23,758
Correct! Correct! Poor Chitti!

1660
01:50:23,967 --> 01:50:26,094
But what about you?

1661
01:50:32,142 --> 01:50:33,769
Come on, tell me!

1662
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:37,779
l am already in love
with another girl.

1663
01:50:43,887 --> 01:50:45,787
Who? Who is that lucky girl?

1664
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:49,791
She is..
- Come on, tell me.

1665
01:50:50,994 --> 01:50:53,292
You shouldn't say this
to anyone. Promise?

1666
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:54,796
Yes, promise.

1667
01:50:58,502 --> 01:51:00,800
She is your assistant doctor.
- Who is that?

1668
01:51:01,171 --> 01:51:06,803
Sunitha! Dr. Sunitha! l love her.

1669
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,810
lt will be decided in
a couple of days.

1670
01:51:10,447 --> 01:51:11,812
l want your blessings, sir.

1671
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,819
Aren't you really happy? So am l.

1672
01:51:18,522 --> 01:51:19,819
You are really generous.

1673
01:51:22,025 --> 01:51:25,825
Sir! You promised me. Don't
tell anyone about Sunitha.

1674
01:51:26,363 --> 01:51:28,160
No! No!
- See you, sir! Thanks!

1675
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:48,349
l didn't like your behavior.
- What did l do?

1676
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:51,012
Have you gone mad? Why did you
tell my dad that you love me?

1677
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,850
When did l tell that to your dad?

1678
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:55,857
l mean Chitti's dad.
He is like my father.

1679
01:51:55,959 --> 01:51:58,189
He promised me that he wouldn't
tell it to anyone.

1680
01:51:58,295 --> 01:51:59,853
But l don't know that he
can't keep his trap shut.

1681
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:02,193
l shall slap him when l meet him.

1682
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:05,860
Why didn't you tell that to me?

1683
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:13,875
l was scared.
- What? - l was scared.

1684
01:52:15,979 --> 01:52:17,879
What is your opinion about me?

1685
01:52:18,415 --> 01:52:20,883
You are good person.
- Not that. Anything else?

1686
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:23,043
You cannot keep quiet if someone
is in pain. - And?

1687
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,883
You want everyone to be happy.
- And? What else?

1688
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:28,890
You are a rowdy and goon.

1689
01:52:28,992 --> 01:52:30,391
Why did you say that?

1690
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:45,907
Your smile is energetic
like water falls..

1691
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:51,072
..stylish like the flowing river,
sweet like the music of birds..

1692
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:55,914
..graceful like the flying swan
and beautiful like the deer.

1693
01:52:56,286 --> 01:52:59,915
My heart is attracted to its charm.

1694
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:03,925
l love you. l love you, Radha.

1695
01:53:04,127 --> 01:53:06,925
Radha? Who is Radha?

1696
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:09,931
l wrote these lines when
l was in tenth class.

1697
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:11,261
To say to the girl whom l love.

1698
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,097
l got that chance today.
That is why l told you.

1699
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:14,431
Did you like it?

1700
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,942
Sunitha! Will you marry me?

1701
01:53:21,311 --> 01:53:26,943
What?
- lt's alright. l will marry you.

1702
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:30,952
Shankar!
- Madam! Please!

1703
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:33,955
Doctor! Thomas's reports are here.

1704
01:53:38,328 --> 01:53:39,454
Come on!

1705
01:54:06,089 --> 01:54:09,490
Hey, ATM! Pandudada and his
men came to the hospital.

1706
01:54:09,593 --> 01:54:11,993
Keep an eye on them.

1707
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:15,997
Don't worry, buddy. l'll
take care of that.

1708
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:22,998
Why did you hide it from
me? Tell me, doctor.

1709
01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:25,336
l am asking you. Why didn't
you tell me this earlier?

1710
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:28,002
l would have admitted
in the hospital.

1711
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:30,170
Don't get upset, Thomas.
We got the best doctors.

1712
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,339
We are going to take
best care of you.

1713
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:36,010
Nothing will happen to you.
God is there to protect.

1714
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:39,020
God! Why did he give this
disease to me then?

1715
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:41,022
Thomas!
- lt's true, doctor.

1716
01:54:41,725 --> 01:54:47,186
l never drank or smoked. l've
never been with a woman..

1717
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:53,031
..then why me? l am the only
earning member of my family.

1718
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:56,037
They are all depended on my salary.

1719
01:54:56,406 --> 01:54:59,034
What will they do if anything
happens to me?

1720
01:55:00,677 --> 01:55:04,044
Now l don't have time to
fulfill any of my dreams.

1721
01:55:13,156 --> 01:55:18,059
What happened to him?
- Cancer!

1722
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:20,061
He'll live for few days only.

1723
01:55:24,267 --> 01:55:27,065
Hello, boss! Excuse me!

1724
01:55:28,605 --> 01:55:33,065
Dr. Sunitha told me about you.
l felt very bad. l am sorry.

1725
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:38,580
lf we hug the person who is in
tension, their will get relief.

1726
01:55:38,682 --> 01:55:40,582
lt is true. My mother told me that.

1727

lf we hug the person who is in
pain, their will get relief.

1728

You and your superstitions!

1730
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:49,090
Don't say like that.
What l said it true.

1731
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:51,683
Hey, mister! Don't irritate
me. Let me go.

1732
01:55:51,795 --> 01:55:54,263
No. You are feeling tense.
You will get relief.

1733
01:55:54,364 --> 01:55:56,093
Believe me.

1734
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,258
Leave me! Hey! l will
die if l have to.

1735
01:55:58,368 --> 01:55:59,596
Who are you to worry about me?

1736

to die. lf you..

1737

Come on! Hey, where

Search for him.

Ask them.
- Hey! Where is Thomas?

Why do you want that?
- Hey, where is Thomas?

choler yesterday.

1748

very bad about it.

We felt very bad.
- That's true.

1755

We never saw him like this.

1756
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:06,497
He worries a lot if
anyone is suffering.

02:03:43,333 --> 02:03:45,392
There was so much brightness
in the face of Thomas and..

1836
02:03:45,501 --> 02:03:47,560
..the face of the dean
has become sullen.

1837
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:49,228
Shankar is very intelligent.

1838
02:03:49,339 --> 02:03:51,569
Did you see how happy Thomas is?

1839
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:56,236
His face is glorious. Shankar
is really great.

1840
02:03:57,614 --> 02:03:59,241
Hey, l got cold.

1841
02:03:59,349 --> 02:04:03,251
Let us give him one jantar
mantar choo mantar

1842
02:04:03,353 --> 02:04:06,254
Devi! Give me jantar mantar.

1843
02:04:06,623 --> 02:04:09,251
Meera! Will you give me jantar
mantar if l come there?

1844
02:04:09,459 --> 02:04:11,256
Shut up!

1845
02:04:14,631 --> 02:04:17,259
Nobody will try to save him.

1846
02:04:18,368 --> 02:04:21,269
Matron! l give you
five minutes time.

1847
02:04:21,371 --> 02:04:24,431
Give me a written complaint
against Shankar..

1848
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:27,600
..or place your resignation
letter on my table.

1849
02:04:32,649 --> 02:04:34,276
Why do you make a din
without packing?

1850
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:36,284
We are at it. Why do you trouble us?

1851
02:04:36,386 --> 02:04:37,444
Shankar!

1852
02:04:42,392 --> 02:04:46,294
Are you leaving? l did not answer
your question so far.

1853
02:04:46,396 --> 02:04:48,296
You did not answer me because
you have no feeling.

1854
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:53,301
lt is a waste of time
to try to woo you.

1855
02:04:53,403 --> 02:04:58,636
Shankar.. one word before
you leave. - Tell me.

1856
02:04:58,741 --> 02:05:01,301
You made Vijay Mohan, who attempted
suicide, to smile.

1857
02:05:02,412 --> 02:05:07,315
Thomas who was ruing his fate,
now wants to live.

1858
02:05:08,418 --> 02:05:11,319
All this happened just because
of you. Thank you.

1859
02:05:18,428 --> 02:05:22,330
The patients don't want doctors
who just give them medicines..

1860
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:24,332
..but you, who give them love.

1861
02:05:24,534 --> 02:05:28,334
l am saying the truth,
believe me. Stay back.

1862
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:32,340
We loaded the entire luggage.

1863
02:05:32,442 --> 02:05:35,343
Unload it and put it
back in the room.

1864
02:05:35,445 --> 02:05:38,346
He asks us to load it first and
then to unload it. Are we mad?

1865
02:05:38,448 --> 02:05:42,350
How dare you question the
boss? Do as he says.

1866
02:05:43,453 --> 02:05:47,355
Shankar! - What is it? Did
Lingam give more trouble?

1867
02:05:47,457 --> 02:05:50,358
You must meet Lingam, l
mean the dean, urgently.

1868
02:05:51,461 --> 02:05:52,689
l will go and meet him.

1869
02:05:54,564 --> 02:05:56,361
Good morning, Dean.

1870
02:05:57,467 --> 02:05:59,367
Why do you trouble them
unnecessarily for me?

1871
02:05:59,469 --> 02:06:00,697
We already have reached
an understanding.

1872
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:01,861
What is the problem now?

1873
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:03,370
You are the problem, Shankar.

1874
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:06,368
We want discipline in the college.

1875
02:06:06,476 --> 02:06:07,704
That is what enrages me.

1876
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,869
Why do you dance around in
the name of discipline?

1877
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:11,378
What is my mistake?

1878
02:06:11,481 --> 02:06:15,383
Thomas is about to die and so l
did something to cheer him up.

1879
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:17,385
Why do you make a big
issue out of it?

1880
02:06:17,487 --> 02:06:19,387
Take my advice and close
this matter here.

1881
02:06:22,759 --> 02:06:24,727
That is what l am going to do!

1882
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:27,387
He is a good man and
shall take my advice.

1883
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:29,397
Take this. - What is it? -
Your rustication letter.

1884
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:31,899
What does it mean?
- Oh, you don't understand.

1885
02:06:32,001 --> 02:06:36,404
lt means that you are being
sent out of college.

1886
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:40,408
You have to leave this
college tomorrow.

1887
02:06:40,610 --> 02:06:45,912
Uncle Lingam.. l don't want to call
you that way but you force me to.

1888
02:06:46,015 --> 02:06:50,418
What do you mean? - l wanted to
leave this college 10 mins ago.

1889
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:55,421
But someone l like stopped
me. Your bad luck!

1890
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:59,427
Fold this and put it.. in there.

1891
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:04,932
You may scheme at will but l will
never leave this college.

1892
02:07:05,034 --> 02:07:07,434
See you. - l'll call the police
if you don't leave.

1893
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:08,765
They will show you the way out.

1894
02:07:08,871 --> 02:07:11,931
Uncle Lingam, l know the
police better than you.

1895
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:15,442
They could not put me
in a jail so far!

1896
02:07:16,546 --> 02:07:18,446
You look so cute when tense.

1897
02:07:19,816 --> 02:07:21,943
Don't get tense. Be cool! See you.

1898
02:07:22,051 --> 02:07:24,611
l am not going to leave
this guy. l shall..

1899
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:28,451
Mr. Lingam! House busting
no festival!

1900
02:07:28,658 --> 02:07:30,785
What did he say?
- l don't know sir.

1901
02:07:30,893 --> 02:07:33,453
You want me to talk in English
but can't understand it.

1902
02:07:33,563 --> 02:07:36,464
House cleaning is not festival.
l will see.

1903
02:07:39,569 --> 02:07:43,471
Why are you laughing? Get out.

1904
02:08:19,876 --> 02:08:26,509
What happened? Shankar!

1905
02:08:45,902 --> 02:08:50,532
lt is emergency case.
Somebody fill my form.

1906
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,547
Shankar! What happened?

1907
02:08:59,749 --> 02:09:01,546
Who is it?

1908
02:09:02,084 --> 02:09:03,711
lt's me, Sunitha

1909
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:09,553
Sunitha! Sunitha! Where are you?

1910
02:09:09,659 --> 02:09:12,560
Stop joking. What happened?

1911
02:09:12,662 --> 02:09:13,890
Hand fractured.

1912
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:15,554
How it happened?

1913
02:09:15,665 --> 02:09:18,566
Stepped on banana peal and fell

1914
02:09:18,668 --> 02:09:20,898
Shakar! Why you have done like this?

1915
02:09:21,003 --> 02:09:27,567
lt is you Who asked me not
to go out. So? So l did it.

1916
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,078
You are really mad.
- l Know it.

1917
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,580
Then why you are here? Go and
join in a mental hospital.

1918
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:35,583
There l cannot find Dr.Sunitha.

1919
02:09:37,687 --> 02:09:38,745
Shankar! l will..

1920
02:09:38,854 --> 02:09:40,583
Help! Help!

1921
02:09:49,799 --> 02:09:52,597
How much time does it take to
discharge him from hospital?

1922
02:09:52,702 --> 02:09:55,603
He is seriously injured. He got
nine fractures and nine stitches.

1923
02:09:55,705 --> 02:09:57,935
lt takes at least a month
for him to recover.

1924
02:09:58,975 --> 02:10:01,102
See that he got cured
as early as possible.

1925
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:04,611
l want him out of this hospital.
Understand!

1926
02:10:04,814 --> 02:10:06,111
Hello!

1927
02:10:08,718 --> 02:10:09,946
O my God!

1928
02:10:12,722 --> 02:10:20,629
Sri Ram! Eat it. Yes, Sri Ram
will readily eat it. He ate it!

1929
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:24,632
Sri Ram will also eat it.
He ate it again.

1930
02:10:24,834 --> 02:10:26,631
There is demon inside.

1931
02:10:26,736 --> 02:10:27,964
Demon?

1932
02:10:33,843 --> 02:10:39,645
Where is it? Yes l found it.

1933
02:10:39,749 --> 02:10:42,650
So you ate the biscuit
of our Sri Ram.

1934
02:11:07,209 --> 02:11:12,841
Sri Ram! This puppet is
playing game with you.

1935
02:11:15,785 --> 02:11:16,843
l will kill it.

1936
02:11:16,952 --> 02:11:18,681
Shankar! He blinked his eyes

1937
02:11:18,788 --> 02:11:21,689
l know it. But he will not
do it before doctors.

1938
02:11:22,058 --> 02:11:25,687
He fools me every one and teases me.

1939
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:28,025
You are a doctor and
you talk like this.

1940
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:38,699
Sir, he is my father. l am most
worried. Please save my father

1941
02:11:41,077 --> 02:11:42,203
l am checking him.

1942
02:11:46,916 --> 02:11:51,046
He is already aged. No use.

1943
02:11:51,153 --> 02:11:54,213
l am hopeful that my father
will certainly recover.

1944
02:11:54,323 --> 02:11:57,724
He did not eat any thing
since past one week.

1945
02:11:58,828 --> 02:12:02,730
Keep monitoring his B.P.
and give him saline.

1946
02:12:05,835 --> 02:12:07,735
First give him something to eat.

1947
02:12:08,838 --> 02:12:10,066
You shut up!

1948
02:12:11,107 --> 02:12:13,735
Shankar! Probably he
cannot eat any thing.

1949
02:12:15,845 --> 02:12:17,073
He will eat.

1950
02:12:25,855 --> 02:12:27,254
What is happening here?

1951
02:12:29,859 --> 02:12:35,764
See, how l play this coin.
Just missed.

1952
02:12:38,868 --> 02:12:40,768
This red coin is mine.

1953
02:12:44,874 --> 02:12:46,102
See how l play this red coin.

1954
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,780
You need experience
to play the red coin.

1955
02:13:38,928 --> 02:13:40,156
He is coming!

1956
02:14:23,072 --> 02:14:24,869
How nicely you have
played the red coin.

1957
02:14:27,076 --> 02:14:31,877
Please drink juice.
You will be happy.

1958
02:15:37,046 --> 02:15:39,947
Father! l am very happy, l love you.

1959
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:44,110
Did you see my play?

1960
02:15:44,219 --> 02:15:45,277
Excellent shot, father.

1961
02:15:45,387 --> 02:15:47,116
Son! l am very hungry.

1962
02:15:47,222 --> 02:15:48,951
Matron! Get some food.

1963
02:15:59,668 --> 02:16:02,967
l love you my father, l love you.

1964
02:16:10,346 --> 02:16:13,975
Thank you Shanker ! thank you.
You can do any thing.

1965
02:16:14,083 --> 02:16:16,984
What is in me? There is god
to look after every thing.

1966
02:16:17,086 --> 02:16:20,988
lt is miracle. When we lost
every hope you saved my ..

1967
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:23,490
Father. You are really a god.

1968
02:16:32,101 --> 02:16:33,500
Shall we play again? Father!

1969
02:16:33,602 --> 02:16:35,001
Sure, my son. Certainly!

1970
02:16:59,228 --> 02:17:02,026
''Where do you come from?''

1971
02:17:03,132 --> 02:17:05,032
''Where do you come from, O girl?''

1972
02:17:07,136 --> 02:17:10,196
''Where do you come from, O girl?''

1973
02:17:10,305 --> 02:17:13,035

''Where do you come from?''

1997
02:19:40,389 --> 02:19:44,189
''Your beauty is mesmerizing me''

02:19:44,293 --> 02:19:47,194
''lt is wrenching my heart''

02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:04,370
''l shall not be separated
from you day or night''

2004
02:20:04,479 --> 02:20:08,210
''We shall dance and enjoy
each other's company''

2005
02:20:08,317 --> 02:20:11,218
''Where do you come from, O girl?''

2006
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:14,218
''Please tell me that, O lightning''

2007
02:20:15,324 --> 02:20:18,225
''l come from that place O man''

2008
02:20:18,327 --> 02:20:21,228
''That place which is
full of jasmines''

2009
02:20:28,937 --> 02:20:31,235
ls there any pain? Very good!

2010
02:20:33,342 --> 02:20:36,243
Shankar! How are you?

2011
02:20:36,345 --> 02:20:39,246
Fine! lf you do not try to send
me out it will be fine.

2012
02:20:39,348 --> 02:20:44,251
Your luggage is packed and in
ten minutes you have to leave.

2013
02:20:45,621 --> 02:20:47,248
This is your rustication letter.

2014
02:20:47,789 --> 02:20:53,421
Nonsensical letter. Lingam uncle!
Whatever you may do..

2015
02:20:53,528 --> 02:20:55,257
..l am going to leave this place.

2016
02:20:57,899 --> 02:21:03,269
l know it. lnspector!
Here is your man.

2017
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:06,608
Shankar is arrested
and taken by police.

2018
02:21:28,397 --> 02:21:30,297
You cannot send Shankar out.

2019
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:31,627
Who are you?

2020
02:21:31,733 --> 02:21:35,294
l am cleaning this hospital
for the past thirty years..

2021
02:21:35,404 --> 02:21:37,304
..but you don't even know my name.

2022
02:21:37,406 --> 02:21:40,307
What you want is money
but not people.

2023
02:21:40,942 --> 02:21:47,313
Shankar hugged me and thanked me.

2024
02:21:47,516 --> 02:21:50,314
From now onwards you stay at
the gate and hug the people..

2025
02:21:50,419 --> 02:21:55,322
..moving in and out. This
man must be sent out.

2026
02:21:55,424 --> 02:21:56,823
lf you send the man out,
we all will go on strike.

2027
02:22:02,531 --> 02:22:11,337
Matron! Open the door.
Come on inspector.

2028
02:22:15,444 --> 02:22:18,345
Sir! Do not take Shankar
out. Let him stay.

2029
02:22:18,447 --> 02:22:22,349
Swami! Do you know why you
got second in every exam?

2030
02:22:22,451 --> 02:22:24,851
Because Shankar is cheating
to get first.

2031
02:22:24,953 --> 02:22:29,356
lt is all a lie. Shankar is
intelligent and need not cheat.

2032
02:22:29,891 --> 02:22:35,352
lntelligent! Don't talk rubbish.
Ask Rafi if you want.

2033
02:22:35,564 --> 02:22:39,364
Shankar agreed that he passed
by cheating before all.

2034
02:22:41,470 --> 02:22:42,528
Rafi!

2035
02:22:42,637 --> 02:22:44,366
When, sir? l don't remember.

2036
02:22:51,747 --> 02:22:58,380
Okay! You don't believe that
he passed by cheating.

2037
02:22:59,488 --> 02:23:06,394
l will prove it. Next Monday l
examine him in assembly hall.

2038
02:23:09,765 --> 02:23:14,395
He will be in this college
if he answers my questions.

2039
02:23:15,504 --> 02:23:18,405
You may wantonly ask
difficult questions.

2040
02:23:18,607 --> 02:23:21,405
Shut up Swami! Let me finish. Okay?

2041
02:23:23,512 --> 02:23:26,413
You choose any three professors
of this college..

2042
02:23:26,515 --> 02:23:28,574
..and they will examine him.

2043
02:23:28,683 --> 02:23:35,418
They will decide whether he is
eligible to become a doctor.

2044
02:23:36,625 --> 02:23:39,423
Ok, you can go now.

2045
02:23:41,530 --> 02:23:43,430
Shankar! Do you feel tension?

2046
02:23:43,532 --> 02:23:45,432
l don't feel any tension.

2047
02:23:45,534 --> 02:23:46,762
What we do now?

2048
02:23:46,868 --> 02:23:48,426
What l can say? Let us see.

2049
02:23:51,540 --> 02:23:52,598
lt is locked, sir.

2050
02:23:55,544 --> 02:23:57,774
Diabetes mellitus is chronic
clinical syndrome..

2051
02:23:57,879 --> 02:24:03,943
..characterized by hyperglycemia
due to lack of insulin.

2052
02:24:04,052 --> 02:24:08,455
The symptoms are polyhydra,
unusual thirst, polyurea..

2053
02:24:08,557 --> 02:24:10,957
..frequent urination and
unusual weight loss.

2054
02:24:12,828 --> 02:24:14,455
ls it not correct?

2055
02:24:14,563 --> 02:24:16,793
Congrats! Very good, Shankar!
Very good! Keep it up!

2056
02:24:16,898 --> 02:24:18,456
l was really tensed.

2057
02:24:22,838 --> 02:24:24,465
Silence, please!

2058
02:24:27,843 --> 02:24:29,470
Professor Sharma! Ask your question.

2059
02:24:29,578 --> 02:24:33,480
Mr. Shankar! Please tell us the
treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis.

2060
02:24:33,682 --> 02:24:36,810
Okay. l will. Cerebral malaria
collectively are..

2061
02:24:36,918 --> 02:24:38,476
lt is not that, Shankar.

2062
02:24:39,588 --> 02:24:41,488
Shankar! Second question
is Tuberculosis..

2063
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:42,989
..and third question is malaria.

2064
02:24:43,091 --> 02:24:45,491
l read it in the order you gave me.

2065
02:24:45,594 --> 02:24:47,994
Why are you changing it now?
Don't confuse me.

2066
02:24:48,096 --> 02:24:51,497
What if Ramalingeswar Rao didn't
let us ask in that order?

2067
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:54,660
He is.. l shall deal
with him later. Okay.

2068
02:24:54,769 --> 02:24:56,828
There are two stages of treatment.

2069
02:24:56,938 --> 02:25:00,499
lntensive therapy for two months
which includes four drugs.

2070
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,509
Penicillin, Anacin..
- Tiphansing!

2071
02:25:04,613 --> 02:25:06,513
Did you stop me? Come on,
you tell the answer.

2072
02:25:06,615 --> 02:25:09,516
l have practiced it with
certain rhythm, Swami.

2073
02:25:09,618 --> 02:25:11,677
lf you stop me in the middle, l've
to start from the beginning.

2074
02:25:11,786 --> 02:25:13,515
Why don't you understand my problem?

2075
02:25:14,055 --> 02:25:15,852
There are two stages of treatment.

2076
02:25:17,626 --> 02:25:19,526
Doctor! Thomas is very serious.

2077
02:25:23,632 --> 02:25:25,532
Shankar! He is asking for you.

2078
02:25:27,903 --> 02:25:30,531
Sunita! Please do something
to save him. Please!

2079
02:25:30,639 --> 02:25:34,541
l did what l could as a doctor.
He wants to meet you.

2080
02:25:34,643 --> 02:25:38,545
He may not live long. lt is
you who can do something.

2081
02:25:38,647 --> 02:25:40,547
Me!? What can l do?

2082
02:25:40,649 --> 02:25:43,550
Do something, Shankar! Please,
do something. Come on!

2083
02:25:46,755 --> 02:25:50,555
Thomas! Thomas! Shankar, please!

2084
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:55,560
Thomas! Thomas! Look at me.

2085
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:05,572
Thomas! Thomas!
- Please save me, Shankar!

2086
02:26:05,674 --> 02:26:10,907
Okay. Don't worry. l am here.
Nothing will happen to you.

2087
02:26:11,012 --> 02:26:12,741
l want to live.

2088
02:26:12,847 --> 02:26:16,578
l'll take care of you. Doctor!
Please give some treatment.

2089
02:26:16,685 --> 02:26:20,587
No, Shankar! These doctors
cannot save me.

2090
02:26:22,123 --> 02:26:25,581
Only you can save me.

2091
02:26:27,696 --> 02:26:33,601
You can save anyone.
You have that power.

2092
02:26:35,704 --> 02:26:36,762
You are the God.

2093
02:26:36,871 --> 02:26:38,600
Don't say that, Thomas.
- You are the God, Shankar.

2094
02:26:38,707 --> 02:26:40,937
No. lt is only the God who
can protect everyone.

2095
02:26:41,042 --> 02:26:43,602
He will definitely save you.
Don't lose your confidence.

2096
02:26:43,712 --> 02:26:44,940
Be brave!

2097
02:26:45,046 --> 02:26:52,612
Just one day! Make me live
for one more day. Please!

2098
02:26:52,721 --> 02:26:55,622
My mother will come at
1 1 o'clock tomorrow.

2099
02:26:56,725 --> 02:26:59,626
l want to talk to her once.

2100
02:26:59,728 --> 02:27:01,628
Okay, definitely.

2101
02:27:01,997 --> 02:27:05,626
Please, Shankar! Please save me.

2102
02:27:08,169 --> 02:27:10,637
Thomas! Nothing will happen to you.

2103
02:27:10,739 --> 02:27:12,639
You will talk to your
mother tomorrow.

2104
02:27:12,741 --> 02:27:15,642
You will introduce her to
all of us. Don't worry.

2105
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:21,646
Thomas!

2106
02:27:30,759 --> 02:27:33,159
Hey, Thomas!

2107
02:27:33,261 --> 02:27:34,660
Talk to me. Thomas!

2108
02:27:44,372 --> 02:27:45,669
Sorry, Shankar!

2109
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:54,678
Diabetes mellitus is chronic
clinical syndrome..

2110
02:27:54,783 --> 02:27:57,684
..characterized by hyperglycemia
due to lack of insulin.

2111
02:27:58,053 --> 02:28:02,683
The symptoms are polyhedral,
unusual thirst, polyurea..

2112
02:28:02,791 --> 02:28:05,692
..frequent urination and
unusual weight loss.

2113
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:15,702
Silence please! Thank
you! Next question!

2114
02:28:16,071 --> 02:28:21,703
Mr. Shankar Prasad! Describe the
treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis.

2115
02:28:26,081 --> 02:28:27,708
l want to live.

2116
02:28:36,257 --> 02:28:38,725
Shall l repeat the question?
- No!

2117
02:28:38,827 --> 02:28:41,227
Ask the next question
if he doesn't know it.

2118
02:28:41,329 --> 02:28:44,730
He knows the answer, sir.
l mean he might know it.

2119
02:28:46,835 --> 02:28:49,736
Pulmonary Tuberculosis!
You know TB, cough..

2120
02:28:49,838 --> 02:28:51,066
What treatment will
you give for that?

2121
02:28:51,172 --> 02:28:54,733
Rafi! There is no need to
explain in detail. Okay?

2122
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:56,737
Shankar! Answer please!

2123
02:29:00,949 --> 02:29:03,747
Make me live for one more day.

2124
02:29:07,122 --> 02:29:10,751
l want to talk to my mother once.

2125
02:29:13,795 --> 02:29:16,764
Shankar! Answer it,
Shankar. Come on!

2126
02:29:16,865 --> 02:29:18,765
Answer it, Shankar.

2127
02:29:23,304 --> 02:29:25,772
There are two stages
of treatment. One..

2128
02:29:26,875 --> 02:29:30,777
You can save anyone.
You have that power.

2129
02:29:32,881 --> 02:29:36,783
lntensive therapy for two months
with the use of four drugs.

2130
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:44,119
Go on!

2131
02:29:50,165 --> 02:29:51,792
l cannot say. l will not say.

2132
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,798
Did l treat anyone to say that?

2133
02:29:54,903 --> 02:29:56,962
Would l let Thomas die
if l am a doctor?

2134
02:29:57,071 --> 02:29:58,299
l don't know anything.

2135
02:29:58,406 --> 02:30:00,966
Shankar! Don't get excited.
Your answers are correct.

2136
02:30:01,075 --> 02:30:02,303
Sit down, Rafi!

2137
02:30:02,410 --> 02:30:07,814
Forget it, sir. l know how to treat
with the heart but not with drugs.

2138
02:30:07,916 --> 02:30:09,816
l am not eligible for that.

2139
02:30:10,018 --> 02:30:14,819
l know only to console
people in trouble.

2140
02:30:14,923 --> 02:30:18,825
l feel happy when they feel
happy for that brief while.

2141
02:30:20,028 --> 02:30:22,826
Let us stop this drama now.

2142
02:30:23,198 --> 02:30:25,325
To tell the truth l am
just a street thug.

2143
02:30:25,433 --> 02:30:28,334
l am a goon. l cheated
and passed the exam.

2144
02:30:28,436 --> 02:30:29,835
l cheated and came to this college.

2145
02:30:38,546 --> 02:30:39,843
Thomas died in these hands.

2146
02:30:41,382 --> 02:30:44,840
He called me God and said that
l had power to save him.

2147
02:30:46,387 --> 02:30:49,845
He pleaded with me to save his life.

2148
02:30:50,491 --> 02:30:54,860
But l couldn't do that since
l am not a doctor.

2149
02:31:01,569 --> 02:31:04,868
You all are doctors
with big degrees.

2150
02:31:04,973 --> 02:31:08,875
What more could you do than
being silent spectators?

2151
02:31:08,977 --> 02:31:12,879
You gave his dead body
back to his mother.

2152
02:31:13,248 --> 02:31:14,875
But you couldn't save him.

2153
02:31:17,585 --> 02:31:18,882
l am sorry, Thomas.

2154
02:31:44,112 --> 02:31:45,909
Remember one thing!

2155
02:31:46,281 --> 02:31:49,910
A doctor who cannot love his
patients is a patient himself.

2156
02:31:56,024 --> 02:31:59,926
From now the name Shankar shall
not be heard in this college.

2157
02:32:01,296 --> 02:32:02,923
C'mon, let's go back to our work.

2158
02:32:29,057 --> 02:32:33,960
Sri Ram!

2159
02:32:39,067 --> 02:32:40,967
Shankar!

2160
02:32:55,083 --> 02:32:59,986
Congratulations dad. You have won.

2161
02:33:01,356 --> 02:33:03,153
You threw Shankar out
because he caused..

2162
02:33:03,257 --> 02:33:04,986
..indiscipline to rise
in the hospital.

2163
02:33:07,095 --> 02:33:08,995
But it is not Shankar
that you threw out.

2164
02:33:34,122 --> 02:33:36,022
l am chief drug inspector
Venkat Rao.

2165
02:33:36,124 --> 02:33:38,183
The mother of deceased
cancer patient Thomas..

2166
02:33:38,292 --> 02:33:41,022
..complained that you are using
adulterated medicines..

2167
02:33:41,129 --> 02:33:44,030
..in your hospital and that
her son died because of that.

2168
02:33:50,138 --> 02:33:54,370
No. Such things can happen
anywhere else but not here.

2169
02:33:54,475 --> 02:33:56,033
Here is the post-mortem report.

2170
02:33:58,413 --> 02:34:00,381
We have orders to arrest the
head of this institute.

2171
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:01,539
Now you are under arrest.

2172
02:34:04,752 --> 02:34:06,049
We had better leave this place now.

2173
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:15,061
Greetings mother.
My name is Shankar.

2174
02:34:15,163 --> 02:34:16,391
l am a friend of Thomas.

2175
02:34:16,497 --> 02:34:20,058
He wanted to see you when he died.

2176
02:34:20,168 --> 02:34:24,070
He could not see you
for the last time.

2177
02:34:33,181 --> 02:34:34,409
Drive fast.

2178
02:34:38,786 --> 02:34:40,083
Listen to what we say.

2179
02:34:40,188 --> 02:34:45,091
Our dean was arrested since you
supplied these expired medicines.

2180
02:34:45,193 --> 02:34:47,684
Why worry? They won't come for us.

2181
02:34:47,795 --> 02:34:50,093
We are bribing them every month.

2182
02:34:50,198 --> 02:34:51,597
The vigilance people too
are with the police.

2183
02:34:51,699 --> 02:34:53,257
And we are selling the
actual medicines away..

2184
02:34:53,367 --> 02:34:55,426
..and using these in the hospital.

2185
02:34:55,536 --> 02:34:57,595
This is a huge fraud.

2186
02:34:57,705 --> 02:35:01,106
lf we are caught now, we have
to go to jail for life.

2187
02:35:01,476 --> 02:35:04,104
That's why l advise you
to flee this place.

2188
02:36:09,277 --> 02:36:11,177
lt has only six bullets.
They are over.

2189
02:36:11,379 --> 02:36:13,506
You can't even a count
but are a gang lord.

2190
02:36:14,549 --> 02:36:19,179
You sell expired medicines but
have come to expiry yourself.

2191
02:38:36,424 --> 02:38:38,483
Where will you escape,
you scoundrels?

2192
02:38:41,429 --> 02:38:42,487
Why are they catching me?

2193
02:38:42,596 --> 02:38:44,325
lt is Shankardada who
had them caught.

2194
02:38:44,432 --> 02:38:45,660
l mean brother Shankar.

2195
02:38:45,766 --> 02:38:47,324
l'm sorry.
- lt's ok.

2196
02:38:49,770 --> 02:38:51,829
Why waste time with dialogs?
Take them away.

2197
02:38:51,939 --> 02:38:54,339
Let's move.
- Great men!

2198
02:38:55,443 --> 02:38:59,345
Shankar you did a great job.
Thanks. - Welcome.

2199
02:39:03,451 --> 02:39:06,352
ATM! l too am leaving
for my village.

2200
02:39:06,454 --> 02:39:08,354
l brought you two tickets for that.

2201
02:39:08,556 --> 02:39:11,354
Why two?
- Don't you want to go?

2202
02:39:11,892 --> 02:39:13,689
Do you want to come too?

2203
02:39:14,462 --> 02:39:16,362
Who else do l have other than you?

2204
02:39:16,464 --> 02:39:19,365
l too am coming along.
- Good! Let's go.

2205
02:39:19,467 --> 02:39:22,527
But l cannot forget uncle
Lingam in my life.

2206
02:39:28,909 --> 02:39:32,367
l thought of him and his
figure appears before me!

2207
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:34,380
My imagination is powerful!

2208
02:39:34,482 --> 02:39:37,542
l too can see him.
- Did you think about him? - No.

2209
02:39:37,651 --> 02:39:40,381
How can you see him?
Let's check out.

2210
02:39:43,491 --> 02:39:48,724
Uncle! l mean sir, is it
true that you are here?

2211
02:39:48,829 --> 02:39:53,391
One vulture eats hundred buffaloes
and one cyclone finish!

2212
02:39:53,501 --> 02:39:55,401
These are your lines!

2213
02:39:55,936 --> 02:40:00,396
But you saved me and my
institute from ruin.

2214
02:40:00,941 --> 02:40:02,408
Thank you, Shankar.

2215
02:40:05,513 --> 02:40:09,415
Do you think that l am saying
sorry to you in private?

2216
02:40:11,519 --> 02:40:12,747
See there.

2217
02:40:28,068 --> 02:40:31,435
Sri Ram, l am overjoyed.

2218
02:40:31,539 --> 02:40:34,440
Shankar! See there.

2219
02:41:04,572 --> 02:41:09,475
l cheated you saying
that l was a doctor.

2220
02:41:09,577 --> 02:41:11,477
You are better than a doctor.

2221
02:41:11,579 --> 02:41:17,484
A doctor just saves lives.
You taught how to live.

2222
02:41:19,587 --> 02:41:22,488
That's why you have
such a fan following.

2223
02:41:23,591 --> 02:41:27,493
l am proud of you, my son.

2224
02:42:02,630 --> 02:42:04,530
Chitti has come for you. Go!

2225
02:42:06,634 --> 02:42:08,534
Go and talk to her.

2226
02:42:09,637 --> 02:42:13,539
Son-in-law, Chitti is waiting
for you upstairs.

2227
02:42:13,741 --> 02:42:17,541
Go!

2228
02:42:17,645 --> 02:42:19,545
Do you want me to use this stick?

2229
02:42:21,649 --> 02:42:22,707
Go!

2230
02:42:32,927 --> 02:42:35,555
Chitti!
- Shankar!

2231
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:42,898
Chitti, is it you?
- Yes.

2232
02:42:43,003 --> 02:42:45,563
l mistook you for someone else.

2233
02:42:45,673 --> 02:42:47,072
l sometimes wear saris.

2234
02:42:48,676 --> 02:42:50,075
Now l wore it for you.

2235
02:42:51,679 --> 02:42:54,580
Does it look nice?
- Very good.

2236
02:42:54,682 --> 02:42:56,582
Why did you call me up?

2237
02:42:57,217 --> 02:42:58,582
No one wants to marry me.

2238
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:01,585
Will you?

2239
02:43:04,224 --> 02:43:07,591
You marry someone else.
- Why?

2240
02:43:07,695 --> 02:43:10,596
Because l love someone else.
- Who is she?

2241
02:43:14,702 --> 02:43:17,933
lt is your friend Sunita.

2242
02:43:18,973 --> 02:43:21,100
Marry her then!

2243
02:43:23,811 --> 02:43:28,942
Sunita! What about Chitti?

2244
02:43:29,049 --> 02:43:31,609
They both are one and the same!

2245
02:43:31,719 --> 02:43:35,621
lt means you all fooled
me all these days.

2246
02:43:36,724 --> 02:43:42,629
Shankar.. are you upset?
- Yes.

2247
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:44,630
Do you want Jantar
Mantar Choo Mantar?

2248
02:43:48,736 --> 02:43:50,636
Come to me then.
- No.

2249
02:43:51,739 --> 02:43:53,969
Do you want me to come?
- Yes.
