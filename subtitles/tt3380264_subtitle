00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:53,916
a  <font color="#ffff00">KHomeny007</font> - <font color="#00ff00">TUT</font> <font color="#ff0000">~ Presentation ~</font>

2
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:37,292
You were right Tutu...

3
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,042
...a swine should stick
to feasting on just crap.

4
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,792
Trying a cake, will give it
nothing but diarrhoea.

5
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:47,167
It's recording, by the way

6
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,417
Bloody hell... who'll tell me,
your father?

7
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,542
Ya, but the picture is black-black.

8
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:55,167
Remove the cover na, oaf!

9
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:58,542
Now?

10
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,501
Ya, but earlier it was all black...
But now it is black and white...

11
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:03,751
But you can see now?

12
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,167
Ya", yap away!

13
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,667
Hi. Myself Dev.

14
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,001
Dev... stick to Hindi,
so you can actually talk...

15
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:18,626
...and we can understand.

16
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:21,126
Atta boy.

17
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:24,917
Hello.

18
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,917
I am Dev... and this is my best friend

19
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,417
Tutu.

20
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,542
And we are both...

21
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:40,417
Rascals

22
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:59,167
Hey, open the gate... hey open it,
it's the Minister

23
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,751
Sir, the train is about to come...

24
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,126
Open it man.. open it!

25
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,292
We are getting late you fool...

26
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,667
...you want me to get out
there and tell you?

27
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:09,917
Oye, don't open it.
Do you want get Mr. Minister killed?

28
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,167
lam stuck in the middle man.

29
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:14,167
My words must sting
you right now sir.

30
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:18,167
But just imagine, the gate
opens and your car crosses...

31
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:20,542
...and it stalls right
in the middle of the tracks...

32
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:21,917
...just then the train comes!

33
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,542
Have you thought about it?

34
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,667
Like a lamb to the slaughter!

35
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,042
Someone gag this foul-mouthed fool...

36
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,667
hey, HEY, HEY!

37
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:35,751
Stay away... No touching...
Even I am in politics.

38
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:37,792
Will you shut up
only when I kill you?

39
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,042
Okay bro... raise the crossing...
The minister has to leave us.

40
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,667
Be alert, the whistle is blowing.

41
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,917
Your ticket has been cut,
up you will be going.

42
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,876
I will blow your whistle.

43
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:56,626
Leave me!

44
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,792
I, Surra Pehelwan promise
you this. Bring this prick in.

45
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,626
Why did we turn out like this?

46
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:35,542
The fact is,
if Gandhi was born to Hitler...

47
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:40,042
...he wouldn't be Gandhi,
he would be a Nazi.

48
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,876
Meaning my dear,
a child can be born anywhere...

49
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,792
...but the place he was raised in,
decides what he becomes.

50
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,667
No one knows where we were born...

51
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,542
...but we were found
in a garbage can...

52
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,417
...getting our faces
licked by stray dogs.

53
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:19,626
Bhaiyaji raised us

54
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,876
So, we grew up to be Bhaiyaji's own.

55
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,001
We grew up on gunshots,
instead of lullabies.

56
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,001
At an age when should've picked
up pencils, we picked up pistols.

57
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,917
Instead of A for Apple, B for Ball

58
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,042
We picked up M for murder
and C for crime.

59
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,626
Till the age of 13, we endured pain

60
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:12,542
At 15...

61
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,376
...we started giving it back...

62
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,167
And at 18...

63
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:31,792
...we had our first taste of blood.

64
00:05:57,251 --> 00:06:00,376
Even a dog barks for you if you
feed him a bone and pet his tummy...

65
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,001
So, we always bark for Bhaiyaji.

66
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:06,792
Ya, and we bite for him too.

67
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:12,667
Two shadows descend
upon a tarry road

68
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:17,376
Each breastfed on gulps of blood

69
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,876
Bastard children
of the night, perhaps

70
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:26,667
Abandoned by earth,
orphaned by the skies...

71
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:31,042
Their story, this,
a tale of crumpled lives.

72
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:17,126
Look... a silly star in the sky,

73
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:23,417
Stuck forever, the poor guy.

74
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:29,917
This sorry earth, spinning dizzy,

75
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:37,292
Twists and turns all day,
just to get by.

76
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,417
We too, must not get

77
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:43,876
Stuck in between

78
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:47,626
Stop this spinning!

79
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:53,251
Life's too short, to just be living

80
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:57,792
So, my friend... my fellow king

81
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:07,167
Live, & die,

82
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,917
because tomorrow is just a lie

83
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,917
All we have is today!

84
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:15,292
K - K - KILL - da Dil
K - K - KILL - da Dil

85
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:22,251
K - K - KILL - da Dil
K - K - KILL - da Dil

86
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,667
Life makes you pay dearly,

87
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,501
It's such a raw deal

88
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,001
It's a long, bumpy truck ride,

89
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,417
And there's never a free meal

90
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,376
Even these breaths we borrow

91
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,542
will escape us tomorrow.

92
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,167
We seek a home, around every bend,

93
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,917
Only the road knows,
where it will end.

94
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,292
So live it up

95
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,417
A day or two,

96
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,042
More or less.

97
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,792
Let's drink up

98
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:34,792
Buddy, even if it's our tears...

99
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,251
Friends & friendships

100
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,126
Will last forever,

101
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,876
This stream of stars,

102
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,501
Will shine, wherever

103
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,251
Cause mate, the shiniest
of all of them is you...

104
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:06,792
K - K - KILL - da Dil
K - K - KILL - da Dil

105
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:15,292
K - K - KILL - da Dil
K - K - KILL - da Dil

106
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:10,626
If we didn't have to peel these nuts,
and there were no 'lfs & Buts'...

107
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,501
...life would have been so simple.

108
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,042
Namaste Bhaiyaji!

109
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:19,876
Just water,
or something with some water.

110
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:22,042
Today, it has to be
with some water Bhaiyaji.

111
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:28,167
Meaning Minister Surra Pehelwan
has ascended from earth.

112
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,917
More like nailed to it. With
a 100 grams of hot lead inside him.

113
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,167
Why're you so sad Batuk?

114
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,667
Couldn't steal candy
from the kids today?

115
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:46,126
One day show them,
what you're made of.

116
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,126
But get me a napkin first.

117
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:58,626
Good show.

118
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:02,542
Bhaiyaji, It's just a good time.

119
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,667
It's good that the times are good.

120
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,417
Bhaiyaji, you're always spoiling us.

121
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:28,501
Tell me...

122
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,792
...do people turn into stars
after they die?

123
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,292
That's what the living seem to think

124
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,417
So how many of these
stars did we 'make'?

125
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,251
11... counting today's kill.

126
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:48,417
Dude, that guy must still be enroute...
he wouldn't reach that fast.

127
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,001
Look at him go... our Star.

128
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,292
Okay, so tell me...

129
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,542
...how many of these
must be rascals?

130
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,542
Rascals?

131
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:05,042
Only 2.

132
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:07,542
You...

133
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:09,876
...and I.

134
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,292
Here, stamp me!

135
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,001
Sir, stags are not allowed

136
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,876
Sir, there don't have stags.

137
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,917
No problem,
we only want whiskey. Stamp!

138
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,001
No problem, we only
want whiskey. Stamp me!

139
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,667
Sir... men alone are not allowed.

140
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:32,167
Men alone! Should've got aunty along

141
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:38,667
Sir! This man wants to say something
to you. ls he allowed in?

142
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,417
He is the father...
everyone's father!!

143
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,417
Who let the dogs out...

144
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:56,042
Dude, I don't get these songs.

145
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,626
If you ear's are numb,
chew some gum.

146
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,417
What would you like to order sir?

147
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,417
Yaar, get me some beer-sheer.

148
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,792
Pitcher or mug?

149
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,126
No pictures.

150
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,667
Get us one bottle with two glasses.

151
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,001
Now race like a bullet
and fetch like an arrow.

152
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:09,917
Ok sir.

153
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,792
Who let the dogs out...

154
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,626
Atta boy!

155
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,042
Bro, she's coming here.

156
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,876
Dude, English... talk in English.

157
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,376
Arre Uncle... why bore a hole
through that menu card...

158
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:56,667
...just for a few glimpses...

159
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,042
...here, stare all you want...

160
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,667
...after all isn't this,
why we girls deck up...

161
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:04,876
...so that 'young at heart'
leeches like you can lech at us...

162
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:05,917
No?

163
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:08,042
Prick!

164
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:11,792
Sorry... sister.

165
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:15,667
That's a sparkling
Diwali firecracker.

166
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:17,251
Oye Uncleji!

167
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,292
Happy Diwali.

168
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,376
Bro that chick is too sweet.

169
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:32,792
Sorry.

170
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,042
Yup, and she is always
giving off heat.

171
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,292
What the hell are you doing?

172
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,376
Dude, that idiot's pulled out a gun.

173
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,751
He's showing off, won't fire.

174
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,876
Let be dude,
you don't know how to fire

175
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,501
And you're an expert
on shooting guns?

176
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:03,167
Bloody lady-fingers, you don't need
fingers to shoot, you need guts.

177
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,667
I've been shooting guns...

178
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:06,042
...since the time you weren't
even inside your mother...

179
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,376
...you were still inside
your father.

180
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,042
Now you wanna get out or get done?

181
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,167
Buzz off or I'll
turn you into a star.

182
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:28,042
Thank God you intervened otherwise
anything could have happened.

183
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:29,542
Thanks.

184
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:32,292
This calls for a hug...

185
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:38,792
Thanks.

186
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:40,167
Yeah...

187
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,792
It's a good thing I came,
or anything could've happened.

188
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:51,751
What was the matter?

189
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:55,167
Nothing... we were dancing
and he felt me up here...

190
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,167
...so I felt him up some here...

191
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,292
...just a little harder than him...
did I do any wrong?

192
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,167
Not at all...
just repaid with interest.

193
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,167
O great grandson of Nero.

194
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,792
Hello friend!...

195
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,292
Rome is in flames... shall we leave?

196
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,917
Because of you
the club has shut down.

197
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,167
Why don't you guys
come over to our place?

198
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:15,251
w-w-wh-what?

199
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,042
Just come with us...

200
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:20,626
We were anyway heading
to his place for an 'after-party'

201
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:22,542
No, we've a little work to do.

202
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:23,542
Thank you.

203
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:24,542
Come on.

204
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,292
My life must be worth
2-3 drinks at the least...

205
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:28,917
...just think of it that way.

206
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,167
- No...
- Why not...

207
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:33,751
Awesome!

208
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,292
So come!

209
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:40,167
Why not... you're a big hero,
aren't you... Watch out.

210
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,042
It's all right

211
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:51,751
Wow! ls this your's?

212
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:53,376
It is for now.

213
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:54,501
Can I ride?

214
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,042
If you can start it,
you can ride it.

215
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,167
One of you can come in my car.

216
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,292
That'll be me...

217
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,542
You can take the highway to hell.

218
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:14,917
Take care.

219
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:16,251
I said...

220
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,917
Dev's hanging with such dumbasses.

221
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,417
Arre I was getting free booze...

222
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,501
...forget those dumbasses, I would've
gone with 'this' dumb-ass too.

223
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,167
I love bullets.

224
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:32,417
Whaat?

225
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:37,042
Arre why are you being a girl...
you can sit closer.

226
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:44,751
By god... what a scent.

227
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,292
So what were you saying?

228
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,792
I love Bullet... bikes.

229
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,042
Even we love bullets...
firing them... riding them.

230
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,292
- Can I ask you a question?
- You can ask two.

231
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,042
You felt no fear
when you saw the gun?

232
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:01,792
Fear... huh...
Fear is afraid of us madam.

233
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,501
Thank god I didn't fear...

234
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:07,042
If I did, I would be going
home with Tutu, and not you.

235
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,251
You could've gotten shot.

236
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:15,042
There's no bullet in the world
that can touch this body madam.

237
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,667
It's better I get shot than you...

238
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,376
The bugger is flirting.

239
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,042
Did I overdo it...?

240
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,417
Did you say something?

241
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,417
- Nope.
- Then say something na...

242
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,376
You look like a ruffian,
but you are quite sweet.

243
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,251
If only you knew the reality...
you'd drop dead madam.

244
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,792
Thank you.

245
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,167
Ask me something else na.

246
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,542
Jenny, Chimsy, Pratty...
and I am Disha.

247
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:51,167
All that is fine...
but where's the wine?

248
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,167
That way.

249
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,126
You know if he doesn't get his
booze on time, he gets a hangover.

250
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:56,876
The bar is open guys.

251
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:58,751
Oh bar! Bar is open.

252
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,001
Got you to the right place,
didn't I?

253
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,417
Will you take it with water?

254
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,876
I think my mouth's watering
enough... I'll take just the alcohol.

255
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:06,792
Cheers guys!

256
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:11,542
So do all of you guys just keep
blowing away your dad's riches?

257
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,251
Dad's... we're blowing away our own!

258
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:15,751
You guys earn your own?

259
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,542
It doesn't look like you guys do!

260
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:22,042
Ya! Jenny's a chain snatcher,
Chimsy's a pickpocket...

261
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:24,917
Pratty and I drug people,
and pull off train robberies.

262
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,917
Well, that makes us sharpshooters.

263
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,292
Anyway, Jenny's a doctor...

264
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,792
Chimsy's a singer and
Pratty has his own business.

265
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:39,542
You did not ask about us?

266
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,876
How can we resist, when you insist?

267
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:45,292
lam Dev and this is my
best friend, Tutu.

268
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:46,626
Hi

269
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:47,376
Hello!

270
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:48,792
So what do you guys do?

271
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,001
- We're murd...
- Mur... Marketers...

272
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,876
Boss gives the targets,
we finish them.

273
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:57,917
What kind of targets?

274
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:02,542
Targets of all kinds... they can
be thin, fat, small, large... anything

275
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,417
You didn't say what do you do?

276
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,542
Are you serving it
with the frying pan?!

277
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,417
P ratty!

278
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:10,501
He's always fingering the hot stuff.

279
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,292
You didn't say what do you do?

280
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,042
Are you okay? I am so Sorry.

281
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,417
Uh huh... you know
what they say in films...

282
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,001
'In Friendship... there's
No sorry & No thank you'

283
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:25,542
Take your time...
there are still 3-4 bottles left.

284
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,626
Ex convicts, who've served their
time... I help rehabilitate them.

285
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,167
You help what 'tate' them?

286
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,917
I get them normal jobs, carpenters,
tailors, plumbers, whatever...

287
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:37,751
Why?

288
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,251
Why?

289
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,917
So they don't go
back to a life of crime.

290
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:47,042
Let's go?

291
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,167
We must go

292
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:51,417
...thank you!

293
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:54,917
What happened?

294
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:56,751
Okay!

295
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,042
Are you sleeping?

296
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,792
Nope... I'm thinking...

297
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:11,042
Such a cute girl that Disha is...
but she has such a dangerous job...

298
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,167
We have a more dangerous job...

299
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,292
we're just not that cute.

300
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:19,626
I mean, look at that Jenny...

301
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:20,792
...she's a doctor!

302
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,542
Bloody who can tell what a person
is by just looking at them.

303
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,417
So do we look like sharpshooters?

304
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:26,167
Yup.

305
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:34,001
Okay tell me,
what If I was a doctor?

306
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:38,042
You'd still be killing
people my child... even then.

307
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,001
...even then.

308
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,876
Here my sleepy lion!

309
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,917
At least wash it man, now
even the tea tastes like whiskey.

310
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,917
It is the chick's text...

311
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,167
...she's thanking me again
for saving her life.

312
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,542
Prick, you've taken her number also

313
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:17,167
If the giver has no problem,
why should the receiver...

314
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,292
...and why should
the receiver's friend?!

315
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,167
Now?

316
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,417
This is the first time
a decent girl's texted me.

317
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,792
I have to give a fitting
reply... something classy.

318
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,751
I'm going to say...

319
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:37,417
'where there is a damsel in crisis,
a true macho man rises'!

320
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:44,042
Dude, just quietly send her one of
those corny internet, forward jokes.

321
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,167
Decent or indecent?

322
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,251
That's up to you.

323
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,417
I'll send her a 'yo mama is so fat...'

324
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:53,667
go...go...gone!

325
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:16,667
Dude what is this 'Lo
'

326
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,751
Lol?... meaning L O and L again?

327
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:27,001
Yes, Lol! Look.

328
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:31,501
ls she mad at me?

329
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:33,751
Come let's check it!

330
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,167
Hurry, and quickly search
what does this mean, please.

331
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,167
Then you only tell me.

332
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:55,167
LOL means Laugh Out Loud.

333
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:57,167
When someone likes a joke
or a forward, that makes laugh hard,

334
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:59,167
they send a message saying LOL.

335
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:01,417
LOL

336
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,251
The chick is laughing...

337
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:15,876
Oye should I send her
the one with cats and dogs?

338
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,417
There's a hundred of them...

339
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:21,042
Dude, where the cat is in front
and the dog is behind...go...go

340
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,126
No no no, my child...

341
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,042
Go...gone!

342
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:47,167
Incoming! Stop stop stop...

343
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:50,876
What's coming?

344
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,376
Oye... what is Rofl now?

345
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,042
Turn back...

346
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,167
ROFL means Rolling
on The Floor with Laughter.

347
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,251
When someone is in
splits they are in ROFL.

348
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,001
ROFL!!!

349
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,626
Fill it up... just fill it up!

350
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,292
Who is this villain?!

351
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:20,917
Is he a lover?!...
Is he a lover?!...

352
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,917
No! He is a brother...
He is a brother...

353
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:30,167
Will you even kiss her
through this telescope?

354
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:45,751
Why'd you stop it... play na!

355
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,417
And now from downtown,
we have Sunny,

356
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,292
Manny and Fanny and their
daddy Shaad Ali wanna hear

357
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,876
Adnan Sami sing this
song from the film SWEETA,

358
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:58,542
music by Shankar Ehsan Loy
and lyrics by Gulzar!

359
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:04,292
I can tell by the
look in these eyes,

360
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:07,792
There is a gentle kindness in them

361
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,917
We don't need a place to meet in,

362
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:15,251
If your arms could take me in.

363
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:20,042
My eyes have gotten
a taste of your eyes.

364
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:24,376
I tuck its sweetness away;
it engulfs my insides.

365
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,292
Chocolate pieces,

366
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,042
Your lips feel like,

367
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,001
Honey-tipped slices sweetaa

368
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,792
Nothing could taste any sweeter!

369
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:45,751
Sweeta... O Sweeta!

370
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,251
Nothing could taste any sweeter.

371
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:57,167
Sweeta... O Sweeta!

372
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:01,001
Nothing could taste any sweeter.

373
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:12,251
My heart is kidding me again,

374
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:16,376
Scoffs at my plight and my pain

375
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:20,251
It's racing my pulses against me,

376
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:24,167
It's about to be bitten again.

377
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,667
Hypnotized by this dreamy
haze, I stay

378
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:33,001
Every day, to me & myself, I say

379
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:35,167
In sweltering desert,

380
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,001
You're the holy sherbet,

381
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,042
You're a soul quencher sweetaaa

382
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,167
Dear Sweeta!

383
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,667
Turn the volume down...

384
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:47,001
Okay.

385
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:55,042
Nothing could taste sweeter!

386
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:18,501
Arre you! Here?

387
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:21,292
Ho HO ho... you! Here?

388
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,001
Were you following me?

389
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,042
Arre No.

390
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,376
Tell me the truth,
I won't say a word.

391
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,001
You got me.

392
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,501
You wanted to see who I meet...?

393
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,417
Where do I go?
Do I have a boyfriend or no?

394
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:39,792
Any problem madam?

395
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:40,792
What's your problem?

396
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,792
But how did you catch me?

397
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:49,501
Does this cook book
have recipes to fool people?

398
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:53,042
I should go.

399
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:55,251
Wait!...

400
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:58,667
Coffee?

401
00:30:59,042 --> 00:30:59,542
No.

402
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:00,876
Why not?

403
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,751
You've worked so hard,
you've earned one coffee.

404
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:12,042
So Mr. Dev... what's
your plan for this evening?

405
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,542
It's wonderful...

406
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:17,042
You said coffee,
so I am here at coffee...

407
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,001
...if you say 'come home' then
I'll come to your home.

408
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,042
And what if I say
'I want to slap you'?

409
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:22,667
Then I will head to my home.

410
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,542
What do you call an Indian girl...

411
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:33,417
...who pushes her
father off the roof?

412
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,667
Tell me

413
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,292
You tell me?

414
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:44,167
Push...Pa.

415
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:45,667
Pushmpa!

416
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,001
What a name.

417
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,876
That's so LOL Bhaiyaji!

418
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,042
ROFL... that was ROFL.

419
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,751
Enough of clowning...

420
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,542
...shall we work?

421
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:17,917
He looks familiar Bhaiyaji.

422
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:22,042
Mr. Gulabchand.

423
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,042
He's the jeweller on market street.

424
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,042
Didn't we get this
chain from his shop?

425
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:33,167
The prick ripped us off,
today we set it straight.

426
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,626
Just need to threaten him first...

427
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,626
...if he refuses to pay...

428
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:43,417
...then make him pay.

429
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,917
Okay! Done, got it Bhaiyaji...

430
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:48,876
See you.

431
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:59,042
Bhaiyaji, enough of this hack jobs,
gimme a chance for something big.

432
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:06,751
- Will you have soda?
- No.

433
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:09,917
I will have some.

434
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,501
What a surprise Chimsy, what's up?

435
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:20,042
We're throwing Disha a surprise
birthday party tonight.

436
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,042
She'll like it if you guys come.

437
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,667
Even we will like it.

438
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,667
But do you mean it
or are you just being polite?

439
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:29,167
Arre you saved our lives,
of course we mean it.

440
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:30,417
When should we surface?

441
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,126
Everyone will be there by 11.30

442
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,001
We'll finish work by 11 right?

443
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,251
Ya, we will be there
as soon as we finish

444
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,376
Dude, it's 10 already...

445
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:50,167
Oye Clint Eastwood... no one's called,
we still need to buy Disha a gift.

446
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,542
Man, you never got me
a gift on my birthday.

447
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,626
Did you ever invite me
to a birthday party?

448
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:58,876
C'mon man, this is the first
time a nice girl's invited me.

449
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,167
A gift is a must bro!

450
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:01,167
ummmm... ummmm..

451
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,542
If you need to piss, go ahead...

452
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,167
...it will wash along
with your blood tomorrow.

453
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:07,626
UIT1ITTITIIT1... ITTITTITIIT1HITTITTIT1ITTITI

454
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:16,751
Spit it out.

455
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:23,667
Whatever gift you want, just take it
from here na... free of charge

456
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:26,542
Man, we are hunters,
not lowly punters...

457
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:27,792
free of charge...

458
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:31,292
So let's buy it bro, outside
everyone must have shut shop

459
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,667
So tell me Sir, do you
have something nice?

460
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:41,042
We've earrings, anklets, 'Bindis',
Toe rings... lockets... pendants...

461
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,167
It really depends on
what your budget is... and...

462
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,251
...making charges
will be extra please!

463
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,042
What'

 I get in 5?

464
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,751
- Thousand or lacs?
- Thousand.

465
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:58,417
For that much you'll not even
get the gold dust for the earrings.

466
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:02,001
You can look somewhere
else please... I'm sorry.

467
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,667
Oh, sorry please...

468
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:07,292
Can you give me bangles for 15?

469
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:12,167
Okay... meet me half way...
let's shake on 20!

470
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,042
20!

471
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:18,167
It's a pair... for both the hands...
Please free my hands also...

472
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,417
And if we don't want to give 20?

473
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,501
You only have to decide...

474
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,417
...if you're hunters or punters.

475
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:31,042
ls it?!

476
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,417
Both the options are open, I mean!

477
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:36,542
We're here to rip him open...
and he's ripping us off...

478
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:38,501
Very good!

479
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,417
Not a word.

480
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:43,292
Yes Bhaiyaji!

481
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:45,667
Now?

482
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:47,542
Now meaning?

483
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:48,917
Okay Bhaiyaji.

484
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:55,042
No man... Sorry... sir...

485
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:57,042
Shut your ears

486
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,251
Please let me go sir...

487
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,751
You messed with us,
we messed with you... score settled.

488
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:14,292
Money sir?

489
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,917
50 lacs... the cost of your life...

490
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,251
...and this 20 thousand
are making charges...

491
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:21,542
...extra.

492
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:23,501
Okay.

493
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:32,417
Sir, if you could untie me...

494
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:41,292
My child... itchy are we?

495
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:43,042
How did you guess sir?

496
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,626
Cause you're scratching me,
instead of yourself.

497
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,042
Oh! No wonder,
I wasn't getting any relief.

498
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,626
Have you never given
someone a surprise?

499
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:57,167
Oho don't ask... we've surprised
people in the toilet...

500
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:01,417
...behind curtains, from
above lifts... and from where not...

501
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,667
We've surprised people...

502
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:06,542
...so much that they could no longer
celebrate their birthday at all.

503
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,876
Wow yaar!
Even I want such a surprise.

504
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,876
May god grant you your wish.

505
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:21,001
SURPRISE!

506
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:30,042
Oh my God. Even you guys.

507
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,251
Happy budday!

508
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,126
Thank you... How sweet!

509
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:37,917
Happy budday... from Tutu's side too!

510
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,251
And... Happy Budday,
from both our sides.

511
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:42,501
Surprise!

512
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:47,917
Very sweet! Thank you

513
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,167
Thank you so much.

514
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:53,667
Will you have something?

515
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:56,501
We'll have enough to
equal the cost of the gift.

516
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:01,042
- You guys are so funny.
- We are just god-gifted.

517
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,667
Disha, guess what? Sam is here!

518
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,376
Come, you have to meet him, come!

519
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:06,667
Sorry, I'll just come

520
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:15,792
Why is your friend so lost?

521
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:21,001
Cause he doesn't have a girlfriend.
That's why!

522
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:25,626
And why are you always so chirpy?

523
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,626
Cause I don't have a girlfriend.
That's why!

524
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:33,001
Disha come! Cake is ready!

525
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,001
- Come guys
-Come

526
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,001
Come!

527
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:59,417
Happy budday to you

528
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:09,667
Happy happy budday to you...

529
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:28,167
Hey baby, here's a charm
to guard your sweet sixteen

530
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:35,667
Please! Always stay
this nubile little teen.

531
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,792
You'll only grow younger,

532
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,626
Cause age is just a number,

533
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,876
And we can continue our rendezvous...

534
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:50,001
Happy budday to you

535
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,917
Happy happy budday to you...

536
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:57,126
Lock up every Tom, Dick & Harry, but

537
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:00,251
Why are we lovers under curfew?

538
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,917
Sadday... Vadday...
C'mon on your b'day

539
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,417
Happy... shappy...
Happy Shappy badday

540
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:12,126
Sadday... Vadday...
C'mon on your b'day

541
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:14,001
Happy... shappy...

542
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,667
Happy budday to you...

543
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:38,792
If a suitor, was to totter,

544
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:41,251
Knockin at your door,

545
00:40:41,376 --> 00:40:43,917
Ring no bells,
roll no drums & no wedding band

546
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:48,001
hey hey hey

547
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:51,667
If this caller, was to holler,

548
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,626
Empty handed,

549
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:57,042
wear no rings,
cut no cakes & no first dance

550
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,667
You're no Juliet... True that!

551
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:04,542
You're no Eve... True that!

552
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,167
He was no Adam either... True that!

553
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:07,751
La La La

554
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:11,167
But, a Romeo, he was to you

555
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:16,376
Oye happy... Oye Shappy

556
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:20,667
Happy budday to you

557
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:24,126
Happy happy budday to you...

558
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,417
Lock up every Tom, Dick & Harry, but

559
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,042
Why are we lovers under curfew?

560
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,626
Sadday... Vadday...
C'mon on your b'day

561
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:39,292
Happy... shappy...
Happy Shappy badday

562
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:43,001
Sadday... Vadday...
C'mon on your b'day

563
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,792
Happy... Shappy...

564
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,667
Happy budday to you...

565
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,917
By the way, how old
have your turned today?

566
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:04,292
Forty

567
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:05,626
Wow!

568
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:10,667
You've really maintained yourelf,
you don't look a day over 25.

569
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:13,292
Are you flirting with me?

570
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:18,376
No, I'm just trying to flirt.

571
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:24,001
I hope you don't fall for me.
I'm a hard nut to crack.

572
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:27,376
lam just...

573
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:41,501
You're a naive puppy when
it comes to love... but you're sweet.

574
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:43,792
Take care, farewell...

575
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,542
eat well, sleep on time...

576
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:51,667
...and do write in.

577
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:03,917
God knows what tomorrow
will bring, but you take care.

578
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,876
Best birthday ever!

579
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:12,917
Love, had happened to him.

580
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:15,042
How did you come to know?

581
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,417
It was all over your face,
you donkey...

582
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:22,167
...and when a man falls in love,
he starts looking like a donkey.

583
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:26,626
You were my son till today...

584
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:29,417
...now you're a son of this soil.

585
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,667
Answer the call of this soil...

586
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:44,626
Jai Hind!

587
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:49,001
We regret this war has claimed
so many lives...

588
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,167
...but trust me neither of the two
governments want this war.

589
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:56,292
MONSTER! You're a monster!

590
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,126
- How do you like it?
- It was nice.

591
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:12,417
Was? There's still an hour to go.

592
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:15,042
It's a bore.

593
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,167
Then let's go somewhere else.

594
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,042
Speak the truth,
it'll serve you well.

595
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,167
Yes, Madam.

596
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,001
Namaste Bhaiyaji.

597
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,667
This is the first time
I've seen you alone.

598
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:41,501
No Bhaiyaji we had too
much to drink last night so...

599
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:43,126
So much that...

600
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:46,792
...you're still hungover at night?

601
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:50,542
I hope Dev's not on
some other intoxicant.

602
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,917
No Bhaiyaji, nothing like that.
lam with him.

603
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:56,792
- Bhaiyaji dinner?
- You guys eat... I don't want to.

604
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:05,001
Look... you're older than him...

605
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:08,417
...take care of him...

606
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:09,542
Okay Bhaiyaji

607
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,501
...and of this guy.

608
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:21,667
Really? That's killer!

609
00:45:24,917 --> 00:45:25,542
Mom...

610
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:28,292
Ya mom?

611
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:32,042
No don't wait for me, I'll eat out.

612
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:34,167
No... you eat.

613
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:38,751
Does your mom also worry so much?

614
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:40,251
If I had one, she probably would.

615
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:42,792
Oh! I am sorry.

616
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:44,501
It's okay!

617
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:48,792
Tell me?

618
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,751
Do you mind if someone else
shares the table with us?

619
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:57,042
- It's cool?
- Ya, it's cool.

620
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:00,001
Yo, kiddo...?

621
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,376
- Ya?
- Do you want bread?

622
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:04,042
Sit.

623
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,251
Mr. Waiter, take the
gentleman's order.

624
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:15,542
Curry, Bread and butter milk...

625
00:46:16,876 --> 00:46:18,626
No! A milkshake.

626
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:20,001
Milkshake!!!

627
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:21,626
Milkshake, haan?

628
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:24,292
Listen, now don't interrupt,
when grown ups talk.

629
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:32,042
Sir, do you mind if someone
else shares the table with us?

630
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:33,917
Do you mind?

631
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,751
I don't mind at all

632
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,917
Not at all.

633
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:38,667
Binno!

634
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:49,042
0 Mr. Waiter,
take the lady's order too.

635
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,542
Look when grown ups are talking...

636
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:51,917
I won't interrupt them.

637
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,542
Okay, see you soon.

638
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:22,042
Why? You're afraid of asking me
if you can drop me home?

639
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:25,667
- So, I'll drop you home.
- So, come.

640
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:31,167
Can I ask you something else?

641
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:32,917
If you can start it,
you can drive it.

642
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,167
By God! You're god... gifted.

643
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:44,792
How much is it for?

644
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:48,501
You were my son till today... Son?

645
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:53,167
You were my son till today...

646
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,167
...now you're the son of this soil...

647
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:58,042
...what a play dude

648
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,417
Can we go tomorrow again?

649
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,501
No man, the play was lame.

650
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:03,542
If it wasn't for Disha,
I would've left earlier.

651
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:07,542
If it wasn't for Disha, I wouldn't
have gone to Bhaiyaji's alone.

652
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:09,167
What're you saying man.

653
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,542
You're not in love, are you?

654
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:18,417
Bhaiyaji's not offended, is he?

655
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,917
He will be, if you don't
come tomorrow to meet him

656
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:25,667
Why won't l. Chill man... chill...

657
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:28,917
...chchchchill chill.

658
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:57,167
Sorry Sir!

659
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:01,917
Don't you think Chimsy will look
exactly like this when he grows old?

660
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:05,251
Bro I'm feeling bad,
let's put some shades on him...

661
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:07,167
Here, please put them on.

662
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:10,042
Wait a second.

663
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:13,376
Okay.

664
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,792
Can I have my shades back?
You won't feel bad no?

665
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:44,667
You're lit like the moon today,
my firecracker.

666
00:49:44,876 --> 00:49:47,751
I hope Bhaiyaji doesn't
light a match and set you off.

667
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:49,626
Handsome!

668
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:53,376
Hello.

669
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:54,792
You won't wish me Happy Diwali?

670
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,251
Happy Diwali!

671
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:57,626
You won't meet and wish me?

672
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:58,667
Get home in a jiffy.

673
00:49:58,876 --> 00:49:59,501
But Disha I...

674
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:02,376
I, if & but can wait till tomorrow.

675
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,792
You're the life of every party,
and I don't want a boring party.

676
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:07,792
You have to be there okay? Final!

677
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:10,042
Thank you sir!

678
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,417
C'mon bro, we're late!

679
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:14,542
I'm going over to Disha's

680
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:18,917
Have you lost it?

681
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,042
You know what you're doing?

682
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:32,167
Dev!

683
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:36,167
A mongrel can chase
a car as long as he wants...

684
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:38,001
...he'll never get to ride inside...

685
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,876
...and what's giving you this air?

686
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:44,792
Just because she hugged you once...

687
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:49,042
...she's sweet to everybody, don't
assume she's in love with you...

688
00:50:50,376 --> 00:50:52,792
...and for a second let's
believe she does love you...

689
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:57,042
...it's only till she finds out
the truth about you.

690
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:01,417
The day she finds out 'what you are'
she won't even spit in your face.

691
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:04,376
Dev!

692
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:10,626
I know, you know all of this...

693
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:18,542
...do you or don't you?!

694
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:21,042
I'm leaving

695
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:51,042
When your own sparkler shies away
from home, and shines for others...

696
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:56,292
...then we've got a problem!

697
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:02,292
She's just a friend Bhaiyaji.

698
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,042
And I...

699
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,042
I'm his father...

700
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:14,792
Father.

701
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,042
Mom, vermilion.

702
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:44,251
I have started liking you...

703
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:47,792
...dunno why but, I think I have.

704
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:05,167
Bol Beliya...
Tell me Beliya... Bol Beliya

705
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:09,042
Bol Beliya... Tell me Beliya...
Bol Beliya

706
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,167
When he passes

707
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:17,876
these streets today,

708
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,751
Light a candle,

709
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:27,417
At your doorway

710
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,292
Fling the doors open

711
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,501
He might return home

712
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:37,042
Let him not lose his way,

713
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,542
If he finds his way home.

714
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,042
Let no one sleep tonight,

715
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:49,126
Let's bathe these streets in light.

716
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:58,667
Let's make him stay this time.

717
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:18,751
When you passed

718
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:23,292
these streets today,

719
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:28,376
Even, the candle-lights,

720
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:32,542
Couldn't believe their eyes.

721
00:54:36,292 --> 00:54:40,292
He's trekked home
for a hundred light years

722
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:45,251
These eyes are numb,
the heart swells with tears

723
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:48,542
Let no one sleep tonight,

724
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:55,042
Let's bathe these streets in light.

725
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:04,292
Let's make him stay this time.

726
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:37,251
Come back, so there are no regrets

727
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:42,126
This habit of heartbreak,
the heart frets

728
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:45,667
Come back, come back home.

729
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:51,376
Test me, till the heart
can no longer complain

730
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:56,251
No one who returns
needs to leave again.

731
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:59,917
Test me, Test my love.

732
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:03,417
When you come home,
don't you look back

733
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:08,292
When you leave,
don't wait and stare back

734
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:11,917
When he passes

735
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,792
these streets today,

736
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:21,792
Light a candle,

737
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:26,167
In your doorway

738
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:31,001
Fling the doors open

739
00:56:31,376 --> 00:56:33,167
He might return home

740
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,876
Let him not lose his way,

741
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:37,917
If he finds his way home.

742
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:41,417
Let no one sleep tonight,

743
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:48,542
Let's bathe these streets in light.

744
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:56,542
Let's make him stay this time.

745
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,126
Happy Diwali...

746
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:23,417
...belated.

747
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:25,792
Bhaiyaji you?

748
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,292
You didn't come...

749
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:30,792
...so I thought I should come over.

750
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:33,417
No Bhaiyaji, I had a little fever...

751
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:43,167
Your fever's gone!
Shall we get to work?

752
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:44,542
Will you take something Bhaiyaji?

753
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:46,167
I will take a life.

754
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:51,542
His life.

755
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:03,417
Look...

756
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:05,917
...this is important...

757
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,667
I'm trusting you... don't let me down.

758
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,167
Driver, drive away.

759
00:58:35,251 --> 00:58:35,917
Go. Faster.

760
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:40,792
Drive the car faster.

761
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:44,501
Shoot Dev shoot!

762
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:46,167
What are you waiting for! Shoot!!

763
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,001
I have started liking you...

764
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:53,042
dunno why... but I have

765
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:54,626
Shoot Dev shoot!

766
00:58:54,650 --> 00:59:05,541
a  <font color="#ffff00">KHomeny007</font> - <font color="#00ff00">TUT</font> <font color="#ff0000">~ Presentation ~</font>

767
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:56,376
Shoot!

768
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:01,251
Driver get away...

769
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:24,167
- Tutu
- What Tutu?

770
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:28,667
I knew this was going to happen.

771
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:32,292
This is the first time
we've missed our target!

772
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,251
What will we tell Bhaiiyaji haan?

773
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:37,667
What will we tell him?

774
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:42,417
Bhaiyaji, the target got away!

775
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:52,751
Do you know him... Do you?

776
00:59:58,792 --> 00:59:59,667
Yes Bhaiyaji.

777
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:02,042
Bhaiyaji you're right...

778
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,917
Yes Bhaiyaji, we'll come...

779
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:08,417
Ya, we're reaching...

780
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:15,876
I'm having to clean up
your mess, everytime...

781
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:24,042
What's this?

782
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:26,792
What are you doing?

783
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:28,251
Do you remember Tutu...

784
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:32,667
...when we were kids and
we had grown tired of being good...

785
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:35,917
...we had buried our books...

786
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:37,876
...saying we'll never
touch them again.

787
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,167
Well today, I'm tired of being bad.

788
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:56,292
So, you're giving up our friendship?

789
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:57,417
Shut up!

790
01:00:58,292 --> 01:00:59,292
Don't even think that!

791
01:01:08,376 --> 01:01:09,751
I'm just giving up the gun.

792
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:53,292
Hey, have you ever felt love...

793
01:01:54,667 --> 01:02:00,542
...affection, or even fondness
for someone?

794
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,917
No Bhaiyaji,
none of the three... never.

795
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,167
And you guys?

796
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:11,542
No Bhaiyaji

797
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:16,126
But sir has...
and that too all three.

798
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:20,626
On occasion of losing his senses...

799
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,376
...jump through hoops
and find me some sweets!

800
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:24,792
NOW!

801
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:36,292
What now?

802
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:44,501
Nothing Bhaiyaji, I need your
permission to give up all this.

803
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:46,917
That... I can see.

804
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:52,042
But I want to know
what do you plan to do then?

805
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:56,292
I'll manage something
small Bhaiyaji.

806
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:57,167
Bollocks!

807
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:00,292
Something small...

808
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:04,376
Will you start selling
hot dogs by the road...

809
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:06,501
...or will you become a janitor.

810
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:10,292
You flunked 5th grade right...?

811
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:14,167
...or have you completed
college behind my back too?

812
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:19,042
No Bhaiyaji, I'll figure
something out... anything.

813
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:21,042
You're not freaking getting me.

814
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:29,376
It's all fun being in love
right now, you know why?

815
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,251
Cause if you wanna take
the chick some place nice...

816
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:38,042
...you reach for your pocket...
and notes just appear.

817
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:43,917
If you wanna take her to the movies...
you reach for your pocket...

818
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:45,667
...and notes just appear.

819
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:48,667
If you wanna buy her some popcorn...

820
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,917
...you reach for your pocket...
and out comes What?!

821
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:55,042
You know what...

822
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,542
But when that pocket is torn, empty...

823
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:03,042
...and you reach out for it...
what will you get.

824
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:04,667
BOLLOCKS!

825
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:13,542
Your chick will fly away my child...

826
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:17,542
So, listen to me...

827
01:04:18,876 --> 01:04:19,667
I wish you well...

828
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:23,042
Keep romancing the chick...
and keep coming to work.

829
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:24,751
That's it.

830
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:29,042
If I advise you anymore
I'll have to charge you...

831
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:31,376
Show's over... see you tomorrow.

832
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:33,792
I won't be able to Bhaiyaji.

833
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:37,417
BhaiyaJ-i!

834
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:42,542
Can you hear me better now?

835
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,126
Sit... SIT!

836
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,167
And all of you hear me carefully...

837
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,292
If I say Sit, then you sit...

838
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:58,251
If I say up, then get UP...

839
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:01,417
If I say spit,
you have to SPIT IT OUT...

840
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:05,292
...and If I say LICK, you will
lie down and lick it clean...

841
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:11,001
Fallen in love...

842
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:13,126
Won't be able to...

843
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:16,001
I running a business here...

844
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,667
...not some charity

845
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:21,042
...that you can just come and go,
whenever you want.

846
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:26,792
Ungrateful snake,
I fed him all these years...

847
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:28,376
...and now he wants
to hiss back at me.

848
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:30,167
I too have given
back to you Bhaiyaji.

849
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:33,292
You want to show me the accounts...
should I settle them right here?

850
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:34,792
Bhiayaji let it go... he's a kid.

851
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:37,917
You were kids... when those
dogs were ripping you apart...

852
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:41,417
...if you can, pay me back
with your lives...

853
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:44,751
...and If I hear a word more,
I'll bury you right here.

854
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:46,792
He's not in his senses...
I'll talk to him... I will.

855
01:05:47,001 --> 01:05:47,667
Out!

856
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,501
What's wrong with you

857
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:57,792
Apologize, before you go.

858
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:02,167
I'm bad at math, so I won't count to 3.

859
01:06:04,501 --> 01:06:05,251
say Sorry...

860
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:11,376
Say it.

861
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:16,376
Forgive me Bhaiyaji.

862
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:18,751
Hmmm!

863
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:44,917
Bhaiyaji spared you...

864
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,626
If it were me, Bhaiyaji would've
shot me without a doubt.

865
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:49,251
I don't care if he kills me man...

866
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:50,917
It's better than dying a little,
every day.

867
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:56,001
We went through so much man...
and you still refuse to get this.

868
01:06:56,042 --> 01:06:57,667
You are not getting this Tutu!

869
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:02,667
Dude I'm not going to
be able to lift a gun now.

870
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:05,167
How do I tell you, it repulses me.

871
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:14,042
Dude, I'm done living this way...

872
01:07:15,751 --> 01:07:17,501
I want to start over now.

873
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,542
I want to live with Disha.

874
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:25,542
I want to be able to look
into her eyes, not shy away.

875
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:32,042
I want to live like
a decent human being.

876
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:38,251
If I die tomorrow
I don't want to regret that...

877
01:07:38,376 --> 01:07:40,167
I didn't even give it a shot.

878
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:50,417
I'm not upset that
Bhaiyaji doesn't get it.

879
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:54,251
I'm sad that you
don't seem to get it.

880
01:08:32,126 --> 01:08:32,876
Come here.

881
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:37,917
Listen.

882
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:43,376
We will go together to
Bhaiyaji to take the hit-jobs.

883
01:08:44,126 --> 01:08:46,876
We will also go together
to take the money.

884
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:51,917
But in between, I will continue
to live this same old life...

885
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:57,917
...and you will start
your new life. That's it!

886
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:03,417
What if we're caught?

887
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:06,501
Who's ever been able to catch us?

888
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:08,792
How will they?

889
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:12,667
You're a rascal bro.

890
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:19,292
There's only one rascal now...

891
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,376
Who quits a job without
getting another one?

892
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:27,167
You won't get that the joy of it.

893
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:29,542
What will you do now?

894
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,667
The same thing that any great man
does before he becomes great...

895
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:35,792
...struggle.

896
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:39,792
Should I speak to my daddy?

897
01:09:42,001 --> 01:09:45,292
What's the hurry,
first let me become a great man.

898
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:47,042
For a job, you idiot.

899
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:49,042
Ya, no let me try it out first.

900
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:51,626
If I don't then 'Hail Daddy'

901
01:09:58,042 --> 01:09:59,251
You're feeling an urge to kiss me?

902
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:00,417
My. you are god gifted!

903
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:01,876
Don't even think about it!

904
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,417
O Kay

905
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:13,001
Manager wanted... MBA...

906
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,292
Salesman wanted... College graduate...

907
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,667
Construction Supervisor
- Civil Engineer...

908
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,792
A helper-School pass...
What the hell man...

909
01:10:18,751 --> 01:10:20,792
This country has no
jobs for 5th grade flunks!

910
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,042
I've heard of lambs
going to slaughter...

911
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:29,042
Never seen the slaughterer
screwed by the lambs before.

912
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:35,042
Calm down... Come.

913
01:10:36,542 --> 01:10:37,292
Where?

914
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:43,001
You've passed my child...

915
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:44,667
Whaat?

916
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:47,292
That too with distinction.

917
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:49,667
MBA... that too with distinction...

918
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:54,542
If you ask me he shouldn't
have more than passing marks...

919
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,251
There are other degrees too...

920
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:59,251
Why not a Masters
in Political Science?

921
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:01,001
With the bare passing marks...

922
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:07,001
...and the best thing is
this degree even suits his face...

923
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:10,792
lam wondering what
will suit your face?

924
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:14,542
I mean, can this poor
man not even joke with you sir?

925
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:15,417
Of course he can...

926
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:19,542
So, it's final then... MBA...
1st class with distinction...

927
01:11:19,751 --> 01:11:20,876
That's nice...

928
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:25,542
Here. Congratulations.

929
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,667
Dude, you've actually passed!

930
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:29,542
Here, laddoos!

931
01:11:50,001 --> 01:11:51,167
Choose (Excuse) me Madam?

932
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:52,042
Why?

933
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,251
I want toilet...

934
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:55,042
What?

935
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:56,042
The restroom?

936
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:57,126
Go Left!

937
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:08,292
Tell me... what are your views
on India's current foreign policy.

938
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:11,792
Yeah yeah okay, fine...

939
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,542
This policy giving electric
current to Common man...

940
01:12:16,251 --> 01:12:18,792
but common man's home
no electric current everyday...

941
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:24,792
<i>no w, no tubeﬁght, no water
but foreign, in“ day current...</i>

942
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:27,292
full day tv, full day tubelight,
full day water...

943
01:12:28,876 --> 01:12:29,417
water?

944
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:33,167
Mr. Verma did you
not screen everyone?

945
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:35,792
What kind of people have you called?

946
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:42,042
In this exercise you have to convince
my colleague Mr. Gupta...

947
01:12:42,376 --> 01:12:44,042
...to buy this product from you.

948
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:46,376
Sir, these are our LED lights,

949
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:50,292
200% more energy efficient
than other brands.

950
01:12:50,751 --> 01:12:52,292
The best investment for your house.

951
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,917
- Sir, just take na sir.
- What?

952
01:13:02,292 --> 01:13:03,542
- Lights sir.
- What is this?

953
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:06,542
Sir, just take it no...
My brother's really sick.

954
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:07,376
Arre but...

955
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:11,042
Sir, please try and understand
sir... my brother is sick...

956
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,376
I need this sale... sir, please
try and understand... Lights sir!!!

957
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:15,167
Are you crazy?

958
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:16,667
C'mon man, this is not right

959
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:17,751
Are you mad?

960
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:19,667
Lights!

961
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:23,667
A girl can turn a lion into a mouse...

962
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:29,126
This gentleman had gone from
being a hitman to being a target!

963
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:34,126
Please leave... you can run
some other company into losses...

964
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:35,792
Your brains and your
degree don't match...

965
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:37,542
Sir, we need our product sold,
not our company.

966
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,042
This certificate is 100% fake...

967
01:13:39,126 --> 01:13:40,751
I must applaud your confidence...

968
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,001
Do you even know
how to spell 'executive'?

969
01:13:43,126 --> 01:13:45,376
If I make you a manager, even
the peon's will demand this job...

970
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:47,542
Sell this degree and buy
a beggar's bowl... now take a hike!

971
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:02,751
Wish you were temple priest

972
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:04,917
Everyday would be a feast,

973
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:07,417
It'd rain loose change,

974
01:14:07,626 --> 01:14:09,292
In your plate.

975
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,876
Wish you were a lowly beggar

976
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:19,292
A regular cash peddler

977
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,792
Never a borrowed penny,

978
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,542
would rest, in your plate

979
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,292
Bro, these palms need some greasing

980
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:28,292
Some greens would be pleasing.

981
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:31,042
Give me some cream,
give me some cream,

982
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:33,042
A bland cake is not appeasing.

983
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:37,751
O Brother! Oh my! Oh my! O Brother

984
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:42,501
Holy mother... My Oh,
My Oh, 0 Holy mother!

985
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:47,167
O Brother! Oh my! Oh my! O Brother

986
01:14:47,876 --> 01:14:51,626
Holy mother... My Oh,
My Oh, 0 Holy mother!

987
01:14:52,876 --> 01:14:55,167
Are you missing some
action in your life?

988
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:58,042
Has your gun become
just a showpiece?

989
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:01,667
ls your rocket,
lonely in your pocket?

990
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:05,417
Do your curtains fall,
before the big climax?

991
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:10,667
Yes? Then you need STAND UP 32,
an ayurveda miracle...

992
01:15:10,876 --> 01:15:13,626
...now light a flame
in every lonely lamp.

993
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,001
I have never seen such a lame actor...

994
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:18,251
I can act better than this!

995
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:20,667
Hey, bloody winter chill,

996
01:15:20,876 --> 01:15:23,251
Freakin‘, climb down the hill!

997
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:24,542
Why don't you run to Agra?

998
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:26,542
But our luck, truly sucks

999
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:29,001
The Taj Mahal, when in sight,

1000
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:31,167
Just then,
the wallet's feeling light.

1001
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:33,667
Stay away, 
i
 shmuck
you're a slimy 
i
 snake!

1002
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:36,167
Lightning struck, on your truck
don't shiver, when you shake!

1003
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:39,542
KA KAKA KILL KILL DA DADA DlL DlL

But still, if you need something
you will let me know... okay?

1011
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:04,751
No my child, you've already
done so much for me...

1012
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:07,917
...tell me will you take tea?

1013
01:16:08,417 --> 01:16:09,292
Of course!

1014
01:16:13,376 --> 01:16:14,251
I don't get it man...

1015
01:16:15,626 --> 01:16:19,292
I never thought it will be
so difficult to get a bloody job.

1016
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:20,876
What ya?

1017
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:23,792
I dress well... I speak good English...

1018
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:25,292
you know...

1019
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:28,917
That's why you aren't getting a job.

1020
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:29,917
What do you mean?

1021
01:16:31,251 --> 01:16:34,417
You're not really what
you're trying to look like.

1022
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:36,167
Just be yourself!

1023
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:40,167
If your clothes
or English mattered...

1024
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:44,751
...forget me,
no girl would fall for you.

1025
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:51,126
When did that happen?

1026
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:52,042
What?

1027
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,917
Meaning, you... have fallen for me?

1028
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:02,667
Uncle, this is Dev.

1029
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,667
Okay, he works with you?

1030
01:17:07,126 --> 01:17:09,417
No... He's looking
for work these days.

1031
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:14,292
Looks like you're
rehabilitating him also.

1032
01:17:15,292 --> 01:17:16,292
No uncle...

1033
01:17:17,376 --> 01:17:18,417
...he's my boyfriend.

1034
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:28,042
Just a minute!

1035
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:33,042
ls this true?
What you just told uncle.

1036
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:34,126
What?

1037
01:17:36,751 --> 01:17:39,417
Meaning... am I your boyfriend?

1038
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:41,042
Why, are you not?

1039
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:44,542
lam... since day 1!

1040
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:46,542
Me too!...

1041
01:17:56,876 --> 01:17:57,542
Stupid.

1042
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:06,167
Why do you want to
sell life insurance?

1043
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:11,792
You're an MBA... with
distinction that too.

1044
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:15,042
Sir, I think I've begun
understanding life sir.

1045
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:16,417
How's that?

1046
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:21,501
Sir, I've always lived
a poor man's life.

1047
01:18:23,376 --> 01:18:25,126
I've led a meagre life...

1048
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:29,876
but now I think I see
some prosperity coming my way.

1049
01:18:30,876 --> 01:18:33,292
I have a brother who hurl's
expletives without warning,

1050
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,417
and would lay down his life,
without asking.

1051
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:38,792
I even have a girlfriend sir.

1052
01:18:40,126 --> 01:18:43,292
Sir, she loves me so much
that I've begun loving my life too.

1053
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:47,001
If one has such a special life,
there must be a high price on it.

1054
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:53,042
And Life Insurance is exactly that.

1055
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:54,292
Then why did you do an MBA?

1056
01:18:55,501 --> 01:18:57,042
Sir, I didn't want to...

1057
01:18:59,751 --> 01:19:02,876
...my brother - Tutu, he made me
do it... with a gun to my head.

1058

01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:32,126
Thanks for inaugurating
my innings man.

1072
01:20:32,376 --> 01:20:33,292
What thanks?

1073
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:35,792
We're doing this
for our own life right?

1074
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:37,792
And you, my friend are our life!

1075
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:47,626
lam just 27 man.
Why do I need insurance?

1076
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:49,167
Sir, you're 27 now...

1077
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:52,626
then when you are 72 you will wonder
why didn't I get insured at 27?

1078
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:55,667
Times are bad sir... this lemon
soda could be poisoned...

1079
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:58,167
...these mosquitoes could
give you malaria, right?

1080
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:01,376
You must travel a lot too, right...
you especially need insurance, no?

1081
01:21:01,792 --> 01:21:03,042
Sir, the times are really bad,
anything can happen.

1082
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,292
Ya ya, give it to me...

1083
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:07,292
Hell-O!

1084
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:11,626
Come away with me...

1085
01:21:13,251 --> 01:21:14,126
Where to?

1086
01:21:14,501 --> 01:21:15,292
To our Papa!

1087
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:16,292
Holy Mother...!

1088
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:19,251
Yes! Your, and mine...

1089
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:21,376
Hey, listen...

1090
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:42,667
Namaste Bhaiyaji!

1091
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:44,667
Later then...

1092
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:47,292
How are you Bhaiyaji?

1093
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:50,001
Alive, by your grace...

1094
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:54,792
...how are you, angry young man?

1095
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:56,417
I'm good Bhaiyaji.

1096
01:22:00,001 --> 01:22:01,376
Guys, I thought long & hard...

1097
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:05,667
...every big corporate gives
its star performers star treatment...

1098
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:09,042
I'm promoting you...

1099
01:22:11,667 --> 01:22:13,167
<i>Senior assassin Dev...</i>

1100
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:17,001
Senior assassin Tutu...

1101
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:23,417
...and a raise, from 1 lac
per head to 2 lac per head...

1102
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:28,167
...salary double,
working hours, the same.

1103
01:22:28,292 --> 01:22:29,876
Bhaiyaji, this is too much.

1104
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:32,167
What's too much?

1105
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:36,917
I pay this guy 50 grand
for shooting flies...

1106
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:40,792
...at least you guys
are shooting people.

1107
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,292
Thank you Bhaiyaji. Who's this guy?

1108
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:51,876
His social service is causing
trouble in our minister's area.

1109
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:55,417
He's the solitary bone
in the minister's pie...

1110
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:59,792
...and our minister
likes his pie boneless.

1111
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:03,917
So please lessen this bone.

1112
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:06,376
He's a good man isn't he Bhaiyaji?

1113
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:07,917
But of course.

1114
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:12,542
He's sacrificing his life
so that we can earn our living.

1115
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:15,292
Of course he's a good man.

1116
01:23:24,001 --> 01:23:25,042
Think again my child...

1117
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,042
what you're getting her
for killing one guy...

1118
01:23:27,292 --> 01:23:29,917
...you won't make even
if you kill yourself all year.

1119
01:23:31,126 --> 01:23:31,876
Shall we?

1120
01:23:36,126 --> 01:23:36,792
Good Boy!

1121
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:47,001
Selling insurance to the youth...

1122
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:49,292
It's not easy...

1123
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:51,542
...very good!

1124
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:55,126
I'm really impressed.

1125
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:56,292
Thank you sir!

1126
01:23:56,917 --> 01:23:58,917
This is your first commission!

1127
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:36,876
Do you like how I look?

1128
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:40,126
Do you feel like touching?

1129
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:42,126
Don't even think about it!

1130
01:24:57,167 --> 01:24:59,876
I have started liking you very much!

1131
01:25:08,542 --> 01:25:09,917
Yes, my dear, tell me.

1132
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:14,542
I'm cornered man... I need you.

1133
01:25:16,251 --> 01:25:16,917
What happened bro?

1134
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:18,667
Too many people, too few bullets.

1135
01:25:18,751 --> 01:25:20,167
Don't cut the call, I'm on my way.

1136
01:25:20,417 --> 01:25:22,626
15 minutes...
that's all you and I have.

1137
01:25:22,876 --> 01:25:24,042
I'll get there.
Just stay out of their sight!

1138
01:26:28,751 --> 01:26:30,667
Sir... does this gentleman
belong to you?

1139
01:26:37,167 --> 01:26:41,376
You're lucky that I've quit the gun,
or life would've quit you by now.

1140
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:17,417
And here I was thinking,
this is a strange problem man...

1141
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:21,001
I hope Disha doesn't find
out that I was a bad man once,

1142
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:23,542
...and I hope that Bhaiyaji doesn't
find out that I'm a good man now!

1143
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:24,792
I'm just saying.

1144
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:27,042
If you're going to get screwed...

1145
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:30,126
...what does the size
of the screw matter?

1146
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:34,792
Dev... bro... Dev...

1147
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:35,917
Who is it?

1148
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,167
It's me Batu k...

1149
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:39,417
Bhaiyaji's right hand.

1150
01:27:39,876 --> 01:27:41,126
He's sent you a gift.

1151
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:43,542
Put it on the table. And listen...

1152
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:45,251
- Ya!
- Don't flick anything from there.

1153
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:46,417
Bloody dog.

1154
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:48,167
You're a dog... your father's a dog!

1155
01:27:58,917 --> 01:28:00,501
'Life Guardians'.

1156
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:03,542
No no sir, it's not complicated.

1157
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:07,251
Just an ID proof, a bank statement
and your insurance will be done.

1158
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:09,917
Okay!

1159
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:12,542
Thank you for calling
Life Guardians.

1160
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:14,167
We will thrive, dead or alive.

1161
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:16,001
You will thrive my boy!

1162
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:18,167
You don't trust me Bhaiyaji...

1163
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:21,792
I've seen it with my eyes... heard it.

1164
01:28:23,126 --> 01:28:25,042
You can shoot me,
if it's not true Bhaiyaji.

1165
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,292
I will, you won't have to tell me.

1166
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:31,667
I'll try with a new number.
Hear it for yourself.

1167
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:33,042
Tell me Dev's number.

1168
01:28:33,251 --> 01:28:35,667
8826914371

1169
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:39,167
I know it by heart.

1170
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:42,751
Hello.

1171
01:28:43,501 --> 01:28:45,542
Hello! ls this Mr. Dev?

1172
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:47,042
Yes, this is Dev.

1173
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:49,251
I got your number
from a client of yours...

1174
01:28:49,292 --> 01:28:50,417
I need an insurance policy.

1175
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,001
Of course, I'll set it up.

1176
01:28:52,292 --> 01:28:54,292
Where's your office by the way?

1177
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:57,042
It's in New Delhi,
the Galgotia towers...

1178
01:28:57,167 --> 01:28:58,876
...our office is on the 4th floor.

1179
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,042
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

1180
01:29:01,251 --> 01:29:03,042
Or you can call me,

01:29:03,251 --> 01:29:04,376
Okay.

1182
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:06,667
Okay! Thank you for

1183
01:29:06,876 --> 01:29:08,542
We will thrive, dead or alive.

1184
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,917
Thrive away, my b0!!!

1185
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:13,876
Do you remember
how to fire a gun still?

1186
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:15,542
I do Bhaiyaji.

1187
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,292
Your reservation is confirmed.

1188
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:22,376
Please proceed to the baggage area.

1189
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:26,626
Hello.

1190
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:27,917
Where are you?

1191
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:29,251
Outside, drinking sherbet...

1192
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:30,751
Why are you not in office?

1193
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:32,167
Arre I'm right outside office...

1194
01:29:32,376 --> 01:29:33,167
Let's meet...

1195
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:35,001
Ya, we're meeting in the evening na?

1196
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:36,292
Nope, right now...

1197
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:37,501
Now? Where?

1198
01:29:37,626 --> 01:29:39,292
Leave right now!

1199
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:39,917
Whaat?

1200
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:43,042
Leave right away! Bye!

1201
01:30:16,126 --> 01:30:17,292
Why here, at Kutub Minar?

1202
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:22,126
If we were in Paris,
it would've been the Eiffel tower...

1203
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,001
...if in Agra, then the Taj Mahal...

1204
01:30:26,751 --> 01:30:29,126
- ...and if in Mumbai
- The Taj Mahal hotel?

1205
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:31,792
God-gifted you are!

1206
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:41,001
All the crazy decisions I've
taken in life, started out here...

1207
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:45,126
...the decision to quit medicine...

1208
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:49,542
...to refuse dad's business,
and to start reforming criminals...

1209
01:30:51,376 --> 01:30:54,167
...to break up with my
last boyfriend and kick him out...

1210
01:30:55,001 --> 01:30:56,001
...all those decisions... right here.

1211
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:00,167
So what decision are
you going to take today?

1212
01:31:02,001 --> 01:31:04,667
Today, you are going to make
a decision, not me.

1213
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:22,042
You're not just fooling
around with me right?

1214
01:31:23,751 --> 01:31:24,917
Are you high?

1215
01:31:26,001 --> 01:31:29,167
Then straighten me out...
tell me the truth.

1216
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:34,876
If you want to leave me,
do it today...

1217
01:31:36,042 --> 01:31:37,292
Don't wait for tomorrow

1218
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:41,792
...because I'm really
serious about us.

1219
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:46,292
If you leave me today,
I'll handle it...

1220
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:48,667
...but any later...

1221
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:51,042
I'll not be able to take it Dev.

1222
01:31:54,126 --> 01:31:55,667
Any later...?

1223
01:31:58,001 --> 01:32:00,126
I'll not be able to take it,
even if you leave me today...

1224
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:14,376
So do you wanna get married?

1225
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:21,917
Will you?

1226
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:27,542
You will!

1227
01:32:41,376 --> 01:32:44,126
A dream has stirred
awake from slumber

1228
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:47,126
An epic waits to unfold

1229
01:32:49,001 --> 01:32:51,251
The rain is bathing
itself in her beauty,

1230
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:54,126
The waters shimmer
in flames of gold.

1231
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:59,292
The damned, are now the blessed,

1232
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:09,167
Who find, good deeds to be wretched,

1233
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:15,751
What do I do? What do I do, love?

1234
01:33:19,251 --> 01:33:24,292
This fully clad body,
by a naked soul is possessed.

1235
01:33:38,001 --> 01:33:42,417
I can feel the warm
embrace of life again,

1236
01:33:45,501 --> 01:33:50,042
This heart has got
its lost love back.

1237
01:33:54,792 --> 01:34:01,251
I've spent many insipid
nights and days,

1238
01:34:02,251 --> 01:34:06,376
You've breathed back
the flavours, I lack.

1239
01:34:08,126 --> 01:34:12,251
Drifters, alike, we were,

1240
01:34:12,917 --> 01:34:16,626
Our wandering, too, was akin

1241
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:21,751
Unwise, we always err,

1242
01:34:22,501 --> 01:34:25,626
But this madness,
is difficult to pin.

1243
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:31,501
Prostrated, I sing prayers,
far & wide,

1244
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:35,417
In the city my beloved occupies.

1245
01:34:35,751 --> 01:34:40,001
You earn yours here,
prayer by prayer,

1246
01:34:40,542 --> 01:34:44,667
God blesses
for free; It's lies

1247
01:34:50,542 --> 01:34:53,042
A dream has stirred
awake from slumber

1248
01:34:55,376 --> 01:34:57,751
An epic waits to unfold

1249
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:02,751
The rain is bathing
itself in her beauty,

1250
01:35:07,292 --> 01:35:09,292
The waters shimmer
in flames of gold.

1251
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:23,417
I can feel the warm
embrace of life again,

1252
01:35:26,251 --> 01:35:30,917
This heart has got
its lost love back.

1253
01:35:32,001 --> 01:35:36,167
Drifters, alike, we were,

1254
01:35:36,792 --> 01:35:40,292
Our wandering, too, was akin

1255
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:45,792
Unwise, we always err,

1256
01:35:46,501 --> 01:35:49,667
But this madness,
is difficult to pin.

1257
01:35:50,042 --> 01:35:55,417
Prostrated, I sing prayers,
far & wide,

1258
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:59,167
In the city my beloved occupies.

1259
01:35:59,751 --> 01:36:04,167
You earn yours here,
prayer by prayer,

1260
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:09,167
God blesses
for free; It's lies

1261
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:21,167
When a dog goes rabid...

1262
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:25,542
...he has to be put down.

1263
01:36:27,876 --> 01:36:29,376
And Dev's gone totally rabid.

1264
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:34,251
So, Bhaiyaji should I put Dev down?

1265
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:37,542
If Tutu... I mean... if he finds out...

1266
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:40,001
He'll kill me Bhaiyaji.

1267
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:41,917
- Will he find out?
- No Bhaiyaji.

1268
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:44,501
He will not.

1269
01:36:48,417 --> 01:36:49,792
You're going to lose
your cherry today...

1270
01:36:51,167 --> 01:36:52,292
...carry a charm.

1271
01:37:10,876 --> 01:37:12,626
Do you want a kiss or coffee?

1272
01:37:15,376 --> 01:37:16,167
Coffee.

1273
01:37:18,876 --> 01:37:19,667
Okay!

1274
01:37:37,126 --> 01:37:37,917
Yes Bhaiyaji.

1275
01:37:38,126 --> 01:37:39,126
ls Dev there?

1276
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:41,001
He's gone out Bhaiyaji.

1277
01:37:41,251 --> 01:37:46,667
I was inside... I don't know
what the guys said to Batuk...

1278
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:49,917
...he's left blabbering that
he's going to finish Dev...

1279
01:37:50,042 --> 01:37:52,417
...and carve a place for himself...

1280
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:54,667
...so I need you to handle it...

1281
01:37:57,417 --> 01:37:58,376
Just handle them!

1282
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:03,667
Dev! Pick up the phone Dev.

1283
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:11,792
Hello.

1284
01:38:12,542 --> 01:38:14,792
My heart felt wishes on your union.

1285
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:16,001
Who's this?

1286
01:38:16,376 --> 01:38:18,542
I'm your well wisher...

1287
01:38:21,626 --> 01:38:25,126
...don't hang up,
this is for your benefit.

1288
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:26,542
What do you want?

1289
01:38:26,917 --> 01:38:34,167
I just wanted to know what is it
that you eat everyday...

1290
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:38,292
...that has made you blind
to such lies.

1291
01:38:38,501 --> 01:38:39,417
What lies?

1292
01:38:40,626 --> 01:38:44,792
The lie that your darling Dev
is living, but you can't see.

1293
01:38:45,251 --> 01:38:46,792
How do you know Dev?

1294
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:52,126
I know Tutu also.

1295
01:38:52,542 --> 01:38:53,792
What do you know?

1296
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:58,292
Nice! Now that's cheating...

1297
01:39:01,542 --> 01:39:07,542
...you need to try harder
and figure this riddle out.

1298
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:11,167
Okay... Let me give you a hint.

1299
01:39:12,542 --> 01:39:17,542
What was Dev's past,
is now Tutu's present.

1300
01:39:20,001 --> 01:39:23,542
So now if you want to find out
what Dev used to be...

1301
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:29,626
...you need to find out
what Tutu is.

1302
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:35,792
Gotta hang up now...
already spent a bomb.

1303
01:39:50,792 --> 01:39:53,917
Dev! What's going on
I just got a phone call?

1304
01:39:54,126 --> 01:39:54,792
Hey Dev...

1305
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:03,792
...your ticket's confirmed now.

1306
01:40:52,126 --> 01:40:56,917
What was Dev's past,
is now Tutu's present.

1307
01:40:59,167 --> 01:41:03,126
So now if you want to find out
what Dev used to be...

1308
01:41:04,292 --> 01:41:08,251
...you need to find out what Tutu is.

1309
01:41:14,417 --> 01:41:15,417
When I talk to her...

1310
01:41:15,542 --> 01:41:17,792
I want to be able to look into
her eyes, not shy away.

1311
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:21,792
The day she finds out 'what you are'
she won't even spit in your face.

1312
01:41:41,501 --> 01:41:42,542
A pawn...

1313
01:41:45,251 --> 01:41:49,792
...is carefully brought
to the eigth row...

1314
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:56,792
...so that he can make way
for the Queen.

1315
01:42:01,542 --> 01:42:02,626
Welcome Dev.

1316
01:42:03,292 --> 01:42:06,626
Madam this dead man,
do you know him?

1317
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:11,376
No sir.

1318
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:15,001
Any idea... who shot him?

1319
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:21,501
No sir, we were inside packing our
bags when he heard the shots.

1320
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:23,876
When we came out he was lying here.

1321
01:42:24,292 --> 01:42:27,917
I called the ambulance first,
then we called you. That's all sir.

1322
01:42:28,376 --> 01:42:31,792
Alright. If we need you
we will call you again.

1323
01:42:32,251 --> 01:42:34,042
Rest I've already discussed
the details with your dad.

1324
01:42:34,292 --> 01:42:35,292
Okay?... Take care.

1325
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:36,542
- Thank you sir.
- Let's go!

1326
01:42:57,667 --> 01:42:58,376
Sit.

1327
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:12,042
Listen to me carefully.

1328
01:43:14,751 --> 01:43:16,542
lam no longer indebted to you...

1329
01:43:17,001 --> 01:43:18,376
Today I've paid
all your favours back.

1330
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:20,167
We're done.

1331
01:43:20,626 --> 01:43:22,792
What you do after
today... is your problem.

1332
01:43:24,626 --> 01:43:26,917
What I will do, is only my problem.

1333
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:33,542
You can keep what was
yours in this relationship...

1334
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:36,167
I've given up what was mine...

1335
01:43:37,501 --> 01:43:39,626
...there is no 'US' anymore.

1336
01:43:41,042 --> 01:43:42,751
I've said what I wanted to...

1337
01:43:43,292 --> 01:43:46,542
...and I want to hear nothing
you will want to say.

1338
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:18,042
It's all over man...

1339
01:44:27,876 --> 01:44:31,042
You can never tell what's
going on in someone's head.

1340
01:44:34,667 --> 01:44:36,251
He was a good cook though.

1341
01:44:41,292 --> 01:44:43,417
Anyway, it must've
been his time to go...

1342
01:44:46,792 --> 01:44:50,876
...let's worry about the one
who's time it's going to be.

1343
01:45:00,876 --> 01:45:03,542
Your faces tell me, you know him.

1344
01:45:04,751 --> 01:45:06,042
Babban Pehelwaan.

1345
01:45:07,626 --> 01:45:09,292
He's a tough nut Bhaiyaji.

1346
01:45:10,042 --> 01:45:11,542
It's not like we're angels.

1347
01:45:22,167 --> 01:45:24,751
Somewhere, stuck, lies a moment,

1348
01:45:26,792 --> 01:45:29,626
Entwined in the threads
of time, perhaps.

1349
01:45:32,251 --> 01:45:34,917
Where there's a heart,
there will be ache,

1350
01:45:37,626 --> 01:45:40,542
There's no remedy for this, perhaps.

1351
01:45:46,792 --> 01:45:50,376
What are you looking at, never
seen a handsome man before?

1352
01:45:53,126 --> 01:45:54,292
C'mon interview me.

1353
01:45:55,001 --> 01:45:56,042
For a job?

1354
01:45:56,667 --> 01:45:57,542
For a girl.

1355
01:46:04,917 --> 01:46:10,167
Tutu, you were right, a swine should
stick to feasting on just crap.

1356
01:46:12,167 --> 01:46:16,751
Trying a cake, will give it
nothing but diarrhoea.

1357
01:46:17,542 --> 01:46:18,251
Madam.

1358
01:46:36,917 --> 01:46:39,417
And here I was thinking,
this is a strange problem man...

1359
01:46:40,417 --> 01:46:43,042
I hope Disha doesn't find out
that I was a bad man once...

1360
01:46:43,417 --> 01:46:45,792
...and I hope that Bhaiyaji doesn't
find out that I'm a good man now!

1361
01:46:47,876 --> 01:46:50,917
The stars are spent, My love,

1362
01:46:53,542 --> 01:46:56,167
Smudged black, this night sky,

1363
01:46:56,542 --> 01:46:59,501
You work so hard
to reform criminals...

1364
01:47:01,251 --> 01:47:03,001
...and you've reformed
so many of them...

1365
01:47:05,501 --> 01:47:07,042
...you reformed one guy
accidentally...

1366
01:47:11,376 --> 01:47:12,792
...but you probably
didn't realize it...

1367
01:47:17,417 --> 01:47:19,917
Bad bloody luck.
Can't get enough of it.

1368
01:47:21,792 --> 01:47:24,501
Blinded, I can see no more, through

1369
01:47:27,417 --> 01:47:30,292
The cobwebs spun in my eye.

1370
01:47:33,042 --> 01:47:36,042
Bruised, by the chores
of the heart, Love

1371
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:38,001
What is it?

1372
01:47:40,292 --> 01:47:41,042
Get lost.

1373
01:47:43,042 --> 01:47:45,417
I never meant to hurt you...

1374
01:47:48,042 --> 01:47:49,417
...but still I am sorry
for all the trouble.

1375
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:54,667
Just pray I don't shoot
someone today.

1376
01:47:58,417 --> 01:48:01,917
Still, nothing is sweeter
than her memories

1377
01:48:04,042 --> 01:48:06,667
Rid me of this hamper of agonies.

1378
01:48:09,376 --> 01:48:11,626
I lost you because
I used to take lives...

1379
01:48:12,542 --> 01:48:16,001
Bruised, by the chores
of the heart, Love

1380
01:48:16,626 --> 01:48:18,792
...maybe lfl give up my own,
I could get you back...

1381
01:48:19,167 --> 01:48:23,417
Battered, I'm, by the chores
of the heart

1382
01:48:25,417 --> 01:48:26,042
Dev!!

1383
01:48:29,542 --> 01:48:30,501
Deeeeeevvvvl!

1384
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:34,042
What happened?!

1385
01:48:43,042 --> 01:48:47,126
I don't know what tomorrow holds...
but you take care.

1386
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:52,417
Sweeta my Sweeta, without you

1387
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:57,876
Darker than the night,
are my days... without you

1388
01:48:58,042 --> 01:48:58,542
Dev!

1389
01:49:00,667 --> 01:49:01,126
Dev!

1390
01:49:04,376 --> 01:49:07,001
Life hands a messy deal

1391
01:49:07,292 --> 01:49:10,042
Lifetimes, bartered
for split seconds

1392
01:49:10,542 --> 01:49:15,417
I'm Baavraa, Baavraa...
the crazy heart.

1393
01:49:15,792 --> 01:49:18,417
Life hands a messy deal

1394
01:49:18,667 --> 01:49:21,292
Lifetimes, bartered
for split seconds

1395
01:49:21,876 --> 01:49:25,917
I'm Baavraa, Baavraa...
the crazy heart.

1396
01:49:48,126 --> 01:49:49,042
Where's Dev?

1397
01:49:49,876 --> 01:49:51,042
We're at the hospital!

1398
01:49:51,792 --> 01:49:52,917
What is wrong with you guys?

1399
01:49:53,667 --> 01:49:55,792
Death does not scare me, but,

1400
01:49:56,126 --> 01:49:59,542
Without you, it would be an ordeal

1401
01:50:02,126 --> 01:50:05,792
If it is life I must endure,
then too

1402
01:50:07,501 --> 01:50:10,417
Without you, it would be an ordeal

1403
01:50:12,417 --> 01:50:16,001
In my heart I house,

1404
01:50:18,167 --> 01:50:22,501
A trembling flame,

1405
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:27,501
As I take your leave...

1406
01:50:34,542 --> 01:50:37,292
Life hands a messy deal

1407
01:50:37,751 --> 01:50:40,292
Lifetimes, bartered
for split seconds

1408
01:50:40,917 --> 01:50:46,001
I'm Baavraa, Baavraa...
the crazy heart.

1409
01:50:57,501 --> 01:51:00,042
Life hands a messy deal

1410
01:51:00,292 --> 01:51:03,001
Lifetimes, bartered
for split seconds

1411
01:51:03,501 --> 01:51:08,501
I'm Baavraa, Baavraa...
the crazy heart.

1412
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:23,167
Excuse me madam...

1413
01:51:25,917 --> 01:51:28,292
...have we met before?

1414
01:51:31,792 --> 01:51:33,251
The bugger is flirting again.

1415
01:51:35,792 --> 01:51:37,792
By God, you are god-gifted.

1416
01:51:52,292 --> 01:51:53,542
I love you!

1417
01:52:04,792 --> 01:52:08,167
Dear Bhaiyaji, any last wish.

1418
01:52:13,792 --> 01:52:17,042
All my life, I've pulled out many
a pictures from my pocket...

1419
01:52:20,001 --> 01:52:22,126
Just never thought my
picture will land up here.

1420
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:33,251
If you want to shoot... shoot.

1421
01:52:35,792 --> 01:52:38,042
Don't stare and waste my time.

1422
01:52:47,292 --> 01:52:49,542
Blood runs down the iron sky,

1423
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:53,167
The sun starts to melt to gold.

1424
01:52:55,001 --> 01:52:57,542
An evening slowly sinks behind us,

1425
01:52:58,792 --> 01:53:01,167
A morning will silently, unfold.

1426
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:21,292
What did you do before this?

1427
01:53:21,417 --> 01:53:22,501
Before this I was a mur...!

1428
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:30,376
Mar... marketer sir!

1429
01:53:31,042 --> 01:53:34,542
If you were a marketer
why did you do an MBA?

1430
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:37,792
Sir, actually...

1431
01:53:41,751 --> 01:53:45,667
...my little brother and
his wife forced me to.

1432
01:53:57,126 --> 01:54:00,792
I concede, Love is not
a slave to the world

1433
01:54:01,792 --> 01:54:05,417
All is well, if the heart
is brave & bold

1434
01:54:06,501 --> 01:54:10,167
A defeat at the hands of love,
laccept

1435
01:54:15,042 --> 01:54:19,167
My man, this is the chance

1436
01:54:19,751 --> 01:54:23,917
To burn-n-soar, this is your chance

1437
01:54:24,792 --> 01:54:28,626
The miracle of love,
a pyre that turns you into fire

1438
01:54:29,417 --> 01:54:34,042
When the pyre turns
you to fire... Sanidha pa...

1439
01:54:36,792 --> 01:54:39,542
Nakhriley, these coy & thirsty,

1440

rained on me.

1447
01:55:39,126 --> 01:55:42,792
Orphans, need no kith and kin,

1448
01:55:44,292 --> 01:55:47,417
but for their hearts

1449
01:55:48,376 --> 01:55:51,667
Awaken me from your penance

1450
01:55:53,001 --> 01:55:56,292
If I am yours, show your miracles.

1451
01:55:57,626 --> 01:56:00,042
Hey swindler, your deceptive,
hoodwinking

1452
01:56:00,126 --> 01:56:01,167
eyes".

1453
01:56:02,751 --> 01:56:05,251

rained on me.

1459
01:56:34,292 --> 01:56:36,042
These stories... wrench our hearts

1460
01:56:36,251 --> 01:56:37,667
These bonds... wrench our hearts

1461
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:41,126
There's no tale that
doesn't wrench the heart

1462
01:56:41,501 --> 01:56:44,792
Let me breathe,
in the vicinity of your eyes,

1463
01:56:45,042 --> 01:56:48,417
Let me bask in the air,
where your presence lies.

1464
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:51,917
With every word you say,
I rejuvenate,

1465
01:56:52,376 --> 01:56:55,876
The seasons in my eyes,
one by one, alternate

1466
01:56:56,167 --> 01:56:58,042
Seasons of chills
Seasons of warmth

1467
01:56:58,292 --> 01:56:59,667
You're the chill
You're the warmth

1468
01:57:00,042 --> 01:57:04,042
Flare, I will, thirst, I will...
