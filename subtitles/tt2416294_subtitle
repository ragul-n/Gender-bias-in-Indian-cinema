Go for it. Praise the Lord.

3
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,305
'I had a question in my
mind ever since I was small.'

4
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,277
'When the seven wonders
of the world were being chosen..'

5
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,118
'..why didn't people
consider the Indian weddings.'

6
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:36,846
Move.

7
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,918
Indian wedding.
The biggest wonder of the world.

8
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,235
What are you doing? - Nothing.

9
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,846
Everyone is laughing. - Sorry.

10
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,179
Come on. - Sorry.

11
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,619
'Three pineapple juice.
2 plates chaumein.'

12
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,389
'And after six plates of ice cream..'

13
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,486
'..this wedding became
meaningless to me.'

14
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,496
'But there is one more special
thing about these weddings.'

15
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:28,094
'According to a survey,
the love stories of 74.3% people..'

16
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,266
'..start in someone else's wedding.'

17
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:35,175
'Actually 74.4.'

18
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:05,537
Sahil. Sahil. Sahil. Sahil.

19
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:11,711
Sahil. Sahil. Sahil. Sahil.

20
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:17,678
Sahil. Sahil. Sahil. Sahil.

21
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:23,256
Sahil. Sahil. Sahil. Sahil.

22
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,223
Sahil. Sahil. Sahil. Sahil.

23
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,628
Sahil. Sahil. Sahil. Sahil.

24
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,444
Yes.

25
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,515
Superb.

26
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,089
'Even after winning
the college championships.'

27
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,058
'..my victory was still incomplete.'

28
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,989
'Because finals
were still remaining.'

29
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,757
You would blush on seeing Saahil.

30
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,969
'My life was perfect.'

31
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,101
'And when your life is giving
you all the right answers..'

32
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,770

00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,368
...to ask the most important
question of your life.'

34
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,149
That current model.

35
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,621
He is too much.

36
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,622
He is too much.

37
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,124
<i>Guys. 9N5-.</i>

38
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,389
I have an announcement
to make. - What?

39
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,724
What are you talking about?

40
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,957
As all of you know.

41
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,799
I and Sneha came to this place
15 years ago for the first time.

42
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,631
You remember? - Of course.

43
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,538
I had bought a teddy bear for Sneha.

44
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,699
We were 8 years old.

45
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,105
That teddy bear costed me 1000 bucks.

46
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,166
And Sneha lost the teddy bear here.

47
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,736
Really? - So she had robbed
for the first time here.

48
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,705
Second time. We were in college.

49
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,045
We came here just for the sake of it.

50
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,519
Ice cream.
- Ma'am sent me to get an ice cream.

51
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,323
I ran for a kilometer.
I got ajolt again.

52
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,718
Third time it was her birthday.

53
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,557
I bought a dress for
her which didn't fit her.

54
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,655
So mean. That was years ago, Saahil.

55
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,690
Today she has given
me yet another shock.

56
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,134
Shock worth millions.

57
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,569
What? - What do you mean?

58
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,735
What? - Yes.

59
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,100
What?

60
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,000
Sam.

61
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,179
Saahil.

62
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,490
Oh God!

63
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,826
Sneha, will you marry me?

64
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,006
Yes.

65
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,444
Yes. Sneha has agreed.

66
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:37,319
Oh God. O God.

67
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:05,672
Sweetheart,
love is such a sweet thing.

68
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:10,981
Love is a source of life.

69
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:16,377
On an obscure picture,
love is a change.

70
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:28,405
Ocean in a drop.
And a lifetime in a moment.

71
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,932
Should I bow down or
cast away every evil eye?

72
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,741
O God, what should I do?

73
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,509
O God, what should I do?

74
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,313
O God, what should I do?

75
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,184
O God, what should I do?

76
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,814
O God, what should I do?

77
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,759
O God, what should I do?

78
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,591
O God, what should I do?

79
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,190
O God, what should I do?

80
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:01,989
O God. O God.

81
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:24,754
Sweetheart,
love is such a sweet thing.

82
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:30,529
Love is a source of life.

83
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,834
It is spark that has come through.

84
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:41,277
Love is a world of dreams.

85
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:47,417
Ocean in a drop.
And a lifetime in a moment.

86
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,921
Should I bow down or
cast away every evil eye?

87
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:56,392
O God, what should I do?

88
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:02,596
O God, what should I do?

89
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,834
O God, what should I do?

90
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,929
O God, what should I do?

91
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,474
O God, what should I do?

92
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,636
O God, what should I do?

93
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:21,302
O God.

94
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:32,192
What do I do without you?

95
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:38,024
What do I do without you?

96
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,028
My desires are running wild.

97
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,973
Like the clouds in the sky.

98
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,606
Like raindrops.

99
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:54,913
I have lost control.
My heart's going wild.

100
00:12:54,974 --> 00:13:01,050
My desires are running wild.

101
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:06,586
It has a world of its own.

102
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,964
Should I live in it or stay away?

103
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,970
O God, what should I do?

104
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,972
O God, what should I do?

105
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,566
O God, what should I do?

106
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,340
O God, what should I do?

107
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,211
O God, what should I do?

108
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,047
O God, what should I do?

109
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,644
O God, what should I do?

110
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,622
O God, what should I do?

111
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,360
O God.

112
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,663
O God.

113
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,494
You get the correct estimate
of lndian's population"

114
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,899
'..in a house where a
wedding is about to happen.'

115
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,494
'People everywhere.'

116
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,937
Brother Sahil, happy married life.
All the best.

117
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,744
'Two things never
stop in a wedding house.'

118
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,478
'Full cream milk tea.'

119
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,710
'And the unwanted opinions
of your relatives.'

120
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,585
Saahil, how are you. - Great.

121
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,590
Gunjan, your son has
become really handsome.

122
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,925
O Gosh! Saahil, what are you doing?

123
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,155
Uncle Popan is about to come.

124
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,321
Come on quick. - Relax.

125
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,625
Today's generation I tell you.

126
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,221
Come. Come.

127
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,061
'Now you start getting
the pre marriage jitters.'

128
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,134
'And everyone tells you
the story of his or her marriage.'

129
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:01,107
'There is drama, comedy, romance.'

130
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,978
'And sometimes horror.'

131
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,980
Hi Saahil. - Hi.

132
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,446
Carry on. Carry on.

133
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,315
Uncle. Uncle.

134
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,588
How are you?

135
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,821
Great. - Take this.

136
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,063
Hello. - Hello. Hello. How are you?

137
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,031
Hello.

138
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,231
I gave you oil to apply.

139
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,238
Did you apply it only on your beard?

140
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,938
Congrats. Congrats. - Oh. Uncle.

141
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,471
God bless. God bless.

142
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,604
Aunt hasn't come?

143
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,741
It is possible that I
don't attend your wedding, son?

144
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,851
Congratulations. - Oh God!

145
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,219
What is this? - Flowers.

146
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,282
These are flowers. What a fool.

147
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,451
Where is the room? - Come.

148
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,222
These aren't flowers, you fool.

149
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,427
Come on. Show us our room.

150
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,519
Come. Come.
- I have to give her medicine.

151
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,089
These aren't meant
to be given on wedding..

152
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,065
"But when someone dies.
Come on.

153
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,262
'I got flowers which are meant to be
given in remembrance on my wedding.'

154
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,899
'Was this aunt Babita's forgetfulness
or a signal from God?'

155
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,273
'Only one man could've
answered this.'

156
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,278
'Someone who has been
my support since childhood.'

157
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:13,079
'And he has taught
me never to lose hope.'

158
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,813
'And that was my super hero.'

159
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,218
'My elder brother.
Shravan Singh Chaudhary.'

160
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,655
Hello, everybody.

161
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,399
Champ.

162
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,062
Uncle, you are looking really smart.

163
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,069
How is your marriage coming on?

164
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,267
Super hit. Since you have trained me.

165
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,145
Cheers. - Here we go.

166
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,483
Dude, what about
the bachelor's party?

167
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,341
Bachelor's party.
What are you saying?

168
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,219
I'll organise the best
strippers for you. I swear.

169
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,755
A gift from me to you.

170
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,882
Brother, please. I am one woman guy.

171
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,292
That's a great line.
Will work on Sneha. Not on me. Okay.

172
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,489
We are buddies.
We are friends. Come on.

173
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,553
You need not hide it from me.

174
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,564
Let's go.

175
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,260
Two beers. - Okay, sir.

176
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,427
Brother, I am telling the truth.

177
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,267
I have never even
looked at another girl.

178
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,907
So you are saying you
have not done anything"

179
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,442
...with any other
girl apart from Sneha.

180
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,645
I haven't done anything
with Sneha either.

181
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,980
We are waiting for our marriage.

182
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,986
It means you haven't done
anything with any girl to this day.

183
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,216
No.

184
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,218
Oh. Now I get it. -What?

185
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,994
But you shouldn't ruin
Sneha's life like this.

186
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:41,428
I understand that you like
boys over girls. That's okay.

187
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,904
It's legal now. Not a problem.

188
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,838
Brother, please. What are you saying?

189
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,937
I am not interested
in boys whatsoever.

190
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,343
I'm perfectly straight.
Absolutely normal.

191
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,005
Normal. Straight.

192
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,778
My foot. You haven't done anything
with the one you girl you have.

193
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,216
You haven't done
anything with any girl.

194
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,345
You call yourself normal.
You are not my brother.

195
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,054
Someone must have swapped
you in the hospital.

196
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,022
Here is your beer.
- To hell with your beer.

197
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,523
I need whisky now.

198
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,423
Enjoyed? - A lot.

199
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,056
Hen's party is the
one you should enjoy.

200
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,431
I know. Dance, song. Wedding.

201
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,927
You know that I am not
interested in all of that.

202
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,528
We should have a hen's party.

203
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,232
It's been six years to your marriage.

204
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,375
Have kids at least now.

205
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,711
One has kids only once
the honeymoon is over. Correct.

206
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,710
Our honeymoon is still going strong.

207
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,047
Naughty-

208
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,214
Okay. Listen,
I have fixed the hotel and menu.

209
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,049
At her behest.

210
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,592
Have a check. - Sure.

211
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,625
Come. - Alright.

212
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,760
Champ. - Hi uncle.

213
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,627
Rockstar uncle.

214
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,826
What's up with Saahil?

215
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,796
He hasn't done anything
with girl till date.

216
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,604
Is he gay?

217
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,162
No. Thankfully he isn't gay.

218
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,609
He is like I will do it after
marriage and not before marriage.

219
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,269
And all that.

220
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,645
Look, you are my disciple.
You won't give up so easily.

221
00:18:59,037 --> 00:18:59,674
Keep at it.

222
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,218
Uncle, I'll fix this
celibate at any cost.

223
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,914
Stay away from girls. Okay.

224
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,617
This advice at this age of mine.
Does it sound nice?

225
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,619
Bye, Saahil.

226
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,786
You can shut the bar.

227
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,359
Your astrologer's prediction
is going to come true..

228
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,768
...because this marriage
of yours is going to break.

229
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,268
You will have to remarry.

230
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,741
You are drunk.

231
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,538
I am not drunk.

232
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,582
But when you come to
your senses you'll know.

233
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,144
What's problem in
loving one single girl?

234
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,018
I mean you had told me.

235
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,251
And you are with
sister-in-law since so long.

236
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,055
I don't know why you
are telling me these things.

237
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,931
It's your accountant.

238
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,295
Bye Saahil.

239
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,166
Veena, my baby.

240
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,966
How are you? I love you too.

241
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,812
No. I am a little
busy with the wedding.

242
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,241
Yes. Yes. She is here.

243
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,984
I'll meet. I'll meet. Once I am free.

244
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,466
Champ.

245
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,499
Why aren't you answering my call?

246
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,731
I don't want to talk to you, brother.

247
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,739
You are cheating on sister-in-law.

248
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,608
You could be like this" - Could be.

249
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,615
Be realistic.
This is how God has made us.

250
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,747
You must have heard the saying.
All men are dogs.

251
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,788
Yes, I have.

252
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:52,594
This is the biggest truth.
Dude, we are dogs. Trust me.

253
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,828
There is cheating in our hormones.

254
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,962
Don't..don't justify yourself,
brother. Please.

255
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,333
It is the truth.

256
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,213
You have heard this.
A king has 20 queens.

257
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,743
Have you heard that
a queen has 20 kings?

258
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,517
That doesn't happen. Not possible.

259
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,056
Actually a man gets bored
being with just one woman.

260
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,453
A woman doesn't get bored.

261
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:26,826
And when a man gets bored
his hormones start attacking him.

262
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,723
His frustration increases.

263
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,165
And his takes his frustration
out on his wife and kids.

264
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,930
They start fighting
and come to blows.

265
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,299
And finally they get divorced.

266
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,600
Understand.
So the moral of the story is..

267
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:42,078
...to have a happily married life,
you must cheat on your wife.

268
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,538
Brother, why are you
telling me all this now?

269
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,313
I am about to get married.

270
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,718
I am saving your marriage. My friend.

271
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,851
Brother, I am not interested
in your hormones and hormonal theory.

272
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,515
Can you please keep
your hormones to yourself?

273
00:21:55,514 --> 00:22:00,623
Son, don't ever
underestimate hormones.

274
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,100
Let alone humans.
Hormones haven't spared even Gods.

275
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,203
For example Lord Rama. - What?

276
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,039
Lord Rama was the ideal man, brother.

277
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:15,545
He loved Mother Sita all his life.

278
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,246
Correct. You are right.

279
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,715
Hormones didn't stop hounding Him.

280
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,153
He had to assume Krishna's
avatar to satisfy them.

281
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,017
I got you, baby. I got you.

282
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:30,618
I'm sorry.
Did I disturb? - Not at all.

283
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,087
I was explaining to him
how to be a good husband.

284
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,258
Teach him well, brother-in-law.
I want him just like you.

285
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,899
I will make him just like me.
- Really?

286
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,940
I was looking for sister.
Where is she?

287
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,443
She must be talking to her tailor.

288
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,136
Okay. I'll go find her. See you.

289
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,804
See you. - Bye. - Bye-bye.

290
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,748
So sweet.

291
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,542
You'll ruin the life of
such a sweet girl. You know that?

292
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,984
Selfish man.

293
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:03,616
I am selfish? You are unbelievable.

294
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,787
Please go from here.
I don't want to talk to you.

295
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:07,962
I'll go away.

296
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:12,096
But you'll remember me when
your hormones start to kick in.

297
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,104
Okay. Go. Just go. - Hormones.

298
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,975
When they kick in
you'll realise. - Okay.

299
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,605
Do you remember?
I was telling you about this book.

300
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,977
It is called before
the heart attacks.

301
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,208
Have you read it?

302
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,611
No. -You haven't?
You really have to.

303
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,417
You know.
75% men cheat on their women..

304
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,447
...In the first week
of their marriage.

305
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,926
Can you imagine that?
I was so shocked.

306
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,555
Saahil. Saahil. -What?

307
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,628
Are you okay? - Yes. Of course.

308
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,629
Anyway, I was telling
you that..Saahil.

309
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,507
Saahil. - No. Just like that.

310
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,877
Saahil. Saahil,
lam talking to you, right?

311
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,173
You seem lost.

312
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,707
Saahil. Saahil.

313
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,250
Are you alright? Are you sure?

314
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,787
Yes, of course. I am fine.

315
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,446
I am fine. - Are you alright?

316
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,454
Absolutely fine.

317
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,923
Darling, let's go home.
I think you'll be much better.

318
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:15,727
'Hormones.
When they kick in you'll realise.'

319
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,428
Sir, your sex on the beach.

320
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,268
Saahil, what's wrong with you?
I ordered it. What are you doing?

321
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,834
I am feeling really hot.

322
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:24,964
I am just going into
the pool for a dip.

323
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,600
Saahil, where are you going?
Careful, Saahil.

324
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,939
Oh God.

325
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,641
'But you'll remember me when
your hormones start to kick in.'

326
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:33,978
What are you doing?

327
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,156
Saahil.

328
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:17,417
Let go of decency.

329
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,861
Let go of all inhibitions.

330
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,431
Let go of decency.

331
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,807
Let go of all inhibitions.

332
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,575
There is beauty all around.
The world is full of beauties.

333
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:42,107
Let go of control.
Do something indecent.

334
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:46,044
Just become a Casanova.

335
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:49,388
Just become a Casanova.

336
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:53,061
Just become a Casanova.

337
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,531
Just become a Casanova.

338
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,877
Just become a Casanova.

339
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,015
Just become a Casanova.

340
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,189
The eyes of men are a camera.

341
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,495
Zoom in when you get the chance.

342
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:40,074
The eyes of men are a camera.

343
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,669
Zoom in when you get the chance.

344
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,843
Let go of your black
and white principles.

345
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,152
And accept the rules
of the new generation.

346
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,884
You are a lone flirt
in a gathering of girls.

347
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,692
I leave the rest to you.

348
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:07,102
Just become a Casanova.

349
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,628
Just become a Casanova.

350
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:14,165
Just become a Casanova.

351
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:18,305
Just become a Casanova.

352
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,095
Don't bother about your character.

353
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,224

Enjoy life to the fullest.

357
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,347
Don't listen to your conscience.

358
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,485
And relish the beauties around.

359
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,287
Girls are begging your attention.

360
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,062

'But you'll remember me when
your hormones start to kick in.'

371
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,307
Hormones.

372
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,417
Just become a Casanova.

373
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,519
Brother.

374
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,464
Hole three, sir? - Yes.

375
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,429
Sir.

376
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,532
Come on.

377
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:27,001
Behind every successful
man there is a woman.

378
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,444
Come.

379
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,339
That's true.

380
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,519
If you get such success
from one single girl..

381
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,752
"Then how much success
will you get from loads of girls.

382
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:51,223
Brother, even if I
agree with you for once..

383
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,728
"But what if Sneha
comes to know of that.

384
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:03,571
What I am about to tell
you is a really big secret. Okay?

385
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,081
We men have it hidden
deep in our hearts.

386
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,676
Okay. It's like a code. Alright?

387
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,583
Brotherhood. - Brotherhood?

388
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,817
Right.

389
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,757
Brotherhood. - Brotherhood.

390
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:23,161
We men have hidden this
secret in our hearts since ages.

391
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:23,995
You understand.

392
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,059
The great saint guru
flirt had written this.

393
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,369
Guru flirt.
What nonsense. Stop kidding.

394
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,737
Take his name with respect.

395
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,367
Call him the great saint guru flirt.

396
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,934
What is wrong with you, man?

397
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,741
Guru flirt wrote a rule book.

398
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:44,651
In it was mentioned how
we men should cheat on women.

399
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,454
If we men get to
know of these rules..

400
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,116
...then these women can do us no harm.

401
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,558
I'll tell you that. You know that.

402
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,460
And I'll teach you all these rules.

403
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:01,035
But remember. With great
powers comes greater responsibility.

404
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,968
Now guru flirt has become spider man.

405
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,074
Superheroes don't marry. Got it?

406
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,540
Spiderman. Batman.
And even Hanuman didn't marry.

407
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,051
Guru flirt was a rock star.

408
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,953
But I must tell you
that it's not easy.

409
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,551
All this is not that easy.

410
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,661
Sir. - Thank you.

411
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,968
The best lose in this game.

412
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,938
Brother, I am nervous.

413
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,337
Tell me the first rule.

414
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,514
Let me tell you some
experiences of my life..

415
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,553
...before telling
you the rule. - Okay.

416
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,252
It's been like a few years
to me and Nammo's marriage.

417
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:14,639
Go to office. - I hate working.

418
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,810
Bye-bye.

419
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,842
As you guys are aware that
this year has been really nice.

420
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,542
I think we have done a great job.

421
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,779
Congratulations to all
of you and I think we should..

422
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,447
Tell me now. Tell me now.

423
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:30,584
Excuse me. Hi baby.

424
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:34,827
Sure. Why not? Okay. Bye.

425
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,894
You say something.

426
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,630
So.. my wife.

427
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:45,438
God, don't ever change our lives.

428
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:51,076
I wish we spend every
day like this. Right.

429
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,911
Oh God. I love you so much.
- Love you too.

430
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,453
I need a detailed report of the..

431
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,919
Okay. I need a detailed
report of the U.K consignment.

432
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,862
And I want you to check out
on the Hyderabad and Chennai offices.

433
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,766
God, don't ever change our lives.

434
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:16,129
I wish we spend every
day like this. Right.

435
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,901
Good night, baby. Good night.

436
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,601
Listen, I don't have time for dinner.

437
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,373
We'll go when I have the time.

438
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,112
Yes, right. I have been hearing
since quite a few years now.

439
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,952
Don't give me this deprived
wife nonsense. Okay. Don't.

440
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,956
You know, Veena.

441
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,452
I don't feel like
going home these days.

442
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:43,864
So don't go. Relax here today.

443
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:49,171
No, it's not that. I don't
feel like going home every day.

444
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,039
Life has become really monotonous.

445
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,938
Really.

446
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,911
It's like life has
become really boring.

447
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,275
There's absolutely
no excitement in my life.

448
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,969
This? - This is a B-cup size.

449
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,875
Hey baby. - Where are you?

450
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,606
I'm in the office.
Why? What happened?

451
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,576
Really. I was missing you.

452
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,917
I love you for that. Okay, listen.

453
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,090
I'm in a meeting. Little busy.
So I'll catch you later. Okay?

454
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,787
I love you, baby. Bye.

455
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,441
Show me. - Wait. I am showing.

456
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,739
I mean I can't wait.

457
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,904
Take off your clothes.
Take off your clothes.

458
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,574
Wait. Fine. Fine. Okay.

459
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,176
Oh my God! That is so good.

460
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,014
Oh God! I just..
You know it is so hot.

461
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,985
How dare you?

462
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:18,793
Cheat.

463
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,340
I'm sorry.

464
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,738
I doubted you.

465
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,278
It's okay.

466
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,420
Well done. You did it perfectly.

467
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,133
Okay. Also put an earring
that goes with it.

468
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:10,576
I love you. And I am extremely sorry.

469
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,613
Stop.

470
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,979
You mean you had planned all this?

471
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,443
Yes.

472
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:24,652
Guilt. Guilt is
a man's biggest enemy.

473
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,261
Half of the people get
caught because of guilt.

474
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,991
So the first rule.

475
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,867
You know when you cheat on your wife.

476
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,168
You get a guilty feeling.
Give this feeling to your wife..

477
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,069
...before we feel it.

478
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,967
Make her feel guilty.

479
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,344
Since that day your sister-in-law
has never doubted me..

480
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,075
...even by mistake.

481
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,182
I am good. I am so.. - Brother.

482
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:52,683
Hello. - Hi.

483
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,553
Listen, your accountant
had called up.

484
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,219
I didn't pick it up. Call him back.

485
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,694
So sweet. Thank you.
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

486
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,939
Hello baby. What are you doing?

487
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,338
Uncle, you?

488
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,172
Aunt Gunjan, uncle is here.

489
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,942
Really?

490
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,945
Brother. - God bless. God bless.

491
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,014
You should've call.

492
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,388
I would've come to receive you.

493
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:35,124
Chaudhary Shebaar Karan
Singh is still fit and fine.

494
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,996
I can still give these
young boys a run for their money.

495
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,427
Hello uncle. - Hello. - Hello.

496
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,403
God bless. God bless.

497
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:44,632
Where is Saahil?

498
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,572
I'll call him. - Saahil.

499
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,406
Coming. - Saahil.

500
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,605
Come.

501
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,115
God bless.

502
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:01,213
You crook.
You are still a little boy.

503
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,185
Will you be able to handle
the responsibility of marriage?

504
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,655
Brother, you rest.

505
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,891
Okay. Come on.

506
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,199
Mister, marriage is no joke.

507
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,970
The best get defeated.

508
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,643
Got it? - Come.

509
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,241
Thank God.
Here. Here's some energy drink.

510
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,512
People often need
this after meeting uncle.

511
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:39,054
Saahil. Saahil.

512
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,824
Darn it.
You can't carry such light bags.

513
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:49,331
I have to spend my entire
life with a man like this.

514
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,863
What did your father
have against my father"

515
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,001
"that he married you to me?

516
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,637
Why has God made
the custom of marriage?

517
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,578
Gunjan.

518
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,143
Sister-in-law Dolly.

519
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,186
Come. Come.
- You have lost so much of weight.

520
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,011
Thank you. Brother.

521
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,149
Forget it. It's his job.

522
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,659
Saahil. -Aunt. Bless me.

523
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,854
Congratulations. Congratulations.

524
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,056
God bless. - Uncle.

525
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,792
Forget your uncle.

526
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,527
Congratulations on your wedding.

527
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,727
Listen. Listen.

528
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,332
Don't refuse. For my sake.

529
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,239
Keep it. Have ice cream, son.

530
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,835
And listen.
Don't share it with Geeto. Got it?

531
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,712
God bless. He looks so cute.

532
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,346
Listen Gunjan. When I was..

533
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,677
How much did she give?

534
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,320
10 rupees for happy marriage.

535
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,822
I didn't refuse. It's okay.

536
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,086
Oh no. - I think he needs this.

537
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,219
Let it be. Let it be.

538
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,523
No energy drink can cure him.
I swear.

539
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:53,459
Why? - You know. I am about
to tell you the second rule.

540
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,532
Once you know this,
you'll understand everything.

541
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,505
The second rule is
actually a tribute to him.

542
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,876
To him. - This scrawny man.

543
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,036
He is not able to carry two bags.

544
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,377
He was once a wrestler in Punjab.

545
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:07,980
'People used to be scared of him.'

546
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,948
'He had a great body
and was fit as a fiddle.'

547
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,644
'Look at him now.'

548
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,323
lam high. I am high

549
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,063
Gulal, where did you
learn these tricks from?

550
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,032
I am high. I am high.

551
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,701
What happened?

552
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,542
I can't find my bra.

553
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:43,249
You don't need to wear bra.
They are nice.

554
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,753
Keep quiet. Help me find it. Come on.

555
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,121
Darn it. - Find it.
It must be here somewhere.

556
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,352
Have you hidden it?

557
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,918
What am I going to do with your bra?

558
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,361
I can't find it.

559
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,132
Were you wearing a bra?

560
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,631
Hey..What kind of
a woman do you think I am?

561
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,601
Tell me something. Where is..bra..

562
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,612
Why are you getting worried?

563
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,077
Its price is just 60 rupees.

564
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,514
To hell with 60 rupees.

565
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,651
If my wife finds your bra,
she'll cut me into 60 pieces.

566
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,552
So tell her that it's hers.

567
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,893
Right. Don't irrigate me.

568
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,623
Come on. Find the bra.

569
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,024
Then what happened?

570
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,596
That bra is still missing.

571
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,875
Uncle is living in the fear
that the bra will be found anytime.

572
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:46,841
But the bra couldn't be found.

573
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,785
Second rule. It's very important.

574
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,690
Whether your wife
is in Ludhiana or London.

575
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,789
Don't ever bring your
girlfriend at home.

576
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,086
Never.

577
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,592
Second rule. Very important.

578
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,330
Poor chap.

579
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:15,974
'Bra. Bra. Bra. Bra. Bra.'

580
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,714
Uncle Narendra has
come all the way from UK.

581
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:19,907
He has come from UK by air.

582
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,143
He has not come on foot.
lam giving him a nice room.

583
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,344
You are the limit. - What now?

584
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,387
We had already decided. - What?

585
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,353
We will give that
room to uncle Narendra.

586
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,721
But my uncle has already
checked in the suite.

587
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,758
I can't throw him out.

588
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,487
Inder, you are just impossible.

589
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,722
You are impossible. - What happened?

590
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,193
My engagement is taking place.

591
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,691
It's good I am getting
married and leaving this house.

592
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,863
You shouldn't say that.

593
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,667
I am fed up of their daily quarrels.

594
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,469
Just look at them.

595
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,701
They fight everyday.

596
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,807
This is why I don't believe
in arranged marriages.

597
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,449
Are you hiding something?

598
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,384
No. Not at all.

599
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,587
When you can't lie,
why do you even try?

600
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,289
You know.
I won't leave you till you tell me.

601
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,497
So tell me.

602
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:16,629
Sneha, your mother and father
had a love marriage. - What!

603
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,440
Oh my God! I don't believe that.

604
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,975
You are just impossible.

605
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,543
You can do whatever you want.
I am going.

606
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,342
I ruined my life by marrying you.
- So what happened to them now?

607
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,406
I don't know. - Because of your papa
we will never reach the function.

608
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,781
Come quickly, dear.

609
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,090
Very strong perfume.

610
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,601
Do you know? What's the
most dangerous thing in a woman?

611
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,466
What? - Her nose.

612
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,940
She can sniff everything.

613
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,245
Do you know what's more
dangerous than nose? - What?

614
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,211
The power that a woman
has to sniff another woman.

615
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,608
That's why you should buy
the strongest, most concentrated.

616
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,348
...cologne available in the market.

617
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,586
So that your wife can
never sniff your mistress.

618
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,484
Smart. - Give me your perfume.

619
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,493
Here.

620
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,957
Spray it nicely.

621
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:17,927
Here.

622
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,128
Yeah!

623
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,331
Custom. Custom.

624
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:28,106
Custom. Custom.

625
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,922
It's the night of custom.

626
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,792
You need to show your face.

627
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,229
It's the night of custom.

628
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:54,967
You need to show your face.

629
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,899
Switch on the chandelier.

630
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,065
Play the music.

631
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:04,211
Splurge tokens on the bride.

632
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:09,917
My friend, offer me sweets.

633
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:13,113
My friend, offer me sweets.

634
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,556
My friend, offer me sweets.

635
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,823
My friend, offer me sweets.

636
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,062
My friend, offer me sweets.

637
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,262
My friend, offer me sweets.

638
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:33,105
Bed sheet on the roof.

639
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:37,134
Slate on it. Come before me.

640
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:42,879
Come before me.
Don't be upset with me.

641
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,489
Marriages are made in heaven.

642
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,924
If your prayers are strong.

643
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,724
I admire this custom.

644
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:59,825
God has given this gift.

645
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,930
It's a procession of stars.

646
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:10,441
Clarion is playing.

647
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,581
Not just the house,
decorate the entire locality.

648
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:19,018
Splurge tokens on the bride.

649
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,516
My friend, offer me sweets.

650
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:29,758
My friend, offer me sweets.

651
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,529
My friend, offer me sweets.

652
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,197
Offer me sweets.

653
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:49,042
Offer me sweets.

654
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:56,213
This relation of love is amazing.

655
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,194
The breezes give congratulations.

656
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,788
The ring is the promise of life.

657
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:08,336
Always be with your beloved.

658
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,072
It's brought sentiments with it.

659
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:18,011
It's a beautiful season.

660
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:22,616
I pray to God to shower His grace.

661
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:28,214
Splurge tokens on the bride.

662
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,251
Offer me sweets.

663
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:37,732
My friend, offer me sweets.

664
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:41,065
Offer me sweets.

665
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:45,539
My friend, offer me sweets.

666
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,220
You..

667
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,922
Love you, man. - Stop it. Stop it.

668
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,726
Or else the wedding
album won't be made.

669
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,856
Yes, but" - Come.

670
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,127
We have paid the
photographer so much money.

671
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,293
Go. Go. - Come quickly. Come.

672
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,064
Or else you will be beaten. Go.

673
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,394
Photographs. - Come.

674
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,734
We have the whole night.

675
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,068
Shut up. Sit.

676
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,767
Come. Click their photo. Come.

677
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,244
The contractor is asking
for 25 lakhs more. What to do?

678
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,344
Pay him.

679
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,417
Come on, dear.

680
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,560
Yes. Click a nice photo.

681
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,759
Keep it. Don't refuse.

682
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,693
Why are you coming here?

683
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,263
Come on.

684
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,640
Yeah!

685
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:55,735
You guys too.

686
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,350
I love you, Sneha! I love you, Sneha!

687
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,795
'I love you, Sneha!'

688
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,400
Today we have got engaged.

689
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,733
Engaged. Engaged.

690
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,538
Why do they show echo in Hindi films?

691
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,503
WOW!

692
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,675
I feel alive again.

693
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,209
WOW!

694
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,919
What happened to you?

695
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,723
Do you know?
Mom and dad had a love marriage.

696
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,663
Really?

697
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,368
Seeing them, you can't guess.

698
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,015
Hey.

699
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:14,979
What happened?

700
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,782
I was kidding.

701
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:25,963
Saahil, since childhood
I have seen my parents fighting.

702
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,437
I always felt their
marriage is a big mistake.

703
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:36,341
But today, when I found
out that they were also like us..

704
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:42,474
...I mean, at some point
even they were this much in love.

705
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,109
I am really worried.

706
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,589
We won't be like them, right?

707
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,050
Look.

708
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,798
For me we got married 15 years ago.

709
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,628
We are just being official. Right?

710
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,098
And not much has changed
in these 15 years.

711
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,979
I don't even remember
any serious fight between us.

712
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,246
Yes. You have hit me 5-6 times.

713
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,117
I don't know if we
can call that a fight.

714
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,954
The seventh time.

715
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,290
I promise you.

716
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,530
No matter what happens.

717
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,727
We will never change.

718
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,398
Promise?

719
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,240
I hate drop outs.

720
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,517
I hate people who
drop out of their course.

721
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,748
It's the insult of brotherhood.

722
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,121
I mean..
- You can say whatever you want.

723
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,220
I can't deceive Sneha.

724
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,091
You don't know what she is
going through. -I know. I know.

725
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,159
Her parents used to fight, right?

726
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,866
That has to happen, obviously.

727
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,994
Her father is also like you.
Very straight.

728
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,731
Didn't listen to hormones.
He is regretting.

729
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,406
I don't want your children to have..

730
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,035
...the same childhood that Sneha had.

731
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,741
Shravan. - What happened?

732
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,804
The same thing that had to happen.

733
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,976
As usual uncle Surya is late.

734
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,417
His flight has been
delayed by an hour.

735
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,648
Uncle Surya has this
habit of coming late.

736
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,152
Very soon late will
be affixed to his name.

737
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:33,893
An hour.

738
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,395
Come on. Let's have drinks.

739
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,595
In the afternoon.

740
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,635
There is no fixed time
for drinking. Come on.

741
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,102
What to explain?

742
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:50,405
I have to explain how
to control your wife..

743
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,775
...how to handle her.

744
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,647
Look at this. You are teaching me?

745
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:58,550
If I start practicing now,
I will learn by then.

746
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,288
See this.
This is called a dedicated student.

747
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:04,525
Teach him.

748
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,187
Is it his marriage or your marriage?

749
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,091
Shut up.

750
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,424
I don't know why I married you.

751
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,624
Foolish jerk!

752
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:17,296
This..this is men's
plight after marriage.

753
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,345
Can I join you?

754
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,049
No. I am sorry, ma'am. It's taken.

755
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,348
Come on.
Trust me. You won't regret it.

756
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,555
Look, ma'am. I am not interested.

757
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,956
And I told you. It's already taken.

758
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,453
Damn!

759
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,695
Did you see, brother?
Not everyone is like you.

760
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,427
He fought with his wife.
But he is still loyal.

761
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,936
Baby, I missed you so much.

762
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,563
Hello!

763
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,708
What took you so long?
- You know the Delhi traffic.

764
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,445
Sonny, it doesn't
matter to hormones..

765
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,947
"Whether it's a
man or a woman. Got it?

766
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,484
People like you do
discrimination in the society.

767
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,542
Got it? I love hormones.

768
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,684
Naughty-

769
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:12,653
What happened?

770
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,358
Brother, I am tense.

771
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,925
Tell me the next rule quickly.

772
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,127
The next rule.

773
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,737
Truth always triumphs.

774
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,775
Truth always triumphs.

775
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,439
If you ever make a blunder in life,
tell your wife the truth.

776
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,817
Brother, I don't understand.

777
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,981
No need to understand, son.

778
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,850
Look ahead.
The live telecast is going on. Look.

779
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,154
Look.

780
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,753
Look. Look. Look.

781
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,230
Look. - What is he doing?

782
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,461
Look. Look. Look.
- Watch what happens next.

783
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,699
Shall I tell you something?

784
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,208
The pleasure of kissing
a foreigner is different.

785
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,011
Congratulations.
Your marriage is also fixed.

786
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,344
You are marrying.

787
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,918
Aunt has not come? - Aunt is dead.

788
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,924
What? - I mean,
she is bringing the luggage.

789
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,323
She is coming. She is coming.

790
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,091
She is coming. She is coming.

791
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,221
She is coming.
Do you have a cigarette? Cigarette?

792
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,287
Here. - Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

793
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,095
Lighter. Hold this. Hold this.

794
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,030
Hurry UP-

795
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,972
Uncle, cigarette. -Yes. Cigarette.

796
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,771
But I love it. I love it.

797
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,276
Give me your hand. Congratulations.

798
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,747
Where did you disappear,
leaving me alone?

799
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,181
I was searching for you.

800
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:48,456
I see. I came out and was flirting
with a tall, fair, beautiful.

801
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,991
...foreigner air-hostess.

802
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,754
And I kissed her.

803
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,385
Come closer. - In front of everyone?

804
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,454
I told you. Come closer.

805
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,097
You are again lying.

806
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,298
You were smoking cigarette secretly,
weren't you?

807
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,271
I have forbidden you so many times.

808
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,436
Don't smoke.
Still, why don't you listen to me?

809
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,071
Really, Saahil. I just don't
know what to do with your uncle.

810
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,616
Do you know?
One day I went to his office.

811
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,709
He was smoking with his secretary.

812
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,515
Next time when I came home..

813
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:24,923
...I saw him smoking
with our neighbor.

814
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,888
One day when I was not at home..

815
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,260
...he was smoking with the maid.

816
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,526
Maid? - I really don't
know what to do with you.

817
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,535
Kittu, keep the luggage in the car.
I am leaving.

818
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,465
I wish she is leaving forever.
It will be great.

819
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,806
Shall I tell you something?
I love wives.

820
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,270
But other's wives.

821
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,574
Guilty.

822
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,309
Guilty.

823
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:59,357
If I don't find my beloved,
I search for him on the streets.

824
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,259
My beloved has come. - Yes.

825
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:03,160
My beloved has come. - Yes.

826
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,733
My beloved has come. - Yes.

827
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,667
Were you waiting for me to go?

828
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,168
Can I go dance? - Come on.

829
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,576
Hey! Go. Go.

830
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:26,819
WOW!

831
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,484
Wow! Wow!

832
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,462
My stomach hurts.
I wonder what they gave me to eat.

833
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,195
The marriage preparations
are going on fine? - Yes, uncle.

834
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:46,573
Anything amiss? Anything missing?

835
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,976
No, uncle. It's great.

836
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,177
Are you speaking the truth?

837
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,073
Yes.

838
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,648
Young man.

839
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:04,590
Since childhood you pushed
Saahil into bad habits.

840
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:07,788
I didn't say anything.

841
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,600
I thought you are a kid.
You will reform.

842
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,663
But you didn't reform.

843
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,005
Now Saahil is getting married.

844
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,611
Don't teach him anything wrong..

845
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:28,976
...or try to teach
him your philosophy.

846
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,750
What? - Okay, uncle.

847
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,348
Be a nice man.

848
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:40,421
Yes, uncle.

849
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,478
Put some more. Look at my size.

850
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,112
You want to drink?
- Yes. It's the occasion.

851
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:06,653
It's not. We have to go to Sneha.
- I will see you.

852
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:07,778
Come on.

853
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,982
What happened?

854
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,291
Uncle has gone crazy.
He has lost the plot.

855
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,258
Why? What happened?
- He doesn't understand brotherhood.

856
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,126
Forget about him.

857
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:25,964
Listen. When soldiers go for war,
they learn how to fire a gun.

858
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,503
They don't read the
instruction manual.

859
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,669
I don't understand.

860
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:35,710
Look..l am giving you
theoretical knowledge. Right?

861
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,116
If you want to win
the exam of marriage..

862
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:41,018
...It's very important
to apply it practically.

863
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,887
But I still don't get it.
What? What's the problem?

864
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,654
You can't see the problem? - No.

865
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:49,493
I can't see a single beautiful
face here. We need a girl.

866
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:52,123
Girl? - You know,
to experiment, we need a girl.

867
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,634
You know, what we need?
We need a bomb.

868
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,570
A girl who is..very hot.

869
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,573
What are you saying? What bomb?

870
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,007
Hello, cheater. - Hi.

871
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,008
Megha, hi.

872
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,102
Wow! - Hi.

873
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,011
What a pleasant surprise!
I mean, you are here.

874
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,016
It's not a pleasant surprise for me.

875
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:13,617
You left me.
And are marrying Sneha. You cheat.

876
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:17,918
Nice girl.

877
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,454
Megha.

878
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,229
Oops! I am stuck. Now I
will have to go and meet everyone.

879
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,031
Hello, uncle. Hello, aunt. - Right.

880
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,732
Well, I see you. -Yeah. Please.

881
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,796
Hi, Megha. - Damn! Damn!

882
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,070
What is she doing here? - Who is she?

883
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:37,571
She is my family friend.

884
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,840
Last year I got
her marriage proposal.

885
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,279
I rejected it.
After that she went to Kolkata.

886
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,816
I don't know why she has come back.

887
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,910
Sneha must have invited her.

888
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,911
Sneha hates her.

889
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,148
Really? - Yeah.

890
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,656
I don't know how she will
react when she will see her here.

891
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,282
I am..l am dead.

892
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:54,190
I like her. She is good.

893
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,490
Experiment.

894
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,191
God! Well,
as expected, it was terrible.

895
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,996
I mean, I don't know why
people can't forget their past.

896
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:05,639
As such, you are not feeling
awkward to see me here, are you?

897
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:08,568
No. No. What are you saying?
It's fine.

898
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,338
In fact, I am glad you are here.

899
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,004
You are looking fabulous. I must say.

900
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,877
Well, I am here on a business trip.

901
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,882
Dad told me you are getting married.

902
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,612
And you know, I thought I
will come along and congratulate.

903
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,011
And don't worry.

904
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:23,223
Isn't she the same Megha
about whom you keep talking?

905
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,724
What? - Yes.

906
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,893
He really misses you.
lam telling you.

907
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,587
By the way, I am Shravan.

908
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,858
I am his cousin. - Hi.

909
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,126
He really likes you.

910
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:36,393
In fact, he was telling me
that you should attend all functions.

911
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,802
You have to. - Really?

912
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,232
You have to.

913
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,671
Me? - Yes.

914
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,902
Look, don't say no.

915
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,136
You shouldn't break
the groom's heart.

916
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,405
You know what I mean? - Well..

917
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,414
Last few days of his freedom.
You have to be with him.

918
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,609
I love him.
He is a great guy. He likes you.

919
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,845
You got to be around.
I will see you in a minute.

920
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,012
Bye.

921
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,749
Saahil..are you sure about this?

922
01:01:57,513 --> 01:02:00,187
Yeah. I mean, of course.
You should stay.

923
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,621
Mom, I will just be
back in a minute. Okay?

924
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,290
Stay - Two minutes.

925
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,068
That's a surprise.

926
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,468
Hi. - Hi.

927
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:11,266
Hi.

928
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:15,469
Hi, Sneha. Congratulations. - Thanks.

929
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:19,707
Sneha, I am sorry.
But I didn't like your dress.

930
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:23,444
You know, her dressing
sense has always been a problem.

931
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,885
But I hope your wedding
attire is better than this.

932
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:30,015
Because on that day I am
going to wear a very beautiful sari.

933
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,752
I am sure, Megha. - Don't worry.

934
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:34,590
I will try not to look
more beautiful than you.

935
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,025
By the way, honestly,
I was finding it awkward..

936
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,225
...to attend your marriage.

937
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:43,430
But Saahil insisted so much.
That I couldn't refuse.

938
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,870
Is that so? - Well,
you guys have a great wedding.

939
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,533
Have a good time. Yeah? - Thank you.

940
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,077
Bye, Saahil. - Bye. See you.

941
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,478
No. I didn't.

942
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,812
Sneha.

943
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,781
Oh God!

944
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,920
What do I do?

945
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:33,979
That's it.

946
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:38,651
What happened?

947
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,495
What happened?

948
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,191
Don't you feel ashamed to ask that?

949
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,101
For the first time Sneha
and I had a major fight.

950
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:52,404
Now even I believe the priest.
This marriage won't work out.

951
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,565
I am gone.

952
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:54,937
I am done. I am done.

953
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:56,699
You worry a lot.

954
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,571
Right now,
you have to worry about that girl.

955
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,282
You know, the one on
whom we will apply the rule.

956
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,283
I think Megha is perfect for that.

957
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,284
Why do you want me to get
divorced before my marriage, brother?

958
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,146
She is Megha. I had got
her marriage proposal last year.

959
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:12,556
She was in love with me.
Sneha hates her.

960
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,151
That's the reason why.

961
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:15,892
Got it?

962
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,726
She wants to get back at Sneha.

963
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,661
She will do anything for you.
It's an ego clash, buddy.

964
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:25,372
What if because of this ego
clash she tells Sneha the truth..

965
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,998
...and tries to break our marriage?

966
01:04:27,062 --> 01:04:28,700
Do you want to break
my marriage? - No.

967
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,506
I have another rule for that.
But no such thing will happen.

968
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:32,739
Trust me.

969
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,208
I am done.

970
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,116
I am done. Please. I am done.

971
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,948
Please, brother" - Hello, cheater.

972
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,119
Hi. You..what are you..

973
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,549
You had messaged me.
Let's have lunch together.

974
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,993
When did I..when did I do that?

975
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:51,564
Why are you feeling shy? So what?

976
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:53,025
Go and have lunch with her.

977
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,566
You must go to that place.

978
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:55,624
China Gold.

979
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:57,032
And over there okra..

980
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,473
Sorry. Butter garlic crab. Brilliant.

981
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,872
Really? - Brilliant.

982
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,002
Okay. Let's just go there. - Yeah.

983
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,636
Go there. - Awesome. Let's go.

984
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,146
Yeah. Go. - We are getting late.

985
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,205
You message and then show attitude.

986
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:10,409
Brother. - Saahil.

987
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,146
Hold on. I will just come. My things.

988
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:17,757
What happened?
- You forgot your phone yesterday.

989
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:21,287
Saahil. - Saahil.

990
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,292
Let's go. - Lunch.

991
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,694
Quickly. Let's go. Let's go.

992
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:27,233
Time for butter garlic crab.
Come on.

993
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:33,802
Watch drama unfold.
- You are getting married.

994
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,935
Watch drama unfold. - Stop it!

995
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,707
Yes, please. Thank you. - Thank you.

996
01:05:39,768 --> 01:05:41,372
Stop it. What's wrong with you?

997
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:46,681
What happened now?

998
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,780
Enough of lectures. Time for exam.

999
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:50,949
What exam..

1000
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,958
Sneha. - What?

1001
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,393
Saahil. - What?

1002
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,987
What is he doing here?

1003
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,261
Who is that girl? Who is with him?

1004
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:09,999
Hi.

1005
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:15,641
Why are you feeling shy?
Come with me.

1006
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:17,081
Come. - This is embarrassing.

1007
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,650
We are waiting for you for so long.

1008
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,049
We are waiting since two hours.
- Hi, Sneha.

1009
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:23,189
You know, darling.
Now hear the truth from them.

1010
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,952
Both love each other. - What?

1011
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,186
Oh my God!

1012
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:29,627
Okay. Relax. You know,
Sneha is like my little sister.

1013
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,529
She won't tell anyone.
Right? - Right. Of course.

1014
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,999
What happened is that
they met in Kolkata.

1015
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,092
And they fell in love.

1016
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,263
Her father didn't
approve of this alliance.

1017
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,100
So that day at the party,
Megha told me..

1018
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,505
...Saahil,
can we invite him for the wedding?

1019
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:42,304
I said, Of course.

1020
01:06:42,364 --> 01:06:46,506
What" - You don't understand,
darling.

1021
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,378
In our marriage somebody
else will also settle down.

1022
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,907
How cool is that!
I love it. - Thank you so much.

1023
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,647
So kind of you.

1024
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:56,915
And you doubt me. You were..

1025
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:58,855
Fine. Actually, she was feeling shy.

1026
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,222
She didn't want to tell you.
- Leave me.

1027
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,728
What are you doing? What is this?

1028
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,125
Calm down, brother. - Brother?

1029
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,995
We are there. We will convince uncle.

1030
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:09,468
Which uncle.. -You don't understand.

1031
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,027
Come on. - Tushar.

1032
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,538
Neha.

1033
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,040
What are you doing?

1034
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,007
Listen" - I am his fiancée.

1035
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,668
Fiancée? - No.

1036
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,279
No, Neha. Neha. - Tushar.

1037
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,173
Don't show me your face again.
- Neha. Neha.

1038
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,650
I am sorry, Neha. - Go away.

1039
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:27,721
Tushar. - Don't talk to me.

1040
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,216
Please go.

1041
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,452
Come. I hate guys who cheat.

1042
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,119
Because of him..
- Just relax.

1043
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,527
...men are ruined.
- Calm down. Calm down.

1044
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,532
L.. - Just calm down.

1045
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,535
I am really sorry. I doubted you.

1046
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,036
I am so sorry, Saahil.

1047
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,173
It's okay.

1048
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:54,681
You passed with flying colors,
brother.

1049
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,541
Don't talk to me, brother.

1050
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,880
You trapped me.

1051
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,921
It was a test.
- Yeah. Right.

1052
01:08:01,176 --> 01:08:02,519
What if I had got caught?

1053
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,684
Do you know? I was torn.

1054
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:06,953
From where is it torn, sir?

1055
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,960
I selected the best quality cloth.

1056
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,861
Who is talking to you? Quiet.

1057
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,758
You are my student, buddy.
You can't fail.

1058
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,835
Yeah. Right.

1059
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:20,066
What about that poor boy?
He was ruined because of us.

1060
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,166
He is a loser.
Why are you worrying for him?

1061
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:25,101
These dedicated boys deserve it.

1062
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:26,710
Forget about him.

1063
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,214
No matter what you say.

1064
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,517
I am done with all
this brotherhood stuff.

1065
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,980
I escaped by a whisker.

1066
01:08:33,308 --> 01:08:35,288
I won't take a risk again.
Did you understand?

1067
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,554
Why do you keep threatening me?

1068
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,954
You are not doing a
favor on me by learning.

1069
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,394
I am doing a favor on
you by teaching you. Got it?

1070
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:48,525
So please don't do a favor.
Don't do it. Please.

1071
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:51,098
Done. Finished. Over.

1072
01:08:51,326 --> 01:08:52,999
I won't do it. - Don't do it.

1073
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,931
Had you learnt this last rule,
you would have never..

1074
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,670
...faced any problem in your life.

1075
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,940
See you at the wedding.
- Yes. Fine.

1076
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:01,739
Bro.

1077
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:04,776
You will know when
you will get divorced.

1078
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,558
Brother.

1079
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,828
It's hormones. - No. No.

1080
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,198
You can't escape.

1081
01:09:23,258 --> 01:09:24,931
You handle your hormones.

1082
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:27,940
Did you see uncle's plight?
Do you want to be like that?

1083
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:29,669
I won't be like uncle.

1084
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:33,179
Do you want to keep your wife happy?
This is the only way.

1085
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,672
Hi, uncle.

1086
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,947
You want to kiss her?

1087
01:09:40,008 --> 01:09:41,783
No. I don't smoke. Please.

1088
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:42,719
He is my nephew.

1089
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,258
What will you do if aunt finds out?

1090
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:46,482
Kiss me.

1091
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:47,822
Please.

1092
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,063
Harry, you are again smoking.

1093
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:55,193
I told you. Don't smoke.

1094
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:02,370
I can't find the bra.
Where is the bra?

1095
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:06,969
Darn you.
The kid is getting married here.

1096
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,015
What are you looking for?

1097
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:16,779
What are you doing here?

1098
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,584
Sneha has left.

1099
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:23,493
She wouldn't have married
a cheater like you.

1100
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:26,522
No. - Hi, cheater. - No.

1101
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,743
You look so sexy while sleeping.

1102
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,645
Megha, please. Please, Megha.

1103
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,817
Megha, please. - What's going on?

1104
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:55,092
I mean.. my suspicion was right?

1105
01:10:55,617 --> 01:10:58,120
Wake up, Saahil. You are dreaming.

1106
01:10:58,487 --> 01:10:59,591
Wake up.

1107
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,929
Oh my God! Saahil, see your face.

1108
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:06,905
Relax. We were just joking. - Sorry.

1109
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,600
I am really sorry.

1110
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,610
Should you..wake me up like that?

1111
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:14,978
Actually,
we have resolved our differences.

1112
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,813
And I am so glad that you
invited her for the wedding.

1113
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:23,350
Well, I guess I should
give the would-be bride..

1114
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,220
...and groom some time.

1115
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:27,584
Well, I will see you guys down.

1116
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:28,718
See you, guys. - See you.

1117
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:29,955
Bye.

1118
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:31,964
I know what you are thinking.
- What?

1119
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,229
As to how come Megha and
I are together. Right? - Yes.

1120
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,960
But just think about it, Saahil.

1121
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:40,269
First you refused to marry her.

1122
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,939
And now, Tushar also cheated on her.
Right? - Yes.

1123
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,545
I just thought that the least
we could do is be sweet to her.

1124
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,641
Anyway, get ready quickly.

1125
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,912
We are going for dinner. Okay?

1126
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:56,046
We? - Yes.
Megha is also coming along.

1127
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:59,159
Just make it quick, darling.
Okay? - Okay.

1128
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,586
Until now I spoke the truth.

1129
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,793
Both fought like cats and dogs.

1130
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,062
I lied once. And..

1131
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,770
Brother" it works.

1132
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,746
Fourth rule.

1133
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,714
Deny completely.

1134
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:27,116
If your wife sees you with
another girl, deny it clearly.

1135
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,018
Say no on her face.

1136
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,751
And you should deny so confidently.

1137
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,788
"That your wife shouldn't
trust her own eyes.

1138
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:40,023
Brother..this is
practically impossible.

1139
01:12:40,088 --> 01:12:42,568
No one doubts what one sees.

1140
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,304
What happened? - See that.

1141
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:49,569
What? - Aunt Babita.

1142
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,735
She takes pills the whole day.

1143
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:53,279
I am feeling sleepy.
- Aunt, you are here.

1144
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,006
I am searching for you for so long.
- Is that so?

1145
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,743
I have to give you the pill.

1146
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,184
You take such good
care of me, Jhandu.

1147
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:04,189
Aunt, I told you so many times.
My name is not Jhandu.

1148
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,656
It's Fandu. Fandu.

1149
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,660
He is so forgetful, Farida.

1150
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:09,751
I am Gunjan.

1151
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,128
So who is Farida?

1152
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,631
Come, I will show you.

1153
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:17,067
Do you know? She is not ill.
Uncle Popat is unwell.

1154
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:20,538
And she takes pills.
- What illness is this?

1155
01:13:21,496 --> 01:13:22,941
He is a dude.

1156
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:29,212
Popat. - Yes!

1157
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:32,616
What happened?
- What are you doing?

1158
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:34,283
What am I doing?

1159
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:40,724
Didn't you feel ashamed?
- For what?

1160
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:44,022
For what you are doing with her.

1161
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,998
Which girl are you talking about?
- This..

1162
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:50,096
This girl who was here.

1163
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,538
Where are you going?

1164
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,202
Where are you running?
- I am not running.

1165
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:59,268
I am here.
Make a cup of tea for me. - Tea?

1166
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,470
What has happened to you?

1167
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,015
It didn't make any difference
to you?

1168
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,951
What has happened to you?
You are saying weird things.

1169
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:09,283
I am saying weird things. Me?

1170
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,654
What were you doing with that girl?

1171
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,227
Which girl? - That..

1172
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,571
What will you have with tea?

1173
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:32,407
Send whoever you want.
I mean, whatever you have.

1174
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,546
Damn!

1175
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:40,018
Uncle Popat.

1176
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,118
He actually did this?

1177
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:46,488
WOW!

1178
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,118
I mean, that's genius.

1179
01:14:48,316 --> 01:14:52,128
Poor aunt Babita.
She has been to 8-10 psychiatrists.

1180
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,598
No use.

1181
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,595
She is taking pills.
And uncle Popat is having fun.

1182
01:14:57,692 --> 01:15:01,731
Brother, I must say.
We have such a lecherous family.

1183
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,208
Shut up! Lecherous!

1184
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,972
Kittu! - Yes, mama.

1185
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:09,175
Kittu, tell me the truth.

1186
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:12,475
Did you take Rs.200 from my purse?

1187
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,044
No. Why will I take
money from your purse?

1188
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:20,491
Kittu, I am warning you.
Yes. Don't lie.

1189
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:24,361
Yesterday you asked Rs.200 from me.

1190
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:27,730
<i>Yes. As ii you gave
me a cheque of crates.</i>

1191
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:30,099
I will slap you.

1192
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,628
I didn't give you money.
You must have stolen it.

1193
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,504
Kittu, I know you.

1194
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,636
Mother, I swear on you.
I didn't take any money.

1195
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,203
Kittu, here is your stuff.

1196
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:43,579
It was for Rs.250.
I bought it for Rs.200.

1197
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:51,319
You fool.
You steal. And swear on me falsely.

1198
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:55,190
Idiot.
lam fed up of father and son.

1199
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:57,786
His father faints all the time.

1200
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:03,893
And son steals.
Robber. Idiot. Stupid. Thief.

1201
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:09,273
You fool, this rule applies
on wives and not on mothers.

1202
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,304
If you use it on mother,
you will be slapped like that.

1203
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:13,072
He was trying. Well done.

1204
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:18,083
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.

1205
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,077
Listen. - Yes.

1206
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:25,556
Go and perform the
henna ritual for Saahil.

1207
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,518
So that the kids can
start the musical function.

1208
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,254
Or else it will
be quite late. - Okay.

1209
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:30,691
Come.

1210
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:36,065
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.

1211
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,229
I don't like the smell of henna.

1212
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:39,699
Why? - I don't know.

1213
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,105
The smell of henna is so romantic.

1214
01:16:42,797 --> 01:16:45,471
It's ajoyous occasion. Dance.

1215
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,343
It's ajoyous occasion. Dance.

1216
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,246
Do one thing. Tell your
wife to finish the ritual quickly.

1217
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,443
So that we can begin
the musical function.

1218
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,985
Or else it will be very late.
- Is everything going fine?

1219
01:16:53,074 --> 01:16:55,054
Everything is fine.
Check on the catering.

1220
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,622
No problem? - Don't worry.

1221
01:16:56,678 --> 01:17:00,683
Come and groove. Have a blast.

1222
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,094
Where were you? At least
come on time for family functions.

1223
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:05,654
Well, I.. Yes.

1224
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,432
Done? - Yes.

1225
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:14,098
Done? - Yes.

1226
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,573
I know what you are going to say.

1227
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,203
You are going to say you
were with a girl. I know you.

1228
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:22,510
You were smoking secretly.
I can still smell the smoke on you.

1229
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:24,551
So don't lie to me. You got it?

1230
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,948
Listen, leave all this.

1231
01:17:27,008 --> 01:17:30,114
Come and see Mrs. Dillon's
solitaires. Come. -Yes. Coming.

1232
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,919
Go. Sorry.

1233
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:34,724
Hi, Harry. -Will you marry me?

1234
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:35,989
What? - God bless you.

1235
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:39,031
What is this?
- It's not real. It's tattoo.

1236
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,191
Why are you looking at me?

1237
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,598
Go and see your would-be bride.

1238
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:46,469
It's ajoyous occasion. Dance.

1239
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,735
Apply henna.

1240
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,003
Hello.

1241
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,637
Popat, what are you doing with her?
- What am I doing?

1242
01:17:53,868 --> 01:17:56,747
What are you doing,
clinging to this girl?

1243
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,549
What are you saying?

1244
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:03,153
When you are here,
can I do anything with a girl?

1245
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:06,192
You are holding her hand.
- Holding her hand?

1246
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,955
Now you will say..l kissed her.

1247
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:12,054
You did it.
You kissed her. I saw it.

1248
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,335
Isn't she the same girl
who was in our bedroom?

1249
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:20,065
You see the same girl.

1250
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:22,074
At least see some other girl.

1251
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,803
Give me some credit.

1252
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,072
I will have to change your medicine.

1253
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,136
Otherwise you won't change the girl.

1254
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,114
Go. Come on.

1255
01:18:32,173 --> 01:18:34,050
I will change your pill. Come.
- Yes.

1256
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,861
I doubt him needlessly.

1257
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:46,262
Look guys, I am high on brandy.

1258
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,835
I am high on brandy.

1259
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:53,202
I am high on brandy.

1260
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:56,606
'Bra. Bra. Bra. Bra.'

1261
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:59,009
'Bra. Bra. Bra. Bra.'

1262
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,976
'Bra. Bra. Bra. Bra.'

1263
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,847
'Bra. Bra. Bra. Bra.'

1264
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:08,751
'Bra. Bra. Bra. Bra.'

1265
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,812
Oh God! He fainted even here.

1266
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,985
He has humiliated me.
Kittu, take him to the room.

1267
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,187
I will.. - Hi, Megha. Come, join us.

1268
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:17,627
Alright. - Come.

1269
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,596
See this. - Beautiful.

1270
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,768
Saahil is trying to find his name.

1271
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,197
Is this Saahil?
This.. this.. - This one? - S..

1272
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,104
Isn't it the one?
- Damn! It's my boss's phone.

1273
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,972
Can you just pick it up, Saahil?

1274
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,910
Can you just quickly
pick it up? - I..

1275
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:35,106
Saahil, please put it next to my ear.
- What are you doing?

1276
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,649
How do I pick it up?

1277
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,985
Is this the one? - Yes.

1278
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:41,882
Hello. Hello.

1279
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:44,547
Saahil, there is no network.
Come there.

1280
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:46,285
Hello. Hello, sir. -What?

1281
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,488
Hello. Saahil, come to that corner.

1282
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,687
Please. There is no network here.

1283
01:19:49,784 --> 01:19:52,196
Hello. Hello.

1284
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,891
Network problem. - Hello, sir.

1285
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,730
Sir, two minutes.
There is no network. One moment.

1286
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,697
Yeah. Side.

1287
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:00,102
Saahil, just a little.
- There is network here.

1288
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:02,141
Hello. No. Come to that side.

1289
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,734
Hello. Yes, sir.

1290
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,912
Hello.

1291
01:20:07,902 --> 01:20:08,744
Thanks, Shravan.

1292
01:20:08,803 --> 01:20:09,611
You are welcome.

1293
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,280
Just don't fall in love. Okay?

1294
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:14,486
I just want him to have fun.
That's it.

1295
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:16,146
I will take care of it. - Bye.

1296
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,618
Hey cheater.

1297
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:20,620
Megha, this is wrong.

1298
01:20:22,183 --> 01:20:26,529
I know. I know you love
Sneha a lot and all that crap.

1299
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,934
You are getting
married after two days.

1300
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:32,566
And I don't want to waste
time over stupid lunches and dinners.

1301
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:36,135
Shravan told me.
You are also attracted towards me.

1302
01:20:36,197 --> 01:20:37,369
What's wrong with you?

1303
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:39,606
I am going to get married.

1304
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,008
Your phone.

1305
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,919
Saahil saw and he found it.

1306
01:20:51,045 --> 01:20:52,217
Really. - Yeah.

1307
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,000
Guys. Guys,
the only good thing about marriage..

1308
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:07,039
...Is bachelor's party.

1309
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,439
Yes! - Absolutely.

1310
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:13,377
It's Priya's call.
Oh God! Today is Friday.

1311
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:14,811
What happened?
- Saahil, I have to go home.

1312
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:17,008
Why? What happened?
- I had to go to my in-laws.

1313
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,778
I completely forgot.
- Pick up the phone.

1314
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:20,614
You are gone.

1315
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:21,982
Saahil, your aunt.

1316
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,751
Are you crazy? I am getting married.

1317
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:25,923
Sam, your granny.

1318
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:26,958
Are you crazy?

1319
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:30,461
We used her last time
at Raghu's bachelor's party.

1320
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,626
What do I do? Damn!

1321
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,132
Will my grandpa do?

1322
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:35,930
It's been only five
years since he died.

1323
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,060
It's safe. It's safe.

1324
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:38,832
Yes. It will do. - Guys.

1325
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,429
Hello. Yes, Priya.

1326
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,167
Priya, I was coming home.

1327
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,006
I got Gagan's call on the way.

1328
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,839
His grandpa passed away.

1329
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:48,107
I know. It's sad.

1330
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,444
I will have to be with him.
I have to support him.

1331
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,143
Poor guy doesn't have anyone.

1332
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:54,877
I hope you understand, baby.

1333
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:55,977
Yes.

1334
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:57,889
And please tell mom and dad that.

1335
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,583
...next week we will meet for dinner.

1336
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:00,792
I love you, sweetheart.

1337
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,418
Thank you so much for understanding.

1338
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,528
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

1339
01:22:07,388 --> 01:22:09,129
Thank you, grandpa.

1340
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,103
Let's have some fun, guys.

1341
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,206
Gagan, thanks. I love you.

1342
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,010
I don't lie.

1343
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:21,172
I don't lie.

1344
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,747
Have you made all the arrangements?
- Yes, aunt.

1345
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:26,011
Have you kept all the
veneration items in the car?

1346
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,108
Yes, I did.

1347
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,119
What about the water of Ganges?

1348
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:31,680
We've packed everything, aunt.

1349
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:35,453
I don't have to worry
as long as you're here.

1350
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:37,455
Here. - Sneha.

1351
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,726
Yes. - Keep this inside.

1352
01:22:39,787 --> 01:22:45,396
While leaving, pray in our
family deity's temple. - Okay.

1353
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,837
We'll be back soon. By tomorrow.

1354
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:48,067
Go on. - Let's go.

1355
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,067
Call me when you get there.

1356
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:58,108
Give that.

1357
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:00,186
We need some Coniac shots.

1358
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,219
I'm still wearing this.

1359
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,486
Where are you sticking your hand in?

1360
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,822
Sister-in-law, what's his problem?

1361
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:10,158
Inder, I am fed up of him.

1362
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:13,391
Two years after our marriage..

1363
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:15,434
...he started looking for something.

1364
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,902
And he's still looking for it.
He can't find it.

1365
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:18,994
I'm fed up.. - Sonia.

1366
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,164
Call them up.

1367
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,101
Why are you tensed now?

1368
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:27,010
That confectioner
sent the wrong sweets.

1369
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:31,141
Mrs. Gunjan should've
been worried about that.

1370
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:32,445
Hello.

1371
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,979
Dear? - Yes.

1372
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,314
Where's Sahil?

1373
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,756
He's gone out with his friends.
- Strange.

1374
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,194
He's getting married
day after tomorrow.

1375
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:44,893
So why party now with friends?

1376
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:48,457
The children these days,
care less for the rituals"

1377
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,593
...and are more concerned
about partying.

1378
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:50,635
What do they call it?

1379
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,103
Bachelor party. - Bachelor party!

1380
01:23:53,127 --> 01:23:54,902
No need to worry.

1381
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,442
Shravan's with him.

1382
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,943
That's what I'm worried about.

1383
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:07,643
Something for your mind,
your body and your soul.

1384
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:14,054
It's the power to arouse.
The powers.

1385
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,658
I see. I don't want to.
I don't want to.

1386
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:23,566
I see. I don't want to.
I don't want to.

1387
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,535
Where have you brought me?

1388
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,902
We were supposed to
go directly to the temple.

1389
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,703
This is a kind of temple, Sneha.

1390
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,304
Okay, now please open this.

1391
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,677
Okay, okay.

1392
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,108
Relax.

1393
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,747
Surprise!

1394
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:47,525
You know, why can't our
wife dance like this with us?

1395
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:51,394
Shut up!
Henpecked husband. - Forget him.

1396
01:24:51,452 --> 01:24:55,025
We're with angels, and you're
thinking about those witches.

1397
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:56,864
Shut up, guys. - That's my leg.

1398
01:24:57,925 --> 01:25:01,566
But Sahil,
Shravan's filled our life with fun.

1399
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:05,600
Yes. Booze and girls.

1400
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:08,045
Forget the booze,
we drink every day.

1401
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,049
Let's go after the girls today.

1402
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:19,848
Watch me take it down.
Watch me take it down.

1403
01:25:19,947 --> 01:25:23,895
Get drunk now.
Hit the ground. String that around.

1404
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:53,719
Leave him alone.

1405
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:57,855
Thank you. I knew you're a good man.

1406
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,432
Don't thank me, buddy.

1407
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:03,525
These girls are not for you.

1408
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:05,733
Megha's for you.

1409
01:26:06,527 --> 01:26:10,475
No, no, no..

1410
01:26:10,531 --> 01:26:14,536
Every time you said no to me,
you've landed in trouble.

1411
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:15,914
Okay.

1412
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:19,484
Last few days..before marriage.

1413
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:21,451
Alright.

1414
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:22,954
Honeymoon suite.

1415
01:26:24,278 --> 01:26:26,349
Top floor.

1416
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:30,596
Come on, Sneha.
This party's been organised for you.

1417
01:26:30,651 --> 01:26:32,028
Why so serious?

1418
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:33,997
Enjoy it.

1419
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,734
You think I don't know that.

1420
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:44,368
...Sid lied to me to attend
Sahil's bachelor party.

1421
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:46,241
Don't you know, all men are dogs?

1422
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,007
I know about the bachelor's party.

1423
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:49,810
Sahil asked me before going.

1424
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,611
And anyway, I trust him completely.

1425
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:54,050
I know he won't do anything wrong.

1426
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,028
Relax.

1427
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:22,668
Relax, Sahil.

1428
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,149
Just relax.

1429
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,212
Later.

1430
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:40,024
Anyway, thanks for
this party of yours.

1431
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:41,752
I am really not interested.

1432
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:49,729
What happened?

1433
01:28:51,525 --> 01:28:53,971
No..nothing.

1434
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,438
Relax.

1435
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:03,645
I am sorry. - Sahil.

1436
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:05,009
What's wrong?

1437
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:09,020
I'm going. - Sahil.

1438
01:29:09,076 --> 01:29:11,920
No, no, I got to go.
- There's nothing wrong.

1439
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,048
No, this is wrong.

1440
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,490
Hey. Stay. - Sorry.

1441
01:29:14,548 --> 01:29:15,925
I can't do this. - Please don't go.

1442
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,490
Please don't go away.

1443
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:18,757
No, I cannot do this.

1444
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:19,957
Sahil..

1445
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:41,476
On the path..of
life. - Sahil. Listen.

1446
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:47,686
We'll always be together. - Sneha.

1447
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:55,032
Sneha! - Why do I see..

1448
01:29:55,957 --> 01:30:01,464
"This distance between you and me?

1449
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:09,572
The heart that was
delicate as flower.

1450
01:30:11,138 --> 01:30:16,645
Turned to amber.

1451
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:21,056
Where my wishes turned to ashes.

1452
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:31,933
If you aren't with me.

1453
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:38,205
Life is worthless.

1454
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:45,045
What do I do..

1455
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:52,488
With the happiness
that's missing you.

1456
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:07,229
The prints of our memory..

1457
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:14,572
"Exist in the reposition of time.

1458
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:21,947
Every corner of the heart..

1459
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:28,186
...still holds your promises.

1460
01:31:30,684 --> 01:31:36,532
The heart that was
delicate as flower.

1461
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:42,902
Turned to amber.

1462
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:47,703
Where my wishes turned to ashes.

1463
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:58,223
If you aren't with me.

1464
01:31:58,646 --> 01:32:04,927
Life is worthless.

1465
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,394
Hey"

1466
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:10,129
Why did you come here? - To know..

1467
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,070
...why didn't you tell the
truth about Shravan to everyone?

1468
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:18,239
That doesn't prove that
I didn't make a mistake?

1469
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,703
Did you and Megha..

1470
01:32:21,635 --> 01:32:23,546
Then what's your fault?

1471
01:32:24,004 --> 01:32:25,677
I made a big mistake.

1472
01:32:28,642 --> 01:32:32,055
Before the wedding, if I
can dare to enter a girl's bedroom.

1473
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:36,927
Then later,
I can dare to go anywhere.

1474
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:41,633
Unlike Sneha, I deserve it.

1475
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:47,538
Go on.

1476
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:51,065
Who can return me my love?

1477
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:54,779
Who can get me out of this mess?

1478
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:58,476
Who can help me forget my pain?

1479
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:01,884
O Lord, unite me with my love.

1480
01:33:01,942 --> 01:33:05,583
O Lord, return me my life.

1481
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:09,159
O Lord, I don't stand
a chance before you.

1482
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:12,957
O Lord, alleviate my pain.

1483
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,899
O Lord, unite me with my love.

1484
01:33:15,956 --> 01:33:19,062
Oh Lord!

1485
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,607
Oh Lord!

1486
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:26,640
Oh Lord!

1487
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:31,046
Oh Lord!

1488
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:38,288
I don't want to go
ahead with this marriage?

1489
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,585
Oh, God!

1490
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:43,153
What's this new problem now?

1491
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,457
Sahil, what are you saying?

1492
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:47,191
Don't you have any shame?

1493
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:50,993
First that, and now this.

1494
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,801
Take your uncle Suri.

1495
01:33:55,095 --> 01:33:56,597
He only smokes.

1496
01:33:57,031 --> 01:33:59,602
He doesn't have
any other bad habits.

1497
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:02,336
I always knew this
was going to happen.

1498
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:04,639
See, we're in trouble now.

1499
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:06,207
This is a big problem.

1500
01:34:07,107 --> 01:34:08,085
Look, son.

1501
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:10,019
We've been married for 22 years.

1502
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:12,051
But we never thought like this.

1503
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:14,021
But you're already.. - Enough!

1504
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,021
We won't discuss this anymore.

1505
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:23,431
And no one will talk
to Sahil about this. - Yes.

1506
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:29,904
I will talk to Sneha's papa.

1507
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:39,544
Yes.

1508
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:46,384
I don't want to touch. - Come on.

1509
01:34:59,526 --> 01:35:00,971
Fundoo, tell aunt"

1510
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:05,205
Uncle.

1511
01:35:09,803 --> 01:35:11,146
Bless you.

1512
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,653
People can be angry over anything"

1513
01:35:23,717 --> 01:35:26,197
"but he shouldn't
vent it out on food.

1514
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:28,661
I will eat it myself. - Hey!

1515
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:33,438
It won't taste bitter if I feed you.

1516
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:34,772
Open your mouth.

1517
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:46,143
Chew it!

1518
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:49,618
You should always
chew your food properly.

1519
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:56,753
Do you.. love Sneha.

1520
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:05,026
Hey!

1521
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:08,568
Come here.

1522
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,707
I got it.

1523
01:36:14,501 --> 01:36:16,071
You don't have to say it.

1524
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:20,611
The tears in your eyes..

1525
01:36:24,611 --> 01:36:26,613
Is conveying the saga in your heart.

1526
01:36:31,885 --> 01:36:33,262
Don't feel shy.

1527
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:37,965
These tears are a strange thing.

1528
01:36:39,626 --> 01:36:41,196
Elders have said..

1529
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,465
...when the heart's overwhelmed..

1530
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:50,213
...you don't know what to do,
can't take a decision..

1531
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:52,980
"That's when you should
cry your heart out.

1532
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:56,583
Come on. Cry.

1533
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:58,690
Cry your heart out.

1534
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,189
Cry your heart out.

1535
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:07,023
And let your problems
flow out through these tears.

1536
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:10,562
Good!

1537
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:16,073
I really love Sneha, uncle.

1538
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:20,978
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.

1539
01:37:21,068 --> 01:37:23,878
You don't know. -I know it.

1540
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:27,316
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.

1541
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:28,284
I know everything.

1542
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,754
You were tricked.

1543
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:35,522
Yes. I know.

1544
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,585
I do.

1545
01:37:37,951 --> 01:37:40,557
I know all these tricks.

1546
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:42,968
They are dangerous.

1547
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:49,568
I know..that Shravan
tricked you into going there.

1548
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:51,075
To that girl.

1549
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:55,579
And I knew you won't do anything.

1550
01:37:57,004 --> 01:37:58,210
And my..

1551
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:03,211
My faith won!

1552
01:38:04,344 --> 01:38:06,517
I didn't get it, uncle.

1553
01:38:06,613 --> 01:38:09,389
I'm not speaking a
different language, son.

1554
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:14,355
This isn't new.

1555
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:16,231
This has been happening
for really long.

1556
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:19,497
Even we had people like Shravan.

1557
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:22,863
We were instigated too.

1558
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,202
I was even misled.

1559
01:38:29,269 --> 01:38:30,475
The truth is..

1560
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,577
I lost control a few times myself.

1561
01:38:35,742 --> 01:38:38,484
It's true.

1562
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:42,689
When I tried to do something.

1563
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:49,999
...I remembered about
your mother's love.

1564
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:51,936
And I stopped.

1565
01:38:53,494 --> 01:38:55,064
Whenever there's a
war between brotherhood..

1566
01:38:55,128 --> 01:38:57,836
...and love. -Yes.

1567
01:38:58,065 --> 01:39:00,636
Love always wins.

1568
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:02,845
And that happened with you.

1569
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:08,883
If you had been selfish,
you wouldn't have said it to Sneha.

1570
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:13,154
You said it to Sneha yourself.

1571
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:15,021
You cancelled this marriage.

1572
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:18,229
Come on, get ready.

1573
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:21,861
But, uncle.
I thought I cancelled the marriage.

1574
01:39:22,322 --> 01:39:24,427
What now? - What else?

1575
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:26,733
Wear your wedding attire
and go get the girl..

1576
01:39:26,793 --> 01:39:28,136
Meaning? - What?

1577
01:39:28,195 --> 01:39:30,471
Who cancelled your wedding?

1578
01:39:30,697 --> 01:39:32,836
I explained everything
to Sneha's papa and..

1579
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,808
We don't have much time.

1580
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,004
Smp hugging me-

1581
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:39,448
Your marriage is due.

1582
01:39:39,706 --> 01:39:40,980
You know, uncle.

1583
01:39:41,074 --> 01:39:42,644
I hope you won't mind.

1584
01:39:42,809 --> 01:39:44,379
I always thought you're a snoot.

1585
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:46,754
I still am.

1586
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:48,152
Brother Sahil!

1587
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:50,417
Brother Sahil! - Careful.

1588
01:39:50,717 --> 01:39:51,957
Brother Sahil!

1589
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:54,857
Sister-in-law Sneha
is missing. -What?

1590
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:57,993
No need to worry.

1591
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:01,137
This is our own city.
We'll find her.

1592
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:05,204
Understood? - No, uncle. I'll go.

1593
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:09,144
And I'll find her.

1594
01:40:09,836 --> 01:40:11,213
Help me out.

1595
01:40:11,738 --> 01:40:13,809
You're looking pretty.

1596
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:15,147
You aren't ready yet.

1597
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:16,915
The procession will be arriving
any minute now. Hurry up.

1598
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:18,614
You're still carrying
that machine on your head.

1599
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:20,783
They are called rollers.

1600
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:26,564
You go on, I've a stomach-ache.

1601
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:27,564
Stomach-ache.

1602
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:30,568
No, no, I can't leave you alone.
- I said go.

1603
01:40:30,624 --> 01:40:31,694
Go!

1604
01:40:33,493 --> 01:40:35,200
I'll join you later. Go.

1605
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:41,742
Hello. Hello.

1606
01:40:44,237 --> 01:40:45,409
Hi. - Hi.

1607
01:40:45,505 --> 01:40:48,281
What's your name? - Ambika.

1608
01:40:48,342 --> 01:40:50,515
Ambika. Sit.

1609
01:40:52,045 --> 01:40:53,456
Don't worry.

1610
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,661
Like I said,
Sahil will bring Sneha on time.

1611
01:40:57,784 --> 01:41:00,663
You just control your guests. Yes.

1612
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:02,996
Don't let anyone know..

1613
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:05,900
"That Sneha's not at home.
- As you say.

1614
01:41:05,959 --> 01:41:08,838
Just remember,
my honour's at stake here.

1615
01:41:08,895 --> 01:41:11,068
I hope you will handle everything?

1616
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:15,436
It's getting late.
Hurry up. - Coming.

1617
01:41:15,535 --> 01:41:17,208
I'm leaving.

1618
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:25,547
Here's your tea?

1619
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:27,586
Do you need anything else?

1620
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:30,093
Then, I'll get ready too.

1621
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:31,454
I've stitched new clothes"

1622
01:41:31,551 --> 01:41:33,087
...to wear on Sahil's wedding. Yes.

1623
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:39,465
Fundoo.

1624
01:41:43,463 --> 01:41:45,204
Yes. - Hello, brother Sahil.

1625
01:41:45,799 --> 01:41:47,608
There's a new problem. - What?

1626
01:41:47,701 --> 01:41:50,739
Shravan has told everything
to sister-in-law Namrata.

1627
01:41:50,837 --> 01:41:52,783
What? - Congratulations.

1628
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:55,683
She slapped him and left the house.

1629
01:41:55,742 --> 01:41:57,722
What a great.

1630
01:41:59,212 --> 01:42:01,192
Will this wedding take place or not?

1631
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:48,768
Uncle. - Yes.

1632
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:52,003
Is everything okay? - Yes, it is.

1633
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:57,811
But, uncle, you said Sahil
will be arriving with Sneha. - Yes.

1634
01:42:57,971 --> 01:42:59,473
That isn't Sahil.

1635
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,217
Then who is he?

1636
01:43:02,008 --> 01:43:04,215
Phandeshwar Nath Tiwari.

1637
01:43:04,544 --> 01:43:05,488
Fundoo.

1638
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:07,091
That's the servant.

1639
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:13,454
You mean..my wife's
welcoming a servant.

1640
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:15,794
He works for us.

1641
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:17,733
But my wife is welcoming a servant.

1642
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:20,203
My wife is welcoming a servant.
- Handle everything.

1643
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:28,602
Don't hug him.

1644
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:29,908
He'll cling on to you for no reason.

1645
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:32,047
How about me? Uncle.

1646
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,412
Where are you?

1647
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:36,749
Uncle, I was co-ordinating with
brother. I'm coming from the airport.

1648
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:39,016
Uncle. - You won't
find her at the airport.

1649
01:43:39,112 --> 01:43:40,682
I know, I know, I know.

1650
01:43:41,047 --> 01:43:44,494
Stop being so filmy,
and get real. - Yes!

1651
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:46,531
And think where she could be.

1652
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,065
Uncle, you just handle
everything there..

1653
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:50,101
...I will come back only with her.
- Well done.

1654
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:51,929
Uncle.

1655
01:43:53,059 --> 01:43:54,003
Do something, uncle.

1656
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,097
It's his marriage,
what will uncle do?

1657
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:59,135
Uncle will have to do something.

1658
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:04,447
One, two, three..

1659
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:33,442
It's a day of happiness.

1660
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:40,983
It's a day of happiness.

1661
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:42,519
He'll get a lot
of gifts and blessings.

1662
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:45,522
It's my son's wedding.
Play the music.

1663
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,492
It's my son's wedding. Play
the music.

1664
01:44:48,582 --> 01:44:51,028
It's my son's wedding.

1665
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,769
Yes, brother.
- Sahil, Sneha's at Lodhi garden.

1666
01:45:01,828 --> 01:45:03,830
Okay. - Now. Come here now.

1667
01:45:04,564 --> 01:45:06,441
Sister-in-law.
- I'm looking for her.

1668
01:45:06,499 --> 01:45:08,536
No, sister-in-law's
in the taxi right here.

1669
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:12,515
What? - Listen. There's ajam
at Cannaught Place. You can get here.

1670
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:14,246
Come here right now.

1671
01:45:14,774 --> 01:45:16,117
Thanks, buddy.
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1672
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:17,847
You come here. - Copy that.

1673
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:27,988
He had gone out and
he brought back wealth.

1674
01:45:28,054 --> 01:45:31,524
He had gone out and
he brought back wealth.

1675
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:32,934
When the groom's
uncle shakes his leg,

1676
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,529
he'll set the dance floor on fire.

1677
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:35,937
When the groom's uncle
shakes his leg,

1678
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,475
he'll set the dance floor on fire.

1679
01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:40,670
He'll set the dance floor on fire..

1680
01:45:51,745 --> 01:45:53,486
Thank God. You are here.

1681
01:45:54,781 --> 01:45:56,385
What are you doing here?

1682
01:46:01,054 --> 01:46:04,934
He had gone out and
he brought back pajamas.

1683
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:08,529
He had gone out and
he brought back pajamas.

1684
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:10,973
When the groom's uncles
shake their leg,

1685
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,977
they'll set the dance floor on fire.

1686
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:15,980
When the groom's uncles
shake their leg,

1687
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:18,016
they'll set the dance floor on fire.

1688
01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:22,912
It's true that, if you leave me.

1689
01:46:23,476 --> 01:46:23,977
Then I will die.

1690
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,991
I know I'm a scoundrel.

1691
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:30,654
But a dying person is
always granted a last wish.

1692
01:46:32,218 --> 01:46:33,891
Please give me one chance.

1693
01:46:33,954 --> 01:46:37,925
He had gone out and
he brought back a car.

1694
01:46:37,991 --> 01:46:41,461
He had gone out and
he brought back a car.

1695
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:43,007
When the groom's aunts
shake their leg,

1696
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:44,542
they'll set the dance floor on fire.

1697
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:46,008
When the groom's aunts
shake their leg,

1698
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,443
they'll set the dance floor on fire.

1699
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:51,038
When the groom's aunts
shake their leg,

1700
01:46:52,973 --> 01:46:55,954
Why? Why should I
give you one more chance?

1701
01:46:56,409 --> 01:47:00,084
So that you can break my heart,
and my trust again.

1702
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:02,526
It's over between us, Shravan.

1703
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:04,823
I've understood what love us.

1704
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:07,492
What it means to loose it?

1705
01:47:08,421 --> 01:47:11,595
I promise you I..
I won't get up in the morning..

1706
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:13,865
...until you don't
wake me up lovingly.

1707
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:18,069
I won't wear my tie
until you don't tie it.

1708
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:27,919
Neither the village head
misses a beat.. - Go for it!

1709
01:47:28,008 --> 01:47:31,478
Neither the village head misses
a beat nor a village officer.

1710
01:47:31,578 --> 01:47:34,491
Bhangra suits all. Foreigners
are dancing on Indian songs.

1711
01:47:34,547 --> 01:47:35,719
Bhangra suits all.

1712
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:41,061
Foreigners are dancing on Indian
songs. Bhangra suits all..

1713
01:47:41,388 --> 01:47:43,834
Marriage is bond that
spans for many lifetimes.

1714
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:51,308
I've finished my quota
of mistakes in this one.

1715
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:58,480
Now..in all the other lifetimes.

1716
01:47:59,839 --> 01:48:02,115
...I want to give you love.

1717
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:07,214
If you make another mistake,
I will never forgive you.

1718
01:48:15,188 --> 01:48:16,462
I am sorry.

1719
01:48:20,026 --> 01:48:23,564
Some look like kings, some like
queens and some look like jokers.

1720
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:26,440
When the servant shakes his leg,
he'll set the dance floor on fire.

1721
01:48:26,533 --> 01:48:27,944
He'll set the dance floor on fire.

1722
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:32,005
Our servant is shaking his leg.
He'll set the dance floor on fire..

1723
01:48:56,663 --> 01:48:57,801
Uncle. - Yes.

1724
01:48:57,864 --> 01:48:59,468
Everyone's finished dancing.

1725
01:48:59,532 --> 01:49:03,378
All the uncle, aunts,
even the guests danced with us.

1726
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:05,108
Even the band's tired.

1727
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:06,548
How much more are you
going to make us dance?

1728
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:08,209
Enough singing and dancing.

1729
01:49:08,741 --> 01:49:10,550
The auspicious time for
the marriage is passing-by. - Yes.

1730
01:49:10,643 --> 01:49:11,883
Can we go inside now? - Yes.

1731
01:49:11,978 --> 01:49:14,117
But, uncle, he.. - Come on.

1732
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:16,182
But.. - Let's go.

1733
01:49:16,649 --> 01:49:19,425
Come. - Let's go in.

1734
01:49:19,586 --> 01:49:20,792
Come on.

1735
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:23,659
Is there alcohol inside?

1736
01:49:49,482 --> 01:49:51,428
I knew I will find you here.

1737
01:49:54,687 --> 01:49:56,428
Go away, Sahil.

1738
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:00,899
Look, I know you're angry.

1739
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,600
I don't want to see your face.
- Okay, fine.

1740
01:50:04,797 --> 01:50:05,969
Just don't go.

1741
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:08,604
You don't want to see my face,
then don't.

1742
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:12,006
Just give me one
chance to speak, please.

1743
01:50:13,139 --> 01:50:14,209
Just trust me.

1744
01:50:17,076 --> 01:50:19,556
Look. Whatever happened last night.

1745
01:50:23,483 --> 01:50:25,121
Nothing happened..

1746
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,897
Whatever happened last night.

1747
01:50:29,989 --> 01:50:31,127
It was a bachelor's party.

1748
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:33,967
So, Sid got me drunk.

1749
01:50:34,027 --> 01:50:35,938
You know,
normally I don't drink too much.

1750
01:50:37,397 --> 01:50:39,741
You saw me at the wrong place,
at the wrong time.

1751
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:40,607
You..

1752
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:43,874
I was coming out of
her room when you caught me.

1753
01:50:44,571 --> 01:50:46,881
What explanation are
you going to give me?

1754
01:50:47,073 --> 01:50:49,451
You lied to me each time, Sahil.

1755
01:50:49,742 --> 01:50:52,689
You were in the restaurant
with Megha, right?

1756
01:50:53,213 --> 01:50:55,022
And what did you tell me?

1757
01:50:56,583 --> 01:51:00,190
I was such a fool.

1758
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,462
I always trusted
you more than myself.

1759
01:51:04,057 --> 01:51:05,832
It was my biggest mistake.

1760
01:51:06,526 --> 01:51:09,006
And since when did
you become so manipulative?

1761
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:11,442
Or is it just Megha's influence?

1762
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:15,343
Sahil. Sahil.

1763
01:51:15,635 --> 01:51:17,046
Here I am.

1764
01:51:18,404 --> 01:51:19,474
Sahil.

1765
01:51:19,572 --> 01:51:21,449
What are you doing there?

1766
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:24,021
Wait. I'll be right back.

1767
01:51:24,077 --> 01:51:24,987
Anybody there? Please help.

1768
01:51:25,078 --> 01:51:28,821
Sneha, don't go. - Oh my, God!

1769
01:51:28,881 --> 01:51:30,656
Sahil, give me your hand. - Listen.

1770
01:51:30,717 --> 01:51:34,859
Yes. - Pull my shirt,
I'll try to come in.

1771
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:36,525
Pull. Pull.

1772
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:39,666
It's breaking.

1773
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:43,769
Somebody help.
Sahil. Give me your hand.

1774
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:45,036
Shut up, Sahil.
Just give me your hand.

1775
01:51:45,098 --> 01:51:47,772
You were talking about
manipulation. - What?

1776
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:51,041
Do you know brother was
behind all this manipulation?

1777
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:52,047
Sahil, stop your nonsense.

1778
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:53,607
And don't say anything.
Give me your hand.

1779
01:51:53,706 --> 01:51:56,482
He dragged me into all this.

1780
01:51:56,542 --> 01:51:58,283
Oh, God! Sahil, give me your hand.

1781
01:51:58,344 --> 01:51:59,914
Brother's been cheating
on sister-in-law..

1782
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:00,889
...for the last 15 years,
do you know that?

1783
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:02,449
Sahil, do you know what
sister-in-law will say if she hears?

1784
01:52:02,515 --> 01:52:04,654
Are you.. - Sister has left home.

1785
01:52:06,686 --> 01:52:08,495
Sahil, give me your hand.

1786
01:52:08,554 --> 01:52:10,830
You cheated on me,
still I am saving you.

1787
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:11,834
I don't know why.

1788
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:13,461
Just give me your hand.

1789
01:52:13,526 --> 01:52:15,130
I'm tired!

1790
01:52:15,895 --> 01:52:18,466
Why is everyone after
me for no reason?

1791
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:21,872
I didn't cheat on you.
I didn't do anything.

1792
01:52:22,468 --> 01:52:24,607
Okay, Sahil.. - I'm going.

1793
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:25,705
I'm going.

1794
01:52:25,805 --> 01:52:27,045
No, no, give me your hand.

1795
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:29,711
Feeling very sorry. - Sahil, what.

1796
01:52:30,009 --> 01:52:32,546
Tell brother that I forgive him.
No problem.

1797
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:34,454
Ask aunt to stop taking medicines.

1798
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:35,719
Ask uncle to.. - Stop it..

1799
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:37,853
To stop smoking.
That's it. - Give me your hand.

1800
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:39,021
What are you doing?

1801
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:41,031
Tell Kittu to stop
listening to brother.

1802
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:43,567
Sahil, you will fall. Please.

1803
01:52:43,656 --> 01:52:45,431
Say that you forgive me.

1804
01:52:46,092 --> 01:52:47,469
Give me your hand.

1805
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:49,505
Did you forgive me?

1806
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:50,939
Sahil, give me your hand.

1807
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:54,542
I forgive you. I forgive you.

1808
01:52:54,634 --> 01:52:56,443
I forgive you. I forgive you.

1809
01:52:56,502 --> 01:52:58,482
I forgive you.
Sahil, give me your hand.

1810
01:52:58,571 --> 01:52:59,675
Come on, hurry up.

1811
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:02,618
Will you marry me?
- Of course I will.

1812
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:05,719
Promise. - First hold my hand.

1813
01:53:05,812 --> 01:53:09,191
Sorry. I can't hold your hand.

1814
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:11,123
If I do, I will fall down.

1815
01:53:11,184 --> 01:53:13,858
You will have to hold
on to my legs? - What?

1816
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,127
How can I..
Sahil, shut up! Give me your hand.

1817
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:18,191
I'm going to keep
my feet there, okay.

1818
01:53:18,424 --> 01:53:21,462
On the count of three,
pull me inside.

1819
01:53:21,994 --> 01:53:25,373
How can I pull your leg?
- Yes. You will have to.

1820
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:27,172
Pull. -Sahil.

1821
01:53:27,367 --> 01:53:29,973
One.. Two.. jump!

1822
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:32,208
Sahil. Sahil.

1823
01:53:46,919 --> 01:53:49,195
Our love-story might've
been complete.

1824
01:53:49,522 --> 01:53:52,128
"But the marriage horror
story was still left.

1825
01:53:52,191 --> 01:53:55,468
Here. Where were you?

1826
01:53:55,628 --> 01:53:57,130
Making calculations? - I see.

1827
01:53:57,196 --> 01:53:58,732
These days you call it calculations.

1828
01:53:58,798 --> 01:54:00,971
Uncle's still looking for that bra.

1829
01:54:01,033 --> 01:54:02,842
Smile. Smile.

1834
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:15,882
Sister-in-law's really happy..

1835

...with the new guru of her husband.

1836

Yes. These days I'm giving
lessons on love to brother.

1837

And, Sneha and me..

1838

What about kids?
- Of course, you should have kids.

1841
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:36,539
There are few rules
of becoming a father.

1842
01:54:37,003 --> 01:54:39,449
Sahil. First rule..

1843
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:42,819
God, what do I do?

1844
01:54:58,524 --> 01:54:59,628
