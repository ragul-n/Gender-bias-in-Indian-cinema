We don't need to work over
time for you anymore, Peter.

8
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:02,772

Rascal, how long do you take to get ready?

34
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:00,501
It's dark outside.

35
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:01,785
It's not yet morning.

36
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:04,825
How many times shall I
remind you that's a wardrobe?

37

And the door is over there.
- Confusing flat.

00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:09,231
Why did you rent this flat?

If you don't work, you won't have a job.

00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,663
"How will we survive?"

94
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:14,556
"Files pile up and
dust accumulates on them."

95
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:19,069
"Our colourful dreams are
lost in the maze of internet."

96
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:23,488
"God who's busy with Java,
please answer our prayers."

113
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:23,922
"I feel scared."

114
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:28,692
"I hold on to my job nervously."

115
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:32,746
"The boss might come and slap me hard."

116
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,246
"How will we survive?"

"We don't waste time."

141
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,098
Open your glasses.

142
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:53,922
Let me check your eyes.

143
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,651

Oh no!

Take out your tongue.

00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,367
Properly.

147
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:08,366
Problem!

148
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,028
Get down, come.

149
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,582
He's serious.

150
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:18,555
What's your name?

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,164
Siddhartha Sikdar.

We've no other option.

154
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:28,934
He threatens that he'll
fire us if we ask for leave.

155
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:31,258
It's not his mistake (dosh).

156
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:35,218
No, not 'Bose', my surname is Sikdar.

157
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,798

00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,609
Let him wait.

162
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,758
You work when you're in office
and even work when you're not in office.

163
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,392
You'll die if this continues.

164
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,582
Try to live.

165
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:02,271
He's suffering from
short term memory loss.

00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:04,109
You'll suffer from
long term memory loss.

167
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,217
It won't stand erect.

168
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:11,096
Value your teeth when you have it.

169
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:13,839
We can't replace this
teeth with dentures.

170
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,055
Go on a vacation.

171
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,339
Try to get rid of stress.

172
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,487
Or you'll be in trouble.

173
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:29,149
We'll lose it.

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,176
We can't replace it with artificial one.

175
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:09,527
Vacation!

176
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,289
"Does anyone know?"

177
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:02,816
"Or don't they?"

178
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:08,357
"Does anyone know?"

179
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:11,910
"Or don't they?"

180
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:17,870
"We didn't know where it was yesterday."

181
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:25,033
"But somehow we got the
hint of light this morning."

182
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:30,101
"I never saw so much light before."

183
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:34,655
"I never saw so much light before."

184
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:39,451
"I never saw so much light before."

185
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:44,020
"I never saw so much light before."

186
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:06,358
"We've come to explore
the distant lands."

187
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:10,816
"We've experienced
the infinite silence."

188
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:20,330
"The shade of the tree calms
down the unruly tired body."

189
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,992
"We didn't know where it was yesterday."

190
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:32,100
"But somehow we got the
hint of light this morning."

191
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:40,181
"I never saw so much light before."

192
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:44,843
"I never saw so much light before."

193
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,369
"I never saw so much light before."

194
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:53,680
"I never saw so much light before."

195
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:16,544
"The clouds come looking
for other clouds."

196
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:21,044
"The wind messes up the tresses."

197
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:25,490
"It would've been better
if we stayed back here."

198
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:30,490
"Our faces get dirty
on the journey back."

199
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:36,138
"We didn't know where it was yesterday."

200
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:44,098
"But somehow we got the
hint of light this morning."

201
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,098
"Does anyone know?"

202
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,517
"Or don't they?"

203
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:58,112
"Does anyone know?"

204
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,692
"Or don't they?"

205
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:05,490
"We didn't know where it was yesterday."

206
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:14,800
"But somehow we got the
hint of light this morning."

207
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:19,800
"I never saw so much light before."

208
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:24,313
"I never saw so much light before."

209
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:31,921
"I never saw so much light before."

210
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,557
Sidhu.. Sidhu..

211
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,137
Turn on the wifi. Yes.

212
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,462
I'm sure you forgot to
send the mail at the last minute.

213
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,462
I'm getting constant mails from office.
- I..

214
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:47,989
Pablo..
- Yes.

215
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,881
..get rid of this hangover.

216
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,691
We're not in office now.
We're on vacation. So, enjoy.

217
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,380
But, we must send
the replies to the mails. - Oh no!

218
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:04,218
Oh no! Sorry. Relax and enjoy.
- Yes.

219
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:11,651
Lymph sarcoma..
- Of Einstein.

220
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,056
Intestine.
- Yes.

221
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,421
Interesting!

222
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:20,583
I've heard someone suffered
from this disease in some movie.

223
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,663
Rajesh Khanna in the movie 'Anand'.
- Yes.

224
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:24,811
I've also contracted
the disease out of sadness.

225
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:29,851
FNAC report.
Prescription. Blood test report.

226
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,986
We need leave for at least seven days.

227
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:34,946
9 days' leave if we
count the traveling time.

228
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:36,960
10 days counting the resting period.

229
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,703
And one day for shopping.

230
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:40,189
A total of eleven days.

231
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:42,906
Shopping?
- For medicines, sir.

232
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:44,744
I need to buy them.

233
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:49,203
Where will you go?
- Nepal.

234
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:51,893
Bombay.

235
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,542
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
- In Bombay.

236
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:55,907
My disease will get cured if I go there.

237
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,962
You're lying to bunk work.

238
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:02,759
You're not my relative.

239
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,664
No leave. Get out.

240
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,664
No leave?
- No.

241
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,854
Sidhu..
- Demonstrate.

242
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,597
Intestine or Frankenstein?

243
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:25,556
Next, depression.

244
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:31,840
Death is poetry, sir..

245
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:35,961
Oh no!

246
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:40,934
This? - Disoriented behavior.
He can do anything.

247
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:43,231
Enough. Enough. Take him away.

248
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,056
Sir, leave?
- Sanctioned.

249
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:47,881
Done! Let's go.

250
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,002
Leave her. Meenamma.

251
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,273
Meenaamma.

252
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,273
"The breeze caresses my face and eyes."

253
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,544
"I love this experience."

254
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,788
"Let's forget about
the office work and relax."

255
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,424
"The breeze caresses my face and eyes."

256
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:47,653
"I love this experience."

257
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:54,423
"Let's forget about
the office work and relax."

258
00:21:54,747 --> 00:22:01,936
"I feel a bit scared as there
are mixed feelings within me."

259
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:07,437
"My hands shiver, the night calls out."

260
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:11,059
"Life is taking a new turn."

261
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:15,343
"As we go there."

262
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:22,140
"I'm ready."

263
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:29,396
"I'm ready."

264
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:52,329
Lift! Lift!

265
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:01,589
Hi!
- Hi!

266
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:05,495
Hi! Hello!
- Hi!

267
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:07,644
Hello!
- Hi!

268
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,346
So sweet!

269
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,793
Are you a Bengali?
- Hmm..

270
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:16,860
Oh! So sweet!

271
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,846
I'm Sidhu.
- Sunny.

272
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,765
Rai. Pallavi.

273
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,589
We set out for trekking.

274
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:27,156
We're not used to it so we're tired.

275
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:28,900
We're also out of breath. Isn't it?

276
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,400
If you don't mind, please give us lift.
- Of course.

277
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,251
Why are you even asking?
- Thank you.

278
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,629
In which direction are you going?
- We are..

279
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:40,021
In your direction. Please come.

280
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:41,926
Thank you so much.

281
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,750
It's going to be great.

282
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,399
What happened?

283
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,710
What do you exactly plan to do?

284
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,102
Will the girls go with us?

285
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:52,669
Look at them.

286
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,075
Stop flirting with girls.

287
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:55,345
We'll go on our way.

288
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,683
No need to give lift to anyone.

289
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:58,129
But this is for the sake of humanity.
- Shut up.

290
00:23:58,751 --> 00:23:59,832
Inhumane.

291
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:01,575
Where did they go?

292
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:02,670
Where did they go?

293
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:04,684
Oh no!

294
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:07,820
Awesome!

295
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,644
Your responsibility. I'm out of it.

296
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:25,414
I hope there's no problem.
- No. Not at all.

297
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:27,333
It's a short distance.

298
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:41,712
Is this your first time in Kamalkundu?

299
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:48,848
Kathmandu.

300
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:51,186
Oh! Yes. it's our first time.

301
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,551
Would you like to have one?

302
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:57,699
We've these.
- In our bag.

303
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:00,092
Take it.

304
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,132
Will you please stop over-reacting?

305
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,781
Excuse me.
Please stop the car if you spot a shop.

306
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:09,025
I want to buy cheese.

307
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,362
Jam and jelly.
- Juice.

308
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:18,443
Please stop near a
shop selling these items.

309
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:22,957
Hey! Your shampoo bottle has cracked.

310
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,389
We need to buy a new one.

311
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:27,267
Will we get herbal shampoo here?

312
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:31,051
Please stop at a shop
selling herbal shampoos.

313
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:34,606
Oh no!

314
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,458
You wanted to have momos. Right?

315
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:39,187
Will we get momos here?

316
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:41,255
You want a shopping mall. Right?

317
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,903
Will we get one here?
- Yes.

318
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:45,768
There's a shopping mall here.

319
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:50,160
Get down. Get down from the car.

320
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,106
Go your own way.

321
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:52,268
Brother..
- Out! Out!

322
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:53,106
..calm down.

323
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:54,619
You don't interfere. I'll handle them.

324
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:56,133
Hey! How dare you?

325
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:57,417
How dare you touch me?

326
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:58,336
I've done the right thing.

327
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:00,931
If you show off in English
I'll throw you down the valley.

328
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,823
They should be thankful
that we offered them lift.

329
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,538
But they want to go shopping for jams,
shampoos and eat momos.

330
00:26:05,618 --> 00:26:07,336
I told you not to give them lift.

331
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,795
Inhuman! Now look at them.

332
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,497
Hey you idiot!
Whom did you call inhuman?

333
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,876
Whom did you call idiot?

334
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:14,863
Uncultured brute.

335
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:19,957
If you act too smart
we'll put out everything.

336
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:21,903
Why are you repenting now?

337
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:23,417
Did you hear their language?

338
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,944
You're using very bad language.

339
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:28,377
You seem to belong to a decent family.

340
00:26:28,457 --> 00:26:29,390
Let me explain the matter.

341
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,674
Decent family?
Look how they're behaving..

342
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:32,931
Hey!
- Hey!

343
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:35,079
Mind your language, you.. idiot..

344
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,808
Again?
- We're not like that.

345
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:40,595
C'mon hit us.

346
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:45,864
Mr. Sidhu..
Mr. Sidhu.. please come here quickly.

347
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:47,730
We're getting late for the show.
Mr. Sidhu..

348
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,486
What happened?
- Where's Sidhu?

349
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,379
Get in the car.

350
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:51,784
Your dad knows where Sidhu is.

351
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:53,568
Sunny, come here. Come here.

352
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,947
Please be calm.

353
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:57,974
You're acting too smart.
Get in the car.

354
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,826
Try to change your behavior.

355
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:02,272
You've seen just the
basic not our instinct.

356
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:03,623
Look how she's talking.
- Hey!

357
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:05,568
You've been acting
too smart for a long time.

358
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:06,907
I've done the right thing.

359
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:09,407
I'll thrash you badly.
C'mon, pick up the bags.

360
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:10,921
C'mon pick up the bags.

361
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:14,016
Here are your bags. Off we go.

362
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:16,123
Bye.
- Hey!

363
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,962
To hell with you.
- Rascals!

364
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,300
Are you feeling uneasy?

365
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,192
Hold on. Relax.

366
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,138
Drink water.
- These rascals..

367
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:33,422
I won't spare these rascals.
Just wait and watch.

368
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:35,922
No.. don't lose temper.

369
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:38,368
If you weren't with me..
- Don't pretend.

370
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:42,098
Okay. Let's click a nice selfie.

371
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:44,436
You and your love for photos.

372
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:47,139
Nursery friends..
- In Nepal.

373
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:51,949
How is it?
- Very good.

374
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:54,152
I'll post it on social media.
- Of course.

375
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:57,152
Then what next?
- What next?

376
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:02,612
Another car.
- Yes!

377
00:28:03,153 --> 00:28:04,207
I'll get the bag.

378
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,774
Lift.. lift.

379
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:13,274
Stop! Stop!

380
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,043
Hi, baby!

381
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,030
Hi!
- Hi!

382
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,260
Lift?
- Sure.

383
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:42,746
The girl held my collar.
- Rai.

384
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:48,098
She looked sweet
when she was abusing me.

385
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:53,165
Is it a quality?
- Of course.

386
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:57,395
Haven't you read Kamasutra?
It is a quality. - Hey..

387
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,260
Don't say anything.

388
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,544
He doesn't like it.

389
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:05,544
What happened?

390
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:13,327
Excuse me.

391
00:29:13,407 --> 00:29:15,232
Want to have some beer?
- No.

392
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,556
Oh! C'mon, baby. Let's have some fun.

393
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:22,502
Fun?
- Fun?

394
00:29:22,582 --> 00:29:23,867
Sure!

395
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:31,408
Brother, I heard that Nepali
people are honest and humble.

396
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,718
They're teasing us
and you're supporting them?

397
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,448
It won't happen again, sister.

398
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:42,636
If they repeat this
mistake I'll bury them here.

399
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,623
I'll take you to
your destination safely.

400
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:49,515
Will you do what we tell you to?

401
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:51,596
Thank you, brother.

402
00:29:53,852 --> 00:29:56,717
I think it's a serious problem.

403
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,690
He said that it would take ten minutes..

404
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:00,015
..but there's problem
with the stephny too.

405
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:01,380
Not sure how long it'll take.

406
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:03,029
Oh god! What a problem!

407
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:06,259
At what temperature
does urine freeze into ice?

408
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:08,461
Put it in a deep freezer and check.

409
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:11,366
How will I get one here?

410
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:13,569
He's fooling with me.

411
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:18,651
Sidhu Sikdar. First boy of our class.

412
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,232
More talented than us.

413
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,164
It's difficult to understand
how things change in life.

414
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:24,543
I get confused at times.

415
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:28,286
He speaks nonsense most of
the times but sometimes he talks sense.

416
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:33,435
We've work pressure 24*7.

417
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:35,503
We needed a break to relax.

418
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:38,435
And for that we had to
turn him into a cancer patient.

419
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:40,165
We had to lie.
- Right.

420
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,868
Hey! Hold this.

421
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:48,584
Pass the fire.

422
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:52,503
Yes, mom. Tell me.

423
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:54,813
No. We haven't reached yet.

424
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:56,948
It's good that you called me.

425
00:30:57,151 --> 00:30:58,975
Dr. Roy had called
but I forgot to tell you.

426
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,719
He told that dad's blood
pressure should be checked..

427
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,760
..at least twice in a day.

428
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,800
Please do it.

429
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,976
Okay, mom. We're absolutely fine.

430
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,165
It's not very cold here.

431
00:31:09,354 --> 00:31:10,624
I'll go to the hotel and call you.

432
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:12,773
Okay. I'll hang off now. Bye.

433
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:18,259
Who? Auntie?
- Yes.

434
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:22,070
Parents become sentimental with age.

435
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:26,179
That's why I told you
to get married many times.

436
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:27,881
If not for yourself
then at least for auntie.

437
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,043
Excuse me.

438
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:31,177
You're the last person
who should lecture me..

439
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,650
..about marriage. Please.

440
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:37,798
Whenever I told you to
get married you've attacked me.

441
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:41,042
Look, I'm like this.

442
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,109
I'll lead my life this way.

443
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:47,744
Look at me.
A carefree life, come, enjoy and leave.

444
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:52,339
And you? You are stuck
in your past with Rehana.

445
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:53,745
Shut up.

446
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,447
Don't comment on
something you don't know.

447
00:31:58,204 --> 00:31:59,907
Carefree life. Right?

448
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:02,000
You tried to be very
nice and offered them lift.

449
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,879
You tried to help them but
they taught you a good lesson.

450
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,582
I failed to understand them.

451
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,352
If I meet them again I'll teach them
a good lesson that they won't forget.

452
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:12,271
Smoke!

453
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:14,987
Hi-tech smoke.

454
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,000
Clear images in my hi-tech phone.

455
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,257
Take a look.
- What do you mean?

456
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:20,595
It didn't turn into ice when I peed.
- Oh no!

457
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,054
You clicked photos of urinating
with this smart phone?

458
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:25,284
Yes. As a proof.

459
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:27,946
We must adjust according
to the situation.

460
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,379
When will the car get repaired?
- I don't know.

461
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:32,136
We unnecessarily paid
such a high rent for the car.

462
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:34,149
We're already late.

463
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:36,824
Won't the car get repaired?
- No.

464
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:40,271
I'm hungry. Where will I eat?

465
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:42,230
Let's see if we get another car.

466
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:43,095
Bad luck.

467
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:44,960
There's nothing around.

468
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,149
There's a car.

469
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:48,149
Let's go.
- Car, stop!

470
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,460
Lift.
- Lift.

471
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:55,027
Brother, please stop.
- Stop the car.

472
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:02,122
Brother, handle them.

473
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:04,716
You're teasing the girls?

474
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:08,432
Don't you've women in your family?

475
00:33:08,743 --> 00:33:11,527
I'll thrash you badly. Got it?

476
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:15,203
Just wait and watch what
I do if you tease the girls.

477
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,581
Brother, let them go. Enough.

478
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,473
Let's go.

479
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:21,838
Bye!

480
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:28,878
Hey! Scoundrel!

481
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,257
I'll kick you hard.

482
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:32,608
Trying to act smart.

483
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,609
Hey! Trying to act
smart with the local guys.

484
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:36,703
I'll teach you a lesson.

485
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:41,648
Captain Haddock.

486
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:46,230
He's always in bad mood. But why?

487
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:50,328
Do you remember the girl
named Rehana who was in his life?

488
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:52,490
The one who wore specs?
- Yes. From the Economics department.

489
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,868
She was our junior.

490
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:57,828
She ditched him and
he had 20 pills for her.

491
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:02,977
Suicide.
- Idiot! Then who's standing there?

492
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,422
You're right.

493
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,963
He had antacid pills by mistake.

494
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,327
Gublu..
- Who's Gublu?

495
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:18,449
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:19,530
What happened all of a sudden?

497
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,692
I didn't know about
your girlfriend Rehana.

498
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:25,096
Why did you tell him?
- What?

499
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:25,907
What did you tell him?

500
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,191
What did you tell me?
- What did I tell you?

501
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:29,991
What did you tell him?
- What did you say?

502
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:33,220
Run! Run!

503
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:35,491
Scoundrel! Wait, I'm coming.

504
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,139
"The monotonous boring life..'

505
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:42,287
"Close to the earth."

506
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,206
"I've covered my face with the fog."

507
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:49,531
"They're the tricks played by the sun."

508
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,342
"On leisure evenings.."

509
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:56,802
"..the scale of the
song keeps changing."

510
00:34:56,882 --> 00:35:00,031
"Somebody follows barefooted."

511
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:03,532
"It merges with my being."

512
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,518
"Perhaps when we go there."

513
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:15,842
"I'm ready."

514
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:22,504
"We absorb the fragrance of the hills."

515
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:31,301
"We're close to our
dreams on this holiday."

516
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:37,585
"We won't stop shouting."

517
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:41,409
"We won't stop."

518
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:48,991
"I'm ready."

519
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:55,180
"I'm ready."

520
00:35:55,897 --> 00:36:02,680
"I'm ready."

521
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,896
"I'm ready."

522
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:30,775
Let's go to the reception.

523
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:38,762
Hello.

524
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:39,991
Who is this?

525
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:42,342
This is Aiyyo Swamy. How are you?

526
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,518
I'm fine.

527
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,126
The nature here is beautiful
and so are the hills.

528
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,464
The snow here is also good.

529
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:49,289
Snow in Mumbai?

530
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,140
What about your cancer?

531
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,654
Cancer?

532
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,560
I've got a call. Who has cancer?

533
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,533
Hello.

534
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:00,614
Hello.

535
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,493
Hello. Who is this?

536
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:06,709
It's me. Aiyyo Swamy Chintpathy Iyer.

537
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:08,939
Yes, sir.

538
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,587
Why is Sidhu talking about snow?

539
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:16,953
No, sir. He's in coma so..
he's being taken to the OT.

540
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:17,831
Oh god!

541
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:22,980
What kind of OT is this?

542
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,696
There are weird sounds
like that of an auto.

543
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,966
Sir, can I call you later?

544
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:28,412
Later. Bye.

545
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:30,453
Bye.

546
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,480
What happened?

547
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,318
I said he's in OT.

548
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:36,074
I heard auto.

549
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:40,871
I want to know who has cancer.

550
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,154
Shut up!

551
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,344
Do you realize what he was about to do?

552
00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:46,641
He would've told Aiyyo Swamy everything.

553
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:50,452
Rascal, if you answer
any call without informing us..

554
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,344
..I'll kick you hard.

555
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:54,087
Oh no!

556
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,224
Brother, your brother is very rude.

557
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:09,481
Hi-tech phone. Intel life.

558
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,590
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

559
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:42,386
Who are they?

560
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:49,953
We've a reservation.

561
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:52,467
Okay. Thank you.

562
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:54,251
Sir, this is the form.

563
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,048
And you've to fill up the form, sir.

564
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,724
Sunny Ghosh.
- Okay.

565
00:38:59,022 --> 00:38:59,981
Pablo Bose.

566
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:01,643
And Siddhartha Sikdar.
- Alright.

567
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:05,213
O god! Hey Gublu,
Piglu, what are your names?

568
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:06,037
Let's go.
- What happened?

569
00:39:06,117 --> 00:39:08,024
My friends, where are you?
- What happened?

570
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,051
All mess.

571
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:11,132
Did you get a phone call?

572
00:39:11,212 --> 00:39:12,632
No it doesn't look like a phone.

573
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:13,618
There were two of them.

574
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,402
They gave me goose-bumps.

575
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:18,200
Hedgehogs.
- No. They were different.

576
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:20,119
Come with me.

577
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,727
What's this?

578
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,822
Where are you going?

579
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:23,727
Come.

580
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:25,322
Will you tell us?
- There were two of them.

581
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:26,404
What? Where are they?

582
00:39:26,484 --> 00:39:28,079
They're not here. They were two of them.
They're not here anymore.

583
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,958
What? I'll slap you hard.

584
00:39:30,282 --> 00:39:31,607
He always disturbs me.

585
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:32,850
Bring him along.

586
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,147
Believe me.
There were two of them here..

587
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:50,013
Oh no!

588
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,350
Sorry.

589
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:06,945
She has left.

590
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:09,310
Friend, get up.

591
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:22,364
Lovely!

592
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:28,783
Chinese people.

593
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,837
Wait.

594
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:02,257
Tourist from India.

595
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,256
Bye.

596
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:08,229
Hey! Do you know who we are?

597
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,823
We pick up with one hand
and sell off with the other.

598
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,675
Oh! You're gardeners.

599
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:16,526
You'll realize what
we are if we slap you hard.

600
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:18,445
Where are the other two?

601
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,540
That's the main point.

602
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,756
I can't quarrel and fight.

603
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:25,472
My friends Nusu and Kabul can fight.

604
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:26,783
What happened?

605
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:27,540
Here you are.

606
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,674
What's this? They're back again.

607
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,310
Look at the two weightlifters.
- What?

608
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,458
They were waiting for lift.
- Shut up.

609
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:39,634
We'll handle them.

610
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:41,431
Hey!

611
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:42,904
Put down your finger.

612
00:41:45,661 --> 00:41:46,823
How dare you?

613
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:47,836
Oh god!

614
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:49,634
Let's go.

615
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:51,998
Let's go.

616
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,363
How dare they slap us?

617
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,444
My name is not Pablo if I
don't take revenge for this insult.

618
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,471
Did you ever get
slapped by girls before?

619
00:42:08,378 --> 00:42:10,229
Let's plan how we'll take revenge.

620
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:13,742
You suggest something.

621
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,067
Lentils, rice,
potatoes in poppy seed paste.

622
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:21,013
Together with it..
- What did you say?

623
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:26,229
Lentils, rice,
potatoes in poppy seed paste.

624
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,728
Is it mentioned in the menu?
- No.

625
00:42:30,485 --> 00:42:32,242
Nepali Thakali is mentioned here.

626
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:35,215
I'm hungry. If I could get
potatoes cooked in poppy seed paste.

627
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:39,202
I'll teach you a good
lesson and then feed you.

628
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:40,337
You want to have potatoes
in poppy seed paste here.

629
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,662
I'll thrash you so badly that..

630
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,404
Tea for you.

631
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:40,026
Hey rascal!

632
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,985
Yes, go there. C'mon.

633
00:43:52,742 --> 00:43:54,566
Turn. Smile.

634
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:01,012
Let's go.

635
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:02,675
It seems that we're modeling.

636
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:07,742
This place is awesome.
- Yes. it's so beautiful.

637
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:10,984
Stand here.

638
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,160
Love you.

639
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,120
Let's go.

640
00:44:23,147 --> 00:44:24,255
Come on.

641
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:25,904
Wow!

642
00:44:27,971 --> 00:44:29,985
Go and stand there.
- Okay.

643
00:44:31,512 --> 00:44:32,823
Show it to me.

644
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:34,742
Wow!
It's your turn now.

645
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:38,174
Sit down.

646
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,918
Keep quiet.

647
00:44:41,268 --> 00:44:42,160
Isn't it good?

648
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,363
Let's go there.

649
00:44:43,443 --> 00:44:44,579
We'll nice pictures there.

650
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:45,768
Come, let's go there.

651
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:50,660
Thank god.

652
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,768
Lovely!

653
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:03,943
I..

654
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:07,551
Just a minute.

655
00:45:17,025 --> 00:45:21,119
What's your name?
- Kanchi.

656
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:23,579
Your name?

657
00:45:32,984 --> 00:45:33,903
Come.

658
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:39,051
It's chilling here.

659
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:43,349
It's so cold out here.

660
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:44,916
But what a beautiful view!

661
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:46,538
Beautiful!

662
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:50,660
What are you having? Lemons?

663
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:55,038
What happened?

664
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:57,390
Softly. Don't shout.

665
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:14,078
Rai.. we've taught all
three of them a good lesson.

666
00:46:14,754 --> 00:46:16,794
They start flirting
the moment they spot girls.

667
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,200
Absolutely.
- What are they saying?

668
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:23,768
That fellow named Sunny
looks like a baboon. Isn't it?

669
00:46:25,362 --> 00:46:28,335
Is his backside red?
- Maybe.

670
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:31,092
The moment I see him I
just wish to pelt stones at him.

671
00:46:32,348 --> 00:46:34,429
We should've slapped them more.

672
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:35,821
What do you say?

673
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:38,213
We should've slapped them hard.

674
00:46:45,794 --> 00:46:49,632
But Nepal is a beautiful place.
- Yes.

675
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,389
This trip wouldn't have
been possible without you.

676
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,213
God knows where I'll be in future.

677
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,740
Where will you go?

678
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:01,970
Why shall I tell you?

679
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:12,321
"Wherever you go,
my shadow shall follow you."

680
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:13,740
Just a second.

681
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,619
One. Two. Three.

682
00:47:20,753 --> 00:47:22,901
Let's go. Done.
- Let's go.

683
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:28,226
"Your shadow will follow me."

684
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:35,455
C'mon, let's take the bike.
- Start it quickly.

685
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:47,806
Oh no!

686
00:47:48,495 --> 00:47:50,725
Will you try to challenge us again?
- Hey!

687
00:47:50,941 --> 00:47:53,967
Hey stop!
- Brother, let's go.

688
00:47:54,047 --> 00:47:56,711
Hey! They've gone away.

689
00:47:56,914 --> 00:47:58,954
If you've the courage then get down.

690
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,468
If you're brave enough then come down.

691
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,550
They've left in the car.

692
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,536
Call Sidhu.

693
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:07,617
Call a car.

694
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:17,021
Hello Sidhu.

695
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:19,670
You've called at a wrong number.

696
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:22,116
I'm Dhusi Thapa.

697
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:25,116
He's saying he is not Sidhu.
It's a wrong number.

698
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:25,954
Some Dhushi Thapa is speaking.

699
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,129
Who is this Dhushi Thapa?
Give me the phone.

700
00:48:27,373 --> 00:48:28,373
Hello. Scoundrel.

701
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:29,359
Bye.

702
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,333
Hello..

703
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:35,752
He disconnected the call.

704
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:38,360
We'll handle everything.
- Let's go.

705
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,914
My beloved Kanchi.
- My love Sidhu.

706
00:48:42,265 --> 00:48:45,536
No. I'm not Sidhu.
I'm a different person now.

707
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:46,711
Pronounce the name from the other side.

708
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,292
It's not Sidhu it's Dhusi.

709
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:52,103
Dhusi.

710
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:56,049
I love you. You?

711
00:48:56,806 --> 00:49:00,455
Yeah. Total love. First time.

712
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,468
Love in Nepal.

713
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,752
"Kanchi, my Kanchi.."

714
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,446
Kanchi, you?

715
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:15,052
A little while ago you were with me.

716
00:49:15,484 --> 00:49:17,322
How did you reach here before me?

717
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:19,062
You've changed your dress also.

718
00:49:21,484 --> 00:49:22,641
My Kanchi.

719
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,247
Don't you've a mother
and sister at home?

720
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:26,641
How dare you flirt with me?

721
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:27,517
I'll teach you a lesson.

722
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:28,900
The slap was okay.
Why are you touching my feet?

723
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:33,863
Why are you running away?
Stop! I said stop. I'll kill you.

724
00:49:34,068 --> 00:49:35,225
Stop! Stop!

725
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,419
O god!

726
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:44,598
Nusu. Habul.

727
00:49:47,907 --> 00:49:49,248
O god!

728
00:50:12,037 --> 00:50:13,161
It's so cold.

729
00:50:13,723 --> 00:50:15,064
Where's the face wash?

730
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:17,367
Here it is.

731
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:23,129
"Kanchi, my kanchi.."

732
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:25,940
Why does it smell so weird?

733
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:29,896
Oh no! My eyes are burning.

734
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,345
Oh no!

735
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,967
He's watching television.

736
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:47,886
He brags all the time
but is busy watching women now.

737
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:51,777
Lecherous fellow.

738
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:54,469
I suggested that we kill the girls..

739
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:55,896
..and bury them in
Nepal but you won't do it.

740
00:50:57,172 --> 00:50:59,863
You're trying to get along with them.

741
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:05,474
Brother..
- Who's your brother?

742
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:08,155
We're gentlemen.

743
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:10,004
We are active on social media.

744
00:51:10,554 --> 00:51:11,495
Do you want me to kill?

745
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,252
After all they're two girls.
- Excuse me.

746
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:19,117
What do you mean that
they're just two girls?

747
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:26,901
They look good and the
application will also be good.

748
00:51:27,874 --> 00:51:28,696
Hey listen..

749
00:51:30,544 --> 00:51:31,625
Who is this?
Who's knocking?

750
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:33,809
Come in.

751
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:34,944
Come in.

752
00:51:45,216 --> 00:51:47,681
Do you've a bottle of poison?

753
00:51:57,475 --> 00:52:00,718
He wanted to have fun
so we taught him a lesson.

754
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:05,312
He was having a bath in
our bathroom in his underwear.

755
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:11,150
This guy was trying
to do the impossible.

756
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:13,550
We've recorded a MMS.

757
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:18,254
His lecherous activities.
It's great fun watch.

758
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,199
Bye.

759
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:22,285
Good night.

760
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:28,900
Shame! Shame!

761
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:31,214
What an insult!

762
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:32,284
Shame!

763
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:46,714
They molested me.

764
00:52:48,282 --> 00:52:52,022
Will you get my clothes from their room?

765
00:53:18,803 --> 00:53:20,230
Can't do it.

766
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,786
How long will this continue?

767
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,516
They saw me in my underwear.

768
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:36,738
Rascal!

769
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:37,873
I'm unable to execute it.

770
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,300
The girl said that she has a MMS.

771
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:40,457
What's in the MMS?

772
00:53:40,537 --> 00:53:41,786
That's not a big deal.

773
00:53:42,003 --> 00:53:44,911
The big deal is that
they saw me in my underwear.

774
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,186
Shame!

775
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:47,062
To hell with it.

776
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,927
Why didn't you tell them that
we're staying in the same hotel..

777
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:52,575
..and you suffer from
memory loss at times, rascal?

778
00:53:52,655 --> 00:53:53,721
What can I do?

779
00:53:53,991 --> 00:53:55,321
I forgot to tell them.

780
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:56,607
You're different from us.

781
00:53:56,813 --> 00:53:58,045
We can't have you in our team anymore.

782
00:53:58,413 --> 00:54:00,024
You're out of our team.
- Out.

783
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:03,959
You're not worthy to be with me.

784
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:07,732
You got slapped by two girls in Nepal.

785
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:08,651
Did I get slapped?

786
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:12,132
I've fallen in love in Nepal. Have you?

787
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:14,510
You're not worthy to be my friends.

788
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,607
You don't belong to my standard.

789
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:17,570
Sunny..

790
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,932
You can only boast.

791
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:20,467
I'll die.

792
00:54:24,684 --> 00:54:25,592
What are you doing?

793
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:28,230
Goodbye.

794
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:29,538
Bye.

795
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:33,235
"When my footprints will
no longer be on this bed.."

796
00:54:34,295 --> 00:54:35,452
Shut up!

797
00:54:36,295 --> 00:54:38,490
I can save you from committing
suicide on one condition.

798
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,998
You'll take us to the room
of those girls tomorrow morning.

799
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:43,831
Yes.

800
00:54:44,144 --> 00:54:45,507
Do you agree?

801
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:47,409
We'll kill them.

802
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:49,918
Done?

803
00:54:54,989 --> 00:54:55,908
Done.

804
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:01,529
Done.

805
00:55:43,118 --> 00:55:45,183
Hey! Where are you going?

806
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:48,101
Where are you going?

807
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:50,912
To watch sunrise.

808
00:55:50,992 --> 00:55:53,107
I'll set your sun forever.

809
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:53,788
Come with us.

810
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,788
Where shall we go?
- To murder them.

811
00:55:56,502 --> 00:55:57,939
Follow us quietly.

812
00:55:58,329 --> 00:55:59,529
Come.

813
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,285
Come on.

814
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:27,646
Gone.
- Let's go.

815
00:56:35,116 --> 00:56:37,030
Where's their room?

816
00:56:37,635 --> 00:56:45,289
"My liberation is
in the light of the sky."

817
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:52,662
"My liberation is
in the light of the sky."

818
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:58,003
Pallavi, come upstairs quickly.
- Coming.

819
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:05,960
Good morning, madam.

820
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,441
My Kanchi!

821
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,646
Don't you feel ashamed? Don't
you've a mother and sister at home?

822
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:24,445
Nusu, Kabul..

823
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,462
My two friends.

824
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:30,110
Who are you?
Who are you?

825
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,375
Here you are.

826
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:32,597
Finished?

827
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:34,078
We'll start our job now.

828
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:38,262
I need a ladder.
- Ladder? - Yes.

829
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,419
Don't make noise. Softly.

830
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:46,620
C'mon go.

831
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,306
I suffer from vertigo.

832
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:54,350
Shall I go?
- Keep quiet.

833
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:56,145
Stand here quietly.

834
00:57:56,566 --> 00:57:57,431
Hold this.

835
00:57:57,896 --> 00:57:59,431
I'll kill them with one blow.
- Okay.

836
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:02,199
Get up carefully.
- All the best, bro.

837
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:06,588
Tell us if you need any help.

838
00:58:11,463 --> 00:58:12,490
Wow!

839
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:18,512
Pablo.. Pablo.. get up.

840
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,885
Hey Pablo!

841
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:21,777
Please pass it to me, let me see.

842
00:58:23,301 --> 00:58:25,139
Gublu, why are you sleeping?

843
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:26,512
Shall I get a pillow for you?
- Shut up!

844
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:27,950
He has fallen down.
- Do you want juice?

845
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:31,475
He has fallen down..
he has fallen down and died.

846
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:33,875
Softly. He has fallen
down and lost consciousness.

847
00:58:33,955 --> 00:58:35,443
You're absolutely right.

848
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:36,708
What are you doing, rascal?

849
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:38,308
Let's pick him up
and take him to our room.

850
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,973
I can't do it. He's heavy.

851
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:42,773
Rai, the juice is spoiled.
- Throw it.

852
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,756
We'll buy a new one.

853
00:58:43,994 --> 00:58:45,746
I've emptied the bottle.

854
00:58:47,378 --> 00:58:48,665
He's peeing. It means he's alive.

855
00:58:48,745 --> 00:58:50,329
These girls are too much.

856
00:58:50,622 --> 00:58:52,135
Pouring water on us.

857
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:54,016
I'll kill them today. Let's go.

858
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,838
What shall we do?
- We'll take revenge.

859
00:58:57,173 --> 00:58:58,038
Revenge.

860
00:58:58,547 --> 00:59:00,990
Gublu, sleep here.
We'll be back.

861
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:03,886
Rascals! Trying to act smart.

862
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:05,562
I'll kill them today.

863
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:07,746
What's it?

864
00:59:09,735 --> 00:59:10,535
Apologize.

865
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:11,421
We won't forgive you.

866
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:14,437
Apologize or you'll be in trouble.

867
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:15,875
Who started all this?

868
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:17,864
Pass. I didn't start it.

869
00:59:18,102 --> 00:59:21,183
Who said that we're notorious?
- Pass. It was not me.

870
00:59:21,573 --> 00:59:23,000
Who peeped inside our room?

871
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,060
Fail.

872
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,038
We didn't want to peep inside.

873
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:27,714
We went to kill.
- Hey!

874
00:59:28,578 --> 00:59:29,486
Not me..

875
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:30,740
Call the police.

876
00:59:32,621 --> 00:59:35,951
Hey! Don't act smart.

877
00:59:36,503 --> 00:59:38,978
Or you'll be in great trouble.

878
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:42,167
You'll nether be able to live nor die.

879
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,605
Got it, dear?

880
00:59:46,135 --> 00:59:47,173
They're scared.

881
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:49,973
Hey you loafers.

882
00:59:51,606 --> 00:59:53,984
Open your ears and
listen to these numbers.

883
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:56,448
It'll make you feel good.

884
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:59,918
9830224506.

885
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:04,005
Aiyyo Swamy Chintapathy.
- Yes.

886
01:00:04,243 --> 01:00:08,826
We'll call him and
your plan will be ruined.

887
01:00:09,745 --> 01:00:11,734
Please don't do that.

888
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:15,757
I revealed it by mistake.
What can I do now?

889
01:00:15,837 --> 01:00:17,065
Forgive me.

890
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:19,519
I was scared when they
caught me in my underwear.

891
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:20,698
So, I told them.

892
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,320
When a gentleman clad
in underwear gets caught in..

893
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,028
..the girls' room, he has to give
something so that he's allowed to go.

894
01:00:35,347 --> 01:00:37,476
Underwear. Right?
- Hmm..

895
01:00:42,753 --> 01:00:44,590
Scoundrel Sidhu!

896
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,434
Rascal!

897
01:00:45,514 --> 01:00:46,840
Sunny will thrash me.

898
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,088
I'll never wear underwear again.

899
01:00:49,444 --> 01:00:51,444
I'll kill you.

900
01:00:52,266 --> 01:00:54,169
How dare you land us in trouble?

901
01:00:57,045 --> 01:00:58,839
Come out, scoundrel. Come out.

902
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:07,575
Hi!

903
01:01:18,646 --> 01:01:21,608
Sir, I'm Dhusi Thapa. Bathroom service.

904
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:23,836
The toilet is good right?
No complaints.

905
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:24,863
Happy holidays.

906
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,215
Sidhu?
- Dhusi Thapa.

907
01:01:38,171 --> 01:01:39,263
Dhusi Thapa?

908
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:42,377
Why is it so dark in the room?

909
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:47,252
Room service.

910
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:50,009
Sidhu.
- Sir, Sidhu is dead.

911
01:01:50,089 --> 01:01:51,739
Meenamma..
- Yes, sir.

912
01:01:51,819 --> 01:01:54,074
That's Sidhu Sikdar.
Confusion, sir.

913
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,080
Why?

914
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:56,799
He said he's Dhusi Thapa.

915
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,410
Dhusi Thapa. You mean a local man?
- Yes, sir.

916
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:03,383
Let's pray that he's
a local man or we came here..

917
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:06,290
..on the pretext of a conference.

918
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:07,469
You understand, sir. Right?

919
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:09,794
Yeah, I'm wearing one.
- Not underpants.

920
01:02:10,529 --> 01:02:14,637
We'll be in trouble if
everybody in office finds out.

921
01:02:14,717 --> 01:02:16,885
No.. no.. I won't go back.

922
01:02:17,188 --> 01:02:20,129
I must find out who Dhusi Thapa is.

923
01:02:20,712 --> 01:02:22,788
Meenamma, come.

924
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:24,669
Sir, dress.

925
01:02:26,745 --> 01:02:27,545
Sorry.

926
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,372
Look, he is coming.

927
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,084
Can I have coffee toffee?
- Sure.

928
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:45,835
Black?
- As you wish.

929
01:02:46,299 --> 01:02:48,667
In the office of
Aiyyo Swamy Chintapathy.

930
01:02:51,759 --> 01:02:57,683
Aiyoo.. it means you called
Aiyyo and brought him here.

931
01:03:03,824 --> 01:03:04,840
Please don't laugh.

932
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,603
Girls have motherly emotions.

933
01:03:07,132 --> 01:03:08,624
To forgive is in their..

934
01:03:10,138 --> 01:03:12,397
What?
- In heart.

935
01:03:13,575 --> 01:03:17,208
Whatever is happening
here is the plan of my friends.

936
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:22,364
Always remember that Sekhar Sadhuka..
that's me..

937
01:03:23,056 --> 01:03:24,559
..didn't come to Nepal.

938
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:29,975
It's not Sekhar Sadhuka.
It's Siddhartha Sikdar.

939
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,425
That's you.
- Thank you.

940
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:35,025
Look, friendship is not
based on terms and conditions.

941
01:03:35,987 --> 01:03:37,814
Since you mentioned friendship..

942
01:03:37,894 --> 01:03:39,230
..please consider my case.

943
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:43,415
I'll have nothing
to do if I lose my job.

944
01:03:44,939 --> 01:03:46,031
What will we get in return?

945
01:03:47,902 --> 01:03:50,485
Always at your service.
- Like?

946
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:55,177
Doing the household chores,
getting gas cylinders,

947
01:03:55,257 --> 01:03:56,312
Paying utility bills..

948
01:03:56,392 --> 01:03:57,447
Pokhra Lake.

949
01:04:01,112 --> 01:04:02,128
I'm scared of water.

950
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:03,491
That's not done.

951
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:06,161
You don't have to swim. Boating.

952
01:04:06,853 --> 01:04:08,864
Boating.

953
01:04:09,685 --> 01:04:11,058
You'll row the boat.

954
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,329
We'll have fun.

955
01:04:14,615 --> 01:04:16,226
Let's go.
- Boating?

956
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:19,243
No. It's shopping time.

957
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:23,913
Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

958
01:04:24,648 --> 01:04:25,448
Thank you.

959
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,875
Why do you've to do all this?

960
01:04:28,107 --> 01:04:29,816
Just a minute.

961
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,162
Then we're friends from today.

962
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:35,654
Siddhartha Sikdar hasn't come to Nepal.
- Yes.

963
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:40,141
Pablo Bose and Sunny Ghosh
are to be blamed for all problems.

964
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,000
Let's go.

965
01:04:47,102 --> 01:04:48,821
Cunning pig!

966
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:51,664
You think he's suffering
from short term memory loss?

967
01:04:51,744 --> 01:04:53,491
He gets confused all the time?

968
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,350
He's not Sidhu.. he can't be Sidhu.

969
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:58,486
He's a schemer.

970
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,134
Have they already called Aiyyo Swamy?

971
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,313
I don't know.

972
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:11,113
Pablo, how could he do this with us?

973
01:05:11,193 --> 01:05:12,487
He got high so many times and puked.

974
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:14,670
I cleaned his puke.
- Exactly.

975
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:16,919
And today he finished our career.

976
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,654
We'll be sacked.

977
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,661
Meenamma.

978
01:05:24,661 --> 01:05:26,964
Hello. Good mooring.
- Good morning, sir.

979
01:05:27,147 --> 01:05:28,207
Good morning, ma'am.

980
01:05:28,287 --> 01:05:30,899
Aiyyo Swamy Chintapathy.

981
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:32,207
Yes, sir.

982
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:38,303
May I know who's staying at Angel House?

983
01:05:38,383 --> 01:05:39,698
Give a moment, sir.

984
01:05:39,778 --> 01:05:40,779
I'll give him a call.

985
01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:42,097
I'll check.
- Check.

986
01:05:43,514 --> 01:05:47,276
Sister, who's staying at Angel House?

987
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:50,994
My boyfriend Dhusi Thapa and party.

988
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,443
Her boyfriend Dhusi Thapa
and party is staying in that room.

989
01:05:56,669 --> 01:05:59,112
Relieved! I'm so happy.

990
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:01,350
Oh! I'm sorry.

991
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,210
Thank you. Relieved.

992
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,372
Meenamma.

993
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:09,664
Happy holidays.
- Happy holidays.

994
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,097
What's the use of getting angry?

995
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,389
Just tell me what
you need and I'll get it.

996
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:16,529
Rai, this shop.
- Get in.

997
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:17,719
This is the best shop.

998
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,762
Get in quietly. Get in.

999
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:25,969

01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:27,363
All 65,000.

1001
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,504
Only?
- Yeah. 65,000.

1002
01:06:32,142 --> 01:06:33,277
He'll pay the bill.

1003
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:36,261
Thank you so much. Pack these.

1004
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:37,796
Bye.

1005
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:49,417
How much for all this?
- 10,000 rupees.

1006
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:51,947
Okay. He'll pay.
- Okay, ma'am.

1007
01:06:52,027 --> 01:06:53,493
Thank you so much.
- Let's go.

1008
01:06:56,877 --> 01:07:00,088
Please check if there's
any money left in the account.

1009
01:07:05,028 --> 01:07:06,033
Beautiful.

1010
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:08,239
Total how much?

1011
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,828
Nepali 10,000 rupees.

1012
01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:10,639
Only?

1013
01:07:11,017 --> 01:07:11,742
Yes, ma'am.

1014
01:07:11,822 --> 01:07:13,353
He'll pay the bill.

1015
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:14,390
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1016
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:18,142
Please check if there's
any money left in the account.

1017
01:07:18,531 --> 01:07:19,958
After all it's a matter of my job.

1018
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:23,114
Where will we go now?
- Now?

1019
01:07:28,952 --> 01:07:29,839
We'll go for shopping.

1020
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:32,260
What are you doing?
- I was going around with them.

1021
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,153
You're spending money after these girls?

1022
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:35,666
You're shopping for them?

1023
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:36,510
Don't kick me.

1024
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:41,778
I'll thrash you badly. Get lost.

1025
01:07:48,394 --> 01:07:50,880
Let me speak.
- Okay.

1026
01:07:51,248 --> 01:07:53,788
What did you tell the girls and why?
Give explanation.

1027
01:07:56,479 --> 01:08:00,036
They saw me in my underwear.
- Again?

1028
01:08:00,274 --> 01:08:02,306
They held me tightly.
- What?

1029
01:08:02,933 --> 01:08:04,749
The girls cornered me from both ends.

1030
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:08,014
They threatened that they
would get me fired from job..

1031
01:08:08,198 --> 01:08:10,706
..and made me wear their nightdress.

1032
01:08:12,576 --> 01:08:14,338
Why are you recording my video?

1033
01:08:23,148 --> 01:08:25,926
Look at the camera and confess
the truth or I'll thrash you badly.

1034
01:08:26,006 --> 01:08:26,780
Oh no!

1035
01:08:26,954 --> 01:08:28,013
You're going through chemo?

1036
01:08:28,511 --> 01:08:29,786
Have you got FNAC report?

1037
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,051
Yes, I've got everything.

1038
01:08:33,131 --> 01:08:34,489
I'll hit you hard if you lie.

1039
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:35,570
It's not a lie.

1040
01:08:36,013 --> 01:08:37,040
It's a lie.

1041
01:08:39,775 --> 01:08:40,878
Yes, it's a lie.

1042
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:43,970
Rai, take out the
number of Nepal police.

1043
01:08:44,857 --> 01:08:47,646
Oh no! Please don't call the police.

1044
01:08:47,726 --> 01:08:49,852
I beg of you. Please.

1045
01:08:50,436 --> 01:08:51,873
I'm speaking the truth.

1046
01:08:57,019 --> 01:08:58,814
We've lot of work pressure in office.

1047
01:09:02,814 --> 01:09:04,738
We're under lot of stress.
They don't sanction any leave.

1048
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:06,760
I can't see clearly without it.

1049
01:09:07,452 --> 01:09:09,268
They make us toil hard
for 17-18 hours every day.

1050
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:12,361
Therefore, my health was failing.

1051
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:15,874
I went to the doctor with my friends.

1052
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,371
The doctor suggested
that I was not well.

1053
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:21,842
He suggested that a vacation
would improve my health.

1054
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:24,134
But, my boss wouldn't have
sanctioned our leave if we said..

1055
01:09:24,214 --> 01:09:25,356
..we were going on vacation.

1056
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:28,815
Therefore my friends Nusu and Kabul..

1057
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,713
What happened?

1058
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,107
I'm speaking the truth. I swear on god.

1059
01:09:33,187 --> 01:09:35,313
Sunny and Pablo.
- Yes. Thank you.

1060
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:41,140
They got fake reports
and submitted it in the office.

1061
01:09:41,335 --> 01:09:43,897
They told boss that they
needed to take me out of station..

1062
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:44,805
..for treatment.

1063
01:09:44,885 --> 01:09:47,940
After all it was a serious disease.
'Lily Mashima Palestine'.

1064
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,210
Lympho-sarcoma of intestine.

1065
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:53,680
Thank you.

1066
01:09:53,853 --> 01:09:55,107
And we landed in Nepal.

1067
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:58,437
Please let me go.

1068
01:10:03,042 --> 01:10:04,026
Very good.

1069
01:10:04,902 --> 01:10:06,048
Give me your boss' number.

1070
01:10:08,252 --> 01:10:09,301
Aiyyo Swamy?

1071
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:13,366
I didn't have any other option.

1072
01:10:18,707 --> 01:10:20,913
Look whom we've brought with us.

1073
01:10:21,107 --> 01:10:22,167
He has ruined everything.

1074
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:24,211
Our reputation, prestige.. everything.

1075
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:27,000
We're ruined, Sunny. Lost everything.

1076
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:40,253
Pablo, he has said everything.

1077
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:43,657
What if our office finds out the truth?

1078
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:48,631
It won't reach.

1079
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:49,614
What do you mean?

1080
01:10:49,694 --> 01:10:52,339
The ones who are supposed to
give the information will get drowned.

1081
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:55,560
How?
- Didn't you hear what they said?

1082
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,782
They'll go to Pokhra
lake tomorrow for boating.

1083
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:04,620
C'mon, it's time to
prove your friendship.

1084
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,241
Aren't you going to
row the boat for the girls?

1085
01:11:07,246 --> 01:11:08,306
Listen to the plan.

1086
01:11:08,523 --> 01:11:10,663
Sunny and I'll be in a different boat.

1087
01:11:10,743 --> 01:11:12,328
We'll send you signals
when the time is right.

1088
01:11:12,408 --> 01:11:14,080
One. Two. Three.

1089
01:11:14,329 --> 01:11:16,556
Push the girls into the water.

1090
01:11:16,783 --> 01:11:19,907
Pokhra lake.
80 feet. They'll be buried in water.

1091
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:21,107
No. I can't do this.

1092
01:11:21,431 --> 01:11:22,782
I'll get married to Kanchi soon.

1093
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,009
Kids, marital home,
post-wedding rituals..

1094
01:11:26,306 --> 01:11:29,376
Listen.. aren't you Sidhu
Sikdar the first boy of our class?

1095
01:11:29,938 --> 01:11:31,419
Our friend, our pride.

1096
01:11:32,544 --> 01:11:37,009
How could you surrender
to the girls to save your job?

1097
01:11:37,089 --> 01:11:38,955
So that you can remain
in Aiyyo Swamy's good books?

1098
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,911
Shame on you.

1099
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:41,907
Aiyyo.. Aiyyo..

1100
01:11:41,987 --> 01:11:43,539
Thank you.

1101
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:45,302
I was trying to recall
this for long time.

1102
01:11:45,382 --> 01:11:46,102
I've just remembered it.

1103
01:11:46,182 --> 01:11:47,172
What happened?
Did they call him?

1104
01:11:47,464 --> 01:11:48,772
No, direct connection.

1105
01:11:49,745 --> 01:11:51,994
I saw Aiyyo pooping in the toilet.

1106
01:11:53,799 --> 01:11:55,518
What were you exactly doing?

1107
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:57,528
Were you standing with the hand shower..

1108
01:11:57,608 --> 01:11:58,555
..so that you could clean him?

1109
01:11:58,794 --> 01:12:01,377
Hey he should be..
I won't stay with him in the same room.

1110
01:12:01,457 --> 01:12:02,437
I'm going out.

1111
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,113
I quit.

1112
01:12:04,193 --> 01:12:06,210
Hey! Hey!

1113
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,161
He went away.

1114
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:10,610
Should he dance?

1115
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:12,469
No. That's not a big deal.

1116
01:12:12,549 --> 01:12:14,945
I want to say that
I saw Aiyyo with my eyes.

1117
01:12:15,356 --> 01:12:19,010
I think the girls
have called Aiyyo here.

1118
01:12:21,928 --> 01:12:25,734
Listen, we accept that you're
suffering from short term memory loss.

1119
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:29,701
But we can't believe in your day dreams.

1120
01:12:31,365 --> 01:12:33,722
Remember what Pablo said.

1121
01:12:33,971 --> 01:12:36,987
Think how you're going
to execute the plan at Pokhra.

1122
01:12:44,078 --> 01:12:44,791
Sir..

1123
01:12:45,818 --> 01:12:46,585
Hello.

1124
01:12:50,142 --> 01:12:51,094
Pablo Bose.

1125
01:12:59,385 --> 01:13:01,882
Good evening, sir. Good evening, madam.

1126
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:03,969
Room service.

1127
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,607
Sidhu room service?

1128
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,553
Pablo room service?

1129
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,801
What about my service?

1130
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:12,531
Your service, sir..

1131
01:13:13,071 --> 01:13:19,007
What's your name?
- My name is.. Nepal Bose, madam.

1132
01:13:22,336 --> 01:13:25,872
Do Nepalis have the surname 'Bose'?
- Yes.

1133
01:13:25,952 --> 01:13:29,569
I was born in a sitting
position so my name is Nepal Bose.

1134
01:13:29,649 --> 01:13:30,910
Who's inside?

1135
01:13:31,234 --> 01:13:32,737
No one, sir. No one, madam.

1136
01:13:33,277 --> 01:13:34,542
What about Dhusi Thapa?

1137
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:38,531
Right, madam.. the one inside..

1138
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:40,271
Well, I wanted to say..

1139
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:45,298
Sunny Ghosh.

1140
01:13:46,607 --> 01:13:47,872
Do something.

1141
01:13:49,688 --> 01:13:56,250
Sir, I'm Sudu Thapa. Thapa.
- Thapa.

1142
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:57,926
Room service.

1143
01:13:58,984 --> 01:14:02,411
Do I need waterproof underpants
while river rafting?

1144
01:14:04,218 --> 01:14:05,277
Throw it.

1145
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:16,304
Sir, I'm Dhusi Thapa.

1146
01:14:16,384 --> 01:14:18,326
How is this possible?

1147
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:21,742
I mean.. how can this happen?

1148
01:14:21,822 --> 01:14:27,137
Very easy, sir. We're twins.

1149
01:14:27,818 --> 01:14:29,072
Twins!

1150
01:14:30,564 --> 01:14:31,385
Twins?

1151
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:39,279
Oh! One twin. Two twins. Three twins

1152
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,593
But how?

1153
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:22,196
"There was a child who had a brother.."

1154
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:26,846
"..they would get along with
their dad better than their mother."

1155
01:15:26,926 --> 01:15:31,301
"The brother was elder
than the other one."

1156
01:15:31,381 --> 01:15:35,809
"The Almighty is wondering
what he'll grow up to be."

1157
01:15:35,889 --> 01:15:38,079
"The Almighty is wondering."

1158
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:46,651
"When the child grew up,
the Nepali father married a girl."

1159
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:49,505
"Married a girl."

1160
01:15:49,585 --> 01:15:51,440
"The girl was nice."

1161
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,732
"She already had a child."

1162
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:59,494
"She got a big family as wedding gift."

1163
01:16:16,695 --> 01:16:20,857
'"There were already two
and now they had one more."

1164
01:16:21,235 --> 01:16:25,170
"Three kids confused the parents."

1165
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,862
"Confused the parents."

1166
01:16:28,067 --> 01:16:32,283
"The family was big
and the kids were small."

1167
01:16:32,575 --> 01:16:36,705
"The family was big
and the kids were small."

1168
01:16:37,073 --> 01:16:41,322
"It was very hot in Nepal that year."

1169
01:16:41,593 --> 01:16:43,474
"It was very hot."

1170
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,954
"The kids went to take bath."

1171
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:59,245
"They were very small."

1172
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:04,142
"They caught cold and
their eyes got wrinkled."

1173
01:17:04,222 --> 01:17:08,716
"The three boys with
wrinkled eyes thought.."

1174
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:11,004
"..that somewhere
they might have twins.."

1175
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,669
"..named Sidhu, Sunny, Pablo."

1176
01:17:12,749 --> 01:17:15,372
"Sidhu, Sunny, Pablo."

1177
01:17:30,723 --> 01:17:31,869
It's an awesome place.

1178
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:34,442
What a wonderful view!

1179
01:17:34,637 --> 01:17:36,345
Look there.
- What's that?

1180
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:39,188
It's a fishtail. The tiny one. Up there.
- Wow!

1181
01:17:39,372 --> 01:17:40,377
Can you see it?

1182
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,453
Do you know what's beside it?

1183
01:17:44,377 --> 01:17:46,010
Wonderful!

1184
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:52,280
Finally we're in Pokhra.

1185
01:17:53,653 --> 01:17:55,307
Best place in Nepal.

1186
01:17:55,555 --> 01:17:57,145
Sidhu..
- Yes.

1187
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,809
..sing a song.
- Smile.

1188
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,139
Song?

1189
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:03,945
"Jana gana Mana.." (national anthem)

1190
01:18:04,025 --> 01:18:08,214
Hey! I'll slap you hard under
your ears and get you fired from job.

1191
01:18:08,441 --> 01:18:09,836
Sing an item song. An item song.

1192
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:14,063
"O boatman.."

1193
01:18:14,614 --> 01:18:15,933
Is this an item song?

1194
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:18,744
Isn't it?
- Item song.

1195
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:21,078
"Munni", "Shila's youth" and all.
- Yes.

1196
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:22,560
C'mon start.

1197
01:18:24,182 --> 01:18:27,025
"Sheila.. Sheila's youth."

1198
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:29,176
"I'm too sexy."

1199
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:34,235
We can't think of
these things in Kolkata.

1200
01:18:35,175 --> 01:18:36,462
We're enjoying here a lot.

1201
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,873
I can't bear this anymore.

1202
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,348
This place is awesome.
- Yes.

1203
01:18:43,943 --> 01:18:44,927
What happened?

1204
01:18:47,586 --> 01:18:48,797
Look there. Isn't it beautiful?

1205
01:18:50,353 --> 01:18:50,926
Throw them.

1206
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:52,277
Give me the camera. Let me click photos.

1207
01:18:52,634 --> 01:18:53,845
You're just too much.

1208
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:56,916
Oh my god!

1209
01:18:57,121 --> 01:18:59,326
Sunny! Hey Sunny!
Sunny!

1210
01:18:59,964 --> 01:19:01,434
What are you doing? Save your friend.

1211
01:19:01,661 --> 01:19:02,829
Get him out.
- Sunny!

1212
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:04,277
He'll get drowned.

1213
01:19:04,623 --> 01:19:05,348
I can't swim.

1214
01:19:05,943 --> 01:19:07,262
Help him.
- Do something.

1215
01:19:07,629 --> 01:19:08,786
Please help him.

1216
01:19:08,866 --> 01:19:10,527
Please do something.
- Please help.

1217
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:12,548
Please do something.

1218
01:19:12,904 --> 01:19:14,245
O my god! He'll get drowned.

1219
01:19:14,325 --> 01:19:15,586
Rai, you've to do this.
- Yes.

1220
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:17,067
Give it to me.

1221
01:19:18,526 --> 01:19:19,650
Be careful, Rai.

1222
01:19:20,136 --> 01:19:22,634
He's getting drowned.

1223
01:19:23,228 --> 01:19:24,180
Be careful, Rai.

1224
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,667
Help him.

1225
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:05,889
What happened, boss?

1226
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:08,375
Nothing has happened.
Everything is fine.

1227
01:20:08,455 --> 01:20:09,186
Absolutely fine.

1228
01:20:09,435 --> 01:20:10,537
C'mon give me your hand.

1229
01:20:10,808 --> 01:20:11,694
Give me your hand.

1230
01:20:14,137 --> 01:20:15,510
Get up, man.

1231
01:20:17,315 --> 01:20:18,256
Come with me.

1232
01:20:20,721 --> 01:20:22,613
We had a terrible experience today.

1233
01:20:24,754 --> 01:20:29,446
Kanchi.. anything wrong?

1234
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,089
Nothing. The doctor came for check-up.

1235
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,521
Is he alright?

1236
01:20:35,824 --> 01:20:37,705
Yes, nothing to worry.

1237
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,447
He has high temperature.

1238
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:41,036
He'll be fine.

1239
01:20:42,257 --> 01:20:43,673
Doctor, shall we go?
- Yes.

1240
01:20:45,912 --> 01:20:46,712
Let's go.

1241
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:50,290
The medicines..

1242
01:20:51,707 --> 01:20:52,669
Coming.

1243
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:05,826
Hi, guys.

1244
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:07,847
Hi!

1245
01:21:09,426 --> 01:21:10,226
Hi!

1246
01:21:14,421 --> 01:21:19,459
What happened? Fever?
- No. I've headache.

1247
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,620
Actually the water was very cold.

1248
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:24,399
Please be seated.
- Thank you.

1249
01:21:30,064 --> 01:21:31,307
I'm changing my room.

1250
01:21:31,751 --> 01:21:34,529
If you've anything except your
charger in my bag you can take it later.

1251
01:21:36,215 --> 01:21:37,556
I'll cancel the flight tickets.

1252
01:21:38,086 --> 01:21:39,242
I'll get a ticket online.

1253
01:21:39,955 --> 01:21:41,112
I won't go back with both of you.

1254
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,804
Stop!

1255
01:21:47,426 --> 01:21:51,210
If you step outside I'll go in from
the right and take it out from the left.

1256
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:55,566
Hey! I hope he won't murder him.
- I'm not sure.

1257
01:21:56,398 --> 01:21:57,522
I'll explain everything.

1258
01:21:58,603 --> 01:22:01,554
Pablo's bike and
Sunny's dad's Ford car..

1259
01:22:01,634 --> 01:22:02,787
..is parked in the same garage.

1260
01:22:03,013 --> 01:22:05,575
If Sunny takes his car
out from the right side..

1261
01:22:06,105 --> 01:22:08,927
..then the silencer of
Pablo's bike will fall out.

1262
01:22:09,435 --> 01:22:10,840
The repair will cost
him around 6000 bucks.

1263
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,094
It has happened few times.

1264
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:13,640
So, he's threatening him.

1265
01:22:14,884 --> 01:22:16,300
Why are you so angry?

1266
01:22:18,484 --> 01:22:20,527
If we've made any mistake
then we're sorry for it.

1267
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:29,748
They've apologized.

1268
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:33,251
I accept that all of you are very nice,
I'm the only one who's bad.

1269
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:37,186
Move.
- Where are you going?

1270
01:22:37,824 --> 01:22:39,143
What are you doing?

1271
01:22:45,705 --> 01:22:47,889
That's called being stubborn.

1272
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:54,137
Smile.

1273
01:22:55,413 --> 01:22:56,299
Smile.

1274
01:22:58,137 --> 01:23:01,121
He's your friend. Go and call him.

1275
01:23:01,976 --> 01:23:03,587
He won't come even if
we call him several times now.

1276
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,046
He's a weird fellow.

1277
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:23,057
I eat so much on vacation
that I've put on weight.

1278
01:23:24,635 --> 01:23:26,527
Put on the room heater.
- Yes.

1279
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:30,192
I'm freezing.

1280
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:38,602
Sunny is crazy.

1281
01:23:39,066 --> 01:23:41,153
He wants to go to the
base camp of Annapurna with me.

1282
01:23:41,931 --> 01:23:45,379
Go ahead.
- Ignore him. He's crazy.

1283
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:49,542
The tip of my nose always gets cold.

1284
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,110
Do we get caps for nose?

1285
01:23:52,536 --> 01:23:54,514
Okay. I'll get one if I find it.

1286
01:23:55,044 --> 01:23:57,141
Get inside the blanket and go to sleep.

1287
01:23:57,221 --> 01:23:58,893
You won't feel cold.

1288
01:24:03,692 --> 01:24:05,011
I'm inside the blanket.

1289
01:24:05,091 --> 01:24:06,081
Now I'm not feeling cold.

1290
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:14,167
What's wrong with you? Mood off?

1291
01:24:14,859 --> 01:24:17,562
No. Nothing is wrong. Tell me.

1292
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:23,000
Sunny is actually a good guy.

1293
01:24:23,551 --> 01:24:25,313
He's not as bad as I thought him to be.

1294
01:24:25,659 --> 01:24:26,740
Let's see..

1295
01:24:28,837 --> 01:24:31,172
I thought that..

1296
01:24:35,798 --> 01:24:38,879
You're in this condition
because of our stubbornness.

1297
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:43,293
I don't understand your problem .

1298
01:24:47,411 --> 01:24:48,849
I've problem.

1299
01:24:51,196 --> 01:24:52,288
You've always been stubborn.

1300
01:24:55,347 --> 01:24:56,277
This is the last time I'm asking you.

1301
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:57,542
Will you come inside?
- No.

1302
01:24:57,823 --> 01:24:59,142
The girls have apologized.

1303
01:24:59,222 --> 01:25:00,472
Why are you speaking on their behalf?

1304
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:02,061
Go and sleep.

1305
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,835
You're just too much.
I'll actually leave now.

1306
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:08,375
What can you do? Go to sleep.

1307
01:25:08,455 --> 01:25:10,851
You're very stubborn. Give me cigarette.

1308
01:25:12,082 --> 01:25:13,044
Why are you taking my cigarette?

1309
01:25:13,124 --> 01:25:14,212
It's okay.

1310
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:15,098
How dare you take away my cigarette?

1311
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:16,309
Wait, I'll send him.

1312
01:25:36,513 --> 01:25:37,594
Hi, Gublu..

1313
01:25:39,346 --> 01:25:40,319
What do you want?

1314
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,746
Go away from here.

1315
01:25:46,827 --> 01:25:49,119
What are they doing?
- Quarrelling.

1316
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,995
They were so close
and now they're fighting.

1317
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:54,536
Friendship. Just like us.

1318
01:25:57,822 --> 01:25:59,108
But we never fight.

1319
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:00,427
What's his problem?

1320
01:26:00,507 --> 01:26:01,141
You know me.

1321
01:26:01,221 --> 01:26:03,995
I'll hit you.
- He's very strict.

1322
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,281
Hm.. he has a sad past.

1323
01:26:11,941 --> 01:26:14,643
I mean.. he's still living in his past.

1324
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:17,184
Aren't you feeling cold?

1325
01:26:17,508 --> 01:26:19,627
I'm going to bed. Bye.

1326
01:26:21,022 --> 01:26:22,438
You've come again.
- Oh no!

1327
01:26:22,518 --> 01:26:24,741
Get lost from here.

1328
01:26:25,356 --> 01:26:26,005
He's my friend.

1329
01:26:26,085 --> 01:26:27,692
Do you think you've
done the right thing?

1330
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:29,887
Have you done the right thing?

1331
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,930
Come with me.
- I told you I won't go. Get in.

1332
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:35,162
I'll call Sunny.

1333
01:26:35,242 --> 01:26:38,578
Sunny, Gublu doesn't
want to go in. Come.

1334
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,271
Good morning.

1335
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,103
Take this.

1336
01:27:42,665 --> 01:27:44,243
You spent the entire night
outside in the chilling weather.

1337
01:27:44,935 --> 01:27:45,843
Are you mad?

1338
01:27:49,194 --> 01:27:52,048
Darjeeling tea in Nepal.
You'll feel refreshed.

1339
01:27:57,993 --> 01:27:59,323
You smoked so many cigarettes.

1340
01:28:01,064 --> 01:28:02,372
You'll fall sick.

1341
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:04,869
And smoking is injurious to health.

1342
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:10,620
Your vacation with
your friends will be..

1343
01:28:17,647 --> 01:28:21,766
Hey Kabul, please don't go.

1344
01:28:21,846 --> 01:28:23,604
Please don't go.
- Why?

1345
01:28:23,684 --> 01:28:24,220
Why shouldn't I go?

1346
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:24,869
Forget what has happened.

1347
01:28:24,949 --> 01:28:28,112
Hey Sidhu, let him do what he wants to.

1348
01:28:28,192 --> 01:28:30,014
I know him very well.

1349
01:28:30,274 --> 01:28:31,528
I know how far he can go.

1350
01:28:31,722 --> 01:28:32,782
He can't go too far.

1351
01:28:32,998 --> 01:28:33,776
He'll soon be back.

1352
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:34,890
Oh! Really?

1353
01:28:35,138 --> 01:28:36,003
So, he thinks so.

1354
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,063
Can't I live without you?

1355
01:28:37,269 --> 01:28:39,831
Okay. Just wait and watch.
- Go.

1356
01:28:43,755 --> 01:28:46,360
Sunny… Aiyyo..
please handle the situation.

1357
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,949
What did he say?

1358
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:49,030
What Aiyyo?

1359
01:28:49,614 --> 01:28:50,674
Why are you covering your face?

1360
01:28:50,911 --> 01:28:51,560
Run!

1361
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,360
What happened?

1362
01:28:52,706 --> 01:28:53,776
Aiyyo..

1363
01:28:55,171 --> 01:28:56,219
Come on.

1364
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,884
Something is fishy about these three.

1365
01:29:04,489 --> 01:29:05,765
They speak in Bengali.

1366
01:29:06,295 --> 01:29:09,667
They change the moment they see me.

1367
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,175
Meenamma..
- Yes, sir.

1368
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:14,099
Reception.
- Yes, sir.

1369
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,295
Hello.

1370
01:29:25,895 --> 01:29:27,322
Hello, sir.
- Oh!

1371
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:37,279
Show me the register
book which guests sign.

1372
01:29:37,463 --> 01:29:38,501
Just a minute, sir.

1373
01:29:40,014 --> 01:29:44,393
I want to check if your
twins are in this hotel or not.

1374
01:29:45,106 --> 01:29:46,663
Sir, take a look.

1375
01:29:56,468 --> 01:29:57,787
Dhusi Thapa.
Nusa Thapa

1376
01:29:57,867 --> 01:29:59,052
Dhusi Thapa.
Nusa Thapa

1377
01:29:59,322 --> 01:30:00,771
Nepal Bose.
Nusa Thapa.

1378
01:30:00,851 --> 01:30:01,831
Dhusi Thapa.

1379
01:30:04,133 --> 01:30:06,187
Do the waiters also sign here?

1380
01:30:06,803 --> 01:30:10,003
Sir, signing is a mission,
a national fashion.

1381
01:30:10,284 --> 01:30:11,041
Okay.

1382
01:30:12,879 --> 01:30:13,777
Okay.

1383
01:30:14,652 --> 01:30:16,977
Meenamma..
- Yes, sir.

1384
01:30:17,057 --> 01:30:19,614
Room..
- Yes, sir.

1385
01:30:19,862 --> 01:30:21,387
Room..
- Yes, sir.

1386
01:30:28,403 --> 01:30:29,278
Sorry.

1387
01:30:29,668 --> 01:30:30,435
Thank god.

1388
01:30:47,711 --> 01:30:49,376
Sidhu, let's go.

1389
01:30:51,247 --> 01:30:52,284
Excuse me.

1390
01:30:53,452 --> 01:30:57,798
Can you tell me the name
of the person who just left?

1391
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,159
Name..

1392
01:31:02,943 --> 01:31:04,911
Ulanga Swamy.
- What?

1393
01:31:05,883 --> 01:31:09,656
Who is the girl who went with him?

1394
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,321
Sejo Masi (auntie).

1395
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:15,928
Sejo masi?

1396
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:24,339
Brother, Ulanga Swamy
now belongs to the girl.

1397
01:31:24,533 --> 01:31:28,436
My life is completely ruined.

1398
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:32,739
Don't cry, sister.
Let me see what I can do.

1399
01:31:33,972 --> 01:31:35,128
Look there.

1400
01:31:40,458 --> 01:31:43,658
Aiyyo Swamy, I won't spare you.

1401
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,809
You've cheated on Kanupriya.

1402
01:31:46,307 --> 01:31:49,637
I'll thrash you badly
and teach you a good lesson.

1403
01:31:51,064 --> 01:31:53,291
Let's go, brother.
- Yes, sister. Let's follow them.

1404
01:31:55,745 --> 01:31:56,556
Excuse me.

1405
01:32:00,318 --> 01:32:01,302
Look at this.

1406
01:32:03,702 --> 01:32:04,686
What are you doing?

1407
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:19,400
Let's be friends.

1408
01:32:23,465 --> 01:32:26,741
'We're flying across the
scared and majestic Himalayas.'

1409
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,502
There are many tourist spots here.

1410
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:34,124
Excuse me, ma'am.

1411
01:32:34,204 --> 01:32:35,757
Would you mind to
change the seat please?

1412
01:32:35,837 --> 01:32:37,508
Of course.
- Thank you.

1413
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:39,270
Let me see.

1414
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:40,146
Let me see.

1415
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:48,146
Hey..

1416
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:57,832
So nice.

1417
01:32:58,513 --> 01:33:01,216
Excuse me.
- Yes, please.

1418
01:33:02,069 --> 01:33:05,713
Can I see the list of
passengers travelling with us?

1419
01:33:06,005 --> 01:33:07,291
Of course.

1420
01:33:07,713 --> 01:33:09,183
Thank you.

1421
01:33:09,263 --> 01:33:10,491
Your first time?

1422
01:33:14,307 --> 01:33:16,048
You know about Nepali khukri (dagger)?

1423
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:19,161
Leave me.

1424
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:30,308
I'm so lucky.

1425
01:33:32,104 --> 01:33:33,660
She's so beautiful.

1426
01:33:34,245 --> 01:33:35,996
Why is everything so hazy?

1427
01:33:36,353 --> 01:33:38,861
Give my glasses. Let me see.

1428
01:33:42,418 --> 01:33:43,143
Sir..

1429
01:33:45,748 --> 01:33:47,640
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.

1430
01:33:53,574 --> 01:33:56,006
Can I have today's
passenger list please?

1431
01:33:56,601 --> 01:33:58,060
Of course, ma'am.

1432
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:00,493
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1433
01:34:02,113 --> 01:34:05,616
I fail to understand why
Pablo suddenly lost his temper.

1434
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,486
Is it because of his erectile dysfunction?
- Shut up.

1435
01:34:08,589 --> 01:34:11,800
They're getting close.

1436
01:34:12,287 --> 01:34:13,865
Let's go.

1437
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,199
These things happens
more in winters. Right?

1438
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,669
I think they don't have room heater.

1439
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,117
Brother..

1440
01:34:27,744 --> 01:34:28,868
Why are you making me run?

1441
01:34:28,948 --> 01:34:30,187
Aiyyo Swamy is following us.

1442
01:34:30,468 --> 01:34:31,636
Come with me.

1443
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:39,928
Spare me.
- Come on.

1444
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,322
Come. Come on.

1445
01:34:50,024 --> 01:34:52,262
This way. Come.

1446
01:34:55,808 --> 01:34:57,095
Hurry up, sister.

1447
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,944
Who are you trying to run from?

1448
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,247
Aiyyo. Come on.

1449
01:35:05,293 --> 01:35:06,039
This way.

1450
01:35:07,974 --> 01:35:12,373
Don't spare him now. Don't spare him.

1451
01:35:12,676 --> 01:35:14,200
I won't spare him today, sister.
Come with me.

1452
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:17,119
Come.
- Not here. Come on.

1453
01:35:20,536 --> 01:35:24,729
I can't run anymore.
- Come on.

1454
01:35:25,216 --> 01:35:27,562
Come on.

1455
01:35:39,671 --> 01:35:41,736
Meenamma..
- Yes, sir.

1456
01:35:42,459 --> 01:35:46,026
Come behind the bush.
- Okay, sir.

1457
01:35:46,339 --> 01:35:49,420
Not now. Just watch.

1458
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,042
Come.
- Okay, sir.

1459
01:35:52,588 --> 01:35:54,123
Sister, where did they go?

1460
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:58,339
Brother, I'm tired.
Let's go to our room.

1461
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:00,360
Sister, just wait and watch what I do.

1462
01:36:01,896 --> 01:36:04,945
Brother, don't spare him.

1463
01:36:05,365 --> 01:36:06,663
Pablo Bose.

1464
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,894
Yes.

1465
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:15,322
Yes, tell me.

1466
01:36:16,413 --> 01:36:17,451
Hello.

1467
01:36:19,267 --> 01:36:20,229
Game over.

1468
01:36:21,592 --> 01:36:23,613
You lied to me and came to Nepal.

1469
01:36:23,948 --> 01:36:27,440
Now you'll get fired.
- No, sir.

1470
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:31,052
Please try to understand, sir.
- No.. no..

1471
01:36:31,624 --> 01:36:34,803
You thought you were smarter than me.
How could you think so?

1472
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:37,560
You're fired.
- Hey!

1473
01:36:37,744 --> 01:36:39,073
Sir! Sir!

1474
01:36:39,153 --> 01:36:40,587
Rinku ji..
- We'll talk later.

1475
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:42,684
Sir.. you?

1476
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:45,257
What's the matter?

1477
01:36:45,571 --> 01:36:46,630
Who is this boy?

1478
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:48,015
Boy? Thank you.

1479
01:36:48,534 --> 01:36:50,177
I'm Aiyyo Swamy Chintapathy.

1480
01:36:50,447 --> 01:36:51,929
Hello.
- Hello.

1481
01:36:52,009 --> 01:36:53,399
And she's Meenaskshi.

1482
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:57,107
I'm his boss in the office.

1483
01:36:57,788 --> 01:37:00,524
Office? You've joined office?

1484
01:37:00,966 --> 01:37:02,004
You've shut down your business?

1485
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,264
Business?
- Yes.

1486
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:07,766
We run an export import business.

1487
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:10,879
We've come to Nepal for our honeymoon.

1488
01:37:11,949 --> 01:37:14,511
Happy Singh. Sukhi Singh. From Ludhiana.

1489
01:37:15,213 --> 01:37:17,451
How are you doing, my son?

1490
01:37:20,143 --> 01:37:22,197
Hope you're enjoying.

1491
01:37:23,386 --> 01:37:24,327
She's my wife.

1492
01:37:26,435 --> 01:37:28,597
Is she your wife?
- Sorry.

1493
01:37:29,732 --> 01:37:32,186
My bad luck.

1494
01:37:35,721 --> 01:37:39,592
Listen, I can't stay
alone anymore. Come.

1495
01:37:41,429 --> 01:37:42,348
Come on.

1496
01:37:43,753 --> 01:37:44,953
Sir..
- Not now.

1497
01:37:46,023 --> 01:37:49,417
I've seen twins but triplets?

1498
01:37:51,147 --> 01:37:53,991
Meenamma..
- Yes, sir.

1499
01:37:56,109 --> 01:37:57,450
Okay, sir.

1500
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,466
Come.

1501
01:38:21,557 --> 01:38:26,346
"Look what love has done to me.."

1502
01:38:27,232 --> 01:38:28,832
"My heart gives out a sigh.."

1503
01:38:29,416 --> 01:38:32,432
"Please tell me what's
going to happen.."

1504
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:39,925
"Look what love..
- "..has done to me.."

1505
01:38:46,217 --> 01:38:52,780
"Look what love..
- "..has done to me.."

1506
01:39:03,785 --> 01:39:04,682
What happened?

1507
01:39:04,909 --> 01:39:06,185
What are you doing?

1508
01:39:07,234 --> 01:39:08,509
Strange!

1509
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:10,380
Okay. Fine.

1510
01:39:18,379 --> 01:39:21,428
Rinku ji..
- Yes, tell me.

1511
01:39:21,871 --> 01:39:24,541
..I can't stay alone anymore.

1512
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:26,832
Will you kiss me?

1513
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,377
There's a limit to control the feelings?

1514
01:39:33,372 --> 01:39:40,161
I don't kiss I only have antacids.

1515
01:39:40,241 --> 01:39:41,286
Enough!

1516
01:39:44,773 --> 01:39:45,800
What do you think?

1517
01:39:46,059 --> 01:39:47,259
I'm not like both of you.

1518
01:39:47,551 --> 01:39:48,924
I'll definitely kill them.

1519
01:39:49,281 --> 01:39:50,178
You won't.

1520
01:39:50,258 --> 01:39:51,303
What did you say?

1521
01:39:53,767 --> 01:39:55,129
Tell something.
- What?

1522
01:39:56,589 --> 01:39:58,729
Say, my darling..
- My darling..

1523
01:39:58,809 --> 01:40:02,059
My darling..
- My darling.. I've said it what next.

1524
01:40:02,318 --> 01:40:05,237
My darling, I love you.
- My darling, I love you.

1525
01:40:06,124 --> 01:40:07,151
Let's go.
- What did I say?

1526
01:40:07,231 --> 01:40:09,378
Hey! What has happened?

1527
01:40:09,691 --> 01:40:11,454
You've confessed your love.
- What?

1528
01:40:11,681 --> 01:40:13,994
It's clearly visible
that you're in love.

1529
01:40:14,286 --> 01:40:16,048
Now, you've confessed it.

1530
01:40:16,221 --> 01:40:17,270
Hold on.

1531
01:40:17,735 --> 01:40:19,248
I didn't say anything.

1532
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,794
You deceived me into saying..
- Yes.

1533
01:40:20,978 --> 01:40:22,729
You didn't say anything but you will.

1534
01:40:23,151 --> 01:40:23,778
Yes, you will.

1535
01:40:23,858 --> 01:40:27,756
You'll be bowled out in love tomorrow.
Challenge.

1536
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:31,876
This is..
- He's absolutely right.

1537
01:40:32,535 --> 01:40:33,984
"Love has.."

1538
01:40:37,767 --> 01:40:38,599
Why did you go to sleep?

1539
01:40:40,069 --> 01:40:41,475
I'll kill those girls.

1540
01:40:42,285 --> 01:40:43,929
I'll also kill both of you.

1541
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:48,329
Don't challenge me, scoundrels.

1542
01:40:49,172 --> 01:40:50,437
I'll ruin everything.

1543
01:40:53,345 --> 01:40:54,372
I'm in love?

1544
01:40:57,832 --> 01:40:59,162
There's going to
be catastrophe tomorrow.

1545
01:41:23,096 --> 01:41:26,004
What's this? Why are you crying?

1546
01:41:28,847 --> 01:41:32,338
I'm seeing the Himalayas
for the last time. That's why.

1547
01:41:34,263 --> 01:41:35,204
What do you mean?

1548
01:41:37,766 --> 01:41:39,484
Lymph sarcoma of intestine.

1549
01:41:48,241 --> 01:41:49,679
My disease is for real.

1550
01:41:51,236 --> 01:41:53,063
I've to take three
chemo after I go back.

1551
01:41:54,122 --> 01:41:57,052
If I come back..
if I'm able to survive..

1552
01:42:01,453 --> 01:42:03,280
Won't you push me?

1553
01:42:36,782 --> 01:42:40,588
"My heart.."

1554
01:42:43,495 --> 01:42:48,457
"..I've drenched my feet
in the little water available."

1555
01:42:49,355 --> 01:42:53,160
"My heart.."

1556
01:42:56,176 --> 01:43:00,425
"..I've enjoyed the
light of the setting sun."

1557
01:43:01,993 --> 01:43:05,074
"My heart.."

1558
01:43:05,581 --> 01:43:11,495
"..the river looks for the rocky path."

1559
01:43:11,895 --> 01:43:17,701
"I want to brighten your
path with the glow of fireflies."

1560
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:21,527
"My heart.."

1561
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:29,635
"..I've drenched my feet
in the little water available."

1562
01:43:43,742 --> 01:43:51,267
"I try to avoid loneliness
as I slowly proceed in relations."

1563
01:43:53,222 --> 01:44:00,812
"I touch the hot cup
lightly to enjoy its warmth."

1564
01:44:01,904 --> 01:44:10,780
"It comes to halt like
an injured kite in the open sky."

1565
01:44:11,266 --> 01:44:20,326
"It comes to halt like the
unheard song on the silent lips."

1566
01:44:20,866 --> 01:44:24,823
"My heart.."

1567
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:32,617
"..I've drenched my feet
in the little water available."

1568
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:37,459
"My heart.."

1569
01:44:40,314 --> 01:44:45,266
"..I've enjoyed the
light of the setting sun."

1570
01:45:12,196 --> 01:45:20,099
"I can see my eyes staring
at the distant places."

1571
01:45:21,677 --> 01:45:29,267
"I keep the small dreams
alive in my heart."

1572
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:39,299
"I fly across the sky
on the wings of unknown birds."

1573
01:45:39,742 --> 01:45:48,705
"I fly across like
the white sleepy feathers."

1574
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:53,246
"My heart.."

1575
01:45:56,144 --> 01:46:01,582
"..I've drenched my feet
in the little water available."

1576
01:46:02,036 --> 01:46:05,873
"My heart.."

1577
01:46:08,749 --> 01:46:13,149
"..I've enjoyed the
light of the setting sun."

1578
01:46:14,662 --> 01:46:17,668
"My heart.."

1579
01:46:18,641 --> 01:46:24,111
"..the river looks for its rocky path."

1580
01:46:24,479 --> 01:46:30,316
"I want to brighten your path
with the glow of the fireflies."

1581
01:46:30,396 --> 01:46:34,241
"My heart.."

1582
01:46:44,814 --> 01:46:46,004
Is it burning?

1583
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:54,847
I didn't know that you had..

1584
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:01,117
Or I wouldn't have..
- Sugar?

1585
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:05,215
You would've pushed
me down if I was not sick.

1586
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:06,598
No.. please..

1587
01:47:10,621 --> 01:47:16,308
We've fought and quarreled so
badly for the last few days.. oh no..

1588
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,481
I lost my temper.

1589
01:47:20,416 --> 01:47:21,540
Sorry.

1590
01:47:26,806 --> 01:47:29,498
Her name was Rehana. Economics.

1591
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:31,119
A year junior to me.

1592
01:47:32,092 --> 01:47:35,854
She could sing very well. And we..

1593
01:47:49,962 --> 01:47:53,649
My dad always said that
if one window shuts down..

1594
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:55,626
..We must try to open another one.

1595
01:47:56,989 --> 01:47:58,362
Maybe.

1596
01:48:00,555 --> 01:48:02,469
But my confidence has been shattered.

1597
01:48:06,772 --> 01:48:07,940
Sit down.

1598
01:48:09,064 --> 01:48:11,010
Life has given me
only three months to live.

1599
01:48:12,988 --> 01:48:14,275
So, I've set out.

1600
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:16,999
I didn't lose confidence.

1601
01:48:22,794 --> 01:48:24,199
It's a celebration, Pablo.

1602
01:48:25,324 --> 01:48:27,183
To get rid of attachments one by one.

1603
01:48:28,643 --> 01:48:33,086
I'm standing at a point of no return.

1604
01:48:34,059 --> 01:48:35,346
I don't care for anything now.

1605
01:48:35,746 --> 01:48:37,584
I live every moment.

1606
01:48:38,329 --> 01:48:40,632
I enjoy, have fun, fight, quarrel..

1607
01:48:44,438 --> 01:48:45,844
Don't I look beautiful?

1608
01:48:47,249 --> 01:48:50,157
I feel very happy when
people say that I'm beautiful.

1609
01:48:51,098 --> 01:48:52,320
That's why I love to dress up.

1610
01:48:56,688 --> 01:49:00,169
You're naturally very beautiful.
- I know.

1611
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,018
There are different kinds
of treatments available now.

1612
01:49:11,099 --> 01:49:12,364
We'll go to Mumbai and..

1613
01:49:12,613 --> 01:49:16,699
Why? Some people live
till 30 years and some till 83.

1614
01:49:17,856 --> 01:49:19,899
Life should be lived well. Isn't it?

1615
01:49:25,207 --> 01:49:27,996
But, you must promise me something.

1616
01:49:30,851 --> 01:49:32,245
Stay well.

1617
01:49:35,586 --> 01:49:36,472
Promise?

1618
01:49:41,607 --> 01:49:45,575
With you.
- What?

1619
01:49:48,570 --> 01:49:50,202
I can't be happy without you.

1620
01:49:54,385 --> 01:49:56,104
I've only three months, Pablo.

1621
01:50:02,147 --> 01:50:03,553
Life should be lived well.

1622
01:50:06,537 --> 01:50:11,045
Some live till 3 some till 83.

1623
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:20,504
Can't I be a part of
such a big celebration?

1624
01:50:23,445 --> 01:50:26,169
Help me get back my
lost confidence, Pallavi.

1625
01:50:41,715 --> 01:50:45,066
This is my farewell gift. Isn't it, god?

1626
01:51:06,527 --> 01:51:09,640
I told you.. this is Pablo..

1627
01:51:11,327 --> 01:51:13,294
He may look huge from outside..

1628
01:51:14,645 --> 01:51:16,504
..but he's a small kid from inside.

1629
01:51:18,764 --> 01:51:19,575
Scoundrel!

1630
01:51:20,504 --> 01:51:22,158
It's going to hurt me.

1631
01:51:24,904 --> 01:51:27,228
Proud of you, Pablo. Proud of you.

1632
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:32,493
Hey!
- What happened?

1633
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:38,007
Will I be able to reach
the reception through this way?

1634
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:43,067
Scoundrel!
I'll kick you hard on your back.

1635
01:51:43,272 --> 01:51:44,256
Why?
- Come here.

1636
01:51:45,531 --> 01:51:49,542
Sunny, what are you doing in the dark?

1637
01:51:50,081 --> 01:51:54,038
Hold on. First you tell me what are
you doing with the candle near the door.

1638
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,530
Come here.

1639
01:51:57,833 --> 01:51:58,774
Hold on.

1640
01:52:04,244 --> 01:52:05,476
My Kanchi.

1641
01:52:09,173 --> 01:52:12,190
We were romancing and
then there was this power cut.

1642
01:52:12,838 --> 01:52:15,411
So, I got the candles
and started searching.

1643
01:52:16,816 --> 01:52:17,951
Come.

1644
01:52:24,167 --> 01:52:25,172
Kanchi sister-in-law..

1645
01:52:26,404 --> 01:52:29,994
Please take her aside.
- Come.

1646
01:52:31,053 --> 01:52:34,350
You come with us.
- I'm always with you.

1647
01:52:35,452 --> 01:52:40,576
What was going on in the dark?
- I can't say.

1648
01:52:41,657 --> 01:52:42,641
Sunny.

1649
01:52:44,013 --> 01:52:46,478
Happy birthday to..

1650
01:52:47,992 --> 01:52:49,311
Quiet. Don't shout.

1651
01:52:49,711 --> 01:52:51,916
Don't ruin my life.

1652
01:52:55,819 --> 01:52:58,781
Wow! Beautiful!

1653
01:52:59,549 --> 01:53:01,798
Pallavi, my best friend.

1654
01:53:05,885 --> 01:53:08,674
Do you know that my
visa and passport is ready.

1655
01:53:10,015 --> 01:53:12,058
I'm going abroad after a week.

1656
01:53:12,772 --> 01:53:14,685
Suddenly I saw Pallavi on social media.

1657
01:53:15,183 --> 01:53:17,053
She had uploaded pictures
in which she was taking chemo.

1658
01:53:17,133 --> 01:53:20,826
The lipstick is a bit..
- I love to dress up.

1659
01:53:21,507 --> 01:53:22,837
After few days..

1660
01:53:24,426 --> 01:53:26,491
She visits the doctor alone.

1661
01:53:26,707 --> 01:53:29,323
Lies unconscious and
then gets up to fight again.

1662
01:53:29,528 --> 01:53:30,577
A selfie.

1663
01:53:32,999 --> 01:53:34,977
But, she never stops clicking selfies.

1664
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:44,544
She says that she'll take these memories
with her when she leaves the world.

1665
01:53:49,084 --> 01:53:50,057
What next?

1666
01:53:50,137 --> 01:53:54,025
She said that she wanted to travel
in her last days and do nothing else.

1667
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:56,771
Come.

1668
01:53:57,192 --> 01:54:00,771
I also thought..
let's put up a fight then.

1669
01:54:02,457 --> 01:54:04,328
I don't know what..

1670
01:54:07,192 --> 01:54:09,257
And you didn't go abroad
for your higher studies.

1671
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:16,684
Both of us just set out.

1672
01:54:18,987 --> 01:54:21,019
I don't know what
the future has in store.

1673
01:54:26,121 --> 01:54:27,613
Yeah!

1674
01:54:31,332 --> 01:54:33,321
I'm sure that Pallavi will get well.

1675
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:36,759
We're with her.

1676
01:54:38,186 --> 01:54:39,948
We'll fight together.

1677
01:54:44,306 --> 01:54:45,484
One more thing.

1678
01:54:50,058 --> 01:54:51,863
I'm really very proud of you.

1679
01:54:53,658 --> 01:54:56,868
Listen.. I love you.

1680
01:54:59,809 --> 01:55:01,820
This is a perfect profile
picture for social media. - Yes.

1681
01:55:02,674 --> 01:55:03,593
O god!

1682
01:55:06,543 --> 01:55:08,208
We didn't see anything.
- Yes.

1683
01:55:08,446 --> 01:55:09,332
We're just enjoying the mountains.

1684
01:55:09,412 --> 01:55:10,392
Come on.

1685
01:55:10,921 --> 01:55:12,900
I'm here.

1686
01:55:14,251 --> 01:55:16,327
You didn't even tell
me once before coming here.

1687
01:55:16,715 --> 01:55:17,515
Ungrateful fellows.

1688
01:55:17,731 --> 01:55:20,164
I admit that we made a mistake.
- Yes.

1689
01:55:20,244 --> 01:55:21,721
We must apologize together.

1690
01:55:22,488 --> 01:55:23,688
One.
- Two.

1691
01:55:24,553 --> 01:55:26,726
Sorry!
- It's okay.

1692
01:55:26,975 --> 01:55:28,369
Look how much they respect me.

1693
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,402
Let's click a group pic now.

1694
01:55:30,586 --> 01:55:32,272
Rai, come.
- Come on.

1695
01:55:33,343 --> 01:55:34,294
Ready?
- Ready.

1696
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:37,192
Yes.
- One. Two. Three.

1697
01:55:40,414 --> 01:55:41,722
Today I will..

1698
01:55:46,035 --> 01:55:49,559
Just imagine him having a Nepali wife.

1699
01:55:49,639 --> 01:55:50,965
I was wondering how their kids will be.

1700
01:55:51,045 --> 01:55:55,819
Siddhartha Sikdar.
Pablo Bose. Sunny Ghosh.

1701
01:55:56,014 --> 01:55:57,700
Yes, sweetheart. Where are you?

1702
01:55:58,467 --> 01:55:59,386
Flight copy.

1703
01:56:07,851 --> 01:56:10,802
And this is.. the hotel booking.

1704
01:56:13,353 --> 01:56:16,531
Lymph sarcoma of the interesting..

1705
01:56:18,056 --> 01:56:19,472
So, you lied to enjoy a vacation.

1706
01:56:22,878 --> 01:56:24,543
They're quiet now.

1707
01:56:32,109 --> 01:56:33,180
You're right.

1708
01:56:33,731 --> 01:56:37,050
Exactly like the way you've
come here with Meenakshi to enjoy.

1709
01:56:37,406 --> 01:56:40,822
No one in the office
knows about it but we do.

1710
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:43,838
We'll inform everybody.

1711
01:56:45,837 --> 01:56:48,400
What happened? You've become quiet.

1712
01:56:50,508 --> 01:56:53,816
So, go back quietly.

1713
01:56:54,982 --> 01:56:57,728
Blackmail? This is not right.

1714
01:56:57,902 --> 01:56:59,448
If you ruin our lives then..

1715
01:56:59,528 --> 01:57:04,032
..your female, blackmail
and everything else will be ruined.

1716
01:57:06,627 --> 01:57:10,519
We'll publicly striptease
your reputation.

1717
01:57:13,017 --> 01:57:16,076
What do you say, Meenakshi madam? Okay?

1718
01:57:16,627 --> 01:57:18,454
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir?

1719
01:57:18,886 --> 01:57:20,616
You're guilty and you're
trying to act smart?

1720
01:57:21,351 --> 01:57:23,675
You're fired.
One. Two.

1721
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:25,351
And three.

1722
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,649
Oh no!

1723
01:57:27,871 --> 01:57:29,417
Chennai Express.

1724
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,092
Wife. Wife.

1725
01:57:33,114 --> 01:57:34,346
Sister-in-law.

1726
01:57:36,259 --> 01:57:40,378
My husband, what didn't I feed you?

1727
01:57:40,648 --> 01:57:44,303
Idli, dosa, uttapapam..

1728
01:57:44,383 --> 01:57:47,135
I cooked lovingly for you.

1729
01:57:47,352 --> 01:57:49,460
And you came this far to enjoy with her?

1730
01:57:49,633 --> 01:57:50,444
Shame!

1731
01:57:50,617 --> 01:57:53,762
Wafer chips and that too a small packet.

1732
01:57:54,487 --> 01:57:55,384
Ignore them.

1733
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:56,887
Brother..
- Yes.

1734
01:57:57,168 --> 01:57:58,725
Kill him.

1735
01:57:59,071 --> 01:57:59,828
Oh no!

1736
01:58:05,687 --> 01:58:07,839
Meenamma..
- Yes, sir.

1737
01:58:08,768 --> 01:58:09,601
Run!

1738
01:58:10,941 --> 01:58:12,617
Help! Help!

1739
01:58:17,526 --> 01:58:18,781
What will Aiyyo Swamy do now?

1740
01:58:18,861 --> 01:58:21,138
Stop! Don't run!

1741
01:58:22,284 --> 01:58:25,841
Stop! Don't run!

1742
01:58:27,041 --> 01:58:28,728
Stop! Don't run!

1743
01:58:29,312 --> 01:58:30,371
Sir.

1744
01:58:30,749 --> 01:58:33,549
Stop! Don't run!

1745
01:58:40,705 --> 01:58:44,543
Brother, where did Aiyo Swamy hide?

1746
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,235
Oh no!

1747
01:59:04,489 --> 01:59:06,349
Catch him. Don't leave him.

1748
01:59:07,376 --> 01:59:08,403
Catch him.

1749
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:10,489
Sister, come on.

1750
01:59:14,057 --> 01:59:14,868
Catch him.

1751
01:59:14,948 --> 01:59:16,911
Sorry, madam. I'm sorry.

1752
01:59:16,991 --> 01:59:17,711
Sorry my foot.

1753
01:59:17,791 --> 01:59:18,511
Look.

1754
01:59:26,164 --> 01:59:29,786
Sir.. sir..
- Fast you come.

1755
01:59:39,689 --> 01:59:42,165
Sister, come quickly.
- My idiot husband.

1756
01:59:43,668 --> 01:59:46,457
He would've cut you into pieces.

1757
01:59:46,537 --> 01:59:48,197
Save me from my wife.

1758
01:59:48,392 --> 01:59:50,716
What will we get in return?
- I'll save your job.

1759
01:59:51,116 --> 01:59:52,651
Promise?
- Promise.

1760
01:59:54,683 --> 01:59:55,829
But how?

1761
01:59:57,829 --> 02:00:02,380
Nisha Thapa. - Dhusi Thapa.
- Nepal Bose.

1762
02:00:03,094 --> 02:00:04,823
You remember?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1763
02:00:05,612 --> 02:00:08,574
They should've an elder brother.
Isn't it?

1764
02:00:09,721 --> 02:00:12,835
Aiyyo! Aiyyo Thapa.

1765
02:00:13,224 --> 02:00:15,419
And..
- Meenu Thapa.

1766
02:00:15,592 --> 02:00:16,954
Room service.

1767
02:00:17,787 --> 02:00:19,441
Sister, come quickly.

1768
02:00:28,975 --> 02:00:29,851
Aiyyo!

1769
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:32,316
Thapa. Room service.

1770
02:00:33,592 --> 02:00:35,019
We'll go to work now.

1771
02:00:35,451 --> 02:00:38,922
Let's go. Let's go.

1772
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:41,149
We've south Indian cuisine with us.

1773
02:00:41,322 --> 02:00:43,052
We're not eager to go to office.

1774
02:00:43,257 --> 02:00:45,019
We're young souls..

1775
02:00:45,099 --> 02:00:46,479
..wearing Nepali shawls.

1776
02:00:46,728 --> 02:00:48,003
Excuse me.

1777
02:01:02,153 --> 02:01:03,959
Aiyyo Thapa.
