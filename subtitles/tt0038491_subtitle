1
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,761
- What happened, Bondhu?
- Nothing.

2
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,557
Then why were you screaming?

3
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,154
Because the train
is about to arrive.

4
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,167
And Mr. Dwarka is
arriving by this train.

5
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:09,032
- Is our Dwarka coming?!
- Yes, he is.

6
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:11,173
Oh wow!

7
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,174
- Ramu!
- Yes?

8
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,201
Wow! My same old village!

9
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:42,204
The same old station master!

10
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:46,542
The same old porter Ramu!

11
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:50,735
- And the same old Bhondu!
- Master!

12
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:53,213
My master has become a doctor!

13
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:59,212
Our new assistant.

14
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:30,647
Idiot! Your master is riding you.

15
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,813
Sprint with pride.
Or else...

16
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:41,661
Mr. Dwarka, give this old horse
some medicine once we get home.

17
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:45,267
We'll have to consult
another doctor for him.

18
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:47,665
I don't know how to
prescribe medicines for horses.

19
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:51,671
If you can't treat horses...

20
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:54,265
...how will you
treat human beings?

21
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:58,508
How will you
practice medicine here?

22
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:03,274
I won't be practicing here.

23
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:07,289
Not here in Sholapur?

24
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,286
Neither in Sholapur
nor in our country.

25
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,292
Then where?

26
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:17,696
In some other country.

27
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,290
Why?

28
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:23,839
For my country...
For my beloved India.

29
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,301
That won't be any life, master.

30
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:31,976
That will just be the life, Bhondu.

31
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:41,502
Brother is back!

32
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,901
Brother!

33
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,503
Mother! I'm back.

34
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,521
God bless you, my child!

35
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:02,384
Have something to eat first.

36
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:18,941
Oh! It's 'Laddus'.

37
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:21,539
My dear mother!

38
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,810
Look at how thin you've become.

39
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,552
I'm fine, mother.
Stop worrying.

40
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:36,547
- But where is father?
- He is not at home.

41
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:40,890
- He's gone to the city.
- City?

42
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:43,431
Yes. He has asked
you to come there.

43
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,965
- Why?
- I won't tell you.

44
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,036
Go there and take
a look yourself.

45
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,573
Brother Dwarka!

46
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,773
Brother, this cane is very nice.
Can I take it?

47
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:00,973
No. Give it here.

48
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:05,579
No. I've got it
for father from Bombay.

49
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:20,803
Father!

50
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:25,601
God bless you, son!

51
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,075
This is for you.

52
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,948
It's nice.

53
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,948
But you are my real
support in my old age.

54
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:46,295
Father?

55
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,623
Not only this board...

56
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:51,632
...but your entire clinic has
been equipped with everything.

57
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,104
Now you can begin your
practice whenever you want.

58
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:03,042
- But father...
- Have a look around first.

59
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,649
This is the waiting room.

60
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:12,254
Mother!

61
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:13,322
Come.

62
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,925
This is your room.

63
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,081
This is the operation theater.

64
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,686
Father...

65
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,682
I know you will be
disappointed to hear this.

66
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:56,687
But I won't practice here.

67
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:02,104
You won't practice here?

68
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:08,703
- Then where will you practice?
- I want to go to China.

69
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,713
On the war front.

70
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:16,173
On the war front?
As an army doctor?

71
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,517
Yes, father.
I have given my word.

72
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:24,726
The voice is still
echoing in my ears.

73
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:30,721
Yesterday when I was passing
by the Azaad Maidan in Bombay...

74
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,735
...I saw a big crowd
gathered there.

75
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:37,736
One of the leaders
of our country...

76
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,741
...was addressing the crowd
with great enthusiasm.

77
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:44,145
Brothers and sisters,
you are aware of...

78
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,738
...the atrocities meted
out on China by Japan.

79
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,751
The heart wrenching shrieks...

80
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:55,153
...of the millions of widows
and orphans of that country...

81
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,749
...have shaken the world and
the very foundations of this earth!

82
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:03,162
Just think and tell me. Isn't
it our duty to help our neighbour?

83
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,631
People replied
with equal enthusiasm.

84
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,099
Yes, we must help them!

85
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:13,775
Then let's get together
and serve that nation.

86
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:17,037
Some of you can
fulfill your duties...

87
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:20,775
...by sending across
medicines and other necessities.

88
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:23,645
And thus prove your
sympathies towards them.

89
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:24,786
Yes!

90
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:31,782
People donated thousands
of rupees for this cause.

91
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:36,655
At this, the leader once again
spoke in a voice of anguish.

92
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:41,132
It's nice to know that you're
willing to help in every way.

93
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:44,806
But more than these
materialistic things...

94
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:48,205
...we need doctors there!

95
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:54,805
Are there any doctors who are
willing to risk their own lives...

96
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:58,215
...and go on the
war front to China...

97
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,154
...and treat the
millions of war victims?!

98
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,821
The thousands of people
gathered there fell silent.

99
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:14,700
There was absolute silence.

100
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:19,432
The leader appealed once again.

101
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,843
Is there any such
patriotic doctor?!

102
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:23,844
To this I replied,
"Yes, there is".

103
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:30,852
- What's your name?
- Dwarkanath Kotnis.

104
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:35,254
- Where are you from?
- Sholapur.

105
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,861
Praise be Dr. Dwarkanath!

106
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,930
Praise be Kotnis!

107
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,124
Praise be Sholapur!

108
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:47,862
Praise be our country!

109
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:17,293
Father, why are you quiet?

110
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:23,303
You don't agree with
my decision, do you?

111
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,911
I am sure you are
worrying about something.

112
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,785
You have to tell me.

113
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,921
Doesn't a son have even this
much of right over his father?

114
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:46,917
He surely does. But a father
has more rights over his son.

115
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:50,923
You agree, don't you?

116
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:01,602
Go and start
preparing to go to China.

117
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:05,947
Father! You mean it?!

118
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:09,616
Are you happily sending me?

119
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:13,352
- Have I done the right thing?
- Yes, you have.

120
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,949
Had I been in your place,
I would have done the same.

121
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:22,359
Thank you, father! There
couldn't be a better father!

122
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:25,967
Oh get away! Show this
affection to your mother.

123
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,036
Mother!

124
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,981
'The Indian medical mission will
be leaving for China tonight...

125
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:42,380
...by the Rajput vessel.

126
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,975
'The five brave doctors
of the Indian medical mission'

127
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:09,406
Father, please
meet my colleagues.

128
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,002
The other doctors
in our medical mission.

129
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:15,015
Meet Dr. Atal,
our leader from Lucknow.

130
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,276
Dr. Cholkar from Nagpur.

131
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:21,014
Dr. Basu and Dr. Mukherjee
are from Calcutta.

132
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:25,026
I am very happy
to meet all of you.

133
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:31,024
I feel as though, not one but
five of my sons are going on war.

134
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:34,566
May God protect you all.

135
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:40,032
Brother! Mother
is calling you.

136
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,051
Mother, you love lighting
these lamps, don't you?

137
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:53,583
Your mother's affection
lies in this, son.

138
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,717
May God bless you
with a long life!

139
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:05,461
May your wish be fulfilled soon
and you return home.

140
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:09,471
I shall await your arrival
with this lit lamp.

141
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:12,067
My Dwarka!

142
00:17:57,586 --> 00:18:00,919
Oh dear! You forgot
to give him the ring.

143
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:03,124
You reminded me just in time.

144
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:20,539
Son, this ring is not a
mere map of our country.

145
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,133
It is a jewel in the
honour of our nation.

146
00:18:24,113 --> 00:18:27,139
This ring will not
only remind you of us...

147
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:31,150
...but also that the honour
of our country is in your hands.

148
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,157
Return to your country only after
completing the task undertaken.

149
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,239
Mr. Atal, it has been four
months since we left our country.

150
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:00,806
We haven't received a
single letter from home.

151
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,642
So all of you are missing home.

152
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:10,251
This is what happens
when one is idle.

153
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:15,247
If nothing else,
let's take care of these boxes.

154
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,859
All one can gets to
see is medicines here.

155
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:24,663
You might just find a medicine
to rid you of your loneliness.

156
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:33,670
Wow! This is an
amazing medicine!

157
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,277
- What is it?
- Let's have a look.

158
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:37,805
Here.

159
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:01,700
Listen to the song!

160
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:23,378
It feels as though
we are in India.

161
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:31,392
That's the enemy bombardment!
Get to safety!

162
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:14,230
Wait, doctor. You're here
to save lives and to lose one.

163
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:18,428
Don't stop me. Can't you hear the
kids screaming? I will save them.

164
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,905
I say, wait!

165
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:25,444
Thank you for saving my life.

166
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:04,212
All the kids have been saved.
Now hurry and get out of here.

167
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:29,303
May Lord Vishnu bless you
for this noble deed!

168
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,844
You seem very
interested in India.

169
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,515
That's right.
I've spent 10 years...

170
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:38,518
...in your beautiful country
travelling all over.

171
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,714
People call me a vagabond
Vagabond Wong.

172
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,255
Not Vagabond, but you
are Our Wong... Uncle Wong.

173
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,530
I'll call you
Uncle Wong from now onwards.

174
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:52,526
My name is Dwarka Kotnis.

175
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:55,927
That's a nice name you have.
I'm glad to meet you.

176
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:59,540
Years ago, India had sent
the message of Gautam Buddha...

177
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,541
...in order to calm
our restless spirits.

178
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:04,544
And this time
India has sent you...

179
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:07,137
...in order to soothe
the injured body of China.

180
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,993
You're so good, Dwarka.

181
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:57,997
You parents are very fortunate
to have a son like you.

182
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,802
My parents...!

183
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:12,602
Wow! Letters from India!
Letters from home!

184
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,648
What happened, Dwarka?

185
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,785
My father...

186
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,659
He is no more!

187
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:06,060
Dwarka, pull yourself together.

188
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:09,661
Try to bear the grief.

189
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:20,347
I wonder what state
my mother is in.

190
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:30,152
Dwarka, I think you
should return to India.

191
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:35,685
It is very important for you
to be next to your at this point.

192
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:43,496
All right, doctor.
I should be going.

193
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,106
I'll go make arrangements
for your departure.

194
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:54,112
Mukherjee and Basu,
pack Dwarka's bags.

195
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:23,735
Son, this is not
only the map of India...

196
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:26,609
...but the jewel in
honour of our country.

197
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:30,143
Not only will this ring
remind you of us...

198
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:34,347
...but also that the honour of
our country rests in your hands.

199
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:39,757
Return to your country only after
you've completed the task taken.

200
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,565
Dwarka, hurry
and have your meal.

201
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:54,104
You may have to leave
as soon as Dr. Atal arrives.

202
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,777
I don't want to go.

203
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,778
You don't want to go?
You don't want to go to India?

204
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:06,582
All the arrangements have
been done. Don't make it late.

205
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:10,780
But Dwarka says that
he does not want to go.

206
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:16,661
Yes, doctor. My duty compels
me to stay here with you.

207
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,800
Your mother will
be disappointed.

208
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:25,798
In fact she will be disappointed
if I leave my work unfinished.

209
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:29,401
Even my father's
soul will be hurt.

210
00:29:30,845 --> 00:29:33,814
The duty of a son
of India is not to...

211
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,815
...run away
from a battlefield...

212
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:38,147
...and find refuge
in a mother's veil!

213
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:41,822
It will be cowardice if
I shun my responsibilities...

214
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:44,824
...instead of sacrificing my
life for the honour of my nation.

215
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:47,425
It will be a mar bravery.

216
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:51,824
I had promised
my parents something.

217
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,231
And I won't go home until
I have completed the task.

218
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:13,649
It has been decided to send
you to war to north China.

219
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:16,186
- Here's the map of your journey.
- Thank you.

220
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,255
I am also sending
a young man along with you.

221
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,333
He will accompany
you till Yanan.

222
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,869
He has to proceed
elsewhere from there.

223
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,531
He's smart and has studied
a small medical course.

224
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,275
Where is he?

225
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:54,292
- You got late?
- Yes, sir.

226
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,761
- Do you know them?
- No, I don't.

227
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:59,229
- They are China's friends.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,564
- Indian doctors.
- No, sir.

229
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:04,899
Yes, sir.

230
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,930
- When do we meet again, uncle?
- We'll surely meet.

231
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,939
After all I am vagabond Wong.

232
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:44,342
Aachin! Come in. Hurry.

233
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,084
Make yourself comfortable.
There's lots of space.

234
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:51,945
Right, sir.

235
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:55,353
Come closer.
Why are you afraid?

236
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,947
Everyone is equal
on a journey, brother.

237
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:03,964
Where did you get
these girl like hands from?

238
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,968
You have a nice hand.

239
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:12,495
- You'll get a nice wife.
- No, sir.

240
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,967
- What?
- Yes, sir.

241
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:19,977
What do you mean by yes and no?
Do you want a wife or not?

242
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:23,779
Why are you making a face?
Laugh.

243
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,385
Yes, sir.

244
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:34,995
'Yanan'

245
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,413
Welcome to the guerrilla regiment.

246
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,541
I give all of you
a very warm welcome!

247
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,018
Let me show you
where you are to stay.

248
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:04,422
Where is Aachin?

249
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:11,022
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, sir.

250
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:16,900
You must say, "Namaste".

251
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:18,038
What?

252
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:36,056
Listen, Basu.

253
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:39,058
Respected Uncle Wong, we've
stayed in Yanan for 6 months...

254
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,061
...and have come
to north of China.

255
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:46,065
Dr. Cholkar and Dr. Mukherjee
fell ill on reaching Yanan.

256
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,727
They were compelled
to return to India.

257
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:51,469
Even Dr. Atal has
fallen very sick...

258
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,870
...and is leaving
for India today.

259
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:57,475
Even Basu and I have
been ordered to leave Yanan...

260
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:00,672
...and proceed further to
separate Guerrilla war areas.

261
00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:03,012
- And...
- End the letter, Dwarka.

262
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:05,677
- Dr. Atal will get late.
- All right.

263
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:09,089
The rest will
follow later... Dwarka.

264
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:26,971
How unfortunate that
even I have fallen sick...

265
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:29,974
...and am returning
back to our country.

266
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:41,110
Now the responsibility of
our mission is in your hands.

267
00:34:58,172 --> 00:35:02,802
Basu, now it is
our turn to separate.

268
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:08,137
I'll keep writing. Please
reply to my letters, Dwarka.

269
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:12,152
Definitely.

270
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:19,159
Listen!

271
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:25,154
Don't leave me behind and
return home after the war.

272
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:34,174
Bye. Time is running out.

273
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:39,178
The path is unknown
and the destination far.

274
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:20,220
Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis.

275
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:31,092
Where can I meet the General
of the Guerrilla warfare?

276
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:33,233
I haven't met him
ever since I got here.

277
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:38,237
I'll take you. He's in his
cave treating his old wounds.

278
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,636
Let's go.

279
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:13,273
Where is the General?

280
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:15,865
Here he is...
There he goes.

281
00:37:21,516 --> 00:37:24,212
Get to your posts
before the enemy attacks.

282
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:27,685
The enemy is
carrying a lot of weapons.

283
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:32,292
- Excuse me, General!
- Who is it?!

284
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:38,291
- You are the Indian doctor?
- Yes.

285
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,696
I am sorry.

286
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:44,705
- Your name...
- Dwarkanath Kotnis.

287
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,899
Dr. Kotnis, I am
glad to meet you.

288
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:50,310
General, get
your bandage tied.

289
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:52,844
All right.

290
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:55,315
Wait!

291
00:37:58,352 --> 00:38:00,320
- You have less guns.
- But we have these.

292
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:02,321
We'll tackle
the enemy with these.

293
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:03,390
Very good!

294
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,327
Very good!

295
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:10,727
How will one tie the bandage
until you don't stay still?

296
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:13,333
I can't stay still.
Forget the bandage.

297
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:15,733
Very good, soldiers!

298
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:18,335
You have to get
good prey today.

299
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,339
Keep a strict watch over them.

300
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,341
The Japanese beasts
should not get away.

301
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,676
Hey! Look here!

302
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:29,748
Now you had better
look and listen, General.

303
00:38:31,252 --> 00:38:34,346
Just the way you're responsible
for the Guerrilla force...

304
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:38,824
...similarly I'm responsible
for the welfare for everyone.

305
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,350
Yes, of course, doctor.

306
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:52,702
You ought to realise that
you are the life of this place.

307
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:56,976
Hence, you should always
take care of your health.

308
00:38:57,411 --> 00:38:59,902
All right, doctor.
You are right.

309
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:03,784
I'll show you
the hospital here.

310
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,389
Since the past one month...

311
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,390
...we've been running the
hospital without a doctor.

312
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:14,385
Isn't that strange?

313
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:17,396
It's good to have you around.

314
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,404
Look, he is your new doctor...

315
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:40,420
Wait!

316
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:45,021
Where is the list of the
number of people to be operated?

317
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:53,831
Bring the list quickly.

318
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:09,847
Who are you?

319
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:16,456
- How come you're here?
- I'm your assistant.

320
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:20,454
That's good.
Get everything ready.

321
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:21,913
- Now help me wash my hands.
- Yes.

322
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:27,821
What are you doing?
Come on!

323
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:34,534
Hey, you're a girl!

324
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:45,534
- So why the disguise?
- To avert the enemies.

325
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,543
What's your real name?

326
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:51,949
And where are you from?

327
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:56,556
- Why did you leave Peking?
- Wash your hands.

328
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:05,030
You had all of us
fooled on the journey.

329
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,567
Soap.

330
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:22,580
Those delicate hands like a girl
were actually a girl's hands.

331
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:32,988
- And what else?
- Nothing at all.

332
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:37,597
Now what do we do?!

333
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:40,600
I mean, now what will you do?

334
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:42,869
I'll show you the way.

335
00:42:44,638 --> 00:42:46,606
- Let's go.
- Where?

336
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,607
The place where you stay.

337
00:42:58,652 --> 00:42:59,619
And...

338
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:24,110
- What happened?
- This is your cave.

339
00:43:24,678 --> 00:43:28,637
It couldn't be so close.
It isn't mine.

340
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:38,859
Now what can one do?

341
00:43:41,095 --> 00:43:43,655
Come in and have tea
and then go to your cave.

342
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:12,220
What times! It doesn't take
much for a girl to become a boy.

343
00:44:57,771 --> 00:44:59,136
Yes, doctor?

344
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:08,544
I won't let you go. You have
had me confused since yesterday.

345
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,141
What's the matter with you?

346
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:14,152
Within a moment you
are happy as ever can be.

347
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,746
And in no time, you're as
sad as a shriveled flower.

348
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,760
What is the mystery?

349
00:45:22,796 --> 00:45:25,424
Why don't you answer?

350
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,998
Don't you trust me?
Why are you behaving this way?

351
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:37,774
Is it because I am a
foreigner, an Indian?

352
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:42,176
Don't speak so, doctor.
I trust you.

353
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:50,780
I was afraid lest my mournful
tale may upset you too.

354
00:45:52,026 --> 00:45:56,793
A chill runs down my
spine whenever I think of...

355
00:45:56,897 --> 00:46:00,799
...the frightful
sight I had seen.

356
00:46:01,835 --> 00:46:03,803
And my smile fades away.

357
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,806
I am sorry. But I will
never ask you this ever again.

358
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:16,815
No. Now I feel like
sharing my story with you.

359
00:46:18,852 --> 00:46:21,616
I was studying medicine at
the Nanking College of Medicine.

360
00:46:22,856 --> 00:46:26,223
Everyone is aware of the
atrocities meted out in college.

361
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:29,621
The bloodshed grounds...

362
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:35,824
...where unarmed youth
were slaughtered by the enemy.

363
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:40,837
The old and sick were
crushed under their heels!

364
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,843
Pregnant women were strangled!

365
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:51,318
Innocent children were swung in
the air and killed with spikes!

366
00:46:52,886 --> 00:47:00,258
Amongst those killed
was my family too!

367
00:47:01,328 --> 00:47:03,660
I don't know
why God spared me.

368
00:47:05,065 --> 00:47:10,867
It was easy for me to die
but difficult to live.

369
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:19,068
I was alone. I disguised myself,
faced all difficulties...

370
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,875
...and somehow managed
to hide myself and get here.

371
00:47:27,921 --> 00:47:29,889
To serve my country.

372
00:47:35,129 --> 00:47:37,097
You are a very brave girl.

373
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:41,697
Even a man would find it
difficult to face such problems.

374
00:47:43,937 --> 00:47:49,375
The state of my countrymen
is worse than my grief.

375
00:47:50,944 --> 00:47:52,912
But what can we do?

376
00:47:53,947 --> 00:47:56,916
We can at least try
to lessen their pain.

377
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,920
This is the biggest
duty of a doctor.

378
00:48:02,956 --> 00:48:08,326
Yes, doctor. We shall help
them relieve their pain.

379
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,598
We shall give them
happiness and relief.

380
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:18,934
You are very nice.

381
00:48:29,216 --> 00:48:31,207
Hey, this is of use to me.

382
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:37,815
What are you doing, General?
This is an operation scissor.

383
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:42,485
Yes, I know. I am operating
on these sick moustaches.

384
00:48:54,107 --> 00:48:56,974
General, why have you
sported this moustache?

385
00:48:57,077 --> 00:48:58,977
Why don't you
just clean it off?

386
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:01,976
Clean it off? Never.

387
00:49:02,216 --> 00:49:05,447
Nobody will call me a
General if I have no moustache.

388
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,005
- Tea? Black tea?
- Yes.

389
00:49:35,048 --> 00:49:37,016
- Sugar?
- No, thank you.

390
00:49:37,117 --> 00:49:39,017
One doesn't require
sugar in Chinese tea.

391
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:43,020
Don't you know? Indians
call sugar 'Chini'.

392
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:46,025
No wonder you speak so sweet.

393
00:49:47,327 --> 00:49:51,024
You're teasing me! Can't you
think of something else to speak?

394
00:49:51,265 --> 00:49:53,699
Who else do I talk about?

395
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:57,429
- Talk about here and there.
- Here and there?!

396
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:07,308
There's nothing there,
nor here.

397
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:14,042
All right.
Let's talk about this teapot.

398
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:19,448
"The most beautiful
teapot in the world"

399
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:23,521
"There's nectar in your body"

400
00:50:24,097 --> 00:50:26,657
"Your rosy lips emit
a fragrance so sweet"

401
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:33,061
"You make me warm
and give me a sense of peace"

402
00:50:33,707 --> 00:50:37,074
"In every senses lies"

403
00:50:37,177 --> 00:50:40,476
Enough. Are you day dreaming?

404
00:50:41,114 --> 00:50:46,609
Is your dream girl a
pretty bride or the teapot?

405
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,079
"I talk about the teapot
but have in mind the bride"

406
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,776
That's a lovely tune you're
humming. What song is it?

407
00:51:10,344 --> 00:51:12,312
It's the song of
a Chinese bride.

408
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:14,437
- Song of a Chinese bride?
- Yes.

409
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:19,107
- I will surely hear you sing.
- What if I don't sing?

410
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:21,653
Then I shall leave immediately.

411
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:23,622
You're most welcome to.

412
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:37,305
Fate has brought us together.
You from Peking and me from India.

413
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:41,120
There has to be some
mystery for us to meet here.

414
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:43,820
What better than this...

415
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:48,316
...that I have got a good doctor
and you a good assistant.

416
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:52,627
- Is that all?
- That is more than enough for me.

417
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:54,324
Hello, Dwarka!

418
00:54:57,437 --> 00:54:59,667
Uncle Wong?!

419
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,343
- When did you come?
- Just today.

420
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:07,140
And I have got
tired looking for you.

421
00:55:08,381 --> 00:55:09,746
Please come in, uncle.

422
00:55:10,984 --> 00:55:14,147
Chinlan, meet Uncle Wong,
an old friend of mine.

423
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:17,356
Uncle, she is Chinlan,
my assistant.

424
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:18,822
She is very nice.

425
00:55:18,992 --> 00:55:21,756
Your assistant is very nice.

426
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:24,761
Let's leave, uncle.

427
00:55:35,408 --> 00:55:38,775
Well, Uncle? How are you?
Tell me all about you?

428
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:42,370
I'll tell you all,
but first you tell me one thing.

429
00:55:42,482 --> 00:55:44,780
Have you fixed everything
with Chinlan as yet or not?

430
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:48,376
What are you talking about?

431
00:55:48,488 --> 00:55:51,389
Whether she will
marry you or not?

432
00:55:52,826 --> 00:55:54,384
You're amazing, uncle!

433
00:55:54,661 --> 00:56:00,395
I say... I mean,
we hardly know each other.

434
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:03,800
And I wonder if she
even likes me or not.

435
00:56:04,437 --> 00:56:10,398
One can miss the light at times.

436
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:15,810
The sparkle in her eyes
said that she likes you.

437
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:20,414
All right, uncle. May be so.
I'll ask her someday.

438
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:27,415
When two hearts meet,
you mustn't hesitate.

439
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:31,429
Waste no time
or time shall fly away.

440
00:56:32,465 --> 00:56:35,025
In fact go and
ask her right now.

441
00:56:35,468 --> 00:56:36,833
All right, uncle.

442
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,438
All right, uncle.

443
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:51,450
Is there a dearth
of boys in China?!

444
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:54,453
I'm back.

445
00:57:23,516 --> 00:57:26,485
What's the matter?
Who were they?

446
00:57:26,853 --> 00:57:28,878
They seemed to be angry.

447
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:33,288
They came to see me. The elders
of the neighbouring village.

448
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:36,484
Even Mr. Wong is
the elder of Chunking.

449
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:38,564
He's been very helpful to me.

450
00:57:39,532 --> 00:57:42,695
He asked me whether I
had asked you or not?

451
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:47,505
I laughed and told him that
I would ask you right away.

452
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:53,911
Then on the way
I thought this is no joke.

453
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:57,914
After all I have to say it
one day. So why not today?

454
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,325
Chinlan, don't
think I am fooling.

455
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:18,935
Chinlan, I mean to
actually ask you this.

456
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:22,869
Will you marry me?

457
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:36,146
Answer, Chinlan.
Will you marry me?

458
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,550
I am sorry, doctor.
But you haven't understood me.

459
00:58:41,594 --> 00:58:43,562
Why haven't I understood you?

460
00:58:43,997 --> 00:58:47,433
Are you trying to say
that I am not worthy of you?

461
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,058
That's not the case, doctor.

462
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:57,975
All I want to say is
that I will never marry.

463
00:58:59,012 --> 00:59:00,980
I am helpless.

464
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:05,974
That means, our friendship, our
meetings, our talks, our hopes...

465
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,587
That was a big mistake.

466
00:59:09,022 --> 00:59:11,991
We ought to have concerned
ourselves only to the hospital.

467
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:17,596
All right.

468
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:22,265
You've taken it to heart.
You are angry.

469
01:00:02,876 --> 01:00:05,970
Doctor, are you
still angry with me?

470
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,972
Soap.

471
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:18,123
I was helpless then
and still am.

472
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:19,658
Water.

473
01:00:25,698 --> 01:00:28,462
There's no harm in
talking to me properly.

474
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:36,270
Doctor, we can
still be friends.

475
01:00:36,709 --> 01:00:39,269
We should associate ourselves
only with the hospital work.

476
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:57,196
Uncle!

477
01:01:05,738 --> 01:01:08,969
The General has asked you
to report to him immediately.

478
01:01:10,743 --> 01:01:11,710
Really?

479
01:01:55,922 --> 01:02:00,222
Doctor, these people have
a complaint against you.

480
01:02:00,927 --> 01:02:02,758
What's the matter?

481
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:05,763
I ask you the same?

482
01:02:05,865 --> 01:02:08,231
Why have I been
brought here as a prisoner?

483
01:02:08,868 --> 01:02:13,168
Answer my question first, doctor.
Do you love this girl?

484
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:22,645
- Yes... But...
- No ifs or buts!

485
01:02:23,483 --> 01:02:26,179
Do you love the doctor?

486
01:02:30,857 --> 01:02:31,846
Answer!

487
01:02:34,827 --> 01:02:37,796
Yes, but the truth is...

488
01:02:37,897 --> 01:02:39,797
I don't care about
what the truth is!

489
01:02:39,899 --> 01:02:44,529
How shameless they can get!
They even admitted their mistake.

490
01:02:44,704 --> 01:02:45,796
Shut up!

491
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,604
Both the culprits
have admitted their mistakes.

492
01:02:50,843 --> 01:02:54,210
Now they will be given
such a punishment that...

493
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:59,084
General, she is not at fault.
I am the only culprit.

494
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:01,812
No, General.
The doctor is innocent.

495
01:03:01,954 --> 01:03:03,888
If at all anyone is at fault,
it is me.

496
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:11,819
This only proves how deep
their love is for each other.

497
01:03:12,865 --> 01:03:16,301
Hence I shall punish
them very severely.

498
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:19,269
I shall give them
a severe punishment.

499
01:03:19,872 --> 01:03:24,832
So that they do not
waste time in love.

500
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:29,643
And that they wed
each other within 3 days.

501
01:03:52,905 --> 01:03:54,668
There's no need to get angry.

502
01:03:54,907 --> 01:03:58,866
The General's decision implies
that their wedding will be...

503
01:03:58,978 --> 01:04:03,881
...a beautiful memory of
the Indo-China relationship.

504
01:04:31,944 --> 01:04:33,912
General, where is Dwarka?

505
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:39,179
You look so good in
the Chinese outfit.

506
01:04:40,953 --> 01:04:42,921
Look over there as well.

507
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:57,327
You're looking beautiful!
Just like an Indian bride.

508
01:06:16,048 --> 01:06:19,484
This precious ring which
is dearer to me than life...

509
01:06:19,585 --> 01:06:22,281
...I hand over to you.

510
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:29,027
What an auspicious wedding!

511
01:06:29,128 --> 01:06:33,622
It has united two hearts,
two hands and two countries.

512
01:07:26,986 --> 01:07:29,477
You look so lovely and sweet!

513
01:07:31,123 --> 01:07:34,092
I wish even my mother was
watching you at this moment.

514
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:37,357
Will she like me?

515
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:41,099
Will she be happy to see me?

516
01:07:41,534 --> 01:07:45,698
She will be. Even happiness
would be happy on seeing you.

517
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:53,101
Chinlan, my desire is
to see you happy always.

518
01:07:56,148 --> 01:08:01,916
Happiness is so rare
in a battlefield.

519
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:08,524
I completely forgot.

520
01:08:12,164 --> 01:08:13,995
What are you doing?

521
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:18,136
This is a Chinese tradition.
Every Chinese bride...

522
01:08:18,237 --> 01:08:20,603
...has to do
this after marriage.

523
01:08:24,176 --> 01:08:26,542
But you're an Indian wife.

524
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:34,146
Then what does an
Indian bride have to do?

525
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:40,156
It's a custom which if
not practiced angers God.

526
01:08:40,593 --> 01:08:43,153
- God gets angry?
- Yes.

527
01:08:43,262 --> 01:08:45,162
Tell me what the custom is.

528
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:51,167
Wait... I get it.
The old books have this.

529
01:08:52,538 --> 01:08:56,167
The bridegroom sits
the way I am sitting.

530
01:08:57,209 --> 01:08:59,177
And the bride...

531
01:09:00,212 --> 01:09:04,706
And the bride sits at
this distance from the groom.

532
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,593
And there's no problem
if the distance reduces.

533
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:20,198
And then the groom puts
his right arm across the bride...

534
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:23,200
...and holds the
bride's right hand.

535
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:29,196
- And then?
- Then there's hardly anything.

536
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:33,211
The groom takes his hand...

537
01:09:33,312 --> 01:09:40,684
With his right hand he lifts the
bride's face and moves forward.

538
01:09:41,253 --> 01:09:43,016
He moves still further...

539
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:46,224
Come on! You've sweet talked
your way into using your hands.

540
01:09:49,261 --> 01:09:53,220
You mustn't move away.
An Indian bride never does that.

541
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:55,467
But Chinese brides do it.

542
01:09:57,403 --> 01:09:59,234
I will never sit
next to you ever again.

543
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:01,238
I'll go away from here.

544
01:10:03,609 --> 01:10:05,577
Even if you call me I won't come.

545
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:12,645
You're not even calling me.
I am actually leaving.

546
01:10:16,889 --> 01:10:21,258
Watch out! The enemy
is dropping bombs!

547
01:10:26,298 --> 01:10:31,930
Dwarka, promise me that you
will always remain with me.

548
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:38,732
Yes, Chin. I will
always remain with you.

549
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,681
Last night's
bombardments clearly indicate...

550
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:52,279
...that the enemy
has learnt of this base.

551
01:10:52,391 --> 01:10:54,291
They will keep
bombarding our camp.

552
01:10:54,393 --> 01:10:57,294
We will have to shift immediately.
Get ready soon.

553
01:11:12,745 --> 01:11:13,712
Hurry!

554
01:12:25,684 --> 01:12:29,780
Basu, and this is how we
have been walking since months.

555
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:32,379
We have covered several miles.

556
01:12:32,491 --> 01:12:34,391
The enemy does not
let us rest any place.

557
01:12:34,493 --> 01:12:38,395
Once we reached the Lungshang
hill beyond the enemy line.

558
01:12:38,497 --> 01:12:39,930
And then...

559
01:13:05,457 --> 01:13:07,425
What are you
thinking about, Dwarka?

560
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,829
A new kind of
disease like blisters...

561
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,420
...is spreading
amongst our patients.

562
01:13:14,466 --> 01:13:17,833
If it spreads, the result
will be very frightful.

563
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:41,926
All three of them succumbed
to the disease of blisters.

564
01:13:44,496 --> 01:13:45,463
Wait!

565
01:13:48,701 --> 01:13:52,660
The same damn blister!
Chin, pass me the slide.

566
01:13:57,176 --> 01:14:00,942
I want to observe the pus of
this blister under a microscope.

567
01:14:12,524 --> 01:14:14,890
I am perplexed at
what this disease is.

568
01:14:21,934 --> 01:14:24,903
This damn blister!

569
01:14:25,804 --> 01:14:27,897
Please cut off my leg!

570
01:14:32,544 --> 01:14:34,512
This horrible blister!

571
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:47,523
Yes! This is what
should be done.

572
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:50,524
What, Dwarka?

573
01:14:50,629 --> 01:14:53,530
I will inject the pus
from this blister in my body.

574
01:14:53,632 --> 01:14:57,932
With this we will know
how it's poison effects me.

575
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,538
Then it will be easier
to deduce a treatment.

576
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:02,539
What do you think about it?

577
01:15:02,641 --> 01:15:06,941
We don't know what kind of poison
it is and how it will affect you.

578
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:11,539
It's a risk to your life. I'll
never let you do such a thing.

579
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:13,550
Why not?!

580
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:29,556
Be at guard! The enemy
airplanes are approaching!

581
01:15:29,668 --> 01:15:30,566
Careful!

582
01:17:22,714 --> 01:17:24,682
So you did what
you wanted to do.

583
01:18:06,758 --> 01:18:09,386
You have tried eight
kinds of medicines already.

584
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:15,727
This time, this new
medicine will surely work.

585
01:19:00,812 --> 01:19:04,373
My wound is healing.
The new medicine worked!

586
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:07,782
I've found the cure
to the damn blister!

587
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:11,786
The new revolution!

588
01:19:24,836 --> 01:19:28,203
How is your blister?
How are you?

589
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,667
Thank you, doctor.
All of us are fine now.

590
01:19:32,911 --> 01:19:34,208
That's good.

591
01:19:35,847 --> 01:19:37,815
Let me have a look
at your blister.

592
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:41,816
Very good!

593
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:44,214
Chin, get me another bandage.

594
01:19:54,266 --> 01:19:55,824
What happened, Chin?

595
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:58,369
Are you ill, Chin?

596
01:20:10,882 --> 01:20:14,978
What a good doctor you are?
Can't you tell even this much?

597
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,246
What?

598
01:20:21,793 --> 01:20:23,852
You're pregnant.

599
01:20:26,898 --> 01:20:31,858
This means we are going to
have a tiny soldier in our army.

600
01:20:33,905 --> 01:20:37,204
It will be a tiny doctor,
not a soldier.

601
01:20:37,909 --> 01:20:40,207
That's right.
A tiny doctor.

602
01:20:40,912 --> 01:20:43,881
A very big doctor,
and not a tiny one.

603
01:20:45,317 --> 01:20:46,875
- Come with me.
- Where?

604
01:20:46,985 --> 01:20:47,952
Come along.

605
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:02,297
Friends, this
is that brave man...

606
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,301
...who made many a big
sacrifices for our country.

607
01:21:05,937 --> 01:21:08,235
This is the brave man
who risked his life...

608
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,309
...and gave us a cure to
the poisonous blister disease.

609
01:21:11,943 --> 01:21:15,435
This is that brave man who saved
the lives of millions of patients.

610
01:21:18,617 --> 01:21:21,313
Not only are you
the son of India...

611
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:24,320
...but also of our country.

612
01:21:24,956 --> 01:21:26,321
Now onwards we
shall address you as...

613
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:28,324
..."The apple of China's eye"

614
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,927
Thank you!

615
01:21:42,274 --> 01:21:44,265
"The apple of China'a eye"

616
01:25:10,048 --> 01:25:12,949
Son, too bad
that you have fallen ill.

617
01:25:14,185 --> 01:25:18,144
Don't worry, uncle.
I am absolutely fine.

618
01:25:18,423 --> 01:25:20,152
Let's go.

619
01:25:22,193 --> 01:25:25,162
There's a big enemy
force advancing towards us.

620
01:25:25,263 --> 01:25:27,163
I'll head towards them
with all the men.

621
01:25:27,265 --> 01:25:30,166
You take the children, women
and sick to the Lungshang hill.

622
01:25:30,268 --> 01:25:32,702
- Don't delay.
- But General...

623
01:25:33,204 --> 01:25:35,172
It's better if I go with you.

624
01:25:35,273 --> 01:25:37,969
It will be important for me
to be there at this juncture.

625
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:41,977
Yes... You are
right, doctor.

626
01:25:42,213 --> 01:25:45,182
You remain here.
The injured will be sent here.

627
01:25:46,785 --> 01:25:52,052
My brave girl, take the women
and kids to the Lungshang hills.

628
01:25:52,223 --> 01:25:53,190
Yes, General.

629
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:55,589
Bye... If I remain alive,
we'll meet again.

630
01:25:55,827 --> 01:25:57,192
May you be victorious!

631
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:06,194
Chin, I am worried about you.

632
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:09,604
How will you
bear the rough trek...

633
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:12,198
...of the mountainous
region in this state.

634
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:16,213
Don't worry about me.

635
01:26:17,515 --> 01:26:21,417
- You take care of yourself.
- Yes, I will.

636
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,773
Who is it?!

637
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:03,047
Our injured soldier.

638
01:29:10,421 --> 01:29:11,854
Some more injured ones.

639
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,627
Enemy!

640
01:29:17,629 --> 01:29:20,189
Stop! Drop your gun!

641
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:21,796
Raise your hands!

642
01:29:28,773 --> 01:29:32,402
You don't look like a Chinese.
Who are you?

643
01:29:32,844 --> 01:29:35,813
- I am an Indian doctor.
- What are you doing here?

644
01:29:36,447 --> 01:29:38,415
To see the acts of you brutes!

645
01:29:40,752 --> 01:29:42,413
Not now!

646
01:29:44,656 --> 01:29:49,616
He may come handy. Take him
to our headquarters at Nanking.

647
01:29:50,395 --> 01:29:51,419
Come on!

648
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:34,182
Stay ready.
He may come out.

649
01:32:39,897 --> 01:32:42,991
He's dead! Now only
his dead body will float!

650
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,590
Let's leave.

651
01:32:52,043 --> 01:32:54,011
Hey! Move aside!

652
01:33:13,664 --> 01:33:16,633
That's right.
Lungshang hill.

653
01:33:17,668 --> 01:33:19,636
How far is it from here?

654
01:33:19,737 --> 01:33:24,640
It's miles away. It will
take you months to get there.

655
01:33:25,676 --> 01:33:29,635
But look at your state.
How will you get there?

656
01:33:30,081 --> 01:33:32,641
Have you given
up on your life?

657
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:38,052
My life and duty await
me at the Lungshan hill.

658
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,574
- Doctor Kotnis is back!
- Water...

659
01:33:57,708 --> 01:33:59,676
Get some water quickly.

660
01:34:15,626 --> 01:34:17,685
- Uncle Wong!
- Dwarka!

661
01:34:19,664 --> 01:34:21,689
Where is Chinlan?

662
01:34:22,733 --> 01:34:24,701
What's it, uncle?

663
01:34:24,802 --> 01:34:27,703
You've been blessed
with a tiny doctor.

664
01:34:27,805 --> 01:34:28,703
Really?!

665
01:34:31,142 --> 01:34:33,975
- Where is she?
- Right there in her cave.

666
01:35:04,108 --> 01:35:09,068
I don't believe it that I'm
here alive in front of you.

667
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,750
Look... Look at the child.

668
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:21,758
He's just like you.

669
01:35:40,077 --> 01:35:43,069
Chin, I'll be back.

670
01:35:43,814 --> 01:35:45,782
I'll go meet everyone.

671
01:40:47,351 --> 01:40:52,084
Child, it would be advisable
to stop Dwarka from working.

672
01:40:53,123 --> 01:40:55,489
But he doesn't heed anybody.

673
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:02,094
He'll insist on working till he
continues to see injured soldiers.

674
01:41:03,133 --> 01:41:07,092
This is why I was telling
you to take him to India.

675
01:41:09,139 --> 01:41:11,505
But he doesn't heed you either.

676
01:41:12,142 --> 01:41:17,512
I'll talk to the General
once he comes back from war.

677
01:41:18,082 --> 01:41:20,107
Dwarka may heed him.

678
01:41:24,154 --> 01:41:27,123
Don't make noise.
The doctor is ill, let him sleep.

679
01:41:27,691 --> 01:41:30,626
But the General has
been badly injured.

680
01:41:34,498 --> 01:41:36,466
- What should we do?
- We have to save him.

681
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:38,601
We'll be ruined without him.

682
01:41:42,573 --> 01:41:45,542
What are you doing?
Where do you want to go?

683
01:41:46,176 --> 01:41:49,543
Didn't you hear them say
that the General has been injured.

684
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:51,943
He needs me.

685
01:41:52,182 --> 01:41:55,151
But think about
your health, Dwarka.

686
01:41:56,186 --> 01:41:58,154
Then who will treat the General?

687
01:41:58,255 --> 01:42:00,951
Is there any other
doctor here besides me?

688
01:42:03,327 --> 01:42:06,023
You don't expect me not to
save such a big man's life...

689
01:42:06,196 --> 01:42:08,426
...and worry about
my life instead.

690
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:11,164
Not at this moment.

691
01:42:29,219 --> 01:42:33,588
Chin, do you know how important
the General is for this country?

692
01:42:34,224 --> 01:42:37,591
China's victory and freedom...

693
01:42:39,296 --> 01:42:42,390
Get ready for the operation.

694
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,538
Doctor, he's got
three bullet marks.

695
01:42:52,643 --> 01:42:55,203
Two in the left arm
and one deep in the chest.

696
01:46:23,553 --> 01:46:26,420
The operation was successful.
The General is saved.

697
01:46:28,458 --> 01:46:31,427
The operation was successful.
The General is saved.

698
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:53,116
Soap.

699
01:46:55,485 --> 01:46:57,453
Wash your hands, Dwarka.

700
01:46:59,489 --> 01:47:02,458
Chin, do you remember that day?

701
01:47:03,493 --> 01:47:10,456
After the operation at
the hospital, just this way...

702
01:47:12,502 --> 01:47:15,471
...you and I...

703
01:47:17,507 --> 01:47:18,474
Uncle!

704
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:49,504
What an unfortunate day!

705
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:54,306
Dwarka is not well.

706
01:47:54,544 --> 01:47:57,513
And there is bad
news from India.

707
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:03,781
- What is it, uncle?
- Nothing.

708
01:48:04,554 --> 01:48:07,318
You were talking
about India, right?

709
01:48:07,924 --> 01:48:11,519
Yes. The Japanese have
attacked India as well.

710
01:48:15,565 --> 01:48:19,126
If only I was in India today.

711
01:48:23,974 --> 01:48:28,536
Uncle, can I go to India?

712
01:48:32,649 --> 01:48:33,946
Sure, my son.

713
01:48:35,585 --> 01:48:39,544
But would I be
unfaithful to China...

714
01:48:39,656 --> 01:48:43,956
...if I go away leaving China
in these tough moments.

715
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:49,555
No. In fact we would want you
to go and help your nation.

716
01:48:51,802 --> 01:48:52,826
All right.

717
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:02,040
There's one more
thing that I want to ask.

718
01:49:07,684 --> 01:49:11,586
Will Chin come with me?

719
01:49:12,622 --> 01:49:17,389
Won't she be sad
to leave her country?

720
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:20,591
She is your wife after all.

721
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:24,327
Now your country is
her country as well.

722
01:49:25,836 --> 01:49:28,270
Then we shall surely go to India.

723
01:49:32,642 --> 01:49:35,008
Can the arrangements
for the journey be made?

724
01:49:35,645 --> 01:49:38,614
Yes, of course. I'll make
the arrangements right away.

725
01:49:49,659 --> 01:49:51,627
We shall go to India!

726
01:49:51,728 --> 01:49:54,026
We shall go to India!

727
01:50:15,685 --> 01:50:18,051
- What happened?
- Call Uncle Wong? Hurry.

728
01:50:18,154 --> 01:50:20,122
The doctor's
condition is worsening.

729
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:23,659
Chin, where is our son?

730
01:50:27,697 --> 01:50:29,062
Look at him.

731
01:50:30,834 --> 01:50:31,801
Sit.

732
01:50:33,837 --> 01:50:35,668
Come here.

733
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,673
I can see both of you from here.

734
01:50:45,115 --> 01:50:47,083
- Chin!
- Yes?

735
01:50:49,719 --> 01:50:52,279
Why are you crying?

736
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:55,883
No, I'm not.

737
01:50:56,126 --> 01:51:00,426
Now you ought to be happy.

738
01:51:01,731 --> 01:51:04,495
We are going to India.

739
01:51:05,735 --> 01:51:08,226
We are going to India.

740
01:51:09,739 --> 01:51:14,176
Chin, we are going to India.

741
01:51:15,745 --> 01:51:22,173
Look at those lofty mountains...

742
01:51:23,753 --> 01:51:25,721
The swirling streams...

743
01:51:26,756 --> 01:51:28,724
The lush green fields...

744
01:51:29,426 --> 01:51:31,519
The small villages...

745
01:51:31,761 --> 01:51:34,286
Just like your China.

746
01:51:35,966 --> 01:51:39,732
And look,
this is our village.

747
01:51:41,171 --> 01:51:43,139
The train has stopped.

748
01:51:43,773 --> 01:51:46,333
Take care while getting
off with the child.

749
01:51:47,777 --> 01:51:52,146
This is your first step on
the land of your new country.

750
01:51:53,783 --> 01:51:58,743
Look. That is
our station master.

751
01:52:00,457 --> 01:52:02,425
He has the same assistant.

752
01:52:03,793 --> 01:52:05,761
The same old porter Ramu.

753
01:52:06,796 --> 01:52:09,765
All these people
are my old friends.

754
01:52:11,401 --> 01:52:13,767
They know me since my childhood.

755
01:52:14,804 --> 01:52:19,207
And this is our Bhondu.

756
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:22,776
The same old carriage.

757
01:52:23,813 --> 01:52:25,781
And the same old horse.

758
01:52:26,016 --> 01:52:28,177
He will take us home.

759
01:52:29,819 --> 01:52:34,051
Hurry, Bhondu.
Take us home soon.

760
01:52:34,824 --> 01:52:39,591
Mother must be at the door
with the lamp in her hands.

761
01:52:41,631 --> 01:52:45,795
Chinlan, this
is your new home.

762
01:52:46,836 --> 01:52:50,602
Don't worry.
Come in.

763
01:52:51,841 --> 01:52:56,801
Mother... Mother, we are back!

764
01:52:58,848 --> 01:53:01,214
She is your daughter-in-law.

765
01:53:02,852 --> 01:53:04,820
And he is our little son.

766
01:53:07,724 --> 01:53:09,817
We are back home.

767
01:53:11,261 --> 01:53:13,229
We are back home.

768
01:54:09,786 --> 01:54:11,879
I wish he had lived...

769
01:54:12,922 --> 01:54:15,288
...and visited India
at least once.

770
01:54:15,925 --> 01:54:18,359
Dwarka is still alive.

771
01:54:18,928 --> 01:54:23,888
Noble men never die,
they become immortal.

772
01:54:32,942 --> 01:54:37,311
Chin, why are there
tears in your eyes?

773
01:54:38,348 --> 01:54:39,906
No, there are no tears.

774
01:54:40,016 --> 01:54:44,316
Now you ought to be happy.

775
01:54:45,955 --> 01:54:48,253
We are going to India.

776
01:54:49,959 --> 01:54:52,120
We are going to India.

777
01:54:53,963 --> 01:54:57,922
Look, this is our village.

778
01:54:59,569 --> 01:55:01,537
The train has stopped.

779
01:55:02,105 --> 01:55:04,471
Be careful while
getting off with the child.

780
01:55:05,975 --> 01:55:10,344
This is your first step on
the land of your new country.

781
01:55:11,981 --> 01:55:16,941
Look, he is our station master.

782
01:55:18,855 --> 01:55:20,823
His same old assistant.

783
01:55:21,991 --> 01:55:23,959
The same old porter Ramu.

784
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:27,959
All these people
are my old friends.

785
01:55:29,999 --> 01:55:33,765
And look, he is our Bhondu.

786
01:55:35,004 --> 01:55:37,370
His same old carriage.

787
01:55:38,007 --> 01:55:39,975
And the same old horse.

788
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:43,171
He will take us home.

789
01:55:45,014 --> 01:55:48,973
Bhondu, take us home soon.

790
01:55:50,019 --> 01:55:54,581
Mother must be at the door
with the lamp in her hand.

791
01:55:56,226 --> 01:56:00,595
Chinlan, this is your new home.

792
01:56:02,031 --> 01:56:05,467
Don't worry.
Come in.

793
01:56:07,036 --> 01:56:08,003
Mother!

794
01:56:09,038 --> 01:56:12,007
Mother, we are back.

795
01:56:14,177 --> 01:56:16,407
She is your daughter-in-law.

796
01:56:18,047 --> 01:56:20,413
And he is our little son.

797
01:56:21,284 --> 01:56:23,809
We are back home.

798
01:56:25,054 --> 01:56:27,352
We are back home.

799
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:32,425
My Dwarka!
