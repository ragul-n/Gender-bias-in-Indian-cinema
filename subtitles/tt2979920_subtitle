00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,367
You must be some bio shot.

179
00:30:58,466 --> 00:31:00,167
Do you want to become one?

180
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:01,633
Yup.

181
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,001
Then we must begin with
oivino you a new name..

182
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,767
JOHNNY.

183
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:13,800
Like it?

184
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:34,836
l knew you had it in you
the moment l saw you in the bank..

185
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,635
l knew you'll be of oood use.

186
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,601
l've been used oood. all my life..

187
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,167
and my mother used me the best..

188
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:44,600
What do you mean?

189
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,967
l don't remember the woman
l wa._ born to..

190
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,802
For me, the one who
picked me up from the streets..

191
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,867
and brought me to Bombay
was always my mother..

192
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,168
All my life l tried to be her son..

193
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:04,169
but she used me only as an errand boy,
._ometime to hu._tle her..

194
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,300
A coolie..

195
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,334
al._o a coolie..

196
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,801
Then she took away all my gold
and disappeared on me.

197
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,101
Evemime l wanted somethino..

198
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,368
l was told..
l am not wo_hy of it.

199
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,533
Chimman echoe_ the ._entiment..

200
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,402
That's when l decided
l've ootta chanoe my wo_h. .

201
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,534
You can use me. all you want..

202
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:28,868
But we ootta be pa_ners.

203
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,601
There i._ thi._ man l want..

204
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,767
You'll oet him..

205
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,201
but you don't oet anythino for free..

206
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,568
You don't get to play my
probono daddy..

207
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,135
nor do l wanna be
your ''Tax free'' Johnny.

208
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,200
Romi Mehta.

209
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:45,000
Mayor of Bombay.

210
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,503
He's got the hotline to the
Prime Mini._ter in Delhi.

211
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:53,237
He's more indispensable to Bombay than
the Chief Mini._ter or the Governor.

212
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:02,135
One day a tram rammed his car..

213
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,070
and that was the last time,
the trams plied in this city.

214
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,202
He has a middle man. a procurer..

215
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,134
who is a horndoo.

216
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:13,967
lf he's made to disappear..

217
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,368
Romi Mehta would need a
replacement for him.

218
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:19,869
that horndog does not take
hi._ broad._ to a love motel..

219
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:23,068
he prefers to take them
in the open.

220
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,136
Hiral will lure him to the creek.

221
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,267
Who'._ Hiral?

222
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,000
My wife.

223
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,167
Mi._._u._.

224
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:59,435
When bodies decompose..

225
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,001
they bloat up. And they float up.

226
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,002
which is why you stab the
body to puncture it.

227
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,835
Drown that horndoo into the creek.

228
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,267
Will you?

229
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,968
The other man l want to oet to..

230
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:37,967
but not dead. alive.

231
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,001
Rao Saheb De._ai.

232
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:43,603
His inteority can't be bouoht..

233
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,302
so we need to click a picture of his.

234
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,035
Bombay is called the golden bird,
not for nothino.

235
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:43,036
So much money flows here
that bank._ can't hol_ it.

236
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:46,669
We need to create a place
that can ''._ta._h the ca._h''.

237
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,668
Where whisky and women
flow and sino..

238
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,000
and we talk shop.

239
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:51,867
Business. l mean.

240
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,569
Basically, an exclusive
oentlemen's club.

241
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,869
l did not understand a word
of your Enolish!

242
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:02,533
Hey!

243
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,535
You want to be a Bio Shot?

244
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,034
l'll make you a Bio Shot.

245
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,134
My place.

246
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,000
Your name.

247
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,501
Take a good look at
these photos.

248
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,067

neoatives.

249
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,635
And you will find them somewhere
in thi._ new club.

00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:47,467

251
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,467

with you forever.

252
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:52,068
And is now Khambatta's flunky.

253
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,504
Above all my desires

254
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,769
l desire your embrace

255
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:16,070

Or i._ thi._ an illu._ion?

257
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,705
Oh. sweet enchanter!

258
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:34,309
Bewitched by your thought,
oh ._weet enchanter.

259
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:40,171

Oh. sweet enchanter.

Behind my enchanting smile,

262
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:16,674
Beneath this happy face,
i._ an uncomfo_able truth.

263
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:21,504
Oh ._weet enchanter!

264
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:10,775
Let our inflamed passion enoulf us

265
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:18,540
Let me surrender to your spell,
Oh ._weet enchanter.

266
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:30,109
The fire's burnt out. my love

267
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:38,174
Smoke i._ all what remain._ of u._

268
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:49,108
Your coldness is tormenting me,
l can't bear the sleepless niohts.

269
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:57,307
My love is for real,
not a miraoe you'd overlook.

270
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,404
Oh ._weet enchanter!

271

Oh ._weet enchanter!

275
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,101
l am not scared of you.

276
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:32,738
lf you ever leave me,
l'll hu_ you so bad..

277
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:36,669
and you'll do what eunuchs do
on the streets. Beo.

278
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:43,902
Wh_d ya love me so much?

279
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,534
You could have loved anyone.

280
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,134
l feel something when l look
into you.

281
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,801
We all feel something looking
into people.

282
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,534
Hmm..

283
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,769
You know when l see those
cabaret oirls..

Capitalist pig!

00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:41,500
CIA aoent!

291
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:42,833
KGB spy!

292
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,067
Good evening.

00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:48,700
lndian citizen. rioht?

295
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:51,201
You know you will only be se_ed
alcohol if you are..

296
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:52,967
accompanied by a foreioner.

297
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:55,834
You give me a hundred and
l oive you a white.

298
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:24,167
Back off. back off.

299
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,468
Rosie is DND,
she'll not meet anyone..

300
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,201
She's ootta sino now.

301
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,935
Come on Johnny,
l'm not askino for a kiss.

302
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:45,900
Ro._ie..

303
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,600
Par._ee man!

304
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:13,071
lf you wanna get a drink
in this city..

305
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,568
you need an alcohol permit.
It's compulsoy.

306
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,969
But when have we ever
followe_ rule._.

307
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:24,337
The last Mughal king formally
._ai_ in 1ft__7..

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,603
Briti._her._ mu._t leave In_ia..

and see they still hang around
allowino us our alcohol in 1969.

310
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:34,134
Out of the way.

311
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,835
We made a deal all those
years aoo..

312
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,435
lf Rosie ever came with me..
l'll never see your face.

313
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:44,870
So why the hell do you
show up here eveyday?

314
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,368
Fine feathers
_on't make fine bir_._.

315
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:55,935
Your language still
._mell._ of the ._treet.

316
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,670
You keep the feathers.
l'm the cock of the walk.

317
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:10,605
Ne_ time ya show up,
l'll put a dent point blank.

318
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,801
- Dear Kaizad.

319
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:25,338
l hope this finds you in good health
and the best Scotch by your side.

320
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,903
The Scotch that was brought in
from the back alley of Bombay Velvet.

321
00:44:30,866 --> 00:44:34,869
ln spite of the spectacular glitter that
enters Bombay Velvet from its orand front..

322
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,968
lt's not enough to blind me from
what really ooes on.

323
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:45,771
The powerhouses of Bombay seem
really happy in paid company and free liauor..

324
00:44:47,066 --> 00:44:50,803
trading lives of
million._ of Mill worker._..

325
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:53,869
over an evening of music
an_ chatter.

326
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:58,303
And your effo_s in adding some
much needed olitter to the rot.

327
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:04,605
PS: Putting a stitched suit on Johnny
Balrai makes him look oood but..

328
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,272
that street side local will never
become one of u._.

329
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:28,641
Hot headed hawk,
driftino by the block.

330
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:43,903
Hide it if you could,
flaunt it if you should.

331
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:48,403
This rage, my love,
ain't no oood!

332
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:03,101
Whydia stop?

333

334
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,668
Fine then..
Come out of the tub.

00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:39,068
No.. l close my eyes..
You oet in.

340
00:46:54,866 --> 00:47:03,541
No more crafty ways,
Iet'._ cut to the cha._e.

341
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:10,839
lf you're shy to say it here,
may l suooest your place.

342
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:14,803
Hot headed hawk,
driftino by the block.

343
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:21,204
Hide it if you could,
flaunt it if you should.

344
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,670
No more crafty ways,
Iet'._ cut to the cha._e.

345
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:27,635
Rosie Madam,
why not sino for the movies?

346
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:31,169
My uncle knows a vey
famous arranoer..

347
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:33,001
The biooest one.

348
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:35,268
Who arranges for the biggest of

the minister has placed the Backbay
area at the disposal of the rich.

366
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:21,802
The World Trade Center will raise its
uoly head from the mud of Back Bay. .

367
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:27,037
soaked with sweat and blood of thousands of
homeless. iobless workers.

368
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,034
- We will not allow the millworker._..

369
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,969
to take away our livelihood,
and build them._elve._ a fo_une.

370
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,469
We have built this city..
With our bloo_ an_ ._weat.

371
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:38,270
And we will not allow them their feast
while we oo hunoy.

372
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,802
They cannot shutdown the
cotton mill._..

00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:46,204
to build their ivoy towers..
It's our money..

374
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,434
To hell with it.

375
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:07,737
Johnny, what are you wearing?
You look like hired help.

376
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,167
Lo._e the bomie.

377
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:27,702
Does he know that you and Jimmy
used to hook up?

378
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:44,304
- We want our share of the profit.

379
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:48,670
We had no money for the oas..

380
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:54,204
Our cars iust stood there..

381
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,868
Unlike you..

382
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,267
We ha_ a lot to lo._e..

383
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,436
Our honour. our family name..

384
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,935
At 17, l was thrust
the responsibility..

385
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:11,736
to take care of Khambattas,
and our newspaper.

386
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,902
Jimmy and me, grew up together..
But had different iourneys.

387
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:20,770
He thinks l am an American spy,
a capitalist.

388
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:23,735
while l know how Russians
cover hi._ a._._..

389
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:25,967
while l slogged for my
newspaper to orow. .

390
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:28,601
He went and married the
handicapped dauohter. .

391
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:32,769
of a wealthy father.

392
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:36,735
Wants to topple the government with
Russian money.. Bloody socialist!

393
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,768
That mill worker._' union lea_er..

394
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,869
is his doo.

395
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,500
What's your point. boss?

396
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,001
My point is..

397
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:48,669
Bomba_s map is being
redrawn. Johnny.

398
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:51,101
Seven i._lan_._..

399
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,067
We fille_ in the creek._..

400
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:54,200
Seven became one.

401
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:56,000
Bombay.

402
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,136
And now this reclaimed land
is up for orabs.

403
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:02,603
A bio investment oppo_unity.

404
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,768
Jimmy is aoainst this development..

405
00:52:04,866 --> 00:52:06,267
But the mill owner._ are with u._.

406
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:08,301
How do we make more money?

407
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:11,001
What mu._t we _o?

408
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:20,333
Mr. Mayor.

409
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,568
Aren't we wasting the
backbay land?

410
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,602
By putting the World Trade Centre
in Nariman Point..

411
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:28,235
We're throwing away
prime prope_y!

412
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:31,902
l have the urban development
mini._ter under control..

413
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,702
l have him on camera with my wife.

414
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:36,734
Now he is playino ball.

415
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,568
l mean it's a loss of a
business oppo_unity..

416
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:39,933
look at that lan_.

417
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,537
Had me smitten and left in despair,
even in love. well. that's not fair.

418
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:53,607
Your pride will fall,
becau._e love tower._ all.

419
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:58,570
Disreoard is as you may

420
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:03,404
you'll surrender one day,
for your raoe is futile.

421
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,135
Mr. Mayor?
- Johnny Balrai.

422
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:11,671
Hide it if you could,
flaunt it if you should.

423
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:15,136
This rage, my love,
ain't no oood!

424
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,970
- Mayor needs the cigars..
And one of the oirls in the back room.

425
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:29,102
The World Trade Centre
is beino relocated.

426
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,169
and our paper did not know that..

427
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:36,469
l got it from
Khambatta's paper TORRENT..

428
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,604
The World Trade Centre that
was to come up at Nariman Point. .

429
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,771
The Committee has decided
to relocate it at Cuffe Parade.

430
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,835
- Our hunoer for land is so enormous..

431
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:09,102
that filling the creeks did not
satisfy it.. nor cuttino the iunoles..

432
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,736
and now we are asking the sea
to move back..

433
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:15,868
so you can reclaim it..
Not you mate.

434
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,869
Except the
Worl_ Tra_e Centre relocation..

435
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:29,076
Rest of the Nariman point remains
exactly as planned.

436
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,235
lf the World Trade Centre
is to oo to Cuffe Parade. .

437
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,468
What becomes of the reclaimed land
at Nariman Point?

438
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:36,234
Manhattan!

439
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,702
And who is gonna
build the Manhattan?

440
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,901
Who gets the allotment of the
hioh value land..

441
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,169
You'll find all the details
in the press release.

442
00:54:57,766 --> 00:55:00,301
Check this picture..
Recoonize the ouy?

443
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:06,437
The one we photographed
orabbino melons..

444
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,801
Didja know
he wa._ a mini._ter?

445
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:11,200
We will oet our share too.

446
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:15,368
Not if we wait for it,
we won't.

447
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,535
When a movie is sold out,
Only those find a ticket..

448
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,836
Who knows when and where to
orab the manaoer.

449
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:25,302
l still haven't got those
neoatives.

450
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,668
The Mayor forced me to
announce the _C relocation..

451
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,334
they have me playing
the oame.

452
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,934
lf you don't find the neoatives..

453
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,369
forget our dream of affordable
housino for mill workers.

454
00:55:34,466 --> 00:55:36,301
That union leader will
buy us time.

455
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:37,867
Don't wory.

456
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:41,836
They still pay us the same wages
that the British paid us..

457
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:45,536
and with the increased maroins..

458
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,235
they are gonna build a
city for the rich.

459
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,402
On our oraves..

460
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,369
On our bloo_..

461
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:58,636
We will not let them have
their Manhattan.

462
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:02,369
No homes for Zurich's gnomes.
- No homes. no homes.

463
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,002
We want our share of profit
in our han_._.

464
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:06,534
Why the Red flao?

465
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:09,068
Red is socialist.
Why not the democratic Indian flao?

466
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,135
That's Khambatta's flunky,
shoot his picture.

467
00:56:12,466 --> 00:56:14,901
When God was distributing the
''Sma_._''..

468
00:56:14,966 --> 00:56:17,735
the union leader was
standino there with a sieve.

469
00:56:18,066 --> 00:56:21,102
Poor fellow wants to be a
Mahatma like Gan_hi..

470
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:24,469
and since there are
no Enolishmen left to fioht. .

471
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:26,768
He is fighting the
Enolish-speakino men.

472
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,736
l have been watching those immigrants,
ever since l came to this city.

473
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,403
l used to wonder why the hell,
do they waste time fillino the sea.

474
00:56:35,466 --> 00:56:38,235
Now l know.
They were bakino a bi_hday cake.

475
00:56:40,866 --> 00:56:43,602
For the pa_y of the bio boys..

476
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:51,606
but the bi_hday boy can't blow
the candle._ without me.

477
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,135
As lono as l have this..

478
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:01,569
Khambatta will either give me a
piece of action..

479
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:04,601
Or kill me.

480
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,536
Keep it with you.
Keep it safe.

481
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:14,834
No.

482
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,067
What if l lo._e it?

483
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,903
Who asked you to sta_
this protest?

484
00:57:31,966 --> 00:57:33,500
My ''Principal..''

485
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,700
Who'._ he?

486
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,401
l mean Ideolooy.

487
00:57:39,566 --> 00:57:42,502
We got these biscuits
specially for you.

488
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,735
What's Backbay got to do
with your mills?

489
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,902
Backbay is the south end of Bombay and
your mills are far away in the centre.

490
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,101
l _on't ._ee the connection.

491
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,669
You think l don't know
whose money is beino used..

492
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:58,002
to build those buildinos.

493
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:00,401
All the mill owners
are puttino in tenders.

494
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,702
They say they don't have money
to pay our salaries..

495
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,468
but they have it to make
the skyscraper.

496
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,002
What's your ideology wo_h?
Name your price.

497
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:12,734
Eveyone has a price.

498
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:16,302
l charge Rs.1000 for an
hour in cou_.

499
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,501
l've left a hearing
to be here.

500
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,135
Tell me your price.

501
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:30,135
Sory to waste your 15 minutes..

502
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:34,036
and your 250 rupees tea.

503
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,268
Hello Ro._ie..

504
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,268
First time l paid a bribe today..

505
00:58:47,766 --> 00:58:49,968
iust to find your phone number.

506
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:52,101
l tried callino you..

507
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,101
At your sea-front house.
But..

508
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,934
What were you ooino to tell me?

509
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,002
That you found nothing?
Or that you'll tell me nothino?

510
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:05,303
You were sent there
to find those neoatives. .

511
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,467
l ._ometime._ won_er..

512
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:09,368
Why don't l just tell your Romeo..
Who you really are..

513
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:14,702
This city will go to the dogs, Rosie,
if we don't find those neoatives.

514
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:18,269
You are the star of Bombay Velvet
because l made you one.

515
00:59:18,366 --> 00:59:23,871
My paper talked you up, talked
up your Romeo's sordid speakeasy.

516
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,602

My forger can make
one for me easily.

546
01:01:20,766 --> 01:01:22,334
Builders put up buildinos..

547
01:01:22,366 --> 01:01:23,400
That's what they do.

548
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:25,601
They mix sand with cement.

549
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,336
The mayor brings in the politics..
While the mill owners put up the money.

550
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,202
What have you got to offer,
Johnny?

01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:37,901
You are the bio boys here sir..

ln two days, the millworkers
will staoe a huoe protest rally.

01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:03,135
lf that rally happens,
there will be no more Manhattan.

01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:06,035
The union leader has to oo..

559
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:07,434
make him disappear.

560
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:11,770
Then this whole movement will flounder
like a headle._._ chicken and die out.

561
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:40,203
Union leader will buy us time?
What'._ thi._ now?

562
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:49,267
He'._ uncon._ciou._.

563

l think you are losino your mind.

628
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,935
You and Khambatta both can't blackmail
the minister over the same pictures.

629
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,934
Why not?

630
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,935
l can not let Khambatta mock my English
and not pay me. what's owed to me..

631
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,368
l gotta teach him my
Ianouaoe now.

632
01:07:43,433 --> 01:07:46,769
Teach him whatever the
hell you want to.

633

But know that
he won't take it lyino down.

634
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,134
So what ._houl_ l _o?

635
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,934
The only way l know..

636
01:07:51,966 --> 01:07:53,934
is you want something,
you kill for it.

637
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,267
Who are you ooino to kill?

638
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:56,300
De._ai?

639
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,802
He's a minister and

We do the disposino for him.

647

When we were hoods on the street,

653
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:46,836
He has given us too much,

654
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,169
Let's not be greedier than that
and ruin it.

01:08:50,233 --> 01:08:52,368
l don't want this bloody
Bombay Velvet.

01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,701
You can keep it.

We launder all the di_y money
of the city from here for them.

658
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,035
We se_e them alcohol beyond the
permissible limit.

659
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:02,501
We let them take our _ancer._ home.

660

When shit hits the fan..
It will be us who will oo down.

You didn't say a word when
l killed that two-bit photoorapher..

01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:27,335
You got rid of the body

You preferred me when l bought

You prefer me
not askino auestions..

845
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:39,201
You preferred me
when l was your toy..

846
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,167
No wonder you married
a cripple.

847
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:49,468
The Johnny you call a street hood..

01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:53,403

You have no idea what will be

851
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,136
Does he know he isn't the
first man you slept with?

Does he know that

Do you know you aren't

lf you're infected,
you're on your own!

01:21:49,766 --> 01:21:55,104
Love is a deadly plaoue!

856

For those infected,
nothino cures better than liauor.

857
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:20,906
When god isn't holy enough,
the love_s picture on the wall is.

858
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:25,070
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.

859
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:37,403
Love is a deadly plaoue!

860
01:22:44,866 --> 01:22:46,567

01:23:48,866 --> 01:23:52,436
He sent her to you for the
ministe_s photo.

867
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:03,004
Alive, Rosie is dangerous.
To all of u._.

01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,435
No one touche._ Ro._ie.

869
01:24:11,966 --> 01:24:15,936
She must be the one who told Jimmy
about our CCl meetino.

870
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:20,135
lf ._he ha._ to _ie..

01:26:08,266 --> 01:26:10,835
No one loved me the way

881
01:26:14,066 --> 01:26:19,271
Where are you?
Shall l come up to your cabin?

882
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:12,071
Nothino cures

883
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:16,603
No prayer helps!

884
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:24,470
My achino hea_ explodes

885
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,571
My aching hea_ explodes

My aching hea_ echoes
Dha_am! Dha_am!

01:27:40,433 --> 01:27:44,737
This insufferable pain!

889
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:47,109
l had so much to say,
the aoony l lived this far.

890
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:57,843
But you shut me up,
held me captive in a vow.

891
01:28:57,933 --> 01:29:02,971
And now you're sore

892
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:08,872
That l betrayed you?

893

894
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,604
My aching hea_ explodes

895
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:29,971
This insufferable pain!

01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:59,440
You turned away,
broke me in ._hard._.

897
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,135
How inseparable were we

898
01:30:02,233 --> 01:30:09,540

01:30:10,066 --> 01:30:12,535

My hea_'s a lonely dese_,

901
01:30:25,066 --> 01:30:29,136
Let the rain pound
Dhadam! Dhadam!

01:30:30,066 --> 01:30:33,602
Wandering hopelessly
Dhadam! Dhadam!

903
01:30:33,966 --> 01:30:35,400
Where's the Maior?

904
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,335
How do l care?
He took his baos and left.

905
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,600
Come with me.

906
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,868

Relentless echo

01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:16,670
Like beino on a death row

910

My aching hea_
Dha_am! Dha_am!

911

Dha_am! Dha_am!

914
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:49,272
This insufferable pain!

915
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:18,436
Rosie Noronha.
She used to sino in Bombay Velvet.

916
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,535
A twisted bunch. this lot.

917
01:32:28,733 --> 01:32:30,401
Banoles. Sir.

918
01:32:32,033 --> 01:32:33,467
They were found on the body.

919
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,135
- Why bomb the whole place?
Ju._t to kill Ro._ie?

920
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,001
A bullet woul_ have _one it.

921
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,000
Get out.

922
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,601
Go write your piece.

923
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,601
And take that away.

924
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,968
The one truth
l can vouch for i._..

925
01:33:02,033 --> 01:33:05,136
They were madly in love..

926
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:07,968
Ju._t like Romeo-Juliet.

927
01:33:08,533 --> 01:33:10,468
You know what l
actually think?

928
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:15,236
Maybe the_ve had a nasty
Iove_._ brawl.

929
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:17,834
Maybe?
Or did they?

930
01:33:18,699 --> 01:33:20,134
But l am sure of one thino..

931
01:33:22,433 --> 01:33:25,102
Now tell the stoy.
The real one.

932
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,969
Sir, Rosie was vey drunk
that nioht.

933
01:33:28,066 --> 01:33:30,701
She just couldn't stop weeping,
all throuoh the way.

934
01:33:30,766 --> 01:33:33,401
l said: Let me help you to the door
but she oot anoy.

935
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,401
Tell you the truth?

936
01:33:35,466 --> 01:33:39,136
l loved her,
with all my hea_.

937
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:41,835
But Johnny was her world.

938
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,235
She got really mad
that day.

939
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,101
l said: let me walk you
to the door..

940
01:33:47,233 --> 01:33:49,535
l asked you to leave,
didn't l?

941
01:33:51,066 --> 01:33:52,734
My hea_ broke that day.

942
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:57,971
Rosie, Madame, l can't bear it
when l see you cy...

943
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,069
l know you love Johnny.

944
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:10,801
But l am iust a chauffeur..

945
01:34:11,366 --> 01:34:14,335
Tony. ''The chauffeuf'.

946
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:19,769
- Someone strangled her before
that bomb exploded.

947
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:24,270
- The body didn't blow up 'cos the heavy
synthetic dress melted over her body.

948
01:34:24,633 --> 01:34:27,902
- Even if she had su_ived the explosion,
she would have died in 2 years.

949
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,601
- She ha_ Gonorrhoea.

950
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:35,602
Do we have anything that can
prove this mioht not be Rosie?

951
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:36,767
No. sir.

952
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:39,901
Okay.
Sion the papers.

953
01:34:41,466 --> 01:34:43,067
And hand over the body
to the family.

954
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:22,069
Madame Rosie?
- That'._ her ._i._ter.

955
01:35:34,233 --> 01:35:36,068
Johnny!

956
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:41,434
Leave the drink.
Get chanoed!

957
01:35:42,266 --> 01:35:43,834
l didn't betray you. Johnny.

958
01:35:43,933 --> 01:35:45,934
Rosie, if you want to live,
do as l say!

959
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,468
Take off your clothes now.

960
01:35:47,766 --> 01:35:49,767
Chanoe into my clothes.

961
01:35:52,233 --> 01:35:54,268
Johnny..

962
01:35:54,566 --> 01:35:55,900
What's ooino on?

963
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,736
No!
- Ro._ie there'._ a bomb in the hou._e.

964
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:07,835
We can exit from the door.
- Rosie. iump!

965
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:18,400
Who was that oirl?

966
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,134
That was Rosie.
An_ ._he'._ _ea_.

967
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:21,200
But l'm alive. Johnny.

968
01:36:21,266 --> 01:36:22,700
No.
Ro._ie i._ not alive.

969
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:24,234
Ro._ie i._ _ea_.

970
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:26,368
You are dead and
you have to stay dead!

971
01:36:26,466 --> 01:36:27,200
Got that?

972
01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:29,034
Now shut up and
Iet me think.

973
01:36:30,866 --> 01:36:32,567

974
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:34,667
Stop cyino.

975
01:36:34,866 --> 01:36:36,867
Or l'll break the
other one too.

976
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,035
This is all your bloody fault.

977
01:36:40,233 --> 01:36:41,467
Hol_ thi._.

978
01:36:42,566 --> 01:36:44,134

01:36:46,366 --> 01:36:47,934
Why didn't you tell me?

980
01:36:48,233 --> 01:36:49,200
You coul_ have ._hown it to me.

981
01:36:49,233 --> 01:36:51,668
That damn photographer

982
01:36:52,066 --> 01:36:53,734
My mind ran wild..

983
01:36:54,066 --> 01:36:56,201
What was in it?
What the hell did he do to you?

984
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,468
You kille_ him..

985

Not me.

986
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,434
You think l couldn't digest
a thino like this.

987
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,702
l can never tell
what can oet you worked up.

988
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,435
You don't work like a clock
tick tock tick tock.

989
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,201
l am the one who's angy

Actually, l didn't know

l was vey young
when she ran away from home.

01:38:12,433 --> 01:38:15,002
That'._ Ro._ie. Thi._ i._ me.

Would you write down your
address in Bombay?

You shouldnNgt have trained my
finoers to fiddle with a oun.

1023
01:39:07,633 --> 01:39:08,867
Stop the car.

1024

Look!

You've shown him my face,
You i_iot.

1028
01:39:28,933 --> 01:39:32,870
When you guys sta_ rattling off

01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:34,634
He has seen my face!

Misty will splash him
over his paoes..

1034
01:39:48,933 --> 01:39:51,435

Whenever you let me.

1043
01:40:25,633 --> 01:40:27,167
Are you a sinoer as well?

1044
01:40:27,933 --> 01:40:30,035
Don't touch them.
- Which sinoer do you like?

1045
01:40:30,133 --> 01:40:31,267
Geeta Dutt.

1046
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:34,268
l wonder what you said..
l wonder what l heard.

1047
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,100

1049
01:41:14,633 --> 01:41:16,501
You mean Ro._ie _i_n't?

01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,602
Yes, it can be Rosie's.

1051
01:41:20,666 --> 01:41:23,402

Give me a moment.
l'll be with you soon.

1056
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:43,069
Khambatta, you're letting this
petty ooon oo too far..

1057
01:41:43,133 --> 01:41:45,235
No one is indispensable.

1058
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,369
l want this Johnny Balraj
out of this city.

1059
01:41:48,433 --> 01:41:51,369
Nowhere clo._e to me.

1060
01:41:51,433 --> 01:41:52,667
Januay 1st..

1061
01:41:52,933 --> 01:41:56,403
We lay the foundation
._tone of the World Trade Centre.

1062
01:41:56,899 --> 01:42:03,139
lf your boneheaded Johnny, messes
it up even a li'l bit..

1063
01:42:03,733 --> 01:42:05,734
if he ruins our plans..

1064
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:08,168
l will ruin you.

1065
01:42:08,233 --> 01:42:12,737
l will personally supe_ise
the end of you. Kaizad.

1066
01:42:13,066 --> 01:42:14,434
Who the hell is he,
anynray?

1067
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:17,402
And why would you
Iet him keep the neoatives?

1068
01:42:17,666 --> 01:42:20,702
For God's sake!
We pay him for his se_ices.

1069
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,402
This bloody flunky
aspires to be a pa_ner!

1070
01:42:27,666 --> 01:42:31,002
l don't care
how you do it. Commissioner.

1071
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:34,703
But l want this
Johnny Balrai nuisance..

1072
01:42:35,133 --> 01:42:36,734
Out of the way.

1073
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:42,066
What happened?

1074
01:42:42,233 --> 01:42:44,068
Your boss is here.
- Balrai?

1075
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:46,568
He's too big a man
to be here.

1076
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:48,000
lt'._ the Bo._._.

1077
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,300
Chimman,
where are you from?

1078
01:42:54,733 --> 01:42:57,569
Where were you before
you moved to Bombay?

1079
01:42:58,699 --> 01:43:00,234
l come from Multan. Sir.

1080
01:43:00,866 --> 01:43:02,200
And Johnny?

1081
01:43:02,866 --> 01:43:04,167
Sialkot.

1082
01:43:05,733 --> 01:43:07,668
Why did you come
to Bombay?

1083
01:43:07,866 --> 01:43:09,434
Why not Delhi?

1084
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:13,436
Trains enroute Delhi had
rioters killino eveyone.

1085
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,435
My folks sent me here
with some people.

1086
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:19,670
Muslims wanted their own county
._o we had to leave.

1087
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:28,635
Pa_ition didn't happen..

1088
01:43:28,733 --> 01:43:31,802
because the Muslims wanted
their Paki._tan.

1089
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:35,503
lt happened because Mr.Jinnah
wanted to rule.

1090
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:38,001
lf India had remained
one nation...

1091
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,802
he would never have become
Pre._ident or Prime Mini._ter.

1092
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,802
He did what he did. for himself.

1093
01:43:45,066 --> 01:43:48,669
Evey man for himself.

1094
01:43:52,433 --> 01:43:54,268
Now Johnny wants to build.

1095
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:56,601
Johnny Balrai Towers.

1096
01:43:56,666 --> 01:44:00,169
Not.. Johnny-Chimman Towers.

1097
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:06,202
When l met the two of you..

1098
01:44:06,266 --> 01:44:07,900
you were friends.

1099
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,536
Today, he's the boss
and you're the flunky.

1100
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,034
What are you doing,
Chimman?

1101
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,600
Why are you in it?

1102
01:44:15,699 --> 01:44:17,435
Who are you doino it for?

1103
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:27,603
Someday, l'm going to
bomb this Jap's head.

1104
01:44:29,899 --> 01:44:31,167
Hey pa_ner..

1105
01:44:31,366 --> 01:44:33,267
This isn't enough dough
even for half a meal.

1106
01:44:33,366 --> 01:44:34,934
l oave you what l oot.

1107
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:37,868
Now. don't push it.

01:44:47,566 --> 01:44:49,301
Where did that go?
- Spent it.

1112
01:44:49,733 --> 01:44:51,801
My expenses have shot up...

1113
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:55,236
And fo_unately l know
my wo_h now.

1114
01:44:56,566 --> 01:44:57,533

back ._eat.

1117
01:45:02,233 --> 01:45:05,235
l saw your pad buddy, you are rich
and l ._houldn't have known that.

1118
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:06,400
That wasn't my pad.

1119
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,201
The dame was yours.

1120
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,869
You need big money
to keep a dame like that.

1121
01:45:12,733 --> 01:45:14,034
Look at thi._ car.

1122
01:45:14,133 --> 01:45:16,001
A baby like this...

1123
01:46:06,633 --> 01:46:08,167

Never.

1136
01:46:52,066 --> 01:46:54,101
You're Rita.
You're not Ro._ie.

1137
01:46:54,666 --> 01:46:56,601
Let me mourn Rosie
for a month In style!

1138
01:46:57,766 --> 01:47:00,168
And then l will
romance Rita orandly.

1139
01:47:00,933 --> 01:47:02,134
The world will say..

1140
01:47:02,233 --> 01:47:03,300
Bio shot!

1141
01:47:05,966 --> 01:47:07,267
No.

1142
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:08,701
They'll say: Look..

How much he loved
hi._ Ro._ie?

1144
01:47:11,966 --> 01:47:13,367
He even marrie_ her ._i._ter..

1145
01:47:13,466 --> 01:47:14,600
because he couldn't accept
her death.

1146
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:16,601
Then we're oood.

1147
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:20,002
Our love stoy will be epic.

01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:22,368
And life. a smash hit.

1149
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,734
Rita Ma_ame

For those infected,
nothino cures better than liauor.

1156
01:48:01,366 --> 01:48:08,339
When god isn't holy enough,
the love_s picture on the wall is.

1157
01:48:08,433 --> 01:48:12,003
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.

1158
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,603
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.

1159
01:48:21,033 --> 01:48:24,936
Love is a deadly plaoue!

That's a oood hobby.

1167
01:48:59,433 --> 01:49:01,268
Did you have similar fights
with Ro._ie?

1168
01:49:02,466 --> 01:49:04,267
You fight with your wife,

l just keep shut.
Not a wor_ ._ai_.

1172
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:15,101
How long have you been away
from home?

1173
01:49:19,433 --> 01:49:21,868
Let's cut the chase
l won't min_.

1174
01:49:21,933 --> 01:49:24,335
Why did you fight
with Ro._ie?

1175
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:27,468
Do you know Jimmy Misty?

1176
01:49:28,233 --> 01:49:30,068
He recomen_e_ Ro._ie to me.

1177
01:49:30,133 --> 01:49:31,701
Said she's an amazino sinoer.

1178

Then l found out
._he wa._ hi._ mole.

1179
01:49:35,866 --> 01:49:38,868
He wanted to dig out evey
detail on Mr. Khambatta.

1180
01:49:40,466 --> 01:49:43,902
Rosie was here as Jimm_s spy
for Khambatta..

1181
01:49:44,566 --> 01:49:46,701
So why fioht with Rosie?

1182
01:49:47,933 --> 01:49:49,034
Fir._t of all..

1183
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:52,035
Mr. Khambatta's been like a
father to me.

1184
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,568
l respect him a lot.

1185
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:55,067
An_ ._econ_ of all..

in a while.

1192
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:15,767
Get this gentleman's car.
- Not that..

1193
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:18,268
Ever oet an itch in your privates?

1194
01:50:18,899 --> 01:50:19,867
What?

1195
01:50:19,933 --> 01:50:22,368
With the kind of relationship
you had with Rosie..

1196
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:24,235
l thought you might have
contracte_ her _i._ea._e.

1197
01:50:24,766 --> 01:50:26,033
She ha_ Gonorrhoea.

1198
01:50:29,533 --> 01:50:32,102
Listen, Sir, it wasn't like that
between Ro._ie an_ me.

1199
01:50:32,966 --> 01:50:35,034
l loved her and it was pure.

1200
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:42,734
Good for you.

1201
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,501
Where did you bump the car?

1202
01:51:07,699 --> 01:51:08,333
Car?

1203
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:10,001
The bumpe_s ripped off.

1204
01:51:11,133 --> 01:51:14,336
Major was gettin' too big
for hi._ boot._.

1205
01:51:14,633 --> 01:51:16,501
Had to dump him in
the creek.

1206
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:18,300
Want one?

1207
01:51:18,966 --> 01:51:20,334
And why was he getting
too bio for his boots?

1208
01:51:20,366 --> 01:51:23,168
Did he also know
you faked Rosie's death?

1209
01:51:24,133 --> 01:51:25,133
What crap?

1210
01:51:25,366 --> 01:51:27,034
l'm not a rookie anymore,
Balrai.

1211
01:51:27,133 --> 01:51:28,767
Rita is not Rita,
Rita i._ Ro._ie.

1212
01:51:29,033 --> 01:51:30,067
She'._ Ro._ie'._ ._i._ter.

1213
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:31,467
Yeah. rioht.

1214
01:51:31,533 --> 01:51:33,268
With the ._ame face.

1215
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,368
With the same mole in the same place
with the ._ame voice.

1216
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:36,868
Twins are like that.
Look the ._ame.

1217
01:51:36,966 --> 01:51:39,501
Don't bullshit me Balraj.
Life is not Double Indemnity.

1218
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:41,967
l've seen Rosie's
childhood pictures.

1219
01:51:42,266 --> 01:51:43,700
Her sister looks
nothino like her.

1220
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,368
lf someone tells you..

1221
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:47,335
Kill Johnny..

1222
01:51:47,766 --> 01:51:48,867
Will you kill me?

1223
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,468
lf l get something
out of it.

1224
01:51:50,533 --> 01:51:51,800
Hey!
- Why not?

1225
01:51:51,866 --> 01:51:53,467
You tell me nothino.

1226
01:51:53,533 --> 01:51:55,301
What you do,

1227
01:51:55,366 --> 01:51:56,600
An_ what am l?

1228
01:51:56,666 --> 01:51:58,034
You're Khambatta's se_ant.

1229
01:51:58,133 --> 01:51:59,334
Don't talk crap.

1230
01:51:59,366 --> 01:52:01,801
Look at your life.
An_ look at mine.

1231
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:03,634
Don't you see a difference?

1232
01:52:03,733 --> 01:52:05,901
You got into the car with Rosie
and off you went.

1233
01:52:05,966 --> 01:52:07,967
Ever cared to turn around
and ._ee if l wa._ there?

1234
01:52:08,733 --> 01:52:10,468
l am still standing at the
same damn place.

1235
01:52:10,566 --> 01:52:13,335
Watchino you sniff around Rosie.

1236
01:52:22,233 --> 01:52:24,301
Hey Chimman..

01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:45,301
Mr. Khambatta.

1243
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,702
You didn't earn my loyalty..

1244
01:52:49,233 --> 01:52:50,300
You bouoht it.

1245
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:54,736
Purchased items come with a
5 year ouarantee.

Awaits you in olitterino oloy

1261

But at the _oor

1262
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:44,870
The ouard stands armed

1263
01:59:02,966 --> 01:59:05,268
He had to leave in a hury.
There was a problem.

1264
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,601
l ._ai_ l'll han_le it but..

1265
01:59:09,233 --> 01:59:11,168
He went in._tea_.

1266
01:59:11,966 --> 01:59:13,367
l don't know why.

1267
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:16,534
He said he'd write to you.

1268
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:19,834
He should be back in a
year or so..

1269
01:59:34,533 --> 01:59:36,768
Take your money and
oet out.

1270
01:59:38,133 --> 01:59:41,302
Chimman has set me up for life.

1271
01:59:41,366 --> 01:59:42,333
You oet out.

1272
01:59:44,333 --> 01:59:45,834
He's not oone away..

1273
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:48,600
lt's iust that..

1274
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,534
He told me yesterday..

1275
01:59:56,933 --> 01:59:59,435
lf l _on't come back home..

1276
02:00:00,766 --> 02:00:02,067
Balrai will be here.

1277
02:00:05,133 --> 02:00:06,968
And if Balrai is here

1278
02:00:09,333 --> 02:00:11,134
Take your money and leave.

1279
02:00:12,533 --> 02:00:15,335
You owe him your life.

1280
02:00:16,533 --> 02:00:17,834
Leave!

1281
02:00:17,866 --> 02:00:21,669
A han_ful of fi._h

1282
02:00:22,133 --> 02:00:26,136
An ocean full of ._hark._

1283
02:00:26,233 --> 02:00:29,836
An_ that'._ the rule

1284
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:34,070
ln this market. that is life

1285
02:00:35,366 --> 02:00:36,767
Ro._ie..

02:00:38,133 --> 02:00:39,467
Chimman'._ _ea_.

1287
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:44,602
Khambatta had sent him
to kill me.

1288
02:00:46,166 --> 02:00:47,267
But Chimman..

1289
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,501
lt's all oone haynrire

1290
02:01:21,899 --> 02:01:27,472
But at the door,
the ouard stands armed.

1291
02:01:41,166 --> 02:01:41,900
Hello?

1292
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,534
Comrade Deshpande is alive.

1293
02:01:44,466 --> 02:01:45,700
Excu._e me.

1294
02:01:45,766 --> 02:01:48,935
lt means his lungs still
pump oyoen.

1295
02:01:50,766 --> 02:01:52,701
He eats. He pees.

1296
02:01:52,766 --> 02:01:53,733
He craps.

1297
02:01:54,033 --> 02:01:56,201
Take some soap and shampoo
if you want to meet him.

1298
02:01:56,666 --> 02:01:57,600
Who's speakino?

1299
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:05,340
You're the kino of the streets

1300
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:13,141
Streets is where you will remain

1301
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:22,040
They won't let you in the mansion

1302
02:02:22,133 --> 02:02:29,874
lt's meant for the privileoed only

1303
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,368
Comrade Deshpande..

1304
02:02:57,133 --> 02:02:58,801
Kaiza_..

1305
02:02:59,166 --> 02:03:01,868
l don't think l can trust
you anymore.

1306
02:03:02,166 --> 02:03:05,602
The Police, the Press
l'll han_le them all.

1307
02:03:05,633 --> 02:03:07,968
You iust take care of Johnny.

1308
02:03:08,333 --> 02:03:13,805
And yes, pray that Deshpande doesn't
reoain consciousness ever.

1309
02:03:16,766 --> 02:03:18,300
So who was the woman who
died in the explosion?

1310
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:19,634
Some prostitute.

1311
02:03:19,899 --> 02:03:23,737
Her pimp Major was found
dead in the creek.

1312
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:26,135
He used to be in the Army.
Bomb expe_.

1313
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:30,135
Chimman Chopra's house has been
Iocked up for days.

1314
02:03:30,233 --> 02:03:32,768
The neighbours said they saw
hi._ wife leave alone.

1315
02:03:33,066 --> 02:03:34,300
With some luooaoe.

1316
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:37,635
Find Rosie.
You will find Johnny.

1317
02:03:38,333 --> 02:03:42,470
Rosie was put up at the YWCA but she's
been missino for the last 3 days.

1318
02:03:43,333 --> 02:03:44,534
l _on't care.

1319
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:46,535
Put his pictures in the papers..

1320
02:03:46,633 --> 02:03:48,101
Do whatever you have to do..

1321
02:03:48,566 --> 02:03:50,534
Frame him for kidnappino union leader.

1322
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,867
He's a fuoitive.

1323
02:03:53,033 --> 02:03:55,034
How lono will we be stuck here?

1324
02:03:55,633 --> 02:03:58,035
They got what they wanted
from you.

1325
02:03:58,633 --> 02:04:00,401
Now they want to kill you.

1326
02:04:00,466 --> 02:04:01,767
What's Tony doino' here?

1327
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:07,237
Look, you can't run the club,
can't show your face anynrhere.

1328
02:04:07,333 --> 02:04:08,367
Nor can l sino.

1329
02:04:08,466 --> 02:04:10,367
And the_re not going to
oive you your share either.

1330
02:04:10,866 --> 02:04:11,900
Tony? Wh_s he here?

1331
02:04:12,333 --> 02:04:13,500
You came with him?

1332
02:04:13,966 --> 02:04:16,802
How do l know what Ton_s up to?
He works for you. not me.

1333
02:04:17,033 --> 02:04:18,801
Are you even listening to me?
l'm tellino you..

1334
02:04:18,866 --> 02:04:21,969
They killed Chimman and

l'm not going anynrhere. Not until
l've ._ettle_ ._core._ with Khambatta.

1336
02:04:25,333 --> 02:04:28,169
l worked my butt off for him
and now he won't pay?

1337
02:04:29,033 --> 02:04:31,535
He picked you off the streets and
made you the manaoer of Bombay Velvet.

1338
02:04:31,566 --> 02:04:33,000
That wasn't the payment?

1339
02:04:33,466 --> 02:04:35,167
l get to decide what
my wo_h is.

1340
02:04:35,566 --> 02:04:37,167
We ha_ a _eal..

1341
02:04:37,233 --> 02:04:38,601
But he reneoed on it.

1342
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:40,800
lf he hadn't reneoed..

1343
02:04:40,866 --> 02:04:42,267
l wouldn't have
Chimman'._ death on me.

1344
02:04:45,666 --> 02:04:46,666
Look here.

1345
02:04:48,466 --> 02:04:49,466
Let it oo.

1346
02:04:50,366 --> 02:04:52,000
How does it matter anymore?

1347
02:04:53,333 --> 02:04:55,034
You and me
Let's oet out of here.

1348
02:04:55,266 --> 02:04:56,467
We'll oet married.

1349
02:04:57,066 --> 02:05:00,836
And l will love you so much that no
Khambatta would ever matter.

1350
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:06,768
That's not possible. Rosie.

1351
02:05:07,133 --> 02:05:10,302
l am unable to sleep
thinkino of his betrayal.

1352
02:05:11,133 --> 02:05:13,602
You used to call me your
world-famous Rosie. rioht?

1353
02:05:14,766 --> 02:05:16,634
Look how
Rosie is sittino here. .

1354
02:05:16,733 --> 02:05:18,501
Scared to death,
._cared into ._ilence.

1355
02:05:19,766 --> 02:05:21,834
Only because l love you.

1356
02:05:23,133 --> 02:05:25,301
l gave up my dream of
sinoino for you.

1357
02:05:25,633 --> 02:05:27,668
Can't you let go of
Khambatta for me?

1358
02:05:27,766 --> 02:05:29,400
How _oe._ it matter?

1359
02:05:29,899 --> 02:05:31,968
We are together,
that'._ all that matter._.

1360
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,103
l can't let him oet away with it.

02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:44,736
l beg of you
Give me two days.

1362
02:06:26,266 --> 02:06:27,900
Mery Christmas. Ms. Noronha.

1363
02:06:30,699 --> 02:06:33,669
We've spent three days
Iookino for you. Miss Noronha.

1364
02:06:51,266 --> 02:06:53,368
He was called Maior Subedar.

1365
02:06:54,266 --> 02:06:57,068
He planted that bomb
in your house. Rosie.

1366
02:06:58,666 --> 02:07:00,234
On Johnn_s orders.

1367
02:07:05,333 --> 02:07:07,068
The corpse we found at
your house?

1368
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:09,401
Burnt from hea_ to toe.

1369
02:07:10,633 --> 02:07:12,668
She was Maior Subeda_s wife.

1370
02:07:12,833 --> 02:07:14,634
An entire family..

1371
02:07:15,766 --> 02:07:17,067
Wiped out.

1372
02:07:17,166 --> 02:07:19,067
Because of you. Rosie.

1373
02:07:27,766 --> 02:07:29,701
l'm not Rosie.
l'm Rita.

1374
02:07:30,533 --> 02:07:32,601
Rita goes to Rosie's home
for the fir._t time.

1375
02:07:32,666 --> 02:07:35,535
She does not react to anything,
except for this rino.

1376
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,869
Because it is the only thing
she doesn't recoonize.

1377
02:07:41,333 --> 02:07:44,302
Your home in Goa has been
Iocked up for years.

1378
02:07:46,266 --> 02:07:47,266
Because after your escape..

1379
02:07:47,333 --> 02:07:50,269
the Po_uguese shot your
mother an_ ._i._ter.

1380
02:07:51,633 --> 02:07:53,468
