00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:39,061
Huh. Look at that face! Photoshopped.

that look? What are you staring at?

Hey Ritu!

Yo! Come on chat.

00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,228
I've heard you're on the cloud 9?

12
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,603
Okay.

13
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:06,103
What is the secret of your happiness?

14
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:10,020
Who is he?

15
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:13,811
Is it him?

16
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,020
You just saw him on webcam
for the first time yesterday,

17
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,395
and already he proposed his love?

18
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,353
So fast?

19
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:24,853
I had to match his speed.

20
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:26,978
He’s so handsome...

21
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,311
I’m in love...

22
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:31,978
What about you?

23
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,645
My guy?

24
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,436
Full of attitude.

25
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:36,728
He just proposed me yesterday
after a week of chatting.

26
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:38,478
That's okay, show me his photo!

27
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:39,311
show me.

28
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:41,875
No. Ladies first.

29
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:42,478
Oh really?

30
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:44,853
-Come on, Nishi!
-No way.

31
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,520
Okay, compromise.

32
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:48,978
Let’s upload the photos at the same time.

33
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,145
Okay, good idea. You ready?

34

Aah!

Thought you had me huh? Thought you had me?

No!

Oh crap!

00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:58,603
Yes.

-Oh!

00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,936
I’m the freakin best!

67
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:10,311
You gave a death blow when
I thought I almost got you!

68
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,197

00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,145
I shall beat you in some game soon, Nikki.

Hey, you’re just lucky, dude.

Oh luck, is it?
Ready for the next game, baby?

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:22,853

00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:27,103
Good god! Cannot stand these
shrieks and shouts.

75
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:27,645
Poor throw.

76
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,020
All these killings and ripping apart...

77
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:30,853
Oh got it.

78
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,254
What kind of games are these?

79
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:33,093
Very good.

80
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,958
Who did he get these qualities from?

81
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:36,962
Same.. uh!

82
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:39,520
Accurate throw!

83
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,978
And those friends he has...

84
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,270
they call it a Marathon...
playing non-stop for a week now.

Jump! Roll! Jump! Slash!
[gunfire in the video game]

87
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:54,353
It’s our fault, we let him be,
told him to do what he liked.

88
00:05:55,291 --> 00:06:00,311
I’m tired of begging
him to go out and get a job.

89
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,645
He did. 4 jobs in 6 months.

90
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,305
Why wouldn't they throw him out if
he plays games in the office too?

91
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,728
What’s his madness about internet and games?

92
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:10,561
He needs something to
update his social networks.

93
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,311
I’ve learnt a lot
about him through Facebook,

94
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,436
but he unfriended me so
I followed him on Twitter.

95
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:21,353
He’s even uploaded videos on
Youtube and has got a lot of likes.

96
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:24,061
Maybe he can find a girl online too.

97
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:26,395
We can save the expenditure
if they get married on Skype.

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,020
Guess who’s the boss! Huh?

100
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,353
Isn't this box responsible for all of this?

101
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:40,478

Now let’s see how he plays now. Come.

There isn't a chance.

-Shoot him too b***. Shoot that bugger.

Come on..

114
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:25,653
He’s using a data card.

115
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,978
Do you get internet from that too?

116
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:29,853
You cannot understand technology.

117
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:34,728
I got an idea!

118
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:39,061
I'll handle this.

119
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:47,811
Dear Nikki

120
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:51,113
Why don’t you go out and
have a few beers with friends?

121
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:53,835
It's a time waste, traffic and pollution.

122
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,436
Yet, what would I do outside when all
my friends are on my Facebook wall?

123
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:04,770
Leave the Facebook wall for a minute
and look at the wall around you...

124
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,978
Here, look at this.

125
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,103
What a shame! God! Move aside.

Wait a minute.

00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:21,353
Move..

Satya...listen, wait listen to me.

129
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,270
Why do you even have all of these?

00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:29,061
-Sathya, listen...
-Shut up!

131
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:32,209
You said you’d change his ways and
even took voluntary retirement.

132
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:35,145
What did you do?
Nothing, you cannot do a thing!

133
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,936
I will make sure that he will never
play another game in his life.

Oh my God!

Why don't you give a damn even when
your Father is having a heart attack?

He’s just being dramatic, I know.
Take it easy, Mom.

This attempt failed too.

145
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:43,978
Nikki, listen to me. Gaming seems like
fun, but too much of it is a bad thing.

00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,811
-Do get out for a while.
-I’m busy, mom.

Get out of this room and go get a real life!

Real life is boring, mom.
Same thing every day.

Eating, sleeping, same faces.

00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:02,311
You see dad’s face and dad sees yours.

Look here,
you have a new world every minute.

A new thrill every second!

153
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:12,061
Does real life have this
kind of challenge and excitement?

Leave it, you'll never get it.

00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:23,573
Are those your friends in the
game with those guns and weapons?

157
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:24,728
Don't you need anyone else?

158
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:27,270
-How many friends do you have, dad?
-Four.

159
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:30,311
Four of them.
They’re can do anything for me you know.

160
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,478
Look here. I have 1844 friends.

161
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:39,448
Will any of them help you
when you need them? Friends indeed!

That's okay,

163
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:46,353
Just look at these pics.
My uncle sent these for you.

00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:50,061
I’m not asking you to look at these
photos and marry one right away...

166
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,645
but just look at them once.

167
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:53,603
Look at them.

168
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:03,145
See Mom...
All these girls are crazy about me.

169
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,728
Look,
they would be here the moment I say 'love'.

170
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:12,353
They are all in the fast lane mom.

00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:14,061
Girls are just like toys.

172
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,103
I can play games with them.

173
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:24,103
Listen, I was a girl once too.

174
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:29,353
You’re too sentimental mom, please leave.

Don’t cry, Ritu.

important presentation,

Why don’t you take
the car at least today?

193
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:58,736
Just because we have a car, do I need to
add to the carbon monoxide in the city?

Do you think designing a game is
like doodling on your android?

Sir, it’s a real time game.

Is excitement just in killing and slaying?

They are getting addicted to
them and find the real world dull.

221
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:11,145
What if we show them the
excitement in the real world?

222
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,245
It’s a refreshing new game sir.

223

It's all my fault.

365

I thought it was love at first chat,

366
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:08,450
but he was flirting with both Nishi
and me not knowing we are friends.

367
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:13,241
It's not just us but a lot of other
girls in our cirlce are his victims.

When will you understand
what is real and what is unreal?

You can’t trust
everything on the internet.

Here she goes again.

He’s not to blame, you all are

372

little and off you go into a dream world.

This one is jobless so
she'll say whatever she wants.

377
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,241
Okay. Just make it little slimmer.

00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:50,408
-Should we trim the right side a little?
-Good... that’s enough.

some guy a lesson. Forgot it?

think you rejected it by mistake.

this and put it on Youtube.

00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,200
He needs to be sensitive.

It’s crazy to expect guys to be sensitive
nowadays when we ourselves aren’t.

there... quiet...

Third quality?

529
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,325
He needs to have a sense of humor.

00:46:57,325 --> 00:47:00,200
This guy is using me for worthless
jobs since I asked him for a promotion.

00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:12,033
A stone..

721
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:13,700
what’s the use of this?

722
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:14,825
Hail Lord Shiva...

723
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:18,408
You could knock someone’s
teeth, or build a home

724
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:25,575
Non-violence is the ultimate goal.

725
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:28,116
That's a great philosophy
preached by Gautama Buddha.

726
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:38,638
Danny, he’s got a stone with him.

727
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:41,075
Why are you talking crap instead
of updating me the status?

728
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,408
Go jump in Tank Bund.

729
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:45,450

Sir, could you donate 30 rupees?
I’d like to eat some fried rice.

734
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:10,741
Chinese fried rice, sir.

735
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:17,825
I’ve gotten bored of eating Biryani so
I’d like to eat some fried rice instead.

736
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:20,783
Your life is good man.

737
00:48:24,991 --> 00:48:26,700
You threw me a coin instead of 30 ruppes?

Don’t these people have work?

It'll take 22 minutes, sir.

749
00:49:33,991 --> 00:49:37,491
22 minutes? Not 21.5?

750
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:41,616
-22 sir.
-You’ve fixed it? You’ve committed to it?

751
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:44,408
-22.
-Okay fine.

752
00:49:46,578 --> 00:49:49,450
What? He said 22 minutes and got it in 2?

753
00:49:57,476 --> 00:49:58,825
Let’s see what the future holds.

754
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:03,950

Sounds like the title of an old movie.

766
00:50:46,522 --> 00:50:49,113
Got her! You play a game with me?

-Hey!
-Watch it!

768
00:50:57,575 --> 00:50:59,658
There was a girl right here.
Where is she?

769
00:50:59,783 --> 00:51:01,658
Who was she? Kajal or Samantha?

770
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:03,439
What? Where has she disappeared?

771
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:05,908
I think your head’s
heated searching for a girl.

772
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:07,950
Why don’t you cool it
with an ice cream, sir?

Here you go.

774

He's eating an ice cream bro.

775
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:15,158
Is it Chocolate or butterscotch?

776
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:18,075
One minute, I will find out.

777
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:22,241
I’ve not sent you to see if he is
sitting, standing and breathing

778
00:51:23,575 --> 00:51:26,950
Find out what he knows and
where he is going, you moron.

779
00:51:32,825 --> 00:51:34,023
This fellow has no idea
what it is really about,

780
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:36,935
and no brains to understand
if I tell him. Dumb fool!

781

What are you going on and on
about she being in danger?

Why have you turned so possesive?

Not possesive, just being protective.

881
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,655

first time for her safety.

What? When he was at
home, you wanted him to go out

970
01:09:25,158 --> 01:09:27,700
and now he’s out, you want him back home.

No. We don't have such cases.
How do you come searching without details?

Thank you, ma’am.

I’ll die right now.

No need of that.

There's a plan for that.

Will you die?

01:10:25,658 --> 01:10:29,533
I've hacked the hospital systems
and taken the recent records of patients.

4 of them are women.

One is 53, one is 41 years.
Another child of 10 years.

What happened, ma'am?

1006
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:15,189
She needs plastic surgery.

1007
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,450
It will cost upto 5 lacs.

1008
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,158
What if we bring the plastic?

1009
01:11:20,658 --> 01:11:22,158
You perform the surgery yourself at home

Why would such a beautiful and
intelligent girl even remember who I am?

Hey, wait. I think you sent
a friend request to my friend...

That’s true,

01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:50,913
"Can the nightingale that stands mutely"

1073
01:16:51,152 --> 01:16:54,832
"convey her feelings?"

1074
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:59,635
[creaking]

1075
01:17:02,731 --> 01:17:03,651
[splash]

1076
01:17:07,866 --> 01:17:09,075
Get her!

1077
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:15,212
[music]

1078
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:56,568
[panting]

1079
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:04,408
How long will you escape me?

1080
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,392
[door opens]

1081
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,803
[screaming]

1082
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,158
no!

1083
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,825
I think she’s fallen in love with him.

1084
01:18:25,745 --> 01:18:26,150
[smash]

1085
01:18:26,512 --> 01:18:29,069
[screaming]
Hey, shut up!

1086
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:31,575
Leave me...

1087
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,533
Hey Mobile! Bring the rope.

1088
01:18:34,991 --> 01:18:35,450
Tie her up.

1089
01:18:55,741 --> 01:18:57,700
The incident happened on Friday 11:30.

1090
01:18:58,241 --> 01:18:59,908
But so many missing
persons are reported the very next day?

1091
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,325
So are so many people
going missing everyday?

1092
01:19:04,783 --> 01:19:06,325
Who’s kidnapping all these people?

1093
01:19:06,866 --> 01:19:11,575
There’s no trace of Rags online,
even her profile has been deleted.

1094
01:19:11,775 --> 01:19:13,945
[phone ringing]

1095
01:19:16,516 --> 01:19:18,537
[screaming]

1096
01:19:19,408 --> 01:19:20,700
Who is it? What happened?

1097
01:19:22,116 --> 01:19:23,950
Stay away. Leave it

1098
01:19:24,866 --> 01:19:25,908
and stay away!

1099
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,158
Hey!

1100
01:19:35,075 --> 01:19:37,225
Sir, a girl’s gone missing.

1101
01:19:37,281 --> 01:19:40,616
Quiet! Come here, sir’s sleeping.

1102
01:19:41,325 --> 01:19:41,783
Sit.

1103
01:19:45,075 --> 01:19:45,825
Who’s the girl?

1104
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:46,783
A friend, sir.

1105
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:47,950
Rags.

1106
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:51,408
First go get her parents, then I
will write an FIR.

1107
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:53,241
No idea who her parents are, sir.

1108
01:19:53,325 --> 01:19:54,283
No idea who her parents are,

1109
01:19:54,908 --> 01:19:58,033
Don't know her friends either...
What are your online friendships about?

1110
01:19:58,658 --> 01:20:01,533
Sir, did you get any
information about our daughter?

1111
01:20:02,283 --> 01:20:03,950
Go home, we’ll call you if we find her.

1112
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:07,325
You keep pestering us.

1113
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:11,366
A missing case related
to internet has no hope.

1114
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:17,466
[weeping]

1115
01:20:21,325 --> 01:20:22,200
What happened, uncle?

1116
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:26,700
Someone kidnapped our daughter.

1117
01:20:26,825 --> 01:20:30,866
Someone trapped her on the internet.

1118
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:36,866
[weeping]

1119
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:22,283
I can’t find any clues
in this girl’s profile.

1120
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,033
This seems to be a big scam.

1121
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,283
Does Shirali have any close friends?

1122
01:21:31,575 --> 01:21:34,658
There was a girl who used
to come home, called Tanya.

1123
01:21:36,741 --> 01:21:37,158
Hi..

1124
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:41,408
Before I shifted schools,
Shirali and I were thick friends.

1125
01:21:41,616 --> 01:21:44,408
We would talk on the phone sometimes.

1126
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:46,908
She told me she fell in
love with a guy online.

1127
01:21:47,325 --> 01:21:50,991
She was going to meet him last
week and was really excited too.

1128
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:51,908
This...

1129
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,616
Did she give out any
details about this guy?

1130
01:21:55,075 --> 01:22:00,075
No, but, she told me he
kept gifting her dolls.

1131
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:03,366
This kind of a doll?

1132
01:22:03,616 --> 01:22:04,075
Yes...

1133
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:12,616
We don’t even have an address dude!

1134
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,783
We'll go to a toy shop
and try and get details.

1135
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:19,491
Thank you.

1136
01:22:19,825 --> 01:22:20,283
Bye.

1137
01:22:20,483 --> 01:22:21,483
[motorcycle leaving]

1138
01:22:25,455 --> 01:22:26,255
[door opens]

1139
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:29,950
Danny!

1140
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:37,831
[music]

1141
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,366
Leave me

1142
01:23:00,525 --> 01:23:02,741
After that beating,
he's still searching for her

1143
01:23:03,033 --> 01:23:06,741
Hey Mobile, this time the video we'll
send should send him into a frenzy

1144
01:23:06,825 --> 01:23:07,325
Okay, Danny.

1145
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,700
Does anyone buy this
doll from you in bulk?

1146
01:23:11,866 --> 01:23:13,075
This is a retail shop, sir.

1147
01:23:13,408 --> 01:23:14,408
Who will buy in bulk here?

1148
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:16,825
Okay, who supplies to you?

1149
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,158
Who are you?

1150
01:23:18,366 --> 01:23:19,882
why are you spoiling my
business? Leave, sir...

1151
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,402
-You don’t look like customers.
-Hey!

1152
01:23:21,975 --> 01:23:24,819
-Tell us or I'll kill you.
-Sir... I will tell you.

1153
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:26,876
Baby Doll Factory, it’s in Kharkhana.

1154
01:23:27,076 --> 01:23:28,116
They even export...

1155
01:23:28,408 --> 01:23:31,325
I don’t know anything
else, they supply to me too.

1156
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:57,575
Hi, before we start the online bidding,
here is a small presentation.

1157
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:01,533
These days, people don’t seem
to trust their own kith and kin.

1158
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:05,950
But they readily trust
any strangers online.

1159
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:10,116
And it has also become a fashion
to share every little event online.

1160
01:24:10,408 --> 01:24:13,284
So, we no longer need any guns
or goons to trap our victims.

1161
01:24:13,488 --> 01:24:15,384
Just trust is enough.

1162
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:19,200
Trust is a deadly weapon.
After that, it’s all a routine affair

1163
01:24:19,491 --> 01:24:21,066
First we will arrange a meeting.

1164
01:24:21,503 --> 01:24:24,225
We will safely bring the
goods to our warehouse.

1165
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:28,241
Then, we start the online bidding
through our secure e-commerce website.

1166
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:34,408
Finally within 48 hours we
will give you door delivery.

1167
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:38,491
Baby Doll Factory.
Safe. Smooth and Secure

1168
01:24:43,393 --> 01:24:44,757
[screaming]

1169
01:24:57,978 --> 01:24:59,257
[screaming]

1170
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:22,408
Stop.

1171
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,158
Where is this doll factory?

1172
01:25:25,408 --> 01:25:26,950
Go straight and take a right.

1173
01:25:35,533 --> 01:25:36,116
Sweetie,

1174
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,075
Sweetie,

1175
01:25:38,575 --> 01:25:40,116
You’re not disclosing Rags’ address anyhow.

1176
01:25:40,325 --> 01:25:42,450
At least get a good price darling.

1177
01:25:42,783 --> 01:25:43,408
Sweetie.

1178
01:25:43,991 --> 01:25:44,533
Sweetie.

1179
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:45,700
Come on!

1180
01:25:46,866 --> 01:25:47,700
Sweetie!

1181
01:25:51,825 --> 01:25:54,241
Didn’t I tell you to reduce
the dose, sweetheart?

1182
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:57,825
Chicks should struggle, buyers
should watch, bids should increase.

1183
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:58,658
Ain't it our routine?

1184
01:25:59,991 --> 01:26:02,533
They should be loaded into the
Vizag ship by morning 9:30.

1185
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:04,450
Boss is tensed for no reason.

1186
01:26:04,658 --> 01:26:06,700
Might as well call once again and confirm.

1187
01:26:21,985 --> 01:26:23,241
[knocking]
Watchman!

1188
01:26:24,241 --> 01:26:24,825
[knocking]
Hey!

1189
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:28,700
A factory in this maze?
Is there anyone on the premises?

1190
01:26:28,741 --> 01:26:29,741
[knocking]
Who’s there?

1191
01:26:30,325 --> 01:26:31,200
Come sir.

1192
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:32,783
-Open the gate.
-We have some urgent work

1193
01:26:33,283 --> 01:26:33,866
Open the gate!

1194
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:35,991
Why are you shouting? Just open up.

1195
01:26:36,908 --> 01:26:37,616
Hey, open the gate.

1196
01:26:37,867 --> 01:26:39,325
We have an appointment inside.

1197
01:26:40,908 --> 01:26:41,502
Open up!

1198
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:42,283
Shucks!

1199
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:44,783
What kind of a moron is he?

1200
01:26:48,241 --> 01:26:49,200
Deal with him.

1201
01:26:54,533 --> 01:26:56,866
Shut up, moron.

1202
01:26:57,408 --> 01:26:58,658
Lock, man...lock!

1203
01:27:02,616 --> 01:27:04,116
Come..
[gate opens]

1204
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,241
Come in and pick him up.

1205
01:27:06,491 --> 01:27:07,825
Come on move.

1206
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:10,241
Throw him inside.

1207
01:27:12,251 --> 01:27:12,667
[kick]

1208
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:18,825
Everything should go smoothly,

1209
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:22,325
no glitches anywhere. Same delivery spot.

1210
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:25,491
Road no: 31, lane behind the archway,

1211
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,658
Don’t worry. Okay?

1212
01:27:29,616 --> 01:27:30,491
Hi. I’m Nikhil.

1213
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,158
Hi.

1214
01:27:34,741 --> 01:27:38,575
-We want to buy your dolls in bulk.
-Actually, we are NRIs.

1215
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:40,658
We have a doll business in the USA.

1216
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:43,158
How did they even come inside?

1217
01:27:43,533 --> 01:27:46,033
They don’t look like businessmen.

1218
01:27:46,408 --> 01:27:49,450
If Boss sees them, he will export
me along with them to hell.

1219
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:52,741
Hey, are you here to pick up
the trash? Or on business?

1220
01:27:53,724 --> 01:27:54,625
[bashing]

1221
01:27:54,825 --> 01:27:57,408
What’s going on here? Tell me or die!

1222
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:00,741
What do you want?

1223
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:03,450
The girl of course.

1224
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:06,241
Hey, why is Ritu’s photograph here?

1225
01:28:06,825 --> 01:28:07,783
I don’t know anything!

1226
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:08,741
Where’s Rags?

1227
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:09,991
What happened to Shirali?

1228
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:11,950
Where is Ritu? Who is Danny?

1229
01:28:12,491 --> 01:28:14,075
Who are all these people?

1230
01:28:19,825 --> 01:28:20,491
No no no!

1231
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,816
Who is Danny?

1232
01:28:39,016 --> 01:28:39,712
[door opens]

1233
01:28:43,241 --> 01:28:44,158
You want Danny?

1234
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:49,200
Here, take it from
Danny, with love.

1235
01:28:51,116 --> 01:28:51,991
Who the hell are you?

1236
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,366
Where is Danny?

1237
01:28:53,741 --> 01:28:57,741
Danny will not be found so easily.

1238
01:28:58,075 --> 01:28:59,616
Talk or you will die!

1239
01:28:59,658 --> 01:29:00,533
Relax,

1240
01:29:01,866 --> 01:29:03,075
I will get you Danny.

1241
01:29:03,616 --> 01:29:04,450
Welcome.

1242
01:29:04,866 --> 01:29:06,033
Hey, you stay here.

1243
01:29:06,408 --> 01:29:07,502
Make sure no one moves.

1244
01:29:07,726 --> 01:29:09,006
-I will be back.
-Be careful.

1245
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:12,666
Who the hell are you?

1246
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,291
Danny’s assistant?

1247
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,166
What is going on here?

1248
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:23,166
Where are you taking me?

1249
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:26,625
What’s the factory upstairs?
These caves?

1250
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:30,583
Where did you put Rags?

1251
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:38,958
[dialing]

1252
01:29:47,973 --> 01:29:50,184

[bashing]

1254
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:09,166
Oh no, not yet.

1255
01:30:09,414 --> 01:30:10,916
You need to feel the pain, lover boy.

1256
01:30:57,692 --> 01:31:00,541
You want Rags?

1257
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Who are you to come in between?
What do you want with her?

1258
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,997
I have a business.

1259
01:31:08,357 --> 01:31:11,941
Buyers are waiting,
with an important delivery tonight.

1260
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:13,666
What’s your business?

1261
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:18,166
Oh... love?

1262
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,916
Love is also a business.

1263
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:32,958
-Hello.-Sir, the truck is here.

1264
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:35,875
We have to leave now. Already, I
got two missed calls from buyers.

1265
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,583
Leak the gas in Chamber B.

1266
01:31:46,065 --> 01:31:51,057
[gas leaking]

1267
01:31:56,666 --> 01:31:57,750
Who the hell are you people?
[door opens]

1268
01:31:57,833 --> 01:31:58,791
Hey who is that?

1269
01:31:58,991 --> 01:32:00,347
[toy pistol shot]
[laughing]

1270
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:03,458
Take him away!

1271
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,125
Nikki!

1272
01:32:04,381 --> 01:32:06,198

Nikki..

1273
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:08,416
Nikki!

1274
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:10,916
Nikki!

1275
01:32:12,863 --> 01:32:16,743

1278
01:33:02,103 --> 01:33:03,408

Pick up

1279
01:33:03,608 --> 01:33:08,584

Jai

1283
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:19,500
Jai!

01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:33,083
Jai!

1287
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:36,333
Jai!

1288
01:33:45,053 --> 01:33:45,291
Jai!

1289
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,333
[groans]
Jai!

1290
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:51,500
Are you okay?

1291
01:33:54,291 --> 01:33:57,708
Let’s go, man. There’s some
big scam going on here.

1292
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,708
We could have been killed here.

1293
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:01,333
Jai! Wait!

1294
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:04,541
Please, listen to me.

1295
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,791
How can we leave when we know
a scam’s going on here?

1296
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:08,666
Do you think you are a hero?

1297
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:10,541
This is a life and death matter.

1298
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:13,250
And isn’t it a life and death matter
for the girls going missing in the city?

1299
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:15,166
Don’t over-imagine things...

1300
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:17,208
but you...

1301
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:20,583
There is a drop-off tonight in
lane behind the archway in Road no: 31.

1302
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:22,791
If we get there,
we can expose his business.

1303
01:34:23,833 --> 01:34:24,666
We can stop him.

1304
01:34:25,291 --> 01:34:29,000
Jai... Please wait, listen to me.

1305
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:30,375
No, let’s go.

1306
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:31,291
Jai, please.

1307
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:32,708
Let’s go.

1308
01:34:34,416 --> 01:34:35,791
Just listen to me this one time.

1309
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:38,291
I think Rags is also with him.

1310
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:40,166
Please, Jai.

1311
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:49,166
Just two of us, what can we do?

1312
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,583
I have 1844 friends online.

1313
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:54,625
Here, I’m sending them a message

1314
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:57,416
Even if 25 of them turn
up, it’ll be enough.

1315
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,083
We can bust this guy.

1316
01:35:04,133 --> 01:35:06,589
[vehicle starts]

1317
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,500
That one girl I couldn’t get... Damn!

1318
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:30,541
Don’t worry, sir, we'll get her by the
time we get to the next consignment.

1319
01:35:50,916 --> 01:35:53,541
Just you? No one else?

1320
01:35:53,625 --> 01:35:55,750
They are on their way, in many trucks!

1321
01:35:56,958 --> 01:35:59,000
If they were coming,
you’d see them, wouldn’t you?

1322
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,875
Just me, solo.

1323
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:02,791
But I sent a message to so many of them.

1324
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:08,166
See I've got 1844 friends.

1325
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:10,958
Will any of them turn
up when you need them?

1326
01:36:18,285 --> 01:36:19,958
Only you two are my real friends.

1327
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:24,083
Do you have to get so sentimental?

1328
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:28,958
Okay, okay fine. Three of us will do.

1329
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:32,416
This is the spot they
mentioned. Listen to my plan.

1330
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:34,458
Hello, do you think
it’s a counter strike?

1331
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:36,458
Do you think we can get our
life back with a cheat code?

1332
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:39,000
It's a real life.
They could have guns with them!

1333
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:42,625
We don’t need guns, we need guts.

1334
01:36:43,124 --> 01:36:44,136
Just follow my instructions.

1335
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,546
You guys wait here in the car.

1336
01:36:45,746 --> 01:36:47,958
I will be on the other side of the road.
Both of you stay on the phones.

1337
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:52,666
He'll recognize me for sure.

1338
01:36:53,796 --> 01:36:55,108
-Do you have a spare tee shirt?
-Yeah.

1339
01:37:03,252 --> 01:37:04,106
[dialing]

1340
01:37:04,306 --> 01:37:07,375
You said he was a smooth operator. Do
you think we will be able to catch him?

1341
01:37:08,833 --> 01:37:10,125
His strength is his planning.

1342
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:11,666
But he doesn’t know our plan.

1343
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:14,791
Our strength is we ambush him by
surprise, just like Call of Duty.

1344
01:37:15,076 --> 01:37:16,458
Let's shock him and take him down.

1345
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:17,625
Okay okay.

1346
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:20,916
This is our delivery spot, sir.

1347
01:37:21,358 --> 01:37:24,500
Watch out! Get him, get him.

1348
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:29,333
Get him..

1349
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:33,842
-Love is a business huh?
-I don't know anything!

1350
01:37:34,195 --> 01:37:36,208
What's your business?
What are you delivering?

1351
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:42,250
Breaking news..

1352
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:47,333
the bravery of three
youths saved many lives.

1353
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:51,725
The alledged social networking woman
trafficker going by the name Sweet Guy,

1354
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,208
was taken into custody by the cops

1355
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:57,416
Nikhil and his friends who saved the
girls have been appreciated by the police

1356
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:04,166
Hey Nikki!

1357
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:06,625
We’ve become famous overnight.

1358
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:10,000
See, our photos are in the front page.

1359
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,833
If Rags is not with him,
then where is she?

1360
01:38:18,375 --> 01:38:19,291
What happened to her?

1361
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:24,833
How are those girls?

1362
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:30,500
Everyone is fine except
poor Ritu. She’s in a coma.

1363
01:38:31,916 --> 01:38:33,416
We don’t know who her parents are,

1364
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:38,625
the police are trying but
haven’t traced them yet.

1365
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:42,666
Why don’t they contact
her Facebook friends?

1366
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:53,458
What, Ritu and Nishi are
friends? Check Nishi’s profile.

1367
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:02,541
Oh crap!
Rags is their friend too.

1368
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:13,041
Found Nishi’s address and phone number.

1369
01:39:14,064 --> 01:39:15,375
Wait, let me call her...

01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:21,443
[music]

1371
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:23,458
She’s not picking up.

1372
01:39:25,517 --> 01:39:26,250
You have the address, right?

1373
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:28,333
Let’s go there.

1374
01:39:31,564 --> 01:39:33,588
[vehicle starts]

1375
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:38,791
Did he call? It's as expected, right?

1376
01:39:39,875 --> 01:39:42,208
If he knows the real
deal, he will go mad.

1377
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:44,583
You come down, I'll be there..

1378
01:39:45,289 --> 01:39:45,939
Yeah.

1379
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,833
Hey...look, there she is!

1380
01:39:56,083 --> 01:39:56,666
Let’s go.

1381
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:03,166
Let’s follow her.

1382
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:13,500
Hi, sweetie.
Hi.

1383
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:14,958
Did you bring the documents?

1384
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:22,250
Oh no!
What is the hell is this..

1385
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:23,875
Oh God! Let's get them.

1386
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:24,833
Oh no!

1387
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:29,708
[tyres screeching]
You follow her.

1388
01:40:32,166 --> 01:40:33,833
Hey where are you off to?

1389
01:40:35,574 --> 01:40:36,708
Hey wait you!

1390
01:40:49,165 --> 01:40:49,733
Crap.

[laughing]

1393
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:11,041
What’s so funny? Where’s Rags?

1394
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:12,541
Where’s Rags?

1395
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:15,458
I will kill you if
something’s happened to her.

1396
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:19,958
What’s going on in that doll factory?

1397
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:21,458
What’s going on between you and Nishi?

1398
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,583
Running a scam, are you? Take me to Rags!

1399

Shut your mouth and sit.
[phone ringing]

1404
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:07,000
Hello, Nikki?
That girl went inside a house.

1405
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:07,625
What?

1406
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:11,166
House no: 26, Road no:
82, Jubilee hills...

1407

You go inside, I’m on my way.

Come she is in inside

[driller whirring]

1418
01:43:36,882 --> 01:43:38,500
Rags is my sister’s daughter.

1419
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:43,375
I’ve raised her, thought I’d get
her married and send her off.

1420
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:49,250
If she's have minded her own work
without peeping into my activities

1421
01:43:50,166 --> 01:43:52,497
the story would be very different.

1422
01:43:52,697 --> 01:43:55,875
First time she tried to escape, I
dragged her by her hair and got her back.

1423
01:43:56,166 --> 01:43:58,208
She tried again a second time.

1424

Uncle!
[weeping]

1426
01:44:05,968 --> 01:44:11,716
I decided to export her,
like all the other girls.

[restraining]

1428
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:24,500
Be quiet!

1429
01:44:27,195 --> 01:44:28,291
If she’s alive, she a danger to us.

1430
01:44:31,916 --> 01:44:34,791
That’s why we decided to finish her.

1431

[burying]

1434
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:30,291
Yellow Rock, her favorite
place. That’s where she’s buried

1435
01:45:32,166 --> 01:45:34,416
and that’s where we’ll bury you soon.

1436
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:37,083
Me! Me!. I want to.
[driller whirring]

1437
01:45:37,166 --> 01:45:39,119
We can blind him, keep that hand steady.

[driller whirring]

1439
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:46,333
That's it.

[phone ringing]

1441
01:45:56,339 --> 01:45:57,666
Yeah, Mobile, what is it?

1442
01:45:59,291 --> 01:46:01,333
What... She escaped?

1443
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:06,125
A girl of 14 years has the
highest bidding, you idiot.

1444
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:07,500
That Mobile fellow is useless.

1445
01:46:08,291 --> 01:46:10,333
-What the hell are they doing there?
-You are bringing many problems.

1446
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:11,532
Wait wait wait...

1447
01:46:11,724 --> 01:46:12,620
-Where are you now.
-Danny,

1448
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:15,291
You look for the girl, I will handle
Mobile. Stay there, I’m on my way.

1449
01:46:15,958 --> 01:46:16,625
I’m coming too.

1450
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:17,208
Cut the phone..

1451
01:46:17,291 --> 01:46:19,458
Wherever she is, I
will get hold of her...

1452
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:22,083
Listen, don’t kill this one when
you find her like you did last time.

1453
01:46:22,283 --> 01:46:28,209

Come on Rags, everyone is waiting for you!

1480
01:53:32,783 --> 01:53:33,575
Hi Nikki!

1481
01:53:35,616 --> 01:53:36,825
Come on.

1482
01:53:41,741 --> 01:53:42,950
Hi Bro, welcome,

1483
01:53:46,535 --> 01:53:46,950
Come on!

1484
01:53:48,741 --> 01:53:49,533
Sivoham!

22 minutes.

1486
01:53:52,116 --> 01:53:53,325
They’ve told me now...

1487
01:53:55,241 --> 01:53:56,950
Sir, I’ve come from Warangal.

1488
01:53:58,575 --> 01:54:00,283
Chinese fried rice, sir.

1489
01:54:02,658 --> 01:54:04,158
Have an ice cream to cool down, sir.

1490
01:54:05,575 --> 01:54:06,866
Come inside, come.

1491
01:54:12,533 --> 01:54:15,658
Welcome to the 11th Gaming Competition.
[camera clicks]

1492
01:54:15,866 --> 01:54:18,950
We recieved 226 entries this year.
[camera clicks]

1493
01:54:19,450 --> 01:54:24,283
To select the winner from the shortlisted
entries, it was not an easy task.

1494
01:54:24,491 --> 01:54:29,450
Computer gaming has become
nothing but violence, blood and killing

1495
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:35,491
Imagine the psyche of a
person addicted to these games.

1496
01:54:36,533 --> 01:54:38,491
The psychology of a person
addicted to these games

1497
01:54:38,825 --> 01:54:40,504
is far removed from the beauty
of humanity feelings, emotions,

1498
01:54:40,711 --> 01:54:46,628
values and moods.

1499
01:54:46,991 --> 01:54:49,116
So now, let me announce the winner.

1500
01:54:51,283 --> 01:54:53,408
It is Log into Life,

1501
01:54:57,491 --> 01:55:00,241
a game designed by Raga Malika.

1502
01:55:00,441 --> 01:55:06,357
[applaud]

1503
01:55:09,991 --> 01:55:10,991
Congratulations.

1504
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:11,700
Thank you.

1505
01:55:17,075 --> 01:55:18,033
A few words, please.

1506
01:55:26,491 --> 01:55:29,325
Good evening, everyone.
Thank you for the honor.

1507
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:32,408
For the esteemed jury members
who bestowed such a big victory on me

1508
01:55:33,658 --> 01:55:36,658
and to my uncle who’s always
been there for me like a friend,

1509
01:55:36,991 --> 01:55:39,491
to all my friends who
participated in this

1510
01:55:39,783 --> 01:55:40,241
thank you.

1511
01:55:41,741 --> 01:55:45,075
Actually, I’m not very
happy on winning this award.

1512
01:55:46,283 --> 01:55:48,033
Our generation is very strange.

1513
01:55:48,325 --> 01:55:50,472
Football which should be
playing in a ground with our legs,

1514
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,658
is played on a screen with a finger.

1515
01:55:52,908 --> 01:55:56,703
Our little joys and sadness may not
be shared with the people at home,

1516
01:55:56,927 --> 01:55:59,890
but we share them online.

1517
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:03,825
That’s why I created this game,
based on real human emotions.

1518
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:07,491
When I was struggling with how
to experiment with this idea,

1519
01:56:07,741 --> 01:56:09,450
I met Nikki online.

1520
01:56:10,491 --> 01:56:13,408
Gaming is his world,
gadgets are his life.

1521
01:56:13,866 --> 01:56:16,783
He’s insensitive,
irresponsible and arrogant.

1522
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:22,075
I decided to bring out his real
human emotions with this game.

1523
01:56:22,408 --> 01:56:25,200
I play games, I’m an expert in
computer games.

1524
01:56:25,366 --> 01:56:26,491
You want to play a game?

1525
01:56:26,825 --> 01:56:28,325
I’ll definitely play with you.

1526
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:32,700
After this, I slowly pulled him into the
game play without his knowledge.

1527
01:56:33,825 --> 01:56:36,738
Nikhil, who didn’t care
about anything expect games,

1528
01:56:36,778 --> 01:56:40,198
He started searching for
a girl fot the first time.

1529
01:56:40,616 --> 01:56:42,616
Can’t I win a game
that was set-up by a girl?

1530
01:56:42,825 --> 01:56:46,866
He was over-confident that he’ll
easily get to me, and I destroyed that.

1531
01:56:49,283 --> 01:56:49,991
He felt bad.

1532
01:56:50,866 --> 01:56:53,449
Since then, he was longing to meet me

1533
01:56:53,689 --> 01:56:57,305
his concern for my safety,

1534
01:56:57,505 --> 01:57:00,991
his attempts to protect me...

1535
01:57:01,241 --> 01:57:03,095
and when he couldn’t find me,

1536
01:57:03,531 --> 01:57:06,278
the tention he went
through.. just melted my heart.

1537
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:14,408
Finally, he risked his life for me!

1538
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:22,075
Your heart can beat for some,
but it will jump through paces for one.

1539
01:57:22,283 --> 01:57:23,450
When his heart did that for me,

1540
01:57:23,741 --> 01:57:29,366
whenever I saw his longing, his
intense worry, concern for my safety,

1541
01:57:30,033 --> 01:57:31,499
I wanted to stop all this and

1542
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:36,599
I just wanted to run into his hands.

1543
01:57:37,325 --> 01:57:39,529
But you cannot win a war
without bloodshed and

1544
01:57:39,969 --> 01:57:43,026
you cannot play a game without injury.
That’s how I stopped myself.

1545
01:57:43,226 --> 01:57:45,071
It was for a broad objective

1546
01:57:45,475 --> 01:57:48,512
but did I have to bring him
to the edge - I was torn

1547
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:55,028
Just as I was wondering how to bring my
friends out of the influence of social media

1548
01:57:55,243 --> 01:57:57,652
Nikki did something sensational.

1549
01:57:58,783 --> 01:58:02,491
A rogue was using social media
for his girl trafficking business

1550
01:58:03,491 --> 01:58:06,366
and Nikki put a stop to him saving
my friend Ritu and many other girls.

1551
01:58:07,991 --> 01:58:10,783
I wanted to show him real life,

1552
01:58:11,075 --> 01:58:15,116
but he was the one who showed me
the basis of life - true love.

1553
01:58:15,283 --> 01:58:20,825
I’m hoping he will forgive me someday,

1554
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:26,700
but I’m fearful he might not and my
heart is breaking with that thought.

1555
01:58:29,075 --> 01:58:29,533
Nikki,

1556
01:58:32,783 --> 01:58:33,700
my apologies.

1557
01:58:35,283 --> 01:58:35,866
Please,

Wait a minute..

02:00:03,575 --> 02:00:06,700
Looks like, most of you have
already turned on your mobile phones.

1568
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:07,692
Please...

1569
02:00:08,142 --> 02:00:10,084
Just for one day, could you please
put the mobile phone back in your pocket?

1570
02:00:10,575 --> 02:00:13,622
Could you please look into the
eyes of your friends and family who

1571
02:00:13,846 --> 02:00:15,622
came with you to watch the film?

1572
02:00:16,408 --> 02:00:19,616
Just hold their hands
and feel the warmth.

1573
02:00:20,075 --> 02:00:22,939
Can you ever experience those
beautiful moments and feelings

1574
02:00:23,211 --> 02:00:26,891
in gadgets, social media
and computer games?

1575
02:00:27,058 --> 02:00:30,908
Are you controlling technology
or is technology controlling you?

1576
02:00:31,491 --> 02:00:32,658
Just give it a thought.

1577
02:00:33,116 --> 02:00:35,366
Think. Feel. Experience!
