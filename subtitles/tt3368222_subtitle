00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:28,168
You should have accepted the job that you found pope.

184
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,418
I do not see myself working in Germany.

185
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:33,293
"Mommy, Daddy, an arranged marriage."

186
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,126
Sometimes you want to throw the stone.

187
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:41,001
- It's all so hard ... - Throwing in the towel, not stone.

188
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:45,584
Why keep fighting when everyone is against you?

189
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:49,084
- You have the lovely legs. - Thank you.

190
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,251
What what?

191
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:56,626
Why do they want the triple? Call the inspector.

192
00:15:57,376 --> 00:16:01,876
Screams, can not hear you. And the broker that bribe?

193
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:05,709
This country is going to hell.

194
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:06,876
Oye...

195
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:11,668
- Why did you invite to the swanky? - It's called Suranjana.

196
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:12,918
This, Sí, suranjana.

197
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,418
Have you heard as he spoke to me?

198
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:19,084
- It has set plan, "Pam, Pam." - Eh ... For now.

199
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:22,084
Pam, you're not the haters and people.

200
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,084
No, but I am of Slitting and people.

201
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,751
One, you have to know.

202
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:32,251
Two, when I was in Bombay, I called me one day

203
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:35,334
after much. He said, "There's a sign,

204
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,501
you have to come". So I went.

205
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:39,501
It was an exhibition

206
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:43,418
the famous photographer Dayanita Singh.

207
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:49,626
This exposure change my way of photography.

208
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:54,584
He helped me to ask what I was doing with my life.

209
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:59,709
So I moved to Goa, to pursue my own art.

210
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,001
If your not had invited me,

211
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:09,293
I would not be here today.

212
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:21,126
Why do not you eat?

213
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,584
Give me that. Drink your milk.

214
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,584
Do not give me so much trouble!

215
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,668
- Di forgiveness. - Sorry.

216
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,793
Who gave you this?

217
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:36,626
You can not eat it.

218
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:40,501
Go away. Wash your hands and face.

219
00:17:41,918 --> 00:17:43,959
And wear flip-flops!

220
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:51,001
I want to wear a dress like this!

221
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,209
- Soon, honey. - When?

222
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,084
- Soon! - I want to marry!

223
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:57,918
- I want this dress! - I give it to you.

224
00:17:57,918 --> 00:18:01,959

- Pintémosle face. - Do not!

227
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,959
Frieda, who is the husband?

228
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,084
- What suspense! - Who's the sexy guy?

229
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:26,251
- I know, it's that doctor !. - Doctor?

230
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:30,418
You remember? I talked about that doctor who was rare.

231
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:34,001
- Me with that geek? - I was going to the gym a lot!

232
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:36,168
It was good!

233
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:39,293
And that other guy ... What was his name?

234
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,543
- ¡Tinku!

235
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:46,001
It was shorter than her.

236
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,543
It came through here. And he was an artist.

237
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:54,668
- It was a artistazo! - It was a artistazo!

00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:57,584
- Tell me there photo! - Just yes.

239

- I have to see her. - "I love you, Frieda» ..

240
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:03,626
"Be my wife".

241
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,876
Mother of his five children, two are drunkards and two are pigs,

242
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:13,418
but I have chosen is pure as a rose.

243
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:18,501
I will marry a handsome man bruna skin.

244
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:25,418
To the truncheon with white!

245
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,501
Father, why did you give my hand

246
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:39,709
a stranger from a distant land?

247
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:44,334
With you, Father,

248
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:48,001
I'm free as a bird.

249
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:52,959
Like a bird.

250
00:19:55,834 --> 00:20:00,418
I can not sing. I'll end up crying like a cupcake.

251
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,584
Frieda...

252
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:16,418
- You're crying? - Why are you crying?

Your father will not come?

00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:36,251
- Why? - He's angry.

257
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:40,126
He's angry? Why?

258
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:43,668
We are here to do whatever it takes. We will be with you.

259
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:48,043

00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:33,626
"I took your child in the womb! I wear your child in the womb. "

264
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,043
"I've been your son!" ..

265
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:41,293
"I wear your child in the womb."

266
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:43,876
Fuck...

267
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:49,459
- How rich is this tea. - Yes, and what a nice day.

268
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:53,626
Girls ...

269
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,584
- Seriously? - Who?

270
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,209
This like a train!

271
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:07,168
So wash it every day?

272
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,459
- Behave. - These married. Knock on her husband.

273
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,376
I appreciate everything beautiful.

274
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:16,334
We could play chess in his belly.

275
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:19,043
Jo is very quiet.

276
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:24,209
- Ask in Indian how it goes. - No, that says in her sexy accent.

277
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:26,043
Laxmi, do you know?

278
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,959
Comes one day a month.

279
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:29,918
a couple of days left.

280
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,001
I worked at home.

281
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,668
Oh yeah?

282
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:55,043
Grandmother!

283
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,834
Go faster. There are a lot of clothes.

284
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,501
You are tired?

285
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,668
I can wash ten times more! If I stop working, I'll die!

286
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:13,043
Why these girls wear torn clothes? How absurd.

287
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:16,209
Today young people wear clothes well.

288
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:21,543
If you wear tattered clothes, their lives will also be ragged.

289
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:23,168
Torn clothes...

290
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,918
Broken life.

291
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:42,876
This is not over.

292
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:45,959
Have you ever used a dildo?

293
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:49,459
- Look at her! - Do not know what a dildo.

294
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,543
- Of course! - He has used it.

295
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:56,751
Frieda, your turn.

296
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,293
Who is the husband?

297
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:04,709
- Sing. - That's cheating!

298
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:09,459
- Next question. - Teach us an orgasm.

299
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,126
¡Mad!

300
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:24,668
Who?

301
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:29,668
There's a guy at home!

302
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:32,668
Hi.

303
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,751
Forgive me. I am Zain.

304
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,876

307
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,876
Like ... What?

308
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:55,168
I said I'd be with my friends.

309
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:59,418
If you'd like for one day. And it's been four!

310
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:03,543
- I wanted to stay a little longer. - Well, call me and let me know!

311
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:08,876
- I took three days calling. - Have you come to scream?

312
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:12,834
Sorry. OMG. Mad, I was worried sick.

313
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:17,126
- But why? I am with my friends. - Do not call cost.

314
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:19,043
I did not want to intrude.

315
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,001
- Well, you did! - You Want a drink?

316
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,376
Yes, give me that cup.

317
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:26,793
I shit ...! Of course, you sit!

318
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,459
Drink, dine something! Catch a room, too!

319
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:33,834
Keep yourself comfortable!

320
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,084
All good?

321
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:37,334
- Sorry, who's Frieda? - I.

322
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,626
- You're her friend forever. - Yes.

323
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:46,001
I should not be doing this, but I'm very worried about her.

324
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:50,293
- Zain, say it once. - It's okay?

325
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,751
- You tried to kill himself twice. - What?

326
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:07,543
- What am I trying to do? - Cutting veins.

327
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:12,168
- Why? - We should be with her!

328
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:15,293
- It has been well. - I was happy ...

329
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:21,543
Quiet.

330
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:28,584
Let's go back inside. You'll be fine.

331
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:34,543
We will be with you.

332
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:36,626
I should not have yelled.

333
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:39,001
- Understand me. - My friend is getting married.

334
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:41,959
You could have called me, just say that.

335

And you mobile? Turn it on.

- Aunt, just say ... - I Ask him then, insensible.

342
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,834
- Amazing. - Tell me it is not true.

343
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:25,084
Amazing, fantastic! It is perfect, dammit.

344
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:27,084
Perfect, dammit.

345
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:34,543
Mad, we are worried about you. We are scared.

346
00:28:34,543 --> 00:28:37,459
What are you doing with your life?

347
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,918
I'm not doing anything with my life!

348
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,168
Nothing at all!

349
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:45,376
And that is the problem!

350
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:46,668
Mad...

351
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:51,501
I do not know what to do, I do not know ...

352
00:28:51,793 --> 00:28:53,918
Not so you have to kill you!

353
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:56,834
No, no ... I do not want to talk about this.

354
00:28:56,834 --> 00:29:02,001
We will never fire! You would have me have told us!

355
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:04,959
¡Dejadlo ya! i Basta!

356
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:09,834
Is it that I have to tell you everything?

357
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:14,668
But what's wrong with you?

358
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:17,834
- Your work is impressive. - What work?

359
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,584
Always you are with that!

360
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:27,334
My album of 12 songs is three years languishing.

361
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:29,751
Nobody wants it.

362
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:39,251
- We'll talk. - What is that monkey?

363
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:43,376
- It is very cute! - Today drink all you want.

364
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:47,084
What is that monkey? It's cute, right?

365
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:51,001
When playing guitar nobody dares to speak.

366
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:55,168
Does almost all those songs that you like Bollywood.

367
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:59,251
Tap eight out of ten films.

368
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:04,376
Plays guitar the world of good. And I also touches me well.

369
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,418
Seek and you shall find

370
00:30:39,418 --> 00:30:42,084
the way forward.

371
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:46,918
I'll leave everything behind and I'll fly with you.

372
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:50,209
I immobilizing black threads,

373
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:53,459
and take me and make me new.

374
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,601
Come to my rescue.

375
00:31:00,418 --> 00:31:01,268
Come to my rescue.

376
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:14,084
- Suranjana! - Speak up, can not hear you.

377
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,668
- His? - Now you hear me?

378
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,501
- The board is meeting ... - Suranjana?

379
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,293
At home no cover, Frieda.

380
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:25,418
- Laura, wait. - Let's see...

381
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:28,209
- We eat out low. - Can I finish?

382
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:32,918
- Voucher. - Wait ... Frieda? How low?

383
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:35,084
- As it is called? - Eddie.

384
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,168
- Hola, Eddie.
- Hola, Frieda.

385
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:43,126
- We took Eddie to eat? - The food comes to us.

386
00:31:43,126 --> 00:31:45,168
Uy, the neighbor.

387
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:47,876
What a shame.

388
00:31:56,543 --> 00:31:57,543
Come on, let's go.

389
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,793
Stop it.

390
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,584
Do not look.

391
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:23,709
Frieda, tell us who is the lucky one.

392
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:27,459
- I can not wait more. - Why?

393
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,168
Why you do not know yet!

394
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:32,334
The bride chooses.

395
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,959
Pillara one at the last moment.

396
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:39,168
As an authentic Indian cock. "Mommy, find me a husband!".

397
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,293
It happens to many girls.

398
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,459
- Your parents choose. - No longer.

399
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,834
Really? It was your case.

400
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:48,334
You pushed for you did not work.

401
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,334
Nobody pressured me!

402
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,668
I could choose from.

403
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:54,959
If I tell Ravi that I want to open my own office

404
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,959
and I do not want to be a housewife ...

405
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,168
I do not think it's going to say no.

406
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,918
How do you conciliaras home and work?

407
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:05,251
So there are fights. You think it's easy being married?

408
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:06,459
It is war.

409
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,459
Every day we argue over trifles.

410
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,584
Who takes care of Maya?

411
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:15,418
- They assumed I. - It's a stereotype.

412
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,209
My grandmother says, "how can you marry if not cook?".

413
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,418
I will help you.

414
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:24,043
- You have to Laxmi. - Enough talk about serious things.

415
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,001
- Let me case! - Now do not bring any afraid.

416
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:29,584
after many difficulties Marries.

417
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:31,251
That's why I asked.

418
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,293
¿Maya?

419
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:47,001
- Down here. - What are you doing there?

420
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:55,584
And that?

421
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:02,001
How nice!

422
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:21,626
- Are you glad you came? - Yes.

423
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:23,959
It moves me that ...

424
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,834
you call me to your wedding.

425
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:35,126
You know me. I go everywhere, see me and go back to work the next day.

426
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:39,501
It's the first time I do not want to leave!

427
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:44,668
- With your crazy friends, this site ... - They are lovely, right?

428
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,376
I feel like if ... young ... and free ...

429
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:50,543
I feel alive.

430
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,834
Thank you! I...

431
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:56,418
OMG!

432
00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:59,126
You should not mourn ...

433
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:14,543
Frieda! OMG!

434
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,001
What? What...

435
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:18,501
¡Dhoni!

436
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:23,834
Laxmi! Dhoni has returned to sneak!

437
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:26,334
- Quiet! - I Come!

438
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,501
- What a piece of cow! - Toro!

439
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,418
Is this a house, a farm or a zoo?

440
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:33,001
Stray animals...

441
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:35,418
Come on, come on, move, move ...

442
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:43,001
What's happening here?

443
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:46,251
- Nargis! - Hello!

444
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:47,418
Hello!

445
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:56,584
- You present them. Pam, Pamela. - Hello!

And she's Suranjana.

449
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:05,501
Suranjana, Nargis. Nargis, suranjana.

450
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:08,126
Hi.

451
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,543
Really?

452
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:16,668
Fuck! Really?

453
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:25,501
Maya, get up! i Get up!

454
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:28,959
We are going home. Get up!

455
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,501
- Mama...
- ¡No!

456
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,084
- I do not want to go...

457
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:34,334
- Come on! - I do not want to go...

458
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,459
Come!

459
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:40,418
Suranjana ...

460
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:46,251
¿Nargis?

461
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:48,251
¡Nargis Nasreen!

462
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:52,251
Out Su-Lite! Out Su-Lite!

463
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:56,084
Give us back our land!

464
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:58,418
They came to our village.

465
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:01,959
They took our land and built a factory.

466
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:04,793
They promised to work! Give us back ...

467
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:08,168
It had to be Nargis Nasreen?

468
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,001
She wants to destroy me!

469
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:16,501
Everything has stopped! Investors will!

470
00:37:16,793 --> 00:37:21,418
Listen to me please. Go if you want, but hear me out before.

471
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:24,251
- I ask this ... - Suranjana, please ...

472
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:26,001
I am listening to you.

473
00:37:28,293 --> 00:37:29,918
Stay. Maya this ...

474
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,001
This so happy ...

475
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,501
My factory I care ... I can not stay here for Maya.

476
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:39,168
And for me?

477
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:41,418
Listen to me.

478
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:46,709
My father is not coming and I was wondering if you wanted ...

479
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:52,209
put on your black suit and take me to the altar.

480
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:57,918
Please do not go.

481
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:02,043
No ... Do not make me go alone to the altar.

482
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:22,209
Listen.

483
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:27,043
You have what you have among you, let him out of my house.

484
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:31,668
I'm going to marry and that does not happen every day.

485
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:33,709
Please let arregladlo.

486
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:52,834
Frieda is getting married and all her friends have come.

487
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,918
Long ago I did not see them.

488
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,126
The other day we talked about how ...

489
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:04,501
used to be a good student, winning medals ...

490
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:09,709
I wondered if I could open a business myself.

491
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:17,293
It's not about money, Ravi.

492
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:20,501
It's because I'm at home all day

493
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:23,834
and I'm sick of all these parties.

494
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,084
Do not! I am not complaining...

495
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:29,584
This is important!

496
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,959
No, I'm not crying ...

497
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:35,626
Ravi, please ...

498
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:48,501
Motherfucker!

499
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:49,793
Motherfucker!

500
00:39:50,043 --> 00:39:51,251
I hate you!

501
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,959
I hate you! Cocoon!

502
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:57,459
Motherfucker! Fuck!

503
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,168
You are a monster!

504
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:01,918
For now.

505
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:05,209
Come on. Get out of here.

506
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:07,001
Get out!

507
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,293
¡Laxmi!

508
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:12,418
Laxmi! i go! i Laxmi!

509
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:15,418
Laxmi, ¡no! i No!

510
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:18,418
- Keep it at home. - Shut up, Tony!

511
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:44,001
We REGRET TO COMMUNICATE YOUR STYLE ALBUM IS NOT LOOKING FOR THAT.

512
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:45,209
¿Mad?

513
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:49,584
I want to show you something.

514
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:57,001
This is an old song Konkani my father used to play me.

515
00:40:58,459 --> 00:40:59,626
It is very sad.

516
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:04,043
It is about a woman. Says that when she was little

517
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,834
I went to school and he liked a boy.

518
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:12,209
He also fell in love with her and promised to marry.

519
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:22,543
And one day, this changed my mind.

520
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:24,668
For his social class.

521
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:27,418
I was so hurt and sad ...

522
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:30,959
he went to his wedding and saw married another.

523
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:35,418
But at the end of the song she says

524
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:41,209
that nothing happens because when they die they will be part of the same land.

525
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,334
They get back together.

526
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:50,251
How unfair!

527
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:52,959
I know.

528
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:58,626
It is rare, but when I hear it, it makes me feel happy for some reason.

529
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:00,543
I do not know.

530
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,418
Sera that reminds me of my father.

531
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:17,709
Come on! Come all!

532
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,126
Girls, come!

533
00:42:58,168 --> 00:42:59,251
Who?

534
00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:04,501
This is the most angry Indian goddess.

535
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:06,626
Time.

536
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,918
If it sounds angry.

537
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:10,376
Why would he?

538
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:16,793
When evil prevails in the world, Durga appears in its most ferocious form.

539
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,084
The Kali.

540
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:20,793
It comes to annihilate the evil

541
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:23,834
so that a new order is created in the world.

542
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,251
Mad, these very religious.

543
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:27,709
I'm very happy.

544
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:29,751
I wonder what you would be goddesses.

545
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:33,834
- I would clearly Kali. - And me?

546
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:37,126
I think all have a Kali inside.

547
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:40,251
- Show me yours. - Mine?

548
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:44,959
When I called the office, you can see my Kali.

549
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:47,668
Come, let us see your Kali.

550
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:51,834
Now show us yours.

551
00:43:53,168 --> 00:43:56,459
- Frieda ... - Das fear!

552
00:43:56,459 --> 00:44:00,084
Come on, Jo! I want to see yours!

553
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:04,834
- The goddess Kali! - A picture!

554
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:07,709
Let us make us a photo showing our Kali.

555
00:44:08,168 --> 00:44:11,168
¿Lists? ¿Lists? One two Three!

556
00:44:23,876 --> 00:44:24,918
What's up?

557
00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:28,001
What's going on?

558
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,668
Tranquilizaos.

559
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:34,834
What happens?

560
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:40,043
The other was better, but you wanted this ...

561
00:44:40,751 --> 00:44:41,793
Open the hood.

562
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:45,793
No coverage.

563
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:50,459
Behold! A carload of bombshells!

564
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:52,668
It's open?

565
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:55,459
- What did you say? - The capo!

566
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,168
- Do you need lubrication? - And you?

567
00:44:58,584 --> 00:45:01,293
- Outside! - Do you charge the batteries?

568
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:04,043
- Long! - Who is going to take?

569
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:06,168
Already you load them others?

570
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:09,501
Out of here! Do you believe really cool?

571
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:11,668
- Times ... - ¡Parad!

572
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,751
- You want to fight? - You want me to hit you?

573
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:15,876
¡Iran!

574
00:45:15,876 --> 00:45:17,959
Do not you dare touch me!

575
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:22,543
¡Parad! ¡Parad ya!

576
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:25,168
Mad for ya!

577
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:26,918
You'd fuck!

578
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:32,959
Be careful! This is our territory!

579
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:37,126
- Son of a ... - What the den!

580
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:38,793
To you!

581
00:45:43,668 --> 00:45:49,293
Those guys are always on the beach, drinking and abusing girls.

582
00:45:49,543 --> 00:45:50,668
They're disgusting!

583
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:54,293
We should not have been so violent with them.

584
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,418
What can we do? ¿Staying quiet?

585
00:45:57,418 --> 00:45:59,751
There were five. It's been crazy.

586
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:01,084
And we Seven!

587
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:04,709
Let us honest! Do any of you know karate?

588
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:07,043
I pointed to Maya taekwondo,

589
00:46:07,043 --> 00:46:09,459
so it can defend itself.

590
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:12,668
We should have recorded for the police.

591
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:15,126
Do not they have done nothing!

592
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:17,043
There are many videos like this.

593
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:18,418
OMG!

594
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:23,001
The culprits are the circle. They recognize them, but remain at large.

595
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:28,209
I believe that poverty plays a very important role in this problem.

596
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:31,084
- The rich do not commit crimes? - There's a reason.

597
00:46:31,084 --> 00:46:34,543
There is none. There are abuses in the middle class, rich ...

598
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:39,376
More than we think because cases are not reported.

599
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:44,959
"We do not want to report because if my daughter would never find a husband."

600
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:47,918
God! I do not understand it this culture.

601
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:50,543
We worry so much about what people say ...

602
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:54,501
His father will not come to the wedding. That says a lot. I am sorry.

603
00:46:55,376 --> 00:46:56,418
Claude D'silva

604
00:46:56,418 --> 00:47:01,418
I would not leave home if carrying something for him was "inappropriate".

605
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,459
Even if it were very hot.

606
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:07,793
And if something happens, say, "I told you not to put that ??.

607
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:10,209
If views short, you are tart.

608
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:15,793
You speak of short skirts? I wear a sari. I'm all covered!

609
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:20,501
Yet they look at me and bother me saying, "Give it to me, baby!".

610
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:25,543
Laxmi, we have the history of Kali and Durga,

611
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:29,084
but we lock up women and abuse them.

612
00:47:29,084 --> 00:47:31,043
We love women

613
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:33,293
and then we treat them grief.

614
00:47:33,293 --> 00:47:36,543
Equality! Equality is the only solution.

615
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:39,501
- Tene ... - Then why did you steal land?

616
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:45,168
Can we move from such trifles? They are not more than trifles!

617
00:47:45,168 --> 00:47:49,001
- Is or are? - Come on, calm down.

618
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:51,168
Fuck you, mean-spirited!

619
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:53,293
It takes everything very personal.

620
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:58,501
Women are the worst enemies of women! That's the problem!

621
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,168
We are enemy! We do not support!

622
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:06,584
We sit here and we point the finger. This is not the solution!

623
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:08,626
Grow the fuck up!

624
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:58,126
¡Pam, pam!
¡Pam, pam!

625
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:05,668
- Then send an email to ... - Mama!

626
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,418
¡Mama!

627
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:09,751
Laura, then I call!

628
00:49:11,793 --> 00:49:13,751
Where did you find this?

629
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,876
¡Frieda! ¡Frieda!

630
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:18,793
But what the hell is this?

631
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:20,334
- Is it true? - Yes.

632
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,209
The found in the kitchen!

633
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,709
- How do you have one? - I do not know.

634
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:27,376
- Show me where it was. - And that weapon?

635
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:29,876
- Here. - Here.

636
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:35,959
Maya, do you know who I keep in there?

637
00:49:36,876 --> 00:49:38,959
- Laxmi. - What?

638
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,959
- Laxmi? - Did you see it save?

639
00:49:43,126 --> 00:49:45,168
You have to talk to her.

640
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:47,459
- Stop exaggerating. - She's my daughter!

641
00:49:47,459 --> 00:49:48,584
We know.

642
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:54,501
¡Laxmi!

643
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:57,626
- Laxmi! - I go!

644
00:49:58,834 --> 00:49:59,834
What?

645
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:06,876
It's yours?

646
00:50:10,918 --> 00:50:12,209
Is yours the gun?

647
00:50:13,168 --> 00:50:15,584
Did you bring a gun to my house?

648
00:50:21,334 --> 00:50:22,334
¡Vete!

649
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:24,793
¡Vete!

650
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,251
You should have left her speak.

651
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:48,251
A trial has been fighting for eight years. Eight years!

652
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:51,751
Aimless ...

653
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:55,959
because I always fall behind eye.

654
00:50:57,918 --> 00:50:58,918
What trial?

655
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,751
He saw his brother killed.

656
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:07,626
I knew him well.

657
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:10,876
We grew up together.

658
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:15,459
- Because they killed him? - By land.

659
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:19,834
It was the only witness, so the case is extended.

660
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:26,501
all his savings was spent in bringing the officers.

661
00:51:30,543 --> 00:51:32,751
The poor thing is so sick.

662
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:37,918
Tony, who killed him is free. Pay his bail.

663
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:41,709
He blew the bar!

664
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:43,418
- Laxmi? - Yes.

665
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:46,168
You mean he was going to shoot?

666
00:51:46,168 --> 00:51:49,251
Yes! So I say! Whatever kill!

667
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,959
He had a gun in the house.

668
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:53,459
How I do soothed? What I do?

669
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:57,126
Can you imagine what it must be to see your brother die?

670
00:51:58,459 --> 00:52:01,918
We'll fix it. We will find a good lawyer.

671
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,334
It will not help.

672
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:07,126
- I ... I will help. - Insurance...

673
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:08,251
¡Nargis!

674
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:17,334
- Get rid of that. - I will do it.

675
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,501
Frieda...

676
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:28,334
Nothing happens. Voucher? Everything will be fine.

677
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:54,834
I swore that I would remove only the rope when he had avenged my brother.

678
00:52:56,418 --> 00:52:59,543
How long have you take her?

679
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:03,084
I do not remember. Many years.

680
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:08,876
I do not know if that day came.

681
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:13,918
Laxmi...

682
00:53:17,376 --> 00:53:19,834
Have you ever fallen in love?

683
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:26,334
Why?

684
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:35,501
- I have not had time. - No, it's because you've wasted ...

685
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:37,751
trying to get revenge.

686
00:53:42,543 --> 00:53:43,876
I think...

687
00:53:44,209 --> 00:53:47,293
you're wasting your life.

688
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:50,168
And that hurts me.

689
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,668
Laxmi, leave, please.

690
00:53:55,751 --> 00:53:56,834
Think of yourself.

691
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,334
Everything will be fine.

692
00:54:05,918 --> 00:54:07,001
Laxmi...

693
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,376
Everything will be fine.

694
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,126
Come on. Let's move on.

695
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:21,501
Take it off, please.

696
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:27,584
Please...

697
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:34,793
Of all Goa, why we came here?

698
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,751
It's my favorite cliff.

699
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:40,084
Why are you so happy?

700
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:14,959
It's time to face it.

701
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,459
It's time.

702
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:18,959
You are her friends. You should know.

703
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:23,501
Frieda. Hi. We come to question you.

704
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,543
- Yes.

705
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:26,001
The ...

706
00:56:26,251 --> 00:56:27,209
it's time to...

707
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,209
know who the groom.

708
00:56:29,793 --> 00:56:31,126
- No what?

709
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:34,376
Forgives? I'll take the altar. I deserve to know.

710
00:56:34,584 --> 00:56:36,084
Frieda, dínoslo.

711
00:56:36,084 --> 00:56:38,668
I'm your cousin and not know who you marry.

712
00:56:38,668 --> 00:56:40,793
Is your family. Tell her.

713
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:42,043
¿These changes?

714
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:44,959
You will not talk.

715
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:47,126
Call Knower.

716
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:48,793
- Laxmi? - What?

717
00:56:49,334 --> 00:56:51,084
Why is silly?

718
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:55,126
Once a month is left without speaking to 12.

719
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:56,668
To meditate.

720
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:58,793
And as vow of silence.

721
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,668
You should try it.

722
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:04,543
Do you know who is getting married?

723
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:07,709
I continue cleaning ...

724
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:11,126
What? Come on!

725
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:16,084
You can break the votes. This is important and a lot for the 12!

726
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:20,043
- What is this? - Frieda, tell us, please.

00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:26,001

00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,209
Come starts.

729
00:57:31,376 --> 00:57:32,584
Man? Moustache?

730
00:57:33,709 --> 00:57:34,834
¿Indian or English?

731
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:36,084
With pending?

732
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:37,501
Are you going to marry a hooligan?

733
00:57:38,418 --> 00:57:39,584
Would that be cool!

734
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:43,084
- Thread a needle? - Sex.

735
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:46,418
For tI that is to thread a needle?

736
00:57:46,418 --> 00:57:49,709
- Did not sex? - Very good, sexless to marry.

737
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:51,459
I am sorry.

738
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,418
What are you trying to say? Man with earring, mustache and sexless.

739
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:57,376
Tell us more clues ...

740
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:01,334
This is ridiculous!

741
00:58:06,543 --> 00:58:08,251

00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:10,418

Enter through the door.

745
00:58:14,376 --> 00:58:16,501
What about your boyfriend?

746
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:18,126
- Room. - A room.

747
00:58:18,126 --> 00:58:21,501

748
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:27,293
Open ... Exit ... closet?

00:58:31,626 --> 00:58:33,209
Sales of the closet.

750
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:37,084
Are you coming out of the closet?

751
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:41,751
- Are you coming out of the closet? - You are gay?

752
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:44,584
Frieda, are you gay?

753
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:52,751
- What do you mean gay? - That ... that is homosexual.

754
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:56,084
You're homosexual?

755
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:58,501
Homosexual...

00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:01,876

00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:15,751
You are gay?

760
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:21,501
Are you really gay?

761
00:59:27,876 --> 00:59:29,459
Well done!

762
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:30,709
You're good?

763
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:38,293
- Daughter of ... - Pam, nothing happens.

764
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:43,376
Voucher. Very good. I mean that's fine, but who is?

765
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,001
- Who is she? - That.

766
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:47,626

00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,501

00:59:54,126 --> 00:59:56,251
- Yes. - This in Siliagaon?

769
00:59:57,709 --> 00:59:59,376
Let's see ... Are you here?

770
01:00:01,084 --> 01:00:02,084
Now?

771
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:04,918
- Yes.

772
01:00:07,459 --> 01:00:11,834
- Why you looking at me? - You are standard. This is too much...

773
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:15,584
I'm not gay, but is very good I have a boyfriend.

774
01:00:20,418 --> 01:00:21,418
Is Laxmi?

775
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:25,584
For real? Are you going to marry the service?

776
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:28,418
What happens?

777
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:33,959
- What's up? - Pam, you have to be more receptive.

778
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:35,418
Can not be.

779
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:38,876
- Is Nargis? - What?

780
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:40,584
OMG!

781
01:00:41,334 --> 01:00:42,751
OMG...

782
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:46,668
I can not believe I did not dijeses nothing! And you still do not talk!

783
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:50,543
- How good! - OMG!

784
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:58,209
I'm so happy for you ...

785
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,709
- We're a little bundled. - By?

786
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:15,126
Now Nargis ... be our brother or sister?

787
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:18,376
Now no jokes.

788
01:01:19,751 --> 01:01:21,709
What have you thought this through?

789
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:28,084
Out much in the news this law Article 370.

790
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:34,084
That is the conflict in Kashmir.

791
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:36,084
You say 377.

792
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:40,418
- Voucher. Already knew. - "Against the order of nature".

793
01:01:41,043 --> 01:01:44,834
English passed the law in 1861 and still in force.

794
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:48,709
But according to the law ... you could go to prison?

795
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:51,209
We would love in jail.

796
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:56,376
And who entitles the government to judge what is natural and what is not?

797
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:57,709
They should not have it!

798
01:01:57,709 --> 01:02:01,168
If a woman chooses someone, what's so funny?

799
01:02:01,168 --> 01:02:06,584
In addition, here we are all criminals because oral sex is also a crime.

800
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:09,084
You, you, I ... All criminals.

801
01:02:09,376 --> 01:02:10,543
All except me.

802
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:14,459
Liar! I slap you if you lie.

803
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:17,876
- How do you say that? - Yes Yes.

804
01:02:17,876 --> 01:02:21,251
I've never done oral sex. I will never do it.

805
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:23,501
Pam...

806
01:02:24,168 --> 01:02:26,793
We know all that. Do not worry.

807
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,709
So we keep it private.

808
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:32,459
It took a lot to convince this church.

809
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:34,834
So we are only six.

810
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,043
¿Vale?

811
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:40,876
Vale.

812
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,584
How nice!

813
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:47,084
I love you.

814
01:02:47,293 --> 01:02:49,168
- Please! - Parad.

815
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:52,043
Get used, please.

816
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:54,376
Whatever we are trying!

817
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,126
And ... I can ask?

818
01:02:58,001 --> 01:02:59,251
This...

819
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:03,251
How do you do it?

820
01:03:04,876 --> 01:03:06,584
Come. I will you teach.

821
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:09,793
¡No!

822
01:03:10,543 --> 01:03:12,001
Nice ass!

823
01:03:12,418 --> 01:03:13,751
Bam! Returns!

824
01:03:17,501 --> 01:03:20,501
Since we'll be married, I have to know them more.

825
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:24,293
And Pam: '' How do you do it? ".

826
01:03:24,293 --> 01:03:25,668
You saw her run?

827
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:28,168
I can not believe it. Finally alone.

828
01:03:31,043 --> 01:03:32,126
Nargis...

829
01:03:38,584 --> 01:03:39,793
I missed you.

830
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:24,418
¿Pam?

831
01:04:24,834 --> 01:04:25,834
What's wrong?

832
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:28,584
Nothing.

833
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:29,751
What's wrong?

834
01:04:31,043 --> 01:04:32,084
Nothing.

835
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:36,834
You are scaring me.

836
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,334
Sit down.

837
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:42,834
You're good?

838
01:04:50,418 --> 01:04:52,209
I'm fine.

839
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:56,334
In fact, I've never been better.

840
01:04:58,001 --> 01:05:02,751
I'm happy. Contenta by Frieda. I'm happy for all.

841
01:05:03,709 --> 01:05:04,751
But...

842
01:05:05,793 --> 01:05:09,084
seeing her made me think about my life.

843
01:05:11,168 --> 01:05:13,876
Outside it is nice, but inside is empty.

844
01:05:15,793 --> 01:05:16,959
Every day...

845
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:20,668
My mother takes me to see the gynecologist.

846
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,418
Five years of marriage.

847
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:25,376
He wants a grandson.

848
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:28,418
He wants a grandson. He wants it now.

849
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:31,001
How can I give? Alone?

850
01:05:31,251 --> 01:05:32,834
I just tell me.

851
01:05:33,959 --> 01:05:37,459
And him? Nobody says anything to him.

852
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:41,001
For what? Guilt is always women.

853
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:46,293
- Pam ... - It's not right ...

854
01:05:47,001 --> 01:05:51,543
It is not, Mad appropriate. It is not right for me.

855
01:05:52,584 --> 01:05:53,876
No connection ...

856
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:55,501
emotional...

857
01:05:56,084 --> 01:05:57,251
or physical ...

858
01:05:57,834 --> 01:05:59,543
Just let time pass.

859
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:03,543
And I think: look at them! Frieda left his job ...

860
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:08,001
He is working with large magazines and leave to live happily here.

861
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:10,418
I leave and I'm so happy for her.

862
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:15,876
Even your life is amazing. You have a boyfriend who loves you so much

863
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:17,543
that came here.

864
01:06:18,126 --> 01:06:20,001
I want something like this!

865
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:22,418
Something that is mine.

866
01:06:22,918 --> 01:06:24,043
Pam...

867
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:26,084
I do not know what to tell you!

868
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:32,376
You speak of Frieda and Nargis, but think about the problems they will face.

869
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:38,876
In this country. Two married women. You know what must be going on?

870
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,209
Is not easy.

871
01:06:43,543 --> 01:06:47,709
I can not believe ... that I have not said anything all this time.

872
01:06:48,376 --> 01:06:50,668
I want to change...

873
01:06:51,793 --> 01:06:52,918
And give...

874
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:55,834
a step forward.

875
01:06:58,334 --> 01:07:01,251
But look at you. You are an incredible woman!

876
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:04,251
You can do anything you set your mind to.

877
01:07:06,793 --> 01:07:08,793
Do you remember high school?

878
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:11,293
We were going to eat the world!

879
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:13,043
We were the love sluts!

880
01:07:13,251 --> 01:07:16,126
- Everyone I was afraid. - So?

881
01:07:17,168 --> 01:07:20,459
We're still the same girls. The same!

882
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:24,084
You can with everything.

883
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:28,751
No one can stop you. Nobody can.

884
01:07:30,543 --> 01:07:32,626
- You want to do? - Divorce.

885
01:07:42,251 --> 01:07:44,459
And what will you do next?

886
01:07:46,418 --> 01:07:48,084
At least I will not live with him.

887
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:56,376
I'll go with you. I will give you the can.

888
01:07:57,293 --> 01:08:00,793
Receive me, please. For the old times.

889
01:08:10,168 --> 01:08:16,084
Sometimes so understanding, so changing other.

890
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,299
Lifetime...

891
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:26,084
Sometimes you make us laugh, sometimes you make us mourn.

892
01:08:26,334 --> 01:08:27,174
Lifetime...

893
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:33,959
A ray of hope,

894
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:39,001
joy for some.

895
01:08:39,001 --> 01:08:43,209
Life, sometimes,

896
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:49,501
you are a wave of sadness.

897
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:55,876
Sometimes so understanding, so changing other.

898
01:08:56,126 --> 01:08:56,966
Lifetime...

899
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:16,834
In you we find that we can not live without you, life.

900
01:09:19,543 --> 01:09:24,418
In you we find that we can not live without you.

901
01:09:24,418 --> 01:09:29,043
En ti aprendemos a amar,

902
01:09:29,043 --> 01:09:33,501
although you then we arrebates that love.

903
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:34,549
Lifetime...

904
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:45,584
Sometimes so understanding, so changing other.

905
01:09:46,126 --> 01:09:46,966
Lifetime...

906
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:14,084
You teach me to dream and fulfill my dreams,

907
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:18,543
but then you destroy and you apoderas all.

908
01:10:18,543 --> 01:10:22,876
I will not follow your rules more.

909
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:27,876
From now on I will write my destiny,

910
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:32,876
although I try to go out of your hand.

911
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:34,049
Lifetime...

912
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:45,334
Sometimes so understanding, you are everything.

913
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,418
Suranjana, sit down.

914
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:05,834
A Weir, Suranjana ...

915
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:09,293
It is not my business, but ...

916
01:11:10,959 --> 01:11:12,751
Do you you bought your phone?

917
01:11:13,668 --> 01:11:14,709
He entertains.

918
01:11:15,543 --> 01:11:18,084
Do you have any idea what you do with it?

919
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:19,793
To play.

920
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:21,418
All day.

921
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:23,793
Not only plays with him.

922
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:28,793
- The Maya did? - Yes.

923
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:33,001
- Are you sure? - Yes. He's very talented.

924
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,168
Look!

925
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:39,876
There's something else you should see.

926
01:11:39,876 --> 01:11:41,043
¡Laxmi!

927
01:11:45,084 --> 01:11:48,418
Always lurks here and draw.

928
01:11:52,293 --> 01:11:55,376
This is his father. He's always flying.

929
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:56,793
This is...

930
01:11:57,459 --> 01:11:58,793
breast in the office.

931
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:01,959
And this is her playing alone.

932
01:12:02,959 --> 01:12:05,251
If I ask why play alone,

933
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,084
She tells me:

934
01:12:08,793 --> 01:12:10,668
" I am always alone ".

935
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:48,793
Mommy, what's wrong?

936
01:13:07,876 --> 01:13:09,084
And this costume?

937
01:13:09,543 --> 01:13:13,043
The Nargis made me Tita this tribal costume.

938
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:32,834
Come, come, my little tribal.

939
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:36,918
Run. Run! Let mom catches you!

940
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:38,709
May you rascal!

941
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:48,126
My grandmother...

942
01:13:48,376 --> 01:13:51,501
You can not go to church for the wedding tomorrow.

943
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:53,376
He wants to bless you.

944
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:59,001
But he wants to give his blessing in a different way.

945
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:00,501
List?

946
01:14:00,793 --> 01:14:01,876
What cool!

947
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:06,126
I do not believe it!

948
01:14:09,043 --> 01:14:10,626
OMG!

949
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:23,626
- OMG! - Yes, I'm good!

950
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:31,751
Nargis, do you clothe dress?

951
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:34,959
- No. We do not know what will be. - What?

952
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:38,043
- I choose me! - Frieda has planned everything.

953
01:14:38,043 --> 01:14:41,418
- How romantic! - And we, what will we?

954
01:14:41,418 --> 01:14:42,668
I want a sari.

955
01:14:42,668 --> 01:14:45,251
How strong! Would you wear a sari?

956
01:14:45,584 --> 01:14:48,251
What? I will not put my lehenga.

957
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:03,543
Laxmi, have you seen your neighbor?

958
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,876
To which? What Ramu, who looks after the bull?

959
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:09,543
- No.

960
01:15:10,668 --> 01:15:12,501
¿When cleaning the car?

961
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,918
Laxmi! Yes! Ya know it!

962
01:15:16,793 --> 01:15:19,876
Well of course! When he left, he told me ...

963
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:23,334
I'd see you again in two or three weeks.

964
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:28,876
You came and started talking. Never before I had told me.

965
01:15:30,543 --> 01:15:33,043
- Want to know what else he told me? - Yes!

966
01:15:42,418 --> 01:15:44,043
You are wrong!

967
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:47,793
Jo, do you like?

968
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,209
This very good.

969
01:15:49,834 --> 01:15:52,126
"It is very good". So funny.

970
01:15:52,126 --> 01:15:54,126
What a funny accent you!

971
01:15:54,126 --> 01:15:56,876
What will you do in Bollywood if you talk bad?

972
01:15:57,376 --> 01:15:59,959
"I'm embaurasada you!".

973
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:03,043
I do not think talk like that.

974
01:16:03,043 --> 01:16:04,626
You also laughed at you.

975
01:16:05,293 --> 01:16:07,959
You always do the role of foreign.

976
01:16:08,459 --> 01:16:11,334
There are many benders. "Awa. I want awa. "

977
01:16:12,293 --> 01:16:14,251
- "¿Awa?"
- Agua.

978
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:17,043
Should I say "ajua" not?

979
01:16:18,418 --> 01:16:20,876
"I gussta", this is how you speak.

980
01:16:21,418 --> 01:16:24,209
I do not understand the problem with my accent.

981
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:26,834
None, but we laugh.

982
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:30,918
- Funny ... no different. - You two do me grace.

983
01:16:32,543 --> 01:16:34,209
We do not laugh at you.

984
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:37,501
You laugh at me and my accent. I was born this way.

985
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:39,334
In London they talk like that.

986
01:16:39,793 --> 01:16:41,626
- Take it easy. - Do not be angry.

987
01:16:41,626 --> 01:16:43,043
We will not do more.

988
01:16:43,043 --> 01:16:45,459
Frieda, and can not bring yourself.

989
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:48,418
- I'm serious about my career. - I know!

990
01:16:48,418 --> 01:16:51,376
No crappy player'll bend his voice.

991
01:16:51,376 --> 01:16:52,709
I have not said that.

992
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:54,959
I know you've worked hard.

993
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:56,251
I was hurt.

994
01:16:58,209 --> 01:16:59,418
Well, that's it.

995
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:01,751
- Eat another cupcake. - Yes.

996
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:04,001
Eat another, seriously.

997
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:07,501
No ... I need to give me a ride.

998
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:09,459
Hey, Jo ...

999
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:12,876
He got angry.

1000
01:17:12,876 --> 01:17:17,001
But if a while ago we were having a great time.

1001
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:19,626
And I asked:

1002
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:23,209
"You lost the keys inside, looking out why?".

1003
01:17:23,209 --> 01:17:25,543
I replied: "I have no light at home.

1004
01:17:25,543 --> 01:17:28,376
But on the street if so I'm looking here. "

1005
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:32,709
Do you get it?

1006
01:17:33,543 --> 01:17:35,168
Funny, huh?

1007
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:36,584
Do you want another?

1008
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:43,168
Hello Laura. Annoying?

1009
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:46,709
We'll deal with that later.

1010
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:48,293
First...

1011
01:17:49,084 --> 01:17:50,793
Lo Su-Lite Mining ...

1012
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:53,251
Tell them to stop.

1013
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:55,459
You heard right.

1014
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:59,001
To stop now, we leave the project.

1015
01:18:00,293 --> 01:18:03,793
I know that there will be losses. I'll fix it, quiet.

1016
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:04,959
Really!

1017
01:18:05,209 --> 01:18:07,959
Manish calls now. Tell him to stop.

1018
01:18:09,376 --> 01:18:11,543
Quiet, we talk tomorrow.

1019
01:18:12,251 --> 01:18:14,126
Tell Manish now.

1020
01:18:14,334 --> 01:18:15,334
Thank you.

1021
01:18:17,043 --> 01:18:18,459
For real?

1022
01:18:19,126 --> 01:18:20,126
What happens, aunt?

1023
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:22,043
Nargis has fought hard

1024
01:18:22,043 --> 01:18:24,501
by that company and those lands.

1025
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,709
Did you ever stop?

1026
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:30,209
He had no wedding gift.

1027
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:32,418
Suranjana ...

1028
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,959
It's enough?

1029
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:42,084
Girls, we are holidays, and uses mourn!

1030
01:18:42,376 --> 01:18:43,709
Mother!

1031
01:18:50,543 --> 01:18:54,793
- I did not know you were so generous. - Sometimes it happens unintentionally.

1032
01:18:57,959 --> 01:19:00,084
Is sleeping? Where is Jo?

1033
01:19:00,876 --> 01:19:02,418
Laxmi, ¿has visto a Jo?

1034
01:19:02,793 --> 01:19:04,126
He'll be here.

1035
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:08,043
He likes long walks.

1036
01:19:08,876 --> 01:19:11,376
- Let's call her. - 1, 2, 3.

1037
01:19:14,418 --> 01:19:16,876
- Maya sleeps! - Is there coverage?

1038
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:19,584
- He's still angry? -  For real?

1039
01:19:25,459 --> 01:19:27,501
- Let's go. - Time to go back.

1040
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,251
I do not see anything.

1041
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:37,918
Excuse me, he has seen the girl who came with us?

1042
01:19:38,334 --> 01:19:41,501
- No. - I Think again. It is foreign.

1043
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:43,709
- I did not see her. - He is not at home.

1044
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:44,876
The lanterns.

1045
01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:47,043
We'll go in groups.

1046
01:19:48,293 --> 01:19:50,751
Laxmi, llévala a casa a dormir.

1047
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:54,334
¡No separéis bones!

1048
01:20:01,251 --> 01:20:03,126
- What is that? - One chabola.

1049
01:20:05,376 --> 01:20:08,251
- You have to call someone. - Quiet.

1050
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:13,334
- Excuse me! - Have you seen a girl go?

1051
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:15,543
There were red flags. No one.

1052
01:20:15,918 --> 01:20:16,918
It is foreign.

1053
01:20:18,043 --> 01:20:21,418
If it passed one. He went over there.

1054
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:27,418
- Have you found anything? - Nothing.

1055
01:20:27,959 --> 01:20:29,543
What do we do?

1056
01:20:29,543 --> 01:20:31,501
Could she have gotten into the sea?

1057
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:39,959
Nothing happens, quiet.

1058
01:20:39,959 --> 01:20:41,584
We find it.

1059
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:46,126
Let's keep looking.

1060
01:21:08,918 --> 01:21:09,918
Is Jo?

1061
01:21:11,376 --> 01:21:12,376
What is that?

1062
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:28,918
Your, call someone!

1063
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:39,084
Who has mobile?

1064
01:21:41,834 --> 01:21:43,126
Who has mobile?

1065
01:21:47,334 --> 01:21:49,168
Let's get the Jeep.

1066
01:21:51,418 --> 01:21:52,418
Jo, wake up.

1067
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:56,793
The ambulance is on the way.

1068
01:21:59,793 --> 01:22:01,334
Subidle pants.

1069
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,876
It's bleeding!

1070
01:22:07,459 --> 01:22:08,459
No no!

1071
01:22:21,334 --> 01:22:23,501
- When they found? - Now.

1072
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:26,001
- Was it? - Yes, stretched.

1073
01:22:27,293 --> 01:22:28,751
Bocabajo.

1074
01:22:30,793 --> 01:22:32,251
Let's call the police.

1075
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,834
No he has reviewed!

1076
01:22:34,376 --> 01:22:37,001
I can not do anything without the police.

1077
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:40,043
- Go now! - Put it on the table.

1078
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:43,084
- I can not move without permission. - Why?

1079
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:45,334
You have to treat it!

1080
01:22:45,334 --> 01:22:48,084
She's dead, I can not revive!

1081
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:09,126
As it is called?

1082
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:12,376
Joanna.

1083
01:23:13,668 --> 01:23:14,751
It does not look Indian.

1084
01:23:16,376 --> 01:23:18,459
It is foreign environment. English.

1085
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,876
- What do you think? - I informed the tank.

1086
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:25,543
To do an autopsy.

1087
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,543
It has been sexual abuse.

1088
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:33,459
Ignite the lights!

1089
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,668
Had men?

1090
01:23:46,126 --> 01:23:47,126
No.

1091
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:48,793
And who smoked this?

1092
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:50,751
I smoke.

1093
01:23:55,668 --> 01:23:58,626
So they are wearing these clothes, eh?

1094
01:24:04,959 --> 01:24:07,918
What happened, what they were doing?

1095
01:24:09,501 --> 01:24:11,126
Our friend is getting married.

1096
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:13,251
We were celebrating.

1097
01:24:13,626 --> 01:24:15,834
What is that? Not now!

1098
01:24:17,584 --> 01:24:18,584
Follow.

1099
01:24:18,584 --> 01:24:20,376
We were on a picnic.

1100
01:24:20,793 --> 01:24:22,626
- He went for a walk. - Who?

1101
01:24:22,626 --> 01:24:24,001
- Jo. - Jo is ...?

1102
01:24:24,001 --> 01:24:25,376
Joanna.

1103
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:28,043
As we were leaving, but she was not.

1104
01:24:28,668 --> 01:24:30,418
- I was thinking. - Alone?

1105
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:32,126
There were many people.

1106
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:34,084
It was eight.

1107
01:24:34,543 --> 01:24:35,876
He was with us.

1108
01:24:36,293 --> 01:24:38,209
Will you please not smoke,

1109
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:40,751
we are examining the scene.

1110
01:24:44,543 --> 01:24:47,376
The victim ... What was the full name?

1111
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:49,918
- Joanna Mendes. - Profession?

1112
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:52,876
- Actress. - Actress?

1113
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:56,251
-Where? In Bollywood? - Tries.

1114
01:24:57,709 --> 01:24:58,709
He tried.

1115
01:25:00,459 --> 01:25:01,584
Who is getting married?

1116
01:25:07,626 --> 01:25:10,126
I will marry Nargis.

1117
01:25:10,543 --> 01:25:12,543
- Sorry? - And do you care?

1118
01:25:13,334 --> 01:25:14,668
What's that got to do?

1119
01:25:14,918 --> 01:25:16,251
I know what happened.

1120
01:25:16,543 --> 01:25:19,376
Well, I find out! Why do we ask?

1121
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:21,668
That tone will not help you.

1122
01:25:22,834 --> 01:25:26,251
- I also know scream. - Frieda and marry Nargis.

1123
01:25:30,418 --> 01:25:32,834
You two get married?

1124
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:36,168
Lord, photos.

1125
01:25:37,876 --> 01:25:40,668
Did the victim wearing these clothes?

1126
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:43,293
- What about clothes? - Sin Amor?

1127
01:25:43,293 --> 01:25:45,209
Do not make me get upset!

1128
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:47,626
They are a good family.

1129
01:25:54,626 --> 01:25:56,501
Is the daughter of Mr. D'silva?

1130
01:26:01,543 --> 01:26:04,501
I can not say anything officially,

1131
01:26:04,501 --> 01:26:06,459
but it seems that...

1132
01:26:08,334 --> 01:26:10,043
were three or more men.

1133
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:12,126
Be strong.

1134
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,376
Withstand interrogation.

1135
01:26:17,168 --> 01:26:19,418
The arrestaremos.

1136
01:26:23,793 --> 01:26:27,293
Lord, I feel wake,

1137
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:30,793
but the victim is British.

1138
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:34,668
It is Bollywood actress like Katrina.

1139
01:26:36,501 --> 01:26:37,834
The media speak.

1140
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:40,626
They were partying on the beach.

1141
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:43,793
The same situation.

1142
01:26:45,459 --> 01:26:49,668
By drinking on the beach, dressed obscenely ...

1143
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:54,418
They come from different cities for a wedding.

1144
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:58,043
two girls marry.

1145
01:27:00,043 --> 01:27:01,543
Lord ... yes.

1146
01:27:04,793 --> 01:27:07,126
Yes. Who knows.

1147
01:27:19,918 --> 01:27:21,168
And Jo?

1148
01:27:24,459 --> 01:27:25,793
Please Laxmi.

1149
01:27:38,251 --> 01:27:39,876
Maya, honey.

1150
01:27:40,293 --> 01:27:42,168
Where did the photos?

1151
01:27:42,168 --> 01:27:44,584
I followed Jo,

1152
01:27:44,584 --> 01:27:46,334
it was very dark.

1153
01:27:49,793 --> 01:27:51,876
OMG.

1154
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:03,334
Mad, look at the boy hat.

1155
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:08,084
They are the same!

1156
01:29:09,418 --> 01:29:10,918
We were harassed.

1157
01:29:11,209 --> 01:29:13,668
You remember? With whom we discussed.

1158
01:29:13,668 --> 01:29:16,793
The red hat was on a motorcycle.

1159
01:29:16,793 --> 01:29:19,459
We was insulting.

1160
01:29:20,293 --> 01:29:22,793
They're the same guys! - Surunjana?

1161
01:29:22,793 --> 01:29:25,043
They are those who stood by the jeep!

1162
01:29:25,876 --> 01:29:27,918
You have to call someone. TO...

1163
01:29:28,543 --> 01:29:30,626
Who, that shit cop?

1164
01:29:30,626 --> 01:29:32,334
Who do we give?

1165
01:29:37,751 --> 01:29:39,876
Frieda's bike is not.

1166
01:29:51,418 --> 01:29:52,709
No no no!

1167
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:54,834
¡Mad!

1168
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:49,418
For the bike!

1169
01:30:58,126 --> 01:31:00,334
I I've had a fucking with that half-caste!

1170
01:31:00,626 --> 01:31:02,251
Like screaming!

1171
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:05,584
- When I touch ... - Turn that off. Who you are?

1172
01:31:08,334 --> 01:31:09,668
Surunjana for!

1173
01:31:10,876 --> 01:31:11,876
For now!

1174
01:31:16,501 --> 01:31:18,334
Stop Please!

1175
01:31:29,876 --> 01:31:30,876
¿Mad?

1176
01:31:34,918 --> 01:31:36,001
¡Food, para!

1177
01:31:44,334 --> 01:31:45,751
For.

1178
01:32:21,501 --> 01:32:23,876
We awoke to a new event.

1179
01:32:23,876 --> 01:32:27,251
An Anglo-Indian girl was found dead on the beach.

1180
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:30,459
The body was a girl of 24 years.

1181
01:32:30,459 --> 01:32:33,709
The police do not want to comment.

1182
01:32:33,709 --> 01:32:38,459
It is said that it was a young Londoner who acted in Bollywood.

1183
01:32:38,459 --> 01:32:41,709
The victim was having a picnic.

1184
01:32:42,501 --> 01:32:46,584
In India they have reported 25,000 cases of rape.

1185
01:32:46,793 --> 01:32:49,543
24 years suffered a gang rape.

1186
01:32:49,543 --> 01:32:54,584
The Committee on Women explodes. Cases of rape have doubled.

1187
01:32:54,584 --> 01:32:58,001
India every 20 minutes a woman is raped.

1188
01:32:58,626 --> 01:33:02,418
Why did the police take so long to file a complaint?

1189
01:33:02,751 --> 01:33:05,834
The rape is an epidemic in our country.

1190
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:12,626
God, I commit her body to judge it.

1191
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:16,293
Forgive all their sins.

1192
01:33:16,876 --> 01:33:19,334
Welcome it into your kingdom

1193
01:33:20,043 --> 01:33:25,334
and guide her to rest in peace.

1194
01:33:26,543 --> 01:33:28,584
Dale eternal happiness

1195
01:33:29,126 --> 01:33:34,334
and reward his innocence for the rest of their eternal existence.

1196
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:38,793
Always wanted the dress.

1197
01:33:40,918 --> 01:33:42,043
You're right.

1198
01:33:42,501 --> 01:33:43,876
You look like an angel.

1199
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,918
These so beautiful.

1200
01:33:48,668 --> 01:33:50,543
Joanna Mendes era...

1201
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:53,084
is...

1202
01:33:53,918 --> 01:33:55,001
a butterfly.

1203
01:33:56,751 --> 01:33:59,626
Free and fragile.

1204
01:34:01,209 --> 01:34:02,959
It made me feel light.

1205
01:34:05,626 --> 01:34:08,043
And he gave me strength to face the sun.

1206
01:34:10,168 --> 01:34:11,584
Joanna Mendes

1207
01:34:12,168 --> 01:34:14,418
will live in my heart forever

1208
01:34:15,459 --> 01:34:19,168
and no evil can hurt.

1209
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,751
¿Iras al funeral ?

1210
01:34:29,209 --> 01:34:30,209
No, Zain.

1211
01:34:30,501 --> 01:34:33,168
- I dare not go to church. - Voucher.

1212
01:34:34,709 --> 01:34:37,751
- Can I call you back? - If, at anytime.

1213
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:39,543
I just wanted to congratulate you.

1214
01:34:40,209 --> 01:34:42,001
- What? - You do not know?

1215
01:34:42,251 --> 01:34:43,709
You video is a success!

1216
01:34:43,709 --> 01:34:45,918
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

1217
01:34:45,918 --> 01:34:49,084
It's not any joke. Watch the mail!

1218
01:34:49,334 --> 01:34:50,876
I sent him for hours.

1219
01:35:12,209 --> 01:35:16,084
BEAUTIFUL SONG OF MAD ABOUT LIFE. I LOVE!

1220
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:54,209
I am outraged that we can not write

1221
01:35:54,584 --> 01:35:56,584
our own stories.

1222
01:36:00,418 --> 01:36:02,251
I'm sick of protest.

1223
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:05,334
I never want to get angry.

1224
01:36:08,793 --> 01:36:12,959
Perhaps it is better that Joanna's soul rest in peace.

1225
01:36:14,459 --> 01:36:15,459
Maybe,

1226
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:17,543
in his next life,

1227
01:36:18,043 --> 01:36:22,501
or all the women here,

1228
01:36:22,918 --> 01:36:25,376
we can write our stories.

1229
01:37:55,959 --> 01:37:56,959
I feel ...

1230
01:37:57,168 --> 01:37:58,626
so sorry

1231
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:01,418
having to go well,

1232
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:03,459
in this situation.

1233
01:38:05,501 --> 01:38:09,376
I understand the loss of your loved one.

1234
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:12,584
Whoever did this ...

1235
01:38:13,834 --> 01:38:17,084
I know it's unforgivable crime.

1236
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:19,293
But,

1237
01:38:20,043 --> 01:38:21,168
last night,

1238
01:38:21,418 --> 01:38:23,418
They killed five people.

1239
01:38:25,751 --> 01:38:27,918
we have evidence

1240
01:38:28,876 --> 01:38:31,751
that the murderers of the five men

1241
01:38:32,334 --> 01:38:34,126
They are in this church.

1242
01:38:39,334 --> 01:38:44,209
If they were guilty of the crime against Joanna

1243
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:47,751
They should have been tried by the courts.

1244
01:38:48,334 --> 01:38:51,376
I hope you understand and collaborate.

1245
01:38:53,751 --> 01:38:57,668
Anyone who has taken the law into their own hands,

1246
01:38:58,501 --> 01:39:01,626
I get up now.

1247
01:39:03,334 --> 01:39:06,209
That is up!

1248
01:39:08,251 --> 01:39:10,834
That is up!
