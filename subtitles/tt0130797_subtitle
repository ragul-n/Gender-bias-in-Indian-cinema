1
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:05,708
Counterfeit notes!
Again counterfeit notes!

2
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:07,678
Who runs this business?
It comes from where?

3
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:08,806
I don't understand anything!

4
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:10,315
We are trying so hard!

5
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,347
But we have got nothing but faiIure!

6
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,312
Where is inspector Dinesh?

7
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:15,650
He has stiII not come!

8
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:19,286
Inspector Dinesh in his
zest took up this case!

9
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:20,684
But I don't understand!

10
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,228
We shouId trust inspector Dinesh's..

11
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,660
..capabiIity compIeteIy!

12
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,425
I trust his capabiIity!

13
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,658
But undoubtedIy this
is the doing of a gang!

14
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,699
Otherwise we have
pIotted such a strong ruse!

15
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,361
And we have not even found any cIue!

16
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,471
Yes!
- Mr. Rai Bahadur wants to meet you!

17
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,768
Send him in!

18
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,472
Rai Bahadur is coming
with some grievances!

19
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:45,576
Greetings, DIG!

20
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:46,710
Greetings, Rai Bahadur!

21
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,815
You seem so worried!
What's the matter?

22
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:52,416
What do I teII you, Rai Bahadur?

23
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:53,751
Again the same counterfeit money!

24
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:56,656
Great! I too have
come regarding this!

25
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,789
I understood that you
have come here for a reason.

26
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,800
What to do, Mr. Desai? Look at this!

27
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,428
God knows from where it came!

28
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:06,194
When I went to the bank,
I found out..

29
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:07,331
..aII of it is counterfeit money!

30
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:08,499
Counterfeit money?

31
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,210
Yes! If any other person
had been in my pIace..

32
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,610
..he wouId have been
arrested and brought here.

33
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:18,350
But it's my good fortune that
the bank manager was my friend.

34
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,288
But I want to ask how
Iong wiII this go on?

35
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:25,282
It wiII ruin businesses.

36
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,326
CountIess peopIe wiII be ruined.

37
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:31,289
It's your responsibiIity to
protect the weaIth of the nation.

38
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,362
The poIice aIways fuIfiI its duty.

39
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:38,226
I am sure that these
dangerous criminaIs..

40
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,603
..wiII be arrested very soon!

41
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,368
HeIIo! Inspector Mukashi!
- Yes, sir!

42
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,479
I am sending Rai Bahadur to you.

43
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:51,645
Record his statement. And
begin the investigation.

44
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:52,776
Okay, sir!

45
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:56,482
Rai Bahadur, give your
statement before Ieaving!

46
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,748
Sir, urgent message!

47
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,721
Yes. TeII me. What's the matter?

48
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:01,187
We have received
information that a passenger..

49
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:03,729
..boarding a fIight to DeIhi
is carrying counterfeit money!

50
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,264
He is carrying counterfeit money!

51
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,295
Who is that man? Who
gave you the information?

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,765
ConstabIe number 108!

53
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:12,430
Oh! I see! Look, quickIy

00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,272

00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,399
Inspector Rana!

56
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:16,908
You both quickIy go to the
airport with the poIice force!

57
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:21,269
Mr. Desai! The pIane
must have departed by now!

58
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:24,650
HeIIo! DIG here!

59
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:26,752
Has the pIane to DeIhi departed?

00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,380
ImmediateIy caII it back!

61
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,685
It's an important government task!

62

Okay, Mr. Desai! I wiII Ieave now!

63

Thank you so much!
Thank you for heIping us!

00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,662
No, no! It's my duty
to heIp the poIice!

65
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,359
Wish you good Iuck!
- Thank you very much!

66
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,634
HeIIo! Put me on

67
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:50,771
HeIIo. Yes. I wiII just caII him.

00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:52,502

69
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:57,374
Mother, whose caII is it?

00:03:58,552 --> 00:03:59,610

00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:23,603
Have you arranged everything?

73
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,304
Sir, take gram?

74
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:32,279
I don't know who he is! But
that person is in this fIight!

75
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,613
Sir, it is reaIIy nice.

76
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,712
No! I don't want it!

00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:39,382

You go there!

79
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:18,789
Your attention pIease!

Indian AirIines

81
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,565
..of fIight number 108 for KoIkata.

82
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,770
Passengers are requested to
proceed towards the aircraft!

83
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,365
Thank you!

84
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,462
Nonsense!
- I am sorry, ma'am!

85
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,877
Pick up aII these notes!

86
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,378
Excuse me!

87
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,352
With whose permission
did you cIick the snap?

88
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,692
I am a press reporter! I
don't need anybody's permission!

89
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,428
I have the poIice pass. I
am a registered reporter.

90
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,563
Ms. Renu!

91
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,703
As you know the poIice
are inquiring this case.

92
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,367
You don't have the
right to cIick photos..

93
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:51,501
..without permission!

94
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,341
Pardon me! I
understand my job very weII!

95
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:54,872
You seem to be very sensibIe.

96
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,679
But which camera are you carrying?
Beauty pIus?

97
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:00,550
Inspector, remove the negative!

98
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,678
What are you doing?

99
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:02,880
Why are you removing the
negative from my camera?

100
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,387
I too understand my duty very weII!

101
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,755
Look! Look!
- Your camera!

102
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:09,522
Go! Don't waste your time!

103
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:16,893
Inspector Rana!

104
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,330
After making the report, send
the corpse for the post-mortem!

105
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:20,463
Okay!

106
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:28,573
Good morning!
- Good morning!

107
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:30,341
Is the editor inside?
- Yes!

108
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,246
Mr. Rao, you wiII
have to take action!

109
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:34,411
You wiII have to pass a resoIution..

110
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:35,647
..in journaIist association!

111
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:38,881
This injustice and
humiIiation can't be toIerated!

112
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,523
You are very infuriated, Ms.
Renu! Have a seat!

113
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,688
Now teII me what happened?

114
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:46,525
What didn't happen!
I am a journaIist!

115
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,657
The reporter of a big newspaper!

116
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,258
I understand my duties very weII!

117
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:50,393
Of course!

118
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,732
God knows who that inspector was!

119
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,866
Such an interesting
and sensationaI news!

120
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,305
And that too about
the counterfeit notes!

121
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,433
Counterfeit notes!

122
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,270
Yes! A man was running away
with the counterfeit notes!

123
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,437
WhiIe trying to
escape from the poIice..

124
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:01,571
..he coIIided with a train.

125
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:04,282
The poIice seized that
bag of counterfeit notes!

126
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,410
Oh! I see! You
quickIy type this news!

127
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:08,745
Forget the news!

128
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:09,879
I had even cIicked the
snap of the accident!

129
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,719
But that inspector
snatched my camera.

130
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,849
And he removed the negatives!

131
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:14,291
He removed the negatives!

132
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,884
Yes! And he threatened me!

133
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,560
That the poIice are
investigating the case!

134
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,461
So not to pubIish anything
without their permission!

135
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,223
Then we wiII have
to ask the poIice..

136
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,598
..before pubIishing the news!

137
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,566
HeIIo! Operator!

138
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,366
City poIice! CID branch pIease!

139
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,338
It's not enough to request them.

140
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:33,671
You wiII have to take strict action!

141
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,438
HeIIo!

142
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,710
Yes, yes, yes!
Inspector Dinesh speaking!

143
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,321
Thanks for requesting me!

144
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,246
But Iook,
pubIishing such news couId..

145
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,951
..create hurdIes for our work.

146
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,259
This is such a serious
matter that if we made..

147
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:49,761
..even a smaII mistake then
we wiII be in troubIe. - Yes.

148
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,764
We can pubIish it as an
accident news, can't we?

149
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,958
No! Not at aII! No! Not at aII!

150
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:57,336
You can't pubIish this news at aII!

151
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:03,207
And Iook! TeII your
Iady reporter to behave..

152
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,335
..poIiteIy with the poIice officers.

153
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:06,469
Okay.

154
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,270
You didn't teII him anything.

155
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:10,407
What couId I have said?

156
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,210
He is requesting
that you shouId behave..

157
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,584
..poIiteIy with the poIice officers.

158
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,623
What! I misbehaved with them!

159
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,555
He snatched my camera
and removed the negatives!

160
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,320
He humiIiated me! On top
of that he is accusing me!

161
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,362
I wiII tackIe him!
- Listen!

162
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:24,726
We have no compIains from him.

163
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,560
He is a decent man.

164
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,768
Worshipping every time.
Making toys for the chiIdren.

165
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,598
Reading books for the prisoners.
This is what he does.

166
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,430
Then he deserves to be praised.

167
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,240
If aII the
prisoners become Iike him..

168
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,402
..then we won't need prisons.

169
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:39,536
Seeing his virtues, the government..

170
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:40,670
..has reduced his sentence.

171
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,339
You unnecessariIy doubt him.

172
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:43,676
I shouId meet him once.

173
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,882
BanwariIaI!
- Who? The jaiIor! TeII me, sir!

174
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:53,383
He is AbduI Rashid!
He is LaIa NandIaI!

175
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:54,751
They are sociaI workers!

176
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:56,317
Oh! Greetings!

177
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,261
Greetings! JaiIor, if I get a
few minutes to taIk to him aIone..

178
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:04,527
Yes, yes. SureIy.

179
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:06,363
ConstabIe, open the door.

180
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:13,436
Come.

181
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,546
Have a seat!
- Thanks! Thanks!

182
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:25,215
I wanted to ask you if
you have any probIem..

183
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:29,318
..sorrow.. or troubIe here.

184
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:30,687
I am Iiving comfortabIy.

185
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,560
Nowadays I don't face any probIem.

186
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,234
The faciIities which the government
has given to the prisoners..

187
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:39,396
..makes jaiI feeI Iike home!

188
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:40,905
Great! Wow!

189
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:44,238
LaIa NandIaI, he is
just Iike the way..

190
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,801
..the jaiIor described him.

191
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:51,382
Yes! I heard that
regarding the counterfeit notes..

192
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:52,884
LaIa, forget that!

193
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,619
Every person makes mistakes.

194
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,586
I too made a mistake.
Greed of money is reaIIy bad.

195
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:05,763
I too got stuck in it. And
now I am atoning for it.

196
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:09,890
Oh! I reaIIy regret it!
What about your famiIy?

197
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,333
I have nobody! I was aII aIone!

198
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,305
That's why I didn't
think about my future!

199
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:18,804
And I committed this crime.
Now I even hate that thought!

200
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:21,470
Yes! This is what even
the jaiIor was saying!

201
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,345
That you spend most of
your time praying to AIIah!

202
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,576
He has shown me a new path.

203
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,688
He has shown Iight
to this bIeak Iife.

204
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,880
It reaIIy gives me peace.

205
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:37,661
You are right! Now
permit me to Ieave!

206
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:40,390
Greetings!

207
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:47,469
Why have you kept this, mister?

208
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:51,367
I never intended
to fIee from prison!

209
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,238
And even if I intent to
then these smaII instruments..

210
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:54,779
..are of no use to me.

211
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,315
This is not what I meant.
I just asked casuaIIy.

212
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:59,715
I make toys for chiIdren with this.

213
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,316
Do you have any chiIdren?
- 1 1 daughters!

214
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,815
Its God's grace! At times
peopIe don't even have one!

215
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,787
With God's grace, I
have enough chiIdren!

216
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:11,356
God bIess them!

217
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:15,526
Give these toys to them!
- Thanks a Iot!

218
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,667
Now permit me to Ieave! Greetings.
- Greetings.

219
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,365
NandIaI!
- Come! Come!

220
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,633
Come! Greetings!

221
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:26,205
JaiIor, what are they
taIking to BanwariIaI..

222
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,338
..that its taking so much time!

223
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:29,675
I have to go to other pIaces too.

224
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,284
They are sociaI workers.
- Oh!

225
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:33,610
Wait! I wiII go and check!

226
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,587
They have come! You can Ieave!
- Okay!

227
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:39,816
Greetings!

228
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:52,898
Found out anything?
- No!

229
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:55,531
Who is this man?

230
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:57,367
He is a priest.

231
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,579
He brings veneration
things and books for BanwariIaI.

232
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,643
He has been coming here
since a Iong time. - Oh!

233
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:19,623
BuIakhi!

234
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,802
I doubt this man, Pandu!

235
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:29,366
If you say, shaII I
handcuff him right now?

236
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,610
That won't soIve the probIem. In
fact it wiII make it more serious.

237
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,873
Oh! So shaII I arrest BanwariIaI?

238
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:38,340
You aIways taIk Iike a fooI!
He is aIready in prison!

239
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:41,480
We shouId foIIow this priest!

240
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:44,955
Yes! I understood what
you said! Come on! Come on!

241
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,559
Ticket?

242
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:33,431
Ticket to where?
- The Iast stop.

243
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,473
FIora fountain. 2 tickets.

244
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:19,842
Driver, stop the bus!

245
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,260
Cab! Cab! Cab! Cab!

246
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,401
Note down the cab number. BMR 1663.

247
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,258
Two men are foIIowing me. Stop them.

248
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,458
What's the matter, Mr. BuIakhi?

249
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:42,592
Why are you so worried?

250
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:43,726
A MusIim man and a Hindu man..

251
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:44,861
..have been
foIIowing me from the prison.

252
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:46,427
I think they are CID officers.

253
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:47,697
CID officers!
- Yes!

254
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:53,441
Yes? Who are you Iooking for?

255
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,480
Pardon me. Just now a
man passed this way.

256
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,346
This MusIim man's moustache and
beard too seems to be artificiaI.

257
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,385
No probIem. We wiII find out soon.

258
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,512
The priest.

259
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:14,730
Greetings, ma'am!
- Greetings!

260
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:18,561
I am Iooking for the man
with whom you were taIking.

261
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,897
That moustache man.

262
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:24,403
Forget the moustache.
TaIk about the beard.

263
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,274
O my God!

264
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:31,342
Take away this
insoIent gaze from my face.

265
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,920
Don't harass me. Leave.

266
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,685
Where are you going?

267
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,418
Don't teII fibs.

268
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:44,322
What are you doing? O my God.

269
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:49,356
Take away this
insoIent gaze from my face.

270
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:12,321
I am heartIess and egotistic.

271
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,723
Don't Iook at me.

272
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:19,419
And I am away from your reach.

273
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:22,462
O magician.

274
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,634
I am heartIess and egotistic.

275
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:29,602
Don't Iook at me.

276
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:34,312
And I am away from your reach.

277
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,677
O magician.

278
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:41,412
O magician, don't cast your magic.

279
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,651
Don't Iock eyes. Leave.

280
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,517
Where are you going?

281
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,355
Don't teII fibs.

282
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:54,326
What are you doing? O my God.

283
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,428
Take away this
insoIent gaze from my face.

284
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:16,480
I saunter and sway Iike a serpent.

285
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:23,956
My gait is Iike a Iightening.

286
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:31,930
I saunter and sway Iike a serpent.

287
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:38,465
My gait is Iike a Iightening.

288
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:43,407
Fear my beauty.
Don't express Iove.

289
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:48,384
Are you crazy? Leave.

290
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,616
Where are you going?

291
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:52,350
Don't teII fibs.

292
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:56,324
What are you doing? O my God.

293
00:21:56,395 --> 00:22:01,298
Take away this
insoIent gaze from my face.

294
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,880
Don't Iock horns with me.

295
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:26,447
Let me go.

296
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:31,290
Consider me Iike
a deIicate fIower.

297
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,888
Don't Iook at me.

298
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:38,459
Don't Iock horns with me.

299
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,901
Let me go.

300
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:45,833
Consider me Iike
a deIicate fIower.

301
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,607
Don't Iook at me.

302
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:53,315
Don't Iock these
sharp eyes with me.

303
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:58,356
Don't enter my heart. Leave.

304
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,316
Where are you going?

305
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:01,916
Don't teII fibs.

306
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:05,661
What are you doing? O my God.

307
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:11,931
Take away this
insoIent gaze from my face.

308
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:16,935
Sir! I didn't understand one thing!

309
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:20,278
Here you danced with her.
Why didn't you arrest her?

310
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,403
You don't understand anything!

311
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,942
We have to nab the entire
gang and not just one man.

312
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,509
You didn't understand?

313
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:27,676
I understood what you said.

314
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:29,277
Let's go!
- Yes!

315
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:40,423
You took so Iong, Mr. BuIakhi!

316
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,558
What do I teII you, sir?
I was in grave troubIe.

317
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,962
When I Ieft the prison,
two men started foIIowing me!

318
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,396
What do you mean?

319
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:48,599
I think one was Hindu
and the other was MusIim!

320
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:51,643
I tried to trick them but
they reached to the hoteI.

321
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:55,638
They have reached the hoteI. -Yes!

322
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:59,746
Then?
- I escaped.

323
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,311
But I am sure they are CID officers.

324
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:08,792
The news of sending
the notes by pIane.

325
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:13,559
Sundardas's death. And
now you being foIIowed.

326
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,302
It cIearIy shows that
one of us is the traitor.

327
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:20,535
No, Mr. Manohar.
This is not possibIe.

328
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:21,937
We aII have been
together since the beginning.

329
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,906
We can even Iay down
our Iives for each other.

330
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:26,368
Then how can we betray each other?

331
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,208
Fine! But the
present circumstances..

332
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:31,579
..are against what you are saying.

333
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,282
Let it be. BuIakhi.
- Yes.

334
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,586
Did you bring it?
- Yes.

335
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,857
Very good! At Iast we succeeded.

336
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:47,593
Now there won't be a
dearth of new notes.

337
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,632
So we shouId dispose off the
oId stock as soon as possibIe.

338
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:53,395
Mr. Dhaniram.

339
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:55,229
I think it won't be
difficuIt for you..

340
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,298
..to withdraw 50,000
for the race on Sunday.

341
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,468
50,000!
- Why?

342
00:24:58,544 --> 00:24:59,602
ImpossibIe!

343
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,579
What's the difficuIty in this?
Look at LaIa DeendayaI!

344
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:04,646
He has a smaII textiIe shop.

345
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,612
StiII every month he
can manage 15,000 rupees.

346
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,752
Mr. Khan owns a carpet business.

347
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:10,516
Every month he
manages 20,000 rupees.

348
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,815
And you can't manage it
in such a big race course.

349
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:17,259
AII that is fine, Mr. Manohar.
But do consider the poIice too.

350
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:19,389
You are scared of the poIice?

351
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,694
I am not scared. But what
if the goods are seized?

352
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:22,825
You won't Iose anything.

353
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:24,663
We won't have to incur
the Ioss of the goods.

354
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,737
You wiII receive your commission.

355
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,272
But you don't
increase the commission too.

356
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:30,733
This is not in my hand.

357
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,611
This is boss's order. And I
can't disobey boss's order.

358
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:38,374
You peopIe are the boss.
Do as you wish.

359
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:41,350
Just get me my quota of 20,000!

360
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:45,789
Fine. You sit here.
I wiII just bring it.

361
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,692
Come on.

362
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,292
Come on.

363
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,271
Come on.

364
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:04,567
I won.

365
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,546
Give me my money.

366
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:11,580
I am in a hurry. QuickIy.
- Here.

367
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:14,274
What have you done?

368
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:17,322
I have won.

369
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:19,584
Sir!
- Give me my money.

370
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:20,716
What do you mean? HoId this!

371
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,623
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
Sorry! Why are you angry?

372
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:24,355
Have you counted them properIy?

373
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,363
Why are you taIking in between?
Have you made the payment correctIy?

374
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,928
I have won.

375
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:38,800
Why have you brought me here?

376
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,775
And you have put Iights in my face.

377
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,313
What have I done?

378
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,609
That's why you have
been brought here.

379
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:45,374
What's the matter?

380
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:49,415
Come on! QuickIy!

381
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:53,782
Come on!

382
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,265
Do you know him?

383
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:07,700
This man! O my God!
Inspector, he is the one!

384
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:09,604
He deaIs in counterfeit money!

385
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:11,836
Keep quiet! Sit here!
- Fine, sir!

386
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,504
Quiet!
- I have been sIandered!

387
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,807
Come on! Sit here! Sit!

388
00:27:19,184 --> 00:27:24,554
Do you know him?
- What? No! I don't know him.

389
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,648
Fear God! Why are you Iying?

390
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:28,590
You keep quiet! This
is a poIice office!

391
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:32,324
So Mr. Dhaniram, you don't know him?

392
00:27:32,397 --> 00:27:35,560
What? Maybe I must have seen him.

393
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:39,336
But where and when? I
don't remember, inspector.

394
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,304
Hey, you! Yesterday
at the race course..

395
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:42,431
Shut up.

396
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:43,565
Okay, sir!

397
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:47,712
Mr. Dhaniram! How Iong have you
been staying at ShangriIIa hoteI?

398
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,538
Around..
- Look here!

399
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,341
How Iong?
- Around 5-6 years!

400
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:56,413
Do you know Sundardas?
- What?

401
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:58,388
Do you know Sundardas?

402
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:01,255
What? Sundardas? Sundardas who?

403
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,520
Sundardas who deaIt
in counterfeit money.

404
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:05,354
Counterfeit money!

405
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,488
He was heading for DeIhi.

406
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:07,623
But whiIe trying to
escape From the poIice..

407
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:08,757
..he was kiIIed in a train accident.

408
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:09,892
Do you know him?

409
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:12,293
I did hear about it. But..

410
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:14,872
When did you hear it? Where?
- What?

411
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,298
Who toId you?

412
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:21,439
Somebody was taIking in the hoteI.
But I don't know him.

413
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,645
Then how did you get
the counterfeit money?

414
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,346
Counterfeit money?
What counterfeit money?

415
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:27,576
The same money which you gave him..

416
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:28,710
..at the race course yesterday.

417
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:30,546
I gave it to him?

418
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,283
You didn't give him 7,000 rupees?

419
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:34,854
7,000 rupees?
- Yes!

420
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,687
From those 5000
rupees are counterfeit.

421
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:40,597
No, sir! This is not possibIe!

422
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,257
From where wiII I
get counterfeit money?

423
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,428
Here are those
counterfeit notes! Recognise it!

424
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,940
These notes are counterfeit?
What's wrong in it?

425
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,302
They Iook fine.

426
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:54,739
These are counterfeit notes!
From where did you get it?

427
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:55,871
Who gave it to you?

428
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:57,778
I don't know. BeIieve me, inspector.

429
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:58,907
I don't know anything.

430
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:00,607
You onIy teII me.

431
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:01,743
How to know the difference between..

432
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,878
..the reaI and counterfeit?

433
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:06,318
And sir, racing is risky.
DeaIings of miIIions.

434
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:07,651
Taking from one person,
giving to another.

435
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:09,216
Taking from another
person And giving to him.

436
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:12,296
Okay. Supposing that I
have given him these notes.

437
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:15,532
But you find out who
gave me these notes.

438
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,225
We want you to answer this question.

439
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:19,564
I don't know anything, inspector.

440
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:22,368
By God! I don't know anything!
I am innocent!

441
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,502
If it's a crime to be a race
bookie, then I am the cuIprit.

442
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:27,174
For that you can
put me behind bars..

443
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,610
..or you can do whatever you want!

444
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,280
You seem to be a smart man.

445
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,778
TeII me, Dinesh. What happened?

446
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:38,355
This man seems to be very cunning.

447
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:39,549
He won't spiII out so easiIy.

448
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:41,819
Lock him up. That
wiII do the trick. Sit.

449
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,690
No. I think we shouId Iet him go.

450
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:44,820
Let him go?
- Yes!

451
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,753
It's confirmed that
he won't say anything.

452
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:48,194
But if we Ieft him then we
might find out something..

453
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,733
..by keeping a tab on him.

454
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,426
As you wish. The case
has been handed to you.

455
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:54,267
Do what you think is right.
- Thank you, sir!

456
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,597
Mother, today I too am obstinate..

457
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:56,732
..that I wiII ask you!

458
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:00,210
I want to ask you that if you
wanted me to forget father..

459
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:02,337
..then why did you
keep these things?

460
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,876
These things which every
year reminds me of my birthday!

461
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:08,948
These toys, these cIothes, these..
and this Iocket!

462
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:12,417
It's his Iast gift
on my 5th birthday.

463
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:13,683
Mother, you wiII have to teII me.

464
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:15,487
If father is aIive then where is he?

465
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,328
Even I don't know that, son.

466
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,727
After that day I
never saw him again.

467
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:22,964
And I never heard
anything about him.

468
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:27,370
After which day?
- Your 5th birthday.

469
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,468
There was so much joy at home.

470
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:31,772
He gave you this Iocket.

471
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,573
You touched your father's
feet and took his bIessing.

472
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:39,876
He took you in his arms. Just then..

473
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:41,685
The poIice have come!
- PoIice!

474
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:51,787
Then what happened, mother?

475
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:54,664
I don't know.

476
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,827
Where did it happen? When it
happen? - Why did the poIice come?

477
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:59,928
Why did father fIee?
What was his name?

478
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:03,406
No, no, son! Don't ask me!
Don't ask me aII this!

479
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:06,268
You are under my oath.
Don't ask me aII this.

480
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:19,790
Good morning!
- Good morning!

481
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,554
TeII me. How can I heIp you?

482
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,690

483
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:25,896
Good morning!

484
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,295
O no, no, no, no! Not a room!

485
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,423

492
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,443
If the room is not empty,

Yes, Your Highness! We

495
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,515
No need for doubIe payment,
Your Highness!

496
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,618
I wiII serve you the best I can.
- Fine!

497
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:54,420
One minute! Suite number 1 18! Come!

00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,260
Don't worry, Your Highness!

501
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,358
You can have the hoteI's
car and my personaI car too.

502
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:06,768
O no! I am not used to
traveIIing in other's car.

503
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:09,534
Your Highness, if you say
shaII I bring the state car!

504
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,405
You shut up! You don't
understand anything!

505
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:15,276
I want the Iatest design,
Iatest modeI of a convertibIe car.

506
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,439
Yes, Your Highness! I

507
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:18,573
Did you understand, Mr. Manager?

508
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,277
I understood! You don't worry!

509
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,547
I wiII caII the agent

510
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:23,679
PIease come!

511

Yes, yes. I trust inspector Ashwin.

Your Highness, even
I have this penchant!

513
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:36,326
Oh, no probIem.

514
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:38,232
I think that if
gambIing is considered..

515
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,464
..as a business then
you can earn profit.

516
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:43,405
Every year I go to..

517
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:46,373
I remember once..

518
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,810
Do you have a penchant for races?
- A bit.

519
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:50,780
A bit of everything.

520
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:54,751
I wiII give you a gift.
Where is my room?

521
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,443
This way, Your Highness!

522
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:00,414
Your Highness! Here is your suite!

523
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:04,586
Did you Iike it?

524
00:33:04,663 --> 00:33:07,632
The room is quite smaII. We
have bathrooms of this size!

525
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,860
And Your Highness, the
kitchen is bigger than this!

526
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:12,596
You shut up! You aIways interfere.

527
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,434
Have you got the Iuggage?
- Yes, Your Highness!

528
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:15,868
The porters are stiII standing here!

529
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,669
How many are you?
- Sir, two.

530
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:18,900
Two!
- Yes!

531
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:20,437
Distribute this!
- Greetings, sir!

532
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,477
Mr. Dhaniram, this
business is risky.

533
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:25,741
But you at Ieast escaped.

534
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:26,875
This time I escaped.

535
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:29,283
But if I got struck again,
then I won't be abIe to escape.

536
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,747
A cunning and a smart man
can never get into troubIe.

537
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,653
But where did you
disappear for 2 days?

538
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:36,819
I didn't come here
fearing the poIice.

539
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,598
Nowadays you have started
fearing the poIice a Iot.

540
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,391
The matter is such.

541
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,226
And today too I have
come just because..

542
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,361
..I wanted to settIe the accounts.

543
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:47,763
What do you mean?

544
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,307
I mean that I have
decided to Ieave this job.

545
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,570
TiII now you used to say
to increase the commission.

546
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,677
Today how did you suddenIy
decide to Ieave the job?

547
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,743
No need to feeI bad, Mr. Manohar.

548
00:33:58,316 --> 00:33:59,715
I am Ieaving this job wiIIingIy.

549
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:02,181
I wiII settIe your account
and send you the money..

550
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:03,311
..tomorrow at the hoteI.

551
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:04,446
Thanks, Mr. Manohar.

552
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:06,547
But remember. The notes
shouId not be counterfeit.

553
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,350
You don't worry.

554
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:11,522
Thank you very much,
Mr. Manohar. Good night.

555
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:13,355
Good night.

556
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:19,332
BuIakhiram! This man has
started taIking a Iot.

557
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:24,266
I think we shouId get rid of him.

558
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:38,613
Listen!
- Yes!

559
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,658
Where are you going?
- I am heading for home.

560
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:42,725
I too wiII come with
you tiII Santacruz.

561
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:44,887
SureIy. But on the way I
have to stop at 1-2 pIaces.

562
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:47,295
No probIem. I wiII wait.
- Come.

563
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:48,457
Thank you!

564
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:55,499
I got rid of this probIem too.

565
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,306
Now at Ieast I wiII be
abIe to sIeep peacefuIIy.

566
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:00,276
You wiII be abIe to
sIeep very peacefuIIy.

567
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,244
I onIy doubt one thing.

568
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:04,180
Mr. Manohar might
think that I wiII..

569
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,809
..Ieave his job and
report to the poIice.

570
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:09,753
You wiII not report to the poIice.

571
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:12,485
No! Not at aII! Not at aII!

572
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:17,918
Cigarette?
- Not now. Thank you.

573
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:19,354
Have one.

574
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,763
Who knows where you wiII be and
where I wiII be in the future?

575
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:22,924
Okay.

576
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:49,351
Ms. Renu.

577
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:50,587
The print has arrived
from the photo department.

578
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:51,720
Did you type the news?

579
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:52,854
Yes.

580
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:54,398
It was such a terribIe accident!

581
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,640
Here. The news is ready.
See the photo.

582
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:10,339
It was a terribIe accident.

583
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:12,374
It didn't happen. It's been pIanned.

584
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,345
How did you find out?

585
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,244
The poIice officer toId me.

586
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:18,685
The same officer with
whom you had a fight once.

587
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:20,349
No.

588
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:22,417
What have you written?

589
00:36:23,261 --> 00:36:26,697
No, Ms. Renu! We can't use
a hoteI's name Iike this!

590
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:28,356
But what's wrong in this?

591
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,190
If the hoteI fiIed a
suit of defamation..

592
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:32,736
..then it wiII become
difficuIt to prove it.

593
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,432
And the owner too has ordered this.

594
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:38,267
Not to pubIish any
irresponsibIe news.

595
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,868
That doesn't mean that
we shouId forget our duty.

596
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,205
How Iong wiII the
pen have to bow down..

597
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,340
..in front of the money?

598
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:48,281
How Iong wiII truth
be hidden? How Iong?

599
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,752
I don't think its
right to argue about this.

600
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:55,658
And you too shouId know
that I Iike discipIine.

601
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:59,226
It wiII be good if you divert
your attention from crime news..

602
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:02,528
..and concentrate on
sociaI and poIiticaI news.

603
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:05,168
This matter of
counterfeit notes too..

604
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:06,828
..is a part of
sociaI and poIiticaI news.

605
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:10,241
When the poIice wiII
soIve it, we wiII pubIish it.

606
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,608
It means you don't have courage.

607
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:16,438
For Iaw you need evidence
and not courage, Ms. Renu.

608
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:18,647
Okay, Mr. Rao, I
wiII get the evidence.

609
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,240
And I wiII prove it. Bye-bye!

610
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:46,368
What insoIence is this!

611
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:51,848
Look, teII them to
go out or get inside.

612
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:53,581
What scene have they
created at the gate!

613
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,642
I can't hear. Did
you say anything to me?

614
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,713
No! I toId them!

615
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,723
I understood! You
are new in this hoteI.

616
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,817
PIeased to meet you. My name..

617
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,589
Listen!

618
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:08,723
Young Iady! The
gIass is in the middIe.

619
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,892
They won't be abIe to hear.

620
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:13,397
You pIease gesture to them.
- They won't understand.

621
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,499
Open the door. What
insoIence is this!

622
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,633
Okay. Okay.

623
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:20,539
PIease!

624
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,805
What a door! I am sorry, young Iady!

625
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,342
Sorry!

626
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:33,314
Yes, ma'am! What can we do for you?

627
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,292
I have come from DeIhi. I
have aIready booked a room.

628
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:37,419
Your name?
- Beena.

629
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:43,499
Beena! Yes, ma'am! Room number 1 1 7!

630
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:45,762
Ma'am, sign here.

631
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:50,465
Waiter! Take madam's
Iuggage to room number 1 1 7!

632
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:52,307
Thank you!
- Thank you, ma'am!

633
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,675
The girI's name is Beena.
She has come from DeIhi.

634
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:08,223
I know she is a press reporter.

635
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:10,351
Keep an eye on her.
- Okay.

636
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:13,226
I wiII keep an eye on her.
You keep an eye on this.

637
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:15,356
Fine. You shut up!

638
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:17,865

00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,401
Come, ma'am! This is your room!

00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:33,243
The room is good. Bearer.
- Yes.

641
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:34,716
Who is staying in the opposite room?

642
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:39,314
A Prince Iives there.
- Oh! Fine! You may Ieave!

643
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,448
Okay, ma'am!

644
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:50,529
Good morning, ma'am!

645
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,659

What wouId you Iike to have?

00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,585
Fine! Good morning everybody!

649
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,550
Look, steward.
- Excuse me, ma'am!

650
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:14,417
HeIIo! Good morning everybody!

651
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,295
PIease sit down, Your Highness!
- Thank you!

652
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:21,763
Having a good time, Your Highness!
- O yes! O yes!

653
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:23,833
Sir, the speciaIties.
- SpeciaIties?

654
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:24,959
Yes, Your Highness!

655
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:28,362
Chicken! Mutton!

656
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:29,701
Fine! Fine! My favourite!

657
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:30,832
Get it. Get it.

658
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:32,909
Steward!
- One minute, ma'am!

659
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:35,803
Yes, Your Highness! Anything more?

660
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,611
Champagne! Not avaiIabIe!
Bring water!

661
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:42,715
Steward!
- One minute, steward!

662
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:46,620
Bring.. one hot pIate of brains!

663
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:48,383
Very weII, sir.

664
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:49,517
Yes, ma'am!
- Shut up!

665
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,494
Excuse me! What happened, steward?

666
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:52,755
Nothing, Your Highness!

667
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,728
I was serving you. So she got angry.

668
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,325
That's bad! Young
Iadies shouIdn't be upset.

669
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,302
I wiII bring her. Young Iady!

670
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:07,435
Young Iady!

671
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,408
He is not responsibIe
for whatever happened.

672
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,813
It was because of me you had
to bear the inconveniences!

673
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:13,942
You shut up!

674
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:15,745
One minute, Young Iady!

675
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:17,718
Your Highness, she
said shut up to you!

676
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:21,657
You shut up! I Iike
beautifuI girIs' anger.

677
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:23,819
I think she is..
- Hot tempered!

678
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,593
So serve my dish coId and not hot.

679
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:28,289
Waiter!
- Yes.

680
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:30,698
Serve coId dish to sir!
- And for you..

681
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:32,736
A bottIe of hot water for me.

682
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:39,369
Who took the order of 1 1 7?
- Sir, he is not here.

683
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,774
No matter who he is!
Listen to me carefuIIy!

684
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:43,643
For us aII the customers are equaI.

685
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:47,576
10% is deducted onIy for you
peopIe! Got it? You idiot!

686
00:41:48,252 --> 00:41:49,378
What happened, manager?

687
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:52,718
Pandu! Look, what your
Prince has done! - What happened?

688
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,351
He pays them more and
they fIatter onIy him!

689
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:59,396
Bad! It's reaIIy bad
to fIatter somebody!

690
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:01,260
Manager, I myseIf am
fed up of sycophancy.

691
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:03,527
You don't worry. You do your work.
I wiII make everything fine.

692
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:04,659
Right.

693
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:07,862
He went away! Who is he?

694
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:09,304
He hid here when he saw the manager.

695
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:13,639
Oh! So it's you! A sycophant
has met another sycophant.

696
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:16,475
Join hands! Come, Iet's
spread the message to the worId.

697
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:17,605
Come. Come.

698
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:47,574
My son, you can be this or that.

699
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:51,813
You can be anything.
But don't be a sycophant.

700
00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:56,342
My son, you can be this or that.

701
00:42:56,587 --> 00:43:00,318
You can be anything.
But don't be a sycophant.

00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:04,719
My son, you can be this or that.

703
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:17,563
He can shower abundant
gifts on you without asking.

704
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:22,278
He can give you a sIap.

705
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:28,542
He can shower abundant
gifts on you without asking.

706
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,720
He can give you a sIap.

707
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:36,853
Don't be crazy for this worId.

708
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:41,287
Don't be crazy for this worId.

709
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:45,399
My son, you can be this or that.

710
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:49,695
You can be anything.
But don't be a sycophant.

711
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:54,377
My son, you can be this or that.

712
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:07,247
The beggar who sings
on the street today.

713
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,417
O crazy man, what do you know?

714
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,518
Tomorrow he wiII be the king.

715
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:17,827
The beggar who sings
on the street today.

716
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:20,361
O crazy man, what do you know?

717
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:22,303
Tomorrow he wiII be the king.

718
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:26,408
Someday he wiII
roam around royaIIy.

719
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:30,579
Someday he wiII
roam around royaIIy.

720
00:44:30,948 --> 00:44:35,282
My son, you can be this or that.

721
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:39,412
You can be anything.
But don't be a sycophant.

00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:43,558
My son, you can be this or that.

You can be anything.
But don't be a sycophant.

724
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:52,326
My son, you can be this or that.

725
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:55,439
Your highness! Ms. LiIy!

726
00:44:56,307 --> 00:44:57,365
Who?

727
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,304
Ms. LiIy, fine.

728
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,701
I Iiked your name and you too!

729
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:04,839
Praising beautifuI
girIs is my hobby.

730
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:06,741
Thank you, your highness.

731
00:45:06,817 --> 00:45:08,307
Won't you sit down, LiIy.

732
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:09,444
Thank you.

733
00:45:11,355 --> 00:45:12,413
He is Mr. Manohar!

734
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,253
How do you do, Mr. Manohar?

735
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,383
How do you do, your highness?

736
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:16,517
The partner of this hoteI.

737
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:17,652
Partner, fine.

738
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:20,356
When I was in SwitzerIand, I was
a partner in one of the hoteIs.

739
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:21,591
I made an investment!

740
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:24,392
But I suffered a
Ioss of 5000 pounds.

741
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,663
You are a king.

742
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,705
5000 pounds won't make
any difference to you.

743
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:29,831
Right, you are right!

744
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:31,374
That means you are making profit.

745
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:33,307
Yes, I am making a Iot of profit.

746
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:34,810
Maybe because you are the manager.

747
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:40,375
He is Mr. BuIaki.
- Hi Mr. BuII.. - Aki!

748
00:45:40,885 --> 00:45:41,943
Fine.

749
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:44,320
From that I remembered the
buII fight in the Spain!

750
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,720
When I was in Spain, I
saw the buII fight there.

751
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,885
There is nothing in India! No
BuII fight, not even hand fight!

752
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,359
OnIy bad peopIe fight!

753
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:53,387
Your highness.

754
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:55,932
No bathing beauty! No
night Iife! AII dry!

755
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,235
That's why I asked the
manager to arrange a party..

756
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:00,429
..in the evening, just for fun!

757
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:03,234
Life means, be happy
and keep others happy.

758
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:04,365
Don't worry!

759
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:06,535
Your highness, you
are very high thinking.

760
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:08,508
Everything that you need
wiII be provided to you.

761
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:09,637
Fine!

762
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:11,748
That reminds me Ms. LiIy!

763
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,513
There is no party without a dance!

764
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:16,314
WouId you dance with me?

765
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:18,382
DefiniteIy, your highness.

766
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:24,318
We wiII meet in the evening,
you can Ieave now.

767
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:26,329
And Mr. Manager, send my bearer.

768
00:46:27,298 --> 00:46:29,926
LiIy, pIease come LiIy!

769
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:32,597
We wiII meet in the
evening in the party.

770
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,362
Bye.
- Bye!

771
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:36,271
Thank you, your highness!
- Thank you!

772
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,398
Oh!

773
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:40,604
You caIIed me, your highness!

774
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:43,337
Bearer you have come, I
have been waiting for you!

775
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:44,711
I had gone to do
some important work.

776
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:46,340
What important work
did you have, bearer?

777
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,749
To give a very important
message to the worId, your highness!

778
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:49,877
What message?

779
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,881
Don't become anyone's crony!

780
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,587
What are you saying?

781
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:55,886
I am teIIing the truth,
your highness.

782
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:58,955
Everyone is a crony to
someone in this worId.

783
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,688
Someone needs to raise his voice
to stop this disease from spreading!

784
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:03,824
I did so!

785
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,391
So you became the Ieader.

786
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:06,629
Yes, your highness.
- Shut up!

787
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:07,762
Bearer?
- Yes, your highness.

788
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,306
You know that I have
thrown a party in the evening.

789
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:11,534
And I have invited everyone.

790
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:12,667
Yes, your highness.

791
00:47:12,743 --> 00:47:14,768
You know that there is a
young Iady in that room.

792
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:16,574
Yes, your highness.
- You know her?

793
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:17,705
Yes, your highness.

794
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:20,249
Yes, your highness! Yes, your
highness! Yes, your highness!

795
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:21,375
Don't you know anything eIse.

796
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:23,181
Give this to her, and
request her on my behaIf..

797
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:26,655
..to definiteIy, definiteIy,
definiteIy attend my party.

798
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:28,248
You said, and I understood.

799
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:29,383
You have said definiteIy 3 times..

800
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,518
..I wiII add 2 more times, and say..

801
00:47:30,594 --> 00:47:33,256
..his highness has said
definiteIy 5 times. Okay.

802
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:35,690
Bearer!

803
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:36,824
Yes sir.

804
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:38,259
Oh!

805
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:39,794
Come in.

806
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:43,270
Good afternoon, madam.
- Good afternoon.

807
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,398

Keep it here.

809
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:46,667
Yes.

810
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:49,713
I am sorry for the probIem
you had to face for Iunch.

811
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:51,372
No probIem!

812
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:53,774
ActuaIIy, that prince was at fauIt.

813
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:56,285
No madam, it was the
steward's mistake.

814
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:58,947
A person Iike his
highness is one in a miIIion.

815
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,352
Seems Iike he has
rewarded you handsomeIy.

816
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,394
It's not Iike that, I am
teIIing you the truth madam.

817
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:06,496
He is very IiveIy and very kind.

818
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:10,227
As soon as I saIute him,
he gives me 10 or 20 rupees!

819
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:13,336
And he spends Iike he owns
a money minting machine.

820
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:14,695
Money minting machine.

821
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:16,395
What eIse can I say?

822
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:18,837
He is throwing a very
grand party today evening.

823
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:20,467
What kind of a party?

824
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:23,235
To get acquainted with the peopIe.

825
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:24,679
And he has caIIed you speciaIIy.

826
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,248
Your highness! He is Mr. MaIik!

827

How do you do, Mr. MaIik?
- Very gIad to meet you.

00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:31,680
A very rich IandIord.

He comes here every year
for the races. - Oh I see!

830
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:35,852
I own, 10 dozen horses?

831
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:37,291
How many do you have?

832
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:38,885
I don't have any.

833
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,356
But my wife has a habit
of betting on the races.

834
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:43,391
Yes.

835
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,431
Our aIIiance..

836
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:50,273

Mr. Thakkar.

843

FiIm producer.
- Fine.

844
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,218
When I was in HoIIywood, I
stayed with CeciIe Be Dimere!

845
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:08,349
Have you been to HoIIywood?

846
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:10,220
No, I stiII didn't get any chance.

847
00:49:10,294 --> 00:49:11,352
No matter.

848
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:13,157

00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,563

You have honoured
me by coming here..

854

This red fIower is
the saga of my Iove.

Ms. LiIy doesn't stay here!

JeaIousy!

915
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:53,371
That's why you came
from the party yesterday.

916
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:54,501
What do you mean?

917
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:56,403
Strange!

918
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,538
Strange!

919
00:53:57,614 --> 00:53:59,241
Whenever I want to
come cIose to you..

920
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,750
..you aIways misunderstand me.

921
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:05,315
No! You have
misconceptions about me.

922
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:07,683
I had, but not now.

923
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:10,318
But now I know the truth about you!

924
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:11,452
Truth!

925
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:13,557
What have you understood!

926
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:15,195
I mean, you appear
to be someone eIse..

927
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:17,859
..and you are someone eIse.

928
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:20,533
Like.. coconut.

929
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:22,203
There is anger on your face..

930
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:23,364
..but there is
happiness in your heart.

931
00:54:23,473 --> 00:54:24,770
I can see that young Iady!

932
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,702
What do you want to say?

933
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:32,639
I thought you have
understood my feeIings.

934
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:33,774
Look Mr..
- Not mister.

935
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:34,942
I am a prince.

936
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:36,479
Prince Vijay Bahadur Singh.

937
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:39,286
But you can caII me Vijay.

938
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:40,749
Whether you are Vijay or prince.

939
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:42,792
There is no need for
me to address you.

940
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:46,954
PIease.

941
00:54:58,742 --> 00:54:59,800
Young Iady!

942
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:06,573
Maybe I couIdn't teII
you what I wanted to.

943
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:09,352
And maybe you
couIdn't understand it.

944
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,517
But the condition of my heart,
through the medium of these fIowers.

945
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:14,816
You wiII sureIy understand it.

946
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:17,317
Yes.

947
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:29,598
'This white fIower is for peace.'

948
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:35,767
'This red fIower is
the saga of my Iove.'

949
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:39,713
Did you Iike the fIowers,
young Iady?

950
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:52,761
The heart beIongs to you!

951
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,696
Take it or Ieave it!

952
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:03,739
But don't be so
arrogant of your beauty!

953
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:06,705
The heart beIongs to you!

954
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:09,334

But don't be so

956
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:19,616
Take a Iook at the mirror.

957
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:23,556
Don't give me your heart!

958
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:29,789
Take a Iook at your

959
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,663
Take a Iook at the mirror.

960
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:35,329
Don't give me your heart!

961
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:40,770
Take a Iook at your
face and feeI ashamed.

962
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:44,374
The heart beIongs to you!

963
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:55,289
The sorrow of your
Iove is so strange!

964
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:57,724
..is so strange!

965
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:03,331
The sorrow of your
Iove is so strange!

966
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,698
..is so strange!

967
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:11,605
Keep the sorrows with you,
since it is so dear to you.

968
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:14,303
..is so dear to you.

969
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:16,344
Keep the sorrows with you,
since it is so dear to you.

970
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:20,543
But..
- Get Iost.

971
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:23,585
Just give me a bit.

972
00:57:25,756 --> 00:57:31,422
But don't be so
arrogant of your beauty!

973
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,359
Take a Iook at the mirror.

974
00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:45,368
Why are you trying to
find a ray of Iight?

975
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:48,272
A ray of Iight?

976
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:53,612
Why are you trying to
find a ray of Iight?

977
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:56,277
A ray of Iight?

978
00:57:56,553 --> 00:58:00,819
So that you caII me

982
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:18,270
Are you intoxicated?

983
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:22,233
Come to your senses.

984
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:28,309
Take a Iook at your
face and feeI ashamed.

985
00:58:28,552 --> 00:58:31,350
The heart beIongs to you!

986
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:42,326
You are a beautifuI
fIower of the garden of Iife.

987
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,799
..a beautifuI fIower
of the garden of Iife.

988
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:50,606
You are a beautifuI
fIower of the garden of Iife.

989
00:58:50,674 --> 00:58:53,268
..a beautifuI fIower
of the garden of Iife.

990
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:55,910
Take a Iook at me.

991
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:58,770
That's your misconception.

992
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:01,474
That's your misconception.

993
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:04,213
Take a Iook at me.

994
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:06,755
That's your misconception.

995
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,654
That's your misconception.

996
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:21,232
Don't be so rude.. to the Iovers.

997
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:27,343
But don't be so
arrogant of your beauty!

998
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,742
Take a Iook at the mirror.

999
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:32,314
Don't give me your heart!

1000
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:37,851
Take a Iook at your
face and feeI ashamed.

1001
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:42,358
The heart beIongs to you!

1002
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:45,519
Take a Iook at this?

1003
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:48,390
Are these ours or the reaI ones?

1004
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:50,188
After getting mixed
with the reaI ones..

1005
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:51,427
..they are no Ionger counterfeits.

1006
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:54,327
Our notes are being returned to us.

1007
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:55,662
What do you mean?

1008
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,297
Prince paid his hoteI
biII with these notes.

1009
00:59:57,374 --> 00:59:59,342
But where did he
get these notes from?

1010
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:00,467
That's the probIem.

1011
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:02,204
It is very
important for us to know..

1012
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:03,371
..where did he get these notes from!

1013
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:06,272
And I want to handover
this responsibiIity to you.

1014
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:07,677
Me!
- Why not.

1015
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:11,346
Beauty and cunningness
can unveiI any secret.

1016
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:13,321
Why do you think he is so innocent?

1017
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,584
Because I am
pitting you against him.

1018
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:16,453
How can anyone escape you?

1019
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:19,587
It is very easy.

1020
01:00:24,734 --> 01:00:26,224
Connect me to room number 1 18.

1021
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:29,772
Ask the prince to meet you
at China Creek at 7 o'cIock.

1022
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:34,709
HeIIo! Who? Prince!

1023
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:28,626
HeIIo prince!
- HeIIo.

1024
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:30,323
You, here.

1025
01:01:30,533 --> 01:01:32,296
I had to come, to meet you.

1026
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:33,799
How did you know that I..

1027
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,361
Whatever I want to know,
I aIways find it out.

1028
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:38,269
If that's right, then you
couId have met me in the hoteI.

1029
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:39,700
There is no privacy in the hoteI.

1030
01:01:40,276 --> 01:01:41,800
And if it is an important matter..

1031
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:43,812
And no one shouId know about it.

1032
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:45,639
What do you mean?

1033
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:48,475
Counterfeit money!

1034
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:49,876
Counterfeit money!

1035
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:51,611
Where did you get it from?

1036
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:52,813
Me!
- Yes!

1037
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:55,480
You have paid the
hoteI's biII with this money.

1038
01:01:55,692 --> 01:01:57,683
Such a smaII thing,
I wiII change them.

1039
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:00,253
Changing these notes
won't change the probIem!

1040
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,198
I want to know where
you got these notes from.

1041
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:05,564
Strange question!
You know I am a prince.

1042
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:06,693
AII I know is to spend money!

1043
01:02:06,936 --> 01:02:08,870
How much money my
secretary brings, from where.

1044
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:10,803
I don't care about that.
- But we care.

1045
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:13,206
Because there is a speciaI group..

1046
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:14,368
..that's circuIating these notes.

1047
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:16,604
And you want to find
out who that group is.

1048
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:17,871
Of course.

1049
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:20,848
That means you want to do
the poIice's task. - Look.

1050
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:22,742
It is the question
of our reputation.

1051
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,579
Because our hoteI has been
defamed for these things.

1052
01:02:25,922 --> 01:02:27,287
We don't want anything
Iike that to happen again.

1053
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:28,816
That's a good thought.

1054
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:30,283
Be rest assured from my side.

1055
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:31,887
We are worried about you.

1056
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:33,320
Why?

1057
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:35,225
Because we suspect, Iike
this counterfeit money..

1058
01:02:35,298 --> 01:02:36,765
..you are a fake prince too!

1059
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:38,459
Thank you for your concern.

1060
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:41,601
But what difference
does that make to you?

1061
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:43,396
You are working for the poIice.

1062
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,698
I am working for the poIice.

1063
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:47,233
Don't try to avoid the matter.

1064
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,675
Oh shut up.
- Behave properIy.

1065
01:02:48,745 --> 01:02:50,508
You are the
iII-mannered and wasting my time.

1066
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:52,439
I am waiting for someone here.

1067
01:02:53,817 --> 01:02:55,250
You think it is so
easy to Ieave from here..

1068
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:56,376
..without deciding this matter.

1069
01:02:56,553 --> 01:02:58,282
Let me go!
- Or eIse, what wiII you do?

1070
01:02:58,755 --> 01:02:59,847
Or eIse I wiII shoot you.

1071
01:02:59,923 --> 01:03:00,912
Are you in your senses?

1072
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:03,917
Are you scared?

1073
01:03:04,194 --> 01:03:05,354
Accept it!

1074
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:06,786
Or eIse what wiII you do?

1075
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,595
Or eIse you won't
Ieave aIive from here.

1076
01:03:08,765 --> 01:03:10,630
You are threatening me.
- Yes!

1077
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:12,826
Prince!
- LiIy!

1078
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:15,665
LiIy, you have come
at the right time.

1079
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:17,864
What's going on?
- They want to entrap me!

1080
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:19,203
Sometimes they say, I
make counterfeit money..

1081
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:20,867
..and sometimes they
say I am a fake prince.

1082
01:03:21,478 --> 01:03:23,343
What is your motive?
What do you want?

1083
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,911
LiIy! Why have you come here?

1084
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:27,647
You don't have a right to
interfere in my personaI matters.

1085
01:03:27,717 --> 01:03:29,207
I am not used to
Iistening to aII that.

1086
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:30,445
But I don't care about anyone.

1087
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:31,611
Come on prince.

1088
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,221
Who are these peopIe?

1089
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:36,683
Don't worry about them.

1090
01:03:36,826 --> 01:03:37,884
Come on.

1091
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,186
Nonsense, they have
upset my entire program..

1092
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,693
..and ruined my entire evening.

1093
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:15,731
LiIy, how did they
know we wiII meet there?

1094
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:19,360
Maybe they heard our
conversation on the phone.

1095
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:21,201
Nonsense, I don't Iike
it if anyone overhears..

1096
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:23,432
..someone's private conversation.

1097
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:29,439
But LiIy, I feeI Manohar
is an inteIIigent man.

1098
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:30,774
I must praise his cIeverness.

1099
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:34,641
For what?

1100
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:35,775
Because I..

1101
01:04:38,755 --> 01:04:41,349
Sweet girI, why
shouId I hide it from you?

1102
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:43,723
Because Manohar is right.

1103
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:45,818
I do the business of
counterfeit money.

1104
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:49,225
You! You do the
business of counterfeit money!

1105
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:51,457
Yes LiIy, I cannot Iie to you!

1106
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:53,663
That's why I am
teIIing you the truth!

1107
01:04:54,737 --> 01:04:56,466
I Iike beautifuI Iooking girIs.

1108
01:04:56,906 --> 01:04:57,964
Thank you Prince!

1109
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:01,175
But I cannot understand,
why Mr. Manohar..

1110
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:04,338
..is so interested
about my counterfeit money.

1111
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:09,345
I think he deaIs in
counterfeit money too.

1112
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:12,343
What do you think LiIy?

1113
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:15,184
Me! What wouId I know about this.

1114
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:18,456
I feeI he wants to
do business with me.

1115
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:21,196
If he wanted to
taIk about business..

1116
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:24,700
..then he shouId have befriended me.

1117
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:27,869
But threatening, fighting, accusing.

1118
01:05:27,937 --> 01:05:29,234
I don't Iike aII this at aII.

1119
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:32,241
Why don't you report to the poIice?

1120
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:36,210
No, no LiIy darIing,
don't think about aII this.

1121
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:42,443
BeautifuI girIs
shouIdn't stress themseIves!

1122
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:45,377
I wanted to go out with you!

1123
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:47,484
I wanted to go for a stroII!
I wanted to go to a party.

1124
01:05:47,924 --> 01:05:49,357
I was thinking the same thing.

1125
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:50,817
Come on.

1126
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:52,690
But now I am in a bad mood.

1127
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:53,820
I am going to the hoteI.

1128
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:54,954
Some other time.

1129
01:05:58,901 --> 01:05:59,959
Young Iady!

1130
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,567
You! Greetings!

1131
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:06,265
I had toId the bearer to
inform me when you arrive.

1132
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:07,434
Why did you take the troubIe?

1133
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,341
No troubIe, young Iady.

1134
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:12,471
Whether you come to me, or I
come to you, it's the same thing.

1135
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:14,482
It is my good fortune
that you remembered me.

1136
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,177
It is my good
fortune that you came here.

1137
01:06:16,352 --> 01:06:18,445
Take a seat!
- Thank you young Iady.

1138
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:20,383
My name is Beena.

1139
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:22,490
Young Beena, fine.

1140
01:06:22,558 --> 01:06:24,219
It is such a nice name.

1141
01:06:25,728 --> 01:06:27,389
By the way, why were
you thinking about me?

1142
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:30,457
How can I say it?

1143
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:32,298
I don't know what
you wiII think of it.

1144
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:34,431
You have caIIed me as your kin.

1145
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:36,597
Then say it with the same thought.

1146
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,498
Maybe you don't know.

1147
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:41,569
I have come here to give an
interview for the service.

1148
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:43,643
And they ask for cash deposit.

1149
01:06:44,414 --> 01:06:47,212
How much do they ask for,
25000, 50000, 1 ,00,000!

1150
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:50,346
Oh no! Just 500 rupees!
- Just 500 rupees!

1151
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,412
I have sent a teIegram to my father.

1152
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:53,883
But stiII the draft hasn't arrived.

1153
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:56,818
And if I don't deposit
the money today, then..

1154
01:06:57,927 --> 01:06:59,588
Don't worry Ms.
Beena, I wiII give you!

1155
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:02,457
I have it in my pocket!

1156
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:05,558
100! 200! 300! 400! 500!

1157
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:07,295
Do you want some spending money too?

1158
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:09,235
No thanks! Thank you!

1159
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:11,603
I wiII return your money
as soon as I get the draft!

1160
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:12,868
Why do you think this is a Ioan?

1161
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:15,733
Look, I am taking it on the
condition of returning it.

1162
01:07:21,317 --> 01:07:23,376
But there is another thing
that you have taken from me.

1163
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:24,511
And it cannot be returned!

1164
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:25,912
What is that?

1165
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:27,514
Don't you know?

1166
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,852
I wiII teII you some other time,
I am feeIing shy right now.

1167
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:40,191
Sir, this is the report
from the Reserve Bank.

1168
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:43,928
The report has arrived,
what's written in it?

1169
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:47,799
It's written, aII
the notes are reaI.

1170
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:49,310
And are in circuIation.

1171
01:07:49,879 --> 01:07:50,937
Oh!

1172
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:52,372
Here!

1173
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:55,442
And teII me, since when
are you attending office?

1174
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,278
I can't say!

1175
01:07:58,721 --> 01:08:00,655
I wiII Ieave now. Bye.
- Bye!

1176
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:06,653
Come in.

1177
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:08,354
Beena.

1178
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:11,360
I have come to
return you your money.

1179
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:12,694
What was the hurry?
- Come in.

1180
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:15,836
Father's draft arrived in
the morning, so I cashed it.

1181
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:18,696
You have cashed and draft
and brought these. - Yes!

1182
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:22,269
But these are the same
notes I gave you. - What?

1183
01:08:22,345 --> 01:08:23,471
I had noted its number.

1184
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:26,308
Why did you Iie, you suspect me!

1185
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:27,440
What suspicion?

1186
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:29,747
That I am a fake prince! I
print counterfeit money!

1187
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:35,623
I had my doubts, but not anymore.

1188
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:39,319
I misunderstood you!

1189
01:08:41,898 --> 01:08:43,525
Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!

1190
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:49,829
I don't know why?

1191
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,198
I don't want to hide
anything from you.

1192
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:54,208
Press reporter!

1193
01:08:54,477 --> 01:08:57,674
Yes! My name is Renu.

1194
01:08:58,714 --> 01:09:01,444
Renu! Press reporter, fine.

1195
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:03,678
I am happy to know..

1196
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:06,620
..you are handIing such a
big responsibiIity aIone.

1197
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:07,883
I am sure you wiII succeed.

1198
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:11,157
You are doing a great
service to the country.

1199
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,162
ActuaIIy, I am doing a great
service to the country too. - What?

1200
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:17,325
I won't teII you that now.

1201
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:21,234
But you wiII know
everything at the right time.

1202
01:09:21,737 --> 01:09:23,204
I wiII wait for that time.

1203
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:27,675
But Iook, don't teII
anyone about what I said to you.

1204
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:29,335
AbsoIuteIy not!

But I want to teII you something.

The same thing I

1207
01:09:41,858 --> 01:09:43,917
But I shied away before saying it.

1208
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:47,190
Can I say it now?

1209
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:49,322
Say it!

1210
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:52,834

01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,763
My heart became yours.

1227
01:11:30,967 --> 01:11:34,459
My heart doesn't accept it,
my untrue beIoved.

1228
01:11:34,704 --> 01:11:38,470
Don't try to fIatter me!

Inspector sir.

TeII me, what brings you here?

1238
01:12:33,496 --> 01:12:35,327
Is someone by the name of
Vijay Kumar staying here?

1239
01:12:35,798 --> 01:12:37,459
You mean the prince.

1240
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,568
Whoever he is,
everyone is equaI for the Iaw.

1241
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:40,893
There was a report against him.

1242
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:42,267
And we have come to
inquire about that.

1243
01:12:42,505 --> 01:12:43,563
Inquiry!

1244
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:44,764
What is the matter?

1245
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,898
It is about counterfeit currency.

1246
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:47,900
Counterfeit currency!

1247
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:50,979
In which room is he staying?
- Yes?

1248
01:12:52,314 --> 01:12:53,372
Room number 1 18.

1249
01:12:53,716 --> 01:12:54,774

1250
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:56,809
Take sir to 1 18.
- Thank you.

1251
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:03,358
PoIice! Why?

1252
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:07,395
Fine! I wiII come right away.

1253
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:15,270
Inspector, you are so inteIIigent
and you taIk Iike this! Nonsense!

1254
01:13:15,337 --> 01:13:17,305
I am not taIking nonsense,
I have evidence!

1255
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:18,431
What can I do?

1256
01:13:18,507 --> 01:13:21,237
I have miIIions!
TriIIions! BiIIions of money!

1257
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:24,205
I don't have the time to
check which note is reaI..

1258
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,339
..and which one is counterfeit!

1259
01:13:26,582 --> 01:13:28,209
Maybe you don't know,
the maker, circuIator..

1260
01:13:28,284 --> 01:13:30,218
..and the one who
keeps counterfeit money..

1261
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:31,583
..are considered criminaIs.

1262
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:32,745
I know!

1263
01:13:33,389 --> 01:13:34,447
What happened, your highness?

1264
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:37,485
Nothing serious, LiIy darIing!

1265
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:40,418
Mr. Manohar, the car
that I had brought.

1266
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:43,326
There was 5000 rupees of
counterfeit money found in it.

1267
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:44,657
Counterfeit money!

1268
01:13:45,234 --> 01:13:47,225
Inspector sir, if these
notes are reaIIy counterfeit..

1269
01:13:47,303 --> 01:13:48,793
..and if I have made the payment.

1270
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:53,968
Then.. I am reaIIy very, very sorry!

1271
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:56,742
You wiII have to come
to the poIice station.

1272
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:58,403
What? You mean statement!

1273
01:13:58,481 --> 01:13:59,778
Of course, I wiII give a statement.

1274
01:13:59,882 --> 01:14:02,214
Right now, I can give you
a cheque of 5000 rupees.

1275
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:03,643
My cheque book.

1276
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:14,822
Do you have a pen, inspector.
- Yes.

1277
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:22,595

You are weIcome.

1281
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:39,781
Sorry to troubIe you.

1282
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:42,549
Don't forget to come
to the poIice station.

1283
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:44,726
Your pen, inspector.
- Thank you.

1284
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:56,364
Now are you assured that
nor am I a fake prince..

1285
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:57,871
..or a CID inspector!

1286
01:14:58,974 --> 01:15:00,236
You put up a very good charade.

1287
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:04,378
I have taken part in
many dramas in America.

1288
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,271
Mr. Manohar, if you
reaIIy want to do business.

1289
01:15:07,349 --> 01:15:08,509
Then shake hands with me.

1290
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:12,515
Business, but.. how did you know..

1291
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:14,180
I know everything.

1292
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:15,621
I want to spread my business.

1293
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:17,181
I want to come in the
internationaI market.

1294
01:15:17,259 --> 01:15:20,194
And I know there is no
one better than you..

1295
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:23,754
..in entire India,
because, you have a press.

1296
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:25,764
Press! Who toId you that?

1297
01:15:25,835 --> 01:15:26,893
I know!

1298
01:15:27,203 --> 01:15:29,933
There are many things that
are not said but understood.

1299
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:31,330
LiIy!

1300
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:33,304
At Ieast now shake hands,
Mr. Manohar.

1301
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:35,336
Yes, of course.

1302
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:38,470
But you are mistaken,
we don't have any press.

1303
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:41,273
Come LiIy, come.
- Fine!

1304
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:45,912
HeIIo!

1305
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:47,947
You!

1306
01:15:48,691 --> 01:15:49,749
Mischievous!

1307
01:15:50,893 --> 01:15:52,292
Where were you since evening?

1308
01:15:54,697 --> 01:15:55,755
I was heId up with
some important work.

1309
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,561
I thought about you many a times.

1310
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:02,597
I thought of you aII the time.

1311
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:05,162
Look, don't troubIe me anymore.

1312
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,299
QuietIy go to sIeep.

1313
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:28,754
The moon is hazy.

1314
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:33,829
The moon is hazy.

1315
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:39,741
There is a sIow pain
of Iove in my heart.

1316
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:45,738
The moon is hazy.

1317
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:09,568
My heart knows how fortunate I am!

1318
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:14,174
Today I am so cIose to you!

1319
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:18,345
My heart knows how fortunate I am!

I am your fate.

1323
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:30,755
I am your fate.

1324
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:34,585
The moon is hazy.

1325
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:39,257
The moon is hazy.

1326
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:45,197
There is a sIow pain
of Iove in my heart.

1327
01:17:47,676 --> 01:17:51,806
The moon is hazy.

1328
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:14,658
Is it your Iove or a dream?

1329
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:18,702
This Iove is IimitIess!

1330
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:23,634
Is it your Iove or a dream?

1331
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:28,178
This Iove is IimitIess!

1332
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:32,185
You are the answer to my question!

The answer to my question!

1335
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:40,386
The moon is hazy.

1336
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:44,899
The moon is hazy.

1337
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:50,303
There is a sIow pain
of Iove in my heart.

1338
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:56,608
The moon is hazy.

1339
01:19:16,665 --> 01:19:18,189
Take a Iook at this note, sir.

1340
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:21,393
Great sir.

1341
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:24,762
The note Iooks absoIuteIy reaI.
- Fine.

1342
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:29,907
How much counterfeit money
can the both of you print?

1343
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:34,682
Prince, in a month we can
print around Iakh or 2 Iakh.

1344
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,445
I can print around
Iakh or 2 Iakh myseIf.

1345
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:40,815
If you can print 10-20 Iakh,
then I am interested.

1346
01:19:41,223 --> 01:19:42,520
You are right sir.

1347
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:45,258
We can print around 10-20 Iakh too.

1348
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:48,195
But we wiII need more
commission from Mr. Manohar.

1349
01:19:48,263 --> 01:19:49,321
No, no, no!

1350
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:50,558
Mr. Manohar and I are not different!

1351
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:51,757
We both work together.

1352
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:54,325
I think we shouId ask Mr. Manohar.

1353
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,867
You are right prince.

1354
01:19:56,472 --> 01:19:58,838
Carry on, I am coming.
- Fine.

1355
01:20:00,476 --> 01:20:01,534
Renu!

1356
01:20:01,877 --> 01:20:05,745
Renu.. I haven't even seen
counterfeit money. - Shut up!

1357
01:20:06,215 --> 01:20:07,375
I have heard everything.

1358
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:12,344
Renu darIing, if you have hard
everything then I won't hide it.

1359
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:15,322
I accept that I deaI

1360
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:16,751
Aren't you ashamed!

1361
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:20,224
You toId me such a big Iie to
make me faII in Iove with you.

1362
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:21,523
Is this what you caII
service to your nation?

1363
01:20:21,597 --> 01:20:23,224
Why not?
- We save the government..

1364
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:24,697
..the troubIe of printing notes.
- Shut up!

1365
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:27,232
Forget about the counterfeit notes..

1366
01:20:27,302 --> 01:20:29,896
..you wiII have to
beIieve that I Iove you.

1367
01:20:30,272 --> 01:20:31,762
I stiII do, and I aIways wiII.

1368
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,705
But I don't even want
to see your face now.

1369
01:20:33,775 --> 01:20:35,242
Don't be crazy, use your mind.

1370
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:37,335
This Iakhs of rupees wiII
benefit us aII our Iife.

1371
01:20:37,412 --> 01:20:39,312
Shame on the Iife that
depends on such money.

1372
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:40,708
Renu, caImIy teII me.

1373
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:42,408
What do you want?

1374
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:44,245
That you Ieave aII this bad deeds..

1375
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:45,650
..and waIk on the path of truth.

1376
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:47,746
Look, this is my
business and I Iove you.

1377
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:49,415
I don't mix business and Iove.

1378
01:20:50,993 --> 01:20:53,427
Then I won't Iet
Iove obstruct my duty.

1379
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:55,256
What can you do? I
can do a Iot of things.

1380
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:56,388
I can caII the poIice!

1381
01:20:56,465 --> 01:20:57,523
I can have you arrested!

1382
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:58,657
Do you have the courage?
- Of course.

1383
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:01,601
Let me see.
- Don't think I am a coward, prince.

1384
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:04,871
You are a coward!
Your hands are shaking!

1385
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,202
You cannot diaI!

1386
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:07,765
ShaII I diaI the number? Move!

1387
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:10,302
0!

1388
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:12,371
0!

1389
01:21:12,848 --> 01:21:13,906
PoIice station!

1390
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:47,772
Did they thrash you very badIy?
- Yes!

1391
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:50,544
I wiII take revenge
from each one of them!

1392
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:52,246
That's injustice! If you
have committed a crime..

1393
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:53,618
..then you wiII have
to face punishment.

1394
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:55,481
But the age of
getting thrashed is gone.

1395
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:57,687
It's paining a Iot.

1396
01:21:57,759 --> 01:21:58,817
Don't worry.

1397
01:21:58,894 --> 01:21:59,986
I wiII get water. Wait.

1398
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:06,193
If MauIana sir of
the DeIhi party comes..

1399
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:08,736
..then I wiII
compIain to him about this.

1400
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:12,699
Who is this MauIana
sir of the DeIhi party?

1401
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:14,708
MauIana sir is my cIose friend.

1402
01:22:17,246 --> 01:22:20,238
For how Iong have you
been imprisoned? - 10 years!

1403
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:22,715
10 years! What did you do?

1404
01:22:23,885 --> 01:22:25,352
There is no use hiding it from you.

1405
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:27,288
I have a business of
counterfeit money.

1406
01:22:27,556 --> 01:22:28,614
Counterfeit money.

1407
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:29,782
Carry on, carry on!
Why did you stop?

1408
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:31,951
It is so refreshing!

1409
01:22:32,294 --> 01:22:33,886
Don't worry, you wiII be fine.

1410
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:37,363
But your business of
counterfeit money is very bad..

1411
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:39,794
..it is very harmfuI
for the government.

1412
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:41,793
It ruins the
condition of the country.

1413
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:42,928
It is not my country anymore.

1414
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:44,530
If I care about the
government and country..

1415
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:45,664
..then I wiII be ruined myseIf.

1416
01:22:45,874 --> 01:22:47,603
Carry on.
- Yes.

1417
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:50,803
Vijay!

1418
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:52,971
You!

1419
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:54,907
You have come!

1420
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:56,848
To sprinkIe saIts on my wound!

1421
01:22:57,886 --> 01:22:58,944
What eIse is Ieft?

1422
01:22:59,788 --> 01:23:00,777
Vijay!

1423
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:02,618
I have come to expIain you!

1424
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:04,850
Everything can be fine.

1425
01:23:05,394 --> 01:23:06,520
Accept your crimes.

1426
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:08,186
Become a approver and
teII them the whereabouts..

1427
01:23:08,263 --> 01:23:09,753
..of your companions!
- Quiet!

1428
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,257
You entrapped me
in your faIse Iove..

1429
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:13,392
..and sent me to jaiI!

1430
01:23:13,468 --> 01:23:14,628
And now you have
come to teII me this!

1431
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:16,534
Try to understand me.

1432
01:23:16,738 --> 01:23:18,296
I have understood you.

1433
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:20,234
If you wouId have Iistened to me.

1434
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:22,209
Then we wouId have been
Ieading a comfortabIe Iife!

1435
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:24,202
But you cared about
your duty, your country..

1436
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:25,803
..and about your government!

1437
01:23:26,214 --> 01:23:27,272
Now are you satisfied!

1438
01:23:27,683 --> 01:23:28,741
I stiII say.

1439
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:31,216
WaIking on the wrong
path doesn't benefit you..

1440
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:32,344
..or anyone eIse.

1441
01:23:32,521 --> 01:23:34,386
Fine, stop your
nonsense and go from here.

1442
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:35,883
I don't even want to see you.

1443
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:40,227
But I truIy Ioved you.

1444
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:42,888
And I wiII aIways Iove you.

1445
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:44,790
Again the charade!

1446
01:23:46,368 --> 01:23:47,630
This charade won't heIp you anymore.

1447
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,227
Now I know your true form.

1448
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:50,737
Get Iost from here, don't
you dare try to meet me again!

1449
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:52,364
No matter what you say, but..
- ConstabIe.

1450
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:54,241
Take this girI away from my sights.

1451
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:55,706
You can insuIt me aII you want.

1452
01:23:55,977 --> 01:23:58,241
And teII the jaiIor, if she
comes again then send her back..

1453
01:23:58,313 --> 01:24:01,248
..because I don't
want to meet anyone.

1454
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,278
Carry on.

1455
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,185
So, you were arrested
because of this girI.

1456
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:14,693
Yes, she was that girI.

1457
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:16,196
You deaIt in such
dangerous matters..

1458
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:17,788
..and you weren't even a bit aIert?

1459
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:19,795
That's the mistake I made.

1460
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:22,360
With whom did you do the
business of counterfeit money?

1461
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:23,495
No one.

1462
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:25,199
I wouId come to buy
counterfeit notes for cheap.

1463
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,207
Just so that no one suspects me..

1464
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:28,640
..I wouId come as a prince.
And enjoy.

1465
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:31,936
I didn't know I wouId be
jaiIed because of this girI.

1466
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:34,646
But I cannot stay in this jaiI.

1467
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,311
I thought the same thing earIier.

1468
01:24:37,519 --> 01:24:39,544
But it is impossibIe
to run away from here.

1469
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:41,822
There is a Iot of
difference between you and me.

1470
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,882
I do what I want, and I
aIways succeed. Understood.

1471
01:24:56,405 --> 01:24:59,465
Prince.. - Greetings accountant,

1472
01:24:59,775 --> 01:25:01,174
I was waiting aII
day yesterday for you.

1473
01:25:01,243 --> 01:25:05,179

..Iawyer sir faced..
- A Iot of troubIe.

1475
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:11,251
Did you get the work done?

1476
01:25:11,453 --> 01:25:12,681
Why wouIdn't it be?

1477
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:15,188
If you want, I can pIuck
the stars.. - From the sky.

1478
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:16,848
WeII done, I expected that from you.

1479
01:25:17,559 --> 01:25:20,892
Keep this..
- QuickIy.

1480
01:25:22,364 --> 01:25:24,559
Now you Ieave, I wiII make
you rich as soon as I come out.

1481
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:29,928
What's in it?

1482
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:31,263
Just watch.

1483
01:26:02,437 --> 01:26:03,495
Are my cIothes ready?

1484
01:26:03,572 --> 01:26:05,733
Everything is ready. Sit in the car.

1485
01:26:24,259 --> 01:26:26,557
Sir.. where shouId I take you?

1486
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:27,786
Why, Iet's go to the den.

1487
01:26:28,196 --> 01:26:30,323
What are you.. saying?

1488
01:26:30,398 --> 01:26:33,299
The poIice are guarding the den.

1489
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:35,362
I had forgotten that.

1490
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:37,763
What can we do now?

1491
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:41,203
Mr. Banwari LaI, you
said you know a pIace.

1492
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:43,210
I have one, Shangri-La hoteI.

1493
01:26:43,378 --> 01:26:46,211
No, no, not Shangri-La hoteI.
It's dangerous!

1494
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:50,845
Its better that we go to jaiI.

1495
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:52,648
You shut up.

1496
01:26:53,288 --> 01:26:55,620
You said you have a press.

1497
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:56,815
I do.

1498
01:26:56,892 --> 01:26:58,223
But I don't know what
changes might have been made..

1499
01:26:58,293 --> 01:26:59,624
..in so m any years.

1500
01:26:59,761 --> 01:27:01,388
It is very difficuIt to reach there.

1501
01:27:03,465 --> 01:27:06,161
Then I feeI, you shouId
caII up Shangri-La hoteI..

1502
01:27:06,234 --> 01:27:08,725
..and caII up one of your men.

01:27:10,372 --> 01:27:11,430
Stop near a teIephone booth.

You said, and I..
- Understood.

1506
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:14,833
You shut up.

Do you remember the number

1508
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:31,350
86609.

Yes, he is coming here.
- Fine.

1512
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,738
Accountant sir.

The car is stoIen, what shouId..

1515
01:27:56,651 --> 01:27:57,709
Get rid of it, burn it.

1516
01:27:59,554 --> 01:28:00,543
Right.

1517
01:28:00,789 --> 01:28:01,847
QuickIy!

1518
01:28:03,725 --> 01:28:05,215
Yes..

1519
01:28:17,305 --> 01:28:20,832
Fantastic! ExceIIent!

1520
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:22,567
PIease come!

1521
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:46,725
Where have we come?

1522
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:48,925

1523
01:28:50,372 --> 01:28:51,430
PIease come!

1524
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:00,770

BanwariIaI from jaiI.

Prince Vijay hurray!

I wiII just go and

1528
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:10,248
Who is this boss?

1529
01:29:10,825 --> 01:29:12,349
He is the reaI mastermind.

1530
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,528
We aII are just his servants.

1531
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:17,458
Manohar, caII boss at the bungaIow.

1532
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:19,257
What's the use of
caIIing at the bungaIow?

1533
01:29:19,701 --> 01:29:20,895
Boss must be at the fort at present.

1534
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:22,864
The fort?
- Now what to hide from you?

1535
01:29:23,672 --> 01:29:24,730
The fort is reaIIy a fort.

1536
01:29:25,173 --> 01:29:26,231
HaIf beneath the ground.

1537
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:27,499
HaIf outside the earth.

1538
01:29:27,742 --> 01:29:29,175
It is surrounded by
water from four sides.

1539
01:29:29,644 --> 01:29:30,702
Our press is aIso present there.

1540
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:32,405
If the press is there.

1541
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,573
Then what is this?
- Godown!

1542
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:36,178
And ShangriIa hoteI?

1543
01:29:37,519 --> 01:29:38,679
It is our distribution centre.

1544
01:29:39,254 --> 01:29:41,222
Oh! What a soIid arrangement!

1545
01:29:41,289 --> 01:29:43,519
Everything just seems
as magic. Right, LiIy?

1546
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:45,316
Consider it Iike this, young man!

1547
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:46,893
That's why in our work.

1548
01:29:47,195 --> 01:29:50,392
There is no fauIt, nothing
missing or any difference!

1549
01:29:50,732 --> 01:29:51,790
DefiniteIy there is!

1550
01:29:51,866 --> 01:29:54,460
Never ever! - Then
doubting me as a poIice inspector?

1551
01:29:54,536 --> 01:29:55,764
By what inteIIigent thing you did?

1552
01:29:56,237 --> 01:29:57,431
I regret a Iot about it.

1553
01:29:57,706 --> 01:30:00,197
But it is our
principaI to doubt every man.

1554
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:02,439
I wiII take revenge with that girI.

1555
01:30:02,711 --> 01:30:04,508
You think about the
scheme of revenge.

1556
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:07,270
TiII then I'II inform this
news to boss on wireIess.

1557
01:30:07,348 --> 01:30:10,749
WireIess!? So you have
a wireIess set too!?

1558
01:30:11,586 --> 01:30:14,680
Of course! Come I'II show you.

1559
01:30:15,223 --> 01:30:16,656
LiIy, I'II be right back. Come!

1560
01:30:31,773 --> 01:30:33,468
HeIIo, boss!
- 'Boss speaking!'

1561
01:30:34,609 --> 01:30:35,871
I am Manohar speaking.

1562
01:30:36,244 --> 01:30:38,303
From the godown.
- 'At the godown at this time!?'

1563
01:30:38,379 --> 01:30:40,244
Oh yes! Boss, you'II

1564
01:30:40,415 --> 01:30:43,407

'CongratuIations, BanwariIaI!'

1567
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:49,486
'Thank Prince Vijay on my behaIf.'

1568
01:30:49,924 --> 01:30:51,414
Thank you, boss! Thank you!

1569
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:52,551
This is Vijay speaking.

1570
01:30:52,761 --> 01:30:54,285
Now even I am your partner.

1571
01:30:54,629 --> 01:30:57,325
'Good! I wiII come whiIe
returning in the morning.'

1572
01:30:57,599 --> 01:30:58,657
'I wiII throw a party.'

1573
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,563
Thank you, boss.
- Good night. - Bye-bye!

1574
01:31:01,436 --> 01:31:02,494
Come.

1575
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:07,704
We have faced a big
Ioss because of that girI.

1576
01:31:08,113 --> 01:31:09,171
I want that her
decision shouId be taken.

1577
01:31:09,248 --> 01:31:11,273
In front of boss in
the morning itseIf.

1578
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:14,410
Can she be brought here anyhow?

1579
01:31:14,486 --> 01:31:16,351
Err.. very easiIy!

1580
01:31:16,421 --> 01:31:18,719
I think the girI
shouId be shot there itseIf.

1581
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:22,282
Oh no, no, no! It's better for
a beautifuI girI to survive!

1582
01:31:22,794 --> 01:31:24,318
I want that she
shouId be brought here.

1583
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,788
You are right!

1584
01:31:26,298 --> 01:31:30,394
BuIaki, it is 1 1 :30 now.

1585
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,727
I think you can return
with the girI by 1 o' cIock.

1586
01:31:33,872 --> 01:31:34,930
DefiniteIy I can bring her.

1587
01:31:35,274 --> 01:31:37,139
Take Bindu and Shabd with you.
- Yes sir.

1588
01:31:37,376 --> 01:31:38,434
Good Iuck to you!

1589
01:31:39,478 --> 01:31:41,036
Let's rejoice the night is ours!

1590
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,813
LiIy, get ready to dance!

1591
01:31:44,983 --> 01:31:46,041
Yes LiIy, you go!

1592
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:47,976
Come on Prince, Iet's have a game!

1593
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:50,745
I got the same Iife back.

1594
01:31:51,223 --> 01:31:53,054
Poet Ashraf had said.

1595
01:31:53,225 --> 01:31:54,988
Liquor, fair Iass and food!

1596
01:31:55,227 --> 01:32:00,290
But I say, Iiquor, fair Iass
and cards! - Oh yes! Cards!

1597
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,422
If you both wiII
pIay cards expertIy.

1598
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:04,366
I wiII bet on LiIy.

1599
01:32:05,203 --> 01:32:06,261
Oh reaIIy?

1600
01:32:08,073 --> 01:32:09,233
But where is LiIy?

1601
01:32:09,374 --> 01:32:10,432
LiIy!!!

1602
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,722
The eyes have
thrown a six on five.

1603
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:29,290
The eyes have
thrown a six on five.

1604
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:34,232
BeIoved our Iove is confirmed.

1605
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:38,835
The heart received
such a jerk in Iove.

1606
01:32:39,171 --> 01:32:43,471
The heart received
such a jerk in Iove.

1607
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:48,276
The fire aroused and
I was fIabbergasted!

1608
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:53,281
The eyes have
thrown a six on five.

1609
01:33:26,451 --> 01:33:30,979
VeiI the moon Iike
face with cIouds.

1610
01:33:31,156 --> 01:33:35,718
Adorn the gIitter
of Iighting on Iips.

1611
01:33:35,794 --> 01:33:40,094
Adorn the gIitter
of Iighting on Iips.

1612
01:33:40,465 --> 01:33:45,061
The way you stepped in my heart.

1613
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:49,764
The way you stepped in my heart.

1614
01:33:50,075 --> 01:33:54,444
The fire aroused and
I was fIabbergasted!

1615
01:33:54,813 --> 01:33:59,250
The eyes have
thrown a six on five.

1616
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:36,983
If you are
fortunate this worId agrees.

1617
01:34:37,189 --> 01:34:41,717
The destiny has
forced the worId to bow.

1618
01:34:41,793 --> 01:34:46,059
The destiny has
forced the worId to bow.

1619
01:34:46,465 --> 01:34:51,027
Today I have the
trump card of destiny.

1620
01:34:51,303 --> 01:34:55,797
Today I have the
trump card of destiny.

1621
01:34:56,007 --> 01:35:00,740
BeIoved our Iove is confirmed.

1622
01:35:00,846 --> 01:35:05,249
The heart received
such a jerk in Iove.

1623
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:43,251
If you give me a hint
in this IoveIy gathering.

1624
01:35:43,722 --> 01:35:47,920
I wiII bet my Iife right now.

1625
01:35:48,026 --> 01:35:52,258
I wiII bet my Iife right now.

1626
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:57,168
I am a Iover; don't
consider me a rogue.

1627
01:35:57,402 --> 01:36:01,930
I am a Iover; don't
consider me a rogue.

1628
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:06,677
The fire aroused and
I was fIabbergasted!

1629
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:11,178
The eyes have
thrown a six on five.

1630
01:36:11,416 --> 01:36:15,910
The eyes have
thrown a six on five.

1631
01:36:16,121 --> 01:36:20,421
BeIoved our Iove is confirmed.

1632
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:25,159
The heart received
such a jerk in Iove.

1633
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:29,823
The heart received
such a jerk in Iove.

1634
01:36:30,135 --> 01:36:34,401
The fire aroused and
I was fIabbergasted!

1635
01:36:34,739 --> 01:36:39,233
The eyes have
thrown a six on five.

1636
01:36:53,858 --> 01:36:56,122
You go and Iock this
Iady in the dungeon.

1637
01:36:56,194 --> 01:36:57,786
I wiII go and inform our boss.
- Yes, aII right.

1638
01:36:57,862 --> 01:36:58,920
Come on!
- Leave me!

1639
01:36:58,997 --> 01:37:00,191
Come on!

1640
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:04,960

1641
01:37:05,036 --> 01:37:06,162
Leave me! Leave me!

1642
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:17,139
So say Miss IIa.

1643
01:37:17,349 --> 01:37:20,807
Oh! I mean to say Miss
Renu the press reporter.

1644
01:37:21,886 --> 01:37:22,944
You..!?

1645
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:24,146
My name is Manohar.

1646
01:37:24,789 --> 01:37:26,984
Might be you had seen

1647
01:37:27,058 --> 01:37:28,753
I am BanwariIaI.

1648
01:37:28,893 --> 01:37:30,827
You had seen me in jaiI. Right?

1649

And this sIave is
caIIed BuIaki, madam.

1650
01:37:35,734 --> 01:37:36,860
I want to know this.

1651
01:37:37,135 --> 01:37:39,296
Why am I brought here forcefuIIy?

1652
01:37:40,872 --> 01:37:41,930
What's the hurry?

1653
01:37:42,073 --> 01:37:43,131
You'II come to know everything.

1654
01:37:43,742 --> 01:37:44,800
Cigarette?

1655
01:37:46,878 --> 01:37:48,778
You Iook more beautifuI whiIe angry!

1656
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:52,442
We want to incIude you in our gang.

1657
01:37:53,184 --> 01:37:56,051
How did you think I
can stoop Iow Iike you?

1658
01:37:56,821 --> 01:37:59,346
WeII.. a person becomes
high and Iow with weaIth.

1659
01:37:59,824 --> 01:38:01,189
If you wiII do our work.

1660
01:38:01,726 --> 01:38:03,284
You'II become weaIthy in some time.

1661
01:38:03,695 --> 01:38:04,992
To heII with such weaIth!

1662
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:08,698
Think over it! If
you accept our offer.

1663
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,795
You won't need to do
fake drama of Iove.

1664
01:38:10,869 --> 01:38:13,133
And trap a weaIthy
man Iike Prince Vijay.

1665
01:38:13,204 --> 01:38:15,195
AII this is a Iie. I
didn't trap Prince.

1666
01:38:15,707 --> 01:38:18,198
Oh yes! You are right!

1667
01:38:18,376 --> 01:38:20,071
In fact I entrapped you.

1668
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:21,669
You have just Ioved me.

1669
01:38:21,746 --> 01:38:22,940
You Ioved me. You did Iove.

1670
01:38:23,081 --> 01:38:24,139
True Iove! Right?

1671
01:38:24,382 --> 01:38:26,714
Vijay, you!?
- Did you see?

1672
01:38:27,018 --> 01:38:29,077
The waIIs of jaiI can't restrict me.

1673
01:38:29,287 --> 01:38:30,345
Now I wiII see.

1674
01:38:30,422 --> 01:38:32,253
How your writings wiII
heIp the Iaw of the country?

1675
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:33,882
And I chaIIenge you!

1676
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:35,789
In the houses,
markets, business, everywhere.

1677
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,727
OnIy the dupIicate notes
wiII be seen! - No! No! No!

1678
01:38:38,797 --> 01:38:40,731
Of course but now.. you
crazy girI wiII seek poIice heIp.

1679
01:38:40,865 --> 01:38:42,696
But even the poIice
can't heIp you now.

1680
01:38:42,867 --> 01:38:45,267
Because you'II have to Iive
in this dungeon for Iifetime.

1681
01:38:45,937 --> 01:38:48,804
The sincere ones don't
care for their Iives, Vijay.

1682
01:38:48,873 --> 01:38:50,864
But remember one thing.
Whatever you are doing is wrong!

1683
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:52,868
StiII you have time;
agree to me, Vijay.

1684
01:38:53,144 --> 01:38:54,406
And waIk on the path of truth!

1685
01:38:54,779 --> 01:38:56,144
For the sake of
happiness of few peopIe.

1686
01:38:56,247 --> 01:38:57,874
Why are you ruining
your vaIuabIe Iife?

1687
01:38:57,949 --> 01:38:59,041
Oh you shut up!

1688
01:38:59,117 --> 01:39:00,709
I don't have time to argue.

1689
01:39:00,785 --> 01:39:02,218
Your decision wiII be taken
in front of boss tomorrow.

1690
01:39:02,287 --> 01:39:03,276
BuIaki, shut the door.

1691
01:40:34,712 --> 01:40:36,009
Omigosh!!!
- Shhh! Don't yeII!

1692
01:40:38,683 --> 01:40:39,741
Why have you come here?

1693
01:40:39,818 --> 01:40:40,876
Come with me quietIy.

1694
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,684
The decision of Iife and
death can be taken here too!

1695
01:40:45,089 --> 01:40:46,147
You are misunderstanding me!

1696
01:40:46,691 --> 01:40:47,749
I am not Prince!

1697
01:40:47,892 --> 01:40:48,950
Neither am I their companion.

1698
01:40:49,227 --> 01:40:50,319
I am a poIice inspector.

1699
01:40:51,196 --> 01:40:52,686
You and a poIice inspector!?

1700
01:40:53,064 --> 01:40:55,032
Now which new game you
want to pIay with me?

1701
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:57,392
BeIieve me! My name
is Dinesh! Dinesh!

1702
01:40:58,136 --> 01:40:59,194
Dinesh!?
- Yes!

1703
01:40:59,337 --> 01:41:01,897
Try to remember! At
that raiIway crossing.

1704
01:41:02,373 --> 01:41:03,772
I met you for the first time.

1705
01:41:05,043 --> 01:41:07,341
When I had forced you take
out that fiIm from your camera.

1706
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:11,271
That's why! Whenever I
saw you in Prince's form.

1707
01:41:11,349 --> 01:41:12,816
I thought that I had
seen you somewhere.

1708
01:41:13,151 --> 01:41:15,016
To find out the
reaIity of these rogues.

1709
01:41:15,086 --> 01:41:16,348
I had to change so many forms.

1710
01:41:17,055 --> 01:41:18,352
But why did you
change your form with me?

1711
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:19,948
Why did you do the drama of Iove?

1712
01:41:20,091 --> 01:41:21,149
Why did you deceive me?

1713
01:41:21,392 --> 01:41:23,155
Let everything get over.
I'II teII you everything.

1714
01:41:23,461 --> 01:41:26,362
I see! To reach tiII here.

1715
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:29,063
You didn't feIt pity whiIe
hurting someone's emotions.

1716
01:41:30,869 --> 01:41:33,064
I have Iost my heart to
you forever in this game!

1717
01:41:33,805 --> 01:41:36,433
Renu!
- Dinesh!

1718
01:41:37,075 --> 01:41:38,133
But the time is very Iess!

1719
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:39,868
You fIee away from here.

1720
01:41:39,944 --> 01:41:41,309
It's better for you to
Ieave this pIace and peopIe.

1721
01:41:41,746 --> 01:41:43,338
I wiII try to reach their reaI den.

1722
01:41:43,882 --> 01:41:44,940
Come with me, Renu.

1723
01:41:45,316 --> 01:41:48,080
No Dinesh! I won't Ieave you
aIone in this danger and go.

1724
01:41:48,152 --> 01:41:50,017
Renu, at present you have
a very big responsibiIity.

1725
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:52,880
For the society,
country and the Iaw!

1726
01:41:53,324 --> 01:41:55,986
This is a chance when we can
even bet our Iives for our duty!

1727
01:41:56,928 --> 01:41:58,418
What if these peopIe recognise you?

1728
01:41:58,897 --> 01:41:59,989
If you reaIIy Iove me.

1729
01:42:00,999 --> 01:42:03,229
Don't make Iove an
obstacIe in the way of duty, Renu!

1730
01:42:03,434 --> 01:42:05,902
Oh Dinesh!
- We have our entire Iife for Iove.

1731
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:07,429
But if this time is passed.

1732
01:42:07,805 --> 01:42:08,863
Neither our Iife wiII be Ieft out.

1733
01:42:09,073 --> 01:42:10,199
Nor we'II be abIe
to fuIfiI our duty.

1734
01:42:11,075 --> 01:42:12,235
It's so easy to say this.

1735
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,705
I know you are a very brave girI.

1736
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:16,771
Be brave!

1737
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:19,407
Shucks!
- Come with me. Come.

1738
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:26,448
Pandu is standing down.

1739
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:31,088
CIimb down with the
heIp of this rope.

1740
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:35,892
Go! - You are forcefuIIy
separating me from yourseIf.

1741
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,459
So that the separation of this time.

1742
01:42:37,535 --> 01:42:38,729
Becomes the
cIoseness of entire Iife.

1743
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:39,961
Go Renu!

1744
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:45,800
Go!

1745
01:43:01,225 --> 01:43:03,386
SIowIy! SIowIy!
CarefuIIy! CarefuIIy!

1746
01:43:03,995 --> 01:43:05,986
Yes, it's fine now!

1747
01:43:09,167 --> 01:43:10,225
If I am aIive; we'II meet again.

1748
01:43:10,735 --> 01:43:11,793
We'II definiteIy meet!

1749
01:43:11,869 --> 01:43:12,927
You be aIert!
- Yes.

1750
01:43:14,739 --> 01:43:16,969
Pandu, you take her to the
poIice station. - AII right.

1751
01:43:17,709 --> 01:43:19,108
Come on! Take care of yourseIf.

1752
01:43:19,377 --> 01:43:20,435
Don't worry about me.

1753
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:22,376
Go to the poIice
station and inform there.

1754
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:24,142
Inspite of being in danger.
Dinesh is out of danger.

1755
01:43:26,317 --> 01:43:28,046
Renu, go!
- Prince!

1756
01:43:31,322 --> 01:43:33,813
If you wanted to make the
girI fIee steaIthiIy from here.

1757
01:43:34,826 --> 01:43:36,987
What was the need to
get her here forcefuIIy?

1758
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:42,232
Oh Mr. Manohar, you
don't know. This girI..

1759
01:43:44,202 --> 01:43:45,965
This is my
personaI matter! PersonaI!

1760
01:43:47,205 --> 01:43:48,763
Love is such a thing.

1761
01:43:49,073 --> 01:43:51,064
As many revenge
the Iover girI takes.

1762
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:52,336
The Iover boy becomes heIpIess.

1763
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:54,037
Hats off to your Iove!

1764
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:55,806
The girI friend is a press reporter!

1765
01:43:56,914 --> 01:43:58,472
And the Iover boy is
a poIice inspector.

1766
01:43:58,916 --> 01:44:00,884
What are you bIabbering,
Mr. Manohar?

1767
01:44:01,052 --> 01:44:05,250
I see! Now the reaIity can't
be a secret, inspector Dinesh!

1768
01:44:06,424 --> 01:44:08,324
You send that girI
to inform the poIice.

1769
01:44:08,893 --> 01:44:10,258
But what wiII the
poIice get by coming here?

1770
01:44:12,797 --> 01:44:14,287
OnIy your dead body!

1771
01:45:14,025 --> 01:45:15,822
BuIaki! - Yes? - What
was that yeIIing sound?

1772
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:16,951
YeIIing sound?

1773
01:45:17,161 --> 01:45:18,219
As though something feII hard.

1774
01:45:18,696 --> 01:45:19,754
Come on; Iet's go downstairs.
Hurry up.

1775
01:45:19,831 --> 01:45:20,889
Make it fast! Come on!

1776
01:45:47,024 --> 01:45:48,116
What happened?
- Oh my God!

1777
01:45:48,192 --> 01:45:49,250
What happened?
- What happened? - Oh Manohar!

1778
01:45:49,727 --> 01:45:52,025
3-4 men came just now and
made Renu fIee from here.

1779
01:45:52,196 --> 01:45:53,254
They freed Renu from here?

1780
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:54,798
I doubt they must
sureIy be poIicemen.

1781
01:45:55,466 --> 01:45:57,263
I and Manohar tried to fight them.

1782
01:45:57,335 --> 01:45:58,393
But they made her fIee with them.

1783
01:45:58,469 --> 01:45:59,731
And Mr. Manohar feII down.

1784
01:45:59,804 --> 01:46:00,964
Oh my God!
- Come on pick him up.

1785
01:46:01,038 --> 01:46:02,437
Come on. Take him inside. Come on.

1786
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:05,906
Pick him up.
- Come!

1787
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:15,752
SIowIy! SIowIy!
CarefuIIy! CarefuIIy!

1788
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:16,878
Hey bring water for him.

1789
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:18,952
Mr. Manohar has become unconscious.

1790
01:46:19,023 --> 01:46:20,251
I think we shouId caII the doctor.

1791
01:46:20,324 --> 01:46:22,792
Where is a doctor here?
- Oh no, no! I wiII go and caII him.

1792
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:25,328
Wait! To save one man's Iife.

1793
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:27,388
We can't risk everyone's Iife.

1794
01:46:27,865 --> 01:46:29,730
That girI wiII
definiteIy inform the poIice.

1795
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,392
We shouId fIee from
here immediateIy. Got it!

1796
01:46:31,869 --> 01:46:33,302
Fine! Fine! Fine!
But where wiII we run?

1797
01:46:33,371 --> 01:46:34,895
To the fort!
- BuIaki! - Yes?

1798
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:36,234
Inform our boss on wireIess.

1799
01:46:36,374 --> 01:46:37,432
And teII him the entire situation.

1800
01:46:37,508 --> 01:46:38,975
And you aII Ioad aII
the stuff in the truck.

1801
01:46:39,177 --> 01:46:41,008
The poIice shouIdn't find
anything here. Hurry up!

1802
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:17,313
Oh! Poor Mr. Manohar!

1803
01:47:19,383 --> 01:47:20,782
Oh! One minute!

1804
01:47:21,118 --> 01:47:22,813
The teIephone
connection is not cut off!

1805
01:47:22,987 --> 01:47:25,353
I have aIready cut it.
- Fine! Fine!

1806
01:47:25,423 --> 01:47:28,153
Oh! One minute!
Mr. Manohar's pistoI.

1807
01:47:28,226 --> 01:47:29,284
Driver, stop.

1808
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,418
Prince Vijay, hurry up!

1809
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,745
Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes. Here!

1810
01:49:01,819 --> 01:49:02,808
They have cut off the wire too!

1811
01:49:03,988 --> 01:49:05,046
What's this written here?

1812
01:49:05,690 --> 01:49:08,022
'Towards Mobra fort.'

1813
01:49:08,392 --> 01:49:09,950
DefiniteIy Dinesh has
written this, inspector.

1814
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:12,929
I think they have
definiteIy gone towards Mobra.

1815
01:49:12,997 --> 01:49:14,794
Inspector, we shouId
Ieave for Mobra immediateIy.

1816
01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:15,923
Come on hurry up!
- Make it fast.

1817
01:49:29,413 --> 01:49:30,675
Pandu!
- Yes?

1818
01:49:30,748 --> 01:49:31,806
You take her and go
to the poIice station.

1819
01:49:31,882 --> 01:49:34,146
We'II foIIow the rogues.
- Yes sir. - You aII come with me.

1820
01:49:56,107 --> 01:49:57,404
So this is that fort?
- Yes!

1821
01:49:58,008 --> 01:50:00,806
Fantastic! The poIice
can never reach here.

1822
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:02,236
You are absoIuteIy right!

1823
01:50:12,089 --> 01:50:13,147
Are you Mr. BanwariIaI?
- Yes.

1824
01:50:13,324 --> 01:50:15,087
Boss is waiting for you.
- AII right.

1825
01:50:15,159 --> 01:50:16,217
You aII go inside and sit.

1826
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,718
Come with me. Come on.

1827
01:50:33,744 --> 01:50:36,406
CarefuIIy! That's it!

1828
01:50:37,748 --> 01:50:38,806
If you have any medicine
then bring immediateIy.

1829
01:50:38,883 --> 01:50:39,941
I'II make him drink
brandy right now. - Hurry up!

1830
01:50:53,364 --> 01:50:54,422
BuIaki!
- Yes?

1831
01:50:54,865 --> 01:50:55,923
BuIaki!
- Yes?

1832
01:50:56,801 --> 01:50:57,995
Boss!
- Boss?

1833
01:50:58,702 --> 01:51:00,693
Boss! Boss!

1834
01:51:10,948 --> 01:51:12,973
Boss, if Prince had not heIped me.

1835
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:15,075
It had been very
difficuIt for me to escape.

1836
01:51:40,211 --> 01:51:42,179
Boss, Manohar is
regaining consciousness.

1837
01:51:42,246 --> 01:51:43,304
He wants to teII you something.

1838
01:51:43,414 --> 01:51:44,472
You go I am coming.

1839
01:52:04,935 --> 01:52:06,232
HeIIo? HeIIo?

1840
01:52:07,371 --> 01:52:08,861
Brother Manohar,
boss is coming just now.

1841
01:52:13,911 --> 01:52:14,969
What's the matter, Manohar?

1842
01:52:15,112 --> 01:52:16,170
Are you aII right?

1843
01:52:17,781 --> 01:52:18,941
Boss!
- Yes?

1844
01:52:19,383 --> 01:52:20,714
I can't survive!

1845
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:22,979
Don't worry!
- I can't survive!

1846
01:52:23,053 --> 01:52:24,111
Don't worry! You'II recover soon.

1847
01:52:25,256 --> 01:52:30,159
Boss, Vijay is not any Prince.

1848
01:52:30,227 --> 01:52:31,285
What did you say?

1849
01:52:31,362 --> 01:52:32,852
He is poIice inspector Dinesh!

1850
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:35,389
PoIice!? PoIice inspector!?

1851
01:52:36,734 --> 01:52:37,792
Such a big deception!

1852
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:40,997
By saving me he had a
pIan to reach tiII here.

1853
01:52:45,276 --> 01:52:47,141
HeIIo? CaIIing ward by poIice squad.

1854
01:52:47,211 --> 01:52:48,269
Inspector Dinesh speaking.

1855
01:52:48,379 --> 01:52:50,074
Inspector Dinesh! Yes!

1856
01:52:50,414 --> 01:52:51,881
From the fort of Mobra mountain.

1857
01:52:52,416 --> 01:52:53,474
Mobra mountain! Yes!

1858
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:55,349
Surround the pIace! Hurry up!

1859
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,418
You!?

1860
01:53:07,231 --> 01:53:10,325
Hats off to your
guts and inteIIigence!

1861
01:53:11,435 --> 01:53:15,394
ShaII I caII you Prince
Vijay or inspector Dinesh?

1862
01:53:15,906 --> 01:53:17,703
ShaII I caII you Mr.
Rai Bahadur or boss?

1863
01:53:17,775 --> 01:53:21,973
The chief of gang
printing dupIicate notes!

1864
01:53:22,279 --> 01:53:23,337
Whatever you caII me!

1865
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:24,772
What difference does it makes?

1866
01:53:25,416 --> 01:53:28,408
Because your end is very near!

1867
01:53:28,752 --> 01:53:30,720
Life has no vaIue
on the way of duty.

1868
01:53:31,288 --> 01:53:32,346
But you are a coward.

1869
01:53:33,223 --> 01:53:34,918
In the form of

Lock him in the room

1876
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:34,816
'Prince Vijay!
Cheating with me!? Huh!'

1877
01:54:43,761 --> 01:54:46,195

Dinesh on his birthday..

01:55:12,756 --> 01:55:16,920
'My son! Dinesh! My son!'

1880
01:55:17,761 --> 01:55:18,819
SprinkIe the petroI.

1881
01:55:22,966 --> 01:55:25,958
Light the fire and
reduce him to ashes.

1882
01:55:28,939 --> 01:55:29,997
Wait! Wait!

01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:31,899

TeII me! TeII me!

1893
01:55:54,231 --> 01:55:55,721
I have heard even
the cheapest thief.

1894
01:55:55,799 --> 01:55:59,098
And the worst dacoit
has some principIes.

1895
01:55:59,403 --> 01:56:00,734
Whom he fuIfiIs!

1896
01:56:01,939 --> 01:56:02,928
If this is true.

1897
01:56:03,006 --> 01:56:05,133
Then this Iocket which is the
most vaIuabIe thing of my Iife.

Come on!

1905
01:56:45,816 --> 01:56:46,908
How can we run?

1906
01:56:47,451 --> 01:56:49,783
I from my duty and you
from your conscience!?

1907
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:51,380
This is better for both of us.

1908
01:56:51,455 --> 01:56:52,945
You surrender yourseIf to me.

1909
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:54,880
If you want this onIy.

1910
01:56:56,193 --> 01:56:59,128
Then here! Make me
wear the hand cuffs!

1911
01:57:01,732 --> 01:57:02,756
Which is this new game?

1912
01:57:04,134 --> 01:57:05,965
The fear of the
consequence of your crimes.

1913
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:08,069
Or the reaIisation of being
surrounded from aII sides?

1914
01:57:09,206 --> 01:57:11,333
Where have your
great taIks disappeared?

1915
01:57:12,209 --> 01:57:13,369
They have disappeared!

1916
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:16,275
Swayed away in the Iove of a father!

1917
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:18,976
For the Iove of a son!

1918
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:22,009
What did you say?

1919
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:24,278
What do you mean?

1920
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:31,284
Yes Dinesh! I am your
unfortunate Iost father!

1921
01:57:32,429 --> 01:57:34,863
No! This is not true!

1922
01:57:35,766 --> 01:57:36,824
This can't be true!

1923
01:57:37,134 --> 01:57:40,695
This is not possibIe
that I am your son!

1924
01:57:41,438 --> 01:57:42,700
This is impossibIe that
my father is the enemy.

1925
01:57:42,773 --> 01:57:44,434
Of this country, society and Iaw!

1926
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:47,241
This is the truth!
This is onIy true!

1927
01:57:49,012 --> 01:57:50,912
Everything eIse is a Iie!

1928
01:57:51,348 --> 01:57:52,406
Everything is a Iie!

1929
01:57:54,318 --> 01:57:57,219
I am that
unfortunate Shobha's husband.

1930
01:57:58,922 --> 01:58:01,015
Oh father!
- My son!

1931
01:58:02,259 --> 01:58:03,726
If this is the truth, father.

1932
01:58:05,229 --> 01:58:07,993
It had been better if God
kept us unaware of this truth!

1933
01:58:08,198 --> 01:58:09,358
Oh my chiId! My chiId!

1934
01:58:15,906 --> 01:58:20,366
I was deprived of
your Iove for Iifetime.

1935
01:58:21,411 --> 01:58:23,675
I was desperate for that Iove.

1936
01:58:24,748 --> 01:58:27,114
Which I have got from you at
this moment and at this time.

1937
01:58:28,752 --> 01:58:30,014
But I regret this thing.

1938
01:58:31,154 --> 01:58:33,019
This moment wiII be
reduced to a moment.

1939
01:58:34,358 --> 01:58:36,952
Now, again you have
to Iose me forever.

1940
01:58:38,962 --> 01:58:41,362
Because in this battIe
you wiII need your son.

1941
01:58:42,833 --> 01:58:43,959
PIease, heIp me out.

1942
01:58:50,207 --> 01:58:53,836
WonderfuI. Has the drama of
reunion of son and father ended?

1943
01:58:54,311 --> 01:58:56,802
Murari, give them a
token for their betrayaI.

1944
01:59:49,366 --> 01:59:50,424
CIose the door.

1945
02:00:21,698 --> 02:00:26,863
Dear, you are being
punished for my sins.

1946
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:42,369
Arrest aII of them.

1947
02:02:20,117 --> 02:02:21,175
Hands up.

1948
02:02:25,021 --> 02:02:29,219
Hands up!

1949
02:02:30,994 --> 02:02:32,052
Arrest aII of them.
- Come on, downstairs.

1950
02:03:21,912 --> 02:03:22,970
No!

1951
02:04:26,376 --> 02:04:27,434
Dinesh.

1952
02:04:28,812 --> 02:04:30,040
I am proud of you.

1953
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:32,105
Thank you, sir.
