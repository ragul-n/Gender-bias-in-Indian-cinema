1
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:24,263
Hey missus!

2
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,546
lmagine I lump Christians,

3
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,387
George Bush, the Pope,

4
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,758
Henrik Larsson
and Willie the Janny

5
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:05,525
all into one person.
You'd laugh.

6
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,123
Why?
'Cause it's dumb.

7
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
But that's exactly
what the West does with Islam,

8
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,069
as if one billion Muslims
in 50 countries,

9
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,935
with hundreds
of different languages

10
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,703
and countless ethnic groups
are all one and the same.

11
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,767
Take my family...

12
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:21,440
my sister considers herself
as a Muslim first,

13
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,915
and because she has
a political streak,

14
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,111
calls herself black.

15
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:28,017
My dad's been
in this country

16
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:30,420
for over 40 years

17
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,788
and is 100% Pakistani,

18
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,225
or so he thinks.

19
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,786
I reject the West's definition
of terrorism,

20
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,595
which excludes the hundreds
of thousands of victims

21
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,361
of state terror.

22
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,630
I reject the West's claim
of moral high ground

23
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,003
after two of its main Jesus lovers
tore up the U.N. charter.

24
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,609
But above all,

25
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,179
I reject the West's simplification

26
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:56,579
of a Muslim.

27
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:01,920
I am a Glaswegian,

28
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:05,288
Pakistani,
teenager, woman...

29
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:08,817
woman of Muslim descent,

30
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:10,863
who...

31
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,865
supports...

32
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:16,266
Glasgow Rangers
in a Catholic school.

33
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:19,396
'Cause I'm a dazzling mixture,
and I'm proud of it.

34
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:21,167
I call on this house

35
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:24,176
to defeat this
hypocritical motion.

36
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,906
Bring it on, yes!

37
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,041
Look at the state of you, mate.
Celtic tights! Yeah!

38
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:45,828
- Look, I can call you back.
- Grow up, guys!

39
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,231
- Give me my bag.
- Ho, what's going on here?

40
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:51,134
- Another fucking coconut.
- Shut it, you! Beat it!

41
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,172
Go on, give us it back.

42
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,207
Nothing worse
than an uppity Paki!

43
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,470
- What?
- Uppity Paki Hun!

44
00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:00,137
Yeah! Go, Tahara!

45
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,408
- Here we go!
- Come here, you!

46
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:05,178
- Come on, then!
- Get in the car. Calm down and get in.

47
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,853
Fuck's sake, man!

48
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,395
- They fucking started it.
- Look, you just calm down.

49
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:19,090
Oh, you disgusting little shite!

50
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,133
Tahara, calm down!
Tahara, come back!

51
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:23,192
Come here!

52
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:26,865
- I'm gonna kill you!
- No running in the corridor!

53
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,204
I'm gonna get you!

54
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,403
- Tahara, come back!
- Come back, come back here!

55
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:35,208
- Sheffield!
- I'll kill you!

56
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:37,044
Tahara!

57
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:40,109
Stop!

58
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:45,350
Watch where you're going.
For God's sake, out of the way.

59
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:49,051
Shit. Listen, go to the right!
Go to the right!

60
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,029
I'm gonna kick you in the balls!

61
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,158
- Where did you see those guys go?
- What, sir?

62
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:57,226
The guys who were
running up here just now.

63
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,238
- Up the stairs, sir.
- Up there. Right!

64
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,845
What's going on?

65
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,879
Excuse me.

66
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,938
Tahara!
Excuse me!

67
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,951
- Thank you!
- Calm down.

68
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:15,021
Can you two sit down now?
Thank you, and you two outside!

69
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:18,387
- It wasn't our fault--
- What do you think you're doing?

70
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,256
- It won't happen again, miss.
- I don't care, Dan. Get out.

71
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:24,091
And you can wait
for me as well. Get out, now.

72
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:28,790
Are you okay?

73
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,104
Is this someone
you want to be with?

74
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:34,231
This is my brother.
He was only picking me up.

75
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,867
It's not his fault.

76
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,910
I take it they insulted you?

77
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,969
Something like that.

78
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:44,773
They looked pretty scared.

79
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:46,786
I'm sorry, miss.

80
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,581
It's okay.

81
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,590
Come on, let's go.

82
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,887
- Careful you don't drop it.
- Sorry.

83
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,392
Come on, let's go.

84
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,307
Right, Jacqueline.

85
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:11,809
On with the lesson.
You've got a competition to win.

86
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:13,845
- Okay?
- All right.

87
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,210
That gives you the perspective.

88
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:56,084
- Is that this side, this one?
- Aye, that's the garden there.

89
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:58,647
- Right.
- I suggest we start pegging it out

90
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:02,216
from that corner. You'll get an idea
of what its going to look like.

91
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,820
- Okay, so are we gonna do it?
- Aye, let's do that.

92
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,866
Hold on to it.
Okay, so I go?

93
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,766
- Aye, aye.
- Right. One, two, three, four, five.

94
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,532
- Right. Now what?
- That's the steps you're going to take.

95
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,574
- Following that line...
- Aye.

96
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:17,370
- six steps that way.
- Okay.

97
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:19,502
- One, two, three, four five, six.
- Dad!

98
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,571
- Watch Mom's plants!
- That's the first position.

99
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,083
- Hey, Casim. Come here.
- What are you doing?

100
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:26,914
- Stand in there?
- Come on.

101
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,113
- In the plants?
- Yeah. Stand here.

102
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,419
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,789
- They won't-- the plants won't--
- Stand there!

104
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,691
- We're gonna get shot, Dad.
- Just you come in.

105
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:38,787
Come on, we're gonna--
you stand there.

106
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,798
- Now, Big Danny...
- Wait, where are you?

107
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,596
- I'm here. What do I do now?
- I know, but where are you?

108
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,830
- What is there?
- This is the kitchen corner.

109
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,930
- The wall.
- I thought it was going to be

110
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,237
- a games room, Mr. Khan.
- Games room?

111
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,211
Listen, we're going to have a bedroom
and a living room

112
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,407
for his wife-to-be.
You not hear me?

113
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:58,177
We're going to come down
through there, on to the kitchen.

114
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:01,652
Again, keel and board,
line of the house, three steps that way.

115
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,712
- Right.
- Easy on the flowers, there.

116
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:06,348
Wait a minute. Okay, right.
Don't worry about flowers!

117
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:09,827
- Let me get on with it!
- Dad, get your big feet off.

118
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,693
Hey, wee one.
Tahara, come here.

119
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,666
You just come here.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

120
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:18,169
- She's gonna go off her head, man.
- See bloody kids?

121
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:21,139
They don't listen!
They just stand there.

122
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,768
-What is it?
- What are you doing?

123
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:26,641
You are either going
to have an extension, missus,

124
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,476
or you can have a garden.
You cannot have both of them.

125
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,540
Once the extension is built,

126
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:34,382
we'll make more flowers,
we'll make more gardens.

127
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:36,445
Don't worry about it.
Just you go in there.

128
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:39,014
- Right, Danny, what do I do?
- Okay, we're starting--

129
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:41,652
- Get your feet off!
- We're starting to get an idea of it.

130
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,457
From that position,
we're going to follow this line again.

131
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,395
- This line there?
- One step in here.

132
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,093
One. Right. Wee Roddie--

133
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,533
Roddie, come here.
Never mind tea. Stand there.

134
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,071
- This'll cost you extra, Mr. Khan.
- Right. Okay.

135
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,800
So you've just met
the bedroom there with the kitchen.

136
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,866
- You're coming down this line.
- Aye.

137
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,538
Keep it in mind.
Get a sense of it.

138
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,910
- This way, three steps.
- Just you stand there.

139
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:05,280
- Same size steps you've been taking.
- One, two, three-- ah!

140
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:17,690
Next week?
No, that's tomorrow.

141
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:27,396
- I don't think you'll remember me.
- Oh, yeah. Tahara's brother.

142
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:30,203
- Elsie, see you later, okay.
- I think I owe you a new guitar.

143
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,244
That's very
thoughtful of you.

144
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:36,009
What do you want me
to do with it?

145
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:38,549
Well, the music room's
locked up now.

146
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:40,677
Shall I leave it
in your car for you?

147
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:43,221
You could if I had one.
Oh, no. I'll take it. Here.

148
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,248
- No, no. Where is it you stay?
- On the other side of the city.

149
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:49,056
- I'll give you a lift.
- No, don't be silly. I'll manage.

150
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,688
No, seriously. Your hands look full. Give
me your bags.

151
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,732
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, of course.

152
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,460
Could you do me favor?
Would you mind ducking down for a sec?

153
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,965
- What?
- Please. Duck down for a second.

154
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,969
- Are you serious?
- Quickly. Please.

155
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:35,268
- See that take-away there?
- I can't from here, no.

156
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,708
That's my mom's cousin's aunt's
son's or something like that.

157
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,076
See, if they see me in the car
with a strange woman,

158
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,080
there's gonna be trouble.

159
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:45,084
Can I come up now?

160
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,118
Yeah.

161
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:49,177
- Thanks.
- That's okay.

162
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,839
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course you can.

163
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,977
I don't suppose you'd know of anyone
who could shift a grand piano, do you?

164
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:23,022
- A what?
- A grand piano.

165
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,056
A grand piano?

166
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,614
You're in luck, Miss Hanlon.

167
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,628
- You've just met an entrepreneur.
- It's Roisin.

168
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,825
- Is this your club?
- No, not yet.

169
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,957
We thought we'd get
the cards made up first

170
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,696
- and just see how things go after that.
- Oh, right. Okay.

171
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,670
- A piano?
- Yeah.

172
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:42,835
Come on.

173
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:44,876
- Jesus.
- All right?

174
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:51,777
It's just up the one floor, okay?

175
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,842
One floor, darlin'?

176
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,478
- You Irish?
- Yes.

177
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:58,547
Could you not have just stuck
with a tin whistle or something?

178
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:01,321
Right 'round this bend
and just pass up these stairs, boys.

179
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:03,191
Okay.

180
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,823
For fuck's sake,
you're putting me through the wall.

181
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,332
I'm sorry, Danny.

182
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,369
Oh fuck's sake, wee man.

183
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,871
I'm gonna part your stains
after this, Casim.

184
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,566
He told us we were shifting a dresser

185
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,440
- for an old pensioner.
- She's older than she looks. Shut it.

186
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,480
- Thanks very much.
- Come on!

187
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,482
Just take the fucking weight,
you fat bastard!

188
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:27,486
I can't, Danny! My arms
are fucking three feet long.

189
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,522
- Hold on. I can't feel my fingers.
- I'm turning into an octopus.

190
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,888
It's on my fingers, Danny!

191
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,926
Fucking hell, wee man.

192
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:37,792
You useless
fucking bastard, Rod.

193
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:39,831
Calm down, Danny.

194
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,890
Right.

195
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,528
All right, wee man.

196
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,595
What the--

197
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,903
Jesus Christ!

198
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,942
Jesus Christ, my piano!

199
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:55,610
What are you doing?
You stupid bastard.

200
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,649
You all right?

201
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,344
- Danny.
- You okay, wee man?

202
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,784
Flattened my balls.

203
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,754
Oh, for fuck's sake.

204
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,495
All right?
You stupid bastard.

205
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:12,429
I think you're going
to need to re-tune this.

206
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:15,524
No, I meant the piano.

207
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:19,298
Wee man's just had his meat
and two veg mangled. Fuck the piano.

208
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,340
- Okay, wee man.
- Give us a sec, will you?

209
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,341
I thought I heard a perfect high C
when that hit you, wee man.

210
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,172
Very fucking funny.

211
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,358
Well, it's sounded better.

212
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,722
It survived. Just.

213
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,837
Very good.

214
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:53,872
I've really missed this.

215
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,305
Whose was the fancy pad
that you picked it up from?

216
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,071
- An ex.
- You two fall out?

217
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,080
No. Just changed.

218
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:04,115
At least, I did.

219
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,174
He looked upset.

220
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,119
Did he?

221
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:17,154
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- No, no thanks.

222
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,460
I'd better be off.
I'm helping my dad at the shop.

223
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,500
- Okay.
- See you later.

224
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,729
Excuse me. Are you the lady
with the grand piano?

225
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:30,598
Might be.

226
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,161
I don't supposed you'd fancy
coming to a gig tonight?

227
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,173
I'm meeting a friend.

228
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:38,107
Very low key.
Blues and swing.

229
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,168
I have to work tomorrow.

230
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,974
- What time do you start?
- 9:00.

231
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,878
You'll be back in by 7:00,
I promise.

232
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,577
- Well done.
- What's happening?

233
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,615
How are you doing, mate?
How are you doing?

234
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,411
Has he been keeping
you entertained?

235
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,542
Yeah, to say the least.

236
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,814
He's been telling
about this new club of yours.

237
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,618
Aye, we've got a new place
10 minutes away from here,

238
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,192
maybe 15 minutes.

239
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:30,285
It's an old bar that we've converted into a
"fuck-off" nightclub.

240
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:31,955
It's unbelievable,
by the way.

241
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,226
It's going to be the latest
and trendiest club.

242
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,995
This man's going to be DJing
and I'm going to be promoting.

243
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,627
- So--
- When do we get to go?

244
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,831
Well, depends
how tonight goes.

245
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,135
What are you
doing later on?

246
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,176
- No, let's go.
- I don't believe this.

247
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,610
- What?
- Here's your sister.

248
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,238
Oh, for fuck's sake.

249
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:52,112
- Huh? Your sister?
- Oh, no.

250
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,651
Yeah, she's all right.

251
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:56,187
- What are you doing here?
- Hi, Miss Hanlon.

252
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,246
- How are you doing?
- Okay, Tahara? Girls?

253
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,417
"Miss Hanlon"?
How do you know them?

254
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,859
- Her pupils.
- I bet you didn't have to climb

255
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,987
out the window, miss.
I nearly broke my neck.

256
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,554
Tahara, come here.

257
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,762
- Are you gonna go?
- She's in trouble, isn't she?

258
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:12,099
Gets back to her mom
and dad, they'll kill her.

259
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:14,162
Come here.

260
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,401
What the fuck
are you doing here?

261
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,977
- Well, what do you think?
- What are you doing?

262
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:24,674
I'm out with my mates,
like you are.

263
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,183
- Leave.
- No.

264
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,913
Please. You're not hanging
about here dressed like that

265
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,786
- in front of me. Just leave.
- What's Miss Hanlon doing here?

266
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,587
She was here having a drink.
That's what she's doing here.

267
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,024
- Oh, really?
- Oh really.

268
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,086
Listen, Tahara.
I'm working here.

269
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:41,098
Right? I'm working here.
I'm here with Hammid, okay?

270
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,760
- Yeah, whatever.
- Right.

271
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:45,463
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, whatever. Move.

272
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,575
- Are you worried?
- No, why should I worry?

273
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,117
- You sure?
- Not at all.

274
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,879
Let me just fix that
for you there.

275
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,786
Oh! Just a wee bit
strangled my neck there.

276
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:05,824
All right.
Okay, thanks.

277
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,859
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

278
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:09,918
Whoo-hoo, postman.

279
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:13,420
- Are they here yet?
- No. What's this one like, Rukhsana?

280
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,625
I bet he's a wee plooky ferret
from Bradford.

281
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:19,397
Oy. I heard
that he's over six feet tall,

282
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:22,464
he's a fair complex--
has a fair complexion,

283
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,873
- and he's got a full head of hair.
- Eww!

284
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,673
What do you mean?
That sounds nice.

285
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,736
- Yeah.
- You make him sound like a Viking

286
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,009
I did. I did.

287
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,915
It's supposed
to be just tea, Mom.

288
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,953
- There's a car coming.
- Ooh.

289
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,988
- Oh, what a car.
- Is that them?

290
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,519
It's pretty gorgeous isn't it?

291
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,562
- Oh, wow.
- Is that them?

292
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,596
Oh my God.

293
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,997
Yes, it's them. It's them.

294
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,394
Now, you two,
on your best behavior.

295
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,497
- Oh, he's stunning.
- He's all right, by the way.

296
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:01,469
On you go.

297
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:06,443
Peace be on you.

298
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,510
Are you all right?

299
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,612
Find the house okay?

300
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,189
Sorry about the mess...

301
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,429
Son, go with Auntie.

302
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:28,303
We're building an extension here.

303
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:32,707
When it's done, it'll look fine.

304
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,447
Where has he studied,
and how much?

305
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:42,351
Auntie, I did my Bachelor
of Science degree

306
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,150
from lmperial College, London.

307
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:48,023
He did a Ph.D.
at Boston University.

308
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:54,032
Now Molecular Biology
at Manchester.

309
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,866
You are lucky.
God gave you a good boy.

310
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:02,101
But his mother
put in a lot of effort.

311
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:07,202
The first teachings
are from the mother.

312
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,148
A child's success
depends on the mother.

313
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:18,180
She put in hard work
to get him there.

314
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:20,748
You're crowning a mother's head.

315
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:24,354
There's no glory.
It's not about that.

316
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,294
What else, son?

317
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,799
Auntie, it's going really well--

318
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:30,858
Thanks.

319
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:32,871
I've got a great team,
highly motivated,

320
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:37,136
I foresee myself spending
a long time in Manchester.

321
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:39,905
Very good. You're very lucky.
You've got lovely parents.

322
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,708
Thank you.

323
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,270
Thank you, ji.

324
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:46,010
So, what do you think
of Glasgow?

325
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:48,144
- Well--
- Excuse me.

326
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,280
Tahara, do you mind? You want
to sit there for a minute?

327
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,551
You go in there, uh-huh.

328
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,617
Just-- sorry, you go
in there.

329
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:58,254
That's right,
have a seat there.

330
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:00,956
That's a good girl.

331
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,263
Of all my three children,

332
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,530
Rukhsana's the best...

333
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:10,564
smart, sophisticated
and domesticated.

334
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:12,235
And she's done a degree.

335
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,973
- What degree?
- I'll show you.

336
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:17,880
- Psychology.
- Psychology, very nice.

337
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:27,420
Rukhsana has a masters
from Glasgow University.

338
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,629
Casim's done a degree in accounting.

339
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,960
- So, you are an accountant?
- Accountant.

340
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,631
I'm doing a feasibility study.
It's just to do with import and export.

341
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:46,205
That's important to know.

342
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:49,042
Tahara's at school.

343
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:52,083
She's going to be a doctor.

344
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,486
- A journalist.
- A doctor!

345
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:00,150
Children are like that,

346
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:03,422
they're always changing
their minds.

347
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:08,626
Rukhsana teaches
the community aerobics.

348
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:12,762
Always exercising.
Look at her figure!

349
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,463
Mommy.

350
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:16,507
- Aerobics?
- Yeah, yeah.

351
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:18,566
All right. Do you enjoy that?

352
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,011
It's okay. It's good
to do some volunteer work

353
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:24,777
- in the communities.
- Okay.

354
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:26,475
Whose photo is this?

355
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,713
It's my niece.

356
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:35,988
Casim's fiancée.
Soon my daughter-in-law.

357
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:38,063
Very pretty, soft eyes.

358
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,030
She's beautiful. I'm lucky

359
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:41,930
to have her
as a daughter-in-law.

360
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,992
- She is beautiful.
- Thank you very much, uncle.

361
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:47,870
- Casim, you are a lucky young man.
- Very lucky.

362
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,595
- Is this it?
- This is it.

363
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,961
- Okay.
- As they say, this is it.

364
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:57,533
- This is my place, my club.
- Yeah, but I thought you said--

365
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,577
"a touch of paint"
is what you said.

366
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:01,942
Look at the potential
that's in this place.

367
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:06,182
Bars all across the side there.

368
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:08,048
Both sides.

369
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,988
A dance floor so big
it covers the whole back.

370
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,991
Hundreds of bodies
just dancing to the beat.

371
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,552
Me, up on the podium...

372
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,961
raised so I can see,
look over everyone.

373
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,934
VIP rooms, different music rooms
everywhere.

374
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:26,493
You with your grand piano
away in a room over there.

375
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,509
There'll be lights flashing
from everywhere,

376
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,908
all these angles.

377
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:35,912
Can you not see it?

378
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,916
That's gonna cost you millions.

379
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:41,952
- £56,000.
- 56,000?

380
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,954
There won't be
any dress codes.

381
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:46,513
- No dress codes?
- 'Cause there's no expectation,

382
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:48,788
there's never expectation.
Anyone's allowed.

383
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:52,024
- So, transvestites to anoraks.
- Burkas to G-strings.

384
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,690
Where even shy girls
can make the first move?

385
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,996
And nervous little boys
won't run away.

386
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:21,185
It doesn't feel quite the same
without the grand piano.

387
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:55,511
- You're strong, aren't you?
- For a wee Irish girl, I am.

388
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,371
Two-one, to me.

389
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,537
Okay, truce then.

390
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,104
- Okay? Yeah.
- Truce?

391
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:26,742
- Promise?
- Swear to God.

392
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:32,722
Over my dead body,
you mug.

393
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:47,194
- Now it's a truce.
- Okay.

394
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,221
I forgot to say...

395
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:13,727
I like your name.

396
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,527
I forgot to say...

397
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:22,039
I like your hands.

398
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,869
Ahh, Roisin, Elsie.

399
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:11,609
Can I ask whose idea it was
to sing the Burns song?

400
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,446
Oh, it was the modern studies class.

401
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:16,749
They thought it would fit in well
with their Third World debt project.

402
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:18,823
- That's right.
- I don't think a song

403
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,120
written by a well-known
drunken fornicator

404
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:24,492
is really appropriate
for the holy sacrifice of the Mass.

405
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:28,363
- Is that right?
- Roisin. Roisin.

406
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:31,196
I've just had a telephone call
from David.

407
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,898
He tells me that he's going
to take early retirement.

408
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:39,239
So, it is my intention
to offer you a full-time post.

409
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:41,404
And I won't take no
for an answer.

410
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:44,175
- Really?
- Well, you enjoy the midterm break,

411
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,978
and I hope you'll come back
as a permanent member of staff.

412
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:49,280
- What about an interview?
- I don't think we need

413
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:51,378
to worry about that.
We've seen your work

414
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:54,219
for the past nine months,
and I just don't want to lose you.

415
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:56,419
- Thanks a lot, that's great.
- That's okay.

416
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:58,553
- I'll catch you later.
- All right.

417
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,292
- I've just been made permanent.
- You're kidding.

418
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:03,697
- That's fantastic.
- I can't believe this.

419
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:09,134
Girls, hurry along
to your next class, okay?

420
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,198
Doing fine.
Yeah and you?

421
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:13,507
Good. Coffee?

422
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:40,834
To Spain?

423
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:46,006
- Leaving tomorrow?
- Come on, big man,

424
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:48,978
have you your own directory
inquiries service? Come on!

425
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:53,278
- Jesus Christ.
- You just booked them?

426
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:02,054
- It's a bit short notice, isn't it?
- Casim, that mortar's

427
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,651
gonna get fucking hard
if you don't put it back on.

428
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,096
I don't know,
is it under there somewhere?

429
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,577
Where the fuck are you going?

430
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,305
- Mom?
- Yes?

431
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:23,279
Got to go to London
for a few days.

432
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:25,872
- Why?
- We may have a backer for the club.

433
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,884
- Is that a good thing?
- Yes.

434
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:30,250
- Who are you going with?
- Hammid.

435
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:32,790
How long are you going for?

436
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:36,327
- Three days, Mom.
- You going now? That's fine then.

437
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:39,793
I'm just gonna get some stuff
ready in the house.

438
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,889
Okay, that's fine.

439
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,442
It's freezing.

440
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:29,336
You know what
the best thing is?

441
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:32,248
No, please don't.
Let me go in my own time.

442
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,409
- This is the best thing.
- No, no.

443
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:42,990
- Gracias.
- Thank you.

444
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:50,701
So what about angels?

445
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,999
We have angels.

446
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,130
- Virgin birth.
- Yup.

447
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:57,333
We've even got
a special chapter on Mary.

448
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:59,377
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

449
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,274
And...

450
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:04,109
transubstantiation?

451
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,241
- What's that?
- It's where the priest

452
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:09,878
turns the bread and wine literally
into the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

453
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:12,548
- What are you laughing at?
- No.

454
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:15,784
So I suppose then
you believe

455
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:18,362
that the Archangel Gabriel,
in a cave

456
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,898
whispered the word of God,
word by word

457
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,900
- into Mohammed's ear.
- Exactly.

458
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,095
There's still so much
I'm proud of.

459
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,063
Do you know what zakah means?

460
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:32,871
It's when you give a percentage
of your income to the poor.

461
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:35,913
My dad, still to this day,
gives exactly to the penny

462
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,915
to asylum seekers.

463
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,744
Kill a man,
kill all of humanity.

464
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,311
We can be higher than angels
and lower than dogs.

465
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,414
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

466
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:50,585
None of us truly believe until we wish
for our brothers and sisters

467
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:52,960
what we wish for ourselves.

468
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:54,931
To the prophet.

469
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,501
To Jesus, a lesser prophet,
but what the hell.

470
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:04,633
Well, at least we both believe
that life is one long, miserable test

471
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,040
and the day of judgment
is fast approaching.

472
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:09,613
- So, to paradise.
- Cheers.

473
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:11,945
- Or hell's furnace.
- Paradise.

474
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:22,754
To be honest with you, I think
I was lonely more than anything else.

475
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,154
Just 'cause I have no family.

476
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,856
That's kind of why
I got married.

477
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:31,163
- Got married?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,703
- How old were you?
- 19.

479
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:35,966
- 19?
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:39,134
Big white, fluffy meringue dress
and pointy shoes... the works.

481
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,371
- Jesus.
- 19?

482
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,413
Mm-hmm. In front of all our friends,

483
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,312
and God and state and church,

484
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:48,079
I swore with all my heart
that no matter what,

485
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:50,484
I would live with him
for the rest of my life.

486
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:54,183
- What's he like?
- He's lovely, he's a really kind man.

487
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:58,457
Just more of a friend.

488
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,760
And what's wrong
with companionship?

489
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,001
There's nothing wrong with it,
I just need more.

490
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:07,162
Like what?

491
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,767
The match, you know?

492
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,969
- A real equal match.
- Yeah.

493
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:15,342
A wee twinkle in the eye.

494
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:19,372
If that's not there, I'd just--
I'd rather be on my own.

495
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,582
That's okay, isn't it?

496
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:42,197
So, do you ever
get scared now?

497
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:45,500
Sometimes, yeah.

498
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:47,545
Late at night, you know,
if I'm in my bed,

499
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:50,842
half asleep
or just being a wee bit down.

500
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,417
But I have this little fellow
to keep me company.

501
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:01,659
A little butterfly?

502
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:08,259
- You're a khotee.
- A "khotee"?

503
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:11,130
- Is that a compliment?
- A lovely little khotee.

504
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:13,067
Ah.

505
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,586
- Do you know what you are?
- What?

506
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,590
A durdou.

507
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,289
"Durdou"?

508
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,923
What's that?

509
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,561
Frog.

510
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:48,367
What? A frog?

511
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:50,532
Thanks very much.

512
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:42,183
Hello.

513
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:44,244
You're up early.

514
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:49,083
Couldn't sleep.

515
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,065
There's something
I've got to tell you.

516
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:08,507
I'm due to marry
my first cousin, Jasmine,

517
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,547
in nine weeks.

518
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,379
Very funny.

519
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:20,583
- Honestly.
- I don't believe you.

520
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:23,923
Eleven words--

521
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,963
couldn't get them out.

522
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,567
So, what the fuck is this?

523
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:36,699
Hmm?

524
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:41,006
Is it some last-minute fling
before you settle down to married life?

525
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,239
- No, no.
- No?

526
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,282
What the fuck am I?

527
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:48,375
Some cheap fucking tart
at a stag party?

528
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:50,716
Jesus Christ.

529
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:55,124
I don't believe this.

530
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:07,332
Eleven little words, was it?

531
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,964
Well, here's another two for you:
fuck off!

532
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,751
I mean, why couldn't you tell me
before we got on the plane?

533
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,811
- I couldn't.
- Why?

534
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:27,755
Why didn't you tell me
last night?

535
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:33,526
I'm sorry.

536
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,466
You'd better not be here
when I get back.

537
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:41,732
I can't stand lies,
do you hear me?

538
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,773
I can't fucking stand them.

539
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:53,546
You really had me fooled.

540
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:59,755
I mean, I've been with some pricks
in my time,

541
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,282
I knew it at the time,
and I suffered the consequences.

542
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:11,666
But I really trusted you.

543
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:04,012
You're right, Roisin.

544
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:09,918
I shouldn't have let this happen.

545
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,696
I should've foreseen the hurt.

546
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:20,035
Should, should, should.
The story of my fucking life.

547
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:25,365
But I didn't...

548
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:29,271
which made me
realize something.

549
00:44:31,649 --> 00:44:34,083
I'm gonna go back home
and cancel the wedding.

550
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:40,055
It's too much for you to understand,
and I don't expect you to.

551
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,719
It'll probably
blow my family apart.

552
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,490
But what the fuck.

553
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,467
I don't want you to ever think
that you were just a cheap fling.

554
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:01,809
It wasn't like that.
I promise it was never like that.

555
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:05,412
I'm gonna book an early flight.

556
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,104
Thank you.

557
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:36,472
I've been away for three days.
My mom has left five messages.

558
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:41,037
You're lucky. I want you
to meet my friends, by the way.

559
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:43,945
I was thinking of having
a dinner party on Saturday night.

560
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,652
There's Miss Hanlon.
Hi, Miss.

561
00:46:52,923 --> 00:46:54,220
Hi.

562
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:56,282
Ah, there's half the school.

563
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:19,310
Look who it is over there.
It's the incredible disappearing man.

564
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:21,611
- Still here?
- Have you been away, big man?

565
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:24,620
I never even noticed. You were
that useless when you were here.

566
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:27,351
Your ma's been looking for you.

567
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:29,415
She's not brought you
your doughnuts yet?

568
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,657
- She don't give us doughnuts.
- What's that? We've not had a doughnut

569
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,527
for a week, big man.
I can feel my ribs.

570
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,123
Mom?

571
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:41,466
My son's here.
Is everything okay?

572
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,308
Fine.

573
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,900
Casim, are you doing okay?

574
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:54,208
Tell him the good news.

575
00:47:54,285 --> 00:47:56,378
- What happened?
- Tried to phone you

576
00:47:56,453 --> 00:47:59,354
so many times, but your mobile
was off or something. I don't know.

577
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,621
- Guess what?
- What?

578
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:06,653
- You tell him.
- Tell him the news.

579
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:08,665
- Mom.
- I think you should tell him.

580
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:10,324
You tell him.

581
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:12,665
- No, you tell him.
- Tell him.

582
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,704
What is it?

583
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,104
- We're getting married.
- Honestly?

584
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:19,301
- Yep.
- Praise be to God.

585
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:21,367
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

586
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:23,107
Mom, you must be so happy.

587
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,243
Yes, I tried to call you
many times.

588
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:40,197
- Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you.

589
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:41,730
Thanks.

590
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:53,766
How are you? Everything okay?

591
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:05,521
Listen. Let's get
one thing quite clear, right?

592
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,557
You're gonna get married.

593
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,616
You're gonna have kids.

594
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,628
You're gonna do
the mom and dad thing...

595
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,421
which is the right thing.

596
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,434
Shag who the fuck
you want to shag,

597
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:20,094
but don't fuck up
your whole family

598
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,138
and her family back home.

599
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:25,437
- It's not just about shagging, Hammid.
- What's it about then?

600
00:49:26,477 --> 00:49:27,876
What's it about?

601
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:30,436
There's so many
birds out there,

602
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:32,538
and you've been daft
over one bird.

603
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,244
- I've not been daft over her.
- Well, you're gonna drop--

604
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:37,115
you're gonna split
your whole family.

605
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:39,655
So, I'm just supposed
to marry somebody I don't know?

606
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:42,191
Aye. Just do it.
Who cares?

607
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:44,386
You've got a family
to think about.

608
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:49,054
You've got your religion to think about.
You've got that to think about.

609
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,794
Walk into there-- how are you
going to walk into there?

610
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,803
I'll lose her.

611
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:55,862
Give a fuck if you lose her.

612
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:59,307
Would you rather lose your family,
or would you rather lose this bird?

613
00:49:59,376 --> 00:50:02,038
- This bird is a nobody.
- She's not a nobody.

614
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:04,580
She is a nobody compared
to your family. Right?

615
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:07,607
Your family back home.
You've got a mosque right there.

616
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:11,985
Listen, you're being stupid
if you think for one minute

617
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:15,024
everyone's going to understand.
No one's going to understand.

618
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:17,185
As far as anyone's concerned,
she's a goree.

619
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:19,194
She's a white girl.
That's it.

620
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:21,696
She's not a Muslim.

621
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:27,066
Sarah can't make it, by the way.
It's just going to be the five of us.

622
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:29,105
- I'm not coming.
- Eh?

623
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,739
I'm not coming up.

624
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:38,805
What do you mean?

625
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:44,120
Why not?

626
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:48,414
Did you talk to your folks?

627
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,427
I tried to tell them last night.

628
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:55,926
Just couldn't find the words.

629
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:02,539
I feel so strong
when I'm around you.

630
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,475
It'll break their hearts.

631
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:09,535
It would destroy them.

632
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:13,481
What about your heart?

633
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:20,145
What about my heart?

634
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:25,160
Jasmine?

635
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:27,163
Do you love her?

636
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:31,395
You don't understand.
It's not about love.

637
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:36,062
It's much more than that.

638
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:39,438
So, what,
are you just gonna...

639
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,911
sit back and let your parents
make all your choices for you?

640
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,575
Or are you actually going to
do something about it

641
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,241
and say something to them?

642
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:50,286
I'm their only son.

643
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:56,125
I can't let them down.

644
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:58,423
I can't.

645
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:07,003
Casim.

646
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:13,269
We're good together,
you know?

647
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:15,311
I mean...

648
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:18,506
it's easy.

649
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:22,411
It feels right, you know?

650
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:26,014
And I think that we can--

651
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,853
if we want to,
we can make it work.

652
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:33,392
- For how long?
- I don't know, but who knows that?

653
00:52:33,464 --> 00:52:35,694
Does anybody
ever really know that?

654
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:38,462
You just...

655
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:41,968
you just take a chance.

656
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,431
I can't match you, Roisin.

657
00:52:49,646 --> 00:52:52,080
I can't match you.

658
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,171
I've got some good news, guys.

659
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:59,505
- Dad.
- Sorry.

660
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,518
- Dad.
- What is it?

661
00:54:01,618 --> 00:54:04,109
I got some really good news today.

662
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:09,758
I've been offered
an unconditional place

663
00:54:09,826 --> 00:54:11,817
at Edinburgh University.

664
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,030
Here, Dad.

665
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:30,241
There's 20 students
chasing every place.

666
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,051
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

667
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:37,986
Why Edinburgh?

668
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:40,080
Um...

669
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:43,490
because the course
I want to do is in Edinburgh.

670
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:48,122
Listen, dear, there are four or five
universities in this bloody city.

671
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:50,598
What the community
is gonna say?

672
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,598
It's a good university.
It's the only course I want to do.

673
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,735
Your brother-- your sister
went to Glasgow University,

674
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,212
and your bother went
to a university in Glasgow.

675
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:06,078
Are they not
good enough for you?

676
00:55:06,183 --> 00:55:08,413
No Dad, it's not that.
It's just--

677
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:10,715
I see you were there
for an interview.

678
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:12,721
- Yeah.
- You never asked us.

679
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:15,349
You never mentioned that you got
permission in the house

680
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:17,052
to go for an interview.

681
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:19,152
Look. I've got
an unconditional place.

682
00:55:19,229 --> 00:55:21,288
That's amazing
for someone my age.

683
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:24,162
If you could go
for an interview without intimating--

684
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:27,328
without getting permission,
what could you do when you're there?

685
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:30,396
Dad, one second.
Tahara, couldn't you just commute?

686
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:33,032
What's the point, then?
I might as well stay in Glasgow.

687
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,101
The whole part of this is so I can--

688
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:37,773
What's more important to you?

689
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:40,476
Education
or staying away from home?

690
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,685
There's unis in Glasgow as well.

691
00:55:44,755 --> 00:55:46,848
Can't you just commute, Tahara?

692
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:48,914
How can you say that? No, I cant!

693
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:52,120
It's not fair. I'm going to be
missing out on a whole different life.

694
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:56,029
I don't want to do that!
And why did you even get married

695
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:57,556
and come here and have kids?

696
00:55:57,634 --> 00:55:59,761
- What?
- Why? What's the point of kids here?

697
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:03,294
We're Western. I'm sorry,
but we're not from Pakistan.

698
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:05,568
Listen, don't change the subject.

699
00:56:05,642 --> 00:56:07,405
You are going to study
in Glasgow!

700
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:09,877
- I'm not changing the subject!
- You can't go there!

701
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:12,847
- It's the same bloody subject!
- And don't talk to me like that!

702
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:15,281
Right! Take it away!
Enough is enough.

703
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:17,616
Is this why
we got you educated?

704
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:19,383
That this day had to come?

705
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:21,788
You cannot go,
and that's final!

706
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:29,991
I'm sorry.

707
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:32,797
It just hurt.
It means so much.

708
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:35,861
Do you know
how much work I put--

709
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:38,636
do you know
how much work I put into--

710
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:40,677
no, Mom, please!

711
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,711
I've worked my ass off.

712
00:56:44,481 --> 00:56:47,712
- You're just overdramatic.
- Oh, just fuck off!

713
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:53,119
Don't you ever talk
to me like that again.

714
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:58,792
You are such a hypocrite.

715
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,321
Casim, look at me.

716
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,993
Look at me.
What's wrong?

717
00:57:05,102 --> 00:57:07,127
You're such
a fucking hypocrite!

718
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:09,195
Look at me!

719
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:14,772
I'll never forgive you for this.

720
00:57:14,845 --> 00:57:18,747
- You're only upset, honey.
- Mom...

721
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:34,758
You know what your father
is like.

722
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:39,234
Tell me what's wrong
with you.

723
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:42,363
You haven't spoken to me
for months.

724
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:45,670
Won't you tell your mom?

725
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:50,042
- She speaks the truth.
- What truth? You tell me.

726
00:57:51,648 --> 00:57:54,082
- I can't do it.
- What?

727
00:57:56,887 --> 00:58:00,288
I know you're
preparing things for me.

728
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:04,984
What can't you do?

729
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,893
I can't get married.

730
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:18,405
How can I tell your aunt now?

731
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:21,000
I can't go ahead with it, Mom.

732
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:23,341
This is not good.

733
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:29,408
What will Jasmine do?

734
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:33,149
- This will shame us.
- I'll sell the car.

735
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:35,589
I'll give you all the money back
for the extension.

736
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:39,093
- I can't go ahead with it.
- What has happened?

737
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:44,861
If you don't tell me,
how will I know?

738
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:49,798
I'm going to go
stay with Hammid.

739
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:51,999
What will I do?

740
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:04,683
My son, what will I do?

741
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:15,593
Yeah.
What, birthday parties?

742
00:59:15,665 --> 00:59:18,930
Are you having a fucking laugh, mate?
I don't do birthday parties.

743
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:22,562
I've not been doing birthday parties
for the last 10 years.

744
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:23,663
It's us, Annie.

745
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:26,038
Listen, if you want to,
phone me back again,

746
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:29,077
but I'm on the other line and I really need
to take this other call.

747
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:32,046
Listen, my other phone's ringing.
So, do you want to call back?

748
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:35,606
I'll speak to you soon, right?
Okay, mate. Yeah, hello.

749
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:38,245
Yeah, glam stuff.
That's us, yeah.

750
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:43,488
Aye, I can set you up
with anything you want, Bud.

751
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,687
I can give you
fucking Mull of Kintyre, Abba,

752
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:48,356
anything you want.
I'll give you it.

753
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:50,399
Uh-huh.

754
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:54,169
- Did you cover up?
- Aye, I can get you a DJ, no problem.

755
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:56,364
The guy you're probably
looking for is Casim.

756
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:00,675
750 quid.

757
01:00:02,178 --> 01:00:06,137
That's the fucking deposit, mate.
That's the deposit.

758
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,414
You're actually dressed
all right, tonight.

759
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:15,390
Don't take him on.
Don't take him on.

760
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:17,426
My wee sweetheart.

761
01:00:20,797 --> 01:00:23,197
He can't talk to the girls.

762
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,234
He's just a lad.

763
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:02,328
Roisin.

764
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,531
How have you been?

765
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:07,543
Great.

766
01:01:07,644 --> 01:01:10,272
I didn't want to disturb you.
You looked busy.

767
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:14,380
I'm kept busy.

768
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:18,552
I don't suppose you'd fancy
meeting up some time?

769
01:01:21,992 --> 01:01:24,392
No.

770
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:26,452
No, I don't really see the point.

771
01:01:28,064 --> 01:01:30,294
I really miss you.

772
01:01:35,005 --> 01:01:36,973
Roisin...

773
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:39,268
I think about you
all the time.

774
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:45,013
I have to go now.

775
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,588
Thanks.

776
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,335
Do you have any ghee?

777
01:02:14,411 --> 01:02:17,869
Yes, on that shelf.

778
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:20,940
That big or small one?

779
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:23,281
£1.50... that is £1.50.

780
01:02:23,353 --> 01:02:26,322
- Should I put it there?
- Yes, put it down there.

781
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:28,324
Thank you.

782
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:33,889
Hi, dear.
Is that all you want?

783
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:35,988
- Yeah.
- 47 p, please.

784
01:02:39,335 --> 01:02:41,860
- Here you are. Thank you.
- Thank you.

785
01:02:41,938 --> 01:02:44,566
- You'll manage or you want a bag?
- That's fine thank you.

786
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,575
Okay. That's great.
Thanks very much.

787
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,648
Miss Hanlon?

788
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:57,583
You don't have a cat, miss,
do you?

789
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,158
No.

790
01:03:02,258 --> 01:03:04,192
Were you here
to see Casim, then?

791
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,251
No, Tahara, I wasn't.

792
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:26,204
That's much better.
It is much better.

793
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:27,840
You did it a little bit again.

794
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:30,545
Roisin? Sorry, could I have
a word, please?

795
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,020
Yeah, of course you can.
Just give it a wee practice.

796
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:34,954
I'll be back in a second.

797
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,022
Hi.

798
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:41,427
I just noticed that your
Certificate of Approval

799
01:03:41,498 --> 01:03:43,056
- is out of date.
- All right.

800
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:44,862
We need one
to finalize the details,

801
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:47,402
so if you could get one,
take it to your parish priest,

802
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:49,096
ask him to sign it
and that's it,

803
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:51,139
- full-time post.
- Okay. Great. Thanks.

804
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:10,124
Walk.

805
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:13,186
Walk.

806
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:20,469
Hello?

807
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:24,263
Tahara told me
you called off the wedding...

808
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:28,936
and that you've
moved out of home.

809
01:04:37,053 --> 01:04:38,987
- Hi.
- Hi.

810
01:04:46,362 --> 01:04:48,489
- What was that for?
- 'Cause you're a bastard.

811
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:50,556
And you deserve it.

812
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:55,701
- You're the bastard.
- I am not.

813
01:04:57,407 --> 01:05:00,171
You're a prick.

814
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:02,210
Prickette.

815
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:04,269
Dick.

816
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:08,343
Dickette.

817
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:36,704
I really missed you.

818
01:05:36,813 --> 01:05:39,646
I missed you.

819
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,918
Let's fuck.

820
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:24,553
Roisin, you're going
to have to duck down.

821
01:06:24,661 --> 01:06:26,595
- Quickly. Seriously.
- Are you serious?

822
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:28,392
- Seriously.
- Casim...

823
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:30,989
It's another one
of my cousin's take-aways.

824
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:34,059
- That's you.
- That's the last time I'm doing that.

825
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:37,196
- No, you have have to do it again if--
- How many cousins do you have?

826
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:55,918
- Here you go, Miss Hanlon.
- Ooh, lovely.

827
01:06:55,992 --> 01:06:59,155
- Glab jamin and ice cream.
- Glab jammin.

828
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,958
- No. Glab jamin and ice cream.
- Jamin.

829
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:05,365
Thanks very much.
What is it?

830
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:09,096
Glab jamin and ice cream.

831
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:13,041
Thank you.

832
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:30,258
It's my mom.

833
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:32,954
Hello?

834
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:35,190
Peace be on you.

835
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:43,738
Mom...
don't cry, Mom.

836
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:49,443
I'll come tomorrow.

837
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:54,680
Promise, Mom, that--

838
01:07:57,253 --> 01:07:59,244
Mom, don't cry.

839
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:04,084
Mom, don't say that.

840
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:11,292
God bless.

841
01:08:15,271 --> 01:08:17,205
What's wrong?

842
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:19,264
She found my dad
lying in my bed.

843
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:23,468
He had a nightmare.

844
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:28,908
Let me show you something.

845
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:38,994
- My dad's a twin.
- Is he?

846
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:42,587
Och, look.
They're lovely.

847
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,291
Hmm.

848
01:08:47,303 --> 01:08:49,601
Where were these taken?

849
01:08:49,705 --> 01:08:51,639
India.

850
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:53,698
Their eighth birthday.

851
01:08:53,743 --> 01:08:56,507
Two months
before Partition, 1947.

852
01:08:57,547 --> 01:08:59,378
They were Muslims
living in India.

853
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:01,679
Had to get over
to Pakistan.

854
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,310
Sikhs and Hindus
fled the other way.

855
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:09,758
15 million people
on the march...

856
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:13,261
plus two.

857
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:19,829
He said it was like
a journey from hell.

858
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:24,373
The whole fucking place
exploded in hysteria.

859
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,670
Muslims butchered Hindus.

860
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:28,733
Hindus slaughtered Muslims.

861
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:32,742
Hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of people died.

862
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:41,086
Halfway through...

863
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:43,591
they were caught in an ambush
outside a village.

864
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:47,452
My dad's brother
was kidnapped.

865
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,998
He was never, ever seen again.

866
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,461
It's marked my dad for life.

867
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:01,409
What was his name?

868
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:04,913
Casim.

869
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:12,280
I'd love to meet them.

870
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:15,152
You know,
get to know them slowly.

871
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:17,192
Did you ever imagine
being a Muslim?

872
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:19,227
No.

873
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:23,088
Under any circumstances?

874
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:27,192
No.

875
01:10:27,236 --> 01:10:30,296
Well, they can't imagine me being
with someone who's not a Muslim.

876
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:33,534
I have a friend who's been living
with his girlfriend

877
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:35,406
for seven years.

878
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:38,844
His parents think there's a whole bunch of
them who share a flat together.

879
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:41,349
I couldn't live a lie
like that, Casim. No way.

880
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:45,010
It's easier for you.

881
01:10:45,054 --> 01:10:47,113
Nothing to lose.

882
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:49,157
"Can't live a lie."

883
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:51,216
It's a self-indulgence.

884
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,228
What are you talking about?

885
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,263
Do you want me to break
with my family?

886
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,634
I mean break forever.

887
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:04,039
Could you do that
with your mom?

888
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:10,145
And what do you ask
of them?

889
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:14,308
They can't make the jump, Roisin.

890
01:11:15,351 --> 01:11:17,478
- They can't.
- So, what, people can't change?

891
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:19,214
They're beyond that.

892
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:22,390
I mean, if they see me living here,

893
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,688
my whole life
would be destroyed with them.

894
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:29,097
So what are we gonna do?

895
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,460
Just tell little lies
for the rest of our...

896
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:36,504
time together?

897
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:40,865
I almost said "lives."

898
01:11:58,894 --> 01:11:59,826
- Hello.
- Hello.

899
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:02,386
- I'm here to see Father Chambers.
- Are you expected?

900
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:05,798
- Yeah, I've got an appointment.
- Would you like to wait inside, please?

901
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:10,199
Can I have
your name, please?

902
01:12:10,306 --> 01:12:12,240
It's Roisin Hanlon.

903
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:22,650
- Morning, Father.
- Go straight through.

904
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:32,191
I haven't seen you at Mass
for some time, Roisin.

905
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:34,491
I take it you've been
attending another parish.

906
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:40,596
The school have offered me
a permanent position,

907
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:44,197
and since I'd be moving from a temporary
contract into a full-time post,

908
01:12:44,273 --> 01:12:47,242
I just need my
Certificate of Approval updated,

909
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:49,335
so I'd be grateful
if you could sign it for me.

910
01:12:51,447 --> 01:12:54,382
And that's it, yes?
Simple as that.

911
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,441
"Thank you, Father.
Goodbye, Father."

912
01:12:56,485 --> 01:12:59,511
I was given this
by the Archdiocese.

913
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:01,556
The appropriate section
being the update

914
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:03,591
of the Educate Scotland Act, 1918.

915
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:05,650
In particular...

916
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:09,722
the amendments of 1989,
schedule 10, paragraph 8.

917
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:14,099
"Each teacher shall be approved
as to his religious belief and character

918
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,035
by the representative
of the Church

919
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:19,097
in whose interest the school
is being conducted."

920
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:24,175
What do you think is the rationale behind
Catholic schools?

921
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:28,707
"It is a community of faith,

922
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,877
where pupils
and teachers work together,

923
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:34,888
recognizing that they share
the same Christian values."

924
01:13:36,926 --> 01:13:40,885
What do you make of that?
That is the law of the land.

925
01:13:43,432 --> 01:13:46,162
I wasn't aware
of the details, Father.

926
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:48,430
Well, it's even more
specific than you think.

927
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:51,063
As parish priest,

928
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,303
I have to satisfy myself
that the teacher in question

929
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:56,640
"is giving public witness

930
01:13:56,712 --> 01:13:58,703
to their faith in their daily life."

931
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:00,716
Now, that is quite clear, Roisin.

932
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:05,386
Okay, I'm not going
to beat around the bush.

933
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:08,986
Are you living with a man?

934
01:14:09,058 --> 01:14:10,821
Sorry?

935
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:14,726
Are you having sex
outside of marriage?

936
01:14:14,764 --> 01:14:17,232
- That's none of your business.
- It is my business.

937
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:19,234
You've not been listening.

938
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:21,269
I have a responsibility
to the parents

939
01:14:21,337 --> 01:14:23,567
of those Catholic children
that you teach.

940
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:26,073
I am a priest. I'm not some
nine-to-five bureaucrat

941
01:14:26,142 --> 01:14:28,133
who's here to just
to rubberstamp things.

942
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:30,907
I mean, what are you thinking?
You think you can get into bed

943
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,949
with any Tom, Dick or Mohammed
and then teach wee Catholic kids?

944
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:36,609
- What did you say?
- You heard fine well what I said!

945
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:39,210
- Who have you been talking to?
- None of your business!

946
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:41,085
None of my business?!

947
01:14:41,157 --> 01:14:43,557
I'm sorry, but this is my life
you're talking about.

948
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:46,594
It's my job--
my career!

949
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:49,028
And who do you think you are
to speak to me like this,

950
01:14:49,098 --> 01:14:51,658
like I'm your housekeeper
or some altar boy!?

951
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:53,701
I am your parish priest!

952
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:56,465
I'll speak to you
in whatever manner I see fit!

953
01:14:56,572 --> 01:14:58,665
Now sit down!
I warn you.

954
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:00,969
If you want to keep
this job of yours,

955
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:04,136
I suggest you take a seat.
Now sit!

956
01:15:07,183 --> 01:15:09,083
Now...

957
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:11,119
let's both take
a deep breath

958
01:15:11,187 --> 01:15:13,553
and see if we can
sort this out amicably.

959
01:15:13,622 --> 01:15:15,590
Now, I do not doubt
for a second

960
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:17,318
that you are
a wonderful teacher.

961
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:19,384
In fact, I've got letters
from the school

962
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:22,727
saying how fantastic you are,
but I have to listen to my conscience.

963
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:25,733
In the eyes of the Catholic Church,

964
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:28,292
you are still a married woman.

965
01:15:28,404 --> 01:15:30,929
Now, you're a young woman.
You can apply for annulment.

966
01:15:32,308 --> 01:15:34,606
This boy you're living with,
is he a Catholic?

967
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:39,108
- No.
- Would he consider becoming a Catholic?

968
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:43,910
- We haven't spoken about it.
- Well, I suggest you do.

969
01:15:44,019 --> 01:15:47,147
And anyway, even if he doesn't want
to become a Catholic,

970
01:15:47,223 --> 01:15:50,021
we're not living in the Dark Ages.
When you get an annulment,

971
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:52,559
you can get a special dispensation
from the Church

972
01:15:52,628 --> 01:15:54,823
and then you can get married
on the condition

973
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:56,830
that you both vow
that you will bring up

974
01:15:56,866 --> 01:15:59,096
your children as Catholics.

975
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:01,966
Now, in the meantime,

976
01:16:02,037 --> 01:16:04,028
you cannot live in sin

977
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,064
and come in here

978
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:08,371
and ask me
to rubberstamp it,

979
01:16:08,444 --> 01:16:10,435
or give you
some seal of approval.

980
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,607
You might not like that,
but that's simply the way it is.

981
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:17,208
The faith of our fathers
is not for the faint-hearted.

982
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:18,878
Though I'll give you
some advice.

983
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:22,856
You go home, you kick him out
and you get married.

984
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:24,892
And if you're not prepared
to do that,

985
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,986
I suggest you go
and teach the Protestants.

986
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,638
He was rude,
he was patronizing...

987
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:52,980
and he was horrible.
The whole thing was horrible.

988
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:57,049
I mean, it's an ordinary school
supported 100% by public taxes--

989
01:16:57,126 --> 01:17:01,324
our taxes, at that. What my private life has
to do with anything, I have no idea.

990
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:05,493
"Living in sin."
The fucking cheek of him.

991
01:17:07,403 --> 01:17:09,394
What would your mom
have made of all this?

992
01:17:10,406 --> 01:17:13,398
Oh, God, I don't know.
I mean, she would have supported me,

993
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:16,706
she probably would have said,
"I just want you to be happy."

994
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:18,541
And then probably
a day or two later,

995
01:17:18,614 --> 01:17:20,844
she would have said,
"What about the children?"

996
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:23,510
They won't say it,
but that's what they're thinking.

997
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:25,519
What color are they gonna be?

998
01:17:25,621 --> 01:17:28,784
What's their hair going to be like?
Are they going to be circumcised?

999
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:30,916
What school are you going
to send them to?

1000
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:33,426
What religious stamp
are you going to stick to them?

1001
01:17:33,462 --> 01:17:36,260
They're fucking bigots!
It drives me fucking insane!

1002
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:40,291
If it's not the Holy Willy priest
and his cronies on one side,

1003
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:42,564
it's your dad and fucking
mullahs on the other,

1004
01:17:42,638 --> 01:17:45,436
- and we're stuck in the middle.
- Don't say that, Roisin.

1005
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:46,599
Eh?

1006
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,973
- Don't call my dad a bigot.
- What is he, then?

1007
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,239
He could be a lot of things,
but he's not a bigot.

1008
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:54,510
You said so yourself, Casim.
You said he'd look straight through me.

1009
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,483
I don't care what I said.
He's not a bigot.

1010
01:17:56,552 --> 01:17:58,918
- I care what you said.
- You don't know him, Roisin.

1011
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:01,286
Because you're too scared
to introduce me to him.

1012
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:03,120
You're white,
you don't understand.

1013
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:14,699
Sign it.

1014
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:18,667
- Is that my resignation?
- Your contract.

1015
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:20,765
I haven't got
the Certificate of Approval.

1016
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:22,901
I don't care.

1017
01:18:22,978 --> 01:18:25,708
This is your head
on the line, Michael.

1018
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:27,408
I said...

1019
01:18:27,483 --> 01:18:29,610
sign it.

1020
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:32,210
You do know I'm still
living with him and--

1021
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:34,585
That's none of my business, Roisin,

1022
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,217
and as far as I'm concerned, it's none
of that old fanatic's business either.

1023
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:40,887
You've done
a first-class job here.

1024
01:18:40,996 --> 01:18:43,931
Look, do I have to forge
that signature for you?

1025
01:18:43,999 --> 01:18:45,626
No.

1026
01:19:08,857 --> 01:19:11,087
Excuse me.

1027
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,357
- Are you Miss Hanlon?
- Yeah.

1028
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:17,991
My name's Rukhsana Khan.
I'm Casim's older sister.

1029
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:19,728
Hi.

1030
01:19:19,835 --> 01:19:23,134
Is it possible to have
a chat with you?

1031
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:24,830
Yeah, sure. Do you want
to come up?

1032
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:27,374
Could we go elsewhere?

1033
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:33,942
- Tea?
- Thanks.

1034
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:36,745
- Thanks.
- This is great, thanks.

1035
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:48,587
Roisin, you must be wondering
why I've asked to--

1036
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:50,723
well, I've come to see you,
I suppose.

1037
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,563
You must think this is
very odd, but...

1038
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:55,728
basically I feel that I had
to talk to you

1039
01:19:55,804 --> 01:19:58,500
because of what's
going on just now with my family.

1040
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:04,507
Casim's left home
and he's living with you...

1041
01:20:05,581 --> 01:20:08,482
and as far
as my family's concerned

1042
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:10,518
and my community's concerned,

1043
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:12,952
he's brought a great deal
of shame on all of us.

1044
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:16,650
See, we have this concept
called izzat,

1045
01:20:16,725 --> 01:20:20,092
which, I guess, is family honor.

1046
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:23,221
And that's really important
to people.

1047
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:26,597
My parents all their life
have worked very, very hard

1048
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:28,761
to maintain that,
to keep that,

1049
01:20:28,837 --> 01:20:31,829
and they've built up
respect and trust in the community.

1050
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:36,468
And what Casim has done

1051
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:38,536
has basically taken that away.

1052
01:20:38,614 --> 01:20:40,775
Not only that...

1053
01:20:42,651 --> 01:20:44,881
I don't know if Casim
told you, but...

1054
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:50,024
I met Amar through my family...

1055
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,825
and we got on really well.
Our families got on really well.

1056
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,454
We're very fond of each other.

1057
01:20:58,267 --> 01:21:00,565
And in the short time
that we've known each other,

1058
01:21:00,636 --> 01:21:03,901
we feel very strongly
and we both want to get married.

1059
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:09,043
But because of what
Casim's done...

1060
01:21:12,281 --> 01:21:15,512
his mother found out
and canceled the wedding.

1061
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:22,480
I love your brother.

1062
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,727
Why can't you accept that?

1063
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:28,753
For how long?

1064
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:33,234
l-- I don't know.

1065
01:21:34,403 --> 01:21:38,362
When will you know?
When everybody's lives are fucked up?

1066
01:21:38,473 --> 01:21:41,271
Can't you understand
what's going on?

1067
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:45,437
Can't you understand
that because of your love,

1068
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:48,915
that so many people's lives
are being destroyed?

1069
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,413
You clearly don't understand,
do you?

1070
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:58,659
Roisin, I'm just gonna
ask you straight:

1071
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:01,059
will you leave my brother?

1072
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:05,833
Please, will you leave
my brother?

1073
01:22:08,237 --> 01:22:09,932
No.

1074
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:16,931
Roisin, can I have
a word with you?

1075
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:28,772
I need to have a quick word with you.
Come over here,

1076
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:31,011
away from the classroom.

1077
01:23:31,086 --> 01:23:34,749
Roisin, I am so sorry.

1078
01:23:34,823 --> 01:23:37,883
I just had a call
from the Director of Education,

1079
01:23:37,993 --> 01:23:41,451
and I'm afraid you're out,
and I'm in a bit of trouble.

1080
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:45,091
They're going to move you on
to a non-denominational school

1081
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,998
on Monday, so I'm afraid
this is your last day.

1082
01:23:50,005 --> 01:23:52,098
This is ridiculous.

1083
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:54,368
I agree.

1084
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:58,470
So I start at another school
on Monday?

1085
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:00,742
Yes, I'm afraid so.

1086
01:24:01,817 --> 01:24:05,082
What about the students? Can I not
work till the end of the term, or--

1087
01:24:05,153 --> 01:24:07,849
I know, I know,
and I regret that bit of it,

1088
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:10,915
but I'm afraid all you can do
is go back in there

1089
01:24:10,959 --> 01:24:13,086
and say that
you're having to leave,

1090
01:24:13,161 --> 01:24:15,493
and that this will be
the last day.

1091
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:18,933
It's shocking, I know.

1092
01:24:18,967 --> 01:24:21,435
And they will be
as disappointed as I am.

1093
01:24:42,657 --> 01:24:44,648
- Hello?
- Casim, move your ass.

1094
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,661
Get down the stairs,
or we're gonna fuck up

1095
01:24:47,763 --> 01:24:49,355
- this whole deal.
- Okay.

1096
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:51,295
Give me a minute,
I'm coming.

1097
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:53,357
- Give me a minute.
- Move it!

1098
01:24:54,903 --> 01:24:58,361
I need to go. I'm meeting
those backers from London.

1099
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:00,100
Can you postpone?

1100
01:25:00,175 --> 01:25:02,302
We're picking them up
at the airport just now.

1101
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:04,902
Why don't you give him the plans
and he can go on his own?

1102
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,743
He needs me to come along
with him.

1103
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:09,181
Well, I kind of need you here.

1104
01:25:09,284 --> 01:25:11,775
- I lost my job today.
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.

1105
01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:13,582
It won't take long.

1106
01:25:13,688 --> 01:25:16,156
If it's not Hammid,
it's the priest.

1107
01:25:16,224 --> 01:25:18,488
If it's not the priest,
it's your bloody sister.

1108
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:21,221
- My sister's okay.
- She's okay?

1109
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:23,491
She asked me to leave you.

1110
01:25:24,533 --> 01:25:26,501
Roisin, I need to go.
It's important to me.

1111
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:28,330
And this is important to me.

1112
01:25:28,403 --> 01:25:31,804
I've tried to understand
your sister, Casim, I really have,

1113
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:34,501
I've tried to understand
your whole family, in fact.

1114
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:37,305
If your dad's such a great guy,
I don't see why he can't start

1115
01:25:37,412 --> 01:25:40,176
- treating me like a human being.
- If you'd been in his shoes,

1116
01:25:40,248 --> 01:25:43,046
- you might not be so quick to judge.
- Right, here we go again.

1117
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:45,109
Here we go again?
Here we go again?

1118
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,313
Have you ever
had a dog set on you, Roisin?

1119
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:50,391
Have a group of kids chasing after you,
making monkey noises?

1120
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:52,359
I don't think so.

1121
01:25:52,427 --> 01:25:55,328
Do you have any idea how many times
he had to keep his mouth shut?

1122
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,728
The humiliation, the insults
he's been through?

1123
01:25:57,833 --> 01:25:59,596
No, none whatsoever.

1124
01:25:59,668 --> 01:26:01,431
Have you ever been
spat on, in fact?

1125
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:04,630
Just ask Rukhsana what it feels like
to have a grog run down her face.

1126
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:06,832
Okay, so there's racist bastards
out there--

1127
01:26:06,942 --> 01:26:08,842
I saw my father stabbed, Roisin.

1128
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:11,107
He nearly bled to death
in my arms.

1129
01:26:11,179 --> 01:26:14,148
So excuse fucking me.

1130
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,222
I'm fucking coming.
Wait. Wait.

1131
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,620
That's not fair, Casim.
It's not my fault.

1132
01:26:29,764 --> 01:26:33,222
It's not my family's fault if they're
treated like Paki foreigners...

1133
01:26:34,302 --> 01:26:35,735
not quite up to the mark.

1134
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:46,140
I need to go, Roisin.

1135
01:26:48,683 --> 01:26:50,913
- It's really important I meet them.
- Stay.

1136
01:26:50,986 --> 01:26:54,717
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Casim, I'm asking you to stay, please.

1137
01:26:54,789 --> 01:26:56,654
It's our backers from London.

1138
01:26:56,725 --> 01:26:58,693
Yeah, I know that,
but I'm a--

1139
01:26:58,793 --> 01:27:01,091
If they like us,
it's our big chance.

1140
01:27:01,196 --> 01:27:03,221
Right, well maybe
your sister's right then.

1141
01:27:03,298 --> 01:27:06,199
- Maybe we shouldn't be with each other.
- Maybe we shouldn't.

1142
01:27:06,234 --> 01:27:08,099
- Well, fuck you, then.
- Fuck off, then.

1143
01:27:08,203 --> 01:27:10,671
Whatever. Dick.

1144
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:56,808
Roisin?

1145
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:02,249
Roisin, can you take
the chain off, please?

1146
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:10,631
Is everything okay?

1147
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:13,600
- She's not answering her mobile.
- Still not got a hold of her?

1148
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:17,570
Here, babes. Don't worry, maybe she's
gone out or something.

1149
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:19,301
- Okay? Don't worry.
- Okay.

1150
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,877
Hi, Roisin, if you're in,
pick up the phone.

1151
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:31,145
I'm so sorry.

1152
01:28:31,219 --> 01:28:33,779
I feel like shit. I promise
I'll make it up to you.

1153
01:28:33,888 --> 01:28:36,823
If you're making me squirm,
it's working, I deserve it.

1154
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:40,588
I've got some good news. They're
putting up the money for the club.

1155
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:43,823
We're all going out to celebrate.
I can't do that without you.

1156
01:28:43,898 --> 01:28:45,889
I'll have no one to spin
on the dance floor.

1157
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:47,969
Please call me
when you get back in.

1158
01:28:48,036 --> 01:28:50,300
Or if you're in,
please pick up, honey.

1159
01:28:50,405 --> 01:28:52,873
See you soon, my durdou.

1160
01:29:04,019 --> 01:29:06,419
Casim.

1161
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:08,786
- That was your mom on the phone.
- What'd she say?

1162
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:11,655
That you're always engaged.
She's trying to get hold of you.

1163
01:29:11,726 --> 01:29:13,353
Call her back.

1164
01:29:14,429 --> 01:29:15,987
Anything else?

1165
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,862
- Well, she's not gonna tell me.
- Give her a wee phone.

1166
01:29:22,337 --> 01:29:24,066
Hello, Tahara?

1167
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:29,701
Wh-- wh-- Tahara?

1168
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:31,507
Are you still there?

1169
01:29:32,847 --> 01:29:34,872
What was that?

1170
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:36,507
She got cut off.

1171
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:39,451
It may have been a bad reception,
don't worry about it.

1172
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:41,488
No, I was calling
the house phone.

1173
01:29:41,556 --> 01:29:44,957
I think it might have something
to do with your mom, no?

1174
01:29:47,896 --> 01:29:51,388
Hi, Miss Hanlon. This is Rukhsana,
Casim's sister.

1175
01:29:51,466 --> 01:29:54,367
I was hoping that I could
meet up with you--

1176
01:29:54,402 --> 01:29:56,199
Hello?

1177
01:29:57,772 --> 01:29:59,433
Hi.

1178
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:04,540
What is it?

1179
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:08,582
Show me what?

1180
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:38,809
Hello, Dad.

1181
01:30:38,913 --> 01:30:41,643
- How nice to see you, Casim.
- Is everything all right?

1182
01:30:41,716 --> 01:30:44,082
Oh, fine, everything is fine.
But we miss you.

1183
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:48,380
Gosh, how nice to see you.

1184
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:52,586
- Isn't that Amar's car?
- Aw, leave it. Leave it.

1185
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,628
What do you think of it?

1186
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:57,893
- Is Tahara okay?
- Yeah, she's in her room, studying.

1187
01:30:57,966 --> 01:30:59,991
Come on. She's fine.

1188
01:31:00,068 --> 01:31:01,933
What do you think of it?

1189
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:04,529
- We got it finished.
- All done?

1190
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:07,540
Oh, aye. I wanna show you
the inside of it.

1191
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:11,312
There you are, all finito.

1192
01:31:14,449 --> 01:31:16,474
This is your fitted kitchen.

1193
01:31:19,988 --> 01:31:22,957
See? Real McKay stuff.

1194
01:31:28,062 --> 01:31:30,326
And Casim, see that?

1195
01:31:30,398 --> 01:31:32,263
Real pine wood.

1196
01:31:34,469 --> 01:31:38,098
And your sister, Rukhsana thought
you would need the internet stuff.

1197
01:31:38,173 --> 01:31:40,664
- What do you call it?
- Laptop.

1198
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:43,074
Aye. There you are,
it's all yours.

1199
01:31:56,524 --> 01:32:00,187
- Why are we stopped here?
- This is our house.

1200
01:32:00,295 --> 01:32:02,126
Um...

1201
01:32:06,201 --> 01:32:08,897
What am I doing here, Rukhsana?

1202
01:32:09,003 --> 01:32:11,767
Just wait and see.

1203
01:32:14,909 --> 01:32:16,843
That's Amar, there.

1204
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:21,013
That's the extension
my father's been working on.

1205
01:32:21,115 --> 01:32:23,106
He's completely
obsessed with it.

1206
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:26,787
Well, are we gonna go in, or just...

1207
01:32:28,323 --> 01:32:30,723
Just, just--
that's my mom.

1208
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:34,818
She's missed Casim
so much.

1209
01:32:34,863 --> 01:32:37,024
Is that Casim?

1210
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:45,128
Are we gonna go meet them?

1211
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:48,875
Just wait one second.

1212
01:32:50,778 --> 01:32:54,646
Are you okay?

1213
01:32:54,682 --> 01:32:58,277
I've kept it a secret.

1214
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,352
Greet your aunt.

1215
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:09,760
How are you?

1216
01:33:09,864 --> 01:33:12,492
Aren't you going to answer?

1217
01:33:13,668 --> 01:33:15,363
Won't you reply?

1218
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:17,734
Come here, Casim.

1219
01:33:19,908 --> 01:33:21,466
You're looking well.

1220
01:33:21,576 --> 01:33:23,305
Who are they?

1221
01:33:24,379 --> 01:33:26,813
That's... Jasmine.

1222
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:29,782
- Casim's fiancée.
- Och, for fuck's sake, Rukhsana!

1223
01:33:29,884 --> 01:33:31,511
What the fuck am I doing here?

1224
01:33:31,586 --> 01:33:34,384
What are you trying to do,
just rub it in my face, is that it?

1225
01:33:37,492 --> 01:33:39,585
- I didn't mean to upset you--
- Oh, did you not?

1226
01:33:39,694 --> 01:33:42,595
What did you think
you were trying to do to me, huh?

1227
01:33:42,697 --> 01:33:45,165
My intention's not to upset you,
I just want you to see

1228
01:33:45,233 --> 01:33:47,827
what's going on, how we live,
what our family's like.

1229
01:33:47,902 --> 01:33:51,668
Can't you see that this'll
all be destroyed if...

1230
01:33:51,739 --> 01:33:55,869
I was told that the wedding
is off. Is the wedding off?

1231
01:33:55,944 --> 01:34:00,210
No, you see? Casim, will
go ahead with the marriage.

1232
01:34:05,553 --> 01:34:07,646
His family is very important to him.

1233
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:15,930
So what is this? You're
just gonna leave me sitting here

1234
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:18,055
like some fucking idiot
and rub it in my face?

1235
01:34:18,132 --> 01:34:20,566
My intention is to show you
what's going on here

1236
01:34:20,635 --> 01:34:23,126
and show you that that's my family.
I care about them.

1237
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:26,163
Okay? And I'm not prepared
to give all of that up

1238
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,401
plus Amar up for someone
who doesn't even know

1239
01:34:28,476 --> 01:34:30,569
they're gonna love
my brother next week.

1240
01:34:32,347 --> 01:34:36,010
You're fucked, Rukhsana. You and your
whole fucking family is fucked.

1241
01:34:41,289 --> 01:34:44,122
Stay here.

1242
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:47,684
It's nothing.

1243
01:34:48,796 --> 01:34:51,264
You go in.

1244
01:34:56,404 --> 01:35:01,103
What's this?
You should talk to them.

1245
01:35:01,175 --> 01:35:04,167
- How far have they come?
- From Pakistan.

1246
01:35:04,278 --> 01:35:07,975
Why? I don't understand.

1247
01:35:08,082 --> 01:35:10,642
But they came for the wedding.

1248
01:35:10,718 --> 01:35:12,811
- What wedding?
- Yours!

1249
01:35:12,887 --> 01:35:14,878
With Jasmine.

1250
01:35:14,922 --> 01:35:17,220
When I left,
what did I say?

1251
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:18,918
Dad, what did I say
before I left?

1252
01:35:18,993 --> 01:35:22,827
But they don't
know anything.

1253
01:35:22,897 --> 01:35:25,991
- Let's go sit.
- I don't want to.

1254
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,399
Casim, Casim, I've been trying
to tell you, but they've got my mobile.

1255
01:35:29,504 --> 01:35:31,495
- They've got Roisin outside.
- They what?!

1256
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:33,540
They've got Roisin outside,
in the car.

1257
01:35:33,608 --> 01:35:35,542
- Casim! Casim!
- Rukhsana brought her.

1258
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:37,271
Hey! Come back here!

1259
01:35:38,312 --> 01:35:41,145
- What the fuck is going on?
- Rukhsana, stop him!

1260
01:35:41,215 --> 01:35:43,342
You come back here!

1261
01:35:43,418 --> 01:35:45,318
I don't know where she's gone.

1262
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:47,251
I can't believe this!
What's going on?

1263
01:35:47,321 --> 01:35:49,346
- She's gone.
- Where is she?

1264
01:35:49,424 --> 01:35:52,825
- You come back here.
- Casim, come with me.

1265
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:55,327
- I'm not coming back anywhere.
- Forget her!

1266
01:35:55,363 --> 01:35:58,491
No!

1267
01:35:59,867 --> 01:36:01,732
Rukhsana, take your mom inside.

1268
01:36:01,836 --> 01:36:04,600
- Is this some sort of fucking joke?
- I may not be as clever

1269
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:08,631
or educated like you are, but I'm
your father. Please try to understand.

1270
01:36:08,743 --> 01:36:12,338
Right. Listen. See, you could
be with them 100 years,

1271
01:36:12,447 --> 01:36:14,938
they'll still call you
black bastard, right?

1272
01:36:15,049 --> 01:36:18,780
You're still the same to them.
Think of 25 years down the road.

1273
01:36:18,853 --> 01:36:21,344
What happens when you don't
have your health,

1274
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:24,357
your money, your resources,
your business?

1275
01:36:24,459 --> 01:36:26,290
What'll happen?
She'll kick you out.

1276
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,987
- Right?
- You don't know that, Dad.

1277
01:36:28,062 --> 01:36:31,225
Listen, don't let a cheap goree
come between us.

1278
01:36:31,299 --> 01:36:34,427
They'll throw you out
in the street. She'll find another man.

1279
01:36:34,502 --> 01:36:36,868
What about values?
Right?

1280
01:36:36,971 --> 01:36:39,667
What about your culture,
your religion, right?

1281
01:36:39,774 --> 01:36:42,504
Listen to your mom.
We're your parents.

1282
01:36:42,577 --> 01:36:45,512
We'll die for you.
We'll do anything for you.

1283
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:48,481
You're are only son.
You're our future.

1284
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:51,051
Respect my choice then, Dad.
That's all I ask of you.

1285
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,280
- We do. We do!
- Respect my fucking choice!

1286
01:36:53,387 --> 01:36:55,787
- Casim.
- You don't understand that, right?

1287
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,653
Meet her, then.
Her name's Roisin.

1288
01:36:57,725 --> 01:37:00,751
Meet her, talk to her,
get to know her! Can you do that?

1289
01:37:00,828 --> 01:37:02,659
Listen, I'll ask you one more time.

1290
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:04,960
You're not asking me, Dad,
you're telling me.

1291
01:37:05,032 --> 01:37:07,762
You've done that your whole life.
Your whole fucking life

1292
01:37:07,835 --> 01:37:10,065
- you've told me.
- Don't swear like that to me.

1293
01:37:10,138 --> 01:37:12,606
- Just give her a chance.
- Don't swear like that to me.

1294
01:37:12,707 --> 01:37:14,868
Casim! Come back!

1295
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:19,573
Oh God!
You bastard, you!

1296
01:37:19,647 --> 01:37:22,673
Oh God, you do that for them.

1297
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:25,719
Bastard! Bastard!

1298
01:37:25,753 --> 01:37:27,983
Bastard! Bastards!

1299
01:37:28,055 --> 01:37:29,716
Stop it!

1300
01:37:30,424 --> 01:37:33,325
Bastards! Come on!

1301
01:37:33,361 --> 01:37:35,829
Don't fucking do that!

1302
01:37:41,869 --> 01:37:43,769
Roisin?

1303
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:46,670
Roisin?

1304
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:27,179
- How's your hand?
- It's better.

1305
01:38:27,281 --> 01:38:30,182
- It's better.
- It's still sore.

1306
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:32,413
Dad...

1307
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:37,681
I know how you feel about...

1308
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:39,851
me wanting to be a journalist

1309
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:42,157
and about Edinburgh University.

1310
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:44,994
I just want you to know that...

1311
01:38:45,099 --> 01:38:46,999
I really want to go.

1312
01:38:48,135 --> 01:38:50,399
And I'm going to go.

1313
01:38:50,504 --> 01:38:52,938
And I'm going to keep
speaking to Casim.

1314
01:38:53,007 --> 01:38:56,499
I can't not speak to him.
He's my brother.

1315
01:38:59,447 --> 01:39:01,677
You've both given me a lot...

1316
01:39:01,749 --> 01:39:04,217
and I'll give you a lot back.

1317
01:39:04,252 --> 01:39:06,345
Thanks, Mom.

1318
01:40:35,309 --> 01:40:37,641
I've been looking for you
everywhere, Roisin.

1319
01:40:37,712 --> 01:40:39,942
I went to a bar.

1320
01:40:40,014 --> 01:40:41,743
Several, actually.

1321
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:46,219
Nearly fucked a complete stranger,
can you believe that?

1322
01:40:48,522 --> 01:40:50,922
Felt a tad lonely, to be honest.

1323
01:40:54,428 --> 01:40:56,555
Have you come
to pick up your stuff?

1324
01:41:00,468 --> 01:41:02,527
That depends.

1325
01:41:03,637 --> 01:41:05,298
What on?

1326
01:41:08,843 --> 01:41:11,073
On whether you'll
grow tired of me.

1327
01:41:13,447 --> 01:41:15,881
Absolutely.

1328
01:41:17,351 --> 01:41:19,319
Will you throw me out
if I get sick?

1329
01:41:19,387 --> 01:41:21,218
Definitely.

1330
01:41:21,288 --> 01:41:24,985
- Watch too much telly?
- Most certainly.

1331
01:41:25,059 --> 01:41:28,620
- Become bankrupt and penniless?
- Without a doubt.

1332
01:41:30,064 --> 01:41:32,259
If I get depressed
and lose my mind?

1333
01:41:32,366 --> 01:41:34,266
I'll send you a card.

1334
01:41:36,003 --> 01:41:38,403
- Better pick up my stuff, then.
- Yeah, you better.

1335
01:41:40,107 --> 01:41:41,699
And what about...

1336
01:41:44,078 --> 01:41:45,841
when I get...

1337
01:41:45,913 --> 01:41:49,474
very, very, very old,
Miss Hanlon?

1338
01:41:51,786 --> 01:41:54,550
I'll let you know.

1339
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:07,801
Crazy durdou.

1340
01:42:09,804 --> 01:42:12,466
Smelly goree.
