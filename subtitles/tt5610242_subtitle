1
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Impossible.. how could you think that..

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,360
..I'll give my consent to this marriage?

3
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,440
But I have already promised
Priyaranjan, father.

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,320
If you have already promised him then..

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,080
..why are you asking for my opinion?

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,200
Now I realise that it was
my mistake to give you education.

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,120
Just remember one thing..
if you marry this guy against..

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,800
..our consent then you'll
have to sever all relations with us.

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,039
Chirasri, you must be knowing..
I have already..

10
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,440
..told you..
that Ratnakar is not only my friend..

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
..he is like a brother to me.

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,560
I wouldn't ever got
married if he was not there.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,960
Don't embarrass me, Priyada.

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,440
You keep quiet..
do you know what all he had done?

15
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,240
He hired a house for us..
paid the advance money..

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,639
..bought necessary things for the house.

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,160
And he has done all
these with his own money.

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
After all you know my capability!

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,520
Okay.. okay..
you better keep an account of every penny.

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,800
I'll take it from your
wife along with interest.

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Please do that.. you should do that..
then I'll feel relieved.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,520
Actually you know what, sister-in-law?

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,639
Sometimes in life one gets
to come closer to someone..

24
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,280
..to whom one feels like giving
everything away and feel happy.

25
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,640
From today onwards I'll call you only Sri.

26
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,800
That will be an exclusive name,
only for me.

27
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,800
From today onwards I'll
also call you only Ranjan.

28
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,360
Even that will be an exclusive name,
only for me.

29
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,960
&quot;This fancy garland doesn't suit me.&quot;

30
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,080
&quot;It hurts while I wear it.&quot;

31
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
&quot;It my conscience doesn't
even let me tear it.&quot;

32
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:48,680
&quot;This fancy garland doesn't suit me.&quot;

33
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:59,760
&quot;My heart wants to gift you something.&quot;

34
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:09,440
&quot;My heart wants to gift you something.&quot;

35
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:19,880
&quot;Even if you don't have the requirement.&quot;

36
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:29,840
&quot;My heart wants to gift you something.&quot;

37
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,960
&quot;Kiss me once, my dear.&quot;

38
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,360
&quot;Kiss me once secretly.&quot;

39
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,120
&quot;Please raise your face
and look at me once, my dear.&quot;

40
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,239
&quot;Please look at me once.&quot;

41
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,239
&quot;Kiss me once, my dear.&quot;

42
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,479
&quot;Kiss me once secretly.&quot;

43
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,280
Eureka!

44
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,760
What happened?

45
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,320
You are Sri.

46
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,120
And I am Ranjan if we
have a son then we'll name him.

47
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,159
Sriranjan.

48
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,960
Are you happy?

49
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,680
I am very happy.

50
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,680
Sriranjan.. hey Sriranjan.

51
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:09,240
&quot;My dear son,
my sweetheart, has fallen asleep.&quot;

52
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:20,880
&quot;My dear son,
my sweetheart, has fallen asleep.&quot;

53
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,920
Hey, listen..
- Yes.

54
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,719
Why don't you ask your
friend to come and stay with us.

55
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,600
Poor thing! He lives alone in a mess.

56
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
No, that won't look good.

57
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,560
Why?

58
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,480
People will say that I
have used my beautiful wife..

59
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
..in order to extract
money from my rich friend.

60
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
We are already very
much indebted to Ratnakar.

61
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
That's true.

62
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,960
Priyada.. Priyada.

63
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,040
Come.. come.

64
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,360
Come in sit down.
we were talking about you only.

65
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
About me?
- Yes.

66
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,480
What were talking about me,
sister-in-law? Take this.

67
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,840
Forget that.. what have you done?
- Why?

68
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,200
Why did you bring such a huge fish?

69
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,240
Who will eat such a big fish?

70
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,520
We all will eat.

71
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,959
We have already made rotis for dinner.

72
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,320
Why didn't you come in the afternoon?

73
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Let it be..
actually you know what, sister-in-law.

74
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,640
I live in a mess..
- Yes.

75
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
My taste buds have
become inactive by eating..

76
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
..the food cooked by the male cook.

77
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,760
So I wanted to eat food cooked
by a woman and repair my taste buds.

78
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Well.. I understand..
listen.. can you hear me?

79
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,680
Look for a nice girl and
get him married immediately.

80
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,360
He is not liking the
food cooked by the male cook..

81
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,520
..any longer..
he now wants a woman to cook for him.

82
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
Did you hear that?

83
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,240
Now you tell me, what kind
of girl do you want as your wife?

84
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,320
What kind.. tell us what kind.

85
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,720
Mean while someone like the one sitting..

86
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,240
..in front of me will do.

87
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
What is he saying?
You could have told me before..

88
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
..I wouldn't have married her then.

89
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,239
What's the point crying over spilt milk?

90
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,080
Better late than never.

91
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,439
Mr. cashier,
you write the cash book sincerely.

92
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,280
I should rather go
in search of the jackpot.

93
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,199
I have already got the jackpot, Gupta.

94
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,880
Have you got it..
tell me then.. let me match with yours.

95
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,959
Why will I tell you?

96
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
What are you saying Roy Chaudhury?
Please tell me.

97
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,120
Working 4 hours overtime
and getting the payment of 8 hours.

98
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,280
The price of my son's
one month's baby food.

99
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,720
Nonsense!

100
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,280
Are you annoyed with me?

101
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,840
After all I am a family man
I have a wife and a son to take care..

102
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,640
..the race ground is not for me.

103
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Rubbish! Money is required..
money.. more money.

104
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,680
Tie a 100 rupee note to a horse's tail.

105
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,160
Then you'll see that it comes
back to you being multiplied.

106
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,160
It much reach even a lakh..
it all depends.

107
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,280
No.. no..
what will I do with so much money?

108
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,240
I am fine.

109
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,240
This is why the Bengalis
can never improve.

110
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Being adult they have a love affair..

111
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,080
..next manage is a clerical job..
next manage is that girl.

112
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
Next manage is a pregnancy..
next hospital..

113
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,520
..and maternity ward..
next baby food.. all rubbish!

114
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
Don't laugh..
be sporting, Ray Chaudhury.. be sporting.

115
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
Tell me how.

116
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,840
Have you ever had tea in an earthen cup?
- Yes.

117
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,640
Always consider your
life as an earthen cup.

118
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,240
You shouldn't use it the second time.

119
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,560
Just use it once and throw away..
understand?

120
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Yes, I understand..
- You haven't understood anything.

121
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,719
Bengali men don't understand,
they don't want to understand.

122
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,280
And they will never understand..
but I understand.

123
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,760
And a day will come when I'll make..

124
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,880
..the whole country understand.

125
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
Listen..
- Yes.

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,640
The laundry soap is exhausted..
get a box of soap.

127
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,640
What? Only few days back
Ratnakar had brought a box of soap.

128
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,840
Few days back?
Ratnakar had come 1 month back.

129
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,560
We wash all our clothes at home..

130
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,719
..isn't soap required for that?

131
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,120
Well.. you are right..
but I am not being able to manage, Sri.

132
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,520
But what do I do, tell me.

133
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,359
Right.. but we are having
such financial constraint.

134
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
It's such a problem.

135
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
What problem?

136
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,240
The problem solver is
at your service. Order me.

137
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,840
No, just family talks..
now since you have come..

138
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,599
..you sit for sometime..
talk to your sister-in-law.

139
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,760
I have to go for shopping.

140
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
Okay.. I'll wait for you.

141
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,520
What's the matter, sister-in-law..

142
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,840
..your face is looking gloomy

143
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,520
Not at all.. actually.

144
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,480
I was telling your Priyada
to take a leave from the office..

145
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,920
..so that we can go
somewhere for a holiday.

146
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
But he said that he
can't take a leave now.

147
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,240
Grand idea!
Let's go for a trip to Digha.. okay?

148
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,080
But..
- No ifs and buts.

149
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
It's my responsibility to manage Priyada.

150
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,080
You just give your consent.. yes.. yes.

151
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,040
&quot;O beautiful,
whose words have made you gloomy?&quot;

152
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,680
&quot;O beautiful,
whose words have made you gloomy?&quot;

153
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,760
&quot;You are the best of pulses,
you are the best of rice.&quot;

154
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,880
&quot;You are the best of pulses,
you are the best of rice.&quot;

155
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,440
&quot;You are the best vegetable
preparation I know that always.&quot;

156
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,520
&quot;O beautiful,
whose words have made you gloomy?&quot;

157
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,120
&quot;O beautiful,
whose words have made you gloomy?&quot;

158
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,480
&quot;You are my Albert fashion, you are my..

159
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,680
..shoulder length hair-cut.&quot;

160
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,800
&quot;You are my gold buttons
and you are the rose in my button.&quot;

161
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
&quot;You are my Albert fashion, you are my..

162
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,680
..shoulder length hair-cut.&quot;

163
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,720
&quot;You are my gold buttons
and you are the rose in my button.&quot;

164
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,240
&quot;You are my beetle leaves and cigarette.&quot;

165
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,680
&quot;You are my motor car.&quot;

166
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,360
&quot;How do I explain who are you to me?&quot;

167
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,719
&quot;You are my rose-perfume, soap and cream.&quot;

168
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,040
&quot;You travel in a horse driven cart.&quot;

169
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,040
&quot;O beautiful,
whose words have made you gloomy?&quot;

170
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,520
&quot;O beautiful,
whose words have made you gloomy?&quot;

171
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,560
Grand! Grand! You have sang very well!

172
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,240
What's the next item?

173
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,319
Let's all of us go
for a run on the sea beach.

174
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,560
No.. no.. I can't run around at this age.

175
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,640
You better do one thing.. you
take your sister-in-law along with you.

176
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,360
She has got loads of energy.

177
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,360
I'll rather be the referee.

178
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,520
A referee always has
to be impartial, get it?

179
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you have any doubt
that I'll be impartial or not.

180
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,320
No point fighting..
you give a start.. we are ready.

181
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Is that so?

182
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,400
We enjoyed a lot in these few days..
isn't it, sister-in-law?

183
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,240
Is that so?

184
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,400
Sister-in-law, what's your hobby?

185
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,200
Bringing up our son
and loving your Priyada.

186
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,000
How can you call this hobby?

187
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,560
It's all about your desires and feelings.

188
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,800
I don't understand any hobby..
that is everything for me.

189
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,720
You are very lucky, Priyada.

190
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,120
Hey, listen..
come closer.. let me take the measurement.

191
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,440
Your luck also doesn't
seem to be bad at all.

192
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,919
You all sit here.. I am feeling sleepy.

193
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,920
Did Priyada go away being angry with me?

194
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,000
Why will he be angry with you?

195
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,520
He felt sleepy so he went to bed.

196
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,800
Ratnakar.

197
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,080
The 3 plants seems to survive at last.

198
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,040
Yes.. I can see that.

199
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,280
But let's see which
one bears flowers first.

200
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,920
I hope your husband won't get angry.

201
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,639
Are you joking with me?

202
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,399
Sister-in-law, can we do one thing?

203
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Can we name the plants?

204
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,199
What are those?

205
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,639
That corner one should
be named Priyashakha.

206
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,200
The middle one should be named Srilata.

207
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,240
And the one in this side is me..
Ratnakar plant.

208
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,400
What happened?

209
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,640
It seems that you have something to say.

210
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,320
No.. nothing much..
sometime back you were saying..

211
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,200
..let's see which plant
bears flowers first.

212
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,760
You mischievous boy!

213
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Wait.. I'll ask your
Priyada to beat you up.

214
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,800
I am afraid..
I am late, sister-in-law.. I am going.

215
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't forget about the evening.

216
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,360
I won't forget.

217
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,760
It's 9o' clock now..
I am getting late for the office.

218
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,720
Will you serve me lunch or not?

219
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,600
When will you come back.

220
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Let me see.

221
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
What 'let me see'?

222
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,880
Don't you remember what date it is today?

223
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,120
Oh yes.. okay.. I'll come back early.

224
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Today we'll have dinner outside.

225
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Then we'll come back
home after watching a film.

226
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,040
Very good.

227
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
I have asked Ratnakar to come as well.

228
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,680
We'll take him along with us.

229
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,920
I knew that.

230
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,879
What's the matter?
Aren't you liking Ratnakar these days?

231
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,440
No.. nothing like that..
why do you think so?

232
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,520
Actually a third person's
presence is not acceptable..

233
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,720
..in a marriage anniversary.

234
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,400
&quot;I love you, I love you.&quot;

235
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:52,320
&quot;This music is played by
the flute in the water and earth.&quot;

236
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,400
&quot;I love you, I love you.&quot;

237
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,639
Come in.. it's open.

238
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,159
&quot;Someone's heart aches in the sky.&quot;

239
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,879
&quot;Someone's eyes are filled
with tears in the horizon.&quot;

240
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,000
&quot;Tears roll down from the eyes.&quot;

241
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,920
&quot;I love you, I love you.&quot;

242
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,360
Many many happy returns of the day!
I wish your and..

243
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,360
..Priyada's married
life to bloom for ever.

244
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,280
Oh it's you.. I thought.

245
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,040
Priyada..
- Yes.

246
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,880
This is for you.

247
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
What beautiful flowers!

248
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,240
What are you looking at?

249
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,400
No.. nothing.. what's the
programme for today, sister-in-law?

250
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,960
First of all going to Park
street and eating Chinese food.

251
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,879
Very good.

252
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,160
Then watching a 9 p.m. show of a movie.

253
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,880
Even better.

254
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,920
Then.

255
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Coming back late night
and sleeping with Priyada.

256
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,440
I'll beat you now.. sit down.

257
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,600
You are coming back from the office.
- Yes.

258
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,440
What will you have? Tea or coffee?

259
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,440
Please give me tea
in your beautiful hands.

260
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,640
You are again joking with me.

261
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh great! Sweets! Delicious!

262
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,880
I hope you have made a good amount.

263
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,920
You eat as mush as you can.

264
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,159
Give me one more spoon full.

265
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,400
Enough keep for yourselves too.

266
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,240
You don't have to think
about that.. you eat.

267
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,040
That's not fair..
it'd your marriage anniversary.

268
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,719
And I can't eat up all the sweets.

269
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
By the way.. I had absolutely forgotten.

270
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,639
I have brought this gift for you.

271
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,719
How did you know?
Perfume is my favourite cosmetics.

272
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,240
That's a coincidence.. actually

273
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,840
I have designed the bottle. That's why.

274
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,880
Is that so?
You have designed it beautifully.

275
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,040
Do you remember you
were asking me in Digha..

276
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,400
..about my hobby..
that day I didn't tell you.

277
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,320
Actually while studying B.Sc.

278
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,040
I used to make cosmetics
at home and had become very famous..

279
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,200
..among my friends.

280
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,160
Really?

281
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,760
Yes.. I was very good
student in Chemistry.

282
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,480
I used to make new formulas on my own.

283
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,840
Really?

284
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,040
I was so childish then!

285
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
I used to buy those small
glass bottles put material in them..

286
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,360
..then I used to cut papers..
type on them and put label..

287
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,080
..on those bottles.. Chirasri cream.

288
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,280
Crirasri scent.. Chirasri snow.

289
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,959
Is there anybody home? Can you hear me?

290
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,440
Who is there at home?

291
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,840
Whom do you want?

292
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,960
Is this Priyaranjan's house?
- Yes.

293
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,919
He has given this letter to you.

294
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,639
Letter? Where is he?

295
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,280
Don't be panicked he is stuck
in the office for some important work.

296
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,000
I work under him.

297
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,760
He asked me to deliver this letter to you.

298
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,360
I'll have to go now.
- Greetings.

299
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,479
'Sri, I got stuck in the office
on account of some important work.'

300
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,439
I don't know when can I come back home.'

301
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,480
'You both should rather have dinner.. '

302
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,840
What happened, sister-in-law?

303
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Even today Priyada.

304
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,320
Okay you stay at home.
I'll go and make a phone call to Priyada.

305
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,080
No.

306
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,920
Okay then.. let's have a good chat.

307
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Why only chatting?
You have to have dinner over here.

308
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,800
I am going to cook rice.

309
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,960
There is nothing much at home.

310
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,200
Just omelette and mutton.. will that do?

311
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,680
Sister-in-law, forget about dinner today.

312
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,520
Ratnakar,
do you want to make me more ashamed?

313
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,120
You can't go from here
without having dinner.

314
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,400
Yes, the gentleman is very handsome.

315
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,320
That man and your
wife were laughing a lot.

316
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,520
Priyada, is that man your wife's friend?

317
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
No, he is my brother.

318
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,080
&quot;Big faced greedy man.
His house is at Bengal.&quot;

319
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,160
&quot;Did you see that he never smiles?&quot;

320
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,960
&quot;Doesn't it have any meaning?&quot;

321
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,879
&quot;Does anybody know that?&quot;

322
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,439
&quot;Has anyone of you stayed with him ever?&quot;

323
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,159
Are you going out?

324
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,080
Yes.

325
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
Won't you have lunch?

326
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
No, I have an appointment on the way.

327
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Couldn't you say that before?

328
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,600
Wait?

329
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
What has happened to you?

330
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,680
Why are you behaving
with me in this manner?

331
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,879
What have I done?

332
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Do I have to say what have you done?

333
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Of course.. if you don't
say it to me then who else will say?

334
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,520
Will the neighbour's husband say it to me?

335
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,000
Leave me.. let me go.

336
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,560
Tell me clearly.. what do you want to say?

337
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,280
I don't want to say anything.

338
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,040
But I can't stop other people from saying.

339
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,240
Forget about other people..
you talk about your opinion.

340
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,399
Neighbours are saying
filthy things about you.

341
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
Don't you know that?

342
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,480
Filthy things? What filthy things?

343
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,600
People are saying filthy
things about you and Ratnakar.

344
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,640
What a shame! How can you say this to me?

345
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,200
Ratnakar is like your brother..
he is my friend.

346
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,000
I am affectionate about him..
besides do you want to..

347
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,720
..believe and act according
to what the other people are saying?

348
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,000
Don't you have any feelings of your own?

349
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,360
No, I don't have..
I don't have a clean mind like you.

350
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,000
Hey, do you distrust me?

351
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,840
Let me go.

352
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
No, you tell me clearly..
do you distrust me?

353
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,120
Stop nagging.

354
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
What were we talking about?

355
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,320
&quot;Big faced greedy man.
His house is at Bengal.&quot;

356
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,920
'Hey, listen.. why don't you
ask your friend to come and stay with us.

357
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,640
Poor thing! He lives alone in a mess.. '

358
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,320
'Sometimes in life one
gets to come closer to someone..

359
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,280
..to whom one feels like giving
everything away and feel happy.. '

360
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,919
Can you tell me sister-in-law,
how many stars are there in the sky?

361
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,080
No..
- I can say.

362
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,399
Is that so?
- Yes.

363
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,480
You can do many things, right?

364
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,840
Yes, I can.

365
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,560
Can you find me a job?

366
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,639
You'll do a job!?

367
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,560
Why? Can't I?

368
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,120
What's the matter, sister-in-law?
Why do you suddenly want to do a job?

369
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,240
Did you have a fight with Priyada?

370
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,120
We need money..
after all we have to bring up..

371
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,240
..our son in a nice manner.

372
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,760
You can't make me believe by saying that.

373
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,160
What happened? Tell me clearly.

374
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,720
Let's not talk about that.

375
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,520
Sister-in-law, once you had told me that..

376
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,520
..you consider me nothing
other than a friend if that is true..

377
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,760
..then can't you tell me?

378
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,520
He doesn't trust me.

379
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,760
Sister-in-law!

380
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,480
Ratnakar.

381
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,320
I have left my parents and my family
because I love him I have become the

382
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,440
..mother of his child
just because I love him..

383
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,280
..I have done away with status and
luxurious life just because I love him.

384
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,240
And today he doesn't trust me.

385
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,200
Because of whom does he distrust you? Me?

386
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,760
How can Priyada become so mean?

387
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,400
Sister-in-law.

388
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,040
I don't want to come in between you two.

389
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,960
I will never come to this house again.

390
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,800
No, you have to come.. otherwise
his allegations will be proven true.

391
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,000
Tomorrow morning I
am going out of Kolkata..

392
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,560
..for 5 days for some official work.

393
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,280
I'll meet you after I come back.

394
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,639
Sri, open the door.

395
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,320
Sri.

396
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,120
Had you fallen asleep?

397
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,000
No, I was on the terrace.

398
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,800
it has become late night today,
sister-in-law.. I am going.

399
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,360
So you still have the intelligence..

400
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,680
..to understand that it's late night.

401
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,800
What a shame!

402
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
How could you behave
with Ratnakar in that manner?

403
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,560
I behaved exactly the in
manner that I should behave..

404
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,359
..with a debauchee and a pervert.

405
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
Ranjan, what are you saying?!

406
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,040
Ratnakar is your brother he is my friend.

407
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,040
Not any more..
he has spread his hands too far.

408
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,239
If he wants to spread
his dirty hands even further..

409
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,040
..then I'll break it.

410
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,960
Ratnakar will never enter this house.

411
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,120
Even if he enters then
I'll drive him out of this house.

412
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,960
No, you can't do that..
Ratnakar is my friend..

413
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,320
..and he will always remain my friend.

414
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,400
I am not going to pay for your mistakes.

415
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,480
Is this your last word?
- Yes!

416
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,120
Then you also listen to my last word.

417
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,520
From today onwards don't
call yourself my wife.

418
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,439
What are you doing!?

419
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,760
I am expiating my mistakes..
I don't want that a filthy woman..

420
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,440
..to live as my wife.

421
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,759
Once I had applied
vermillion on your forehead.

422
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,440
Today I am expiating my mistake..

423
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,080
..by wiping that vermillion
with my own hands.

424
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,760
Wait.. I have something more to say.

425
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,400
Today you have insulted the vermillion..

426
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,560
..one day you'll have
to repent for your deed.

427
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,480
You'll again apply this same vermillion
on my forehead with your own hand.

428
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,480
I am accepting the
punishment given by you.

429
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,960
Hello.. who?
Priyaran.. oh yes.. Ray Chaudhury.

430
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,120
It's for you.

431
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,160
Yes.
- Hello.. who? Ranjan.

432
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,920
Sri here.. hello.

433
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,320
Hello.. hello.

434
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,040
Who was that?

435
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,000
No one.

436
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,360
What do you mean by no one?

437
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,520
I myself heard the voice of
a woman have you fought with your wife?

438
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,759
You are responsible for it.

439
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,640
I am responsible?

440
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,320
I am saying that you
are responsible for it.

441
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:10,320
If a wife has an affair
with some other man..

442
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
..then am I responsible for it?

443
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,480
Of course you are responsible.

444
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,319
Look Ray Chaudhury..
always remember one thing.

445
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,400
Car and woman..
these two things should always be kept..

446
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,400
..under control..
otherwise accidents are sure to happen.

447
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,440
One can control a car..
but what about woman?

448
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,000
You have to use the brake..
suppose you are stinking..

449
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,840
..of liquor..
having lots of money in your pocket..

450
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,160
..a race manual..
a long hair stuck over here.

451
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,560
Lipstick mark over here..
then your wife will become alert.

452
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,360
This is called brake..
I mean you have to counter attack.

453
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,320
No, Guptada..
I have passed all those stages.

454
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,759
I don't even stay at home now.

455
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,600
My boy, as long as your Guptada is here..

456
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,560
..don't get frustrated..
it's my bounden duty.. moral duty..

457
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,560
..to look after you..
from today onwards you'll live in my flat.

458
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Okay?

459
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,440
I am sorry, sister-in-law.

460
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,160
I had to go out of the city
due to office work during this period.

461
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,200
Sister-in-law.

462
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,720
Tell me.

463
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,479
Did you call him in his office?

464
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,400
He had cut the phone hearing my voice.

465
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,840
What will you do now?

466
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,319
Will you go back to your father?

467
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,800
I had married him
against my family's will.

468
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
After all it was a love marriage!

469
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,280
Sister-in-law, I won't try
to give you any false consolation.

470
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,120
I know that you are a strong woman.

471
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,120
Now you tell me what do you want to do?

472
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,640
You suggest me.

473
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,400
There are two ways in front of you.

474
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,720
One is to bring back
Priyada at any cost and..

475
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,560
..the other way is to fight.

476
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,240
There is no point to bring
him back after all these, Ratnakar.

477
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,120
That will be the greatest
insult of womanhood.

478
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,320
That's true.

479
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,720
Isn't it?

480
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,440
Can I come in?

481
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,040
Come in.

482
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Greetings!

483
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,160
Greetings! Please sit down.

484
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,279
Tell me what can I do for you?

485
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,560
My name is Chirasri Ray Chaudhury.

486
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,160
I..
- Yes.. tell me.

487
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,160
I have tried a lot for
a job but didn't get any.

488
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
I want to do something on my own.

489
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,040
I minute.. hello..
oh Mr. Bhatia.. tell me.. yes.. yes.

490
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,520
No.. no..
Mr. Bhatia, you must be knowing..

491
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,279
..what is the gimmick..
yes, 3 lakhs.. but we have..

492
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,960
..given you 3 lakhs 6 thousands..

493
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,200
..yes.. special case..
what? No.. no.. I am sorry.

494
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,600
I don't have the authority to do that.

495
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,720
The bank also has to abide
by certain rules.. yes.. listen.

496
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,400
You can submit the
cheque and get the cash.

497
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,400
There won't be any
problem in that case.. yes.

498
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,320
I am really sorry, Mr. Bhatia.. greetings.

499
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,240
You have fought with your husband, right?

500
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,840
He is not there.

501
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,040
Oh I am sorry.

502
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,400
The vermillion on your forehead..
-I didn't get the time to wipe it.

503
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,840
For the one who has passed away..

504
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,720
..it doesn't matter whether
the vermillion is wiped off or not.

505
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,840
But to bring up my child..

506
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,280
..survive with respect
and honour comes first.

507
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,640
How far have you studied?

508
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,160
I have passed B.Sc.
with honours in Chemistry.

509
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,200
Good.. now you tell me,
how can I help you.

510
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,640
You give loans for business, right?

511
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,200
Yes, we give.

512
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,360
I want to do a business..
can you arrange me a loan?

513
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,640
What business do you want to do?

514
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
Cosmetics.

515
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,640
Cheers!

516
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,480
Hey, listen.. 3 large..
2 for me and 1 for him.. go get it.

517
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,480
Hurry up.

518
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,640
This.

519
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,440
Mrs. Ray Chaudhury,
can you spend some money?

520
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,360
No.

521
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,920
A little amount of money.

522
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,360
I said no.

523
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,680
Listen.. sit down.

524
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,480
I can understand what..

525
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,960
..you have thought
or what you are thinking.

526
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,160
But that's not right.

527
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,680
Select a name for the company..

528
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,480
..then spend a little amount
of money and get a trade license..

529
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,360
..and get some letter heads
made in the name of the company.

530
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,200
Then let's see what I can do.

531
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,120
Please forgive me.. I didn't understand.

532
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,200
Have you thought anything
about the name of the company?

533
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,960
Well.. yes.. Chirasri Cosmetics.

534
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
Chirasri Cosmetics?

535
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,560
What about Srimati Cosmetics?

536
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,319
Srimati Cosmetics?

537
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,680
Yes.

538
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,800
Okay.

539
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,200
I am very happy.

540
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,640
Thank you..
- Welcome.

541
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,400
How long have you been waiting?

542
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,240
For sometime.

543
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,280
Please sit down.

544
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,680
Have you done all that
I had asked you to do?

545
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,640
Yes.. these are the papers.

546
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,200
I can see that you have
already sold your bangles.

547
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,920
Now if the bank doesn't
accept your proposal, then what?

548
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,440
I haven't thought of anything.

549
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:49,240
The bank can't sanction you a
loan on the proposal that you have given..

550
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,240
..but as a bank manager..

551
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,440
..I have the power..

552
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,520
..to give you 10,000 rupees..

553
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,240
..of cash credit facility..
open an account in the..

554
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,320
..name of your company with 500 rupees.

555
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,839
Get the money from the cash and send Mr.
Sen in my chamber.

556
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,240
If required you can withdraw
up to 10,000 rupees from this account.

557
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,000
Start a business in a small scale.

558
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Then when transactions of money will
happen then you can pay back the bank.

559
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,320
Mr. Sen, this lady will
open a cash credit account..

560
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,280
..in the name of her company..
tell her clearly..

561
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,520
..about all the formalities.

562
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,040
Please come with me.

563
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,279
Listen.. please meet me
after your work will be done.

564
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,320
Okay.

565
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,560
Sign your full name over here.

566
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,360
Thank you.

567
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,440
Is your work done?
- Yes, sir.

568
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Count the money.

569
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,320
There is 2000 rupees.

570
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:57,120
I am giving you the money
from my personal account.

571
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,760
You can give it back to
me when your account will be open.

572
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,120
Open a bank account with
500 rupees and with the rest..

573
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,640
..meet your initial expenses..
start working from tomorrow.

574
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,319
God be with you.. one more thing.

575
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,720
When I had asked you to keep the
name of your company Srimati Cosmetics..

576
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,720
..then you didn't ask me why.

577
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:39,640
I had a small daughter named Srimati.

578
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,720
If she was alive then she
would be of the same age like you.

579
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,839
Strange man!

580
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,720
Not only strange..
Mr. Tarafdar is like a god.

581
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,600
I felt like showing my respect
to him by touching his feet.

582
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,240
Listen.. I have lots to
talk about business with you.

583
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,760
You can't go early.

584
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,840
As you command.

585
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,880
Nail polish,
lac-dye, saffron and vermillion.

586
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,920
I am thinking of starting
with these 4 items.. what do you say?

587
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,920
Very good.

588
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,240
You have to do the get up design,
I am telling you.

589
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,640
Don't think about that, sister-in-law..

590
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,120
..I'll make such a design..

591
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,439
..that people will eagerly
buy your product just seeing the label.

592
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,040
Sure?
- Okay.

593
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,799
Priya..
- Yes.

594
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,760
Are you going to the
bank to deposit money?

595
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,880
Yes, Guptada.. today is Saturday
the bank will close at 12o' clock.

596
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,560
Very good.

597
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,760
What will you do after office?

598
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,680
Nothing.. I am depending on you.

599
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,440
Don't think about that.

600
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,840
Till the time your Guptada is alive.

601
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,160
You are his responsibility but
you have to do things according to me.

602
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,760
What's that?

603
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,120
No.. no.. what rubbish are you talking?

604
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,320
Look, the money is going to ..

605
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,319
..come into the bank.

606
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,560
If we can make a quick
buck in the process..

607
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,440
..what's the harm in it?

608
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,200
No.. what if someone finds out?

609
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,560
Don't talk rubbish!

610
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,320
Today is Saturday..
today you'll take the money.

611
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,360
Sunday is closed..
you can deposit the money..

612
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,200
..on Monday during the first hours.

613
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,960
And if the management
come to know that the money..

614
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,040
..was not submitted on Saturday..
then what?

615
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,479
You can make a phone call
to the office from outside..

616
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,759
..that you were going to
deposit the money in the bank..

617
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,960
..suddenly you met a neighbour
of yours on the way..

618
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,279
..and he told you that
your wife has met an accident..

619
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,960
..so you couldn't deposit the money..
it's a simple matter.

620
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,279
No.. Guptada.. I am not confident
about it.. I can't do this.

621
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,759
Never mind.. I'll manage somehow.

622
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,920
I can't just let go such a sure tip..
I'll see you in the evening..

623
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,720
..in my flat.. bye.

624
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,960
Please drive faster.

625
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,040
What happened?

626
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:23,000
I am in trouble..
come.. come on.. get in the taxi quickly.

627
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,520
I'll tell you everything in the taxi..
driver, quick.

628
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,520
Why did you stop me..
the bank will get closed.

629
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
I want the bank to get closed.

630
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,040
Listen.. please drop me in the bank..
there is no time.

631
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,479
I have to deposit the money.

632
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,640
Don't act like a crazy man, Priyaranjan.

633
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,920
Chances don't come in life always..

634
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,280
..this is a sure tip.

635
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,560
Priyada.. hey Priyada.

636
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,960
Sister-in-law.. you?

637
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,319
You are the one who
work in his office, right?

638
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,920
Yes.. but I came to know
that you have met an accident.

639
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,720
Accident? I have met an accident?

640
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,720
No.. I mean.,

641
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,200
What's the matter?

642
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,680
Did you Priyada send you to spy on me?

643
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,800
Believe me sister-in-law,
I don't know anything about it.

644
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,160
If you don't know then know it now..
come inside.

645
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,279
See how I am.. what am I doing..
after all you'll have to report..

646
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,520
..your Priyada while
you go back.. come in.

647
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,160
Pour some more water.

648
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,200
Enough.

649
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,880
Look, your product is new..
people doesn't know about it yet.

650
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,120
We won't have any profit
if we keep this kind of products.

651
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,480
It's right that these are new products.

652
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,400
But they are of very good quality.

653
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,880
Might be.. but how will
I understand before using them?

654
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,280
No.. I mean.. if you can kindly push them.

655
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,080
How much commission are you giving?
- 25 %.

656
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,640
Look, your product is new..

657
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,280
..if you give 25% commission
then what will be our interest?

658
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,640
If you can make it 35% then give me some..

659
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,480
..you can check the stock
every week and get your payment.

660
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,040
Why? Don't you make cash payments?

661
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,560
We do.. but that's
for the running products.

662
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,040
Tell me what all do you want.

663
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,640
Saffron 1 dozen,
lac-dye 1 dozen, nail polish 2 dozens..

664
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,640
..and vermillion 2 dozens.

665
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,680
I told you, we don't sell such things.

666
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,640
Try selling it once.

667
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,680
Spare me, madam.

668
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,960
Such ethnic stuff don't sell.

669
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,160
Impossible, sister-in-law..
it won't happen like this.

670
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,760
And it doesn't happen like this..
I have told you earlier..

671
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,160
..that you can't sell your
products in the market this way.

672
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,359
For that you need to do
advertisements and campaigns.

673
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,960
You won't even touch my money..
that will hurt your ego.

674
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,279
Why are you saying like that?

675
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,680
Listen.. think well about what I say.

676
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,840
It won't happen like this, okay?
I'll talk to my office.

677
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,640
If I can release the publicity
by them then I'll get..

678
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,280
..a credit facility of 3 months..
and I'll do the campaign.

679
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,760
And yes.. in the mean time you talk to Mr.
Tarafdar of your bank..

680
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,320
..and try to solve the problem.

681
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,560
I'll go tomorrow..
now please have some tea.

682
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,240
No, I don't want to have tea now.

683
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,560
What happened suddenly?
You are not liking tea.

684
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,160
Today I am not in the right mood,
sister-in-law.

685
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,160
Why? What happened?

686
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,600
What happened, Ratnakar?

687
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,520
What happened?

688
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,440
Sister-in-law.

689
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,080
Sister-in-law.

690
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,600
Priyada has been sentenced to jail.

691
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,680
Who gave you the news?

692
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,440
A guy from his office.

693
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,920
Priyada has stolen 10,000
rupees cash from the office.

694
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,040
..next day police came and arrested him.

695
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,360
A chapter of my life has ended today.

696
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,520
Sister-in-law.

697
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,160
Ratnakar, what will I tell my
son about his father, can you tell me?

698
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,080
Sister-in-law.

699
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,919
Instead of living like a thief's son,
let him know that his father is dead.

700
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,360
His mother is a widow.

701
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,720
Is Mr. Tarafdar at home?

702
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,400
You are Chirasri, right?

703
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,319
Yes.. you must be aunty.

704
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,560
Let it be.. come inside.. come.

705
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,640
See who has come.

706
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,120
Oh it's you!
Come.. come.. please sit down.

707
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,680
Did you recognise who she is?

708
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,400
How is it possible that
I won't recognise my daughter?

709
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,680
Where were you hiding all these days,
daughter?

710
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,320
You have started again..
she is getting afraid.

711
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,920
You sit here.. I'll be back in a while.

712
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,240
Uncle.
- Yes.

713
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,120
I hope you won't mind if I call you uncle.

714
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:31,560
Why will I mind?
Actually I liked it very much.

715
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,240
No.. I mean.

716
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,080
Don't hesitate.. tell me..
after all you haven't come to meet..

717
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,240
..a bank manager now..
you have come to meet your uncle.

718
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,760
Why should a daughter hesitate
in front of her father?

719
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,680
No.. I mean.. uncle.. my business is not.

720
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,960
Running smoothly, right?
You need some more money.

721
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,920
Well.. yes.

722
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,160
You have to do more publicity.

723
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,080
Yes.

724
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,399
And more over there is a
tough competition in the market.

725
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,280
Yes.

726
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,399
Silly girl! Do you think that
I haven't thought about all these?

727
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,120
The day I have granted
you the loan that day only..

728
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:15,120
..I had planned everything..
look I have my full trust on you.

729
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,160
That's why I had arranged for
your loan though I had a limited power.

730
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:29,920
Besides I have placed you
in the place of my dead daughter.

731
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,240
Now it's my duty to
think about youmy girl.

732
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,720
Listen.. before going,
take a letter from me.

733
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,920
I have spoken to one of my big clients.

734
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,560
They are a big distributors of cosmetics.

735
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,839
They'll take all your product..
there will be..

736
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,120
..an agency agreement..
then you can collect the bill from them..

737
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,200
..and withdraw the money from our bank.

738
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,920
All problem will be solved.

739
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,320
No.. no.. don't cry.. wipe your tears.

740
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,799
You had told me once
that you'll fight.. listen..

741
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,440
..you are my daughter.. you have to win.

742
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,399
I want your blessings, uncle.

743
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,840
You can take his blessings later..
now sit in front of me..

744
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,000
..and eat these sweets.

745
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,360
This is not right, aunty..
you are saying that I am your daughter..

746
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,640
..just for the sake off saying..
have you ever heard..

747
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,000
..that mother will bring
food for the daughter..

748
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,640
..and the daughter will eat them up?

749
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,040
You are my daughter
whom I had lost long back.

750
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,600
Uncle, won't you say anything?

751
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,160
No, I won't say anything..
after all it's between..

752
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,160
..mother and daughter.

753
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:09,160
Oh, I have absolutely forgotten..
I has brought some sample..

754
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,439
..of my company's product for you..
I forget to give them.

755
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,759
Wonderful!
What beautiful packing! Take a look.

756
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,280
I am giving this lac-dye
and this vermillion to my wife.

757
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,440
They are very nice..
I'll definitely use them myself.

758
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,840
But I can't give this nail
polish and saffron to my wife.

759
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,800
These two are for my daughter.

760
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,520
Take them.

761
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,040
Take them.

762
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,600
Listen, you have to get rid
of this white outfit of yours..

763
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:58,360
..you'll put a saffron dot on
your forehead and apply nail polish..

764
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:04,640
..on your nails.. you'll deck
up nicely and come to our house.

765
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,399
Then you'll see that you
will look beautiful like a goddess.

766
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,480
I have absolutely forgot to say something.

767
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,120
Listen, tomorrow I
am not going to the bank.

768
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,439
Tomorrow I am taking a leave.

769
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,080
Tomorrow your aunty
is doing 'Sabitri Broto'.

770
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,040
Tomorrow afternoon
you'll come to our place..

771
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,200
..and have lunch along with us,
do you understand?

772
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:40,640
&quot;One day he'll recognise you.&quot;

773
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:46,360
&quot;He'll recognise you, amidst
hundreds of other things beautiful.&quot;

774
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:53,400
&quot;One day he'll recognise you.&quot;

775
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:59,080
&quot;He'll recognise you, amidst
hundreds of other things beautiful.&quot;

776
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,880
Malati.

777
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,400
Feed baby milk around 4
o'clock and you have your food.

778
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,880
I'll be late.

779
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,080
What happened?

780
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,440
Mr.. Mr. Tarafdar.

781
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,520
What? What has happened to him?

782
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,040
He is no more!

783
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,240
Today there is 'Sabitri Broto' at home.

784
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,879
So he had gone to the market himself.

785
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,160
While coming back
from the market he felt..

786
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,160
..an acute pain in his chest..
then the boys of the locality..

787
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,080
..brought him home..
the doctor had also come.

788
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,360
Everything ended before that.

789
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:41,640
Your uncle cheated me and went away, girl.

790
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,360
'Listen, you have to get
rid of this white outfit of yours..

791
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,240
..you'll put a saffron dot on
your forehead and apply nail polish..

792
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,000
..on your nails.. you'll deck
up nicely and come to our house.

793
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,600
Then you'll se that you will
look beautiful like a goddess.. '

794
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,759
Uncle, look at me

795
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,840
Look how I have decked up as you had said.

796
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,080
Please have a look..
I am looking so beautiful as a goddess.

797
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,120
Uncle.

798
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,040
Look at me.

799
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,439
Everything has ended for me.

800
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:23,160
That god like man was burnt
into ashes in front of my eyes.

801
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,240
Sister-in-law.

802
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,800
I didn't know how it feels
when someone's father dies.

803
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,760
Sister-in-law.. please calm down..
please break down like this.

804
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,640
There is loads of work ahead..
you have to become stronger.

805
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,279
I can't bear it any more.

806
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,240
You have to bear it, sister-in-law..
you have to.

807
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,920
You have to change this house..
the factory has been sanctioned.

808
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,479
You have to focus on that too.

809
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,200
I know that if I have to
live then I have to do all those.

810
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,320
But my world has become empty, brother.

811
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,160
Whom ever I have loved
and wanted to go closer..

812
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,679
..will go away from me.

813
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,599
Madam, your and your husband's
photograph was lying..

814
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,280
..on the ground on that room.

815
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,440
Shall I keep it in that room?

816
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,000
No! who gas asked you
to act smart always.. get lost.

817
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,680
Get out from my sight.

818
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,200
I'll wipe out everything..
I'll finish everything..

819
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,400
..it's because of him
that I am in such a state.

820
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,000
What are you doing, sister-in-law?

821
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,120
Leave me.. leave me, I say.

822
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,080
No.. no.. your fingers are bleeding..
can't you see?

823
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,000
You just saw my fingers bleeding..
but you couldn't..

824
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,880
..see how much I bled inside my heart..

825
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,920
..all that blood has been
clotted inside my heart, Ratnakar.

826
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,800
Sister-in-law.. sister-in-law,
listen to me.. sister-in-law.

827
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,080
Sri.

828
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,800
Whom do you want?

829
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,400
Does any body called Chirasri stay here?

830
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,160
Chirasri? No body of
this name stays in this house.

831
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,480
A small boy named Chiranjan.. her son.

832
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,680
We had shifted to
this house 3 months back.

833
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,880
If somebody of tat name used
to stay before in this house..

834
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,400
..then I can't say about her.

835
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,400
Please don't mind..
I think I have disturbed you.

836
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,559
No.. it's okay.

837
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,200
Look uncle, that's a ship.

838
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,280
Do you want to board that ship..
- Yes.

839
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,840
Where will you go by that ship?

840
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,480
America.
- America!?

841
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,400
Why will you go to America?

842
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,600
I'll go there to study.

843
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,680
Very good.. wait.. I'll take
few good photographs of yours.. okay?

844
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,160
Smile.. smile please.

845
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,480
Mother.. o mother.

846
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,880
Let me see your face first.

847
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,280
How are you, mother?
I haven't seen you since long.

848
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,680
Are you angry with me because
I couldn't go to the airport?

849
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,519
Initially I was really angry..
then I was really worried..

850
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,360
..about your health.

851
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,480
I am fine..
you are coming from America after so long.

852
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,640
I had very much wished
to go to the airport.

853
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,080
But what do I do?

854
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,799
The arrival of your plane
was in such an odd time that..

855
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,960
..if I had gone to the airport
then I couldn't have cooked for you, son.

856
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,880
Grand, mother.. grand!

857
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,680
I haven't eaten food
cooked by you since ages.

858
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,040
Mother, have you made Hilsha fish fry?

859
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,280
What happened, uncle.. please eat.

860
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,040
You carry on.
- I'll in any case eat.

861
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,280
I'll eat to my heart's content today.

862
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,120
You are eating in such a
manner that it seems that you have..

863
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,360
..come from some famine struck country.

864
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,880
Whatever you say, uncle..
as you won't find any other country..

865
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,120
..as beautiful as ours..
similarly you won't find such..

866
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,480
..delicious food cooked
by mother anywhere else.

867
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,480
You eat.

868
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,920
You were in America for so long.. enough..

869
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,280
..but you have remained a pure Bengali.

870
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,559
Of course I am..
after all I am my mother's son.

871
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,480
You are praising your mother so much..

872
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,720
..now will you promise me something?

873
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,160
Order me, mother.

874
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,080
Bring a daughter-in-law for me.

875
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,800
Okay.. I'll bring.

876
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,320
I bless you that may
you be very happy in life.

877
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,480
And please show your respect
to your father-in-law in your mind.

878
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,840
He was a real great man.

879
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,640
'Priyada has stolen 10,000
rupees cash from the office..

880
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,240
..next day police
came and arrested him.. '

881
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:29,240
Good morning, madam..
good morning, madam.. greetings.

882
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:58,920
Connect me to Ramen.. Ramen,
have you seen the bills of last month?

883
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,160
Yes yes, but you are the..

884
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:08,160
..publicity officer..
you must see all these, right? Yes.. yes.

885
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,760
Anyways check the bills as
soon as possible and send them..

886
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,200
..to the accounts department.

887
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,880
Connect me to Mr. Sen.

888
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,920
Ratnakar, I am very angry with you.

889
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,839
Why sister-in-law?
What mistake have I done?

890
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:28,440
Why didn't you tell me that
you haven't got the payment..

891
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,120
..of the bill for last month?

892
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,959
I didn't require that's
why I didn't tell you.

893
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,720
I know that I'll get
it whenever I'll want it.

894
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,560
Are you joking with me?
I don't want to listen to all these.

895
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,760
Send a man to collect the cheque.

896
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,560
At least let my office's
discipline remain intact.

897
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,440
Yes.. one more thing..
have you thought anything about..

898
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,720
..the silver jubilee
function of our company?

899
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,800
I have thought of a rough concept..
it's getting typed.

900
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,200
Okay.. so are you free in the evening?

901
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,200
Good.

902
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,560
So can you come to our
house along with the programme..

903
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,880
..around 6.30.. no.. 7 p.m.?

904
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,560
You can have dinner along with us.

905
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,040
As you command.

906
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,599
Okay.. we'll meet then.

907
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,880
May I come in?

908
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,120
May I come in?
- Are you joking with me?

909
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,000
After all it's an official visit..

910
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,240
..this is the programme of your function.

911
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,240
Okay.

912
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,120
Sister-in-law,
please give me something to eat.

913
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,519
I am feeling hungry.

914
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,840
What will you eat?

915
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,080
Whatever you'll serve
me with your own hands.

916
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,400
You have grown old but still
you couldn't get rid of your old habits.

917
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,760
If I am an old man
then you are an old woman.

918
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,000
Of course I am an old woman..
I am a mother-in-law now.

919
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,480
Really sister-in-law.

920
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,759
So many years passed
by in front of our eyes..

921
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,680
..isn't it.. thousands of days..

922
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,640
..lakhs of minutes.. crores of seconds.

923
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,599
Have you got anything..

924
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,480
..in your life of crores of seconds?

925
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,200
Have you got anything?

926
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,080
I haven't checked the account..

927
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,480
..but I have got your affection.

928
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,520
That is my savings.

929
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,599
You have only seen my affection, Ratnakar.

930
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,679
But you haven't seen
how much I respect you.

931
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:58,360
How will you know?
I have never let you know about that.

932
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:04,440
Please don't say like this
sister-in-law then I'll be at fault.

933
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:12,480
All your life you stood
by my life as a saint.

934
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,000
You never asked for anything for yourself.

935
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,000
No family.. no wife.

936
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,520
Sister-in-law.. let it be.

937
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,880
On occasion of the
company's silver jubilee..

938
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,240
..which is only possible
because of the outlook..

939
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,680
..of the owner of the company
which has created a very good..

940
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,599
..relationship between
the workers and the owner..

941
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,280
..of the company..
this silver jubilee has been..

942
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:45,320
..possible for that..
that's why we, on behalf of our union..

943
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,040
..want to heartily thank
the director of the company..

944
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,840
..Mrs. Chirasri Ray
Chaudhury and her son..

945
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:59,920
..Mr. Sriranjan Ray Chaudhury,
the secretary of the company thank you.

946
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,599
Now I request the managing
director of the company..

947
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
..Mrs. Chirasri Ray
Chaudhury to say something.

948
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,000
Respected president.

949
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,680
And our worker brothers and sisters.

950
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:37,120
I am really not able to say anything.

951
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,360
Please forgive me.

952
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,559
Mother-in-law..
- Mother.

953
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,240
Are you not feeling well, mother?

954
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,160
No.. no.. why do you worry so much..
I am absolutely fine.

955
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,639
'On occasion of the silver jubilee year,
the company..

956
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,960
..has declared a bonus..
that's why on behalf of all the workers..

957
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,360

To Griffin Selah, dated such and such.

Why have brought this to me?
take it to my son.

967
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,679
This person wants to meet you.

968
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,680
Ask him to come in.

969
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,760
Sheila, I'll finish it later.. okay?

970
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,400
Listen, cancel the Bombay call..

971
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,719
..and don't put through any call now..
I'll let you know.

972
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,800
You..!?

973
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,560
What do you want?

974
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,960
How can I say without sitting?

975
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,400
Sitting down.

976
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,080
Once you are being informal with me.

977
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,360
Then what's the point of doing formality?

978
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,599
How did you come to know about me?

979
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,719
I was reading this news paper.

980
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,280
This has published the news..

981
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,960
..of the silver jubilee
function Srimati Cosmetics.

982
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,840
I was surprised to see your photograph.

983
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,799
I saw your name beneath the photograph.

984
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,000
Then I went to the newspaper
office and tried hard..

985
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,880
..and got the address of this office.

986
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,000
What do you want? Money?

987
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,200
No.

988
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:17,640
Then?

989
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:25,520
I want to expiate my mistake
that I have done in my life.

990
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,880
Expiation? Over here?

991
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,880
No.. I can go wherever
you'll ask me to go.

992
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,640
Give me a minute.

993
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,040
Do you want to say something to me?

994
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,240
Yes, mother.

995
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:13,719
But I am going out now.. come with me.

996
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,840
Tell me.

997
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,720
Today I am tired of my old age.

998
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,960
weak.

999
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,120
I am a vagabond now.

1000
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,960
I roam around like a nomad.

1001
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,360
Sri.

1002
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,200
No.. no.. you can't utter
that name ever.. never.

1003
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,240
Never.

1004
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,120
Mother-in-law, it's 9 o' clock.

1005
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,599
Shall I ask the servants
to lay the table for dinner?

1006
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,320
I won't have dinner today, Sujata..

1007
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,840
..you all go and sit at
the dinner table I am coming.

1008
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,160
Why won't you have dinner?

1009
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,639
I am not feeling hungry.

1010
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,760
Of course you are feeling hungry..
you feel hungry..

1011
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,200
..every day..
why not today? Please get up.

1012
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,080
I am really not feeling hungry, dear..
not only that..

1013
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,640
..I am not feeling well too.

1014
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,360
Why? what happened, mother-in-law?

1015
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,400
Nothing, dear.. okay..

1016
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,799
..let's go to the dinner table..
I'll sit with you.

1017
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,880
Good morning.
Srimati Cosmetics.. what's your name?

1018
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,600

1019
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,840
Priyaranjan Ray Chaudhury? Please hold on.

1020
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:28,200
Hello.. Madam, a gentleman has called up..

1021
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,719
..Ranjan Ray Cahudhury..

1022
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,400
..Priyaranjan Ray Chaudhury.

1023
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,680
Shall I put through him to you?

1024
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,240
Okay.

1025
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,360
Don't call me in the office like this.

1026
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,520
I won't do it again..
today is the first and the last time.

1027
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,240
What do you want?

1028
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,480
Opportunity..
yesterday you didn't give me.

1029
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,720
I want to tell you everything
clearly about me.. then.

1030
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,680
Okay.. come to the place
we had went yesterday..

1031
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,880
..exactly at 5 p.m.

1032
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,599
You know.

1033
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,680
What? Do you believe now?

1034
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,880
Listen, you park the car at the garage.

1035
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,640
I'll take a taxi after finishing shopping.

1036
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,320
Let's go.

1037
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:14,640
Come.

1038
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,200
Sit down.

1039
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,760
Tell me.

1040
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,519
What happened after you got arrested.

1041
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:40,600
Police produced me to the court.

1042
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,000
I accepted my crime..
in front of the judge.

1043
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,160
I said that I have stolen the money.

1044
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,120
I saved Guptada.

1045
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,839
The court sentenced
me to jail for 3 years.

1046
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,040
And company sacked me from the job.

1047
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,800
After coming out of the
jail first I went running to you..

1048
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:09,600
..to apologise for my mistakes.

1049
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,200
There I came to know
that you have left that house.

1050
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,280
No one could say that where you went.

1051
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:20,160
I went to everybody who knew you..

1052
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,120
..in search of you..
no one could say anything.

1053
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,400
I went to Ratnakar's mess as well.

1054
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,040
But no one knew where he had taken
a house after going away from the mess.

1055
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,840
Where do you stay now?

1056
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:41,559
I don't stay here..
most of the time I live in Benaras.

1057
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:48,400
I have a vagabond's life now..
at times I come over here.

1058
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:55,160
While I come here, I stay for
few days at Guptada's flat in Circus lane.

1059
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,599
I roam around on the streets..

1060
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,960
..with a faint hope in my mind.

1061
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,680
Hope?

1062
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,679
If I ever find you and our son.

1063
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:30,880
Keep this.

1064
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,200
What is this?

1065
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,400
Open it and see.

1066
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,320
This is lots of money.

1067
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,679
There is 50,000 rupees.

1068
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,320
I hope that this will be
enough for the rest of your life.

1069
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:13,400
It's not hard to imagine
that you have a lots of money now.

1070
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,040
Keep this money with you..
I don't have any interest in your money.

1071
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,040
What do you want then?

1072
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,640
Forgiveness.

1073
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,400
Anything else?

1074
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,639
I don't have strength..

1075
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,839
..in my mind and body.

1076
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,839
If I could spend the rest of my life..

1077
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,200
..in peace along with the..

1078
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,400
..compassionate touch of your hands.

1079
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,080
Peace?

1080
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,840
You are looking for peace?

1081
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,280
You want the compassionate
touch of my hands?

1082
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,760
Where will you get peace?

1083
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,520
25 years.

1084
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,720
Did you ever want to know
how I have spent these 25 long years?

1085
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,720
You yourself have lost everything.

1086
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,320
You have taken away
everything from me as well.

1087
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,519
God morning, Mrs. Ray Chaudhury.

1088
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:53,440
Good morning.

1089
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,120
Tell me, what can I do for you.

1090
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,000
He is my guest.. he will stay over here..
I want a room for him.

1091
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,920
And send the bill directly to my office.

1092
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,080
Just a minute.

1093
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,320
will room number 302 do?

1094
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,760
It's okay.. thank you.

1095
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,040
Kindly please fill this up.

1096
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,360
I have written the name given by you.

1097
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,160
What shall I write as my address?

1098
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,240
Write whatever you please.

1099
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,400
No, give the address of the
place where you are staying right now.

1100
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,559
Thank you.
- Come on.

1101
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:59,680
Listen.

1102
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,440
What next?

1103
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,160
For the time being you'll stay here.

1104
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,160
I can understand that.

1105
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,160
But.

1106
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,640
Why this grand arrangement?

1107
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,440
You don't need to know that.

1108
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:36,240
Okay.. I don't want to know that.

1109
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,320
.but can I know why you
have captivated me over here?

1110
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,640
I am doing an experiment.

1111
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,200
When are we going to meet next?

1112
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:48,160
I can't say that.

1113
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:53,200
But please don't come to the office.

1114
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:58,440
I won't go tomorrow..
but if you don't come tomorrow then..

1115
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,320
..I'll definitely go
there day after tomorrow.

1116
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,920
Sujata.. Sujata,
I have played very well today.

1117
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,160
What happened, Sujata?

1118
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,840
Mother-in-law hasn't come back home yet.

1119
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,440
What are you saying?
But I saw mother's car outside.

1120
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,360
The driver came back at 5 p.m.
and told me that..

1121
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,759
..mother-in-law has gone to New market.

1122
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,080
Mother-in-law had told him
that she will come back by a taxi.

1123
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,320
Was mother supposed to go to New market?

1124
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,880
She didn't tell me anything.

1125
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,400
Aunty.. aunty.

1126
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:35,559
Did mother tell you that she
will go to New market after office today?

1127
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,200
No.

1128
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,800
Okay.. you may go.

1129
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,040
Malati, has my son
come back from the club.

1130
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,280
Here is my son.. when did you come back?

1131
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,799
Few minutes back..
why did you come back so late, mother?

1132
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,800
You freshen up and sit at
the dining table.. I am coming.

1133
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,720
What's the news Mahadev?

1134
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,120
Tell me some news about the head office.

1135
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,960
So you want news of the head office.

1136
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,040
Yes.

1137
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,360
What will I get in return?
- I'll give you tobacco.

1138
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,440
I want tea. I don't want your tobacco.

1139
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,840
What are you saying?
Come with me to the canteen.

1140
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,480
Are you sure?
- Yes.. of course.

1141
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,480
Okay.. listen now..
I'll have tea later.. you are my friend.

1142
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,880
You are going to buy me a cup of tea..
I'll give you a great news.

1143
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:41,160
But don't tell it to any body..
day before yesterday a old man..

1144
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,560
..looking like a pick pocket
went with madam in her car..

1145
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:47,600
..do you remember?

1146
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,760
Yes, I remember.. very dirty man.

1147
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:54,120
Madam went inside a restaurant
along with that old man.

1148
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,799
Then what? Very cheap restaurant.

1149
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:57,960
Then what?

1150
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,720
Then she spent half
an hour with that old man..

1151
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:01,400
..and then came back.

1152
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,320
Then what?
- Shut up, you idiot.

1153
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,280
I don't know anything after that.

1154
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:19,320
Go and ask Driver Mahadev
to come and meet me.

1155
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:28,320
Now listen to me.

1156
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:32,799
Shut up.. as if know everything..
as if you know everything!

1157
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,960
Every bird eats fish but
everyone blames the king fisher.

1158
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,000
I have heard from mother
that you are very trust worthy.

1159
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,760
It was not right of you to
leave mother in the middle of the way.

1160
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,560
But madam told me to do that.

1161
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,800
Still.. she is old now..
don't leave her alone like this.

1162
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:55,839
But sir, I am her employee..
it was madam's order.

1163
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:59,280
Trust worthy employee's duty
is to take care of his employer.

1164
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,560
If she meets an accident
while travelling alone?

1165
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,080
That's right, sir.

1166
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,120
There are so many different
kind of people involved in business.

1167
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,800
No one can say what
is in other people's mind.

1168
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,000
Follow her orders..
at the same time keep an eye on mother.

1169
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,120
You should come and report
me about where mother goes..

1170
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:19,120
..and with whom does she go out..
am I clear?

1171
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,400
Okay, sir.. can I go now, sir?

1172
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,400
Do you understand Dutta?
This is called senility.

1173
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,719
What are you saying?
That poor man must have asked her..

1174
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,600
..for help..
so she might have helped him..

1175
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:50,000
..Help indeed.. I wish I would
get a lady who would help me like this.

1176
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,839
You are talking rubbish..

1177
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:56,679
..It seems that you are
very much obedient of your madam.

1178
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,560
Do you know that now a
days madam is going to a hotel..

1179
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:01,920
..everyday after office..

1180
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,519
..there she chats with that man for..

1181
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,240
..almost 2 hours and then goes back home.

1182
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,480
How do you know?

1183
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:11,080
One needs to know..
do you understand, brother?

1184
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:15,600
Sin can never be hidden..
first witness is our driver Mahadev.

1185
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,280
Then everybody started talking about it.

1186
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:18,720
From the driver to the watchman..

1187
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:19,880
..from the watchman to the lift man..

1188
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
..then from the liftman to the..

1189
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,960
..peon of our department..
from the peon to me..

1190
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,920
..from me to you..
and from you to the rest of the office.

1191
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,400
Please keep quite..
why do we need to know about all these?

1192
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,440
Sir, can I come in?

1193
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,960
Come in.

1194
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:38,080
Sir, a bill has come from
Nancy hotel in madam's name.

1195
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,599
From which account do we do this payment?

1196
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,519
Show me..
- This is it.

1197
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,840
Let this be with me now..
I'll tell you later what to do.

1198
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,000
Okay, sir.

1199
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,120
Oh it's you.. sit down.

1200
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:15,400
Hello.. yes.. no.. okay.. cancel it.

1201
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,760
Sit down.

1202
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,280
Whose is this bill?

1203
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,040
Oh.

1204
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,600
Do you want any explanation from me?

1205
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,160
No.. I just only want to know.

1206
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:55,360
This bill is for me..
the person staying over there is my guest.

1207
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,560
I have made arrangements
for him to stay over there.

1208
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,520
I see.

1209
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:02,320
Accounts section had forwarded
the bill to me and wanted to know that..

1210
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,520
..from which account
the payment will be made.

1211
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,920
My personal account.

1212
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,400
Do you want to know anything else?

1213
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,000
No.

1214
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:07,760
How long will you keep
me away from you like this?

1215
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,920
Why are you so impatient, dear?

1216
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,720
I'll come to you when
the right time will come.

1217
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,080
Yes please.

1218
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,040
I want the name and
address of the person..

1219
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,599
..staying at room number 302.

1220
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,960
But sir.

1221
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:54,920
You know what sir? Ray Chaudhury
was caught red handed from my flat..

1222
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:59,360
..then he was having
a fight with his wife.

1223
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,320
So I had let him stay over here.

1224
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,440
After all he was my colleague..
but the saddest part was that..

1225
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:10,000
..the poor thing was
sentenced to jail for 3 years.

1226
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,520
Well Mr. Gupta..
when did Mr. Ray Chaudhury..

1227
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,840
..come here for the last time?

1228
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:21,519
Few days back..
he came suddenly and went away suddenly.

1229
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,800
He didn't tell me where he went.

1230
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:26,200
Bye, Mr. Gupta.

1231
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:28,160
Sorry for disturbing you..

1232
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:29,400
..please don't mind.. Not at all.

1233
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:32,600
One more thing..
since you are from police.

1234
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:34,840
Is there any scope of more problem?

1235
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:35,920
No.. no.. you don't worry.

1236
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,640
You came for the first time..
at least have a cup of tea.

1237
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:39,920
No thanks.

1238
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:50,080
&quot;Don't make mistake;
please don't make mistake.&quot;

1239
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:57,640
&quot;Don't make a mistake in love.&quot;

1240
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,200
&quot;You will regret it..&quot;

1241
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:03,800
Has mother come back?

1242
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,080
No.

1243
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,360
Now a days mother
is coming back home late.

1244
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,720
Probably the work pressure
in the office has increased.

1245
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,720
Instead of going to the club and parties..

1246
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,200
..you can help mother-in-law.

1247
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:18,560
Sujata.. Sujata if we go somewhere.

1248
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,440
What do you mean by 'go somewhere'?

1249
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,400
I mean settle some where else.
- Where?

1250
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,760
Europe, America, Australia..
or any other continent.

1251
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,200
Why in some other continent?

1252
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,599
Because the earth of this country
is sweeping away from beneath our feet

1253
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:35,000
..Sujata, today I am missing father a lot.

1254
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:40,280
I feel that of father was
alive then I wouldn't have to carry..

1255
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:43,200
..this load of stigma
on my head like this, Sujata.

1256
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,800
What has happened to you, tell me.

1257
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,080
Why are you saying all these?

1258
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,880
I am suffering from
the pain growing inside me.

1259
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,840
I can't bear this any longer, Sujata.

1260
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,880
What happened?
- Mother.

1261
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:54,040
What happened to mother-in-law?

1262
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:55,440
I myself don't know
what has happened to her.

1263
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:57,800
My heart doesn't want to believe.

1264
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:00,160
But I don't have the
courage not to believe.

1265
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,240
Please tell me clearly, what has happened.

1266
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:06,560
There are rumours in the whole
office about my mother's movements..

1267
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,559
..and I have got the proofs..

1268
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,360
..that these rumours are not base less.

1269
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,880
What are you saying?

1270
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:16,920
Yes.. that's it..
I had seen the man first time..

1271
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:22,000
..in mother's chamber..
mother took the vagabond like man..

1272
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:24,720
..along with her and
went out in front of me.

1273
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,920
That attitude of mother
set my heart ablaze.

1274
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,760
Did you get to know anything of that man?

1275
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:32,519
That man is convict who
was sentenced to jail for 3 years.

1276
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,760
What disastrous thing
are you talking about?

1277
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,839
My mother-in-law is like a goddess..
but ultimately she.

1278
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,599
What have you decided?

1279
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,360
About what?

1280
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,480
About my rehabilitation.

1281
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,719
Do you really want me or.

1282
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,360
You still distrust me.

1283
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,120
Can you give me a proof?

1284
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,559
What proof do you want?

1285
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:14,800
If I say that I'll give
up all my wealth and come to you.

1286
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:18,160
Will you be able to accept me then?

1287
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,520
Test me once.

1288
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,600
Sri.

1289
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,840
I was floating away like a twig.

1290
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,560
You'll help me to live..

1291
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,200
..before dying at least
I'll be able to say.

1292
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,480
No.

1293
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:07,200
Listen, don't go out of
the hotel at all on the days..

1294
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:12,960
..when I won't come..
then I'll make all arrangements..

1295
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:15,920
..and come to you.. okay?

1296
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,760
Okay.. as you say.

1297
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,800
Malati.

1298
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,000
Malati.. has my son
come back from the club?

1299
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,200
Yes.. long time back.
- Where is daughter-in-law.

1300
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:29,360
In your room.

1301
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,679
My room? What are they doing in my room?

1302
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:34,160
Madam, I am afraid.

1303
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:35,960
What are you afraid of?

1304
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:38,320
Your son was saying that he wants
to take up a job in abroad and go away..

1305
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,000
..your daughter-in-law was
asking him to talk to you clearly.

1306
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,200
What happened, Sujata?

1307
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,240
Please sit down first, mother.

1308
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,400
First I want to know
what all you have heard.

1309
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,840
Mother, you don't know what you re saying.

1310
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,440
I know everything.

1311
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,360
There are rumours all around you..
your name is attached..

1312
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:13,280
..to the filthy man's name..
do you know that, mother?

1313
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:18,000
All around?
What all around? All around whom?

1314
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,719
Who is there all around?

1315
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,840
You were 3 years old then.

1316
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,760
I used to carry you in
my arms and used to roam around..

1317
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,960
..the streets of this city in
order to sell lac-dye and vermillion.

1318
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,880
Then who were there around
us to take care of us?

1319
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,000
And now I have brought
you up and standing..

1320
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,920
..with my head held high.
now when I have got my peace of mind.

1321
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,200
Then do I have to listen
to what people all around say?

1322
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,640
But mother, people will
ask many questions about the man.

1323
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,000
I won't answer any one.

1324
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:04,920
Mother-in-law,
you love me more than your own child.

1325
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,320
I have also never thought
you anything other than my mother.

1326
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,400
Please tell me, who is that man.

1327
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,480
Aand why do you have
so much weakness for that man?

1328
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,680
He is everything to me.

1329
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:24,360
But I have heard that
the gentleman was on a..

1330
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:25,480
..jail sentence for 3 years.

1331
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:26,880
How can you call him a gentleman?

1332
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,680
A person who had stolen 10,000 rupees..

1333
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:30,920
..from his office and
was sentenced to jail.

1334
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,320
He can't be called a gentle man.

1335
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,559
He is just a man.

1336
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:40,280
How do you come to know?

1337
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,839
I went to circus lane.

1338
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,440
Why?

1339
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:45,120
To enquire about that man.

1340
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:46,400
Where did you get the address from?

1341
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:47,480
From the hotel.

1342
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:51,680
Now you tell me don't
you go to the hotel everyday..

1343
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,960
..after office and
spend hours with that man?

1344
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:57,120
Yes, I do.

1345
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:01,680
Sriranjan.

1346
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:07,560
If I say that he is your father..?

1347
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:12,200
Mother.. please don't lie.

1348
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
You have taught me all
your life to speak the truth..

1349
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:18,800
..and today you yourself
are telling a lie.

1350
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:20,839
Shame on you, mother.

1351
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,360
Believe me, son.

1352
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:29,000
What will I believe?
My father had died 26 years back.

1353
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:32,600
And today he became alive
for some special reason?

1354
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:38,640
No, son, no..
he wasn't dead.. he got lost.

1355
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:44,120
You might discover your
husband in that convict but..

1356
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,600
..I can never place him in the place..

1357
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,000
..of my dead father, mother.

1358
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:51,000
Wait.

1359
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,200
Wait.. I accept all your allegations.

1360
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,600
Now you tell me, what punishment..

1361
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,840
..do you want to give me.

1362
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:09,400
Mother, please save me.

1363
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:14,800
From this painful situation
I don't know father, mother.

1364
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:19,200
You haven't kept even a photograph
so that I can imagine about him.

1365
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,640
I don't want anything
else from you, mother.

1366
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,560
Just please leave that
filth man whose surname..

1367
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,800
..is also Ray Chaudhury.

1368
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:38,200
At this situation it's not
possible for me to leave that..

1369
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:42,640
..sick and weak man alone, son.

1370
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:49,240
Then you'll have to leave us, mother.

1371
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,840
Okay.

1372
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:16,480
Whatever you want will happen.

1373
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:19,840
I'll not stop it.

1374
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,520
What have you decided?

1375
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,679
I'll make a will and
give them all my property.

1376
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,560
It will take time for
the formalities to be done.

1377
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:33,720
So I have told my lawyer
to let me know on time.

1378
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:35,960
I'll send my address later.

1379
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:42,800
Then I'll come back and sign on the..

1380
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:46,040
..papers and complete all
the formalities and go back.

1381
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:49,960
Where will you go now?

1382
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,280
Benaras.

1383
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:57,360
He has spent most of the
time of his life over there.

1384
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,519
He knows the place
and the people over there.

1385
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,720
After all it will be a
old man and old woman's family.

1386
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:08,400
We'll manage it somehow moreover
I'll try to get a job of a teacher.

1387
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,320
What do you say?

1388
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,320
What do I have to do?

1389
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:17,040
You have to do the last thing for me.

1390
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,200
Sister-in-law.

1391
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:22,480
Of course you'll have to do
it you are my comrade of my struggle.

1392
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,720
Who else other than you will do it?

1393
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,600
What is that?

1394
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,840
You have to deliver the news to my son..

1395
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,600
..tell him that I have left for Benaras.

1396
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:40,920
Okay, I'll do that.

1397
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:43,680
One more thing.

1398
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,080
Give him the news after we leave.

1399
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:52,760
Okay.. as you wish.

1400
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,080
Sister-in-law.

1401
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:09,280
You had to fight all your life.

1402
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,720
Now may god give you peace.

1403
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:28,280
&quot;You were hiding inside my heart.&quot;

1404
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:33,519
&quot;I couldn't see you.&quot;

1405
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:37,760
&quot;I couldn't see you.&quot;

1406
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:43,720
&quot;You were hiding inside my heart.&quot;

1407
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:48,920
&quot;I couldn't see you.&quot;

1408
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,160
&quot;I couldn't see you.&quot;

1409
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:59,360
&quot;My eyes had searched for you outside.&quot;

1410
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:03,200
&quot;Outside the house..&quot;

1411
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:08,600
&quot;But I have never looked inside my heart.&quot;

1412
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:15,200
&quot;You were hiding inside my heart.&quot;

1413
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:30,800
&quot;In my love and in
all my hopes and sorrows..&quot;

1414
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:40,920
&quot;In my love and in
all my hopes and sorrows..&quot;

1415
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:49,680
&quot;You were there with me.&quot;

1416
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:55,000
&quot;I didn't come to you.&quot;

1417
02:01:55,080 --> 02:02:01,440
&quot;You were there with me..&quot;
- Give me.

1418
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,680
Give me.

1419
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,720
Sri.

1420
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,720
Tell me.

1421
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:56,679
Our son, daughter-in-law.

1422
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:00,360
Won't they come?

1423
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,040
Let's not talk about them.

1424
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:05,320
Why?

1425
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:11,400
I have come to you..
haven't I? let's not talk about them.

1426
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,400
Won't I see them for once?

1427
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:21,200
You have gone down in their eyes.

1428
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:25,120
I couldn't tolerate that insult.

1429
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,720
Sri.

1430
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:30,720
Aunty.. aunty.

1431
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:36,360
is late night now..
mother-in-law hasn't returned..

1432
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:39,719
..my husband hasn't returned too..
I am afraid.

1433
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:41,720
Did you call the office?

1434
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,120
..mother-in-law has gone out somewhere
from the office in the afternoon.

1435
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:46,680
And my husband hasn't gone
to the office at all today.

1436
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:48,600
Then where did he go?

1437
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,880
Where were you all day long?

1438
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:55,640
What is mother doing?

1439
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:57,400
Mother-in-law?
She hasn't returned home yet.

1440
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:59,920
What are you saying?
But I saw mother's car in the garage.

1441
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,519
Mother-in-law has left
the car in the afternoon..

1442
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,760
..and had gone away
somewhere from the office.

1443
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,120
What do you mean by 'went away'?

1444
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:06,519
Couldn't you search for her?
- Where will I search for her?

1445
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:09,800
You could have called up uncle.

1446
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:13,599
Even uncle is also not at home
a man came and gave this letter for you.

1447
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:15,160
He has told particularly that I should..

1448
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:16,920
..give you the letter to
you as soon as you come back.

1449
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,320
It's very urgent.

1450
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:24,480
'Dear, Sriranjan.
You haven't recognised you mother yet.

1451
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,720
The man whom you are thinking is filthy..

1452
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,240
..regarding whom you are
thinking your mother is wrong..

1453
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:32,320
..is actually your father our Priyada.

1454
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,600
All my life I have followed
your mother's orders.

1455
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:37,680
But I couldn't follow her last order.

1456
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,160
Sister-in-law had ordered
me to give you the news..

1457
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:42,080
..after I see them off in the Punjab mail.

1458
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:46,920
It's too late now..
let's give it a last try.. come on.

1459
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:16,840
Father.

1460
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:18,040
Mother-in-law.
- Mother.

1461
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:21,080
Father.. father.

1462
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:23,120
Mother-in-law.
- Father.

1463
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:30,000
Uncle..? Where is mother?

1464
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:38,320
You came at last.. but you are late.

1465
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,920
Where is mother, uncle?
