432
01:29:54,634 --> 01:29:56,705
Nothing is in life.

433
01:29:57,634 --> 01:30:00,615
Forget everthing“
And think about veer.

434
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:38,673
This destiny is repeating stow

436
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:45,669
Orwhat is the reason to say no

437
01:32:43,467 --> 01:32:45,469
your brother's real
name isn't raj.

438
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:50,539
Its mean his real
name is ramlal.

439
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:14,380
Therefore brother didn't got married.

440
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:17,548
Ramlal was screwed becaue
he could fullfll page's need.

441
01:35:41,267 --> 01:35:44,305
I just asked you question,
because I neverwanted to become father.

Its all true..

446
01:38:03,367 --> 01:38:07,144
You both disappearfor few days.

447
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,280
Who knows they both

448
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:14,282
they're not ice cream...
you both elope and get married.

449
01:39:49,034 --> 01:39:52,015

Vilalin will pack up,
and hero heroin will patch up

453
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,173
to waking up old love,
you're giving old idea.

454
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,004
The strong intoxication
is in old wine.

455
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:16,080
You just say yes.

456
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:23,047

It doesn't look good“.

473
01:44:39,734 --> 01:44:40,940
How can you say this.

474
01:44:45,734 --> 01:44:47,873
First of all I don't believe
that sister leaved you for money

475
01:44:49,767 --> 01:44:53,840
if she leaved you,
so why she did nt' marry anyone.

477
01:45:01,734 --> 01:45:03,736
Why she didnt' make
anyone her life partner.

478
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:09,705
