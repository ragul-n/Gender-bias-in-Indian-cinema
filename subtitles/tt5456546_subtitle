2
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,360
Mary?

3
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,000
Mary!

4
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
Yes, ma'am?

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,400
Mary, I think my baby's coming.

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,760
- Call sir immediately.
- Yes, ma'am.

7
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,280
Take it easy, Ankita.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,760
You've been eagerly
waiting for this day

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,960
when you would be a mother.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,080
Just come down here
quickly, please.

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,000
- Yes, Ankita, I've boarded.
- Mary, do something.

12
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,440
Ma'am, please, don't panic.

13
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
Take deep breaths.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,560
Please, ma'am. Ma'am.

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,320
Sir, can you please
turn off your phone?

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
- Sir.
- Yes..

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,000
We're running late
because of you.

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,958
Just take your seat and
fasten your seat belt.

19
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,520
I am sorry..

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,880
- Here you are.
- I am sorry. Thank you.

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,720
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,040
- First child?
- Yes.

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,640
It's normal.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,480
Poor thing has no one else to
vent her frustration out on.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,280
- Charles.
- Rajeev.. Rajeev Malhotra.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
I'll pray to God for your child.

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
Thank you.

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,800
Anyway, we are going
to fly quite high.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,080
- God will hear us sooner.
- Yeah. Yeah?

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,200
Relax.

31
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,600
Hello, Rajeev? Where are you?

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,800
Ankita, I've reached
the Mumbai Airport.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,800
One of the passengers has
gone to the washroom.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm looking after his luggage.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,720
Rajeev, I am entering
the operation theatre

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,000
and you are looking after
some stupid passenger's..

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
Please, Ankita, don't say that.

38
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
He wishes our child well.
He's a very kind-hearted man.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,000
Ankita, I am on my way.
Yes. You just.. Yes.

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,280
- Sorry, Mr. Malhotra.
- He's back. I am leaving.

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No, it's all right.

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,240
- Let's go.
- Please come.

43
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,898
So, you have a business in London, Mr.
Malhotra?

44
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,440
Yes.

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,640
Excuse me.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,120
- Yes, Officer?
- You can go.

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,800
Thank you. See you, Charles.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,160
Welcome, Mr. Charles. Let's go.

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,880
Even after we had
such a strong lead

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,200
- we didn't find anything.
- Excuse me, Officer. My watch.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,120
Can I take it?

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
It seems I am
having a good time.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,160
Now, with your permission,
can I wear my clothes?

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,120
Or, do you have
anything else in mind?

55
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,680
Congratulations, Ankita!

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
Wow!

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
I was elated thinking
there's just one.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
But you've given me twins.

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,880
Time for double celebration.

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,480
Congratulations to you too.

62
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,600
Doctor, why are there
bandages on their arms?

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,440
Mr. Malhotra, your
children were conjoined.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,160
We had to operate.

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,960
One child is healthy, but the
other one is a little weak.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,520
And yes, the most
important thing.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,320
Whenever they'd be close to each
other even after being separated

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,160
their reflexes will also
connect with each other.

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,000
- How?
- Like..

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,600
If one child cries, the
other one will cry too.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,560
If one feels pain, the other
one will feel it too.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,600
I'll show you.

73
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,520
Look at this.

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,920
You mean, when one laughs, the
other one will laugh too?

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
Yes.

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,680
When one jumps, the other
one will jump too!

77
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
Mr. Malhotra, such cases are
only one in eight million.

78
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
- Wow!
- Yes.

79
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,600
- Did you hear that, Ankita?
- What? One in eight million?

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,080
Of course. Our children
are one in a million..

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,680
I mean, two!

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,880
Sir, someone is here to see you.

83
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,160
Many, many, many,
congratulations, Mr. Malhotra.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,800
I couldn't stop myself.

85
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
See, I even brought
gifts for the newborn.

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
You shouldn't have
taken the trouble.

87
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,240
And what's this? Seems like
you ran all the way here.

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
Here, drink some water.

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,600
I already know exactly why
you've come here, Charles.

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
Usually, water doesn't
have any colour.

91
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,120
But this water exposed
your true colours.

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,800
What now?

93
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,640
Same old, outdated
confrontational drama!

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,160
The usual blah, blah, blah!

95
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,880
Let's come straight to
the point, Mr. Malhotra.

96
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,160
You don't screw me, I
will not screw you.

97
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,080
I've got a gift for you.

98
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,160
Officers!

99
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,440
Take a look.

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Clever! Very, very clever!

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,440
- No, Charles!
- No.. Down..

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Guns down.

103
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,400
Officer, this one is real.

104
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,040
- You go back and I'll run.
- No!

105
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,080
Catch him!

106
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,880
- Who are you?
- Quiet!

107
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,040
Charles!

108
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
Charles, let my son go.

109
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,760
Go back, Malhotra.
Go back, Malhotra!

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,840
Otherwise, only one of
the twins will remain.

111
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
- No..
- Hey, Officer!

112
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,000
You don't listen!

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
I said, this one's real.

114
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,960
- Should I shoot?
- Charles..

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,080
- Charles, for God's sake, let my child go.
- Go back.

116
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
- Go back.
- Charles..

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,160
- Please, Charles. Charles!
- Go back.

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,080
- Charles..
- You go back and I'll jump!

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,040
Charles!

120
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,280
'Charles, we know
you're inside.'

121
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,480
'The police have
surrounded you.'

122
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,680
'Surrender yourself, Charles.

123
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,520
- Mr. Malhotra, calm down. No..
- Charles!

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,000
- Listen to me..
- Charles..

125
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,960
Charles, where's my son?

126
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Where is my son?

127
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,960
Boom!

128
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,880
- Charles!
- Mr. Malhotra.. My son!

129
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,280
- No, Mr. Malhotra! Hey..
- Leave me!

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,600
Bye, bye, Malhotra.

131
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,800
- My son!
- Sir..

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,000
My son..

133
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,000
How come Kashi has
a baby with her?

134
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
- Come on.
- Hey!

135
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,880
- Whose child is that, Kashi?
- Where did you find him?

136
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,400
- I found this child on an auspicious day.
- I see.

137
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,720
If I can't find his family,
I shall raise him.

138
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
- Great.
- It's okay..

139
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,720
He stopped crying when Kashi
took him in her arms.

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,360
- What are you going to call him?
- Name?

141
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,200
- His name is going to be Raja. Raja!
- Raja!

142
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,440
Charles has been sentenced
to 22 years of imprisonment.

143
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,000
Very good.

144
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Malhotra, I'll get
straight to the point.

145
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,760
You screwed me, I'll screw you.

146
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,200
See you soon.

147
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,800
The law is sending
him behind bars

148
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,240
but his brother-in-law
is still outside.

149
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,400
I will finish what he started.

150
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,040
Malhotra, Charles has
a strong network.

151
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,000
You should go out of this
country for a few days.

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,320
Anyway, your business
is in London.

153
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,160
But why should I..

154
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,040
If not for yourself, do it
for your family and child.

155
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,040
All the best.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,040
Hey..

157
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,200
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you! Wanna come?

158
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Raja! Raja! Raja!

159
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,040
- Raja, save me.
- Save you?

160
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,440
- Yes.
- I won't save you.

161
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,040
Please, Raja..

162
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,000
Idiot, if I don't save
you, who else will?

163
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,760
Wait! Hey!

164
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,840
Now, hit me.

165
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,640
- Hit him, Raja.
- Come on! Hit him.

166
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,560
Raja!

167
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,120
"Today, I am above!"

168
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,080
"And the sky is beneath me."

169
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,520
"I am hanging upside down."

170
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,480
Excuse me?

171
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,760
"My clothes are coming undone."

172
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
"My reputation is at stake."

173
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,960
"My head is upside down."

174
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,080
"Today, I am.."

175
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,640
Excuse me. - "They
have killed me!"

176
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,920
Why is he hanging upside down?

177
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,440
"Made me hang upside down."

178
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
And why is he crying
while singing?

179
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
- Who are you?
- Prem. Prem Malhotra.

180
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,480
- Fresher?
- Yeah!

181
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

182
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,320
- Into music and all, huh?
- Yeah, music student.

183
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,080
- First year!
- Wow, dude! What a nice guitar!

184
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,240
- That's really expensive.
- Wow!

185
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,800
- Nice jacket.
- Yeah, my

186
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,240
- mom bought it..
- Hot body!

187
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
- Man..
- Hey, guys!

188
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
Stop harassing him! Move!

189
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,480
- You okay?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,640
Sorry, they don't know how
to behave with freshers.

191
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
I'll show you.

192
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
My guitar.. Hey!

193
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,480
Guys, give it up
for Prem Malhotra!

194
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,960
The musical star.

195
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,757
Guys, please..

196
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,440
Now he's going to give
a dance performance.

197
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,128
Guys, I don't know how to play.
Come on, play.

198
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,840
I..

199
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,960
- Play..
- Come on..

200
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,280
Come on..

201
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,280
- Play.
- Come on!

202
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
Play..

203
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,280
- Play..
- I can't. Come on.

204
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,360
Play..

205
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,440
Yeah.. Yeah, man!

206
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
- Please..
- Play.

207
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,400
Play!

208
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,240
"Na.. Naked Prem!"

209
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,400
"Na.. Naked Prem!"

210
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,600
"Na.. Naked Prem!"

211
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
"Na.. Naked Prem!"

212
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,760
"Talk of the town,
he is the clown!"

213
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,000
"Check out his undies,
it all comes down."

214
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,960
"Check him out, sipping
like a killer."

215
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,240
"He's in his undies, and
he's good for nothing."

216
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
"He's good for nothing."

217
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,560
"Na.. Naked Prem!"

218
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,720
"Check him out.. Naked Prem!"

219
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,720
Thank you.

220
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,760
Bye, bye..

221
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,800
Yes, Mom?

222
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,600
'How are you,
dear?' - Fine, Mom.

223
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,200
'So, how was your first
day?' - It was great.

224
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,720
In fact, I even
made some friends.

225
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,480
They are all nice.

226
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,360
'Listen, I..' -
Mom, I have to go.

227
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,400
They are calling me.

228
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
- I'll call you later.
- 'Listen.. Do call back.'

229
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,280
Yeah. I'll.. I'll call you back.

230
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,440
Did you talk to Prem? All okay?

231
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,600
He tried really hard,
Rajeev, not to let me know.

232
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,440
But I am his mother.
He was lying to me.

233
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,400
Ankita..

234
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,000
Remember what the doctor had
said when we had twins?

235
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,880
One of them would be weak, and the
other one would be quite strong.

236
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,040
Lord, if only my other
son had been alive

237
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,080
he would've never let his
brother cry like this.

238
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,360
'Hail Lord Ganesha!'

239
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,680
'Hail Lord Ganesha!'

240
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,720
"We are Your devotees.
Where will we go?"

241
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,160
"My heart is in trouble.
Please heed my plea."

242
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,920
"We are Your devotees.
Where will we go?"

243
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,120
"My heart is in trouble.
Please heed my plea."

244
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,560
"I don't understand
what's happening to me."

245
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,920
"Do something.. Please,
do something."

246
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,800
"Listen, Lord Ganapati.
Girls trouble me."

247
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,320
"Listen, Lord Ganapati.
Girls trouble me."

248
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,240
"Listen, Lord Ganapati.
Girls trouble me."

249
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,160
"Please give me some
solution to this problem."

250
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,360
"Please grant me some wisdom,
it's a serious matter."

251
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,560
"Someone whispers sweet
stuff into my ears."

252
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,760
"They knock and enter my heart."

253
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,000
"Girls are spoiling me."

254
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,520
"Even I am getting
spoilt, gradually."

255
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,680
"I don't know if I am
laughing or crying."

256
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,040
"Do something.. Please,
do something."

257
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,960
"Listen, Lord Ganapati.
Girls trouble me."

258
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,240
"Come on.. Hey.."

259
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,920
"Hey.."

260
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,040
"I have got no one other
than You in this world."

261
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,480
"I grew up at Your feet."

262
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,600
"My heart is Your abode. I fear
none when You are with me."

263
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,360
"Whether I am innocent or naughty,
You know everything about me."

264
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,640
"Sometimes, I sang hymns for You
and You sang lullabies for me."

265
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,840
"Do something.. Please,
do something."

266
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,760
"Listen, Lord Ganapati.
Girls trouble me."

267
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
"Listen, Lord Ganapati.
Girls trouble me."

268
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,160
- "All hail Lord Ganapati..
- Hail!"

269
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,640
- "Hail Lord Ganapati!
- Hail!"

270
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,680
Raja!

271
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,040
Raja, that bloody
rascal grabbed my neck

272
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,040
- and chucked me aside.
- Yeah, I know..

273
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Hey, Puss in Boots!

274
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,240
The shoes you're looking for

275
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
are on Nandu's feet.

276
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,360
- These are great..
- These are great shoes.

277
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,480
Hey! Who are you?

278
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,520
- Raja!
- He says 'Raja'.

279
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,200
The guy you pushed
is my brother.

280
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,160
And his reputation
is my reputation.

281
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,560
And Raja's reputation
isn't some beauty soap

282
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,760
which you can use
and throw away.

283
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,440
Get my shoes.

284
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,960
Great!

285
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,280
Bless you, Raja.

286
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,240
- You knocked them out!
- I did, right?

287
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,680
Do I have to keep kicking
your sidekicks all night?

288
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Won't you come?

289
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,440
Aren't you going to fight?

290
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,200
Come and fight Raja, come on.

291
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,560
Raja?

292
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,040
Raja! Raja!

293
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,600
Blood!

294
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,560
Raja, you know what? Let's
return his shoes and get out.

295
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,080
We will.. But only after
dealing with Alex.

296
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,200
- Come on, Raja..
- Come on.

297
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,640
- All hail..
- Lord Ganesha!

298
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,160
Come on, Raja.

299
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,000
Come on!

300
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,560
Get up..

301
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,920
- If you hit Raja, I won't spare you.
- Nandu!

302
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,680
Get lost!

303
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,760
Come on, Raja. Beat that rascal.

304
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,520
Beat that rascal. Beat him..

305
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,320
- How dare you imitate me!
- I am not imitating you.

306
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,360
I've been like this
since childhood.

307
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Shut up, I don't talk
to people who stammer.

308
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,680
- Hit him, Raja.
- Very good, beat him up!

309
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,360
Will you stop..

310
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,280
Staying up all night takes
a toll on my health.

311
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,398
You should've had two
bottles of beer. On duty?

312
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,080
Yes!

313
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
Are you mad?

314
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
- What are you two doing here?
- Where else do we go?

315
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,560
Alex's condition is critical.

316
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,918
His men are looking all
over for you, you know?

317
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,680
Yes.

318
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,360
Raja, idea! 'Tatu-Tatot'!

319
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,488
What?

320
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,680
Shut up, Nandu. Look, Raja, Ms.
Kashi is no more.

321
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,560
If she was alive, she would've been
definitely worried about your life.

322
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,840
- Wouldn't she?
- He's right.

323
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,680
You know what, Raja?

324
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,200
- Go away from this area for a few days.
- Yes.

325
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,080
- What?
- That is why.. 'Tatu-Tatot'!

326
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,160
- What?
- Surat-Rajkot?

327
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
What about Surat-Rajkot?

328
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,960
Alex will find him even there.

329
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,280
- Right.
- Well, leave India. Yes.

330
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,120
- But we don't have passports.
- No, Raja, there is only one way.

331
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,720
- 'Tatu-Tatot'!
- Shut up! I'll slap you!

332
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,880
- Let them speak, Nandu.
- Look, Raja. Yeah?

333
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,160
I know someone who
will take your photos

334
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,800
and stick it on someone else's
passport and send you out of India.

335
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,680
- Who is he?
- Pappu Passport! Yes!

336
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,200
You fool, I've been
trying to say..

337
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,920
Pappu Passport..

338
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
Pappu Passport!

339
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,880
No fear when Pappu
Passport is here.

340
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,240
So, where do you want to go?

341
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,480
Mr. Pappu, we're in
a lot of trouble.

342
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,840
We want to go out of India.

343
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,280
But you don't have to worry.

344
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,160
Raja can give you Rs. 20,000!

345
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,360
Despite being a pauper,
you talk like a king!

346
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,400
Never mind. If you add 30 more to
it, I can send you to a place.

347
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,200
- Which place is that?
- Look.

348
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,280
- Dancing..
- He is dancing!

349
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,960
Africa, Congo.

350
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,160
No, we're used to Indian drums.

351
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,560
We don't want to go to Congo.

352
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,400
- Where do you want to go?
- Give us a second.

353
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,400
- Pappu is showing us really boring..
- London!

354
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,920
"You and me.."

355
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,400
"Britian.."

356
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,480
"Buckingham Palace.."

357
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,920
Ghatkopar..

358
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,920
You and me in London.

359
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,200
London, sweetheart.

360
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,160
If you go there.. I have
a friend in London.

361
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,360
- Who?
- His name is Sharafat Ali.

362
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,120
- He owns a pizza shop.
- Pizza!

363
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,440
You'll get a job too.

364
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,158
And as soon as you get a
job, you'll get a girl.

365
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:57,720
Girl!

366
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Life will be good!

367
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,640
Rs. 10 lakh.

368
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,120
Mr. Pappu, do you know why
we want to go to London?

369
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,880
Why?

370
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Mother used to say...

371
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,880
Your mother used to say what?

372
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,040
About brother,
mother used to say..

373
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,160
"Look at Ram's gait."

374
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,840
"It's so explosive."

375
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,280
But someone jinxed
my brother's gait.

376
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,440
And the local goon
broke his leg.

377
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,080
The doctor said that my brother's
legs are beyond repair.

378
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,040
- We need to arrange Rs. 50 lakh.
- What?

379
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,160
Yes.

380
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,960
I already paid the
first instalment.

381
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,200
How?

382
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,520
A cricket umpire was
missing a finger.

383
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,520
I gave him my finger.

384
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,640
- But you have all ten fingers.
- He had 11.

385
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,360
- 11 fingers?
- And he cut off one.

386
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,960
Do you know how I paid
the second instalment?

387
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,680
There was an RJ. Radio Jockey.

388
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,800
He was dumb. We gave
him his tongue.

389
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Nandu, give him a demo.

390
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,400
First, I cut off my tongue
and then, gave it to him.

391
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,800
- Cut off your tongue?
- Yes.

392
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,960
- The doctor is calling.
- Give it to him.

393
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,240
What do I tell the doctor?

394
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,560
- What do I tell him?
- Talk to him.

395
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,040
- Please talk to him, Mr. Pappu.
- No, you do.

396
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,920
- What should I say to him?
- Look..

397
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,680
Talk to him.

398
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,400
You do so much for your
family and friends.

399
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,160
You're an angel.

400
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,880
You've awakened the
human inside me.

401
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,640
I'll send you.

402
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,840
Even if I have to sell
my home or my office.

403
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Even if I become bankrupt

404
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,000
I will send you to London.

405
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,480
Don't cry.

406
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,240
Don't cry. I'll send
you to Heathrow.

407
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,960
Raja..

408
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,880
- This is a really nice place.
- Why?

409
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,800
We can touch the air hostess
whenever she comes and goes.

410
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,480
- Hey, Nandu!
- Oh, sorry.

411
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,480
- May I help you?
- Hi! Where is this seat?

412
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,720
Just over there.

413
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,080
- Move.
- What a view!

414
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,480
Move! Your jacket.

415
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,360
These days, airplanes
are so crowded.

416
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,560
- What?
- What? It's my seat.

417
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,560
- How are you? Are you single?
- Excuse me?

418
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,400
I am talking to her.

419
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,400
- Hi.
- Hi

420
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,320
- How are you?
- Yeah.. London?

421
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,800
- Me too. Together..
- Do you want to change?

422
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,760
- No.
- No, I like my seat.

423
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,840
Nice seat.

424
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
'Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.'

425
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,600
'We are experiencing a
little turbulence.'

426
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,720
Hey, student of the fear!
First time traveller?

427
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
- Yes.
- Oh!

428
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,920
- I mean, the first time this week.
- Oh!

429
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,800
Actually, you know what?

430
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,520
If you're scared, you can sing..

431
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,040
- It really works, you should try it.
- Scared?

432
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,640
Who is scared?

433
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,240
- Raja, this plane is going to crash.
- It's just turbulence.

434
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,000
- Please, don't panic.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

435
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,680
It is just a turbulence.

436
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,880
- Raja! Raja!
- Put on your seat belt.

437
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,160
The air hostess stammers too.

438
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,200
She's saying 'turbulence'
instead of 'ambulance'.

439
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,120
Who gives them the licence?

440
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,920
- Raja..
- Yes, Nandu?

441
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,840
- Wooing the girl?
- No, Nandu.

442
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,120
- Cosying up with her?
- No, Nandu.

443
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,560
Open your eyes.

444
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,800
- You're in my blanket? How cheap!
- Excuse me! This is my blanket.

445
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,920
That one is yours.

446
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,960
By the way, your last line, 'how
cheap', was really hurting.

447
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,920
But you cosying up to me in my
blanket was really romantic.

448
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,160
Shut up!

449
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,760
'Ladies and gentlemen, we've safely
landed at London Heathrow Airport.'

450
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,160
'We hope you have
enjoyed your flight.'

451
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
We're in London!

452
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,880
We've arrived in
London, Nandu! Yeah!

453
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,800
- Good day.
- You.. What the..

454
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,440
What's happening to me?

455
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,360
- Oh, God! Stop it!
- Sorry, sorry.. Just look!

456
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,440
Something's happening
to me. What can I do?

457
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,920
Hey, stop it. Stop it, man.

458
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,120
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey, what are you doing?

459
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,080
Come on..

460
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,960
Wow!

461
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,080
At the college's
annual music event

462
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
you're going to rock it, man.

463
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
- I'll try.
- Hi. Samaara.

464
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,760
- Prem. Prem Malhotra.
- Prem, you're awesome.

465
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,040
I am sure you could've
showed your skills that day

466
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,880
but all thanks to Rocky..
He's kind of absurd!

467
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
He's crazy.

468
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,160
Prem, can I ask
you for a favour?

469
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,720
Anything.

470
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,360
Can you teach me some music?

471
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,000
Well, I can teach you
music from A to Z.

472
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,160
Okay! So, my place?

473
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,480
I mean, you can teach me
music at my place, at 4 p.m.

474
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,760
Then I'll be there at your
place today at 4 p.m.

475
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,240
- Today? Well, it's already 5 p.m.
- Oh!

476
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,080
- Sorry.
- Tomorrow. Tomorrow at 4 p.m.

477
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,520
- Yeah, tomorrow 4 p.m.
- Okay.

478
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,720
- Yeah. Great.
- All right.

479
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,960
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

480
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,720
And you're really good.

481
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,160
Tomorrow, 4 p.m.

482
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,680
Hello!

483
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,360
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

484
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,520
What if Rocky finds out that you're
going over to Samaara's house?

485
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,328
Then you'd be..

486
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,560
Why would Rocky have a
problem if I meet Samaara?

487
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,440
- Because she's mine.
- Yeah. Stay away from Samaara.

488
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,760
Or else, I'll deactivate
you like this SIM card.

489
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,440
What are you doing? What
are you doing, Raja?

490
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,760
We're in an airport,
everyone's watching.

491
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,320
Raja, what's happening?
What is happening?

492
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,680
Raja, what's wrong?

493
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,440
What happened? Shall
I call for a doctor?

494
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,000
- Hi!
- Bye!

495
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Remember me in your
prayers and kisses.

496
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,240
Hey, Raja..

497
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,480
Mad!

498
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
Raja, what keeps
happening to you?

499
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,600
In the airplane, you
were doing such antics.

500
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,720
And while collecting
your luggage

501
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,200
- you were acting obscene!
- Nandu, I wasn't doing it intentionally.

502
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
It felt like someone caught me.

503
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,000
- I don't get it.
- Hey, Raja.. Yes?

504
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,520
I think you're going
crazy out of happiness.

505
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,200
Yes, because it's the first
time I flew in an airplane.

506
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,880
- That's why..
- Welcome to London, Mr. Raja, Mr. Nandu.

507
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,600
- How do you know Raja?
- Well, Pappu Passport sent me.

508
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,680
- Pappu Passport?
- Yes.

509
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,480
Pappu Passport insisted that I
should take good care of you two.

510
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,800
So, I've made all
the arrangements.

511
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,400
Free car, along with
pickup and drop facility.

512
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
Free boarding, free food..

513
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,880
- And a free massage, every two hours.
- With coconut oil?

514
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,520
No, stupid! With London
police's truncheon.

515
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,000
Inspector Dhillon,
London Police.

516
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,320
- Look, you can arrest us if you want.
- I will.

517
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,480
- But I would like to say something.
- Go ahead.

518
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,160
My father is sick.

519
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,520
What's wrong with your father?

520
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,120
He got hurt and fell.

521
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
A man first falls down
and then gets hurt.

522
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,880
- He fell asleep and the fan fell on him.
- Oh, my!

523
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Bam!

524
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Hey, relax!

525
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,600
We came here for his treatment.
Even paid Pappu Passport.

526
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,880
I sold my kidney for it.

527
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,680
- You sold a kidney?
- I did.

528
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,800
I am not worried
about the kidney.

529
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,600
But when my father finds out

530
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,680
that his son is rotting
in Dhillon's jail

531
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,240
my poor sick father won't even
be able to commit suicide.

532
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,800
- Why? Why not..
- The fan already fell on him!

533
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,720
- There is no fan!
- Oh, yes!

534
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,880
Then how will he hang himself?

535
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,200
Phone.. Let him talk.

536
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,680
It's my father
calling. My father.

537
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
- Will you talk to him?
- Stop it. You'll make me cry.

538
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,600
You live in London and make
fun of the poor like us?

539
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,400
Lord, there's so much
sorrow in the world.

540
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,000
- Do you have a handkerchief?
- Give it to him.

541
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,000
Here you go. Wipe
your tears properly.

542
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
There's so much
sorrow in this world.

543
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,400
There's more sorrow than the
number of people in this world.

544
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
May God bless everyone.

545
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,880
- Hey, Watermelon.
- It's Dhillon.

546
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,600
Whatever! Those two? Are
they Raja and Nandu?

547
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,600
No..

548
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,680
What the.. Oh, yes!

549
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,880
Rascals! Making a fool of a
fellow Indian. I won't spare you.

550
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,200
Raja, a train has arrived at
the airport. Let's catch it.

551
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,320
Get in..

552
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I won't spare you.

553
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,000
Come back!

554
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,000
He made a fool out of me.

555
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,480
- Raja?
- Yes.

556
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,320
- Nandu?
- Even you know Raja?

557
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,000
For sure, you'll find
me feeble-minded

558
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,800
but favouring you will
be highly flammable.

559
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,400
As I can foresee that both
of are fatuous, frenzy

560
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,520
and feckless and you've
faltered frantically.

561
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
What did he say?

562
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,200
I just stammer, but
he's out of control.

563
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,200
Did you understand a word?

564
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,880
I did! Of course, I did!
Thank you, Mr. Sharafat.

565
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,400
- He has hired us.
- Thank you, Mr. Sharafat.

566
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,280
Hey.. Come here..

567
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,320
You are really nice.

568
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,120
Pappu Passport is
in police custody.

569
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,800
I can't take the risk of
giving you two a job.

570
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,120
No, please, Mr. Sharafat. We
came here depending on you.

571
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
- But I can't take this risk.
- But, Mr. Sharafat..

572
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,428
If we stay here, you
will be out of danger.

573
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,120
How?

574
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,800
Places like these easily
turn into a battleground.

575
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,880
- Battleground?
- Yeah.

576
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,880
In the dead of night, people
rob cute guys like you.

577
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,000
Where's the owner?

578
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,400
Where's the owner?

579
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,880
I-I am the owner.

580
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,000
- What happened?
- Give us the money?

581
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,120
- Give us the money.
- Listen to me.

582
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
Hit him again! Hit him again!

583
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,600
But imagine what would've
happened if I was there!

584
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,600
What?

585
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Take a look.

586
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,280
Where's the owner?

587
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,720
Where's the owner?

588
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,120
Hit him!

589
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,600
- Marvellous! Marvellous..
- What are you doing?

590
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,200
- You're not a kid. You're the owner.
- Yeah.

591
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,800
Boss, if you give us the
job, you stand to benefit.

592
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,960
What are you thinking?

593
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,600
Flawlessly figuring out which
forte should be functionalised.

594
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,360
- What?
- What?

595
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,000
I am thinking whether I
should offer you a job

596
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,400
or partnership.

597
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,200
Sweetie, you're looking
beautiful. Really nice.

598
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,200
- Mom, I am uncomfortable.
- You see..

599
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,120
Your body language isn't right.

600
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,120
Once he sees your front and back

601
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,120
- he'll follow you everywhere.
- Please, Mom!

602
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,120
What is this?

603
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,720
Rajeev Malhotra's son, Prem,
is coming over to meet you.

604
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Oh, my God.

605
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,200
His bank balance even makes
the banks unbalanced.

606
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,880
Mom, stop talking about
money all the time..

607
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,280
- How are you, ma'am?
- Great.

608
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,600
Hi.

609
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,120
You're looking nice.

610
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,600
- Really?
- After all, she's my daughter.

611
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,320
- Prem, please come in.. Mom..
- She is pushy..

612
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,088
Prem.. I'm so happy.
So, you're into music?

613
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,200
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,600
- So am I! Would you like to hear?
- No..

615
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Please do.

616
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,720
- Sa, Re, Ga, Ma.. Amitabh Bachchan!
- Mom..

617
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,480
- Sa Re Ga Ma Pa.
- Yeah, but Amitabh Bachchan was in 'Paa'!

618
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,600
Got you! Good one, right?

619
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,000
- Go to her bedroom and get started.
- Mom!

620
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,120
With your music! I'll
get some snacks.

621
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,120
"Do the garba.."
- I am not a garba dancer.

622
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,320
"Do the garba.." - Hey..
- Go on!

623
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,280
Oh, Shirley, you turned out to
be like Kate Winslet in Titanic!

624
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,280
- You and him, in the car...
- Excuse me, miss.

625
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
We're on the lookout for
illegally immigrating Indians.

626
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,600
- So, if you've seen them, just say.
- Later.

627
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,320
- Hey, show her the picture.
- Yes.

628
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,120
You have never seen them
before, right? Thank you.

629
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
She's never seen them
before. Let's go.

630
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,400
You don't want me to catch these
guys and get a promotion.

631
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,120
That's been your plan all along.

632
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,880
- Stupid!
- Get lost. Go away!

633
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,880
You maniac!

634
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Thank you, she's never
seen them before.

635
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,880
Do you realise this? Get lost.

636
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You're the worst partner
any cop can ever have.

637
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,400
"Oh, yeah, you are.."

638
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,800
Sorry.. T-There was a
mosquito over there.

639
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,200
Mosquito?

640
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,218
You followed me all the way
to my dad's supermarket..

641
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,880
Hey!

642
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,320
I wasn't following you. I
am the pizza delivery boy.

643
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,880
Nothing surprising.

644
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,600
This is what illegal London
gatecrashers like you do.

645
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
- Hey, bonfire.
- Bonfire?

646
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,600
Always raging!

647
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,200
Don't think I am a pushover.

648
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,720
- I've 500 billion in my bank.
- What?

649
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,680
500 billion in my bank, but
only 500 in my account.

650
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
- Pretty soon, you won't have that either.
- Why?

651
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,800
- Come on.
- Where are you taking me?

652
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,280
- What are you doing?
- Inspector.. Hey!

653
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,240
Before you call him, hear
me out at least. Please!

654
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,880
What?

655
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,480
Mother used to say..

656
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,200
"Fair wrists.."

657
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,000
"O' lady, your fair wrists."

658
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,960
- Meaning?
- I mean, if I go to jail

659
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,600
my 11 sisters will
never get married.

660
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,000
- Eleven sisters?
- Yes. And I was the 12th man.

661
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,200
I arranged Rs. 11 lakh for
the dowry of my 11 sisters.

662
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But their in-laws didn't accept

663
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
my old 500 and
1000 rupees notes.

664
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,600
It was so damn demoralising
and demonetising.

665
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,520
After that, somehow..
Don't ask how.

666
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,600
I accumulated the money and came
to London to work. To toil!

667
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,118
And you want to hand
me over to the police?

668
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,800
No! Sorry!

669
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,800
- What?
- I am sorry.

670
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,600
If I don't take up the
responsibility for my 11 sisters

671
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,280
- how will I face my neighbouring father?
- Neighbouring father?

672
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,280
There were already 12
people in the house.

673
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,000
So, father had to stay
with the neighbours.

674
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,960
"Fair wrists, oh, baby,
your fair wrists.."

675
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,000
It's my father. He's calling
from our neighbour's house.

676
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
What do I tell father?

677
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
What should I tell him?

678
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,280
- Talk to him, please.
- No, I am sorry. What am I going to say?

679
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,200
Tell him that you want to
hand me over to the police.

680
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
- Tell him..
- No, please...

681
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,880
- Ma'am, my bill..
- Please, I am sorry.. Hey

682
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,800
..I guess he'll get her
pregnant with a kiss. See you.

683
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,000
Ma'am, I was saying..

684
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,600
Good, continue.

685
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,720
The money is right
here. Have fun.

686
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Sorry. Sorry, I didn't
mean to do that.

687
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,800
I am very sorry, I don't..

688
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,720
- I didn't know what's happening!
- Mom!

689
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,600
- Samaara.. Samaara, I am very..
- Mom!

690
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,120
Go! - Don't call your
mom. I didn't intend to!

691
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
I don't know what happened..

692
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,600
I am.. I am sorry,
Mother. Sorry, Daughter.

693
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,120
I don't know what's
happening to me.

694
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,720
I need a shrink. I need the NHS.

695
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,600
Help me! Help me, O' Lord.

696
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,080
- Mom, he kissed me.
- Not just you..

697
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,400
He kissed me as well.

698
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,520
"My veil flies away!"

699
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,400
- Mom!
- "My veil flies away!"

700
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,600
Come on.

701
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Come, my son.

702
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,320
He's my childhood
friend, Bakshi.

703
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
His daughter is as
beautiful as his home.

704
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,120
- I want you to meet her.
- But I don't want to!

705
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,480
Why? Look..

706
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,200
This is just like you
guys play on Facebook.

707
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,000
You like somebody, you
dislike somebody!

708
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,400
Like-dislike, right?
This is similar.

709
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,200
- But I am not on Facebook.
- That's all right! Come.

710
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,520
- Stop pushing me.
- Come on.

711
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,080
Malhotra!

712
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,040
When I saw from afar..

713
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,160
Bakshi, you've been repeating

714
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,600
- this one-liner for 30 years now.
- Bang on!

715
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,200
- Dad, he's very loud.
- Yes, he's very..

716
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,600
When I saw from afar, something
was hanging on the wall.

717
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
When I came closer, I saw
it was my best buddy.

718
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,200
So happy to see you.
So happy to see you.

719
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,280
- Meet my son, Prem.
- Give me your blessings.

720
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,600
Oh, my God! He's taking
my blessings! In London!

721
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
- What would you like, dear?
- Sir, milk will do.

722
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,320
- Milk?
- Milk?

723
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
You're a guy! Guys
don't drink milk.

724
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
- A cow gives milk.
- That's right!

725
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,680
- Dad, they are very strange.
- Yes, they are.

726
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,600
Raja!

727
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,680
This is my daughter, Alishka.

728
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,880
- Come here, Alishka.
- Hello!

729
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,600
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

730
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,520
Alishka, that's Mr.
Malhotra and Prem.

731
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,600
Take his blessings.

732
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,800
- Dad!
- Come on, dear. Go ahead..

733
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,200
- Dad..
- Not him, dear. The father..

734
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,400
Let it be, dear.

735
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,080
- She just winked at me.
- Yes, I saw.

736
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,520
Malhotra, you can ask her now
as to what all she does.

737
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,400
- Yes. What do you do, dear? I'll tell you.
- Sure.

738
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,520
Dad! - While taking a selfie, she
can make different types of faces.

739
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,520
- Really?
- This.. Get back. Dad.. Dad..

740
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,520
- Sir, we both will sit near the pool.
- No!

741
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,080
- Come on! I don't like pools.
- Come on!

742
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,200
- I don't want to swim.
- Come on.

743
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,868
Please.

744
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,680
He wants milk? I'll bring the milk!
No worries..

745
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,600
You're an awesome actor, man.

746
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,400
Looking cultured,
asking for milk..

747
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
- Whereas, the other day, you went wild!
- Wild?

748
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,280
Oh! Did you forget?
You kissed so hard.

749
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
That was just a mistake.

750
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,320
- But how do you know?
- Oh, come on!

751
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,880
- You kissed so hard, everyone knows.
- Everyone?

752
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,720
- Of course! Stop pretending now.
- Please, don't tell my dad.

753
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,480
Now, you're on track.

754
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,200
But I must say!

755
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
You just barged into my
house with a fake father

756
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,480
- and impressed my dad as well.
- Fake father?

757
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,920
- Please behave yourself.
- Oh, yeah!

758
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,800
- I will behave myself.
- What are you doing?

759
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,200
You deserve another one.

760
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,920
- Come on..
- No.. What are you doing?

761
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,600
Please don't..

762
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,520
What the.. Oh, my!

763
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,800
Like you said..

764
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,320
'Remember me in your
prayers and kisses.'

765
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,000
- This is Stacy, this is Liz..
- They are all foreigners.

766
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,840
Yes, after Dipti's death..
- Dad.. - Yes? - Dad.

767
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,600
- What happened?
- You're shaking. Are you okay?

768
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,800
- Dad, I'm feeling vertigo. I want to go.
- Have some coffee.

769
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,080
- No, I am getting palpitations.
- Then, have a biscuit.

770
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,000
- I have a heart problem, Dad.
- Then lie down for a bit

771
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,680
- in Alishka's bedroom.
- What is it? Dad, I have a problem..

772
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,120
- Calm down.
- I can't take it anymore.

773
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,720
- Okay..
- Why don't you.. Did you have the milk?

774
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,080
The milk was really
good, sir. Thank you.

775
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,800
- Okay. Calm down. Calm down.
- Wait..

776
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,280
He's a little weird guy,
but.. How did you like him?

777
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,038
Since you chose him for
me, he must be right.

778
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,800
See?

779
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,080
"My love is here.."
- Okay!

780
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,200
Did you see my daughter
dance in Sanskrit?

781
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,188
First time, I saw swag in
Sanskrit, Brother-in-law.

782
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:21,760
Yes.

783
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,800
I guess the boy is right. But
I think the girl is wrong.

784
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,760
Nothing's wrong here.

785
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,200
It's my values which I
gave my Indian daughter.

786
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,880
- I know everything.
- If you know everything, tell me.

787
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,000
Who gets the 'Man of the Match'
award in a women's cricket match?

788
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,800
- Can we travel to Mars on a Friday?
- What?

789
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,320
- Were Einstein and Valentine brothers?
- You're crazy.

790
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,080
- Tell me..
- "My love is here.."

791
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,200
You know, my gut feeling

792
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,600
says that Raja is
somewhere around.

793
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,800
Samaara? Samaara!

794
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,880
- I know.
- Excuse me.

795
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,000
Sorry..

796
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,720
Samaara, just a minute, please.

797
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,920
I'll see you girls.

798
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,800
- Bye!
- What?

799
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Samaara, I've never
behaved like that before.

800
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,600
I don't know what happened to me.
It was me, but it wasn't me.

801
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,120
That kiss.. Your mom.. I
didn't mean to do that.

802
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,880
I am.. I am sorry.

803
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,280
Prem, you should do two things.

804
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,880
First, consult a doctor. You
really need it urgently.

805
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,888
Second?

806
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,600
Second, I am hungry.
Let's talk over lunch.

807
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,400
What would you like to eat?

808
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,920
Hi! Can I get a pepperoni
pizza, please?

809
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,280
- Excuse me, are you single?
- Yes.

810
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,120
Hey, she's single, you're
single, ready to mingle.

811
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,680
- Oh, my, Toyota.
- Sorry?

812
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,280
- I am Raja from Versova.
- Alisha, from Radford.

813
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,200
- Here's your burger and fries.
- Thanks.

814
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,800
By the way, you look
good without specs.

815
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,400
Radford, you look amazing.

816
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,080
Which pizza would
you like to have?

817
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,680
Sorry.. I don't know
why.. I didn't mean it.

818
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,600
He can do it with both the eyes.

819
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,480
Sorry.. I don't know why.
Did something go inside..

820
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,520
He's a magician.

821
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,600
- You haven't changed a bit!
- No, I have..

822
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,320
- You need help.
- Samaara, I am very sorry.

823
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,920
The eye doesn't stop.
Keeps fluttering.

824
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,280
Samaara, I am very sorry. Ma'am.

825
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,600
What's happening with me?

826
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,600
Samaara! Samaara!
Samaara, listen..

827
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,600
- My promotion! Raja from India.
- Who is it? Sir, please let me go.

828
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,600
- Who are you, sir?
- Dhillon.

829
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,120
- I am Inspector Dhillon.
- Poonam Dhillon, please let me..

830
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,600
- It's Kuldeep Dhillon.
- Sorry.

831
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,000
Officer, please let me go.
Otherwise, I'll get in big trouble.

832
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,200
- Otherwise? Threatening the police?
- No, sir.

833
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,600
- Otherwise, what will you do?
- I respect the police.

834
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,600
I respect the law, sir.

835
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,137
Oh, my God! Since when
did you start smoking?

836
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:12,000
Do you want one?

837
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,320
- Stay away from me. And don't follow me.
- Is she crazy?

838
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,120
You..

839
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,600
Hey, take it easy, bro. She's
just a simple, innocent girl.

840
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,000
She's hot and sexy too.

841
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,480
Honesty in the first line.

842
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,680
Molesting in the second?

843
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,480
Let the girl go!

844
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,360
I'll deal with you..

845
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,920
- Sorry, Policeman.
- You can't hit the police. It's a crime.

846
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,520
I am not hitting you,
sir. It is not me.

847
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,880
Sir.. Please forgive me, sir.

848
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
- Listen to me..
- I don't know! I need a doctor, sir.

849
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,480
- Take me to a doctor, sir.
- No, no.. Please!

850
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,120
Wait!

851
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,760
Come.

852
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,320
Sir..

853
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,960
What's happening to me?

854
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,040
- How dare you push a police officer!
- Excuse me.

855
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,080
Where did he go?

856
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
I won't spare you.

857
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,800
Raja, I'll get that promotion.

858
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,120
This is wrong.

859
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,720
Raja!

860
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,880
You're dead.

861
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,600
Come on, you cop! Come on.

862
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,440
Hey, stop!

863
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,480
- Phillon!
- What are you doing?

864
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,520
Dhillon!

865
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,680
Move.

866
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,440
Pass.. Pass the ball.

867
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,400
Pass the ball..

868
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,680
Pass the ball.. Throw,
throw.. Go, go..

869
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,920
What the...

870
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,320
Come down, you monkey!
I'll take you to task.

871
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,320
Shall I come down?

872
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,120
- Shall I come down?
- Careful.

873
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,080
Fine, I am coming.

874
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,920
Don't hit the police!

875
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,800
- Come on, you cops.
- Hey, stop..

876
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,520
What happened?

877
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,520
What's wrong with Samaara?

878
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,080
Actually, she
became unconscious.

879
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,760
So, I brought her here.

880
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,760
- What did you do to make her unconscious?
- No..

881
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,000
Naughty boy!

882
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,080
Ma'am!

883
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
Son-in-law!

884
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,240
Hey, Father-in-law!

885
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,280
Bless me.

886
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,480
Why did you jump over the gate?

887
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,920
Oh, my! I've always
been a jumping jack.

888
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,960
- That reminds me.. Yes?
- Remember this.

889
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,400
When I looked from afar,
it was Alia Bhatt.

890
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,320
Nice.

891
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,200
When I looked from afar,
it was Alia Bhatt.

892
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,800
- When I took a closer look, it was..
- Mahesh Bhatt.

893
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,040
Mahesh Bhatt!

894
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,440
- I see! You're here to meet my daughter.
- Yes.

895
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,680
- Yellow is your favourite colour!
- Yeah.

896
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,160
- I love it.
- Okay.

897
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,320
Follow me!

898
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,680
I would rather go in
here than go to jail.

899
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,880
- Follow me.
- Wait for me, old man.

900
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,920
Who is this baldy?

901
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,960
- Thanks, Prem.
- For making you unconscious?

902
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,280
No, Mom. There was a guy who
tried to act fresh with me.

903
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,880
And Prem beat him up.

904
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,160
- Is it?
- You should have seen it, Mom.

905
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,120
Did I?

906
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,640
Don't be modest. I've seen it.

907
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,880
This calls for a celebration.
Rum, whiskey or vodka?

908
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,360
I don't drink alcohol.

909
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,640
Only milk.

910
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,960
Here I come.. Here
I come with milk.

911
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,920
Here you go, sir. Your
favourite, cow's milk.

912
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,920
You buffalo, if you
want to give milk

913
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,760
go to a milk colony. I can...

914
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,480
I can sniff out my
stuff. Get lost.

915
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,840
Brother-in-law..

916
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,240
He's a wrong number.
He's not Prem.

917
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,200
He's Prem.

918
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,200
Prem drinks milk.
Prem drinks alcohol.

919
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,600
He doesn't drink alcohol
in front of his father.

920
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,800
He pretends to be cultured in front
of his father. It's his values.

921
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,880
Prem is a funny man.

922
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,800
- Say cheers.
- What?

923
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,960
- Say cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers.

924
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,160
This is so good!

925
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,560
Why do I feel high after
drinking this milk?

926
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,280
It's not the milk, it's Samaara.

927
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,120
- Oh, God!
- Ma'am..

928
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,160
Sir, you've got a
really hot daughter.

929
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,200
Wanna come for the 9 to 12 show?

930
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,320
Samaara!

931
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,120
- You're awesome.
- 'Awesome'?

932
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,360
Son-in-law!

933
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,600
Son-in-law, what are you doing?

934
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,520
- Why? Is she your wife?
- No.

935
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,840
Hold on..

936
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,760
Out!

937
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,720
- She's Natalia, our housekeeper.
- Right!

938
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,600
My daughter is upstairs,
in her bedroom.

939
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,160
- Your daughter's upstairs, in the bedroom?
- Yes.

940
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,200
For me? Wow!

941
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,320
- I told you..
- What? That my daughter will fall in love

942
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,560
with a guy in yellow?

943
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,000
- Oh, my! Alishka!
- Hi, my hero!

944
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,520
- Hey, is she your daughter?
- She's my daughter.

945
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,000
Then I've got to ask
her a question.

946
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,440
- Do you live here?
- I do!

947
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,280
- What?
- I do!

948
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,000
- Come again!
- I do!

949
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,320
Wow! Sir!

950
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,400
Your daughter said 'I do'
thrice. Congratulations!

951
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,360
Congratulations!

952
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,480
I'll take you to pretty
shores. I am all yours.

953
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,400
Brother-in-law, he's
the wrong number.

954
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,880
- Why do you keep dialling wrong numbers?
- Hey..

955
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,360
"The building is high!"

956
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,480
"Your lift is not working."

957
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,760
"How do I come?"

958
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,720
"The heart wishes to come."

959
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,240
"The building is high!"

960
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,400
"Your lift is not working."

961
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,600
"How do I come?"

962
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,640
"The heart wishes to come."

963
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,520
"Come.. Come, O' my
king of the sea."

964
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,840
"I miss you. O' my
groom, come now."

965
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,120
"Come.. Come with a band."

966
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,400
"I miss you. O' my
groom, come now."

967
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,040
"How? The building is high!"

968
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,240
"Your lift is not working."

969
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,400
"How do I come?"

970
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,440
"The heart wishes to come."

971
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,120
"How.."

972
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,600
"How.."

973
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,560
"I'll come running for you."

974
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,880
"I'll climb up a
hundred stairs too."

975
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,480
"You are my beloved,
you have to come."

976
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,640
"You have to tolerate
my tantrums."

977
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,920
"You walk ahead and
I'll follow you."

978
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,080
"You attract me like a magnet."

979
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,480
"Where are you going
with your eyes closed?"

980
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,160
"You'll come under
Michael's bicycle."

981
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,200
"You are as far as
you are close."

982
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,360
"You wink at me. What a
strange girl you are."

983
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,400
"A strange girl.."

984
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,720
"What a strange girl you are."

985
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,320
"Oh, come on now.."

986
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,200
"I miss you.."

987
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,200
"Come.. Come, O' my
king of the sea."

988
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,520
"I miss you. O' my
groom, come now."

989
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,360
"How? The building is high!
Your lift is not working."

990
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,640
"How do I come? The
heart wishes to come."

991
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,160
"Come.. Come, O' my
king of the sea."

992
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,560
"I miss you. O' my
groom, come now."

993
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,680
"Come.. Come, O' my
king of the sea."

994
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,160
"I miss you. O' my
groom, come now."

995
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,280
"Come.. Come, O' my
king of the sea."

996
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,960
"I miss you. O' my
groom, come now."

997
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,760
- Beautiful, right?
- I like that.

998
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,560
Look, bro.

999
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,560
Samaara, do you want to watch
the Harry Potter play?

1000
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,520
- Harry Potter?
- I really like..

1001
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,200
Wow, Prem! You've been dancing
and singing these days.

1002
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,678
I even noticed, you
two were holding hands!

1003
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,040
No..

1004
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,760
- Sir, don't physically abuse me.
- Not bad! No..

1005
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,720
- Mr. Rocky..
- No..

1006
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,560
W-We were singing and dancing

1007
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,658
because we were practising
for the music event.

1008
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,360
I see.

1009
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,000
And.. And we were
holding hands because

1010
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,354
I got lost in this college.
She was guiding me.

1011
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:32,280
Stop lying, Prem.

1012
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,040
- Yes, Rocky. We're dating. And having fun.
- No fun.

1013
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,720
And guess what? We've
kissed. You wanna see how?

1014
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,840
N-No, I..

1015
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,168
Why, you..

1016
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,280
He's not scared of any
Tom, Dick or Rocky, okay?

1017
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,960
- What are you saying?
- Oh, come on, Prem.

1018
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,120
I've seen how you bashed up that
guy in the basketball court.

1019
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,108
Which guys?

1020
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,880
Rocky, lay off. Because
if he blows his cool..

1021
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,240
Then what? What will you do?

1022
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,240
- What will you do?
- What will I do? I won't do anything.

1023
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,200
- I won't do anything now.
- He won't do it now.

1024
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,800
He'll do it later. After
the college hours.

1025
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,400
Exactly at 5 p.m.
- I see! - SIM card! - Yo!

1026
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,920
Tell everyone in the college.

1027
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,440
Today, at 5 p.m.

1028
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,200
- Prem will fight with Rocky.
- What? Okay. Fine.

1029
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,440
- SIM card, wait.
- No, she just said it.

1030
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,960
Oh, yes! I have an appointment
with the dentist at 5 p.m.

1031
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,520
- I have a toothache.
- Don't worry.

1032
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,200
After 5 p.m., you
won't have any teeth.

1033
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,200
- He's going to clean your clock at 5 p.m.
- Really?

1034
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,520
- He's going to rip you apart.
- Really?

1035
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,440
You have no idea.

1036
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,908
You know, you're making
such tall claims for him.

1037
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,400
Save me, God.

1038
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,840
Just turn around.

1039
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,560
Rocky-Prem.. It's
a muscle mania.

1040
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,440
You should also come.
It's going to be fun.

1041
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,840
There will be kicking,
punching.. Please join us.

1042
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,800
Come on!

1043
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,200
Today at 5 o'clock! Royal
rumble! Summer slam!

1044
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,120
Come on.

1045
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,440
5 o'clock.. Rocky vs Prem!

1046
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,600
You have a problem, my son?

1047
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,200
Father, I have a
lot of problems.

1048
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,920
Father, there's a
girl I love, but..

1049
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,280
Tell Him!

1050
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,960
God, I have a very
small problem.

1051
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,200
You've performed
so many miracles.

1052
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,680
God, please save me from getting
beaten up at 5 o'clock.

1053
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,920
Please. I can't take
it, I am very weak.

1054
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,000
God, if not for me, at
least for my mom and dad.

1055
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,200
I am their only
son. Please, God!

1056
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,840
Excuse me, excuse me.

1057
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,400
Yes!

1058
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,160
He's here.

1059
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,800
Don't look at me like that,
silly. You'll fall in love.

1060
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,440
- You too.
- Hey!

1061
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,800
- Pepperoni pizza! Your order?
- Yeah. Come.

1062
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,720
Coming through..
Coming through, moron.

1063
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,240
You look really hungry, sir.

1064
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,400
You brought pizza for everyone
because you got scared!

1065
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,520
- Why are you hitting me?
- It's 5 o'clock!

1066
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,280
But I brought it in 30 minutes.

1067
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,680
Hey, you..

1068
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,320
Bless the child.

1069
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,960
You shouldn't have
done that, man.

1070
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,480
This isn't right. Enough!

1071
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,960
I only respect two
things in life.

1072
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,000
Mother and food.

1073
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,560
Because one gives birth to us

1074
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,440
and the other keeps us alive.

1075
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,400
So, young man, I don't need
a reason to bash you up

1076
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,000
but I've found a big emotion.

1077
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,720
Hurry up, I don't have time.

1078
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,960
Oh, my child! Are you okay?

1079
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,240
That hurt, right?

1080
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:57,920
Come on.

1081
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,160
Mister, I always do what I say.

1082
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,360
And what I don't say, I
WhatsApp it! Get up.

1083
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,720
Come on.

1084
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,520
Thank you.. Thank you.

1085
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,320
Hey!

1086
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,080
Good job!

1087
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,240
Don't underestimate the
power of a pizza boy.

1088
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,240
- Pizza boy?
- Yeah!

1089
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,760
"Rocky, you are done for!"

1090
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,000
"You are done for, Rocky!"

1091
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,080
"Rocky, you are done for!"

1092
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,200
"You are done for, Rocky!"

1093
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,400
"Rocky, you are done for!"

1094
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,480
"You are done for, Rocky!"

1095
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,680
"Rocky, you are done for!"

1096
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,800
"You are done for, Rocky!"

1097
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,920
"Rocky, you are done for!"

1098
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,080
"You are done for, Rocky!"

1099
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,200
"Talk of the town,
he is the clown."

1100
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,280
"Check out his state,
all thumbs down."

1101
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,240
"Check him out, sipping
like a killer."

1102
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,600
"Look at his face, it's
all black and blue."

1103
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,160
"It's all black and blue."

1104
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,040
- Oh, Lord!
- You are great!

1105
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,000
- Sorry..
- No, I am sorry..

1106
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,080
- I am sorry. Don't hit me.
- No, I am sorry, sir.

1107
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,240
- Why would I hit you? I won't, sir.
- Don't hit me.

1108
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,680
- I won't hit you, sir.
- Don't hit me. Sorry!

1109
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,640
"One, a Raja, one, a Prem."

1110
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,880
"One, a Raja, one, a Prem."

1111
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,240
Doctor, very strange things
are happening to me.

1112
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,640
I feel like someone's
suddenly controlling my body.

1113
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,600
The other day, I
suddenly kissed a girl.

1114
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,960
- Then, I hit a policeman.
- You did the right thing.

1115
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,960
So, what's the problem?

1116
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,680
- Well..
- What is the problem?

1117
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,560
It would've been a problem

1118
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,320
if you had hit the girl
and kissed the policeman.

1119
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,840
Yuck! So distasteful!

1120
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,080
Relax, my boy! Chill. Relax!

1121
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,400
- Are you tense?
- Yeah.

1122
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,720
- Are you stressed?
- Yes.

1123
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,160
Let me explain. Come with me.

1124
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,920
Come, my boy, come.

1125
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,040
Now, listen to me carefully.

1126
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,640
For split-personality,
multiple disorders

1127
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,240
you don't have any causes
or symptoms. Not at all.

1128
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,680
That means, you're absolutely fine.
You are fit as a fiddle. Go..

1129
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,800
- But, Doctor..
- Buts and ifs.. Oh!

1130
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,320
Let me diagnose you
once and for all. Okay?

1131
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,600
Put that back inside. Did I ask
you to stick your tongue out?

1132
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,920
- No.
- Put it back in.

1133
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,400
Soft as marshmallow!

1134
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,560
You stepped back?

1135
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,840
- You stepped back, didn't you?
- I did.

1136
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,920
- That means, you're all right.
- Okay.

1137
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,480
If you were sick, you
would've broken my jaw.

1138
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,400
Like this.

1139
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,998
See, you stepped back again.
So, you're perfectly all right.

1140
01:06:59,010 --> 01:06:59,880
Yes

1141
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,680
- I don't get it.
- Okay, it's all done. Thank you.

1142
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,120
I went over to deliver pizzas.

1143
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,280
I didn't even know the
guy, or crossed his path..

1144
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,960
The bloody buffoon started
throwing punches at me.

1145
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,360
- Oh, God! Does that hurt?
- Yes, don't do it.

1146
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,320
- I just want to know if it hurts.
- Stop touching.

1147
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,188
Well, I only want to
know if it's paining.

1148
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:15,800
Nandu!

1149
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,400
- Sorry, sorry, I didn't intend to.
- You're lying. You hit me.

1150
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,800
No.. - Don't come any closer. Don't
come any closer. I will jump.

1151
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,080
Doctor, please help me.

1152
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,240
- What please?
- I need help.

1153
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,288
Doctor..

1154
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,360
Get out! You don't have a
disorder, you're out of order.

1155
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,800
Bloody hell, he hit me.

1156
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,120
- Doctor, I am very unwell!
- Hey..

1157
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,800
I need help. I am going crazy.

1158
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,080
- Please check me, Doctor.
- I'll jump!

1159
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,480
- Please, Doctor..
- One, two, three..

1160
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,960
I am safe!

1161
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,960
'Malhotra? Charles.'

1162
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,200
'Soon, I'll be out of jail.'

1163
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,240
'And then, I won't spare
you and your family.'

1164
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,520
'I know you're going to say..'

1165
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,920
'This is between us, Charles.
Leave my family out of this.'

1166
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,240
And the usual blah, blah..

1167
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,560
Look, Raja! Accident..

1168
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,480
Hold it..

1169
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,600
Go and take a look.

1170
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,080
- Raja.
- Yes? This is just like the scene

1171
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,960
in 'Three Idiots'. I am scared.

1172
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,680
Nandu, when Lord Ganesha is
there, no harm can come to him.

1173
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,240
- Hail Lord Ganesha..
- Hail!

1174
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,520
You'll be fine, keep breathing.

1175
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,000
Prem!

1176
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,880
- Doctor, excuse me.
- Yes?

1177
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,920
- Where is the ICU, please?
- Go to the second floor.

1178
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,520
Prem!

1179
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,640
- This is a hospital?
- Yes.

1180
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,720
How is he? How did this happen?

1181
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,320
Don't worry, he's fine.

1182
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,520
- All of a sudden..
- Don't cry.

1183
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,320
Trust me, he's fine. Please..

1184
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,560
Son!

1185
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,280
He'll be fine.

1186
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,040
He'll be absolutely fine.

1187
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,000
- But, where is he?
- He's in there, room 202.

1188
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,000
What happened, Raja?
Why are you crying?

1189
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,680
If only my mother was alive, she
would've hugged me like this.

1190
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,240
Family is such an amazing thing.

1191
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,080
Even the richest man in the world
is a pauper without a family.

1192
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,520
You're right, Raja.
But don't worry.

1193
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,760
I am your family.

1194
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:25,520
- You make me puke.
- Hopeless life.

1195
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,080
- Come on.
- Come.

1196
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,960
- Who is calling?
- Let me answer first.

1197
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,880
Tell him you're in a hospital
and that it's an emergency.

1198
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,760
Nandu!

1199
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,680
- Hey..
- Hey, Alex.. Alex..

1200
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,320
- Let go of Raja. Let go!
- Come on, Alex.

1201
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,720
Alex, let go of these
hapless chaps.

1202
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,160
Relax. Relax.

1203
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,400
- Alex, relax..
- Okay, Doctor.

1204
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,040
I'm not the doctor,
I am your uncle.

1205
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,760
I'm your uncle.

1206
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,120
Sorry. Sorry, dear.

1207
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,000
He keeps doing these
absurd things.

1208
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,840
Someone smashed a
coconut on his head

1209
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,920
- and he lost his memory.
- Wow!

1210
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,600
Hey, you stammering fool!
Why did you say that?

1211
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,560
B-By mistake..

1212
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,118
He has lost his memory
and you think it's funny.

1213
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:26,640
No..

1214
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,920
He was being sarcastic. He meant
to say, the guy is truly unlucky.

1215
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,840
- Nandu..
- Hey..

1216
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,360
Sorry.

1217
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,680
- He has lost his memory.
- Like the actor in 'Ghajini'?

1218
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,200
- God..
- Uncle.

1219
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,160
- I mean, can I address you as 'uncle'?
- Yes.

1220
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,960
- No one can change destiny.
- Yes.

1221
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,600
He has forgotten everything.
You should forget it too.

1222
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,120
- No!
- Why?

1223
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,800
- We'll never forget this.
- But..

1224
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,080
What does the doctor say?

1225
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,600
I mean, what are the chances
of him regaining his memory?

1226
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,320
He can regain his
memory in 10 minutes.

1227
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,280
10 minutes?

1228
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,040
Come, let's go.

1229
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,520
This is the Italian Collection.

1230
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,520
- This is the Arabic Collection..
- Oh.

1231
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,880
And this is our latest
Gold Collection.

1232
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,760
Also known as the
Baahubali Collection.

1233
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,440
So many gold ornaments.

1234
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,480
"Gold.."
- Mom..

1235
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,960
- Does this shop belong to Bappi Lahiri?
- Mom?

1236
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,560
Oh, I am just joking..

1237
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,560
- Prem.. How is this?
- Lovely.

1238
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,400
- Nice, right?
- It will suit you.

1239
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,720
Then what are you gawking at?

1240
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,400
- Go and make the payment.
- Mom, let it be..

1241
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,080
Anyway, it's a little
big for me. It's okay.

1242
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,920
If you can grow from a little
child to a tall, lovely lass

1243
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,280
- we can definitely make this smaller.
- Mom..

1244
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,320
- How much?
- 18,000 Pounds.

1245
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:51,240
- Sir, including making charges.
- Is that all?

1246
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,960
Pay them.

1247
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,920
- Beautiful.
- Very nice.. Say thank you.

1248
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,040
What's Raja doing here?

1249
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,560
- Aren't you Mr. Rajeev Malhotra's son?
- Yes.

1250
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,600
- Prem. Prem Malhotra.
- I-It's a pleasure, sir.

1251
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,360
Sir.

1252
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,400
Which way do I go?

1253
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,720
- Actually, my debit card is..
- We'll look into the payment.

1254
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,120
Mr. Goldie. - Yes?
- Get the ring altered. - Sir.

1255
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,680
Take the ring to get it altered.

1256
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,520
Raja, what are you doing here?
I noticed you from the window.

1257
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,120
Sorry, I don't know you.

1258
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,960
You don't know me?

1259
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,600
I am your friend, Nandu,
you're my friend, Raja.

1260
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,920
Who's Nandu? Who's Raja?

1261
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,440
- I don't know this man.
- Wait a minute.

1262
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,400
Just wait.

1263
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,120
- I think this boy's crazy.
- Yes. Get out.

1264
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,640
- Get out. S-She's throwing me out.
- What?

1265
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,600
I mean, she's asking me to
leave. And you're doing nothing.

1266
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,680
I see.. Just because you
found a girl and an old lady

1267
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,920
you forgot all about
your old friend.

1268
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,520
Don't you dare! Don't you
dare call my daughter old!

1269
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,640
Mom. - I didn't call
her an old lady.

1270
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,560
- I was referring to you.
- Oh, my God.

1271
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,800
- You lunatic! Rascal!
- Ma'am, please.

1272
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,440
- Ma'am..
- I am going to solve it.

1273
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,028
You idiot!

1274
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,600
This is wrong.. Please
escort this man outside.

1275
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,120
- Right away, sir..
- He's getting violent.

1276
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,200
Right away, sir! - Yes.
- Listen to me, mister. - Mom..

1277
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,000
- Come here.
- Be gentle.. Thrash him.

1278
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,920
- I don't like this.
- Look here.

1279
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,880
- Show her a ring too..
- Take a look at this..

1280
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,880
- Show her a ring too.
- Here you go..

1281
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,680
- Make her wear it.
- I-I like this one. Sure.

1282
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,640
Wear this ring.

1283
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,760
No, I want a bigger ring.

1284
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,240
What are you staring at?

1285
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,280
I dare you to say that
you don't know me.

1286
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,600
And that you don't work
as a pizza delivery boy

1287
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,560
- at my restaurant.
- But I don't, sir.

1288
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,520
Yes, he doesn't.

1289
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,098
Freaky, fanatic, foolish,
Fahrenheit fish! What?

1290
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:27,960
What?

1291
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,480
Yes. No matter how many 'F' words
I use, they aren't enough.

1292
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,280
- Who is he? Throw him out.
- I don't know.

1293
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,520
- Raja, I am Sharafat.
- I don't know you. Sir..

1294
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,320
Raja, I'm Sharafat.

1295
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,480
- I don't know you.
- This isn't right.

1296
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,960
He is getting emotional.
Why are you crying?

1297
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,120
- Raja, you forgot your friends..
- Oh, no..

1298
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,760
And you ask why I'm crying?

1299
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,480
- Guys, please.
- Don't do this, Raja.

1300
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,600
Take some money, please.

1301
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,960
- Hey..
- Come on.. Out you go.

1302
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,320
- Hey.. Get out..
- Don't!

1303
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,760
Both the father and the
son are frauds, get out!

1304
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,280
- Hey..
- Out of my shop. Out!

1305
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,680
- Flabbergasted food-poisoning fungus.
- What?

1306
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,560
I've never been so
embarrassed before.

1307
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,880
You're absolutely
right, Mr. Sharafat.

1308
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,080
I used to wash his dirty
underwear when we were kids.

1309
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,320
And today, he broke
our friendship.

1310
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,240
- What?
- He broke our friendship.

1311
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,418
What?

1312
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,880
Broke our friendship!
I see. Speak clearly.

1313
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,960
I feel burdened. Let
me go relieve myself.

1314
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,720
I am really restless.

1315
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,960
Raja, it's Valentine's
Day today.

1316
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,040
Fool.

1317
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,000
He keeps changing his girlfriends
along with his clothes.

1318
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,040
Then I must buy you a gift.

1319
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,200
But money..

1320
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,240
- What happened?
- Come on. You want a gift, don't you?

1321
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,240
- Come on..
- What is it?

1322
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,680
- Mr. Sharafat.
- I see. So, finally, you've recognised me.

1323
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,600
Of course.

1324
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,520
I can forget myself,
but not you.

1325
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,640
- Godfather.
- Hi.

1326
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,120
Alishka, he's the reason
I am still in London.

1327
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,200
Get lost!

1328
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,840
Fraud! Cheat! You humiliated me,
and now you crack jokes on me.

1329
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,440
- What?
- You're fired.

1330
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,480
- But Mr. Sharafat..
- Quiet.

1331
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,440
- What did I do?
- Shut up.

1332
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,320
- At least tell me..
- You are fired.

1333
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,160
Let's go. Come on.

1334
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,840
- Come on!
- Fine.

1335
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,640
My mother used to say..

1336
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,800
'The world is made of brass'

1337
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,040
'and I am a baby
doll made of gold.'

1338
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,320
"I am a baby doll made of gold."
- What?

1339
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,800
I mean, she only looks okay

1340
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,000
- but she's not okay.
- Is she fake?

1341
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:21,960
Yes.

1342
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,628
Just last week, Alishka
got a Botox injected.

1343
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,480
I see.

1344
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,400
- This is just make-up.
- Make-up?

1345
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,200
There's powder on her face.

1346
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,280
So much powder that we
can play carom with it.

1347
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,440
She's completely
shaken. Poor girl!

1348
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,000
She's done for, and
I can't handle it.

1349
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,680
The doctor said that she must
get a surgery done immediately.

1350
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,160
But a jobless man like me,
who doesn't have money..

1351
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,920
"The world is.."
- Yes, I have my phone in my pocket.

1352
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,080
- Look. Wajid Khan is calling.
- What?

1353
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,640
Dr. Wajid Khan, he's
a renowned surgeon.

1354
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,760
What do I tell him?

1355
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,800
Tell him, or else, she will get
Botox injected again. Tell him.

1356
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,520
- I..
- What is it?

1357
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,360
Yes.. - This is my credit card.
- Okay. - My debit card.. - Okay.

1358
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,920
- An extra card..
- Give me some money.

1359
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:03,738
But..

1360
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,640
Give me. We are youngsters.
Okay, take it..

1361
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,720
- Get her treated.
- I will. And return to work.

1362
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,120
- You still have your job.
- Thank you.

1363
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,240
One minute..

1364
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,360
You mean, the other day,
you made up that story

1365
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,760
about your mother and kissed me.

1366
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,880
- That reminds me..
- What?

1367
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,480
Oh, my!

1368
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,440
It's the girl from the store.
She's in the same position.

1369
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,720
Stop it, dear.

1370
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,440
How many times
will you kiss him?

1371
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,360
You pervert! Haven't you ever
seen anyone kissing before?

1372
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,440
Pervert.

1373
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,800
Oh, I am doing my job,
keeping an eye on people.

1374
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,880
Does she think I'm a pervert?

1375
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,840
Scoundrel!

1376
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,680
- Sir.
- Yes, Goldie.

1377
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,920
Look over there.

1378
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,120
"My first love.."

1379
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,680
Sir. "It's the first time.."

1380
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,680
- That boy really loves her a lot.
- Sir.

1381
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,640
- Did you get the ring altered, Goldie?
- Sir, it's ready.

1382
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:11,840
For how long are you
going to stare, sir?

1383
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,920
Come, sir.

1384
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,160
Excuse me? - Yes?
- Your ring has been altered. - Yes.

1385
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,320
- No!
- No.. No!

1386
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,600
- No?
- I love it.

1387
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,440
I love it, Raja.

1388
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,960
You're such a charmer, just
like Akshay Kumar in 'Rustom'.

1389
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,360
It's a surprise for me.

1390
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,920
It's a surprise for me as well.

1391
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,280
- Sir, it's a surprise for us as well.
- I love it!

1392
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,760
Why are you giving
this ring to me?

1393
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,120
This is your ring

1394
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,840
but are you sure that you
want to give it to her?

1395
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,440
Would you like me to give it to
your sister who's a spinster?

1396
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,960
Tell me the price.

1397
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,040
- 18,000 Pounds.
- Sir, including making charges.

1398
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,880
You look like an oversized
balloon! I'll deflate you.

1399
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,040
Tell me the price of this
ring, not your shop.

1400
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,080
It's the price of the ring.

1401
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,800
You know what? Take the ring.
We'll collect the payment later.

1402
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,240
- You mean, I can take it?
- Yes. Yes.

1403
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,520
- Do I really look so decent? Alishka.
- Yes.

1404
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,680
- You got your ring, didn't you?
- Yes.

1405
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,120
Let's play ring-a-ring o' roses.

1406
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:04,560
Very funny. I'm taking you to meet
the guy who gave you the ring.

1407
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,520
Dad, you won't find him here.

1408
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,280
- Look at him. You mean, my love!
- Yes.

1409
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,440
"My love.. My beloved,
you're my love."

1410
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,920
- Go for him.
- Okay.

1411
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,960
So sweet! That's my daughter.

1412
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,760
Hi.

1413
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,360
Oh, my God. You're too good.

1414
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,600
First, the fake dad!

1415
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,800
And now, you're pretending
to be a student. Nice touch.

1416
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,320
- Have you lost your mind?
- Oh! And stop touching me.

1417
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,040
Just leave me alone.
Shoo! - 'Shoo'?

1418
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,280
- Shoo?
- Shoo!

1419
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,960
- Shoo! Shoo!
- Shoo!

1420
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,360
Okay, listen, stop acting now.

1421
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,640
Dad's here, and so am I. We
have come to take you with us.

1422
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,480
They will fix our wedding date.

1423
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,720
Wedding? I don't even
know you, ma'am.

1424
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,320
- Why would I marry you?
- What?

1425
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,680
Oh! So, you don't know me?

1426
01:21:58,760 --> 01:21:59,640
No.

1427
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:04,960
- So, why did you give me this ring?
- Who gave you this ring?

1428
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,480
I had bought this
ring for Samaara..

1429
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,640
- Hey! You gave it to me.
- Me?

1430
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,040
What's wrong with you?
Have you lost it?

1431
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,480
- You forgot about the ring.
- What?

1432
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,360
- Did you forget the kiss as well?
- What?

1433
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,560
We kissed for almost a minute.

1434
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,840
When did you kiss my daughter?

1435
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,160
No.. - Forget when he
kissed her, Brother-in-law.

1436
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,040
- He kissed her for a minute.
- Please..

1437
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,240
Who said that you can kiss her?

1438
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,400
Dad, when it came to
making a commitment

1439
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,040
he's backing out. You know
what, take your stupid ring!

1440
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,280
- Let's go, Dad.
- Okay. But..

1441
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,800
- You kissed her for a minute!
- Hold on.

1442
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,160
- Did you forget?
- No, I..You drank my single malt whiskey.

1443
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,080
- Never.
- And danced to..

1444
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,360
What was that song? - "The
building's too tall."

1445
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,280
- "The building's high.
- And the lift"

1446
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,200
- "is not working.
- And the lift is not working."

1447
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,400
Did you do it or not?

1448
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,040
- I didn't do it.
- You didn't?

1449
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,120
- You are a cheater.
- He's lying.

1450
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,000
- You are a cheater.
- But.. You are a cheater.

1451
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,040
Don't do that.

1452
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,000
You are a cheater.

1453
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,120
- Your lift isn't working.
- Which lift?

1454
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,520
I.. I don't..

1455
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,120
You bought this ring
for me, didn't you?

1456
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,440
- But you gave it to her.
- Samaara..

1457
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,480
- You kissed her!
- No, they are lying. I..

1458
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,000
I see. So, this one's
for your true love.

1459
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,760
I haven't done anything
like they say. I swear..

1460
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,880
It's a serious case
of bipolar disorder.

1461
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,960
In such cases, the patient
has suicidal tendency.

1462
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,400
Doctor.

1463
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,760
- The meeting is over.
- What about the patient?

1464
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,720
Let him die.

1465
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,600
Doctor. Doctor, I went
over to your clinic.

1466
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,840
But they told me that
I can find you here.

1467
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,760
Doctor, please.
Doctor, hear me out.

1468
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,280
Hello, Alishka. I've been
calling you for so long.

1469
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,600
It's over between us. Don't
call me up again, Raja.

1470
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,720
It's over.

1471
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,480
Hey, Alishka! Hello..

1472
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,320
She changed her tone once
I gave her the ring.

1473
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,880
Hey, give me your phone.

1474
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,040
Hey, you! I'm in a
bad mood right now.

1475
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,920
My girlfriend has annoyed
me. I'll bang you up.

1476
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,000
Get lost.

1477
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,200
The last time, you behaved
like a complete madman.

1478
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,840
- I won't listen to you now.
- Doctor.

1479
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,880
Yours is a noble profession. For
the sake of your profession

1480
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,880
please help me.

1481
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,600
- Give me your fricking phone, I say.
- You think you're too smart.

1482
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,800
Oh, no.

1483
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,320
Do you want my phone?
Do you want my phone?

1484
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,400
Take it..

1485
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,218
Oh! Sorry, Doctor..What have
I done to you, you madman?

1486
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,200
Oh..

1487
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,080
I'm sorry, Doctor..

1488
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,840
Hey, Indian, it's not over.

1489
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:59,680
Gayle, Bravo, Pollock, Daren.

1490
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,720
- Easy..
- Hey..

1491
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,320
O-Okay..

1492
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,640
Oh, God! You've got the
entire West Indies team.

1493
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Oh.. Easy, man..

1494
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,280
You all are champions, man.

1495
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,680
- He's a champion. You're a champion.
- Champion.

1496
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,920
- "Everybody is a champion.
- Everybody is a champion."

1497
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,628
"Gayle is a champion,
Bravo is a champion.

1498
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,160
Champion.."

1499
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,320
- "Daren is a champion.
- Champion."

1500
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,320
- "Champion!
- Champion!"

1501
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,000
DJ..
- DJ. - Bravo.. - Bravo!

1502
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,200
DJ..
- DJ. - Bravo.. - Bravo!

1503
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,600
- I like your shirt.
- You like the shirt. Yes.

1504
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,560
Okay.. Take it..

1505
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,360
It's yours now, wear
it. You may keep it..

1506
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,080
- Hey, I like your shoes..
- You want my shoes, man?

1507
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,440
- Okay, keep the shoes..
- You take mine.

1508
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,920
- Take it.
- Give me the trousers.

1509
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,480
You like the trousers,
man? Okay, no problem.

1510
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,320
You take it. Keep it..
Take it. Keep it, man.

1511
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,240
Oh, you take this vest.
It's of good quality.

1512
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,120
- Take everything. It's yours, man..
- Spicy.

1513
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,560
Okay, peace, man! Bob Marley.

1514
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,400
- Hold on.. Now, I like those boxers.
- Yes.

1515
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,560
- Yes.. Yes..
- Come on..

1516
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,800
First, you lock horns

1517
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,080
next, you want to strip
me of my clothes.

1518
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,560
No, man!

1519
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,600
Catch him.

1520
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,880
- Why don't you go home, man?
- Let's go, let's get him, man.

1521
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,680
Hey!

1522
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,440
My shirt was ironed.
You just ruined it.

1523
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,880
- These pants cost 20 Pounds, silly!
- Hey!

1524
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,160
Nice shoes, right?
They are mine.

1525
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,640
Oh, my God! Shit, man. I mean,
we've got the same face.

1526
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,600
We've got the same
fricking face.

1527
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,920
- We look identical!
- Holy Mother of Jesus.

1528
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,440
- Lord Ganesha!
- This is a miracle.

1529
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,680
- What? This is a miracle..
- Hey!

1530
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,800
- Oh, no! Somebody..
- Stop dancing. Come here.

1531
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,960
- I-I need a picture.
- Don't click my picture. Have you lost it?

1532
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,640
I need to tell my mom.

1533
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,160
We just look the same.

1534
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,880
- We look the same..
- Why are you calling your mom up?

1535
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,480
Where are you from? Who are you?

1536
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,120
What is your name, sir?

1537
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,440
I mean, we just.. You..

1538
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,800
- What are you looking at?
- No.. I was just..

1539
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,840
Tell me something, stupid. Did
your mom ever come to Mumbai?

1540
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,200
No!

1541
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,760
Did your dad ever
come to London?

1542
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,400
Stupid.

1543
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:18,440
Now, I understand why Rocky
attacked me in college.

1544
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,680
Yes. And why Inspector Dhillon
was trying to arrest me.

1545
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,200
And why Alishka's father
offered me milk..

1546
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,280
I understand now

1547
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,400
why Samaara and your girlfriend
threw the ring at me.

1548
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,920
Look, take my advice, this is a
fine mess we've gotten into.

1549
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,800
Tell Alishka's father that
you and I are identical.

1550
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,680
Then he will never let
you marry Alishka.

1551
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:40,960
Why?

1552
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,240
Because they think I
am Prem, not you.

1553
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,440
- And if I tell him the truth..
- You're clever.

1554
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,480
- Yes.
- You've got a point. Come on. Yes.

1555
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,520
But we must tell
our girlfriends.

1556
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,640
Yes, Raja. If Samaara
can't be mine

1557
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,080
- I won't let anyone have her.
- I see.

1558
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,000
So, if she becomes yours,
you'll let anyone have her?

1559
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:02,520
No.. That's not what I meant.

1560
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,840
But what do I do now?
Samaara is very angry.

1561
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,720
And I am scared to face her.

1562
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,400
Coward.

1563
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,560
You know what, you pretend
to be Raja and get Alishka.

1564
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,640
And I'll pretend to be
Prem and get Samaara.

1565
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,240
Listen, stay away
from my girlfriend.

1566
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,200
- She tends to get close.
- Yes, you're right.

1567
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,560
- She does get close.
- Yes.

1568
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,120
- Can I go?
- Yes, go on.

1569
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,080
- Are you sure I can go?
- Go on.

1570
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,680
I won't if you don't want me to.

1571
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,640
Will you leave or shall I
whack you on the head?

1572
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,840
- Okay.. Don't be violent.
- Crazy guy.

1573
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,640
Ms. Alishka. Ms. Alishka.

1574
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,520
- Oh, good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1575
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,520
How dare you enter my house!

1576
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,120
L-Look, I know you're
very upset with me.

1577
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,120
But please give me a
chance to explain.

1578
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,160
- I said, get out!
- Don't be so rude, dear.

1579
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,560
Come closer.

1580
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,320
I admit, if you look from afar,
he looks like dried broccoli.

1581
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,600
I admit, if you look from afar,
he looks like dried broccoli.

1582
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,438
But, take a closer look,
he's no less than Baahubali.

1583
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,360
Very funny.

1584
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,560
Dad, don't interfere.

1585
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,000
Don't say that. First,
ask him why he is here.

1586
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,000
What's he here to say?

1587
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,200
- You're here to apologise, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

1588
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,480
- You regret it, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

1589
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,668
You want to tell her
that you love her, right?

1590
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,360
Yes, sir.

1591
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,880
Then say it.

1592
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,400
You're saying all that, Dad.
He's only saying 'yes, sir'.

1593
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,680
Are you listening to what
she's saying? I mean..

1594
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,840
- Go over there and tell her.
- Okay.

1595
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,600
- Ms. Alishka.
- Stop being so formal.

1596
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,800
Look, the one you
love, loves you too.

1597
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,542
Do you love me?

1598
01:30:53,554 --> 01:30:56,080
If he's your lover,
he's bound to love you.

1599
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:59,000
- Will you marry me?
- He loves you, and he'll marry you too.

1600
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,080
- Are these flowers for me?
- These are for you.

1601
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,240
Yes. I've brought fresh flowers.

1602
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,280
Brother-in-law.

1603
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,040
Brother-in-law, he's
talking indirectly.

1604
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,080
He doesn't seem right..

1605
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,280
Brother-in-law..

1606
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,040
Anybody home? Raja's here.

1607
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,000
I mean, the prince of
your dreams, Prem's here.

1608
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,960
- What prince?
- She's Samaara?

1609
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,840
Are you back to break
the heart again?

1610
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,680
That rascal didn't take a
look at her age or her waist.

1611
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,160
What are you looking at?
What do you have to say now?

1612
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,920
All I want to say is..

1613
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,920
I admit that you've
completely withered.

1614
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,400
But even a jalopy gives a
few kicks before starting.

1615
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,960
I admit that the fairness of your
arms have rubbed on to your hair.

1616
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,680
But keep your chin up.

1617
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,760
I admit that your
teeth are shaking.

1618
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,920
But an elephant's tusk is used
to make ornaments, Senorita.

1619
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,520
- Mom!
- Oh, my!

1620
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,000
Ma'am..

1621
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,920
Just repeat everything I
said to Samaara, for me.

1622
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,040
Mom, please ask him to get out.

1623
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,760
He.. - Yes, I'll leave. But,
only after I speak the truth.

1624
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,800
What truth?

1625
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,600
My mother used to say..

1626
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,400
'Live your life to the fullest.'

1627
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,040
'Who knows whether we will
be alive tomorrow or not!"

1628
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:43,000
- What? What do you mean?
- I mean, that girl is suffering.

1629
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,960
From an identity crisis!

1630
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,120
- Identity crisis?
- Yes, it's a medical condition.

1631
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,498
A medical condition.
She's like a sister to me.

1632
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,280
Oh.

1633
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,360
But, whenever she
experiences an episode

1634
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,720
she starts calling
me 'sweetheart'.

1635
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,880
Yesterday, she addressed
her dog as 'Dad'.

1636
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,920
And do you know how she
addressed her dad?

1637
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,360
'Tommy, come. Stay. Stay.'

1638
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:08,040
- Identity crisis.
- "Live each moment.."

1639
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,720
Look, it's her. I've saved
her name as 'sister'

1640
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:11,640
on my phone.

1641
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,640
What do I tell her
now? You say..

1642
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,440
You mean, she..

1643
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,960
- She's like your sister.
- Yes.

1644
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:21,120
- And you really love me..
- Yes.

1645
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,440
- You and I.. I and you.. Come.
- Oh!

1646
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,758
Ma'am, is it okay if
I carry her like this?

1647
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,520
Look.

1648
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,840
You made an entry like
this several times.

1649
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:34,280
- Now, you can make an exit like this too.
- You're funny.

1650
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:38,160
- Can I take your car?
- Go on.. It's all yours.

1651
01:33:55,200 --> 01:34:00,040
Brother-in-law, he's the
wrong one. I'm warning you..

1652
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,480
"Listen, baby, your
walk is deadly."

1653
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,160
"You move your hips elegantly."

1654
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:17,280
"Listen, baby, your walk is deadly.
You move your hips elegantly."

1655
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:22,000
"Listen, baby, your walk is deadly.
You move your hips elegantly."

1656
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:27,080
"My heart yearns to keep
looking at you. Meet my gaze."

1657
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:31,320
"I have given you my heart. I am
ready to lay down my life too."

1658
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,440
"Just come to me once."

1659
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,080
"I have given you my heart. I'm
ready to lay down my life too."

1660
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,120
"Just come to me once."

1661
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,760
"I have given you my heart. I'm
ready to lay down my life too."

1662
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,200
"Meet my gaze. Just
come to me once."

1663
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,960
"When are you going to
talk to my parents?"

1664
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,120
"When will you arrive
at my doorstep"

1665
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:14,280
"with a wedding procession?"

1666
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,960
"When are you going to
talk to my parents?"

1667
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,040
"When will you arrive
at my doorstep"

1668
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,040
"with a wedding procession?"

1669
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:23,840
"For how long will you keep
courting me? Lead me to the altar."

1670
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:28,360
"I have given you my heart. I'm
ready to lay down my life too.."

1671
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,440
"Just come.."

1672
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,160
"Just come to me once."

1673
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,480
"I have given you my heart. I am
ready to lay down my life too."

1674
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,480
"Just come to me once."

1675
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,200
"I have given you my heart. I am
ready to lay down my life too."

1676
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:44,840
"Meet my gaze. Just
come to me once."

1677
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:49,440
"Oh, baby, I just want to tell you.
If I get a chance to love you.."

1678
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:54,160
"You stole my heart. Your
eyes gave you away."

1679
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:59,080
"Oh, baby, I just want to tell you.
If I get a chance to love you.."

1680
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,600
"You stole my heart."

1681
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:05,920
- "Your eyes gave you away.
- I want to spend my life with you."

1682
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,200
"When you try to hit on me"

1683
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,400
"I can't raise my eyebrows,
feeling coquettish."

1684
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:16,240
"When you hold my wrist, my
heartbeat starts fluctuating."

1685
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,600
"When you try to hit on me"

1686
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,760
"I can't raise my eyebrows,
feeling coquettish."

1687
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,680
"When you hold my wrist, my
heartbeat starts fluctuating."

1688
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,920
"Hey, I'm attached
to you, girl."

1689
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,240
"I'll even get our
horoscopes matched."

1690
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,880
"Hey, I'm attached
to you, girl."

1691
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,000
"I'll even get our
horoscopes matched."

1692
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:39,880
"I'll make you my wife soon.
Be in the right mood."

1693
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,360
"I have given you my heart. I am
ready to lay down my life too."

1694
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,320
"Just come to me once."

1695
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,040
"I have given you my heart. I am
ready to lay down my life too."

1696
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,000
"Just come to me once."

1697
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,800
"I have given you my heart. I am
ready to lay down my life too."

1698
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:59,600
"Meet my gaze. Just
come to me once."

1699
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:04,240
"Just once.."

1700
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,720
"Just once.."

1701
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:12,920
- Prem.
- Raja. "Come to me.."

1702
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,760
- Prem.
- Raja.

1703
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,200
You idiot, I sent
you to get Alishka.

1704
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,760
Why did you bring her
father and her uncle along?

1705
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,600
No, I didn't bring them here.

1706
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,760
Raja. What are you doing, Raja?

1707
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,240
- Raja, open the door.
- Who is it?

1708
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:33,320
What do you mean?
It must be Alishka.

1709
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,160
- Go, open the door.
- Raja, open the door, fast.

1710
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,240
No, I won't.. You open the door.

1711
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,840
Will you open the door or
shall I throw a punch at you?

1712
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,720
Please don't push me.

1713
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,800
Raja.. Open the door.

1714
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,760
Raja, why did you take so long?

1715
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,480
And I heard two voices.
What was that all about?

1716
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,760
Actually, my voice
echoed across the room.

1717
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,200
Look.. Alishka!

1718
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,800
Alishka..

1719
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,480
That's so cool.

1720
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,680
Oh, wow!

1721
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,600
Such a beautiful Jacuzzi.
Let's bathe together.

1722
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,360
Oh, Jesus, doing all this before
getting married is a sin.

1723
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,280
No.. - You're going to bathe
with me one way or another.

1724
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,440
- Show me those sexy abs.
- I'll take the pants off.

1725
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,880
Okay, fine. I'll go change.

1726
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,600
Naughty.

1727
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,080
It's a sin.

1728
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,080
What? Hey!

1729
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,040
- Hey..
- What are you doing?

1730
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,640
Brother-in-law.. Whatever is
going on inside is not right..

1731
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,048
My daughter's inside. Yes.
And her fiance is there.

1732
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:40,520
Yes.

1733
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,920
Is it right to see them
in this condition?

1734
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:42,960
- But, Brother-in-law..
- Does it feel right?

1735
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,280
- But, Brother-in-law. Does it feel right?
- But, Brother-in-law..

1736
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,360
- Let's go.
- Brother-in-law.

1737
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,840
Dimwit! What are you doing?

1738
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,560
- Alishka wants me to bathe with her..
- Okay.

1739
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,120
- Can I bathe with her?
- I see.

1740
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,698
If she tells you to jump
into the well, will you?

1741
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:58,560
Yes.

1742
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,560
No.. - Come on, get
inside the water.

1743
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,400
- Raja..
- Drown. Yes.

1744
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:07,400
Raja, listen. I heard
two voices again.

1745
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,520
Darling, you've got
such sharp ears.

1746
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,920
People are hard of hearing,
but you hear very well.

1747
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,920
And, why did you wear
your clothes again?

1748
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,040
- I was feeling shy.
- But if you say, I'll take these off too.

1749
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,880
- Go and change.
- I'll rap as I go.

1750
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,680
"Despacito.. Countrymen.."

1751
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,320
What happened?

1752
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,680
Raja, you were there
a minute ago.

1753
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,720
How did you take your
clothes off so soon?

1754
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,676
I-I was really eager
to bathe with you. What?

1755
01:39:38,688 --> 01:39:39,880
So I did it quickly.

1756
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:44,160
- No.. I am confused.
- Me too.

1757
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,240
- Silly.
- Billy.

1758
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,880
Hey!

1759
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,320
What's wrong with you?
Why are you screaming?

1760
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,800
Relax. You're blinded by love. So,
you're seeing two things at once!

1761
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,840
- Come, my darling, come on.
- What?

1762
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,560
- Come. I love you..
- No. I love you.

1763
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,928
Fool, I'll hit you so hard
that you'll dirty the water.

1764
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:05,640
Oh.

1765
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,560
Leave.

1766
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,320
- Did you say something?
- Your ears are ringing.

1767
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,080
Silly.

1768
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,040
Come on, that's enough.

1769
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,160
Did you have fun?

1770
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:20,240
I took a bath after a month,
so, it was obviously fun.

1771
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,120
I'll go change.

1772
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,040
You were in the Jacuzzi with me.

1773
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,320
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

1774
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:34,400
I see. You walked, is it?

1775
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,080
Prem!

1776
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,640
Prem!

1777
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,480
- Prem, what are you doing here with her?
- We were bathing.

1778
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,560
- Bathing..
- Yes.

1779
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,120
- You love me and bathe with her!
- I'll bathe with you too.

1780
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,720
Raja, what nonsense is this!

1781
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,040
Raja? He's not Raja, he's Prem.

1782
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,360
He's not Prem. He's
my lover, Raja.

1783
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,600
- Prem, who is Raja? I..
- No, tell me.

1784
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,920
Who is Prem, Raja?

1785
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,200
- I'm.. No, tell me.
- Raja.

1786
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,520
- You came to my house.
- I.. Cheater. I knew it.

1787
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,440
- You were cheating on me.
- Wait..

1788
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,040
Prem, tell me..

1789
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,280
- No, I am not.
- Tell me.

1790
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,520
Raja, please help me.

1791
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,800
- Help me, Raja.
- Hello, ladies.

1792
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,400
Help me.

1793
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,440
We are twins.

1794
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,160
"Twins."

1795
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,560
Raja..

1796
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:31,760
Oh.

1797
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,200
Nandu, he looks just like me.

1798
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,920
- In fact, he's my twin.
- What are you saying, Raja?

1799
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:39,600
You mean, the guy who threw me out
of the shop that day wasn't you?

1800
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,680
- No. That was Prem.
- Yes.

1801
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,160
- Raja, are you joking?
- No, Nandu.

1802
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,560
You don't know. Seven people in
the world look exactly the same.

1803
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:51,040
- I think that idiot is my lookalike.
- Hey!

1804
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,360
- Hey!
- They are just kids.

1805
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,668
Kids! Then why are they
behaving like adults?

1806
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,400
Sorry, sir.

1807
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:58,960
Nonsense!

1808
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,280
Raja!

1809
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,360
Does that mean there will be six
more people who look like me?

1810
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,258
Of course.. But they
won't be dimwits like you.

1811
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:05,880
Nandu.

1812
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,120
Hey!

1813
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,840
What happened? Why are
you getting emotional?

1814
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:12,800
Is it because I
called you a dimwit?

1815
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,040
No, that ball hit me hard.

1816
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,800
- Sorry, sir..
- Sorry, sir..

1817
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,640
You fools!

1818
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,080
Oh, my God!

1819
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,160
Alex..

1820
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,280
Alex...

1821
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,160
Alex..

1822
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,880
Who hit him? Rascal!

1823
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,080
Get that patient off.
Bring that stretcher!

1824
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:10,000
Alex.. Come on, Alex.

1825
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,880
Sir.. Take him to the emergency
ward, please. Immediately.

1826
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,120
Dad.

1827
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,840
- Alex. I think he's got his memory back.
- Yes.

1828
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:39,240
Brother-in-law. The
medicines did not cure him.

1829
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,120
This ball did the trick.

1830
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,240
God!

1831
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,960
- Is this the address?
- Yes.. It's this one.

1832
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,240
- Look. Read the address.
- Yes, this is the one. Let's go.

1833
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,880
Nandu, let me carry the boxes.
They are taller than you.

1834
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,840
- What are you saying?
- Yes. Give it to me.

1835
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,000
- Thank you, Raja.
- Come on.

1836
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,200
"Here comes the pizza!"

1837
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,240
"Here comes the pizza!"

1838
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,240
"Here comes the pizza!"

1839
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,120
"Here comes the pizza!"
- Take it.

1840
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,920
"Here comes the pizza!"

1841
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
"Here comes the pizza!"

1842
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,480
"Here comes the pizza!"

1843
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,840
Raja. Raja.

1844
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,880
I guess the hospital
guys got fed up

1845
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:31,960
and let him go.

1846
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,120
Come, Nandu. Let's have
some fun at his expense.

1847
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,520
Come on..

1848
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,080
Keep this too.

1849
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:39,520
Hey! What's your name? Alex.

1850
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,640
See the shoe?
Remember something?

1851
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,080
"A bunch of tamarind,
a tree of jujube."

1852
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:47,040
"Alex's shoes on Nandu's feet."

1853
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,508
Nandu.. I don't think
he remembers that song.

1854
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,280
Which one?

1855
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,040
- "See you.
- See you."

1856
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,120
- "Remember me in your prayers.
- Remember me in your prayers."

1857
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,240
Raja! Raja!

1858
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:02,400
Uncle, cancel my return tickets.

1859
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,280
We were looking for the guy who
smashed the coconut on my head.

1860
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:08,800
- He's right in front of me now.
- I think he got his memory back. How?

1861
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,200
All thanks to this ball.

1862
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,480
- This guy?
- What?

1863
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,840
Some noble man kicked this ball

1864
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,760
and the ball hit Alex on his head.
And he regained his memory.

1865
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:22,920
Hey, Raja!

1866
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,478
This is the same ball that
you kicked in the garden.

1867
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:26,320
Yes.

1868
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,760
- Hey!
- Hey.. Wait.

1869
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:31,080
I admit he lost his
memory because of me.

1870
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,040
But he also got it back
because of me, Uncle.

1871
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:34,520
Don't call me 'uncle'!

1872
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,960
- Take your shoes back, Alex.
- Hey, stammering fool. Hey!

1873
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,960
You stammerer!

1874
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,120
Raja!

1875
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,480
Get up. Come on.

1876
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,560
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! Nandu, run.

1877
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,240
Alex! Are you okay, Alex? Alex..

1878
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,280
I think he has lost his
memory again. Alex..

1879
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,880
Who am I? Alex!

1880
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,440
Is Big Ben the name of a clock
or your elder sibling? Tell me.

1881
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:07,600
- Alex, whom do we vote for next?
- Uncle, I am fine.

1882
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,640
Fine..

1883
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,118
What the hell are you looking at!
Get him.

1884
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:10,600
Hey!

1885
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:13,160
- Run..Throw away the pizza.
- Come on.. Catch him.

1886
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,080
- Alex. How many fingers can you see?
- Uncle!

1887
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,960
- Come on.
- Come on.

1888
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,720
Hey, you! Stop!

1889
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,560
- Nandu, we must jump.
- No, Raja, I won't jump.

1890
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,480
Nandu, if we don't
jump, we'll die.

1891
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,480
Come on.

1892
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:44,560
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1893
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,680
Come on.

1894
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:52,000
The places you've
made me jump from!

1895
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,968
You know what, Nandu, you go left.
And I'll go right.

1896
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:54,600
Why?

1897
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:56,760
Because they won't follow
you, they will follow me.

1898
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:59,600
- No.. I can't leave you..
- Nandu, stop blabbering and run.

1899
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:00,600
No, I won't go.

1900
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,360
- We don't have time, Nandu. Run.
- I won't go.

1901
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,800
- I said, go!
- No, I won't.. Go!

1902
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:10,160
- I said, go! You hit me?
- God!

1903
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,280
Take care, Raja.

1904
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,600
Hey!

1905
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,600
Oh, my God!

1906
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,680
What happened?

1907
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,000
My lineage!

1908
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,560
Why are you jumping like a frog?

1909
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,520
- Don't come any closer.
- What?

1910
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:53,040
- Hey, help!
- Why are you screaming?

1911
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:56,200
Hey.. Don't act smart
with me. Help!

1912
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:59,120
- Why are you calling people?
- I even called the police. Why?

1913
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,040
Yes.

1914
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:01,720
If you even lay a finger on me

1915
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,760
- they will arrest you, understand?
- Quiet, Rishi Kapoor's lookalike.

1916
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,760
- Or I will beat you up.
- You'll beat me up?

1917
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:07,800
Get lost, crazy guy.

1918
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:10,640
How dare you call
me crazy! Get lost!

1919
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:19,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

1920
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,000
I am Dr. Lulla.

1921
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,520
He is on the BMX.

1922
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,600
Hey!

1923
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,520
Hey!

1924
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,240
Hey!

1925
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,120
Oh, my God.

1926
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,600
Hey..

1927
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,000
Stop!

1928
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:13,480
Hey, are you all right?
Are you all right?

1929
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,000
- Move, leave.
- Hey..

1930
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:27,080
I swear, Raja, you're
going in for good.

1931
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,080
Sir, I'm not Raja.
N-No, I am Prem.

1932
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:32,480
- Prem Malhotra. His lookalike.
- Lookalike.

1933
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,040
You're the guy who's
good for nothing. Come.

1934
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:36,120
- Sir, you're hurting me.
- Come.

1935
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,400
- Come..
- Sir, talk to my dad. You are confused..

1936
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,720
- Sir, talk to my dad, Rajeev Malhotra.
- Hey!

1937
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,760
- To heck with your dad.
- Please, sir.

1938
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,560
- There's nothing anyone can do now.
- You're going bonkers, sir.

1939
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,360
Get in.

1940
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,998
Hey.. Stop.. Sir, you
can't take that in here.

1941
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:04,720
Move.

1942
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,720
What's wrong, Samaara? Why
do you look so tense?

1943
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,800
Prem hasn't showed up yet.
The show's going to start.

1944
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,840
I've been trying to call him
up. But he isn't answering.

1945
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:25,440
- Hey! Prem is here.
- Hey!

1946
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,320
Hurry up.. Where were you?

1947
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,800
The show's about to start and
you're showing up on a cycle.

1948
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,320
Why is he on a cycle?

1949
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:35,640
Look, the crowd is
going crazy. Silence..

1950
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,520
Are you scared?

1951
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:43,280
- It's that idiot's show.
- Hey!

1952
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,800
- Silence! Silence!
- Hey!

1953
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,200
I said, stop yelling.

1954
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,320
Don't think Justin Bieber
is going to show up here.

1955
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,120
- Hey..
- Quiet!

1956
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:59,080
When I was a kid, I sang and
danced with Lord Ganesha.

1957
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:01,480
I created a sensation
all over Mumbai.

1958
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,720
The Lord appeared in
my dreams and said..

1959
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,040
'Raja, don't be scared,
never bow down.'

1960
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:10,680
'Don't be petrified, and
never be shy.' - Hey!

1961
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:14,200
Is Prem nervous? Why is
he talking like that?

1962
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,840
That's not Prem,
that's my lover, Raja.

1963
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,920
Sir, I am not Raja, I
am Prem. Prem Malhotra.

1964
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,800
- I've been trying to tell you that.
- I see.

1965
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,200
I guess your mother
said that too, stupid.

1966
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,240
Look, sir, you're
making a big mistake.

1967
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,560
It's the first
concert of my life.

1968
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,560
If I don't get there, who
will perform in the show?

1969
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,520
Hello, Brother.

1970
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,680
"You met my gaze
and wiped me out."

1971
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,480
"My poor heart got wounded."

1972
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,600
"I heard about your admirers."

1973
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,200
"There are a bunch of them and
they follow you everywhere."

1974
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,280
"Make me your moon."

1975
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,880
"Make the star of
my destiny glow."

1976
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:18,000
"If you look at me just
once, it won't do."

1977
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,800
"Look at me again."

1978
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,860
"Will you accompany
me to the 9 to 12 show?

1979
01:53:27,872 --> 01:53:28,760
1, 2, 3, 4.."

1980
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,520
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

1981
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,760
"I heard about your admirers."

1982
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:42,280
"There are a bunch of them and
they follow you everywhere."

1983
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,320
"Why are you just standing
there and wondering?"

1984
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:49,160
- "Come, let's disappear.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.."

1985
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:13,600
"I have two tickets
for the night show."

1986
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,760
"Shall I open my wallet?
Will you take a look?"

1987
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,800
"I will sit close to you."

1988
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,200
"I will take you to the
theatre in a taxi."

1989
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,160
"Don't think of
me as a ruffian."

1990
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,680
"I have loads of money
in my wallet, dear!"

1991
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,280
"I'll make you eat to
your heart's content."

1992
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:40,240
"Whatever you desire, hot Samosa, Idli or Dosa."
- Move!

1993
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,200
"You are my Pepsi Cola.
I am your Coca-Cola."

1994
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:51,480
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

1995
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,400
"Hey, you.."

1996
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,160
"I whistle movie tunes"

1997
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,760
"looking at you every day."

1998
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,760
"I was thinking about
this since many days."

1999
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,720
"That I'll take you
to watch a movie."

2000
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,200
"Friday evening is quite
a wonderful one."

2001
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:35,600
"A new movie is out."

2002
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:39,640
"Don't worry about
the warm weather."

2003
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,080
"The movie theatre
is air-conditioned."

2004
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,000
I know. - "The name of the movie
is 'Beautiful Beloved of Mine'."

2005
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,000
"This is a super-hit movie!"

2006
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,400
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2007
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,480
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2008
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,400
"You met my gaze
and wiped me out."

2009
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:09,840
"My poor heart got wounded."

2010
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:13,720
"Will you accompany me to the
9 to 12 show? Will you.."

2011
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:31,000
"You met my gaze
and wiped me out."

2012
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,600
"My poor heart got wounded."

2013
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,560
"Will you accompany me to the
9 to 12 show? Will you.."

2014
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,360
Raja...

2015
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:07,480
Get up..

2016
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:11,760
Raja!

2017
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,280
- Raja!
- Get up. Get up.

2018
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,960
Let my friend, Raja, go..

2019
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,480
Let my friend, Raja, go..

2020
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,840
- We will let him go after bashing him up.
- Please. Move!

2021
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,520
Nandu!

2022
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,640
That's the old man
from room number 202.

2023
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:40,440
- Is he your friend?
- Hey!

2024
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,560
It was Raja who saved
your friend's life.

2025
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:46,000
For the sake of your friend,
let my friend, Raja, go.

2026
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,640
- Alex.
- Hey!

2027
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,320
- Do you both know him?
- Yes.

2028
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,400
He was dying on the street.

2029
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,600
I got him to the hospital at the
right time and saved his life, sir.

2030
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,488
I think you should give
us a reward and let us go.

2031
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,160
Yes..

2032
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:04,800
Reward?

2033
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,120
Malhotra? He's my
20-year-old enemy.

2034
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,800
And you saved his life.

2035
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,440
We have such bad luck.

2036
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,760
We saved his enemy's life.

2037
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,960
- Hey, beat me. Beat me. Hey..
- Alex!

2038
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:25,200
Raja, no one's going
to touch you now.

2039
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,200
Because you will
bring me Malhotra.

2040
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,240
Done. I'll get the old man.

2041
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,680
- Come on..
- Hey..

2042
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:41,680
- Nandu stays here.
- Why? This is not his problem.

2043
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,600
I'll get straight to the point.

2044
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:48,520
Exchange offer. Deliver
Malhotra, take away Nandu.

2045
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,160
Otherwise, Nandu's
head goes boom.

2046
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,800
Take it. Take it.

2047
01:58:56,320 --> 01:59:00,560
Malhotra won't come easily.
You will need this.

2048
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,560
- Go and get Malhotra.
- Hey!

2049
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:06,560
- Move. Raja. Raja, will you come back?
- No, I won't.

2050
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,240
- He hits a lot.
- Why are you crying?

2051
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,400
If I don't come back for you,
who else will I come back for?

2052
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,160
Come back soon, Raja.

2053
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,640
- Come soon, they are beating me..
- Quiet.

2054
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,880
Prem. You're unbelievable.
I've been trying to call you.

2055
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,160
Why didn't you answer my calls?

2056
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:31,800
- Anyway, tell me..
- Where is Malhotra?

2057
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:35,160
I am talking to you, are
you deaf? Where is he?

2058
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,400
- Prem..
- Hey, old man, come with me quietly..

2059
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:42,080
- What's wrong with you, Prem?
- To heck with Prem. I am Raja.

2060
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,560
- Got it?
- Prem, what kind of a joke is this?

2061
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:45,800
- Does this seem like a joke?
- What are you doing, dear?

2062
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,000
Raja!

2063
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,400
What are you doing?
She's my mom.

2064
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:54,640
- That's my dad.
- So? Do you want me to celebrate?

2065
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,240
Look, Prem, I saved
his life once

2066
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:58,880
and now, I'm going to
put his life in danger.

2067
01:59:58,960 --> 01:59:59,920
I'll settle the scores.

2068
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:03,840
- Raja..You two look so similar.
- Yes. We only look alike.

2069
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,960
He's Prem, born in
London. He's your son.

2070
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:09,040
And I am Raja from
Versova, Mumbai.

2071
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,800
Aunt Kashi raised me. The end.

2072
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,680
- Come on.
- Raja, don't do this.

2073
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:17,560
- What will you do?
- Prem. Prem, let him take me.

2074
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,360
It's not his fault.
He doesn't know that

2075
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:23,400
the person he's taking
along is not just your dad

2076
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:25,920
but his dad as well.

2077
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:27,680
What?

2078
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:31,960
Don't try to cook up
emotional stories now.

2079
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:36,160
I.. - It's true,
dear. It's true.

2080
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:39,920
I gave birth to twins at
the hospital in Mumbai.

2081
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,480
Yes.

2082
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:45,320
And Charles
disappeared with you.

2083
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:50,160
I thought, maybe you..

2084
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,520
You are our son.

2085
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:01,680
Our son!

2086
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:05,240
And this man here is
your twin brother.

2087
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,480
Forgive me, I..

2088
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:24,520
No, Raja!

2089
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,240
You turned out to be my brother.

2090
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,680
- Sorry, I called you stupid, idiot..
- Doesn't matter.

2091
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:37,720
- My brother can call me anything.
- Prem, I..

2092
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:42,080
Not Prem.. You can
call me idiot.

2093
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:45,080
Hey, idiot!

2094
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:49,360
What are you doing?

2095
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,680
I thought you got emotional.

2096
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,080
You're such an idiot.

2097
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:01,000
Guys.

2098
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:06,960
Here comes my friend, Raja.
Get ready to be beaten up.

2099
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,320
Raja!

2100
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,200
What are you looking at?

2101
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,000
You asked for Malhotra,
didn't you? Here's Malhotra.

2102
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:17,080
Malhotra. We meet again.

2103
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:23,680
- Look, Charles, this..
- Yes, I know..

2104
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:25,440
I'll get straight to the point.

2105
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:31,200
You screwed me, I'll screw you.

2106
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,760
Hello, stop all this.

2107
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,360
Look, you guys can chit-chat
later. I want to get out of here.

2108
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,280
Come on, send Nandu out.

2109
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:45,480
- Dear..
- Dad, when will Raja come?

2110
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,720
- He will come.
- Oh, no.

2111
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:48,800
Come on, get up.

2112
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:51,360
Dad. Please don't
hit him. Please.

2113
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:55,520
He's not Raja. That's not Raja,
he is getting beaten up.

2114
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:58,480
- Hey.. Get up.
- Don't hit me.

2115
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:01,520
- Don't hit me, please..
- Hey!

2116
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:06,280
- Please. Look, I am warning you.
- Hey!

2117
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:09,040
I mean, I am telling you,
if you touch me again

2118
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,280
then he'll come after you.

2119
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,400
He will come.

2120
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:23,120
He's coming.

2121
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:27,960
He's here!

2122
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,840
Hey, Raja. Here comes
my friend, Raja.

2123
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,120
Charles, do you know who he is?

2124
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:46,520
Who is he?

2125
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:52,040
He's my son whom you
abducted from the hospital.

2126
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,480
We are twins!

2127
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:56,640
He's my brother from
the same mother.

2128
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:57,640
What?

2129
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:11,000
- He beat me up.
- Hey! He really beat me up.

2130
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:12,760
- Hey!
- Hey!

2131
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,640
Raja.. There's no one left. Let
him go. He will die. Please.

2132
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,600
Get lost.

2133
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,200
For God's sake, please.

2134
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:53,040
Take your father and your brother,
and leave. And Nandu too.

2135
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:56,160
- Uncle, what are you saying?
- Alex! Your uncle is absolutely right.

2136
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,600
He has gone berserk.
Can't you see?

2137
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,720
He has united with his
family after 20 years.

2138
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:04,680
Let him go, otherwise, he
will wipe our family out.

2139
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:06,600
- Please, Raja.
- Don't touch me.

2140
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:08,040
- Please, Raja, trust me, please..
- Trust me.

2141
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:09,320
Take Nandu away from this cage.

2142
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:11,280
- Come..
- Nandu, are you okay?

2143
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:15,720
- Come on, lock it. Lock it. Hey..
- Caught you!

2144
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:19,720
- Where's your brother?
- You got caught!

2145
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:22,535
Come, Malhotra.

2146
02:05:22,547 --> 02:05:25,000
Mr. Charles, please.
Please let my dad go.

2147
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,000
- Please..
- Is it so? Prem.

2148
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:27,840
How will you save
your father now?

2149
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:31,520
Brother, exact revenge from him!

2150
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,720
- Why are you doing this?
- Prem. Kill him.

2151
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:35,120
Kill him..

2152
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:36,440
- Sir..
- Prem..

2153
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:41,760
Why don't you save your dad?

2154
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,080
Prem, don't just stand
there. Hit him.

2155
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:45,520
Save our dad.

2156
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:48,000
- Hit me..
- I can't do it..

2157
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,600
He cannot do it.

2158
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:50,960
Why don't you come out? Hit me.

2159
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,080
- Alex, don't touch my brother.
- I won't touch him.

2160
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:57,640
We'll hug him and venerate him!

2161
02:05:58,040 --> 02:05:59,920
- Prem, hit him.
- Hit him!

2162
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:02,920
- It's beyond my capacity, I cannot do it.
- Hey!

2163
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:05,520
- Hit me.
- Please forgive me. Please leave me. Prem.

2164
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:07,760
Prem, hit him. Don't be scared.

2165
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:10,800
Should I spare
you? Fine, go. Go.

2166
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,920
Go on.. Go. Hey, stop!

2167
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,160
- Raja!
- Come on, get up..

2168
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:26,200
I won't spare you..

2169
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,320
Raja..

2170
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:44,280
- What's happening?
- Your family will be wiped out soon.

2171
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:45,240
Look.

2172
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:53,360
Your brother and your father
will soon be dead. Just watch.

2173
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,200
"They killed him.." Beat him.

2174
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:01,960
- Rascal. Get up!
- "They.."

2175
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,160
Oh, God!

2176
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,280
When Raja hits him,
Prem hits him.

2177
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,360
Raja, you hit him and
Prem will hit him.

2178
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:28,760
Hey..

2179
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:30,120
Hit him

2180
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,640
and look at him. Hit him, Raja.

2181
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:49,240
"Twins.."

2182
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:50,320
Hey, idiot!

2183
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:53,440
Wow!

2184
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,560
- Yes!
- Yes!

2185
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:58,800
Are you having fun?

2186
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:00,960
I'm loving it. Give
me more power.

2187
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:02,680
Brother, do something else.

2188
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:07,920
- Hey.. Hit him. Uncle!
- Hit him, Raja.

2189
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:12,040
- Okay.
- Hey..

2190
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:14,600
Prem, in order to beat that guy
who's strong like Baahubali

2191
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:17,080
we must beat his uncle who's
similar to the character Katappa.

2192
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:18,120
- It is highly necessary.
- Nandu.

2193
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,640
- What was he saying?
- Caught you!

2194
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:30,400
I got hurt.

2195
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:39,120
I'm hitting someone for the
first time, this is fun.

2196
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:55,560
"Twins!"

2197
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:06,720
- Uncle. Got you!
- Hey..

2198
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:07,920
Wait.. Stop.

2199
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,800
Run, Prem. He's
right behind you.

2200
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,200
Run! Run!

2201
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:15,720
Look at my brother. Run!

2202
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:17,960
- Wait, you rascal.
- Open it soon.

2203
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:24,240
Get up.

2204
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:29,920
Hey!

2205
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,320
Why are you hitting me?

2206
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:33,880
Have you lost it? You
started all this.

2207
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,480
B-But I work in this factory.

2208
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,640
Crazy guy.

2209
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:40,680
Alex, you are not
a factory worker.

2210
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:43,800
Tell me. Who is the
President of America?

2211
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:45,960
Donald Duck or Donald Trump?

2212
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:49,400
Who beat you up? Varun
Dhawan or Shikhar Dhawan?

2213
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:52,104
You're the security
guard here, aren't you?

2214
02:09:52,116 --> 02:09:53,040
I am your uncle.

2215
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,160
- Uncle..
- I got thrashed for your sake.

2216
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,440
Say it once. I am your uncle.

2217
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:59,280
- Doctor.
- You bloody.. Uncle. I am your uncle.

2218
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,080
"One, a Raja, one, a Prem."

2219
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,040
"Twins.."

2220
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:12,360
Come. Come, Mr. Twins.

2221
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:15,080
Do you want to hit me? Go ahead.

2222
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,320
But before you do,
you must realise

2223
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,760
that your father might
run out of lifelines.

2224
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:30,000
You have one minute. Only
60 seconds. Save him.

2225
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:33,080
Bye, bye, Malhotra.

2226
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:35,800
- Hey!
- Raja, no.

2227
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:40,240
- No.
- 50 seconds.

2228
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:47,920
Raja, Prem, you both
are out of your minds.

2229
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:50,400
Go away. This bomb can
go off any minute.

2230
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:51,560
Dad, don't mind

2231
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,520
but even you turned out
to be an idiot like Prem.

2232
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:55,720
We have met after 20 years.

2233
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:57,520
I can't let you go so easily.

2234
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,418
Prem, you're educated.
Tell us what to do.

2235
02:11:00,430 --> 02:11:00,920
Yes.

2236
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:04,480
- I'll check on Google.
- We'll all blow up by then.

2237
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:06,320
Don't worry about me,
you both run away.

2238
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:07,240
- Dad, please..
- Dad, please!

2239
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:11,280
Look, I don't know
much about bombs.

2240
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:12,400
But what I do know is that

2241
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:15,160
this colour is very lucky for me.
This is Lord Ganesha's colour.

2242
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:18,200
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"

2243
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,920
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"

2244
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:38,320
Only 10 seconds left. Run!

2245
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,680
Dad, every son's dad is safe

2246
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,160
when the Lord is with him.

2247
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,800
- Hail Lord Ganesha..
- No! Raja, no!

2248
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:46,640
No!

2249
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:49,320
Raja!

2250
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:53,960
Dad's safe.

2251
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:55,880
- Dad's safe.
- Hallelujah. My dad's safe.

2252
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:56,515
It's a miracle.

2253
02:11:56,527 --> 02:11:58,240
My dad's safe. Jesus
Christ, it's a miracle.

2254
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:02,360
- Holy Mother Mary.
- "Twins.."

2255
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:07,640
- What are you doing? Oh..
- You don't know what I am doing?

2256
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:11,880
Y-You're being
very naughty. Oh..

2257
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:13,200
Oh.

2258
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:16,680
Prem, where are you
going? Come back..

2259
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:19,200
You're so shy.

2260
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:23,120
Prem?

2261
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:25,200
Prem!

2262
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:26,600
Prem!

2263
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:30,000
Alishka.

2264
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,280
- Oh, my God.
- Sister-in-law got scared.

2265
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,640
My sister-in-law
got scared. Sorry.

2266
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:40,520
- Prem!
- Hey, moron. What are you doing here?

2267
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:44,720
Brother, control your speed.
It's a problem for me.

2268
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:48,520
Once I start, there's no stopping
me. There are no halts in between.

2269
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:51,640
But, Brother.. I'll just check.

2270
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:54,160
- Sorry, Sister-in-law.
- Fool.

2271
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:58,320
Who are you?

2272
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:05,800
- Excuse me?
- No.. Excuse me.

2273
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:09,280
Who here likes it if the
speaker's volume is quite loud?

2274
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:12,840
Because my wife doesn't
like bass at all.

2275
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:15,720
Oh, I'm so sorry, for
you and your wife.

2276
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:18,840
What sorry? I left my honeymoon
in between because of you.

2277
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:22,920
- Raja..
- You both.. You both look identical.

2278
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:27,400
And we too. Even we
are identical twins.

2279
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:32,040
- Twins!
- Oh, my! Twins?

2280
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:36,280
Original 'Judwa'. You
both are 'Judwa 2'.

2281
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:38,840
Are you both also here
on your honeymoon?

2282
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:44,280
I don't understand.

2283
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:47,480
You won't understand, as people
give me a place in their hearts

2284
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,560
but they fail to understand me.

2285
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:50,640
I arrive dressed in pants,
but never wear a shirt.

2286
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:54,520
- I arrive on a cycle, not in a car.
- Oh.

2287
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,800
And listen..

2288
02:13:57,400 --> 02:13:58,520
I arrive wearing an underwear

2289
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,520
I don't arrive donning
a pair of shorts.

2290
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:01,960
My case is something similar.

2291
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:05,600
I go to college, but
don't attend lectures.

2292
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:07,520
Wow. - I have six-pack
abs and pack a punch

2293
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:09,040
but I never will be
pot-bellied and paunchy.

2294
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,280
How sweet!

2295
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,560
I travel by a bus wherein the
driver manages to keep control

2296
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:13,040
but I will never let
anyone control me.

2297
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:16,360
"Twins."

2298
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:20,040
- He's very funny.
- "Twins!"

2299
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,280
Well, why are you
just standing there?

2300
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,560
- Let's move.
- Okay, boss. Okay.

2301
02:14:27,120 --> 02:14:29,960
- Listen, do you know that song?
- Which one?

2302
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:33,960
- Oh.. That's my favourite song.
- Mine too.

2303
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:35,080
I can perform it right now.

2304
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:36,960
I love it.

2305
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:43,040
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2306
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:44,320
Once more. Please.

2307
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:46,160
Okay..

2308
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:52,520
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2309
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:55,200
- This is really fun, once more.
- Oh.

2310
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:57,400
- They disappeared. Raja!
- Oh.

2311
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:58,680
- She is calling.
- Go..

2312
02:14:58,840 --> 02:14:59,720
Come.

2313
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,520
Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2314
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:08,440
"I heard about your admirers."

2315
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:12,080
"There are a bunch of them and
they follow you everywhere."

2316
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:15,520
"Why are you just standing
there and wondering?"

2317
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:17,520
"Come, let's disappear."

2318
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:19,240
"1, 2, 3, 4.."

2319
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:44,600
"I have two tickets
for the night show."

2320
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:46,720
"Shall I open my wallet?
Will you take a look?"

2321
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:53,840
"I will sit close to you. I'll take
you to the theatre in a taxi."

2322
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:59,280
"Don't think of
me as a ruffian."

2323
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:01,840
"I have loads of money
in my wallet, dear!"

2324
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:06,640
"I'll make you eat to
your heart's content."

2325
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:10,320
"Whatever you desire, hot Samosa, Idli or Dosa."
- Move!

2326
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:14,400
"You are my Pepsi Cola.
I am your Coca-Cola."

2327
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:21,680
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2328
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:41,760
"Hey, you.."

2329
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:48,200
"I have two tickets
for the night show."

2330
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,760
"Shall I open my wallet?
Will you take a look?"

2331
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:57,840
"I will sit close to you. I'll take
you to the theatre in a taxi."

2332
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:03,240
"Don't think of
me as a ruffian."

2333
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:05,520
"I have loads of money
in my wallet, dear!"

2334
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:10,600
"I'll make you eat to
your heart's content."

2335
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:14,360
"Whatever you desire, hot Samosa, Idli or Dosa."
- Move!

2336
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:18,320
"You are my Pepsi Cola.
I am your Coca-Cola."

2337
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:25,880
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2338
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:47,280
"I whistle movie tunes
looking at you every day."

2339
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:52,640
"I was thinking about
this since many days."

2340
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:55,280
"That I'll take you
to watch a movie."

2341
02:17:56,560 --> 02:18:02,440
"Friday evening is quite a wonderful
one. A new movie is out."

2342
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:07,360
"Don't worry about
the warm weather."

2343
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:11,000
"The movie theatre is air-conditioned."
- I know.

2344
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:12,880
"The name of the movie is
'Beautiful Beloved of Mine'."

2345
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,920
"This is a super-hit movie!"

2346
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:22,760
"Will you accompany me
to the 9 to 12 show?"

2347
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:30,040
"Will you accompany me
