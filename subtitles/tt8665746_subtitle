00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,620
Daddy is not an ordinary person.

350
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,210
We could face the tricks played by
Vempa Kasi as we had Daddy with us.

351
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,250
I think your daughter looks just like you.

352
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:25,370
Don't be sarcastic.
Would she be so beautiful if she’s like me?

353
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,410
She’s just like her mom.
Come on have it, have it

354
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,410
What did she study?

355
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,040
She’s done Engineering in Bangalore

356
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,660
Great, then you can get her married now.

357
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,620
We’re are already on the same task.
But we should get a good match?

358
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,330
That is right.

359
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,080
-Shiva.
-Yes Daddy.

360
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,450
You go and take care of the food
arrangements, it’s late already.

361
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,200
As you say.

362
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,950
-Excuse me.
-Yes Shiva.

363
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,790
I was asked to check if the food is ready.

364
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,450
I’ve made them keep all the food out.

365
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,410
Oh no, I'm unable to know what’s
happening out when I'm in the kitchen.

366
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,410
Siva, snacks are hot. Have them first.

367
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,080
Okay.

[Music]

369
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:21,910
-Sorry.
-Hey.

370
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,600
I'm sorry.

371
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,830
Why did you touch like that? Can’t you see?

372
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,790
Sorry, I didn’t notice.

373
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,830
I too am asking you to mind yourself.

374
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,410
Do you even know where you touched me?

375
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,250
-It is here.
-Hey!

376
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,450
Hey, no need to say that.

377
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,200
Didn't you do that on purpose?

378
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,700
I didn't notice you really. I am sorry.

379
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,620
You touched me with a plan for sure.
I will teach you a lesson.

[Motorcycle approaching]

381
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,120
Come on, don’t push.
Tickets are available. Why hurry?

382
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,870
-Go slowly.
-Seshu, how’s the collection?

383
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,200
Super bro, it’s rockingl.

384
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,730
If it remains the same for another month

385
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,960
We could build another
theater in our village.

386
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,410
Ok, account all the collection
and give it to daddy.

387
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,060
Ok bro.

-Oh no. Nalli.
-Madam

390

-You go and bring coconuts.
-Ok madam.

391
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,740
Dad!

392
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,250
-Daddy.
-Go and catch them.

393
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Come on drive. Fast.

394
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,750
Come fast.

395
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,790
Come.

396
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,700
Fast.

397
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,700

399
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:38,410
May they be damned. May god curse them.

400
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,830
Hey, shut up.

401
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,000
I might die of your screams.

402
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,120
He sent goons to attack as
he couldn’t bear losing.

403
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,080
It's Vempa Kasi that has done all of this.

404
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,160
His anger is not about losing but
about the a share in sand quarry

405
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,910
What's about the share in sand quarry?

406
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,750
-Hey Shiva, are they caught?
-No daddy, I missed them.

407
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,750
But they’re Vempa Kasi’s men for sure

408
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,870
Come on, let’s see their end.

409
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,700
Hey Daddy,
you don’t get emotional for nothing.

410
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,910
I know how to deal with them well.

411
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,330
We get many chances if we
wish to win over the enemy.

412
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,790
But we get very less chances to finish them.

413
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,870
Why did you just threaten
them and come back?

414
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,870
I didn’t expect Daddy
and Siva to be there bro.

415
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,000
We should finish them first.

416
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,000
They think several times
before even hitting someone.

417
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:42,580
But we never even think
even once to kill someone.

418
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:48,080
I don’t need them to die,
but a share in the sand ramp.

419
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,120
I contested the election just for that.

420
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,450
In a way it’s for our
good that he missed it.

421
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,000
Already Viswanatham would’ve
been shivering with fear.

422
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,540
Keep watching,
he will come for a compromise with me soon.

423
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,160
Did you called for me Grandma?

424
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,290
Have you come Siva?

425
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,080
I’m just an elder at home but no one cares.

426
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,870
No one accompanies even to the temple

427
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,290
That’s why I have to
call you for everything.

428
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,200
That's okay grandma, come on. I’ll take you.

429
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,040
I’ll come in two minutes.

the material for prayers ready?

Yes brother, tell me.

435

We’ve taken up distribution
of Mahesh Babu’s next film.

436
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,870
That's great bro.

437
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,790
-I’ve called to book your theater too.
-You need not sll that brother.

438
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,500
It would run for 100 days
in our theater for sure.

439
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,540
Get the repairs done if any,
as it is the film casting a big star.

440
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,190
I will take care everything brother.

441
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,340
Will do that for sure.

-It’s running fine

-I said I'm coming now.

god at the temple, not in heaven.

-No

Hello, it's you that I’m asking.

503
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,700
We shouldn’t let out what we wish god for.

504
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,250
Oh! So you have some unfulfilled wishes too.

505

This week's collection should
top that of the last week Daddy.

506

We shall release a good movie Daddy.

507

What is this?

508
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,480
-Why are all the tractors halted there?
-No idea Daddy.

509
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,520
Why did you stop here guys?

510
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,980
We came to take the sand Daddy.
They are asking money from us too.

511
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,480
WHo is asking you for money?

512
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,980
The Godavari here belongs to our village.

513
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,480
Everyone born here have
a right on this sand.

514
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,440
Who’s that fellow asking money?
Come with me.

515
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,940
Why are you collecting money from our
people in our village quarries, idiot?

516
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,940
Aren't you a henchman of Vempa Kasi?

517
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,310
What business do you have here?

518
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,020
Don't ask me. Viswanatham asked me
to collect it. You better ask him.

519
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,150
Is it Viswanatham?

520
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:01,560
What’re you saying?

521
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,310
Yes, he said not to give sand without
paying challan even to the villagers.

522
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,350
Is the sand his property
or yours not to give?

523
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,520
Come on guys, we shall talk to Viswanatham.

524
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,770
-Hey, you come along.
-Ravi, bring him.

525
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,690
Come on move.

526
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,350
Ok, we shall support him as you all said.

527
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,270
ZP chairman should be in our hands finally,
isnt it?

528
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,310
That's It.
-That's right!

529
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,730
Viswanatham, did you ask him to
collect money at the sand quarry?

530
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,940
We shall talk about that later.

531
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,020
As we thought.
- It’s not right.

532
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,190
It’s wrong to collect money from villagers.

533
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,150
Everyone has a right on that sand.
Ask your people to stop it.

534
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,650
Who are you to ask me to stop?

535
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,230
What?

536
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,270
You think I’ll stop it if you come
with a few guys and ask me to stop?

537
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,600
Do you know what was my
expense during the election?

538
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,980
Do you know how much did I
pay to the guys behind you?

539
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,900
-Did I ask you to distribute money?
-We should do it.

540
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,520
I won becauseI did. Do you think
I won as you got the votes for me?

541
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,020
I would end up on the roads
if I do whatever you say.

542
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:10,980
Are you doing this for money or have you
joined hands with Vempa Kasi in fear?

543
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,730
-You’re crossing your limits.
-Huh, I’d have given you money if needed

544
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:19,060
I didn’t make you win to do these
things by joining hands with idiots

545
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,020
What are you saying?

546
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,350
What did you think about me?

547
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,520
-Be careful Viswanatham, don’t mess with me.
-Push him out.

548
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,230
What crap are you talking?

549
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,060
How dare you lay your hand on Daddy,
you rascal.

550
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,310
-How dare you lay hands on us?
-Hey, what’s all this?

Hey, stop.

555
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:57,850
Do you have even this shade?

556
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,480
I’ve never noticed it.

I wanted to tell you something since long.

I like you.

I’m crazy about you.

562
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:20,730
I don’t know how else to tell you.

563
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,560
You say yes and we will love here,

564
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,650
get married here,

565
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,230
lets have our first night here, have kids
here and we shall die together right here.

something with you Daddy.

I never expected you to give such a shock.

It would have been better
if you told this 4 days ago.

into tiffs since 4 days.

he’ll think we have trapped her willingly.

I press her neck and finish her?

you a lot of times not to mess with her.

When all the friends were having it,
I too tried to have a taste.

you got to experience that for sure.

the need will turn into addiction.

Tell me dude.

1042
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:50,210
Ambani’s PA is bothering me
with his calls every day.

1043
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:50,800
What for?

1044
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,800
As they laid all the gas pipes from here

1045
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,590
They are leaking somewhere

1046
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,630
So he’s pushing me to figure it out somehow.

1047
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:58,210
Is it?

1048
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,300
Let me see what you say now.

1049
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,460
That's it. I’ve been getting calls from
him continuously for the last three days.

1050
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:05,090
From whom?

1051
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:07,000
Who else, Mukki Ambani.

1052

Oh no.

As I’m not answering his calls

1054
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:13,260
looks like Ambani’s PA found put that
you and I live in the same village.

1055
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:14,750
And he’s on to you.

1056
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:16,210
Promise me something.

1057
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:16,960
Okay.

1058
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,590
If he calls you again, you should
never say that I’m back in the village

1059
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:22,840
and that we both hail from the same village.

1060
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,380
Oh no.

1061
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,920
-How many thinks can I handle?
-Yes.

1062
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,210
Should I not have some
energy left in me too?

1063
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:27,090
Order two Samosas.

1064
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,590
-Give him two Samosas.
-I asked for tea.

1065
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:29,800
has he gone to fetch milk now?

1066
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,250
You’re low on patience bro. He will get it.

1067
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:33,380
When would he serve the tea?

1068
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,840
-He’ll give you after you eat, go on.
-That sounds good.

1069

1075
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:50,100
I just came on a day's leave to the festival
and they have already called me a 100 times.

1076

They’d shut down the company
if I’m not there daddy

1077
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,590
Did you think anything about our Siva?

1078
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,500
He’s doesn't listen to me at all.

1079
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:59,920
A person needs to be instructed in the right
manner. It's only then he would get it.

1080
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:02,170
You’re soft and hence he
doesn't get what you say.

1081
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:05,050
I’ll take him with me before
I leave after the festival.

1082

1211
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,540
The same Siva whom you
loved more than your life.

1212
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,300
Ok, come on.

1213
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:32,410
I’ll take you away.

1214
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:36,460
I’ll not keep quiet if anyone
comes in between us now.

1215
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:39,420
It should be decided today.

1216
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,300
Careful Indu, come.

1217
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,300
Come with me Indu.

1218
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:49,250
Siva. Siva let go. Siva leave me.

1219
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:50,670
Siva leave me.

1220
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:52,090
Have you gone you mad?

1221
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:53,420
Do you understand what you are doing?

1222
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,300
Yes, we did love each other.

1223
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:56,370
We had so many dreams.

1224
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:58,510
But none of those dreams came true Siva.

1225
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,130
If you had really loved me

1226
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,250
you would wish that I be
happy with whoever I am.

1227
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:10,250
But you would not behave
in such sadistic manner.

1228
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:12,670
It was the same back then.

1229
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,460
You let out our matter to the whole village.

1230
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:21,250
You are ruining my life
now doing the same again.

1231
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:24,670
Damn. Your love is so fake.

1232

What the hell did you just say?

1233
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,250
You call my love fake?

1234
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,130
You are lying to me fearing your dad.

1235

No.

-Siva.
-Come let's go.

1237

We have no relation with your
dad and the people here, come on.

-Siva.

-Siva, let go of my hand.
-Listen to me, come with me.

-Siva, leave me.
- I'm there with you from now on.

1244

-We need not fear anyone from today.
-Leave me Siva.

1245

Hey, leave her alone.

1246

-Daddy.
-Leave her.

back? Didn't I tell you not to come back?

Come on, let’s go.
- Leave my hand Siva.

1253
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:10,550
Siva. What’re you doing? Leave her.

1254
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:13,090
I'm telling you to leave her.

1255

Let go of her boy.

1256
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:17,250
Come.

1257
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:18,880
-Daddy.
-Take him.

1258
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:19,840
Come Siva.

1259
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,500
What tricks do the both of you play!

1260
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,920
You show your anger on me.

1261
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,800
Why do you show it on the females at home?

1262
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,710
Do you intend to ruin my daughter's life?

1263
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:32,340
Forgive me Viswanatham.

1264
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,340
I’ll not let the mistakes
committed till now repeat again.

1265
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:38,550
How can you claim that when you
couldn't stop them all this time.

1266
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:42,460
I know how to deal with him,
you leave right now. Go!

1267
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:52,380

Get into the vehicle right now.

Get in, get into the vehicle.

Why don’t you talk?

1278
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,820
I can’t live without Indu, daddy

1279
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:48,150
I couldn’t take it when she
was away from me for so long.

1280
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:53,110
Then, how can I be at peace if they say
she doesn't belong to me ever daddy?

1281
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:56,070
Hey, she is married now and
is a wife to someone now.

1282
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:57,360
That was a forced marriage.

1283
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:59,510
A wedlock is a wedlock whether
it's by force or by responsibility.

1284
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,530
You have to forget her once
she is married to someone else.

1285
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:04,890
My love isn't a one time event in life
like a birth or death to forget about it.

1286
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:10,860
It’s like a tide in the sea,
which never stops.

1287

Have you lost your mind?

1288
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:15,030
In the days people change a girl every week

1289
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:19,530
why are you torturing a married
girl on the name of love?

1290
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:25,320
She is not even willing to see you.
But you are still behind her.

1291
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:29,610
Damn! What kind of a man are you? Don't
you understand how much ever I tell you?

1292
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:30,860
It's you who doesn't understand.

1293
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,570
I’ve been waiting for her since 3 years
without forgetting her for a while.

1294

-She came back for me as my love is true.
-Shut up rascal.

1295
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:39,150
You’re going on and on with the same thing.

1296
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:43,650
You will end up losing me too if you
even if you go anywhere near that house.

1297

What daddy? Are you trying to threaten me?

1298

You think whatever you want to.
But you cannot go to that house.

I will.

1301

I’ll drive that fear away. I’ll prove it
to all of you that she has come for me.

I committed a big mistake
supporting you all these days.

punishment along with you.

If at all I come, that would be with Indu.

Whats there to think boy?

1315
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:46,740
If she has so scared, why did she love him?
Why marry someone else on her dad's force?

-Doesn't she care about him daddy?
-Who said she loved him boy?

Who do you think is scared?

1318

Do you think she loved
him or she fears her dad?

1319
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,490
She has never loved him all throughout.

1320

It is true.

1324
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:13,330
and asked me to go to Viswanatham's house as
Indu was going to talk to her dad about them

1325

I met with an accident on that day.

I lied to Siva that I met with the
accident on the way to Viswanatham’s house.

01:59:27,670 --> 01:59:29,930
Why did you leave it when you knew it daddy?
You should’ve asked Indu seriously.

1381
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:31,420
You fool.

1382
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:36,090
Any lady erring knowingly would
convert every moment in her favor.

1383
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:40,380
By the time I was out of the hospital,
I came to know that she was already engaged.

1384
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:42,500
Siva was nowhere to be found.

1385
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:47,090
I searched a lot and finally
went to her house to ask her.

1386
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:50,340
You are committing a mistake dear.

1387
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,750
He is very innocent. He loves you so dearly.

1388
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,460
I tried a lot to tell my dad,
but he is not convinced.

1389
01:59:57,550 --> 02:00:00,130
Enough of your acting. I know everything.

1390
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,380
I overheard your discussion last night.

1391
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:06,710
Oh! So you've heard it?

1392
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:10,710
You made him fall madly in love with
you and are now marrying someone else.

1393
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:13,670
You aren't just cheating Siva,
but your parents too.

1394
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:15,750
And are cheating your own self.

1395
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,300
Hello, what is this? As I keep hearing,
you are trying to say I've cheated.

1396
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:24,170
We did go around and it's done.

1397
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:28,670
He took it a bit seriously, but not me.

1398
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:32,130
Just for that reason,
how can he think that is life?

1399
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:37,130
He is living in the imaginary
world of love believing your words.

1400
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:42,000
But he’s not aware that all of
it is a trap of lies by you.

1401
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:45,340
I don’t care whether you
think it's love or treachery.

1402
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:49,590
He’s ok to have fun with,
but not for marriage

1403
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:51,380
Thus I’ve taken an option.

1404
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:53,100
An option? Is it?

1405
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:59,420
So you need a tough guy to have
fun with and a soft guy to marry.

1406
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:01,420
That's right. So what is it now?

1407
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,840
You are talking as if it's a
girl's life that is ruined?

1408
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:06,630
How simply are you concluding it?

1409
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:12,210
When he said he loves Indu, I thought you
have ethics as you are an educated girl.

1410
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:14,460
But I never expected you are characterless.

1411
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,630
So have you came to know now?
Go and tell him.

1412
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,300
You've just seen his love girl.
Not his anger.

1413
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:23,800
He’ll not leave you alive for a
second once he knows the truth.

1414
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:27,170
He already made a mistake loving you.

1415
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:31,550
I can't ruin his life by letting
him make the mistake of killing you.

1416
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:35,130
Don't waste my time by
blackmailing me emotionally.

1417
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:36,550
I don’t care.

1418
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:39,300
Why do I need to blackmail you?
Just keep watching.

1419
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:44,300
I’ll make him forget you and get him married
to a better and beautiful girl than you.

1420
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:45,960
Do whatever you wish to.

1421
02:01:48,130 --> 02:01:50,780
Viswanatham locked up Siva in the rice
mill till his daughter’s wedding was done.

1422
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:52,960
and got him beaten up badly.

1423
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,340
When I came to know about it, I thought
of hacking everyone of them to death.

1424
02:01:57,590 --> 02:02:02,590
But as his life will be ruined by whatever
I do, I let them go to stop these fights.

1425
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:06,630
When you were asking him to leave the
village, I thought that was your anger.

1426
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,710
but I didn't know you had so
much agony in your heart daddy.

1427
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,090
It's okay. Let's go.

1428
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:26,850
Why are you gloomy?

1429
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:28,900
Are you tensed?

1430
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:31,060
Why would I be tensed?

1431
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,310
Anyways, why would u be tensed about
his torture for these few days?

1432
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:37,350
But I’m very tensed.

1433
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:41,520
Because he has been
torturing me since 3 years.

1434
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,020
He is beating my men up,
burning my properties down.

1435
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:48,980
Finally he has come to a stage where he came
home, pulled you by hand and made a mess.

1436
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:53,730
Everyone is saying why am I being
silent and why am I not doing anything?

1437
02:02:54,730 --> 02:02:58,270
But they don’t know that my daughter is
the reason behind him turning that way.

1438
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:01,650
And it's all my daughter's fault.

1439
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:04,350
What’s my fault?

1440
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:05,490
What did I do?

1441
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:08,440
Damn, don’t fake it. I know everything.

1442
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:13,020
No father in the world would say his
daughter is an idiot. I am doing the same.

1443
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:19,810
To take any action, I fear about what proofs
he has and what he would do with them.

1444
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,770
Your husband would arrive in two days.

1445
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:26,980
I'm scared what happens if
he gets to know all of this.

1446
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,900
You worry about Mahesh.

1447
02:03:29,690 --> 02:03:31,020
I’ll manage him.

1448
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:31,850
Shut up.

1449
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:34,650
Shameless girl.

1450
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:38,350
You say you would manage? What will you do?

1451
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:41,410
Will you say that you had fun with
that Siva but married this guy

1452
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:42,480
and ask him not to feel bad?

1453
02:03:44,230 --> 02:03:50,850
A girl like you has a guy at every place and
finally a different one to get married to.

1454
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:57,270
But there would at least be one person among
all of them who would lvoe you sincerely.

1455
02:03:57,560 --> 02:03:59,400
Our bad luck is that we
are dealing with that fellow now.

1456
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:03,190
If I ask you why you did that,
you would say just for fun.

1457
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:03,940
Is it for fun?

1458
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:08,980
What a mistake it is
to cheat a guy for fun!

1459
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:13,720
Such mistakes you commit
taking them easy will grow big

1460
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:16,790
and would haunt you and your
parents for a lifetime.

1461
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:18,350
Stop it now.

1462
02:04:18,850 --> 02:04:23,480
Knowing everything, why did you
agree when I said I would marry Mahesh?

1463
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:24,480
By thinking.

1464
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:31,730
By thinking as a father about who is better
amongst them, I got you married to Mahesh.

1465
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:34,150
Selfishness.

1466
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:36,900
Selfishness that my
daughter should live well.

1467
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:40,940
It’s my fate as a father.
I should do something right?

1468
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:43,150
I’ll take care of him.

1469
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:01,770
You have to do me a favor Kasi.

1470
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:04,880
I took it easy as it was a small problem.

1471
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:10,020
But that fellow has become
so stubborn to handle.

1472
02:05:10,190 --> 02:05:11,650
My son in law is coming in a couple of days.

1473
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:16,150
If he behaves similarly when he arrives, I'm
scared about my daughter’s life.

1474
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:20,520
I’m unable to stop that Siva.
What do I do Kasi?

1475
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,400
I called you for the same reason.

1476
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:26,560
What will I get doing this favor for you?

1477
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:28,700

1478

I’ll make you win unanimously
in the coming election.

1479

I’ll give away the entire sand ramp to you.

1480
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:47,790
There’s just one way to avoid
all of this happening repeatedly.

1481
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:48,710
Yeah.

1482
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:52,750

Killing him?

1484
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:58,790
I told you long back. But
you didn't pay heed.

1485
02:05:59,410 --> 02:06:00,700
You brought him to your house.

02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:06,700
Why will Indu order to kill me?

1549
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,040
I’m telling the truth.

1550
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:09,700
[Phone ringing]

1551
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:12,290
She is the one who asked to kill you.

1552
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:18,350
[Phone ringing]

1553
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:24,750
Hey Nalli

1554
02:15:25,410 --> 02:15:28,080
He shouldn’t escape at any cost.

1555
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:30,920
Kill him. Understood?

1556
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:47,340
[Music]

1557
02:16:35,660 --> 02:16:41,560
[Music]

1558
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:59,330
Come on, kill me.

1559
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:08,410
When Indu, who loved me more than
my life has sent you herself to kill me

1560
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:15,750
How much would I have tortured her!

1561
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:22,870
There’s no mistake intending to kill me.

1562
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:25,620
Come.

1563
02:17:27,450 --> 02:17:34,120
My intestines should fall
out with your stab. Come.

1564
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:36,450
Kill me.

1565
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,200
Go and tell her.

1566
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:47,750
That I happily died for her.

1567
02:17:51,410 --> 02:17:53,500
What a great lover you are!

1568
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:58,790
How will my anger cool
down if you die happily?

1569
02:17:59,250 --> 02:18:03,370
You shouldn’t die so easily.
You should die suffering and weeping.

1570
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:08,910
I should reveal a truth
to you for that to happen.

1571
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:16,250
She has never loved you.
She just used you for her lust.

1572
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:21,910
Her dad didn’t get her
married to another guy.

1573
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:29,160
She herself married the guy she chose.

1574
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:37,120
You waited for her like a dog
thinking she really loved you.

1575
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:45,290
Are you feeling sad?

1576
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:49,200
Then die now.

1577
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:09,040
[Doors creaking]

1578
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:15,730
[Dialing]

1579
02:19:17,470 --> 02:19:22,530
[Phone ringing]

1580
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:28,500
[Thunders]

1581
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:51,680
[Doors shut]

1582
02:20:00,830 --> 02:20:07,200
Did I ask you to love me or marry me?

1583
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:09,620
Is it me?

1584
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:14,950
Did I say I can’t think of
anyone else in my life than you?

1585
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:20,910
You said it all and everything is a lie.

1586
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:23,580
What is all of this for?

1587
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:32,040
If you revealed what you needed first,
all of this wouldn't have happened.

1588
02:20:34,410 --> 02:20:40,410
Why did you cheat me decorating
the mask of love on it?

1589
02:20:42,370 --> 02:20:48,500
You always told me that you would die a
minute before me if death comes to me.

1590
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,830
I like you a lot Indu.

1591
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:57,080
That’s why I came to fulfill your wish.

1592
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:30,230
[Coughing]

1593
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:39,050
[Panting]

1594
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:47,540
Were you scared?

1595
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:53,200
Were you scared that I would kill you?

1596
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:09,540
You sent men to kill me as there
was no sincerity in your love.

1597
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:18,080
But I loved you more than
anyone else in this world can.

1598
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:25,410
In that case, how I kill you Indu?

1599
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:33,080
Still,
you shouldn’t die. You should be alive.

1600
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:38,290
As long as you’re alive,
every second you breathe

1601
02:22:38,830 --> 02:22:44,450
You should live weeping remembering
that your life is on my mercy.

1602
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:51,080
That’s the punishment I’m giving you.

1603
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:59,750
All these days, I thought god
doesn’t exist as he took you away from me.

1604
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:05,290
But, he exists.

1605
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:12,000
He made me realize the truth
about you at least before I die.

1606
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:17,700
Did I love a girl like you?
Damn!

1607
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:32,420
I should get this punishment
to have loved a girl like you

1608
02:23:49,870 --> 02:23:53,500
Daddy please forgive me.

1609
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:07,360
[Coughing] [Groaning]

1610
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:09,470
Im sorry Daddy.

1611
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:33,080
[Knocking]
Indu.

1612
02:24:33,950 --> 02:24:34,870
[Knocking]
Indu, open the door.

1613
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:37,200
Open the door Indu.

1614
02:24:56,790 --> 02:24:57,540
Siva.

1615
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:01,160
Siva.

1616
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:03,160
Siva.

1617
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:05,330
Siva.

1618
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:11,290
Siva.

1619
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:14,660
Siva.

1620
02:25:15,870 --> 02:25:16,620
Get up my boy.

1621
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:19,720
My dearest.

1622
02:25:20,890 --> 02:25:21,600
Siva…
