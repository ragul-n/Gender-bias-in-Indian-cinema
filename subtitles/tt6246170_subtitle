1
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:57,375
There is one God

2
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:03,375
Truth is His Name

3
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,666
God is the creator

4
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:12,500
God is without fear

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,333
God is without enmity

6
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:23,000
God is immortal

7
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,625
God is beyond birth

8
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:34,375
God is by Himself, self-existent, and self-sufficient

9
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:40,541
He is attained by the Grace of the true Guru

10
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,166
Recite his name

11
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:50,875
This was true in the beginning of creation

12
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:55,791
This was true in the beginning of the ages

13
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:01,375
This is true today

14
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:05,791
True Here And Now.

15
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:13,291
Satguru Nanak says that

16
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,291
He will prevail forever more

17
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,583
For six long years, The Mughal Empire

18
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:02,000
could not curb the power of Banda Singh Bahadur!

19
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,166
He fulfilled the dream of his Guru

20
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,250
By establishing the Kingdom of Punjab, right next to the capital of the Empire

21
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,208
He punished those who tormented the common man,

22
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:17,750
and established the first Kingdom of Sikhs.

23
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,541
Then marched from Lahore, the ugliest of all processions known to Man.

24
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,333
To humiliate Banda Singh, he was dressed as an Emperor,

25
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,208
and was marched to Delhi along with his

26
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:39,000
two and half year old son and 740 Singhs in chains.

27
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Grant me this boon, God

28
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,541
May I never refrain from the righteous acts

29
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:01,875
Grant me this boon, God

30
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,875
May I never refrain from the righteous acts

31
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,000
Grant me this boon, God

32
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,000
May I never refrain from the righteous acts

33
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,875
May I fight all foes without fear in life's battles

34
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,375
With confident courage, claiming the victory!

35
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,166
Grant me this boon, God

36
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,500
May I never refrain from the righteous acts

37
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,791
May I fight all foes without fear in life's battles

38
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,791
With confident courage claiming the victory!

39
00:05:55,291 --> 00:06:03,875
Whoever utters this shall be happy and fulfilled, 'Truth is the ultimate God'

40
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,375
Rabindranath Tagore, the revered poet who wrote the National Anthem of India

41
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,583
also wrote a poem paying tribute

42
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,750
to the bravery and martyrdom of Banda Bahadur.

43
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,833
Called "Bandhi Bir"

44
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,791
Finally Banda was captured by the Mughals...

45
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,875
Finally Banda was captured by the Mughals...

46
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,375
Like a tiger he was caged, And brought to Delhi.

47
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,041
Grant me this boon, God

48
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,375
May I never refrain from the righteous acts

49
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,750
May I fight without fear all foes in life's battles

50
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,541
With confident courage claiming the victory!

51
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,791
Whoever utters this shall be happy and fulfilled, 'Truth is the ultimate God'

52
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,041
'Truth is the ultimate God'

53
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:58,125
Emperor of India, we have killed almost all of the Singhs in Punjab. And we have brought

54
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:03,166
a few here in Delhi to be punished as you please, Lord.

55
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:10,625
Spare the ones who accept our religion. And Those who don't, behead them!

56
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,500
I am asking for the last time!

57
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,583
Anyone who accepts our religion will be spared!

58
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:23,500
Whoever utters this shall be happy and fulfilled, 'Truth is the ultimate God'

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ay! Soldiers! Get me one of them!

60
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,375
Executioner! Take me in...

61
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:27,000
Take me in first!

62
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,166
First me! Let me die first

63
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,958
No no!! First me! First me!

64
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,041
Behead that one!

65
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,958
May Thy Glory be grained in my mind and my

66
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,583
Each Sikh pleaded to be beheaded before the other.

67
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,958
Each day the sun rose, a 100 Sikhs were killed.

68
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,166
Highest ambition be singing thy praises

69
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:53,166
In 7 days, 700 were martyred.

70
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,125
Three months have passed since we Killed 700 Sikhs.

71
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,875
We killed 100 each day. Yet none of them showed any sign of nervousness.

72
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,166
After every beheading, we were starting to loose hope Yet they remain as stubborn as ever

73
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,125
Three months have passed of them rotting in hell,

74
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,958
Yet neither Banda, nor any of his forty remaining men..

75
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:19,000
have agreed to accept our religion.

76
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,166
Behead them all!

77
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,166
When this mortal life comes to end

78
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,041
When this mortal life comes to end

79
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:39,916
May I die fighting with limitless courage..

80
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,208
I hope your not feeling fearful, son?

81
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,208
Fear? What is that?

82
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:48,625
Ah yes how would you know! It is not in the blood of Singhs

83
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,208
Yes, just like how Baba Fateh Singh was.

84
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm inspired by him to uphold the principles of our religion.

85
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,791
Here, its an order that you will kill your son!

86
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,916
Singhs never harm or attack women and children..

87
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:10,583
its you people who have mastered this monstrosity!

88
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:11,791
Take it!

89
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:18,041
The Kazi handed over Banda's son To the custody of the Executioner

90
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,541
Grant me this boon, God

91
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,875
Banda kissed his son's red turban..

92
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:28,875
Looked at him and whispered in his ears, 'Glory to the Guru',

93
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,541
He asked him to be strong.

94
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,125
With confident courage, claiming the victory!

95
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:39,791
The son said he had no worry...

96
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:44,000
'Glory to the Guru' were the last words he said

97
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,958
Whoever utters this shall be happy, shall be fulfilled (chorus)

98
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:54,000
'Truth is the ultimate God'

99
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Banda Singh!

100
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:05,375
I admit it, the look in your eyes terrifies me!

101
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,541
It burns deep into my conscience!

102
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,708
I shall destroy your eyes first, thrust you into darkness.

103
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:16,291
Then cut you to pieces...

104
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,000
Why did you stop? You can destroy my eyes...

105
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,875
but what about the million other eyes which can see the sins you all commit?

106
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,875
How will you destroy them?

107
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,250
Was flayed with pliers.

108
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,708
He was cut into pieces.

109
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,541
Even such a torture could not shake

110
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,000
Banda's faith in his being a Singh..

111
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,000
a Khalsa, till his last breath

112
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,125
The very Khalsa Panth which was established at

113
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,666
Anandpur, by Guru Gobind Singh Years back

114
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,250
Anandpur, where calmness and serenity were in abundance...

115
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,083
Where the energy and laughter of the Four Sons

116
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:13,083
of The Guru lifted the atmosphere with love and peace

117
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,625
But the joyous times were short lived, as if cursed.

118
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,750
Wazir khan, the Governor Of Sirhind cheated on a peace treaty...

119
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,250
in order to get Anandpur Fort vacated and attacked.

120
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,291
While crossing the overflowing River Sirsa, The Guru's family got separated.

121
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,083
The Guru took refuge in the Mud Fort

122
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,208
at Chamkaur with his 40 Singhs and two sons.

123
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,125
Wazir khan attacked him with a force of a million.

124
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,000
Along with other Singhs, his elder son Baba Ajit Singh was martyred

125
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,000
and later his 14 year old son Baba Jujhar Singh

126
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,041
The greedy cook Gangu, in lieu of a big reward handed over..

127
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,041
the custody of the mother and the younger two sons of

128
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,083
The Guru to Wazir Khan, who along with the Kazi

129
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:19,583
conspired to pass a death sentence on the two children.

130
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,125
The wall in which they were buried alive..

131
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,875
fell as if refusing to partner in the heinous crime.

132
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,916
Seeing his unsuccessful, Wazir khan asked

133
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,833
the executioners to behead the two young ones.

134
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,333
This is to the extent, Guru Gobind Singh sacrificed his family

135
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,333
as his commitment, to protect humanity.

136
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,000
1708 SIRHIND.

137
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
Three years had passed since...

138
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,375
The place where Guru Gobind Singh's two innocent

139
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,000
youngest sons were walled alive..

140
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,041
and then martyred, was left as it was by Wazir Khan

141
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:09,583
This was done in order to instill fear of his authority in public.

142
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:14,875
But instead people would bow before the broken wall to pay their respects...

143
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,125
Some even claimed they heard the sound of 'Waheguru'

144
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,375
'Waheguru' coming from the broken wall....

145
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,916
Every month on the date of their martyrdom,

146
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:28,291
someone would come and light a diya(candle) on the broken wall

147
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:33,125
but one knew who this was...

148
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,125
Today as well, is the same date of this month....

149
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,125
Who was this? Who dared to challenge Wazir khan's authority?

150
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,041
Razia quickly, light the candle and leave

151
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,041
Kammrudin! Who lit this candle?

152
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:24,041
I don't know Sir. I've just returned from my namaz prayers.

153
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,625
Hey, you lady! Come back here.

154
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,791
Kammrudin, tell me, didn't this woman cross the square just now?

155
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,083
My eyesight has gotten weaker with age, Sir.

156
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,666
But I can still see the difference between good and bad

157
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,708
And no! I've never seen this woman here before.

158
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,083
Did you light this candle?

159
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,250
The light has been forver lit in our hearts by the Guru

160
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,083
and it will remain so for generations to come..

161
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,166
Hey Girl! How dare you talk to an officer like that?

162
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,125
Leave before you're jailed like all the others

163
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,958
who remain loyal to the Guru and His family!

164
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,750
Go! Go away!

165
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,958
Kammrudin...!

166
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,958
Yes sir?

167
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,625
We can arrest people

168
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,250
but how can we curb the voices which come from this wall!

169
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,958
That's exactly why every time she comes Here to light the candle

170
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,708
I let it burn for a while... and then put it out!

171
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:20,958
That way her tribute is paid and no one loyal to the governor sees it.

172
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,208
I don't know about others but

173
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,208
every time I pass this place, I hear the sound of "Waheguru... Waheguru".

174
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:41,083
Did you hear, Sir? 'Waheguru... Waheguru...'

175
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,000
Rumours, my Lord, rumours!

176
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,541
What voices saying 'Waheguru'? And from where?

177
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,958
Who is left to lead the Sikhs, anyways?

178
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,250
You killed the Guru's elder two sons at Chamkaur..

179
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,125
and the younger two here at Sirhind.

180
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,958
The Sikhs and Hindus are now Frightened and as quiet as mice!

181
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,125
There have been no disturbances from them at all.

182
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:06,000
And to outsmart the Emperor you have given Lordship..

183
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,541
to two Sikhs Aali Singh and Maali Singh in your court.

184
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,750
So, my lord, what is it that's still troubling you?

185
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,958
causing you sleepless nights?

186
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,125
Gobind!

187
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,208
The Guru of the Sikhs! Every time I've attacked him, he's survived!

188
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:29,125
I killed his sons, yet he's never come before me and accepted defeat.

189
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:33,125
Even if I kill all the Sikhs, I won't be at peace as long as he lives!

190
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:52,083
My lord! These two men will make the impossible, possible!

191
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:57,958
Will you be able to kill the man who's escaped my sword time and again?

192
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,875
Yes, Gobind will die with our first strike

193
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,875
And then all the Sikhs Will in grief

194
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:09,166
I feel reassured by your words already!

195
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,958
Suchanand, fill their coffers! Give them whatever they want!

196
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,875
Yes my Lord...

197
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,750
The Guru is somewhere in the west with the Emperor.

198
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,750
Let him never come here to the North. He must die! And go up there!

199
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,041
Khan Saab, attack the Guru...!?

200
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:36,000
It's not too late to reconsider the order you've just given...

201
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,000
If I am to rule, I have to get rid of Him.

202
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,000
Before He plans his next move against me.

203
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,583
Oh Master, Oh Master

204
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,791
Oh Master, Oh Master

205
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:07,750
A man with his followers has raided our ashram and ruined its sanctity.

206
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,333
He's had the audacity to kill our goats and cook them in our kitchen,

207
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,250
And on top of all of that, He's seated himself in your cot!

208
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,833
Who is has dared to do so?

209
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,250
Master teach him a lesson he won't forget...

210
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,000
Lift him up with the cot using your powers..

211
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,166
then smack him down on the ground...

212
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,791
Then we'll go ask him!

213
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:33,708
Go ask him?! No!! I will use my powers and get him here along with the cot!

214
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,708
Now! Right before you all!

215
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:22,708
Madho Das awaken! Shed your ego and your anger... Enlighten yourself...

216
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:23,875
Did you hear something?

217
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:29,416
No, we didn't hear you say a word, my Lord.

218
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:30,208
Madho Das..

219
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:36,666
Only the pure soul can hear the voice of God and God can hear the voice of a pure soul.

220
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,208
Do you realize why your mantras are failing?

221
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,000
And why your heart is so heavy today?

222
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Why you're feeling nervous, like you never have before?

223
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,000
The man at your ashram is no ordinary one!

224
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,958
You seem disturbed that

225
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:23,208
He and his followers have ruined the sanctity of this place.

226
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,625
I don't mean to be critical. But you have killed..

227
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,708
animals in my holy place

228
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,541
Blood has been shed in this ashram

229
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,250
How can I now meditate at this the place?

230
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,541
Guru Sahib said, 'That is exactly what I want to understand from you.

231
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,208
Thousands of helpless innocent men, women and children..

232
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,875
are being butchered everyday by the Mughals.

233
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,708
Which is that mantra you recite?

234
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:52,958
Which does not alert your mind to notice such a carnage?

235
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,416
Rajouri was your native place.

236
00:20:55,916 --> 00:21:02,000
Taavi, Satluj, Beas, Ravi, Jamuna, Ganga, Narmada. You travelled

237
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,833
through these rivers and finally settled here on the banks of River Godavari.

238
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,000
Take my advice, start your journey again. Along your way, you will

239
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,000
find hard working poor farmers crying for help. Go wipe their tears..

240
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,250
God is waiting for you to make them smile again...

241
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,250
Who are you?

242
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,833
Guru Sahib said The One you know.

243
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,833
Look not through your eyes but from within your conscience.'

244
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:49,208
Oh! You are Guru Gobind Singhji?

245
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:54,250
Yes Madho Das, the moment Saint Jaitt Ram of Daddu Dwara told

246
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,250
Guru Sahib about you, we came straight here.

247
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,250
I am honoured.

248
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,250
Guru Sahib then told him, 'Bring glory to your name..'

249
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,708
You are a spiritual warrior, surrender to the task you are destined for.

250
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,708
You have a temperament of hunter.

251
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,000
The common man, tortured by the rulers..

252
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,625
is as ignorant and innocent as the deer

253
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,791
and her two babies who writhed in pain,

254
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,958
After being struck by your arrow and died before you.

255
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,541
You could not bear that sight and so you never hunted again.

256
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:41,250
You broke your bow, and your arrows too.

257
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,833
That pain hurt your conscience so much that it turned

258
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:50,083
you into Madho Das from the carefree Lachman Das.'

259
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,541
My Guru... I am...

260
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:58,208
Guru Sahib asked, 'Yes, who are you?

261
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,208
I am your Banda (man)

262
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:10,166
Who are these tormentors who are shedding the blood of the innocent people?

263
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,625
What way will you punish them?

264
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,000
Toppling their cots with your tantric powers?

265
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,166
The Madho Das famous for his tantric powers,

266
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,750
died as he surrendered before you..

267
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,583
O'my god

268
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,583
my Guru. Now this BANDA sits before

269
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,666
You, Mould this Banda of yours into such a Singh,

270
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:40,916
whose sword shall not hurt an innocent and never spare a tyrant!

271
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,083
Guru Sahib then assures him,

272
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:47,000
'Banda I will make you such a brave soldier

273
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:53,833
that your name will spell dread in the hearts of the tormentors!

274
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,833
You will soon be a Khalsa - the Messiah of the poor and the tormented!'

275
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:11,625
Guru sahib had settled down on the banks of River Godavari

276
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,583
The camp had an air of mysticism.

277
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,416
Everyday during prayer-time, the herd of deer..

278
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,166
would come and sit quietly in attendance.

279
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,083
The peacocks and birds stopped singing and gathered around the prayer hall.

280
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:30,875
His followers felt blessed. It was like heaven on earth.

281
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:34,875
The horses are like an extension of your body in the battlefield.

282
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:39,291
So it is very important to have a perfect coordination with your horse.

283
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:40,416
It's a matter of time.

284
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:45,791
This first thing you need to learn is how to defend your self.

285
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,833
Come lets have a deul!

286
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:55,041
No! In this way you are attacking but you have left your defense open!

287
00:24:55,541 --> 00:25:00,000
When you have your sword in hand, your eyes must focus on the enemy.

288
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,166
Let your sword take care of drawing blood.

289
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:07,375
And then the enemy's sword should not even scathe you.

290
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:11,791
Battles are fought with courage and fought to protect our principals.

291
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,541
The situation in Punjab is of grave concern.

292
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:15,708
The need right now is to support the common man

293
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,708
is to support the common man

294
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,708
I would now like to make you familiar with the Rules of Battle.

295
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:31,958
Even after so many years. Wow Just a little more training

296
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,083
Guru Sahib advised them, 'If you want to help others from tyrants

297
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:41,291
first make sure your defense is strong.

298
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,125
It is not wise to get caught up in a rage

299
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:49,125
You can get yourself killed in a battle

300
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,541
When Banda asked for a clarification, Guru Sahib explained

301
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:56,625
'Only when there no hope

302
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,083
of another battle

303
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:02,166
Should you die as a martyr

304
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:06,166
And so inspire generations to fight for your cause.'

305
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,166
And it was beautiful place where

306
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,916
Guru Sahib decided to camp

307
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,166
Its not about the place, it is about the Guru

308
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:30,208
Wherever he setlles, there settling down a heavenly place like Anandpur

309
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:35,833
I am sure, if Mata Sundri, Mata Sahib Kaur and Bhai Mani Singhji

310
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,833
would have come here, they would never want leave this place.

311
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,708
I have heard that Anandpur was interesting and really full of life,

312
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,291
as if festivities were happening every day.

313
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:56,208
I want to know all about Guru Sahib, you have been with for quite a while now.

314
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,000
Please, tell me.

315
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,291
Madho das, there were frequent conferences.

316
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:06,291
Poets came from all over the country. There was happiness all around,

317
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,000
And you know what made everyone in Anandpur even happier?

318
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,000
When brother...?

319
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,958
When the four sons of Guru Sahib would laugh and happily play around.

320
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,000
The crowds would be ecstatic!

321
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,833
Sahibzaade (Princes)

322
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,875
Sahibzaade (Princes)

323
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,833
Sahibzaade (Princes)

324
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:31,833
Sahibzaade (Princes)

325
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,833
There was a town called Anandpur...

326
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:43,000
Full of life..

327
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,833
There were four stars that shone over this town...

328
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:54,625
They showered happiness in abundance

329
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,291
These stars had dawned on the earth

330
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:01,291
To make it even beautiful

331
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,541
These four Princes....

332
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,916
Officer Zorwar Singh and Officer Fateh Singh!

333
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:22,208
I command you to bring Aurangzeb and Wazir Khan before me now.

334
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,833
No one wants to act like Aurangzeb.

335
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,000
He's right, Brother! And no one wants to play Wazir Khan either!

336
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,583
Mind your words! Right now, I'm not anyone's brother! I'm a ruler.

337
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,875
and an extremely hot-tempered ruler!

338
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,166
Oops! This ruler is in a bad temper.

339
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,125
Don't worry! It's our turn tomorrow!!

340
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,625
Both of you, do what I say.

341
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:49,625
Bring the culprits before me or you both will be stripped of your ranks!

342
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,541
Hold on. Wait, stop please!

343
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,166
Singhji, do you mind pretending to be Aurangzeb for a little while?

344
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,000
Be Wazir Khan for a while?

345
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,000
What are saying, Sahibzaada (Prince)? Why should I be Aurangzeb?

346
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,166
O never! I'm sorry but Wazir khan is our greatest enemy. I could never pretend to be him

347
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:16,000
He's such a cruel man, if I ever happen to see him, I'll slay him!!

348
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,625
Singhji please....

349
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,625
Please be Wazir Khan

350
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,875
Please...

351
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:26,875
Ok its fine...

352
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,041
Gangu! Come pretend to be Aurangzeb for a while...

353
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:31,041
No, no!

354
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:37,000
O Gangu listen to me... Mata ji is waiting for me. I must get to the kitchen right now

355
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,166
You want to go for a break to your village?

356
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,875
If you agree to do what we ask,

357
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,666
We will convince Guru Mother to give you eight whole days of leave...

358
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:51,916
If that's the case, then its fine..

359
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,041
Be Wazir Khan!

360
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,166
Not Wazir khan, but Aurangzeb!

361
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:55,083
No! Wazir Khan!

362
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:56,166
I saw him coming first.

363
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,833
Hold on...First, decide between yourselves

364
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,916
whether I'm Wazir Khan or Aurangzeb.

365
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:07,875
Gangu, I will decide that! I want Aurangzeb before the ruler now!

366
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,625
My Lord, I bring Aurangzeb.

367
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,000
Aurangzeb. I intend to punish you for the crime

368
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,958
you committed against our Guru Grandfather.

369
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,041
But Singhs never attack anyone unarmed.

370
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,708
I challenge you to a duel!

371
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,625
If you win, I will spare you.

372
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,166
But if I win, you must leave our country, never to return!

373
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,083
Lord, I don't have the courage to fight you.

374
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,666
I give up, and am ready to leave your country without a fight.

375
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,166
Now, it's already late... Mata ji will be angry at me

376
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,666
My Lord... Aurangzeb has run away!

377
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,625
Mark my words! One day all the Mughals

378
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,916
will run away from our beloved Country.

379
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:50,666
My Lord. You've worked so hard.

380
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:56,041
Aurangzeb ran away! You must be hungry? Shall we go and eat something?

381
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,833
No! I still have a lot to do!

382
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:04,125
Think again my Lord. I've cooked your favorite ghee churma (crumbs and butter)!

383
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,583
Ghee churma!!

384
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:10,000
The Court is adjourned!

385
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,333
Grandma, hurry!

386
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,333
Patience my child, I'm stirring hard! The butter's about to surface.

387
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,208
The eldest will eat first. That's how he'll grow bigger!

388
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,250
Why! If the younger eats first then he'll grow bigger!

389
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,000
The one who is neither the eldest or the youngest will die of hunger!

390
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,166
Even the butter knows how hungry you all are...

391
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,333
A large amount has come to the surface.

392
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,333
Impatient boys! Premo come, give this butter to the children.

393
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,916
Just eating fresh butter, are you?

394
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:48,750
Well... who's going to eat this churri?

395
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,791
Me! Guru Mother. I'm really Hungry. Please give me some.

396
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:55,875
Gangu why haven't you got the churri yet?

397
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,333
Coming Mataji

398
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,916
Gangu. For a bribe of just eight days leave..

399
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,208
you were prepared to become Aurangzeb.

400
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:10,333
If you were offered a bigger bribe, what would you end up doing?

401
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:14,041
Oh, I was just playing with the children...

402
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,625
Taking a bribe even while playing. Bad idea!

403
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:21,250
Yes... well...

404
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,000
Son! You're late. What kept you?

405
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,333
Guru Mother, There's been some recent movements of the Mughal army in the hills states

406
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,708
around us. I was in a meeting with Guru Father...

407
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,958
talking about this.

408
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,291
Brother! Tell me. Why is our Sikh army,

409
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,625
Much smaller than the Mughal Army?

410
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:44,125
Tigers are always few in number, but they rule the forest!

411
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,000
Zorawar Singh, come on pounce like a tiger!

412
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,333
Okay Brother. Here we go!

413
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,250
Brothers! Let me play too... let me join in...

414
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,750
Please Fateh Singh. Stay away, you're still too young!

415
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,291
Look at him. His stick is even taller than he is!

416
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:05,541
When you've grown as tall as us, then we can play all these games together.

417
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:09,541
Fateh Singh! Now step aside...

418
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,208
Wohoo! Take it easy! You are getting excited

419
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,583
Did you not say pounce like a tiger?

420
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,583
Ah yes! But be careful....

421
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,625
I'm now as tall as both of you...

422
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,000
Come stand next to me and check!

423
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,125
You can't send me away now. Let me play

424
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,000
Don't be stubborn. You could get hurt, Brother.

425
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,166
So what? We can all get hurt when we play games, right?

426
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,166
This is not a game. This is Gatka (Sword fighting) for real, you know?

427
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,833
This is how one becomes battle ready.

428
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,583
Now I definitely want to play.

429
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,000
I want to go to battle too!

430
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,000
Let me join you, or else I'll complain to Brother Ajit.

431
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,750
O'Fateh Singh step back. Brother, lets play!

432
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,916
Someone's going to get told-off today...

433
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,875
Someone's going to get told-off today...

434
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,041
Told-off today!! Told-off today!!

435
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,083
Don't talk to him.

436
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,666
Fateh Singh, what's up with you?

437
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:24,125
Brother Ajit has told me that if anyone doesn't listen to me,

438
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:28,041
or doesn't let me play with them, I must go and tell him straightaway...

439
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,000
Brother leave him alone, play

440
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:29,958
Come on! Let's play...

441
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,125
Someone's going to get told-off today...

442
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,708
Someone's going to get a told-off today...

443
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:37,708
Oh! Okay then! Come and play with us

444
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:44,875
Pay attention. Concentrate. And careful, you can get hurt...

445
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,000
Seeing Baba Fateh play Gatka inspired

446
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,666
Guru Gobind Singh to start the armed Sikh order, the Nihang

447
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,333
Everyone loves Fateh Singh

448
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,291
All four of the Guru's sons,

449
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:01,583
always brought some element of surprise to everyday life...

450
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,916
Anandpur was never so lively again.

451
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:07,666
The families separated as they crossed the River Sirsa

452
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:12,541
The elder brothers were martyred at Chamkaur

453
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,625
The younger two and their Grandmother were caught at Sirhind

454
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,666
The departure from Machhiwara was not an easy one...Guru Sahib

455
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,708
went via Saloni

456
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,166
to the village Jattpurra.

457
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:26,541
On the way, he met a noble estate owner called Rai Kallah, who offered the Guru his Palace.

458
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,541
My Guru Sahib

459
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,541
You are a Guru, of the Hindus and Muslims together.

460
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,958
How I can serve you, my Master?

461
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:37,291
If you have an honorable

462
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:41,125
and trustworthy man, then please send him to Sirhind.

463
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:46,083
I have heard many rumors, and I want to know...

464
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:50,291
What has actually happened in Sirhind to my mother and my younger two sons.

465
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:55,250
Guru Sahib, My servant Noora Mahi's sister, is married in Sirhind.

466
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,250
I can send him right away, and no one will suspect him.

467
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:12,083
Razia...Razia...look it's me.

468
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,250
I've come all the way from Raikot...

469
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,875
It's been so long since we last met and I

470
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,000
thought you might be annoyed with me...

471
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,416
But why aren't you talking?

472
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,166
What's wrong? Really mad at me?

473
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:29,416
Razia...

474
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:33,416
Noora...

475
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:45,000
Please tell me what's happened to her and be honest Lakhi

476
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,291
When Guru Sahib's younger sons were walled alive so cruely,

477
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:55,083
Razia was standing amongst the crowd there.

478
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,000
Brother Lakhi!

479
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,000
Toddarmal has bought a piece of land from Wazir Khan..

480
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,625
He is cremating the Guru's mother and his sons there, hurry!

481
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:08,625
What is going on here, Lakhi??

482
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:12,625
Great Effort Sir...

483
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:01,750
Guru Sahib said, 'Mughals will be uprooted.

484
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,750
One can count the years of their reign on the fingers of your hands now.'

485
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,208
There is no sign of any pain on the..

486
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:18,333
one who sacrificed his family for humanity?

487
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:23,083
No. Whenever we bring up the topic of His mother or His sons,

488
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,958
He ends the conversation, before it can even begins..

489
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,958
saying 'always accept the ways of God!'

490
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,000
Before we conclude today's session,

491
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,250
Does anyone here have any questions?

492
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:49,958
Guru Sahib. If someone commits a sin, must he pay for it, in this life?

493
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:54,541
Everything is balanced.

494
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,916
Guru sahib explained,

495
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:01,916
'If you commit a sin, you must pay for it!'

496
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,500
Guru Sahib smiled and said, 'So you've finally arrived.

497
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,666
You've come a long way.'

498
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,833
Yes Guruji, please give us your blessings.

499
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,833
Guru Sahib smiled and said, 'May God grant you your wishes.'

500
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:44,166
Guruji, What is the difference between a sinner and a criminal?

501
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,125
A sinner is a person who thinks of committing a sin.

502
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:55,708
A criminal is a person who goes out and commits that sin.

503
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:59,000
Can one read the mind of a sinner?

504
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,541
A sinner's face has their sin written all over it.

505
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,333
It can only be read by one's power of inner consciousness.

506
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:11,708
That's something our revered Guru Sahib can do. Not ordinary people like us.

507
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,875
Guru sahib reminded them, 'When our fifth..

508
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,666
Guru of Sikhs was called to Lahore on a pretext,

509
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:20,000
He knew he was being tricked

510
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,250
But those who love God,

511
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,875
Always respect and accept what He has in store for them.

512
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:29,291
Guruji, will the Turks who have been brutalizing innocent..

513
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:33,000
people with no provocation, pay for it in this life too?

514
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:40,083
Guru sahib explained, 'As you sow, so shall you reap.

515
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:46,000
By God's own rule, whatever sin you commit must be paid. When and where is upto God!'

516
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,000
Guru Sahib, it's not that hot.

517
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,166
I wonder why those Pathans were sweating so much?

518
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:55,625
I observed a strange nervous restlessness in their eyes.

519
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,875
Can you explain this?

520
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,750
Guru Sahib said, 'Oh you pure souls, every being is a mystery.

521
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,625
If you look into the universe of others..

522
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:10,625
you may end up becoming like them.

523
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:15,291
Better to look into our own lives and unfold our own mysteries.

524
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:21,000
Only then can we find peace within ourselves.'

525
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,000
"Those who seek, only they find answers..."

526
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,958
What are you thinking?

527
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't think it's right to betray Him

528
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,291
by stabbing Him in the back.

529
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:44,250
You've been so affected by the Guru after just one meeting?

530
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:51,000
Didn't you notice the way he smiled at us? As if He knew already, what we're here for?

531
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,083
Seeing him smile like that make me shudder.

532
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:57,958
Didn't you see the honest look in his eyes? So peaceful...

533
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:02,708
I only look into the eyes of my victims after I've killed them.

534
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,958
To make sure they're completely dead!

535
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,083
I'm going back tomorrow morning!

536
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:11,541
Such a dedicated follower of the revered Guru!

537
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:16,208
Don't forget. That man Wazir Khan is a devil!

538
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:21,250
Remember what cruel death he put The Guru's children?

539
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,750
If we go back without completing our task..

540
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,208
He will brutally kill our families!

541
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:31,833
Now take Gods name and sleep silently

542
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,916
Now, if you haven't the stomach for the job?

543
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:39,000
You can just be on guard. I will do it!

544
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,000
Thank you

545
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,666
This is a map of Punjab

546
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:46,625
Madho Das observe this map carefully... this is Anandpur Sahib..

547
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,833
Sirhind and this is Chamkaur.

548
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,833
We have to eradicate the every tyrant from this territory

549
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,750
Banda was fully trained as a warrior and absorbed..

550
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,625
the principals of Khalsa through the scriptures.

551
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:11,541
Then Guru Sahib baptised Banda to be a Singh by offering him the Holy Amrit.

552
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:21,000
When the True Guru is merciful,

553
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,916
Then your desires will be..

554
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:30,000
It was a sight to witness what Waheguru had created..

555
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,625
on one side of Guru Sahib stood Bhai Daya Singh who was the

556
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:37,000
first one to be baptized with Holy Amrit in Guru Sahib's presence

557
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,625
and on other side was Banda Singh who was the last one to be

558
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:46,000
baptized with Holy Amrit by the Chosen Five, in the presence of Guru Sahib.

559
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,000
When the True Guru is merciful You will never grieve.

560
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,875
The day I was baptized as a Singh even

561
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:12,166
I felt the way do now. On top of the world!

562
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:17,625
Bhai Daya Singhji, this turban. It is like a royal crown on one's head..

563
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:22,291
I will make this crown become the pride of Punjab.

564
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,208
Where did you wear this crown the first time?

565
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:26,541
Anandpur

566
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:32,208
When ever you say Anandpur, I am reminded of the separation of the family.

567
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:36,166
After their separation at the River Sirsa..

568
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:38,958
When did Mother Sundriji meet Guru Sahib? And where?

569
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,333
Travelling through RaiKot and village Deena Kangad..

570
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,708
Guru Sahib settled down near the village Talwandi.

571
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:47,083
Soon the followers began together there...

572
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,250
And Wazir Khan?

573
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,375
The Emperor shifted the Army stationed at Sirhind back to Delhi..

574
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,666
Wazir Khan calmed down..

575
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:57,541
Banda Singh, in no time there were so many followers in Talwandi..

576
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,083
that it took a while to move around

577
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:02,083
A few steps, the place was full of life...

578
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:08,208
This news reached Mother Sundri, she was in Delhi then.

579
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,958
Welcome Sukha Singh? What brings you here?

580
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,916
Guru Sahib is now camped at Sabo Ki Talwandi.

581
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:17,291
Celebrations are being held.

582
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:22,291
Everything is as it used it be. People are flocking there.

583
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,666
This is the best news I've heard in a long while!

584
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,541
You made me really nervous when you entered...

585
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,875
I was worried of what you might say, I almost froze!

586
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:35,625
Now just wait here, I must go and share this with Mata Sundriji...

587
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:40,625
Wait! Bhai Sahib. This good news is not the cause of my nervousness...

588
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh!

589
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,833
All the four sons of Guru Sahib and his mother...

590
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,875
What has happened to The Sahibzaade and Mataji?

591
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,875
Just a few left, all the other clothes of your children are ready

592
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:59,541
Mata ji, God has answered your prayers! Sukha brings great news!

593
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:02,666
Guru Sahib is at Sabo Ki Talwandi.

594
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:04,916
Prayer meetings are being held there.

595
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,000
People are flocking there, in thousands. There are festivities all over.

596
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,833
O'my Waheguru, I thank you from the bottom..

597
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,583
of my heart, you have fulfilled my wishes.

598
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:18,541
Premo, pack every quickly. We must all leave immediately!

599
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:23,000
Bhai Sukha ji, may God bless you!

600
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,000
I don't know how to thank you for bringing this good news!

601
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,583
You've given me a new lease of life!

602
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,250
Sukha Singh here has been telling me...

603
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,291
About my four sons...right, Sukha Singhji?

604
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:41,916
They...all four of them....

605
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,291
All four of them... they're there

606
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:47,666
If they're also at that place, then what are we waiting for? Hurry

607
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:53,041
Let's go! I wish I could hug all four of them right now!

608
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:59,291
I can feel the warmth of my Children, as if I am hugging them...

609
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,291
I cant wait to meet my sons.

610
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,583
Hurry! We should leave for Talwandi now.

611
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:10,708
The mother was leaving with a lot of excitement....

612
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:15,875
Tell me... how can I tell her the news you've brought us?

613
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,916
Oh, my Guru Sahib.

614
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,000
I don't have the courage to tell the..

615
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,916
mother of your children this terrible news...

616
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,166
Guru Sahib please forgive us

617
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,666
Guru Sahib, you will have to do this yourself, now...

618
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:32,208
The mother had left with a lot of excitement..

619
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:39,000
That soon she will be with her sons

620
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:48,958
Her desires fulfilled when she will hug them tight..

621
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:50,000
What are you thinking?

622
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,083
With her husband there too before her....

623
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:57,708
The mother had left with a lot of excitement..

624
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,708
That soon she will be with her sons

625
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,625
Bhai Mani Singhji How long to Talwandi..?

626
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,000
Almost there about to reach.

627
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,000
As we reach, please can you get lots of churri made for my Sahibzaade.

628
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,916
They absolutely adore it!

629
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,000
Why don't you ask a volunteer right away.

630
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,583
Yes, Mataji, I'll do it now!

631
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,583
Fakir Singh! Get lots of churri cooked and bring it to the Darbaar.!

632
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:47,833
I will kiss the younger ones as play with them And hug the elder ones tightly

633
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:52,333
Hug them tightly...

634
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:58,125
I'll keep them close to my heart for my contentment

635
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:03,000
I'll keep them close to my heart for my contentment

636
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,208
They are the light of my life

637
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:12,291
She sees the gathering of people with Guru Sahib sitting there

638
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:17,000
The mother had left with a lot of excitement

639
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,000
That soon she will be with her sons

640
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:46,416
Guru Sahib said, 'Please get up now...

641
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:49,916
Togetherness and separation,

642
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:53,291
are the truth of life.

643
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:59,666
We must accept all that God does, for he does it in our best interests...

644
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,666
We were destined by God to meet again, and I am thankful to him for that.'

645
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:12,416
I can't see any of my four sons here. Nor our dear mother.

646
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:20,000
Guru Sahib said. 'But I can see Mataji and my children.'

647
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,083
Where are they?

648
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:27,916
Guru Sahib continued, 'There I can see my mother

649
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:33,083
And there are my sons.'

650
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,791
I'm asking about our children.

651
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:40,375
Guru Sahib said, 'I am not pointing at strangers.'

652
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:45,125
But...I am talking about Mataji and the Four Sahibzaade.

653
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:51,416
Guru Sahib said, 'For these sons of mine, I have sacrificed my four sons.

654
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:55,416
So what if those four are no more, there are thousands of sons here alive.'

655
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:15,416
The mother stood motionless When the truth dawned on her.

656
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:22,958
As if someone had plucked her heart out

657
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:30,208
The mother tried to compose herself

658
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:37,875
But there was darkness all over without her sons

659
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:41,875
Fate separated them and then they never met again

660
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,875
The Four Princes

661
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:16,166
Guru sahib then said, 'Bhai Daya Singh

662
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,833
Please tell this mother

663
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:23,083
that she has every right to cry at the martyrdom of her sons.

664
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,750
But alongside that of her four sons..

665
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,500
She must add the sacrifice of thousands of others..

666
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,125
who have been martyred every time I've asked them to fight for a cause.

667
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:37,333
Every time the gates of the Mud Fort in Chamkaur

668
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,041
opened, five Singhs went out and died fighting.

669
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:43,333
So what if one of them was my son too?

670
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:48,083
Should I grieve the loss of my son and not the other four?

671
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:52,083
Never! I've never treated my Khalsa unfairly and never will do!'

672
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:03,833
Mataji. Churri is ready

673
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,541
I asked for churri for my four sons

674
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:11,416
But you have given me hundreds of sons.

675
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:15,416
Go and give it to them all.

676
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:41,375
The mother was as if blessed

677
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:45,208
Seen astonished scenario

678
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:52,666
She saw her sons in the hundreds gathered there. Gobind's Four Sons

679
00:53:53,166 --> 00:54:00,041
As if there was no differentiation between her sons and the disciples there

680
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:07,416
Her sons were serving and eating the churri too

681
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:18,041
The lord had blessed her with thousands of sons

682
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:25,291
The four Princes...Thousand Princes...

683
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,291
The Four Princes...

684
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,000
Bhai Daya Singhji, now that I too am Singh..

685
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,958
I am sure Guru Sahib will take along with you all to Sirhind..

686
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:47,541
Once we are there, we will make the Mughals pay for everything

687
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:50,833
Every dishonor, every pain that they have caused the Sahibzaade!

688
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,333
We must leave for Punjab!

689
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:57,166
Wazir khan is the kind, who will surely be upto something...

690
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,625
You have sent two assassins to kill the Guru?!

691
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:05,000
I have my doubts that after killing innocent children and with this...

692
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,666
New habit of back stabbing you may not able to fight like a warrior anymore!

693
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:12,250
God forbid what will happen if you have to face the Guru in a Battle?

694
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:16,916
There will be a battle with the Guru only if is able to survive!

695
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:18,250
The elder Begum kept convincing you to..

696
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,166
leave the Guru alone, till she breathed her last.

697
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:24,250
I don't care for my life either, stop this murder!

698
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,250
I cant do anything now, the assassins are on their mission, waiting for the right time to strike!

699
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:43,416
Yes Guruji, we will check for you now

700
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:44,958
Have you put it in tent??

701
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,958
Lets go and see

702
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:53,833
You wait here outside on guard, while I do the job and come.

703
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:57,833
Move fast... fast

704
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,000
Did you hear that? What's up with the horses so late at night?

705
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:20,625
Come on! Lets go check...

706
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:19,916
Catch him! Him and his men have attacked Guru Sahib!!!

707
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,583
Isn't he one of those two Pathans?

708
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:31,666
Yes! He is the same

709
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:34,375
It is him!

710
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:38,125
Who are you, where are you from?

711
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:42,125
W-W-Wa-Wazir Khan sent us here...Wazir Khan...

712
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:05,166
The wound of Guru Sahib was quite big, the bleeding had stopped.

713
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:10,666
But it was difficult for the Hakim to judge the depth of the wound.

714
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:14,166
The Singhs brought an English doctor from the camp of Emperor..

715
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:18,666
Bahadur Shah which was nearby on the banks of the River Godavari.

716
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,000
He assured the wound will heal, and Guru Sahib

717
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,291
would have to rest for at least 6 months.

718
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:30,291
But, even a minute slip in care could be fatal.

719
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,208
Banda Singh...!

720
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:49,833
I told you, didn't I? That he would be upto something! Wazir khan!

721
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:53,833
You wicked Wazir Khan...!!

722
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,583
The messenger had got the news that

723
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,625
Guru Sahib's letters had been very well-received.

724
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:07,541
People were eagerly waiting for him to come to Punjab.

725
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:13,541
But Guru Sahib's wound was not letting him ride a horse.

726
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:19,541
So He decided to choose someone else to lead the..

727
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:24,416
Sikhs with the consent of The Chosen Five .

728
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:27,333
The man I've chosen to lead you all

729
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:31,333
in our fight in Punjab is Banda Singh Bahadur.

730
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,625
Guru Sahib said, 'As a token of my faith in him

731
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:44,416
I would like to give him a few things.

732
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:48,416
These are the five arrows from my quiver.

733
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:02,000
This is the Naggara - the war drum of the Sikhs and

734
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,875
This the nishan sahib - symbol of the Khalsa.

735
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:11,416
Now, I will tell you in which form I will be with you...

736
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:17,000
Guru Sahib then called for Bhai Binod Singh, Bhai Kahan Singh,

737
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:23,791
Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Baaj Singh, Bhai Ram Singh, to come forward...

738
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:29,375
They are the Chosen Five. They are the Khalsa. The Panth. They represent me.

739
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,375
What ever you do should be with their consent..

740
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:36,791
You will never disagree with them

741
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:39,875
As you wish Guru Sahib.

742
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,625
Guru Sahib told them, 'You must give

743
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,083
Banda Singh your complete Loyalty and support.

744
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:49,416
When you think Banda Singh does something That does not conform with my teachings,

745
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:55,291
you have to show him the right path

746
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:57,500
There is no time to lose.

747
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,625
I have handpicked another Twenty-five men to accompany you.

748
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,000
You must be cautious and avoid any confrontation..

749
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,916
with the Mughals during your journey.

750
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:10,916
Take a longer route if necessary.

751
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:14,958
You will travel separately in groups of five..

752
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:18,208
Burria is the first destination where you will all meet next

753
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:23,000
Banda Singh... You are now the leader.

754
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,625
If you feel it necessary to go into battle immediately..

755
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:30,500
then you must do so, don't wait for me.

756
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,291
Any questions?

757
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:37,291
You must make an early start tomorrow, for your journey to Punjab.'

758
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:48,666
You look absolutely like a pathan

759
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:50,875
Yes no one will recognize me!

760
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:54,875
Yes, We cannot be spotted by the Mughals

761
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:20,041
Guru Sahib said,

762
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:24,041
'I knew you would come.

763
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,041
Any questions...'

764
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:36,000
Yes, there so many Singhs who have been with you since long..

765
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,291
Why then did you choose me?

766
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:44,833
Guru sahib said, 'There is Honesty in your question Banda Singh.

767
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,750
I was looking for a warrior For a long time, that is

768
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:54,416
why I came and took charge of the cot in your ashram.'

769
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:58,416
Guruji, I can assure You, I will do my best to lead...

770
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:02,916
In the battlefield, until you come to take charge.

771
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:06,916
Guru Sahib said, 'And what if I don't come?'

772
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,958
It is you, who have taught us, That whatever happens is by God's Will.

773
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,000
And I will accept His Will

774
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,625
As your command

775
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:24,250
Guru Sahib asked, 'You will miss me, wont you?'

776
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:32,041
No. I am only leading the Contingent It is you who is the General of the Sikh Army.

777
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:38,416
I know your spirit as soul will always be with us Singhs.

778
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:46,250
Guru sahib said, 'You are indeed ready, Banda Singh.

779
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,416
Come, let us pray before you leave...'

780
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:57,250
Banda left with Guru's blessings...

781
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,583
He left saying I am your disciple'

782
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:03,375
Whoever utters this shall be happy, shall be fulfilled,

783
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:07,375
'Truth is the ultimate God'

784
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:21,583
Banda left with Guru's blessings

785
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,791
He left saying 'I am your disciple'

786
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,541
He will shower kindness

787
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:33,208
Shatter the tyrants like lightening

788
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:39,333
Banda's......Banda's..... Sword will strike like Thunder!

789
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:44,833
Sword will strike like Thunder!

790
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:48,833
Sword will strike like Thunder!

791
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:02,875
The wound of Guru Sahib, looked fine on the outside

792
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:09,041
But Hakim had informed them, it was spreading poison within

793
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:12,375
The Singhs were very concerned on hearing this.

794
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,250
Guru Sahib, called them inside and told them...

795
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,416
There was nothing to worry about

796
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,250
Whatever God Will's, one must accept.

797
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,791
Guru Sahib, then asked Bhai Daya Singh

798
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,250
to gather everyone before the Holy Book of The Granth Sahib.

799
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,250
He had a long-awaited ritual to perform.

800
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:38,041
Guru Sahib announced, 'Khalsaji,

801
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:41,625
Today I am revealing a decision that I made a while ago. On Baisakhi day,

802
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:47,125
when The Five Chosen ones were baptized

803
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:49,291
I have bowed, I have made

804
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:52,875
an offering of five paisas before the Guru Granth Sahib

805
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:57,000
From this day forth, This Holy Book will be your and my next Guru.

806
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:01,000
From now on, no one in flesh and blood will ever be our Guru.

807
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:09,583
Our spirit will always be within Shri Guru Granth Sahib.

808
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:14,750
You shall pray in its presence. Always practice the principles of the Khalsa...

809
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,708
Under orders of the Immortal Being,

810
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,375
the Panth was created

811
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:26,083
And now to the whole gathering, I say glory be to God.

812
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:31,250
Waheguruji ka Khalsa Waheguruji ki Fateh

813
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:35,250
Hail the God to whom belongs the Victory! (chorus)

814
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,000
Banda singhji....

815
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:56,041
We will not strike first, but if they do, we will wipe them right out!

816
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:59,416
Hold on! Where are you heading?

817
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:01,833
To our homes...

818
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,333
Check their belongings

819
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,708
I will not let you search

820
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:10,000
Really? I'll have to set you right then..come on!

821
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,000
Never challenge a man who is travelling for a good cause!

822
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:32,291
Guys..run!. Guys..run!,.

823
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:37,875
We are going to come across a lot of these blockages, any plans?

824
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,291
When He is with us, why the worry?

825
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:47,666
He entrusted us with everything, when we became His disciples.

826
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:51,166
After declaring the Guru Granth Sahib as the next Guru,

827
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:54,666
the day Guru Sahib asked his disciples to assemble again.

828
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:58,333
The morning of that day was mystifying...

829
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:00,000
the birds did not chirp..

830
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,333
the call of the peacocks were not heard, the deers were quiet...

831
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:09,000
They were all looking with saddened eyes at tent of the Guru...

832
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:17,000
Guru Sahib told them, 'Khalsaji, this is our last meeting.'

833
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,875
Last meeting?

834
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:24,500
(crowd murmuring)

835
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I am getting messages from Waheguru through the state of my wound,

836
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:37,000
I will breathing my last very soon now..

837
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,583
Don't say that Guruji, please don't

838
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:43,333
My Lord, do you think it is fair for you to leave us?

839
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,166
Guru Sahib explained them,

840
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:48,750
'The number of days the Lord meant

841
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:55,375
us to be here are over. It's time to leave this world.

842
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:59,916
People who worship the Lord are free from the cycle life and death.

843
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:04,416
The earlier Guru's have not gone away from you, neither will I...

844
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:12,000
I will surrender my physical self and immerse in the space of my Lord.

845
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:17,208
But whosoever will need me, I will always be there for you

846
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:22,333
Allow me to leave, May you all be blessed by the Lord.

847
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:26,333
Truth is His Name.

848
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:38,875
From now you will always chant

849
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,333
The name of The Lord

850
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:46,333
Practice the principles of The Khalsa

851
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:48,208
Ah yes....

852
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:52,250
There us enough space for you three, go on into last room on your right...

853
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,208
What about the Sikhs?

854
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:58,708
I'll tell you about the Sikhs later,

855
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:00,708
I hear that Emperor Bahadur Shah has left the

856
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:04,000
banks of River Godavari and moved onto Delhi.

857
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,416
Seems the uprising in the South has subsided. What about the Sikhs?

858
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:13,333
I believe the Sikhs at Nanded too will move back to Punjab as well

859
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:14,208
Why?

860
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,291
Sad news...

861
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:20,375
Their tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh has passed away

862
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:22,666
I heard he was unwell?

863
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,208
No. Because he was stabbed in the chest.

864
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:29,208
The poison has spread throughout his body...

865
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:40,666
And what if I don't come?

866
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,416
It is you who has taught us, That whatever happens, happens with the Will of God

867
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:45,833
His will is your command

868
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:51,000
I accept His will.

869
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,416
Congratulations!

870
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,083
My happiness has no bounds!

871
01:11:56,583 --> 01:12:00,708
The excitement on hearing the news Of the death of Gobind is far greater

872
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,375
than even if I was offered the throne in Delhi!

873
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:06,416
This is the end of the breed of Sikhs...

874
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:10,416
C'mon...! Celebrate!

875
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,208
It seems like we have lost everything...

876
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:20,041
After the death of a father,

877
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:21,125
the son is tied a turban.

878
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,875
A sign of taking over the responsibility of his family.

879
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:28,000
That is why Guru Sahib has made us all tie turbans.

880
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,000
It is now the responsibility of

881
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,125
every one of us to make His dreams come true...

882
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:37,916
What are you saying? Nothing has happened to my Guru...

883
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:40,791
He worries enormously about his Sikhs...

884
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:45,583
He must have deiced to go for a solitary walk by the River Godavri...

885
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:50,250
Brother Daya Singhji, go and find him...you must go

886
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,958
Just like how you found him in the Machiwara forest last time...

887
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,875
You found him then...

888
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,000
You will find him now... I beg you...go now

889
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,041
Brother Daya Singhji, go find him now

890
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:07,000
We can't live without him...go!

891
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:12,541
Send someone to the River Godavari, to ask after him, please...

892
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,333
Mataji

893
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:17,000
We must ask everyone

894
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,958
someone.. ask..

895
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:22,958
Yes I will ask, I will ask them all

896
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:28,166
But as soon as I meet Mata Gujriji, I will ask her

897
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:32,333
The one who gave birth to such a unique son...

898
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:36,333
I will ask her...

899
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:44,125
O'Mother Gujri, the angelic one,

900
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:50,000
Tell us whether you were aware

901
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:57,958
That there will be, No other like your Son

902
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:04,791
Nor a Mother like you

903
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:08,791
Tell us whether you were aware,

904
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:24,833
That He would send his Father to martyr in Delhi

905
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:31,583
There is no other like your Son...

906
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:34,958
For people who apply a Tilak and wear the sacred thread..

907
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:39,041
He will forgo his own Father-the Protector, for their sake

908
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:44,333
Tell us whether you were aware..

909
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:48,333
O' tell us mother, were you aware...

910
01:14:58,125 --> 01:15:04,791
Guru Sahib had told us, to re-group here at Burria, after we left Nanded.

911
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:09,625
But we did not know then, we will be sharing this sad news

912
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:16,333
He had Five Sons The Fifth being The Khalsa(Singhs)

913
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:21,500
Khalsa is a legendary conception

914
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,125
Even though he sacrificed his Four Sons His legacy will live on in the Khalsa

915
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:34,708
O' tell us mother were you aware...

916
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:39,416
O' tell us mother were you aware...

917
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:43,416
O' tell us mother were you aware...

918
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:04,291
I knew my Son was God's child

919
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:11,125
He was destined to lift the plight of the Countrymen...

920
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:18,583
God's own men are always composed and never talk of incidents yet to happen..

921
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:25,000
I was aware of everything...

922
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:32,083
Yes, I knew it all...

923
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:39,791
Yes, I knew it all.

924
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,833
The Five Chosen Ones have now decided,

925
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:44,875
that we must not turn back

926
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:50,125
It is now our task to make the Guru's dream come true

927
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:54,125
Wipe up all your tears and let us rattle the enemy! Power to us!

928
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:18,125
What's happened? Why have you woken up with a shock?

929
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,375
This is not a letter you hold, But the first step towards our freedom.

930
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:31,125
Each one who reads it, blood will run high through his veins!

931
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:37,041
Go deliver them all over Punjab.

932
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:38,416
Punjab is not far

933
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:42,416
I expect a lot many to join us as they get these letters..

934
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:46,083
But we are short on funds and rations. How will take care of them?

935
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:53,083
When in trouble and when you have no options left, just pray to Waheguru...

936
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:57,083
Have faith in Waheguru and Nanak says, 'He will take care of your needs'

937
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,916
We're now safely past Delhi,

938
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:05,750
and well equipped for

939
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:09,083
the next stage of our journey...

940
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:10,083
Hey what's with him?

941
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:14,083
Banda Singh there is group of men approaching the camp.

942
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:24,291
They seem to be villagers...

943
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:38,375
Run...! They're Dacoits!

944
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:42,416
What...? Why are they fleeing?

945
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:46,958
Oh! Please stop...

946
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,125
Don't kill me!

947
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:53,041
We have all, left our homes unlocked.

948
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:57,166
Go take what you want... don't kill me...I beg you!

949
01:18:57,666 --> 01:19:00,041
We are not Dacoits...

950
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:04,583
Check, I have nothing on me, go loot our village...please

951
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:06,000
Who is looting you?

952
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,333
The blood thirsty Daciot.

953
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:12,583
Randhir Sian. You are his men, right?

954
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:19,791
No no, we are no Dacoits. Relax. We will save you from them

955
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:23,708
What? How? He's going to loot our village tonight.

956
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:26,583
Do not fear...

957
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:31,125
Binod Singhji, this will be the first step of our fight against terror in Punjab

958
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:36,250
and Dacoit Randhir Sian's very last!

959
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:44,916
The Guru has sent Banda who is a saint and a soldier..

960
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,916
There lit hope in the eyes of the common man...

961
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:05,875
The village is empty.

962
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:16,708
Go loot all houses and burn the one where you find nothing! This town belongs to us

963
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:20,708
Randhir Sian!

964
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,750
Who are you?

965
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:53,625
Even the birds fly out of their nests when they hear of me coming.

966
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:57,625
Now on empty villages like these will be full of life again

967
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:15,250
You are trying to confront me, who has the protection of the Mughal rulers?

968
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:36,416
How dare you? Who are you to confront me, Randhir Sian?

969
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:40,791
The friend of the weak, for whom all are the same

970
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:43,291
Taking his blessings, I have come here in Grace

971
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:47,291
Banda Singh Bahadur is my Name!

972
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:57,875
Singh's never attack an unarmed man..Here! Take this

973
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,000
We are thankful to you!

974
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,833
You have freed us from the terror of the Dacoits!

975
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:22,333
Don't be so jubilant! The real dacoit is not dead.

976
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:26,000
The real dacoits are the Mughals! If you want real freedom...

977
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,750
then you will have to fight for your own self!

978
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,750
We are with you!(chorus)

979
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:36,333
Here comes the messiah

980
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:42,416
Who will rid people of their pain...

981
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:45,750
The Guru has gone but has left behind this problematic man.

982
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:50,958
He will win them over with love..

983
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:56,750
Trust in him will make their hearts beat in peace....

984
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:03,208
Banda's sword will strike like thunder...

985
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:06,250
My Lord, Banda Singh has looted our convoy of treasure, on its way here!

986
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,041
Banda's sword will strike like thunder...

987
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:12,083
We were just waiting for this.

988
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:17,041
Banda freed many villages and estates from the clutches of terror.

989
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:20,416
Wazir Khan's grasp on Punjab had begun to crack.

990
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:23,083
Tell me, Aali and Maali Singh

991
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:26,000
I hear another Guru of your Sikhs, has risen from somewhere?

992
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,875
By conquering small estates adjacent to Delhi on the out skirts of Punjab,

993
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:31,833
Does he really believe he can challenge Sirhind?

994
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:35,833
Why do all these Sikhs choose our Sirhind to come and die?!

995
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,833
I suggest you both go talk to him,

996
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,416
and ask him to face me, the Governor of Sirhind in battle..!

997
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:50,833
I'll butcher him a manner, no one has ever seen in this world.

998
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:55,000
I pushed your Guru towards the South, where he finally died.

999
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,625
And I will kill Banda

1000
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:01,875
I'll crush his bones and spread the dust all over Sirhind, so no other dare challenge me!

1001
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:06,416
Stop! Not another word Wazir Khan

1002
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:09,666
I will not hear another word against The Guru

1003
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:12,416
or against His noble leader

1004
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:15,041
How dare you?

1005
01:25:15,541 --> 01:25:16,000
Try and remember...

1006
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,333
What Guru Sahib's younger sons told you standing right here in this court?

1007
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:28,625
When you asked His Son's what both of them would do if you agreed to free them...

1008
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:33,416
Let me first ask them, what will they do if I freed them?

1009
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:37,000
We will do exactly what our Guru Father is doing.

1010
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,000
And what all the Sikh Generations to come will do.

1011
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,375
Fight till the last, against oppression and injustice.

1012
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:44,416
How will you...?

1013
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:49,625
We will go out and gather all our Guru Father's Singhs, and create an Army.

1014
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:54,125
And that's what is happening now!

1015
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:58,666
You killed the innocent boys, but what they said is surely coming true.

1016
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,000
The Singh's of the Guru, are getting together now

1017
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,166
The war against injustice has begun again,

1018
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:06,416
and very soon Banda Singh Bahadur will have his hands wrapped around your neck!

1019
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:08,125
You dare threaten me?

1020
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:13,291
Put these two in the dungeon and prepare them for a painful death!

1021
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:17,333
Your death is soon Wazir Khan!

1022
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:17,875
Leave me....

1023
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:21,333
There will be no escaping it!

1024
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:25,916
Huh...Banda Bahadur...

1025
01:26:26,416 --> 01:26:27,791
We are expecting some people from Kaithal..

1026
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:31,083
Khalsaji, some of the messengers we sent to Punjab, have returned.

1027
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:33,041
And with some news for you...

1028
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:35,333
Yes, yes! Let them in...

1029
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:39,333
Khalsaji...

1030
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:46,875
I have just come from Samana...

1031
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:50,958
Samana looks like a flourishing City from the outside

1032
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:55,250
but the reality is quite different.

1033
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:58,416
Trying to run away from Samana without repaying my debt?

1034
01:26:58,916 --> 01:27:00,375
For Generations we have been paying your debt.

1035
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:06,208
We have no more money.

1036
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:09,833
Have mercy on me, my wife and my child. Free me from your debt...

1037
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:11,708
Free him from my debt

1038
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,958
Kill him! And hang him upside down

1039
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:19,791
This is Samana! No one leaves here without paying me

1040
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:21,375
What was the debt of the poor man?

1041
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:25,208
There is no such debt, they make the farmer work,

1042
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:27,416
then pay him just enough for a meal a day.

1043
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:30,625
When dying of hunger he asks for more...

1044
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:34,416
They give him his due but only as a loan...with incredible interest.

1045
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,208
So that for the rest of his life, he is forever in their debt

1046
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:41,208
These farmers will be poor forever.

1047
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:47,666
Imagine, if the last rites of the dead are not performed as per their religion.

1048
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:51,083
How painful can it be for the families...

1049
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:57,000
This is the state of the people of Shadora...

1050
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,041
How long...? How long will you torture us?

1051
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,666
How long will we have to bury our dead?

1052
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:07,125
Officer, please let me cremate my father as my tradition requires us.

1053
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:14,166
You dared to break the law Of Sedora, and you will pay!

1054
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:18,000
Father....

1055
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:24,708
Punish this man to death, and bury them both

1056
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:31,416
I am ashamed and in a state of shock of what I saw in Kapoori

1057
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,666
What is it that happens there?

1058
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:36,666
Whichever religion the newly-wed bride is from

1059
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:43,041
It must be Kadar-uldin who spends the first night with her!

1060
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:47,041
Get-off now! Take her away. To her husband (grunts)

1061
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:56,208
The people of Kapoori have accepted this as their way of life,

1062
01:28:56,708 --> 01:29:00,208
such is the terror of that man.

1063
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:06,416
More have arrived, Kaithal - Enough!

1064
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:15,166
The state of Punjab is becoming worse than hell!

1065
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:18,791
Madho Das...Which is that mantra you recite..

1066
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:22,916
which does not alert your mind to notice such a carnage?

1067
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:26,000
Take my advice, start your journey again.

1068
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,041
On your way, you will find hardworking poor farmers crying for help...

1069
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:33,083
Go, wipe their tears...

1070
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:37,083
God is waiting for you, to make them smile again...

1071
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:48,833
We are camped here now, our motive is to reach Sirhind.

1072
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:53,875
But before we can reach there, we need to conquer Samana.

1073
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:56,125
But Samana is defended by huge numbers.

1074
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:59,833
True. I am sure that as our messages have been delivered,

1075
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:03,416
we will have thousands and thousands of men joining us soon.

1076
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:05,416
We need funds to conquer Samana

1077
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:09,083
The Amirs, Estate owners, and Officers of Kaithal and Sonepat have

1078
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:12,916
hoarded their money and the loot of locals in the government treasuries.

1079
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:15,416
That is my next target.

1080
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:19,000
What do you have to say to this?

1081
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,000
Lets Go!!

1082
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:33,083
Banda Singh then looted the treasuries of Kaithal and Sonipat.

1083
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:40,500
Soon the Bairaggi Singhs and Bhai Fateh Singh joined him with their forces.

1084
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,791
Why are we wasting time talking about these damn Singhs!?

1085
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:46,416
Yet you've called us here to Samana

1086
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,791
to discuss rumors about them?

1087
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:53,791
He became stronger by the day. Then turned his Army towards Samana

1088
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,083
Banda Singh attacked Samana.

1089
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:17,083
When the suppressed locals heard the Singhs, they gathered courage too.

1090
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:23,916
They picked up what ever weapons they could and attacked the Amirs...

1091
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:28,416
Soon, Samana was conquered and locals freed from bondage.

1092
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:33,125
Banda, take what you want? Money... gold...leave me....give me freedom...

1093
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:37,125
Give him freedom! Hang him upside down in the market square.

1094
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:46,750
The executioners who buried the younger sons of the Guru

1095
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:51,833
in the wall, were in Samana too

1096
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:56,208
Banda comes. - Banda comes

1097
01:31:56,708 --> 01:32:00,000
Have mercy on us! It was Wazir Khan and his officer who planned it all.

1098
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,625
It wasn't our fault!

1099
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:05,500
No, no! Don't blame anyone else.

1100
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,083
You were given a choice...

1101
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:10,875
Everyone else in Sirhind refused to do the job.

1102
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,666
For your freedom,

1103
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:14,875
you chose to choke and kill two innocent children

1104
01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:18,041
by burying them alive in a wall!

1105
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:22,375
I will show you,

1106
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:28,666
how it feels to die of suffocation.

1107
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:32,666
We made a mistake!

1108
01:32:56,916 --> 01:32:57,916
So much destruction.

1109
01:32:58,416 --> 01:33:00,958
So much blood shed.

1110
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,416
I feel I've let you down...

1111
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:08,916
This is not what you asked me to do, with your beloved Punjab....

1112
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:11,708
Guru Sahib, have I made a mistake again,

1113
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:16,583
when I killed the two fawns?

1114
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:23,083
Guru Sahib said, 'No, Banda Singh. You have done nothing of that kind.'

1115
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:25,250
My Lord...My Guru...

1116
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:29,083
Who else could know the state of my mind better than you...

1117
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:30,625
Forgive me...

1118
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:32,333
Guru Sahib explained,

1119
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:37,000
'No. It's the local farmers and workers, tormented for years

1120
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,958
who caused this vengeful destruction.'

1121
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:42,750
But Guruji, I should have explained your message of forgiveness

1122
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,916
And I should have stopped them.

1123
01:33:46,416 --> 01:33:47,916
'In the rage of battle,

1124
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:51,833
reason cannot prevail.

1125
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:57,416
If you had tried to stop them, they would have turned their anger upon you!

1126
01:33:57,916 --> 01:33:59,375
Don't feel guilty.

1127
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:04,000
It is the guilty, who have been punished.

1128
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:08,916
Whatever happens here, is by His Will alone. Accept it as the Will of Waheguru.

1129
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:18,750
When the True Guru is merciful, You will know no pain

1130
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:26,291
When the True Guru is merciful, You will enjoy the Lord's Love

1131
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:30,416
Banda Singh distributed a good part of the looted treasure

1132
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:34,750
amongst the residents of Samana.

1133
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:40,541
My grandmother had a necklace just like this one.

1134
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:46,291
Hold on! It is this one Aaah, it is this one!

1135
01:34:46,791 --> 01:34:49,541
Look at this treasure

1136
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:57,625
All the efforts of Banda Singh, have freed us from debt forever.

1137
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:00,833
How much land, do each of you farmers have?

1138
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:01,791
1600 yds

1139
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:02,708
3200 yds

1140
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:04,000
I acre {4000 yds}

1141
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:04,666
1600 yds

1142
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:05,708
3200 yds

1143
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:09,000
But we don't own the land. We just till it.

1144
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,750
From today onwards, this land is yours.

1145
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,000
Really...? Can this be true? Am I dreaming...?

1146
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,000
I can't believe this..

1147
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:20,208
Brother Fateh Singhji, from now on, they own the land.

1148
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:22,208
You are now the administrator of Samana

1149
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:26,916
Transfer the farmers name, on the land he tills.

1150
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:31,041
The Landlord system now stands abolished!

1151
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:34,916
My Lord, Samana has fallen to Banda Bahadur!

1152
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:37,791
I have news that huge contingents of Sikhs from the Malwa, Majha

1153
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:41,000
and Doaba regions are heading to join Banda's army right now!

1154
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,166
No! I will not let this happen!

1155
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:45,750
I will not let a child cross over to join him,

1156
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:48,416
from this side of Sirhind. And you talk of a contingent?

1157
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:51,916
Every tongue that takes his name, I want you to cut it out!

1158
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:59,083
If a foot takes a step towards him! I want you to chop it off! It's an order!!

1159
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:02,750
Banda was able to asses Wazir Khan's next move.

1160
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,916
He changed the course of his

1161
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:08,041
army's advance towards the banks of River Satluj.

1162
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:10,958
Where the Nawab of Malerkotla had locked the Sikhs of Majha and Doaba in a battle.

1163
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:13,916
His victory march did not stop.

1164
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:16,041
He conquered Gurm, Kesar, Shahbad..

1165
01:36:16,541 --> 01:36:19,125
and Mustafabad on his way there.

1166
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:23,416
He then freed Kapoori, from the clutches of Kadar-ul-din.

1167
01:36:23,916 --> 01:36:30,000
Locals spat and threw stones at this notorious rapist with rage in their eyes.

1168
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:34,083
Banda then turned to attack Sadora.

1169
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:39,750
Osman Khan, the Lord of Sadora had killed Saint Buddhu Shah

1170
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:45,041
because he had helped Guru Gobind Singh in the battle of Bhangani.

1171
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:51,000
Osman was killed. The people Of Sadora got freedom

1172
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,708
Locals dug out their dead, and cremated their loved ones,

1173
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:58,875
Thanking Guru Gobind Singh for sending a messiah

1174
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:02,083
Wazir Khan needs to start counting his last days...

1175
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:06,666
Because believe me, he hasn't got many left!

1176
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:11,541
Our people who are coming from Doaba and Majha are waiting

1177
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:18,708
the day of their vengeance, when Wazir Khan will be beheaded!!

1178
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:23,000
Yes, we will only be at peace, after we avenge the martyrdom of the Guru's sons.

1179
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,750
We certainly gave a suitable reply to the Nawab of Malerkotla

1180
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,291
and conquered Banur and Ropar with ease.

1181
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:36,208
Friends, I appreciate your emotions

1182
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:39,541
But there is one thing, I want to make clear to you all.

1183
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:45,833
My Guru has not sent me here, to avenge the death of his youngest sons.

1184
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:47,125
Not at all. My Guru Sahib was above all that.

1185
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:51,125
Taking to the sword, as a last resort. He never had vengeance on his mind,

1186
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:54,291
for any deed he did.

1187
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:57,208
If he had, he would not have helped Bahadur Shah to claim his throne,

1188
01:37:57,708 --> 01:37:59,083
knowing he was the son of Aurangzeb...

1189
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:01,625
His bitterest enemy and the murderer of his beloved father.

1190
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:04,291
Nor was he against any religion.

1191
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:08,291
We have soldiers among us, from all religions.

1192
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:15,833
He has sent me to free Punjab from the tyranny of the Mughals,

1193
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:18,083
and to create the Punjab of His and our dreams.

1194
01:38:18,583 --> 01:38:23,750
Yes, in the execution of such a duty we will, ofcourse punish the wrong doers...

1195
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:26,666
Whether he is a Wazir Khan or someone else..

1196
01:38:27,166 --> 01:38:28,000
I know...

1197
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:35,291
Wazir Khan is a cruel man and a devil. There is no place for a man like this in Punjab.

1198
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,625
He will be punished.

1199
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:42,625
How can I ever forget the Cold Tower (Burj)?

1200
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:56,041
Begum, you come here quite often. What worries you, my love?

1201
01:38:56,541 --> 01:38:59,208
The massacre that occurred in Sadora

1202
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:02,000
or the defeat the Nawab of Malerkotla suffered at the Sutlej?

1203
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:06,333
Nothing like that will happen here in Sirhind.

1204
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:11,000
No war has been lost by the Mughal Army in the last hundred years.

1205
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,000
And I will win this one also

1206
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,166
And Banda Singh, I will kill him.

1207
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:24,083
In a way, that the world will remember it for centuries to come!

1208
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:32,000
Why can't you hear the omen coming from Cold Tower, my dear husband?

1209
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:36,000
We were just 31 of us, when we left Nanded.

1210
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:40,791
With Guru Sahib's blessings, our count is now in thousands

1211
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:43,875
We shall attack Sirhind in the summer

1212
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:47,875
I am sure by then we will have all our soldiers battle-ready!

1213
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:58,375
Mothers have sent their sons, sisters their brothers

1214
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:00,958
and wives their husbands, with a smile on their faces,

1215
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:07,416
For the freedom of our people. Guru Sahib, I will never let them down.

1216
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:11,791
I will never be able to forget their unconditional support.

1217
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:18,916
As time changed

1218
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:28,000
I realized the ways of my Lord

1219
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:35,541
The meek stood Up to defend himself

1220
01:40:36,041 --> 01:40:42,916
And the weak Defeated the tormentors

1221
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:45,958
Great! Banda has infused so much courage among the common people, everywhere

1222
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,750
That he now has an enormous following

1223
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:53,708
And they are all ready to die for him.

1224
01:40:54,208 --> 01:40:56,250
You are absolutely right, Baba BulleShah.

1225
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:59,250
Just as your writings make people aware how to pray to the Almighty,

1226
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:04,250
Banda's velour attracts people to join him to fight this terrible injustice.

1227
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,791
Only a noble soul, can understand and feel the real pain

1228
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:14,250
of the poor tormented starved man...

1229
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:16,791
You were saying something, and you stopped

1230
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:22,375
I will. I can never hold back my thoughts...

1231
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:29,416
There are terrible times ahead for those, who dare live against the Will of God...

1232
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:34,291
I will say what comes to my mind, If

1233
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:38,583
I will say what come to my mind, If

1234
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:43,291
I tell a lie, It is accepted

1235
01:41:43,791 --> 01:41:48,416
When I speak the truth, There is chaos!

1236
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:53,291
I go trapped in both ways

1237
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:57,291
But still my heart says, I will say what comes to my mind..

1238
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:07,833
What news does your nephew bring?

1239
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:09,333
Tell him! Ganda Mal

1240
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:12,833
Sir, I have joined Banda's army without them knowing

1241
01:42:13,333 --> 01:42:15,500
Banda Singh is making tremendous preparations for the Battle.

1242
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,875
Let him do what ever he can!

1243
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:20,500
Emperors have changed in Delhi,

1244
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,166
But, here in Sirhind, Wazir Khan rules, Correct? And shall always rule!

1245
01:42:26,666 --> 01:42:31,250
Where have come from, and where will go?

1246
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:35,333
Tell me your destination

1247
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:40,541
The position and estate your ego boasts of...

1248
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:45,916
Nothing will go with you to the next world...

1249
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:50,958
You torture people with your wicked ways

1250
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:56,291
You will be punished for your deeds

1251
01:42:56,791 --> 01:43:01,125
Have you thought of the punishment to Banda after the victory, Khan Sahib?

1252
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,208
I will cut him into 40 pieces,

1253
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:07,791
and hang his head on my Fort as an exhibit for my people!

1254
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:10,875
Be very careful of his head Sire, these Sikhs whisked away the head

1255
01:43:11,375 --> 01:43:14,041
of their Ninth Guru from Chandni Chowk

1256
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:18,625
This is Sirhind, not Delhi. (laughter)

1257
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:23,375
Somewhere you are a Thief, Somehwere a Priest

1258
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:28,333
Somewhere you stand, On a high platform and preach

1259
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:35,250
Sometimes you are Tegh, Bahadur the defiant Saint

1260
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:42,791
Who offered his head for others

1261
01:43:43,291 --> 01:43:47,708
O' tell me in who, And where all do

1262
01:43:48,208 --> 01:43:55,250
O' tell me in who and where all, Do you disguise yourself my Lord

1263
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,125
Wait at Chapparchiri,

1264
01:43:57,625 --> 01:44:00,958
Supplies from Banur Manimajra and Kharar,

1265
01:44:01,458 --> 01:44:03,958
must be blocked from reaching Wazir Khan's Fort forces, at all cost.

1266
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:08,166
Banda singh look at my army, my cannons.

1267
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:12,166
Come, see the strength of my force...come!

1268
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:27,166
Fantastic! Wow! I can see the cannon balls cutting right through the Sikh forces.

1269
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:33,791
I can visualize their body parts flung all over.

1270
01:44:34,291 --> 01:44:39,083
Most will perish and the rest will panic and flee to the safety of their Mother's arms

1271
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:41,375
Victory will be ours!!

1272
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:45,416
15,000 trained men... 1,200 Horsemen, dozens of elephants,

1273
01:44:45,916 --> 01:44:49,750
5,000 ferocious Ghazis, and many canons

1274
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:53,958
Am I correct?

1275
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:57,791
Wazir Khan is planning a warm welcome for us!

1276
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:00,833
Banda Singhji, how will we face his cannons?

1277
01:45:01,333 --> 01:45:06,208
I just need to know the range of the cannons. Will they reach from here to here...

1278
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:10,833
Banda Singhji, the men who were on their way to bring reinforcements to our Army,

1279
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,958
Wazir Khan's men arrested them and

1280
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:17,666
hanged them to death in the village squares

1281
01:45:18,166 --> 01:45:22,041
All this to scare away, all those who might have joined us.

1282
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:24,000
Where did you get this news from?

1283
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:27,958
We heard the new recruits discussing it, in the camp.

1284
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:32,791
Tell me, how did you feel when you heard this cruel deed of Wazir Khan?

1285
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:35,250
My blood boils, Sire!

1286
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:39,041
But Singhji, I am worried about the mental state of the new men.

1287
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:40,041
Don't you worry!

1288
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:46,041
This cruel deed of Wazir Khan, Will infuse fury into our soldiers

1289
01:45:46,541 --> 01:45:50,041
Now, make sure you are fully geared up!

1290
01:46:00,458 --> 01:46:04,916
The tyrants have done this terrible deed to scare my men...

1291
01:46:05,416 --> 01:46:13,666
O'tell me Guru Sahib, is this the right time to attack Sirhind?

1292
01:46:14,166 --> 01:46:14,875
Khalsa ji...

1293
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:18,916
Nothing will happen, if just keep thinking...

1294
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:22,041
You are aware that this is the Will of our Guru Father,

1295
01:46:22,541 --> 01:46:25,333
then why are you hesitating?

1296
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:31,666
The right time to attack is when you think you are ready.

1297
01:46:32,166 --> 01:46:33,375
And when you are ready,

1298
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:35,583
all Singh's are ready

1299
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:37,541
Just think Khalsaji, isn't this cowardly act

1300
01:46:38,041 --> 01:46:41,125
a sign of his nervousness...

1301
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:45,375
He is very scared of you, From deep within within..

1302
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:47,916
Move ahead Singhji ....

1303
01:46:48,416 --> 01:46:52,791
Yes, we are with you!

1304
01:46:53,291 --> 01:47:00,041
(Waheguru) Hail the Lord!

1305
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:07,583
(Waheguru) Hail the Lord!

1306
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:17,625
(Waheguru) Hail the Lord!

1307
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:22,875
Khalsaji, a man and a woman have come to meet you from Sirhind.

1308
01:47:23,375 --> 01:47:24,625
They came here a number of times before

1309
01:47:25,125 --> 01:47:28,625
They insist on meeting you before you go to battle, Sir.

1310
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:39,583
Yes, tell me....

1311
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:42,000
I am Noora Mahi.

1312
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:45,000
I visited Sirhind on Guru Sahib's instructions...

1313
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:50,166
Yes, yes, Bhai Daya Singh mentioned that to me in passing.

1314
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:51,833
This is my sister, Razia.

1315
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:53,208
She saw the martyrdom

1316
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:57,208
of the younger sons of Guru Sahib, brick by brick

1317
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:06,250
I have brought something for you.

1318
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:20,250
This is one of the bricks, that was used in the wall that day

1319
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:26,041
I have kept it with me for five long years now...

1320
01:48:26,541 --> 01:48:31,083
This is for you...

1321
01:48:31,583 --> 01:48:33,000
Keep it with you in the battle.

1322
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,750
I believe it will inspire you to teach

1323
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:39,750
Wazir Khan the lesson he truly needs to learn

1324
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:56,000
We are all with you...

1325
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:01,541
Don't cry my dear...

1326
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:06,708
I don't know how to thank Guru Sahib, for sending you here to me, this day

1327
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:10,041
I would like to hear all that

1328
01:49:10,541 --> 01:49:14,041
you witnessed in Sirhind that day...

1329
01:49:40,041 --> 01:49:45,083
Guru Sahib. You have sent me to free Punjab from its cruel ruler,

1330
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,541
and not to seek revenge.

1331
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:49,875
But when I'm in battle,

1332
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:55,125
with the account of brutality I've just heard in my mind.

1333
01:49:55,625 --> 01:49:58,291
I have a request to make,

1334
01:49:58,791 --> 01:50:02,291
that when the tyrant Wazir Khan is before me in the attlefield, that you please forgive me...

1335
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:28,083
Banda Singh, this is not Samana nor Sadaura.

1336
01:50:28,583 --> 01:50:32,375
It is my Sirhind, Wazir Khan's Sirhind.

1337
01:50:32,875 --> 01:50:37,541
Wazir khan, I am neither your Officer nor a King of a Hill State

1338
01:50:38,041 --> 01:50:40,083
I am a Singh, my Guru's Singh!

1339
01:50:40,583 --> 01:50:43,125
I give you a choice, drop your arms now.

1340
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:47,000
Beg me and I'll spare the lives of you and your men....

1341
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:50,083
You could not win over two young children, aged five and nine!

1342
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:53,291
How do imagine winning over thousands of us determined Sikhs?

1343
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:58,791
Come! Kneel before me. Why do you want to die, of this day.

1344
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:01,875
Don't you even think of kneeling before me!

1345
01:51:02,375 --> 01:51:04,541
I am not sparing you.

1346
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:09,041
Soon, your forces will be in my custody.

1347
01:51:09,541 --> 01:51:10,333
Come on! Try and get us....

1348
01:51:10,833 --> 01:51:12,875
Just look at my cannons...

1349
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:16,916
Look at my Singhs! Each one is like a cannon ball!

1350
01:51:17,416 --> 01:51:20,041
Banda Singh, this is the last chance for you!

1351
01:51:20,541 --> 01:51:23,083
Wazir khan, if you have a last wish, wish now!

1352
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:26,458
You will not see the sun rise tomorrow!

1353
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:30,458
The sun will set today only when you are dead and gone!

1354
01:51:34,666 --> 01:51:37,125
Soldiers, of the most efficient army of the world!

1355
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:39,125
Crush the enemy in such a way,

1356
01:51:39,625 --> 01:51:46,166
that their coming generations die from our fear in their wombs. This Wazir Khan commands!

1357
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:53,083
Khalsaji pounce on the enemy as if you are possessed, you are the army of Waheguru!

1358
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:58,166
We shall get justice for the sins committed in Sirhind!

1359
01:51:58,666 --> 01:52:02,083
Generations to come, will feel honoured and proud!

1360
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:05,333
Every time they will read The History of this day...

1361
01:52:05,833 --> 01:52:07,625
Who is the Commander today?

1362
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:09,125
Our Guru Gobind Singhji

1363
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:12,125
Oh Lord...!

1364
01:52:12,625 --> 01:52:13,916
In performing righteous action

1365
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:15,208
I may never falter

1366
01:52:15,708 --> 01:52:17,166
May I never be intimated

1367
01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:18,208
When I fight with the enemies

1368
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:20,083
I know in my heart!

1369
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:21,208
I will be victorious!

1370
01:52:21,708 --> 01:52:23,041
I know in my heart!

1371
01:52:23,541 --> 01:52:23,958
I will be victorious!!

1372
01:52:24,458 --> 01:52:25,416
I know in my heart!

1373
01:52:25,916 --> 01:52:29,416
I will be victorious!!!!!

1374
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:37,458
Glory to God!

1375
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:41,458
Glory to god

1376
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,166
Untrained idiots!

1377
01:52:56,666 --> 01:53:00,166
Charge!!!

1378
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:08,083
Move Forward...

1379
01:53:08,583 --> 01:53:12,083
Stop! Any further, we will be in range of the cannon fire!

1380
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:23,708
Charge! Faster! Before they reload their cannons, we must reach them!!

1381
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:34,208
Shoot arrows!

1382
01:53:34,708 --> 01:53:38,208
Cannons reloaded...

1383
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:09,125
Bad news!

1384
01:54:09,625 --> 01:54:11,291
All our routes of supplies from our Forts at Banur,

1385
01:54:11,791 --> 01:54:14,250
Manimajra and Kharar have been cut-off by the Sikhs.

1386
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:17,166
There are no more supplies or help coming in!

1387
01:54:17,666 --> 01:54:20,250
It is he, who will need help today.

1388
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:24,250
See how my spies in his army, turn the Battle in my favor! Suchanand!

1389
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,916
The Mughals are crushing Sikhs... Go! Run for your lives now!

1390
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:48,833
Oh...What is he saying??

1391
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:52,833
It will soon be over!

1392
01:55:04,875 --> 01:55:07,166
Banda Singhji, the cannons have been devastating

1393
01:55:07,666 --> 01:55:09,916
The newly joined contingents are retreating now

1394
01:55:10,416 --> 01:55:12,958
Singhji, rally the reserve forces. Command them to strike back against this treachery!

1395
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:16,500
Onwards!

1396
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,291
In this battlefield, The Singh's who have come

1397
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:27,333
Are ready to sacrifice Themselves for their Guru's sake

1398
01:55:27,833 --> 01:55:33,250
They come to fight, to kill or maybe die

1399
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:41,958
The beats of the war drum Spell victory! Banda's...

1400
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:45,958
Banda's sword will strike like thunder!

1401
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:42,958
Take this!

1402
01:56:43,458 --> 01:56:46,375
You committed a blunder, giving me a sword back...

1403
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:50,375
If it was me, I would have cut your arms to pieces!

1404
01:56:54,166 --> 01:56:57,666
Come then! I am unarmed, Strike me down!!

1405
01:57:03,583 --> 01:57:11,166
Nanak says bad deeds, lead to a bad end

1406
01:57:11,666 --> 01:57:20,458
Wazir Khan! The time has come for tyrants like you to get what they deserve So lie and eat dust!

1407
01:57:20,958 --> 01:57:28,000
You must be wondering, why I haven't ended your miserable life!

1408
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,333
Look here!

1409
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:33,958
This is a brick from the wall in which you

1410
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:38,041
buried our Guru's sons and martyred them.

1411
01:57:38,541 --> 01:57:40,750
This brick is five years old...

1412
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:44,125
Baba Fateh Singh was also just five years of age.

1413
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:49,458
With this brick I will give you nine fatal blows!

1414
01:57:49,958 --> 01:57:53,458
Because Baba Zorawar Singh was nine!

1415
01:58:03,458 --> 01:58:06,958
Get ready to pay for your sins! For every innocent you have killed, You devil!

1416
01:58:46,625 --> 01:58:48,583
Wazir Khan!!

1417
01:58:49,083 --> 01:58:52,583
Today you will be defeated by this Fateh Singh too!

1418
01:59:01,041 --> 01:59:08,833
(Sikh Army roars)

1419
01:59:09,333 --> 01:59:12,833
The tryant is dead but his shadows loom large. March to Sirhind!

1420
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:25,916
Kazi Sahib! Kazi Sahib!

1421
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:27,958
Kazi Sahib! Open the door..

1422
01:59:28,458 --> 01:59:29,541
Suchanand!, What news?

1423
01:59:30,041 --> 01:59:33,791
We are defeated. Wazir Khan is dead.

1424
01:59:34,291 --> 01:59:37,791
Leave for Delhi, with your family right now!

1425
01:59:40,458 --> 01:59:44,333
That is Suchanand!

1426
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:47,458
Stop him!

1427
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:49,500
Catch him !

1428
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,041
Stop Sucha Nand! Let him not get away!

1429
01:59:53,541 --> 01:59:57,041
Suchanand, today there is no escape!

1430
02:00:15,958 --> 02:00:18,458
Please don't hit me! Please don't!

1431
02:00:18,958 --> 02:00:22,458
Suchanand ...

1432
02:01:19,375 --> 02:01:24,375
Forgive me Banda Singh Jiiiii... I made a terrible mistake!

1433
02:01:24,875 --> 02:01:31,916
Remember, what you said about my Guru Sahib, as you stood right here?

1434
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,875
Did you hear?

1435
02:01:35,375 --> 02:01:38,500
A snake's child will be as poisonous as the snake himself...

1436
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,958
I said it with this very tongue. Here cut it out... but don't kill me..

1437
02:01:43,458 --> 02:01:49,625
Remember now what Baba Zorawar Singh said to you that day?

1438
02:01:50,125 --> 02:01:52,625
Sucha Nand, hold your tongue!

1439
02:01:53,125 --> 02:01:56,625
My father is a friend of the weak, known for his good deeds.

1440
02:01:57,125 --> 02:02:02,083
Bow downing respect to Him... Guru Gobind Singh is his name!

1441
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:11,291
Here, I bow down, I bow down, bow down, I bow to Guru Sahib,

1442
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:15,458
I bow to you for the rest of my life... Just please... forgive me...

1443
02:02:15,958 --> 02:02:20,750
Look up. Clever one! Tell me in your own words...

1444
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:25,083
What was Baba Fateh Singh's warning to you, that day?

1445
02:02:25,583 --> 02:02:26,791
Thank your

1446
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:29,125
Thank your lucky stars, we are your prisoners

1447
02:02:29,625 --> 02:02:32,208
Otherwise I swear by the Almighty,

1448
02:02:32,708 --> 02:02:34,750
your head would no longer, be on your shoulders

1449
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:39,000
Forgive me. Confine me in the cold tower for life...

1450
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,208
But, please please don't kill me...

1451
02:02:41,708 --> 02:02:45,791
Be grateful that Baba Fateh Singh

1452
02:02:46,291 --> 02:02:50,583
prophesied an easy death for you, that day...

1453
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:57,458
I will have to do what those two innocent prophesied!

1454
02:02:57,958 --> 02:03:01,458
Apology.. Ehh

1455
02:03:50,416 --> 02:03:52,500
Banda Singhji,..

1456
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,500
We have taken Wazir Khan's wife and children in our custody. And we await your orders.

1457
02:04:23,375 --> 02:04:25,791
Wherever they want to go, take them.

Offering your full respect and give protection.

1459
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:41,958
With our Guru's blessings, Banda Singhji Has set free, Wazir Khan's wife and children.

1460
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:45,958
Even though he was the one, who walled the Guru's sons

1461
02:05:04,208 --> 02:05:18,000
It's time now Grandma, For us to depart

1462
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:26,666
We will not be coming Back this time

1463
02:05:27,166 --> 02:05:32,416
It's time now Grandma, For us to depart

We will not be Coming Back this time

1466
02:05:41,708 --> 02:05:45,208
We can't see tears In your eyes

1467
02:06:01,291 --> 02:06:05,541
Why are you worried About us grandma..

1468
02:06:06,041 --> 02:06:10,250
We have stuck to your teachings,

1469
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:15,000
We will think of God As we offer our heads for sacrifice

1470
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:19,000
And bring glory to the name of Both, our Father and Grandfather.

1471
02:08:10,875 --> 02:08:17,875
Guru Sahib, I am aware you were the leading the battle today, not I...

1472
02:08:18,375 --> 02:08:21,875
This Victory belongs to You!!

1473
02:08:24,708 --> 02:08:31,250
Glory be to God!
