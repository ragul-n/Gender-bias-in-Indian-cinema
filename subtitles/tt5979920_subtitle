1
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:33,077
Rathod, to enter a battle
or peeing in open

2
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,081
one should never shy off.

3
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,684
It's mentioned in shastras

4
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:42,425
that if you've to release any kind
of pressure, you've to whistle.

5
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,786
What's Navratri festival?
- What?

6
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,093
It's also a pressure cooker whistle.

7
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,063
What do you mean?

8
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,066
The entire frustration which is
accumulated during entire year...

9
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,736
Frustration?
- Dilemma.

10
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,068
Oh yeah, dilemma. Dilemma!

11
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,597
If dilemma is accumulated

12
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,035
it is a pretext to get rid of it.

13
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,146
Yeah?
Shouldn't keep it within yourself.

14
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,075
However tall it might look
like a camel

15
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,743
you should dance, and whistle
to heart's content.

16
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,587
Ok, enough now.
It is time for our business.

17
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,683
Hey, halt.

18
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,694
Rathod. Check him.

19
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,356
Yes, tell me what happened?
- Show me the license. License.

20
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,093
Rathod, check his license
- Hey, why you need license?

21
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,496
Nathu uncle, don't you wear
ISI marked helmet?

22
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,593
So what's wrong?

23
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,730
Head light! Look at the head light

24
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,104
Now what's wrong with the head light?
It's perfectly fine.

25
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,374
Man, check his PUC.

26
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,706
Come on, show the PUC

27
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,045
That accident made my life
such a U turn

28
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,515
that in one stroke everything changed.

29
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,756
For good.

30
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:58,186
All night you stay up and the next
morning end up doing paper work

31
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,688
Go get some tea.

32
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:03,759
Yeah.

33
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,977
What's this!
You add kerosine to the tea?

34
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,174
Take it away.
- Here take.

35
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,987
Where is Makwana?

36
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,718
Sir, he must be coming now.

37
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,418
Sir.

38
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,426
It was our two constables,
and the uncle were there.

39
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:40,093
The constable died on the spot
and the uncle is bit serious.

40
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,438
Come here.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,707
And that's where the car
came rushing

42
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,247
and crashed into everything.

43
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,153
We need to find the driver.

44
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,753
Sir, this is some evidence.

45
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,659
We have found the clues, Dynya.

46
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,735
Call the garage guy Jeetu Patel.

47
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,967
He will find out which car
these spare pans belong to.

48
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,438
Sir, Jeetu is not available.

49
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,111
Why? Has he died!

50
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,177
No, he hasn't, his mother-in-law has.

51
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,244
Who?

52
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,615
Jeetu's mom-i n-law.

53
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,027
So, are we suppose to mourn?

54
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:37,627
No, sir.

55
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,563
Find someone else, and find
which car it belongs to.

56
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,587
Yes, sir.
- Be quick.

57
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,564
Okay, sir,
- And listen.

58
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,634
This time don't screw it up like
the last time,

59
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,035
Get them checked in forensic department.
Go now.

60
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,071
Okay, sir. Sir!

61
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,114
Sir, I found this scooter back there.

62
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,479
Put it on the stand.

63
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,151
Check the boot.

64
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,678
I am Makwana, speaking form
Ghodapur Police Station.

65
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,245
Is it RTO?

66
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:43,684
Yeah, who does this scooter
GJ-GSP-1512 belong to?

67
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,458
What did you say?

68
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,664
Are you hard of hearing?

69
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,001
1512.

70
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,093
So say that.

71
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,292
Who does it belong to?

72
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,699
This scooter belongs to Bambani.

73
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,200
Mr. Anil of Mr. Mukesh?

74
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,039
Are you joking with me?

75
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,373
No, sir. How can l.

76
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,047
Sir, it's not Ambani's but
Raju Bambani's.

77
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,641
Raj u Barn bani!

78
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,049
Yes.

79
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,287
Ok, hang UP-

80
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,357
Has anyone seen unseen?

81
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,222
Give your name.

82
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,760
<i>Raju, sir.
- Raids your name?</i>

83
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,230
And the surname?

84
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,391
Last name? Surname?

85
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,792
Barn bani.

86
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,060
Is that also yours or someone else's?

87
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,369
Sit Sit!

88
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,174
Sit I said.

89
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,235
Get up!!!

90
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,541
Everything is here.

91
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,413
What's our gain?

92
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,674
Yeah.

93
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,808
What's his name?

94
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,210
Raj u Barn bani.

95
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,812
Raj u Barn bani

96
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,719
Sit Sit!

97
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,454

98
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,129
Look at this, sir.

99
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,427
I said sit!

100
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,194
Sir, the other day the way you
hit Ganpath, he is still recovering.

101
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,068
All that later.

102
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,369
His eardrum busted.
He can't hear.

103
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,437
Never mind.

104
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,338
Okay, then, your scooter

105
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,679
GSP - 1512

106
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,303
Where is it?

107
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,275
Sir, that

108
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,611
Sir, its at the Ghodapur
by pass road.

109
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,779
And where do you stay?

110
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,053
Maninagar.

111
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,123
Maninagar it seems.
- Hmm

112
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,250
So why were you at Ghodapur
by-pass, so late at night?

113
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,028
Sir,I was going back home from 'Garba'

114
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,029
What did you go to Garba for?

115
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,125
No, sir. lwas...

116
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,328
There has been an accident there.

117
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,268
2 Constables have died and one
aged man is in a serious condition.

118
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,293
Do you know that?

119
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,067
Yeah, ljust heard.

120
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,437
What did you see at night?

121
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,371
Nothing, Sir.

122
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,475
You must have seen something.

123
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,545
Sir, I was just returning home
on my scooter

124
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,050
and there were a lot of cops there.

125
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,047
And my scooter broke down so

126
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,349
I left it there and went back home.

127
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,752
Middle of the road?
- No, Sir. At the side.

128
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,462
Near the footpath,
under the 'Peepal' tree.

129
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,131
These were found
from your scooter's boot.

130
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,269
Are they yours?
- No, Sir!

131
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,042
Where did you get these from?

132
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,504
I have no idea about this Sir.

133
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,102
You are quite something, man!

134
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,373
People in Gujarat are scared to
keep even one bottle in their house

135
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,313
and you are carrying a whole
bar with you in your scooter.

136
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,256
What brand is this?

137
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,085
I don't know, take a look. ?

138
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,589
Gel-fe.

139
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,462
How do you pronounce this?
Check Dinya!

140
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,166
Glan-fa-tich!

141
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,099
Sir, Its the same one that we
had found when he had raided

142
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,073
that farmhouse some days back.
It costs 15000I- each.

143
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,473
Ooh! It's duty free here!
- Let me see it.

144
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:46,767
WOW!

145
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,078
This is as expensive as your surname!

146
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,477
Here!

147
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,175
Take! Give it to everyone!

148
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,341
Party?

149
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,509
<i>Yes mm!'-!</i>

150
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,214
Sir I am speaking the truth.

151
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,518
I really have no idea about this.

152
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,556
I had just parked my
scooter and left from there.

153
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:03,525
Okay.

154
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
So all these bottles
seem to have find their

155
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,456
way on their own into your scooter.

156
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,200
Sir like I said, I left from there
after parking my scooter.

157
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,428
The scooter obviously
remained there the whole night

158
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,763
and I don't even have
the keys to the boot,

159
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,665
looks like someone
must have kept these in there.

160
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,474
Ya right!

161
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,499
Here in Gujarat its impossible
to buy booze even with money.

162
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,200
And you expect me to believe
that someone just left

163
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,769
these expensive
bottles in your scooter.

164
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,309
Too cool man you are!

165
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,547
Makhwana?
- Yes Sir.

166
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,014
Am I fasting today?

167
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,021
No Sir.

168
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,521
Where is my share then? You idiot!

169
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,287
There are no more glasses left.

170
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,060
Will a saucer do?

171
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,199
Ya just get whats there!
- Bring it.

172
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,567
Oh, Barn bani!

173
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,045
One minute, one minute Sir!
Concentrate!

174
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,782
Cheers! - Cheers!

175
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:11,127
Wow! Each sip makes
you feel like its heaven!

176
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,393
Too good this is, man!

177
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,357
Now tell the truth.
You are in liquor business, right?

178
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,996
No, sir.

179
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,461
I swear, I really don't know
anything about it.

180
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,538
Is it?

181
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,242
Swear on your occupation.
Swear.

182
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,207
I don't drink at all.
I have nothing to do with liquor, sir.

183
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,679
There he is come!
Come, come.

184
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,575
Raju I have an idea.

185
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,611
Let's develop an app for
delivering booze in Ahmedabad.

186
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,423
It will be a huge hit!
What say?

187
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,220
You make yours. I am working
on my own start up idea.

188
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,655
And just in case if yours fail,
let me know, I will take that over.

189
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,164
Uncle I was coming
straight up to meet you.

190
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,333
<i>Rain'. Have you brought it'?</i>

191
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,237
That's why I am here, uncle.

192
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,670
Show what you have got.

193
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,709
Not so easily uncle.

194
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,271
Sing my favorite song first.

195
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,142
Which one?

196
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,308
The favourite one.
- Oh that one

197
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,115
Sit Sit!

198
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,190
Dad, please keep the volume low.
- Yes Yes!

199
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,275
Wow, uncle!
You have such a magical voice.

200
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,747
<i>Rain'. The magic is in this song.</i>

201
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:03,347
I feel like I am in trance
when I sing this song.

202
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,385
Is that because of the song or booze?

203
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,148
Hey you ruthless man! You shut up!

204
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,260
Uncle you just ignore him.
You please carry on

205
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,723
Come on, this song is so intoxicating

206
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,435
that whoever listens to it
will fall in love.

207
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,333
Is it?

208
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,001
Then why isn't he in love yet?

209
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,072
He is...

210
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,197
What?

211
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:30,105
With your big boss, the great
lawyer, Mr. Amitabh Shah.

212
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,549
Okay, enough enough!

213
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,544
Stop fooling around here.
I have got work to do.

214
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,282
Hey listen. We all have work.

215
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,220
<i>Come on Rain, out with it.</i>

216
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:43,988
oh Yes yes!

217
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,229
I hope you know
you are ruining my dad's liver.

218
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,005
That's still better
than wasting your life in

219
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,010
that courtroom of yours where
everything is just fabricated.

220
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,375
Such a great thought that is uncle!

221
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,014
I think I should leave now.
- Hang on a minute!

222
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:17,390
What happened to that
travel agency business of yours?

223
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,756
Don't ask Uncle!

224
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,061
Don't call it business yet!
Its called a start up!

225
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,561
Oh yes. Start Up!

226
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,394
What about it?

227
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,768
Nothing. Stuck because
of money! What else?

228
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,073
My partner Patil has been asking for
money and bank needs a guarantor.

229
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,712
Hopefully the loan will
get sanctioned soon.

230
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,304
That's what I have been saying.
Start something legal

231
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,311
and stop this
nonsense you have been doing.

232
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,722
So his business is all wrong and what
you guys are doing is Al correct right?

233
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,053
What?

234
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,558
In today's world there is nothing
completely right or wrong!

235
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,359
That's so true Uncle!

236
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,759
Tell me one thing Parth brother!

237
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,598
Why is it that drinking is wrong
in one city and right in another?

238
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,368
Okay Okay Raju the Great!

239
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:06,071
But don't come crying to me
when you get caught under PASA!

240
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,699
PASA?

241
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,707
You know what PASA is right?

242
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,776
PASA!

243
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,577
Prevention of Anti Social activity Act!

244
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,083
Correct! Now go inside!

245
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,082
Everyone go in.

246
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,086
Makhwana!
- Yes Sir!

247
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,716
He will booked under PASA.

248
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,421
Take his statement
and put him behind the bars.

249
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,689
Sir, please listen to me once...
- We'll prepare all the papers.

250
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,230
Do you have a passport size photo?

251
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,352
No, sir.
- No worries. We will take one.

252
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,764
Sir, dock him in Porbandar.
Sir please don't do this.

253
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,789
Please hear me out.

254
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,769
Sir how about we work out a compromise?

255
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,033
What com promise?

256
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,139
As per your wish, Sir.

257
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,075
20 lakh.

258
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,143
Sir, how will I arrange for 20 lakhs?

259
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,273
Sir! Sir, just give him sometime

260
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,143
2 days.
- Enough?

261
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,413
Sir, in 2 days its impossible...

262
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:57,483
Take my word on this, you do this
much and we wont bother you at all.

263
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,220
And don't even think of escaping.

264
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,156
You know, law has long arms,
don't you?

265
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,197
That's wrong.

266
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,569
Now the baton has taken
place of hands.

267
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,133
And that too, look at it,
that of fiber.

268
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,479
Welcome to ETV news bulletin!

269
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,045
I am your anchor Sandhya

270
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,058
and the latest news to
come by is that there has been

271
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,152
an accident on the
Ghodapur by-pass road.

272
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,387
2 constables have died and

273
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,160
the third person is still in
a very serious condition.

274
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,165
Its been 36 hours since the accident

275
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,465
and the police seems to
have found no clues yet.

276
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:59,521
There are two questions here -
one being

277
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,184
who was driving the car
and where is that car?

278
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,223
Have to reach?

279
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,123
Yes. I have just reached the
Forensic Lab (FSL).

280
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,092
Give me 2 minutes Sir!

281
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,391
Z3 E70.

282
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,003
Its a model between 2007 and 2013.

283
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,401
Really.
- Yes.

284
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:21,074
I am giving the list and details,
go to any show room and get checked.

285
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,180
This is the car owner's
list you asked for.

286
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,381
Makhwana we were only thinking big.

287
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,394
This is bigger than that.

288
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,193
Boss, Tanmay's phone is unreachable.

289
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,768
You please reach the farmhouse,
I'll be there. Something is wrong.

290
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,720
Dump the car!
Now!

291
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,454
All the drivers of the Amitabh Shah's
office and family, family members

292
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,757
and workers, I want the list of the.
Now! - Yes Sir!

293
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,557
We are already two days late Makhwana,
we will land up in soup otherwise.

294
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,624
Amitabh Shah,

295
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,536
a well known and a renowned lawyer
may have handled a lot of cases,

296
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,731
but now, will he be
able to save the accused,

297
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,034
his own son
'Tanmay Shah' is to be seen.

298
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,053
Sir. This is the list of
Amitabh Shah's drivers.

299
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,554
You will find the 4th name
to be very interesting.

300
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,258
Invite him over. Call him.

301
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,260
Eat for you.
- No Sir.

302
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,638
Eat I said. It's for you only.

303
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,571
Eat!

304
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,524
Who was driving the car
GJ-KRN-1111 before Tanmay Shah?

305
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,716
Me, sir.

306
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:24,158
Who used to drive the car after
Tanmay came back to India?

307
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,595
It's me, sir.

308
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,675
And who was driving
that cat that night?

309
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,008
You right?

310
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,606
No,sir, I was on my scooter.

311
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,641
Who's talking about the scooter here
- Sir, Sir...

312
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,653
Tanmay was driving right?
Tanmay was driving.

313
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,046
I don't know Sir.

314
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,319
You ought to know.

315
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,356
You have been driving it since
Amitabh Shah bought the car.

316
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,724
But Sir, I haven't been to the
office since two days now.

317
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,326
You may check the register also.

318
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,131
What happened to those 20 lakhs?

319
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,537
Sir you had said you
wont bother me for 2 days.

320
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,515
Ok leave that. We have
given him 2 days. - No Sir!

321
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,711
No Sir!
- Makhwana after 2 days.

322
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,278
It was a commitment
- But sir

323
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,082
Let it go.
Lets do a deal instead.

324
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,754
Deal?

325
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,186
With a surname like that,
you don't understand deals?

326
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:31,064
You give me all the
information that I need and

327
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:35,335
I will re-consider those 20 lakhs.

328
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,332
What information Si r?

329
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,703
Everything about Tanmay Shah.

330
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,302
Since when do you know him?

331
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:49,050
Since he came back from Malaysia.

332
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:54,323
It is said that there are more spoilt
brats in Ahmedabad than stray dogs.

333
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,084
Tanmay Sir is the
biggest example of that.

334
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,536
Hello, I am Raju.

335
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,301
Coffee.

336
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,335
Sir, I work in your father's company.
8 years. Driver.

337
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,205
Speak in Gujarati!

338
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,983
Amitabh Sir has told me
to be with you from today.

339
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,649
Where is he?

340
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,049
He will come tomorrow

341
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,755
Okay. Lets go.

342
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,362
Sir, coffee...

343
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,368
Tanmay Sir was waiting to
meet his father since three days.

344
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,705
And finally, he arrived.

345
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,632
Here it is, VISAMO.

346
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,593
A most affordable housing scheme
in the history of Gujarat.

347
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,733
Spread over 100 acres of land,

348
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,074
accommodating 20 thousand families,

349
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,372
in just rupees 5 lacs per unit.

350
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,738
We are glad to venture successfully
also into Real Estate with this project.

351
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,085
Hi, where is my dad?

352
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,586
He is in the conference room.

353
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,155
Sir, conference is on.

354
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:41,293
Hope we have a nice association.
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

355
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,358
But there are few concerns like...

356
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,733
zone 4 to Zone 10 comes under rural.

357
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,996
Some are of course, private.

358
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,472
Gentlemen. Before we go any further

359
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,507
I wish that you sign this contract
today itself.

360
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,070
Mr. Shah, how can we do that?

361
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,309
Then why' re we here?

362
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,210
Isn't it too early to sign...

363
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:06,016
Ambitabh Shah and Associates,
means trust.

364
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,388
You have to trust me.

365
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,998
Good day, gentlemen.

366
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,190
Dad, I need to talk.

367
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,197
I have to speak to you.
- I am busy now.

368
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,439
Dad, it's just matter of
just few minutes. - No.

369
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,416
Sir, I need your signature on
these contract papers.

370
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,187
Dad! Dad!

371
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,422
I want to discuss something important
with you. I'll take five minutes.

372
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,221
Can't you see, I am busy.

373
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,762
It's urgent.

374
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:54,763
Sorry, sir.

375
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,267
Let me get you another pen.

376
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,383
So there was a puncture in the
relation of father and son, right?

377
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,110
Then?

378
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,658
This paper is found.

379
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,269
What is it?

380
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,045
What's this!

381
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,417
When were you about to tell, man?

382
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,587
Sir, I and my partner Patil Saheb
were struggling for money.

383
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,584
My brother, my mentor or my partner
you may call him anything.

384
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,323
And this is your receipt Mr. Patil.

385
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,323
Yeah. Thank you.

386
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:01,131
I hope all the formalities
are over now Mr Sharma, right?

387
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,604
Yes Yes Yes. Its all done except

388
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,799

lakhs to the association

389
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,541

agency will get going.

390
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,304
Excuse me?

You arrange for the money and
I'll get your documents processed.

00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,222
Ok? So see you next week
with documents.

395
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,194

Work hard.

397
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,226
Sir, we had a dream of
opening tour operating agency.

398
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,196
Like Akshar Travels.

399
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,467
I need a loan for it,
and guarantor thereof.

400
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,240

00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,545

You gotta come out.

442
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,698

She just happened to open that door...

00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,263
You will land in some big trouble
someday.

473
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,000
Where is food?
- To hell with you!

474

00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,398
Because it's 'Agyaras' today.

480
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,259
What is Agyara?

481
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,570
Eleven day of month.

483
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,067

Uncle, it played.

501
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,697
Come on, if it is so, call the doctor.
I am single.

502
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,337
You are just not getting it uncle.
That song played in the background.

503
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,712
Hey, wow!
So, you've fallen in love finally.

504
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,351
Who's the girl?

505
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,147
Uncle, the girl is...

00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,353
I will call you later.

507
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,027
You know, you shouldn't talk
while you drive.

508
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,987
Oh, sorry. Driving, right?

509
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:19,329
But Madam out here we get caught
if we are not talking while driving.

510
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,125
You need to do restoration
of this place?

511
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,333
This city is pretty much like a child.

512
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:53,774
In one moment its mischievous
and in another innocent.

513
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,644
Never could understand it.

514
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,491
Hey. I know what you're trying to say.

515
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,227
And I agree.

516
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,606
Dhamo!
- Yes.

517
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,271
Tonight's this party is thrown by Raju.

518
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,544
Raju you turned
out to be a true player.

519
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,213
You somehow got the loan sanctioned.

520
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:35,587
<i>Rain!</i>

521
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,559
The documents have come by.

522
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:41,026
As soon as the money comes in,
you quit your job first.

523
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,030
And then we will begin
our own travel agency

524
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,156
<i>and take it to huge heights my Rain'.!</i>

525
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,561

Tonight you have to drink with us.

527
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,266
Why?

528
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,078
You know I don't drink.

529
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,277
Isn't she the same girl
who you are being paid to be with?

530
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,278
Give back the phone here.

531
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,213
<i>Rain'. Whats her name'?</i>

532
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,254
Shaily!

533
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:15,222
The name Shelly is so sweet
but she looks so hot man!

534
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,729
Not Shelly! Shaily it is.

535
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:24,202
Whatever it may be Raju, remember
she is your Tanmany Sir's girlfriend.

536
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,734
Why are you talking rubbish Patil Sir?

537
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,237
There is nothing between them.

538
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,073
If that's the case then

539
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,278
why has Tanmay Sir
told you to take care of her?

540
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,178
They are just friends, just friends!

541
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:45,789
Dude! There is no such thing
as just friends in today's times.

542
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,025
Make him understand Patil Sir.

543
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:49,754
Why are you talking.
- Hey

544
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,132
What are you getting so angry for?

545
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,297
Not getting angry but you guys
are speaking such rubbish.

546
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:02,042
Don't mess with my
head Raju anymore

547
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:06,239
just come out with whats
running in your head.

548
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,648
I have feelings for Shaily Madam.

549
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,614
Is that so?

550
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,220
Then I have feelings
for Katrina Kaif

551
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,291
and Patil Sir has feelings
for Mohammed Kaif.

552
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,291
But what about it?

553
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,524
Patil Sir she also likes me, trust me!

554
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:30,694
<i>Rain!</i>

555
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,667
These likes are meant for
Facebook my dear.

556
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:40,180
Mark my words you will ruin
your life in all these things.

557
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,508
<i>You think this is some kind oi a joke'?</i>

558
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,245
I am serious guys!

559
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,251
Okay enough now!

560
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,584
She is from Paris
and you are from Patya.

561
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,189
She is a firang and you are a local.

562
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,795
There is no match here.

563
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:02,195
You cant afford to
even dream about her.

564
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,798
No Patil Sir, it isn't like that!

565
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:11,270
There is no such
discrimination in love.

566
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,582
You mean LOVE?

567
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:20,087
Not sure about that
but my world has come

568
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:25,150
to a stand still ever
since I have seen her.

569
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:31,189
I just cant seem to
get smile out of my mind.

570
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,100
lam loving this feeling.

571
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,003
Patil Sir

572
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:46,305
looks like our Raju has gotten
carried away with emotions.

573
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,714
<i>Rain!</i>

574
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,313
One must not get carried
away in such emotions

575
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,283
but you should rather
let the moment pass.

576
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,219
...in the bathroom.

577
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,095
Listen Raj u!

578
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,133
The loan has been sanctioned.

579
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,193
Money la also about to come by.

580
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,731
We gotta work really hard now.

581
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,666
Make tons of money.
Even more than that actually.

582
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,234
Shall I say something Raju?

583
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,076
Get over this love feeling
that has gotten into you.

584
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,980
You will feel very nice when these
attractive girls will talk

585
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:25,111
to you nicely but you
gotta forget them. Leave it.

586
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,306
You and I were dating.

587
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:59,049
You've not been behaving properly
with me. You're being very cold.

588
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,087
You and I can still...

589
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,381
You know?

590
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,591
Madam... yeah.

591
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:22,609
And this?

592
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,278
It is nice.

593
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,403
Really?

594
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,205
It's very nice.

595
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,748
Is it for your boyfriend?

596
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,312
Boyfriend?

597
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,421
Buyeing for boyfriend?

598
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,682
No, I don't have a boyfriend, Raju.

599
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,256
Tanmay is your boyfriend, isn't it?

600
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,458
Tanmay is no my boyfriend.

601
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:47,992
I took Tanmay's help because he is
the only guy I know in the city.

602
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,072
But, I took your help,
because I like you.

603
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,167
That's my decision.

604
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,116
Questions are now
being raised on the police

605
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,162
in the hit and run
Ghodapur by pass case.

606
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,130
Even two days after the accident,
its shameful that the police

607
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,292
haven't been able to find
neither the driver nor the car

608
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,063
and sometimes it
seems like the police

609
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,334
are actually trying to
conceal the driver's identity.

610
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,464
Get them out of here!!!

611
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:29,234
Where is Tanmay Where is Tanmay
They have no other job to do!

612
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,980
As if I have hidden Tanmay.

613
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,413
Oh shit!

614
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:38,112
Yes Sir!

615
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,121
Whats all this chaos going on?

616
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:44,215
And why did you take so many
days to find the car's owner?

617
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,062
Sorry, sir. But...

618
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:50,391
I don't want any apology.
I want an answer.

619
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:56,228
Sir, actually the mother in law of our
auto expert Jitu Parikh had passed away.

620
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,035
So, was it a national mourning
for two days?

621
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,000
No, sir. But, sir...

622
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,444
The national media is taking
interest in this case.

623
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,414
I have been getting calls
from Delhi and Mumbai.

624
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,143
What am I supposed to tell the media?

625
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,112
That Jitu's mother in law
had passed away?

626
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,551
But she did pass away Sir.

627
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,551
To hell with her man!!!

628
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:19,023
Sir we also consulted
other auto experts

629
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:24,427
but none of them could
say which car was it.

630
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,456
Now look for the car.

631
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,363
I want to the car, ASAP.

632
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,434
And where is this Tanmay Shah?

633
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:36,404
Seems like his father has
kept him hidden somewhere.

634
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:43,243
Why not? I am not in the city
because of you. We're not together.

635
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:55,388
Give the keys!!!
Give the god damn keys!!!!

636
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,625
<i>Rain, What are you doing here'?</i>

637
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,472
Hot thing?
- Yes.

638
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,410
You got liquor?
- Yes.

639
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,572
For me?

640
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,572
French wine

641
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,083
<i>No way'. Thank you so much, Rain.</i>

642
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:51,374
And this is the best cake from here.

643
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,421
And cake?
Thank you so much.

644
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,284
One second, okay?
- Yes.

645
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:04,262
Raj u.

646
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,098
I can't find my purse.
- No problem, madam.

647
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,234
Pay tomorrow

648
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,595
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

649
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:10,605
Okay.

650
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,300
Is that fine?
- Ya no issues.

651
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,337
Well, thank you so much.

652
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,104
Okay, madam. Good night.

653
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,611
Raj u.
- Yeah?

654
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,638
Do you want to come in for a drink?

655
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,185
Drink... wine?

656
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,085
Me you... drink?

657
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,181
No, no... no.

658
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:34,061
I have never drank with a woman before.

659
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,494
Nonsense. Come.
Let's have a drink

660
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,256
I'll go get the glasses.

661
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,372
You know what?

662
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,338
When I first came to this city

663
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,308
I though I would be bored to death.

664
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,547
But love it like hell.

665
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,354
<i>Rain...</i>

666
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,656
Why you so good to me?

667
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,299
Sorry.

668
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,340
The magic in your eyes...

669
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,411
The depth of your voice.

670
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,653
Sorry.
- No problem.

671
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,618
Re... let's restart, okay.

672
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,692
The magic of your eyes,
the depth of your voice.

673
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,126
I don't know what you're saying.

674
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,359
I am the one crazy about you.

675
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,227
Very good.

676
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,730
Just a minute, madam.
Let me answer.

677
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,468
Hello.

678
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,146
Dickhead! How many times
are you going to call?

679
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,710
Why are you troubling a single woman?

680
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,587
She cuts the call and you
keep calling again?

681
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,017
Do you know what the time is?

682
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,315
Aren't you sleepy?

683
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,751
Just go to sleep or else
I will hit you from here!

684
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,729
Ok, good night.
Happy birthday.

685
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,768
No call now.
- You're sure?

686
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,227
No.

687
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,429
Again!

688
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,370
<i>MY--- My call.</i>

689
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:04,779
Hello.

690
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,045
Where are you?

691
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:07,744
I am at home, sir.

692
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,608
Sleeping?

693
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,350
Sir, I've been quite unwell.

694
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:12,743
Okay let's meet tomorrow

695
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:13,748
Good night, sir.

696
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,758
My small boss. Little boss.

697
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,184
Ok.

698
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,759
But you continue with the
French Tradition.

699
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,362
Good.

700
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,762
Cheers. Wow.

701
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,766
No no.
- No, I'll get it.

702
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,009
Madam, you sit. I go, I go.
- Okay.

703
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,681
Damn it!

704
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,021
How are you Sir?

705
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,567
I just came to get some medicines.

706
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,672
Your purse.

707
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:14,973
You forgot it at the cafe.

708
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,657
Lets go. I have got the
ambulance already.

709
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,340
I am dead!

710
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,044
Sir! Sir! I will drop you home.

711
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:53,051
I just came to give her the
wine bottle she had asked for.

712
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,749
I was only giving her company
Sir, I don't drink otherwise.

713
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,761
I will drop you, sir.

714
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,602
You drink.
Now watch what I do.

715
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:10,636
Sir, but...

716
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,513
ls there some kind of a
party going on in here?

717
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,558
What are you doing?

718
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:38,396
Look friend, now the matter
is out of control.

719
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,064
Tell me the truth once and for all

720
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,298
Where is Tanmay?

721
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,366
I have no idea, sir.

722
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,604
What about that firang girl?
Where is she?

723
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,678
Sir she was supposed
to leave for France.

724
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,346
Tell me the truth you were
involved with that girl right?

725
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,117
What are you even talking about Sir?

726
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,693
That girl is so hot and this
guys looks also like a loser.

727
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,032
And then...

728
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,996
What I've been trying to say is...
two million dollars.

729
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:20,205
What?

730
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:24,269
My partner and me are opening
up a casino back in Malaysia.

731
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,372
We have invested
1 million dollar already.

732
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,711
I want 2 million dollars more.

733
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:37,390
Tanmay, I got you enrolled in the
best law school of the world.

734
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:40,254
I made sure you get
whatever you wanted.

735
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:44,060
Because I wanted you to take over
my business.

736
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,531
Amitabh Shah and Associates is
the best law firm in this country.

737
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,004
We're going to be the biggest
players in real estate in this county.

738
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:55,301
This empire, all of it,
you had to take over.

739
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:58,005
Dad! Please stop giving speeches
this is not your courtroom.

740
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,175
I am your son.

741
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,149
I also want to make
an empire of my own.

742
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,143
But back there in Malaysia.

743
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,683
You're bloody disgrace to me,
my name and my legacy.

744
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,489
Name and legacy?

745
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,119
Do you mean my mom?

746
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,129
That you were married to her?

747
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,128
She had to leave and go to the US.

748
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:22,125
You seem to have forgotten
that half the property belongs to her.

749
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,303
That was her choice,
I tried to stop her but...

750
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,401
Hey, listen, listen.
I am not interested.

751
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,570
I am just not interested in
your messed up marriage life.

752
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,081
I want no details.

753
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,649
It's not important to me now.

754
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,143
Lets only talk about the investment.

755
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,687
How could you talk to me like this?

756
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,423
Because I am just like you.

757
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,188
Congratulations, dad.

758
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,507
Look, dad.

759
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:03,769
I am sorry, okay.
But will I get money or no?

760
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,447
Invests don't happen in a hurry.
One needs to plan.

761
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,216
I am going to Delhi for a couple
of days. Let's talk when I return.

762
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,049
But, dad, you knowl don't have
that much time.

763
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,661
Make a plan first and then
we will talk.

764
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,163
Good night.

765
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:32,803
Dad says my son...
will make a big name.

766
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:39,212
What was the issue
between the father and the son?

767
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:44,585
How would I know Sir? There must be
something private between them.

768
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,747
Aren't drivers supposed to know
everything private about their bosses?

769
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,317
Come on, speak up.

770
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:55,287
Sir..money must have
been the issue I presume.

771
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,189
Hmm.

772
01:00:58,121 --> 01:00:59,532
So then what happened?

773
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,297
Sir that night Tanmany Sir
and I we went back to the office.

774
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,264
It seemed like there again was
some issue that came up.

775
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:10,241
Someone called Mark was continuously
calling him and harassing him.

776
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,640
But I don't know why.

777
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,272
Mark, I know we had this conversation
hundred times.

778
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,083
But he's been busy for two days.

779
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,281
Look, two million is not a amount.

780
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,286
What do you mean, I don't deliver?
Mark, you knowl always deliver.

781
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:32,296
Mark,you listen to me.
My dad is out of station...

782
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,226
Hello? Hello?

783
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,309
Security!

784
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,717
Why is this locked? Open up!

785
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,292
What are you doing Tanmay?

786
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,561
Stay out.

787
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,438
What do you want?

788
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,299
Can you please tell me?

789
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,001
You mind your business.

790
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,169
Tanmay, please.

791
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,307
These are all important papers,
please.

792
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,113
This is my father's company!
Do you get that?

793
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,550
Get the hell out!

794
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,777
You should not be this way.

795
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,546
Please tell me what you want.

796
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,316
Tanmay, please try and understand.

797
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,521
That's Sir's laptop.

798
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,187
Where are you taking it?
- I know it's not mine.

799
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,039
Who got you the job here?

800
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:49,801
Me.

801
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,368
Who got your loan approved?

802
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,375
Me.

803
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,608
And you are trying to take my
position in this company!!!

804
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,812
But this is all mine.

805
01:02:59,208 --> 01:02:59,743
All of it.

806
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:05,056
In 5 years you have completely
taken over the company.

807
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,084
You were just the same in school also.

808
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,999
I told you, stay away from this!

809
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:32,678
And then?

810
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:39,052
Then Sir I have no idea
where he went after that.

811
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:43,225
He took the car with
him and I went home.

812
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:46,733
After that night I have neither
seen Tanmay Sir nor the car.

813
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:01,808
Give that to me.

814
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,181
Leave it I said.

815
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,442
Go ahead you do it.

816
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,722
This just needs some lubrication.

817
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:12,092
Brother this needs
to be discarded now.

818
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,152
Oh shut up! This is our mom's
wont even let anyone touch it.

819
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,630
Yeah, so good.

820
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,131
It's done, right. Let's go.
- Let's.

821
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,062
Do this, keep the keys in the pocket
and then...

822
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,365
Hey! ?

823
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,195
Hi.
- You're going somewhere?

824
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,365
Yes, we are going for Garba.

825
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,038
No dance class today?

826
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:32,203
No. Remember I told you today is
first day of Navratri.

827
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,613
So, yesterday was last of
your class.

828
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,410
Yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

829
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,177
Okay, guys. Have a good time.

830
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:40,611
Let's go.

831
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,452
Why not take along with us.

832
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,182
Where? Will she dance Garba
in this dress?35

833
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:49,024
What are you going to do with
your 25 sets of dress?

834
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:52,164
If you teach her it will be useful,
no?

835
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,393
Yeah, good.

836
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,119
Is it some girl?

837
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,320
Heartbreak?

838
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,425
No, dad, it's nothing like that.

839
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,128
Then what happened?

840
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:27,463
Just a bit stressed at work.

841
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,136
That's it?

842
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,262
Come with me for Garba.

843
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,307
And you will feel better.
All you need to do is just unwind a bit.

844
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:37,338
Dad please! Leave me alone.

845
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,136
Okay.

846
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,450
Food is ready.
Eat it while its hot.

847
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,494
Today I am gonna show.

848
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,034
Hello!

849
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:07,131
<i>Rain! What has happened to Faith'?</i>

850
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,467
He dint even go to the office today.
He is not even speaking much.

851
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,240
Did something happen at work?

852
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,373
Uncle you know how
stressful a lawyer's life is.

853
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,446
You don't worry about him.
You go have a good time.

854
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:18,712
Okay Okay.

855
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,712
Okay! Hows your girl doing?

856
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,083
She is changing clothes uncle.

857
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:27,059
No! Seriously?

858
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,651
I mean
she is getting ready for Garba.

859
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,288
God knows what you thought!

860
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,326
Okay Okay.

861
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:33,226
Okay, I will hang up.

862

Hey, she is wasting too much time.

I am so excited to do Garba.
I've been practicing all week.

877
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:24,312

Just a minute.

883
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,758

You did?

886
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,701
Tanmay has canceled your
loan application.

887
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,250
Sit inside the car
or I'll screw his happiness.

888
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,610
Sit inside the car.
Or I will ruin his happiness.

889
01:13:56,377 --> 01:13:58,687
Come! Lets play a game!

890
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:02,483
Put your hand down here.
Here!

891
01:14:06,454 --> 01:14:07,262
Birds?

892
01:14:07,755 --> 01:14:09,291
Say escape. Come on!

893
01:14:09,524 --> 01:14:11,800
Escapes!
- Escapes!

894
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:13,301
A Parrot?

895
01:14:13,561 --> 01:14:14,301
Escapes!

896
01:14:15,196 --> 01:14:16,300
A kite?
- Escapes!

897
01:14:16,497 --> 01:14:17,498
An aeroplane?
- Escapes!

898
01:14:17,599 --> 01:14:18,565
Tanmay?
- Escapes!

899
01:14:18,566 --> 01:14:19,340
There you are!!!

900
01:14:19,734 --> 01:14:21,145
Obviously he will escape.

901
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:25,310
He will escape after having
run into three people.

902
01:14:27,442 --> 01:14:29,285
So tell the truth? Where is he?

903
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:32,691
Sir I really have no idea about him.

904
01:14:33,414 --> 01:14:34,791
Enough now! Just say it.

905
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,152
I swear on you Sir I have no idea.

906
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:38,425
SPEAK THE HELL UP!

907
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,304
See this. It's 5 am now.

908
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:56,608
Anyway I am done with you.
Just leave.

909
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,544
Leave I said.

910
01:15:01,509 --> 01:15:03,079
And what about those 20 lakhs?

911
01:15:04,812 --> 01:15:07,190
Sir how will I arrange for
such a huge amount

912
01:15:13,288 --> 01:15:15,700
Do one thing. I liked your excuse.
So do this...

913
01:15:16,624 --> 01:15:18,661
Give me 5 lakh less.

914
01:15:19,294 --> 01:15:20,773
Why this discount, sir?

915
01:15:23,364 --> 01:15:24,468
Lets finalize this at 15 lakhs.

916
01:15:25,633 --> 01:15:27,340
Go manage 15 lakh.

917
01:15:27,635 --> 01:15:28,613
Leave leave!

918
01:15:31,472 --> 01:15:33,110
Makhwana! Where is Chawda?

919
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:35,312
Remember the old aged man?

920
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:37,217
He has gone to
meet him at the hospital.

921
01:15:37,278 --> 01:15:38,586
So early in the morning?

922
01:15:38,646 --> 01:15:41,718
Sir! Its been 48 hours now.

923
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:45,063
We are late already. not early.

924
01:15:45,153 --> 01:15:47,326
Sir can I sleep there?
- Okay.

925
01:15:48,556 --> 01:15:50,661
Condition is quite critical.

926
01:15:51,526 --> 01:15:52,766
Let's see what we can do.

927
01:15:53,528 --> 01:15:55,235
Will he be fine?

928
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:13,783
One who casued the accident,
he won't escape.

929
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:16,392
Hail Lord Kirshna.

930
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,394
Anticipatory bail is the need
of the hour.

931
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:27,534
Sir I would suggest that
we apply for an anticipatory bail.

932
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,207
I too say the same.

933
01:16:33,334 --> 01:16:34,404
For whom?

934
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:36,173
What do you mean?

935
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:38,807
Nobody has seen
Tanmay driving that car.

936
01:16:39,574 --> 01:16:41,053
There is no eye witness.

937
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:46,053
Then why apply for bail?

938
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:51,058
Sir, we might land in trouble later.

939
01:16:51,619 --> 01:16:53,690
Be realistic.
We all know the truth.

940
01:16:53,721 --> 01:16:55,598
Nobody knows the truth.

941
01:16:56,557 --> 01:16:59,333
Truth is what can be
proven in the court.

942
01:17:00,094 --> 01:17:04,338
Can you prove that Tanmay
was driving the car that night?

943
01:17:04,599 --> 01:17:06,272
Then that is not the truth.

944
01:17:09,303 --> 01:17:11,840
You guys don't have to
worry about the court trial.

945
01:17:12,373 --> 01:17:14,216
I am concerned about the
media trial.

946
01:17:14,242 --> 01:17:16,119
What can we say,
what can we show,

947
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:19,455
how can we stay clean
in public eyes.

948
01:17:20,081 --> 01:17:21,219
That's it.

949
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:36,470
The biggest question
here is being raised on

950
01:17:37,432 --> 01:17:42,780
Police Department's
inefficiency to solve the case yet.

951
01:17:43,771 --> 01:17:45,409
Out reports are trying their
best to reach to them...

952
01:17:45,606 --> 01:17:47,313
What? What are you looking at?

953
01:17:47,341 --> 01:17:48,445
Do your work. Look ahead!

954
01:17:48,543 --> 01:17:51,046
But no one is available
to comment on.

955
01:17:55,349 --> 01:17:57,420
Jitu's mother in law
will be cursed badly.

956
01:17:58,152 --> 01:18:00,132
Its all because of her.

957
01:18:01,222 --> 01:18:02,428
What the hell? What is this?

958
01:18:02,623 --> 01:18:03,431
Water Fountain!

959
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:06,363
Ya I can see that.
Why have you kept it here?

960
01:18:06,627 --> 01:18:08,402
Sir as per Chinese Vastu,

961
01:18:08,463 --> 01:18:11,672
if you keep this here all your
problems will be washed away.

962
01:18:11,732 --> 01:18:15,202
Wow! Too great you all are. Aren't you?

963
01:18:17,705 --> 01:18:19,480
Hey Makhwana!
- Yes Sir

964
01:18:20,074 --> 01:18:23,453
We are in such deep shit
and what clips are you all watching?

965
01:18:23,678 --> 01:18:25,487
Sir you gotta watch this to believe it.

966
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,259
Come here! Have a look.

967
01:18:27,348 --> 01:18:28,224
Everyone come!

968
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:34,297
See this.

969
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:53,643
Wow! This is jackpot!

970
01:18:57,812 --> 01:19:00,088
Fix my meeting with Mr. Amitabh Shah.

971
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:10,134
Mr. Gohil.

972
01:19:10,725 --> 01:19:13,069
H i. Abheet Shah.

973
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:17,106
Mr Gohil. Please make
yourself comfortable. ?

974
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:19,539
What I need you can't provide.

975
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:22,678
I mean you can't give
your statement.1

976
01:19:24,071 --> 01:19:26,210
Can we please call Mr. Amitabh Shah?

977
01:19:26,407 --> 01:19:27,511
He must be here any moment.

978
01:19:27,808 --> 01:19:29,082
And...

979
01:19:33,181 --> 01:19:35,559
GJ-RVI-1111.

980
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:40,495
Is this car yours?

981
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:47,367
Yes.

982
01:19:56,204 --> 01:19:59,208
Whose name is that car under?

983
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,515
Tanmay Shah.

984
01:20:04,245 --> 01:20:05,815
Where would the car be right novfl

985
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,452
Got stolen.

986
01:20:07,782 --> 01:20:11,320
In fact, today itself we have
filed a missing complaint.

987
01:20:13,287 --> 01:20:15,528
You guys got a bit late there!

988
01:20:17,725 --> 01:20:18,567
But that's fine.

989
01:20:20,428 --> 01:20:24,171
Who all have driven that car?

990
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:25,472
Me.

991
01:20:25,766 --> 01:20:28,474
Drivers and sometimes Sir.

992
01:20:31,505 --> 01:20:32,506
And Tanmay?

993
01:20:33,107 --> 01:20:34,484
Tanmay

994
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:36,245
One minute hang on.

995
01:20:37,178 --> 01:20:41,024
Why don't you let
Mr. Amitabh Shah only speak?

996
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:42,591
Sir.

997
01:20:43,084 --> 01:20:45,257
He doesn't know to drive in India.

998
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:50,569
In fact he doesn't know
how to drive Indian cars.

999
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:55,671
I thought as much.
Hope he knows how to swim in India.

1000
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:02,445
Okay, never mind.

1001
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:07,117
Where was Tanmay the
night accident happened?

1002
01:21:08,643 --> 01:21:10,281
Out of town.
- ls it?

1003
01:21:21,088 --> 01:21:22,465
I guess I am done.

1004
01:21:23,357 --> 01:21:25,496
Abhijeet will attend to you now.

1005
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:27,597
Hey! You got an I Phone?

1006
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:30,531
Me too.

1007
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:34,172
Its got a great video quality.

1008
01:21:34,302 --> 01:21:35,110
Have a look.

1009
01:21:39,006 --> 01:21:40,542
Have a look.

1010
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:15,611
Congratulations Sir!

1011
01:22:16,143 --> 01:22:18,282
You son has suddenly learned
how to drive an Indian car.

1012
01:22:22,383 --> 01:22:25,626
He was driving the car also and he also
happened to be in town that night.

1013
01:22:26,187 --> 01:22:31,364
Just about 19 minutes before
the accident happened.

1014
01:22:32,193 --> 01:22:33,604
Too cool that is, isn't it?

1015
01:22:34,328 --> 01:22:37,502
Even the thief for that matter.
In about 19 minutes he stole the car

1016
01:22:38,032 --> 01:22:39,636
and ran also into three people.

1017
01:22:41,001 --> 01:22:42,173
Too fast isn't it?

1018
01:22:42,303 --> 01:22:44,146
Just like that film Fast and Furious!

1019
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:45,615
Haven't you seen?

1020
01:22:46,273 --> 01:22:46,774
What?

1021
01:22:47,475 --> 01:22:49,682
Fast and Furious.
That film with that bald guy in it.

1022
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,586
Okay leave it.

1023
01:22:54,415 --> 01:22:57,726
Anyway if you are saying so
then all of this must be true only.

1024
01:22:59,387 --> 01:23:01,628
You have never been
proven wrong anyway.

1025
01:23:02,022 --> 01:23:04,263
As for the rest, thanks for the food.

1026
01:23:05,025 --> 01:23:05,469
How did you make it?

1027
01:23:23,611 --> 01:23:25,682
Brother! 2 crores!

1028
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,457
Cash in advance.

1029
01:23:28,549 --> 01:23:29,619
Without guarantee.

1030
01:23:31,085 --> 01:23:33,691
We didn't really have any other option.

1031
01:23:34,522 --> 01:23:36,695
We gotta find a scapegoat now

1032
01:23:37,158 --> 01:23:39,195
who will admit to have
stolen the car that night.

1033
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,467
Abhijeet. The guy is in the net.

1034
01:23:42,096 --> 01:23:43,700
Tell the security to let him in.

1035
01:23:47,435 --> 01:23:49,745
Sir, these cops are strange guys.

1036
01:23:50,504 --> 01:23:53,508
How will a common man like
me arrange for so much money?

1037
01:23:54,141 --> 01:23:56,485
Sir!
Please help me. Only you can.

1038
01:23:58,179 --> 01:23:59,783
The cops have been calling me everyday.

1039
01:24:01,749 --> 01:24:03,353
They were asking me about Tanmay Sir.

1040
01:24:04,585 --> 01:24:06,656
But I swear Sir I haven't said
anything wrong about him.

1041
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:09,759
Please Sir.

1042
01:24:11,559 --> 01:24:12,765
Please help me Sir.

1043
01:24:30,144 --> 01:24:31,487
Can I also have some biscuits please?

1044
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:46,570
Sir but?
- Sit down Raju!

1045
01:24:47,328 --> 01:24:49,399
These are yours. Take them.

1046
01:24:50,364 --> 01:24:51,775
You have been working
with me since 3 years now.

1047
01:24:52,533 --> 01:24:53,705
I can surely do this much for you.

1048
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:57,448
Take it.

1049
01:24:58,439 --> 01:24:59,611
You've been driving a lot.

1050
01:25:11,118 --> 01:25:11,858
Put them in your bag.

1051
01:25:12,753 --> 01:25:13,424
No, sir.

1052
01:25:18,292 --> 01:25:19,771
You just gotta sign this.

1053
01:25:28,769 --> 01:25:29,804
Sir this

1054
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:34,311
this says you were
driving that car that night.

1055
01:25:36,277 --> 01:25:37,688
Which car Sir?

1056
01:25:38,212 --> 01:25:41,216
Your car that you have
been driving everyday.

1057
01:25:44,184 --> 01:25:46,790
But Sir you know
I wasn't in the car that night.

1058
01:25:48,255 --> 01:25:49,359
Raju

1059
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:52,262
If you get booked under PASA,

1060
01:25:52,459 --> 01:25:54,405
you will be sentenced
an 8 year prison term.

1061
01:25:54,728 --> 01:25:57,265
And in Hit and RunB years.

1062
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:02,703
You trust me right?

1063
01:26:04,638 --> 01:26:06,345
You are like family to us.

1064
01:26:07,241 --> 01:26:09,482
I will get you out in just one day.

1065
01:26:11,245 --> 01:26:12,485
Sign that document now.

1066
01:26:19,853 --> 01:26:21,730
Its a matter of just one day in prison.

1067
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:30,803
Sir I would need some
time to think about this.

1068
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:32,199
Raju

1069
01:26:34,201 --> 01:26:37,580
Had you been able to think,
you wouldn't have been a driver today.

1070
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,811
Leave the thinking to me.

1071
01:27:01,261 --> 01:27:03,639
Sorry Sir, I left my bag behind.

1072
01:27:19,313 --> 01:27:22,817
Why dint you come earlier?
Its been 2 days now.

1073
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:26,428
Parth Sir I dint want to involve
myself in this controversy that's why.

1074
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:29,494
And trust me, I am speaking the truth.

1075
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,463
How am I supposed to believe
you that you have seen the accident?

1076
01:27:33,427 --> 01:27:36,067
Parth Sir I have told you every
little thing that I have seen.

1077
01:27:37,264 --> 01:27:39,107
I am ready to be a witness also.

1078
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:44,406
Please can you arrange
for 15 lakhs for me?

1079
01:27:45,305 --> 01:27:46,682
15 lakhs?

1080
01:27:48,308 --> 01:27:50,515
How would I have so much money?

1081
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:55,089
Raju how the hell are
you going to arrange for

1082
01:27:55,282 --> 01:27:59,128
so much money in a day's time now?

1083
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,090
Why are you screaming at him?

1084
01:28:01,321 --> 01:28:02,698
What the hell am I supposed to do then?

1085
01:28:02,723 --> 01:28:04,703
Should I worship him?

1086
01:28:04,758 --> 01:28:10,470
I had warned him so many times
not to do bootlegging here.

1087
01:28:10,597 --> 01:28:12,508
Now face the consequences.

1088
01:28:15,335 --> 01:28:16,541
How much money do
you actually have Raju?

1089
01:28:17,538 --> 01:28:19,176
Just about one lakh.

1090
01:28:20,641 --> 01:28:22,143
Any other savings?

1091
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,485
I guess about 20000-25000.

1092
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:27,652
Okay. I can arrange for
almost a lakh from my side.

1093
01:28:29,616 --> 01:28:30,560
Come on lets go!

1094
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:31,695
Where?

1095
01:28:32,286 --> 01:28:35,096
Don't we have to arrange
for more money?

1096
01:28:58,812 --> 01:29:01,759
2 Trucks! Each truck
will carry 2000 bottles.

1097
01:29:02,349 --> 01:29:04,693
Total 4000 bottles.
Speak up!

1098
01:29:06,653 --> 01:29:08,462
<i>What are you thinking Rain'?</i>

1099
01:29:08,689 --> 01:29:11,602
The cops are asking for 15 lakhs for
those 15 bottles you were caught with

1100
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:14,663
and now with 4000 bottles,
can you even imagine the consequences?

1101
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:29,483
We have just been
able to arrange 4 lakhs.

1102
01:29:29,777 --> 01:29:32,018
<i>This is not so easy Rain.</i>

1103
01:29:32,346 --> 01:29:35,156
We will never be able to
arrange for 15 lakhs this way.

1104
01:29:35,716 --> 01:29:37,627
I gotta find some other way.

1105
01:29:38,051 --> 01:29:39,121
You do one thing

1106
01:29:39,787 --> 01:29:42,165
Tell your sister Dhara to leave
this city first, to your native place.

1107
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:45,491
Patil Sir..Why Dhara.

1108
01:29:45,492 --> 01:29:49,133
Just trust me when I am saying this.

1109
01:30:15,823 --> 01:30:18,269
Raju! Shut the door
immediately and listen to me.

1110
01:30:21,461 --> 01:30:22,701
Where were you thinking of going?

1111
01:30:23,764 --> 01:30:24,572
My native place.

1112
01:30:30,771 --> 01:30:32,182
Take this. This is 15 lakhs.

1113
01:30:34,374 --> 01:30:35,512
Don't say a word!

1114
01:30:35,676 --> 01:30:39,522
If I tell you where this money has come
from, you wont ever take it from me.

1115
01:30:46,553 --> 01:30:48,032
Its fine now.
Go.

1116
01:30:48,055 --> 01:30:50,126
Take care.

1117
01:30:50,591 --> 01:30:52,798
Go.

1118
01:30:58,098 --> 01:31:01,136
You're sure this is his house?
- Yes, it is, sir.

1119
01:31:10,577 --> 01:31:12,113
Where are you off to?

1120
01:31:13,413 --> 01:31:14,255
Police Station.

1121
01:31:14,381 --> 01:31:16,258
The police station
itself has come to you.

1122
01:31:19,219 --> 01:31:20,664
Can't seem to remember Dinya.

1123
01:31:22,556 --> 01:31:24,263
What was that Somabhai song?

1124
01:31:24,591 --> 01:31:25,569
Sir!
- Yes.

1125
01:31:25,659 --> 01:31:27,605
The song was called
Somabhai's brother in law

1126
01:31:27,828 --> 01:31:28,772
Yeah.

1127
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,350
Shell out cash!

1128
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:49,291
Sir I was just coming
to give this to you.

1129
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:52,256
15 lakhs?

1130
01:31:54,021 --> 01:31:56,058
Sit! Sit down here!
Sit next to me.

1131
01:31:56,456 --> 01:31:58,231
Sit Mr. Bambani please.

1132
01:31:58,492 --> 01:31:59,732
This is your own house.

1133
01:32:00,127 --> 01:32:01,265
You are too good man!

1134
01:32:01,662 --> 01:32:04,268
In 2 days you could
arrange for 15 lakhs.

1135
01:32:04,598 --> 01:32:05,633
Robbed a bank?

1136
01:32:06,233 --> 01:32:09,305
Something wrong you must have done.

1137
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:13,208
Did you see this?
2 days, 15 lakhs, cash.

1138
01:32:18,412 --> 01:32:20,722
So, Mr. Bambani,
you are out of PASA now.

1139
01:32:21,315 --> 01:32:22,316
How about a drink?

1140
01:32:24,518 --> 01:32:25,326
Tea.

1141
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,230
I meant tea.

1142
01:32:28,622 --> 01:32:30,101
What will you have?
- Green Tea.

1143
01:32:33,493 --> 01:32:34,233
Tea.

1144
01:32:58,552 --> 01:33:00,361
I wont have 2 cups, just one.

1145
01:33:01,722 --> 01:33:03,702
Too much of it causes acidity.

1146
01:33:09,062 --> 01:33:09,767
Lets go.

1147
01:33:11,531 --> 01:33:12,305
Shall we?

1148
01:33:13,533 --> 01:33:14,341
Where?

1149
01:33:15,168 --> 01:33:16,169
Your favorite place.

1150
01:33:37,657 --> 01:33:39,659
Good morning, everyone.

1151
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:45,403
On the night of accident,
my car was driven by my driver Ranu.

1152
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:49,442
And Mr. Tanmay was in the back seat.

1153
01:33:51,138 --> 01:33:53,175
Pol ice arrested Raj u.

1154
01:34:01,148 --> 01:34:03,628
And soon he'll be presented
in the court.

1155
01:34:09,689 --> 01:34:11,430
This is a open and shut case.

1156
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:13,399
How many days for remand?

1157
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,300
15.

1158
01:34:18,165 --> 01:34:19,337
2 days.

1159
01:34:20,734 --> 01:34:24,238
I will like to thank the police,
especially the media.

1160
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:31,086
Who says media is bad
and misguides?

1161
01:34:31,611 --> 01:34:33,147
Here is a good example.

1162
01:34:33,613 --> 01:34:34,751
Thank you.

1163
01:34:59,673 --> 01:35:01,675
We are trying our best
brother to fond Tanmay.

1164
01:35:02,275 --> 01:35:04,277
We are tracking his India
and Malaysia phone numbers,

1165
01:35:04,344 --> 01:35:05,482
credit cards, bank accounts but.

1166
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,488
His phone and credit
cards have shown some activity.

1167
01:35:08,148 --> 01:35:10,321
We are monitoring everything
but there is no...

1168
01:35:42,315 --> 01:35:44,818
We have to managed to track
the phone and credit cards.

1169
01:35:46,586 --> 01:35:50,090
The location id Malaysia.
He seems to be in Malaysia.

1170
01:35:56,396 --> 01:36:01,277
We are getting screwed here because
of him and he is having fun in Malaysia.

1171
01:36:02,135 --> 01:36:03,512
We will get

1172
01:36:03,737 --> 01:36:06,513
we will get in touch with him soon.

1173
01:36:10,343 --> 01:36:12,323
Who's the first witness here?
Speak up.

1174
01:36:12,412 --> 01:36:13,482
I am...
- Yeah, go ahead.

1175
01:36:13,647 --> 01:36:16,526
My name is Ramesh Bhai
Kachra Bhai Parmar.

1176
01:36:16,716 --> 01:36:17,383
Oh wow!

1177
01:36:17,384 --> 01:36:19,557
I have my tea stall.

1178
01:36:19,753 --> 01:36:23,257
I saw the accident from my eyes.

1179
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:25,561
And my eye is fit.

1180
01:36:25,592 --> 01:36:27,128
Okay, okay, I got that!

1181
01:36:27,294 --> 01:36:28,432
Sign here.

1182
01:36:29,196 --> 01:36:32,302
I will have to give thumb impression.

1183
01:36:35,035 --> 01:36:35,809
Here.

1184
01:36:37,771 --> 01:36:39,546
Whats going on?

1185
01:36:40,173 --> 01:36:41,516
Whats this food stall guy doing here?

1186
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:43,119
Sir he is the second witness.

1187
01:36:43,276 --> 01:36:43,754
Is it?

1188
01:36:44,611 --> 01:36:45,282
Start speaking

1189
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,293
Sir I was on that road that night.

1190
01:36:48,415 --> 01:36:51,521
And at about 1 am I saw
a damaged car passing by.

1191
01:36:51,785 --> 01:36:53,162
Can you recognize the driver?

1192
01:36:53,286 --> 01:36:54,264
Yes Sir.

1193
01:36:54,287 --> 01:36:55,288
Turn around.

1194
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:57,795
Was it him?

1195
01:36:58,758 --> 01:36:59,566
Seems like it was him Sir.

1196
01:36:59,759 --> 01:37:01,432
Seems like?

1197
01:37:01,728 --> 01:37:03,298
Was it him or no?

1198
01:37:04,464 --> 01:37:06,535
Yes Sir. It was him only.
I am sure Sir.

1199
01:37:07,067 --> 01:37:08,307
Okay sign here

1200
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:11,214
DO it!

1201
01:37:16,276 --> 01:37:19,155
A rich man never runs out of
witnesses when he needs them.

1202
01:37:19,346 --> 01:37:20,825
There are always more
than enough of those.

1203
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:24,324
Leave.

1204
01:38:11,598 --> 01:38:13,168
Good evening, Mr. Shah.

1205
01:38:15,735 --> 01:38:17,612
Mr. Shah good evening.
Can you hear me?

1206
01:38:18,071 --> 01:38:20,608
Yes, Shraddha.
I am only 55.

1207
01:38:21,141 --> 01:38:24,145
And I think I hear you crystal clear.
Tell me what is your question.

1208
01:38:30,183 --> 01:38:35,030
First night of Navaratri, a car comes
in and crashes three people.

1209
01:38:35,555 --> 01:38:38,058
Car has disappeared along with
its owner.

1210
01:38:38,425 --> 01:38:41,406
Hit and run is not new
in this country, sir.

1211
01:38:41,594 --> 01:38:44,131
But this case is a bit complected.

1212
01:38:44,364 --> 01:38:46,310
What do you mean, Shraddha?

1213
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:48,646
Let me come straight to the point.
- Please.

1214
01:38:49,035 --> 01:38:50,343
Where is Tanmay Shah?

1215
01:38:52,272 --> 01:38:54,548
I too am looking for him.
I am his father.

1216
01:38:55,308 --> 01:38:57,584
Mr. Shah is Tanmay the culprit?

1217
01:38:58,144 --> 01:39:00,624
That's what you and everybody thinks.

1218
01:39:01,648 --> 01:39:03,628
Because my driver Raju is poor

1219
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:06,360
and Tanmay Shah, my son, is rich...

1220
01:39:06,686 --> 01:39:08,393
It's human psychology

1221
01:39:08,688 --> 01:39:12,226
and general perception is that
rich are always at fault.

1222
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:15,363
If a scooter and BMW
get into an accident

1223
01:39:15,395 --> 01:39:18,706
people presume that the the
BMW guy is wrong.

1224
01:39:19,099 --> 01:39:22,478
Mr. Shah, if Tanmay has not
caused the accident, why is he hiding?

1225
01:39:24,604 --> 01:39:27,244
I feel, when the accident took place

1226
01:39:27,407 --> 01:39:30,616
he was shocked. And has gone
somewhere due to the trauma.

1227
01:39:31,511 --> 01:39:34,253
Tanmy went someplace due to trauma?

1228
01:39:34,447 --> 01:39:37,223
But due to him an innocent man
is behind bars.

1229
01:39:37,384 --> 01:39:40,126
How can you say that Raju
is innocent?

1230
01:39:40,487 --> 01:39:43,297
And how can you say
that your son is innocent?

1231
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:46,371
It's not me saying,
it's cops' version.

1232
01:39:47,026 --> 01:39:50,098
They have arrested him.
There must be some reason.

1233
01:39:50,463 --> 01:39:53,444
Police began their work
two days later.

1234
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,672
There must be a reason
for that too, right?

1235
01:39:54,801 --> 01:39:57,441
Could be.
Police will surely tell you.

1236
01:39:58,538 --> 01:40:01,485
However, for now police
has evidence against Raju.

1237
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:05,579
Sir, it's obvious.
You're trying to implicate Raj u.

1238
01:40:05,812 --> 01:40:10,420
Exactly. By saying so, you are
trying to implicate my son.

1239
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:11,688
His son only must have done it.

1240
01:40:12,585 --> 01:40:15,122
Man, this is how it has always been.
Everyone knows what the truth is.

1241
01:40:15,255 --> 01:40:17,701
And now we head to our old section.

1242
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:51,693
Hi, Panh.

1243
01:40:59,232 --> 01:41:00,438
Sir you?

1244
01:41:01,668 --> 01:41:03,477
Hows your father feeling now?

1245
01:41:06,406 --> 01:41:07,441
He is better.

1246
01:41:09,142 --> 01:41:10,382
How are the doctors here?

1247
01:41:13,112 --> 01:41:13,590
Good.

1248
01:41:15,548 --> 01:41:16,458
Son

1249
01:41:19,185 --> 01:41:20,755
Whatever happened was wrong.

1250
01:41:22,322 --> 01:41:24,324
Don't lose faith please.

1251
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,230
Don't you worry.

1252
01:41:28,595 --> 01:41:31,542
If need be, we will take him to
America for treatment.

1253
01:41:32,398 --> 01:41:33,468
I am there.

1254
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:42,279
By the way
I want to ask you something.

1255
01:41:44,444 --> 01:41:48,187
Tanmay took my laptop away that night.

1256
01:41:48,548 --> 01:41:50,186
Do you remember anything about it?

1257
01:41:52,552 --> 01:41:54,725
It had a lot of important data.

1258
01:41:56,222 --> 01:41:58,429
I need that laptop

1259
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,773
I presumed you came here to show
concern towards my father's health.

1260
01:42:05,164 --> 01:42:08,441
Parth try and understand. I am just

1261
01:42:08,635 --> 01:42:12,777
No Sir. I cant seem to understand you.

1262
01:42:14,173 --> 01:42:17,279
In fact it seems like
I don't know you only.

1263
01:42:20,246 --> 01:42:22,658
What you are doing is wrong Sir.

1264
01:42:23,182 --> 01:42:24,354
You are wrong, sir.

1265
01:42:40,433 --> 01:42:41,605
I am wrong?

1266
01:42:42,168 --> 01:42:44,409
There is nothing right here, Parth.

1267
01:42:44,671 --> 01:42:48,016
Since Darwin only one thing
has worked in this world -

1268
01:42:48,274 --> 01:42:50,584
Survival of the fittest!

1269
01:42:50,643 --> 01:42:54,750
Those who can fight and win,
can only survive!

1270
01:42:56,482 --> 01:43:01,761
I have fought against this whole world,
this system, this society!

1271
01:43:03,556 --> 01:43:07,595
That's why I have been unbeaten
and have been able to survive still.

1272
01:43:09,295 --> 01:43:14,768
I made this business empire -
Amitabh Shah and Associates.

1273
01:43:15,201 --> 01:43:16,737
And you are just an employee of that.

1274
01:43:17,403 --> 01:43:20,475
And you are calling me wrong!

1275
01:43:21,441 --> 01:43:22,715
Enough Sir.

1276
01:43:24,243 --> 01:43:25,244
Thank you!

1277
01:43:25,378 --> 01:43:27,551
Visiting hours are over, sir.

1278
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:53,082
Another twist in Tanmay Shah's
hit and run case.

1279
01:43:53,239 --> 01:43:55,219
Amitabh Shah's $100 million

1280
01:43:55,408 --> 01:43:59,322
or 650 crores un accounted foreign
funds' details are leaked.

1281
01:43:59,612 --> 01:44:03,116
Amitabh's son is still absconding.

1282
01:44:03,349 --> 01:44:06,819
And now his low cost housing project
VISAMO

1283
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:10,157
is in news for huge scam.

1284
01:44:10,723 --> 01:44:15,172
The money invested in this project,
is the very un accounted foreign funds.

1285
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:20,538
Only Amitabh Shah can tell how much
corruption is invoked in construction of VISAMO.

1286
01:44:26,139 --> 01:44:27,140
Brother.

1287
01:44:33,413 --> 01:44:38,556
How did the details of the low
cost housing society project leak?

1288
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,733
You know the answer, brother.
Tanmay has your laptop...

1289
01:44:45,124 --> 01:44:46,797
Just shut up!

1290
01:44:51,431 --> 01:44:53,570
We need to find him now!

1291
01:45:31,137 --> 01:45:32,514
What a dumb ass
my son turned out to be!

1292
01:45:32,772 --> 01:45:38,085
First he takes my laptop away,
then runs his car over 3 people

1293
01:45:38,478 --> 01:45:41,823
and then runs away to Malaysia

1294
01:45:42,381 --> 01:45:47,831
and that too to someone
who he owed money to.

1295
01:45:48,421 --> 01:45:50,799
So Mark will blackmail us now?

1296
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:52,533
Yes!

1297
01:45:53,392 --> 01:45:55,201
Tanmay is with him.

1298
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,554
Complaint at the other desk.

1299
01:46:20,653 --> 01:46:22,257
Didn't you just hear what I said?

1300
01:46:22,455 --> 01:46:24,264
Makhwana! Attend to him.

1301
01:46:25,224 --> 01:46:28,296
Sir he is the son of the old aged
victim who is in the hospital.

1302
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,505
Yes Sir. What can I do for you?

1303
01:46:36,669 --> 01:46:40,446
I have cracked the case.
Now everything else lies with the court.

1304
01:46:43,142 --> 01:46:47,147
I have not come here as victim's
son but as the accused's lawyer.

1305
01:46:52,819 --> 01:46:53,797
For him?

1306
01:46:54,153 --> 01:46:54,722
Yes.

1307
01:46:54,754 --> 01:46:58,292
Sir! I hope you know he is
responsible for your father's condition.

1308
01:46:58,758 --> 01:47:00,635
And you want to defend him?- Yes.

1309
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:04,064
You have a problem?

1310
01:47:05,231 --> 01:47:07,734
I am representing Raju Bambani.

1311
01:47:10,469 --> 01:47:12,278
These are the papers for his bail.

1312
01:47:13,506 --> 01:47:15,816
Bail is it?
Good.

1313
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:18,721
<i>6</i> pm.

1314
01:47:19,478 --> 01:47:22,288
After we take him into remand is
when we will talk. Okay?

1315
01:47:22,615 --> 01:47:24,288
This is a bailable offense.

1316
01:47:25,785 --> 01:47:27,321
I said after remand!

1317
01:47:29,589 --> 01:47:30,499
Okay.

1318
01:47:40,466 --> 01:47:43,208
Sir there has been a problem.

1319
01:47:45,037 --> 01:47:47,313
Victim's son is now defending Raju.

1320
01:47:48,507 --> 01:47:49,781
Whats the problem there?

1321
01:47:50,676 --> 01:47:52,815
Sir you know its a bailable offense.

1322
01:47:53,479 --> 01:47:54,583
I will have to grant bail.

1323
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,557
No, no, no. You can't.

1324
01:47:59,485 --> 01:48:01,294
Sir then what other option do we have?

1325
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:06,231
File the charge sheet today itself.

1326
01:48:07,159 --> 01:48:08,695
Hows that possible Sir?

1327
01:48:08,761 --> 01:48:10,297
Its been only 5 days till now and

1328
01:48:10,496 --> 01:48:12,737
the court has granted 60 days
to file the charge sheet.

1329
01:48:13,065 --> 01:48:15,636
I will come under the scanner Sir.

1330
01:48:16,636 --> 01:48:20,846
There is no such rule anywhere that
in 5 days charge sheet cant be filed.

1331
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:25,145
Sir but.

1332
01:48:26,679 --> 01:48:31,059
Do what you have been told!!!

1333
01:48:34,053 --> 01:48:39,093
In the Ghodapur by pass accident
case the police have already filed

1334
01:48:39,125 --> 01:48:41,259
the charge sheet which seems pretty
unusual in a high profile case

1335
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:45,106
like as it quite seems
that the police are

1336
01:48:45,197 --> 01:48:51,273
trying to save Amitabh
Shah's son, Tanmay Shah.

1337
01:48:53,606 --> 01:48:57,383
Do you guys have any idea how
badly we are being spoken of?

1338
01:48:58,577 --> 01:49:01,353
Charge sheet of such a high
profile case filed in 5 days

1339
01:49:04,116 --> 01:49:05,652
Who's this Gohil?

1340
01:49:06,218 --> 01:49:07,390
Suspend him!

1341
01:49:08,587 --> 01:49:09,361
But Sir

1342
01:49:11,123 --> 01:49:13,125
Amitabh Shah is playing it very smart.

1343
01:49:13,559 --> 01:49:15,368
How can he file the
charge sheet in 5 days?

1344
01:49:15,728 --> 01:49:18,208
Even I understand that much law
to know that this cant happen.

1345
01:49:18,597 --> 01:49:20,133
You guys don't worry.

1346
01:49:20,266 --> 01:49:23,372
Tomorrow I am going to file a
quashing petition against this.

1347
01:49:34,246 --> 01:49:37,056
Mehta listen!

1348
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,026
Tomorrow its all in your hands.

1349
01:49:40,553 --> 01:49:42,123
Don't mess it up please.

1350
01:49:42,555 --> 01:49:45,365
Am it, just relax.

1351
01:49:45,458 --> 01:49:48,098
I am worried.
- I told you not to worry...

1352
01:49:49,161 --> 01:49:51,038
You know I will take care of everything.

1353
01:49:51,764 --> 01:49:53,675
I will take the brief from you.

1354
01:49:54,066 --> 01:49:55,067
Okay, Thanks.

1355
01:50:00,272 --> 01:50:01,751
The Ghodapur by pass hit and run case

1356
01:50:01,774 --> 01:50:03,378
is coming with new twists
every single day.

1357
01:50:03,609 --> 01:50:08,319
Today the victim's son Parth Parikh has
come to the rescue of Raju Bambani

1358
01:50:08,414 --> 01:50:11,327
and have filed a quashing petition.

1359
01:50:15,588 --> 01:50:20,435
The investigating officer Gohil has been
suspended for 2 months from the case.

1360
01:50:22,261 --> 01:50:25,242
Still you haven't understood?
Try and understand me.

1361
01:50:25,631 --> 01:50:27,474
Whatever amount you asked for,
I gave it to you.

1362
01:50:27,733 --> 01:50:29,110
You saw what happened to Gohil right?

1363
01:50:29,368 --> 01:50:32,144
The media is not going to
spare anyone this time.

1364
01:50:32,571 --> 01:50:35,381
Please help me Sir.
You knowl haven't done anything.

1365
01:50:36,042 --> 01:50:38,613
This is the only way out for you now.

1366
01:50:39,245 --> 01:50:41,725
In the latest development,
in the Ghodapur hit and run case

1367
01:50:41,747 --> 01:50:44,785
the victim's son has filed
a quashing petition in the court.

1368
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,625
Please understand, if you don't
support us then you'll also land in trouble

1369
01:50:49,655 --> 01:50:51,726
Please understand, if you don't
support us

1370
01:50:51,757 --> 01:50:54,101
then you'll also land in trouble.
Please understand.

1371
01:50:54,593 --> 01:50:56,334
Ok, fine I am with you.

1372
01:52:10,102 --> 01:52:12,605
Mr Parth Parikh has appealed that

1373
01:52:13,272 --> 01:52:15,479
that he has valid proof,

1374
01:52:16,509 --> 01:52:23,552
to quash the charge sheet filed against
his client, Raju Govindbhai Bambani,

1375
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:26,191
Thank you, Your Lordship.

1376
01:52:27,253 --> 01:52:32,066
I think, Mr. Parth does not have any
such valid proof

1377
01:52:32,491 --> 01:52:37,304
by which the charges in this charge sheet
can be denied and quashed.

1378
01:52:38,063 --> 01:52:41,237
Sir I wouldn't have taken up this
case had I not had any proofs.

1379
01:52:41,267 --> 01:52:42,439
What are the proofs?

1380
01:52:43,102 --> 01:52:47,107
Sir, I would like to showcase
this CCTV footage.

1381
01:52:48,707 --> 01:52:49,708
Excuse me Sir!

1382
01:52:50,075 --> 01:52:50,746
This is not allowed.

1383
01:52:50,776 --> 01:52:53,086
Hey, why... why not allowed?

1384
01:52:53,712 --> 01:52:56,022
Sir Mr. Shah is not a prosecution
lawyer, he cant object.

1385
01:52:56,048 --> 01:52:57,527
Sir, we cant run the video here.

1386
01:52:57,716 --> 01:53:00,458
This is a court,
not some video parlor.

1387
01:53:00,686 --> 01:53:01,494
This CD first needs to be
tested and approved

1388
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,290
for its authenticity NY
the Forensic Department

1389
01:53:03,389 --> 01:53:05,426
and only then we can run it here.

1390
01:53:05,491 --> 01:53:07,437
Sir this CD belongs to the police records

1391
01:53:07,493 --> 01:53:11,373
and sub inspector Makhwana has
given its approval on its authenticity.

1392
01:53:15,234 --> 01:53:17,578
Sir the CD was a part of the FIR

1393
01:53:18,037 --> 01:53:21,280
so I don't think its authenticity
needs to be questioned.

1394
01:53:22,141 --> 01:53:23,552
You may continue.

1395
01:53:35,821 --> 01:53:38,461
My Lord, we can all very
clearly see that Tanmay Shah is

1396
01:53:38,557 --> 01:53:40,366
the one who sat in the
driving seat that night.

1397
01:53:40,392 --> 01:53:41,564
Wait a minute.
- What one minute?

1398
01:53:41,627 --> 01:53:43,129
This proof is not admissible.

1399
01:53:43,162 --> 01:53:45,369
Sir, Mr. Shah is not a prosecutor.
He cannot argue, sir.

1400
01:53:45,764 --> 01:53:48,142
Sir, please.
- Please, Amit...

1401
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,476
Please. I am sorry, sir.

1402
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:52,413
But as everybody can see

1403
01:53:52,471 --> 01:53:57,648
we only see that Tanmay Shah
was only sitting in the car.

1404
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:02,349
Nowhere is it being established
that its the driving seat.

1405
01:54:03,215 --> 01:54:07,095
Sir it looks like my old friend
is suffering from dyslexia here.

1406
01:54:07,286 --> 01:54:08,526
Sorry what?

1407
01:54:08,621 --> 01:54:10,464
Dyslexia! Remember it was
shown to have happened to that

1408
01:54:10,823 --> 01:54:12,598
small kid in that film
'Taare Zameen Par'?

1409
01:54:12,858 --> 01:54:14,633
Confusion between left and right!

1410
01:54:15,094 --> 01:54:16,664
Mr Parth, can we move on please?

1411
01:54:17,096 --> 01:54:18,473
Sorry, My Lord.

1412
01:54:19,231 --> 01:54:21,438
Sir we can clearly see that
Tanmany Shah has entered the car

1413
01:54:21,467 --> 01:54:23,413
from the right door.

1414
01:54:23,535 --> 01:54:25,640
Ya Sir but the car is
actually a left hand drive.

1415
01:54:25,838 --> 01:54:26,543
What?

1416
01:54:27,172 --> 01:54:30,415
Yes Sir. The car was a modified car!

1417
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:37,590
I have got these modification
papers from the workshop.

1418
01:54:39,818 --> 01:54:41,263
Sir that's not true!

1419
01:54:41,287 --> 01:54:43,154
I have been working in this
company since 8 years

1420
01:54:43,155 --> 01:54:46,364
and I know for a fact that this
car is a right hand drive.

1421
01:54:46,592 --> 01:54:48,663
I mean left...right hand drive, sir.

1422
01:54:50,062 --> 01:54:54,272
Seems like that Parth has that
Taare Zameen problem.

1423
01:54:55,601 --> 01:54:57,308
Silence! Silence!

1424
01:54:57,469 --> 01:55:00,245
Enough of all this nonsense. Ok?

1425
01:55:00,472 --> 01:55:02,645
Mr. Parth, you may continue.

1426
01:55:03,575 --> 01:55:06,522
Sir, all these documents are fake!

1427
01:55:06,779 --> 01:55:08,087
I object Sir!

1428
01:55:08,147 --> 01:55:12,220
You don't have to conclude
Mr Parth, you need to prove it.

1429
01:55:12,451 --> 01:55:13,657
Your Lordship!

1430
01:55:14,186 --> 01:55:19,693
That car is being driven by
Raju Bambani since last 8 years

1431
01:55:20,092 --> 01:55:24,336
and that night also it was Raju
himself who was driving the car.

1432
01:55:25,230 --> 01:55:28,575
I have got these
mobile company records.

1433
01:55:29,535 --> 01:55:31,378
Raju's mobile was receiving

1434
01:55:31,403 --> 01:55:34,646
and sending signals in the same
area where the accident occurred

1435
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:38,283
so its pretty evident that Raju
was the one driving the car.

1436
01:55:39,078 --> 01:55:41,581
Sir sorry about having mentioned
Taare Zameen Par

1437
01:55:42,181 --> 01:55:46,561
looks like our old friend here
has a Ghajini issue.

1438
01:55:47,086 --> 01:55:49,293
Ghajini?
- Yes. Ghajini that film.

1439
01:55:49,455 --> 01:55:51,435
Short Term Memory Loss.

1440
01:55:52,624 --> 01:55:55,662
Sir whatever issues I may have
but my friend clearly seems

1441
01:55:56,161 --> 01:55:58,198
to be suffering from
a huge film hangover!

1442
01:55:59,098 --> 01:56:01,374
Sir my dear friend seems
to be forgetting that

1443
01:56:01,667 --> 01:56:03,442
Tanmay Shah's mobile was
also in the same area that night

1444
01:56:03,502 --> 01:56:04,606
and was receiving and sending signals.

1445
01:56:04,636 --> 01:56:07,742
Exactly Sir! That's my point too!!!

1446
01:56:08,507 --> 01:56:10,680
Let me explain.

1447
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:13,722
Sir, if we assume that

1448
01:56:14,346 --> 01:56:18,726
you and your driver are in some area
around midnight then isn't it obvious

1449
01:56:20,119 --> 01:56:27,765
that if he is your driver he would be
the one driving the car and not you.

1450
01:56:28,527 --> 01:56:30,507
Sir I have some more papers to show.

1451
01:56:31,497 --> 01:56:34,341
These are the blood
reports of Mr. Parikh

1452
01:56:34,433 --> 01:56:39,576
who was the third victim that night
and is still in the hospital.

1453
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:44,713
Mr. Parikh was under the
influence of alcohol.

1454
01:56:46,111 --> 01:56:47,146
What?

1455
01:56:48,147 --> 01:56:49,455
Should I say in Guajarati?

1456
01:56:49,715 --> 01:56:52,389
Your father was drunk that night.

1457
01:56:53,318 --> 01:56:54,619
Sir I have been in the hospital

1458
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:56,657
none of the reports ever claimed so.

1459
01:56:56,755 --> 01:57:01,568
Sir, Pritam Parikh has a
very colorful personality.

1460
01:57:06,131 --> 01:57:08,771
Here Sir, this is the list of songs
he sings in his orchestra.

1461
01:57:09,501 --> 01:57:11,481
Have a look, Sir!

1462
01:57:12,738 --> 01:57:16,709
The wine is now so costly,
drink a little less.

1463
01:57:17,342 --> 01:57:19,583
People say I am drunkard,

1464
01:57:19,845 --> 01:57:22,587
So rock up drinkers.

1465
01:57:22,748 --> 01:57:25,251
Sir, they are all songs on wine.

1466
01:57:25,317 --> 01:57:26,819
My Lord! How baseless
it is to decide one's

1467
01:57:27,219 --> 01:57:28,789
character just from the
basis of songs

1468
01:57:29,388 --> 01:57:30,731
It is just a performance.

1469
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:35,297
Okay Sir lets forget about this
and talk about his preferences Sir.

1470
01:57:37,262 --> 01:57:41,711
Pritam Parikh loves foreign alcohol and

1471
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:47,649
Raju used to supply alcohol to him
because Raju is a bootlegger Sir.

1472
01:57:47,673 --> 01:57:50,347
Sir there is no proof to
prove that Raju is a bootlegger.

1473
01:57:50,409 --> 01:57:51,752
There is Sir

1474
01:57:52,478 --> 01:57:58,793
This is Mr Hasmukh's testimony
who is Pritam Parikh's old friend

1475
01:57:59,251 --> 01:58:00,787
and neighbour which clearly
states Raju and Pritam Parikh,

1476
01:58:01,253 --> 01:58:04,700
both loved alcohol and Raju also was

1477
01:58:04,723 --> 01:58:07,294
under the influence
of alcohol that night.

1478
01:58:08,227 --> 01:58:10,605
How? Can you please explain?

1479
01:58:12,164 --> 01:58:14,804
Sir have your ever come across
a lanky sweet shop owner?

1480
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:16,276
What?

1481
01:58:16,668 --> 01:58:19,410
Most of these sweet shop
owners are fat because

1482
01:58:19,605 --> 01:58:20,811
while making sweets, they also
end up eating a lot of it to see that

1483
01:58:21,206 --> 01:58:22,810
its been made right or no.
Sir you become what you do Sir!

1484
01:58:23,342 --> 01:58:25,686
Hence Sir Raju was under
the influence of alcohol

1485
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:27,748
that night and ran into people.

1486
01:58:27,846 --> 01:58:30,554
The only thing we
don't have is his blood report.

1487
01:58:31,717 --> 01:58:33,754
Sir, it's all bunch of lies.

1488
01:58:34,653 --> 01:58:37,259
Sir, CCTV footage can only be
considered a solid evidence.

1489
01:58:37,389 --> 01:58:42,805
Exactly Sir! This is the only solid
evidence we have to prove that

1490
01:58:43,228 --> 01:58:49,804
Tanmay Shah sat on the right side of
the car which was a left hand drive car

1491
01:58:50,502 --> 01:58:54,814
and was being driven by Raju who was
clearly under the influence of alcohol.

1492
01:58:55,307 --> 01:58:56,479
Sir, it was nothing like that.

1493
01:58:56,508 --> 01:58:59,421
Sir, this is an open and shut case.
- Sir...

1494
01:58:59,444 --> 01:59:01,424
How can he say this, sir.
- Enough, enough. Silence!

1495
01:59:03,248 --> 01:59:05,319
Carry on with the witnesses.

1496
01:59:24,269 --> 01:59:26,078
The court is adjourned for the day.

1497
01:59:28,307 --> 01:59:31,015
Listen! Its Patil's call. Talk to him.

1498
01:59:32,210 --> 01:59:33,018
Hello.

1499
01:59:33,345 --> 01:59:34,016
Yes, Parth?

1500
01:59:34,212 --> 01:59:36,385
We need some solid proofs
tomorrow in the court.

1501
01:59:37,149 --> 01:59:40,619
Think carefully and tell me.
What actually happened that night.

1502
01:59:41,386 --> 01:59:43,798
Where were you?
What did you do?

1503
01:59:44,523 --> 01:59:46,799
Which road did you take?
What did you see?

1504
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:51,405
You need to tell me,
so please think and tell me.

1505
02:00:12,284 --> 02:00:13,661
Please start the proceedings.

1506
02:00:13,819 --> 02:00:15,765
Sir, I want to show you something.

1507
02:00:16,355 --> 02:00:19,097
Can I have the permission to show
your another CC TV footage?

1508
02:00:19,124 --> 02:00:22,627
Sir, what is going on!
ls this some kind of a video parlor?

1509
02:00:22,628 --> 02:00:24,835
Sir, this is important.
lt absolutely important, sir.

1510
02:00:25,063 --> 02:00:28,101
Okay, okay. go ahead.
- Will you please play the video?

1511
02:00:50,088 --> 02:00:51,533
I fail to understand, sir.

1512
02:00:51,657 --> 02:00:57,403
Yesterday's CCTV footage was in
the police's FIR but what about this

1513
02:00:58,030 --> 02:01:01,102
What is the defense trying to
prove by showing this?

1514
02:01:01,299 --> 02:01:04,303
Sir what I am trying to say is
that this CCTV footage is exactly

1515
02:01:04,403 --> 02:01:06,679
3 minutes before the medical
store's footage we saw yesterday.

1516
02:01:06,738 --> 02:01:07,648
So what?

1517
02:01:07,673 --> 02:01:08,583
So... So what?

1518
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:11,450
Sir... the accident took place
near the Ghodapur by pass.

1519
02:01:11,576 --> 02:01:14,420
And this footage is that of
SG Highway, petrol pump.

1520
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:16,580
Sir Raju's scooter is a 93 model and

1521
02:01:16,581 --> 02:01:18,788
its impossible to cover 7 kilometers
in 3 minutes on that model.

1522
02:01:19,317 --> 02:01:23,663
According to this, it clear that
Raju wasn't in the car that day.

1523
02:01:23,722 --> 02:01:25,463
Because he was on the scooter.

1524
02:01:25,524 --> 02:01:28,061
And sir, the report which
Mr. Mehta has submitted,

1525
02:01:28,093 --> 02:01:28,764
according to that,

1526
02:01:28,794 --> 02:01:31,570
he amount of alcohol which was
in Preetam Parikh's blood,

1527
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:34,110
it was approximately double
than the permissible limit.

1528
02:01:34,599 --> 02:01:38,604
Sir, a 62 years man who cannot
even stand straight drinking alcohol,

1529
02:01:38,637 --> 02:01:43,108
how could he reach the accident spot
at a distance of 5 km away?

1530
02:01:43,275 --> 02:01:44,652
And one more point, sir.

1531
02:01:45,444 --> 02:01:47,549
The report which he has produced
according to it

1532
02:01:47,646 --> 02:01:50,684
car has been modified from
right hand drive to left hand drive.

1533
02:01:50,782 --> 02:01:52,090
I challenge, sir.

1534
02:01:52,551 --> 02:01:55,464
I challenge the service station
number he has given, according to it

1535
02:01:56,088 --> 02:01:59,535
no engineer can make such modification
in any car, sir.

1536
02:02:00,292 --> 02:02:02,568
It's impossible.
- Your Lordship, l...

1537
02:02:02,728 --> 02:02:07,234
can understand Mr. Faith's
mental state.

1538
02:02:07,299 --> 02:02:09,108
I sympathies with him.

1539
02:02:11,436 --> 02:02:13,109
But unfortunately...

1540
02:02:14,406 --> 02:02:16,716
All his arguments are invalid, sir.

1541
02:02:16,742 --> 02:02:19,484
All the evidences are actually
against Raju Bambani.

1542
02:02:19,644 --> 02:02:21,555
Sol request this court

1543
02:02:22,514 --> 02:02:26,257
that police charge sheet should
be retained

1544
02:02:26,451 --> 02:02:30,627
and the case against Raju
should be continued.

1545
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:35,294
Mr. Mehta, for your kind information,
Charge sheet means

1546
02:02:35,594 --> 02:02:38,074
a police investigation report.

1547
02:02:38,663 --> 02:02:40,609
Even in a common theft case

1548
02:02:40,999 --> 02:02:44,344
police takes about 20 to 25 days
to file the charge sheet.

1549
02:02:44,503 --> 02:02:49,043
And here in such a serious case is
filed in just five days?

1550
02:02:49,641 --> 02:02:51,621
This shows that this charge sheet
is also fabricated.

1551
02:02:51,643 --> 02:02:54,487
Sir, this is outrageous...
- Sir, witness's statements

1552
02:02:54,513 --> 02:02:57,119
and his arguments, are all false, sir.

1553
02:02:57,249 --> 02:02:59,593
Thy have a lot of factually errors.

1554
02:02:59,618 --> 02:03:02,326
Mr. Amitabh Shah's evidence,
his papers, his

1555
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:04,400
case, are all false.

1556
02:03:04,723 --> 02:03:08,466
I object, sir.
- Sir, I have submitted all the proofs.

1557
02:03:08,527 --> 02:03:10,234
And yet...

1558
02:03:10,495 --> 02:03:12,532
If Raju has to be declared guilty...

1559
02:03:15,367 --> 02:03:17,540
I have a humble request that

1560
02:03:19,037 --> 02:03:20,414
this case should be closed.

1561
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:24,220
Sir, there is no need for
all this drama, sir.

1562
02:03:24,743 --> 02:03:28,452
Sir... It's important.

1563
02:03:28,613 --> 02:03:30,092
We should...

1564
02:03:30,615 --> 02:03:33,186
let people know that
Raju is poor..

1565
02:03:34,352 --> 02:03:36,423
Is not as powerful as Mr. Shah.

1566
02:03:36,688 --> 02:03:38,668
And as he is a driver,
so he is guilty.

1567
02:03:39,491 --> 02:03:41,630
Yet, if Raju is considered guilty"

1568
02:03:42,794 --> 02:03:44,171
Let's stop the melodrama.

1569
02:03:59,744 --> 02:04:04,386
The high court keeping in
mind both sides of the arguments

1570
02:04:05,383 --> 02:04:09,854
based on both the CCTV footage
and on solid grounds

1571
02:04:11,122 --> 02:04:16,868
decides to quash the charge sheet filed by
he Ghodapur police station against Raju.

1572
02:04:19,731 --> 02:04:21,404
Silence! Silence please.

1573
02:04:22,467 --> 02:04:25,505
And at the same time, insturcts the
Ghodapur Police

1574
02:04:26,104 --> 02:04:30,075
to re investigate this case again

1575
02:04:30,342 --> 02:04:34,051
and orders Tanmay Shah
to be presented before the court.

1576
02:04:36,314 --> 02:04:38,294
The case has been disposed off.

1577
02:04:56,234 --> 02:04:57,679
Sir I had come to you for help.

1578
02:05:00,338 --> 02:05:04,343
Had you helped me back then,
today this wouldn't have happened.

1579
02:05:22,494 --> 02:05:23,404
Move.

1580
02:05:37,375 --> 02:05:38,479
Thank you, Parth.

1581
02:05:41,613 --> 02:05:43,490
This is no reason to celebrate.

1582
02:05:44,149 --> 02:05:47,062
This case was just to quash
the charge sheet against you.

1583
02:05:48,386 --> 02:05:50,127
The main case still remains.

1584
02:05:51,723 --> 02:05:53,396
Do you know whats going to happen now?

1585
02:05:55,727 --> 02:05:58,173
The investigation will
go on for 10-15 years.

1586
02:06:00,065 --> 02:06:04,673
All the evidences against Tanmay
Shah will be declared null and void.

1587
02:06:05,637 --> 02:06:08,447
The High Court will
dismiss it as insufficient.

1588
02:06:09,808 --> 02:06:12,652
And finally...due to
lack of any concrete evidence,

1589
02:06:14,746 --> 02:06:17,522
Tanmay Shah will be acquitted.

1590
02:06:18,717 --> 02:06:24,167
And he will be celebrating
this victory somewhere.

1591
02:06:24,622 --> 02:06:26,101
This wont happen Parth Sir.

1592
02:06:26,491 --> 02:06:28,437
This is what has been going on
for years and this is what will happen.

1593
02:06:28,493 --> 02:06:29,198
Raj u.

1594
02:06:31,129 --> 02:06:32,130
No Parth Sir.

1595
02:06:33,365 --> 02:06:34,537
This time this won't happen.

1596
02:06:37,435 --> 02:06:39,073
Because its just not possible.

1597
02:06:44,209 --> 02:06:46,450
I was about to tell
you Parth Sir but...

1598
02:06:47,712 --> 02:06:49,419
but?... but what?

1599
02:06:51,716 --> 02:06:54,697
Parth Sir...please don't get angry...

1600
02:06:55,053 --> 02:06:56,327
...and please don't feel bad also...

1601
02:06:59,491 --> 02:07:03,803
That night, Tanmay sir
wasn't alone in that car.

1602
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:14,275
He came to Garba.

1603
02:07:20,445 --> 02:07:21,287
Again?

1604
02:07:22,847 --> 02:07:25,350
Sit in the car or else
I will screw his happiness.

1605
02:07:30,155 --> 02:07:32,795
As soon as I saw Shaily madam
getting into Tanmay Sir's car...

1606
02:07:33,391 --> 02:07:34,734
...l don't know what struck me...

1607
02:07:35,193 --> 02:07:37,036
I followed them...

1608
02:07:39,597 --> 02:07:42,373
Tanmay Sir started
drinking in the car itself.

1609
02:07:52,277 --> 02:07:54,621
And when Shaily madam
stopped him from doing so...

1610
02:07:55,413 --> 02:07:57,723
...they stopped the car
somewhere and exchanged seats.

1611
02:07:59,317 --> 02:08:03,424
My scooter ran out of fuel
and broke down after a point.

1612
02:08:08,126 --> 02:08:10,128
And I went to the fuel
station to fill in fuel.

1613
02:08:12,297 --> 02:08:14,402
I went to fill the gas and there...

1614
02:08:15,233 --> 02:08:16,371
Pass the bottle.

1615
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:18,205
I am not giving it to you.

1616
02:08:18,303 --> 02:08:19,543
Pass the bottle!
- No!

1617
02:08:19,671 --> 02:08:21,150
Why not?

1618
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:23,475
Watch out!

1619
02:09:44,022 --> 02:09:47,026
So that food vendor's
testimony was true.

1620
02:09:51,196 --> 02:09:54,234
From there I took the car
straight to Amitabh Shah's farmhouse.

1621
02:10:35,673 --> 02:10:37,653
Tanmay is dead!

1622
02:10:40,211 --> 02:10:42,191
Whats he saying?

1623
02:10:50,021 --> 02:10:51,056
Yes, Parth.

1624
02:11:06,104 --> 02:11:07,640
We were really scared Parth.

1625
02:11:08,139 --> 02:11:10,050
Patil sir should we call the cops?

1626
02:11:10,074 --> 02:11:11,417
No, shouldn't. Don't call the cops.

1627
02:11:11,542 --> 02:11:13,647
You and she will get screwed
badly if you call the cops...

1628
02:11:13,745 --> 02:11:15,315
listen to me please!

1629
02:11:15,346 --> 02:11:24,824
First we cremated
Tanmay sir's dead body.

1630
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:34,474
And I told Patil Sir to collect
Tanmay Sir's phone, wallet and laptop.

1631
02:11:38,002 --> 02:11:41,347
We used the laptop
and the phone against

1632
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:46,418
Amitabh Sir after he tried to frame me.

1633
02:11:47,412 --> 02:11:49,289
From his phone we came to know

1634
02:11:49,514 --> 02:11:53,326
that Tanmay had borrowed $2 million
from his own partner Mark

1635
02:11:54,519 --> 02:11:56,499
And when Patil opened the laptop,

1636
02:11:57,088 --> 02:11:59,625
we got to know of Amitabh Shah's
illegal transactions.

1637
02:12:00,224 --> 02:12:02,568
All his fake companies,
about VISAMO,

1638
02:12:02,627 --> 02:12:04,573
fake documents, fake sanctions,

1639
02:12:04,696 --> 02:12:06,698
and entire account of black money.

1640
02:12:08,766 --> 02:12:11,440
We decided to hand over
Tanmay Sir's phone and credit card

1641
02:12:12,036 --> 02:12:14,380
to our friend who was
traveling to Malaysia then.

1642
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:18,150
That made everyone believe
that Tanmay Sir is in Malaysia.

1643
02:12:20,611 --> 02:12:23,387
Tanmay's phone calls and credit
card have shown some activity.

1644
02:12:24,749 --> 02:12:26,126
Location is Malaysia.

1645
02:12:26,317 --> 02:12:28,456
And when the time was right,
I instructed Patil Sir

1646
02:12:28,519 --> 02:12:30,465
to start blackmailing Amitabh Shah
under the guise of Mark.

1647
02:12:31,089 --> 02:12:33,035
And we eventually leaked the
Visamo low housing

1648
02:12:33,157 --> 02:12:34,602
society file from his laptop.

1649
02:12:42,367 --> 02:12:46,144
We weren't greedy for money, but if
somebody called Mark was blackmailing him

1650
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:47,740
then he will certainly ask for money.

1651
02:12:48,106 --> 02:12:51,610
So, just to make all this look real and
scare Amitabh Shah we asked for money.

1652
02:12:58,082 --> 02:13:07,696
And those 15 lakhs also we managed
to raise by selling off our office.

1653
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:12,266
I have done wrong,
but it was to save myself.

1654
02:13:16,401 --> 02:13:19,507
We did all this and the rest

1655
02:13:20,371 --> 02:13:25,081
Amitabh sir himself completed and
dug his own grave.

1656
02:13:25,243 --> 02:13:28,588
He also, like everyone else,
believed that it was Tanmay's fault.

1657
02:13:28,713 --> 02:13:30,522
Dump this car. Now!

1658
02:13:30,681 --> 02:13:33,321
Because of Gohil's transfer,
Makwana freaked out...

1659
02:13:34,051 --> 02:13:36,588
Which is why he gave you
the CC TV footage.

1660
02:13:37,188 --> 02:13:41,261
Parth. I was really scared
and hence I kept quiet.

1661
02:13:41,659 --> 02:13:44,469
Had I said anything,
Shally would have been implicated.

1662
02:13:45,096 --> 02:13:49,135
It's really not Shally's fault.
I did it all to save her.

1663
02:13:50,334 --> 02:13:54,146
She wasn't willing to leave.
lt's me who insisted that she goes.

1664
02:14:01,179 --> 02:14:02,180
What is this?

1665
02:14:02,713 --> 02:14:04,283
Your fees Parth Sir.

1666
02:14:06,083 --> 02:14:07,460
But...l cant...
- Look Parth, sir.

1667
02:14:08,586 --> 02:14:10,224
I did what I felt was
right at that point of time.

1668
02:14:10,588 --> 02:14:12,158
If possible, forgive me.

1669
02:14:22,767 --> 02:14:24,110
Sometimes...

1670
02:14:25,369 --> 02:14:26,643
to do a right thing

1671
02:14:27,705 --> 02:14:30,447
one has to take the wrong side.

1672
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:55,809
It's been <i>6</i> months, but Ghodapur by pass
hit and run case's Tanmay is still not found.

1673
02:14:56,267 --> 02:15:00,215
And since last few months
even his father Amitabh is absconding.
