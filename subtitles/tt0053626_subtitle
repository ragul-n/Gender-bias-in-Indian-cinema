1
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,290
If you need it let us know.

2
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:06,824
The company has made
it for the public.

3
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:12,130
You’ll see the effects
within a week.

4
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:17,127
I've sold this to 40,000 passengers
of this train..

5
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:20,860
..in the last 3 years.

6
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:22,831
If you need it let me know.

7
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:26,726
One is for 1 2 paise
and 2 for 1 4 paise.

8
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,622
Whoever needs one please ask for it.

9
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:43,527
''ALL of us are sinners, everything
is an illusion.''

10
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:48,427
This one is for Mrs. Tarulata.
Mrs. Tarulata!

11
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:53,828
The best way to make yourself
beautiful. Mrs. Tarulata!

12
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:01,133
The makers have created
it for your use.

13
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:05,597
Not once or twice, it will work
as many times as you use it.

14
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:08,260
Whoever needs it please take it.

15
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,700
The boy's affirmative?
I’ll take care of that.

16
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:41,364
He wasn't willing to marry
All these days as I'm here.

17
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:47,801
But I won't last forever that
I can take care of him on and on!

18
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:52,661
Moreover, you know
my son earns well.

19
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:58,202
But, I think the girl is
a Little young for him.

20
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:01,131
Anyway, we don't live in the city..

21
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,138
..that she needs to be
an adult. What say?

22
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:08,466
I agree. In any case the difference
in age is not so much.

23
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:10,799
It's quite common in villages to
have an age difference like this.

24
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,867
Actually, I prefer a young
daughter-in-law.

25
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,332
Oh yes!

26
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,770
We've to mould the girl to
our standards, you see.

27
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,333
Don't you worry about that, missus!

28
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,599
She is putty in your hands.

29
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:26,466
You can mould her anyway you want.

30
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:01,606
Mum, I'm leaving.
- Are you leaving?

31
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:06,333
Start preparations.

32
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:09,268
Whom should I approach?
- The matchmaker.

33
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,507
Just get rid of him.

34
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,205
I won't be the crutch
for some imbecile!

35
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,147
The daughter-in-law is
quite good looking.

36
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,511
You know, mum. I feel
very lonely at times.

37
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:37,648
I work so hard each day.
My days are spent only working.

38
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:41,581
Why? What for?

39
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:46,148
Why do you speak so? God
has granted us life.

40
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:51,184
You've to live it up. You
can't lose hope, dear.

41
00:06:56,253 --> 00:07:00,186
Mum, do this.

42
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,150
Send for the matchmaker.

43
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:05,779
Who?

44
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:12,581
Mr. Bhattacharya. I believe
he is a matchmaker.

45
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:22,219
''Let me see the bride,
I might have to run away.''

46
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:27,409
''Let me see the bride,
I might have to run away.''

47
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:33,748
''Let me see the bride,
I might have to run away.''

48
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:38,345
''Let me see the bride,
I might have to run away.''

49
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:42,851
''Let me see the bride,
I might have to run away.''

50
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:48,150
''We will meet on the sly
without uttering a word.''

51
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:53,221
''We will meet on the sly
without uttering a word.''

52
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:57,752
''We will meet on the sly
without uttering a word.''

53
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:02,381
''We will meet on the sly
without uttering a word.''

54
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,615
''We will meet on the sly
without uttering a word.''

55
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:28,819
Hey, you took such a brave
step and hid it from us?

56
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:30,556
You're too much!

57
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:33,523
It's only 4 paise tram
fare from Howrah.

58
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:35,214
Surely, you could’ve informed us.

59
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,349
You see, it happened
All of a sudden.

60
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,289
Very well, you didn't inform us.

61
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:43,490
You got married quite late,
a late marriage!

62
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:50,259
Don't stick to
your wife at all times!

63
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,259
What? Will you stick
to her All the times?

64
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:56,515
Tell me. - Say it, mister.

65
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:57,889
Tell us, tell us!

66
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,153
No, I mean..

67
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:09,485
You must Leave by 3 o’clock,
Go, go, go!

68
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:11,760
Don't be late! Go! - Bye!

69
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:15,787
Mr. Priyanath! Listen!
- Yes?

70
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:19,657
Give the wifey a hug, on
my behalf! A present.

71
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,160
Where are you? Where?

72
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,222
Where is everybody?

73
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:50,893
No one at home, it seems.

74
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,756
Mum, mum!

75
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:58,759
Mum!

76
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,265
Coming!

77
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,893
You're back early today.

78
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:05,424
I don't feel too well.

79
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,829
Why? What happened?

80
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,162
No, it's okay. Where were you?

81
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:14,497
There was some music in the
village, I went to listen.

82
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:17,159
You left the house vacant
in the evening!

83
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:20,596
Don't you've any sense of..

84
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:22,529
Isn't daughter-in-law in?

85
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:24,792
Daughter-in-law, indeed!

86
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,561
Daughter-in-law! Daughter-in-law!

87
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:33,863
Look at that! She is out at
someone's house at this time!

88
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,669
There was a time when everything
was in place.

89
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:25,830
Inhabitants, their retainers,
pride of place in the village!

90
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,904
The entire village
was in awe of them.

91
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,703
They had tigers roaming
their estate.

92
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:44,200
And wealth? It was not wealth
but an open house.

93
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:52,166
I hear my grandmother had
arranged her pet cat's..

94
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:54,574
..marriage and spent
Rs. 20,000 on it.

95
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:00,175
And one of my ancestors,
during the Durga Puja..

96
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:03,540
..festival had wanted
to turn night to day.

97
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:06,176
He Lit up thousands of lamps
and hoisted a canopy made..

98
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,574
..of real silver to turn
darkness to light.

99
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:14,242
Today.. it's All over.

100
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:18,540
It has vanished like camphor fumes.

101
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,541
It's bound to happen. You've
to pay for your deeds.

102
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:30,239
They also treated people
badly you see.

103
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,176
So many innocent people vanished
for the sake of..

104
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:40,679
..the landowner’s whims.
They cared so little.

105
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,578
Many unsuspecting people
were buried alive.

106
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,173
People were tortured endlessly
to satisfy the..

107
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:52,304
..quirks of the landowners.

108
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,643
The Almighty couldn’t
stand it any longer.

109
00:14:57,781 --> 00:15:03,577
So much ill-treatment, people’s
woes, their curses.

110
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:08,904
Grandpa's courtyard that you
saw earlier, at one time..

111
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:11,170
..it used to be choc-a-block
with visitors.

112
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:15,180
And the visitor's hall? I believe
one of the British officers..

113
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,238
..had come to a banquet there.

114
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,704
And now? It feels like a haunted
place when you go there.

115
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:32,440
Have you fallen asleep?

116
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:58,708
Hey, are you listening? Hey!

117
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,781
Sleep properly.

118
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:27,179
'Now available! Special
color for ladies' feet!'

119
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:32,786
'Kalakara products' best
cosmetic for ladies!'

120
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:34,754
'If you want one please ask for it!'

121
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:39,213
'All of you, who have female
family members, do buy this.'

122
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,915
'And see them smile!'

123
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,656
'Please ask for one.'

124
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:30,649
Who's there? Thief!

125
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:36,450
'Srimati Alta! The color
that adorns ladies' feet!

126
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:37,857
The one and only Srimati Alta!

127
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:44,387
Suppose one of you wake up
in the middle of the night.

128
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:49,256
And you see your wife sleeping
soundly, without a fear.

129
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:52,258
And then you'll see
her adorned feet!

130
00:18:52,460 --> 00:19:00,258
Won't you go absolutely wild
seeing her adorned feet!

131
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,551
Won't you feel so excited?!

132
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:08,186
If you really want to win your
wife over, if you really want..

133
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:14,855
..to enthrall her. If you want
to see her mesmerized.

134
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,258
If you want to see her
absolutely thrilled..

135
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:19,592
Hey, stop it! You're going
on and on, what is this?!

136
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:25,388
Move, move!

137
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,395
Hey you, you seem to have bought
off the entire market!

138
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,191
Something like that!

139
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,190
Earlier I couldn’t make him do
a thing even if I told him..

140
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:39,662
..repeatedly. And now
it's like magic.

141
00:19:40,198 --> 00:19:42,924
He hesitated a lot but finally
came out with it yesterday.

142
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:46,624
He said, ''Mum, let's change
the covering on the roof.''

143
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:49,925
I said very well. Inform Balram.

144
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:53,196
Yes. He didn't find me home.
He told my daughter, Tepi..

145
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:57,595
..to send me here when
I returned from the market.

146
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:58,924
He said you had sent for me.

147
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,690
As if! It was his wife.

148
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:06,358
Now it is his wife, who
gets everything done.

149
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,589
Does he listen
to whatever she says?

150
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:14,197
Listen to her? He is
at her beck and call.

151
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:19,190
I teach her everything.
Say this, ask for that.

152
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,196
Yes. I heard about your
daughter-in-law..

153
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,562
..from my daughter.

154
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:28,189
She says she is a gem,
hard to find one like her.

155
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:32,698
She is right, Balram. My
daughter-in-law is a gem.

156
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,456
She has brought light
into our lives.

157
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,198
Now that his roof has been
done, why don't you..

158
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,358
..repair your roof too?

159
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:42,692
Oh no, how can he manage repairing
both at the same time.

160
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,892
Expenses are high you know.
I’ll manage this year.

161
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:48,791
We’ll see next year.

162
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,190
You're home early?

163
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,665
It's the end of the month.
Sales weren't good.

164
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,401
I got this.
- What is it?

165
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:04,458
Guess!

166
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:06,364
Looks like a rose sapling.

167
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:08,800
Yes, it's a rose plant.
- Oh.

168
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:16,761
Have you eaten?

169
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:18,896
No, daughter-in-law hasn't eaten.
- What?

170
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:27,398
Brother, let me have a
look at the rose plant.

171
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,270
Wow. Looks good. Where
did you get it from?

172
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:44,734
From Kolkata. Jog Nursery.
- What?

173
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,499
It's a famous nursery at Kolkata.
It cost Rs. 2.

174
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:52,932
You purchased it? From Kolkata?!
For Rs. 2?!

175
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:58,227
You actually bought it for Rs. 2?
- Yes.

176
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:01,361
This is not a local plant,
you see, not a local plant.

177
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:04,401
It's imported. A special quality.

178
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:10,461
You’ll see when it blooms,
the flower will be so big.

179
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:14,596
So fragrant! The entire
house will be aromatic.

180
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:17,235
You bought it. Good.

181
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:25,195
Your daughter-in-law likes it
a lot you see. So I bought it.

182
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,264
Die, die! May you perish! You find
only my tree to steal mangoes!

183
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:35,570
Hey you, thief! Thief!

184
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:40,198
The old lady is mad,
the old lady is mad!

185
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:41,433
Catch her, catch her!

186
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:45,371
Catch her! Oh dear, my back!

187
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:50,195
You useless girls! If it wasn't
for my back I would’ve..

188
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:54,708
..beaten up All of you.

189
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,401
You won't be able to
digest those mangoes.

190
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,532
You won't be able to digest it.
You’ll die, you’ll perish!

191
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:05,535
The arm that stole the
mangoes, will rot.

192
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:08,769
It will become lifeless. Send out
invitations, don't mutter here.

193
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:10,501
Senseless, All are senseless!

194
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:11,633
You can't go on like this!

195
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:15,540
How can she do this? You've
encouraged her.

196
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,765
How dare you enter my garden!

197
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,638
When she will come to
fight you’ll know.

198
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,198
If you had your own
garden you'd know!

199
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,936
So will you take on like this?

200
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:27,802
The arm that stole the mangoes
will rot, it’ll perish.

201
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:30,933
Oh Goddess Chandi, you
know everything.

202
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,340
What is the matter?
Why All the shouting?

203
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:38,203
Sister, see how bad they are.

204
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:41,244
They come and pick on my
mangoes All the time!

205
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,300
So what? Aren't you ashamed
of cursing them like this!

206
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:46,409
What? Should I baulk
at saying this?

207
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:50,303
Why? Whom should I fear?
Who has reared me here?

208
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:53,867
I’ll say it, say it as
many times as I want.

209
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:55,205
A hundred times over!

210
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,211
You’ll rot, you’ll rot to the end!

211
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,211
What? You’ll rot! Don't say a word!

212
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,211
You're just like them. You look
at me and say what you want.

213
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,212
Mum! Mum, whom are you
arguing with? Come!

214
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,640
If you want to eat mangoes,
plant your own trees.

215
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:13,708
What is the matter with you?
Why do you take her on?

216
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,211
Don't you know what sort
of a person she is!

217
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,939
Come, come on!

218
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:18,873
I told you not to talk to her.

219
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:26,705
I’ll rot indeed. May you
rot! Die, go to hell!

220
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:32,576
'So much courage,
so much fortitude.'

221
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:37,646
'Thousands of people
follow Sita's path.'

222
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:42,771
'They struggle endlessly till
their bodies can take no more.'

223
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:47,837
'In the middle of the jungle
Sita lives on valiantly.'

224
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:52,940
'This is the best day of my life.'

225
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:58,370
'You, my beloved, have
come to my door.'

226
00:24:58,816 --> 00:24:59,873
Read this.

227
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:09,909
'For 1 4 years she suffered
in the forest.'

228
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,948
'Yet you carried on with
a smile on your face.'

229
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,677
I too will write.

230
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:45,788
You can't watch. Please move away.

231
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,312
Here again? Please go.
Please go away.

232
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:11,387
Please go out.
- No.

233
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:14,514
No, I.. - No, please go out. Wait!
- No, please go away. Let go!

234
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,826
You simply don't keep your word.

235
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,953
Why. What happened?

236
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,217
You said, you had seen a picture
of Lord Krishna at..

237
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:58,524
..Kolkata. You didn't
bring it for me.

238
00:28:58,596 --> 00:28:59,652
I’ll get it today for sure.

239
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:01,889
As if! You don't have to bring it.

240
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:04,761
Everyday you ask for
different things.

241
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:07,793
Where on earth will
you keep All this?

242
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,657
As if one picture will occupy
the entire house.

243
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:15,760
Daughter-in-law, please get
the dry clothes inside.

244
00:29:21,697 --> 00:29:26,220
Oh goodness! It's quite late!

245
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:48,290
It's quite late.
- Serves you right.

246
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:51,455
You’ll learn your lesson when
your bosses scold you.

247
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,296
You've started before the bosses!

248
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,421
Bye!
- See you!

249
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:11,297
Son, are you leaving?
- Yes, mum.

250
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,291
What is it?

251
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:16,595
I had to tell you something.
- What is it?

252
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:19,958
Let's go that side.

253
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:29,591
What is it? Tell me.

254
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,896
Balram was saying.
- What was he saying?

255
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:35,928
About my roof.
- What happened to the roof?

256
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,326
Last time it wasn't repaired.

257
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:41,692
Once it begins raining
it won't be possible.

258
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:42,926
Yes, so what?

259
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:46,225
How about sending for Balram?

260
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:49,591
Send for him, let's
see if he can fix it.

261
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:52,263
There's still time
for the rains, mum.

262
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:58,359
Not now, when you can do it, do it.
- Okay.

263
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:00,560
Bye!

264
00:31:23,537 --> 00:31:26,594
Who's there? Oh it's you.

265
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:29,430
It's okay.

266
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:32,531
When did you come?
- Just now.

267
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,370
When did you arrive here?

268
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:35,898
Day before yesterday.

269
00:31:36,238 --> 00:31:39,795
Sit. Daughter-in-law!
Give Tepi a seat.

270
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,272
I brought this from the
Chaudhary's garden.

271
00:31:58,274 --> 00:32:01,296
Tepi, you’ll stay for
a few days, won't you?

272
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:02,896
I've to stay for a few days.

273
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,802
At least for 5 months.

274
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:13,599
Go, move away! Go, go, go!

275
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:27,504
Tepi, tell your father. We had
discussed about repairing my roof.

276
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:32,932
There is no need for it now.
I’LL manage with what I have.

277
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:35,400
Do tell him, okay?
- Okay.

278
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:38,240
Ask your father to come.

279
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:41,934
Why, mum? Why not get the
roof repaired? Don't delay.

280
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:44,298
No daughter-in-law,
don't say like this.

281
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:48,770
You can't get everything
you want nowadays.

282
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:53,430
Sooner or later, you've
to start a family.

283
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:56,674
We must spend money judiciously.

284
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:00,309
You said that yourself.

285
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,242
Yes, daughter-in-law, I hear the
fair in the village is going..

286
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,902
..to be grand.

287
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:14,500
Why don't the two of you visit
there today? Go visit.

288
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:22,671
Daughter-in-law, take pleasure
in everything that is here.

289
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,973
Do all this before I go.

290
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,503
This way, this way!

291
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:27,856
Come. Careful!

292
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:37,360
Careful, there's water
here. It's a well.

293
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:44,653
My goodness!

294
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,286
It's nothing, it's just a fox.

295
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,821
Did you see how big this tree is?

296
00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:11,430
It's been uprooted entirely! Come.

297
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:16,490
Careful, careful, hold my hand.

298
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:20,588
Careful, there is a pit here.

299
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,891
This unexpected storm seems
to have destroyed everything.

300
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:39,528
What happened? Did you get
a thorn in your feet?

301
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:41,990
Yes.

302
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:50,590
Come.

303
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,333
It's quite late. Mother
must be worried.

304
00:40:06,302 --> 00:40:07,768
What happened to the mango
tree behind mother's room?

305
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:11,958
Did it fall?

306
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:14,425
Pachall, come soon!

307
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,734
Mum, mum!

308
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:06,964
Mum!

309
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:57,979
'There were sounds in the mansion.'

310
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,711
'Thunder and lightning
struck in the sky.'

311
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:04,770
'He said, now come to my land.'

312
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:13,607
'Just like a Brahmin keeps his
word, Laxman too followed Ram.'

313
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:18,271
'He said, don't worry about
what will happen to your..

314
00:44:18,348 --> 00:44:21,372
..good kingdom, oh Lord let
us take the right path.'

315
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:25,275
'As long as you've the
good qualities of Ram.'

316
00:44:25,684 --> 00:44:29,308
'It is equal to going
on pilgrimage.'

317
00:44:29,582 --> 00:44:33,275
'I go to the land
of Ram and Laxman.'

318
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:37,280
'I've nothing to worry, oh Lord.'

319
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,782
'This is what the king uttered.'

320
00:44:41,283 --> 00:44:44,614
'This is what Ram said to Laxman.'

321
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:48,284
'Ram said if this is what
you say, then I’ll obey..

322
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:51,908
..my mother's orders.'

323
00:44:52,518 --> 00:44:55,848
I’ll now go to Mithila without
a thought or worry.'

324
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:35,547
Listen! Here!

325
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,777
Listen.

326
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:58,556
I had made up my mind for Tepi.

327
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,855
I had decided if she gets a girl,
I’LL call her 'Golapi'.

328
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:05,314
Tepi too liked the name a lot.

329
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,849
It's your favorite name and
you gave it to someone else.

330
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:15,382
Then?
- Then what?

331
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:17,982
No!

332
00:47:25,925 --> 00:47:29,289
It seems, Tepi's husband has
set up home with someone..

333
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,520
..else in the city. He
has taken to vices too.

334
00:47:35,694 --> 00:47:37,284
Tepi was telling me the other
day, that he probably..

335
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,417
.. won't take her home.

336
00:47:41,794 --> 00:47:43,317
She was crying a lot.

337
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:49,292
Balram is very unfortunate.
Looks like he’ll have to bring..

338
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:51,418
..up his daughter
and grand daughter.

339
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,982
Some more rice for you?
- No.

340
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:02,658
How about taking Balram in?

341
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:05,818
He can stay in the rooms
over there in the south.

342
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:09,022
At least he’ll be free from taxes.

343
00:48:10,295 --> 00:48:11,818
And you’ll get company!

344
00:48:12,296 --> 00:48:17,592
That's wonderful! You know,
I find it so difficult.

345
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:21,591
You Leave for work. The house
is so empty it bothers me.

346
00:48:22,563 --> 00:48:26,290
Seems like a haunted house.
An unlucky house.

347
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:36,395
My mother used to say the
same thing before you came.

348
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:44,728
Very well then, I’ll tell him.

349
00:48:47,298 --> 00:48:50,889
Why think of a new room,
give them mum's rooms.

350
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:53,291
They will stay there.

351
00:49:03,598 --> 00:49:05,689
I couldn’t do anything
till mother was alive..

352
00:49:05,765 --> 00:49:07,697
..and now I am giving
away her room.

353
00:49:11,565 --> 00:49:14,293
Let it be that way.

354
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,960
Come fast.

355
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:52,358
Move away.

356
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,494
Nobody's mother lives forever.

357
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:05,793
I agree she had an
unfortunate death.

358
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:07,967
But what kind of behavior is this!

359
00:50:08,703 --> 00:50:11,363
I've been observing your heart
is not in your work.

360
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:13,299
Do you know what business
you've given us..

361
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:15,891
..these past few months?
It's dismal! Very bad!

362
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:19,993
You know, this is business.
There is no dearth of workers.

363
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:22,369
A lot of youngsters are joining
this line of work.

364
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:25,294
You're an old employee.
I don't want to fire you.

365
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:27,029
But there is a limit to everything!

366
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:29,299
Go, go and work!

367
00:50:39,705 --> 00:50:40,829
You know what the fact is, manager?

368
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,370
He is mesmerized with
his wife, he is crazy!

369
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:44,961
His mother is no more.

370
00:50:45,371 --> 00:50:48,428
He doesn't feel like leaving
his wife alone. Really!

371
00:50:54,671 --> 00:51:00,002
I can't manage anymore.
I can feel my age now.

372
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:04,595
ALL this running around, jumping
and boarding trains.

373
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:07,771
How can one manage All
that at my age?!

374
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:16,500
I left everything else to
join this field of work.

375
00:51:19,306 --> 00:51:21,034
If I Leave, I don't know
what will happen.

376
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,776
Move, out of the way.

377
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:21,808
''O friend, oh companion of mine!''

378
00:54:27,317 --> 00:54:35,011
''What did I get after All?''

379
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:52,043
''O friend, listen O friend of mine!''

380
00:54:59,552 --> 00:55:02,314
Daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law!

381
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:06,476
Come out, quick!

382
00:55:07,886 --> 00:55:08,942
What is it?

383
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:10,816
Brother fell off the train.
- What?

384
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:14,044
He is in the railway hospital.
He is quite serious.

385
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,376
Daughter-in-law!

386
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:10,617
Pari! Where are you?
- Coming.

387
00:57:19,494 --> 00:57:20,550
What is it?

388
00:57:20,794 --> 00:57:22,783
Just see if there is sunshine
on the verandah.

389
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:24,325
Oh, I’ll adjust your position.

390
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:31,717
Let's see.

391
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,620
Come.

392
00:58:33,464 --> 00:58:34,987
What is it?
- Nothing.

393
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:41,422
Just move these.

394
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:17,863
Time doesn't want to pass.
Seems like ages.

395
00:59:19,801 --> 00:59:21,324
I can't take it anymore.

396
00:59:21,701 --> 00:59:23,394
Balram had been to the hospital.

397
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:25,627
You've to go there once again.

398
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:28,594
The doctor says you can walk now.

399
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:34,691
I’ll be back, okay?

400
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:42,392
Hey, cranky girl!
Why are you crying?

401
00:59:42,669 --> 00:59:45,726
You're hurting are you?
Yes, I think so.

402
00:59:45,968 --> 00:59:47,332
She cries too much.

403
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:49,062
I see. As if you never cried.

404
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:55,928
Come to me, dearie. No need
to cry, come to me.

405
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:58,968
You're a big girl now.
You shouldn’t cry.

406
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,664
No dearie, don't cry. No crying.

407
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:05,703
Good girl, no crying, no crying.

408
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:10,896
No crying, good girl.
No more crying.

409
01:00:12,071 --> 01:00:20,470
No crying. No crying, let's
see who beat you. No crying.

410
01:00:20,671 --> 01:00:24,364
Look at that. Do you see that pool?

411
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:27,995
No crying. No crying at All.

412
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:30,468
No. No crying at all.

413
01:00:30,537 --> 01:00:33,799
He said that he was..

414
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:34,929
Bijoy.

415
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:38,868
Then I told him.. -Is it the
physician? O physician!

416
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,666
Then what happened?

417
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:25,736
Then, I thought it is a thief.
I got up with a start.

418
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,340
I get up and see..

419
01:01:27,408 --> 01:01:28,601
It's not a thief!

420
01:01:33,475 --> 01:01:34,964
Oh dear!

421
01:01:57,477 --> 01:02:00,738
Why did you come away?
Why didn't you call me?

422
01:02:05,477 --> 01:02:09,342
Whom should I call? Who was there?

423
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,740
You need to attend to
the patient at home.

424
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:24,802
Never mind.

425
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:47,609
It seems fine. But
do change the tire.

426
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,070
It hasn't been used for long.

427
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:55,604
It has given good service though.

428
01:02:56,746 --> 01:02:57,804
So many years..

429
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:07,404
Oh..

430
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:13,804
It's fine.

431
01:04:11,418 --> 01:04:12,474
Sit.

432
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:29,607
Everything is going. One by one,
I see everything going.

433
01:04:31,818 --> 01:04:36,012
Mother went. I'm crippled now.

434
01:04:37,952 --> 01:04:42,817
The little jewellery
we had has gone too.

435
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:56,351
I had thought, I'd keep
memories of those days..

436
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:58,885
..close to me. It was not to be.

437
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:10,349
Don't you see, how the days
are slipping by in front of..

438
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:13,080
..our very eyes.

439
01:05:15,755 --> 01:05:22,950
I feel like ending my life. But no.

440
01:05:23,554 --> 01:05:25,885
They won't let us live, it seems.

441
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,087
There is no oil, no
sugar in the market.

442
01:05:28,554 --> 01:05:30,680
Cloth too has gone missing.

443
01:05:31,355 --> 01:05:33,082
The price of rice is going up fast.

444
01:05:34,689 --> 01:05:37,883
Looks like there is
a famine in the land.

445
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:47,478
Here, keep this money.
See how far it lasts.

446
01:05:48,822 --> 01:05:51,618
Your company had said they'd
give you some more money.

447
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,752
Please write to them at Kolkata.
See what the bosses say.

448
01:05:57,023 --> 01:05:58,818
I’LL write if you say so.

449
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,016
But I don't think they’ll
give anything.

450
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:06,753
They're businessmen. They
are done with me.

451
01:06:06,957 --> 01:06:08,355
They don't need me any more.

452
01:06:14,624 --> 01:06:20,420
Tepi, pick up this child.
See where she is now.

453
01:06:29,426 --> 01:06:32,414
I wrote to them to give
me some writing work.

454
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:35,481
Writing accounts or something.

455
01:06:38,092 --> 01:06:40,423
Written work at the office.

456
01:06:41,025 --> 01:06:42,820
They ask me whom they should remove.

457
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:44,949
They can't create a job for me.

458
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,349
How about visiting uncle
one of these days?

459
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:50,888
Uncle?
- My maternal uncle!

460
01:06:51,494 --> 01:06:53,959
I hear uncle’s rice business
is doing very well now.

461
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,818
You are really nave.

462
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,954
You don't recognize people
for what they are.

463
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:01,959
Not All five fingers on
a hand are same you know.

464
01:07:16,962 --> 01:07:18,951
Three of these have
passed since morning.

465
01:07:19,028 --> 01:07:20,687
He just told me.
- What?

466
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:24,418
A military post will be
set up in this village.

467
01:07:24,495 --> 01:07:27,552
Military post? Why? Is there
going to be a war?

468
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:29,424
No, not a war.

469
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:33,553
Military matters. They might've
to run around later.

470
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:36,356
Probably, they're setting up
a post in preparation. - Oh.

471
01:07:36,896 --> 01:07:39,089
Why not try there for a job?

472
01:07:48,496 --> 01:07:55,021
Work? For me? A cripple?

473
01:08:15,765 --> 01:08:23,824
No. I’ll go. I’ll go to Kolkata.
I’ll go with this crippled leg.

474
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:28,428
I’ll take on Kolkata city.
I’ll take it on with this broken leg.

475
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:35,031
It's okay. Whatever I've done.

476
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:37,629
I've taken on a responsibility.

477
01:08:38,565 --> 01:08:42,089
Should I perish showily like
this, without food?

478
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:29,425
Go, go now.

479
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:32,367
No. I've been waiting in
the queue for so long.

480
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:34,902
Go on, move! What happened?

481
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,664
What's there to happen!
- I say what's up?

482
01:09:36,736 --> 01:09:39,861
What happened?
- They've shut the shop!

483
01:09:39,936 --> 01:09:40,992
What are you saying!

484
01:09:42,771 --> 01:09:45,736
We've been standing in the queue
for so long! Open up! Open up!

485
01:09:45,803 --> 01:09:47,360
We've been waiting so long!

486
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:49,902
Open the door!
- You've to open the door!

487
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:53,027
Open the door!
- Open the door!

488
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,961
What's going on here? What
happened? We've been waiting.

489
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:56,696
We've been waiting since morning.

490
01:09:56,771 --> 01:09:59,362
Give us rice.
- Rice! There is no rice. It's over.

491
01:09:59,437 --> 01:10:01,562
It's over? How can you say
it's over? It's over?

492
01:10:01,637 --> 01:10:03,433
Yes, it's over.

493
01:10:03,505 --> 01:10:05,437
Come tomorrow, we’ll see.
Come tomorrow, we’ll see indeed!

494
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:07,368
What will we eat today?

495
01:10:07,505 --> 01:10:10,437
Why do you ask me? Instead,
ask the government.

496
01:10:10,505 --> 01:10:13,960
Why should we ask the government?
You have finished the rice.

497
01:10:14,037 --> 01:10:15,095
You've to give us.

498
01:10:15,371 --> 01:10:16,962
If there is no rice, should
I manufacture it now!

499
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:19,368
Manufacture it?! Last night,
you sent Madhu Ghoshal..

500
01:10:19,438 --> 01:10:22,564
..3 bags of rice. Where
did that come from?

501
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:23,763
Yes, where did that come from?

502
01:10:23,838 --> 01:10:25,361
All those sacks of rice
that come in the night.

503
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:26,496
Where do they come from..

504
01:10:26,572 --> 01:10:27,697
.. and where do they go?

505
01:10:27,773 --> 01:10:30,432
He is giving it to the military!
To the military!

506
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:31,562
Are you beginning a riot here?

507
01:10:31,638 --> 01:10:33,969
If you go on like this, I’ll
hand you over to the police.

508
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:36,038
Don't you think there
is Law of the land?

509
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:39,369
Law of the land?

510
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:44,372
To starve your countrymen
slowly to death.

511
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:46,371
What sort of Law is that?

512
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,363
The child is crying so much!

513
01:10:54,574 --> 01:10:55,631
Hey Tepi!

514
01:10:59,441 --> 01:11:00,702
Trailing her around!

515
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,033
Better off than me!

516
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:11,631
What's the matter with
you these days?

517
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:13,571
Nothing. It's you, you folk!

518
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:14,969
Why? What's wrong with me?

519
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:16,564
I can't give you so
many explanations!

520
01:11:16,642 --> 01:11:18,971
'I can't give you so
many explanations!'

521
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,846
You finished eating so soon?

522
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:03,509
Well off people have grown
up eating good food.

523
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:05,781
One is used to facing
ups and downs in life.

524
01:14:05,852 --> 01:14:07,512
One gets used to even starving.

525
01:14:08,118 --> 01:14:09,516
I'm not talking about that.

526
01:14:10,451 --> 01:14:15,385
What I mean is, I think he is
becoming rather strange..

527
01:14:15,453 --> 01:14:16,919
..day by day.

528
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:20,711
He wasn't like this before.

529
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:27,785
He was so attentive toward me.

530
01:14:29,787 --> 01:14:30,911
He used to be so concerned.

531
01:14:32,853 --> 01:14:37,444
And now, he has become so selfish.

532
01:14:38,053 --> 01:14:41,507
Times are so bad. Moreover,
he has no job.

533
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,113
To add to his woes we
too are living here.

534
01:14:44,787 --> 01:14:47,515
All this together has
made him like this.

535
01:14:48,722 --> 01:14:49,845
But should you..

536
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,114
Look, Tepi, you know everything.

537
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:53,785
Don't try to console me.

538
01:14:54,054 --> 01:14:59,510
Aren't others suffering? Have they
All become like that? Inhuman?

539
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:09,450
He has changed. You know,
he has changed.

540
01:15:09,855 --> 01:15:12,719
Shame on you! You can't break
down at a time like this.

541
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:15,782
I won't break down so easily,
I'm not one of those.

542
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:21,383
I didn't break down..

543
01:15:21,455 --> 01:15:26,980
..when I
saw him for the first time.

544
01:15:34,456 --> 01:15:37,048
Sounds bad, doesn't it?

545
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,389
The daughter-in-law of the house.

546
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:40,650
She shouldn’t speak like this.

547
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:48,913
You know, I had overlooked
everything.

548
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:51,385
I had overlooked All shortcomings
due to his..

549
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:52,650
..good behavior.

550
01:15:53,524 --> 01:15:55,514
I could’ve continued Like that.

551
01:15:56,524 --> 01:15:58,047
He didn't let me.

552
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:02,122
Do you think I Like?
to think Like this?

553
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,782
But, you tell me, you tell me!

554
01:16:04,858 --> 01:16:06,847
What did I get from my husband?

555
01:16:06,925 --> 01:16:09,858
What did I get in
my husband's house?

556
01:16:10,592 --> 01:16:12,455
Haven't you ever thought of me?

557
01:16:12,926 --> 01:16:16,653
Can't you see it with your
own eyes? Are you blind?

558
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:45,394
They've been supplying everyone
with free food..

559
01:17:45,465 --> 01:17:46,986
..and clothes in the city.

560
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,659
I think I’ll lock my
home and go there.

561
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:56,791
Go. Turn this village
into a graveyard.

562
01:17:59,465 --> 01:18:04,796
Go away, everyone. Each one
can think only of himself.

563
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:08,393
Aah!

564
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:09,522
What's this?

565
01:18:09,665 --> 01:18:12,654
All the time, this
walling at my ear!

566
01:18:12,732 --> 01:18:13,858
Give her to her mother!

567
01:18:14,599 --> 01:18:16,121
Why are you reacting like this?

568
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,391
Talk sweetly indeed! Haven't
had a thing to eat since..

569
01:18:21,466 --> 01:18:24,864
..morning and you want
me to talk sweetly!

570
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:27,524
See, so much expectation is no good.

571
01:18:28,733 --> 01:18:31,393
Here I'm dying of hunger and
you want everything to go..

572
01:18:31,467 --> 01:18:33,057
..on as usual, All hunky dory!

573
01:18:33,133 --> 01:18:36,793
You chose a good time to help
out. Go, go take her there!

574
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:39,860
No, I won't!

575
01:18:51,668 --> 01:18:55,998
What? Tepi! Hey Tepi!

576
01:18:58,868 --> 01:19:00,128
Go take your daughter!

577
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:06,396
If she doesn't come, force her to.

578
01:19:07,803 --> 01:19:10,859
She won't give, really..

579
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:15,000
This is my home. Remember everyone,
this is my house!

580
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:23,926
This is my house. No one
dare speak too much here!

581
01:19:31,537 --> 01:19:36,402
We can't feed ourselves and
here we're caring for others!

582
01:19:37,004 --> 01:19:44,869
Damn it! Give her, give him.

583
01:19:45,738 --> 01:19:47,795
Give the child’s mother,
give the child’s grandpa!

584
01:19:48,672 --> 01:19:51,933
I know how much you
care for everyone!

585
01:19:52,804 --> 01:19:56,067
You heard me, right!
No feeding strangers.

586
01:19:56,138 --> 01:19:58,468
You can't feed strangers,
not for a day even!

587
01:20:02,471 --> 01:20:04,938
What does your uncle say now?

588
01:20:05,071 --> 01:20:07,402
Your uncle, your wealthy uncle!

589
01:20:07,473 --> 01:20:08,733
The hoarder-of-rice uncle!

590
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,997
Has your father even bothered
to find out about you!

591
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:13,128
Whether you're dead or alive!

592
01:20:15,072 --> 01:20:18,403
I understand everything.
I know everything.

593
01:20:18,673 --> 01:20:21,731
Each one is thinking only of himself.
I'm the only fool fretting here.

594
01:20:25,473 --> 01:20:30,872
I tell you once and for all.
I can't feed strangers any more!

595
01:20:31,474 --> 01:20:32,997
If anyone gets hurt, so be it!

596
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:35,062
They can leave if they want to.
Let them go where they want!

597
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:36,930
Go to hell!

598
01:21:05,809 --> 01:21:12,471
Mum, mum. You escaped. You
died and found freedom.

599
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,605
You wouldn’t have been
able to bear it.

600
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:19,403
You couldn’t have borne it,
if you saw what has happened..

601
01:21:19,476 --> 01:21:21,875
..to your home and hearth.

602
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:36,671
At a time like this, the Almighty
too turns his face away.

603
01:21:41,678 --> 01:21:44,008
Were He here I'd have shown Him.

604
01:21:46,011 --> 01:21:52,536
I'd also see, I'd fight till the
finish and see if I can live or not.

605
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:36,742
Quiet. We're leaving.

606
01:22:39,815 --> 01:22:44,009
Fine. Go, All of you leave!

607
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:55,141
Brother Priyanath, we're leaving.

608
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:59,878
We're leaving.

609
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:43,015
They've left!

610
01:26:17,493 --> 01:26:22,620
Listen, I've come.

611
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:27,959
Priyanath here.

612
01:26:38,161 --> 01:26:39,627
Are you asleep?

613
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,552
What happened?

614
01:26:47,496 --> 01:26:50,825
Listen, I'm Priyanath.

615
01:27:05,496 --> 01:27:08,621
Listen! Open the door!

616
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:11,620
Listen!

617
01:27:14,497 --> 01:27:15,724
Open the door!

618
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,428
Open the door!

619
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:24,555
Open the door! Open the door!

620
01:27:34,698 --> 01:27:36,960
Open the door! Open the door!

621
01:27:41,565 --> 01:27:44,690
Open the door! Open the door!

622
01:27:44,965 --> 01:27:46,488
Open the door!
