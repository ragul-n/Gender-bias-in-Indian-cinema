1
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,193
You always phone at
the wrong time.

2
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,993
Yes, l've reached Panchgani.

3
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,294
Don't you dare call me ma'am.

4
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,397
Okay, l'll call you.

5
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,635
Today is the first day of school.
l'll call you later.

6
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,143
Okay, bye. Bye.

7
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,276
Okay, guys. Shorts up.

8
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,407
Beautiful.

9
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,644
Look, guys.

10
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:21,947
Play the match again.

11
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,612
We'll make you five boys
do it five times.

12
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,317
Look, dialogues of heroes
don't suit naked ones.

13
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,087
Take 100 rupees and
end the matter.

14
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,025
We've only lost a match.
Why are you stripping us? Please.

15
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,526
ls your honour so cheap?

16
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,694
Debaucher.
You enjoy more than the girls.

17
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,034
Shut up. - Hurry up,
l've to pee too. Please.

18
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,040
Call the girls.
They're taking time.

19
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,474
Control it.
You can do it on his head later.

20
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,638
Oh buddy. - Boxers are down.
- lf you act smart..

21
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,875
..we'll make you walk the
entire campus like this.

22
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,109
Meet me after the tournament..

23
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,152
..we'll make you walk the Mall
Road with that in your hand.

24
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,652
Shut up!

25
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,183
Look, girls have come.

26
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,535
Such a deed on the first
day of summer vacation!

27
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,898
What the hell were
you guys thinking?

28
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,511
Answer me.

29
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,582
Ma'am,
honestly elastics were loose.

30
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,744
We didn't realize when
they dropped.

31
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,115
Oh really.
Everyone's at the same time?

32
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,145
Best friends for ever, ma'am.

33
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,353
The whole lot of you'll
keep kneeling..

34
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,756
..till your parents show up.

35
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,426
l hope l've made myself
very clear.

36
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,794
Get lost! These days she's
always in bad temper.

37
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,233
We didn't rape.
Anyway everyone was staring.

38
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,935
Nobody was looking at you.

39
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,369
Shut up. Nerd is in, boss.

40
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,139
Tia was staring the most, right?

41
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,804
She wasn't looking at anyone.

42
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,348
Why? Just because she's
your girlfriend..

43
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,815
..doesn't mean she can't
check us out.

44
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,148
Why will she check you out?
- Why won't she check me out?

45
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,653
Look at me and look at you.
Look at you.

46
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:42,386
Lord Krishna himself covers Tia's
eyes with veil of modesty.

47
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,457
By the time our vulgar
program ended..

48
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,567
..those veils must've
been lifted.

49
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,969
Hey. What a sight!
- Where?

50
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,197
What are you saying?

51
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,573
Careful.

52
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:57,709
Who is she?

53
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,311
She's a new teacher.

54
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,308
She's very hot.

55
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,009
Anita,
l just wanted to say to you..

56
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,912
..it's very important to keep
these children busy.

57
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,513
Or else there will
be some problems.

58
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,490
For example the swimming pool
incident of this morning.

59
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,392
And today is just the first
day of summer vacation.

60
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,428
2 whole months are left.

61
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,799
l know, ma'am.

62
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,458
So what have you planned
for them?

63
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,535
l've planned, ma'am, like
a series of activities.

64
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,835
Like for juniors, crafts, games.

65
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,136
And for seniors,
l think of making them do a play.

66
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,640
Wow.
- Yes.

67
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,080
Wonderful. Great idea.

68
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,046
Where do you want
to do rehearsals?

69
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,552
Rehearsals?
Anywhere, l mean in my house..

70
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,124
l've a big bungalow.
Or in school? - Whatever.

71
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,728
But keep in mind..
- Yes?

72
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,628
Be very strict with these children
from the very start. - Yes.

73
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,132
Or else these 18 years old..

74
00:08:55,801 --> 00:09:00,067
..there will be surely some
problem. They're very naughty.

75
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,902
Yes, ma'am.
- Okay? - Thank you. - All right.

76
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,976
Thank you.

77
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,510
Oh no. She's coming this way.

78
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,739
Come on.
- She's coming here.

79
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,781
Get back.
- Okay, guys, keep quiet.

80
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,600
Can you please help me?

81
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,567
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,646
What was it, brothers?

83
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,047
Whatever it was,
she shouldn't call me brother.

84
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,451
She has come for activities
during summer vacation.

85
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,388
We've to meet her tomorrow.

86
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,592
lt will be fun.

87
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,387
How old do you think she's?

88
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,664
24-25. But she's superb.

89
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,358
For the first time the school
personnel did something good.

90
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,128
lf you make such teachers teach,
l'll get top rank.

91
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,567
lt's history repeating itself.

92
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,997
Sahil is doing what
you used to do.

93
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,171
And on top of that you're local
guardians of these kids.

94
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,103
You can't handle your own child..

95
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,177
..you're spoiling other
children too.

96
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,276
Ma'am, don't worry.
We won't spare them.

97
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,008
We'll skin each other of them.

98
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,678
They won't remove pajamas even
to go to the bathroom.

99
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,921
Do whatever it takes,
l just don't care.

100
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,955
But this is the final warning.

101
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,324
l hope l've made myself
very clear.

102
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,804
Where the hell did they
come up with this?

103
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,541
Wickedness is in their genes,
brother.

104
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,107
He must be someone else's child.

105
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,407
My imagination was till stealing
teacher's duster..

106
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,310
..or whistling in the class.

107
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,543
Whoever had this idea
must be as sly as a fox.

108
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,382
lf it's our junior,
let's offer him a beer at night.

109
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,751
By the way, where is he?

110
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,993
The minute l heard my
first love story..

111
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,526
..l started looking for you..

112
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,520
..not knowing how blind l was.

113
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,593
Lovers don't find somewhere..

114
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,457
..than in each other all along.

115
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,568
Sahil.

116
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,044
Aren't you forgetting something?

117
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,748
Yeah, one minute.

118
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,830
Oh no.

119
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,173
Tia. Tia. - What are you doing?
Open the door.

120
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,072
Sahil. Sahil.

121
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,838
Sahil, open the door.

122
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,347
Sahil.

123
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,506
Tia, l've to go out.
Give me the car keys.

124
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,175
Open the door.
- What happened?

125
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,649
Sahil, mom.

126
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,720
Tia, hurry up.

127
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,284
What are you doing inside?

128
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,085
Why is it taking so long?

129
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,920
Tia, open the door please.

130
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,123
Tia, l'm getting late.

131
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,868
Tia.

132
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,799
Run. Through the window. Go.

133
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,904
Tia.

134
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,665
Hurry up. Go.

135
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,070
Tia, open the door.

136
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,176
Tia.

137
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,203
What were you doing?

138
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,573
Washing my hair, mom.

139
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,374
Washing her hair?

140
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,083
Give me my Sunny special.

141
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,814
Kenna,
don't give anything to Sunny.

142
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,388
Where is my second one?

143
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,354
Give me first.
- For me too.

144
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,358
lt's good.
- What's up?

145
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,221
Where is Tia? - She's washing
her hair. Don't ask me.

146
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,991
Washing hair? - What does Kenna
puts in his Frankie.

147
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,495
One isn't enough.

148
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,360
The secret of this taste,
is the smell of his hand.

149
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,832
From his childhood he had
stopped bathing.

150
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,168
Wow!
- Yuck!

151
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,833
This won't change the fact.

152
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,002
lf you don't want to eat,
give it to me. l'm famished.

153
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,303
You're fools.

154
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,780
Only marijuana can give this
effect. He takes it too.

155
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,443
Oh yes. Why don't we ask him?

156
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,377
Look.

157
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,521
She looks so beautiful.

158
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,327
l'm sweating seeing her jog.

159
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,952
Too good.

160
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:28,159
Dammit.
She's looking so hot, buddy.

161
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,602
Wow.

162
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,868
Look at her waist.

163
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,211
The real stuff is here, boys.

164
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,044
Why don't you smoke her?

165
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,648
lt will be overdose..

166
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,646
..in just one drag.

167
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,854
Oh no.. your eyes are so lustful.

168
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,086
You're so kind.

169
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,793
Do you know what happened
in school today?

170
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,024
4 plumbers were called.

171
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,197
You know why?
Because paper was leaked.

172
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:21,038
Don't do it. Don't do it,
son. Your eyes will become weak.

173
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,148
Tipsy, again the same thing.

174
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,815
Big pieces of cardamom
are coming in mouth.

175
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,386
That's the fun.

176
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,388
l don't want to eat
cardamom pilaf.

177
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,420
More than mutton,
l can taste this.

178
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,593
But when mother used
to cook pilaf..

179
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,230
..it had only its flavour.

180
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,437
lt was touch and go.

181
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,540
Touch and go.

182
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,364
You're talking of mother again.

183
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,966
You always compare with mother.

184
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,043
Because of performance pressure,
l lose confidence.

185
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,647
Why are you fighting like women?

186
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,341
We'll tell you if
it's fine or not.

187
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,483
lt seems chilli is less.

188
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,949
For you even an entire field
of chilli will be less.

189
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,851
Pawan, give it to me.

190
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,794
So-so.

191
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,227
Hey! First eat what's in
your mouth. Jerk!

192
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,162
Unnecessarily..
- What do you think, Sunny?

193
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,961
Uncle, l'll tell you.

194
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,298
l think rice is more.

195
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,567
Yes. He's a genius.
- Rice is more.

196
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,066
That's what we've, son.

197
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,175
Shot!

198
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,901
You've to eat that for lunch.

199
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,105
Uncle,
today we're not coming for lunch.

200
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,180
School is making us do
summer activities.

201
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,578
We've a meeting with a hottie.

202
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,677
Oh yes. Hottie.

203
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,885
You've exams after 2 months.
Why do you need activities?

204
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,225
Study at home.

205
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,453
Uncle,
actually we get exam stress.

206
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,028
So school is making us
do extra curricular..

207
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,861
..activities to relieve stress.

208
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,635
Stress? And you?

209
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,469
You ate 12 eggs here and
you talk of stress.

210
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,837
That hen will be in stress
begging you to stop eating eggs.

211
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,475
That reminds me of a joke on hen.

212
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,674
No. No.

213
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,655
Pass here.

214
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,889
Give it to me.
- Come on.

215
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,097
Pass it.

216
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,927
What are you doing?

217
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,125
Come on. Pass, pass.

218
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,465
Come on.

219
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,469
Come on.
- Come on, guys.

220
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,983
l'm strong.

221
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,052
Okay, can l speak?

222
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,248
Nobody will be late
for rehearsals.

223
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,456
This is a non smoking zone.

224
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,360
And my name is Anita.

225
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,224
And don't dare to call me ma'am.

226
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,459
Okay, ma'am.

227
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,590
Come on.

228
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,461
Ma'am, why are there rehearsals?

229
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,506
l've talked to your principal.

230
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,706
And we're doing a play.

231
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,367
A play?

232
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,311
A drama.
- Theatre. Drama. - Yes.

233
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,473
Ma'am,
but what will be the play about?

234
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,982
You think, you guys decide.

235
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,642
Ma'am,
how about one on Bollywood?

236
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,445
l'll become Ranjit
and rape everyone.

237
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,821
Let's do on culture.

238
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:32,090
Tenzeng will sing..

239
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,096
And Sunny will do Bhangra dance.

240
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,831
No, no, no.
Hold on. Nothing like that.

241
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,663
Actually it sounds a
little bit boring.

242
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,796
l think personally it should
be based on love.

243
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:43,942
What say?

244
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,509
Oh no. Not love.

245
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,236
l mean trust me, guys.
You'll love it.

246
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,808
lt's going to be amazing.

247
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,678
Love doesn't mean the
love you think.

248
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,341
l mean something different,
you know.

249
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,112
We'll do a parody on love.

250
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,145
You know some musical.
- No.

251
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,281
6-7 songs. Full of energy
and fun. That type..

252
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,688
Okay, what if Heer Ranjha's,
Romeo Juliet's..

253
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,126
..love stories have been complete?
What would have happened?

254
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,233
What?

255
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,163
Come on, guys. Think.

256
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,267
They would have been in a jam!
- What?

257
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,671
l mean..
they would have been thronged.

258
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,470
They would have, ma'am. They..

259
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,438
Anyway, okay..

260
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,381
So see you at rehearsals.
- Okay? - Okay.

261
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,884
Okay. Bye.

262
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,955
Bye.
- Bye, ma'am.

263
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,349
Lucky she didn't react
to what we said.

264
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,182
Or else we would have
been in a jam.

265
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,860
lt's true.

266
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,557
Ladies and gentlemen.

267
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,237
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

268
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,310
''Go to hell.
Just make sure it's long.''

269
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:59,213
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

270
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,947
''Sunny, we can see your thong.''

271
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:07,452
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

272
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,256
''When you're in trouble,
sing this song.''

273
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,129
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

274
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:19,863
''But the answer to every
question is this song.''

275
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:24,874
Just think what if Laila Majnu,
Heer Ranjha had been united?

276
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,480
''Only tears day and night.''

277
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,647
''They would have been in a jam.''

278
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,449
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

279
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,997
''Not everyone can
sing this song.''

280
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,567
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's timing too is wrong.''

281
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,761
''You jerks,
come and sing this song.''

282
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:05,107
''ln a jam.''

283
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,210
''ln a jam.''

284
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:10,985
Juliet.

285
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,820
''To hell with peace.
Get the post of a prime minister.''

286
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,552
''lt's their demand and command.''

287
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,151
''Boys are happy flirting around.''

288
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,562
''First shopping then
pub hopping.''

289
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:26,399
''Romeo gets stripped.
Fools are better than that.''

290
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,702
''That's right.
Tears day and night.''

291
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,006
''They would have been in a jam.''

292
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,809
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

293
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,350
''Even Adam must've
sung this song.''

294
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,616
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

295
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,156
''Don't be tense. Just bounce.''

296
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,783
Dumpling.
- No, jam.

297
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,829
Boys, can we just get
back to the issue?

298
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,626
''You get in trouble,
if you fall in love.''

299
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,828
''First marriage, then kids.''

300
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,735
''How cute!
- Life becomes a dull job.''

301
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,776
''Only tears day and night.''

302
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,540
''They would have been in a jam.''

303
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:13,343
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

304
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,751
''When you're in trouble,
sing this song.''

305
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,256
''This is a ''Jam'' song.
lt's totally wrong.''

306
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,759
''Today, tomorrow.
- Louder.''

307
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:29,391
''One day we all be in a jam.''

308
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,203
''The jam song.''

309
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,499
Guys, today it was fun. We never
dreamt we would do a play.

310
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,300
Forget the play.

311
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,376
Ma'am in small knickers..
everyday..

312
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,173
l was scared but..

313
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,812
..he turned out to be a singer.

314
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,782
Oh. - He's skilled in cooking,
knitting and cleaning.

315
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,317
Our Sahil has interest
in music and dramas.

316
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,690
He's a gem. Wow.

317
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,516
Look, she's coming.

318
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,534
So cute.

319
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,335
Hey, guys. Don't be late
for rehearsals. - Yeah.

320
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,444
Okay. Bye.

321
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,512
Bye.

322
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,743
lsn't her lips too full?

323
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,851
''l like them very much.''

324
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,753
Guys, relax. Anyone can get
it from Silicon Valley.

325
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,083
You're justjealous, Tia.

326
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,887
No. l'm not. lt's 100% fake.

327
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,129
Guys, how do you come to know
if it's real or fake?

328
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,698
Kiss.

329
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,266
After all, who will kiss?

330
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,666
Whoever shows the guts
will get 1000 rupees.

331
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,365
For such work, one doesn't
need guts but wickedness.

332
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,735
Who can avoid the elbow?.
- Stop.

333
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,244
You're laughing a lot?

334
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,314
lt's damn funny.

335
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,417
No, it's not funny. Let these
perverts do whatever they want.

336
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,316
You're not going to be a part of
it. - l didn't say anything..

337
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:59,014
She goes for jogging
every evening.

338
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,318
Wearing shorts..

339
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,755
Wonderful.

340
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,062
Guys. Guys, come on.
- Oh my God.

341
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,966
l want to go forjogging
everyday..

342
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,231
.. but who will wake up
early during vacation?

343
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,620
Hello, stud.

344
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,162
Oh hi, ma'am. How are you?

345
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,929
How come you're here today?

346
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,627
Ma'am, actually l go for a run
everyday so that's why l'm here.

347
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,036
Alone? - Yes.
- You don't have a girlfriend?

348
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,006
Yes.. no.. as in just a
casual scene, you know.

349
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,377
Casual scene?

350
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,945
Yes.

351
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,173

00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,458
Putting ice cubes.

396
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,626
lce cubes are not put like this.

397
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,896
You need to find two
perfect cubes.

398
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,056
Perfect cubes? All are the same.

399
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,033
They seem to be, but they're not.

400

00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,239

Have you gone mad?

417
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,182
Maybe.

418
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,384
At times watch religious
movies too..

419
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,890
..if you had studied with
such determination..

420
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,496
..you wouldn't have
failed in exam.

421
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,627
l've worked out something, guys.

422
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,069
l've not found the exact
story line yet.

423
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,304
But we'll get it.

424
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,232
lt's a seduction scene, guys.

425
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,941
So pick a partner and get ready.

426
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,600
But ma'am,
it doesn't have my name.

427
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,269
Because you'll become a tree,
son of a.. sweetie.

428
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,913
Silly,
at least that tree will sway.

429
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,244
You'll become a sofa.

430
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,285
Sweetie, let's try this.

431
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,286
Ma'am, how can she seduce me?
- l really don't know, ma'am.

432
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,829
At least try.

lt's a play. You've to. Try it.

435

No.

436
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,573
Okay.

437
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,981
Take him completely off guard.

438
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,385
And without taking your
eyes off him..

439
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,923
..slowly and slowly
move towards him.

440
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,702
Touch him..

441
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,971

Push him in paradise.

445
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,488
And then slowly and slowly..

446
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,197
..move towards your paradise.

447
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,563
On his lips..

448
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,787
Something like that.
- Yes, ma'am. - Show over, boys.

449
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,053
Raj, stop gaping.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,196
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,794
Ma'am was looking so hot.

453
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,701

00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,047
Juliet? She won't come.
- Do you want to go with her?

471
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,742
At least ask her.

472
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:26,853
Juliet.

473
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,326

What are they doing?

510
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,833
What a hunk, by God!

511
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,409
Totally hottie.

512
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,575
What a dimples! Did you see?

513
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,445
l saw more pimples.

514
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,948
You jealous freaking losers.

515
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,077
lf a girl is even blind,
you find her sexy.

516
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,017
But if a boy is a hunk,
it's nothing.

517
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,750
No matter what, the bet is off.

518
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,553
Now there is no need for a kiss.

519
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,261
Exactly. Let's ask him if
they're real or not.

520
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,699
But how would he know?.

521
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,802
Hey, it's obvious.
- Let's go. Come on.

522

l heard they're going
to get married.

526
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,595
They've a 5 years
old relationship.

527
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,118
No matter what, the bet is off.

528
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,811
Now there is no need for a kiss.

529
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,357
Exactly. Let's ask him if
they're real or not.

530
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,930
l love you very much.

531
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,767
Your tender eyes define my life.

532
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,345
Yuck.

l wanted to tell you..

535
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,585
What's the matter, Sahil?

536
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,255
You were memorizing two pages
long dialogue till yesterday.

537
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,058
But today you can say
even two lines.

538
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,897
Drama will go on, baby.

539
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,993
First see this new blockbuster
in your happening city.

540
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,196
Which one?

541
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,507
Headless Corpse.

542
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,977
Headless Corpse. - Everyone will
watch it together. Okay?

543
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,173
But first go and take Sahil
and Sweetie's rehearsals.

544
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,908
l'll take their rehearsals.

545
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,007
My pleasure.

546
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,585
Come on, guys. Come.

547
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,917
Ma'am, coming.
- Everyone. You too. - Yes.

548
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:00,991
You can't do it.

549
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,560
Hello.

550
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:04,995

What happened, Suman?

553
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,831
Someone is behind the car.

554
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:49,865
''Wise backs, only fools rush in.''

555
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:56,299
''But l can't help falling
in love with you.''

556
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,102
''Falling in love with you.''

557
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,235
''Falling in love with you.''

558
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,704
Stop. Stop it. Stop.

559
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,140

00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,983
Yeah, let's go. - Anyway after
fritters walk is a must. Come on.

567
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:52,561
Let's leave.

568
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,926
Bye, guys. - Bye, ma'am. Thanks

569
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,522

00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,101

Thanks a lot. Bye, see you.

575
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,402
Hey. Leave it. Stop that.

576
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,480
Come on, my dear.
Today l won't spare you.

577
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,543
Hey, wait. - l don't know
what's with this movies.

578
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,676
What are you doing? Tell him.

579
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,289
Come here.

580
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:20,817
The boy is in love.

581
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,359
Who?

582
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,983
Your hero.

583
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,195
With whom?

584
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,156
With you.

585
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,296
Did you've 3 or 6 beers?

586
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,828
l'm not kidding, Anita.

587
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,165
He couldn't see us together,
that's why he get down.

588
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,432
You should have written the
story of Headless Corpse.

589
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,973
You deduct cheap logic.

590
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:42,739
Want to bet 100 rupees?

591
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,813
500 rupees.

592
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,708
l've not heard anything
more rubbish.

593
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,544
The Romeo has hit thejackpot.

594
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,817
What?
- Romeo.

595
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,992
Romeo Juliet.

596
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,562
No, Rogue Juliet.

597
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,200
Hey, no cheating.

598
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,704
This is a non smoking zone, stud.

599
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:54,933
Really?

600
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,875
Then it should apply
to everybody. Right?

601
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,748
Some people are allowed.

602
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,211
Oh, so you're in this mood today?

603
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,824
Let's arm wrestle.

604
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,887
lf you win, you can smoke too.

605
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,097
What crap!

606
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:19,158
No, he's right. Rules should
be for everyone or no one.

607
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:21,604
Shall we?

608
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,579
You cheated.

609
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,588
All is fair in love and war.

610
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,421
Neither love nor war
is going on here.

611
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,222
lt's only stupidity which
doesn't suit your age.

612
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:25,061
Sahil. Sahil. Sahil.

613
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:30,302
Listen. Listen. Listen.

614
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,554
Hi, stud.
- Hi.

615
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:56,851
How come you're here?

616
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,295
Just like..
- Romeo.

617
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,202
You're here too?

618
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,128
You must've thought,
she'll be alone. l'll pounce.

619
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,340
What?

620
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,374
Nothing, baby. lt's between men.

621
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,372
Okay. l'll see you. Bye.

622
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,178
Are not those sexy legs?

623
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,952
Romeo, tell me the truth.
Does she come in your dreams?

624
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,721
Does she? Tell me.

625
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,190
Kiddo, let's make the
final decision today.

626
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,360
Let's see who gets her.

627
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,134
Come on. What happened?
Are you scared?

628
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,629
l win. As always.
- What the..

629
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,935
Romeo, l win as always.

630
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,142
Samuel.

631
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,908
Even his T-shirt is torn.

632
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,073
l gave him this one.

633
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,048
Does it look nice
to act like kids?

634
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,482
You're 33, Samuel Mathews
and not freaking 3.

635
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,656
But even our hero isn't a kid.

636
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,188
Look at his body. lt's full on.

637
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,499
Stop it, Samuel.
He must be in pain.

638
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,593
He'll be in pain if you
apply such cream.

639
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:49,965
lt's a man's cure.

640
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,074
Stop it.

641
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,106
Take some rum.

642
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,611
You'll be fine.

643
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,140
Stop it, Samuel. l'm telling
you to stop it. - lt's okay.

644
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,077
Stop it.

645
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,724
She feels for you, kiddo.

646
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,690
Your score has increased.

647
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,731
She cares for you.
Give a smile, sly one.

648
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,995
Samuel, stop it.
Just get lost from here. Stop it.

649
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,374
Move it.

650
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,549
Baby.

651
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,116
Samuel, what are you doing?

652
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,183
Listen.

653
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,180
Stop it.

654
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,854
Am l going to be kicked out,
ma'am?

655
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,925
Come on, Samuel.

656
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,858
Are you going to change
the party?

657
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,368
Shut up, Samuel.

658
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,669
You know l love you.

659
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,737
So apply medicine to me too.

660
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,835
lt's not like that.

661
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,975
Come here. Why?

662
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,744
l missed you, that's why.

663
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,046
Really?
- Yeah.

664
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,317
Where did he go?

665
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,684
Didn't l tell you?
Now pay up 500 rupees.

666
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:47,790
For what?

667
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,091
For the bet.

668
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,024
Samuel, again?

669
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,588
He loves you like crazy. He left.
He couldn't see us together.

670
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,790
l'm telling you.

671
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,070
Are not those sexy legs?

672
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,509
Romeo, tell me the truth.
Does she come in your dreams?

673
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,615
l win as always.

674
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,886
He scored a basket.

675
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,327
Boys. Boys. Come on.

676
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,296
Great! You're in full form today.

677
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:33,031
Did you sleep soundly last night?

678
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,935
Did you sleep alone
or with someone?

679
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:40,234
Yes, dude.
Ma'am in shorts came in my dream.

680
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,874
Oh. What happened then?

681
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,709
Nothing.
She came to say good night to me.

682
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,816
Sweet dreams.

683
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,281
Did she leave saying good night?

684
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,876
l wouldn't let her go like that.

685
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,854
So what did you do?

686
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,322
Kiss.

687
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,884
That's all?
- No.

688
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,688
First our hands touched..

689
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,255
..then our lips,
then l was on top of her.

690
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,163
No, no, no. She was on top of me.

691
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,530
Then l was on top of her.

692
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:11,740
And then l was..
yeah, yeah, come on. Come on.

693
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,909
Sahil, what are you doing?
Are you mad?

694
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,350
You fool!

695
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,513
ls Anita your mistress?

696
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,354
Can't anyone else
think about her?

697
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,723
l was doing it only in dreams.

698
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,487
But Samuel does it day and night.

699
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,793
You saw that.

700
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,994
What will you do?
Will you fight with him too?

701
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:45,465
How dare you hit you!

702
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,764
20. How much was yours? 18.
- Yes.

703
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,301
What happened with Tarun today?

704
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,568
Nothing. He was talking rubbish.
- What rubbish was he saying?

705
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,005
He didn't say anything wrong.

706
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:23,373
Anita and Samuel are a couple so
they'll do what couples do.

707
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,380
And you hit him with
a basketball.

708
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,814
That's not cool dude.
Do you think..

709
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,351
..Anita and Samuel must be
singing hymns at home?

710
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,013
No, they must be doing
it in bedroom..

711
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,249
..bathroom, kitchen and garden.

712
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,984
Don't start again. Okay?

713
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,391
She isn't cheap to do
this before marriage.

714
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,361
Hey! Leave it.

715
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,729
Wow, Sahil, amazing.
What am l then?

716
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,930
l feel like slapping you.

717
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:54,572
Anita and Samuel could be doing
anything. Why do you feel bad?

718
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,271
l don't understand.
Why are you so jealous?

719
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,745
Because she's not like that.

720
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,145
Like what?

721
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,683
She doesn't love Samuel.

722
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,150
lt's a casual scene.
She doesn't sleep with him.

723
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,348
Really? You know a lot.
- How about a 1000 rupees wager?

724
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,654
Let's see if they're sleeping or
not. - l too bet 500 rupees.

725
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,022
l bet 100.

726
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,095
Fine.

727
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,593
Where are you going?

728
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,688
To see.
l'm going to prove you wrong.

729
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,768
Hey, stop. Stay here quietly.
- What's your problem?

730
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,451
l think someone is there.

731
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,518
Athief.

732
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,928
Shut up. l'll check.

733
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:22,022
My God!
- No, no, no.

734
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,558
Hey, guys. l'm telling you..

735
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,491
Hey, listen. Listen.

736
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,499
You really went to her house?

737
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,570
Entire school is mocking, Sahil.
What are you doing?

738
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:43,273
Why are you quiet?

739
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,278
l've been observing for so long.
What has happened to you?

740
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,086
Are you in love with her?

741
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,012
l'm fed up of this indiscipline.

742
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,705
Are you going to do the same
thing on the play day too?

743
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,010
Sorry, ma'am.
- Gojoin them. - And Tenzen..

744
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,585
..l don't want to explain the
same thing again and again.

745
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,812
Yes, be like this.

746
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,946
l think the night had
been very rough.

747
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,155
Did she see Sahil naked?

748
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:35,296
lt's possible. Or else these are
those 5 days of the month..

749
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,165
Sorry.

750
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,358
Look at Prachi.

751
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,331
Seeing her,
it seems it goes on all the year.

752
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,899
Yes, yes, better.
- Romeo.

753
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,166
You seem to be scared.

754
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,371
You enter everyday like a hero.

755
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,538
What has happened today?
You're walking stealthily.

756
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,240
Did you do any feat?

757
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,452
Sahil, come here.
l want to talk to you.

758
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,124
Kiddo, best of luck.

759
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,858
Go now.

760
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,963
He's a goner.
He'll be slapped hard.

761
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,332
Sahil, what were you doing
last night at my home?

762
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,873
Sahil, what were you doing
last night at my home?

763
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,780
How dare you enter my house?

764
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:37,051
But Anita ma'am.. - l'll slap you
here in front of everyone.

765
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:41,253
l don't know whom to phone.

766
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,294
Your parents,
principal or the police.

767
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:49,763
Seriously, Sahil..

768
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,167
..if l'm in this play..

769
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,577
..then you shouldn't be here.

770
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,239
You shouldn't be here.

771
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:00,708
So leave right now.

772
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:07,783
l said leave right now, Sahil.
Leave!

773
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,875
l was wondering, should we
serve juice or cold drink?

774
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,173
Let's serve poison.

775
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:34,550
He's going to be 18 not 80.

776
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,415
He's going to be 18 not 80.

777
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,583
Let's order vodka and wine.

778
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,017
He's going to be a man.

779
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,281
Look,
l'm not going to clean up vomits.

780
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,627
Great.
Did you forget your own days?

781
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:50,728
Look who is here.
The angry young man.

782
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,590
Where are you coming from?

783
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,330
What have you done? Tell me.

784
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,938
Get away from me!

785
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,807
Dammit.
l gave you what you asked for.

786
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,046
l didn't mean again
what you refused.

787
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:14,552
l've been more than
a mother to you.

788
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,920
Whatever you did it's not
acceptable. Do you understand?

789
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,031
Don't you walk away when
l'm talking to you?

790
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:24,433
Come right back.

791
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,128
l want you to apologize
right now.

792
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,938
Sahil. Sahil.

793
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,549
Should l go or will
you hit again?

794
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:02,793
Come on, buddy. We should have
resolved it in private.

795
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,575
We should have exchanged
few punches and kicks.

796
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,003
We should have settled
it like a man.

797
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:12,745
You shouldn't do all these in
front of elders like Gypsy.

798
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,817
Sorry, uncle.

799
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:17,885
Be quiet. Don't apologize.

800
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,184
What has happened to you?

801
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,390
l've been observing for a week.

802
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,755
How would l know if
you don't tell me.

803
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,297
Come on, let's play Ten Crushes.

804
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,225
Did you break up with Tia?

805
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,429
Did Tia break up with you?

806
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,241
Did someone else come in between?

807
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,024
Hello, Gips. ls Sam there?

808
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,331
Yeah, Nina.
Do you know where Sam is?

809
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:33,995
Hello, Sam.

810
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:37,222
We're speaking from police
station. Can we talk to Anita?

811
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,629
Yes, Anita speaking. Tell me.

812
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,894
Come here quickly.
- Why?

813
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,598
Obviously we're not calling
you to play rummy.

814
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,403
lf you come, you'll know.

815
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,391
Don't act smart.

816
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,528
Tell me your name.
- Your name?

817
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,432
Come on, sign here.

818
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:16,527
Don't apologize.
- Sir, we won't do it again.

819
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,933
Enough of it.

820
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:28,747
Come, miss Anita. Sit.

821
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,514
Sit.

822
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,783
Your younger sister gave
your phone number.

823
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,585
So we called you.

824
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,358
She was caught in
a rave party in..

825
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,260
..a farm house away
from the city.

826
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,732
As she looks like a minor..

827
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,772
..l doubted she wasn't
there willingly.

828
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,509
Who took her?

829
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:57,144
A boy with an English name.

830
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,207
What was his name?

831
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,184
Samuel.

832
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:05,186
Samuel.

833
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,021
He was 1 7-18 years elder to her.

834
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,889
He fled by the time we brought
him to the jeep.

835
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,887
But the day l nab him..

836
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,529
..l'll strip him and skin him.

837
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,694
You seem to be from
a decent family.

838
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,999
So l'm leaving her
with a warning.

839
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,032
Take her along.

840
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:32,709
And if thatjerk ever
phones you..

841
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:36,508
..or comes in front of you,
please inform the police.

842
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:38,520
Okay?

843
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:40,655
Take her along.

844
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:01,766
l didn't know, ma'am. l swear.

845
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,146
He said we're going
out for dinner.

846
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:07,881
And there..

847
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,298
Leave me!

848
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,958
Samuel, please.

849
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,594
Don't cry.

850
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:57,499
l'll drop you.

851
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,268
Don't cry.

852
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:14,244
Where are you coming from today?

853
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:19,445
Police station.

854
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,489
lt's waiting for you.

855
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,157
Police station? Why?

856
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,123
Aren't you ashamed
to talk rubbish?

857
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,965
How can you be such a swine,
Samuel?

858
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,537
l took her for a party. Big deal.

859
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:39,834
She's 16.

860
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,706
How could you even touch her?

861
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:46,378
Go and ask her. She dances
around me all the time.

862
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,173
lt's fine for her.

863
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:51,352
Yes,
because she's not my boyfriend.

864
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,091
l'm sick and tired of this.

865
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,754
What happened?

866
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,514
ls everything fine?

867
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,092
How is your play going on?

868
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,297
Uncle, she removed me from it.

869
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:40,535
Why?

870
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:46,774
Okay..

871
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:51,980
By the way..

872
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,340
..there isn't any deed
in the world..

873
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:55,814
..which a flower can't resolve.

874
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,295
Anita.

875
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,167
What happened?

876
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,610
The wound is very deep.

877
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:02,643
How did you get hurt?

878
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,511
l slipped in the bathroom. Soap..

879
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,315
Soap? Huh?

880
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,888
Well my advice will be..

881
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:18,121
..stay away from the ''Soap''
on which you slipped.

882
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,457
Who is he? Younger brother.

883
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:23,638
No.

884
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,236
Anyway, you people take care.

885
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:27,575
Come on, nurse.

886
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,203
Where are you coming from today?

887
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,834
Police station.

888
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:02,808
lt's waiting for you.

889
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,844
How can you be such a swine,
Samuel?

890
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,439
l took her for a party. Big deal.

891
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:10,813
She's 16.

892
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,479
How could you even touch her?

893
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:17,456
Go and ask her. She dances
around me all the time.

894
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,493
Yes,
because she's not my boyfriend.

895
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:39,971
Thank you.

896
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:52,985
Thanks.

897
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,237
What happened to you?

898
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,605
You're acting smart with me,
silly.

899
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,939
After looting,
you're acting innocent.

900
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:47,537
Yes, Sahil. l was perplexed.

901
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,207
l was bringing eggs from Tony's.

902
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,509
''On the ground..''

903
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,383
What's going on between you two?

904
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,783
Either you climb on her windows
or she's on your scooter.

905
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,621
And what's this going
on actually?

906
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,786
l saw you carry fruits
on your scooter.

907
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,998
The matter has reached so far
but you didn't tell us.

908
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,329
He won't talk to us now.
lt's a different league.

909
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,129
To hell with league.

910
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,795
l want a treat.

911
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,339
Notjust a treat, but a party.

912
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,635
lt's not a small thing to
seen on the streets..

913
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:16,607
..of Panchgani with
someone in shorts.

914
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,679
Understood? We want party.

915
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,442
Forget that.
l've thought of a killerjoke.

916
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,641
What do you call a man who
can shake the moon?

917
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,417
Chandra (moon) Shekhar.

918
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:12,700
Sahil.

919
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:16,330
You know how much l missed
you in the class today.

920
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:19,841
ln the canteen.

921
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,567
At the rehearsals.

922
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,040
And then in my room.

923
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,487
Sahil. Listen. Listen to me.

924
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,796
What has happened to you?

925
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,899
Did l err?

926
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:50,971
Look. Look.. look at me.

927
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,301
Look, l apologize.

928
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:56,140
Look at me.

929
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,145
What has happened to you?

930
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:09,490
Sorry.

931
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:10,658
Why sorry?

932
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,117
Why are you sorry?

933
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:14,862
Why?

934
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,297
What has happened?

935
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:18,598
Why don't you talk to me?

936
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,592
Why don't you talk to me, Sahil?

937
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:28,104
Tell me. Speak up. Speak!

938
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,509
Why don't you talk to me?

939
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,011
You're saying sorry too.

940
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:40,513
What has happened?

941
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:45,854
l hate you. l hate you for
this. l hate you for this!

942
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:47,926
l hate you.

943
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:35,977
Anita.

944
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:40,180
Anita, what happened?

945
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,342
My friend had phoned.

946
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:48,884
He met Samuel.

947
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:55,594
He was saying these were the
worst 5 years of his life.

948
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:05,530
And l spent my entire life
in these 5 years.

949
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,883
l think the calculation
is a bit off.

950
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,919
You'll need at least
3 such boxes.

951
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:32,962
Actually, girls are on diet,
so it will be enough for us.

952
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,632
What if it's less?
Don't blame me.

953
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,704
No, uncle.

954
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:39,766
By the way, how did you make the
plan to go to Sunny's house?

955
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,739
Actually he insisted so..
- Okay.

956
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:45,436
Watch it. lt will break.

957
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:46,878
Hey, where are you going?

958
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:48,677
He was going to your house.

959
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:51,076
My house?
When was this plan made?

960
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,753
We were coming her to play poker.

961
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:55,247
So where is this Ace
of Spear going?

962
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:58,186
Huh?
Who is going to eat my pilaf?

963
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:00,087
Uncle, actually.

964
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:04,188
She's not well so l was thinking
of taking some..

965
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:05,727
Who is not well?

966
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:09,299
Okay, kiddo.
So the matter has come to pilaf.

967
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:13,272
Will she eat or will you
feed her in your laps?

968
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:14,772
Come on.

969
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,639
Even we'll join you. Come on.

970
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:17,802
No, thanks. Bye.

971
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,472
Wait, Sahil.
- Sahil, wait.

972
01:26:58,713 --> 01:26:59,680
Some tea for you.

973
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:01,148
No, thank you.

974
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,075
Morning, Champ.

975
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,745
The lady has been waiting for you
since the past 30 minutes.

976
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,115
She was saying,
she slipped in the bathroom.

977
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,086
l said, this is the age to slip.

978
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:15,563
Excuse me.

979
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:16,630
Sure. Sure.

980
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:22,570
Hi.

981
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:24,104
Hi.

982
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:25,806
How are you?

983
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:28,142
l'm fine.

984
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:31,378
Come.

985
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,747
l think l owe you a treat.

986
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:41,655
Coffee.

987
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,122
l don't like bitter things.

988
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,052
Develop a taste then.

989
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:50,195
You'll get only that in life.

990
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:54,058
But you've choices too.

991
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,335
Kiddo, when you're in love..

992
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:02,840
..you even forget the
spelling of ''Choice''.

993
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,445
What were you doing at
my home last night?.

994
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:14,985
No, l..

995
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:16,584
l saw you, Sahil.

996
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:21,962
l brought pilaf.

997
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:23,797
Where is it?

998
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:30,500
You should have come inside.
Anyway l was very low.

999
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:35,032
Finally l broke up with Samuel.

1000
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,991
One coffee.

1001
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:53,326
They've started.

1002
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:55,929
lt natural. First hello hi.

1003
01:28:57,632 --> 01:29:01,033
lf they mingle so much,
they'll surely be in love.

1004
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:05,037
l would have got it too.
Sahil is still good looking.

1005
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:06,697
And ma'am is on full rebound.

1006
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,331
There is a chance to
stumbling again.

1007
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,135
And it suddenly just hits you,
dude.

1008
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:13,714
One doesn't know how and before
you realise you're in love.

1009
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:15,916
Love?

1010
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:22,682
Pass the ball.

1011
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,660
Your love story is
going on full on.

1012
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,059
We've made a story inspired
by your love story.

1013
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:30,858
Seriously.
- Do you want to hear it?

1014
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,729
''Sahil's down with a flu.''

1015
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,904
''He said l love you.''

1016
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:45,373
'''today we saw the ma'am at
the zoo. - l love you.''

1017
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:47,845
''Everything is about you.
- l love you.''

1018
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:56,948
''Even when he does poo-poo.
- Poo-poo.''

1019
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:59,683
''She elder to him.''

1020
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:02,758
''She's drama teacher.''

1021
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:08,267
''She's very sexy. Anita Joseph.''

1022
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,197
''Anita Joseph.''

1023
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:15,772
''Anita Joseph.''

1024
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,005
You and l would have made
a kick-ass option.

1025
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:21,115
Really?

1026
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:26,777
But we befriend good people and
fall in love with bad ones.

1027
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:35,592
''They have started dating.''

1028
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:42,029
''Does this happen in love..''

1029
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:53,907
''lf they mingle so much,
they'll surely..''

1030
01:30:54,382 --> 01:31:00,252
''..fall in love. Love.''

1031
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:06,224
''Love. Love.''

1032
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,793
''She would have been in
love with me too..''

1033
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:13,526
''..Sahil is still good looking.
- Balls..''

1034
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,192
Forget it. Let it go.

1035
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,237
''Love. Love.''

1036
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:19,999
''Love. Love.''

1037
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:22,041
My birthday is after 6 days.

1038
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,569
What?. Seriously.

1039
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:26,646
After 6 days.
- Yes.

1040
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,942
Thank God you're a Gemini
not a Cancerian.

1041
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,210
Oh Samuel's sun sign.

1042
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,548
Wasn't it very difficult
to guess?

1043
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:39,057
''Ma'am is on the re-bound.''

1044
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:41,661
''There is a chance of
stumbling again.''

1045
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:43,855
Suddenly it hits you, dude.
- You don't know how.

1046
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:46,860
And before you realize,
you're in love.

1047
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:50,368
Love and affection.
- Shut up!

1048
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:01,912
''What have you done?
You stole my friend's heart.''

1049
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:07,851
''What have you done?
You stole my friend's heart.''

1050
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:18,722
''What will happen now?.''

1051
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:27,001
''O my dear. O my dear.''

1052
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:30,077
Silent clap.

1053
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:36,979
Today is my birthday, guys.
Wear good make-up.

1054
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:39,241
Tell Pawan too.

1055
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:41,484
By the way,
what gift is she giving to you?

1056
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:44,989
Gift? His new girlfriend must
be coming as a gift.

1057
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:47,393
Only ribbon needs to be cut.

1058
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:48,562
Shut up, man.

1059
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,597
Shut up, man.
- Hey, shut up man!

1060
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:09,606
''Dreams dwell in sleep..''

1061
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:17,519
''..rainbow in the rain..''

1062
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:26,422
''..without taking a drink..''

1063
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:32,271
''..why am in this condition?''

1064
01:33:54,428 --> 01:34:03,928
''When dawn changes to dusk..''

1065
01:34:04,872 --> 01:34:14,372
''..the moonlight covers
the earth..''

1066
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:24,218
''Without saying a word,
everything gets explained.''

1067
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:34,397
''..a passion in the
heart is kindled.''

1068
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:40,198
''Dreams dwell in sleep..''

1069
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:45,507
''..rainbow in the rain..''

1070
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:51,212
''..without taking a drink..''

1071
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:55,379
''..why am in this condition?''

1072
01:34:55,623 --> 01:35:00,287
''Your intoxication.''

1073
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:05,461
''Your intoxication.''

1074
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:15,065
''When dawn changes to dusk..''

1075
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:25,508
''..the moonlight covers
the earth..''

1076
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:31,087
Sahil. What are you doing here?

1077
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:35,091
Actually l was passing by so..

1078
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:37,497
Are you busy?

1079
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:39,498
No, come. Come.

1080
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:44,467
Tipsy gifted me wine and..

1081
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:46,733
l don't know how to open it.

1082
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:49,868
So l was thinking..

1083
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:54,447
..you know,
l was wondering that the bottle..

1084
01:35:58,018 --> 01:35:59,645
So you want to have
a drink with me.

1085
01:36:01,889 --> 01:36:02,856
Show me.

1086
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:06,059
Only one bottle.

1087
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,327
Oh..

1088
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:09,863
Okay.

1089
01:36:55,976 --> 01:37:00,743
''Through the eyes..''

1090
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:05,918
''..young dreams..''

1091
01:37:06,387 --> 01:37:13,987
''..are soaring high.''

1092
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:21,928
''The fast heartbeat..''

1093
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:26,837
''..deep desires..''

1094
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:35,545
''..is about to be expressed.''

1095
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:43,952
''May they moment come
to a standstill.''

1096
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:54,397
''Let me snatch the happiness.''

1097
01:37:57,671 --> 01:38:06,409
''Your path may be my nemesis..''

1098
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:16,854
''..but l wait impatiently
for you on this path.''

1099
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:28,201
''Under the shower of dewdrops,
the melodies unite.''

1100
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:33,467
''..without taking a drink..''

1101
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:37,475
''..why am in this condition?''

1102
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:44,243
''Dreams dwell in sleep..''

1103
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:48,412
''..rainbow in the rain..''

1104
01:38:49,556 --> 01:38:54,016
''..without taking a drink..''

1105
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:58,625
''..why am in this condition?''

1106
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:03,294
''Your intoxication.'''

1107
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:09,001
''Your intoxication.''

1108
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:14,206
''Your intoxication.''

1109
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:22,086
''lt's your intoxication.
lt's your intoxication.''

1110
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:52,752
''Your intoxication.''

1111
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:42,495
What are you doing here, Sahil?

1112
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:45,738
What are you doing here?

1113
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:47,941
l..

1114
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:50,836
First tell me,
what are you doing, Anita?

1115
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:53,742
Why did you throw me out last
night? - Did Samuel come back?

1116
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:55,447
After everything you
let him back.

1117
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:56,913
How can you..
- Just shut up!

1118
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:58,917
And how dare you talk
to me like this?

1119
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:01,951
l made a mistake last night.

1120
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,820
We erred. Enough of it.

1121
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:08,717
And don't dare to act
like my boyfriend.

1122
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:28,745
Sahil, please. Just go away.

1123
01:42:34,681 --> 01:42:37,844
Hey, champion. What happened?

1124
01:42:41,455 --> 01:42:42,547
What happened to him?

1125
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:45,447
Uncle, if you drink so much
coffee, you'll surely fall ill.

1126
01:42:45,726 --> 01:42:46,693
Meaning?

1127
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:50,962
Ma'am in shorts like coffee.

1128
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:53,157
What are you saying?

1129
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:58,364
Adam. Eve. Apple.

1130
01:43:00,474 --> 01:43:01,463
What rubbish!

1131
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:04,137
Come on, you don't know.

1132
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:45,410
Do you..

1133
01:43:55,529 --> 01:43:57,963
Sahil and you..

1134
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:03,836
l mean..

1135
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:06,971
You two..

1136
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,339
Do you understand what
l'm trying to say?

1137
01:44:14,348 --> 01:44:15,315
Yes.

1138
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:16,746
lt's a family emergency.

1139
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:19,312
l've to leave tonight.

1140
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:21,945
ls everything fine?

1141
01:44:22,222 --> 01:44:23,814
lt's fine till now, ma'am.

1142
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:27,354
But if l don't leave today,
it won't be fine.

1143
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:30,327
And when will you return?

1144
01:44:30,864 --> 01:44:33,458
l don't know, ma'am. Maybe never.

1145
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:37,261
Well then l guess,
nothing can be done.

1146
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:39,396
Come on, boys. Focus.

1147
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:07,663
Anita. Anita.

1148
01:45:09,503 --> 01:45:11,061
Anita.

1149
01:45:13,707 --> 01:45:14,765
Anita.

1150
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:51,477
Sahil,
you shouldn't have come here.

1151
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:57,543
You shouldn't have come here.
- Anita.

1152
01:45:57,684 --> 01:46:01,950
Sahil.
- Please don't go, Anita. Please.

1153
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:07,224
l love you, okay?
l really love you.

1154
01:46:07,327 --> 01:46:09,352
Anita, if you leave..

1155
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:13,030
..l'll die. l'll die.

1156
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:16,500
l'll die.
Please don't go. l love you.

1157
01:46:18,138 --> 01:46:19,662
You can't go, Anita.

1158
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:23,435
You didn't even think about me.

1159
01:46:24,311 --> 01:46:26,370
Sahil, all this is wrong.

1160
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:28,742
Please understand.

1161
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:31,042
This is wrong.

1162
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:33,849
This is wrong, Sahil.

1163
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:37,789
This is wrong.

1164
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:43,460
Anita.

1165
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:48,957
No..

1166
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,513
This is wrong.

1167
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:45,784
l love you.

1168
01:48:56,930 --> 01:49:01,424
''Your intoxication.''

1169
01:49:03,336 --> 01:49:07,295
''Your intoxication.''

1170
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:25,824
''Your intoxication.''

1171
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:11,731
''Dreams dwell in sleep..''

1172
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:17,071
''..rainbow in the rain..''

1173
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:23,513
''..without taking a drink..''

1174
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:30,181
''..why am in this condition?''

1175
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:51,401
Go, Sahil. Go.

1176
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:41,354
Dear, stud. l've to go.

1177
01:51:42,128 --> 01:51:44,824
lf l say,
everything will be ruined.

1178
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:49,790
l don't know how to say goodbye.
l don't even want to say.

1179
01:51:50,937 --> 01:51:52,029
l hate that word.

1180
01:51:53,406 --> 01:51:55,374
Till today l've not even
understand it's meaning.

1181
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:59,840
Nothing ends and nothing begins.

1182
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:03,580
Whatever happened between us,
Sahil..

1183
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:07,577
..was.. l can't explain it.

1184
01:52:09,022 --> 01:52:10,785
l don't know how..

1185
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:13,092
..but l'm sure..

1186
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:17,921
..someday we'll reach
some conclusion..

1187
01:52:18,698 --> 01:52:20,723
..which will be enough for us.

1188
01:52:21,835 --> 01:52:23,530
Till then stay like this only.

1189
01:52:25,138 --> 01:52:27,333
Always live the moment.

1190
01:52:28,374 --> 01:52:32,242
And remember,
that no one is ever replaced.

1191
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,442
ln life,
we keep meeting new people.

1192
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:39,241
And new stories are made.

1193
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:42,020
And with each new experience..

1194
01:52:42,522 --> 01:52:46,288
..we understand things a little
more, a little better.

1195
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:49,821
Love is like summer vacation..

1196
01:52:50,563 --> 01:52:54,021
..l happens every year.
lt happens all our life.

1197
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:57,069
But every vacation has
its own charm..

1198
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:59,295
..its own intoxication.

1199
01:53:00,206 --> 01:53:02,333
And we cherish them all..

1200
01:53:03,343 --> 01:53:06,176
..just like that,
l'll always cherish you.

1201
01:53:07,413 --> 01:53:09,040
So long, stud.

1202
01:53:09,315 --> 01:53:12,148
Somewhere.. some time..

1203
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,780
..till then, cheers.

1204
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:52,720
Tomorrow we'll watch match
at your house, Pawan.

1205
01:53:52,859 --> 01:53:54,486
Why is he laughing?
- l don't know.

1206
01:53:55,028 --> 01:53:56,518
Are you bringing chips and coke?

1207
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:59,291
Fool. l gave you the money.

1208
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,328
Don't bore me now.

1209
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:04,002
Let's go tomorrow.

1210
01:54:04,103 --> 01:54:05,127
Okay.

1211
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:06,704
No, l say..

1212
01:54:26,259 --> 01:54:27,556
Come on, dude.

1213
01:54:34,934 --> 01:54:36,697
Look,
the one in shortsjust left.

1214
01:54:49,515 --> 01:54:50,482
How did she do?

1215
01:54:55,488 --> 01:54:56,978
Not like that.

1216
01:54:57,924 --> 01:54:59,118
Like this.

1217
01:55:00,927 --> 01:55:02,519
Yes.

1218
01:55:03,162 --> 01:55:05,528
Jogging. Look..

1219
01:55:15,341 --> 01:55:18,469
Forget all that.
l remembered a good joke.

1220
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:21,172
Oh no!

1221
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:53,437
''When dawn changes to dusk..''

1222
01:55:53,880 --> 01:56:00,979
''..the moonlight covers
the earth..''

1223
01:56:01,421 --> 01:56:08,418
''When dawn changes to dusk..''

1224
01:56:08,895 --> 01:56:16,028
''..the moonlight covers
the earth..''

1225
01:56:16,502 --> 01:56:23,465
''Without saying a word,
everything gets explained.''

1226
01:56:23,843 --> 01:56:31,011
''..a passion in the
heart is kindled.''

1227
01:56:31,384 --> 01:56:38,222
''..rainbow in the rain..''

1228
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:45,560
''..without getting drunk..''

1229
01:56:45,665 --> 01:56:52,662
''..why am in this condition?''

1230
01:56:53,006 --> 01:57:00,435
''Your intoxication.''

1231
01:57:00,546 --> 01:57:04,607
''Your intoxication.''

1232
01:57:08,054 --> 01:57:15,085
''Your intoxication.''

1233
01:57:15,762 --> 01:57:22,326
''..without getting drunk why
am in this condition?''
