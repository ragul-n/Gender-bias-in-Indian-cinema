Brother Kumbakarna

52
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:13,952
The one you're talking to,
is the lord of demons, Ravanan

53
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm warning not with mere mortals

54
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm warning against the Lord Supreme,
who rules the earth and the sky

55
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,200
After worshipping his 
dazzling eyes and lotus form

56
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,256
I'm warning against him

57
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:31,500
Yes, Kumbakarna

58
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,076
This is my birth's destiny

59
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,852
A fame that no one can claim

60
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,552
I await Rama's bow

61
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,852
Let his arrow
tear my heart apart

62
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,952
Let him drink my blood
and search within my heart...

63
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,206
And let him see for himself
it's the Lord name that is in there!

64
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Wow!

65
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,200
What applause!
Looks as if the stage will collapse

66
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,552
Kali, one day I too, must stand here
as the 'hero' and gather loads of claps

67
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,952
What's there in claps, brother?

68
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,952
How can you say that, man?

69
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:17,552
Brother, if you see Ravanan's tears,
would you want to clap your hands?

70
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,552
Won't you raise your
folded hands in respect and cry?

71
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,852
If these people are claping their hands,
Thay haven't seen Ravanan still

72
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,852
All they see is 'hero'
Bairava Sundaram's acting!

73
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,496
What's wrong with that?
Today, Bairava is no. 1 'hero'

74
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,852
I must become like him someday

75
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,852
Brother,our guru Swamigal is
100 times a better actor than him

76
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,852
How he would dazzle
with his dance!

77
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,852
I must act like him,
at least for one day

78
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,952
No one even needs to see my acting

79
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,252
If I know for myself that
I've arrived, that's enough.

80
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,852
Hey! What's happening here?

81
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,852
All of you come here

82
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,852
Hey, it,s time for
your 'Thirupughal' lesson.

83
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,352
If Swamigal sees this,
he will go berserk.
Come on

84
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,100
What crap!

85
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,852
Even boys playing child roles,
have no fear of me

86
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,852
What sort of life is this,Kandasamy?

87
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,852
-Palavesam
-What is it, master?

88
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,252
Why the streamer?

89
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,105
Not a streamer
It's loincloth

90
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,102
Why so many?

91
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,552
Don't I need a fresh one everyday?

92
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,852
-Hey, I've seen this cloth somewhere
-Let me see if you find out

93
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,852
Hey,why does this cloth smell of me?

94
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,152
Will your dhoti smell of you or me?

95
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,052
Hey!I only had two dhoties,
you have torn one,isn't it?

96
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,852
For sitting jobless,
is'nt one enough?

97
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,952
Hey duffer-son

98
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,152
If I don't kill you
and drop you at Swami's feet, today

99
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,952
Behold master's anger!

100
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,352
-Oh no! Swami is here
-Hey,Palavesam

101
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,952
What is this?
Runnig around with loincloth?

102
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,152
-They have torn it, Swamigal
-Were you sleeping till they tore it?

103
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,952
Not the one I was wearing
They tore the one I had put out to dry

104
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,652
Hey!
Swami is here!

105
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,500
Swami, I'm not able to control them.

106
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,352
Let's see who that is
show me

107
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,952
-Hey master
-Swami

108
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,952
They are learning their lessons well
Why talk ill of them?

109
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,252
No,they were...

110
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,952
Don't laugh, you silly fellow

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,652
-Master!
-Swami

112
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,552
Are they just cheatig in the crow?
Or they have learned the lessons well?

113
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,552
I have taught each one well

114
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,952
You ask each one individually

115
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sing properly, you fool!
I'll kill you

116
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Wonder what's going
to happen todat!

117
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,952
[Stutters first line of Thirupughal verse]

118
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,152
it's a good start
Go on

119
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,152
[Blabbers few words in the second line]

120
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,552
Go on

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,152
How many years since you joined?

122
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,952
You can't even say the first lesson

123
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,752
Get lost
Go, kneel there

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,952
-I had taught him well
-Yes I can see that!

125
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,252
'Next is him?
Thrashing Guaranteed!'

126
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,952
[Jumbles up the words of Thirupughal]

127
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,152
Donkey!

128
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,152
-Go on and kneel down
-Go!

129
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,652
- Is this what you taught them?
- I taught them well the duds!

130
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,352
Palavesam will tell it well

131
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,970
[Uses a food- related word
in the middle of solemn verse]

132
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,570
- Hey!
- Don't you want it fully?

133
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,970
You're called 'Palavesam' (many rules)
and can't even do one role.

134
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,970
He has asked me to kneel down
Don't you know that I know nothing?

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,570
Then why bring Swamigal straight here?
I'll take care of you later

136
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,470
I'll make that last dhoti
into loincloths as well

137
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,670
He was a fool even
before he joined our company

138
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,352
And he has been a fool from his birth!

139
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,970
Swamigal, I have lost faith

140
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,570
Instead of asking each one to kneel down,
ask everyone to.I will goin them too

141
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,170
Now, this is fair!

142
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,999
-Gomathi
-Swami

143
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,170
Arriving at Mount Meru
that gathers gold

144
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,270
A glittering golden cane,
you threw, my dwelling

145
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,500
The mad devourer of
everything in a vessel

146
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,470
Born with the dark, O MurugOne!

147
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,370
Brilliant!

148
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,370
At this point, instead of saying "Murugan"
Arunagiri addresses as "MurugOne"

149
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,970
Why?

150
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,370
To get the rhyme right...

151
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,770
You fool!
You cow!

152
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,970
Is it merely for the rhyme?

153
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,970
That's right Swami

154
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,570
That's why he stresses on 'O' to end
in KathiOne,MurugOne

155
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,170
MurugOne and MuthalOne

156
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll thrash you and kill you, you donkey!

157
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,170
Arunagiri wouldn't sing  without
meaning, just to rhyme

158
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,000
Murugu means beauty
KOne means king

159
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,000
Arunagiri  sings of Lord Murugan
as 'king of beauty'

160
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,000
That's it
Do you understand?

161
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,900
You're finding fault 
with Arunagirinathar haimself

162
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,200
In ' Born with the dark',

163
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,000
What does 'dark' mean?

164
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,500
'Dark' refers to 'elephant'
which means Ganrsha

165
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,000
Arunagiri says that Murugan was
born as brother to Ganesha

166
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hey, do any of you know why?

167
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Dark refers to the night Arunagiri says,
'Beyond night is the light Murugan'

168
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,000
Just as the sun comes after the dark

169
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
After the dark son Ganesha,
the fair Murugan was born, he says

170
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hey you fools!

171
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't read your lessons mindlessly

172
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Beneath each word,
a thousand meaning lie buried

173
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,400
Bring it out and relish it, you guys

174
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,900
Don't skim the surface
like a herd of cows

175
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,000
For your voice and form,
you should have become a great hero

176
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,000
Then, why did you 
become just a master?

177
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a love story, brimming
with tears, my boy

178
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go on and tell that nonsense

179
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,300
I don't know her real name
I used to call her 'Rasathi'

180
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,000
Why?

181
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I used to be like a Rasa (king)

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She, a Thi (fire)
that's why

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh my!
How he lies!

184
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In those days, in the Madurai district,
I was famous 'hero'

185
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,000
You were 'infamous' , right then?

186
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,900
-Hey!
-Let him speak, man

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Go ahead

188
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,900
In those days,
donning the role of the hero

189
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,900
If I stand tall on the stage...

190
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It will be doomed!

191
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
-Look at him
-Why?

192
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
-Alright...
-You go on

193
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,200
From a toothless granny to an unborn baby,
all would look at me, mouths open

194
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,000
How will an unborn child
look with mouth open?

195
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,863
Kali, how can you?

196
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:59,000
you are sloshed
You leave

197
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
-Go on, tell
- I won't

198
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Look at me and tell me

199
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,000
Rasathi said that she
wanted to see me act

200
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
One day, I brought her
and made her sit, right before the stage

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Just because she was sitting

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I raised my voice three
pitches high and sang

203
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
And then?

204
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,000
The guy next to me in the heroine's role,
he looked at her and she looked at him

205
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
-She looked and he looked
- Where did you look?

206
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,900
I was looking at that nonsense

207
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Then what happened?
- After the play was over, they eloped

208
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What crap!

209
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,000
Because she behaved like that,
considering it an insult to all heroes

210
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I stopped acting and choose
to be an 'master' for living

211
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,500
World of drama 
had a narrow escape!

212
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Swami!

213
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Of  late, don't you like me?

214
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,300
Am I always outside your heart?

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What are you saying?

216
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I never miss
a single word in your lesson

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,500
I train day and night

218
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,200
I never make 
even a single mistake

219
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
- Good
- But...

220
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But you don't seem
to take that into account

221
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Neither do you accord
the place it deserves

222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
In all these years,
have you praised me, a single time?

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Who said that?

224
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You will be a man 
of  fame and name'

225
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,000
-No dearth for life, wealth, knowledge
- I don't want all that

226
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Even though, I learn my art sincerely

227
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
You cast me aside like Ekalavya,
the low- born student

228
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But Kali...

229
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is kali, your preferred 'Arjuna'?

230
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hey!

231
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Don't talk like a fool

232
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do you think you both
are different to me?

233
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Everyone is like my on child

234
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't develop these disturbing
thoughts in your mind

235
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,000
Go

236
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's late
Go sleep

237
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't you have a rehearsal
early in the morning?

238
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,200
Go

239
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,200
Mother, that person is Swami

240
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Greetings, Swami

241
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,000
Who is it?
What do you want?

242
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
We come from Kazahugu Malai,
near Srivilliputhur

243
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
This is my daughter

244
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Wretched souls roaming
the streets for a bowl of rice

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Please show your mercy on us

246
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Give something 
and see them out

247
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, no!

248
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No, Swami
Look at this girl

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If I send her to do a maid's work
Will they let her live in honour?

250
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,000
'She looks like a actress
She will seduce our men!' they say

251
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So, I've decided to make her join
a drama company and brought her here

252
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,586
She sings very well

253
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It would be like Goddess
Saraswathi herself singing

254
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Swami must listen to our plea
and show us some mercy

255
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Whatever you say is right

256
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You must understand something

257
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's a 'boys' company
Young men live here

258
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,000
We don't take in girls

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
anyway, you are here
Have some food and leave

260
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
-Take care, master
- As you say, Swami

261
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
* I am a rascal lusting after
women with arrow- like eyes*

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
* A stupid, characterless scoundrel*

263
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,700
* An uneducated and completely
impoverished soul*

264
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
* A useless idiot*

265
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
* Afflicated by diseases under
the cover of my unyielding Karma*

266
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
* And lacking in honesty
Please do not ignore or discard me*

267
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
* Your holy feet bejewelled with anklets
will give me a heavenly life, one day*

268
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
*Saga Narada, praised in songs by poets
once described to you, the gyspsy girl Valli*

269
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
*You sought her company in
the forest, I warrior!*

270
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
*You, the leader, the one who
mounts the great peacock!*

271
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
*Goddess Manonmani
the Supreme Mother*

272
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
* Parvathi of sweet speech
You are her younger son*

273
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
*With groves reaching the skies,
in their shade lies this great place*

274
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:50,000
* Thiruchendur, your favorite abode,
O Great One!*

275
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Marvellous

276
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,000
It's like looking
at Goddess Saraswathi herself

277
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
May you be blessed
with name, fame and wealth

278
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But we can't have you here
If swami decides, that's final

279
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He has never ever changed his decision
Please return back

280
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
-Master!
-Swam

281
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let them be

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Why differentiate 'male' and 'female'
when it comes to art?

283
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Won't a woman
add beauty to the place?

284
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
How well you danced

285
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
What a rich voice!

286
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,000
How can I send you back?

287
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can stay in this company

288
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I will teach you, now and then

289
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
-Swami
- Be well

290
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Good things will come to your way

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
-Master, they can stay with Paavayi
- As you say. Swami

292
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Go

293
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Firecrackers have neen burst!
Drama' about to start

294
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Come soon

295
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hey, the lord's car is here!
Move aside

296
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,700
Welcome, my lord
Welcome

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Get up, every one
The lord is here

298
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
- Get up and greet him 
- greetings, my lord

299
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Welcome

300
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Greetings, my lord

301
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
My lord, please take a seat

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Greet you,princess

303
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
My lady, please take a seat

304
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Sit down, everyone

305
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
*Welcome, welcome*

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
* Greetings to everyone*

307
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
*Welcome, welcome*

308
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
* Greetings to everyone*

309
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,900
*come, take a seat!*

310
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
*Rush to get the front one!*

311
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Hey Ganesha,place a lamp in the path
It's so dark

312
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What Bairava?
You couldn't do this in the morning?

313
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Will it come to your mind
only when you are about to wear make-up?

314
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You are the lord Krishna too!

315
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Of late, toy don't seem
to be doing your job with devotion

316
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Pay attention

317
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
When the bell rings,
don't I stand promptly on the stage?

318
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
Then why is this old man shouting?

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
*Here comes, Alli!*

320
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
* She is a beauty, a great beauty*

321
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
*Here comes, Alli!*

322
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
* She is a beauty, a great beauty*

323
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
*The one with a beautiful face*

324
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
*The one with mehendi coated nails*

325
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,000
*The one with thighs
like temple pillars*

326
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,850
* The one with a flowing plait
like tree snake*

327
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
* Watching her gait*

328
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,000
* The breeze seeing that,
sweating, feels so much inferior*

329
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
*Here comes, Alli!*

330
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
*Here comes, Alli!*

331
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
* She is a beauty, a great beauty*

332
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
*Why did you call me? why?*

333
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
* My dear Arjuna, my dear friend!*

334
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
* Alli, the queen of Madurai*

335
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
*She stole my heart,
the naughty one *

336
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
* Like a lizard sticking to my heart*

337
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
* I need to rule her in bed *

338
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
* You need to help mw, Krishna*

339
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
* You need to unite us as one! *

340
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
* Don't foeget that 
I'm Bama's uncle*

341
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
* Don't forget that, you!*

342
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
* Who do I have other than you?*

343
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
* Who will help me, pray tell!*

344
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,000
* I will show you the way
Listen up*

345
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,000
* Your shoulders shall
bear wedding garlands*

346
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hey, stop it!
What is happening here?

347
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Is'nt it wrong to enslave a girl,
subdue and marry her?

348
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
If Arjuna does it,
will the wrong become right?

349
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Tell me!

350
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,000
You seem to get so angry
for enslaving a girl

351
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The British have enslaved
this land for 200 years

352
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Why don't you get angry for that?

353
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,000
Why not?

354
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,000
The anger you have,
for enslaving a mother

355
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Won't you get the same
for your motherland?

356
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Shouldn't it be the same?

357
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Sit down

358
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
* The heart is unable to bear*

359
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
* Should Mother India be
a slave to the British?*

360
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
* Should she suffer in chains 
around her hands and legs forever?*

361
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,000
* In the fire of freedom,
give your hand*

362
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,000
* Will the foreigners shoot?*

363
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
* People don't give a hoot
This is the greatest shame *

364
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
What's this?
Why 'freedom fight' songs?

365
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
* Where will this country go?*

366
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
* This place we call our home*

367
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:10,000
* The heart is unable to bear*

368
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Had you sent a word,
we all would have come there

369
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let that be

370
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,000
It's said you have to honor
a dramatist on the drama stage!

371
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
-This is 'hero' Bairava Sundaram.
-Greetings, my lord

372
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
- Your diction was very good
- Thank you so much

373
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Take this

374
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
This is Gomathi Nayagam,
who played the heroine 'Alli'

375
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Greetings, my lord

376
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
A great song
Excellent performance

377
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,500
Being a man, you have made 
a woman appear right here

378
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Take it

379
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This is Kaliyappan Bagavathar

380
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,000
Arjuna, is it?
Excellent improvisation

381
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You sang so well
It was hilarious

382
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You have a great future

383
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Here, have this

384
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,000
Father, please give him this too

385
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Why don't you give it yourself?

386
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Hey Palavesam, didn't you knock
on Ammani's door last night?

387
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh, no!

388
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
- I saw it you did!
- What if master comes to know?

389
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
What's this, Kali?
A basket with dove's feathers?

390
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Let's go search over there

391
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Hey, girls are coming!

392
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:30,800
- Bring it soon
- Where has it gone?

393
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,000
Don't they look like foreigners?
Wearing pants and shirt

394
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
- There! They have it
- Hey! that's ours

395
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
No, it isn't

396
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,000
It's in that hand

397
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,300
It's not in that hand

398
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
Will you give it or not?

399
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Listen, is your name tattooed on it?

400
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
Even if it isn't tattooed,
it is ours, give it!

401
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Hey, these are those drama guys

402
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,800
That's right
We are the drama guys

403
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,300
It's princess

404
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
- Greetings, princess
- Greetings, greetings, princess

405
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Why have you come 
to the lord's estate?

406
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Lord's estate?

407
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Just returning after having a bath
We wandered unknowingly

408
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Right?

409
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You acted so well yesterday

410
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Thank you, princess

411
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
My friends haven't seen your acting

412
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Can you act for them once?

413
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Say you want to see me act, princess
I'll act and show here

414
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,200
If your friends want to see,
ask them to come to the theatre

415
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,000
Hey show-geek, our lady
is asking, right? Do it, now

416
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,600
I'll break your teeth,
if you call me show-geek

417
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,000
Hey snub-nose, hey ugly- nose,
I'll gorge your eyes out

418
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Hey side-kick
acting so hoity-toity?

419
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Know what will happen 
if my lady wishes?

420
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,500
Your lady?
What will happen?

421
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You know what will
happen if we wish?

422
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Your lady will bacome a mommy

423
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Hey show-geek, stop it!
Why are you making a big scene?

424
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,700
Hey, can you act or not?

425
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Hey, if you give me a ring,
should I act wherever you ask me to?

426
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I can't

427
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If you want to see me play,
come to the theatre!

428
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Don't just ask me to act
wherever you see me

429
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,000
An actor has his respect and integrity

430
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,500
Come on

431
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Want to see the play,
come to the theatre!

432
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
When you do,
bring these fatsos too!

433
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
-Hey, Kali!
- You, cow!

434
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Welcome, princess
Welcome

435
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The princess is here

436
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Miss Lord is here
with hee fatso horde

437
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What to do?
Kali!

438
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
He wouldn't be expecting us
- Yes

439
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,000
Seeing us, he's going to
blink and gape

440
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
- What to do?
- We'll show them who an actor is

441
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
- Looks like it will get late
- So eager?

442
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
* Hey wild horse, 
come right before me*

443
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,000
* Hey the Madurai horse
ame right before me*

444
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,300
* Mohana, shall I
become your beau?*

445
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,500
* Shall I become a Bheema?*

446
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
*Come close for lips to touch*

447
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,600
* Hey wild horse, come right before me*
- Hey, he's singing about you

448
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
* Hey the Madurai horse
ame right before me*

449
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,000
* Mohana, shall I become your beau?*
- No, no it won't be like that

450
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
* Shall I become a Bheema?*

451
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
*Come close for lips to touch*

452
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
* A,B,C- A long an winding tongue*

453
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,700
* Don't glare at me from there *

454
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
* Hey wild horse, come right before me*

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,500
* Kitten *

458
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,600
*Goat kid*

459
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,600
*Owlet*

460
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
*Dear fawn*

461
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,500
*Calf and baby,
I'm going to tie your mouth*

462
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,000
*Hey bunny, blinking bunny*

463
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
* Right opposite to you,
is a handsome crocodile*

464
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
* A,B,C- A long an winding tongue*

465
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,600
* Don't glare at me from there *

466
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,500
* Mohana, shall I become your beau?*

467
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
* Shall I become a Bheema?*

468
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
See what all they are singing!

469
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Need to do something to him!

470
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,700
* Hey koel, a barking koel*

471
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
* The train that British sent* 
-Hey, he's insulting you!

472
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,100
* Hey wild horse

473
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,000

* Shall I become a Bheema?*

476
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
* Crackers of every color
wil fail before you*

477
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
* This is the truth as it is*

478
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
*Hey Squirrel brother!*

479
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
*What's the story here?*

480
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,900
* I understand, brother rabbit
it is very clear*

481
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
*Hey doe, drop of honey,
it's enough if you become better*

482
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,500
*Elephant calf, kitten, goat kid, calf*

483
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
*Squirrel pup,owlet, tiger cub bear
cub, colt, koel,peachick...*

484
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
*...chick, rat pup, fawn*

485
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,700
*Which kid is this kid?
Just a kid who talks too much*

486
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,700
*Lord's little kid girl kid*

487
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,000
*My dear darling kid, sugar drop*

488
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
*Give me a kiss*

489
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
To appreciate our dance and song,
have you come on to the stage?

490
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I was sent to honor you with a gift

491
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't accept any gifts'

492
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
But, I have to give it

493
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't like to receive gifts

494
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
He doesn't want it
Give it to me

495
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,700
It's to him I will give

496
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
He won't accept it
Please give it to me
521
00:34:3,100--> 00:34:31,300
It's to him, I shall give

497
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,700
- He will never take any gift
- Palavesam

498
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Give it to me!

499
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,300
They want to gift
Why are you saying no?

500
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Go on
Pin it

501
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Pin it

502
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
- Mother!
- Palavesam

503
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh no! She has stabbed me in

504
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'll kill you!

505
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
Palavesam, Will you
tease someone so much?

506
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Because she used a needle,
it stpped here

507
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Had she used a knife?

508
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Looks like you'll go give
these ideas to that girl!

509
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,400
It's all because of him

510
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Don't worry, Palavesam
I'll not rest until I take revenge on her

511
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Don't  they are people high-up
We'll leave it right here

512
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,000
She will get it
from me surely, one day

513
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
Then, he will get it
on the other side to

514
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,000
It aches even if you just say it

515
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Hey mister, how did you
get inside my room?

516
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Go!

517
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You will stab with a needle and leave
dil you think we'll watch silently?

518
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,000
If you tease me,
will I leave you? Go out

519
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
- What?
- Get out

520
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
What will you do if I don't?

521
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,000
- Go out
- Don't throw it!

522
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,000
- Am I not telling you?
- Listen to me

523
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,600
Go

524
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Go outside

525
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Hey, don't come near me!

526
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,700
Let go of me

527
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,000
Let go

528
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You are throwing things
I won't let go

529
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,800
Why did you tease me?

530
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
If we tease you,
will you stab with a needle?

531
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,000
That's what I will do

532
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Because you stabbed me,
my friend is dying there

533
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What are you going to do about that?

534
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,000
Leave me
It is anching

535
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Hey, you teased me
I stabbed your friend

536
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We are even
Go out!

537
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,000
How can that be?

538
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What about the one dying there?

539
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,000
If you want, you can
stab me with a needle too

540
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,900
How can I ... with a needle...there?

541
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It won't be right

542
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
How can I stab there?

543
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I said it unknowingly

544
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's alright!

545
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
What shall I do?

546
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,800
Then...

547
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
- You could give me a kiss
- a kiss?

548
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Palavesam is in his death bed there
If he happens to die, it's murder

549
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Murder!

550
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hey mister, why are you shouting?

551
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It is swollen like
a bun for Palavesam

552
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm just asking for a mere kiss,
as a consolation

553
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Come close

554
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,900
- Hey master
- What is it?

555
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,900
Where to?

556
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,900
Why are you squeaking like a rat?

557
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,900
Off to see Ammani, right?

558
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,800
My stomch is churning
I'm going to the toilet, you crazy nut!

559
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,700
Go!

560
00:38:34,700 --> 01:17:01,600
Just one dhoti,
please understand!

561
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,900
Here I come

562
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Hey!
Hey Vadivu!

563
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Hey, don't movie it
I'm coming there

564
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,200
Wait

565
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,500
So Vadivamba wants to
be the heroine?

566
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,900
Will you be the heroine?

567
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Here you go. Wear it all
I wait outside

568
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
*Vadivu plays the heroine today*

569
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
*Vadivu plays the heroine today*

570
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,600
Vadivu looks fantastic
as the heroine

571
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,800
Can't believe my own eyes

572
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Hey Palavesam

573
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Vadivu, why are you simply standing?
Say a few lines

574
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
She will, Palavesam
Go on dear, say a few lines

575
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,000
- Say it
- Say it Vadivu

576
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That's the respect 
you give for the costume

577
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,800
To stands before my sword

578
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
To stand fearless by my spear

579
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,800
To win over me
and to rule me forever

580
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Who is that 
prince charming, my friend?

581
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Who is that 
prince charming, my friend?

582
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
- Hey, it's Swami. Run everyone
- He's going to ask us to kneel!

583
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,000
Hey!

584
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,500
Boys, it's Swami

585
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm the crown that rules
the three worlds, Soora Badhman

586
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,600
Whoever comes, whatever illness comes,
there is no death for me

587
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
What is this? Why the change?

588
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,800
Why is Gomathi speaking
Soora Badhman's dialogue?

589
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,800
Let it happen, Swami
It's going very well

590
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,200
Where is he?

591
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,000
Look out our boys...
Performimg beautiful...

592
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Hey master, did you send word
about the rehearsal or not?

593
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,600
- I did
- Then, what?

594
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,700
'' I have seen more than 100 stages,
What is there to do different?"

595
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,800
" I'm going to do the same old thing
You handle the boys", he said

596
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,000
He said he would come
straight to the stage

597
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,000
How long has this been going on?

598
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,700
Bairava...

599
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,000
Hey, Bairava...

600
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Dil you call me?

601
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,300
Bairava, did you join my
company yesterday?

602
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Don't you know the routine?

603
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Don't you know every single actor,
big or small, must come to the rehearsal?

604
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You may be an expert...

605
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,500
Shouldn't the artists who are new
and the young ones know your cues?

606
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,700
Sholdn't they understand 
and act with you?

607
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Go on, say the lines

608
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm the crown that rules
the three worlds, Soora Badhman

609
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,200
Whoever comes, whatever illness comes,
there is no death for me

610
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,700
How can a mere mortal
shout at my fort's gates?

611
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
How degrading!

612
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,000
Singa Muga, who is he?

613
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,300
Bairava...In your dialogue delivery,
the diction is great

614
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But, the feelings...

615
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,000
Repeat it again

616
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,700
Palavesam, bring some water for him

617
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,300
Bairava, I don't have to tell you

618
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,000
Only if mind and body move
in the same stance, it is acting

619
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
If that goes in one direction
and this in another...

620
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,000
What is that to be called?

621
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I have been watching you, yes

622
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,700
In soorakkotai, we had a little issue

623
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,400
Keeping that in mind...

624
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,300
...you are humiliating me
before these kids, is it?

625
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What falt have you 
found in my acting?

626
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,400
In this entire district, is there
anyone else who can be the 'hero'?

627
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,900
I  have seen a hundred stages

628
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,700
I  have received many medals
from lords, for my acting

629
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
If a lord pins a medal,
will whatever you do become acting?

630
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,000
Only when you sharpen it again
and again, a gem will shine

631
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,600
Fathers and grandfathers of acting
have walked on this earth

632
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,300
You are mere dust,
that flies apart in sigh

633
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Hey, master

634
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,000
You need to rehearse "Soora Badhman"
10...no 100 times, with him, today

635
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,000
He acted, it seems...
A lord pinned a medal, it seems...

636
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Hey master,
come here

637
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,600
What is it, Bairava?

638
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,600
So,you are going to
rehearse 100 times,is it?

639
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
A reaharsal for me?

640
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,400
Is the audience coming
to see his historical crap?

641
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,000
They are there for my face
To see me act

642
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,000
He speaks so much,doesn't he?
Ask him to play the part

643
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,000
Even if one fellow watches that,
I'll chop off my head

644
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,000
Bairava,don't say things in haste

645
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,000
Hey...

646
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,000
For my acting,
100 women come there

647
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,000
I happened to touch one of them

648
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,000
What is wrong in that?

649
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,000
This old man is jealous

650
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,300
Don't talk about Swami like this

651
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,000
Hey...I'm telling you now
I'm leaving this company now

652
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,800
I will start my own company

653
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I will be my own king
and my minister

654
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,800
-Bairava
-Hay,are you coming, guys?

655
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,000
Are you?

656
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,800
Just for a bowl of rice,
you are sitting here, right?

657
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,800
I will give you 20 rupees

658
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,800
I will talk to Swami and
set it all right, don't act in haste

659
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
Swami?

660
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,800
Bairava...

661
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,700
- He is leaving, master... go
- Bairava!

662
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Bairava, wait!

663
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,800
There is a play today
Tickets are sold, how can you leave?

664
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,500
Ask that old man to act

665
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,000
You are talking in anger

666
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,600
We'll talk to Swami and settle it
Don't leave in haste

667
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,800
Hey, go away

668
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Listen to me, for my sake,
I'm asking you, please don't leave

669
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
- Listen, am I not asking you?
- Leave me , man

670
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,700
Let him go
Unmatchable Hero, it seems!

671
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,000
What is it? Has Bairava left
with his bag and baggage?

672
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,000
He has left, I tried to stop him
but he didn't listen

673
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,600
But  there is a play in town,
this week

674
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,800
There are plays successively
for two months in this town

675
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
- Don't know what to do
- So what?

676
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Even a stone in Bala Shanmugananda
company's backyard can act

677
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,200
Don't worry

678
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,000
Hey Gomathi...

679
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,500
Weren't you the one rehearsing
as Soora Badhman?

680
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yes, Swami

681
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,500
Say your lines

682
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,800
I'm the crown that rules
the three worlds, Soora Badhman

683
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,800
Whoever comes, whatever illness comes,
there is no death for me

684
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,500
I was born to be victorious

685
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,800
Lord Brahma hasn't penned
failure in my fate

686
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Neither has he created anyone
to defeat me

687
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,000
Today,the lords Shiva and
Perumal fear me!

688
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,800
Victory is not something
I need to celebrate

689
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,000
It's an everyday thing!

690
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Will you do it?

691
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,800
Oh,no! Me?

692
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,800
Come on, do it

693
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
- Swami!
- Come and do it

694
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,800
I'm the crown that rules
the three worlds, Soora Badhman

695
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,800
Me

696
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,800
Whoever comes, whatever illness comes,
there is no death for me

697
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
I was born to be victorious

698
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,800
Lord Brahma hasn't penned
failure in my fate

699
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,300
Neither has he created anyone
to defeat me

700
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,700
Today,the lords Shiva and
Perumal fear me!

701
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,700
Victory is not something
I need to celebrate

702
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,700
It's an everyday thing

703
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,500
- Master...
- Swami

704
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
Soora Badhman...

705
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,500
Let Kali be 'Soora Badhman'
Let Bomathi be 'Murugan'

706
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,500
- It will work out well
- It will be done, Swami

707
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,500
- Swami, bless me
- Be well

708
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,500
You will be great

709
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,500
Hey, Kali has become the hero

710
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Hey Palavesam, Swami might see
Put me down

711
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
Brother Gomathi!

712
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,500
Kali, I knew long ago
that you will be the next hero!

713
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,000
- Thanks, Palavesam
- Kali...

714
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,300
With the blessing of Sankardas Swamigal,
you've become a hero, so young! Congrats

715
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,100
Thanks, master

716
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Why am I not the hero?

717
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Tell me, Swami
Why am I not the hero?

718
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I need to know

719
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,000
Logic, is it?

720
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,800
Go on...go, do your work

721
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,000
That small kid will become a hero
I should remain a side-actor, is it?

722
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,500
I put my heart and soul and made
Soora Badhman stand before your eyes

723
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,300
Did you not like it?

724
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,200
Soora Badhman is a demon
He will talk like a demon

725
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That's what I did

726
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,600
But he...

727
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,000
What did he do better than me?
Tell me, Swami

728
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Like a bridled horse, you were
walking on the same old path

729
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,800
When everyone thought.,
this is how Soora Badhman will be...

730
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,846
Didn't he do something
totally new?

731
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,300
That is improvisation

732
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,800
I can't be explaining everything

733
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
You need to fell it at times

734
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Why are you looking 
at me like that?

735
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,700
You acted so brilliantly today

736
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,500
Thank you, princess
Thank you

737
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Seeing you act, I wanted to hug
and kiss you, right on the stage

738
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,000
- I couldn't
- That's alright

739
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,500
You may kiss me know

740
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,000
First, the gift
Then, the kiss

741
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,700
- A gift?
- Yes

742
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,700
- God!
- Don't shout

743
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,900
- You scaredy- cat!
- I'm not scared

744
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,500
Thank you, princess
Thank you

745
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,000
That...?

746
00:53:12,500 --> 01:45:26,000
* Hey...*

747
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
* Hey Mister Minor,
why do you look at me?*

748
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,500
* You want to make 
my nights a torture*

749
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,500
* You seem to tie anklets 
to the legs of the wind that flows*

750
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,500
* You seem to shake hands
with love and pull it close*

751
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,500
* Hey Mister Minor,
why do you look at me?*

752
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,500
* You want to make 
my nights a torture*

753
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,500
* You seem to tie anklets 
to the legs of the wind that flows*

754
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,500
* You seem to shake hands
with love and pull it close*

755
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,500
* You seem to
make me your admirer*

756
00:53:52,000 --> 01:47:37,000
* You seem to increase your beauty
a hundred times, everyday*

757
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,500
* When I think evil eyes may fall...*

758
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:03,200
* Staying in my heart, you smile*

759
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,500
* Hey Mister Minor,
why do you look at me?*

760
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,500
* You want to make 
my nights a torture*

761
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,700
* You seem to tie anklets 
to the legs of the wind that flows*

762
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
* You seem to shake hands
with love and pull it close*

763
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,700
Duryodhana, I come to tear
your heart and drink its blood

764
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,000
The deception I see in your eyes
is sharping my arrows

765
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Thank you, princess

766
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
She is the Radha of all
the Radhas in Brindhavanam

767
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,500
This Krishna's Radha too

768
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:49,300
* Desires seem to come
knocking at your heart*

769
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
*Tries to dress you up*

770
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
* To speak, words stand
begging at the heart's door*

771
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
* To speak, wht don't
you lend your mouth?*

772
00:55:00,800 --> 01:49:05,300
*Dreams are opening their eyelids*

773
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,300
* Nights are raining on the lips*

774
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,000
* A dewdrop is breaking
a flower apart*

775
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
* As you and I come close,
time leaps away*

776
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,400
* Hey Mister Minor,
why do you look at me?*

777
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,800
* You want to make 
my nights a torture*

778
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,800
* You seem to tie anklets 
to the legs of the wind that flows*

779
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,800
* You seem to shake hands
with love and pull it close*

780
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,000
* You seem to
make me your admirer*

781
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,500
* You seem to increase your beauty
a hundred times, everyday*

782
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,800
* When I think evil eyes may fall...*

783
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,500
* Staying in my heart, you smile*

784
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
* Something seems
to tickle me and leave*

785
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,300
* Seems to tear my cheeks apart
and throw it to the wind*

786
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,600
* The cheek seems to ask
for alms of kisses*

787
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
*Give me your lips*

788
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,300
* For the first time,
passion spreads*

789
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,300
* All the moments are
orchards in her grasp*

790
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
* When gaps decrease,
it's the juice of the lips*

791
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,500
* When eyes falter down,
you lie there down below*

792
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,600
* You seem to
make me your admirer*

793
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,600
* You seem to increase your beauty
a hundred times, everyday*

794
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,600
* When I think evil eyes may fall...*

795
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,600
* Staying in my heart, you smile*

796
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,600
* Hey Mister Minor,
why do you look at me?*

797
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,600
* You want to make 
my nights a torture*

798
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
* You seem to tie anklets 
to the legs of the wind that flows*

799
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,600
* You seem to shake hands
with love and pull it close*

800
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,300
Kali had told me that he was in love
with the lord's daughter

801
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,500
That night, I happened to
eake up by chance

802
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,400
- Hey, Kali!
- Rangamma

803
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,000
Maybe the cat's on prowl

804
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's not the cat, Swami

805
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,800
It's me

806
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,700
What are you doing here,
at this hour?

807
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,400
Your honour mustn't be
shipped off, right?

808
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,000
-That's why
-What?

809
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,600
If anyone else had seen
what I saw this night...

810
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,600
...not a single person will be alive
in this company, tomorrow

811
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,600
What is that great thing you saw?

812
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,400
Didn't you make 
that beggar-boy, a hero?

813
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,000
That dog is now
licking the lord's bowl

814
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You need this, Swami

815
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You need it

816
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,000
You won't care about
people with discipline and integrity

817
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You will suffer

818
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,000
Even beyond this, too

819
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,800
Why, Swami?
Why at this hour?

820
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,700
Where is Kali?

821
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,000
Kali must be sleeping

822
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,800
Go wake him up

823
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,500
Go

824
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Hey, master, what has happened?

825
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,500
I have searched all over
Kali is missing

826
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Is he at the whore's
or at the liquor store?

827
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,600
Can't  you keep
watch on everyone?

828
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Is this why I've had you here,
all these years?

829
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,800
Like a temple!

830
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,500
I had kept my company like a temple

831
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,300
You have made it all, a waste

832
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,700
Let him come

833
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
He has to come this way, right?

834
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,800
Let me sit right here
Let me sit here till dawn

835
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,000
Let that dog come

836
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,700
Hey, bring that chair

837
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,400
What, Swami? Started lessons
so early in the morning?

838
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,100
Let's do ' Kutrala Kuravanji' today

839
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,400
- Hay, Gomathi
- Hey!

840
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,100
From where, is sir heading back?

841
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I woke up early to go to the river
The Vishnu temple is open now

842
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,300
All night, I was waiting without
a blink, for you to come

843
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,000
Where did you crap?
Which river did you wash yourself?

844
01:01:32,800 --> 02:03:05,500
Swami?

845
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,600
Which whore's place,
are you returning from?

846
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Beneath whose feet, were you lying?

847
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,700
Tell me

848
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,000
Tell me now

849
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,300
Did you lay hands on the lord's girl?

850
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Did you?

851
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Do you accept it?

852
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You know how much I trusted you?

853
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
You have brought shame upon me

854
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,800
I should kill you!

855
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You, womanizer!

856
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,400
We both are in love
with each other, Swami

857
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,600
Lo Love?
In love, is it?

858
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
What is that you have
to do there at night?

859
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Why go there at night?

860
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,300
Hey, do you think she fell for you?
She fell for the part you were playing!

861
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Using that...

862
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:31,000
You have indulged
in lustful revelry with here, right?

863
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,100
Is it for this?

864
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
If the lord knows this,
he will kill you!

865
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:40,000
He will kill me
He will kill everyone

866
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Swami, stop...enough
He is the child you brought up

867
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,000
Swami!

868
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,000
Don't, Swami!
Swami!

869
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Ask him to leave
He must not stand before me!

870
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Hey, I'm going to curse him

871
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
His mouth shall say no lines

872
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
His legs will not touch the stage

873
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
No makeup will adorn his face

874
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It is a curse
It's Swami's curse

875
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It's your teacher's curse

876
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Swami!

877
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,600
Swami!

878
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Master, tell him something

879
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,600
Swami...!

880
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,600
Swami, forgive me

881
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,600
Please forgive me!
Don't curse me, please!

882
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,000
I don't know anything other than acting

883
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,600
If I don't act, I will die

884
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,600
I will do whatever you ask me

885
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,800
Please don't chase me away

886
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,800
Please let me be here

887
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,000
Swami, let me be 
 a dog near your feet

888
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,800
- Please don't ask me to leave
- Master!

889
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
With a fire as a witness

890
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:54,800
Ask him to promise that
he won't see that girl or think of her

891
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,400
Yes, Swami

892
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,700
Gomathi, come!

893
01:04:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Oh no, Swami!

894
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Even if you promise,
a curse is a curse

895
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,000
Let this dog lick its bowl
and remain a housejold help

896
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
- Master!
- Swami

897
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Pack all the bags
We leave this town, now

898
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,700
Brother!

899
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,800
Swami,which is going to be 
the first play in this town?

900
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,300
Let's perform 'Pavala Kodi'

901
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,300
Who will be the hero?

902
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Hero?

903
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Ask Gomathi to play the part

904
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Heroine?

905
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,000
Let Vadivu do it

906
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,300
It will be good
Let's bring in a new change and see

907
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,800
This is what I was in penance
for all these years

908
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,000
So I'm very happy

909
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,700
Bless me, Swami

910
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,000
Let Goddess Saraswathi's
blessing be upon you

911
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,300
- Swami
- Be well

912
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,500
Perform boldly, dear

913
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,800
* Warm welcome to all...*

914
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,300
*Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!*

915
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,800
You thief, who came in the night?
Tell me, who are you?

916
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,200
I'm Arjuna

917
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,600
How come?

918
01:07:08,700 --> 01:08:03,300
How come you have
added new lines to the script?

919
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,000
Look at my eyes

920
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,600
You will see 
the flames of love blazing

921
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,400
Didn't you understand
this dialogue, Vadivu?

922
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Tell me, Vadivu

923
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,600
I need to know 
what's in your mind

924
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Kali!

925
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
What is it?

926
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
The lord's daughter is dead

927
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
- What are you saying?
- That's true. I came right away

928
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,800
Talks were finalized to get het
married to a lord from the south

929
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,600
She was stubbornly
refusing to marry him

930
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
They locked her in the house
Thrashed her, asking why

931
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,600
She jumped off a cliff and died

932
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Thay talk that she was pergnant too

933
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,600
Rangamma

934
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,000
- Swami!
- Kali

935
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,600
- Come outside, Swami!
- Kali, no!

936
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,000
- Come outside!
- Kali, don't shout

937
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,700
Go away!

938
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,000
Swami...

939
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,000
Come outside, Swami

940
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,000
What's the commotion here?

941
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,700
I'm going to die

942
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm going to die right now

943
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,000
- Are you drunk?
- Yes

944
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,700
Hey, drag him away from here

945
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:17,000
You have killed 
my Ranggama, so unjustly

946
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
You have killed my dearest, Swami!

947
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
With a child in her womb,
she jumped off a cliff

948
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
The child in her womb was mine

949
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
You have killed an unborn child

950
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,500
You spoke of justice,
like some great person

951
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:53,000
Did you think about the girl,
who trusted me?

952
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
If you can't think of that,
then how can you be a 'Swami'?

953
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
Tell me!

954
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,600
Listening to you,for the sake
of acting, I left Rangamma

955
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,000
I killed my Rangamma myself

956
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I killed my dearest myself

957
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,300
Should only the teacher curse?

958
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,300
I will curse the teacher himself

959
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,300
- You will be doomed
- Kali, what are you saying?

960
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,700
Don't, Kali

961
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
You will be in ruins

962
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:44,000
The tongue that sang of Saraswathi
and Ganapathi will cease to be!

963
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I promise you this!

964
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,300
You will be in ruins!

965
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,600
You will be doomed!

966
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
You will be doomed!

967
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,600
My Rangamma will not
let you be in peace

968
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,000
My Rangamma is dead

969
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,000
Rangamma!

970
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,000
Swami!

971
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Hey, lift him up!

972
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
- Careful...gently
- Make him lie down

973
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
- Wave the fan
- Swami!

974
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Swami?

975
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,600
Swami, what has happened to you?

976
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Open your eyes

977
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I have made my teacher
come to this state

978
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,500
Curse me, Swami
I will be in doom

979
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,000
Curse me, Swami

980
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
You will be graet

981
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Master

982
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,600
I've got an offer to perform plays
in 15 places in Colombo

983
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So, going forward I've decided
to run this company

984
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,700
Whoever wants to
come with me,can!

985
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,800
We have nowhere else to go!

986
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
You are everything to us hereafter

987
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Everyone can come

988
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,600
Everyone

989
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,800
Good

990
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,800
But not Kali

991
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,300
Why, brother?

992
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,500
Why this punishment for me?

993
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,200
I too shall come with you

994
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,000
You are the one who 
killed our Swami

995
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,500
This is the company he created

996
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,500
If you are here, it will be doomed

997
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Just go away

998
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,700
Swami forgave Kali and blessed him

999
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,600
Why all that?

1000
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,300
Swami is my God

1001
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,000
The one who caused his death,
I can't have by my side

1002
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,200
Even if Swami forgives, I can't

1003
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
Why talk this way?
Kali is like your younger brother

1004
01:14:59,600 --> 02:29:15,100
He must go

1005
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,000
Else, I will leave this company

1006
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:08,100
Brother

1007
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,000
When I come to know
of Rangamma's death

1008
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,000
I lost my senses

1009
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,200
I didn't know what to do

1010
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That's why I shouted
at Swami, in anger

1011
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,600
Hey, if you are a man of respect,
you should have married her

1012
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,700
You should have gone away somewhere!

1013
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
What are you saying, brother?

1014
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,700
Just because Swami
asked me to, I left her

1015
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,400
Shut up!

1016
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,000
Because Swami said so,
you left her like a coward, isn't it?

1017
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,800
Swami is not the reason
for her death, it's you

1018
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Gomathi!

1019
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Who are you
raising your hand against?

1020
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,000
Why did you give her a child
and come away?

1021
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
You dog!

1022
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You killed her

1023
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,600
Then blaming Swami for that
you killed him too

1024
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Call yourself a man?
You rascal!

1025
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Go on and mind your business

1026
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,600
Supporting this fellow!

1027
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
You have hit me, haven't you?

1028
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
You have hit me and and
thrown me away, is it?

1029
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,500
What did I do?

1030
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,600
You are drunk
and trying to hit me!

1031
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,600
He has already
suffered for his mistakes

1032
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Don't thrash him

1033
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,500
Let me go
I'll kill him

1034
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Gomathi, let him go

1035
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,600
Where will he go?
Who is he?

1036
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Let him go anywhere
He must not be here

1037
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
If I see you before by eyes,
I will kill you, you dog!

1038
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,100
Please forgive him 
and take him back

1039
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,000
You come to a decision
Do you want him or me?

1040
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,700
Only if both of you are there,
it will be good

1041
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That won't happen

1042
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,000
If he is there in this company,
I will be off

1043
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,200
What Gomathi said is true

1044
01:16:48,700 --> 02:32:53,700
I'm the person who killed my Guru

1045
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,200
That sin won't let me be in peace

1046
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,500
If I'm here, it will all be doomed

1047
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,000
Let brother Gomathi
be here, I will go

1048
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I will go away somewhere

1049
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,700
Let this company prosper

1050
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Forgive me

1051
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,500
I will go away

1052
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,000
Hey, all of you listen well

1053
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,600
If anyone wants to leave with him

1054
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,600
Now leave right now

1057
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,000
Hey Gomathi... 

1058
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,600
You have arrived!

1059
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,000
'Empreor od Performing Arts'
The 'hero' Gomathi Nayagam!

1060
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
The world famous leading man

1061
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,000
So what if you have
achieved all this?

1062
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,500
Bur, Vadivu isn't yours

1063
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,600
Vadivu

1064
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:356,000
Vadivu

1065
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,600

after five years'

Praise be to Mother India!

'Freedom fight' groups seem
more active than before

1071
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,600
Ever since Mahatma Gandhi came to Madurai,
even farmers are now waving flags

1072

On behalf of Tamil Arts Association
and Madurai Performing Artists

1073
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,600
We felicitate 'Hero'
Melasevalpuri Gomathi Nayagam Pillai

1074
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,000
'Singing Sensation' Vadivambal

1075
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,600
In a huge stage set in Madurai

1076
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,000
With sets and sceneries, we must
stage a fantastic historical play

1077
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,200
We have a great troupe

1078
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
No surprise about that!

1079
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,200
We need fine artists to paint the screens
and skilled men to assemble the stage

1080
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
All of Madurai is in my palm
It will be an ace job!

1081
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
How is 'Hero'
Bairava Sundaram doing?

1082
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,000
He was acting for a while

1083
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Drinking too much drinking
He lost everything, drinking

1084
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Then...

1085
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,600
What about the
'hero' Kaliyappa Bagavathar?

1086
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,600
Kaliyappa?
There's no one by that name

1087
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
There is an oldie named 'Kandappa'
A clown, can't even see properly

1088
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,000
No...

1089
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:13,000
'Thalaiva Kottai' Kaliyappa Bagavathar
Sivadas Swamigal's direct disciple

1090
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,000
In this entire Madurai district,
if someone was performing as the 'hero'

1091
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,000
He can't exist without this
Karaikudi Kanayya's knowledge

1092
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,600
I swear that there is
no such person here

1093
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,600
If it's someone 
close to you, just tell me

1094
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,000
I'll search high and low, find him
and bring him over in my Plymouth

1095
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
That won't be necessary

1096
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I asked just like that

1097
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Okay

1098
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,700
Palavesam,did you 
inqire about Kaliyappa?

1099
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,000
I inquired in the area
where our drama folks live

1100
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Nobody seems to
know anything, Vadivu

1101
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,000
They say there's
no one by that name

1102
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,000
I can hear wedding bells
for you, already

1103
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Hey, be quiet, brother!

1104
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,700
Shall I talk to Vadivu?

1105
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,200
Why are you still heisitating?

1106
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,200
No

1107
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I don't know 
what's in Vadivu's mind

1108
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
In 5 years,
she hasn't said a word

1109
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,500
Maybe he is still in her heart

1110
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Now, it looks like
he doesn't even exist

1111
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Even she doesn't have any other go

1112
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,500
Shall I talk to Vadivu
and make her agree?

1113
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
The whole town is buzzing about the play
which sir and Vadivu are to perform in

1114
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,600
All the tickets are sold out 
Houseful for 8 days

1115
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Going to be great business all year
We'll have a feast tonight

1116
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Greetings, sir

1117
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Has sir left to
a temple or something?

1118
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
He's lying down
A bit fever

1119
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,000
What?
Fever?

1120
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,500
This is some kind of poison flu
Fever will surely be threre for 5 days

1121
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,600
You need  a lot of rest to recover

1122
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,200
I'll see you later

1123
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
- Greetings, doctor
- Greetings

1124
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,000
What has happened?
I saw you yesterday

1125
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,400
You were fine

1126
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Ftom last night,
fever, vomiting and headache

1127
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Careful

1128
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,300
My whole body is throbbing with pain

1129
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
What to do?

1130
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,400
It's 'Houseful'
The play must happen

1131
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Sir, we don't have an option

1132
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,400
You are unwell

1133
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,000
Doctor has asked you 
to take rest too

1134
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,000
We'll stop the show for 10 days

1135
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,700
Hey, are you playing the fool?

1136
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's festival time

1137
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
If we don't stage the play,
they will burn the theater

1138
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,000
Not only that

1139
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,500
Theater rent for 10 days,
all the advertising cost

1140
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,000
How will I account for all that?

1141
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,000
If the first ting flunks,
who will lend money again?

1142
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,600
Listen, if sir is unwell,
how can we stage the play?

1143
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,600
So the play won't happen today?

1144
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,500
No way

1145
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Hey show geeks,

1146
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,000
I don't care what you do,
how you do

1147
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,700
But the show must happen today

1148
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,700
I'm staging it with loan money

1149
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,700
Like you, haven't got it
from Singapore in cartloads

1150
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,000
Why are you shouting like this?
Should we dance naked for you?

1151
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
If you are a showman,
You must dance naked too

1152
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,600
Didn't you get the money?
Didn't eat off it?

1153
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Didn't you go the whore house's
in red street?

1154
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Hey, master
You don't know about me

1155
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Leave him, right now!

1156
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,500
Don't fight

1157
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Hey, you'll get the money
and won't put the show?

1158
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,000
We will!
We will put the show!

1159
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,600
Not fearing you
But for the sake of my name!
986
01:25:0,500-->01:25:03,00
That's better
Else, you'll be in big trouble

1160
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,500
The show will happen tonight
Get ready

1161
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
What's this?

1162
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,500
Fearing him, you've said
the show will go on

1163
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,000
You are unwell, how will you
perform in this condition?

1164
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
Sir, may I say something?

1165
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,400
What is it?

1166
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,800
Why don't we find
some 'special' dramatist?

1167
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,000
When will get them?
It's festival time too

1168
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,600
Even if we find them,
they must know 'Karna's heaven' fully

1169
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,800
All that's being performed
are Shankara Swamigal's plays

1170
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
All these 'special' actors
know every play by heart

1171
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
They will come directly to the stage
and perform the part beautifully

1172
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,000
Master, give the painter some money

1173
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,000
Hey, bring two men before noon

1174
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,600
Yes, sir

1175
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,500
Here you go

1176
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Bring good ones

1177
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Welcome, please come

1178
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,500
Welcome, greetings
Welcome, please go inside

1179
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Welcome, please be seated

1180
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,000
Sir...sir?

1181
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Drink a bit of the concoction
Then only the fever will break

1182
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,300
Two 3rd class ticket please

1183
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,500
Welcome...welcome

1184
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,500
Greetings to the honourable police officer

1185
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,700
The most important official
in the entire district, you've come here

1186
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
What's this?

1187
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,000
Stunning advertisements
Brought someone from Colombo too

1188
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,000
Smuggling money,is it?

1189
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,500
Sir, don't you know about me?

1190
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
From my grandfather and father's days,
staging plays has been our job

1191
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I hardly make anything out of it

1192
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Hey, what about
the ' Singing Sensation' Vadivambal?

1193
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,500
Oh my! She will be
like a golden statue

1194
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
The lords from all around
are waiting to have one look from her

1195
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Do you want to see to?
Some on I'll show you

1196
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
What has happened?

1197
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,600
Is the person here?

1198
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,000
No one there in
'Make up' street, it seems

1199
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,800
Festival time, everyone has left
to perform elsewhere

1200
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
He has gone to Virudupatti
Ha has promised to surely bring someone

1201
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,400
If someone doesn't come,
I can only hang myself

1202
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,000
Hey, start the play!

1203
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,000
- You shouldn't trust these drama folks
- How long to wait?

1204
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Will they start the play or not?

1205
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,600
Hey!
Ready?

1206
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,500
Sir, isn't it time for the play?
Why haven't you still worn the makeup?

1207
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,000
Many landlord and officials
are waiting out there

1208
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Crowds surging
What to do if he lies like this?

1209
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Just wait for 10 minutes,please

1210
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
What?

1211
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:37,000
The play was supposed to start at 7
It's 7:30, what are you going to do?

1212
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,500
- Just wait a little bit
- Hey, master!

1213
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:43,000
I don't care what you do
In 10 minutes, I should hera the bell

1214
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,000
Else, it will be a bloodbath here!

1215
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,300
Let's go

1216
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I will perform myself

1217
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Sir!

1218
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,500
That man who went to Virudupatti
will surely bring someone

1219
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,300
Just take rest

1220
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
He's here

1221
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
He has brought a person
Goddess Meenakshi hasn't forsaken us

1222
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Greetings

1223
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,800
Not a place I missed.
Madurai, Sivagangai, Virudupatti

1224
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,500
I've brought this one from
Srivilliputhur, he's a 'special' actor

1225
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
But because of his bad habit,
no one invites him to act

1226
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,600
I thought it's just for a day
and brought him along

1227
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Will he act?

1228
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
He will act

1229
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,000
Manage somehow today
Tomorrow I will bring you the best

1230
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,600
Tell him to come

1231
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Hey, come inside, man

1232
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,700
Kali!

1233
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It is Kali!

1234
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,400
Brother Gomathi

1235
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,500
Master sir

1236
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,400
Palavesam

1237
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,600
Is it our troupe?

1238
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:30,500
Is it really you, brother?

1239
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,600
He didn't day it was you

1240
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Are you well?

1241
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Why do you have medicine
on your forehead?

1242
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Are you unwell?

1243
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,600
Such a high fever?

1244
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,000
A fever?

1245
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,000
How do you feel?
Have you had your medicine?

1246
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,500
What ,master sir?

1247
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,500
I've had it. It's nothing much
It's just a fever

1248
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
But, why have you become like this?

1249
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,700
I'm bird that missed its flock

1250
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I didn't know where to go

1251
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,400
I shouldn't blame anyone

1252
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:13,700
It's all my fault

1253
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
It's my fault

1254
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:23,000
A woman's curse and a teacher's curse
surrounded me and doomed me

1255
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I became like a beggar

1256
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
A beggar

1257
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,500
I didn't die

1258
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,200
That's all

1259
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,500
Brother, I've seen you all, today

1260
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,300
I'm very happy

1261
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,300
This is enough for me

1262
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,800
What play is it, brother?

1263
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,300
I saw it outside
'Karna's heaven', isn't it?

1264
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
We'll do a great job

1265
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,200
Who am I?

1266
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,500
Karna or Arjuna?
Tell me, brother

1267
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,000
Ask them to ring the bell, Palavesam
I will be ready in 5 minutes

1268
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,600
I will get ready in 5 minutes, master

1269
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,200
Brother

1270
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,200
I'm asking you like I ask Swami

1271
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,600
Don't chase me away, again

1272
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,800
Let me be here, please

1273
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Let me be a slipper
beneath your feet

1274
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,200
What's this?
Why hasn't the bell been rung?

1275
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,400
Tell them to ring the bell, brother

1276
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,000
Please don't chase me away

1277
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,500
Palavesam. go ring the bell

1278
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,000
Get the clow on the stage too
Go on, guys

1279
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,600
Go wear
Karna's costume, go on

1280
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,000
-Master!
- Sir

1281
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,000
I will wear Karna's costume

1282
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:53,000
Let Kali be Arjuna

1283
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,000
Sir, how can that be?

1284
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,500
You can't even stand up
How will you say your dialogues?

1285
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
If you could have done it
why ask him to be brought?

1286
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,000
Hey, do as I say

1287
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,600
You are so unwell
How willl you do it, brother?

1288
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,000
When you can act

1289
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,600
Why can't I?

1290
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,200
It's been a long time now

1291
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,200
Since we both acted together

1292
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,500
We'll se today

1293
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Greetings to the audience

1294
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:42,500
My mother
My mother who bore me!

1295
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Where are you?

1296
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,200
Instead of giving bearth to me
and throwing me into the river

1297
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,200
You could have killed me
and thrown me into the river

1298
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,500
Had you killed me
as soon as I was born

1299
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I wouldn't have had to bear
so much shame today

1300
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,000
Ask whatever you may want, mother

1301
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:04,000
I will grant it, without a 'nay'

1302
01:33:07,700 --> 03:05:17,700
Vadivu, how are you?

1303
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I never thought I would see you 

1304
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,300
How are you?

1305
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,500
Mmm...I'm doing fine today

1306
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,500
Even though I had a mother,
I became an orphan

1307
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,300
Even though I had the crown
before me, I became a slave

1308
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Even though I had brothers,
I became a lone man

1309
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,000
I decided to give my life
for the man who trusted me

1310
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,600
What is this fate, O God?

1311
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,500
What is this fate, O God?

1312
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,000
Wow

1313
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,000
Brother is performing so well

1314
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I didn't  think brother would act
so well, with such a high fever

1315
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,300
He has brought Karna 
right before our eyes

1316
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
I will never forsake Duriyodhana

1317
01:34:02,000 --> 03:07:06,000
Kaliyappa took to drink
and killed his art

1318
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
But our man Gomathi

1319
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,600
He has swam through fire and water
and has held Goddess  Saraswathi's hand 

1320
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
He is excellence himself

1321
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,000
My dearest! Have you
left me and gone away?

1322
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
As far as I know, in 'Karna's heaven',
after Karna's dead, story ends

1323
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,400
He is starting at the end

1324
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
*Tell me!*

1325
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,600
*Tell me the final judgement!*

1326
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,700
*Stand upright*

1327
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,700
*Stand upright,here in this war!*

1328
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,700
*Leave!*

1329
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,700
*Let this war and leave!*

1330
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,000
*If you want any more lives,*
*kill me first*

1331
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:24,700
*Krishan, kill me first!*

1332
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,700
*Why did you *
*make me bear the bow?*

1333
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,700
*Why did you make me*
*swim in blood?*

1334
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,700
*Why did you make *
*this world to win?*

1335
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,700
* Why did you *
*defeat me, deep inside?*

1336
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
*You made me win the world*

1337
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,500
*You defeated me, deep inside*

1338
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,400
*Arjuna asks, Krishna!*

1339
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,500
*It is Arjuna asking!*

1340
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,700
*Tell me!*

1341
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,700
*Tell me the final judgement!*

1342
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,700
*Stand upright!*

1343
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
*Stand upright, here in this war!*

1344
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
*You have the wheel of time*
*in your hand*

1345
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
*But it is me*
*who is spinning in that*

1346
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
* The net of deception*
*expands in your eyes*

1347
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
*But the one caught*
*in it, is me!*

1348
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:40,000
*If the sin of killing Karna,*
*goes to Krishna*

1349
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,000
*Where will the sin,*
*of making Krishna, go?*

1350
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:51,800
*Tell me!*

1351
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
*Tell me the final judgement!*

1352
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
*Stand upright!*

1353
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
*Stand upright, here in this war!*

1354
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
*O World*

1355
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
*What is the need for war?*

1356
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,000
*O Lives*

1357
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,000
*What is the need for blood?*

1358
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
*O God*

1359
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
*What is the need for sorrow?*

1360
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
*O Heart*

1361
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:41,000
*What is the need for hatred?*

1362
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,000
*Krishna, stop the chariot!*

1363
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
*Defeating everything*

1364
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,500
*Who to live with?*

1365
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:02,000
*Stop the chariot!*

1366
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
*Let the bloodbath end*

1367
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,500
*Stop the war!*

1368
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
*For tomorrow's world to prosper*

1369
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:26,000
*Stop the war!*

1370
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,500
Sir, Sivadas Swamigal,
Behold your disciple

1371
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,000
Swami, you are not dead!

1372
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
You should have listened
when asked to rest

1373
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:33,000
Yesterday, you were so stubborn
that you should be on the stage

1374
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,500
You danced all night

1375
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,700
You definitely must
take rest for 10 days

1376
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,800
Please leave

1377
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I need to jab an injection
in his buttocks

1378
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,500
Jab wherever but make him better

1379
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,600
Brother, you did 
a fantastic show last night

1380
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,600
Master, will the show happen today?

1381
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,600
It will

1382
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,600
How many ever oppose me

1383
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I will not rest
until I sever his head

1384
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,000
Your ego and stubbornness
will make your army fail

1385
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,500
A wretched woman, I am,
who has lost everything

1386
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Lost my homw, lost my town,
and lost my country

1387
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Because he shouldn't be the 'hero'
for a single day, you went on stage

1388
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,700
For 10 days now, he is the 'hero'
What could you do?

1389
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,500
To the honourable Kaliyappa Bagavathar,
I offer the cash money as a garland

1390
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Following this, for Vadivambal

1391
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,600
They have been stopped
calling us 'Colombo group'

1392
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,200
They are calling us ' Kali group'

1393
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,000
Have this

1394
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:08,000
Ever since I started out as the 'heroine',
I was waiting eagerly to act with you

1395
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
That has happened only now

1396
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,000
Won't you say 
anything about my acting?

1397
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,800
I have travelled the world
and received titles too

1398
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,700
But, what I want to know
is what you think of my acting

1399
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,700
You are beautiful,
Isn't that enough?

1400
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Why?
Don't you like my acting?

1401
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,500
Don't ,Vadivu
Leave it

1402
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Here I'm asking you
and you are leaving silently?

1403
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
When I see you on stage, I want to stop
the play and give you a few tight slaps

1404
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,600
Do you think
what you do there, is acting?

1405
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,800
Decking yourself up
and gyrating?

1406
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,500
Disgusting!

1407
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:02,500
Lauding the 'hero'
Kaliyappa Bagavathar...

1408
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I offer this gift

1409
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,000
Behold the ship with our flag!

1410
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,000
Behold the ship with our flag!

1411
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Freedom!

1412
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:29,700
Victory to Mother India!

1413
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,000
Victory to Mahatma Gandhi!

1414
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:43,000
Praise be to Mother India!

1415
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Hey, take him away

1416
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Lauding the 'hero'
Kaliyappa Bagavathar...

1417
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,600
I offer this gift

1418
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,600
For the gift you gave on stage,
here's the gift!

1419
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,000
Thanks, sir

1420
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,500
We must oppose the British
We must lead the people

1421
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Brothers, he is the best dramatist
in this entire districrt

1422
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
He is Kaliyappa Bagavathar
Madurai Sivadas Swamigal's direct disciple

1423
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,400
Your acting is excellent
We have seen you perform, a few times

1424
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Thank you

1425
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:05,700
How long will dramatists like you,
perform historic plays and fool the people?

1426
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,700
What is the state of this nation today?

1427
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,600
For 200 years, sitting on our heads,
the British have been ruling us

1428
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
In the North, there is a revolt
in every corner, but here

1429
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,600
Shouldn't they have
a bit of shame at least?

1430
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,400
What should we do?

1431
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,000
Your plays must change

1432
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,800
You must change.
Perform 'freedom fight' plays

1433
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
We are all here with you

1434
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,800
The plays you perform must make
the blood of everyone boil

1435
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
It must instigate
the fervour for freedom

1436
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,600
I'm making arrangements for your bail

1437
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,000
We'll know in a few days

1438
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,500
Brother, I met some
freedom fighters here

1439
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,800
They made me understand
the state of our nation

1440
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,600
Let's perform 'freedom fight' plays

1441
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,600
- 'Freedom fight' plays?
- Yes

1442
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:05,000
Why?

1443
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Is it not enough that you are in jail?

1444
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Do we need to put
the entire company in jail?

1445
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,200
It's not that, brother

1446
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,700
Because no one questions them,
the British are doing such atrocities

1447
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Through plays, we must instigate fervour

1448
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,400
Hey!

1449
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,000
If you have any such tought

1450
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:21,000
Don't even come
near my company again

1451
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,000
Let this be the last time I see you

1452
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
'Freedom fight' plays, it seems

1453
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:34,700
Don't worry, brother
Very soon, we'll be released

1454
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
We shall perform 'freedom fight' plays

1455
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,700
- What do you say, Ilandeva?
- Definitely, sir

1456
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,700
- Let's start a new drama company
- For sure

1457
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,000
What shall we name it?

1458
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,600
- Swadeshi Drama
- Bharat Drama Company

1459
01:45:44,700 --> 01:47:31,700
Fantastic...excellent
Let it be so named

1460
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:03,500
Vadivu

1461
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,700
You were fantastic in today's play

1462
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Excellent

1463
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,500
Our company is profiting these days

1464
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,500
You get 100 rupees daily

1465
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,500
I'm planning to increase it
to 200 rupees

1466
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
That's good
Please talk to mother about it

1467
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,500
Ok
And...

1468
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,700
It seems master
had a word with you

1469
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Tell me, Vadivu

1470
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,200
When shall we get married?

1471
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Why marry?

1472
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
It's to make
a contract out of it, isn't it?

1473
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,200
Then, you are also afraid that
might leave with Kali,Isn't it why?

1474
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,500
- Do you know what are you talking?
- Yes, I know

1475
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:53,700
I know you well

1476
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,000
I have been observing you,
right from Swami's house

1477
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,700
What you will think, what you will say,
I know everything

1478
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,700
Then, before asking 
mt hand in marriage

1479
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
You talk about increasing my salary

1480
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,100
Why?

1481
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,700
If you mention 'money',
will I just come and fall in your lap?

1482
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,400
Who am I, in your mind?

1483
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
A whore

1484
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,500
Daughter of Ammani,
the whore, isn't it all?

1485
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
No, Vadivu

1486
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I never thought that way

1487
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:23,100
I said

1488
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:25,700
I said I wanted to marry you

1489
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:30,000
Rather than being a married whore,
it is better to remain just a whore

1490
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,200
I don't want this

1491
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I'm a slave to Kali's song
A slave to his skill

1492
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:37,500
If he comes and snap his fingers,enough.
I will follow him like a dog

1493
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
That's what I'm waiting for

1494
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,300
What are you saying, Vadivu?

1495
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
They have arrested him

1496
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,000
He can not get out, in this life time

1497
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,000
Who said so?
Are you the government?

1498
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,700
He will be released

1499
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:52,700
I will wait for 
the day he's released

1500
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
WE both can not act together
Settle my accounts tomorrow

1501
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,700
You can't leave
when you want, Vadivu

1502
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:12,000
You have signed a 15 year contract
saying you will act with me

1503
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,000
If you go, will I let be?

1504
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,700
I will inform the police
and put you behind the bars

1505
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,500
Are you trying to threaten me?

1506
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,200
The police will
put me in jail, isn't it?

1507
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,200
It's alright
I will remain by my Kali's side

1508
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Why, Vadivu?

1509
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,700
Won't you understand at all?

1510
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Kali, Kali, Kali!

1511
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,200
All the time, it's Kali
In everything, it's Kali

1512
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,600
What has he ever done for you?

1513
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,500
You, who was once a beggar girl,
who made you 'Singing Sensation' Vadivu?

1514
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:59,500
Malaysia, Singapore, Colombo,
taking you to all the places I went

1515
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:03,000
Didn't I make every place
echo your name?

1516
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:03,700
Why?

1517
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Why, Vadivu?

1518
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,700
Because I loved you so much

1519
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I'm a millionaire today

1520
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
If you marry me,
I'll make you a queen

1521
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:21,000
But, you...

1522
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,500
Why don't you like me?

1523
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:26,000
Tell me, vadivu

1524
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,500
Why don't you like me?
I need to know

1525
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,500
Life is not about living like a queen

1526
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,000
Life is about living
with the one you love

1527
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,000
Don't compelme any further
Just leave me

1528
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:20,000
*Should Mother India be*
*a slave to the British*

1529
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:27,000
*Should dhe suffer in chains*
*around her hand and legs forever?*

1530
01:49:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
*In the fire of freedom,*
*give your hand*

1531
01:50:30,700 --> 03:40:03,200
*Will the foreigners shoot?*

1532
01:50:33,000 --> 03:40:08,700
*People don't give a hoot*

1533
01:50:36,000 --> 03:40:14,500
*This is the greatest shame*

1534
01:50:46,600 --> 03:40:34,100
Right there

1535
01:50:57,700 --> 03:40:55,900
Come, Vadivu

1536
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I have left from there

1537
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Told him, 'I can't act
with you anymore'

1538
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I have come here

1539
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Mother wants me
to be a lord's mistress

1540
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,000
He is compelling me to marry

1541
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,300
I didn't know what to do

1542
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I can't

1543
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,600
Im'begging you with folded hands
Please save me

1544
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,000
Give me a place near you

1545
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,500
I will always be with you

1546
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,600
Don't want me to act,
I will remain a cook

1547
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:43,000
Vadivu

1548
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,200
Already, there is a load of sin
on my shoulders

1549
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,700
Don't compel it

1550
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,500
Even after I have said so much,
your heart doesn't relent to take me in

1551
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:57,600
You think I'm a disgraced soul

1552
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:01,000
Don't kill me with your words

1553
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I can't

1554
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:04,600
I can't now

1555
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,700
I will leave now

1556
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,500
But, I will not act anymore

1557
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,200
Until you heart relents
and calls me,I will not act

1558
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:14,500
This is a promise

1559
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:18,200
I will not act
It is for you that I wait

1560
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,500
Victory to Mother India!

1561
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,500
Praise be to Mother India!

1562
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:49,000
' Kali grew like a forest fire
in all directions'

1563
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,500
' As he was growing,
I was dying'

1564
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
'Looking at the deserted theater,
I felt ashamed'

1565
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,600
'I just wanted to hang myself'

1566
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,500
Payasam, Palavesam
and others have joined Kali's group

1567
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,300
A few others have gone to bioscope

1568
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:18,200
Let them go

1569
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Let everyone go

1570
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,200
Whoever leaves as the lone man,
this Gomathi Nayagam will perform

1571
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:27,000
Why?

1572
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Leave if you want to

1573
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I'm not here, trusting in anyone

1574
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:33,500
I'm here, trusting only me

1575
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,200
I will perform the plays, on my own

1576
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:39,400
Just on my own

1577
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,000
Thanks
We'll meet tomorrow

1578
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,500
The rehearsal starts tomorrow

1579
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I'll inform everyone

1580
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,000
Kali

1581
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,500
What is it?

1582
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,600
Vadivu has sent it

1583
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:00,700
To my beloved, honourable sir

1584
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:04,700
Vadivu writes with sincere greetings

1585
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:07,800
You did not accept me

1586
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,500
I don't even have the fortune
of being a cook to you

1587
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:16,500
That's all I deserve

1588
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
No use in being upset with you

1589
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,600
If you so desire,
you can do something about it

1590
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,600
*Like a voice in an empty theater,*
 *you are within me*

1591
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,700
*From somewhere,*
*you seem to pull my strings*

1592
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,600
*Yours,*
*Your heart*

1593
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:16,500
*What shall I tell my heart,*
*which is seeking you everyday?*

1594
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:23,000
*Without listening to a word I say,*
*it keeps searching for you*

1595
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:30,000
*Like a voice in an empty theater,*
 *you are within me*

1596
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
*From somewhere,*
*you seem to pull my strings*

1597
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,600
*Yours,*
*Your heart*

1598
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,500
*A world made of music*

1599
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:02,700
*Only you and I shall dwell there*

1600
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
*A home made of dreams*

1601
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:10,000
*Only we will live there, real*

1602
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
*Those were the beautiful times*

1603
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,500
*The times when I was in your lap*

1604
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,500
*Using the stairs called lips*
*it stepped into my heart*

1605
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,500
*Love love love*

1606
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
*In an empty theater*

1607
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:38,000
*Like a voice in an empty theater,*
 *you are within me*

1608
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,500
*From somewhere,*
*you seem to pull my strings*

1609
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:45,500
*Yours,*
*Your heart*

1610
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:53,000
*What shall I tell my heart,*
*which is seeking you everyday?*

1611
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:00,000
*Without listening to a word I say,*
*it keeps searching for you*

1612
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,500
*In an empty theater*

1613
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Praise be to Mother India!

1614
01:56:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Burn clothes from foreign soil!

1615
01:56:17,000 --> 01:57:18,600
Praise be to Mother India!

1616
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,600
*I don't need words to talk*

1617
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,700
*Just if we see, that will do*

1618
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:05,000
*Should this singing nightingale*  
*be a lone bird?*

1619
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,400
*You were the one who turned me*
*into a sculpture and worshipped me*

1620
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:18,600
*Why do you want turn me*
*into a stone again? Tell me!*

1621
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,400
*Like a voice in an empty theater,*
 *you are within me*

1622
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
*From somewhere,*
*you seem to pull my strings*

1623
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
*Yours,*
*Your heart*

1624
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:40,000
*What shall I tell my heart,*
*which is seeking you everyday?*

1625
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
*Without listening to a word I say,*
*it keeps searching for you*

1626
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
We stand by Mahatma Gandhi

1627
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,600
The revolt will not cease
until we get freedom

1628
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,200
It will continue

1629
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Even if I can't be a good son,
I wish to be a good citizen

1630
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,200
If I fall, I shall become a seed

1631
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,700
Welcome

1632
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:58,000
Hey!

1633
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:00,000
If I summon you, won't you come?

1634
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,700
You were the one
who wanted to see me

1635
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:04,600
To be fair

1636
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:07,500
You should come and see me

1637
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,000
- Sit down
- I'm not here to sit down

1638
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,700
- Come to the police station
- Do you have a warrant?

1639
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
You show-geek!

1640
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:14,700
Talknig law, is it?

1641
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,000
Yes, it's the law

1642
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:20,000
To follow you for no reason,
I'm not a criminal

1643
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,000
You are charged with treason

1644
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,000
Treason?

1645
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,500
Tis is my land, my country

1646
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:29,800
If we question,
does it become treason?

1647
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Treason is what you are doing

1648
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:36,000
Self- rule and freedom is round the corner.
You will get your punishment then

1649
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,000
Hey, shut up!

1650
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:40,700
Who do you think
you are talking with?

1651
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,300
I will shoot down, the whole lot

1652
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,500
If you happen
to talk or sing on stage

1653
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:49,200
Even your body can't be
found for the last rites

1654
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Mr Nanjunda Rao
Just a minute

1655
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,500
Come August 10th, we are
performing a 'freedom fight' play

1656
01:59:58,500 --> 01:59:59,600
' The victory of Kathar'

1657
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Pleaes do come with your family

1658
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:03,800
We can give you a free pass

1659
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,700
Hey!

1660
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,000
I will come with a warrant
to shoot you down

1661
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,500
Praise be to Mother India!

1662
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Hey, the time now is 7

1663
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:21,000
Only 13 tickets have been 
sold on the wole

1664
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:23,800
11 rupees, 3 and 1/4 ana, 2 paisa

1665
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Do you know that I have spent
8500 for this theater alone?

1666
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:31,000
Are you playing the fool?

1667
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Where is he?

1668
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:38,000
The 'Singing god' Melasevalpurai
Gomathi Nayagam Pillai!

1669
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:39,600
My foot!

1670
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:47,500
He can't even draw 4 persons to theater,
why does he need a moustache and a bun?

1671
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Where is he?
Gomathi Nayagam...

1672
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,600
I have not made any money

1673
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Only 13 tickets
have been sold, that's why

1674
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:00,600
What did you say?

1675
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,500
An actor is such a low being, is it?

1676
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,800
Get out

1677
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:09,500
Leave
Go, right now

1678
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
You have hit me, haven't you?

1679
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:15,000
I used to be a way-side robber

1680
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I could pull your gut out
and wear it like a garland

1681
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,500
But, what the hell...

1682
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,000
...You appear as
Lord Krishna to me

1683
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,500
-Get out, you man
- I will

1684
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:31,000
If people don't come to the theater,
for the money I've put in, I can only beg!

1685
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:35,000
Show me a way for my money,
I'll get going

1686
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,200
Sir, what's this?

1687
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:47,600
Will this be enough, brother?
No?

1688
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,200
Oh, no!

1689
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,600
The gold medals I received
acting all over the world

1690
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,700
Throw it at that dog's face

1691
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:03,600
Go, brother
Let it be done with

1692
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,600
- Sir...?
- Go, brother

1693
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
We have searched all over town.
Not a single girl is willing to act

1694
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,300
That Rao has terrorized everyone

1695
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,000
How can we stage this play?

1696
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
A man could do the role

1697
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:40,700
But it will be good
only if a woman does it

1698
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:42,700
There is a way

1699
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I thought I shouldn't do it
But, I have to do it for the nation

1700
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,400
Palavesam, please bring Vadivu,
saying I called her

1701
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Hey, have you decided
to go with that Kali?

1702
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:59,000
Listen to me, if you go with him,
you'll end up eating gruel in the prison

1703
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,000
It seems prison gruel tates good

1704
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:04,000
If you leave,
don't ever come back again

1705
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I'm done with you

1706
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,000
I don't want a mother
who sends me off with a lord

1707
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I'm done with you too

1708
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,500
- Come, Palavesam
- Let's go, Vadivu

1709
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,800
I knew you will call me someday

1710
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
That's what I was waiting for,
all these days

1711
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:27,400
It's a 'freedom fight' play

1712
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,700
- There may be police...
- Whatever it is, it's fine

1713
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:31,800
It's enough if I act with you

1714
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
No fear...No fear at all!

1715
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:40,000
Even if the skies
fall upon our heads...

1716
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
No fear...No fear at all!

1717
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:48,000
Victory to Mother India!

1718
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,000
Come, Vadivu

1719
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Did I act well today?

1720
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
You were beautiful, as always

1721
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,700
But, with all this beauty,
acting was holding hands

1722
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,600
You acted so well today, Vadivu

1723
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,600
The fervour in your
voice and acting...

1724
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
...beyond a point, going against me,
I started admiring you

1725
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Today...

1726
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,800
...you stood like a fire on stage

1727
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,200
I thought then

1728
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I want a son like you

1729
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,600
Art should become a child in my womb,
and live generation after generation

1730
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:52,100
Will you accept me?

1731
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:53,000
Brother...

1732
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:11,000
It is a great grief for an artist
to lose everything, brother

1733
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,600
You could have told me

1734
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Wouldn't I have
stood by your side?

1735
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:50,000
When maser told me,
I felt very sad

1736
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,600
That's why I went and redeemed
everything from Kannayya

1737
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Take this, brother

1738
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,100
What are you thinking?

1739
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,500
Shouldn't I do even this for you?

1740
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:39,800
Won't you stand by me,
for something tomorrow?

1741
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,300
If you don't mind,
I'll tell you something

1742
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,500
Come and join my company

1743
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
You can be the 'hero'

1744
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:01,000
I will be the 'heroine'
or 'side-part'

1745
02:07:02,000 --> 04:13:07,500
Like we were in Swami's compay,
we will all be happy again

1746
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Come, brother

1747
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:12,500
Don't think so much
Do come, brother

1748
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:17,000
Alright, Kali

1749
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:20,200
I will act

1750
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:59,500
Kali, we just got word

1751
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:02,600
They have banned our play,
'Bhagat Singh'

1752
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,000
If you disobey the order and act,
they have got a shooting order too

1753
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:08,300
- What are you saying?
- That's right, Vadivu

1754
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,600
They have made a complaint
to the collecter...

1755
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:14,000
...that Kali and his group are
inciting revolt through their plays

1756
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,600
So, he has issued a shooting order

1757
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,000
Even if we lose our lives,
we'll stage the play

1758
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:21,800
Let the people know...

1759
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,000
...That we don't have the right
to speak our truth in our land

1760
02:09:15,800 --> 04:17:32,400
I'm scared

1761
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Don't be scared, Vadivu

1762
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,700
Bhagat Singh is
a great warrior of our nation

1763
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,500
You should not hang him
without a thought

1764
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Bhagat Singh! Who is he?

1765
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,400
Is he a lord or God?

1766
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
This is the last day

1767
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,700
This is not a hang rope

1768
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:58,700
It's a reward offered to me,
for the service to my nation

1769
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:01,700
Do not say that
Bhagat Singh perished!

1770
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,700
Say that he attained a brave heaven!

1771
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Praise be to Mother India!

1772
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
It's the police!

1773
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:36,500
Praise be to Mother India!

1774
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Hey...All of you disperse

1775
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,500
You are staging a play
against rules

1776
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I have shooting order too

1777
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,600
Hey, better surrender

1778
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,700
Or else, I will shoot you down

1779
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Come on
Shoot me, you traitor

1780
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,700
Let the rope of foreigner
decorate Bhagat Singh's neck

1781
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:04,000
Let the bullet of foreigner's
servant decorate Bhagat Singh's chest

1782
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Shoot me, you dog

1783
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Praise be to Mother India!

1784
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,600
Hey, arrest him and drag him out

1785
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:13,700
Praise be to Mother India!

1786
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:18,000
We will not let you
to arrest Kaliyappa!

1787
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Don't hit the police
Let them do their duty

1788
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
We will not let you
to arrest Kaliyappa!

1789
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
They are here to arrest me
Let them do that

1790
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:06,300
Please stop it!

1791
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
We will not let you
to arrest Kaliyappa!

1792
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:20,000
Kaliyappa, you need
to live for drama

1793
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Don't become a prey to a bullet

1794
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
- Escape from here
- Let's go

1795
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:24,600
Come, Kali
You come

1796
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:30,700
All of you run away
and save your lives

1797
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,600
- Run away... run
- Kali, escape somehow

1798
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Run away...!

1799
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Hey Kali, don't run!
I'll shoot you

1800
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,200
Hey Vadivu, where are you going?

1801
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,700
I don't know what's happened to him
I need to see him now

1802
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:08,600
Hey, why are you talking like a fool?
There's police all around us

1803
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:10,000
If they see anyone of us,
they will shoot us

1804
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:13,000
It's alright
I need to know now

1805
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,600
Won't you understand at all?

1806
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:19,700
Alright, you wait inside that temple
I will go and find out

1807
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:23,600
Go, Vadivu
Go hide inside the temple

1808
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:29,000
Hey, wait!

1809
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Hey, don't run!
Wait!

1810
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:03,700
Vadivu!

1811
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:11,000
They have shot our Kali, Vadivu!

1812
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,500
Kali!

1813
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:20,000
Vadivu!

1814
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,700
What a great artist!

1815
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:08,700
Can there ever be
another like him?

1816
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:11,600
Why have you left us, Kali?

1817
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Kali can not be destroyed

1818
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
He is living here
He will be born again

1819
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,700
I will pray to Goddess Meenakshi

1820
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Ask the one who is to perform
the rite to come sit here

1821
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:38,700
Go, sit down

1822
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,600
- Me?
- Yes, it should be you

1823
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,100
I can't do it, master

1824
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,000
Someone else 
please go sit down

1825
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:53,000
Kali thought of you as his own brother
Isn't Kali your younger brother?

1826
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,700
You should be the one to do it

1827
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:57,300
Come, it is you
who must do it

1828
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:59,000
What are you saying? I can't...

1829
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
One of you sit down

1830
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,800
Don't say no
Only you have the right to do it

1831
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,000
Please come

1832
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Please sit down

1833
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,700
- How did you...?
- Why did you come here, brother?

1834
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:41,200
There'e police all around
Should we both get caught?

1835
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:42,800
Where's Vadivu?

1836
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:44,800
Vadivu is safe

1837
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Hearing gunfire all around,
she was worried about you

1838
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:50,800
She wanted to see you immediately

1839
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
That's why I made her
to wait safely and came here

1840
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:56,100
Nothing will happen to me
I will escape somehow

1841
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,800
Brother, you come along with
Vadivu to Samanallur Rail bridge

1842
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,800
I will come there too
Let's get on board a good train

1843
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,800
We can reach Pondicherry silently

1844
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
British policemen can'r do
anything, if we get there

1845
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Go carefully, this side
I will go the other way

1846
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:10,500
Praise be to Mother India!

1847
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:40,800
What's this brother?

1848
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:52,600
Hey, Kali...

1849
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:57,300
I can't do it anymore

1850
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:00,800
I can not act as
a good man anymore

1851
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:05,000
When I look at you,
I'm filled with mad rage

1852
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:07,300
What is this, brother?

1853
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Hey...

1854
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:15,000
You, without deserving it, even a bit,
will keep winning forever

1855
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:19,000
Me, in spite of
deserving it every bit...

1856
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:21,600
...should I keep failing
before you, all my life?

1857
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:24,200
What are you saying, brother?

1858
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
What great acting skill
do you have?

1859
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,800
Giving my heart and soul,
I stand there as Soora Badhman

1860
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:35,000
That old man
makes you the 'hero'

1861
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
You will be the 'hero'...

1862
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,600
...and I should be
a side-part, is it?

1863
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:43,200
Should I?

1864
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Hey, in 'Karna's heaven'.
how can Arjuna have a song?

1865
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,200
You will sing some somg of your own
and get all the applause

1866
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:02,800
I can't... bear it

1867
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:08,800
Why did you start staging
'freedom fight' plays and destroy my plays?

1868
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
It's because of you

1869
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,100
It's only because of you...

1870
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,100
...I was completely broken
and lost everything

1871
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:21,200
Let that be...

1872
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:25,000
You recovered everything
that I had lost...

1873
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:28,000
...and gave it back as alms to me

1874
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:30,800
For that...

1875
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,800
Just for that, I should kill you

1876
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,200
You were a mere playboy

1877
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:41,600
But, me...

1878
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:45,700
Was I like that?

1879
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:47,600
Hey...

1880
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:50,800
Vadivu...

1881
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,600
I loved her so much

1882
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:58,400
But, she...

1883
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
She threw me aside
and walked out, wanting only you

1884
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:07,600
Forgive me, Kali

1885
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:10,200
Forgive me

1886
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
But...

1887
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:17,600
Only if you die,
my anger will subside

1888
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,000
After that, it doesn't matter
if I live or if I die...

1889
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,200
...I will be at peace

1890
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:30,000
I promise you,
I will be at peace

1891
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,500
I understand how much pain
you have been going through

1892
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:39,800
I will die

1893
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I'm going to die anyhow

1894
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,700
I will say something before I die

1895
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,700
I have no enmity
towards you, even now

1896
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,100
I have no hatred too

1897
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:57,600
To tell the truth...

1898
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,500
...You are still my
elder brother in my heart

1899
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,500
You are my everything, brother

1900
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,200
Hey... don't talk

1901
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:14,200
Don't talk, Kali

1902
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:16,000
From a very young age...

1903
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,600
Because I competed with
such a great actor like you...

1904
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:22,600
I have come to this stage

1905
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:27,500
Day and night, 
it is you I thought of

1906
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I was competing with you

1907
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:34,500
That's why...

1908
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:39,000
Even when you
thought harm for me...

1909
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,700
I thought it was all for good

1910
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:43,600
What did you say?

1911
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,800
I'm a playboy, is it?

1912
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:56,000
The only person that I loved
in my life, my Rangamma

1913
02:22:57,800 --> 02:23:00,500
It was you who separated
Rnagamma and ma

1914
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:03,900
What are you saying?

1915
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
i had told no one but you
that I loved Rangamma

1916
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:11,000
If you didn't tell him,
how could Swami know of it?

1917
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:14,700
That is...

1918
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:17,000
If you had not
sent me to jail that day...

1919
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I wouldn't have joined
that freedom fight

1920
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:26,800
I know that you sent that person

1921
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,700
This name...This fame...
These titles!

1922
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
This life!

1923
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,700
All these were alms
that my elder brother gave me

1924
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:41,000
Thank you

1925
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:42,800
I say it with all my heart

1926
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:46,100
Thank you

1927
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Kali...

1928
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Shoot me, brother
Let it end, why do you hesitate?

1929
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Kali, leave it

1930
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,700
You'll be happy
if you shoot me, isn't it?

1931
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
- Kali, leave it
- Shoot me, brother

1932
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,000
- I'm telling you, leave it!
- Shoot me, brothr

1933
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
No, let go of it

1934
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
- Shoot me, brother!
- No, Kali!

1935
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,700
Shoot me, brother!

1936
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:38,000
Hey!

1937
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
[Varanasi]

1938
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:53,500
Brother Gomathi!

1939
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Kali...
