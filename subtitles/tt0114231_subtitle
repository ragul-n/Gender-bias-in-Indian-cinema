1
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,535
- Get one ticket.
- Right.

2
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,602
- Get me some eggs.
- Okay.

3
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,568
In a minute.

4
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,902
Why does everybody
call you Footpath?

5
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:36,470
- Because I was found there.
- But you must have a name.

6
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,701
I'll ask the bread vendor.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,901
Tell me one thing.

8
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,568
- Did you hurt anyone today?
- No.

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,502
Here, eat this.

10
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,068
Now ask what you want to know.

11
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,000
What's my name?

12
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,873
- Ram jaane (God knows).
- Great!

13
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,100
To hell with all of you!

14
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,935
Now even I have a name!

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,436
- I've got my name!
- What is it?

16
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,901
- Coming to a film?
- Got the dough?

17
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,134
I just cleared that guy's dues.

18
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:11,069
- So?
- Stealing. Come on.

19
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,434
There's Bela! I'm off!

20
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,001
Heroine! Let's take in a film.

21
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,601
I go to school. I'm not
useless like you. Footpath!

22
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:24,569
- I told you my name is Ram.
- Let go off my hair!

23
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,800
First say my name.

24
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,401
- I won't!
_ you won't? _ No!

25
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:38,404
Il I don't avenge this,
my name is not Bela!

26
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,534
What's the matter?

27
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,669
You were screaming
now you're laughing?

28
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:51,371
Look at your lace. Hall cream
hall clean. What's the politics?

29
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,801
I like Bela a lot.

30
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,402
- I also like her.
- Don't you dare look at her!

31
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:11,001
I've asked my God for her!

32
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,267
What the...!

33
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:34,400
Run!

34
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:07,235
Help me!

35
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:48,306
Caught you! Rascal!

36
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,902
Who was with you?

37
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,068
Answer me! Rascal!

38
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,303
Have mercy on your bones.
Tell me where he is!

39
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,134
Open your mouth, pig!

40
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:19,269
What the...! You spat on me!

41
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,535
I won't spare you alive!

42
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:32,700
What happened to you?

43
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,269
Bela will laugh out loud
when she sees me in this shape.

44
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,967
But what is all this?

45
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,468
My breakfast. They beat you here.

46
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,435
- They beat you so much!
- They asked for your name.

47
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,702
- I didn't tell them.
- You should have.

48
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,768
Why did you take this
thrashing for me?

49
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:58,305
This is my style.
Live and die with pride.

50
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,704
Why did Ram Jaane get
thrashed for my sake?

51
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,637
Giving pleasure to others
gives a lot of happiness.

52
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,402
Is that why you give us
free bread?

53
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:18,537
No, my son. I get love
from you in return.

54
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:25,038
Those who get love from
others are very lucky.

55
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,736
Then Ram Jaane is very lucky.

56
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,301
God knows.

57
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,435
This is Banu Technicolor.

58
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,201
He ran away from the remand home.

59
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:46,337
Now he travels in cabs and
smokes imported cigarettes.

60
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,034
He's made a lot of money!

61
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,468
- Why doesn't anyone catch him?
- Who wants to die?

62
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,735
- Sameerdada will tear him apart!
- Who is he?

63
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,267
Banu's boss.

64
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,169
He's very dangerous.
Haven't you heard of him?

65
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:01,500
How did he run away?

66
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:07,970
Move behind!

67
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,902
Released from the remand home?

68
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,468
I don't get released. I escape.

69
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,834
What il the police catch you again?

70
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,203
I know how to escape them.
You tell me, what's all this?

71
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,868
The bread man enrolled me in school.

72
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,734
- With Bela?
- She has gone.

73
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,869
- Where?
- To a hostel.

74
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,101
- Why?
- He is alone.

75
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,768
He couldn't look after her well.

76
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:10,636
She will stay in the hostel,
study and become a memsaheb.

77
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,935
Then he'll mary her
off to some rich man.

78
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:17,101
I'll become rich and show them!

79
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:18,633
How?

80
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,668
Is he your lather to give you work?

81
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,268
Then is he your lather
to give you work?

82
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,234
I liked the boy's answer.

83
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,334
It will do for me.

84
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,969
Take him with you from tomorrow.

85
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:55,104
- Yes?
- Your lace is mud!

86
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:04,138
Once again my Amar, Akbar
Anthony has sullied your lace!

87
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,736
I have your goods worth 20 crores.

88
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,068
Will you buy it for 10?

89
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,401
This bastard Mirchi will...!

90
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:22,304
Is he too hot for you?
Tell me. Finish!

91
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,336
You talk too much!
What's your name?

92
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:35,603
My name is Ram Jaane.

93
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,938
Tell your boss Mirchi
his time is finish!

94
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,270
Like this damn lighter!

95
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,536
What are you watching?
Throw me a match!

96
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:04,137
I asked for a match and
you're giving me a bullet!

97
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,469
I have 2 things to tell you.

98
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,868
I don't like chilies.

99
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:16,271
Il you touch my boss' goods
now I'll sort you all out.

100
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:18,634
- Give me a match.
- Sure.

101
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,905
This is a cutout. Where is he?

102
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,769
I'm here. Look!

103
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:38,202
I was only firing at the gun.

104
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:42,036
I missed my aim.

105
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,334
Your men are no good.

106
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,534
The sound of a bullet scares them.

107
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,669
Tell them I'm very bad.

108
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,469
Il anyone moves, I'll mow him down!

109
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,568
I said, don't move!

110
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,003
How many men will I kill?
I won't kill any more.

111
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:10,137
Tell your men not to...
Spoilt my clothes!

112
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,838
Il anyone acts smart with me,
I'll chop them up!

113
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,136
Didn't I say...? Rascal!

114
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,934
Where are you running?

115
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,435
All your men are finished.

116
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,834
You're left alone but don't worry.

117
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:36,002
I'll talk to you of love.

118
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,503
Do you watch films?
Who is your favorite hero?

119
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:47,570
Saved!

120
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,102
Don't kill me!

121
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,869
Saved again!

122
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,801
Your name is Amar.

123
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,404
You can't die. Go.
I free you for your name.

124
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,335
Go away.

125
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,367
Got hurt?

126
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,036
You can't get hurt.
Your name is Amar.

127
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:15,601
Where are Akbar and Anthony?

128
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,036
I won't tell them you told me.

129
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,235
You can keep this stuff too.

130
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:26,236
I'll say that I took it.
You be happy, so will I.

131
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,635
- Say yes.
- Yes.

132
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,935
Must be Amar.

133
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,035
Something fishy. He's alone.

134
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,701
Ram Jaane is behind.

135
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,735
Akbar and Anthony are finished.

136
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,968
Your name is Amar.
You cannot die.

137
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,502
My cigarette won't light up today.

138
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,735
Don't lear. Light the cigarette.

139
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,534
Light it.

140
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,502
It is very harmful to the body.

141
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,303
It goes into the body and
makes noise and man is...!

142
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,968
Finished!

143
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:29,169
From today I'm the number one
star in the world of crime.

144
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:31,801
Nobody to compete with me.

145
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:37,404
- That Mirchi is for name sake...
- Only for a lew days.

146
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,203
I've found the plot to buy him in!

147
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,437
I'm not worried with you around.

148
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,902
Where is Technicolor?

149
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:55,435
Putting a little color in his glass.

150
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:59,302
Why are you hiding yourself?

151
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,538
Give the cash I gave you
yesterday to Ram Jaane.

152
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,537
The fishermen area is yours now.

153
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:22,137
- Who?
- Me. Mirchi.

154
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:28,004
- Mirchi on the line.
- Ask him what he wants.

155
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,403
What's the matter?
Finding it too hot?

156
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,403
A chili never feels hot.

157
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,337
Only the sick eat food without chili

158
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,969
Add chili together il you
want the taste of life.

159
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:50,536
- I'm ready for a compromise.
- He's ready for compromise.

160
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,000
- Shall I refuse?
- Why?

161
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,835
He's not worth making friends.

162
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,368
But he's not even worth
turning into an enemy!

163
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,170
He's right. Give me the line.

164
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:09,136
How do I ly you?

165
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,902
In the pan or the cooker?

166
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,269
To hell with his...!

167
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,536
Did you come here for this?

168
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,034
I came to say I...

169
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,802
I'm ready to be partner!

170
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,669
But I want one crore
and a cut in the business.

171
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,535
What do you think I am?

172
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:59,338
I'll put a rod through you
and roast you in this lire!

173
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:03,102
The days of eating kababs
and becoming Don have gone.

174
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I don't know what blood I have
that still retains its' color.

175
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,034
Talk like a man.

176
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,901
But I won't spare Ram Jaane!

177
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,368
Why? He's not bad.

178
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,503
He's saved my life many times
but you know business better.

179
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,967
You know or God.

180
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:37,904
What? Attack by him?

181
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,401
Mirchi will kill him?

182
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,433
Make him Technicolor.

183
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,803
You're playing a danger game.

184
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,871
You said you would search each other.

185
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,536
To check il anyone has arms.

186
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,401
Then how will Mirchi have a gun?

187
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:11,536
What is that?

188
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:07,470
We finished them all!

189
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,906
You wouldn't have cried so much
when you entered this world...

190
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:20,936
As much as you'll cy at leaving it.

191
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,201
I won't spare you!

192
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,668
Why did you kill him?

193
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:33,404
You'll cy for this!

194
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,136
You'll make me cy?

195
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:51,704
Have you forgotten the
power of my bones so soon?

196
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:59,169
Did you think you'd escape my hands?

197
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:07,336
Finished! Your bones are finished!

198
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,835
They have grown soft.

199
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,906
Have mercy on your bones because
now my bones are very tough!

200
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,901
See.

201
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,300
Finished!

202
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,434
Your bones are soft!

203
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,570
Pig head! You lind my bones soft!

204
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:36,670
Il I don't break your bones,
I'm not worthy of my name!

205
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,736
Finished! Soft bones!

206
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:01,501
Are you tired?

207
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:09,102
Why are you calling your death?

208
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:13,702
- Finished!
- You are finished!

209
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,636
- Finished!
- What the...!

210
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,768
He wants to be finished!

211
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,770
Take him away!

212
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:02,771
He said, my bones are soft!

213
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:34,238
What's all this?

214
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:38,169
Il Bela sees me like this...

215
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,604
You don't even know her.

216
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,836
You can't be bailed out.

217
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:55,268
I know. I talked to the lamer.

218
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:59,669
He says il I become a state witness..

219
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,636
I'll be released in 2 or 3 years.

220
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,868
Take it.

221
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:12,134
- I have one request.
- What?

222
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:16,567
Save me.

223
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,837
- Why?
- I'll settle you outside.

224
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,669
When you return you'll get cooked meat

225
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,335
Othe_ise the enemies
will take away the honey.

226
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,568
And we'll be eating bones!

227
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,535
How will you run the business?

228
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,368
- Sameer's...
- That is mine!

229
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,671
It is yours. I'll return it
to you with interest later.

230
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,001
It's time for the jailer to come.

231
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:02,006
I know you're very sly!

232
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:06,235
But il you act smart with me...

233
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:10,935
You'll make me Technicolor.

234
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,669
I know it.

235
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,837
The government nabbed goods worth
crores because of Ram Jaane's help.

236
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,702
As a result the court
takes a lenient view...

237
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:33,403
And sentences him to 4 years
of rigorous imprisonment.

238
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:28,139
What the...! Open their file.

239
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:41,870
This is Murli.

240
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:47,104
The organizer of Apnaghar.
We've written about him in our paper.

241
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:52,437
But you wouldn't have written that
under the guise of housing orphans..

242
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:56,669
He has made a house for himself.

243
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,137
The land that he has taken
over and guards like a snake..

244
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,735
That land is worth crores.

245
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,303
I've arrested these boys
for hooliganism so many times.

246
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,135
But he always frees them.

247
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,070
So that the car of his
life travels smoothly.

248
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,768
I ask you one question.

249
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:24,537
When you can't reform this gang
why don't you close down shop?

250
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:30,002
Who doesn't know him?

251
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:34,235
He has been accused of
corruption so many times.

252
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:38,837
But each time he did something
and managed to get away.

253
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,768
The public got moved but
he didn't move his chair.

254
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:46,737
Just so that the car of
his life travels smoothly.

255
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:51,568
I ask you one question.

256
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,568
The job of the police
is to stop crime.

257
00:38:56,166 --> 00:39:00,303
Il you can't stop crime,
why not shut your police station?

258
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:05,801
Here are the bail papers.

259
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,535
- Let them go.
- Yes sir.

260
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,434
Have one?

261
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:42,735
How much for all of them?

262
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:45,869
- You want them all?
- Can't you hear?

263
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,267
- 1000.
- Okay.

264
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:52,102
- Open all the cages.
- Open all the cages?

265
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:57,136
This will clear the cobwebs. Open up

266
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:03,101
Release time.

267
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:06,769
Fly away!

268
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:12,705
Go on, fly!

269
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:19,804
How are you?

270
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,636
I knew someday love would rise in you.

271
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,901
Then you'll be on the right track.

272
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,770
Don't lind your own point.
I'm celebrating my freedom.

273
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,636
I got led up in prison.

274
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,569
You'll never say what's in your heart

275
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,637
Let's push. Has Bela returned?

276
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:05,268
I've arranged for you to
stay here. Is it all right?

277
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:08,502
Yes. Where is Bela?

278
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:10,567
So he is back?

279
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,870
Finished! The monkey
turned into a beauty.

280
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:33,001
Il I'm a monkey, what are you?

281
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:38,067
Monkey.

282
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:46,603
- Where are you going?
- The kids must be waiting for me.

283
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:50,402
Eat food. I've cooked today.

284
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:56,404
Feed it to the one
you've cooked it for.

285
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:13,134
What are you staring at?

286
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:20,704
I'm thinking you weren't
so pretty when you were little.

287
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:23,134
Youth hasn't been kind to you.

288
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:25,201
You're still the same. Footpath!

289
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,136
I swear! You say it so well!

290
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:33,135
I'm very happy to see you.

291
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,301
Me too, pal!

292
00:42:37,566 --> 00:42:39,267
Swear?

293
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:42,034
Swear.

294
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:47,902
Remember how you pulled
my hair when we were small?

295
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:55,668
I waited for this moment for years!

296
00:49:11,733 --> 00:49:16,838
What rascals! Where is
your boss, Technicolor?

297
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,003
Gone to Dubai?
Don't know when he'll return?

298
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:25,135
Hope you know your
lather's name at least.

299
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:37,270
You think you're very smart?
Pick his pocket il you have guts.

300
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:42,203
- You act smart. You do it.
- None of us have the guts.

301
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:44,567
I'll show you.

302
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,136
Hey kid! Careful!

303
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,468
Times are very bad. What!

304
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,001
Get lost.

305
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:22,001
Took it.

306
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:26,704
1600 plus change!

307
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:31,137
- Now what will we do?
- Eat, drink and watch a film.

308
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:33,601
And be kicked around!

309
00:50:33,966 --> 00:50:38,170
Loafers! Acting smart!

310
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:41,235
- You had to pick my pocket!
- We had a bet.

311
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:44,268
What was it? Who will die first?

312
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:49,869
You should have picked someone
who doesn't know your den.

313
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,269
But how did you know?

314
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:55,968
Is this your den? Rascal!

315
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,902
Come there!

316
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:02,202
Your den!

317
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:06,303
When you were not even born
we used to play cards here.

318
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,537
Would Murli also play with you?

319
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,469
- Then?
- Who spoilt him?

320
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,568
You rotten kids!

321
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,904
Murli is calling all of you.

322
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,835
Tell him nobody from
our gang will come.

323
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:33,668
Why don't you go when he calls?

324
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,535
You think you're a big hood!

325
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,036
He wants us to play
with kids. We get led up.

326
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,135
Then how will you
play the game of life?

327
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,436
Tell him I'll come to play. All
who come will be treated to a film.

328
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:50,435
- Really?
- Yes, don't point lingers!

329
00:52:01,966 --> 00:52:05,202
Get up! Rascal!

330
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:15,269
I know. We'll play again.

331
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:19,102
Don't scream. We'll play again.

332
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:24,170
- You make them play.
- Come on!

333
00:53:24,366 --> 00:53:27,135
We won!

334
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,869
- They cheated.
- Crying when it's your turn.

335
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:32,601
Who won the game?

336
00:53:35,633 --> 00:53:37,501
Both of us won.

337
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,502
- Then shall we go for the film?
- Are you going for a film?

338
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:44,069
- I'll get Murli. You wait.
- Murli too is going?

339
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,503
- I too will come.
- Take her and go.

340
00:53:48,766 --> 00:53:50,868
Here's the money. Go.

341
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,602
This movie will be a hit!

342
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:01,035
I mean you are Sunita's sister.

343
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:03,735
- No.
- No! No?

344
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:06,101
- Is 'yes' your enemy?
- No.

345
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:08,700
How are you guys?

346
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:13,833
Hasn't Murli come?

347
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:16,434
I wasn't going to bring him.

348
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,270
You refused to see a film with me
when we were small. Hence this game.

349
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:25,903
Why did you lie to me?

350
00:54:27,866 --> 00:54:30,168
What would you lose
il Murli had come?

351
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,268
What is it?

352
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:47,002
- I'm eating.
- Finish all of it.

353
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,603
- What childishness is this?
- Scream, yell.

354
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:27,034
I know you're angy with me.

355
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:34,439
- Why? - I went for a
film without telling you.

356
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,636
- With Ram Jaane. You felt bad.
- No.

357
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:42,269
I know you are angy.

358
00:59:42,733 --> 00:59:46,636
But you keep hiding your love.

359
00:59:48,566 --> 00:59:51,902
How many times do I tell
you that I don't love you?

360
00:59:56,966 --> 01:00:01,870
Whatever you may say,
I can read your eyes.

361
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:08,404
Just once, say that you love me.

362
01:00:09,366 --> 01:00:13,803
I swear on my life I'll
give up the world for you.

363
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:16,234
It's very difficult.

364
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,170
Give your world to the one
whose world is lonely.

365
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:23,501
I have many in my life.

366
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,768
Who? Rocky and Sabir?

367
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:31,168
With evey child of Apnaghar.

368
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,803
Their life should change.
That's my only dream.

369
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:39,803
And what about my dream?

370
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:11,101
Come in.

371
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:27,070
What pal?

372
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,334
When were you released?

373
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:34,402
When did I come?
You had gone out.

374
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:40,602
You've become a big man.

375
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:43,034
It's just show.

376
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:48,805
Times have changed.
Politicians play the game now.

377
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:52,602
Don't be under any mistake.

378
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:53,966
Nothing here belongs to me.

379
01:01:54,333 --> 01:02:02,333
You've become very smart. Before I
ask for my cut, making things clear.

380
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,668
What cut?

381
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:09,903
You may fleece others.
I'll turn your skin Technicolor!

382
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:14,136
You had promised me that
we would be equal partners.

383
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:20,606
Better do it or I am not
fond of showing off my power.

384
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:22,768
Tell me did I refuse?

385
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,302
I never denied that.

386
01:02:27,066 --> 01:02:29,134
But now the business is Bhau's.

387
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:32,969
- I have to talk to him..
- YOU talk to anyone.

388
01:02:33,366 --> 01:02:36,135
But I want my cut. Finish!

389
01:02:37,733 --> 01:02:40,735
And what about my crore?

390
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:44,968
I'll arrange it in 2 days.
I've just returned from Dubai!

391
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,135
Give me some cash for spending.

392
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,769
I'm giving.

393
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:57,769
Is the red Mercedes
parked outside yours?

394
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:05,771
- Why?
- I have problems getting around.

395
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,738
- The key.
- I won't refuse anything.

396
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:14,368
Fill the tank.

397
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:17,767
I'll return on Monday.

398
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:33,068
A man just left with my Mercedes.

399
01:03:33,433 --> 01:03:35,768
Finish him off!

400
01:04:43,099 --> 01:04:45,969
- Come on.
- Why?

401
01:04:46,533 --> 01:04:48,668
No time to waste. Come on.

402
01:04:48,966 --> 01:04:51,868
- What happened?
- Guests to talk to me.

403
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:55,703
- Not to be spoken before girls.
- Go inside.

404
01:04:58,366 --> 01:05:01,102
All of you go away.

405
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:04,501
- They have to pay bills.
- Later.

406
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:11,238
Don't look behind. Get lost.

407
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,433
Coming.

408
01:05:22,533 --> 01:05:30,340
- Ram Jaane here.
- My boss will speak.

409
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,635
I'll lock up.

410
01:05:40,466 --> 01:05:43,302
- Get in the kitchen.
- Do you want to eat fried egg?

411
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,734
I want fried brain!

412
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,634
Do you want to eat fried chicken?

413
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:56,568
Go and take his order.

414
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:03,437
I'll give you fried brain!

415
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:58,666
Why has your lace turned
pale seeing me here?

416
01:07:01,699 --> 01:07:03,034
What do you mean?

417
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,302
I'll tell you.

418
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:14,305
No... what is the matter?

419
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,735
Talk from far. Don't come close.

420
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,134
You sent your men to kill me.

421
01:07:19,466 --> 01:07:21,167
- What?
- You didn't?

422
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:25,069
- You didn't?
- Swear by my mother.

423
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:32,669
Ty to recall.

424
01:07:33,066 --> 01:07:35,201
You remember nothing.

425
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:38,735
I'll remind you.
Did you sent them or not?

426
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:40,834
- No.
- Did you send them?

427
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,569
- Did you or not?
- I did.

428
01:07:44,866 --> 01:07:47,835
See, you're bleeding.
Get up and say it.

429
01:07:48,466 --> 01:07:51,902
Get up, carefully.
Dust off your clothes.

430
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:54,568
- Didn't you sent them?
- No.

431
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:06,636
Talk. Talk! No smart moves.

432
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:08,701
I too will listen.

433
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:13,637
Your job is done.
Ram Jaane is finished.

434
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:19,670
Forgive your elder brother!

435
01:08:21,366 --> 01:08:23,568
Your voice...!

436
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:29,037
I didn't know your voice
was like a mouse's!

437
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,368
Say it once again.

438
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:33,267
Forgive me Ram Jaane.

439
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:37,102
- Like a mouse!
- Forgive me!

440
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,768
What a lovely sound!

441
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:45,234
Now get up.

442
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,404
Il you were not my childhood pal..

443
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:56,735
With great love...

444
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,403
I would turn your skin Technicolor.

445
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,268
Don't take those papers.
They are very important.

446
01:09:03,866 --> 01:09:09,738
I know a smart ass like you
won't keep trash in the vault.

447
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,502
What's in this?

448
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:20,537
- What's this for?
- To escape from the police.

449
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:28,138
You've become very technical.

450
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,901
Shut up! Call Bhau.

451
01:09:32,266 --> 01:09:33,834
Call him up!

452
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:46,367
Darling don't take the call.

453
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,535
Move.

454
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:56,800
Yes?

455
01:09:57,666 --> 01:10:01,302
One crore?

456
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,069
Tomorrow at 10?

457
01:10:08,266 --> 01:10:09,333
Who is this?

458
01:10:15,533 --> 01:10:18,535
- Come on.
- Yes darling.

459
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:28,699
But before that let me book
Ramjaane's ticket to hell.

460
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,069
Nobody? Let's check.

461
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,001
There's a bomb in the car!

462
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:21,601
Push it away!

463
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:42,537
I thought I should
make an entry in style.

464
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,703
Why did you send men
out to receive me?

465
01:11:47,066 --> 01:11:51,069
I'm a very small man.
Why are you staring at me?

466
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,834
Didn't you recognize me? It's me.

467
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:01,973
Whether God knows or not,
I only know this much...

468
01:12:03,233 --> 01:12:08,171
The one who looks into my
eyes shuts his eyes very soon.

469
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:12,703
Why? You don't look so bad.

470
01:12:14,533 --> 01:12:19,638
It takes me time to understand.

471
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,701
Did you threaten me?

472
01:12:23,933 --> 01:12:26,902
Yes? Now why are you scared?

473
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:32,102
You've tried once earlier.

474
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:36,268
In any case, I don't care.

475
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,467
I'm not scared of death.

476
01:12:40,233 --> 01:12:42,234
I don't love life.

477
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:45,268
I say it with pride!

478
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,634
Hit me! Come on!

479
01:12:47,966 --> 01:12:51,869
Come on, shoot!

480
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,669
No man can shoot me.

481
01:12:56,199 --> 01:13:01,538
That friend of yours, Banu
along with whom you cheat the public..

482
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:04,668
And send it to banks abroad.

483
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:08,235
He really fears death.

484
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,438
Il Banu dies, you'll be in trouble.

485
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:19,935
But what can I do? I'm helpless.

486
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:25,537
Il I don't reach him by 11,
my men will shoot him.

487
01:13:28,233 --> 01:13:30,501
- It's going to be 11.
- What?

488
01:13:31,633 --> 01:13:34,702
You talk so much!
You wasted so much time!

489
01:13:35,066 --> 01:13:38,235
I will call up.
Maybe they haven't killed him.

490
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:51,101
20 bucks for whole milk
and 15 bucks for cow milk.

491
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,569
What's the rate of
Banu Technicolor?

492
01:13:56,533 --> 01:14:01,104
What color? My milk is white.

493
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:05,036
What? He has turned white!

494
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:09,502
I don't understand what you're saying.

495
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:14,604
I'm speaking from Bhau's place.

496
01:14:15,733 --> 01:14:18,368
Then give the order.

497
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,835
My order will take some time.

498
01:14:22,233 --> 01:14:27,504
Il I don't reach by 12,
give our guest some hot bullets.

499
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,468
Poor thing shouldn't die hungry.

500
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:33,401
You seem mad!

501
01:14:35,633 --> 01:14:38,435
My men are going mad!

502
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,267
Why are you standing?

503
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:45,268
- Get the suitcase.
- Hurry up.

504
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:05,570
Tell your men not to follow me.

505
01:15:06,033 --> 01:15:10,203
My own rascals are waiting.
Il they see anyone chasing me..

506
01:15:10,766 --> 01:15:13,668
Banu will really turn Technicolor!

507
01:15:14,966 --> 01:15:16,067
See you.

508
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,135
I'll take the front door.

509
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:23,968
See you, men of Bhau.

510
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:27,901
He has gone!

511
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,535
How will he go?

512
01:15:32,566 --> 01:15:36,369
I've got used to winning
after giving notes.

513
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,002
Connect me to Inspector Chunte.

514
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:00,901
How are you guys?

515
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:21,468
There's a bag under the car.
Fix it someplace.

516
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,134
Search the place.

517
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,902
Yes, I smell a dead rat
from under the gutter.

518
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,201
Searching the house
will get you nothing.

519
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,002
You'll be a rat in prison!

520
01:16:57,466 --> 01:16:58,767
Find the red bag!

521
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,202
Which bag?

522
01:17:02,533 --> 01:17:04,167
What do you think of yourself?

523
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:06,968
Only you have brains?

524
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:09,567
You don't know the c of crime!

525
01:17:10,066 --> 01:17:13,936
A policeman butters
his toast with it.

526
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,467
And has it for breakfast!

527
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,803
- Great.
- Where is the money?

528
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,301
Is it yours?

529
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:31,235
Have you had wine so early?

530
01:17:31,633 --> 01:17:35,670
Il I had the cash, would
I be standing here?

531
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,502
Wouldn't I have gone to Delhi?

532
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:40,200
Arrest him!

533
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,370
- My crime?
- Your crime is that...

534
01:17:44,733 --> 01:17:47,869
You looked into my eyes!

535
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:54,637
Why does he ruin my clothes?

536
01:17:55,966 --> 01:18:02,038
But tell me where
they are taking you?

537
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,335
- What politics is this?
- It's not politics.

538
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:10,138
Inspector has piles. He wants
me to apply some balm to him.

539
01:18:13,566 --> 01:18:18,604
I'll apply the balm to you
grinding your own bones!

540
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:20,701
Do you have a warrant?

541
01:18:21,066 --> 01:18:23,968
Asking me for a warrant?
Come with me, I'll show you!

542
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,501
Why are you inviting trouble?

543
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:29,234
Why do you get hot? Forgive him.

544
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,468
He has lost his nuts.

545
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:36,503
He thinks everything is legal.
He doesn't know senior officers..

546
01:18:36,933 --> 01:18:39,368
Like yourself, killed
justice and buried it!

547
01:18:39,733 --> 01:18:42,402
And you just threaten the poor!

548
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,401
Don't be scared.

549
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:51,505
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

550
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:58,671
Now you'll only return when
your hair has turned gray.

551
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:03,836
And il I turn bald
like you before that?

552
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:11,367
You've ruined everything!

553
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,935
You shouldn't have upset Ram Jaane.

554
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:18,603
Nothing has happened.
Inspector Chunte will sort it out.

555
01:19:20,366 --> 01:19:23,669
How did he enter the picture?

556
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:25,401
Have you done something?

557
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:33,272
One challenges those
who are more powerful.

558
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,068
Not with Ram Jaane.

559
01:19:36,533 --> 01:19:41,437
Right now Ram Jaane
is in jail thanks to me.

560
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:44,969
You'll get us killed!

561
01:19:45,933 --> 01:19:50,237
All the papers of the bank scam.

562
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:54,236
All the letters and
diaries are with him!

563
01:19:55,566 --> 01:20:00,337
Il he splits the beans, you'll
go to jail in place of him!

564
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:05,468
Call up Chunte!

565
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,801
Free Ram Jaane.

566
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:17,805
- But sir... - Pig! Know the
meaning of saying but' to me?

567
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:21,334
Hail stones on the head.

568
01:20:24,133 --> 01:20:26,468
The diaries and papers are with him.

569
01:20:28,466 --> 01:20:31,569
It's opening.

570
01:20:31,966 --> 01:20:36,136
I won't go in a cab.
I have my respect.

571
01:20:36,466 --> 01:20:39,635
Take your vehicle to drop me.

572
01:20:40,133 --> 01:20:44,904
You've heard that song...?

573
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,536
Come on smooth lace.

574
01:21:55,266 --> 01:21:59,436
You should knock before
entering a girl's room.

575
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:04,269
Why don't girls knock
before entering our hearts?

576
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:08,136
They just get in like a jet.

577
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:11,969
Man is finished.
See what I got you.

578
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,701
It looks pretty expensive.

579
01:22:20,199 --> 01:22:22,035
Don't talk of cost!

580
01:22:22,533 --> 01:22:25,502
Nothing in my life is
more precious than you!

581
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,069
I'll cut my head and place it
at your feet il you want it.

582
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:31,701
I'll give up my life.
Finished in one minute.

583
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:35,800
Do you know..

584
01:22:36,433 --> 01:22:38,768
Since you entered my life...

585
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:44,904
I marvel at the beauty God has made

586
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:49,936
Wear this. I swear...

587
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:54,503
You'll look better
than the film heroines.

588
01:22:56,366 --> 01:22:59,035
I won't wear this dress.

589
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:03,503
You won't? Got it!
Not in front of me.

590
01:23:03,866 --> 01:23:05,701
I'll turn away. Wear it.

591
01:23:07,433 --> 01:23:09,868
I still won't wear it.

592
01:23:13,866 --> 01:23:16,768
Why? You don't like it?

593
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:21,602
No problem. We'll change it.

594
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:24,001
I'll get whatever you want.

595
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:28,937
I won't take anything given by you.

596
01:23:29,266 --> 01:23:34,904
You're not yet ready?
That's a lovely dress.

597
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,035
But she's not wearing it.

598
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:39,634
Wear it. Everybody at the
party is waiting for you.

599
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:44,037
- What party?
- Didn't he tell you?

600
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:49,104
There were 3 weddings in our area.
Ram Jaane paid for all of them.

601
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,337
There's a reception tonight.
Come down soon.

602
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,201
Come.

603
01:24:08,433 --> 01:24:12,303
The liquor has just come!

604
01:24:12,966 --> 01:24:14,500
Tell me one thing...

605
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,672
The inspector said he would
cook you in jail forever.

606
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,101
Why did he come to drop you?

607
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:25,601
What politics is this?

608
01:24:26,033 --> 01:24:28,735
You know or God knows?

609
01:24:30,033 --> 01:24:38,033
Now tell what politics this is.

610
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:47,173
Politics goes to vote.

611
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:52,504
Tell me one thing.
How did you get this name?

612
01:24:55,199 --> 01:25:01,139
Even you don't have an answer to that

613
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:55,939
Bhau is sitting there.
I'm sitting here!

614
01:32:56,533 --> 01:32:58,067
Come in Ram Jaane.

615
01:32:58,766 --> 01:33:00,467
We were waiting for you.

616
01:33:01,066 --> 01:33:04,736
The whole world waits for good times.

617
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,170
Isn't it, Technicolor?

618
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:14,703
Tell us what your demands are.

619
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:18,135
I haven't come with any demands.

620
01:33:18,566 --> 01:33:23,037
Do I look like a union leader?
I've come to do business with you.

621
01:33:24,033 --> 01:33:27,336
I want the same cut from
your business that Banu gets.

622
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:32,370
I know all about what your business
is and how much is Banu's cut.

623
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:36,402
Here, read this.

624
01:33:44,266 --> 01:33:46,101
Where did you get this?

625
01:33:48,233 --> 01:33:53,271
Where 10 people work,
one man will be a traitor.

626
01:33:53,733 --> 01:33:56,068
Isn't it Technicolor?

627
01:33:57,266 --> 01:34:02,704
I'm speaking from experience.
Kill one of these, another will rise.

628
01:34:03,033 --> 01:34:06,603
Just like a chicken.

629
01:34:07,033 --> 01:34:11,804
Keeps getting deeper.
Isn't it Technicolor?

630
01:34:12,766 --> 01:34:15,001
We accept what you say.

631
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:21,104
But the construction
business started after Sameer.

632
01:34:21,566 --> 01:34:23,534
So you have no cut in it.

633
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:29,504
All right. I accept what you say
since you accepted what I said.

634
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,301
This is how the car proceeds.

635
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:37,405
But all the diaries and papers
you took from Banu's sale...

636
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,968
Give them to me.

637
01:34:41,433 --> 01:34:47,639
For the car of business to start,
you need the battery of trust.

638
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,935
Then let the car remain standing.

639
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,803
I've found the complete
story of your crooked neck.

640
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:58,136
You wrestled before lighting elections

641
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:03,371
ll the opponent was powerful,
he played foul and defeated him.

642
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:08,805
You are like a chameleon.
Can't say when you'll change.

643
01:35:09,166 --> 01:35:13,336
I won't give you the papers.
Isn't it Technicolor?

644
01:35:13,766 --> 01:35:15,634
Why do you keep saying, Technicolor?

645
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:19,369
So that you know you're not
the only one who can do it.

646
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:23,637
- I can also do it.
- Why light? Talk to Bhau.

647
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:25,634
- Where is he?
- Look here...

648
01:35:26,066 --> 01:35:28,134
We want to do business with you.

649
01:35:28,533 --> 01:35:32,003
What difference do papers make?
Isn't it Technicolor?

650
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:07,401
Break everything.

651
01:36:27,933 --> 01:36:29,934
What is going on?

652
01:36:30,766 --> 01:36:33,068
The municipal land has
to be vacated by morning.

653
01:36:33,433 --> 01:36:34,333
Show me the orders.

654
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:57,901
Getting thrashed!

655
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,001
I'll rip everybody!

656
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:19,203
Why did you stop? Hit me.

657
01:37:20,633 --> 01:37:26,105
Took it out with such style.
Yelled, tying to fool me?

658
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:30,904
Il you don't stab me,
the public will boo you!

659
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,535
I've got my gun out.

660
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,702
Now il you don't stab me,
I'll press the trigger.

661
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,639
Let me tell you, I might escape
your assault but il you survive..

662
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:50,604
This whole area will dirty you.

663
01:37:50,966 --> 01:37:54,703
So let's both get ourselves maligned.

664
01:37:55,033 --> 01:37:57,869
You put away your knife
and I'll put away my gun.

665
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,268
Tell me one thing.

666
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,434
Who sent you here?

667
01:38:11,366 --> 01:38:13,468
You don't interfere.
This concerns land.

668
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:19,671
I'm warning you, I won't let
anyone step on that land!

669
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:23,770
I told you not to interfere in
construction or you'll regret it!

670
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:30,004
Il it was only me, I would
understand but Bhau...!

671
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,835
He took 10 crores to clear the land.

672
01:38:41,366 --> 01:38:46,471
How did our men return? You said
the land would be vacated by morning.

673
01:38:46,866 --> 01:38:48,033
Forget that land.

674
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:50,201
- Who spoke?
- Me.

675
01:38:51,966 --> 01:38:53,634
You'll get back your 10 crores.

676
01:38:54,066 --> 01:38:58,069
What nonsense is this?
I want the land not the money!

677
01:38:58,633 --> 01:39:00,234
You wont get that land.

678
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:06,172
Il I don't get that land, I'll
buy you along with the inhabitants!

679
01:39:06,633 --> 01:39:09,569
Where are you Banu?
Knock some sense into him!

680
01:39:10,199 --> 01:39:13,937
I will. I told you for morning.
Have a little patience.

681
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:16,267
He won't listen.

682
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,602
- Il Bhau tells him...?
- There's no way of convincing him.

683
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,802
Can't you see? Driving blindly!

684
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:54,968
Is it your lather's road?

685
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:11,436
What have you done!

686
01:40:11,966 --> 01:40:15,469
You've ruined the construction
business by killing him!

687
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:17,201
How will you work like this?

688
01:40:18,166 --> 01:40:19,667
Will you kill all your men?

689
01:40:20,266 --> 01:40:22,501
Softly.

690
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:27,570
Loud voices disturb my eardrums.

691
01:40:29,066 --> 01:40:34,104
You know I never kill my own men.

692
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,769
Tell me where is the compromise?

693
01:40:45,333 --> 01:40:47,101
Who killed him?

694
01:40:54,933 --> 01:40:57,068
You know who killed Baweja. Tell me!

695
01:40:57,366 --> 01:40:59,835
- I don't know.
- Lying!

696
01:41:02,933 --> 01:41:05,235
- Move..
- No.

697
01:41:23,933 --> 01:41:26,235
Who killed him?

698
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,968
Stop it!

699
01:41:31,633 --> 01:41:33,101
Why are you hitting this innocent?

700
01:41:33,733 --> 01:41:35,935
Il he is innocent, who is guilty?

701
01:41:36,566 --> 01:41:38,401
You know it better than me.

702
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,337
But you won't catch them.
Instead you'll hit innocents.

703
01:41:43,933 --> 01:41:46,502
You can't reform these rascals!

704
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,869
You've taken over municipal
land in their name...

705
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:53,202
You think you're smart?

706
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,400
- Attack!
- Stop it!

707
01:43:47,333 --> 01:43:51,704
No!

708
01:44:01,899 --> 01:44:04,102
You killed him!

709
01:44:06,233 --> 01:44:11,838
Not just him, I'll kill
everyone of you here.

710
01:44:12,366 --> 01:44:17,170
I won't move from here
till I lind Baweja's killer.

711
01:44:17,433 --> 01:44:18,767
Understood!

712
01:44:29,966 --> 01:44:36,906
You tell us. Who killed Baweja?

713
01:44:37,633 --> 01:44:38,967
Answer!

714
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:47,666
Say who had killed Baweja!

715
01:44:54,466 --> 01:44:57,602
Answer or I'll kill you!

716
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:00,435
I'll tell you who killed him.

717
01:45:19,433 --> 01:45:21,868
Yes, son. You tell me.

718
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:26,601
Poltoo.

719
01:46:09,399 --> 01:46:12,903
Come closer.

720
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,870
Rarely do you see tears
in the eyes of death.

721
01:46:18,633 --> 01:46:22,003
Come and see death cy.

722
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:27,035
Poltoo was only 14 years old.

723
01:46:28,133 --> 01:46:31,269
Death doesn't take away
life at that early age.

724
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,867
It takes away dreams.

725
01:46:34,766 --> 01:46:39,370
This is not Poltoo's corpse
but of all future children.

726
01:46:39,933 --> 01:46:42,502
Their future has been charted by you!

727
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,602
Their lives were lull of thorns.

728
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,335
But also some flowers.

729
01:46:49,866 --> 01:46:55,738
You taught them to remove the
thorns by uprooting the trees!

730
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,369
Today we lost Poltoo.
Tomorrow will be Sabir's turn.

731
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:04,104
Then Rocky. Then it
will be Chintu's turn!

732
01:47:04,366 --> 01:47:06,868
No!

733
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,702
Are you saying before everybody
that I am responsible for his death?

734
01:47:12,033 --> 01:47:14,235
You are wrong! Tell him.

735
01:47:15,166 --> 01:47:19,236
The police killed him, not me.

736
01:47:19,633 --> 01:47:21,201
Yes the police killed him.

737
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:24,169
But why did the police come here?

738
01:47:24,866 --> 01:47:27,335
I'll go away from here
il you want me to.

739
01:47:27,733 --> 01:47:30,669
But I didn't come here myself.
You brought me here by force!

740
01:47:31,066 --> 01:47:35,336
I don't want to stay here.
I'm leaving this place.

741
01:47:35,633 --> 01:47:37,468
Talks nonsense!

742
01:48:00,466 --> 01:48:05,571
Do you know what Ram Jaane
said when he was leaving?

743
01:48:07,433 --> 01:48:11,970
He wanted me to go
with him. I refused.

744
01:48:12,266 --> 01:48:14,868
He started insisting like a child.

745
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:18,736
- Why won't you come?
- Because I don't love you.

746
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:22,768
You are lying.

747
01:48:23,399 --> 01:48:27,070
Lies! Say that you are lying.

748
01:48:27,766 --> 01:48:30,168
I know how much you love me.

749
01:48:31,166 --> 01:48:33,801
Say that you are lying or
I'll set the world aflame!

750
01:48:34,233 --> 01:48:36,201
I'll burn up everything!

751
01:48:39,966 --> 01:48:44,337
Now I know why you said this!

752
01:48:44,666 --> 01:48:46,534
Because of Murli!

753
01:48:47,133 --> 01:48:51,937
He put this in everybody's mind
that Poltoo died thanks to me!

754
01:48:52,533 --> 01:48:54,935
I'm responsible for his death. No!

755
01:48:55,233 --> 01:48:59,170
The police killed him.
What's my fault?

756
01:48:59,466 --> 01:49:00,466
I didn't do anything for myself!

757
01:49:00,766 --> 01:49:04,169
Il I hadn't killed Baweja,
where would all of you go?

758
01:49:06,433 --> 01:49:09,936
What would happen to women, kids?

759
01:49:10,733 --> 01:49:14,970
And his Apnaghar?
Where would his kids go?

760
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:17,535
Where would your Chintu go?

761
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,067
He is right.

762
01:49:21,433 --> 01:49:22,901
He is not right.

763
01:49:25,133 --> 01:49:29,270
You know I love you not him.

764
01:49:31,466 --> 01:49:34,569
But he loves you.

765
01:49:35,433 --> 01:49:39,036
I can't sacrifice my love for him.

766
01:49:40,233 --> 01:49:43,402
He has been sacrificing all the time.

767
01:49:44,133 --> 01:49:47,569
When he was born, he got a
trash can not a mother's lap.

768
01:49:48,033 --> 01:49:53,538
When he grew, he got derided by
strangers not love from family.

769
01:49:54,133 --> 01:49:57,503
Life has always kicked him.

770
01:49:57,966 --> 01:50:02,270
And today, I who he made the
mistake of considering a friend..

771
01:50:02,733 --> 01:50:04,901
I drew away from him.

772
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:10,171
You must do what I couldn't.

773
01:50:10,699 --> 01:50:14,570
Il anyone can reform him it is you.

774
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,804
One day you said, you could
give up your world for me.

775
01:50:21,066 --> 01:50:24,068
Today I say to you...

776
01:50:24,366 --> 01:50:28,036
Yes, I love you.

777
01:50:29,633 --> 01:50:31,701
For my sake...

778
01:50:34,866 --> 01:50:40,137
Save Ram Jaane.

779
01:51:42,133 --> 01:51:45,469
You're looking beautiful today.

780
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:49,336
Even I'm wearing a shirt for
the first time, for your sake.

781
01:51:51,233 --> 01:51:53,101
This way.

782
01:52:10,933 --> 01:52:12,901
Open up.

783
01:52:15,899 --> 01:52:17,635
Come.

784
01:52:24,866 --> 01:52:27,101
Today just the two
of us will eat here.

785
01:52:27,766 --> 01:52:30,869
I've booked the hall
for the entire evening.

786
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:47,902
- Didn't ask why?
- Because I'm with you.

787
01:52:48,766 --> 01:52:51,802
Swear, you know me well!

788
01:52:51,866 --> 01:52:53,434
Ours will be a good pair.

789
01:52:53,866 --> 01:52:56,501
Just like ice cream.

790
01:52:58,166 --> 01:53:00,735
You're not smiling?

791
01:53:07,533 --> 01:53:11,236
Now why did you laugh?

792
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,735
Because I called the
steward city bird?

793
01:53:14,066 --> 01:53:18,603
Everybody calls him steward
but city bird is my style.

794
01:53:21,766 --> 01:53:24,468
I don't know the English
of eating. Ask madam.

795
01:53:25,333 --> 01:53:30,404
And tell your band
I haven't come from abroad.

796
01:53:30,699 --> 01:53:33,903
I'm from this county.
I'd like to hear some good beats.

797
01:53:34,533 --> 01:53:35,834
What is that?

798
01:53:36,633 --> 01:53:39,836
What kind of song?

799
01:53:40,366 --> 01:53:44,269
That's the limit!
Were you born in Malabar Hill?

800
01:53:44,633 --> 01:53:47,068
Haven't you ever seen
Ganpati being immersed?

801
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:48,834
Haven't broken Govinda's pot?

802
01:53:49,166 --> 01:53:52,135
Don't you know a lively song?
What do you know?

803
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,868
You haven't slept?

804
01:59:17,033 --> 01:59:19,769
What's the matter?
Why are you so silent?

805
01:59:21,233 --> 01:59:24,836
Your eyes are lilied.
What's the matter?

806
01:59:25,733 --> 01:59:29,069
What do I say? And how?

807
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:31,235
After all what am I? Your servant?

808
01:59:31,533 --> 01:59:35,103
- I've never considered you..
- Let me speak.

809
01:59:35,966 --> 01:59:41,137
You were 5 when your
parents died in an accident.

810
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,368
You had no relatives.

811
01:59:43,899 --> 01:59:48,237
I wasn't your Uncle but a waiter.

812
01:59:48,733 --> 01:59:51,802
I know I'm not intelligent.

813
01:59:52,066 --> 01:59:56,937
I couldn't do much
but I raised you well.

814
01:59:57,233 --> 02:00:00,235
I know. You gave me lots of love.

815
02:00:01,399 --> 02:00:06,905
I did think of my parents
but I never missed them.

816
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:12,838
Tell me, had they been alive
would you return so late evey night?

817
02:00:13,766 --> 02:00:17,369
Times change but not
the worries of parents.

818
02:00:17,833 --> 02:00:21,636
How long will I watch this quietly?

819
02:00:22,466 --> 02:00:26,269
I'm glad that you asked me.

820
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:31,571
At least it gave a
chance to lighten my heart.

821
02:00:32,466 --> 02:00:35,869
I swear I have done nothing...

822
02:00:36,366 --> 02:00:39,168
That will hurt my parents' soul.

823
02:00:40,033 --> 02:00:45,338
I've done nothing that won't
allow me to meet your eyes!

824
02:00:45,666 --> 02:00:51,438
Then why do you stay
with Ram Jaane all night?

825
02:00:52,733 --> 02:00:58,038
You raised me, looked after this hotel

826
02:00:58,366 --> 02:01:01,001
What do you mean?

827
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:06,637
Murli made his house
with great difficulty.

828
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,835
Raises orphans.

829
02:01:09,633 --> 02:01:13,136
What's the meaning of that?

830
02:01:14,666 --> 02:01:21,639
This is the only meaning
between Ram Jaane and me.

831
02:01:24,066 --> 02:01:25,200
Understood.

832
02:01:26,566 --> 02:01:30,836
But do you feel he will change?

833
02:01:34,033 --> 02:01:35,534
God knows.

834
02:01:35,899 --> 02:01:37,067
20 for 40.

835
02:01:38,199 --> 02:01:41,803
- 20 for 40.
- Give it for 25.

836
02:01:46,266 --> 02:01:48,301
Selling in black?

837
02:01:48,899 --> 02:01:51,369
- Yes. So what?
- Are you new?

838
02:01:51,766 --> 02:01:53,534
I came much before you son.

839
02:01:53,933 --> 02:01:57,202
- Don't act as our lather!
- Understood. Come to jail.

840
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,769
- We're coming. First call Chunte.
- Acting smart!

841
02:02:01,366 --> 02:02:02,700
Is Chunte your lather!

842
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,936
He will drop us back
in the vehicle he takes us!

843
02:02:07,466 --> 02:02:10,836
- Is that so?
- Don't up know us?

844
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:12,801
We're Ramjaane's men.

845
02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:25,506
See what's printed in the paper.

846
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:31,503
Murli prepares hoods in Apnaghar
to strengthen Ramjaane's gang.

847
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:37,304
On that prete_ he has grabbed
municipal land worth millions.

848
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,238
The municipality had decided
to give that land to Baweja.

849
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,469
So Murli told Ram Jaane to kill him.

850
02:02:47,233 --> 02:02:51,537
Whoever may have a hand in
Baweja's death, the mind is Murli's.

851
02:02:54,466 --> 02:02:56,568
This is all a big conspiracy!

852
02:02:57,066 --> 02:02:59,101
Chunte is behind the news.

853
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:04,504
- He is spreading rumors..
- We've heard complaints earlier.

854
02:03:05,066 --> 02:03:07,301
Specially about Sargam gang.

855
02:03:07,633 --> 02:03:09,368
This time the matter is serious.

856
02:03:10,266 --> 02:03:12,267
So we resign from the trust.

857
02:03:12,899 --> 02:03:15,269
We'll prepare a report and
send it to the government.

858
02:03:16,066 --> 02:03:18,101
We're freezing the bank accounts.

859
02:03:18,533 --> 02:03:20,067
You can't draw anything.

860
02:03:21,133 --> 02:03:23,435
- You can't..
- Let's go.

861
02:03:23,966 --> 02:03:26,535
Think about what will
happen to the kids.

862
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:38,835
How will we eat bread and water?

863
02:03:43,966 --> 02:03:47,235
Won't we get milk today?

864
02:04:00,333 --> 02:04:03,202
Look at how thin the gravy is!
It's just water!

865
02:04:14,333 --> 02:04:18,537
- You haven't slept?
- Give me some milk.

866
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,302
I can't sleep without milk.

867
02:04:27,899 --> 02:04:32,704
A man gave this packet for you.

868
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:51,569
- Don't fuss...
- You're crossing limits.

869
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:54,368
I'll break all limits!

870
02:04:54,833 --> 02:04:58,069
Okay but you won't
see my lace after that.

871
02:04:58,566 --> 02:05:02,436
I proposed to you but you refused.
Do you want to torment me forever?

872
02:05:02,833 --> 02:05:08,905
I told you the day you leave
illegal jobs, I'll do what you say.

873
02:05:08,966 --> 02:05:13,870
- Why involve my work?
- To know whom you love more.

874
02:05:14,266 --> 02:05:15,700
Me or your work!

875
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:17,734
This! This!

876
02:05:19,766 --> 02:05:22,301
Finishes me at this point!

877
02:05:25,033 --> 02:05:26,200
Yes.

878
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,904
Il I do as you say,
will you do as I say?

879
02:05:42,266 --> 02:05:43,533
Yes.

880
02:05:45,066 --> 02:05:47,301
Why are you saying it angrily?

881
02:05:51,366 --> 02:05:55,670
Promise me with your hand in mine.

882
02:06:12,866 --> 02:06:15,535
Why do you see him and draw away?

883
02:06:15,933 --> 02:06:17,567
He's not between us.

884
02:06:18,233 --> 02:06:21,803
- He's my friend.
- But I don't want your friendship.

885
02:06:22,166 --> 02:06:24,201
Take back your money.

886
02:06:26,199 --> 02:06:30,203
- What money? - I know you
when you didn't know yourself.

887
02:06:30,666 --> 02:06:34,569
By giving money do you want
to prove you run Apnaghar?

888
02:06:35,066 --> 02:06:37,034
I'll die but not look at this money!

889
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,003
What's wrong with this money?

890
02:06:43,899 --> 02:06:47,436
They have been printed at
the same mint as the others.

891
02:06:47,933 --> 02:06:50,402
The fault lies in
the way it is earned.

892
02:06:50,866 --> 02:06:53,335
How can I tech the kids
Honesty is the best policy?

893
02:06:53,666 --> 02:06:56,602
When their school stands
on the foundation of dishonesty!

894
02:06:57,866 --> 02:06:59,767
Die alone il you have to.

895
02:07:00,133 --> 02:07:02,535
You're killing the innocent
children with hunger!

896
02:07:02,833 --> 02:07:08,104
I won't let them starve!
We're in this state thanks to you!

897
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:10,235
I will unmask them all!

898
02:07:10,666 --> 02:07:13,902
Your brain will be outside your head!

899
02:07:14,166 --> 02:07:15,934
And disco dance!

900
02:07:17,733 --> 02:07:20,268
Everybody has to die someday.

901
02:07:20,666 --> 02:07:23,902
Il my death removes thorns,
I'll consider my life worth it.

902
02:07:24,266 --> 02:07:29,838
Stop it! Il you see death,
all these big words will choke you!

903
02:07:30,166 --> 02:07:32,535
Go home and sleep!

904
02:07:33,266 --> 02:07:35,067
Do you think I'm joking?

905
02:07:35,933 --> 02:07:38,568
Honesty is a joke!
Hard work is a joke!

906
02:07:38,966 --> 02:07:43,804
The only truth is those living in
buildings suck the blood of the poor!

907
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:46,435
How many will you light?

908
02:07:46,933 --> 02:07:50,836
What do you want? We mustn't
light lamps fearing the storm!

909
02:07:51,166 --> 02:07:53,134
You are lighting your pyre!

910
02:07:53,699 --> 02:07:57,036
Explain to him.
Why don't you understand?

911
02:07:58,333 --> 02:08:00,368
Il I ask you the same?

912
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:04,802
I've said what I had to!

913
02:08:05,133 --> 02:08:08,402
Now I'm not responsible
for whatever happens!

914
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:14,271
This life is indebted to you.
Take it back whenever you want.

915
02:08:17,833 --> 02:08:19,833
You'll die!

916
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:28,202
And you will let him die!

917
02:08:28,533 --> 02:08:31,936
What can I do? Il he puts
his hand in a snake's pit..

918
02:08:32,199 --> 02:08:34,235
- Who can save him?
- Are you a snake?

919
02:08:40,033 --> 02:08:46,205
I don't know my caste or I wouldn't
be caught between Murli and Bhau.

920
02:08:46,633 --> 02:08:50,303
But he knows his caste.
Why does he envy me?

921
02:08:50,899 --> 02:08:53,569
He envies you?

922
02:08:53,833 --> 02:08:56,902
Why does he oppose me?
Whatever for?

923
02:08:57,199 --> 02:08:59,468
He has nothing. He is
where he started from!

924
02:08:59,833 --> 02:09:03,603
The papers are right. Il he
hadn't pretended to raise kids..

925
02:09:03,933 --> 02:09:05,734
He would still be on the footpath.

926
02:09:06,133 --> 02:09:08,201
Flies would be swarming round him!

927
02:09:09,699 --> 02:09:15,338
And look at me. 50 people
salute me wherever I go.

928
02:09:15,766 --> 02:09:18,335
They recognize my lace.
I have everything.

929
02:09:18,966 --> 02:09:24,705
Money, flat, cars and
a beauty like you!

930
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:30,237
He saw you with me and turned green.

931
02:09:31,266 --> 02:09:32,800
Very well.

932
02:09:33,666 --> 02:09:36,235
You can teach lessons on friendship.

933
02:09:36,966 --> 02:09:39,735
The one who sacrificed
his own love for you..

934
02:09:40,199 --> 02:09:42,335
You are abusing him?

935
02:09:45,033 --> 02:09:46,901
What did you say?

936
02:09:47,566 --> 02:09:52,003
Who sacrificed his love?

937
02:09:53,466 --> 02:09:55,100
- Murli?
- Yes!

938
02:09:57,333 --> 02:09:59,735
_ for me?
- Yes, for you!

939
02:10:02,699 --> 02:10:06,103
- And you?
- I can sell my soul for him!

940
02:10:08,766 --> 02:10:15,606
What does he have that I don't?

941
02:10:17,866 --> 02:10:21,102
He doesn't live for himself.

942
02:10:21,466 --> 02:10:24,101
Like you, he too was an orphan.

943
02:10:24,566 --> 02:10:30,505
But look at him today. To save
others he sacrificed all he had!

944
02:10:31,466 --> 02:10:35,436
He thought I might succeed
in making you a good man.

945
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:41,672
But I give up.
You are still the same!

946
02:10:42,233 --> 02:10:45,336
Get lost! Bitch!

947
02:10:46,133 --> 02:10:49,002
You came to me because
you wanted a good time!

948
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:52,736
You wanted to sit in a car,
show style like rich people!

949
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:55,802
You wanted all this and
you take Murli's name!

950
02:10:56,100 --> 02:11:00,137
A prostitute takes her money
and goes but you are very smart!

951
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:03,936
You sell your heart
before selling your body!

952
02:11:04,233 --> 02:11:07,669
But I won't be trapped!
I can get hundreds like you!

953
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:16,668
I am not for sale!

954
02:11:17,666 --> 02:11:20,168
Raise your hand on another!

955
02:11:20,433 --> 02:11:23,169
I will rip you apart! Get lost!

956
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:48,837
Why did I hit her!

957
02:12:16,433 --> 02:12:21,805
Why? Why did you punish me?

958
02:12:23,533 --> 02:12:26,035
Why?

959
02:12:37,466 --> 02:12:41,136
I would go to the e_ent of saying
newspapers are responsible for this.

960
02:12:41,933 --> 02:12:47,405
Pick any newspaper. You have no
headlines but violence and power!

961
02:12:47,766 --> 02:12:50,034
We print what is happening in society.

962
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:53,336
- We are the mirror of society.
- Absolutely wrong!

963
02:12:53,766 --> 02:12:57,769
You only print news that brings
forth the horrible lace of today.

964
02:12:58,333 --> 02:13:02,870
You never print stories to
show goodness in society!

965
02:13:03,233 --> 02:13:06,903
Is it a lie that 2 boys of Apnaghar
were involved in Baweja's murder?

966
02:13:08,266 --> 02:13:10,868
I'm willing to prove
the truth with evidence.

967
02:13:11,399 --> 02:13:13,502
But I want some answers before that.

968
02:13:15,133 --> 02:13:18,069
On what grounds was Baweja
given the land of Apnaghar?

969
02:13:19,266 --> 02:13:24,270
Despite knowing that Chunte is
responsible for Poltoo's death...

970
02:13:24,566 --> 02:13:26,334
Why wasn't legal action
taken against him?

971
02:13:26,933 --> 02:13:30,102
My last and most important question.

972
02:13:30,366 --> 02:13:32,101
Why did Bhau give Ram Jaane a crore?

973
02:13:33,033 --> 02:13:35,034
I'll repeat these questions everyday

974
02:13:36,333 --> 02:13:39,836
Till the time their echo
returns as my answer!

975
02:13:45,233 --> 02:13:48,336
Why don't you say something?
Il we don't shut him up...

976
02:13:48,666 --> 02:13:51,268
The public will hit us with shoes!

977
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:55,770
I'll gouge your eyes out
il you even look at Murli!

978
02:13:56,033 --> 02:13:59,136
Raise your hand and I'll
crush it! Murli is my friend!

979
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:01,868
Bring your friend here.

980
02:14:02,199 --> 02:14:03,501
I'll open my bank for him.

981
02:14:04,399 --> 02:14:07,603
Should I give up my life
because he is your friend.

982
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:11,002
Quiet, Banu.

983
02:14:11,566 --> 02:14:16,837
Legislators have started
making noise in the Assembly.

984
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:21,037
Some of them have even met Murli.

985
02:14:21,433 --> 02:14:28,573
And he assured them at the right
time he'll give proof against us.

986
02:14:29,666 --> 02:14:32,068
Where did he get evidence?

987
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:35,735
Have you given him the
papers and diaries?

988
02:14:36,266 --> 02:14:37,967
All the papers are with me.

989
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:40,368
You will die and kill us too!

990
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,400
Let go!

991
02:14:47,666 --> 02:14:49,334
The matter is gone far beyond.

992
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:55,839
Do one thing. Give the
papers and diaries to me.

993
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:59,603
And talk sense to your friend.

994
02:15:00,066 --> 02:15:05,204
Explain to him il he
opens his mouth in public...

995
02:15:05,566 --> 02:15:10,137
He won't hear the screams of
innocent people amid the applause.

996
02:15:10,533 --> 02:15:12,201
Your friend will survive.

997
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:15,669
- But the public will suffer.
- No!

998
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:19,135
I'll get the papers and diaries.

999
02:15:20,333 --> 02:15:22,368
But I want no problems.

1000
02:15:23,066 --> 02:15:25,735
I'll talk to that jerk Murli.

1001
02:15:26,433 --> 02:15:28,034
But warn this link...!

1002
02:15:28,733 --> 02:15:32,303
No action to be taken.

1003
02:15:34,566 --> 02:15:37,068
We'll wait here for you.

1004
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:39,435
- Bhau...
- Quiet.

1005
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:52,803
Captain, bring your men home.

1006
02:15:53,466 --> 02:15:57,636
As Ram Jaane reaches,
blow up the entire area.

1007
02:15:58,733 --> 02:16:05,606
The game should begin
before he reaches.

1008
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:08,936
He is cray. He'll
change sides anytime.

1009
02:16:11,766 --> 02:16:16,837
No need to understand what I say.

1010
02:16:17,133 --> 02:16:21,537
Ram Jaane is on his way here.
Arrest him and take him to jail.

1011
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:24,568
There's going to be a
blast here. Who did it?

1012
02:16:24,833 --> 02:16:27,435
Ram Jaane. Why?
Because tomorrow morning..

1013
02:16:27,733 --> 02:16:30,435
Murli is going to go public
about Ram Jaane killing Baweja.

1014
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,835
He'll be in prison
and ty to break away.

1015
02:16:33,166 --> 02:16:34,634
You shoot him then.

1016
02:16:56,833 --> 02:17:00,503
God knows whether I
will be Technicolor.

1017
02:17:01,399 --> 02:17:06,671
But you turn Technicolor today.

1018
02:17:31,933 --> 02:17:34,402
This was good.

1019
02:17:34,866 --> 02:17:39,136
Well done. This rascal deserved it.

1020
02:17:40,066 --> 02:17:43,636
I knew you were eavesdropping.

1021
02:17:44,066 --> 02:17:47,135
That's why I played this game.

1022
02:17:48,466 --> 02:17:50,668
Don't you believe me?

1023
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,335
Captain is here.
You may call and ask him.

1024
02:17:53,733 --> 02:17:55,401
Here, ask him.

1025
02:20:17,533 --> 02:20:20,903
Are you all right sir?

1026
02:20:21,433 --> 02:20:24,269
He's dead.

1027
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:56,804
By God! Today he won't escape!

1028
02:22:10,033 --> 02:22:12,034
The police won't enter the temple!

1029
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:16,937
You'll hide thieves in the temple!
Give refuge to criminals!

1030
02:22:17,366 --> 02:22:21,036
Then the army not just
the police will enter!

1031
02:22:22,366 --> 02:22:27,204
You're a Muslim. Why are
you worried about the temple?

1032
02:22:27,666 --> 02:22:30,035
So what? Am I not a human?

1033
02:22:30,233 --> 02:22:37,340
You know religion but I know
I'll give my life to save Ram Jaane!

1034
02:22:37,633 --> 02:22:41,236
- We'll all give our lives!
- Yes!

1035
02:22:42,966 --> 02:22:45,468
Don't expect mercy from me.

1036
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,802
I hate the word, mercy!

1037
02:22:49,799 --> 02:22:54,171
Counting of dead bodies
holds no meaning for me!

1038
02:22:56,033 --> 02:22:59,002
You're not telling us
anything new about yourself.

1039
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:02,803
Keep one thing in mind...
il you lire one shot today...

1040
02:23:03,566 --> 02:23:05,167
A battle will be fought.

1041
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:07,902
A battle in which I may not survive.

1042
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:10,301
But you definitely won't.

1043
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:15,871
Il you love these bastards so
much, hand Ram Jaane over to me!

1044
02:23:16,366 --> 02:23:19,068
Whether any of you survive or not..

1045
02:23:19,633 --> 02:23:26,573
Ram Jaane definitely won't!

1046
02:23:34,566 --> 02:23:37,635
All right. I'll get him.

1047
02:23:47,433 --> 02:23:51,036
Evey thing is finished.

1048
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:57,104
Before you came in,
I thought the same.

1049
02:23:57,533 --> 02:23:59,468
All this is finished.

1050
02:24:00,033 --> 02:24:03,369
Come on, get up.

1051
02:24:13,233 --> 02:24:19,238
Why are you drawing guns?

1052
02:24:19,933 --> 02:24:23,069
Don't you know your Banu
has become Technicolor?

1053
02:24:23,399 --> 02:24:24,901
And Bhau too is finished!

1054
02:24:26,733 --> 02:24:28,768
Quiet! You talk too much!

1055
02:24:29,433 --> 02:24:33,336
There's nobody to save you.

1056
02:24:33,766 --> 02:24:36,068
Everybody is finished!

1057
02:24:36,366 --> 02:24:40,903
Il you ty any smart acts,
his death will be on your head.

1058
02:24:41,366 --> 02:24:44,302
I will rot in prison!

1059
02:24:44,633 --> 02:24:48,703
Shut up! What are you staring at?

1060
02:24:49,366 --> 02:24:52,702
Put down your guns!
Or I'll shoot him!

1061
02:24:53,033 --> 02:24:54,734
Throw down the guns!

1062
02:24:55,899 --> 02:24:57,534
Do as he says.

1063
02:25:01,299 --> 02:25:04,603
You take so long to understand.

1064
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:08,603
Walk slowly.

1065
02:25:09,066 --> 02:25:11,066
Finished!

1066
02:25:22,866 --> 02:25:24,634
Sir, this gun is empty.

1067
02:25:46,866 --> 02:25:52,338
What have you done?

1068
02:25:53,299 --> 02:25:56,636
He is saved.

1069
02:25:57,933 --> 02:26:01,636
But you won't escape!

1070
02:26:02,466 --> 02:26:06,069
It nicked him but il the
bullet had touched his heart...

1071
02:26:06,399 --> 02:26:08,301
I would have torn your chest apart
with my hands and removed your heart!

1072
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:10,301
And squeezed it like a rat!

1073
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:13,501
Why did you shoot him?

1074
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,435
Why did you shoot my friend?

1075
02:26:17,033 --> 02:26:19,435
You are my enemy. Shoot me.

1076
02:26:21,533 --> 02:26:26,871
Since I was this high,
this chap has been after me!

1077
02:26:27,733 --> 02:26:31,103
He shook my bones when
I was a little kid!

1078
02:26:31,466 --> 02:26:34,468
Do you know he turned my
lips yellow by hitting hard!

1079
02:26:34,733 --> 02:26:38,970
Do you know why?
Only for this uniform!

1080
02:26:39,533 --> 02:26:44,170
Il you didn't have this uniform,
you couldn't stand before me.

1081
02:26:44,899 --> 02:26:49,938
I throw an open challenge
to you before the public!

1082
02:26:50,433 --> 02:26:54,904
Il you are a man, take off
the uniform and lace me!

1083
02:26:55,299 --> 02:26:58,736
I will prove it that your
strength lies in your uniform!

1084
02:26:59,066 --> 02:27:01,134
Inside the uniform,
your bones are jelly!

1085
02:27:01,466 --> 02:27:03,201
Just jelly!

1086
02:27:03,666 --> 02:27:06,368
Bastard! You are not
the child of a man!

1087
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:09,903
- That's why you were born
in a trash can! - Shut up!

1088
02:27:10,233 --> 02:27:11,434
- You challenged me?
- Yes.

1089
02:27:11,733 --> 02:27:15,503
- Then take this!
- Look at the jelly bones!

1090
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:23,006
Il I don't make mince meat of
your bones with my iron lists..

1091
02:27:23,399 --> 02:27:26,136
I'm not worthy of my name!

1092
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:29,436
Why are you talking with your
mouth. Use your hands instead!

1093
02:27:29,799 --> 02:27:32,769
Get into the arena!
I'll prove it before all..

1094
02:27:33,233 --> 02:27:35,568
The size of the bones doesn't matter.

1095
02:27:35,966 --> 02:27:41,504
Courage lies in the heart!

1096
02:27:41,866 --> 02:27:45,703
My hands are twitching.
Pick up your lists!

1097
02:27:45,966 --> 02:27:47,467
Throw away the gun!

1098
02:27:52,533 --> 02:27:57,271
You shouldn't have thrown the gun.

1099
02:27:59,233 --> 02:28:01,068
Finished!

1100
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:28,399
I'll prove that the accusations
on Ram Jaane are baseless.

1101
02:28:30,299 --> 02:28:33,870
He fired at Chunte for sell defense.

1102
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:38,137
Why are you lying to save me?

1103
02:28:39,700 --> 02:28:44,938
I say it with pride.
I killed Bhau.

1104
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,302
I killed Banu.

1105
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:52,470
And I only killed
that bastard Chunte!

1106
02:28:58,733 --> 02:29:02,536
What will you do? Hang me?

1107
02:29:02,866 --> 02:29:06,869
I don't even want to
live in your world!

1108
02:29:08,433 --> 02:29:12,036
See what you have
turned your world into!

1109
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:14,468
Third class!

1110
02:29:15,066 --> 02:29:18,135
This lamer knows I killed those 3

1111
02:29:18,533 --> 02:29:20,968
Yet he tries to save me.

1112
02:29:21,299 --> 02:29:25,404
Why? For money!

1113
02:29:26,299 --> 02:29:29,269
He sells his soul for money.

1114
02:29:29,566 --> 02:29:34,470
Sells the law! You have ruined
the law by selling justice.

1115
02:29:35,533 --> 02:29:38,269
You eat food worth thousands
in a live star hotel.

1116
02:29:38,566 --> 02:29:42,069
And buy your wile a car
costing 20 lakhs but...

1117
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:45,402
But you won't give the
5 bucks due to a poor man!

1118
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:47,168
Not look at the footpath. Why?

1119
02:29:47,666 --> 02:29:50,101
For money!

1120
02:29:50,666 --> 02:29:54,202
The whole world runs behind money.

1121
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:57,002
Like you I too am a bastard!

1122
02:29:57,333 --> 02:30:00,402
I deserve to die! That's it!

1123
02:30:04,466 --> 02:30:07,368
You will kill me, isn't it?

1124
02:30:09,433 --> 02:30:12,602
But who will kill you?

1125
02:30:12,933 --> 02:30:16,336
I am not alone. Ramjaane's are
being born in the whole world!

1126
02:30:17,033 --> 02:30:19,068
How many will you kill?

1127
02:30:19,399 --> 02:30:22,102
The law will get tired killing them.

1128
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:26,036
But that will not stop them
from being born! I warn you!

1129
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:30,003
They will be born on
evey heap of garbage!

1130
02:30:30,366 --> 02:30:35,504
Il you want to kill Ram Jaane
erase the heaps of garbage!

1131
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:40,336
Clap your hands kids!

1132
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:48,270
Under Section 302 of
Indian Penal Code, this court..

1133
02:30:48,633 --> 02:30:52,069
...sentences Ram Jaane
to death by the noose.

1134
02:30:54,033 --> 02:30:55,567
Finished!

1135
02:31:00,333 --> 02:31:04,737
Hey guys! No crying!

1136
02:31:18,666 --> 02:31:21,935
I've thought of this game.
Hang by the noose.

1137
02:31:22,366 --> 02:31:24,801
And smile despite all the pain.

1138
02:31:25,066 --> 02:31:26,901
- What?
- How?

1139
02:31:27,233 --> 02:31:28,534
Like Ram Jaane!

1140
02:31:31,666 --> 02:31:32,900
What's going on?

1141
02:31:33,833 --> 02:31:37,303
- What are you doing?
- Playing the game of death!

1142
02:31:38,933 --> 02:31:41,035
We are not scared of death!

1143
02:31:42,100 --> 02:31:44,068
We don't want to live in your world!

1144
02:31:53,533 --> 02:31:56,936
Buddy! What's wrong with you?

1145
02:31:57,533 --> 02:32:02,638
Looking at your lace anyone would
feel you were being hanged not me.

1146
02:32:03,433 --> 02:32:05,701
I wish I could take your punishment.

1147
02:32:06,166 --> 02:32:11,437
Then nor would this situation
come nor I ask you for anything.

1148
02:32:12,266 --> 02:32:15,669
You're late. I could only
have given you one thing.

1149
02:32:16,166 --> 02:32:20,169
My life. But even
that has been stamped.

1150
02:32:20,766 --> 02:32:23,301
The law has taken away your life.

1151
02:32:23,799 --> 02:32:26,335
In return you have given
death to evey child of Apnaghar.

1152
02:32:27,666 --> 02:32:30,769
I haven't understood.

1153
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,638
They follow your life style.
They are preparing for death not life

1154
02:32:38,033 --> 02:32:42,170
ll you give up your life with
a smile, they will be convinced...

1155
02:32:42,533 --> 02:32:44,368
Life is a disease not a gift.

1156
02:32:44,733 --> 02:32:48,703
And death is its' cure.

1157
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:51,168
Do you want me to cy while dying?

1158
02:32:51,566 --> 02:32:55,770
- This is my last request pal.
- No! I won't lear death!

1159
02:32:56,133 --> 02:33:01,271
I always lived like death.
That is why life never dared...

1160
02:33:01,633 --> 02:33:04,202
To meet my eyes!

1161
02:33:04,466 --> 02:33:06,334
I know it my friend.

1162
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:10,570
- Think of those innocents...
- I will not!

1163
02:33:11,233 --> 02:33:13,835
As it is the world will kill them!

1164
02:33:14,233 --> 02:33:18,003
We are insects not humans
in their eyes! Cockroaches!

1165
02:33:18,333 --> 02:33:21,202
That is why like yourself, you want
them to wash their hands off life.

1166
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:24,936
Like myself I want them to
live with their head held high!

1167
02:33:25,233 --> 02:33:26,767
Look death in the eye!

1168
02:33:29,233 --> 02:33:31,001
You won't understand!

1169
02:33:31,366 --> 02:33:34,335
Only when you kick life
you get what you want!

1170
02:33:35,366 --> 02:33:38,168
Il kicking the world
gets you everything...

1171
02:33:38,766 --> 02:33:41,368
Then why didn't you get Bela?

1172
02:33:42,133 --> 02:33:45,803
Because she is off the rocker!

1173
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:47,067
She is mad and so are you!

1174
02:33:47,366 --> 02:33:50,235
I won't listen to you.
I lived with pride.

1175
02:33:50,533 --> 02:33:52,534
And I'll die with pride. Finish!

1176
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:34,104
Gently. They said to hang
me not bleed me to death.

1177
02:34:34,433 --> 02:34:37,936
Now do it gently.

1178
02:34:53,766 --> 02:34:56,535
See you guys.

1179
02:34:57,166 --> 02:35:00,102
This man snored a lot.
Constable, look after everyone.

1180
02:35:00,833 --> 02:35:03,969
Don't cy. I'll tell your
mother you're following me.

1181
02:35:04,366 --> 02:35:07,235
Good bye guys. See you up there.

1182
02:35:19,466 --> 02:35:22,202
Hey guys! How are you?

1183
02:35:23,266 --> 02:35:29,538
- Hail Ram Jaane!
- I'm feeling good.

1184
02:35:31,399 --> 02:35:35,337
Ram Jaane is the best!

1185
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:38,501
All my boys!

1186
02:36:04,566 --> 02:36:08,136
- Come on.
- Let go.

1187
02:36:11,133 --> 02:36:16,137
Let me go. I'm scared!

1188
02:36:16,533 --> 02:36:17,834
Let me go!

1189
02:36:27,833 --> 02:36:31,536
I beg you. Let me go!

1190
02:36:33,033 --> 02:36:35,435
Save me Murli!

1191
02:36:37,566 --> 02:36:40,268
- I'm scared!
- Come on!

1192
02:36:40,633 --> 02:36:43,936
I'll be straight now!

1193
02:36:44,266 --> 02:36:46,501
I beg you!

1194
02:36:46,766 --> 02:36:50,336
Save me Murli!

1195
02:37:26,299 --> 02:37:30,170
He said he would die
with his head held high!

1196
02:37:31,766 --> 02:37:35,636
You rat!

1197
02:37:44,633 --> 02:37:46,434
Let go!

1198
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:48,535
This too was my style! What?

1199
02:39:39,066 --> 02:39:44,037
I hit and insulted you. Forgive me.

1200
02:39:45,100 --> 02:39:49,504
I had no other way of
sending you back to Murli.

1201
02:39:50,333 --> 02:39:53,869
Il I knew you loved Murli.

1202
02:39:54,133 --> 02:39:58,003
I swear I would never
come between both of you.

1203
02:39:58,633 --> 02:40:04,305
But how couldn't I come?
Rascal on the footpath!

1204
02:40:04,633 --> 02:40:07,035
I came to this world
without wanting it.

1205
02:40:07,366 --> 02:40:10,135
Came between you without wanting it.

1206
02:40:11,866 --> 02:40:13,801
But now I'm leaving.

1207
02:40:15,700 --> 02:40:17,701
The bread man used to say.

1208
02:40:18,033 --> 02:40:22,170
What you don't get in this
birth, you get in the ne_.

1209
02:40:22,633 --> 02:40:26,937
Is there a ne_ birth?

1210
02:40:27,399 --> 02:40:30,836
Will we meet in the ne_ birth?

1211
02:40:31,333 --> 02:40:34,335
God knows.
