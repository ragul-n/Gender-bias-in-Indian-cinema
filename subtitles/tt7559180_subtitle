1
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,927
Sir.

2
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:14,344
<i>The hemorrhage was very serious.</i>

3
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:17,771
- <i>She's lost a lot of blood...
- Is my wife alive or not?</i>

4
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,136
<i>We couldn't save her.</i>

5
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:25,636
<i>You have a healthy son.</i>

6
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:47,961
<i>Jay, my son...listen.</i>

7
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,669
<i>Music is a drug.</i>

8
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:58,044
<i>They say those with the gift
of music and rhythm</i>

9
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:01,086
<i>have been touched by God.</i>

10
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,002
<i>All lies.</i>

11
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:10,252
<i>Do you know why those crazy people
like performing on stage?</i>

12
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:15,294
<i>Because they've become addicted
to the applause.</i>

13
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,127
<i>And then,</i>

14
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,286
<i>their addiction to one drug
leads to another.</i>

15
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>Little by little, music will take
everything from you.</i>

16
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,044
<i>Among all the diseases
in this world,</i>

17
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:46,794
<i>among the most terrible addictions,</i>

18
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,669
<i>the worst of all</i>

19
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,002
<i>is music.</i>

20
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,752
<i>This is my Jay.</i>

21
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,502
<i>He's a singer-songwriter.</i>

22
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,002
<i>He sings for me.</i>

23
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,794
<i>And he's deeply in love with me.</i>

24
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:53,836
<i>And me?</i>

25
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,294
<i>I'm Sophia.</i>

26
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,627
<i>Today's my big day.</i>

27
00:05:58,086 --> 00:06:02,211
<i>My charity show's big finale
is about to start.</i>

28
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,336
- Well, what's the plan?
- It's simple.

29
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,919
Dancers exit from the left.
The lights are off.

30
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:27,510
- Our winning designer...
- Sophia Singhania.

31
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,456
She'll make her entry and speak.

32
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,966
Sophie?

33
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,952
She's the winner!

34
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:36,169
- She can't speak.
- Meaning?

35
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,044
She's mute.

36
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,792
Her work does the talking.

37
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,294
Come on, guys, get ready!
Three minutes. Everyone on stage.

38
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,752
Let's go, guys. Come on!

39
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,002
<i>How shall I call you, Sophia?</i>

40
00:06:56,044 --> 00:07:00,586
<i>What does your name mean to me?</i>

41
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:05,086
<i>Is it the sunlight, Sophia?</i>

42
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:10,752
<i>Or does your name mean
the dawn?</i>

43
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:16,961
<i>I hear your name took time to create</i>

44
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:21,805
<i>It drives away the darkness</i>

45
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:26,252
<i>It brightens the destiny of us all</i>

46
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,877
<i>Your name...</i>

47
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:33,002
<i>...is like the Divine Light</i>

48
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:39,836
<i>When I look at you, Sophia</i>

49
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:45,668
<i>I have the answers
to all my questions</i>

50
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:50,495
<i>You've stirred my heart, Sophia</i>

51
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:56,278
<i>Your very name... Sophia</i>

52
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,586
Jay, what's up?

53
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,044
<i>This whole world was created
just for you, Sophia.</i>

54
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:18,919
For you.

55
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,002
<i>How blessed I am, Sophia</i>

56
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,771
<i>Now that my name is one with yours</i>

57
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:44,127
<i>Sophia, Sophia...</i>

58
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,235
Check, check, check.

59
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,377
Love it!

60
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,044
- Sanju Singhania.
- Jay. It's an honour, sir.

61
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,002
Sophie's Jay!

62
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:38,919
We meet finally.

63
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:39,924
Do sit.

64
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:44,669
If I knew you had so much fun here,
I'd skip work and come every day.

65
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,502
- Any time, sir.
- I mean,

66
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,127
all this gear belongs to you?

67
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:50,961
There's a secret behind that.

68
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,086
Tell me more.

69
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:53,711
"Dandiya."

70
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:55,044
No!

71
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,794
Every Navrati we play at "Dandiyas".

72
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:00,586
So we buy this gear
playing at those shows.

73
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,711
Amazing!

74
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:05,336
- Have you graduated?
- Yes. Some years ago, sir.

75
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:08,169
- I'm doing my Masters now.
- What subject?

76
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:09,336
Music technology.

77
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:11,877
Technology?
It looks like you're into it.

78
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:14,086
Music.

79
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:16,711
Sorry to disturb you.

80
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:18,669
Mr. Parekh. Four missed calls.

81
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,961
I gotta take this call.

82
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,966
We gotta hang. You and me.
We gotta spend some alone time.

83
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,044
Take it easy. Give me that phone.

84
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,794
Parekh! You know I love you, baby.

85
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:56,211
Bro!

86
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:58,627
Seen the poster?

87
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:01,044
Look what I've got for you.

88
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,919
Whoever wins the contest
gets the headlining slot.

89
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,252
No audition needed.
Just upload a song.

90
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,877
- What song?
- Don't you have one?

91
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,502
- But, which song?
- Any of your songs, man.

92
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,586
I don't have a competition winner.

93
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,877
Send any song! We'll be selected.

94
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:20,044
You gotta write a 100 songs
to get one good one.

95
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:22,169
You probably have a 1000!

96
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,586
- It's our time to shine.
- Ball, please.

97
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,211
Hey!

98
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:29,211
Ball, please.

99
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:37,419
Thank you, Saheb-ji.

100
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:42,836
We gonna graduate. It's this first time,
we must perform on stage.

101
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,220
I don't know, man.
We may not get another chance.

102
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,127
Hey, Chow Mein!

103
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,627
Hey, Chopsticks!

104
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,484
What's up, Chinkers!

105
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,294
Thank you.

106
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,211
Can't you see? Come here!

107
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:06,752
Bro, send two tracks
from your old album.

108
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:10,294
You gotta do something, bro.
We won't get a better chance.

109
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:13,836
Listen to me...Jay, forget it!

110
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,752
Jay, ignore them!

111
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:21,877
Son of a...

112
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,419
Thanks for that, man.

113
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,044
Anything for you.

114
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,044
Then send the song.

115
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:57,044
Which song, bro?

116
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,086
The song you sang yesterday was cool.

117
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:02,377
That won't win.

118
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,377
<i>We're far from the bustling city</i>

119
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,669
<i>Walking towards happiness</i>

120
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:37,794
<i>We lost our way</i>

121
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:42,502
<i>Treading on unknown paths</i>

122
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,294
<i>Looking for a place of light</i>

123
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:51,586
<i>Live life today. Who knows
what tomorrow brings</i>

124
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,752
<i>Ask your heart what it desires</i>

125
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,627
<i>Ask the name of the star it seeks</i>

126
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:02,966
<i>Let a new story begin</i>

127
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:06,169
<i>Let the impossible be possible</i>

128
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:10,211
<i>Let life blossom</i>

129
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,547
Next up, the Momos!

130
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:18,086
<i>This new, new, ever-new...</i>

131
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,336
<i>This ever-new life</i>

132
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,294
<i>These ever-new goals</i>

133
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:32,002
<i>O traveller, you've grown wheels
under your feet</i>

134
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:35,627
<i>O traveller, you can now steady
your faltering steps</i>

135
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:39,711
<i>Don't get lost in the crowd.
Come, lead the way </i>

136
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:43,294
<i>You're a fire that can't turn
to ash</i>

137
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:46,127
<i>This new, new, ever-new...</i>

138
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:49,252
<i>This ever-new life</i>

139
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:56,252
<i>These ever-new goals</i>

140
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:01,044
<i>My heart dances with joy</i>

141
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,086
<i>My words come straight from my heart</i>

142
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:08,086
<i>My heart dances with joy</i>

143
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:11,086
<i>My words come straight from my heart</i>

144
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:14,961
<i>The new day is here</i>

145
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,002
<i>What you have...</i>

146
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,086
<i>...is soon gone</i>

147
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:23,502
<i>I gave my heart</i>

148
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:27,127
<i>O sweetheart</i>

149
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,669
<i>Let me hear you today</i>

150
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:34,044
<i>Tell me</i>

151
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,044
<i>The world is ours</i>

152
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:42,044
<i>And Time is ours</i>

153
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,377
My father was right.

154
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,502
There's no drug like applause.

155
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:52,002
Try other drugs too!

156
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:56,294
You're a rock star, man.

157
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:57,294
A photo then!

158
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,044
- Where's your family?
- Right here.

159
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,377
Come. Let's go do this.

160
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,127
Mr Singhania, smile, please.

161
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:08,044
Oh man!

162
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,669
I had no idea
you're such a rock star.

163
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:12,711
I love it. I'm blown away.

164
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:16,419
This weekend...I'm having guests.

165
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,669
I want you to be there.

166
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:20,961
You'll be my guest of honour.

167
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,044
You'll be the man of the moment.

168
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:24,461
We'll party.

169
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,211
She's waiting for you. Go on.

170
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:29,752
Get out of here!

171
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,711
<i>Your story has always
seemed strange to me.</i>

172
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:43,767
There's no need for that.

173
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,391
You could've died last night.

174
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:04,517
You know that?

175
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:09,309
I had a feeling I should keep
this safely.

176
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,726
You have a very interesting story.

177
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:06,577
<i>O soulmate of mine, you glow...</i>

178
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:08,604
<i>...with myriad colours</i>

179
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:11,057
<i>O soulmate of mine</i>

180
00:19:11,392 --> 00:19:14,476
<i>Desires have myriad hues</i>

181
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:20,275
<i>Loving you is full of wondrous colour</i>

182
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:28,017
- He'll inherit Singhania's empire.
- He's cute!

183
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:35,392
<i>O soulmate of mine,
you're my whole world</i>

184
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,771
<i>O soulmate of mine</i>

185
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:42,726
<i>You're the reason behind
everything I do</i>

186
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:51,577
<i>O soulmate of mine,
you're so innocent</i>

187
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,869
<i>O soulmate of mine,
you're without compare</i>

188
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:07,142
<i>If only this moment
would stay frozen in time</i>

189
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:21,851
<i>O soulmate of mine,
you glow with myriad colours</i>

190
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:34,139
<i>You're my whole world</i>

191
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:29,309
Jay, come over for a second.

192
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:35,476
I'd like you to meet
the Hon. Chief Minister, Mr Prabhakar.

193
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,684
I'd like to call you a friend.

194
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:40,809
He's very keen to get to know you.

195
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,142
Nice to meet you.

196
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:50,059
The song you just sang
started with a fugue?

197
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,601
You know classical music, sir?

198
00:21:55,684 --> 00:22:00,684
I initiated the classical music
courses at Delhi University.

199
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,601
I especially like fugues
that have feeling.

200
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:08,434
I'm glad you liked my song, sir.

201
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,476
When did I say I liked it?

202
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:16,017
Music either has truth
or it doesn't.

203
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:22,809
Your music is good,
it'll have truth someday.

204
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:26,601
Good luck!

205
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,017
- A drink?
- I don't drink, sir.

206
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:31,809
You must be the only rock star
who doesn't. Amazing!

207
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:34,517
Cheers!

208
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:37,309
So...

209
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,226
You love Sophie.

210
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:45,101
Very much.

211
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:47,767
What will you do with this love?

212
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,559
With your permission,
I'd like to marry her.

213
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:56,392
How easy it is for the unmarried
to say they want to marry.

214
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,892
That's wild!

215
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:00,976
- I really want to, sir.
- No, no, of course. I don't doubt you.

216
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,809
Sophie would've thought carefully
before choosing you.

217
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:10,767
She may be unable to speak,
but she understands everything.

218
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,684
She knows why I asked you
to come here.

219
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:23,267
I want to give India a new method
of listening to music.

220
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,510
I want to start an AI streaming service

221
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:32,517
that goes into your phone, into
your tablet, into your computer,

222
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:34,184
into your mind.

223
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:36,767
But I need someone

224
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,684
who'll head the service.

225
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:43,267
And that person is you.

226
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:48,059
Together we'll make it happen.

227
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:50,267
I'm totally convinced.

228
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,517
I want you.

229
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,726
It'd be an honour, sir.

230
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,684
You're practically family.

231
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,392
Come on! Who else was I going to ask?

232
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:06,267
But, sir, with all due respect,

233
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:09,437
I want to do something else.

234
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,434
Like what?

235
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,351
Music.

236
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:18,851
This is music!

237
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:21,559
I don't want to work
in the music business.

238
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:24,351
It's all music -
all connected with music.

239
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:28,267
I want to be a musician, sir.

240
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:33,841
Sing my own songs, sir.
And write lyrics.

241
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,434
But what work will you do?

242
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:39,684
Just that, sir.

243
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,684
I've always dreamt that Sophie and I

244
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,601
would go on tour.

245
00:24:48,476 --> 00:24:51,476
I'll write songs,
perform live gigs.

246
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:54,517
She'll carry on with her fashion,
art and dance.

247
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:58,642
We just want to travel for a while.

248
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,684
Explore ourselves. Find ourselves.

249
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,642
There's something between us, sir.

250
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:07,476
Oh! It's magic.

251
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:10,267
- You feel like it's magic!
- It's something magical.

252
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:12,142
You know what I mean.

253
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,726
Like a fairytale,

254
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:23,142
you'll walk into the sunset.

255
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:24,892
Hand-in-hand.

256
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:26,809
Come on!

257
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:32,142
Look around you.

258
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,767
Look where you're sitting.

259
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:39,601
I've toiled to get
to this position.

260
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:42,017
And raised Sophie with great care.

261
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:46,392
Why should I give my daughter's hand
to some struggling artist?

262
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,517
I promise you, sir.
I'll make Sophie very happy.

263
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:50,809
How?

264
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:55,101
By performing at festivals?

265
00:25:57,142 --> 00:26:01,059
Have you any idea how much
the families of artists

266
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:05,142
have to struggle,
all in the name of art?

267
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:10,267
Because you artists can only
love yourselves.

268
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:15,684
Sir, I believe music can change lives.

269
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:22,684
Just one song...
can change the whole world.

270
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,017
One song can change the world?

271
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:31,434
And drum roll!

272
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:34,642
You have that song!

273
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:37,517
You've written that song.

274
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:41,976
I'm in the presence of true art.

275
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,767
Let me hear it.

276
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:45,517
Let me hear it.

277
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:48,642
Hit me, come on!
I want to hear it.

278
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:50,851
Where is this song?

279
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,976
I'm all ears, baby. I'm all ears.

280
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:56,351
Do you have a song like that?

281
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,309
I'll tell you.

282
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:04,017
You want to be a musician.

283
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:06,559
Compose music first.

284
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,059
Why one song? Compose a 100 songs.

285
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,101
Then we'll see

286
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,267
if your song can change the world
or not.

287
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:21,559
Till then, don't even think
about Sophie.

288
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,017
That's my offer.

289
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,601
Do you love Sophie deeply enough?

290
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:38,684
100 songs!

291
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:52,564
<i>I've raised Sophie with great care.</i>

292
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:55,767
<i>Why should I give my daughter's hand
to some struggling artist?</i>

293
00:27:56,928 --> 00:28:00,809
<i>Because you artists can only
love yourselves.</i>

294
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:04,351
<i>Do you have a song like that?</i>

295
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,267
<i>A song that can change the world?</i>

296
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:07,142
Do you have one?

297
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,476
<i>Till then, don't even think
about Sophie.</i>

298
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:31,809
<i>Music has ruined our family.</i>

299
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,684
<i>Why only one song?</i>

300
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,684
<i>Compose a 100 songs.</i>

301
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:04,392
Go inside. Choose your birthday present.

302
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:26,767
Where did you find this, son?

303
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,309
Make the bill.

304
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:34,309
- Where did you find this?
- At the back of the shop.

305
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:35,351
Really?

306
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,351
I'm glad you found the guitar, son.

307
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,434
I don't want it.

308
00:29:38,684 --> 00:29:40,564
The strings are free.

309
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:43,142
All packed for you.

310
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:45,017
I told you I don't want it.

311
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,892
It's not for you. The boy wants it.
It's a child's guitar.

312
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:52,059
It's the last one we have.
He found it.

313
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:53,767
I said no.

314
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:58,476
Selling this guitar won't pay
my bills.

315
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:01,226
The boy likes it.

316
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:03,309
So, 20% discount. That's it.

317
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,101
He talked like my father.

318
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:43,726
You love Sophie, don't you?

319
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:49,684
Just go away with her.
Why talk to him?

320
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:53,218
- No.
- It's the 21st century, bro.

321
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,351
Maybe even the 22nd!

322
00:30:57,309 --> 00:30:58,392
I won't.

323
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,684
So, you'll write the songs?

324
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:09,517
A hundred songs?

325
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:13,684
If you're sure,

326
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,351
then come with me.

327
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:18,684
Where to?

328
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:21,934
Shillong, bro.

329
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:24,684
Best place on earth.

330
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,851
Especially to write songs.

331
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:31,017
You were made for Shillong.

332
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:36,059
We'll record a hundred songs
and throw them in his face.

333
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,392
Well?

334
00:31:49,684 --> 00:31:52,726
<i>I've hidden a tune for you
in this tiny box.</i>

335
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:55,976
<i>Whenever you hear it,</i>

336
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:58,684
<i>you will know</i>

337
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,726
<i>the music that's inside of me</i>

338
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:05,684
<i>that music is you.</i>

339
00:32:12,726 --> 00:32:14,684
<i>Don't ask me why I'm going away.</i>

340
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,142
<i>But I will come back for you.</i>

341
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:23,642
<i>And if I fail,</i>

342
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:26,809
<i>then I'm unworthy of you.</i>

343
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:48,642
<i>If I can no longer see you</i>

344
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:56,493
<i>It would undo my heart</i>

345
00:32:56,976 --> 00:33:00,165
<i>Undo my heart</i>

346
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:12,061
<i>If I can no longer see you</i>

347
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:19,770
<i>It would undo my heart</i>

348
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,870
<i>Undo my heart</i>

349
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:30,076
<i>Whenever I think of you, my love</i>

350
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:33,684
<i>My heart fills with sadness,
my love</i>

351
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:37,756
<i>May you never forget me, my love</i>

352
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:43,934
<i>O my love</i>

353
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:56,684
<i>All peace of mind comes
only from you</i>

354
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,559
<i>My obsession is you, only you</i>

355
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:04,684
<i>My longing is for you, only you</i>

356
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:13,103
<i>Without you, I am nothing</i>

357
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:54,357
<i>O benevolent one</i>

358
00:34:54,642 --> 00:35:00,059
<i>I have lost my heart to you</i>

359
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:17,187
<i>If I can no longer see you</i>

360
00:35:18,726 --> 00:35:24,737
<i>It would undo my heart</i>

361
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:28,407
<i>Undo my heart</i>

362
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,097
<i>O benevolent one,
let me go</i>

363
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:08,137
<i>I have lost my heart to you,
so be it</i>

364
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:21,648
<i>The world felt like a lonely wilderness</i>

365
00:36:22,142 --> 00:36:25,328
<i>You gave my heart a home</i>

366
00:36:25,758 --> 00:36:29,726
<i>But without you, my love</i>

367
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:36,378
<i>What is this world?</i>

368
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,684
Emily!

369
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:53,851
Esther!

370
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:56,726
Uncle Kong!

371
00:36:58,101 --> 00:36:59,309
Grandma!

372
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:04,726
Is today Sunday?

373
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:21,892
Your hair! Sister Pauline is here!

374
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:23,767
Welcome home!

375
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:26,726
Christopher, Daphne, Emily, Esther.

376
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:29,476
Emilia and my Pops.

377
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:30,934
This is the weirdo.

378
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:33,684
And the alpha of the house,
Grandma.

379
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:34,767
God bless you.

380
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:36,146
Thank you.

381
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:39,892
My cute mom. She's the source of
all the cuteness in the world.

382
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:42,601
Hello.

383
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:45,101
And this is Humpy.

384
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,684
Humpy? How come?

385
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,767
You'll soon find out.

386
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:54,726
Uncle Kong has 7 kids.

387
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:57,351
One in process.

388
00:37:57,851 --> 00:37:59,726
They're aiming for an octave!

389
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:06,101
Yeah! This is my family.

390
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:09,351
And you guys... Jay.

391
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:19,642
Amen.

392
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:23,517
Tell us that story.

393
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:25,392
I have an embarrassing Polo story.

394
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,851
No, not right now.

395
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:31,267
What's on the T-shirt? Jimi...?

396
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,684
- Hendrix?
- Is there another Jimi?

397
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,309
Do you know Hendrix?

398
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:36,684
Who doesn't?

399
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,059
Sing me a Hendrix song.

400
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,017
Which one do you know, Polo?

401
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:41,684
Who doesn't know Hendrix!

402
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:44,476
Was he a leftie?
Or a right-handed guitarist?

403
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,726
All guitarists are right!

404
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:55,851
- He was a leftie.
- Everyone knows that except you.

405
00:38:56,226 --> 00:39:00,684
Wearing that T-shirt doesn't make you
Hendrix. Get it?

406
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,684
I know, Dad.
That's why I'm a drummer.

407
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,767
Right?

408
00:39:57,574 --> 00:40:02,398
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

409
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:05,559
About your home

410
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:09,267
and your family.

411
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:12,267
Insane, bro!

412
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,434
They're all musicians.
Sure they're insane.

413
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:16,642
You're just like them!

414
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:18,767
I know.

415
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:21,559
You're very lucky.

416
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:25,767
Humpy!

417
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:33,017
I'm off. You know your room?

418
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,726
Hey, Polo.

419
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:40,934
Thanks, buddy.

420
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:45,642
Eat my shorts!

421
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:02,642
<i>Why only one song?</i>

422
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:05,851
<i>Compose a 100 songs.</i>

423
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:09,517
<i>Till then don't even think
of Sophie.</i>

424
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:31,652
<i>As time passed</i>

425
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:35,860
<i>Jay began writing songs.</i>

426
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:52,652
<i>And slowly</i>

427
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:56,569
<i>Shillong grew on him.</i>

428
00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:25,777
<i>With each passing day,</i>

429
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,194
<i> song by song, we were getting
closer to being together.</i>

430
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:48,985
<i>But then, all of a sudden
his inspiration dried up.</i>

431
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:56,527
<i>That's when his life took
a new turn.</i>

432
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,652
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

433
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:20,652
Polo!

434
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:21,944
Chandi?

435
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:23,319
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

436
00:43:23,444 --> 00:43:24,360
- You are...?
- Jay.

437
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:26,235
Jay, welcome to Shillong, bro.

438
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,610
Bijoy! Drummer.

439
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:29,777
Piano.

440
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:31,444
You're the Momos?

441
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,110
You guys are good.

442
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:37,735
But good enough or not
is for her to decide.

443
00:43:38,735 --> 00:43:40,277
That's how she rolls.

444
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,777
Good luck, guys.

445
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:45,069
Let's check the gear.

446
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:55,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

447
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:59,652
give it up for Sheila,
the jazz queen of Shillong.

448
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:07,652
<i>How do I describe...</i>

449
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:15,444
<i>...our mad, fleeting love story?</i>

450
00:44:19,444 --> 00:44:27,402
<i>Built on promises of forever</i>

451
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:43,027
<i>Then one day she reappeared</i>

452
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:49,527
<i>Left me for dead</i>

453
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:54,444
<i>Now let me finish my story</i>

454
00:44:57,652 --> 00:45:01,819
<i>If you don't love me</i>

455
00:45:08,235 --> 00:45:10,735
<i>I'll put a bullet through your heart</i>

456
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,402
<i>If you don't love me</i>

457
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:43,569
<i>Go to sleep, the night has fallen</i>

458
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:03,235
<i>If you won't be my lover,
be my prey</i>

459
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:11,277
<i>Be my pretext to be happy again</i>

460
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:19,777
<i>Listen to me, my sweetheart</i>

461
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,985
<i>Watch out! Or I'll put a bullet
through your heart</i>

462
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:33,569
<i>Go to sleep, the night has fallen</i>

463
00:47:24,652 --> 00:47:26,194
Hear that applause?

464
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:31,985
Hey, Piano!

465
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,735
She's calling you.

466
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,527
You have a cell phone?
Put it on silent.

467
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,652
My phone is on silent.

468
00:47:54,444 --> 00:47:55,652
So?

469
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,444
Won't she call me next?

470
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:04,860
Kids, man!

471
00:49:14,735 --> 00:49:18,860
So you're the one in search
of a hundred songs?

472
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:21,235
- You know about that?
- Sit!

473
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:23,694
Everyone in Shillong knows.

474
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:25,527
Drink?

475
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:28,027
I don't drink.

476
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:33,569
And thank you for letting me

477
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:35,569
play in your band.

478
00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:47,485
- You still here?
- I'm waiting.

479
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,027
Go home.

480
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:53,777
He'll be out when he's written
a hundred songs.

481
00:49:57,277 --> 00:49:58,860
Do you play classical music?

482
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:02,343
For those unfamiliar with it, yes.

483
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:07,069
But I've never had the guts to play
for those who know classical music.

484
00:50:07,652 --> 00:50:11,485
Classical music is for people
who like rules.

485
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:16,985
Jazz is for the living. The fearless.

486
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:28,652
You want to be a composer?

487
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:30,401
Yes.

488
00:50:30,481 --> 00:50:32,235
Where did you learn music?

489
00:50:42,777 --> 00:50:46,027
Farrukh, where the hell are you?

490
00:50:46,652 --> 00:50:49,485
Timing is the mark
of a good piano tuner.

491
00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:51,444
Hey, come here!

492
00:50:51,694 --> 00:50:53,860
Your father forbade you coming here.

493
00:50:53,985 --> 00:50:55,069
Shall I call him now?

494
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:57,615
Remember what happened the other day?

495
00:50:57,735 --> 00:51:02,402
- But I'm a customer.
- Customer? What do you want to buy?

496
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,444
How many music lessons a month?

497
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,347
- Five.
- How long is each lesson?

498
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,327
An hour.

499
00:51:19,194 --> 00:51:20,402
What's this?

500
00:51:20,652 --> 00:51:22,360
Fees for five minutes.

501
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,911
Please ask him to teach me.

502
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:28,777
Go on!

503
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:02,610
<i>Daddy says music is a bad thing.</i>

504
00:52:03,444 --> 00:52:05,652
<i>I must stay away from it.</i>

505
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:12,194
Have you met Rahul?

506
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,027
I've been teaching him
since he was ten.

507
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:18,402
He's blind.

508
00:52:19,194 --> 00:52:20,944
But he's got wings.

509
00:52:21,777 --> 00:52:26,235
In life, feeling is more important
than merely seeing.

510
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,527
That's what music teaches us.

511
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,277
I'm off.

512
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:38,735
Tanay is waiting for me.

513
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:41,860
- Where are you going?
- Basketball practice.

514
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:44,027
So early?

515
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:47,235
There's a tournament.

516
00:54:17,652 --> 00:54:19,360
What time did they call John?

517
00:54:19,485 --> 00:54:22,277
John's a lazy guy.

518
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:28,652
- Good morning.
- Morning, Pops.

519
00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:30,574
"Aberrant?" What's that?

520
00:54:30,694 --> 00:54:32,110
A band in Shillong, Pops.

521
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,902
- You know Imti?
- Which Imti?

522
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:38,694
Pops, why must you always pick on me?

523
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,652
Lona's there. So's Jay.

524
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,777
Lona's been practicing all morning.

525
00:54:42,902 --> 00:54:43,777
And your friend Jay?

526
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:46,402
He's gone to the jazz club.

527
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,860
What were you doing? Sleeping!

528
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,652
Jay's at Red Mascara?

529
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:54,235
Yes, you were asleep.
Go back to sleep.

530
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,944
This is my father's collection.

531
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,235
Gershwin, Miller, Peterson.

532
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,652
The secrets of many jazz greats
are hidden here.

533
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:23,277
Come here any time you want.

534
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:35,860
<i>One song?</i>

535
00:56:36,402 --> 00:56:37,652
Compose a 100 songs.

536
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:41,652
<i>Hundred songs!</i>

537
00:56:53,652 --> 00:56:54,652
What's the key?

538
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:57,652
E-flat major.

539
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,155
Re-harmonise. Opening in E-flat.
1625, now B-flat.

540
00:57:01,235 --> 00:57:03,527
- Now what can you add to it?
- C-7 flat 9.

541
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:04,944
- F minor?
- 7.

542
00:57:05,277 --> 00:57:06,280
- B-flat?
- 7.

543
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,777
- Or?
- E-flat 9.

544
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,989
So play the octaves by the end,
full spread chords.

545
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:13,027
Double melody with your left hand.
G-flat diminished, B diminished.

546
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:15,110
G-flat with an F in the bass
or F minor 7?

547
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:17,735
Tritone substitute B7 with a...

548
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:21,069
A sharp...9?

549
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,235
Now that's how you turn on a woman.

550
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,027
Play it!

551
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,277
I'm listening.

552
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:41,542
<i>Jay misses you a lot, too.</i>

553
00:57:44,013 --> 00:57:46,334
Sophie, don't cry now.

554
00:57:46,927 --> 00:57:49,750
Tell you what. Come here.

555
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,875
Come on Sunday. I'm here
and so is Jay.

556
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:56,542
<i>When you come to Shillong, you'll meet
the whole gang, Humpy, Pops.</i>

557
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,459
Just come.

558
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:01,209
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

559
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:02,625
Polo!

560
00:58:06,508 --> 00:58:07,493
OK, Sophie,

561
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:10,417
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

562
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:16,542
Pops, where's the drum key?

563
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,209
In the blue box.

564
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,667
You OK, you rascal?

565
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,459
You're mad at me?

566
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:29,750
That was last week.

567
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:32,250
I just don't care anymore.

568
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,542
By the way, Sophie misses you
a lot.

569
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,292
I miss her too.

570
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:43,500
Is that why you're not taking her calls?

571
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,792
You know I'm busy.

572
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:53,078
Yeah, you are.

573
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:57,542
With Sheila.

574
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:02,334
Meaning?

575
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:04,875
I don't know the ways of the world.

576
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,000
But it's clear as day.

577
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:20,542
Y'know something?

578
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,334
Forget it.

579
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:32,875
<i>Will someone tell me?</i>

580
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:36,709
<i>How this heart of mine...</i>

581
00:59:37,176 --> 00:59:40,542
<i>...can find you again?</i>

582
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:52,709
<i>Darling, come back to me</i>

583
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:56,674
<i>I'll put the past behind us</i>

584
00:59:57,417 --> 01:00:00,500
<i>The power of love
forgives bygone sorrows</i>

585
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:08,505
<i>Come, let's walk together again...</i>

586
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:11,875
<i>...grasping the hand of the wind</i>

587
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:16,584
<i>Let's fly far away
from troubled cities</i>

588
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:26,542
<i>If you don't love me</i>

589
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:33,750
<i>I'll put a bullet through your heart</i>

590
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:05,459
<i>Go to sleep, the night has fallen</i>

591
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:23,209
You've been practicing, eh?

592
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,125
My playing was anger,

593
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,584
yours was talent.

594
01:03:29,834 --> 01:03:31,417
You've become a jazz drummer.

595
01:03:34,584 --> 01:03:36,250
A jazz drummer?

596
01:03:41,424 --> 01:03:42,959
You clown!

597
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,542
You OK, you rascal?

598
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:54,417
What's up?

599
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:56,084
Where are you going?

600
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,084
Polo!

601
01:04:07,904 --> 01:04:10,417
Janice, Jay.

602
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:20,792
Show!

603
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:29,422
You're getting married?

604
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:33,125
What a gig!
That was some insane playing.

605
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,792
- Polo's getting married.
- Another one bites the dust, bro!

606
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,792
I'm so happy for you.

607
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,084
Group hug, guys!

608
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:05,959
Where's Sheila?

609
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,462
It'll get late so we'll crash
at Janice's.

610
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,584
Hey, Polo!

611
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,500
I'll call you back.

612
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,625
When did you get here?

613
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,709
You didn't come and see us.
Everyone was asking after you.

614
01:05:27,959 --> 01:05:30,334
- All good?
- Same old stuff, man.

615
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:33,542
Same old.

616
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,875
Let's party tonight.

617
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,417
Janice, let's go. It's late.

618
01:05:43,459 --> 01:05:47,917
Don't be late. Be sure to drag
Polo along with you. OK, bye.

619
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:54,000
Polo.

620
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,209
What are you doing here?

621
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:03,250
Looking for you.

622
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:07,125
So this is where you hang out.

623
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,667
You're getting married.

624
01:06:15,584 --> 01:06:16,959
Oh, man!

625
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:19,375
- Miss you, bro.
- Same here.

626
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,542
Check this guy.

627
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:25,959
Come here.

628
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,422
- Come here!
- What's wrong, sir?

629
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:30,167
Shut up and come here.

630
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:32,505
Put your hands up! What's that?

631
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,417
- A wallet, sir.
- Turn!

632
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,209
Check him.

633
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:38,500
You too!

634
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,000
Quick!

635
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,334
Put your hands up.

636
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:46,750
What's in here?

637
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:48,334
A phone, sir.

638
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:50,584
- Come on, move it.
- Move.

639
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:52,917
Come here. Quick!

640
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,500
They're clean.

641
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:27,209
Want it back?

642
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:29,834
So you want it back?

643
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,709
Take him away!

644
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:34,250
Polo!

645
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:35,959
Polo!

646
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,459
Keep moving.

647
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,709
Get him here.

648
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,542
You know him?

649
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,209
No, sir.

650
01:08:00,334 --> 01:08:01,459
And him?

651
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,417
An old friend.

652
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:06,590
Friend? You make friends like these?

653
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,375
OK. Get going!

654
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:18,220
Go! Take him too.

655
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,500
Sheila-ji.

656
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:40,875
The police were here.

657
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:43,292
Really?

658
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,167
Party's cancelled.

659
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,834
Everyone's gone home.

660
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:59,542
Do you want to...stay for coffee?

661
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,834
In such situations...

662
01:09:08,084 --> 01:09:10,459
...coffee doesn't really mean coffee.

663
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,792
I really need some coffee.
I need to sober up.

664
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:23,959
So you can drink again?

665
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:26,959
Exactly!

666
01:09:56,834 --> 01:10:01,167
We've been here for two hours.
Let us go home.

667
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,959
Hey, honey.

668
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:11,917
Something's happened.
I want you to sit down.

669
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,167
Get her bag.

670
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:16,334
Sit down.

671
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:18,000
Take a deep breath.

672
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:20,375
Chandi, where are you?

673
01:10:21,252 --> 01:10:22,750
Who's at the club?

674
01:10:23,459 --> 01:10:26,542
I know Jay's there.
But he's not picking up.

675
01:10:28,084 --> 01:10:29,667
Hey, you! Come here.

676
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:35,584
Your name is Polo, right?

677
01:10:36,959 --> 01:10:38,917
Something's happened to your friend.

678
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,584
<i>I hate it when I'm right</i>

679
01:10:49,459 --> 01:10:51,500
<i>about everything that's wrong.</i>

680
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,375
Aaron.

681
01:10:57,584 --> 01:11:00,417
I hate to be the one
to say I told you so.

682
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:51,834
<i>Distances should never
be trusted.</i>

683
01:12:56,048 --> 01:12:59,709
<i>They often lead to the worst mistakes.</i>

684
01:13:44,363 --> 01:13:45,621
Only one?

685
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:01,121
Is he conscious?

686
01:15:01,394 --> 01:15:03,538
No, sir. He's high.

687
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:11,996
Want more drugs?

688
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:40,121
Music is a religion in Shillong.

689
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:44,079
There's no place for a man like you.

690
01:15:52,746 --> 01:15:55,579
<i>There was something
between us once.</i>

691
01:15:56,288 --> 01:15:57,871
<i>But now,</i>

692
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,496
<i>Only silence remains.</i>

693
01:16:34,413 --> 01:16:36,079
Methamphetamine.

694
01:16:37,454 --> 01:16:38,871
Know what that is?

695
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:41,996
Crystal meth. Heard of it?

696
01:16:42,788 --> 01:16:45,621
There was so much meth
in your friend's blood,

697
01:16:45,746 --> 01:16:47,079
forget driving,

698
01:16:47,538 --> 01:16:49,788
he shouldn't have been
let out of the house.

699
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:56,496
- And driving with Sheila.
- Jay isn't like that. He's clean.

700
01:16:57,204 --> 01:16:59,079
So this report is wrong?

701
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:03,079
How did crystal meth get into
his blood?

702
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:07,663
Because of me.

703
01:17:11,746 --> 01:17:12,829
Hey, Polo!

704
01:17:12,954 --> 01:17:14,329
Let's party.

705
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:16,954
- We're doing just that.
- Partying?

706
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:18,788
You're getting married, bro.

707
01:17:18,913 --> 01:17:21,079
I'm talking LSD and...

708
01:17:21,952 --> 01:17:23,829
I've got a surprise for you.

709
01:17:26,204 --> 01:17:27,163
What's up?

710
01:17:27,349 --> 01:17:28,538
Remember him?

711
01:17:29,871 --> 01:17:30,788
Hand it over!

712
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:33,746
Welcome to Shillong, Polo!

713
01:17:34,454 --> 01:17:35,746
It's strong. Go easy.

714
01:17:51,788 --> 01:17:52,663
Polo!

715
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:57,371
Turn around.

716
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:07,746
Do you want to stay for coffee?

717
01:18:25,913 --> 01:18:26,871
Chandi, where are you?

718
01:18:26,996 --> 01:18:29,413
Jay's not picking up.

719
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:36,038
You should be ashamed of yourself.

720
01:18:37,204 --> 01:18:39,746
You've poisoned your own brother.

721
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:43,413
Know the effects of such
a high dose?

722
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:45,788
Psychosis.

723
01:18:46,746 --> 01:18:47,746
Seizures.

724
01:18:48,163 --> 01:18:49,621
Brain hemorrhage.

725
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:53,163
I can't help him.

726
01:18:55,788 --> 01:18:58,288
Please, sir.

727
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:08,288
Please.

728
01:19:18,746 --> 01:19:19,788
There's one option.

729
01:19:22,829 --> 01:19:26,996
We could declare him an addict.

730
01:19:27,788 --> 01:19:29,746
He'll be sent to rehab.

731
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:34,288
He'd have to serve the full term
and undergo treatment.

732
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:36,704
Rehab is better than jail.

733
01:19:39,788 --> 01:19:43,079
I'll get you a lawyer.
I hope you can afford him.

734
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:47,371
I can't believe you're Khagen's son.

735
01:19:58,788 --> 01:20:01,193
We treat many addicts here.

736
01:20:01,371 --> 01:20:03,371
The patient is on his way
to room 208.

737
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:18,236
We understand addiction is not
merely substance abuse,

738
01:20:19,406 --> 01:20:20,736
it's an illness.

739
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:26,038
The visitors' form. You'll get
a date to see him.

740
01:20:27,163 --> 01:20:29,288
The canteen closes at 7.30pm.

741
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,871
No sleeping on the premises.

742
01:20:37,788 --> 01:20:40,121
<i>Why me? Why?</i>

743
01:20:40,371 --> 01:20:41,663
<i>What have I done?</i>

744
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:44,083
What have I done?

745
01:20:44,163 --> 01:20:46,454
Why am I here?

746
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:48,947
<i>Tell me what I've done!</i>

747
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:19,538
<i>Lovers must endure this test</i>

748
01:21:21,788 --> 01:21:25,121
<i>The reward is love, darling</i>

749
01:21:26,704 --> 01:21:30,746
<i>Without you, laughter is wasted</i>

750
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:36,746
<i>Burning helplessly...</i>

751
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:43,996
<i>...is a voiceless volcano</i>

752
01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:50,163
<i>A benevolent volcano</i>

753
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:17,704
Love has turned her head.

754
01:22:18,454 --> 01:22:21,663
<i>Keep an eye on her.
Keep her busy.</i>

755
01:22:22,788 --> 01:22:23,874
Got it.

756
01:22:23,954 --> 01:22:28,079
<i>I know yet I do not know</i>

757
01:22:29,746 --> 01:22:34,621
<i>Your absence is all I know</i>

758
01:22:35,746 --> 01:22:40,704
<i>Why do rivers of light
flow in my path?</i>

759
01:22:41,746 --> 01:22:46,746
<i>Why does darkness hold me
in its embrace?</i>

760
01:22:47,746 --> 01:22:49,249
<i>You know...</i>

761
01:22:49,329 --> 01:22:52,288
<i>You should know</i>

762
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:58,329
<i>The anguish of separation</i>

763
01:23:00,663 --> 01:23:04,746
<i>A voiceless volcano</i>

764
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:11,704
<i>A benevolent volcano</i>

765
01:23:45,746 --> 01:23:50,121
<i>A voiceless volcano</i>

766
01:24:17,413 --> 01:24:19,746
<i>My world is on fire</i>

767
01:24:23,371 --> 01:24:25,579
<i>Without you, I burn</i>

768
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:34,047
<i>You're far away yet so close</i>

769
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:40,538
<i>Though we're far apart,
your memories burn like a volcano</i>

770
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:49,704
<i>A voiceless volcano</i>

771
01:24:53,413 --> 01:24:56,621
<i>A benevolent volcano</i>

772
01:25:37,746 --> 01:25:38,788
I know.

773
01:25:39,871 --> 01:25:41,496
I've been watching you.

774
01:25:42,204 --> 01:25:45,121
When a wedding band goes by
you run to the window,

775
01:25:45,788 --> 01:25:47,913
or when you hear a flute seller.

776
01:25:48,621 --> 01:25:51,788
You listen on the sly to our neighbours
chanting prayers.

777
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:54,746
How many times have I told you?

778
01:25:55,663 --> 01:25:58,079
You got a beating last time,
remember?

779
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:03,704
You liked it? Me neither.
So why do you still do it?

780
01:26:09,204 --> 01:26:12,329
Music has ruined our family.

781
01:26:13,746 --> 01:26:15,746
It's taken everything from us.

782
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,746
Don't make the same mistake I made.

783
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:22,204
Stay away from it.

784
01:26:26,371 --> 01:26:27,371
Promise?

785
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:49,871
<i>I cancelled my wedding.</i>

786
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:53,788
<i>I had no idea things
would turn so bad.</i>

787
01:26:56,746 --> 01:26:59,496
<i>- I know it was all my fault.
- No. </i>

788
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:02,746
It's not your fault. It's mine.

789
01:27:05,038 --> 01:27:06,538
I was warned

790
01:27:07,163 --> 01:27:08,746
by my father.

791
01:27:11,746 --> 01:27:12,954
But,

792
01:27:15,913 --> 01:27:17,746
I was deceitful.

793
01:27:20,329 --> 01:27:22,954
I learned music in secret.
On the sly.

794
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:27,954
Look where it's got me.

795
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:34,579
It is an addiction.

796
01:27:35,204 --> 01:27:37,871
Father used to call music "a drug".

797
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:45,371
Now, look. They're trying to cure
my addiction.

798
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,829
Father was right.

799
01:27:48,871 --> 01:27:50,913
I wasn't made for music.

800
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:57,871
Music is not for me.

801
01:28:00,746 --> 01:28:02,788
Don't say that.

802
01:28:04,204 --> 01:28:06,288
I've spoken to the judges.

803
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:09,788
The band members have vouched
for you.

804
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:13,079
It'll be fine.

805
01:28:37,954 --> 01:28:41,746
In every person's life,
there is something

806
01:28:42,204 --> 01:28:45,746
that can become the purpose
of their lives.

807
01:28:46,913 --> 01:28:50,788
Sometimes that thing is not
what one needs,

808
01:28:51,413 --> 01:28:53,746
but what one desires.

809
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:56,329
There was once a saint.

810
01:28:59,496 --> 01:29:03,079
<i>They say he fell in love
with a courtesan.</i>

811
01:29:05,163 --> 01:29:07,579
<i>But the courtesan spurned him.</i>

812
01:29:08,038 --> 01:29:12,829
<i>She said: "Why live in the
confined cage of desire?</i>

813
01:29:14,454 --> 01:29:17,621
<i>"If you wish, you can fly
in the open skies</i>

814
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:23,163
<i>"You can reach the highest peaks
that we were born to touch."</i>

815
01:29:26,038 --> 01:29:27,788
<i>He wept profusely.</i>

816
01:29:28,704 --> 01:29:30,788
<i>He put his eyes out.</i>

817
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:36,371
<i>And his love turned to devotion.</i>

818
01:29:37,788 --> 01:29:41,454
<i>It turned into a thousand songs
and poems.</i>

819
01:29:50,584 --> 01:29:54,204
<i>The path of Truth is strewn
with obstacles.</i>

820
01:29:56,704 --> 01:30:02,079
But no matter how hard it is,
we must walk that path.

821
01:30:03,371 --> 01:30:05,954
We must make a fresh start.

822
01:30:07,204 --> 01:30:09,788
Because life and death,

823
01:30:10,746 --> 01:30:15,871
and the afterlife
all depend on one thing

824
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:22,146
that we awaken the light within us.

825
01:30:40,538 --> 01:30:41,788
Sophie!

826
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:44,579
Sophie!

827
01:30:53,288 --> 01:30:54,788
You're welcome!

828
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:03,704
<i>A voiceless volcano</i>

829
01:31:30,496 --> 01:31:32,954
<i>My world is on fire</i>

830
01:31:36,538 --> 01:31:39,038
<i>Without you, I burn</i>

831
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:44,913
<i>You're far away yet so close</i>

832
01:31:45,204 --> 01:31:50,079
<i>Today I feel like screaming
my lungs out at death.</i>

833
01:31:55,871 --> 01:31:58,913
<i>How close death feels to me.</i>

834
01:32:01,121 --> 01:32:04,621
<i>Only it can heal my wounds.</i>

835
01:32:27,621 --> 01:32:29,704
<i>How is it possible?</i>

836
01:32:45,163 --> 01:32:48,829
<i>Is this really my Jay?</i>

837
01:32:55,704 --> 01:32:57,371
<i>This is not Jay.</i>

838
01:33:12,121 --> 01:33:13,788
<i>This is not Jay.</i>

839
01:34:11,829 --> 01:34:13,663
<i>He threw it all away.</i>

840
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:18,121
<i>His dreams.</i>

841
01:34:18,288 --> 01:34:19,746
<i>His future.</i>

842
01:34:20,579 --> 01:34:21,746
<i>His songs.</i>

843
01:34:22,496 --> 01:34:23,496
<i>My songs.</i>

844
01:34:24,121 --> 01:34:25,454
<i>Everything.</i>

845
01:34:39,371 --> 01:34:41,413
<i>There was nothing left in him.</i>

846
01:34:46,371 --> 01:34:48,038
<i>Not even life.</i>

847
01:37:26,598 --> 01:37:28,764
You have a very interesting story.

848
01:37:30,473 --> 01:37:34,973
You were in search of a hundred songs,
but slipped into an abyss.

849
01:37:36,264 --> 01:37:40,098
But you're lucky you still have
those songs inside you.

850
01:37:43,889 --> 01:37:45,473
I'm empty inside.

851
01:37:47,431 --> 01:37:51,973
A song can never be separated
from its creator.

852
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:01,264
Music has greater strength
than words and thoughts.

853
01:38:05,306 --> 01:38:10,473
Music is the last bit of magic left
in this world.

854
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,889
Do you believe in magic?

855
01:39:08,681 --> 01:39:11,681
I've waited years for this moment.

856
01:39:42,756 --> 01:39:43,981
Your mother.

857
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:48,848
She's your mother.

858
01:39:52,889 --> 01:39:56,098
She loved you even before
you were born.

859
01:39:57,889 --> 01:40:00,348
<i>But the poor woman could never tell you.</i>

860
01:40:04,556 --> 01:40:06,514
<i>She had a beautiful voice.</i>

861
01:40:07,223 --> 01:40:10,473
<i>Make my life complete</i>

862
01:40:15,014 --> 01:40:17,056
<i>Your father fell in love
the moment he heard her sing.</i>

863
01:40:17,348 --> 01:40:20,431
<i>Make my life complete</i>

864
01:40:21,848 --> 01:40:25,681
<i>I can no longer wait</i>

865
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:37,764
<i>But he was already engaged</i>

866
01:40:40,473 --> 01:40:42,431
<i>to his boss's daughter.</i>

867
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:58,014
<i>Sai, come...</i>

868
01:40:58,348 --> 01:41:01,681
<i>...fulfil my dreams</i>

869
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,514
<i>Make my life complete</i>

870
01:41:13,681 --> 01:41:18,670
<i>I can no longer wait</i>

871
01:41:28,019 --> 01:41:31,431
<i>Sai, You are my guide</i>

872
01:41:34,918 --> 01:41:38,719
<i>You are the meaning of my dreams</i>

873
01:41:42,973 --> 01:41:46,139
<i>You belong to God.
And God belongs to You</i>

874
01:41:50,431 --> 01:41:53,139
<i>O Lord of Shirdi</i>

875
01:41:54,143 --> 01:41:56,723
<i>You are my benefactor</i>

876
01:41:57,348 --> 01:42:01,431
<i>When his fiancée discovered
your father loved another,</i>

877
01:42:02,056 --> 01:42:03,764
<i>she could not bear it.</i>

878
01:42:34,879 --> 01:42:40,431
<i>I see Your face in every face</i>

879
01:42:53,366 --> 01:42:58,264
<i>Unveil the Divine for us all</i>

880
01:43:00,904 --> 01:43:07,348
<i>Come, restore our shattered
lives today, Sai</i>

881
01:43:08,723 --> 01:43:13,342
<i>While your mother's success
was scaling new heights,</i>

882
01:43:14,848 --> 01:43:17,514
<i>your father's business
was collapsing.</i>

883
01:43:24,604 --> 01:43:28,556
<i>You are the meaning of my dreams</i>

884
01:43:30,723 --> 01:43:35,005
<i>Sai, come, fulfil my dreams</i>

885
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:38,514
Your daughter sings so well.

886
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:52,264
<i>Resentment slowly grew
in your father's heart.</i>

887
01:44:01,431 --> 01:44:03,723
<i>He became jealous of your mother.</i>

888
01:44:09,764 --> 01:44:13,734
<i>You belong to God.
And God belongs to you.</i>

889
01:44:22,556 --> 01:44:24,973
Congratulations. Great news!

890
01:44:25,764 --> 01:44:26,973
She needs to rest.

891
01:44:27,098 --> 01:44:28,764
No more shows from now.

892
01:44:28,889 --> 01:44:31,181
<i>He forbade her from singing.</i>

893
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:52,517
You look lovely. Stay well.

894
01:44:56,392 --> 01:45:01,517
The President's office called.
They've invited her to sing.

895
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:04,934
Then decline.

896
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,767
No point asking.

897
01:45:10,392 --> 01:45:15,642
<i>Soon enough he imposed his will
on her.</i>

898
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:18,809
<i>He became filled with bitterness.</i>

899
01:45:19,184 --> 01:45:25,559
<i>He was under the illusion that music
had caused his ruin.</i>

900
01:45:33,850 --> 01:45:35,559
<i>Your mother gave up singing.</i>

901
01:45:38,017 --> 01:45:40,100
<i>But sometimes she'd sing to you.</i>

902
01:45:40,506 --> 01:45:43,886
<i>May you sound like Lord Krishna's
flute</i>

903
01:45:45,434 --> 01:45:49,392
<i>May you move us like a song
of prayer</i>

904
01:45:51,142 --> 01:45:53,934
<i>May you lace the words
of the Guru</i>

905
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:57,184
<i>She sang hoping you would remember
the tune.</i>

906
01:45:57,392 --> 01:46:00,017
<i>Are you a sweet Holy Verse?</i>

907
01:46:02,017 --> 01:46:04,642
<i>You are my moon</i>

908
01:46:07,309 --> 01:46:10,892
<i>You are my beloved song</i>

909
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:17,142
<i>May you be the most tuneful...</i>

910
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,392
You have no respect for me.

911
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:48,193
I asked for only one thing.

912
01:46:53,434 --> 01:46:54,662
Why?

913
01:46:55,212 --> 01:46:56,767
How dare you sing!

914
01:47:00,392 --> 01:47:01,437
I forbade you.

915
01:47:01,517 --> 01:47:04,017
There'll be no singing in this house.

916
01:47:05,767 --> 01:47:07,482
It stops now!

917
01:47:19,184 --> 01:47:21,132
No more music!

918
01:47:59,786 --> 01:48:04,756
<i>As soon as you were born,
your father banished me.</i>

919
01:48:08,706 --> 01:48:12,176
<i>But I promised your mother</i>

920
01:48:13,584 --> 01:48:16,517
<i>that I'd always watch over you.</i>

921
01:48:25,288 --> 01:48:26,400
<i>Look.</i>

922
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:32,767
<i>You can still see her fingers
playing a tune.</i>

923
01:48:40,434 --> 01:48:43,309
You have your mother's eyes.

924
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:53,358
It feels as though she's here,
in front of me.

925
01:49:56,932 --> 01:49:58,600
Is everything in order?

926
01:50:36,999 --> 01:50:38,166
And now?

927
01:50:44,541 --> 01:50:46,916
There's a tune in my mind.

928
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:48,999
Can I finish it?

929
01:50:51,874 --> 01:50:53,124
Now?

930
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:55,082
Here?

931
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:11,582
Yes?

932
01:51:12,777 --> 01:51:13,929
I have something for Ricky.

933
01:51:14,124 --> 01:51:15,624
He's on air.

934
01:51:19,249 --> 01:51:20,166
Your name?

935
01:51:20,749 --> 01:51:21,957
He'll understand.

936
01:51:23,249 --> 01:51:25,999
- Are you his friend?
- An old friend.

937
01:51:29,916 --> 01:51:31,749
- Mahesh!
- Yes, sir?

938
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:33,874
Where did this come from?

939
01:51:33,954 --> 01:51:36,624
- Someone left it here.
- Who did?

940
01:51:37,207 --> 01:51:38,791
He said he was your friend.

941
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,862
<i>And welcome to "Roll with...</i>

942
01:51:58,662 --> 01:51:59,662
Ricky!"

943
01:51:59,742 --> 01:52:03,999
<i>We play India's superhit songs
for you.</i>

944
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:06,249
But today's different.

945
01:52:06,957 --> 01:52:10,582
An envelope with a pen drive
arrived at my studio.

946
01:52:11,454 --> 01:52:13,541
It had only one song on it.

947
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:16,874
And no composer's name.

948
01:52:17,499 --> 01:52:19,082
<i>Just one song.</i>

949
01:52:20,124 --> 01:52:21,291
<i>Hey, listeners!</i>

950
01:52:21,666 --> 01:52:24,249
<i>Get ready to get your mind blown away!</i>

951
01:52:33,416 --> 01:52:38,832
<i>O lover, when you gave
your heart away...</i>

952
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:45,957
<i>...was it only to seek
another's heart in return?</i>

953
01:52:47,249 --> 01:52:52,961
<i>Did you drink holy water hoping
to encounter celestial beauties?</i>

954
01:52:53,041 --> 01:52:53,999
Turn it up.

955
01:52:54,124 --> 01:52:59,416
<i>What holy water was that,
O thirsty one?</i>

956
01:53:00,457 --> 01:53:05,207
<i>The life you've lived - is it worthy
of the gift of life, my friend?</i>

957
01:53:07,457 --> 01:53:13,041
<i>You lived a life of avarice.
Is that a worthy life?</i>

958
01:53:21,124 --> 01:53:26,916
<i>You pray to the Almighty
only for your own needs</i>

959
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:32,082
<i>What prayer was that,
O spiritual one?</i>

960
01:53:34,832 --> 01:53:39,041
<i>Destroying faith, you built
a palace in its place</i>

961
01:53:41,749 --> 01:53:46,582
<i>What did you build, O craftsman?</i>

962
01:53:48,499 --> 01:53:52,624
<i>The life you've lived - is it worthy
of the gift of life, my friend?</i>

963
01:53:52,874 --> 01:53:54,916
That's Jay!

964
01:53:55,438 --> 01:54:00,408
<i>You lived a life of avarice.
Is that a worthy life?</i>

965
01:54:01,738 --> 01:54:04,874
<i>No one knows how Ricky
got this song.</i>

966
01:54:04,999 --> 01:54:09,127
<i>No one, not even Ricky,
knows who composed it.</i>

967
01:54:09,207 --> 01:54:14,888
<i>Some talk of God,
others talk of love</i>

968
01:54:16,018 --> 01:54:21,499
<i>Yet none have spoken
of a nurturing mother</i>

969
01:54:22,874 --> 01:54:29,124
<i>Neither sang Kabir, nor spoke Bulleh</i>

970
01:54:29,874 --> 01:54:35,874
<i>But without a mother,
you are without God</i>

971
01:54:36,582 --> 01:54:42,624
<i>The life you've lived - is it worthy
of the gift of life?</i>

972
01:54:43,457 --> 01:54:49,225
<i>You lived a life of avarice.
Is that a worthy life?</i>

973
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:16,416
<i>As far back as he could remember...</i>

974
01:55:16,874 --> 01:55:20,832
<i>...his mind had been haunted
by a tune.</i>

975
01:55:23,832 --> 01:55:25,916
<i>Your mother gave up singing.</i>

976
01:55:26,749 --> 01:55:29,457
<i>Sometimes she'd sing you
a song.</i>

977
01:55:29,707 --> 01:55:33,832
<i>Hoping that you would remember
the tune.</i>

978
01:55:59,332 --> 01:56:01,541
<i>O Ma...</i>

979
01:56:02,582 --> 01:56:05,749
<i>How do I describe you?</i>

980
01:56:06,082 --> 01:56:11,166
<i>How do I repay my many debts
to you?</i>

981
01:56:12,874 --> 01:56:18,332
<i>Words fail to express
what you have given me</i>

982
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:22,749
<i>For your blessings...</i>

983
01:56:23,087 --> 01:56:25,916
<i>...I could give up my life</i>

984
01:56:26,582 --> 01:56:29,632
<i>Your dreams...</i>

985
01:56:29,999 --> 01:56:33,320
<i>...beat in my heart</i>

986
01:56:36,291 --> 01:56:38,166
<i>O Ma...</i>

987
01:56:38,582 --> 01:56:42,766
<i>God's blessings shower on me
through you</i>

988
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:04,966
<i>O lover, when you gave
your heart away...</i>

989
01:57:07,749 --> 01:57:12,504
<i>...was it only to seek
another's heart in return?</i>

990
01:57:14,584 --> 01:57:20,314
<i>Did you drink holy water hoping
to encounter celestial beauties?</i>

991
01:57:21,464 --> 01:57:26,074
<i>What holy water was that,
O thirsty one?</i>

992
01:57:28,144 --> 01:57:34,124
<i>The life you've lived - is it worthy
of the gift of life, my friend?</i>

993
01:57:35,207 --> 01:57:40,694
<i>You lived a life of avarice.
Is that a worthy life?</i>

994
01:58:20,332 --> 01:58:23,166
Prabhakar sir, ready when you are.

995
01:58:29,416 --> 01:58:33,796
<i>This morning Chief Minister Prabhakar
posted a link on-line</i>

996
01:58:33,916 --> 01:58:36,796
<i>with the names of many
eminent personalities.</i>

997
01:58:36,876 --> 01:58:41,082
<i>Some involved in corruption,
others who sell illegal weapons.</i>

998
01:58:41,162 --> 01:58:43,291
<i>Offenders from the past 20 years
are named.</i>

999
01:58:43,457 --> 01:58:47,999
<i>The list includes 115 MLA, 55 CMs
and oil company directors.</i>

1000
01:58:48,124 --> 01:58:51,791
<i>Their contracts and emails
have been posted on-line.</i>

1001
01:58:53,874 --> 01:58:56,332
<i>I should've died in that car crash.</i>

1002
01:58:59,874 --> 01:59:01,874
<i>But even death spurned me.</i>

1003
01:59:02,874 --> 01:59:05,999
<i>Just that one song kept
playing in my head.</i>

1004
01:59:10,906 --> 01:59:13,126
"A life of avarice.
Is that a worthy life?"

1005
01:59:15,916 --> 01:59:16,999
<i>A song?</i>

1006
01:59:17,499 --> 01:59:19,707
It changed me.

1007
01:59:20,124 --> 01:59:22,207
<i>And only a song can do that.</i>

1008
01:59:23,291 --> 01:59:26,712
<i>That's why countries have a
national anthem, not a national speech.</i>

1009
01:59:28,874 --> 01:59:31,874
<i>Only music has that power.</i>

1010
01:59:33,124 --> 01:59:35,541
What have you done, Prabhakar?

1011
01:59:37,749 --> 01:59:41,207
Music is either truthful or not.

1012
01:59:41,666 --> 01:59:44,666
Your music is good,
it'll have truth some day.

1013
01:59:49,874 --> 01:59:52,041
And this song had that truth?

1014
01:59:53,207 --> 01:59:55,457
It showed me what truth is.

1015
01:59:58,332 --> 02:00:00,666
It changed my whole world.

1016
02:00:01,957 --> 02:00:03,707
<i>And now, news from India.</i>

1017
02:00:03,832 --> 02:00:08,166
A song is at the heart
of a revolution.

1018
02:00:42,874 --> 02:00:47,457
<i>A song by an anonymous composer
has brought change in the world.</i>

1019
02:01:31,582 --> 02:01:35,499
<i> He craved neither applause nor fame.</i>

1020
02:01:38,457 --> 02:01:40,124
<i>Nor was he filled with self-love.</i>

1021
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:45,166
<i>Nor was he proud of having written
a 100 songs.</i>

1022
02:01:46,166 --> 02:01:49,624
<i>All he wanted was to return home.</i>

1023
02:01:55,124 --> 02:01:58,541
<i>Because his true home was music.</i>

1024
02:02:05,207 --> 02:02:07,457
<i>And in music,</i>

1025
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:11,291
<i>he'd be forever protected.</i>

1026
02:03:22,582 --> 02:03:28,457
<i>As far as he could remember,
he was haunted by a tune.</i>

1027
02:03:31,416 --> 02:03:35,666
<i>An untouched, unspoken light</i>

1028
02:03:37,207 --> 02:03:40,906
<i>that tore through all the darkness.</i>
