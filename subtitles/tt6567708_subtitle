1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,360
What has happened to this city?

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,400
Where there are ashes somewhere..

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,920
..there's also smoke all around.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,320
Why does no one say anything?

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,400
Why are people inhaling
this smoke?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,840
That's enough now.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,360
Smoking is harmful
for your health.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,400
Smoking in public areas
is strictly prohibited.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,680
Those who break the law
will be punished.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,840
Don't smoke nor let anyone smoke.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,280
Smoking will cost you dearly.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
Who doesn't want to be happy?

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,240
But what is the cost
of that happiness?

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,280
Smoking can prove to
be very harmful.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,080
Smoking in injurious to health.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,920
Smoking is injurious to people
close to you too.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,560
Smoking will cost you dearly.

18
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,720
"The problems are constant."

19
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,320
"They are always
going be around."

20
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,240
"The pain is always
going to be there."

21
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,880
"It's known that the pain
is going to be there."

22
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,600
"Always and forever."

23
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,280
"I am with you,
forget all your worries."

24
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,760
"I am with you,
forget all your worries."

25
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,160
"Come on, we'll handle it."

26
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,840
"Come on, we'll handle it."

27
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,960
"You only live once."

28
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,040
"You only live once."

29
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
"Come on, we'll handle it."

30
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,360
"Come on, we'll handle it."

31
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,680
"I became famous in
the college campus."

32
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,400
"I bunked my lectures and was
chilling in the canteen."

33
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,360
"I was busy sipping tea and
chatting on Whatsapp."

34
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,720
"I was so busy impressing
my girlfriend..

35
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
..that I forgot about
my practical."

36
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,760
"Come on, we'll handle it."

37
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,920
"You only live once."

38
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,040
"You only live once."

39
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,200
"Come on, we'll handle it."

40
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,160
Hey guys.

41
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
Did you see a girl passing by?

42
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,120
Uncle, why do you think
we are standing here?

43
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,200
Just to see girls passing by.

44
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
Was this the girl?

45
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,760
Uncle, we didn't see her face.

46
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,400
But I definitely saw the
tattoo on her leg.

47
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,680
Uncle, I only saw the
tattoo on her back.

48
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Uncle,
I didn't even see her face.

49
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,280
If you also wanted to see, you
should've come here before us.

50
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,920
Uncle, look at your age.

51
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,520
You are over 50 years of age and
you still haven't given up.

52
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,560
You are still looking around
for a girl at this age?

53
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,760
Aren't you ashamed?

54
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,600
You should feel embarrassed.

55
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,720
You fool. I am her father.

56
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,960
We got saved. Uncle, would have
beaten us up black and blue.

57
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,320
But how would we know..

58
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
..that a girl's father
must be looking..

59
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,640
..for her around everywhere?

60
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,600
I don't understand, what might
the girl have possibly done?

61
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,440
That's true.

62
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,200
Forget all that,
her father was really dangerous.

63
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,840
We got saved by a fluke.

64
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
"Phone's ring tone."

65
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,600
"Phone's ring tone."

66
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,680
How was it?

67
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,960
What?

68
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,520
Yes, okay.

69
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,960
What about Amber?

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,960
How about Tanki?

71
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Oh.

72
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,440
I will call you back.

73
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,040
Hang up the phone.

74
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,600
Hang up now. Hang up.

75
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,680
What happened? What's up?

76
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,960
50 rupees.

77
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,320
This Maths is betraying
me like a girlfriend.

78
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,840
I just don't seem to get it.
-Why?

79
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
The ATKT(Allowed to keep terms)
results have come for Maths.

80
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,280
I failed.

81
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,880
Don't feel so proud.

82
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Dear,
I have been trying my luck..

83
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
..at Maths for the past 4 years.

84
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,800
You both are really lucky.

85
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,560
You passed in Maths.

86
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,440
Oh, so the grapes are sour.

87
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,080
We worked hard for it.

88
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,800
You guys act stupid when
it comes to Maths.

89
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,320
Maths needs understanding.
What do you think?

90
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,760
Lucks also needs hard work.

91
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,960
Do you get it?

92
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
I had written everything
in the exam.

93
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640
My dear friends.

94
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,720
It does as it pleases.

95
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,600
You can't hold it responsible.

96
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,360
Tanki, don't worry.

97
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,800
We will succeed in the
Maths paper this time.

98
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
We'll handle it.

99
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,400
We are good at Maths, brother.

100
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,000
No problem. We'll handle it.

101
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,760
Jigga, come in. You are here.

102
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,640
Are you all alone in the room?

103
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,800
Hey.

104
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,560
Where is charger?

105
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
Charger is taking a shower.

106
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,120
He will be out in his own time.

107
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,040
He will finish the water.

108
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
Is this a time to take a shower?

109
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,960
This is the limit.

110
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,360
Jignesh, you came in early.

111
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,080
I was thinking about you only.

112
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,960
Why would you think of
me in the bathroom?

113
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,600
Is this the time to
take a shower?

114
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,600
You guys don't take
a bath until 10am.

115
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,040
It's the "Time-Machine's"
lecture today.

116
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,440
If we are late even by a minute,
he won't let us in.

117
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,360
Jigga, we'll reach on time.

118
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,080
"Phone's ring tone."
-You stress a lot. Calm down.

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,520
"Phone's ring tone.". -The problem
is always going to be there.

120
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,240
It will be Google's phone.

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,160
Where are you?

122
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,520
Where do we start?

123
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,320
Hi Baby.

124
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,040
Where are you?

125
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,080
Baby, I just reached the hostel.

126
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
Now I am leaving for college.

127
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,240
Don't be late.

128
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
We are just leaving.
See you at our regular place.

129
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,760
At the college campus.

130
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
Outside the lobby. Bye.

131
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
Okay, bye baby.

132
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,920
See you. Love you.

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
Love you.

134
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,160
Put on some music.
We'll get in the mood.

135
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,440
What's with you?

136
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,120
He wants to listen to
songs apparently.

137
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,120
Who is taking our first lecture?

138
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,840
Komal ma'am is taking
our first lecture.

139
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,080
So you are going to
sleep in class.

140
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,160
Jignesh, I just recollected.

141
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Please halt at a medical store.
-Why?

142
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,720
I'll have to take medicine
for my headache.

143
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,520
It matters if you pay attention
to the lecture.

144
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,680
You are so lost in
Simran's dreams.

145
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,920
Do something. -You don't need
medicines for headache..

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,840
..you need it to forget her.
-That's true.

147
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,160
Please halt at the medical store.

148
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,920
Hey, please get it quickly.

149
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
Jignesh. -Yes.

150
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,800
Simran belongs to Raj.

151
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,800
Don't forget that.

152
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
When will he understand?

153
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,200
Give me 5 of that medicine.

154
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,840
Here.

155
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,760
What's this? Protection?

156
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,480
Young men like you ask
for protection..

157
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,080
..under the pretext of medicines.

158
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,480
Give me what I asked for.

159
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,160
Talking aimlessly.

160
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,920
You should have given
it to your father.

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Would have spared us your horror.

162
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,760
Listen, give me the toothpaste
and brush too.

163
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,160
Yes.

164
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,320
Here you go.

165
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,640
Should I take it in my pocket?
Give me a carry bag.

166
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,320
We don't give out carry bags.
It's banned.

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,720
What? -It's banned.

168
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,360
What exactly?

169
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,920
It's banned.

170
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,840
Oh, is that so? -Yes.

171
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,280
That's great. You follow all
the rules, is it? -Yes.

172
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,600
Give me a bill for all this.

173
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
Here you go.

174
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,200
How much do I have to pay?

175
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,920
80 rupees.

176
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
Here you go.

177
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,120
Thanks.

178
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,480
It took you so long.

179
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,280
Keep quiet.

180
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,520
I couldn't find a diaper
for your size.

181
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
What's that?

182
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,920
Rules are meant to followed
and not broken.

183
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,200
Keep this in mind.

184
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,240
Hey.

185
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,800
I can see her entire
back from here.

186
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
These days..

187
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,680
..girls might not show you face
but you can see their backs.

188
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,320
"Baby."

189
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,040
This is our Shilpi.

190
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,520
How did she find a new guy?

191
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,160
Hey. She is ours.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,680
Go and ask for her clothes.

193
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,960
You can wear it then.

194
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
It will even fit you.

195
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,280
You should have taken admission
in Computer classes.

196
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,360
You at least wouldn't have to
stand outside the class.

197
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,600
If you had taken admission
in Computer classes..

198
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,200
..you would have got the chance
to see Simran everyday.

199
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,840
That is true. Let's do something.

200
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,560
Girls don't take admission
in mechanical engineering.

201
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,520
For us, we only see men
around everywhere.

202
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,440
What did you ever
do for our class?

203
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,560
With great difficulty, we are
getting through each semester.

204
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,720
Don't worry.

205
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,360
As it is,
we are doing a Fresher's..

206
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,760
..party for the mechanical
stream.

207
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,760
You can introduce yourself
to a few girls.

208
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,120
Okay.

209
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,600
You are really concerned about
the Fresher's party, right?

210
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,760
I know everything.

211
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,920
To get introduced to girl
from Computer classes..

212
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,160
..you are putting up
a Fresher's Party.

213
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
While they are at it,
we will try to woo Riya.

214
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,120
They seem to have a
problem with it.

215
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,600
She is not just anyone.

216
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,560
Address her as sister-n-law Riya.

217
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,880
Hey, sister-in-law Riya is here.

218
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,080
Charger,
you girl is right behind.

219
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,840
Hello.

220
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,960
Hello. -How are you?

221
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,160
I am fine.

222
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,320
Look here, it's Raj.

223
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,960
He waits here for you
every single day.

224
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,520
He has been after you for
the past three years.

225
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,960
I see it everyday.

226
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,720
I am not a doctor to cure
him of his love sickness.

227
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,960
I am getting late.
I will see you during the break.

228
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Bye. -Bye.

229
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,960
Come on,
let's begin our preparation.

230
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,520
Let's go.

231
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,480
I will pee and then go to class.

232
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,240
You always have to pee.

233
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,920
Do it quickly.
We are getting late.

234
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,640
Hey.

235
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
This seems like her bottle.

236
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,080
She must be in the washroom.

237
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,200
Do you have the medicine to
clears bowel movement?

238
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,520
I always keep it with me.

239
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
What do we have to do?

240
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
I am not deaf. Speak softly.

241
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,080
She likes to keep sipping water.

242
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,000
We will add that to this
bottle of water.

243
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,600
The lecture will be fun today.

244
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,000
If we get caught,
we will be in trouble.

245
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,960
How can that be? -You keep
drinking water, don't you?

246
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,280
Do a thing, pour that medicine.
I am here. Don't worry.

247
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,920
Do it quickly.

248
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,600
Do it quickly.

249
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Come on, let's go now.

250
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,840
It's going to be fun now.

251
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,120
Hey, look your Shilpi.

252
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,160
Shilpi, do you have red
thing with you today?

253
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,680
What did you say?

254
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,560
Adi wants it.

255
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,040
Do you have a red pen? -No.

256
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,560
She is acting pricey.

257
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,400
Come on, let's go.

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,400
Good morning ma'am.

259
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,760
Good morning. Sit down.

260
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,840
"Children chattering."

261
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,160
Silence.

262
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
Today,
we will be learning about..

263
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,320
..the advantages of Java
Script and its needs.

264
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,640
Look at my hand.

265
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,520
Rahul, can you stand up?

266
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
So, tell me.

267
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,640
What did we learn yesterday?

268
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,960
Ma'am, can I answer in Gujarati?

269
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,280
In which ever language you
are comfortable in..

270
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,680
..answer in that language.

271
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,800
Ma'am, yesterday..

272
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,200
Ah..

273
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
Ah..

274
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,520
I knew it. I recollected
it just a minute ago.

275
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,880
Shut up.

276
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,400
Adi, stand up.

277
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
Tell me,
What did we learn yesterday?

278
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,120
What?

279
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Keep quiet.

280
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
What did we learn yesterday?

281
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,880
Yesterday? Yesterday!

282
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Say it.

283
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,160
Yesterday? Yesterday!

284
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,800
Yesterday?

285
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,720
Say it.

286
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,880
I know the answer but
I can't frame it.

287
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,600
Shut up.

288
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,800
Sit down.

289
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,360
Silence.
Why were you all laughing?

290
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,720
Do you understand what
discipline means?

291
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,800
You all are final year students.

292
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,800
You will have your campus
interviews in a few days.

293
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
Which company will hire you?

294
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Oh.

295
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
I hope I don't have to..

296
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,480
..give a memo out.

297
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
Maintain discipline in the class.

298
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,600
Shut up.

299
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,280
Jignesh, is this your phone
or a treasury box?

300
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,560
There are so many locks to this.

301
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,560
Dad, you won't get it.
For get it.

302
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,720
Here son, eat it.

303
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,160
Mom, I am done.

304
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
Eat properly.

305
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,920
You won't eat anything in college
then. -We have a canteen.

306
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,640
You have two friends in
the college right?

307
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,960
Ask them, how difficult it is
to manage without parents.

308
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,600
Mom,
you made me remember something.

309
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,600
I have to go to the hostel
and wake them up.

310
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,160
You have to wake them up?

311
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
Are you going to kidnap them?

312
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,480
Dad, you don't know what
I am talking about.

313
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,520
Once I go to the hostel
and wake them up..

314
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,840
..it takes an hour for us
to make it to college.

315
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,840
Come on now,
I will take your leave. Bye.

316
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
Take your bag along.

317
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,600
Okay.

318
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,920
Bye mom, bye dad. -God bless you.

319
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,840
What are you doing?
Keep that down.

320
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,640
You are yet to take the diabetes
medicine. I will get it.

321
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,200
There are two types on engines.

322
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,960
One is called petro engine
and the other..

323
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,760
May I come in, sir?
-May I come in, sir?

324
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,240
Come on in.

325
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,200
Move.

326
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,200
You are late by a minute, today.

327
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,600
Get up. I said, stand up.

328
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
Answer my questions.

329
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,560
What is the difference between
a petrol Engine..

330
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,800
..and a diesel engine?

331
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,600
You have moved on from a scooter
to a car so quickly.

332
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,680
Congratulations.

333
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,680
Sir, the diesel engine is nice.

334
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,240
What are you talking about?

335
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,440
Take the CNG.
It's 40 rupees per kilo.

336
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,520
So if your wife is coming along,
it won't be a problem.

337
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,720
Out.

338
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,080
Sir, listen. The diesel engine..

339
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,520
Get out.

340
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,120
Sir, the CNG works very smoothly.
I am telling you.

341
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,760
If you like petrol,
get the petrol one.

342
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,080
Why are you troubling
poor boys like us?

343
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,320
I said, get out.

344
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Let's go.

345
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,440
Hey.

346
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,240
Please sit. -Sir.

347
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,760
Come on, get out.

348
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,920
You make him sit in a vehicle
without engine.

349
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Let's go.

350
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,800
Popat. -They are here.

351
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,760
Why did you call me that?

352
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,720
How does that matter?

353
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,520
No matter the size,
a name is a name.

354
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,600
The smaller Popat serves
only water.

355
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,520
The bigger Popat serves tea.
Remember this.

356
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,280
So,
Big Popat, get us four half teas.

357
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,560
Hey. -Yes.

358
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,480
I am the big Popat and
He is the small Popat.

359
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,040
The big Popat will only get tea.
Do you get it?

360
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,040
Okay,
please get us four half teas.

361
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,680
Okay.

362
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,240
Do you get it?

363
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,400
Hey, you. You!

364
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,840
Hooligan!

365
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,280
Popat, give him a lollipop.

366
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
Go away.

367
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,680
Go away.

368
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,080
Finish it quickly.

369
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,120
Then we have to go to watch
a Sunny Leone movie.

370
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,520
It's going to be crowded.

371
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,960
Riya's mom dad aren't home today.

372
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,080
So, we have a different
program today.

373
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,440
It will get crowded. Let's leave.

374
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,400
Litti, do you want to join us?

375
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
Hooligan.

376
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,600
Let's go.

377
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,880
You want to eat this?

378
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,040
Come on, in. -Yes.

379
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,480
Hello.

380
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,680
Jigs, these are my cousins.

381
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,280
Gitesh. -Hello.

382
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,360
Ajay. -Hello.

383
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,760
Jimmy. -Hi.

384
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,280
Jiya. -Hi.

385
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,280
All of them know you very well.
-They know me? -Yes.

386
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
Riya always talk about you.

387
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,760
Really? -Right.

388
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,000
Please sit down.
I will get juice for you.

389
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,400
I like the couple.
-Riya, baby. -Yes.

390
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,360
You had told me that your parents
aren't home. -Yes.

391
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,800
My parents aren't home.

392
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,600
Where did they come from?

393
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,240
My parents have gone out
with my uncle and aunt.

394
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,640
But the kids are around.

395
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Please sit, I will get you juice.

396
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh God.

397
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,040
"I came here for
something else..

398
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,560
..and now I will have to adjust."

399
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
One Cheese Garlic Bread and..

400
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,400
..a Margarita Pizza.

401
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,600
Yes sir.

402
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,440
Thank God we came alone.

403
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,880
We came to see Sunny Leone.

404
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,920
What's your problem?

405
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,840
We had to get out within
15 minutes.

406
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,600
He had to pee again.

407
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,160
Remove your bag.

408
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,320
Yes.

409
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,400
Charger.

410
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,280
Someone's here to light
up your life.

411
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,040
Hey, keep it to yourself.

412
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,440
I only belong to Simran.

413
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,040
Remember this.

414
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,520
Oh wow.

415
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,320
She is classy.

416
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,640
How did this one find
such a nice girl?

417
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,400
Boys like us are so unlucky.

418
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,880
Yes, that' true.

419
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,360
When you are unlucky..

420
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,360
If we dream about Sunny Leone,
that's enough for us.

421
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
God blesses people
with such women..

422
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,040
..who are not worthy of it.

423
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,960
Fools, that's enough.

424
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,920
You have scanned her through
and through. Stop it now.

425
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,760
You just let it be.

426
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,600
What's your problem if
we are looking at her?

427
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
Eat the Pizza.

428
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,040
There's so much space and there's
so much pizza here.

429
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,800
It's okay if you don't want to
eat. -At least let me concentrate.

430
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,080
You concentrate on eating.

431
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,680
We will concentrate
on ogling at her.

432
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,080
Hey Tanki.

433
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,720
When will we get so lucky?

434
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,320
That's true.

435
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,920
Oh God.

436
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,600
Are you done? Let's go now.

437
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,840
Good morning sir.

438
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,960
Good morning sir.

439
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,000
Hey, you! Come here.

440
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,840
How many did you trap today?
-What?

441
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Tanki means how many
people have you..

442
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,360
..buttered up with 'Good
morning sir'?

443
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,360
We mean how many have
you trapped?

444
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,640
In terms of business.

445
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
How many 'Good morning'
did you sell today?

446
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,920
Grow up, guys. You are in
the last year of college.

447
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,080
Gujarati boys like you
will end of nowhere.

448
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,000
You will just be here.

449
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,440
Hey, how dare you talk
about Gujaratis?

450
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
You have no idea where
great Gujarati..

451
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,040
..men have done for themselves.

452
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
What do you think of Gujaratis?

453
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,400
The Prime Minister of India..

454
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,360
..Narendra Modi is Gujarati.

455
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,120
The one,
who threw the Britishers out..

456
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,920
..and gave India independence..

457
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,120
..that great man,
Mahatma Gandhi is Gujarati.

458
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,760
70% of the rich men in India..

459
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,680
..are Gujarati.

460
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,480
Half of our population has
reached Canada and America.

461
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,800
If you ever go to America..

462
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,360
..you will get to see an entire
society of Gujaratis.

463
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,560
The Stock Market thrives
on Gujarati.

464
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,400
If Gujaratis stop
doing business..

465
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,320
..the stock market will fall.

466
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,880
Go and find out the role of..

467
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,920
..Gujaratis in the development
of the country.

468
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,920
The world has accepted Gujarat's
development model.

469
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,320
Have you heard of Surat?

470
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,400
The amount of money
people in Surat..

471
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,280
..spend on eating and traveling..

472
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,960
..you can't do it in a year.

473
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
If you ever get a place
in a restaurant on a..

474
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,920
..weekend in Surat,
it seems like a victory.

475
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,640
Surti locho recipe
(Gujarati food)..

476
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,240
..is famous
around the world.

477
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,880
Do you know what a Locho is?

478
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,720
A fool like you will
know nothing.

479
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,400
Forget all that.
Let's talk business.

480
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
The diamond market in Surat..

481
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,760
..is famous all over the world.

482
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,360
The tourism of the
entire country..

483
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,320
..thrives on Gujaratis.

484
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,560
Get out to travel..

485
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,960
..and you will definitely find
one person who is a Gujarati.

486
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
Gujaratis have..

487
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,440
..a big heart.

488
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,960
Even if we get a holiday
for two days..

489
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,400
..Gujaratis step out to travel.

490
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,600
Take any multinational company.

491
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,920
The turnover that it
has over a year..

492
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,240
..a Gujaratis spends more
than that in the..

493
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,360
..three months before
and during Diwali.

494
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Forget all that.

495
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,200
After passing out of engineering,
you dream of having a job.

496
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,720
All the companies like Reliance..

497
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,720
..Adani, Wipro have Gujaratis
as their owner.

498
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,160
The Amul milk that made
you who you are..

499
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,520
..the owner of that company
is also a Gujarati.

500
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,640
How about that?

501
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,040
"Indian drinks Amul Milk."

502
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,480
Useless.

503
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,480
Useless.

504
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,040
These non-Gujaratis think
too much of themselves.

505
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,280
He thinks he knows everything.

506
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,200
But he doesn't know that..

507
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,240
..be it business or studies..

508
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,200
..or wooing girls..

509
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,600
..a Gujarati tops it all.

510
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,280
Forget all this. -We have our
Viva now. We have a lot to study.

511
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,160
He just keeps harping about
how much we have to study.

512
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,600
We will handle the Viva.

513
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,720
We have submissions.
Hope you remember.

514
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,680
Come on now. Time machine is in.

515
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,320
Come on.

516
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,920
Let's go.

517
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,200
I haven't made an index.

518
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,280
You are talking about
writing the index?

519
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,680
My book is still incomplete.

520
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,520
But Adi, the stationary is
out the college premise.

521
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,880
How do we go to buy it?

522
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
That's true.

523
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,600
I had so much trouble
filling this file.

524
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,400
Hey Adi, listen.

525
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,480
We will take someone's
index and certificate.

526
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,040
Then we'll see what happens.

527
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,440
What are you talking about?

528
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,320
Make him understand. If she
gets to know, you are dead.

529
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,880
Then sit with your armor.

530
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,800
Tanki, it's Komal ma'am.

531
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,880
She will fail you in
your internal exams.

532
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,880
That's true.

533
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,080
All the best. -Thank you.

534
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,640
Where is your certificate?

535
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,520
Where is the certificate in this?

536
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,560
The cow ate it.

537
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
The cow ate it?

538
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,480
What have you been reading?

539
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Newspaper.

540
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,320
I didn't read the newspaper.

541
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,000
I read our textbooks only.

542
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,480
Adi sits with the newspaper
early in the morning.

543
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,160
He doesn't give it back at all.

544
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,760
Ma'am, he's lying.

545
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,960
He looks at pictures of
women in the newspaper.

546
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,960
You are lying.
-I am not lying and.. -Shut up.

547
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,640
People like you will complete
their engineering..

548
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,040
..and sell newspapers only.

549
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,960
Next question.
What is Java Script?

550
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,800
Java?

551
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,960
Java. Java.

552
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,560
Java script?

553
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,800
Java. Java.

554
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,920
Java.

555
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,320
Let us go.

556
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Get out.

557
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,080
Thank you ma'am.

558
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,240
Ma'am,
don't forget to give us marks.

559
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,280
I said get out.
Send the next two students in.

560
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,240
"Student mumbles."

561
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,880
Jignesh and Charger
are not yet here.

562
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,200
They must have utilized
the entire..

563
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,840
..time of the Viva
& the submission.

564
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,160
I think so too.

565
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,640
They must have had it
from the professor.

566
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,680
Let's enjoy this movie.

567
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,840
Adi,
your dad doesn't know, right?

568
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,600
That the laptop he gave
you to study..

569
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,840
..is being used for
other purposes.

570
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,400
That's not so.

571
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,360
500 GB data is filled
with movies.

572
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,640
There's no space to add software.

573
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,400
Jignesh, you didn't submit?

574
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,000
No, I did the submissions.

575
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
But ma'am has given me
further corrections.

576
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,800
I will have to re-submit
post exams.

577
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,080
What happened to charger?

578
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,680
Charger, why do you look sad?

579
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
What happened?

580
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,800
I am going to talk openly today.

581
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,080
What do the professor
think of themselves?

582
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,640
She said to bring forth a novel
idea in the project.

583
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,040
Novel? This..

584
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,640
Since the past 6 months..

585
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,080
..we have been working so
hard on this project.

586
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,960
But this professor doesn't find..

587
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,520
..anything novel in this project.

588
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,680
My life is hell since I have
joined engineering.

589
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,800
As a sudden surprise..

590
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,640
..you get to know that
you have to..

591
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,280
..study Maths for two more years.

592
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,360
Wasn't it enough that
we were studying..

593
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,680
..Maths until the 12th grade?

594
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Why did they add it
to every semester?

595
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,840
It seems like a war.

596
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,400
He got crazy trying to
understand Maths.

597
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,760
The best thing is when the
exam time table is out.

598
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,320
Knowingly, they make the
time-table in such a way..

599
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,640
..that all of our vacations get
spoiled with endless studying.

600
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,960
When our entire family
is traveling..

601
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,160
..we are busy trying to figure
out the syllabus.

602
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,480
Our professors give us a list
of ten book to refer from.

603
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,080
Books that are so big.
-When we sit to refer..

604
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,400
..we don't find anything
related to our syllabus.

605
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,280
Then, finally we resort to
reading photocopies.

606
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,560
Wow, that's great.

607
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,680
Even more worse is the
day of the submission.

608
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,280
Our professors..

609
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,360
..scare us saying that
they will detain us.

610
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,520
They use it as a weapon
against us.

611
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,720
We have the first test,
then the mid-test..

612
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,400
..then the internals
and then the..

613
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,880
..submissions and external test.

614
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,520
They have made engineering
a crazy affair.

615
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,280
We stay awake all night
like night-owls.

616
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,080
Then struggle and work hard
during the entire day.

617
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,240
Even worse is the exams.

618
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,880
The topics that we have
relentlessly studied..

619
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,600
..they won't ask that.

620
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,800
They will ask us everything
that we left as an option.

621
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,600
Even more interesting..

622
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,840
..is the day of the result.

623
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,760
The subject we are confident
about, we fail in them.

624
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,520
And the subject we know we will
fail in, we pass in them.

625
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,120
All that we have confidently
studied for 6 months..

626
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,640
..is destroyed by one result.

627
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,800
No one can understand
what we go through.

628
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,560
Adi, you had a lot to ask, right?

629
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
Did you hear it all?

630
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,240
This is the state of every
engineering student.

631
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,240
We are so confident when we take
up science as a subject.

632
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,600
The four years of engineering
takes a toll.

633
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,680
Forget that. Let's go out.

634
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,560
We need to freshen our mind.
Come on.

635
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,960
Tanki, it's your turn.

636
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,320
Why should I?
My father isn't a millionaire.

637
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,720
It was my turn yesterday.

638
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,800
It is your turn today.

639
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,360
Come on. Go on.

640
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Why are you keeping a count?

641
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,120
We don't keep count on who gives
and takes in friendship.

642
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,800
Jignesh, make him understand.

643
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,040
There's no count that we
keep in friendship.

644
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,360
I will get four half
teas for all of us.

645
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,640
Tea? -No.

646
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,880
Nobody refuses now.

647
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,440
All of you will have tea.

648
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,960
It's on me. Nobody refuses.

649
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,840
Hey, listen up.

650
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,040
Come here.

651
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,240
Hey.

652
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,280
What tea?

653
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,880
It's your turn so you
are getting us tea.

654
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,520
What about when it is my turn?

655
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,160
Cold Coffee. Grilled Sandwich.

656
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,080
Sizzling Brownie with Ice-cream.

657
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,920
Aren't you ashamed?

658
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,960
Get Cappuccino for
Jignesh and me.

659
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Okay bro.

660
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,520
Get me that first one.

661
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,280
Tell me the name?

662
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,520
That first one.

663
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,080
Which one?

664
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,640
The one that I drink everyday.

665
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,160
You drink my blood everyday.

666
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,960
Not that.
I don't remember it now.

667
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,000
Do a thing, get me a cold coke.

668
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,520
Cold coke it seems.

669
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,440
And listen. -Tell me.

670
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,080
With Ice-cream.

671
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,240
With Ice-cream.

672
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Adi.

673
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
Now, you tell me.

674
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,520
Two Appachino for you, right?

675
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,800
It's Cappuccino.

676
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,600
Yes, yes. -Go on.

677
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,640
Go away.

678
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Brothers.

679
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,920
Sit here.

680
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,280
I knew it.

681
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Here you go.

682
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,640
Appachino. -Hey.

683
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,160
So the thing is..

684
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,040
If you need tea,
we'll order that.

685
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,320
You have sent a very nice
video in the group.

686
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,560
All his videos are good.

687
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,400
Your collection is really good.

688
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,440
Where do you get so
many videos from?

689
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,400
You have to experience it
and not talk about it.

690
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Do you get it?

691
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,360
Let's finish the coffee
and go home.

692
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,680
I have already got so many
missed calls from Riya.

693
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,320
I have to talk to her for two
hours and then I can sleep.

694
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,720
It's your doing.

695
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,160
It's the campus interview
tomorrow. Hope you remember.

696
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,560
Be there on time.

697
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,800
Clean up well.

698
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,880
Don't think I am your dad.

699
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,520
As it is, I am going to fly off.

700
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,520
You will go to America.

701
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,080
That's nice.

702
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,400
How sweet.

703
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,880
Can't you hold a conversation
without touching?

704
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,960
It's his habit.
It's his character.

705
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,040
Anyway, you were supposed
to go to America, right?

706
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Why are you giving the
interview then?

707
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,960
Interviews are important
for confidence building.

708
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,800
There's a standard that
you need to keep.

709
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,440
When do you have to go?

710
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,720
Leave now.

711
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
What is your name?

712
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,960
Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab,
Haryana, Uttar Pradesh.

713
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,160
What?

714
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,160
Raju. -What Raju?

715
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Get out.

716
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,680
Next please.

717
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,160
Okay. What is your name?

718
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,680
Jigga, I mean Jignesh.

719
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,440
Full name please.

720
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,800
Jignesh Bhai Govardhan
Bhai Patel.

721
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,760
So tell me, why did you select
mechanical engineering?

722
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,840
I chose engineering because
my dad chose it.

723
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,280
I didn't chose engineering.

724
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,640
Tell me,
your strength and weaknesses.

725
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,000
My friends are my strength.

726
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,720
And my weakness..

727
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,120
I don't have any weaknesses.

728
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,680
Good. Who is your role model?

729
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,400
Right now, it's Katrina.

730
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Who Katrina?

731
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,080
Our Katrina.

732
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,360
Katrina Kaif.

733
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,520
Okay, tell me.

734
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,720
Have you ever got first
class in any exams?

735
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,560
Since the first semester,
till now..

736
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,960
..if you add up all the results,
then I get a first class.

737
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,040
Very good progress. -Thank you.

738
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,920
Give me two reasons
of why we should..

739
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,840
..select you in our company?

740
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Sir,
if you hire me in your company..

741
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,640
..I will take your company to..

742
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,960
..I will take your company
to great heights.

743
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,600
Get down now.

744
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,480
You are not selected for
this job. Get out.

745
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,680
I am not here to work in
your stupid company.

746
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,520
I will make my own company.

747
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,440
That too in America.

748
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,600
Please. -Your English is nice.

749
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,200
I will call you to work
in my company.

750
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,320
Please get out.

751
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,760
What? -Hmm.

752
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,800
What? -My files.

753
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
Thank you.

754
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,120
Next please.

755
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,200
Introduce yourself.

756
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,280
Raj, Jiger's friend.

757
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Who Jiger?

758
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,040
That Jigga.

759
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,040
That boy who just rejected
your company.

760
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,840
That's what Jigga thinks.

761
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,360
I don't mind even if the
company is small.

762
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,440
I just need the salary
to come on time.

763
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,160
Tell me.

764
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,040
How do you see yourself
after ten years?

765
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,160
Ten years?

766
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,440
After ten years, sir.

767
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,240
Yes.

768
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,640
I will be father.

769
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,600
Good.

770
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,680
How do you deal with pressure
in critical condition?

771
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,200
Pressure?

772
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,960
The Public toilet.
That relieves pressure.

773
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,480
All it takes is two rupees.

774
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,080
Please get out.

775
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
Please leave.

776
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,960
Sure? -Get out.

777
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,040
Next please.

778
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Hello sir.

779
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,560
What is your name?

780
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,600
Liti.

781
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,240
What Liti?

782
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,960
Do you have a pen and pad?

783
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
Give it to me.

784
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,560
This is how you spell 'Liti.

785
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,920
Is this Liti?

786
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Get out.

787
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,160
Hooligan.

788
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,080
The exams are round the corner.

789
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,280
This engineering is hell.

790
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,520
That's true.
It's taking away our life.

791
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,920
Hey, listen up boys.

792
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
It's my sister Priya's marriage.

793
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,280
All of you must be there.

794
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,400
But we have exams then.

795
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,240
Jigga, have fun.

796
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,680
These days, before the priest
sets up the wedding time..

797
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,480
..he ask if there's an
engineering student in the house.

798
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,200
Then he fixers up the
auspicious time.

799
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,800
Adi, if you have a function
at your place..

800
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,440
..we'll definitely be there.

801
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,760
All of us will be there.

802
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,960
When is the wedding?

803
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,760
The next month. Oh, is it so?

804
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,040
Liti, why are you running?

805
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,360
Let me go. I have my period now.

806
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,120
So you are running off
to get sanitary pads?

807
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,520
Just shut up.

808
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,440
If you trouble me, you will be
a goat in the next birth.

809
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,680
That too a female one.

810
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,680
Liti, goats are female only.

811
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,280
He says anything.

812
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,440
You know it, right?

813
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,760
Hooligan.

814
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,160
Hey, hey.

815
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,960
It's your period, run.

816
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,080
Oh God.

817
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,960
The exams are right
around the corner.

818
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,720
We will have to stop wasting
time and start studying.

819
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,720
Jigga, I recollected..

820
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,120
..we have to change and go for
the tax class. -Surely.

821
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,680
"Check it out."

822
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,920
Wow. Yes.

823
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,040
Jigga.

824
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,920
Ready! -Oh God.
-Oh God. -Go away.

825
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,960
What are you reading?

826
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,640
Here, you read.

827
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,520
Oh God.

828
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,440
It's not meant for you, dear.

829
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,960
Hey Raj.

830
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,280
Please give it to me.

831
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,240
Hey, what do you want?

832
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
Pen.

833
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,560
Pant? -Not Pant as in trousers.
I meant pen.

834
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,240
Go to him.
He will give it to you.

835
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,880
Oh.

836
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,880
Hey.

837
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Come on.

838
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,440
"In just sometime,
the exams will begin."

839
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,960
"If you have worked hard,
the results will be good."

840
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,600
"Be awake for a few nights."

841
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,680
"Fulfill all your dreams."

842
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,520
"I am giving my exams,
but I know nothing."

843
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,960
"Whatever I have studied,
hasn't come in the paper."

844
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,640
"What do I do? Where do I go? "

845
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,760
"What do I do? Where do I go? "

846
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,920
"The problems are always
going to be around."

847
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:53,320
"The pain will also be there."

848
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,920
"Even people say the problem
will always be there."

849
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,680
"Always and forever."

850
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,400
"I am with you.
Forget all your worries."

851
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,840
"I am with you.
Forget all your worries."

852
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,880
"Come on, we'll handle it. "

853
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,080
"Come on, we'll handle it. "

854
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,040
"I will be the topper
of the university."

855
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,400
"I will fulfill my dad's dream."

856
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,480
"Come on, we'll handle it.
Come on, we'll handle it. "

857
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,600
"Come on, we'll handle it.
Come on, we'll handle it. "

858
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,680
The exams are over. Now, we will
have peace for five months.

859
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,480
I am thinking of starting Maths
right from the beginning.

860
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,520
In the end,
it gets very difficult.

861
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,800
After every semester,
you say the same thing.

862
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,640
Did you ever start studying
from the start?

863
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,960
Baby, I am going out tonight.

864
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,400
Even I am going to my uncle's
place in Junagadh.

865
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,920
Really? -After a few days,
we are planning to go to Diu.

866
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,880
You can also join us.

867
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Okay. I will try.

868
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,520
Oh God.

869
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,520
Hey, is this Simran's father?

870
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,800
How are you? -I am fine.

871
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,200
Riya, where does Simran stay?

872
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,920
She stays near Junagadh.

873
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,680
She is going to be there
for her vacations.

874
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,000
But Simran is in Ahmadabad..
-Yes, in Ahmadabad.

875
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,840
But she said that she will go
to her village for vacations.

876
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,880
Oh.

877
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,480
Oh.

878
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,760
Simran is going to be close
to me during her vacations.

879
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,080
I am late.
Mom & dad must be waiting for me.

880
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,560
I will call you later.

881
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,680
Okay? Bye.

882
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,320
Bye. -Bye. -Bye.

883
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,480
Bye.

884
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,280
Tanki & Charger.

885
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,920
Have you spoken at home?

886
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,000
About what?
-Oh yes, I spoke to my mother.

887
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,800
She was sad that I wouldn't be
around even during my vacation.

888
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,080
I told my mother that it's Adi's
sister wedding. I have to go.

889
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,320
Even my mom called me and asked
me a zillion questions.

890
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,400
Mom gets more tensed than dad.
-Of course. She will be stressed.

891
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,080
You don't go home for months,
she will definitely be stressed.

892
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,880
Should we leave?
We need to go tomorrow morning.

893
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,200
Jigga, be there on time.

894
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,040
I will be there.
You get up on time.

895
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,760
Let's get going tomorrow morning.

896
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800
Race?

897
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,560
Greetings.

898
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,560
Yes, let me see.

899
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,080
All the decoration is done,
isn't it? -Mom.

900
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,160
You are here, son. Come on.

901
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,600
Greetings. -Come on.

902
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,320
My dear son.

903
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,120
Aunty, how are you? -I am good.
-How are you, uncle?

904
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
All good.

905
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,160
Don't they feed you
in the hostel?

906
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,920
You have become so thin.

907
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,760
Sister-in-law, all they eat
is junk food from outside.

908
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,400
That's the reason
they become thin.

909
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,560
It's nice that Adi
came a day early.

910
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,400
And even you guys could join him.

911
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,080
How could I not come for
your wedding, Priya?

912
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,960
This is my friend, Kavita.

913
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,960
He is my brother, Adi.

914
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,520
Hello Kavita.

915
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,520
All good.

916
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,520
This is his friend, Raj.

917
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,440
Hi. -Hi.

918
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,800
This is Jignesh.

919
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,840
Hello. -Hi.

920
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,600
This is Rahul.

921
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,280
How are you?

922
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,360
Will you keep standing here?

923
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,040
Go and freshen up.

924
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,280
I will get you all
something to eat.

925
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,120
Yes, stuff them up nicely.

926
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,200
Her dear son is here.

927
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,320
I will have to do it.
Come on in. -Go on.

928
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,000
Tanki will have to pee now.

929
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,880
How were your exams?

930
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,560
Mine was good.
I don't know about them.

931
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,280
Charger,
ours was better compared to you.

932
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,200
Calm down.

933
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,880
It was a breeze for Tanki.

934
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,840
Engineering is very difficult,
isn't it? -That is true.

935
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,760
We will take your leave.

936
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,160
You guys have your snacks.
-Yes, sure.

937
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,320
Let's go. -Bye.

938
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,760
Adi.

939
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,240
Kavita is a beauty.

940
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,960
What I am trying to say is..

941
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,360
..why don't you ask
Priya to set me up?

942
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,200
Have your snacks.

943
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,640
He wants to set himself up.

944
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,640
Charger, what's your problem..

945
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,960
..if I am getting into
a relationship?

946
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,400
Wait dear.

947
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,800
First, I will set myself
up and then you.

948
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,480
Boys, did you eat? -Yes aunty.

949
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,080
Aunty, your snacks were great.

950
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
Yes.

951
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,000
We are going to roam.

952
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,360
Go if you want,
but don't be late. -Yes.

953
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,520
Adi, if I need to pee?

954
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,200
Go there.

955
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,480
You leave, I will be back.

956
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,760
Let's go.

957
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,960
I spoke to the flower guy.

958
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,720
I spoke to the cook too.

959
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,800
Dolly will be here.

960
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,240
I need to get the necklace.

961
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,560
Son, are you going to the market?
-Yes.

962
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,280
Ask Lala. That Somabhai Jhaveri.

963
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,320
We need to get Priya's
necklace from there.

964
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,760
Her father spoke to him.
You get it from there.

965
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,120
Okay, aunty. We will get it.

966
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,840
That's done.

967
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,200
What else is left?

968
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,760
I need to call Bor Baba.

969
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,360
Are you done?

970
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
Let's go.

971
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,040
Take so much time.

972
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,120
What a nice place.

973
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,360
I wish Riya was here.

974
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,160
Hey.

975
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,720
Everything is romantic for you.

976
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,920
"I wish Riya was here."
What would you do then?

977
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,520
Would you bathe in the river?

978
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,640
People like him can't have
fun with girlfriend.

979
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,840
The sit up close and tight
while watching a film.

980
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,040
Yes.

981
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,360
The theater is dark.

982
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,920
So many couple sit so
close in the garden.

983
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,240
No shame at all.

984
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,120
There are families sitting out
there. Kids playing around.

985
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,520
They aren't bothered at all.

986
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,840
They will start wherever
they find the place.

987
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,640
Charger, you are correct.

988
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,680
Our Jigga is well under control.
-Exactly.

989
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,760
He tries once or twice,
but always gets trapped.

990
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,040
You are saying this because you
don't have a girlfriend.

991
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,760
Once you have a girlfriend,
you will be the same.

992
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,760
That's fine.
I am feeling really thirsty.

993
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,960
Hey, don't start again.

994
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,320
Sit there quietly.

995
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,880
Tanki is talking about drinking
water for the first time.

996
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,320
It's usually him wanting to pee.

997
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,440
Uncle, water.

998
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,080
Oh dear.

999
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,880
That was nice.

1000
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,800
Why are you laughing?

1001
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,360
Dear,
this water was meant for washing.

1002
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,160
You drank it all.

1003
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,600
I will have to fill it again.

1004
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,440
We had given a necklace
on order for a wedding.

1005
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,760
We are here to collect it.

1006
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,000
Yes, I had spoken to sir
and he had told me..

1007
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,200
..that four boys will be
here to collect it.

1008
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,960
Are you those four boys? -Yes.

1009
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,880
Call and confirm once.

1010
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,760
Yes, that's a nice idea.

1011
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,640
Sir, greetings.

1012
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,440
Like you said,
four people are here.

1013
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,440
To take that necklace.
Shall I give it?

1014
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,280
Okay. I am giving it to them.

1015
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,680
Give them that necklace.

1016
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,320
Here's your necklace.
-Greetings. -Greetings.

1017
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,320
That's so nice.

1018
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,960
Come on. -Mom.

1019
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,800
Look at this. -You are here.

1020
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,320
We knew that you were
going to forget..

1021
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,320
..so he went ahead and
got it himself.

1022
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,120
Son.

1023
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,520
Go and sit at one place.

1024
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,440
You must not watch
videos all day.

1025
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,240
Go. Go now.

1026
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,960
Topa. Topa.

1027
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,600
Hey.

1028
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,120
Which necklace did we get then?

1029
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,720
I think there has been a
big misunderstanding.

1030
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,520
I think, aunty spoke about
Somabhai Jhaveri.

1031
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,400
You think? Are you sure?

1032
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,760
Topa.
This is a big misunderstanding.

1033
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,960
Uncle, please keep this bag.

1034
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,960
Okay. -We are going out.

1035
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:48,160
Okay.
-Uncle, we are going out. -Okay.

1036
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,080
Today, we will have to settle
this. Get the bag out.

1037
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,480
The necklace isn't here.

1038
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,560
What are you saying? It must be
inside. Check. -Here you go.

1039
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,680
See.

1040
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,280
Topa. Topa. Topa.

1041
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,400
We are in a soup.

1042
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,320
Don't put it on me now.

1043
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
Boys.

1044
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,360
Uncle. -Your parents.

1045
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,600
Uncle, there's a problem.
-What happened?

1046
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,440
We had kept a necklace in this
bag. We can't find it now.

1047
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,200
Necklace? Which necklace?

1048
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,680
Priya wore that, right?

1049
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,360
Uncle, not that one. We are
talking about a different one.

1050
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,400
Another one?
-Did someone open this bag?

1051
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,640
No, no one opened this bag.

1052
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,320
But which necklace are
you talking about?

1053
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,880
Because of this Tanki..

1054
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,400
..we got a necklace from
another jeweler too.

1055
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,560
That necklace was in this bag.

1056
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,600
What are you saying? -Yes, uncle.

1057
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,640
We can't find that necklace.

1058
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,680
What will we do now?

1059
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,920
Uncle, we'll handle it.

1060
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,240
Let's all hit Tanki.

1061
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,080
Who is the owner of the house?

1062
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,480
I am the owner. What happened?

1063
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,520
Your boys took away his necklace.

1064
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,120
No, that's not possible.

1065
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,240
I will call my son.
Hey, come downstairs.

1066
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,560
Sit down. Calm yourself.

1067
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,600
Talk politely.

1068
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,920
Who are you? -I am DK.

1069
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,640
My name is DK.

1070
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,440
Charger.

1071
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,600
Your father-in-law came
in looking for you.

1072
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,560
Topa.

1073
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,600
How will I know?

1074
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,240
What's my father-in-law
doing here?

1075
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,560
Come on.

1076
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,280
You took the necklace.

1077
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,520
I am here to take
my necklace back.

1078
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,160
Which necklace. -DK's necklace.

1079
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,840
No. We got the necklace
that we ordered for.

1080
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,560
They are here. Ask them.

1081
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,480
Yes, these were the boys..

1082
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,680
..who took your necklace.

1083
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,440
Oh, is that so?

1084
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,760
When my daughter was young..

1085
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,400
..I made these necklace out
of the ornaments she had.

1086
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,480
It was my mom's wish that..

1087
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,720
..whenever Simran gets married..

1088
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,400
..her husband should
tie it to her neck.

1089
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,560
And this what you did?

1090
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,760
Sir,
my parents know nothing of it.

1091
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,640
Mistakenly, we..

1092
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,600
..got that necklace.

1093
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,920
More than that necklace..

1094
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,760
..the sentiments are more
important to me.

1095
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,160
And so, give me my necklace.

1096
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,560
Sir, there's problem.

1097
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,320
The necklace got stolen
from the bag.

1098
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,960
Don't make me angry.

1099
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,280
Or you will have to bear
its consequences.

1100
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,440
Sir, we are speaking the truth.

1101
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,480
The necklace is stolen.

1102
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,320
You won't give it so easily.

1103
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,640
I don't want to go to the cops.

1104
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,480
Until I get my necklace..

1105
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,680
..one of you will be with me.

1106
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:48,440
Tell me, who will accompany me?
-Charger.

1107
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,520
Charger, get ready.

1108
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,080
You won't get time later.

1109
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,360
Until then we can look
for the necklace.

1110
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,040
I give you five days.

1111
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,880
If I don't get my necklace
in five days..

1112
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,040
Until you get the necklace..

1113
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,640
..don't even come close
to my house.

1114
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,920
Charger.

1115
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,440
Let's go.

1116
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,840
Come on.

1117
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,320
We will have to send Charger
to his in-laws place.

1118
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,040
This is your doing.

1119
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,040
You. -Hey.

1120
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,080
Why did you give my name?

1121
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,880
Charger, listen to me.

1122
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,600
Simran is about to get married.

1123
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,160
You have five days.

1124
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,600
Try and evoke feeling
in Simran for you.

1125
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,480
You always said that Simran
belongs to Raj.

1126
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,920
Go, go live your life.

1127
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,600
I pity Charger,
nothing happened in three years.

1128
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,720
And then today..

1129
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,440
You go if you want to.

1130
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,360
I don't know where
he will take me.

1131
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,520
I don't know here
he will take you.

1132
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,840
But I am confidant..

1133
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,240
..you will handle him.

1134
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,320
Pack my bag.

1135
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,480
Go on.
-Charger will handle everything.

1136
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,400
Hey.

1137
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,120
Where is Mukesh?

1138
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,640
Where is he?

1139
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,040
Who will help with the marriage
preparation now?

1140
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,160
He is sick.

1141
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,760
So, he can't make it. -What?

1142
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,440
Who will help with the marriage
preparation now?

1143
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,760
Bannerilal, don't worry.

1144
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,480
Everything will be arranged.

1145
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,960
Do one thing.

1146
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,640
Take him to our out house.
Keep an eye on him.

1147
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,360
Don't let him go until
I tell you so.

1148
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,400
Sir, listen to me. Keep me here.

1149
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,720
I will handle the marriage
preparations.

1150
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,840
I used to do all this
in college too.

1151
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,800
That's nice.
We found our man of the hour.

1152
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,360
Okay.

1153
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,520
Entrust him with the work.

1154
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,560
You understand all that
needs to be done.

1155
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,680
Listen, keep an eye on him.

1156
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,440
Yes.
-He shouldn't run away. -Yes sir.

1157
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,960
Get to know everything properly.

1158
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,800
Come on.

1159
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,120
Everything will be good.

1160
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,480
"Father-in-law,
I won't just work..

1161
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,040
..I will elope with her."

1162
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,160
Hey, come on.

1163
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,040
Yes. -Yes, let's go.

1164
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,440
Let me tell you everything.
-What?

1165
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,200
My name is Bhagu Bhai.

1166
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,720
What sort of name is that?

1167
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,000
My aunt kept this name.

1168
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,200
What's your name? -Raj.

1169
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,960
Raj? Who is Raj?

1170
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,160
I am Raj.

1171
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,080
So, your name is Raj. Okay.

1172
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,560
So Raju Bhai!

1173
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,280
Bhagu Bhai, just Raj.

1174
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,520
Then who is Raju Bhai?

1175
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,840
I don't know.

1176
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,240
Raju Bhai! Yes.

1177
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,680
Bhagu Bhai! -Yes.
-Who is getting married?

1178
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,600
My Chakudy.

1179
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,200
Who Chakudy? -My niece.

1180
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,400
Oh, so her name is Chakudy? Okay.

1181
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,640
What does your niece do?
-Her real name is Simran.

1182
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,760
But I gleefully address
her as Chakudy.

1183
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,880
Oh. -She is in the city..

1184
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,200
..to learn to fix computers.
-Okay. -Yes.

1185
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,640
This lad in my village..

1186
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,360
..learnt to fix the computer
without a degree.

1187
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,640
He know to repair the television.

1188
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,920
He repairs almost everything.
-Wow.

1189
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,960
But my Chakudy has been in
the city for three years.

1190
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,560
She still hasn't learnt
to repair a computer.

1191
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,440
She still hasn't succeeded.

1192
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,960
This is what it is.

1193
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,480
Bhagu Bhai.

1194
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,600
You get the girl married
off so soon?

1195
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,920
Yes, her father wasn't
keeping too well..

1196
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,280
..so we thought of getting her
married as soon as possible.

1197
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,760
After this, there is no auspicious
time until next 6 months.

1198
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,720
Everything will be good.

1199
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,400
Oh.

1200
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,560
Which is this family?
-That same one.

1201
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,080
Okay.

1202
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,920
Who is she getting married to?

1203
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,160
To the village Sarpanch's
(village head) son.

1204
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,320
Is that so?

1205
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,160
What does the boy do?

1206
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,000
He does a lot of work.

1207
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,280
But we believe that..

1208
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,760
.. he will score well
in his final term.

1209
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,560
But..

1210
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,640
Bhagu Bhai.

1211
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,280
Chakudy, right?

1212
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,480
She is still studying.

1213
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,280
So she is still agreed
for this alliance?

1214
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,200
Are you a teacher?

1215
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,360
You are asking so many questions.

1216
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,840
That's your room.

1217
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,400
Is that okay?
I will finish off my work.

1218
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,400
Go now. Go to your room.

1219
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,560
Go.

1220
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,280
I haven't seen Simran since long.

1221
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,880
So I am not getting the vibe.

1222
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,360
I will have to see Simran.

1223
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,280
Then I’ll be all charged.

1224
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,360
Simran, I am coming.

1225
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,200
Chakudy.

1226
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,320
Raj. What brings you here?

1227
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,200
Just..

1228
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,600
I came looking for you.
-Just shut up, okay.

1229
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,480
How did you get to my house?

1230
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,040
In your dad's car.

1231
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,320
Your dad got me here.

1232
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,360
To organize your wedding.

1233
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,520
Don't tell your dad
that you know me.

1234
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,760
Or he will throw me out.

1235
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,720
But how did you meet dad?

1236
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,320
It's a long story.

1237
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,680
By the way, it's commendable.

1238
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,320
A software engineer and..

1239
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,800
That's a nice couple.

1240
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,120
Don't act smart.

1241
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,520
My dad isn't keeping well..

1242
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,480
..so I have to get married.

1243
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,640
Oh. So you have to.

1244
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,960
So that means you don't want to.

1245
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,280
My family's choice is my choice.

1246
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,640
I won't speak about you at home..

1247
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,400
..you don't mention about my
wedding in the college.

1248
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:26,960
I will see.

1249
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,840
You have a nice house.

1250
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,240
You can see everything far of.
-Mom, this..

1251
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,600
Aunty, how are you?

1252
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,320
I am fine. -Raju Bhai.

1253
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,920
Raju Bhai,
what are you doing here?

1254
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,960
It's not "Raju Bhai", it's Raj.

1255
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,040
Whatever it is.

1256
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,080
I have to manage everything,
so I am taking a look.

1257
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,680
Sister,
Bannerilal has sent him over.

1258
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:58,280
For the marriage preparations.
-Raju! Do everything properly.

1259
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,520
Aunty,
that's the reason I am here.

1260
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,480
Don't worry..
I will put my heart and soul..

1261
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,760
..into not getting
Chakudy married.

1262
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,200
I mean to get her married.

1263
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,680
What did you think?

1264
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,080
Nothing as such.

1265
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,760
Raju Bhai, we don't have
work in just one room.

1266
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,200
We have a lot of pending work.
Come on. Let's go.

1267
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,680
Yes, let's go.

1268
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,400
Alright Aunty. Bye. -Bye.

1269
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,640
Bye Chakudy. -Bye Raju Bhai.

1270
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,560
Come on, let's go.
Enough of goodbyes.

1271
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,160
That's too many goodbyes
for one time.

1272
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,560
He is a very nice boy. -Yes.

1273
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,560
Adi. -Yes.

1274
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,920
Stop smoking.

1275
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,440
Before us, you will die.

1276
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,680
Jigga, I have almost quit it.

1277
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,800
I am stressed so I am smoking.

1278
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,200
Last day today.

1279
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,880
I am listening to this since
the past three years..

1280
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,960
..Adi. -Uncle.

1281
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,960
Chiku, you? -Lala uncle.

1282
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,760
Uncle, give me a chocolate.

1283
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,720
He has never had one.
How will he give it to you?

1284
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,240
That's okay if you don't
give me a chocolate.

1285
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,760
I will show this video to mom.
-Show it to me.

1286
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,320
Let me see.

1287
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,160
Check if there is some
other video too.

1288
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,080
Hey, Priya's friend Kavita
took the necklace.

1289
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,640
See.

1290
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,920
Hey. -That's Kavita.

1291
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,360
We will have to call Charger.
-Call him quickly.

1292
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,720
Charger.

1293
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,760
I am sending across a video.
Show it to your father-in-law.

1294
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,120
Hey.

1295
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:02,000
If I show him your kind of video,
he will throw me out.

1296
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,640
Charger,
this is the video of the..

1297
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,040
..person who stole the necklace.

1298
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,040
Don't waste anymore time
and show it to him.

1299
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,400
What are you saying?

1300
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,680
Send me the video.
My father-in-law is just leaving.

1301
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,840
Send it quickly. -Yes.

1302
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,200
Sir, sir! Sir, just a second.

1303
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,600
This phone has the video of the
person who stole the necklace.

1304
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,040
Please see it once.

1305
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,640
You may know her.

1306
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,080
Please. Just one time.

1307
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,200
Can you see the necklace here?

1308
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,680
Can you see the necklace here?

1309
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,880
Is that all you do?
Do you even work?

1310
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,040
Stop all this.
Concentrate on your work.

1311
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,360
Go away.

1312
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,680
What a man.

1313
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,640
He won't let me get married.

1314
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,880
Let me find it and
then we'll talk.

1315
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,400
Even my phone's switched off.

1316
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,720
Me?

1317
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,880
One second.

1318
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,640
Did you call me?

1319
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,520
What were you showing my father?

1320
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,960
Your father?

1321
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,040
Nothing as such.

1322
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,120
We did this couple dance at
the Fresher's party, right?

1323
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,080
Yes. -A video of that.

1324
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,520
Don't joke. Tell me the story.

1325
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,120
Do you want to hear about it?
-Yes.

1326
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,680
Okay.

1327
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,760
It's a long story.

1328
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,560
Years and years ago,
there was a King..

1329
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,840
Raj.

1330
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,520
Not Raj. It's the king.

1331
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,920
Are you done? Can you tell
me the real story now?

1332
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,920
Sorry. Listen.

1333
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,640
What are they doing together?

1334
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,480
There's something definitely
happening.

1335
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,120
Something great is
going to happen.

1336
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,480
So, this is the story.

1337
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,480
Now I know why dad
is so stressed.

1338
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:55,400
Don't worry. Dad will let you
go if I speak with him.

1339
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:59,720
No, don't say anything now. -Let
the boys look for the necklace.

1340
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,400
They are lazy,
they won't do anything.

1341
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,520
That's a memento of
your childhood.

1342
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,400
Raj, they are engineers,
not detectives.

1343
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,960
If they don't find it..

1344
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,480
..you can then call your
father and save us.

1345
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,440
Alright. As you say.

1346
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,120
By the way, there's pink
teddy bear in your room.

1347
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:21,440
It has a sign which says
'Someone special.'

1348
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,080
Is it for me?

1349
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,960
It's getting very late.

1350
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,200
Go now. Someone will see you.

1351
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,600
One day,
I will be your 'Someone special.'

1352
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,160
Did Charger show the video?

1353
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,480
His phone is switched off.

1354
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,080
Let's do one thing.

1355
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,040
Instead of waiting for him here..

1356
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,680
..what if we go to his
father-in-law's house?

1357
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,760
Yes, we must go.

1358
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,760
I hope he is not in trouble.

1359
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,960
Come on, let's go.

1360
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,360
That DK is sitting there.
I hope you remember.

1361
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,080
He will kill us.

1362
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,800
He told us to not go there.

1363
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,720
We'll handle all that.

1364
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,960
We'll handle it. -Let's go.

1365
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,520
Jigga. Adi.

1366
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,680
Look here. Kavita is here.

1367
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,040
I want to meet DK sir.

1368
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,360
Okay.

1369
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,440
Charger's phone is still
switched off.

1370
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,240
Let's call Simran.

1371
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,040
Let ask her to connect
us to Charger.

1372
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,400
There should be no
mistake this time.

1373
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,360
Let's do one thing. We will go in
and catch Kavita red handed.

1374
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,520
Come on. -Let's go.

1375
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,360
Hey. Hello. Just a minute.

1376
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,960
Have you forgotten your way?

1377
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,360
That..

1378
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,920
Everything will be good.

1379
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,360
No..

1380
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,640
Are you here to put
up the lights?

1381
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,840
Yes. -Yes.

1382
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,080
The lights need to go up
in the lawn, not here.

1383
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,840
Where are your things?

1384
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,840
It's here. -On it's way.

1385
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:17,200
Let's go in.
-It took you so long.

1386
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,040
Oh.

1387
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:52,000
We have to light up this
entire space, okay?

1388
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,520
You see the corner there, the
lights need to go up there too.

1389
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,280
There's lot of work left.
A lot of work.

1390
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,120
But everything is going
to be great.

1391
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,680
Oh.

1392
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,960
Hey, guys.
We are here to look for Kavita.

1393
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,160
Let's find her. Come on!

1394
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,120
Hey. Hey!

1395
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,960
Hey you! -Is this your garden?

1396
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,520
How did you come in?
-We came to save you.

1397
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,000
Switch on your phone.

1398
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,280
Did you show your father-in-law
that video? Tell us that.

1399
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,080
Who sent me that video?

1400
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,040
Tanki sent that video.

1401
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,080
What was in that video?

1402
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,920
Hey, what was in that video?

1403
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,040
What do you mean?

1404
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,760
Kavita's video. What else?

1405
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
Was it Kavita or your
naked model?

1406
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,640
Hey. -Tanki, you are dead.

1407
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,240
What's happening?

1408
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,640
Hey.

1409
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,080
You tarnished my image in front
of my father-in-law.

1410
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:04,200
Hey, Charger. -No, Charger. -Hey.

1411
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,760
Don't do it. -Hey.

1412
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,760
Hey, run away.

1413
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,080
This is my father-in-law.

1414
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,480
Run. -Run, come on.

1415
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,920
Oh God.

1416
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,480
Charger, the thief is here only.
-What are you saying?

1417
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,680
Where? -What are you doing
here since so long?

1418
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,160
People are waiting for you
out there with things.

1419
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,400
All you do is eat
lollipop all day.

1420
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,800
Don't we have to light
up this place?

1421
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,040
We are here to check.

1422
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,840
You don't have to
light it up here.

1423
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,520
You have to put the lights there.

1424
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,200
Raju Bhai, all the things need
to be at the farm house.

1425
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,200
You get the car, I will go to
the office and be right back.

1426
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,000
Hey, you.

1427
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,480
Shall I accompany you?

1428
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,600
You don't need to go there.

1429
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:58,720
Hey, stay quiet.

1430
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,600
He calls the washroom the
'Office'. Do you want to go there?

1431
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,640
Listen to me.
Forget everything else.

1432
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,960
Before Bhagu Bhai comes,
hide in the car.

1433
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,200
In the car?

1434
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,160
So that he doesn't see you.

1435
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,720
We have to go out, don't we?
-Come on, quickly.

1436
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,080
There's so much work left.

1437
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,800
I don't know when her wedding
will get over.

1438
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,840
Thank God, Raju Bhai is here.

1439
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,760
I am relaxed because of him.

1440
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,480
Everything is going to be good.

1441
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,640
Let me finish the other work.

1442
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,200
Come on.

1443
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,840
Bhagu Bhai! Bhagu Bhai!

1444
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,840
Bhagu Bhai will take
care of everything.

1445
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,840
Take a left.

1446
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,880
Yes.

1447
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,200
Raju Bhai, I have to give out
invites to everyone here.

1448
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,080
So I am going.

1449
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,120
Everything is going to be great.

1450
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,640
Yes. Go on.

1451
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,240
Come on quickly.

1452
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,200
Finally.

1453
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,600
Hey, this is Kavita.

1454
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:31,160
She is dead.

1455
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,080
What happened?

1456
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,320
Charger,
Kavita's dead body is in the car.

1457
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,920
What do we do?

1458
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,320
It's the dead body.

1459
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,680
Jigs! Jigs!

1460
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,080
Hi.
-There's no network in Mumbai..

1461
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,560
..and still she has
found you here.

1462
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,840
Baby, what are you doing here?

1463
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,680
We spoke on the phone.

1464
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,880
I am supposed to go out
with my cousins.

1465
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,880
There was no network,
so I couldn't hear.

1466
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,400
But where are you guys going?

1467
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,720
We are..

1468
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,240
We are going to the same place.
-Okay.

1469
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,000
Who is she?

1470
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,800
Tanki's girlfriend.

1471
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,080
Kavita. -Yes.

1472
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,880
You got a girlfriend already?

1473
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,400
Charger helped me.

1474
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,320
But why is she sleeping?

1475
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,920
The thing is..

1476
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,960
Say it. Say it.

1477
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,920
She had some hard drinks
unknowingly.

1478
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,200
Is that so?

1479
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,680
I am getting late.
See you around.

1480
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,120
Bye. -Bye.

1481
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,400
Bye. Love you.

1482
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,000
All done. Bye.

1483
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,280
Bye.

1484
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,800
Can't you see?

1485
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,440
Listen. Come here.

1486
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,360
I will have to go back or
DK will think I ran away.

1487
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,680
You guys are going to Diu? -Yes.

1488
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,120
Dump the body there.

1489
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,120
Get the car back in the evening.

1490
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,520
Come on, quickly.

1491
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,760
Hey.

1492
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,960
Hey, what are you doing?

1493
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,040
Oh.

1494
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,400
Oh God, save me.

1495
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,760
Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

1496
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,880
Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

1497
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,040
Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

1498
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,000
Ghost!

1499
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,440
Ghost. Ghost. -Ghost.

1500
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,920
There is a Ghost..

1501
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,880
Keep quiet.

1502
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,600
Why are you guys so scared?

1503
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,120
No. -Not at all. -No.

1504
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,440
What's in the car?

1505
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,000
That..

1506
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,600
That he wants to.. -What?

1507
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,120
Yes sir.

1508
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,080
He wants to pee.

1509
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,240
What's in the car?

1510
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,400
There's nothing in the car, sir.

1511
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,760
What?

1512
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:37,760
Jigga, I will pee right here.
I am so scared.

1513
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,800
I don't even have a girlfriend.

1514
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:44,840
If the cops arrest us, no one
will wed me to their daughter.

1515
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,120
That's true.

1516
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,200
What is it?

1517
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,120
He is here.

1518
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,160
There is nothing in the car.

1519
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,680
But you can't halt your
car mid-way. Go on.

1520
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,200
Yes. Yes sir. -Yes.

1521
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,280
Go on.

1522
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,720
Where did she go?

1523
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,600
Hey.

1524
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,400
The dead body is not
to be found here.

1525
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,760
The dead body is missing?
-Thank God.

1526
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:31,160
Thank God, we are out of trouble.

1527
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,360
Topa, because of you we will
have to drive until Diu.

1528
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,800
You won't get rid of your habits,
Topa.

1529
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,720
Come on, now. Sit in the car.

1530
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,280
Simran. Bhagu Bhai wanted
a party in the evening.

1531
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,360
What do you want?

1532
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,280
Actually, it's Vikram's birthday
today. -He is going to be here.

1533
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,640
So please arrange for
a cake and the DJ.

1534
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,720
Oh.

1535
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,760
So we have to welcome the
groom today, right?

1536
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,400
We will have to welcome him.

1537
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,120
Simran. -Yes.

1538
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,000
Shall I ask you something?
-Yes please.

1539
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,200
Are you happy? -Yes.

1540
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,960
I am happy.

1541
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,360
Thanks. I got my answer.

1542
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,480
See you at the party.

1543
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,120
Guys.

1544
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,080
Let's dance.

1545
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,680
I will be back.

1546
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,520
Come on guys.

1547
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,440
You are looking beautiful.
-Thanks.

1548
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,520
Are you going to marry this guy?

1549
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,960
I have no other choice.

1550
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,120
What about me?

1551
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,800
Charger, I am going to get
married. Stop trying to woo me.

1552
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,560
Come on Simran.

1553
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,840
That's our moral right as men.

1554
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:45,280
It's our moral right
to reject you too.

1555
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:51,040
Your marriage? God knows.

1556
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,720
It will happen.
But it hasn't yet.

1557
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,760
Cheers. -Simran! Simran!

1558
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,600
Simran, let's dance.

1559
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,560
Come on.

1560
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,200
"Bhagu Bhai singing."

1561
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,920
Bhagu Bhai. -Yes.

1562
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:26,960
You dear niece is..

1563
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,960
You like her, don't you?

1564
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,840
Everything is going to be great.

1565
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,480
Simran, dance with me.

1566
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,120
Nice.

1567
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,520
Hi.

1568
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,240
Greetings aunty. -Greetings.

1569
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,000
Wow.

1570
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,320
Come on guys.

1571
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,960
Acting too smart, eh?

1572
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,640
Are you new here?

1573
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,560
Is it so?

1574
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:20,600
Yes, I am. I came four days ago.

1575
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,520
Do you have a problem?

1576
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,800
You are talking way too much.

1577
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,240
A servant like you is hitting
the owner's friend.

1578
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,400
Sir, the friends that you have..

1579
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,880
..tell them to not
act like ruffians.

1580
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,480
You! -Vikram, please.

1581
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,800
Simran, go away.

1582
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,120
Simran is my fiancée.

1583
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,840
When I don't have a problem,
who are you to interfere?

1584
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,640
Who am I?

1585
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:56,960
I am beyond your imagination.
Do you get it?

1586
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:05,160
If anyone touches Simran
without her consent..

1587
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,880
.. I will break their hands.

1588
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,760
You won't know..

1589
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,360
..what to do with those
broken hands.

1590
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,600
Aunty, take care.

1591
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,520
Son, bye.

1592
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:37,920
Tell your friends to not create
a scene like that.

1593
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,120
Or you won't get married.

1594
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,720
If you behave well,
everything will be fine.

1595
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,440
"Our dear heart."

1596
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:22,520
"Take away my heart.
It's yours."

1597
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:27,200
"Our dear heart."

1598
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:32,080
"Take away my heart.
It's yours."

1599
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:36,920
"It's my wish,
something only you can fulfill."

1600
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:41,520
"It's my wish,
something only you can fulfill."

1601
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:46,880
"Oh baby, you drive me crazy."

1602
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,720
"Oh baby, you drive me crazy."

1603
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,520
"My heart has gone
crazy after you."

1604
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,960
"My heart has gone
crazy after you."

1605
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:05,840
"All it longs for is to see you,
meet you and love you."

1606
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:10,640
"All it longs for is to see you,
meet you and love you."

1607
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:15,520
"It's my wish,
something only you can fulfill."

1608
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,960
"It's my wish,
something only you can fulfill."

1609
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:25,240
"Oh baby, you drive me crazy."

1610
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:30,360
"Oh baby, you drive me crazy."

1611
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:54,360
"To tell you the truth..

1612
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:59,480
..you were love at first
sight for me."

1613
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:08,600
"To tell you the truth..

1614
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:13,400
..you were love at first
sight for me."

1615
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:18,320
"I want you to be my..

1616
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:22,600
..heartbeat."

1617
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,200
"All I long for is to
be in your arms..

1618
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,360
..in your dreams and
your nights."

1619
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:30,000
"All I long for is to
be in your arms..

1620
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,200
..in your dreams and
your nights."

1621
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:37,000
"It's my wish,
something only you can fulfill."

1622
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:41,560
"It's my wish,
something only you can fulfill."

1623
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:46,480
"Oh baby, you drive me crazy."

1624
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:51,880
"Oh baby, you drive me crazy."

1625
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,640
Raju Bhai. -Yes.

1626
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,240
Are you counting stars? -Yes.

1627
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,440
1,2,3..

1628
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,600
Everything is going to be great.

1629
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,960
Yes.

1630
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,680
"Boys mumbling."

1631
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,920
We will remember this.

1632
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:09,520
They are at it again.

1633
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:12,440
They start wherever they go.

1634
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,840
They will keep at it.
We will have to be strong.

1635
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,640
That's true.

1636
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,120
Adi, look there.

1637
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:27,600
Even a ghost bathes now?
This is scary.

1638
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,920
Jigga,
can you see the ghost there?

1639
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,120
Ghost.

1640
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,520
Baby. -Yes.

1641
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,200
Can you see someone
standing there?

1642
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,600
You..

1643
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,600
Please check if you
can see a girl.

1644
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,720
There's no girl here.

1645
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,840
Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

1646
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,640
Baby.

1647
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,600
Hi Kavita. -Hi.

1648
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,120
Hey, don't worry. I am alive.

1649
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,880
Check. -Yes.

1650
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:49,160
Jigga, she is alive. -Yes.

1651
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,320
What happened to you?

1652
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:56,840
The thing is that when
I went to DK's house..

1653
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:01,560
I don't want this.
Keep that in mind. -Sir.

1654
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,760
Hello sir.

1655
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:11,280
You got the money, didn't you?

1656
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,640
No sir.

1657
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,040
I came to tell you that..

1658
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,080
..I will give it to
you in a few days.

1659
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,240
Please sir. Please.

1660
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:31,880
Alright. I give you a week.

1661
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I need my money in a week,
is that okay?

1662
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:39,400
Okay sir.

1663
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,600
Thank you sir.

1664
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:49,080
Let me know of the developments.

1665
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,920
I think this girl fainted.

1666
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,520
Take her to the hospital
immediately.

1667
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,520
That's how I reached here.

1668
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,320
If I get hurt even a
little on my head..

1669
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,240
..I faint.

1670
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,480
Why did you steal the necklace?

1671
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,960
When I was in college,
I met with an accident.

1672
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,520
And for the operation..

1673
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:37,520
..my father had taken 5
lakh rupees from DK.

1674
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:42,120
After dad passed away,
DK's man Kallu Bhai..

1675
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,720
..used to threaten me everyday.

1676
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,520
So I stole the necklace.

1677
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,400
Where is the necklace?

1678
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,040
The necklace is in my pink purse.

1679
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,560
But when I went to DK's house..

1680
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,280
..the purse was with me.

1681
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,960
Now I don't know where
the purse is.

1682
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,960
We will have to talk to Charger.

1683
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,120
I will call him.

1684
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,240
Go and work there.

1685
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,840
Keep the pots there.

1686
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:32,320
Did you dump the dead body?
When will you return the car?

1687
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,480
Forget all that.

1688
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:36,360
Kavita is alive and the necklace
is in Simran's house only.

1689
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,720
Inside DK's house..

1690
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,520
..around DK's room,
the necklace is in a pink purse.

1691
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,960
What are you saying?

1692
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,920
Thank God Kavita is alive.

1693
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,920
Listen, come over quickly. -Yes.

1694
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:51,080
I am checking on the purse.
Come quickly.

1695
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,800
Yes, we will be there. -Okay bye.

1696
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,800
Where is it?

1697
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,920
Where is it?

1698
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,560
Raju Bhai.

1699
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,920
Raju Bhai,
what are you looking for here?

1700
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,600
Ah.. -Ah..

1701
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:32,040
Whatever it might be,
it will all be great.

1702
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,640
Popat, put up the canopy quickly.

1703
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:45,000
"Phone's ring tone."

1704
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:48,320
"Phone's ring tone."

1705
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:53,360
Jigga, I looked in the house.
I couldn't find the purse.

1706
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:59,680
You guys get the car first,
then we'll plan something.

1707
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,400
Charger, no matter what,
propose to Simran today.

1708
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,800
Or you will regret
it all your life.

1709
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:10,160
I am trying to woo her
but I am scared.

1710
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:13,200
Will you muster courage
once she is married?

1711
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,960
How do I do it?

1712
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:17,720
Get Simran out for
dinner at night.

1713
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,040
Okay, I will do something.

1714
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,600
Where will you meet me?

1715
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,360
We will take the car
and come near the..

1716
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,000
..village Dhaba (Local
restaurant).

1717
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,080
You get Simran there.
We'll handle the rest.

1718
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,480
Bye. -Bye.

1719
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:35,080
I will have to do something.

1720
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,080
Simran. -Raj.

1721
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,800
Simran,
I want to tell you something.

1722
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:10,600
Tell me. Why do you look so sad?

1723
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:15,800
Simran, all my friends are
planning a meet this evening.

1724
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,040
Actually,
they are partying today so..

1725
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,560
..they have invited you too.

1726
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,480
But Raj, in the evening..

1727
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,880
It isn't possible to get out
of the house in the evening.

1728
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,240
Dad is also home.

1729
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:38,560
Please Simran, don't refuse.

1730
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,920
After tomorrow,
I won't get to meet you.

1731
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,360
Please Simran.

1732
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,600
But Raj, try and understand.
I am getting married tomorrow.

1733
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,400
How do I get out of home?
That too in the evening?

1734
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,840
It isn't possible.
-Simran please.

1735
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,840
I am asking a little time
from you busy life.

1736
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,600
Please don't refuse.

1737
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,200
Okay, fine. I will try.

1738
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,240
Thanks.

1739
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,200
I will wait for you at the
Dhaba near the highway.

1740
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,960
I have faith that you will
definitely turn up.

1741
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:24,320
Charger,
I don't think Simran will arrive.

1742
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,880
Even I think so.

1743
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:31,360
You fools,
Simran will definitely be here.

1744
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,600
Yes. -You see.

1745
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,640
Simran.

1746
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,640
I won't promise you
stars and moon.

1747
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,080
But I will never let darkness
seep into your life.

1748
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,120
Simran, I won't say that I
will do anything for you.

1749
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,720
But if it makes you happy..

1750
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,720
..I will try to do all
that is possible.

1751
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,800
Simran, I won't say that I
can't live without you.

1752
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,120
But if I can't see you
in my life ahead..

1753
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,000
..I will keep remembering you.

1754
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:25,600
Simran.
I won't say that you are the..

1755
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,840
..most beautiful woman
in the world.

1756
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,520
But when I see you..

1757
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,120
..I feel..

1758
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,360
..that no one is more
beautiful than you.

1759
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:44,880
Simran, I can't promise to love
you more than your parents.

1760
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:51,560
But I promise,
you won't miss them.

1761
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,880
Simran,
maybe our story ends here.

1762
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,560
But I will pray to God..

1763
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:04,640
..to make me fall in love
with you in every birth.

1764
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:07,560
You are the only one.

1765
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:14,480
Simran, I love you.
I love you so much.

1766
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,520
And I want to spend my
whole life with you.

1767
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,280
I love you. I love you, Simran.

1768
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:54,200
Raj, you have been after
me for three years.

1769
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:57,720
You follow me and you love me.

1770
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:00,840
I never thought about you.

1771
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:06,160
Raj, I can't live with you.

1772
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,800
I love you.

1773
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:14,240
Raj, I love you.

1774
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:20,120
"That love needed to be
expressed in that moment."

1775
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,720
"And now, I believe."

1776
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:28,800
"You are the special
one for me."

1777
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,840
"And now, I believe."

1778
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:38,120
"You are the special
one for me."

1779
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,760
I am getting married tomorrow.
What do we do?

1780
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,560
Simran, don't worry.

1781
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:27,560
See,
what these average engineers do.

1782
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,760
I am going to get a
few women for the..

1783
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,160
..cooking with Bhagu
Bhai tomorrow.

1784
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:37,760
The plan is..

1785
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:25,960
Stop at the side.

1786
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,480
Slowly.

1787
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,560
Raju Bhai, you stay here.
I will be right back.

1788
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,480
Come back quickly. -Yes.

1789
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,640
I will be right back.

1790
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,400
Don't leave me and go. -Yes.

1791
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,840
Bhagu Bhai, you will have to run.

1792
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:11,040
Listen, meet me at the turning.

1793
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,200
Nothing. Making some protein
shake for Bhagu Bhai.

1794
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,560
Yes. Come on now.

1795
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:23,680
Three of you sit behind. Come on.

1796
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,120
Sit properly.

1797
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,120
Alright, let's go.

1798
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:31,200
Bhagu Bhai, drink some water.
It's so hot.

1799
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,680
The water is so calming.

1800
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,600
That's nice.

1801
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,080
Stop here.

1802
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:02,160
Raju Bhai, halt here.
I feel uneasy in my stomach.

1803
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,680
What?

1804
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,280
Do you have a tissue paper?

1805
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:12,160
I have sand paper. -Sand paper?

1806
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,760
Hey! Hey!

1807
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,960
Bhagu Bhai,
where are you taking the water?

1808
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,800
I need water.

1809
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:24,080
I will be right back.

1810
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:27,120
Be careful of snakes around.
Bhagu Bhai.

1811
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:28,760
Listen.

1812
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:34,120
Listen, your work ends here.

1813
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:36,960
But one last thing,
do you see the house there?

1814
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,680
You have to go there.
Is that okay?

1815
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,960
Come on quickly. Go now.

1816
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:46,560
Oh God, I feel relaxed.

1817
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:57,320
Come on. -Let's go.

1818
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:00,320
Come on.

1819
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,000
Are you done? -Yes.

1820
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:08,480
Everything is great
in my stomach now.

1821
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,280
Where are those cooks?

1822
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:18,600
They are there. They must
have gone to pee. -What?

1823
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,880
Why are two of them sitting
and two standing?

1824
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,520
How will I know?

1825
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,840
Okay.

1826
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,080
They must be guarding.

1827
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,080
Oh dear.

1828
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:36,320
I would have done it in the
standing position by now.

1829
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,920
I loved it in the sitting
position too.

1830
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,880
You had to forget your
boxers today only?

1831
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,840
If that's the case, do it the
same way in the hostel too.

1832
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,920
So even after this,
I will have to wear it?

1833
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:51,760
What are you doing?

1834
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:55,200
If it dampens my clothes,
I will beat you up.

1835
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:56,560
Beat him up.

1836
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,800
Raj has to do what not.

1837
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,200
Exactly.

1838
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:04,800
Hey, forget about it.

1839
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,160
We have gone crazy.

1840
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:10,400
Come on, let's go quickly.

1841
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:12,520
Yes, let's go.

1842
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,400
Slowly. We are here.

1843
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:21,640
I am driving slow.

1844
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,680
So, we are here.

1845
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:31,080
Raju, you made us reach on time.

1846
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,160
We will have to freshen up.
-What?

1847
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:38,120
What did you say?
-They meant fresh.

1848
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,920
They meant brushing.
-You know everything, right?

1849
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,240
Hey.

1850
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,600
I mean, we need to pee. -Hey.

1851
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,840
He has a sore throat it seems.

1852
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,840
Raju Bhai, do one thing.

1853
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,160
Get them inside and
show them the work.

1854
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,600
About the cooking.

1855
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:59,280
There is a lot of pending work.

1856
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,960
Everything is going to be great.

1857
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:02,680
Oh God.

1858
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,880
A lot of work is left. -Yes.

1859
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:08,560
I will have to do everything.

1860
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,880
Come here.

1861
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,240
What have you made me wear?
I can't even breathe.

1862
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:15,920
Are you out of your mind?

1863
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:17,800
Listen.

1864
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,200
Do you see that? Go there.

1865
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:24,920
Put on the veil.

1866
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,960
Please wear this sari. -Yes.

1867
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,720
Put on the veil. Go on, now.

1868
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:39,480
Mansukh Bhai, do this properly.

1869
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:41,840
Do it properly.
Why is it so less?

1870
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,280
Oh dear.

1871
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:48,480
Where are you heading? -We are
going to light up the house.

1872
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:51,280
We don't need lights there.
Who will light up the stage?

1873
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:53,760
Go and do it.

1874
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:57,200
Listen, don't put up red
and yellow lights.

1875
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,240
Do you get it? Do it.

1876
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,440
Wait a second.

1877
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,080
Show it to me.

1878
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:12,200
Whose purse is this?

1879
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,680
Is it not yours?
Where did you find it?

1880
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:45,880
It's my purse. It's mine.

1881
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,760
Come on, get on with your work.

1882
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:52,480
Listen. Show that.

1883
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:57,960
Thank you. Go on.

1884
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,800
What is this?

1885
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,920
What are we even wearing?

1886
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,320
I got a pink purse.

1887
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:13,280
This is my purse.

1888
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,120
Check if it has the necklace.

1889
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:19,720
Wow, we found the necklace.

1890
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,720
Go and give this to
DK right away.

1891
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,480
So we are out of this mess. -Yes.

1892
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:26,680
What are you saying?

1893
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:29,480
If I give it to him, he will
throw me out right away. -Right.

1894
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,240
We'll see what needs to be done.
Listen.

1895
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,680
Look here.

1896
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,040
We will see about the necklace
later. What's..

1897
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,400
..more important is stopping
Simran's wedding.

1898
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,040
Anyhow. -Yes.

1899
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:41,280
Raju Bhai.

1900
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:46,320
Raju Bhai,
all of you are chatting here?

1901
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:48,080
We have called you here to work.

1902
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:51,040
I was telling them the same
thing. -Why are they standing?

1903
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,320
Sister.

1904
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:02,720
Who is this?

1905
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:04,320
Shameless fellow.

1906
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:06,360
How dare you!

1907
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:08,840
Will you sit on our heads? -Hey.

1908
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,040
No, we are just saying.

1909
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:14,200
Don't you have a woman
in your life? -I do.

1910
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,960
You are such a moron! You fool!

1911
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,320
Please don't insult me like that!

1912
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:23,160
Raju Bhai,
tell them what they ought to do.

1913
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,920
The temperature is rising.

1914
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:26,760
Leave. -Yes, I am leaving.

1915
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:30,080
Stupid. Fool. Ruffian. -Hey.

1916
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:32,120
Are you out of your mind?

1917
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,880
Look at him.

1918
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,680
He will get me in trouble.

1919
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,400
You got wafers here?

1920
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,880
Do you want to eat it?
-No, I don't.

1921
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:44,680
You have to work,
you remember right?

1922
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:45,920
Some more work now?

1923
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,760
We have already worn
sari for you.

1924
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:51,600
We have turned into women.
And you want us to work too?

1925
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:54,440
You are talking as if I have
asked you all to have children.

1926
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:57,080
Can't happen. -You will have
to do it, lazy boy.

1927
02:03:57,560 --> 02:03:59,080
You have got powder, haven't you?

1928
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:02,560
Charger, don't worry.
We have arranged for everything.

1929
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:05,680
You all know the plan, right?

1930
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,120
You hide yourself here.

1931
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:09,760
I have to give the necklace,
get ready. I have a lot of work.

1932
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:11,760
Hide yourself.

1933
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:13,960
I will..

1934
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,960
Oh dear.

1935
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:22,800
Do you want to eat it?

1936
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:25,200
No, I don't.

1937
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,840
Simran,
I can't find your waist-chain.

1938
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,040
I will get it.

1939
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:31,320
Raj, do you know?

1940
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:35,200
My grandmother had said before
she passed away..

1941
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,040
..that my husband will make
me wear this necklace.

1942
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:46,200
As grandma said..

1943
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:48,960
..I am your husband now.

1944
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:06,920
Raj,
Jaan will be here in some time.

1945
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:09,240
Raj, please do something.

1946
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,480
I can't live without you.

1947
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,720
Raj, please do something.

1948
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:20,800
I am there with you.

1949
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,640
Don't worry.

1950
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:27,840
Raj and Simran will
always be together.

1951
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:31,240
Always and forever.

1952
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:36,240
No matter what happens,
you won't get married today.

1953
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,920
Simran, what is all this?

1954
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:53,040
Mom, I don't want to get married.

1955
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:55,880
Dear, what are you saying?

1956
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:58,680
If your dad gets to know..

1957
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:00,760
..he will kill you.

1958
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:04,440
I will die but won't get
married to Vikram.

1959
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:11,880
Greetings.

1960
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,560
I am not here to run
away with Simran.

1961
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:22,560
I will not to anything..

1962
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:25,560
..that will tarnish your
family's image.

1963
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:31,200
But I won't let your dear
daughter get married.

1964
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:34,600
To tell you the truth.

1965
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:37,520
Even I don't like Vikram.

1966
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:41,800
I am with both of you.

1967
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:45,320
But, be careful of one thing.

1968
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,840
That in all of this..

1969
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,000
..there shouldn't be
any loss to life.

1970
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:54,240
Mom, don't worry.
Everything will be great.

1971
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:58,280
Raju, that's true.
To tell you the truth..

1972
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:02,040
..even I don't like Vikram.

1973
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,040
Bannerilal is forcefully
getting her married.

1974
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:09,240
Sister, even I am with you.

1975
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,120
Everything is going to be great.

1976
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:16,400
Thank you Bhagu Bhai.

1977
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:17,760
Raju Bhai.

1978
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:22,720
I love you.

1979
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,160
I will leave. I have a lot
of work to finish sister.

1980
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,240
Everything will be great.

1981
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:45,200
Hey, the powder is fine, right?

1982
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:49,640
Once someone drinks this,
the stomach churning will begin.

1983
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:54,840
"Sanskrit Chants."

1984
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:58,880
"Sanskrit Chants."

1985
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:00,920
"Sanskrit Chants."

1986
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:04,520
"Sanskrit Chants.". -Priest.
-"Sanskrit Chants.". -It's so hot.

1987
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,160
Give it to him.

1988
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,560
Give it to the priest.

1989
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,440
Yes, give it to him too.
-"Sanskrit Chants."

1990
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:10,880
"Sanskrit Chants."

1991
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,640
"Sanskrit Chants."
-Drink everyone.

1992
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:21,680
"Sanskrit Chants."

1993
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:24,160
"Sanskrit Chants."

1994
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:28,640
"Sanskrit Chants." Get the bride.

1995
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:44,560
Here.

1996
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:53,520
Simran is looking like an angel.

1997
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:57,080
Charger is going to be so happy.

1998
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:14,560
"The boys got the
necklace back."

1999
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:17,760
"Why didn't he tell me?"

2000
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:43,440
The rituals are going on.

2001
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,920
Oh God.

2002
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,440
Hey, where did they go?

2003
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:35,280
Priest. -Let me go in.

2004
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:39,920
Oh God.

2005
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:42,840
Priest, is everything done?

2006
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,840
Hey! Priest!

2007
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,360
Did you finish everything?

2008
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:58,040
Hey!

2009
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,920
Oh my God.

2010
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:12,080
Let me go.

2011
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,240
Priest, please let me go.

2012
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:17,400
Oh God. Do it quickly, priest.

2013
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:21,640
Priest, let me go in.

2014
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:24,200
Oh priest.

2015
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:28,560
Priest.

2016
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:31,680
Priest.

2017
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:49,560
Oh God.

2018
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:02,080
Let's go.

2019
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:06,040
Come on.

2020
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:14,920
Is everything done?

2021
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:18,240
Come on, let' go ahead.

2022
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:20,320
Come on.

2023
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:25,320
Come on everyone.

2024
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:42,200
"Sanskrit Chants."

2025
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:44,440
"Sanskrit Chants."
-We will have to do something.

2026
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:47,080
"Sanskrit Chants."
-I can't see her getting married.

2027
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:51,360
I will stop the wedding anyhow.

2028
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:54,160
I will go and tell DK that
Simran and I are in love.

2029
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:55,960
No matter what happens.

2030
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:58,440
I can't see this. Leave me.

2031
02:13:58,600 --> 02:13:59,960
Charger.

2032
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:01,240
Stop.

2033
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,320
Oh.

2034
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,320
What's happening?

2035
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:26,400
Come here, grandpa.

2036
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,920
Come in.

2037
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:41,360
Father, what is it?

2038
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:45,120
The auspicious time has passed.
This wedding can't happen.

2039
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:47,560
But grandpa, there's no other
auspicious time for six months.

2040
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:49,520
Even if it is six months,
I don't care.

2041
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:51,880
The marriage won't happen
in an inauspicious time.

2042
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:53,796
Father is right.

2043
02:14:53,876 --> 02:14:55,320
You shouldn't get married
in an inauspicious time.

2044
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:59,280
It's about our daughter's life.

2045
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:02,280
We can't risk Simran's life.

2046
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,680
Yes father. I won't get married
in an inauspicious time.

2047
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:08,600
Dear, since when do you
believe in all this?

2048
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:12,840
Som Bhai,
what do you have to say?

2049
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:16,880
We are ready to wait for six
months. -Dad, that can't happen.

2050
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:19,480
I don't care about the
auspicious time.

2051
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:20,800
I will get married today.

2052
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,480
Dear,
six months will pass in a jiffy.

2053
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:25,920
You can prepare for your
exams until then.

2054
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:28,120
After six months..

2055
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:30,920
..when we get an auspicious time,
we will get you married.

2056
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:13,560
"I want to chill with you.
Get some cash rolling."

2057
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:15,960
"Let's party hard and
dance a little."

2058
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:18,680
"Come on, dance with me."

2059
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:23,360
"Come on, hit the dance floor."

2060
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:25,800
"Rock and roll.."

2061
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,560
"Talk to me."

2062
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:30,920
"Talk to me."

2063
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:35,240
"Life is a spring."

2064
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:37,640
"I am ready to marry you."

2065
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:40,040
"No doubt me."

2066
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:42,160
"How do I tell you what's
in my heart?"

2067
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:44,760
"I can't convey my love to you."

2068
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:47,200
"But I can't live without you."

2069
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:49,440
"No matter what,
we'll handle it."

2070
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:51,880
"No matter what,
we'll handle it."

2071
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,720
"Come on, we'll handle it.
Come on, we'll handle it."

2072
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:01,080
"You only live once."

2073
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:06,120
"You only live once."

2074
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:11,880
"Come on, we'll handle it.
Come on, we'll handle it."
