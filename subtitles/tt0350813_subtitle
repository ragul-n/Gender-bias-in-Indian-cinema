00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:02,990
"I am robbed in this city of yours,
o beautiful girls."

4
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:17,268
"I am robbed in this city of yours,
o beautiful girls."

5
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:54,994
"These eyes turn often,
as if they were asking something."

6
00:01:55,221 --> 00:02:02,485
"These eyes turn often,
as if they were asking something."

7
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:10,328
"These red lips sigh,
as if they were waiting for someone."

8
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:18,643
"I am robbed in this city of yours,
o beautiful girls."

9
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:58,085
"Look, o nice girls,
I've come from far."

10
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:05,387
Look, o nice girls,
I've come from far.

11
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:13,245
O beauties of this landscape,
I am also waiting in your path.

12
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:21,833
I am robbed in this city of yours,
o beautiful girls.

13
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:59,709
Your style is full of colors.
Listen to me.

14
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:07,297
Your style is full of colors.
Listen to me.

15
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:14,864
A voice is coming from
deep inside my heart.

16
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:23,302
I am robbed in this city of yours,
o beautiful girls.

17
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:37,602
I am robbed in this city of yours,
o beautiful girls.

18
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:04,904
- Have you come here for the 1st time?
- Yes.

19
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,170
- How did you find the swimming pool?
- Very nice.

20
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:11,872
- You must be knowing how to swim very well.
- Not at all!

21
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:13,455
- Not at all?
- No.

22
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,182
- Ok, tell me, which game do you like to play?
- Tennis.

23
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,348
Oh lucky.

24
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:21,391
- Is that also your favorite game?
- Not mine. My friend's.

25
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:23,488
Hello Deepak.

26
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:24,635
Hello partner.

27
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,528
He is my friend.
God has created him at leisure.

28
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,492
He is a very good dancer.
And sings very well, too.

29
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:35,004
He is an expert at making passes.
But tennis...

30
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,323
Sapan! Sapan, help her.

31
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,508
Sapan, come fast. Seema!

32
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,557
I'm very sorry.

33
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,608
I should have fallen instead of you.

34
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:09,592
Thank you.

35
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,465
- What is this behavior?
- It is to our benefit.

36
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:14,900
God had planned it.

37
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,980
Not God, it was you.
She didn't fall. You fell her.

38
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,099
Did you see me?

39
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:24,103
No, I didn't. But I know you well.

40
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,643
Hey, what happened?

41
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:28,954
I fell in the water.

42
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,267
How?

43
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,618
I'm also thinking about that.

44
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,686
I'm fulfilling my duty as a friend.

45
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,821
I want your dull life
to be full of colors.

46
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,279
You'll forget swimming,
and learn flying in the air.

47
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:46,738
I'll forget walking. Your stupidity
will put me in trouble someday.

48
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:52,004
Mister, one does not fall in love
by tricks. It happens on its own.

49
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,671
Gone are those days when
love happened by itself.

50
00:06:56,001 --> 00:07:00,259
Now one has to fall in love.
Or one can be made to fall in love.

51
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,071
- Just see. I'll make you love this same girl one day.
- Really?

52
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,459
- What's the news, Mr. Prasad?
- The orphanage is ready.

53
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,022
And the fresh news is
that you are inaugurating it.

54
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:16,785
- Me? No. Please, excuse me.
- What are you saying?

55
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:19,886
How's that possible? This orphanage
was built with your support.

56
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:23,942
- You see...
- No, Mr. Rai, it's only you who'll inaugurate it.

57
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,590
Because there's no
one like you in this city.

58
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,721
The thing is that I...

59
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:34,116
Hello.

60
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:36,140
Yes? Yes, he's here. Just a minute.

61
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:43,838
It's the lawyer.

62
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:45,866
Yes?

63
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:50,127
Look, try to compromise
as far as possible.

64
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,940
No, don't sue him.
Give one more chance to the poor.

65
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:55,969
All right.

66
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,208
Ok, you need fund
for your school, right?

67
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:03,465
- Look, give him his due.
- Thank you very much.

68
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,003
Mr. Hariprasad,
can you wait for a week?

69
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:12,577
Mr. Rai, I can wait for a year.
I just came over to meet you.

70
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,054
Mr. Rai, what about the inauguration?

71
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,380
- As you all say. I'll come over.
- Thank you very much. Greetings.

72
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,422
Father, have you had your medicines?

73
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:30,890
I'm tired of eating medicines.

74
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:33,075
Look, you'll have
a heart attack again.

75
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:37,056
Munimji, bring father's medicines.

76
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,362
Greetings, mister!

77
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,541
I said, greetings, mister.

78
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:43,825
Wait.

79
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,458
Bahadur!

80
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,001
Come in.

81
00:08:57,575 --> 00:09:03,488
Here, take this. I couldn't
recognize you in this outfit.

82
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:06,181
It is by the grace
of people like you.

83
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:09,006
Someone gave me the coat,
and someone gave the hat.

84
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:12,306
That's why a poor like me
could meet a rich one like you.

85
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:15,754
Else your watchman
wouldn't let me in.

86
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,394
Greetings, mister.

87
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,749
Father, who is this man?
You forget everything whenever he comes.

88
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,063
I remember a person's helplessness.

89
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,618
Child, you know that
many people come here.

90
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,538
And take what's
written in their fate.

91
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:50,344
- Father, I was...
- Didn't you get my medicines? Tejasingh!

92
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:51,738
Tejasingh!

93
00:09:58,953 --> 00:10:02,461
O Ram! There's so much dust!
Get up from the chair.

94
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:04,645
You made me do a
mistake in the accounts.

95
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:07,140
You are obsessed with cleanliness.

96
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,518
- Am I right?
- You are wrong.

97
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:13,808
- Bahadur, tidy up this table.
- Yes.

98
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:18,513
Come here. Wipe this table.

99
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,371
Seema, have you put the
clothes neatly in the wardrobe?

100
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:22,809
Yes, mother.

101
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,198
Clean it nicely. Clean up here first.

102
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,495
Oh God!

103
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,892
You are used to sitting in dust.

104
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:38,889
Bahadur, come and wipe down here.

105
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,372
Wipe here.

106
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,015
Good. Over there.

107
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,612
Clean like this.

108
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:49,742
Look, who is it.

109
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,197
When will I go to Bombay?

110
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:01,105
Bahadur, where are you going?

111
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,738
There's a book for baby.
I'm going up to give it to her.

112
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:08,394
Clean up the chairs.
And then the sofa.

113
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:11,193
Climb up on a table,
and wipe the glass of the window.

114
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:15,066
- I got it. I have to clean all the doors and the windows.
- Yes.

115
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:28,887
Seema, since the day I've seen you,
I've forgotten myself.

116
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:31,330
How would you know that my life in...

117
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,926
an unfulfilled dream without you?

118
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,810
The thing I read in
your eyes yesterday...

119
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:40,159
I'm answering for that today.

120
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,477
Sapan.

121
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,367
Seema!

122
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,546
What is it, mother?

123
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:56,728
Who is this Sapan?

124
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,790
Sapan?

125
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,379
Yes, he's a guy at the club.
Why do you ask?

126
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:06,324
- You meet him everyday, right?
- Yes. I meet him everyday.

127
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,778
That's why he passing
letters in the books!

128
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:13,989
- Letters?
- Yes, letters.

129
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,108
What a way to make
your family famous!

130
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,278
Here, read about your deeds.

131
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,776
You play the game
of love in the club.

132
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,855
What a shame!
You are defaming your parents.

133
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:36,727
I never liked this club and all that.
But who listens to me?

134
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:39,409
You'll understand only
after we're degraded.

135
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,352
Mom, this is...
there's nothing like what you think.

136
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,853
If there was nothing,
why would you get this letter?

137
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:52,682
I also want to ask the same thing.
Why did he write this letter?

138
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,057
So..

139
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:12,815
Listen!

140
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,190
- I want to say something to you.
- About what?

141
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:21,961
About love, Mr. Sapan.
You love me, don't you?

142
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,499
What are you saying?

143
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:26,794
Read this.

144
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:36,249
Since the day I've seen you,
I've forgotten myself...

145
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:40,616
Aren't you ashamed to write
such a thing to a decent girl?

146
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,774
How dare you send me a love letter?

147
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:46,946
Look, it's a mistake.
No, it's not a mistake, it's false.

148
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,079
It's true. Since the day I've
come to this club, you're after me.

149
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:51,829
I've been noticing
from the beginning.

150
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,126
You created chances
and circumstances.

151
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:57,410
You even tried to come
close to me the wrong way. Why?

152
00:13:57,746 --> 00:14:01,458
- You're misunderstanding me.
- No, you're misunderstanding it.

153
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:04,270
You take yourself
to be very handsome.

154
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:07,581
Look at yourself in the mirror
before loving a girl. Got it?

155
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:09,565
- Listen to me, please.
- Mind you!

156
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,862
If you ever try to irritate me again,
I'll hand you over to the police.

157
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,121
It happened just what I had told you.

158
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,658
- I was sure she would reply with love to your love.
- Got the reply?

159
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:27,085
Your game has defamed
me in front of the people.

160
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:30,377
Your stubbornness has put me in a
situation where I can't face anyone.

161
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,533
Forgive me, pal. I made a mistake.

162
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:35,387
I didn't know she
would be so bad tempered.

163
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,703
My plan did not turn
out as I had thought.

164
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,464
She's an educated fool!

165
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:44,364
What makes me angry is that, why didn't
she tell me all that privately?

166
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,913
Right. That's what I say, too.

167
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:48,014
Doesn't matter, Deepak.

168
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:51,807
She'll pay for the show
she made in front of everyone.

169
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:54,250
I'll make her forget all her pomp.

170
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:58,529
She hates me today.
But she'll have to love me some day.

171
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:06,520
Seema, are you the sleep of my eyes,
or my dream...

172
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,627
You are a beautiful
picture of this universe.

173
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:17,483
O sweetheart, listen to
the complaint of your lover.

174
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:23,322
Your acceptance is my life.
And your refusal is my death.

175
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:28,311
O Lord! Leave my hand.
It'll be sprained.

176
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:29,752
Did you like it?

177
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,362
Not at all.
Your style is very theatrical.

178
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,804
You look scared.
And there are no emotions.

179
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,585
I feel I won't be able to do this.

180
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,312
I feel that, too.

181
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:43,682
But, pal,
yesterday's rehearsal was very good.

182
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,122
- Come.
- Come.

183
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,657
Seema,

184
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:52,405
which crossroad is this...

185
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,715
where I remember you
while I'm trying to forget you?

186
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:01,458
You don't know that you're
close to my heart despite being far.

187
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:09,219
O the one who comes in my dreams,
do I come in your dreams too?

188
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,302
Mr. Pyarelal, how long we'll
do with one tea for two people?

189
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:25,078
Just wait and watch!
I'll soon turn this tea into Biryani.

190
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:28,201
All the resources are
getting scarce in the world.

191
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:32,816
But the disease of
love is so widespread...

192
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,950
that it has spread
even to the old and kids alike.

193
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,721
But, Mr. Pyarelal,
what will you gain by that?

194
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,974
I've convinced the
secretary of the club.

195
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:48,550
I'll give a lecture tomorrow
by playing professor B.N.R. Chaube.

196
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,004
There will be a queue of lovers here.

197
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:58,858
Because there's a doctor for every
illness. But no one to cure love.

198
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:01,301
Except professor B.N.R. Chaube.

199
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:14,582
Lover boys and lover girls!

200
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:21,438
The subject I am champion in is love.

201
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:27,590
The world knows all those
mad lovers of the past.

202
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:31,524
But for your information
and brought casting.

203
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:37,495
That means,
Laila-Majnu, Shirin-Farhad...

204
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,084
Heer-Ranja and Romeo-Juliet.

205
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,532
But they were unsuccessful lovers.

206
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:48,355
Means for your information
and brought casting.

207
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:55,027
If I had been born in their era,
or if they were born in my times...

208
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:58,498
I would have made
sure that Shirin got Farhad...

209
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:05,996
Heer got Ranja
and Juliet got her Romeo.

210
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:14,087
For your information
and brought casting.

211
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:19,547
I've studied every aspect of
love from waiting room to bed room.

212
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,645
And I reached the conclusion
that love today is unskillful.

213
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:26,158
And the reason for that is education.

214
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,340
So, are you trying to say
that today's education is useless?

215
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,513
I haven't said anything like that.

216
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:34,471
Looks like you want
me to run the government.

217
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:38,229
What I meant was
the education of love.

218
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,176
What whispering is
going on this corner?

219
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:45,074
Professor, can I ask you a question?

220
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:48,596
- Have you ever loved anyone?
- Of course.

221
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:52,729
I loved milk as soon as I was born.
The feeding bottle in the childhood.

222
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:57,038
The sports in adolescence,
a mad girl in the youth.

223
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:00,596
And the money in the old age.

224
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:07,334
Mr. Chaube, where would the
butterfly go if there was no light?

225
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:10,281
They would be handling
the municipality lamps.

226
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:11,686
The government lights!

227
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:17,103
Mr. Chaube, when does love pay off?

228
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:20,852
What did you say?
When does love pay off?

229
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:24,917
When the family of both
lovers come to know about them.

230
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,277
Wow, well said.

231
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:31,668
Great.

232
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:38,461
You ask too many questions.
I'm going. I've got a lot of work.

233
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,858
Just a minute, Mr. Chaube.

234
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:42,228
Please, answer my
question before going.

235
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:48,015
What if a wicked guy
is after an innocent girl?

236
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,652
This is not a question.
It is a problem.

237
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:57,151
And you have to come to B.N.R.
Chaube's house for a problem.

238
00:19:57,343 --> 00:20:01,465
Note down the address. 421, Mal Road.

239
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,347
421, Mal Road.

240
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,699
All right. Where will you hide now?

241
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:13,252
Hail love! Hail love!

242
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,409
Get the lunch fast!

243
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:20,646
Coming.

244
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,136
Very good!

245
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:38,768
- What is this?
- What do I do?

246
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:41,140
Couldn't convince the hotel owner.
So I convinced the gram seller.

247
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:43,926
- Convinced the gram seller?
- I don't understand this business.

248
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,269
You've lost even the tea and bread,
and come down to grams.

249
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:48,839
You shouldn't talk
while eating. Start.

250
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,190
Why shouldn't I talk?

251
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:52,299
Instead of the debt getting reduced,
it is increasing.

252
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,456
I don't get this
moustache and beard...

253
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,706
This moustache and beard
protects us from the creditors.

254
00:20:57,894 --> 00:20:59,237
Else we would be in trouble.

255
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:05,907
- Scapegoat! See that he's not a creditor.
- Sure.

256
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:15,996
Boss, there are two scapegoats.

257
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,895
Make good money from them.
We're under a big debt.

258
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:23,456
One shouldn't tighten
the screw very hard.

259
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:27,158
- Or it will break off.
- That's correct.

260
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:29,205
Go and call them.
I'll handle everything.

261
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:35,363
Come in.

262
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:37,158
Morning

263
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,118
- Good morning professor.
- Morning.

264
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,673
- Who are they?
- We have a case.

265
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,134
- Did they take an appointment?
- No.

266
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:49,305
Fine.

267
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:51,041
Ok, your turn will
come on the 15th of...

268
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:53,319
next month.
We have a very heavy booking.

269
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,855
But, boss, they're special people.

270
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:57,886
You'll have to do something for them.

271
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:04,887
Ok, I can break my principles,
but not the heart of my patients.

272
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:07,620
Extra charge for breaking
the principles. 5 rupees.

273
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:11,502
- I don't mind.
- You don't? Then sit on the chair.

274
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:18,190
- My name is Sapan.
- And my name is Deepak.

275
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:20,792
But I don't handle 2 cases together.

276
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,876
The case is mine.
He is just my friend.

277
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,456
- Will he be with you, too?
- Yes.

278
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:28,414
- Extra man, extra charge! 5 rupees more.
- I agree to that.

279
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,335
The thing is that a girl insulted me.

280
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,796
In private, or in front of everyone?

281
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:37,215
- In front of everyone.
- You mean openly? That's bad.

282
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:39,742
New case, extra charge!
5 rupees more.

283
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:43,273
Don't tighten the screw so much!

284
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,315
Professor,
I want to revenge that girl.

285
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:49,727
Tell me a trick which
will make that girl love me.

286
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,066
But...

287
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:54,913
- But you hate her?
- Exactly.

288
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,970
That means she sees tragedy,
while you twist.

289
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:03,018
She keeps awake all night,
while you sleep peacefully.

290
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:09,397
- Exactly.
- I got it. You drink liquor, but she gets intoxicated.

291
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,922
We'll have to make
the river flow up stream.

292
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:17,791
Upstream?
Extra charge! 5 rupees more.

293
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,088
Never mind.

294
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:21,695
We want our program to
be successful by any means.

295
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:29,567
Sure. Now only one point is left.
Our work is like voting.

296
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,009
Do you want it to be
done urgently or ordinarily?

297
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,981
- Urgently!
- Double charge for urgent work!

298
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:39,945
- Don't worry about the fees.
- Then you don't worry about the formula.

299
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:43,855
See, I have many of them.

300
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:49,773
Formula no.
47 will suit you well. Here.

301
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:54,177
Take the envelope
and fulfill your goals.

302
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:57,581
- Thank very much.
- Thank you.

303
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:03,087
- Take the fees.
- Mister, pay the bill before you go.

304
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:06,034
It is 90 rupees.

305
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:08,754
- Here.
- Is it more?

306
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:13,163
No, it's right. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50...

307
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:18,975
- It's my salary.
- It will be deposited in our bank.

308
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,188
It's time to meet my sweetheart.

309
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,795
Go and get me a chicken recipe.

310
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,052
Do you have matches?

311
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,708
You're fond of cigarettes,
why don't you have the matches?

312
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:10,563
Greetings, good evening, greetings.

313
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:13,066
Sweetheart, I've spoken 3 languages.

314
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:15,683
Hindi, English and Urdu.
Answer at least one of them.

315
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:19,451
You don't even look at me.
Where are you going?

316
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:22,611
You have very different principles.

317
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,928
You keep following me.
You've made my life difficult.

318
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,628
Come, my heart is restless.

319
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:33,729
Don't be so stubborn. Have mercy.

320
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:38,276
Where are you going?
Listen to me. I was saying...

321
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:40,483
No, I wasn't saying anything. Go.

322
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:44,097
I've told you a thousand
times that I hate you.

323
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:49,205
And I've told you a thousand
times that I love you.

324
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:54,160
You are ruining the one
who comes to you with love?

325
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:58,032
It is very difficult to
find a person who loves you.

326
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:18,886
There's no break!

327
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:24,192
It'll be fun now.
He'll go without the breaks.

328
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,674
Who are you?

329
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:49,487
What do you want?

330
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:51,651
Why don't you tell me?

331
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:56,542
Help!

332
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:12,261
- Sapan, these goons are following me.
- Goons? - Yes.

333
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,035
Wait.

334
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:19,503
So, dear?

335
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:29,662
What are you doing?

336
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,408
Thank you very much.
I hope you're not hurt.

337
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,115
Madam, it's not safe to
roam around alone like this.

338
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:02,312
- Times are bad these days, got it?
- Thank you for this advice.

339
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:13,552
I saw that Sapan freed
that girl from those goons...

340
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:16,596
and gave them so many punches,
that they fled away.

341
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:19,770
Which girl?
What Sapan? What are you saying?

342
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,855
After that girl went away...

343
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:25,443
some 4 - 5 goons came
and smashed Sapan badly.

344
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:28,136
Even the doctor was scared.

345
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:30,488
- Is he injured much?
- Very much.

346
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,485
What's his address?

347
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,698
Shanti Nivas, Mount Everest Road.
Every child knows that.

348
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:49,633
I'll be right back.

349
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,425
- Hello.
- Hello.

350
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,195
Sapan, our formula has worked 100%

351
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:05,089
Seema is coming to see you.
Get the bandages wrapped up.

352
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:08,367
- Why?
- She should know that you are injured.

353
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:10,362
Listen to me.

354
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:17,067
- Champa! - Yes, sir.
- A fair, nice girl will arrive just now.

355
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,782
Let her sit in my room.

356
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:21,482
And tell her that Sapan has
gone to the doctor for dressing.

357
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:25,636
No, sir. I don't see any wound,
and you're going to wrap bandages?

358
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:27,901
You won't get it.
Just do what I tell you.

359
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:29,053
What will you say?

360
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:33,520
- Sir has gone to the doctor to change his bandages.
- Good.

361
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,673
Come, madam.

362
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:43,393
- Greetings.
- Oh, it's you!

363
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,347
How are you?

364
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:46,938
- Fine.
- And Mr. Gupta?

365
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:50,948
- He's also fine.
- Have a seat. What brings you here? - I...

366
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:56,733
- She's come to visit sir.
- Sapan must be upstairs. Go.

367
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:58,455
Yes, come.

368
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,700
Please, sit here and relax.

369
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:08,954
Sir has gone to the doctor
to change the bandages.

370
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:11,580
- He must be coming soon.
- Can he walk now?

371
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:16,151
He didn't walk earlier either.
Went everywhere in his car.

372
00:31:16,232 --> 00:31:19,659
No, I mean, is he badly wounded?

373
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:22,619
That only doctor would know,
or he himself.

374
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,003
He got injured because of love.

375
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:30,683
Is your name Seema?

376
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,424
How do you know?

377
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:38,609
Sir keeps talking about you
all the time. How wouldn't I know?

378
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:43,632
Sir and bro Deepak
have kept all his...

379
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:46,441
conversation to you in that machine.

380
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:49,447
- Where?
- In that machine.

381
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,929
Look, I'm very thirsty.
Will you get me a glass of water?

382
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:57,295
Why not?

383
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:16,634
Which crossroad is this...

384
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:19,082
where I remember you
while I'm trying to forget you?

385
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:23,892
You don't know that you're
close to my heart despite being far.

386
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:27,795
You, who pass through my dreams...

387
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:31,552
have you any place
for me in your dreams?

388
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,370
The rehearsal is going well.

389
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:36,815
It would be fun if it
goes well in front of Seema.

390
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:40,201
Don't worry.
I'll try my best to take revenge.

391
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:44,116
I'll trap her in love so
that she'll be left restless.

392
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:46,520
And I'll keep watching the show.

393
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,819
Seema! You, here?

394
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:12,365
I haven't come. It's your
love which has dragged me here.

395
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:23,652
What a plight you are in! You look
more injured than what I had heard.

396
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,899
Would you come only
if I was more injured?

397
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:29,903
Don't embarrass me more, Sapan.
I made a mistake.

398
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,793
Why did you risk your life for me?

399
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,734
I don't want anything
in life except you.

400
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,745
I can give my life for you.

401
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:43,569
If you say anything more,
I'll cry. Come.

402
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:46,446
Is it hurting very much?

403
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,070
I am very sorry.

404
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:49,467
Lie down.

405
00:33:58,751 --> 00:33:59,751
C'mon.

406
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:02,797
Good.

407
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,334
Have patience, Sapan.
Everything will be fine.

408
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:17,185
- Water!
- Water? No, first I'll give you the medicine.

409
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,868
- Medicine?
- Yes.

410
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,483
The dose is not mentioned here.

411
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,527
Looks like you have to
drink it in a single time.

412
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:27,873
Seema, it's too much.

413
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,532
Don't act childish.

414
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:40,277
Come. Open your mouth. Come on.

415
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:46,586
You'll recover fast if you
drink more medicine. Open your mouth.

416
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:50,556
Drink.

417
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,642
- Is it very bitter?
- Yes. No!

418
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,692
- Seema, how much do you love me?
- As much as you love me.

419
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:08,026
Look, an injured person
should not talk much.

420
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:15,306
Hey, you've got a cold.
Your hands are getting colder.

421
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:18,287
Wait!

422
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,324
Seema, what are you doing?

423
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:25,448
Keep lying quietly.
Just see what I do.

424
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:30,637
Here. You've caught a cold.
Keep lied down.

425
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:45,043
- What are you doing, Seema?
- Just keep watching what happens.

426
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:49,211
Cover your face, too.
Or you'll feel cold.

427
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:51,421
Put your hands in.

428
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:02,660
- How do you feel now, Sapan?
- Very well.

429
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,074
- I hope you're not feeling much pain.
- No.

430
00:36:07,155 --> 00:36:10,031
- No, I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

431
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:15,849
It happens in love sometimes.
Go to sleep. Close your eyes.

432
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:18,322
Bravo!

433
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:26,364
Close your eyes. Don't get up.
Just keep lying like this.

434
00:37:01,272 --> 00:37:03,726
Your coquetry will kill me someday.

435
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:06,595
It will kill someone.
And you'll remain alive.

436
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,765
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you?

437
00:37:09,957 --> 00:37:12,611
Love and wait are lifelong
companions, Seema.

438
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,689
Forget it.
You have this habit of annoying me.

439
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,326
I've learned this habit from you.

440
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:20,062
Really?

441
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:51,801
"My dear, don't ever say
that you'll live life without me."

442
00:37:53,688 --> 00:38:01,688
"My dear, because you are my life."

443
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:13,782
"You are my life."

444
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:23,169
"Wherever you go, my dear.
Just stay near my heart."

445
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:31,632
"Darling, because you are my life."

446
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:35,961
"You are my life."

447
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:40,880
"You are my life."

448
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,297
"You are my life."

449
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:07,510
"There wouldn't be any spring,
and no flowers would bloom."

450
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:12,707
"If I didn't meet you in my life."

451
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:19,229
"You've come dancing to my heart."

452
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:23,656
"You've upset everything
like a gush of wind."

453
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:31,736
"There's a little relief and
a little restlessness in your life."

454
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:37,442
"Come close to me.
This is a delicate moment."

455
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:45,699
"Something is after my heart."

456
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:54,700
"My desire,
my support, stay close to my heart."

457
00:39:57,168 --> 00:40:02,874
"Because you are my life."

458
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:07,139
"You are my life."

459
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:12,083
"You are my life."

460
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,306
"You are my life."

461
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:44,537
"The world is fatal. Hold my hand."

462
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:49,206
"The path of love is waiting for us."

463
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:55,958
"The one who'd leave
his house after you..."

464
00:40:56,195 --> 00:41:00,079
"Will not stop fearing the world."

465
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:04,699
"I've always seen love being murdered."

466
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,314
"And the beauty crying secretly."

467
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:13,915
"How can anyone ruin
me if you love me?"

468
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:18,542
"If you glance at me,
I'd become alive."

469
00:41:18,622 --> 00:41:22,987
"If you glance at me,
I'd become alive."

470
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:31,180
"I'd die of grief.
Don't say that again."

471
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:38,951
"Because, You are my life."

472
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:43,318
"You are my life."

473
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:48,226
"You are my life."

474
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:52,183
"You are my life."

475
00:41:52,806 --> 00:42:00,806
"My dear, don't ever say
that you'll live life without me."

476
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:08,637
"My dear, because you are my life."

477
00:42:08,848 --> 00:42:12,993
"You are my life."

478
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:17,713
"You are my life."

479
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:22,011
"You are my life."

480
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:46,115
It's spring.
Come, my dear, I'm waiting for you.

481
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:48,899
Usha, what took you so long?

482
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:51,729
There was a lot of
work at the office today.

483
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:55,525
Really? Listen.
Does that goon still follow you?

484
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:58,551
He follows me everyday.
I'm tired of him.

485
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,483
You're tired? I'm getting
thinner worried about you!

486
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:08,974
I've got a solution.
A guru has come to our city.

487
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,151
- A guru?
- Yes, only he has the cure of that rascal.

488
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:16,190
Just see, Usha.
He'll stop roaming around you.

489
00:43:16,412 --> 00:43:18,984
I'll change my name if
I don't teach him a lesson.

490
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,708
Mr. Chaube!

491
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:33,154
Get ready!

492
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:44,430
Mr. Chaube, greetings.
I hope you're fine.

493
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:46,350
You know me?

494
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:50,297
I'd seen you once.
And haven't forgot you till now.

495
00:43:50,614 --> 00:43:54,439
- You're famous in this city.
- It's by your grace.

496
00:43:54,991 --> 00:44:01,601
Do me a little favor.
I'm very tensed. A goon is following.

497
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:03,996
You?

498
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:06,371
You are very...

499
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:07,488
Oh God!

500
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:09,643
- Had you taken an appointment?
- Yes, I had.

501
00:44:09,724 --> 00:44:12,087
Sit down. I was saying that...

502
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:14,237
he has made it difficult
to get out of the house.

503
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:18,159
- He is not affected by warnings.
- Same is with me.

504
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:21,718
Then you'll have
to use formula no. 41.

505
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:22,798
- 41!
- Yes.

506
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:29,959
41.40 plus 1. But are you also...

507
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:33,068
Oh! My hand!

508
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:34,919
Here is.

509
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:37,501
Very good!

510
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:42,390
- You'll have to love him.
- O Lord Ram!

511
00:44:42,743 --> 00:44:47,280
Whenever he meets you now,
talk to him nicely.

512
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:50,445
Spread your hair on the shoulders.

513
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:57,725
With a smile on the lips,
looking into his eyes, just hug him.

514
00:44:57,805 --> 00:45:00,000
- I've hugged him.
- Secretary.

515
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:05,711
- Then?
- Then walking gracefully...

516
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:11,225
tell him darling,
meet me somewhere this evening.

517
00:45:11,441 --> 00:45:15,020
Darling,
meet me somewhere this evening.

518
00:45:16,204 --> 00:45:19,633
- Then, Mr. Chaube?
- Then formula no. 41.

519
00:45:19,848 --> 00:45:25,532
Stand two healthy,
strong men over there.

520
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:32,400
When that rascal comes over,
start the formula. Thrash him.

521
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:35,505
For your information brought casting.

522
00:45:35,585 --> 00:45:40,996
The fever of love will vanish
from all his 7 generations.

523
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,815
Good morning!

524
00:45:51,388 --> 00:45:52,525
Good morning!

525
00:45:53,897 --> 00:45:54,986
Good morning?

526
00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:05,051
- Did you answer my 'good morning'?
- Yes, I did.

527
00:46:05,737 --> 00:46:08,608
You turned out to be strong
of your ethics.

528
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:11,062
You won me after all.

529
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,044
Darling, listen to me.

530
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:18,755
What are you saying, darling?
I don't believe this.

531
00:46:19,215 --> 00:46:23,368
I'm telling the truth, Pyarelal.
You come in my dreams.

532
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,821
Do I also come in your dreams?

533
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:28,492
I'm unable to sleep.
How would I dream?

534
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:31,529
That's why I visit
this road 16 times a day.

535
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:35,779
I troubled you a lot, Pyarelal.
Please, forgive me.

536
00:46:36,371 --> 00:46:38,156
I really troubled you a lot.

537
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:44,919
Darling, don't overload me
with so much happiness. Or I'll die.

538
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:48,743
I feel like talking
many a things to you.

539
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:52,137
Darling, meet me somewhere today.

540
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:55,015
I'll come by any means.
Tell me the place.

541
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:56,617
Place?

542
00:46:57,656 --> 00:47:01,668
- Yes, Honeymoon Point. At 5 o'clock exactly. Ok?
- Ok.

543
00:47:02,146 --> 00:47:03,146
Bye...

544
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:10,104
- 5 o'clock.
- 5 o'clock? I'll go and wait there from this minute.

545
00:47:11,682 --> 00:47:14,591
Hey you Majnu! Stand up!

546
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,490
Has the father of
Laila sent you here?

547
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:20,249
- Laila's sister has sent us.
- Who is her sis? - Usha.

548
00:47:20,578 --> 00:47:24,767
- I don't know anyone by this name.
- Catch him!

549
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:35,542
Bro, look where he's gone.

550
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:04,296
- Help!
- Thrash him. - Help.

551
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:19,134
Vanish this formula 41 from
the office. Or he'll vanish me.

552
00:48:19,216 --> 00:48:22,444
- It was close, boss.
- Mr. Chaube!

553
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,015
Don't let her in.

554
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,936
- But I can't go.
- Go. Go or she'll come in.

555
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:35,771
- The professor cannot meet you today.
- Move aside!

556
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,856
Greetings, Mr. Chaube.
Here, flowers for you.

557
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:43,007
- She is my younger sister Usha.
- Hello.

558
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,568
Glad to meet her.

559
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:48,490
Why was the office closed for 3 days?

560
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:54,549
It was going to be closed forever.
But I am saved.

561
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:56,660
Why is your face swollen?

562
00:48:56,848 --> 00:48:59,595
- I was beaten by my own trick.
- What do you mean?

563
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:03,271
That means my wisdom
tooth is coming out.

564
00:49:03,351 --> 00:49:04,351
Oh God!

565
00:49:04,598 --> 00:49:06,770
You were not short of wisdom.

566
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:10,386
Whom will you show so much wisdom?

567
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:13,628
Mr. Chaube,
that goon was irritating her.

568
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,924
The scene was worth watching
when that goon was being smashed.

569
00:49:20,005 --> 00:49:22,458
I wish I was there.

570
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,769
The very first blow was so hard
that his teeth might have broken.

571
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:28,900
His brain was shaken,
leave aside the teeth.

572
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,540
The poor broke 2
of his teeth over there.

573
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:32,835
The poor?

574
00:49:34,147 --> 00:49:35,184
Say that again!

575
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:41,399
Mr. Chaube, then came the sticks.
He was beaten so hard!

576
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:45,039
Sometimes on the waist!
Sometimes on the back!

577
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:47,575
- What happened?
- Nothing.

578
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:51,607
Just recalled some old wounds.

579
00:49:52,237 --> 00:49:55,631
They beat the poor without mercy.
I couldn't see it.

580
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:56,946
You are right.

581
00:49:57,217 --> 00:50:01,246
They shouldn't have beaten so much.
The wrestlers were too much.

582
00:50:01,326 --> 00:50:05,074
It was my mistake. I should have
told you to bring only 1 wrestler.

583
00:50:05,154 --> 00:50:08,840
Mr. Chaube,
what if that goon comes again?

584
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:11,752
Then he surely is
a champion lover of 1966.

585
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,594
He must be a descendant
of Majnu's or Farhad's family.

586
00:50:15,064 --> 00:50:19,890
He carries their blood.
Now it is no mistake of the boy.

587
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:22,720
The mistake is that of the girl then.

588
00:50:22,904 --> 00:50:26,239
Look her beauty.

589
00:50:26,794 --> 00:50:29,590
She is like a piece of moon.

590
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,571
Hey you, you're getting
late for office. Give it to me.

591
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:37,240
Here are sweets for you.
And your fees. Come on.

592
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:44,802
Mr. Chaube, I want to tell
you something about myself.

593
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:47,104
I'll come alone later.

594
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:56,666
This woman is firecrackers! Sir,
should I keep the formula 41 or...

595
00:50:56,746 --> 00:51:00,493
Keep it. Don't you
see how successful it is?

596
00:51:00,785 --> 00:51:05,505
It was the formula which
brought the girl here.

597
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,381
See if there are really
sweets in this box.

598
00:51:43,235 --> 00:51:44,235
Who are you?

599
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:56,147
Perhaps you are waiting
for someone in this lonely place.

600
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,803
- No, I'm waiting for no one.
- I see.

601
00:52:13,307 --> 00:52:15,038
What are you looking at?

602
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:18,658
- I've recognized you.
- What?

603
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Yes.

604
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,341
Shall I tell you? You are a poet.

605
00:52:26,011 --> 00:52:27,825
You were lost in
thoughts like a poet.

606
00:52:29,737 --> 00:52:32,465
No, I am not a poet.

607
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:35,238
Then you must be a poem.

608
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:42,884
Listen! Tell me your name.

609
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:54,432
- Greetings, sir.
- Have you been waiting for long?

610
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:58,898
- Waiting pays off.
- Come with me.

611
00:53:20,673 --> 00:53:24,936
The expenses are increasing
with the studies.

612
00:53:26,673 --> 00:53:28,575
Don't worry about the expenses.

613
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,992
Take it from me as and when you need.

614
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,963
- Is that enough?
- Yes, it is. Greetings.

615
00:53:56,589 --> 00:53:59,807
Sir! Sir, Mr. Rai has
had an attack once again!

616
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:11,210
Father! Don't worry, father.

617
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,452
This is an old ailment.
Everything will be fine.

618
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:16,759
- I'll call the doctor.
- No, Sapan, don't go anywhere.

619
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:20,444
I want to tell you something.
Tell you many things.

620
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:23,968
- First take the medicine.
- No, I've little time.

621
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:25,772
First listen to me.

622
00:54:25,853 --> 00:54:27,853
I'll listen to everything.
First eat this tablet.

623
00:54:36,392 --> 00:54:41,841
Sapan, you don't know there's
a big burden on my mind.

624
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:50,254
I want to take off all
that burden from my soul.

625
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:54,559
- All right, father. I'll call the doctor first.
- No!

626
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:08,320
Doctor? I am Sapan.
Father has had an attack again.

627
00:55:08,903 --> 00:55:10,114
Please, come fast.

628
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:15,983
How are you feeling now, dad?

629
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,779
- I'm fine now.
- I can see that on your face.

630
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:21,792
You fall ill because you
don't take medicines regularly.

631
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:24,796
Now I'll take care of that.

632
00:55:25,118 --> 00:55:27,213
Father, you were going
to say something to me.

633
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:29,890
Yes...

634
00:55:29,981 --> 00:55:33,043
you wanted to say something to
me during the previous attack, too.

635
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:35,635
Child, the thing is that...

636
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:45,238
Don't know what nonsense
I talk during the attack.

637
00:55:46,213 --> 00:55:47,551
Might have been something.

638
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:37,660
"These guys of today study nothing."

639
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:42,645
"But look at their fashion.
They fly without wings."

640
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:47,798
"Look at their hair or cheeks or gait."

641
00:56:47,941 --> 00:56:52,864
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

642
00:56:53,236 --> 00:56:57,745
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

643
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:02,967
"These guys of today study nothing."

644
00:57:03,428 --> 00:57:08,219
"But look at their fashion.
They fly without wings."

645
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:13,363
"Look at their hair or cheeks or gait."

646
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:18,350
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

647
00:57:18,828 --> 00:57:23,506
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

648
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:25,786
"These guys of today..."

649
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:53,253
"The locks hanging on their forehead."

650
00:57:54,155 --> 00:57:58,739
"Their slim waist is also strolling."

651
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:03,914
"The locks hanging on their forehead."

652
00:58:04,996 --> 00:58:09,242
"Their slim waist is also strolling."

653
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:14,739
"Look at their hair or cheeks or gait."

654
00:58:14,881 --> 00:58:20,049
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

655
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:24,848
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

656
00:58:25,024 --> 00:58:28,194
"These guys of today..."

657
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:54,226
"They rush forth when they see a girl."

658
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:59,733
"What they do when
they see a drape flying!"

659
00:59:00,602 --> 00:59:05,087
"They rush forth when they see a girl."

660
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:10,173
"What they do when
they see a drape flying!"

661
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:15,765
"Look at their hair or cheeks or gait."

662
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:20,843
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

663
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:25,819
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

664
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:31,147
"These guys of today study nothing."

665
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:36,290
"But look at their fashion.
They fly without wings."

666
00:59:36,555 --> 00:59:41,472
"Look at their hair or cheeks or gait."

667
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:46,663
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

668
00:59:46,932 --> 00:59:51,496
"Pigeon! Pigeon!"

669
00:59:51,649 --> 00:59:54,125
"These guys of today..."

670
01:00:00,855 --> 01:00:02,665
- Fail!
- Fail? What has failed?

671
01:00:02,792 --> 01:00:07,112
- The scheme.
- Which scheme?

672
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:12,863
The one you planned out.
Seema was mocking you.

673
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:15,120
I think you should forget her now.

674
01:00:15,716 --> 01:00:19,291
What are you saying, Deepak?
You don't know where I've reached.

675
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,760
- I just have to pull the strings.
- Are you so confident?

676
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:25,902
And as far as this pigeon
thing is concerned...

677
01:00:29,112 --> 01:00:30,932
There's going to be
a function at the club.

678
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,912
Seema will surely participate in it.

679
01:00:32,993 --> 01:00:36,127
We'll all take revenge on her.

680
01:00:36,419 --> 01:00:37,472
That's right.

681
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:44,135
Come, child.

682
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:48,588
- Mr. Rai has come.
- Greetings.

683
01:00:48,831 --> 01:00:51,280
God bless you. You have a long life!

684
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:53,472
We were talking about you.

685
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:55,493
- About me?
- Yes.

686
01:00:55,573 --> 01:00:59,286
- Not there, come and sit here.
- Yes, child. Go.

687
01:01:05,484 --> 01:01:09,125
Look, I've come to ask
your hand from them.

688
01:01:10,776 --> 01:01:11,579
What?

689
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,622
- Do you mind?
- Her luck has shined today, Mr. Rai.

690
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:19,790
I am lucky that I'm getting
a daughter in law like Seema.

691
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:23,113
- Child, sweeten his mouth.
- Give it to me.

692
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:25,765
Here, eat.

693
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:28,659
- Have it, child.
- We won't eat till you eat.

694
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,096
Eat it, child.

695
01:01:32,303 --> 01:01:33,303
She is very shy.

696
01:01:35,827 --> 01:01:37,676
Ok, Mr. Gupta, I'll take your leave.

697
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:40,061
I've got to find out the
auspicious moment for the wedding.

698
01:01:40,085 --> 01:01:42,972
Sure. We shouldn't
delay the good deeds.

699
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:48,268
- Touch his feet.
- God bless you. Greetings, Bhabhi.

700
01:02:01,124 --> 01:02:03,412
Lilavati, looks like we're having...

701
01:02:03,492 --> 01:02:06,404
all the festivals like
Holi Diwali, Ramnavmi together.

702
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:09,594
- Am I right?
- You are absolutely right today.

703
01:02:10,974 --> 01:02:12,593
What is all this going on, mother?

704
01:02:12,894 --> 01:02:15,298
You should have asked
me before talking to him.

705
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,928
Why ask you?
It is what your heart wants.

706
01:02:18,107 --> 01:02:19,808
You play together,
you go out together...

707
01:02:19,888 --> 01:02:22,654
It doesn't mean that
I also want to marry him.

708
01:02:22,856 --> 01:02:26,125
Talking nicely to someone
does not mean that I also love him.

709
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,126
So what? Everything
will be fine after marriage.

710
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,168
Where else will
you find such a house?

711
01:02:32,436 --> 01:02:35,817
Mom, don't look at the house,
look at those who live in the house.

712
01:02:36,107 --> 01:02:39,253
But what's wrong with Sapan?
He's a very good guy.

713
01:02:39,853 --> 01:02:42,427
Father, Sapan is
not what he seems to be.

714
01:02:42,838 --> 01:02:46,343
He's false like the dreams!
He's illusion, deceit, poison!

715
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:56,948
Father, you can marry me to anyone.
I'm ready.

716
01:02:58,478 --> 01:03:01,977
I agree to death.
But I don't agree to a life with him.

717
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:09,685
Professor, Seema is totally
under my control these days.

718
01:03:10,437 --> 01:03:14,722
She dances on my tunes.
Now tell me how to revenge her.

719
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:18,163
How did you know that
she dances to your tunes?

720
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:21,485
Whenever I call her,
she comes immediately.

721
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:28,692
That means the poor girl must
be coming early and waiting for you.

722
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:34,566
That does not happen.
It's usually me who reaches first.

723
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:40,419
- It should be like that.
- But, Mr. Chaube, why're you asking all this?

724
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:42,380
One should know...

725
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:45,303
the outer situation,
to understand the inner feelings.

726
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:49,807
Ok, tell me,
what is her plight without you?

727
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:53,118
- She spends sleepless nights.
- You must have heard that.

728
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:59,180
- No, I've seen that myself.
- That means you are also sleepless.

729
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:01,765
But, Mr. Chaube...

730
01:04:01,846 --> 01:04:05,690
I understand what's in the
letter by seeing the envelope.

731
01:04:06,037 --> 01:04:10,814
You are also in love.
The fire is burning on both sides.

732
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:13,106
The only difference is
that there's fire on that side...

733
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:16,164
and only a repressed
sparkle on this side.

734
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:19,301
- But this is wrong, Mr. Chaube. It is false.
- It is absolutely true.

735
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:22,975
All 3 signs show
that you are in love.

736
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:26,415
The first sign,
you reach at a place before her.

737
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:31,581
The second, your heart
jumps with joy when she arrives.

738
01:04:31,661 --> 01:04:35,951
And the third, you also
spend the night without sleeping.

739
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:38,637
That means love has attacked you.

740
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:44,695
O Love, you are great!
You kill the one whom you glance at.

741
01:04:44,775 --> 01:04:47,244
I am in love? What are you saying?

742
01:04:47,324 --> 01:04:53,074
There's no need to be tensed.
Go home and think over.

743
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:55,222
Come back tomorrow,
and tell me the truth.

744
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:58,509
Bye.

745
01:04:58,826 --> 01:04:59,826
Go.

746
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:08,039
Hail the guru! Where are your feet?
I want to touch your feet.

747
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:10,945
Forgive me, guru.
You've worked wonder!

748
01:05:11,025 --> 01:05:12,789
You've reached the
rocket on the moon.

749
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:17,507
- Please, accept this gift.
- What was the need for this?

750
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,996
- Greetings.
- Wait.

751
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,752
If you're not sure,
you can test formula no. 144.

752
01:05:25,065 --> 01:05:28,698
I've made Sapan fall in
love with Seema.

753
01:05:29,245 --> 01:05:32,589
Hail the guru!

754
01:05:32,753 --> 01:05:35,406
How much has he paid?

755
01:05:44,175 --> 01:05:47,259
- What is this, pal?
- So, you forgot so soon?

756
01:05:47,733 --> 01:05:50,610
Today is Seema's program on the
stage. We've got to create trouble.

757
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:53,498
- Today's her program?
- What else?

758
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:58,406
We'll be creating so much trouble
today that she'll be out of tune.

759
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:01,272
Yes, we should do
something like that.

760
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:03,328
We all will be watching you.

761
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:06,017
As soon as you raise your hand,
we'll start.

762
01:06:06,097 --> 01:06:09,315
Show us a sample. Come on. Show.

763
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,287
Ms. Seema, make it fast.

764
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:41,010
"These shadows of the
gaze touching my heart..."

765
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:51,136
"I hope they don't
become a pain eventually."

766
01:06:59,905 --> 01:07:07,905
"These shadows of the
gaze touching my heart..."

767
01:07:09,935 --> 01:07:17,935
"I hope they don't
become a pain eventually."

768
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:38,585
"That who is still unaware
in his arrogance..."

769
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:49,411
"That who is still unaware
in his arrogance..."

770
01:07:52,073 --> 01:08:00,073
"Has a special place in my heart."

771
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:07,714
"Sometimes he lights a lamp.

772
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:13,467
And sometimes he puts it off."

773
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:21,548
"I hope they don't
become a pain eventually."

774
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:50,617
"As the morning came,
I had only his thought in mind."

775
01:08:53,126 --> 01:09:01,126
"As the morning came,
I had only his thought in mind."

776
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:11,634
"I saw his beautiful
face in my mirror."

777
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:22,734
"Sometimes you get angry.
Sometimes you smile."

778
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:32,915
"I hope they don't
become a pain eventually."

779
01:09:55,986 --> 01:10:03,986
"These new desires are not dreams."

780
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:14,601
"These new desires are not dreams."

781
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:25,251
"Whether anyone believes it or not,
I feel him to be my own."

782
01:10:28,172 --> 01:10:36,172
"The one who is behaving like
a stranger, with his head down."

783
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:46,151
"I hope they don't
become a pain eventually."

784
01:10:54,579 --> 01:11:02,579
"These shadows of the
gaze touching my heart..."

785
01:11:04,316 --> 01:11:12,316
"I hope they don't
become a pain eventually."

786
01:11:30,117 --> 01:11:31,462
He's done for!

787
01:11:35,681 --> 01:11:39,215
She's come and gone.
The story is over.

788
01:11:39,825 --> 01:11:41,941
- Deepak, I...
- You don't need to say anything.

789
01:11:42,021 --> 01:11:46,213
You've reached that world,
from where no one can return.

790
01:12:03,023 --> 01:12:06,862
O the heights and the
depths of the mountains!

791
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:08,563
You must be remembering...

792
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:13,657
that Majnu died
for the disloyal Laila.

793
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:19,468
And Farhad held up the
mountain for the disloyal Shirin.

794
01:12:19,664 --> 01:12:24,992
Today this lover no.
3, Pyarelal, that is me...

795
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:31,402
is going to jump from
this mountain and kill himself.

796
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:36,483
O waves of winds,
convey my regards to Usha.

797
01:12:36,587 --> 01:12:41,143
And tell her that her
lover is going far away.

798
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:44,233
And will not return from there.

799
01:12:44,313 --> 01:12:46,696
And tell her that one feels sorry
for those who have withered away...

800
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,137
without getting
a chance to blossom.

801
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:56,647
- To hell with love! - Pyare!
- It's no use calling me now.

802
01:12:56,964 --> 01:13:01,749
- O rocks, spread your arms. I'm coming.
- What are you doing?

803
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:03,637
- Leave me.
- I won't leave you.

804
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:06,031
I've already stepped towards death.

805
01:13:06,112 --> 01:13:08,304
- I can't come back.
- I won't let you die.

806
01:13:08,424 --> 01:13:10,702
But I can't live without you.

807
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:17,074
- But you can live with me, can't you?
- Really? Say that again.

808
01:13:18,891 --> 01:13:23,097
- Live with me, Pyare.
- Really? - Yes.

809
01:13:23,177 --> 01:13:27,794
I had already told you that.
But I loved irritating you.

810
01:13:27,874 --> 01:13:30,212
Now you'll enjoy more.

811
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:32,420
Let's get out of here, darling.

812
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:37,396
I don't want to slip off, because
I don't want to die now. Come.

813
01:13:55,085 --> 01:13:57,085
I guessed it right,

814
01:13:58,093 --> 01:13:59,570
that I'll find you here.

815
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,856
- And I guessed it wrong.
- You guessed what?

816
01:14:04,274 --> 01:14:07,273
I thought you will
not come here again.

817
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,773
So you were thinking about me?

818
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:10,854
Yes.

819
01:14:11,512 --> 01:14:12,512
No!

820
01:14:13,645 --> 01:14:14,645
Listen!

821
01:14:17,984 --> 01:14:19,211
Are you going?

822
01:14:19,808 --> 01:14:20,808
Yes.

823
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,511
Perhaps you didn't
like me coming here.

824
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:26,357
You stay here. I'll go.

825
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:31,074
Listen!

826
01:14:35,943 --> 01:14:40,751
- Yes? - Why are you going?
- Because you are going.

827
01:14:42,331 --> 01:14:45,912
- You talk nice.
- Shall we sit over there then? - Why?

828
01:14:46,299 --> 01:14:48,295
I'll keep talking,
and you keep listening.

829
01:14:50,796 --> 01:14:54,334
No, it's too late. I'll go now.

830
01:14:54,582 --> 01:14:56,012
- Where?
- To my home.

831
01:14:57,208 --> 01:15:01,185
- Where is your home?
- It's nearby.

832
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:03,469
So let me drop you.

833
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:05,779
No, it's very far!

834
01:15:07,706 --> 01:15:10,134
It's near, and far, too!

835
01:15:18,133 --> 01:15:19,741
Tell me your name.

836
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:29,406
Only the famous have names.
I am anonymous.

837
01:15:39,782 --> 01:15:40,782
Seema!

838
01:15:42,521 --> 01:15:46,888
The whole world is with me now
that I've come to you.

839
01:15:48,814 --> 01:15:51,115
I'm feeling for the 1st time that...

840
01:15:51,913 --> 01:15:54,333
there's so much coolness
in this life of love.

841
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:58,442
It's so peaceful.

842
01:16:01,392 --> 01:16:02,392
Seema,

843
01:16:05,172 --> 01:16:09,399
I want to hear from your mouth
what I see in your eyes.

844
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:14,517
- Do you really want to hear it?
- Yes. - Then listen.

845
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:19,754
I never loved you!
I answered your lie with a lie.

846
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:22,945
I've revenged you.

847
01:16:23,066 --> 01:16:26,322
What kind of revenge?

848
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,192
You wanted to fool me?

849
01:16:29,808 --> 01:16:33,892
That tape recorder,
those dialogues, that acting.

850
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:36,216
What else was that except falsehood?

851
01:16:36,296 --> 01:16:38,150
That falsehood has become
the truth today, Seema.

852
01:16:38,174 --> 01:16:40,884
Those false injuries have
actually become the pain of my heart.

853
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,722
That joke has become
the emotion of my heart.

854
01:16:45,453 --> 01:16:47,758
This is what I wanted.

855
01:16:48,183 --> 01:16:50,185
I was waiting for this day.

856
01:16:50,737 --> 01:16:53,673
So that I bring you till
here and then withdraw myself.

857
01:16:54,113 --> 01:16:55,827
So that you wander all your life.

858
01:16:56,315 --> 01:16:59,089
So that your life becomes
a punishment without me.

859
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:04,828
I've deceived you just the way
you wanted to deceive me. Got it?

860
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:12,229
Seema!

861
01:17:14,705 --> 01:17:15,705
Seema...

862
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:24,439
Seema...

863
01:17:28,828 --> 01:17:29,828
Seema...

864
01:17:37,201 --> 01:17:38,201
Stop...

865
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:19,387
Sapan! Sapan!

866
01:18:19,677 --> 01:18:20,888
Sapan!

867
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:27,209
Sapan...

868
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:42,657
Let's go.

869
01:19:26,494 --> 01:19:28,472
I can walk no more.

870
01:19:29,437 --> 01:19:31,163
Then we'll have to
spend the night here.

871
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:33,166
Here?

872
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,510
It's no use wandering in the jungle.

873
01:19:37,145 --> 01:19:39,030
Nothing's visible in this darkness.

874
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:43,739
Come on.

875
01:21:56,187 --> 01:21:59,278
The night has gone by.
It's already morning.

876
01:22:00,008 --> 01:22:01,470
But Seema hasn't come yet.

877
01:22:01,627 --> 01:22:04,871
Don't know what to do.
There's no news of her from anywhere.

878
01:22:06,586 --> 01:22:07,586
Seema!

879
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,138
Where were you all night?
Where are you coming from?

880
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:17,497
- Nowhere. My motor broke down.
- Why didn't you inform us?

881
01:22:17,663 --> 01:22:20,596
- How could I? I was far from the city...
- Why did you go so far?

882
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:23,996
- Just like that.
- Who was with you?

883
01:22:25,443 --> 01:22:29,172
Why don't you tell us?
Is this how a decent girl behaves?

884
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:33,308
You're taking too much liberty.
This is the result of your leniency.

885
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:37,852
- There's only one solution to this. Marriage!
- Marriage?

886
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:40,931
- I'll fix everything today.
- Father, listen to me.

887
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:43,817
I've listened enough.
I'm regretting having listened to you.

888
01:22:43,898 --> 01:22:45,889
Now only my wish
will work in this house.

889
01:22:57,049 --> 01:22:59,830
Look at your face! Will you go
in front of the guy with such a face?

890
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,727
- I won't go.
- How wouldn't you go?

891
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:04,107
You take marriage as a joke?
You yourself told that day...

892
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:06,877
- It was a different matter then.
- It's still the same matter.

893
01:23:07,131 --> 01:23:08,311
We won't listen to you.

894
01:23:08,414 --> 01:23:10,392
- We might lose this guy, too.
- Let it be.

895
01:23:12,546 --> 01:23:14,287
Auntie, they've come.

896
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:16,790
- Get up.
- I won't go.

897
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,462
How wouldn't you go?

898
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:48,512
Child, pull the sari
over your head. Come.

899
01:24:18,076 --> 01:24:21,505
"Now is the time to live."

900
01:24:21,585 --> 01:24:29,585
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."

901
01:24:30,704 --> 01:24:34,220
"Now is the time to live."

902
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:42,300
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."

903
01:24:43,394 --> 01:24:47,006
"Now is the time to live."

904
01:25:07,952 --> 01:25:13,941
"The sorrow that was
on my face is gone now."

905
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:20,030
"The sorrow that was
on my face is gone now."

906
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:26,627
"With your hair every clamp is untied."

907
01:25:27,073 --> 01:25:33,320
"It's not my body in your arms.
It's spring strolling in the path."

908
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:40,670
"It's not my body in your arms.
It's spring strolling in the path."

909
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:44,193
"Now is the time to live."

910
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:52,273
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."

911
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:57,349
"Now is the time to live."

912
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:26,960
"You are always with my love."

913
01:26:27,194 --> 01:26:33,302
"You are always with my love."

914
01:26:33,723 --> 01:26:39,382
"Just the way your
heart is on my face."

915
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:42,988
"I've always being
intoxicated by your eyes."

916
01:26:43,068 --> 01:26:46,238
"I fell for you. I will live for you."

917
01:26:46,318 --> 01:26:49,256
"I've always being
intoxicated by your eyes."

918
01:26:49,336 --> 01:26:53,471
"I fell for you. I will live for you."

919
01:26:53,551 --> 01:26:57,029
"Now is the time to live."

920
01:26:57,109 --> 01:27:05,109
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."

921
01:27:06,363 --> 01:27:10,121
"Now is the time to live."

922
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:37,002
"Why should a third
person come in between us?"

923
01:27:37,436 --> 01:27:42,947
"Why should a third
person come in between us?"

924
01:27:43,113 --> 01:27:49,675
"Tell the sun to set for God's sake."

925
01:27:50,156 --> 01:27:53,258
"This day has come after many prayers."

926
01:27:53,338 --> 01:27:56,545
"I haven't seen you till
my heart's content yet."

927
01:27:56,626 --> 01:27:59,447
"This day has come after many prayers."

928
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:03,728
"I haven't seen you till
my heart's content yet."

929
01:28:03,829 --> 01:28:08,946
"Now is the time to live."

930
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:17,035
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."

931
01:28:18,323 --> 01:28:21,786
"Now is the time to live."

932
01:28:21,866 --> 01:28:29,866
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."

933
01:28:31,087 --> 01:28:35,452
"Now is the time to live."

934
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:01,780
Sir, where had you been?
Mr. Rai has again had an attack.

935
01:29:12,983 --> 01:29:19,104
- Father, how do you feel now?
- Much better.

936
01:29:20,289 --> 01:29:24,029
Child, I want to...

937
01:29:26,053 --> 01:29:27,053
nurse!

938
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:30,946
- Can you go out for a while?
- Yes.

939
01:29:34,653 --> 01:29:38,466
Sapan, shut the door from inside.

940
01:29:38,657 --> 01:29:39,657
Why, father?

941
01:29:40,257 --> 01:29:41,595
Because I'm telling you.

942
01:29:54,826 --> 01:29:56,463
Child, you must
be remembering that...

943
01:29:56,543 --> 01:29:59,336
I have been wanting to
tell you something many a times.

944
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:02,460
Father, don't talk. You need to rest.

945
01:30:04,073 --> 01:30:08,454
Now I can rest only if
I tell you what's in my heart.

946
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:13,735
I don't want to tell
you the story of my crime.

947
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:19,898
I just want to tell you
that I also have a daughter.

948
01:30:21,559 --> 01:30:23,091
Your daughter?

949
01:30:23,353 --> 01:30:25,801
Yes, your sister.

950
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:28,193
Where is that girl?

951
01:30:29,691 --> 01:30:34,895
In the boarding house of St. George school.
She studies there.

952
01:30:37,107 --> 01:30:42,693
She was kept aloof from
all to save her from evil.

953
01:30:44,211 --> 01:30:48,735
I am sure good education
will take her to goodness.

954
01:30:51,485 --> 01:30:59,485
The man whom you used to
see here often, is Puran Bahadur.

955
01:31:01,481 --> 01:31:05,774
He is taking care of Lajwanti.

956
01:31:06,774 --> 01:31:08,675
Father, why didn't you tell me before?

957
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:11,297
I wouldn't have told you today either.

958
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:16,935
But... but I feel that
I'm close to death now.

959
01:31:18,712 --> 01:31:24,460
Child, I wanted to
keep Lajwanti here with me.

960
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,728
And bring up both
of you the same way.

961
01:31:29,668 --> 01:31:31,080
But I couldn't do it.

962
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:33,970
Child,

963
01:31:34,779 --> 01:31:38,045
I'm leaving my
burden on your shoulders now.

964
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:43,431
From today you are her father,
brother, and everything.

965
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:49,963
Father, your wish is mine.

966
01:31:50,532 --> 01:31:52,943
All your dreams will be
fulfilled while you are alive.

967
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:59,063
- Don't worry. Lajwanti is my sis.
- Yes, she is your sis.

968
01:32:00,257 --> 01:32:05,150
But don't let anyone know about this.
Not even after my death.

969
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,004
Or else the prestige
of our family will be ruined.

970
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:16,552
Sapan, promise me that you'll
not tell this to anyone. Promise me.

971
01:32:16,771 --> 01:32:19,228
Calm down, father. I promise you.

972
01:32:21,001 --> 01:32:26,404
Are you promising with all
your heart or just to convince me?

973
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,336
Believe me, father.
The promise is my duty.

974
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:34,735
No matter how many
troubles come up...

975
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:39,225
I won't let the world
know that Lajwanti is my sis.

976
01:32:40,716 --> 01:32:44,159
I expected just that from you, child.

977
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:46,551
Father!

978
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:48,495
Father!

979
01:32:48,839 --> 01:32:49,839
Nurse!

980
01:33:05,512 --> 01:33:07,248
Hello? Doctor!

981
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,489
No girl by the name of Lajwanti
studies here in class 12.

982
01:33:29,287 --> 01:33:30,839
She lives in your hostel.

983
01:33:40,945 --> 01:33:42,752
Sorry. She neither
lives in the hostel.

984
01:33:43,022 --> 01:33:45,695
Looks like someone has
given you the wrong information.

985
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:52,865
I think so, too.

986
01:33:55,044 --> 01:33:55,872
Greetings.

987
01:33:55,967 --> 01:33:57,436
Here, take the Paan.

988
01:34:00,849 --> 01:34:03,801
Bro, is there a man named
Puran in this locality?

989
01:34:04,066 --> 01:34:05,627
Who doesn't know him, mister?

990
01:34:05,802 --> 01:34:07,282
Since the day the
bud has blossomed...

991
01:34:07,327 --> 01:34:08,913
its scent has
spread in all the city.

992
01:34:09,116 --> 01:34:12,942
- Where is his house?
- The one with the steps and beaded door.

993
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,202
I'll pile her in gold.

994
01:34:15,874 --> 01:34:19,717
Who will bargain with you?
You have a heart of gold.

995
01:34:20,105 --> 01:34:22,800
Just see how many have
you lined up in the market!

996
01:34:23,479 --> 01:34:26,866
She'll be yours in a few days.

997
01:34:27,126 --> 01:34:31,206
Bro, when will that day come?

998
01:34:32,402 --> 01:34:34,281
What are you saying, mister?

999
01:34:37,607 --> 01:34:43,739
You? And that, too, here? Come in.

1000
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:49,737
God's grace that he has come
to my house. Come, feel at home.

1001
01:34:52,898 --> 01:34:55,351
Puran, where is Lajwanti?

1002
01:34:55,682 --> 01:34:59,942
She studies in the school.
She stays at the hostel.

1003
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:02,636
She neither studies in
school nor lives at the boarding.

1004
01:35:03,092 --> 01:35:05,852
- Tell me where she is.
- Mr. Sapan!

1005
01:35:06,145 --> 01:35:08,972
Puran, you cheated
my father all his life.

1006
01:35:09,548 --> 01:35:11,887
You gave him false consolations
and took money from him.

1007
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:13,731
You will have to tell where she is.

1008
01:35:14,594 --> 01:35:17,091
Why should I tell you?
What do you have to do with that?

1009
01:35:17,326 --> 01:35:20,910
I have a reason to ask.
Father has told me everything.

1010
01:35:22,582 --> 01:35:25,616
- She was related to Mr. Rai.
- She is also related to me.

1011
01:35:25,974 --> 01:35:27,936
I am her bro, and she is my sis.

1012
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:39,121
Brother! Bro, save me.
Take me out of this market.

1013
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:45,059
Or these demons will rob your sis.
Save me, bro.

1014
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,184
Don't worry. You'll come with me.

1015
01:35:50,673 --> 01:35:53,927
- Lajwanti cannot go from here.
- No power can stop me.

1016
01:35:54,669 --> 01:35:55,919
It can, mister.

1017
01:35:57,335 --> 01:35:58,335
Uncle!

1018
01:35:58,574 --> 01:36:01,407
It's a little baby,
only 6 inches long.

1019
01:36:01,883 --> 01:36:03,957
But can take the life of big ones.

1020
01:36:05,798 --> 01:36:08,518
I might have mercy on you,
but this won't.

1021
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:11,567
This cruel one does
not have mercy for anyone.

1022
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:14,959
It would be better
if you go away quietly.

1023
01:36:32,373 --> 01:36:33,373
Puran!

1024
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:36,869
Don't you know who he is?

1025
01:36:36,949 --> 01:36:39,063
You never ask anyone
and just jump into a quarrel.

1026
01:36:39,214 --> 01:36:41,401
- Move aside from there.
- Sister! - Come on!

1027
01:36:47,801 --> 01:36:52,114
- Child, I am Lajwanti's mother, Janaki.
- You all deceived father.

1028
01:36:52,407 --> 01:36:54,800
Child, this is a game of destiny.

1029
01:36:55,423 --> 01:36:57,071
There can be no bigger
joy for me than...

1030
01:36:57,151 --> 01:36:59,038
that Lajwanti is
going back to her own home.

1031
01:36:59,556 --> 01:37:01,164
But only God can help us now.

1032
01:37:02,247 --> 01:37:04,463
Our house was run by the money...

1033
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:06,715
that Mr. Rai used to send for Lajo.

1034
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:13,637
Here. And take as much
amount as needed in future.

1035
01:37:14,007 --> 01:37:16,197
Forgive me for my behavior, sir.

1036
01:37:16,278 --> 01:37:20,130
You are just as good hearted
as your father. I remember him now.

1037
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,084
May you live long, child!

1038
01:37:30,132 --> 01:37:31,201
Come, Lajwanti.

1039
01:37:41,382 --> 01:37:43,306
What will happen
of my ailment now, dear?

1040
01:37:43,839 --> 01:37:47,101
Don't worry, Lalaji.
Your ailment will be cured.

1041
01:37:50,025 --> 01:37:52,166
- He is our father.
- Father!

1042
01:37:54,481 --> 01:37:57,273
The name of our good father
will always remain in people's heart.

1043
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:01,176
He earned lakhs of rupees
in his life and also spent lakhs.

1044
01:38:01,754 --> 01:38:05,060
No one gained as much fame as him.

1045
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:10,179
He was as holy as a temple.
People swore on him.

1046
01:38:10,983 --> 01:38:12,569
Was my father so prestigious?

1047
01:38:13,786 --> 01:38:15,638
Am I the daughter
of such a great family?

1048
01:38:18,323 --> 01:38:20,286
But, Lajwanti,
the world does not know that.

1049
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:24,185
Everyone thinks that Mr. Rai
did not have any daughter.

1050
01:38:24,684 --> 01:38:27,328
If people see you suddenly,
they might suspect.

1051
01:38:28,462 --> 01:38:30,524
You don't want people
to laugh at father, do you?

1052
01:38:30,605 --> 01:38:32,867
No, bro, I don't want that.

1053
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:36,459
That's why I think I'll keep
you in another house for a few days.

1054
01:38:37,692 --> 01:38:38,776
Another house?

1055
01:38:38,856 --> 01:38:41,817
That will be my real house.
I'll come there everyday.

1056
01:38:42,967 --> 01:38:45,612
- I don't mind then.
- There's one more thing.

1057
01:38:46,369 --> 01:38:49,075
People shouldn't know that
you are my sis.

1058
01:38:50,122 --> 01:38:51,122
Promise me.

1059
01:38:53,534 --> 01:38:55,517
- I promise you.
- Bravo!

1060
01:38:55,876 --> 01:38:58,424
Let some time pass.
Everything will be fine.

1061
01:38:59,355 --> 01:39:01,654
I hope I haven't hurt you.

1062
01:39:01,992 --> 01:39:03,404
What are you saying?

1063
01:39:04,367 --> 01:39:09,042
You've changed my fate today.
I've come a long way.

1064
01:39:10,455 --> 01:39:12,653
I'm happy in whichever
way you keep me.

1065
01:39:13,142 --> 01:39:15,970
Stay here tonight.
I'll arrange everything tomorrow.

1066
01:39:48,865 --> 01:39:55,559
So it's you?
Listen! Tell me your name.

1067
01:39:58,026 --> 01:40:06,026
"You cannot tell your
name even when asked."

1068
01:40:07,028 --> 01:40:15,028
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1069
01:40:15,984 --> 01:40:23,984
"She's scared of me,
but can't go far from me."

1070
01:40:24,998 --> 01:40:32,998
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1071
01:40:56,003 --> 01:41:03,938
"Your style is colorful and smart."

1072
01:41:04,908 --> 01:41:12,908
"Your style is colorful and smart."

1073
01:41:13,582 --> 01:41:21,582
"Yet you're childish.
Look at the simplicity."

1074
01:41:22,563 --> 01:41:30,563
"You've stolen my heart,
but you can't hide that."

1075
01:41:31,898 --> 01:41:39,898
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1076
01:41:40,559 --> 01:41:48,559
"You cannot tell your
name even when asked."

1077
01:41:49,454 --> 01:41:57,269
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1078
01:42:17,972 --> 01:42:25,972
"Why not turn away my eyes?
I am burdened with agony."

1079
01:42:26,933 --> 01:42:34,917
"Why not turn away my eyes?
I am burdened with agony."

1080
01:42:35,799 --> 01:42:43,492
"How would I leave
her hand after holding?"

1081
01:42:44,589 --> 01:42:52,589
"She is so delicate she
can't even free her drape."

1082
01:42:54,099 --> 01:43:01,621
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1083
01:43:02,832 --> 01:43:10,832
"You cannot tell your
name even when asked."

1084
01:43:11,736 --> 01:43:19,736
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1085
01:43:42,495 --> 01:43:50,495
"This is my prayer that my
dear remain in this mood forever."

1086
01:43:51,382 --> 01:43:59,294
"This is my prayer that my
dear remain in this mood forever."

1087
01:44:00,169 --> 01:44:08,169
"May she be in need of my love!"

1088
01:44:08,918 --> 01:44:16,918
"She can't even comb her hair herself."

1089
01:44:18,311 --> 01:44:26,066
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1090
01:44:27,005 --> 01:44:35,005
"You cannot tell your
name even when asked."

1091
01:44:35,827 --> 01:44:43,515
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1092
01:44:44,387 --> 01:44:52,387
"She's scared of me,
but can't go far from me."

1093
01:44:53,239 --> 01:45:00,645
"O Lord, this delicacy!"

1094
01:45:02,617 --> 01:45:06,208
"You think I don't understand
anything. I am foolish."

1095
01:45:06,599 --> 01:45:11,309
What else? You are so naive.
You don't even know your name.

1096
01:45:11,897 --> 01:45:14,408
I know it, but I won't tell you.

1097
01:45:18,286 --> 01:45:19,683
You will have to tell me today.

1098
01:45:22,968 --> 01:45:27,044
Ok, tell me, which is the
prettiest jewelry of a woman?

1099
01:45:28,092 --> 01:45:33,145
Prettiest jewelry of a woman?
Laj (Shyness).

1100
01:45:34,323 --> 01:45:37,856
That's my name. Lajwanti.

1101
01:45:38,491 --> 01:45:42,135
Lajwanti! Such a beautiful name!

1102
01:45:42,357 --> 01:45:44,790
- Regards.
- May you be safe!

1103
01:45:52,296 --> 01:45:53,363
Hello, Sapan.

1104
01:45:54,808 --> 01:45:55,620
Hello.

1105
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:59,136
- Sit down.
- Tell me, where are you these days?

1106
01:45:59,448 --> 01:46:03,762
I don't see you either in
house or club. What's the matter?

1107
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:05,486
I was a bit busy.

1108
01:46:06,561 --> 01:46:10,704
Not free even for a minute?
What's keeping you so busy?

1109
01:46:11,927 --> 01:46:15,067
Till father was alive,
I was carefree.

1110
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,114
After his death all the
responsibilities have come on me.

1111
01:46:18,706 --> 01:46:20,293
I don't know what to do.

1112
01:46:21,285 --> 01:46:23,606
I'm as much tensed now
as I was carefree some days back.

1113
01:46:24,997 --> 01:46:26,906
That can be seen on your face.

1114
01:46:30,242 --> 01:46:33,436
I know that you've
become a very busy person.

1115
01:46:34,203 --> 01:46:35,819
You have to attend the office.

1116
01:46:36,233 --> 01:46:38,638
But that doesn't mean that
you should stop meeting me.

1117
01:46:39,163 --> 01:46:40,636
It's not what you think, Seema.

1118
01:46:40,816 --> 01:46:43,469
You know how much I am
sad when I don't meet you.

1119
01:46:44,837 --> 01:46:49,074
I was only yours earlier.
But now I am also others'.

1120
01:46:50,803 --> 01:46:55,147
There are big troubles, big problems.

1121
01:46:57,154 --> 01:47:00,755
Sapan, give me some of your problems.

1122
01:47:02,378 --> 01:47:03,979
What am I here for after all?

1123
01:47:05,272 --> 01:47:08,090
It's only your thought
that saves me in this storm.

1124
01:47:09,518 --> 01:47:12,689
Whether the world is with me or not,
but you will support me.

1125
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:13,960
Sir!

1126
01:47:14,896 --> 01:47:16,207
- Greetings, madam.
- Greetings.

1127
01:47:16,288 --> 01:47:17,948
Sir, the accounts of last
six months are lying here.

1128
01:47:17,972 --> 01:47:21,340
- Have a look at that.
- Munimji, this is not a time to check accounts.

1129
01:47:21,705 --> 01:47:24,125
- Evening time is that for roaming around.
- I also say that.

1130
01:47:24,206 --> 01:47:27,885
And look, whatever needs
to be checked, do it before 4:00.

1131
01:47:27,966 --> 01:47:30,362
Nothing after 4:00.
That's what I say, too.

1132
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:33,003
Tejasingh!

1133
01:47:33,503 --> 01:47:35,079
Tejasingh, bring sir's coat.

1134
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,806
Coat? Where are we going?

1135
01:47:37,171 --> 01:47:39,997
To the club.
And you have to play a game with me.

1136
01:47:40,444 --> 01:47:41,504
Seema...

1137
01:47:47,092 --> 01:47:48,092
Regards.

1138
01:47:54,669 --> 01:47:56,029
May God keep you safe!

1139
01:48:25,144 --> 01:48:27,968
- Mr. Professor!
- I tell you he's not here. Go back.

1140
01:48:28,075 --> 01:48:29,075
No.

1141
01:48:31,779 --> 01:48:33,729
I'll go and check. You sit here.

1142
01:48:35,069 --> 01:48:36,069
Professor!

1143
01:49:00,996 --> 01:49:03,569
- Greetings, professor.
- God bless you.

1144
01:49:03,886 --> 01:49:06,610
- Have you been waiting for long?
- No, we came just now.

1145
01:49:07,033 --> 01:49:08,524
What do you mean by 'we'?

1146
01:49:09,378 --> 01:49:13,292
I've brought my Pyarelal
along to have your blessings.

1147
01:49:14,139 --> 01:49:17,698
I see. But where is that character?

1148
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:21,977
- He's gone in to call you.
- He's not inside. - No?

1149
01:49:22,835 --> 01:49:24,940
He must be in.
I'll just go and call him.

1150
01:49:32,592 --> 01:49:33,592
Pyarelal!

1151
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:48,513
- Hey, how did you come here?
- From there. Professor is not in.

1152
01:49:49,206 --> 01:49:51,475
But he was here just now.
Where has he gone?

1153
01:49:51,624 --> 01:49:54,494
I say he is not here at all.
And you say he was here?

1154
01:49:54,774 --> 01:49:57,781
Strange! You see him, and I don't?

1155
01:49:58,176 --> 01:50:01,048
I think there's some magic going on.
Let's get out of here.

1156
01:50:01,191 --> 01:50:04,513
I won't go till I get his blessings.

1157
01:50:05,097 --> 01:50:08,565
I tell you, we're not going
to get guru's blessings together.

1158
01:50:08,828 --> 01:50:12,425
Let's do this.
I'll go in and get his blessings.

1159
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:15,198
And when he comes out,
you take his blessings.

1160
01:50:40,277 --> 01:50:41,706
Where did the beard fall?

1161
01:50:43,107 --> 01:50:44,583
What do I do now?

1162
01:50:53,481 --> 01:50:56,535
I held guru's feet as I went in.

1163
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:59,372
He was in a hurry,
and yet he blessed me.

1164
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:00,909
He's called you tomorrow.

1165
01:51:01,019 --> 01:51:04,579
He told me that he cannot
bless 2 people together.

1166
01:51:04,701 --> 01:51:07,175
He said that and went
out of the back door.

1167
01:51:07,552 --> 01:51:10,042
Your guru is really great!

1168
01:51:10,262 --> 01:51:14,722
He has such a good personality
with the beard and moustache.

1169
01:51:14,874 --> 01:51:18,776
I have also known
today how great he is!

1170
01:51:18,962 --> 01:51:24,102
How he looks without the
beard and how he looks with it!

1171
01:51:24,987 --> 01:51:30,784
Usha, I had thought that
everything is fair in love and war.

1172
01:51:30,908 --> 01:51:36,267
But my idea was wrong.
Truly speaking, I did all this for you.

1173
01:51:36,553 --> 01:51:41,628
For me? You're lying. You've cheated
not only me but all the world.

1174
01:51:41,839 --> 01:51:45,143
What doesn't a person
do for his living?

1175
01:51:45,648 --> 01:51:48,878
Does he also steal and rob?
Then you do that, too.

1176
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:51,917
Darling, I'm telling the truth.

1177
01:51:52,073 --> 01:51:56,636
Consider B.N.R.
Chaube to be dead from today.

1178
01:51:56,824 --> 01:51:59,042
And Pyarelal has come back to life.

1179
01:51:59,427 --> 01:52:01,591
Forgive me once, darling.

1180
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,550
I'm telling the truth. I'll
prove to be a very loyal husband.

1181
01:52:05,799 --> 01:52:07,924
I mean, a very honest husband.

1182
01:52:13,064 --> 01:52:15,475
Why are you crying? Has anyone died?

1183
01:52:16,009 --> 01:52:18,972
B.N.R. Chaube!
What will happen to me now?

1184
01:52:19,206 --> 01:52:21,618
- I'm orphaned.
- Why are you scared?

1185
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:23,044
Hold this beard.

1186
01:52:23,195 --> 01:52:26,262
The moustache is in the room.
And the chair is vacant.

1187
01:52:26,535 --> 01:52:29,951
There are many formulas inside.
Go. Come on.

1188
01:53:01,395 --> 01:53:04,927
"The spring has come wearing a drape."

1189
01:53:05,079 --> 01:53:09,390
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1190
01:53:11,088 --> 01:53:14,394
"The spring has come wearing a drape."

1191
01:53:14,475 --> 01:53:17,882
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1192
01:53:18,366 --> 01:53:21,728
"When I held her finger painted with
Mehendi, a sword pricked my heart."

1193
01:53:21,809 --> 01:53:25,712
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1194
01:53:25,792 --> 01:53:28,835
"The spring has come wearing a drape."

1195
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:32,864
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1196
01:53:53,264 --> 01:54:01,264
"You see the patches of
my heart on her delicate body."

1197
01:54:04,358 --> 01:54:10,985
"When I told that to her with love,
she said I was lying."

1198
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:14,713
"She was agreeing,
but I thought she is refusing me."

1199
01:54:14,794 --> 01:54:18,713
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1200
01:54:20,454 --> 01:54:23,627
"The spring has come wearing a drape."

1201
01:54:23,773 --> 01:54:27,669
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1202
01:54:49,427 --> 01:54:57,427
"My eyes started weeping
when she put kohl in her eyes."

1203
01:55:00,718 --> 01:55:07,238
"When she ate Paan,
I spitted out blood here."

1204
01:55:07,714 --> 01:55:11,041
"I have a heart disease now.
I neither die nor live."

1205
01:55:11,122 --> 01:55:14,829
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1206
01:55:16,825 --> 01:55:19,975
"The spring has come wearing a drape."

1207
01:55:20,154 --> 01:55:24,008
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1208
01:55:44,207 --> 01:55:52,207
"She looked at me with love.
That's what I need at the moment."

1209
01:55:55,141 --> 01:56:01,551
"If she loves, that's good. If
she refuses me, that's my bad luck."

1210
01:56:01,998 --> 01:56:05,383
"She can do what she likes."

1211
01:56:05,464 --> 01:56:09,412
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1212
01:56:11,149 --> 01:56:14,204
"The spring has come wearing a drape."

1213
01:56:14,345 --> 01:56:18,115
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1214
01:56:18,226 --> 01:56:21,525
"When I held her finger painted with
Mehendi, a sword pricked my heart."

1215
01:56:21,606 --> 01:56:25,450
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1216
01:56:25,531 --> 01:56:30,367
"The spring has come wearing a drape."

1217
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:34,414
"Pal, look at this beautiful girl."

1218
01:56:41,815 --> 01:56:42,815
Lilawati!

1219
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,203
What is it?

1220
01:56:44,284 --> 01:56:46,088
Do you know what Sapan did?

1221
01:56:47,183 --> 01:56:49,092
- What did he do?
- He's got a girl from somewhere!

1222
01:56:49,116 --> 01:56:52,088
- What? Who told you?
- Everyone's talking about it.

1223
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:53,494
I've heard that...

1224
01:56:53,574 --> 01:56:55,634
he has given her a different
house and meets her secretly.

1225
01:56:55,658 --> 01:56:59,669
- Who's that girl?
- I don't know. But I'll find out everything.

1226
01:57:00,387 --> 01:57:05,430
It is a question of Seema's life.
Seema, did you hear anything?

1227
01:57:08,392 --> 01:57:09,715
I've heard everything.

1228
01:57:12,246 --> 01:57:17,891
Father, this is false.
These are just rumors.

1229
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:20,593
There can be no smoke without fire.

1230
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:24,636
- There has to be some truth in that.
- But, I... I don't believe it.

1231
01:57:28,499 --> 01:57:30,701
I know Sapan very well.

1232
01:57:31,529 --> 01:57:33,589
There's no one in his heart except me.

1233
01:57:39,416 --> 01:57:40,516
Come, madam.

1234
01:57:41,944 --> 01:57:44,326
- Is Sapan home?
- No. Sit down.

1235
01:57:45,437 --> 01:57:49,049
- When will he be back?
- God knows. He comes late these days.

1236
01:57:50,474 --> 01:57:53,849
- Where does he go then?
- Lord! He comes at your place.

1237
01:57:54,905 --> 01:57:58,808
- No.
- Really? Then where does he go?

1238
01:58:00,553 --> 01:58:01,741
He'll come for dinner, won't he?

1239
01:58:01,765 --> 01:58:03,498
He eats sometimes, and sometimes not.

1240
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:05,834
And he remains lost
in thoughts these days.

1241
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:09,102
- Since when does this happen?
- Since his father died.

1242
01:58:10,129 --> 01:58:11,898
There's too much
workload in the office.

1243
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:16,034
- And has also brought along a girl.
- Girl?

1244
01:58:16,274 --> 01:58:18,090
Yes, she stayed here all night.

1245
01:58:19,346 --> 01:58:22,060
Stayed here all night?
Who's this girl?

1246
01:58:22,249 --> 01:58:24,710
I don't know. I didn't see her again.

1247
01:58:25,347 --> 01:58:27,973
Oh! I forgot.
Will you have tea or coffee?

1248
01:58:28,053 --> 01:58:29,209
No need for that.

1249
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:32,959
No, sir will be angry with me. Sit.

1250
01:58:36,653 --> 01:58:39,827
And the matter grew bigger.
We kept fooling each other.

1251
01:58:40,831 --> 01:58:42,845
And in this jest we fell
in love with each other.

1252
01:58:44,258 --> 01:58:45,808
Strange is this love!

1253
01:58:47,234 --> 01:58:51,096
Yes, bro. Love is a strange thing.

1254
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:54,342
How did you know that?

1255
01:58:55,719 --> 01:58:57,342
I read that in the novels.

1256
01:59:14,564 --> 01:59:16,381
You, so late in the night?

1257
01:59:16,767 --> 01:59:18,581
Where are you coming
from so late?

1258
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:22,253
- I was at the income tax office.
- Office? At this hour?

1259
01:59:23,113 --> 01:59:25,625
I mean I had gone
to the officer's house.

1260
01:59:27,128 --> 01:59:30,453
- Had you gone yesterday, too?
- Yesterday I had gone to the club.

1261
01:59:30,974 --> 01:59:34,159
Where do you have
the dinner these days?

1262
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:37,107
Anywhere. You know that Hotel Rasraj?

1263
01:59:37,408 --> 01:59:39,128
They have some very
good vegetarian recipes.

1264
01:59:39,175 --> 01:59:41,989
And, who serves good
non-vegetarian recipes?

1265
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:45,680
Who was that girl?

1266
01:59:46,713 --> 01:59:47,842
Which girl?

1267
01:59:49,513 --> 01:59:52,154
The one you had
brought in this house.

1268
01:59:52,845 --> 01:59:55,524
The one who stayed here all
night and went away in the morning.

1269
01:59:56,723 --> 01:59:59,386
Who was that girl?
Why don't you answer?

1270
02:00:01,676 --> 02:00:03,282
Whatever my father said was right.

1271
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:07,369
People are saying the truth that
you've kept her in another house.

1272
02:00:08,379 --> 02:00:10,404
Is this why you keep
running away from me?

1273
02:00:11,384 --> 02:00:14,198
Now I know what keeps you busy.

1274
02:00:14,829 --> 02:00:16,927
You are playing with me.
You are cheating me.

1275
02:00:17,007 --> 02:00:20,294
All this is false.
I'll tell you who the girl is.

1276
02:00:36,548 --> 02:00:37,834
Why did you stop?

1277
02:00:39,079 --> 02:00:40,822
Why are you hiding your face?

1278
02:00:41,723 --> 02:00:44,025
Because I don't have any
answer for such useless matter.

1279
02:00:44,555 --> 02:00:47,288
Because I love you, it doesn't
mean that I'll dance on your tunes.

1280
02:00:47,799 --> 02:00:50,474
I can't meet anyone.
I can't talk to anyone.

1281
02:00:50,778 --> 02:00:53,881
What's wrong with you?
You get angry on trifle matters.

1282
02:00:54,816 --> 02:00:57,821
You believe what people say,
but not what I say.

1283
02:00:59,254 --> 02:01:03,664
All right. You are free
to believe what you want.

1284
02:01:21,565 --> 02:01:22,565
Seema!

1285
02:01:49,649 --> 02:01:52,279
- Why have you come here?
- To take back my words.

1286
02:01:53,761 --> 02:01:57,529
Seema, a person says and does
nonsense out of his frustrations.

1287
02:01:58,405 --> 02:02:00,274
One such moment came on me, too.

1288
02:02:01,212 --> 02:02:04,111
What are these troubles after all?
And why?

1289
02:02:04,296 --> 02:02:06,327
There are some matters
which cannot be told.

1290
02:02:06,415 --> 02:02:08,625
There are some questions
which have no answers, Seema.

1291
02:02:08,805 --> 02:02:13,450
I am helpless. I have some
responsibilities. Don't get me wrong.

1292
02:02:14,805 --> 02:02:20,631
Have faith in me. I am no one's.
I am only yours, Seema.

1293
02:02:25,134 --> 02:02:27,440
Then why do people
say that you're not mine?

1294
02:02:27,909 --> 02:02:29,576
Let them say.

1295
02:02:29,828 --> 02:02:31,093
Why let them say that?

1296
02:02:32,245 --> 02:02:34,271
My dreams are yours now.

1297
02:02:36,106 --> 02:02:41,636
I've come so far with
you that I can't go back now.

1298
02:02:45,255 --> 02:02:48,552
I'm yours till my last breath.

1299
02:02:48,782 --> 02:02:51,379
I can't hear a word against you.

1300
02:02:52,313 --> 02:02:55,776
Sapan, stop these words forever.

1301
02:02:56,383 --> 02:02:58,372
Stop the fingers pointing at you.

1302
02:02:58,812 --> 02:03:01,872
Fall down this wall
that is rising between us.

1303
02:03:03,477 --> 02:03:08,312
And tell the world that you're mine.
And of no one else. Sapan...

1304
02:03:09,055 --> 02:03:10,055
Sapan..

1305
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:24,891
Sapan, I regret to say that...

1306
02:03:25,262 --> 02:03:27,624
the doors of my house
are closed for you from today.

1307
02:03:28,209 --> 02:03:32,109
- Father, what are you saying?
- Keep quiet, Seema!

1308
02:03:32,776 --> 02:03:35,040
I'm saying this after
thinking carefully.

1309
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:40,374
Sapan, I hope you won't
try to meet Seema in future.

1310
02:03:40,706 --> 02:03:43,652
- But, uncle...
- There's no need for an explanation. I know everything.

1311
02:03:43,732 --> 02:03:45,890
- But father...
- You talk again.

1312
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:48,351
Don't dare to talk.

1313
02:03:50,313 --> 02:03:52,687
Sapan, I'd be obliged
if you go away from here.

1314
02:03:53,872 --> 02:03:58,194
I care for your father's dignity.
I don't want to throw you out.

1315
02:04:18,151 --> 02:04:20,938
Pyarelal, you? What is all this?

1316
02:04:21,059 --> 02:04:23,492
It's your happiness.
I've agreed to you and joined a duty.

1317
02:04:23,572 --> 02:04:25,593
- I became agree.
- Are you doing a job?

1318
02:04:25,734 --> 02:04:29,070
Exactly. I've become a driver.

1319
02:04:29,548 --> 02:04:32,529
Good that you found a job.
I'm very happy.

1320
02:04:32,713 --> 02:04:36,234
Are you happy? Then ask
your parents about marriage...

1321
02:04:36,453 --> 02:04:39,172
Sir has come. Bye.

1322
02:04:39,821 --> 02:04:40,821
Bye.

1323
02:04:45,328 --> 02:04:48,328
- Pyarelal, who was she?
- I don't know.

1324
02:04:48,431 --> 02:04:50,290
She was asking for a lift.
I hushed her away.

1325
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:55,822
Donkey! Why didn't you let her sit?
Come fast. Come on.

1326
02:05:08,891 --> 02:05:11,326
Stop the car, driver.
Where do you want to go?

1327
02:05:11,794 --> 02:05:15,286
- King Road.
- I'm also going there. Come. Sit.

1328
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:25,819
- What is your name?
- Usha.

1329
02:05:26,293 --> 02:05:28,738
Usha? What a lovely name!

1330
02:05:28,818 --> 02:05:32,742
- The tyre on this side is weak.
- Look in front.

1331
02:05:33,132 --> 02:05:34,737
Don't bump into something.

1332
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:36,906
Where do you live?

1333
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:38,901
At the Church Street.

1334
02:05:39,316 --> 02:05:43,400
Really? Never saw you before.
Where were you hiding?

1335
02:05:43,481 --> 02:05:45,360
Sir, you want to go to the office,
don't you?

1336
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,766
Don't you know? Donkey!
Look ahead.

1337
02:05:48,266 --> 02:05:49,649
Where do we go everyday?

1338
02:05:53,649 --> 02:05:55,461
What lovely hair!

1339
02:05:55,807 --> 02:05:56,838
Pyare!

1340
02:06:00,487 --> 02:06:02,171
Drive the car straight.

1341
02:06:02,393 --> 02:06:04,680
I am driving straight,
but the road is crooked.

1342
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:09,667
Why are you scared? Sit close to me.

1343
02:06:14,113 --> 02:06:17,173
Sorry, sir. There was a puppy ahead.
So I had to pull up the car.

1344
02:06:17,253 --> 02:06:20,281
- My nose's broken.
- It's broken? It's not cut?

1345
02:06:21,149 --> 02:06:23,155
- Shall I take you to the hospital?
- Fast!

1346
02:06:36,215 --> 02:06:38,000
- Hello, Seema.
- Hello!

1347
02:06:39,336 --> 02:06:43,231
- Is Sapan in?
- No. Don't know where he goes these days.

1348
02:06:43,358 --> 02:06:45,451
Where will he go?
You'll find him somewhere.

1349
02:06:46,527 --> 02:06:50,255
- Deepak, have you heard anything about Sapan?
- What?

1350
02:06:51,778 --> 02:06:57,717
- That... about a girl.
- That girl? Seema, you're strange!

1351
02:06:57,969 --> 02:07:00,079
People are spreading
rumors to defame him.

1352
02:07:00,248 --> 02:07:04,396
I turn a deaf ear to them.
You also do that. Come.

1353
02:07:16,008 --> 02:07:17,247
Where will you go, Seema?

1354
02:07:18,374 --> 02:07:20,670
Where would I go? Drop me home.

1355
02:07:22,425 --> 02:07:25,097
What will you do at home?
I want you to meet someone.

1356
02:07:26,339 --> 02:07:27,973
- Whom?
- I'll tell you that later.

1357
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:37,499
Seema, wait here. I'll be right back.

1358
02:07:46,507 --> 02:07:49,547
Wow! You've pressed my head with...

1359
02:07:49,735 --> 02:07:51,773
so much love that
my headache is gone forever.

1360
02:07:58,372 --> 02:07:59,372
Deepak!

1361
02:08:02,748 --> 02:08:04,626
Deepak, how come you're here?

1362
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:17,133
Very good! The same drama
is going on behind the curtains.

1363
02:08:18,524 --> 02:08:21,298
How many will you hide in your drape,
Lajwanti?

1364
02:08:21,715 --> 02:08:22,542
Deepak...

1365
02:08:22,622 --> 02:08:25,640
Don't touch me with these
hands which have hugged someone else.

1366
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,109
Deepak, what you're
thinking is false.

1367
02:08:28,197 --> 02:08:31,914
I was thinking wrong till now.
But now the truth has come out.

1368
02:08:32,593 --> 02:08:35,545
I thought you were different
from all those society girls.

1369
02:08:36,747 --> 02:08:40,768
But I am sure now that your
intentions re even worse than theirs.

1370
02:08:41,966 --> 02:08:44,457
Deepak, why don't you
say to me what you want?

1371
02:08:45,017 --> 02:08:46,589
I don't want to say anything to you.

1372
02:08:47,226 --> 02:08:49,045
I want to ask this idol of loyalty...

1373
02:08:49,405 --> 02:08:51,261
who answered my
loyalty with disloyalty.

1374
02:08:51,819 --> 02:08:54,055
Is so much evil hidden
behind this innocent face?

1375
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:56,497
You've turned 2 friends into enemies.

1376
02:08:56,836 --> 02:09:00,028
- You scoundrel! Wicked!
- Leave her.

1377
02:09:03,823 --> 02:09:05,893
You are totally out of
your senses at this moment.

1378
02:09:06,694 --> 02:09:08,785
- It is you who are out of senses.
- Stop blabbering!

1379
02:09:09,014 --> 02:09:11,330
I cannot bear Lajwanti
being insulted.

1380
02:09:11,623 --> 02:09:15,269
How can you bear that?
You love her, don't you?

1381
02:09:15,349 --> 02:09:19,453
Deepak, I'll tell you why
he can't bear me being insulted.

1382
02:09:19,534 --> 02:09:20,772
Lajwanti!

1383
02:09:21,829 --> 02:09:24,354
Speak! Why did you stop?

1384
02:09:25,359 --> 02:09:29,946
What remains with you now to be said?
The mask is off your faces.

1385
02:09:30,535 --> 02:09:31,935
Sapan, isn't this the same house...

1386
02:09:31,961 --> 02:09:33,898
where you used to
come secretly at nights?

1387
02:09:34,111 --> 02:09:36,852
- Deepak!
- Don't call me with your poisonous tongue.

1388
02:09:37,612 --> 02:09:39,671
You have not only robbed
my friendship and love...

1389
02:09:39,937 --> 02:09:41,609
but have also cheated Seema.

1390
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:44,380
The one whom you loved,
with whom you sang songs of love...

1391
02:09:45,104 --> 02:09:46,628
now that she
is ready to wed you...

1392
02:09:46,709 --> 02:09:48,665
you left her and
held the hand of this girl?

1393
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:51,189
You take this goddess
of road to be yours...

1394
02:09:51,269 --> 02:09:53,320
who satisfies the
desires of all passersby?

1395
02:09:58,984 --> 02:09:59,984
Ok.

1396
02:10:04,474 --> 02:10:08,739
Your name is Lajwanti. But you
don't have a drop of Laj (shyness).

1397
02:10:20,922 --> 02:10:22,446
What happened?

1398
02:10:22,972 --> 02:10:23,972
Nothing.

1399
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:30,375
- Seema, you want to meet Sapan, don't you?
- Yes.

1400
02:10:31,811 --> 02:10:33,419
Then go. He's in this bungalow.

1401
02:10:35,687 --> 02:10:37,957
- In this bungalow?
- Yes, Seema.

1402
02:10:48,954 --> 02:10:50,254
Don't be tensed.

1403
02:10:50,543 --> 02:10:53,034
I can bear all the grief
of this world for your happiness.

1404
02:11:00,998 --> 02:11:04,380
Come on now. Smile. Smile!

1405
02:11:13,229 --> 02:11:16,775
Seema! Listen to me...

1406
02:11:19,095 --> 02:11:21,063
All right.
But you'll have to understand...

1407
02:11:21,163 --> 02:11:23,075
my relation with her before going.

1408
02:11:24,063 --> 02:11:25,768
She is helpless, whom I'm supporting.

1409
02:11:26,327 --> 02:11:27,919
She's a trust, which I'm guarding.

1410
02:11:28,918 --> 02:11:30,264
Her name is Lajwanti.

1411
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:32,662
If she hadn't been with me today...

1412
02:11:32,884 --> 02:11:35,054
her dignity would have
been robbed in the market.

1413
02:11:35,824 --> 02:11:38,216
It's neither her fault nor mine.

1414
02:11:38,902 --> 02:11:41,131
It is a mistake of the
elders which we are paying for.

1415
02:11:43,597 --> 02:11:48,604
Seema, I swear on God that
our relation is as holy as religion.

1416
02:11:50,282 --> 02:11:51,987
You do make up nice tales!

1417
02:11:59,677 --> 02:12:00,712
Greetings.

1418
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,489
- Greetings, madam.
- Greetings.

1419
02:12:11,996 --> 02:12:13,112
Greetings.

1420
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:18,078
- Greetings.
- So, tell me, how are you sir?

1421
02:12:21,962 --> 02:12:23,860
Come, have a seat.

1422
02:12:27,529 --> 02:12:30,727
- What brings you here?
- I've come to take Lajwanti.

1423
02:12:31,226 --> 02:12:32,226
What do you mean?

1424
02:12:33,530 --> 02:12:37,322
That means, I'm not talking Persian.
I'm talking in normal Hindi.

1425
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:39,879
How much money do you want?

1426
02:12:41,118 --> 02:12:46,155
Money is useless, sir.
This is a matter of motherly affection.

1427
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:49,154
The mother is eager
to meet her daughter.

1428
02:12:49,402 --> 02:12:50,713
Lajwanti won't go from here.

1429
02:12:51,566 --> 02:12:55,264
How wouldn't she, sir?
I will take her. I have a right over her.

1430
02:12:55,723 --> 02:12:59,127
I have a right on her, not you.
Lajwanti is my sis.

1431
02:13:01,804 --> 02:13:02,804
Sister...

1432
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:06,714
- Lajwanti is not your sister, sir.
- What rubbish are you talking?

1433
02:13:06,795 --> 02:13:11,168
I'm just requesting. The real
daughter of Rai died long time back.

1434
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:16,424
She is fake!
I played this drama to gain money.

1435
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:20,599
I played it with your father.
Now I'm playing that with you.

1436
02:13:21,478 --> 02:13:22,733
Do you get it now, sir?

1437
02:13:23,030 --> 02:13:25,335
Doesn't matter if
Lajwanti is not my sis.

1438
02:13:26,176 --> 02:13:29,223
Whoever she might be,
she's come to my house as my sis.

1439
02:13:29,554 --> 02:13:32,517
And she'll go from this house as
someone's bride, not as a prostitute.

1440
02:13:37,327 --> 02:13:38,931
Come on, brothers.

1441
02:13:39,918 --> 02:13:42,210
We know how to get our job done, sir.

1442
02:13:42,875 --> 02:13:45,365
You cannot take Lajwanti
as long as I am alive.

1443
02:13:46,632 --> 02:13:48,733
You'll have to pass over
my dead body to take Lajo.

1444
02:13:48,855 --> 02:13:53,455
Uncle, I'm going out.
Come out when you've dealt with him!

1445
02:13:54,537 --> 02:13:56,412
Lajwanti,
is it you who are saying this?

1446
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:00,027
What else do you expect
from a courtesan, sir?

1447
02:14:01,497 --> 02:14:06,359
We are no one's brother or sister.
It is our profession to cheat.

1448
02:14:06,634 --> 02:14:09,319
How will we survive
if we don't deceive people?

1449
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:14,152
Uncle, make it fast. I feel
suffocated in this room. Greetings.

1450
02:14:14,969 --> 02:14:18,000
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1451
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:23,594
Lajwanti, I won't let you
go even after knowing everything.

1452
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:26,988
You are mine. And I'm ready to
make you mine in front of the world.

1453
02:14:27,498 --> 02:14:28,498
Really?

1454
02:14:29,915 --> 02:14:31,130
You are foolish!

1455
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:35,414
Mr. Deepak, a prostitute is
not for one person. She is for all!

1456
02:14:35,495 --> 02:14:36,495
Lajwanti!

1457
02:14:36,712 --> 02:14:39,919
If you want to meet me,
come to my court.

1458
02:14:51,724 --> 02:14:52,724
Greetings.

1459
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,816
Sapan, forgive me.

1460
02:15:27,819 --> 02:15:29,592
Good that this sparkle doused here.

1461
02:15:30,729 --> 02:15:32,790
Or it could have
ruined all three of us.

1462
02:15:33,558 --> 02:15:36,839
Good that you've come, Mr.
Deepak. I was coming to your house.

1463
02:15:37,155 --> 02:15:39,126
Madam had told me to
give this letter to you.

1464
02:15:46,309 --> 02:15:50,597
Drive the car fast, uncle. Faster!

1465
02:15:52,468 --> 02:15:54,890
Deepak, I'm that unlucky girl...

1466
02:15:55,634 --> 02:15:57,430
whom a father could
not call his child...

1467
02:15:57,648 --> 02:15:59,790
and whom a brother
could not call his sister.

1468
02:16:04,087 --> 02:16:07,844
I got only your love.
Now that is also robbed off by suspicion.

1469
02:16:08,881 --> 02:16:11,535
I swear on God that Sapan is my bro.

1470
02:16:13,646 --> 02:16:17,952
I've known today that I've
become a trouble for my bro.

1471
02:16:19,045 --> 02:16:21,195
A friendship was broken because of me.

1472
02:16:21,456 --> 02:16:23,538
Brother's dreams were
shattered because of me.

1473
02:16:24,034 --> 02:16:25,251
Seema went away upset.

1474
02:16:35,663 --> 02:16:41,772
You will receive this letter when...
when I will be no more!

1475
02:16:43,004 --> 02:16:45,070
- Lajo!
- Let go of me.

1476
02:16:45,469 --> 02:16:48,629
- I want to die.
- But you came at your own wish.

1477
02:16:48,710 --> 02:16:51,950
Not at all.
I did this to save bro Sapan's life.

1478
02:16:52,031 --> 02:16:54,169
How will we live if you die?

1479
02:17:09,254 --> 02:17:12,209
Uncle, what have you done?

1480
02:17:12,657 --> 02:17:14,203
Come, sir. Sit in the car.

1481
02:17:15,333 --> 02:17:16,909
Pyarelal, come.

1482
02:17:29,219 --> 02:17:31,673
Uncle, where are you taking me?

1483
02:17:31,871 --> 02:17:36,271
I'm taking you nowhere.
Sir is taking you to his mansion.

1484
02:17:36,838 --> 02:17:39,176
Lajo, why would you
stay in our hut now?

1485
02:17:39,585 --> 02:17:42,133
I'll die, but I won't go there.

1486
02:17:43,475 --> 02:17:46,956
Queen, now we'll live and die together.

1487
02:17:57,716 --> 02:17:59,799
- What's wrong with the car?
- It's stopped.

1488
02:18:00,025 --> 02:18:02,430
Looks like there's
dust in the petrol.

1489
02:18:09,847 --> 02:18:11,606
Open the bonnet of the car.

1490
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:38,301
Some goons are taking away a girl.

1491
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:40,061
We're looking for that same girl.
Which way did they go?

1492
02:18:40,085 --> 02:18:41,403
- That side.
- Come, sit.

1493
02:18:58,018 --> 02:18:59,018
There they are.

1494
02:19:58,626 --> 02:20:02,084
They were trying to follow Puran!
They're still kids!

1495
02:20:02,391 --> 02:20:06,894
Mr. Puran, you're great.
You reached us to the bungalow after all.

1496
02:20:23,116 --> 02:20:27,371
Pyare, no! Pyare, what are you doing?

1497
02:20:28,084 --> 02:20:30,060
Beating your own boss?
I shall double your salary.

1498
02:20:30,164 --> 02:20:31,833
I shall do that for you.

1499
02:21:44,992 --> 02:21:47,411
Catch him!

1500
02:22:47,201 --> 02:22:49,202
You cannot run away from me.

1501
02:23:44,303 --> 02:23:45,303
Sapan!

1502
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:19,589
Give me your hand.

1503
02:24:23,071 --> 02:24:24,812
Give me your hand.

1504
02:24:30,704 --> 02:24:31,766
Give me your hand.

1505
02:25:00,773 --> 02:25:02,528
You cannot run away.

1506
02:25:29,601 --> 02:25:33,576
- What are you doing?
- Leave me! - I won't let you die.

1507
02:25:34,378 --> 02:25:35,932
All this trouble is because of me.

1508
02:25:36,634 --> 02:25:39,503
If I die, bro will be out of trouble.

1509
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:42,686
No one will say
or do anything to you.

1510
02:25:42,767 --> 02:25:46,595
No, these goons won't
let me stay with brother.

1511
02:25:48,089 --> 02:25:49,101
Lajwanti!

1512
02:25:49,182 --> 02:25:52,107
Sapan, see how foolish she is acting!
She wants to die.

1513
02:25:53,134 --> 02:25:57,351
Silly, the days have now come to live.
No one will harass you now.

1514
02:25:57,861 --> 02:26:01,299
- I will tell the whole world that you are my sis.
- Brother!

1515
02:26:01,626 --> 02:26:04,630
"Now is the time to live."

1516
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:12,710
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."

1517
02:26:13,886 --> 02:26:17,307
"Now is the time to live."

1518
02:26:17,387 --> 02:26:24,485
"I had gone for a stroll,
when I suddenly found you, dear."
