1
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,088
Oh, my God.

2
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,630
Come. Come.

3
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,827
Sir. He's Mr. Dsousa.

4
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,328
You brought this girl here? - Yes.

5
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,633
Take his signed statement. - Yes.

6
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,273
Mr. Dsousa, do not go out
of Goa forthe next few days...

7
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,672
...without informing us.

8
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,933
Okay.

9
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,339
Come.

10
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,113
Sir, this is Dr. Menon.

11
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,876
He's handling the female's case.

12
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,675
Hello, Doctor. - Hello.

13
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,385
Vargese.

14
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,382
lnsp. Vargese.

15
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,679
Dr. Menon. - Okay.

16
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,778
What do you think, doctor?

17
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,118
How soon can she
regain consciousness?

18
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,586
lt's hard to say.

19
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,217
She was brought here
in a very bad shape.

20
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,326
Looking at her condition...

21
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,592
...we can imagine that
she struggled really hard.

22
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:33,795
She's out of it now.

23
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,596
But only after a
CT Scan can we say...

24
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,599
...how successful her struggle was.

25
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,132
Did you find anything
in her clothes?

26
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,641
Some lD...
Any kind of identification?

27
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:44,875
No.

28
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,071
And l feel you'll have
to wait for a long time...

29
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,841
...to take her statement.

30
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,747
ln such cases and conditions and
formal cases the patients...

31
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,120
Okay, doctor. - Excuse me!

32
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,955
Stay alert.

33
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,756
Whoever did this can strike again.

34
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,425
lnform me first when
she regains consciousness.

35
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,336
Okay?

36
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,065
l should be the first one.
- Sure, sir.

37
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,196
Alright, see you.

38
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,693
Sir...that girl's still alive.

39
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,668
Gaekwad, how long are
you going to stand here?

40
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,369
Go get a cup of tea.

41
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
l'll stay here. - Yes.

42
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,106
And yes.

43
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,403
Get me a nice cup of tea too.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:09,987
Oh, my god!

45
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,218
Ma'am...

46
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,986
Ma'am...are you okay?

47
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,292
What happened?

48
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,628
Ma'am...

49
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,728
You're in a hospital.

50
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,132
No need to be scared.

51
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,062
Just relax!

52
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,538
l'll call the doctor, okay?

53
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,030
Relax!

54
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,645
ls everything okay, nurse?

55
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,145
She's conscious,
but seems disoriented.

56
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,951
Please inform your
superior officer. - Sure.

57
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,156
And file a case against
both of them. - Okay sir.

58
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,563
Sir!

59
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,209
Gaekwad!

60
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,577
Where's the girl?

61
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,340
Sir, l was sitting right here.

62
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,777
Where's the girl?
- She was right here.

63
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,218
Dr. Menon examined her a while ago.

64
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,255
And sir, l gave her sedatives
myself and tucked her in.

65
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,880
So did she sleepwalk out of here?

66
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,587
Were you two awake or sleeping?

67
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,123
Gaekwad, lock this hospital down.

68
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,631
No one gets in and no one gets out.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,064
Alvin, relay to the headquarters...

70
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,659
...l want more backup, right now.

71
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,637
Where's the Dean of this hospital?

72
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,830
Sir, ground floor.

73
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,279
Did you see a girl here?
- No, sir.

74
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,142
Do one thing, check
the room at the back.

75
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,985
And D'souza, go down
and check at the reception.

76
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,746
lf you find any information
then tell sir about it. - Yes, sir.

77
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,768
Nurse. - Yes, sir.

78
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,235
Myself, insp. Anton.

79
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,897
Afemale patient's missing
from the 2nd floorward.

80
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
Did you see anyone
heading this way...

81
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,897
...who didn't belong here?

82
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,807
l saw no one, sir. - Okay.

83
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,792
Sir, the doctorwants
to speak to you urgently.

84
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,095
Yes, doctor. - We've received
the patient's CT scan reports.

85
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,699
She has a serious problem.

86
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,240
She has partial cerebral
hypoxic ischemia.

87
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:56,975
Meaning.

88
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,601
Well, she didn't get oxygen
for a long time in the coffin...

89
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,970
...which means her brain
didn't get oxygen for a long time.

90
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,709
That's why she has
suffered some brain damage.

91
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,611
This brain damage will
affect her coordination...

92
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,620
...between the brain and muscles.

93
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,719
She'll suffer seizures.

94
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,257
She can also have hallucinations.

95
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,254
We call it delusion.

96
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,051
lt needs to be cured.

97
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,027
lf she stays alone,
she can also die.

98
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,526
Don't worry,
we will find her, doctor. - Okay.

99
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,693
Gaekwad, l want updates
every10 minutes. - Yes sir.

100
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,560
Father used to say,
love of the people...

101
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,673
...and Mandar in the elections...

102
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,332
...both are meant forwinning.

103
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:09,942
l've witnessed your
love in today's rally.

104
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:15,048
And soon we'll witness
the enemy's defeat.

105
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,725
Glory to... - Mandar!

106
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,658
Glory to... - Mandar!

107
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,628
Glory to... - Mandar!

108
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,665
Glory to... - Mandar!

109
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,723
Glory to... - Mandar!

110
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,701
Glory to... - Mandar!

111
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:35,029
ln this political ocean
you'll come across many...

112
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,768
...ready to reap the rewards.

113
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,710
But a true devotee of Shiva...

114
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,038
...is someone who's ready
to swallow poison just like Him.

115
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,809
Mandar is a devotee of Lord Shiva.

116
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,953
And so he promises that,
if needed...

117
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,386
...on the holy occasion
if 'Shiv Ratri'...

118
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:57,653
...he'll put his life
at stake for his brothers.

119
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,725
lt's forthe protection
of righteousness.

120
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:05,961
So your protection
is my duty and my deed.

121
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,029
Glory to... - Mandar!

122
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,098
Glory to... - Mandar!

123
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,200
Glory to... - Mandar!

124
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,745
Glory to... - Mandar!

125
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,041
Glory to... - Mandar!

126
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,139
Glory to... Mandar! - Move back!

127
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,083
Glory to... - Mandar!

128
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,654
Glory to... - Mandar!

129
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,923
Come, dear. - Come.

130
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:25,887
You two go home.

131
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,982
l'lljoin you later.

132
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,253
Aren't you coming along?

133
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,055
Along with 'Shiv Ratri',
it's also Anu's birthday.

134
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,189
You want me to blow up balloons...

135
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,361
...and light birthday candles...

136
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,302
...instead of preparing
forthe elections.

137
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,797
Stop this charade and go home.

138
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,910
Have you seen today's paper?

139
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,509
lf 18 is the legal age to vote...

140
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,851
...then why is the
legal age to booze 25?

141
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,959
How long with the
youth be toyed around?

142
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:07,298
How long with their sensibility
and values be questioned?

143
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,533
That's Atul's new move.

144
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,207
To draw the youth's
attention towards him.

145
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,973
Yes, uncle.
When the sea's churned...

146
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,773
...the demons will also
get hold of something.

147
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,212
But you thought that demon politics.

148
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,178
lt's really sad that
he's your uncle's son.

149
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:51,667
Hello.

150
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,768
The horse moves 21/2 paces.

151
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,338
From E3 to F5.

152
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,712
Make your move.

153
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,587
l...l...l can't think
of anything right now.

154
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,886
l don't have much time.
Make your move.

155
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:13,227
l am actually...getting
late for my photography class.

156
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,361
l have just 40 seconds.

157
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,862
Speak up.

158
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:31,143
lf you move the horse, the tower...

159
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,151
No, no, l mean the queen...

160
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:42,885
l am really sorry,
l can't rememberthe chessboard.

161
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,291
My mind's in the photography class.

162
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,662
Real photos aren't
taken from the camera.

163
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,861
Real photos are those
which get embedded in the mind.

164
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:53,794
lf you want to do anything life...

165
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,033
...then forget the camera,
adjust the focus of your life.

166
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,641
To hell with your...

167
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,808
l'll come by 5pm, be at home.

168
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,179
Sir, why don't we flash
her photo on television...

169
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,717
...and make an announcement?

170
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,682
We aren't the only ones
looking for her, Gaikwad.

171
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,689
There's someone she's
trying to escape from.

172
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,223
lf we make an announcement...

173
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,622
...it will alert those people.

174
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,623
Okay.

175
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,092
Quietly keep a watch on everyone.

176
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,959
lf you suspect anyone,
bring him to me.

177
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:53,724
Okay. - Sir.

178
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,629
One more thing.

179
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,633
Find out where's the
control room forthis CCTV.

180
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,394
Okay. - Okay, sir.

181
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,101
l had told you,
don't open these boxes.

182
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,603
Don't open these boxes
as long as madam doesn't return.

183
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,001
Now she'll ask who
opened the packed boxes.

184
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,908
l didn't touch these boxes.

185
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,413
lf it wasn't you,
then was it a ghost?

186
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,012
l don't know.

187
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,782
She just stepped
out of the storeroom...

188
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,721
...and she's wearing
a doctor's scrub.

189
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,118
Keep an eye on everyone.

190
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,659
lnform your men.

191
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,369
Hey, stop that bus.

192
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,052
What happened, sir?

193
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,052
l want the number
of that van's driver.

194
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:52,988
Now!

195
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,188
Yes, who is it?

196
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,233
lnsp. Anton speaking.

197
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,996
Park your vehicle on the
side and listen to me carefully.

198
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,367
Yes, sir.
l am doing just that. Hold on.

199
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,343
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

200
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,433
There's a female in your vehicle...

201
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,976
...wearing a doctor's scrub.

202
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,138
Yes, sir. l will check it.

203
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,015
No, sir.

204
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,016
No female here is
wearing a doctor's scrub.

205
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,913
She is jumped of the bus.

206
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,959
Excuse me.

207
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,797
Can...can you please help me? - Yes.

208
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,805
Actually l've to get to Panjim.

209
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,742
l missed my bus due
to an emergency case.

210
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,435
l need help.

211
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,874
You're a doctor? - Yes, yes.

212
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,280
Actually l didn't
get time to change...

213
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,512
...in a hurry to
catch the staff bus.

214
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,312
Well, come right in.

215
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,120
Thank you.

216
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,414
Well, it's your lucky day.

217
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,993
Because l am heading that way.

218
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:20,110
Actually, l was on duty
in the operation theatre, so...

219
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,878
So in a hurry to catch your bus...

220
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,210
...you forgot to wear your slippers.

221
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,443
Right? - Right.

222
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,385
lt happens.

223
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,932
Who are we waiting for?

224
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:00,976
The enemy who can't be a friend.

225
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,249
Father used to say...

226
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:11,420
...a women her place,
and a enemy his stature...

227
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,064
...should be shown soon.

228
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,602
Uncle? - They are here.

229
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,872
Leave me. Leave me.

230
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,677
Leave me. Leave me.

231
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,116
Leave me. Please, leave me.

232
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,021
Sir... - He's Bajirao.

233
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,666
Sir... - He's the one
refusing to sell the shanty.

234
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,993
Sir, sir, it was a big mistake.

235
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,936
But what to do?

236
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,905
That shanty is my home.

237
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,472
lt's a refuge for my wife and kids.

238
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,412
Sir...sir...

239
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,175
l made a big mistake.

240
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,648
l am ready to do as you say, sir.
l made a mistake.

241
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,514
Like you say.

242
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:14,281
Tick...tick...tick...tick.

243
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,417
Sir...sir...

244
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,195
What does Amitabh Bachchan say...

245
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,730
...on ''Kaun Banega Crorepati''.

246
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,367
''Suyi Muyiji, calm down.''

247
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,500
You should've given your answer...

248
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,974
...when l sent the money.

249
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:39,750
Now you've run out of lifeline.

250
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,130
l couldn't open this
bottle of cough syrup...

251
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:38,162
...so l was trying to...

252
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,371
Sonica, l love you.

253
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,945
l know you don't love me.

254
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,911
lt doesn't make a difference to me.

255
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,112
Because my love doesn't
need your approval.

256
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,878
l will always look after you.

257
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,826
And even your...grandma...

258
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,960
...in the old age home.

259
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,832
Just don't try to
separate yourself from me.

260
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,329
ln no way.

261
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,502
lf you part ways,
l'll be really hurt.

262
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:21,037
And if l am hurt,
then your grandma will get hurt.

263
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,475
Get it?

264
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,458
lt's almost dawn, l am going home.

265
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,325
Take care.

266
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:45,927
Have you seen this girl?

267
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,430
No, sir! - Stop!

268
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:48,961
Anybody after you?

269
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,694
No, no one.
- let's go.

270
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,364
Have you seen this girl?

271
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,137
Yes, l have.

272
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:25,264
Hi. - Hi.

273
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,598
lnspector Anton Vargese.

274
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,036
Where did you see this girl?

275
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,440
l gave her a lift a while ago.

276
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,566
Where did you drop her?

277
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,176
She was saying Gabriele Road.

278
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,455
Sir.

279
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,560
The neighbors say
this is the only house...

280
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,653
...that's been locked
for many years.

281
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:56,031
So maybe... - No, this is the one.

282
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:56,996
Let's go.

283
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,219
lt's still wet.

284
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,051
lt's been used just now.

285
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,118
Search the place now. - Yes, sir.

286
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,323
Now! - Okay, sir!

287
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,187
Sir, l searched the entire house.

288
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,826
She isn't here.

289
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,364
She isn't afraid to die.

290
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,830
She's avoiding the police.

291
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,892
Sir, l don't understand one thing.

292
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,498
Why are we following her?

293
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,866
She hasn't committed any crime.

294
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,369
Let her die if she wants to.

295
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,536
What do we care?

296
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,634
The police's job isn't
just stopping crime...

297
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,937
...it's also protecting the people.

298
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,614
Show her photo to
all the neighbors, okay.

299
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,287
lf you suspect anyone,
search their home.

300
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,424
Call the forensics' team.

301
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,519
And stay here until
they don't get here.

302
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,119
Alright? - Yes.

303
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:22,945
So you see.

304
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,946
A direct flash on the subject...

305
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,242
...makes the subject flat.

306
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,381
And it creates a lot
of unnecessary shadow.

307
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,756
You understand, Akshay?

308
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,460
Yes...yes, sir, l get it.

309
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,156
Basically,
bounce light off other object...

310
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,563
...to make beautiful
subject for my next project.

311
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,797
Right, funny boy. That will do.

312
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,905
This week's assignment
will be on perspective.

313
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,870
l've divided all of you
in a pair of twos forthis week.

314
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,003
We'll see how two people...

315
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,845
...view the same sight differently.

316
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,455
So...that will be Ankita and Ashu.

317
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,154
Gauri and Shreyas.

318
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,558
Rahul and Ranvir.

319
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,826
Tulica and Vedica.

320
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,488
Sonica and Akshay.

321
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,426
Everybody ready?

322
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,895
Go ahead and click Mumbai.

323
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,538
You aren't taking photographs.

324
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,401
Not intrested?

325
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,909
Why? ls everything okay?

326
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,880
l broke up with my girlfriend.

327
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:42,958
Oh...

328
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,456
...sorry to hearthat.

329
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,129
But what happened?

330
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,492
That's exactly what
l don't understand.

331
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:49,931
Her dog died.

332
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,862
l only sent a cute message.

333
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,235
Baby, your dog's dead.
l don't know what to do. LOL!

334
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,433
And afterthat she
stopped talking to me.

335
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,840
l mean...silly girl.

336
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,180
You said LOL? - Yes.

337
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,050
You're laughing. - Sorry.

338
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,559
l am really sorry,
l know l shouldn't be laughing.

339
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,221
But who says LOL?

340
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:20,493
LOL...

341
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,965
LOL means lots of love.

342
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,070
ldiot, LOL means Laugh Out Loud.

343
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,095
Oh s***

344
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,562
That means...

345
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,869
No wonder she's thinking that...
- Yeah, right. Exactly.

346
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,540
Now call her up and apologies.

347
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:39,979
Thanks.

348
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,252
You're lying, aren't you?

349
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,364
Right.

350
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,503
But at least you LOL.

351
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:16,543
''Sometimes l wrote
your name on the mirror.''

352
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:22,288
''Sometimes l washed
it away with my tears.''

353
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:28,558
''Sometimes l read
you like a letter.''

354
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:34,435
''Sometimes l hid you in my diary.''

355
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:47,516
''Sometimes l wrote
your name on the mirror.''

356
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:53,615
''Sometimes l washed
it away with my tears.''

357
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:59,258
''Sometimes l read
you like a letter.''

358
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:05,168
''Sometimes l hid you in my diary.''

359
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:12,472
''You don't leave my

You have just one option.

386
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,297
Did you come back early
because you were scared of me?

387
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,495
Or did you get late coming
from yourfriend's home?

388
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,975
l hope l didn't interfere
in your enjoyments?

397
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,947
Believe me.

398
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,115
Father used to say...

399
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:32,551
Ant's wings and serpent's hood...

400
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,029
...should be squashed
in the beginning.

401
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,199
Who were you with?

402
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,637

403
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,340
Tell me who were you with?

404
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,243
Tell me... Tell me...

405
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,044
This is exactly how l feel...

406
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,247
...when you try to
separate yourself from me.

407
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,252

l'm sparing you because
l don't have evidence.

411
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,069
But if l find out that
my suspicion is right...

412
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,546
...then next time you'll
out of breath for good.

413
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,344
You won't breathe again.

414

00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,828
l do as he says.
l'm a puppet in his hands.

544
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,525
He's snatched my right to live.

545
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,229
The right to dream.

546
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,170
The right to love anyone.

547
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:48,535
And if you enter my life,
then he will kill you too.

548
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,942
l want to stay away
and save your life...

549
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:56,485
...why don't you f**** understand.

550
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,547
Please stay away from me, Akshay...

551
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,388
...otherwise he will kill you.

552
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,296
Please!

553
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,209
ls that all?

554
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,078
Oh God, Sonica.

555
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,445
You had me scared.

556
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,517
l thought it was something serious.

557
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,017
Akshay, this is not a joke.

558
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,149
You're the one humiliating our love.

559
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,419
l didn't fall in love to part ways.

560
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,566
And we can't stop living
fearing death, Sonica.

561
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,129
How will we live?

562
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,029
The entire city's scared of him.

563
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,365
Then we won't live in this city.

564
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,902
Mandar Mhatre rules this city,
doesn't he?

565
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,471
Not the entire world.

566
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,047
We'll disappearto a
place he'll neverfind us.

567
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,014
This is stupidity.

568
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,207
This isn't possible, Akshay.

569
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,417
Please stop dreaming.

570
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,386
We've the right to dream...

571
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,160
...and you've the right to love.

572
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,286
Akshay...

''l felt no worries
or shame or care.''

00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:09,242
''l've a desire to see you again.''

585
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:14,839

''You're the reason l'm carefree.''

591
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:12,098
''You're my evening prayer.''

592
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:18,243
''You're unimportant...you're
essential.''

593
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:23,047
''You're my will...you're
my weakness.''

594
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:28,047
''And you're the anxiety...''

595
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:34,654
''...which these events
brought to me.''

596
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:40,525
''You've finally
expressed yourfeelings.''

597
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:45,973
''You've finally
expressed yourfeelings.''

598
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:51,244

Breakfast in bed for my queen.

606
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,747
So much love?

607
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,050
ls it a dream or reality?

608
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,256
50-50.

609
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,655

...and a w**** desire
to get married...

618
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,518
...does surface someday.

619
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,426
Father used to say.

620
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,264

Teach him a lesson
so can't even walk again.

632
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:23,295
Mandar, call off your men
and face me like a man if you can.

Bhagat.

Sonica, no.

822
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:10,652
Sonica, no.

823
01:13:10,756 --> 01:13:11,745
No.

824
01:13:11,857 --> 01:13:13,085
No.

825
01:13:14,059 --> 01:13:16,391
Sonica, no.

826
01:13:50,796 --> 01:13:52,627
Sonica.

827
01:13:53,365 --> 01:13:55,890
Sonica, no.

828
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,829
No.

829
01:14:04,877 --> 01:14:06,606
No.

830
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:36,867
Hello!

831
01:14:36,942 --> 01:14:39,206
Mandar Mhatre,
you always taught me...

832
01:14:40,779 --> 01:14:43,407
...one should never leave
the game of chess incomplete.

833
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,248
Someone has to win.

834
01:14:49,621 --> 01:14:50,952
So l play the pawn.

835
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:56,660
B4 to C5...one of your pawn's dead.

836
01:15:04,803 --> 01:15:06,703
You're mistaken, Mandar.

837
01:15:07,473 --> 01:15:09,304
How can she come out of the grave?

838
01:15:09,374 --> 01:15:11,638
l cannot forget her
voice so soon, uncle.

839
01:15:13,545 --> 01:15:14,773
She didn't just
get out of the grave...

840
01:15:15,948 --> 01:15:17,506
...but also killed Goli.

841
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:19,315
Now?

842
01:15:25,357 --> 01:15:26,324
Now...

843
01:15:27,593 --> 01:15:28,560
Nothing.

844
01:15:29,895 --> 01:15:32,193
Meaning? - l mean we do nothing.

845
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:35,664
She'll make her next move.

846
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:39,634
She's planning to kill
us...and we wait for her.

847
01:15:39,872 --> 01:15:40,861
That's nice.

848
01:15:41,306 --> 01:15:45,003
To kill a rat we don't
run after it, uncle.

849
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:50,980
The rat automatically
gets trapped in the trap...

850
01:15:51,216 --> 01:15:52,513
...to suffice it's hunger.

851
01:15:54,019 --> 01:15:54,986
She'll come.

852
01:15:56,255 --> 01:15:59,850
She will surely come
to us...to die again.

853
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:01,014
Keep an eye... - Okay, sir.

854
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,022
Okay. - Yes.

855
01:16:04,696 --> 01:16:05,560
Hello.

856
01:16:05,664 --> 01:16:06,961
l really troubled you a lot...

857
01:16:07,032 --> 01:16:09,500
...by disappearing from
the hospital, inspector.

858
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,698
l am really sorry.

859
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:13,767
Where are you?

860
01:16:13,872 --> 01:16:15,737
Forget about me
and listen carefully.

861
01:16:17,743 --> 01:16:22,976
Another murderwas committed
the night l was attacked.

862
01:16:23,982 --> 01:16:25,506
Akshay Bedi.

863
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:29,487
There's no FlR in your records.

864
01:16:31,657 --> 01:16:34,683
But l know officers like you...

865
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:37,558
...only need information, not FlR.

866
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,363
What do you want to say?

867
01:16:40,866 --> 01:16:42,766
Akshay's dead body
is still in the car.

868
01:16:45,437 --> 01:16:47,871
And the car's...in Ambolin lake.

869
01:17:11,964 --> 01:17:14,455
Sir, there are two bags in the car.

870
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:16,361
One contained male
and female clothes.

871
01:17:16,602 --> 01:17:18,001
And we found this from the other.

872
01:17:29,948 --> 01:17:31,745
''13th Jun, 2010.''

873
01:17:32,284 --> 01:17:34,878
''He didn't allow me to
attend photography class again.''

874
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:37,915
''Coming to him was once my need.''

875
01:17:38,757 --> 01:17:41,954
''But now l am lost
in front of his needs.''

876
01:17:42,728 --> 01:17:44,059
''Everything belongs to him.''

877
01:17:44,363 --> 01:17:47,526
''The house, the furniture,
the curtains, bedroom.''

878
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:49,456
''And me?''

879
01:17:49,901 --> 01:17:53,735
''l'm a body adorned
in this prison called home.''

880
01:17:54,473 --> 01:17:56,338
''He's appointed another
bodyguard today...''

881
01:17:56,775 --> 01:17:57,935
''...to keep an eye on him.''

882
01:17:58,477 --> 01:17:59,967
''So that l can't go anywhere.''

883
01:18:00,646 --> 01:18:03,513
''lf l had even tried,
he would've killed me.''

884
01:18:03,849 --> 01:18:07,444
''He's neither letting
me live nor die.''

885
01:18:07,786 --> 01:18:09,686
''He controls everything.''

886
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:13,353
''My body, my mind, my spirit.'

887
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:14,991
''He rules Mumbai.''

888
01:18:15,594 --> 01:18:17,858
''l've no way to escape him.''

889
01:18:18,397 --> 01:18:19,728
''The entire city's scared of him.''

890
01:18:19,898 --> 01:18:20,887
''Where can l go?''

891
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:24,059
''l've no one in this
world except for my grandma.''

892
01:18:24,336 --> 01:18:26,770
''Mandar Mhatre is a dangerous man.''

893
01:18:26,872 --> 01:18:28,396
''No one can stop him.''

894
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,829
''l am doomed.''

895
01:18:29,941 --> 01:18:33,035
''Forthe first time
l can see a ray of light.''

896
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:34,578
''ln the form of Akshay.''

897
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,407
''He gave me a collage today.''

898
01:18:36,515 --> 01:18:37,709
''He loves me.''

899
01:18:37,949 --> 01:18:40,509
''And maybe, for a moment
l've put everything behind me...''

900
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:42,382
''...and fallen for him.''

901
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:44,589
''We've decided to elope.''

902
01:18:45,023 --> 01:18:47,048
''We'll go to Goa forever.''

903
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:49,860
''Far away from Mandar
Mhatre's world.''

904
01:18:50,095 --> 01:18:51,824
''We'll settle our own small world.''

905
01:18:52,664 --> 01:18:53,688
''Our own.''

906
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:56,129
''l am finally free
of Mandar Mhatre.''

907
01:18:56,468 --> 01:18:58,902
''lt feels my lifetime
imprisonment...''

908
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,699
''...has finally ended.''

909
01:19:01,073 --> 01:19:03,507
''l am so happy.''

910
01:19:04,509 --> 01:19:07,000
You want me to go to
Mandar Mhatre's house...

911
01:19:07,746 --> 01:19:11,614
...on the basis of these papers,
and arrest him?

912
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:16,953
Do you have any idea
who Mandar Mhatre is?

913
01:19:18,657 --> 01:19:20,056
Along with his arrest warrant...

914
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:21,557
...my death warrant
will be issued as well.

915
01:19:21,993 --> 01:19:23,119
And if l manage to escape alive...

916
01:19:23,195 --> 01:19:24,992
...then people will
kill me on the streets.

917
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:27,554
Sorry, sir.

918
01:19:28,433 --> 01:19:31,459
But l've always had his
respects for Mumbai Police.

919
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:35,199
l know you'll face few
difficulties solving this case.

920
01:19:35,574 --> 01:19:38,634
But l also know that you
won't step back from your duty.

921
01:19:39,578 --> 01:19:40,567
As far as evidence is concerned...

922
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:42,078
...it's not just this diary...

923
01:19:42,547 --> 01:19:44,412
...we also found Akshay
Bedi's dead body.

924
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,514
l did make a mistake.

925
01:19:55,527 --> 01:19:56,892
l wanted to kill both of them.

926
01:19:57,863 --> 01:19:59,296
But the girl escaped.

927
01:19:59,831 --> 01:20:00,889
l did make a mistake.

928
01:20:02,367 --> 01:20:04,801
But l don't understand
how she escaped?

929
01:20:05,737 --> 01:20:07,728
She didn't just escape,
Mhatre sir...

930
01:20:08,106 --> 01:20:09,539
...in fact,
she's taking absurd measures...

931
01:20:09,608 --> 01:20:10,905
...to implicate you.

932
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:14,106
She's the one who called
the inspector in Goa...

933
01:20:14,379 --> 01:20:15,710
...and told him about
Akshay's dead body.

934
01:20:17,983 --> 01:20:19,507
Can the dead body testify?

935
01:20:19,851 --> 01:20:20,840
No.

936
01:20:21,052 --> 01:20:22,542
ls the girl here to testify?

937
01:20:22,721 --> 01:20:23,585
No.

938
01:20:23,855 --> 01:20:25,015
So what's the problem?

939
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:26,718
That inspector's the problem.

940
01:20:27,092 --> 01:20:28,423
He's very smart.

941
01:20:28,794 --> 01:20:31,024
He has the girl's handwritten diary.

942
01:20:31,363 --> 01:20:32,557
And l am quite sure...

943
01:20:32,798 --> 01:20:36,097
...he must have made some
report regarding the dead body.

944
01:20:36,501 --> 01:20:39,629
Will Mandar Mhatre
have to teach you...

945
01:20:39,905 --> 01:20:41,964
...how one officertackles another?

946
01:20:42,441 --> 01:20:44,341
That's fine, but... - Look, Kishore.

947
01:20:44,509 --> 01:20:45,635
Just tell me one thing.

948
01:20:46,344 --> 01:20:49,040
Are you here to help
or add to my problems?

949
01:20:49,147 --> 01:20:50,944
What are you saying, Mhatre sir?

950
01:20:51,049 --> 01:20:52,539
Don't worry at all.

951
01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:54,082
l'll handle everything.

952
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:57,849
l've learnt some
politics in your company.

953
01:21:00,759 --> 01:21:03,387
ln today's breaking news,
l would like to tell you...

954
01:21:03,495 --> 01:21:06,862
...about innocent
and na.i.ve looking...

955
01:21:06,965 --> 01:21:08,557
...Mumbai resident, Sonica Prasad.

956
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:12,134
Yes, Sonica Prasad trapped...

957
01:21:12,404 --> 01:21:13,962
...Akshay Bedi in herfake love.

958
01:21:14,072 --> 01:21:17,599
She went to Goa with
him and murdered him.

959
01:21:21,012 --> 01:21:22,673
Akshay Bedi came to Mumbai...

960
01:21:22,781 --> 01:21:24,442
...to pursue a career
in Fashion photographer.

961
01:21:24,549 --> 01:21:27,848
And they met at Professor
Bajaj's Academy.

962
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:30,046
Uncle, isn't she the same girl?

963
01:21:30,989 --> 01:21:34,049
Your niece, Sonica Prasad.

964
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:35,683
The one l met at the book launch.

965
01:21:38,463 --> 01:21:40,624
She isn't my real niece.

966
01:21:43,034 --> 01:21:44,695
Everyone calls me uncle.

967
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,502
So l call them niece or nephew.

968
01:21:50,642 --> 01:21:52,576
Gushed out of Hardwaar
and locked horns with Mandar.

969
01:21:53,945 --> 01:21:55,776
Locked horns with Mandar.

970
01:21:57,415 --> 01:21:58,643
Locked horns with Mandar.

971
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,721
Poorthing washed all my sins...

972
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,080
...and got tainted herself.

973
01:22:11,796 --> 01:22:12,592
Mandar.

974
01:22:13,865 --> 01:22:15,093
Sonica's grandma is here.

975
01:22:16,568 --> 01:22:18,729
Along with few ward
boys from the old age home.

976
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:28,944
Uncle, now we have a piece
of cheese to catch the rat.

977
01:22:29,848 --> 01:22:31,008
Grandma.

978
01:22:31,116 --> 01:22:32,549
Grandma. Grandma.

979
01:22:34,586 --> 01:22:36,918
Sir...- Why did
you take the trouble?

980
01:22:37,722 --> 01:22:39,189
You could've sent a word,
l would've come.

981
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:42,021
Sit, sit.

982
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:44,454
You could've called,
l would've come.

983
01:22:45,096 --> 01:22:47,257
Save my Soni, sir.

984
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:50,124
Soni can never do such a thing.

985
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:52,264
He can never do this.

986
01:22:52,604 --> 01:22:55,198
The police are
definitely mistaken.

987
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,734
When my son and daughter-in-law
died in an accident...

988
01:22:59,277 --> 01:23:01,472
...you supported her.

989
01:23:02,047 --> 01:23:03,878
You're her guardian.

990
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:07,251
l trust you completely...

991
01:23:08,053 --> 01:23:10,647
...that you will
save Soni somehow.

992
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:21,458
l tried explaining her.

993
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,600
Don't mingle
with this useless boy.

994
01:23:23,668 --> 01:23:26,569
But no,
she eloped with him. - Come.

995
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:28,671
Forgive her, sir.

996
01:23:29,274 --> 01:23:30,002
What are you doing?

997
01:23:30,442 --> 01:23:31,431
You're elderto me.

998
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,703
This way you'll
make me a sinner.

999
01:23:34,312 --> 01:23:36,940
Come on,
let's forget what happened.

1000
01:23:37,382 --> 01:23:39,282
Bring herto him.

1001
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:39,849
Try to explain her...

1002
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:40,975
...that if she
stays underground...

1003
01:23:41,052 --> 01:23:43,350
...the police
will be against her.

1004
01:23:43,555 --> 01:23:47,013
Once she's here, l'll
get her out of this mess somehow.

1005
01:23:47,959 --> 01:23:48,584
Come, Grandma.

1006
01:23:48,693 --> 01:23:52,322
Before she left
she gave me a phone number.

1007
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:03,303
You see...she'll be scared
to see all of you. - l see.

1008
01:24:03,441 --> 01:24:04,908
You stay here. - Yes.

1009
01:24:05,443 --> 01:24:07,536
l'll bring her out.
- You go get her.

1010
01:24:13,018 --> 01:24:14,280
l'll be right back.

1011
01:24:18,423 --> 01:24:20,357
Sonika. - Grandma...

1012
01:24:20,759 --> 01:24:22,283
How are you, my child?

1013
01:24:22,694 --> 01:24:24,321
What has happened?

1014
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:26,655
What is everyone saying about you.

1015
01:24:26,865 --> 01:24:30,028
Grandma, sit down.
Let me explain you everything.

1016
01:24:31,603 --> 01:24:33,730
What will you explain your grandma?

1017
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:36,702
Come. Come with me to Mandar.

1018
01:24:36,775 --> 01:24:38,106
He will handle everything.

1019
01:24:38,376 --> 01:24:40,105
l have talked to him.

1020
01:24:40,378 --> 01:24:41,845
Come on... - No, grandma.

1021
01:24:41,946 --> 01:24:43,846
He will never understand.

1022
01:24:43,915 --> 01:24:46,577
What do you think?
Didn't l think about it?

1023
01:24:47,585 --> 01:24:49,519
Come on. Come on, dear.

1024
01:25:13,878 --> 01:25:16,176
You guys locked
Akshay in the car...

1025
01:25:16,648 --> 01:25:19,173
...and threw him in the lake.

1026
01:25:21,686 --> 01:25:24,985
He couldn't
breathe without oxygen.

1027
01:25:27,025 --> 01:25:28,720
He suffocated.

1028
01:25:30,662 --> 01:25:32,459
l don't have a lake.

1029
01:25:35,834 --> 01:25:38,894
But l'll suffocate you as well.

1030
01:26:03,161 --> 01:26:04,253
Come.

1031
01:26:40,265 --> 01:26:41,630
You...

1032
01:26:46,938 --> 01:26:48,565
Go out. - Yes, sir!

1033
01:26:54,612 --> 01:26:55,306
lt's her.

1034
01:26:56,214 --> 01:26:57,511
She's done it.

1035
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,946
Election's around the corner.

1036
01:27:02,987 --> 01:27:04,818
The media shouldn't
get a whiff of this.

1037
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,714
Close the file.

1038
01:27:22,907 --> 01:27:24,568
ls it genuine? - 1000/0.

1039
01:27:24,642 --> 01:27:26,269
l got it directly
from the Police Station.

1040
01:27:26,845 --> 01:27:28,210
Okay. Thank you.

1041
01:27:45,263 --> 01:27:46,321
l read it.

1042
01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:49,327
Look, l'm really very sorry.

1043
01:27:50,235 --> 01:27:52,260
l did a story
on you considering...

1044
01:27:52,337 --> 01:27:53,861
...you were Akshay
Bedi's murderer.

1045
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:56,202
But think about it once again.

1046
01:27:56,407 --> 01:27:59,205
lf l do this story,
then we're the press...

1047
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:00,834
...no one can harm us.

1048
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,871
But you'll need protection.

1049
01:28:05,283 --> 01:28:08,719
Mandar Mhatre will
need protection, not me.

1050
01:28:10,655 --> 01:28:12,179
l am ready to die.

1051
01:28:13,524 --> 01:28:14,218
Not him.

1052
01:28:14,425 --> 01:28:16,393
We've learned
from trusted sources...

1053
01:28:16,494 --> 01:28:18,587
...that Sonica
is trying to escape...

1054
01:28:18,663 --> 01:28:21,393
...from Mandar Mhatre,
a politician from Vishwa Mahasang...

1055
01:28:21,466 --> 01:28:22,899
...and not the police.

1056
01:28:23,134 --> 01:28:24,931
We've got our hands
on certain evidence...

1057
01:28:25,303 --> 01:28:27,703
...which proves
that Mandar Mhatre...

1058
01:28:27,805 --> 01:28:32,674
...forcefully made Sonica
his mistress for 3 years.

1059
01:28:33,311 --> 01:28:37,372
Sonica's handwritten
diary proves...

1060
01:28:37,448 --> 01:28:39,473
...that she loved Akshay Bedi...

1061
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:41,609
...and was planning
to elope with him.

1062
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:43,710
We'd like to show
you some photographs...

1063
01:28:43,788 --> 01:28:45,881
...which Sonica Prasad
took in her home...

1064
01:28:46,157 --> 01:28:47,784
...in the last 3 years.

1065
01:28:49,494 --> 01:28:51,928
Let me remind you,
that Goa Police...

1066
01:28:52,163 --> 01:28:54,256
...has found Akshay
Bedi's dead body.

1067
01:28:54,332 --> 01:28:55,959
And considering
all the evidences...

1068
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:59,397
...it'll be wrong to
say that only Sonica Prasad...

1069
01:28:59,504 --> 01:29:01,870
...is behind Akshay's murder.

1070
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,532
Mandar... - Move!

1071
01:29:06,477 --> 01:29:07,466
How did they get the diary?

1072
01:29:07,578 --> 01:29:08,545
How did they get the diary?

1073
01:29:11,382 --> 01:29:12,280
Move.

1074
01:29:13,918 --> 01:29:14,942
Mandar...

1075
01:29:16,587 --> 01:29:17,986
When?
When did she write a diary?

1076
01:29:18,323 --> 01:29:19,290
Where did this diary come from?

1077
01:29:31,869 --> 01:29:32,733
Must be the press.

1078
01:29:33,438 --> 01:29:33,961
Tell them no comments.

1079
01:29:34,305 --> 01:29:34,964
No comments.

1080
01:29:35,506 --> 01:29:36,700
l don't want to talk to anyone.

1081
01:29:38,343 --> 01:29:38,934
Who is it?

1082
01:29:39,544 --> 01:29:40,476
What?

1083
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:43,971
Yes. Yes.

1084
01:29:44,549 --> 01:29:45,641
He's right here.

1085
01:29:46,784 --> 01:29:47,751
Call from Delhi.

1086
01:29:48,686 --> 01:29:49,710
Call from Delhi.

1087
01:29:53,324 --> 01:29:54,222
What?

1088
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,290
What do l say?

1089
01:30:08,773 --> 01:30:09,740
Yes, ma'am.

1090
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:11,839
No...

1091
01:30:12,844 --> 01:30:17,304
lt's just a ruse
of the opposition.

1092
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:23,009
And photos can be edited
on a computerthese days.

1093
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:26,916
Yes...yes, ma'am...

1094
01:30:29,594 --> 01:30:30,925
l'll handle everything...

1095
01:30:31,662 --> 01:30:32,924
Yes...

1096
01:30:33,031 --> 01:30:34,259
No problem.

1097
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:37,792
Yes...ma'am.

1098
01:30:53,918 --> 01:30:54,441
Hello.

1099
01:30:54,585 --> 01:30:56,610
Mandar Mhatre's
political rival...

1100
01:30:56,687 --> 01:30:59,554
...and cousin,
Atul Mhatre wants to meet you.

1101
01:31:00,758 --> 01:31:01,747
When do we meet?

1102
01:31:39,497 --> 01:31:41,294
Sorry, sorry, Sonica.

1103
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:43,767
This is more of a filmy
smugglertype meeting, but...

1104
01:31:43,835 --> 01:31:45,700
You can't meet me publicly.

1105
01:31:46,771 --> 01:31:47,567
Correct.

1106
01:31:47,738 --> 01:31:48,762
You're smart.

1107
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:53,942
So...why did you want to meet me?

1108
01:31:56,914 --> 01:32:00,748
Your sorrows have made
me really sad, Sonica.

1109
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:05,755
No need for an election speech.

1110
01:32:07,024 --> 01:32:08,491
Talk clearly.

1111
01:32:08,693 --> 01:32:13,323
Listen, Sonica.
Mandar's wronged you and me too.

1112
01:32:13,965 --> 01:32:15,557
You want revenge...

1113
01:32:15,633 --> 01:32:18,466
...and l want to defeat
him in the next election.

1114
01:32:18,769 --> 01:32:21,067
Our motives are connected.

1115
01:32:22,773 --> 01:32:24,638
l know the police
are looking for you.

1116
01:32:24,775 --> 01:32:30,577
But...l want to organize
a big private press conference...

1117
01:32:30,781 --> 01:32:32,373
...where all the reporters from...

1118
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:33,712
...all the big channels
will be present.

1119
01:32:33,818 --> 01:32:35,513
Yourwhereabouts,
the interview's location...

1120
01:32:35,586 --> 01:32:37,315
...will remain confidential.

1121
01:32:37,722 --> 01:32:38,950
All l want...

1122
01:32:39,056 --> 01:32:41,524
l just want you to
come before the media...

1123
01:32:42,627 --> 01:32:44,390
...and shatter Mandar's image.

1124
01:32:44,929 --> 01:32:49,366
Just add spice to everything
that reporter said with yourtears.

1125
01:32:50,701 --> 01:32:52,362
l'll handle the rest.

1126
01:32:58,376 --> 01:32:59,775
That's only about your interest.

1127
01:33:07,018 --> 01:33:11,512
Sonica, just start
helping me first, and then...

1128
01:33:11,822 --> 01:33:13,756
...as soon as l
win the elections, l will...

1129
01:33:14,425 --> 01:33:16,086
Again the election speech.

1130
01:33:18,129 --> 01:33:19,528
l get it.

1131
01:33:20,097 --> 01:33:21,655
Name your price.

1132
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:25,130
You'll have the entire money
in advance before the sun sets.

1133
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:28,930
l do want an advance, Mr. Atul.

1134
01:33:31,442 --> 01:33:34,377
But it's not money.

1135
01:33:37,014 --> 01:33:40,450
l see. Then what is it?

1136
01:33:42,587 --> 01:33:43,554
Kaka Bhonsle.

1137
01:33:44,855 --> 01:33:45,822
Alive.

1138
01:33:49,594 --> 01:33:51,425
Kaka...Bhonsle.

1139
01:33:56,601 --> 01:33:57,465
Hello.

1140
01:34:02,506 --> 01:34:03,473
l will be there.

1141
01:34:10,448 --> 01:34:12,609
Welcome...Sonica.

1142
01:34:13,818 --> 01:34:17,879
l guess we'll always
be meeting secretly.

1143
01:34:19,624 --> 01:34:22,650
Kaka? - l kept my promise.

1144
01:34:24,695 --> 01:34:25,719
Come.

1145
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:07,832
Father used to say...

1146
01:35:09,206 --> 01:35:12,698
Aweakling's intent,
and politician's promise...

1147
01:35:13,411 --> 01:35:14,708
...are meant to break.

1148
01:35:15,713 --> 01:35:16,941
You must have heard that saying.

1149
01:35:17,548 --> 01:35:19,914
Birds of a
feather...flock together.

1150
01:35:20,618 --> 01:35:23,746
ln this case, politicians
of a feather...flock together.

1151
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:27,916
How are you, Atul?

1152
01:35:27,992 --> 01:35:29,357
Your blessings, brother.

1153
01:35:30,594 --> 01:35:32,562
Sonica, l am so sorry.

1154
01:35:32,697 --> 01:35:36,189
Brother made me an
offer l couldn't refuse.

1155
01:35:36,701 --> 01:35:38,896
We're sharing
seat in the election.

1156
01:35:39,003 --> 01:35:40,698
End of all conflicts.

1157
01:35:47,511 --> 01:35:48,944
Now that we
brothers are together...

1158
01:35:49,747 --> 01:35:50,771
...l don't need uncle.

1159
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:56,379
But you shouldn't
have killed him.

1160
01:36:10,267 --> 01:36:14,761
See...you forcefully
barged in his farmhouse.

1161
01:36:15,639 --> 01:36:21,544
And gravely injured the
watchman and his bodyguard.

1162
01:36:40,998 --> 01:36:42,761
Get up.

1163
01:36:45,436 --> 01:36:48,894
Uncle and you
had quite a scuffle.

1164
01:36:49,607 --> 01:36:51,336
Uncle hurled
you onto this table.

1165
01:36:51,442 --> 01:36:54,639
You got up and hurled
uncle on the dining table.

1166
01:36:55,813 --> 01:36:56,643
Like this.

1167
01:37:07,558 --> 01:37:11,756
Then...somehow you
got hold of the gun...

1168
01:37:12,563 --> 01:37:16,021
...and you shot uncle.

1169
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:26,972
Don't worry, it's empty now.

1170
01:37:33,818 --> 01:37:39,313
She killed uncle,
but she was so gravely injured...

1171
01:37:40,624 --> 01:37:41,886
...that she couldn't escape.

1172
01:37:43,627 --> 01:37:45,117
Poor soul seeking retribution...

1173
01:37:46,096 --> 01:37:47,791
...was on the verge of dying.

1174
01:37:49,633 --> 01:37:52,329
Check and mate.

1175
01:38:38,182 --> 01:38:45,611
''My heart keeps asking me...''

1176
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:51,651
''...why do l love you so much?''

1177
01:38:54,198 --> 01:38:56,826
''Why are your desires...''

1178
01:38:57,234 --> 01:39:01,261
''...more important
than every wish.''

1179
01:39:02,206 --> 01:39:07,701
''l keep uttering
only your name.''

1180
01:39:10,247 --> 01:39:17,653
''Why am l obsessed
to be your companion?''

1181
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:21,856
''Why do l want to
drink yourtears...''

1182
01:39:21,959 --> 01:39:26,396
''...and comfort you?''

1183
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:33,299
''l want to love you every day,
wait for you.''

1184
01:39:34,505 --> 01:39:41,707
''l want to keep
you safe in my arms.''

1185
01:40:14,378 --> 01:40:15,072
Get up.

1186
01:40:17,481 --> 01:40:18,448
Get up, girl.

1187
01:40:18,916 --> 01:40:20,349
What are you staring at? Get up.

1188
01:40:20,618 --> 01:40:21,642
Get up.

1189
01:40:22,486 --> 01:40:24,317
Get up you ham!

1190
01:40:35,666 --> 01:40:37,099
Here, sign it.

1191
01:40:45,909 --> 01:40:46,807
What is it?

1192
01:40:46,877 --> 01:40:52,338
lt states that you killed Goli,
Babu and Kaka Bhonsle.

1193
01:40:52,716 --> 01:40:54,775
You tried to implicate
Mandar Mhatre...

1194
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:57,883
...on the basis of fake
diary and photographs.

1195
01:40:58,455 --> 01:41:00,514
lt's your statement, sign it.

1196
01:41:31,555 --> 01:41:34,490
Sign it.
lt will save you the trouble.

1197
01:41:45,436 --> 01:41:46,698
Let her lie there.

1198
01:41:47,404 --> 01:41:49,338
Hunger and thirst
will set her straight.

1199
01:42:10,394 --> 01:42:17,630
''l keep mentioning
about you all the time.''

1200
01:42:18,335 --> 01:42:23,898
''That's the effect
you've had on me.''

1201
01:42:26,376 --> 01:42:33,942
''l want no advice.''

1202
01:42:34,418 --> 01:42:39,947
''Because my soul's chosen you.''

1203
01:42:42,392 --> 01:42:49,798
''Why am l obsessed
to be your companion?''

1204
01:42:50,601 --> 01:42:53,968
''Why do l want to
drink yourtears...''

1205
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:58,405
''...and comfort you?''

1206
01:42:58,642 --> 01:43:06,139
''l want to love you every day,
wait for you.''

1207
01:43:06,617 --> 01:43:13,853
''l want to keep
you safe in my arms.''

1208
01:43:31,008 --> 01:43:38,710
''The heart's
worried for no reason.''

1209
01:43:39,116 --> 01:43:46,386
''Someone try to explain it.''

1210
01:43:47,124 --> 01:43:54,690
''Destroyed in love,
that's the tradition.''

1211
01:43:55,566 --> 01:44:02,130
''The one that's patient,
is not love.''

1212
01:44:02,573 --> 01:44:06,669
''Try to understand my heart...''

1213
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:09,904
''...what's this all about.''

1214
01:44:10,814 --> 01:44:18,687
''Why am l obsessed
to be your companion?''

1215
01:44:18,856 --> 01:44:22,223
''Why do l want to
drink yourtears...''

1216
01:44:22,459 --> 01:44:26,759
''...and comfort you?''

1217
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:34,737
''l want to love you every day,
wait for you.''

1218
01:44:34,872 --> 01:44:42,142
''l want to keep
you safe in my arms.''

1219
01:44:58,262 --> 01:45:00,457
We would've pounded
her until she agreed.

1220
01:45:01,531 --> 01:45:05,729
lf you think she will
listen to you, then you can try.

1221
01:45:16,647 --> 01:45:20,708
One of the people that
you killed was my officer.

1222
01:45:22,252 --> 01:45:26,245
Your officertried
to kill me in the hospital.

1223
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:31,159
And the other
three killed Akshay.

1224
01:45:31,895 --> 01:45:33,886
My only regret is that...

1225
01:45:34,531 --> 01:45:38,558
...their boss
Mandar Mhatre's alive.

1226
01:45:39,202 --> 01:45:41,670
l know you want to
avenge Akshay's death.

1227
01:45:42,572 --> 01:45:44,938
But that's not your job,
but the law's.

1228
01:45:45,709 --> 01:45:50,669
The same law which the
ACP and Mandartoys around with.

1229
01:45:51,381 --> 01:45:52,609
That's not true.

1230
01:45:53,283 --> 01:45:54,147
Trust me.

1231
01:45:55,319 --> 01:45:55,910
Fine.

1232
01:45:57,654 --> 01:45:59,212
l trust you.

1233
01:46:00,257 --> 01:46:02,248
l'll sign on this statement.

1234
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:05,387
But just promise me one thing.

1235
01:46:08,498 --> 01:46:10,728
You will arrest Mandar Mhatre.

1236
01:46:17,407 --> 01:46:21,867
Tell me...can you
arrest Mandar Mhatre?

1237
01:46:24,548 --> 01:46:28,985
Will your law
punish Mandar Mhatre...

1238
01:46:30,887 --> 01:46:34,983
...for Akshay's murder
and attempt to murder me.

1239
01:46:46,636 --> 01:46:47,625
Come on.

1240
01:46:47,938 --> 01:46:48,870
Come on.

1241
01:46:50,207 --> 01:46:51,504
Move l say.

1242
01:46:51,575 --> 01:46:56,911
Lower your guns or
l'll blow his brains out.

1243
01:46:57,881 --> 01:46:59,348
Put down your guns l said.

1244
01:46:59,416 --> 01:47:00,474
Nobody will shoot.

1245
01:47:00,617 --> 01:47:01,914
Lower your guns.

1246
01:47:04,287 --> 01:47:05,015
Come on.

1247
01:47:05,655 --> 01:47:06,849
Open the door.

1248
01:47:07,557 --> 01:47:09,218
Where's your jeep?

1249
01:47:09,393 --> 01:47:10,917
Where's your jeep? Get your car.

1250
01:47:11,361 --> 01:47:12,350
Stop.

1251
01:47:12,562 --> 01:47:13,722
Give me the car keys.

1252
01:47:13,797 --> 01:47:15,025
l said give me the car keys.

1253
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:16,388
Come on. Get your car.

1254
01:47:16,466 --> 01:47:18,491
Sonica, you cannot escape.

1255
01:47:18,568 --> 01:47:21,230
l am not escaping to live,
but to kill someone.

1256
01:47:21,438 --> 01:47:24,464
Hand me the keys,
otherwise he dies right here.

1257
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:25,565
Give me the keys.

1258
01:47:25,642 --> 01:47:26,768
Hold yourfire. Don't shoot.

1259
01:47:26,843 --> 01:47:27,741
Move back.

1260
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:29,005
Take the key.

1261
01:47:29,346 --> 01:47:30,404
Take the key.

1262
01:47:30,647 --> 01:47:31,705
Give me the keys.

1263
01:47:33,717 --> 01:47:36,447
Open the door, sit inside.

1264
01:47:43,326 --> 01:47:44,384
Come on.

1265
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,673
What? What?

1266
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:00,137
Watching the fun?

1267
01:48:01,278 --> 01:48:03,508
Go back inside or
l'll break you too.

1268
01:48:04,247 --> 01:48:04,941
Come on.

1269
01:48:07,184 --> 01:48:09,175
Get lost.

1270
01:48:19,796 --> 01:48:21,559
The only mistake we made,
Mandar sir...

1271
01:48:22,265 --> 01:48:24,460
...that we mistook her
for a petty girl, like you did.

1272
01:48:24,768 --> 01:48:28,397
But she's too dangerous,
don't underestimate her.

1273
01:48:28,538 --> 01:48:31,166
A girl that can endure
salt on herwounds...

1274
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:33,532
...can't be scared of more pain.

1275
01:48:34,177 --> 01:48:36,372
Tighten the security around you.

1276
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,447
Scaring me?

1277
01:48:38,515 --> 01:48:39,675
You're trying to scare me?

1278
01:48:43,453 --> 01:48:44,977
l'm just asking you to stay alert.

1279
01:48:45,689 --> 01:48:47,623
And she's already lost
so much in this battle...

1280
01:48:47,924 --> 01:48:49,915
...that she has
nothing more to lose.

1281
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,323
l will kill that witch.

1282
01:48:52,496 --> 01:48:53,554
Kill her.

1283
01:48:54,364 --> 01:48:56,389
You already tried that.

1284
01:48:57,968 --> 01:48:59,629
She was half dead...

1285
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:03,670
...when you tormented
her boyfriend to death.

1286
01:49:04,374 --> 01:49:06,672
And she should've
been completely dead...

1287
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:09,244
...when you buried
her alive in the grave.

1288
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:12,575
She's witnessed death so closely...

1289
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:15,509
...that she no longerfears death.

1290
01:49:16,753 --> 01:49:18,414
And those who don't fear death...

1291
01:49:18,922 --> 01:49:21,288
...is the most dangerous person.

1292
01:49:22,259 --> 01:49:23,624
Think about what l said, sir.

1293
01:49:24,294 --> 01:49:26,728
And if you need any
help from my department...

1294
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:27,888
...then give me a call.

1295
01:49:28,665 --> 01:49:29,597
See you.

1296
01:49:59,462 --> 01:50:00,690
l'll disappearfortwo days.

1297
01:50:01,932 --> 01:50:04,093
lf they don't find me,
they won't find you.

1298
01:50:07,571 --> 01:50:09,562
Thank you. - You're welcome.

1299
01:50:10,373 --> 01:50:11,340
And...

1300
01:50:12,742 --> 01:50:13,606
Take this.

1301
01:50:14,578 --> 01:50:15,567
What is this?

1302
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,978
Phone number...of someone
who wants to help you.

1303
01:50:19,849 --> 01:50:21,646
He might get you to Mandar as well.

1304
01:50:21,985 --> 01:50:22,952
Who is he?

1305
01:50:23,053 --> 01:50:25,112
Call him, you'll know.

1306
01:50:29,492 --> 01:50:30,754
Sir, the biggest benefit
of this land is...

1307
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,122
...that it's close to the dam.

1308
01:50:32,963 --> 01:50:34,521
So we'll get an artificial late...

1309
01:50:34,631 --> 01:50:37,099
...and there are poles
close-by for electricity.

1310
01:50:40,704 --> 01:50:41,932
Basically,
sir, we're thinking about...

1311
01:50:42,005 --> 01:50:43,063
...three types of accommodation.

1312
01:50:43,773 --> 01:50:44,899
The first is villa.

1313
01:50:45,508 --> 01:50:46,702
Secondly, we can construct wings...

1314
01:50:46,776 --> 01:50:48,676
...and sell flats.

1315
01:50:48,979 --> 01:50:51,812
You see, sir,
these days people preferflats.

1316
01:50:52,048 --> 01:50:53,948
lt lessens the security hassles..

1317
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:56,610
...and we won't be responsible
forthe maintenance either.

1318
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,620
And third are row houses.

1319
01:50:59,122 --> 01:51:01,886
Villa and flats, combined.

1320
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:03,648
Why is that door open?

1321
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:08,459
Sir...someone must
have left it ajar.

1322
01:51:17,073 --> 01:51:18,506
Actually sir,
it's the catering people.

1323
01:51:18,575 --> 01:51:19,837
They're getting tea and snacks.

1324
01:51:20,777 --> 01:51:21,709
Close it.

1325
01:51:21,945 --> 01:51:23,503
No one...no one's coming it.

1326
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,772
Close it.

1327
01:51:25,548 --> 01:51:26,947
You can have yourtea
and snacks afterthe meeting.

1328
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:28,644
Close the door, come on.

1329
01:51:31,054 --> 01:51:31,952
Snacks...

1330
01:51:38,094 --> 01:51:39,686
So, the land's close to the dam.

1331
01:51:39,829 --> 01:51:40,488
And?

1332
01:51:40,563 --> 01:51:41,860
You two don't move an inch.
- Okay sir.

1333
01:51:42,065 --> 01:51:43,498
There's an interview in
progress inside. - Okay.

1334
01:51:43,566 --> 01:51:45,557
Don't let any outsider in.
- Yes, sir.

1335
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,038
Dolly, listen.

1336
01:51:51,508 --> 01:51:52,497
Get sir a glass of water...

1337
01:51:52,575 --> 01:51:54,907
...and tell the makeup man
to be ready in case of sweat.

1338
01:51:55,045 --> 01:51:56,410
ls that clear? - Okay, madam.

1339
01:51:56,513 --> 01:51:57,207
Alright.

1340
01:51:58,548 --> 01:52:00,812
Sir. Since we can
have just one debate...

1341
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:03,680
...l would like to know
the importance of that diary.

1342
01:52:03,953 --> 01:52:06,183
How...how many people
are allowed in the studio?

1343
01:52:07,791 --> 01:52:08,689
During the show?

1344
01:52:09,693 --> 01:52:13,129
There's the EP, Asst.
Director and my Cameraman.

1345
01:52:13,563 --> 01:52:14,757
Do you have security
clearance for everyone?

1346
01:52:14,998 --> 01:52:16,488
Security clearance?

1347
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,825
Yes, sir. Everyone has an lD.

1348
01:52:18,902 --> 01:52:20,096
Anyone can have an lD card.

1349
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:21,501
This is not right.

1350
01:52:21,604 --> 01:52:22,730
Only these two cameramen stay here.

1351
01:52:22,839 --> 01:52:23,828
No one else comes in or goes out.

1352
01:52:23,907 --> 01:52:25,636
l am very clear on that. Start.

1353
01:52:26,943 --> 01:52:28,240
Okay, Anuradha, you step out...

1354
01:52:28,478 --> 01:52:29,638
...let the cameraman stay in, and...

1355
01:52:29,713 --> 01:52:31,908
...you come in only to give
your cues during the ad breaks.

1356
01:52:31,981 --> 01:52:32,811
Alright?

1357
01:52:32,916 --> 01:52:33,507
Alright?

1358
01:52:33,583 --> 01:52:35,676
Excuse me. Where is she going?

1359
01:52:36,553 --> 01:52:37,986
To the control room, sir.

1360
01:52:38,555 --> 01:52:41,149
How many people in the control room?
- 10 12...

1361
01:52:41,257 --> 01:52:42,747
10 or 12? Please tell me.

1362
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,584
12 l think, sir.

1363
01:52:44,728 --> 01:52:45,888
Do you know their names?

1364
01:52:46,229 --> 01:52:47,787
Why would l know their names?

1365
01:52:47,864 --> 01:52:49,661
They are interns, technical staff...

1366
01:52:49,733 --> 01:52:51,826
lf you don't know their names,
then who does?

1367
01:52:52,802 --> 01:52:53,860
This is not safe.

1368
01:52:54,704 --> 01:52:55,830
There's no security here.

1369
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:58,036
But, sir, this is a news channel.

1370
01:52:58,141 --> 01:53:00,006
Why would anyone do anything here?

1371
01:53:00,076 --> 01:53:02,772
lncidents happen where
people least expect it.

1372
01:53:02,846 --> 01:53:03,778
You know that.

1373
01:53:04,047 --> 01:53:05,105
This interview continues at my home.

1374
01:53:05,815 --> 01:53:07,510
l am sorry,
sir, but this is a debate.

1375
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,846
You please can't...

1376
01:53:08,918 --> 01:53:10,249
To hell with your debate.

1377
01:53:10,653 --> 01:53:12,018
But, sir...please, sir.

1378
01:53:12,088 --> 01:53:12,884
Sir...

1379
01:53:38,648 --> 01:53:39,580
Let's go, sir.

1380
01:53:39,883 --> 01:53:41,680
What are so many people doing here?

1381
01:53:42,519 --> 01:53:44,282
lt's the inauguration of a club...

1382
01:53:44,354 --> 01:53:45,480
...there's bound to be people here.

1383
01:53:45,989 --> 01:53:47,513
Let's go home. Come on.

1384
01:53:47,724 --> 01:53:49,419
Sir...what are you doing?

1385
01:53:50,326 --> 01:53:51,588
People are waiting for you.

1386
01:53:51,961 --> 01:53:53,826
l promised the organizer as well.

1387
01:53:53,897 --> 01:53:56,661
ln fact, he donated a large
amount for our party fund.

1388
01:53:56,733 --> 01:53:59,361
Do you want to donate
my life forthat?

1389
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:02,735
Tell me...what do you know?

1390
01:54:03,072 --> 01:54:05,040
What do you know? - About what, sir?

1391
01:54:05,442 --> 01:54:06,534
About her.

1392
01:54:07,076 --> 01:54:08,373
She's waiting for me right here.

1393
01:54:08,445 --> 01:54:09,070
You know that, don't you?

1394
01:54:09,345 --> 01:54:10,972
She'll hide in this
crowd and kill me.

1395
01:54:11,047 --> 01:54:12,014
That's your plan, isn't it?

1396
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:13,878
What are you saying, sir? - Get out.

1397
01:54:13,983 --> 01:54:16,281
Out. Get out you f*** idiot.

1398
01:54:16,586 --> 01:54:17,610
Take me home quickly.

1399
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,085
Out! Out!

1400
01:54:19,556 --> 01:54:20,420
Out!

1401
01:54:40,844 --> 01:54:41,902
No...it'll be done.

1402
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,642
l'll do something.

1403
01:54:45,648 --> 01:54:46,580
l'll do something.

1404
01:54:48,351 --> 01:54:51,650
lt'll be done...there
will be no problem.

1405
01:55:02,599 --> 01:55:03,998
You're back soon.

1406
01:55:04,701 --> 01:55:07,329
Shall l serve dinner?
- l am not hungry.

1407
01:55:07,837 --> 01:55:11,398
Eat something, just a little...
- l said l'm not hungry.

1408
01:55:11,641 --> 01:55:12,471
Stop blabbering.

1409
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:23,615
You look tired, l'll get you milk.

1410
01:55:24,554 --> 01:55:25,612
You'll sleep peacefully.

1411
01:55:45,575 --> 01:55:46,599
Who was he talking to?

1412
01:55:47,410 --> 01:55:48,570
Was he...

1413
01:55:49,546 --> 01:55:52,276
l'll call him inside and ask.

1414
01:55:52,582 --> 01:55:53,378
Milk!

1415
01:56:02,058 --> 01:56:03,685
You...

1416
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:04,792
Looking for your gun?

1417
01:56:06,329 --> 01:56:07,353
l got rid of it.

1418
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:12,801
Always get rid of
things we don't need...

1419
01:56:12,869 --> 01:56:14,336
...you taught me this.

1420
01:56:17,106 --> 01:56:18,698
Wedding vows don't make you...

1421
01:56:19,142 --> 01:56:22,270
...a virtuous husband Mandar Mhatre.

1422
01:56:25,248 --> 01:56:29,446
lf you want to be revered,
then you need to act accordingly.

1423
01:57:01,718 --> 01:57:02,844
Father used to say...

1424
01:57:04,454 --> 01:57:06,217
...affection in eyes of the wife...

1425
01:57:07,423 --> 01:57:11,792
...and weapon in the hand
of the lover, are only for pretence.

1426
01:57:12,795 --> 01:57:14,319
Come on, give me the gun.

1427
01:57:15,665 --> 01:57:16,654
Come.

1428
01:57:17,867 --> 01:57:19,698
Let's reshuffle all the pawns...

1429
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:22,328
...and restart the game.

1430
01:57:23,673 --> 01:57:24,935
Give it. Give me the gun.

1431
01:57:27,276 --> 01:57:28,208
Give me the gun.

1432
01:58:01,544 --> 01:58:02,943
Mad dogs...

1433
01:58:05,948 --> 01:58:07,540
...and crazy elephants...

1434
01:58:10,253 --> 01:58:12,847
...are meant to be shot down.

1435
01:58:15,591 --> 01:58:18,617
l wish yourfather
had taught you that.

1436
01:59:08,111 --> 01:59:09,806
My parents died when l was a kid.

1437
01:59:10,713 --> 01:59:12,180
My grandma used to live here.

1438
01:59:13,216 --> 01:59:14,581
But after she passed away...

1439
01:59:15,284 --> 01:59:16,410
...this house has remained locked.

1440
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,654
And no one will imagine that...

1441
01:59:20,523 --> 01:59:21,922
...you're hiding in
a police officer's house...

1442
01:59:22,625 --> 01:59:23,592
...who is looking for you.

1443
01:59:28,564 --> 01:59:29,531
Thank you.

1444
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,324
Since l became a police officer...

1445
01:59:32,668 --> 01:59:34,932
...this is the first
time l felt l did my duty.

1446
01:59:36,472 --> 01:59:38,736
Anyway, don't step
out of the house too much...

1447
01:59:38,808 --> 01:59:42,574
...and if anyone asks, then
just say you're my sister Veronica.

1448
01:59:44,814 --> 01:59:45,678
Thank you.

1449
01:59:45,848 --> 01:59:46,837
Take care, Sonica.

1450
01:59:47,483 --> 01:59:48,279
Bye.

1451
01:59:53,556 --> 01:59:56,684
When he came home he looked worried.

1452
01:59:58,728 --> 02:00:03,722
When l asked whether
he'll have dinner, he refused.

1453
02:00:05,868 --> 02:00:09,463
l went to my daughter's
room to tuck her in.

1454
02:00:12,375 --> 02:00:13,364
And that's when...

1455
02:00:15,344 --> 02:00:16,743
That's when l heard the gunfire.

1456
02:00:18,781 --> 02:00:20,681
l ran to her room and...

1457
02:00:34,697 --> 02:00:35,823
You took your revenge.

1458
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,627
Finished your battle against God?

1459
02:00:42,672 --> 02:00:44,299
Sonica, you should
now go to a hospital...

1460
02:00:44,407 --> 02:00:45,772
...and get yourself treated.

1461
02:00:47,577 --> 02:00:51,343
Because...you can't live like this.

1462
02:00:52,014 --> 02:00:53,572
Everyone has to die someday, Akshay.

1463
02:00:53,683 --> 02:00:55,014
Sonica, don't argue.

1464
02:00:58,020 --> 02:00:59,749
Please, don't argue, Akshay.

1465
02:01:01,724 --> 02:01:03,351
lf l get myself treated...

1466
02:01:04,827 --> 02:01:06,658
...then l'll stop seeing you.

1467
02:01:08,798 --> 02:01:10,561
lf what's the point of living...

1468
02:01:12,835 --> 02:01:14,393
...if l can't see you.

1469
02:01:14,503 --> 02:01:16,494
But, Sonica... - Akshay, please.

1470
02:01:17,907 --> 02:01:19,431
Stop saying such things.

1471
02:01:20,910 --> 02:01:23,504
l'd rather die seeing yourface...

1472
02:01:26,315 --> 02:01:27,782
...than live without you.

1473
02:01:30,052 --> 02:01:30,848
Akshay...

1474
02:01:33,823 --> 02:01:35,017
...say those things again.

1475
02:01:37,593 --> 02:01:38,560
Which one?

1476
02:01:38,828 --> 02:01:39,954
About us.

02:01:40,429 --> 02:01:45,560

02:02:38,888 --> 02:02:44,326
''Like a leaf falls carelessly.''

1485
02:02:45,494 --> 02:02:49,988
''l want to shatter and
be one again in your arms.''

1486
02:02:50,599 --> 02:02:54,091
