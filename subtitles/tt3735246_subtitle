In front of us is a very big problem

10
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:58,444

16
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:16,188
Now the court is just a sword

17
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:18,212
... That the kingdom Marathi

18
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,236
And was an official dignitary protection

What to ridicule? It is only you who have mocked

23
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,072
Everyone has the ability to defend Khoisan

Nothing could movements monkey, eagle eyes, and his sword Rghabt Bajyrayv

28
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:20,992
! At any time is lethal

29
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,016
... I Bajyrayv Balal

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Balal boy Jay Vyshvanat

31
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,064
... I got it and as Secretary of War

32
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,088
And behind each test'm ready for this responsibility

33
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,112
...... Try to be Bajyrayv

34
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:37,136
... But we decided not

35
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,660
But their archery

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,040
The peacock feather on the ground at this time
... Are therefore not with sword

37
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,064
! But with bows must make two parts

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
For control of the country by taking Shastri
Must think like Shastri
(Shastri holy book of Hindus)

39
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:07,104
Now the movements of the monkey and eagle eyes saw penetration

40
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
King?

41
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,044
The condition was that peacock feathers to become Dvtykh

42
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,568
..and All court observed

43
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
And peacock feathers remain, as before

44
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:05,544
But shorter than before

00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:08,568
Check the soil with half there

He was Indian territory, and the reign of Mughal peacock feathers in
Delhi haunts

Women like you are afraid of beauty
And realize that I do not have any pride

01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:24,096
Your neck is so valuable

But it is too thin pearl necklace Torre

At any time is lethal

617

How fear of offending acquaintances?

929
01:30:48,184 --> 01:30:50,184
Rao came to pray for my son

930
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:53,208
Scam blessing or a relationship you beg?

01:30:54,232 --> 01:30:56,232
In the absence of Rao, brought me a souvenir for kids

Rector's welcome families but saffron-colored fabric work properly
This was why the green cloth?
(Muslims was green so flouted by)

933
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:09,880
It is true that every religion has but one chosen color
! There is no religion for colors

934
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:13,040
Yeah, sometimes into the heart of someone who was so black and dark

935
01:31:13,064 --> 01:31:15,064
The color was also religion

936
01:31:16,088 --> 01:31:20,088
Cheema J., with whom do you speak?
This difference between the port and the goddess Durga Mslmvna forgotten

937
01:31:20,112 --> 01:31:26,112
And maybe you forgot that once decorated the statue of Goddess Durga
Green clothing, green scarf, green bangles used

01:31:27,136 --> 01:31:34,136
In rich and poor port grave saffron tent Myzarnd
! Then I would not worry about colors

939
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:40,160
Rao took your hand and then your tongue like a sword

940
01:31:40,784 --> 01:31:42,784
! My warrior

941
01:31:43,008 --> 01:31:46,008
Even if the slip by rock fall, then

... Kryshnajy Bhatt

943
01:31:48,056 --> 01:31:52,056
! He did this at the beginning of Ptrbkhsh to send

944
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,080

945
01:31:55,104 --> 01:31:56,604

951
01:32:56,032 --> 01:32:59,032
His name is not that Rag·hv
I am talking about Krishna

952
01:32:59,356 --> 01:33:00,856
He did my son

953
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,880
I'm sorry, I can not give such an order -
Why -

954
01:33:04,504 --> 01:33:09,504
Shastri's written in every religion
The father, the son is the same religion, I am wrong?

955
01:33:09,528 --> 01:33:11,528
! No, no, how could you say wrong

956
01:33:12,052 --> 01:33:17,052
But it obligatory for marriage
Father and mother to Hindu principles do not

01:33:17,576 --> 01:33:21,576
Well, OK
! After the formalities do I'm ready to marry again Mastan

01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,600
Then for no other reason, no?

959
01:33:24,624 --> 01:33:26,624
Does not matter -
What? -

960
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:28,648
You child Krishna before Marriage

01:33:30,696 --> 01:33:32,596
! Loot is
True or not?

963
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:36,220
This way of thinking is illegitimate, Krishna Bhatt

964
01:33:38,044 --> 01:33:40,044
Do not forget the all important religious leader Torre

965
01:33:41,068 --> 01:33:42,568
! Even more important for you

966
01:33:42,592 --> 01:33:44,192

And we accept it?

968

What you accept and what not to do, for I do not care

Cheema Hey, Jay, you were like Nkhvaht

What is the reason for the sudden sweetness?

981
01:34:30,444 --> 01:34:34,444
Put my name, name of Krishna

01:34:35,068 --> 01:34:39,068
What did you face? -

983
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,120
! Ethnic Muslim leader

984
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,440
! Get out, get out, all

985
01:34:57,064 --> 01:35:00,064
! Pantheism? This figure Look

! Can you do that Rao
This has never been leader

989
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,160
! And then you think that starting today

990
01:35:20,184 --> 01:35:24,184
Why pantheism? -
Why worry about something that is yours? -

991
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:25,708
You wont notice pantheistic

992
01:35:27,032 --> 01:35:32,032
Despite being alive when I got drunkards out of the Emirates
God knows what I would die after

993
01:35:33,056 --> 01:35:36,056
Should be inspired about the future of my family, is not it?

994
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,080
Today two of bespoke and tomorrow all leadership
The handing you?

995
01:35:39,104 --> 01:35:42,104
! Can someone so unreasonable to forgiveness

996
01:35:42,128 --> 01:35:45,128
The reason you can hold in the Emirate of dancers?

997
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:47,652
We think that's -
Really? Say, what's the idea? -

998
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:53,076
! Daggers Qlaf, the home to keep your wife, and later the illegitimate child

999
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Unfortunately the sign was wrong geerite

Should respect that in the meantime
Thus, we are cut off

1003
01:36:21,112 --> 01:36:23,112
! Sometimes this relationship the man's breathing was

1004
01:36:25,136 --> 01:36:26,136
Now Go

Once thought that was what happened to the shadows?

First you were standing
But the sword still strong

That's why we came to you

1247

Victory in this war is very important leader -
I'm not a leader -

1248
02:01:54,096 --> 02:01:57,596
But the leader you are -
I am not my commander -

When you can learn horse riding
I'm with you Mytazvndm

This is easily said ....

1256
02:02:29,068 --> 02:02:31,568
That's not the commander?

1257
02:02:34,092 --> 02:02:39,092
You know my heart Mastan stolen
But Nfs·ham called home

That should open up our Mastan, you hear?

1393

02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:38,540
The day when the sky was changing color

1443
02:27:38,564 --> 02:27:42,564
Was distributed to all four sides of saffron color

1444
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:06,080
