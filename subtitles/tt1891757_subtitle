1
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,365
For God Sake!
Please listen to me,

2
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,532
Stop being stubborn,

3
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,538
Many bad things are not getting over
in our society,

4
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,412
because we don't speak.

5
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,113
We kept silence,

6
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,453
Sometimes for our respect and

7
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,448
sometimes for someone
else respect.

8
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,926
To hear your story if any single
house will be change,

9
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,467
then many girl's lives will be better,

10
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,468
And Imagine...

11
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,995
If some thousand house will
be change,

12
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,433
then it will be huge achievement.

13
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,960
Sir! A woman got a death sentence,

14
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,471
her forgiveness appeal.

15
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,552
In the condition of rejection of appeal
she have a wish...

16
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,692
Why did she came to me?
It's a strange wish.

17
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,996
And only you can give her
the permission,

18
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,937
That girl wants that standing
on the place of death sentence,

19
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,196
and get recorded her story
to TV channels.

20
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,873
She probably thinks that it will be
great impact in her story,

21
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,847
Isn't it any political motive?
I don't think so.

22
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,146
She is from the religious family,

23
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,232
Must get a recording copy,

24
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,658
Throw it away

25
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,292
And make your lives by your selves.

26
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,006
Assume it my last wish,

27
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:39,477
My name is Suleiman Dogar
and I am a Jailor.

28
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,786
This jail is my territory,

29
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,756
Cut off time is 4.

30
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,760
Story will be on any stage at cut off
time I will stop it,

31
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,793
And you will have to leave this place
on few seconds notice,

32
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,496
In any condition,

33
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,429
Otherwise your cameras are
very sensitive,

34
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,904
and my guard's sticks are
very strong.

35
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:21,326
In your opinion why did
I called you here.

36
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,230
In my opinion you want to confess
your sins and want to teach

37
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,771
lesson to others.

38
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:34,932
Really?

39
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,136
Some other reason?

40
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,811
You wanted to tell us that
you are innocent,

41
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,314
I am not innocent,

42
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,250
I really committed a murder,

43
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,044
But I am only a murderer.

44
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,814
Not a sinner,
Murderer is not a sinner?

45
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,155
It's not necessary,

46
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,924
Court made me sinner

47
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,859
because I didn't defend myself.

48
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,132
When you didn't open your mouth
in court then why now?

49
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,835
If I would talk in court then
they will think...

50
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,307
I am lying to save my life.

51
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,811
I don't have much time and
story is too long.

52
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,578
That's why I begin my story,

53
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,012
When India got partition,

54
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,364
but one of them I mean
My Grandfather,

55
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,835
Hakim Syed Hashmatullah feel
Lahore is like Delhi...

56
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,449
that's why he lived here.

57
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,976
My father's income getting less.

58
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,140
But kids are getting increased.

59
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,988
My mom born 14 kids.

60
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,385
Come with me at shop.
I want to talk to you.

61
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,982
You go to shop.

62
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,038
That kid...

63
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,970
Looks fine but...
But what?

64
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,408
But he is not normal.

65
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,054
He looks like a boy.

66
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,716
But he is not a boy.

67
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,357
You don't worry at all.

68
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,324
What kind of examination is that.

69
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,368
After so many daughters...

70
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,048
How did you think about that?

71
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,177
Why don't you understand that what
is the mean of keep him alive?

72
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,083
Do you have any idea?

73
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,087
When he will grow up then
what will he become,

74
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,228
and what people will say,

75
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,226
When people will know then...

76
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,102
We will announce that he is
under devil's shadow,

77
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,138
and we won't let him go out
from the house,

78
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,200
We will assume him our daughter and
we won't send him to school.

79
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,272
Then what's your problem?
How long you will do it all?

80
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,044
Entire life,
I will do it for my entire life,

81
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,051
But I can't even think about it what
you want to do.

82
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,348
You are such a cruel man,

83
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,598
You should better give me
another daughter,

84
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:36,165
I am dying to thinking about that
I didn't get rid of that,

85
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,234
Your son's wish will still alive,

86
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,759
Hakim Sahib didn't come yet?
He is just coming.

87
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,277
You just go outside,

88
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,195
Is everything alright?

89
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,159
I think Allah has send help in
that kid's face,

90
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,400
That Sheema is standing outside,

91
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:57,280
We have found that angels gave you
our belonging by mistake,

92
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,921
Nobody has known yet,

93
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,322
Why did you bring her here?
She is not asking for free,

94
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,626
She will give you money for that,
If you both will ever come here again

95
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,862
then I will kill both of you,

96
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,867
He is not good for you and
I am giving you money today,

97
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,972
Dad's hatred was like with him

98
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,911
that he refused to keep his name,

99
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,911
He said why did he need name,
He don't have to go to school.

100
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:05,251
We kept his name Saif,
what become Saifi,

101
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,352
Dad's fear was always in our house,

102
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:15,891
but when Saifi grown up he has seen
hatred in his eyes for him,

103
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:20,736
that's why when dad came to house he
get hide in a room,

104
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,814
Saifi! Come out and tell him
to go from here,

105
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,644
Only family members kiss on chick,

106
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,379
If someone else do then
it's a cheap thing,

107
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,351
Do you understand?

108
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,787
It's been so long you didn't make
any picture.

109
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,467
Make it today...

110
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,920
After few years I got married.

111
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,721
To see lot of daughters...

112
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,294
My father agreed with the
first proposal.

113
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,838
I have decided.

114
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,713
Until my family condition didn't
get well.

115
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,115
Until I won't born a baby.

116
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:40,655
Fights getting increasing.

117
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,922
Finally I have to leave
my husband house.

118
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,630
When I came back to my
father's house then.

119
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,168
My sisters were also getting young
along with Saifi.

120
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,883
I am going to Pak Patan on
Saturday,

121
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,759
Give me some money,

122
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,627
I will do something,

123
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,851
And your income is getting
less day by day.

124
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,722
What will happen?

125
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,884
Trust to God.

126
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,416
This is not good Saifi.

127
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,390
You are grown up not eat
by your self.

128
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,070
If you feel bad then I will
eat by myself.

129
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,795
Go to roof and have some fun.

130
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,183
Where is your mom?
She is coming.

131
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,979
Where you have been all day long?
I was late in college.

132
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,961
Come!

133
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,594
You came late...

134
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,399
Without your permission,

135
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,303
I gave you a responsibility.

136
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,477
And I hope you will
not refuse me.

137
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,977
We have announced Mosque committee,

138
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,616
Mr. Sheikh is the chairman,

139
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:43,217
and we can't find for cashier
better than you,

140
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,958
As a Chairman Sheikh has begin
from 50,000.

141
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:53,596
You keep it,

142
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,105
Finish your fair,

143
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,342
Police is coming,

144
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,184
Except my dad...

145
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:18,155
we all like Master's family.

146
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,056
His wife was my mom's only friend,

147
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,499
His family was like an
example for us,

148
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,035
After Master's poor income...

149
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,003
his both sons were medical student,

150
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,397
Shall I break your hands,

151
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,838
Put your hand on it and take a swear,

152
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,114
You haven't done anything with
your self.

153
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,582
What do you mean?

154
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,281
Why no kid is getting birth in our
house since many years.

155
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,760
You are still young,

156
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,224
Will you tell me something or
may I slap on your face,

157
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,333
I have your answer,

158
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,342
Why did you close the door?

159
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,241
Because what I want to tell
you today,

160
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,185
what might be some daughter would
have said to her father,

161
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,583
In fact mom should have said it,

162
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,616
but she can't say anything with
your fear,

163
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,220
You talk allot, You tell me,

164
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:53,303
I got mom's operation to stop
the population of this house,

165
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,807
What have you done?

166
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:02,344
Do you know you have commit
such a big sin,

167
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,778
Only Allah gave the life,
Yes, He is...

168
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,952
but it doesn't mean what you think,

169
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,895
It means he gave us capability to
born lives,

170
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:25,325
How many kids Hakim Shifat have to
born and how many Master Akhtar have to

171
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,600
Allah didn't make saints to write that,

172
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,277
Why don't you understand?

173
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,440
As much we will have mouths we
will need more food as well.

174
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:44,947
And why don't you understand he took
the responsibility to give food,

175
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,524
Then I am sure saints have
our wrong address.

176
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,826
Because food is not coming here,

177
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,766
So many people are dying with hunger
they all are dying because...

178
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,368
Allah is not fulfilling his
responsibilities.

179
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,544
Now you will tell me Allah's opinion,

180
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,680
His prophet didn't tell us,

181
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,587
that His Ummah should be greater than
everyone on Armageddon,

182
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,394
How our prophet can say that?

183
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,837
He must have said that my Ummah
will be greater than everyone,

184
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,637
but it must be greater in respect
and progress.

185
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,708
How he could say rather they are fools
but they must be bigger in quantity

186
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,610
Rather they are dying with hunger but
they must be bigger in quantity.

187
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,297
Look at mom,
What you have turned her into?

188
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,327
I wish I would be God, I would
make every man to born a child.

189
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,870
So you people should know,

190
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,832
Within a year we will establish
this Madrasa.

191
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,498
You open the door on right time,

192
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,409
I am in hurry today,
Durani's hearing today,

193
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:55,449
I got more 40,000 fund,
You keep this money,

194
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,014
Have some tea...
I will be late.

195
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,498
I have requested you many times,

196
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,534
that now you give the fund's
responsibility to someone else.

197
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:20,901
I always told you every time that
Sheikh has gone to England,

198
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,879
When he will come then
he will decide it,

199
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,776
Why you always heard before me?

200
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,705
I think you like to being guard.

201
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,426
Come! Nothing will happen,
Are you mad? Somebody will see.

202
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:23,171
I have decide one thing,
you should sing with me in concert,

203
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,440
Some crazy can think about it,

204
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,607
Fine! This crazy has decided,
I will must take you along,

205
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,649
Sure!
I am telling the truth.

206
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,787
If we will make our own album,

207
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:42,648
then we can make disasters,
I don't want more disasters,

208
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,065
And disaster will come when
my dad will know,

209
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,608
When I will become a doctor
next year,

210
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,010
and after becoming my wife,
after becoming a singer,

211
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,011
you will be a celebrity.

212
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,845
What I would be?
You will be famous,

213
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:12,686
Shall we start?

214
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,843
What should I tell you?
You can't even imagine,

215
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,439
what kind of places are in Lahore,

216
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,718
Mustafa was saying he didn't show
me the entire Lahore,

217
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,254
I don't know when we will
see all these things,

218
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,084
I saw a moon in Anarkali Market,

219
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,788
Mustafa spend lot of money,

220
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,942
He tore this page from Mustafa's
magazine and made it,

221
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,746
you are worried about the magazine,

222
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,719
You just have a look he made
such an amazing thing,

223
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,753
I wish we could send him to
some drawing school.

224
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,820
She was praying that Tendulkar
should make a century,

225
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:50,032
She is lying, Am I lying?

226
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,440
And tell what you die for Afridi,
Enough!

227
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:12,253
When I will come back I want all
of you to pray,

228
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,301
Do you have any idea what
you have done,

229
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,033
In such house where we are not allowed
for anything but to breathe.

230
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,902
What your nonsense will bring,

231
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,074
She started that,

232
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,344
You made us lost,

233
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,982
If you would pray from heart
then we would win,

234
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,982
It's also possible our team didn't
play well, Shut up!

235
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,523
You are right,

236
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,592
What we think about prayers?

237
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,869
Entire Pakistan prays but we
always lose the match,

238
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,334
And those Australian people...

239
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,445
They are winning from 20 years
without prayers,

240
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,148
I am telling you to make her shut up.

241
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,659
I will raise my hand again.

242
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:02,091
Not from your hand but impress me
with your opinions,

243
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:09,629
What do you think?

244
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,099
Allah decides...

245
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,378
that how many runs Inzamam
have to make today,

246
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:25,014
Entire Pakistan is disturbing Allah,
and entire India is disturbing to God.

247
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,048
They don't understand,

248
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,192
If their Goddess will make them win
then why did they lose.

249
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,118
Nor we understand...

250
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:37,526
If Allah have to make us win then why
would he take 17 years to make us win.

251
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,071
What are you looking at me?
Your sister will be jealous,

252
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,771
Aashi praised for your drawing,
that's why I got you this,

253
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,365
Tell us if you have any demand,

254
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,772
First thing is that my daughters are
not burden on me,

255
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,638
and we are not from some
ordinary family,

256
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,452
I must have few conditions,

257
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:47,056
First condition is that guy must
be religious,

258
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:53,394
and second he must be Syed
and from Sunni.

259
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:07,841
What have you done?

260
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,218
How am I looks like?

261
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,625
How many times I told you?

262
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,324
You are a man and be like a man,
what happen?

263
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,099
What is this?

264
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,267
I felt to see how am I looks like?

265
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,212
Does men do it?

266
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,708
You are not a girl.
I am a girl.

267
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,350
If I am not a girl.

268
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:47,823
Then why do I like Mustafa,

269
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,429
I also want to marry with him,

270
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,430
Don't you ashamed,
I will tell to dad.

271
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:06,503
Don't tell him,
I will never do it again,

272
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,282
What will happen with him?

273
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,827
If he will go out,

274
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,798
and what will happen if he
won't go out,

275
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,224
You are not thinking about that,

276
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:34,769
And your dad...

277
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,673
He won't even find out if he won't
see Saifi from a week,

278
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,876
And if he will know then
let him know,

279
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,347
at this time it's most important to
save Saifi from disaster.

280
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,717
But he is very naive,

281
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,413
What will he do?
I have decide it,

282
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,756
I know a place.

283
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,419
It's far away but his drawing
will be helpful there.

284
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,264
I will take him along in morning,

285
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,343
Long time no see.

286
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,845
I have come for a job,

287
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,318
This kid is my cousin,
I want you to teach him,

288
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,885
His drawing is very good,
Fine, but sit first.

289
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,603
Bring some tea.

290
00:51:54,511 --> 00:52:00,006
What's your name?
Syed Saif.

291
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,950
With it's tip...

292
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,524
draw that truck on floor.

293
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,778
He is passed before drawing,

294
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,473
His style is telling me that
he is good.

295
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,779
They also live here,

296
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,778
He is good from heart.

297
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:13,013
I didn't want to bring him here
because of these guys,

298
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,024
But he don't know anything else
except drawing,

299
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,462
I must have to bring him here,
You have to be careful about him,

300
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,780
Go and sit over there.

301
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,043
If he didn't learn from anywhere
then it's amazing,

302
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,456
I will give him 100 rupees daily.

303
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,203
Work hard!

304
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,606
I will come in evening to
pick you up.

305
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,030
I am sorry,

306
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,171
Hold the brush properly,

307
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,239
Come I will teach you.

308
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,654
You son of a bitch!
Won't you listen,

309
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,665
Get lost from here,

310
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,330
Get your clothes,

311
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,671
Shameless people.

312
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,283
I have told you,
You have told me and you were right,

313
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,221
But our Saifi won't give up,

314
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:42,062
Today was his first day,
that's why he suffered allot,

315
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,773
It's today's earning,

316
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:09,817
When we will give your salary to dad
in the end of month he will be happy,

317
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,691
He will love you more than us,

318
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,697
Feed him some milk,

319
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,920
Come and sit!
I was missing you,

320
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,689
Our truck is ready,
I will leave tonight,

321
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,766
I will be back after month,
Where is Master?

322
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:58,935
He is changing the clothes,
I will be back after changing clothes.

323
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,870
Such a hot item,

324
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,877
Can I come?

325
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,731
How is your wife?
Don't ask about her,

326
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,910
My wife is your fan now,

327
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,413
She sent this sweet for you,
Make medicine for one more week,

328
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:58,857
I think Murad is on vacation,
He is on long vacation,

329
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,234
I couldn't manage his salary,

330
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,404
So I removed him,

331
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,955
Nobody can doubt on
your qualities,

332
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,859
then why your business is not
running well.

333
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:28,254
Every man is running behind doctors.

334
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,937
If you don't mind,

335
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,904
then I have an idea for you,

336
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:50,274
Our Moulvi has gone Saudi Arabia,

337
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,479
You teach Quran to our kids,

338
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,985
I will gather more kids,

339
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,557
We gave 500 for one kid,

340
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,057
You will make handsome amount,

341
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,369
I will must teach them,

342
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:12,239
but there must be some Moulvi
near your house,

343
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:17,378
There are many, But most of them,

344
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,982
are not ready to come our house,

345
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,893
We are musicians...

346
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:42,462
You can teach Urdu along
with Quran,

347
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:46,268
This medicine is for one week,
I am sure you won't need anymore.

348
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:04,187
My name is Ishaq but if you want
to ask someone,

349
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:10,262
then people call me Saaka Kanjar,

350
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,015
Don't go till an hour,

351
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,579
Now you also leave.

352
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,413
Pick it up,

353
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,689
Rasheed bhai! My clothes are inside,

354
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,195
and that's locked,

355
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,437
Your clothes are hanging up
on truck,

356
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,700
Go and change inside,

357
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:03,044
Few animals are inside but
you don't need to afraid,

358
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:17,286
My turn is first,
Shut up! Don't screw it up,

359
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,294
Saifi is free?
What do you mean? You didn't take him,

360
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,669
We thought he is gone,
He is not here from 30 minutes.

361
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,503
I think he is gone in bus,

362
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,272
How could he take bus?

363
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,344
Are you sure he is not here?
We didn't move from here,

364
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:56,088
And those fagots?
They didn't came back,

365
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:39,226
I wish your husband would have killed
you instead of leaving you,

366
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,880
He should be dead,

367
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,679
Mom! Saifi has come,

368
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,258
My beloved!
Come early tomorrow,

369
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,398
If you won't come then I will
be worried.

370
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,520
There must be few people there.

371
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,456
Why you didn't shout?

372
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:03,567
They have put cloth in my mouth,

373
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:17,350
Tara was saying I couldn't be
man forever,

374
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,384
as much I try to work,

375
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:27,427
Finally I will have to dance like them,
No!

376
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:31,055
I made a mistake,
I won't send you again,

377
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,527
What are you doing?
Leave him,

378
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:41,614
What happen Zainab?

379
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,363
It was necessary to do.

380
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,368
If he would be alive now,

381
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,814
then we would die everyday,

382
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,777
You didn't understand yet...

383
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:51,315
You believe Allah is a creator and you
hate his creativity,

384
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,696
Pig is also Allah's creation then say,

385
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,667
we should love pig.

386
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,967
He was uglier than pig.

387
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:09,936
At least pig have quality that he
born with pigs,

388
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:17,914
It was pig's fault that his family
wasn't pig.

389
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:24,318
If this pig would born in this house
one generation earlier than?

390
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,663
You go from here before I
become more angry,

391
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:44,898
I want to go to police station,

392
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:48,901
But because of his daughters...

393
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:52,777
I have stopped myself.

394
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,940
You are right, I think mom...

395
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,786
it will be a favor to them if we
should send Hakim into jail.

396
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,391
What are you saying?
He is their father,

397
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,318
Hakim! I am sorry to hear
about your son,

398
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,884
I am busy these days...

399
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,487
but I thought you live in
my area,

400
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:44,889
So it's my duty to come,
Thanks for coming,

401
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,890
I wanted to request you,

402
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:51,135
When you will be free then come
to police station for 5 minutes,

403
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:58,546
Don't worry!

404
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:12,090
It's a matter of one life,
I am sure this girl is innocent,

405
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,226
You please awake the president and
stop this death sentence,

406
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,295
What are you saying?

407
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:23,037
He is the president of this country,
How could I awake him at this time,

408
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:28,569
You try to understand my position,
You are a nice man,

409
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,444
I know you will find some solution,

410
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,006
I will call you back,

411
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,946
You are such a religious and
respected person,

412
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,908
I don't want to treat you like
a police officer,

413
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:22,358
I am sure you won't lie in
front of God,

414
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,102
How did your son died?

415
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,068
Please move this Holy Book
from my face,

416
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:37,909
Your doubt...

417
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,241
...is right.

418
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,082
Why did you have to do it?

419
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,359
Honor Killing...

420
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,626
is not an amazing thing for you,

421
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,934
Only daughters get killed for honor,

422
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:06,467
I wish...

423
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,507
he would be my daughter,

424
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,306
Now the situation is that...

425
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:18,981
after your confession we have
to post mortem your son,

426
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,692
Help me

427
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,092
My house is full of daughters,

428
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:40,106
What will happen with them?
You should have think about it earlier

429
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,100
You don't know where the
society is going,

430
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,514
For God Sake...

431
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:52,715
Please bury this thing here,

432
01:19:57,692 --> 01:19:59,250
but entire police station has known,

433
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,759
Tara who has reported he is
sitting outside,

434
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,725
How could I stop so many people.

435
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,197
Who can dare in front of you?

436
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,373
I will have to shut their mouths
with money,

437
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:19,773
It's a bribe,

438
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,152
but you decide...

439
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:32,757
My God knows I got loan for funeral.

440
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,397
I am putting my job in danger
to save your life.

441
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,076
Listen to me,

442
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:59,310
Money will be back but life
won't come back,

443
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:08,057
How much I will have to arrange?

444
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:17,263
You are a poor man,
Arrange Three hundred thousand.

445
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:21,131
But today!
I can't hold FIR till morning,

446
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,476
Last time, Two hundred thousand.

447
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:34,079
And assume your self under custody,
My men will be with you,

448
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,446
Whoever I ask...

449
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,157
he started telling me his problems,

450
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,634
I wish I would have kill her instead
of him,

451
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,708
Tell dad that pay the money
from Mosque funds.

452
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:35,548
He reformed God's mistake
to kill Saifi,

453
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,446
Allah will be happy from him,

454
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,162
This witch will send me to hell.

455
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,199
She is right,

456
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:56,227
When you will get some money keep
it back in funds,

457
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:59,563
Nobody will know,
It's Allah's belonging,

458
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,370
Nothing could hide from him,

459
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,608
Your problems are not hidden
from him,

460
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:27,561
If nothing will happen then we
will sell this house,

461
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,934
Why you didn't think about it earlier?

462
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:37,940
Now don't say anything,

463
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,459
I want to go Mr. Ishaq's house,

464
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:34,352
Wake up and look!
Indian currency has arrived,

465
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,467
Where it is?
Look over there,

466
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:58,442
Sit here!

467
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:26,912
You told me to teach Quran
to your kids,

468
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:31,451
I did.

469
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:36,017
But later I found that you
are Sunni,

470
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:52,769
You are right,

471
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,474
But we can say something,

472
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,012
I am helpless.

473
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:05,483
I promise you that I will
control my tongue,

474
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:33,204
Yourjob is done,

475
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,785
What about the timings?
Afternoon,

476
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:42,547
and before evening,
Why not in morning?

477
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:51,027
We slept in morning after working
all night long,

478
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:54,725
We woke up in afternoon,

479
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:58,536
You come at 5 and teach till 7.

480
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,242
If I will get salary in advance,

481
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:14,120
I couldn't go to bank today,

482
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,654
Otherwise I would give you
large notes.

483
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,759
2000 for 4 kids.

484
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,905
He promised to give food,

485
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:37,836
He didn't tell...

486
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:41,577
that how he will provide us,

487
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:52,591
I think all problems have seen
our house,

488
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,972
I got 2 more kids,

489
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:28,721
This place is different from your
house,

490
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:34,900
It looks like a nice place,

491
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:37,999
It's my meena's room.

492
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:47,309
She is my daughter.

493
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:14,844
We all are the followers
of one prophet.

494
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:18,079
This Shia and Sunni is just
a rubbish things,

495
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,010
Finish it all.

496
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:26,292
We want that you get your daughter
married with his son,

497
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,223
and become friends forever,

498
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,554
Look! Mr. Zafar.

499
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:33,124
I really respect you but I will
kill my daughter,

500
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,456
before it happens,

501
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:38,903
For this alias even nature is
giving you signs,

502
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:42,342
Look! Such a nice co-incidence,

503
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:45,376
His son's name is Mustafa,

504
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:48,115
and your daughter's name is Aaisha,

505
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:52,242
Such a nice Sunnah is fulfilling,

506
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:56,186
My three more daughter's names are
belong to Prophet's wives,

507
01:34:57,124 --> 01:34:59,615
Shall I give all of them to
his Mustafa,

508
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:06,194
Listen! You stupid Hakim,

509
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:11,665
Your Aaisha likes my Mustafa.

510
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:15,074
In my enmity,

511
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,569
don't break these kid's hearts.

512
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:25,281
I'll drop my all conditions,

513
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:29,355
Just find a nice guy who would be

514
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,987
ready to simply marry in Mosque.

515
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:40,364
I can't give dowry to my
daughter but...

516
01:35:42,369 --> 01:35:43,393
My daughter...

517
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:46,600
is good from her face.

518
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:53,112
Now I have only condition as soon
as possible...

519
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:54,980
it should be done,

520
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:57,244
Not in months...

521
01:35:58,686 --> 01:35:59,345
but in days.

522
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:02,521
Will you compromise for age?

523
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:07,388
He must be younger than me,

524
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:09,523
What are you saying?

525
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:12,099
She is a human being,

526
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:15,293
Not a mess that we will throw her
and somebody will pick up.

527
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:18,071
Look at her age,

528
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:20,497
You are about to make miss match,

529
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,271
It's not a miss match as well what
she wants to do.

530
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:27,037
Before she got some wrong step
like Saliha,

531
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,609
I should get her married, Enough!

532
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:31,140
I don't need argument,

533
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:34,179
Marriage is on Friday after Maghrib,

534
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:46,426
He born you,

535
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:49,499
He have right to decide,

536
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:53,569
He born humans not medicine bottles,

537
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:57,143
that he will give it to anyone.

538
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:00,070
I won't do it.

539
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:19,132
Gentlemen! I am requesting to
Committee Members...

540
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:22,035
that they should keep sited
after prayers,

541
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,661
We have stopped many decisions
for waiting Mr. Sheikh,

542
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:28,574
The biggest problem is
Hakim's problem,

543
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:31,675
You have told committee many times,

544
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:35,214
that you get the cashier responsibility
back from him,

545
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:38,149
Mr. Sheikh has...

546
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:42,051
agreed to take this responsibility,

547
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:47,617
That's why tomorrow after Namaz Asar
in our next meeting,

548
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:50,356
Hakim will bring all the accounts,

549
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:52,723
and he will present to committee,

550
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:57,294
This committee is thankful
to Hakim,

551
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:01,139
Now the second problem
is construction,

552
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:08,137
Wherever is was possible I asked
all of them last time,

553
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,509
Still 1.75 lacs...

554
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:17,481
you apologize to committee and
tell them truth,

555
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:19,318
Tell them you will pay them
in few days,

556
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:22,452
Kill me instead of giving me
this stupid idea,

557
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:28,729
My father served 32 years and I served
40 year...

558
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:32,098
then we got some respect in this city,

559
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,132
You want me to ruin all
these years,

560
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:41,643
What I am going to listen just
think about it,

561
01:38:43,183 --> 01:38:44,844
Tell them where you go to teach,

562
01:38:45,185 --> 01:38:47,676
Why would they will give me such
a huge amount,

563
01:38:50,891 --> 01:38:53,189
In return I should leave this witch
to their house,

564
01:38:54,295 --> 01:38:55,819
perhaps they will give me,

565
01:38:56,864 --> 01:38:58,388
They won't pay single penny for me,

566
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:03,269
If you make their packets then,
Shut up!

567
01:39:03,704 --> 01:39:07,572
For God Sake it's not a time for anger,
I am not telling him to beg,

568
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:10,437
They have enough money,

569
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:12,710
They can buy our house immediately,

570
01:39:13,547 --> 01:39:16,311
If they can't buy then put
on mortgage,

571
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:49,377
Hakim!
You are here on this time,

572
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:52,885
God! Please solve my
daughter's problem,

573
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:14,297
Zainab told me,

574
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,273
I don't understand what to do.

575
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:20,372
I don't know why this man
is so cruel.

576
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:25,415
I have a solution in my mind,

577
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:27,747
but I am afraid,

578
01:40:28,455 --> 01:40:29,717
If I will tell you...

579
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:32,257
then you might won't listen.

580
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:35,520
You just tell me.

581
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,234
Have your breakfast,

582
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:51,901
Money will be arrange,

583
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,316
It will be arrange?
Yes!

584
01:40:57,985 --> 01:40:59,384
I have one condition,

585
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:04,389
what you have told that's
all truth,

586
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:06,420
Why would I lie to you,

587
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:10,692
I really got some...
I am not talking about that,

588
01:41:11,932 --> 01:41:13,593
7 daughters?

589
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:16,661
Not a single son,

590
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:22,471
If you would be one of us,

591
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:26,711
then this time you will be
a millionaire,

592
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:30,408
I am such an unfortunate man,

593
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:35,287
God made a son's queue after
a single daughter,

594
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:38,549
After 5th son...

595
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,023
I have to stopped,

596
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:49,331
1.75 lacs is such a huge amount,

597
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:53,302
But my house worth's more
than that,

598
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:57,374
Look! I don't need your house,

599
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:00,345
I am coming to the point,

600
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:02,446
You...

601
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:05,681
will have to give me one daughter,
You...

602
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:09,855
Sit! I am not talking about that
what you thinking,

603
01:42:10,591 --> 01:42:12,855
God keep your daughter's respect,

604
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:15,520
I am not talking about them,

605
01:42:20,534 --> 01:42:22,798
Allah gave you such quality,

606
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:25,630
if this discussion will be
reveal here,

607
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:31,877
then other women will chop me
to achieve you,

608
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:34,444
I don't understand,

609
01:42:35,549 --> 01:42:36,607
Which quality?

610
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:41,682
You can born daughters...

611
01:42:42,589 --> 01:42:45,524
Man like you is like a diamond
for us,

612
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:50,928
Running bank account,
I don't understand.

613
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:53,959
Tell me clearly,

614
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:58,529
You have to born a daughter,

615
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:00,529
Specially for me,

616
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:07,513
you will be a father and my meena
will be mother,

617
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:13,577
I am giving you advance payment
for upcoming daughter,

618
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:16,080
What rubbish you are thinking about?

619
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:18,488
Who told you?

620
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:20,926
That it's in man's reach to born
daughters,

621
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:25,894
My business runs from daughters,

622
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:31,063
If we won't this thing then who
else will know it,

623
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:34,507
You Hakim and Moulvi people.

624
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:38,168
Refused every scientific method in
beginning,

625
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:44,779
It has been proved that son and
daughter born by men,

626
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:49,682
And woman can't do anything
about that,

627
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:55,427
you can confirm to any doctor.

628
01:43:57,497 --> 01:43:59,021
Suppose I am agree with you,

629
01:44:00,033 --> 01:44:01,557
then you tell me,

630
01:44:01,868 --> 01:44:04,200
if it will be son...
then you can keep it,

631
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:09,103
you will get a support for
your old age,

632
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:18,450
This is my dignity,

633
01:44:19,052 --> 01:44:22,579
Otherwise I could say that if son
will born,

634
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:25,049
then you will have to return
my money,

635
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:28,594
I didn't said it, It's a gamble,

636
01:44:29,796 --> 01:44:33,562
to see your record I feel to

637
01:44:34,568 --> 01:44:37,503
play this game, Just for a baby,

638
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:40,496
such a huge amount, One baby?

639
01:44:41,675 --> 01:44:43,666
From one baby with pretty face,

640
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:47,536
our generation gets changed,

641
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:50,844
As much money you are asking,

642
01:44:51,985 --> 01:44:54,180
it's just an amount of one
dance program,

643
01:44:57,691 --> 01:44:59,989
Take your decision under
banking hours,

644
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:06,555
How far the mosque from here?

645
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,902
It's two step ahead,

646
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:53,845
I am agreed,

647
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:56,774
But I have only one condition,

648
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:59,012
I don't know about your tradition,

649
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:01,913
but I will purely marry with her,

650
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:04,688
It's done,

651
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:07,587
Shall I arrange the money?

652
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:09,659
Yes!

653
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:14,996
You will have to swear on Quran,

654
01:46:15,836 --> 01:46:18,930
that nobody will ever find me
about,

655
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,654
I was looking for you,

656
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:14,791
Our women don't care about customers
age and faces,

657
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:18,654
But Meena is a different girl.

658
01:47:18,799 --> 01:47:21,700
I am afraid if she will see you
like this.

659
01:47:22,068 --> 01:47:24,798
She shouldn't refuse to get marry,
You are becoming groom,

660
01:47:25,705 --> 01:47:27,332
so you should looks like groom,

661
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:12,350
Why are you amazed?
Meena is a nice girl.

662
01:48:16,857 --> 01:48:19,690
We have a nice client Malik Sahib,

663
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:23,861
He already got booking,
She is with him,

664
01:48:25,432 --> 01:48:28,094
But she will take her dinner
with you.

665
01:48:30,103 --> 01:48:31,035
You take some rest.

666
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:10,874
I saw your foot,

667
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:13,312
They are very nice,

668
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:16,982
Don't put them on floor,
they will be dirty,

669
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:20,281
You?
Meena!

670
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:32,930
I am helpless it doesn't mean,

671
01:49:33,967 --> 01:49:34,991
that you will mock with me,

672
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:40,098
Why did you think that I am
mocking with you?

673
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:46,242
I am sure it's like that,

674
01:49:48,448 --> 01:49:51,315
In that accent you are speaking why
did it need here,

675
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:55,817
And what you said about my foot?

676
01:49:57,591 --> 01:50:00,958
I think you haven't seen Pakeezah,

677
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:04,455
Otherwise you would appreciate me,

678
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,398
Who is this Miss. Pakeezah?

679
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:11,230
It's a movie,
You didn't see that.

680
01:50:13,173 --> 01:50:14,401
I don't watch movies,

681
01:50:18,511 --> 01:50:20,502
I thought you must watch movies,

682
01:50:41,067 --> 01:50:42,432
You are getting confuse for nothing,

683
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,369
I think...

684
01:50:55,215 --> 01:50:57,479
that whore must be from Lacknow,

685
01:50:58,585 --> 01:51:01,281
otherwise she should born in
some decent family.

686
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:19,503
Now introduce your self.

687
01:51:22,242 --> 01:51:24,437
My name is Shafat Khan,

688
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:53,570
I will order some food,

689
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:06,509
Do you sleep in this Sherwani?

690
01:52:29,175 --> 01:52:33,202
He is also our family member like
you are now,

691
01:52:53,533 --> 01:52:56,161
Meena will sleep till afternoon,

692
01:53:06,012 --> 01:53:07,741
You should note down today's date,

693
01:53:09,682 --> 01:53:14,710
that day lot of sweet came to house
but Nisa didn't touched that,

694
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:18,513
I am scared that's why I don't like
to eat it.

695
01:53:18,691 --> 01:53:21,717
Think there must be one of us,

696
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:24,087
who will live her life happily.

697
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,462
What disaster will come here?

698
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:34,036
No disaster will come,

699
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:38,244
What will happen?
Here comes disaster.

700
01:54:11,144 --> 01:54:13,237
Now you tell me shall I bring
you stick or...

701
01:54:14,447 --> 01:54:15,812
Kerosene and some light,

702
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:19,081
Because I have made a big mistake,

703
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:22,749
but I think allot and did,

704
01:54:23,823 --> 01:54:28,453
And I am ready for any punishment,
What have you done now?

705
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:34,566
Because I didn't want that you do the
same with Aaisha what happened with me

706
01:54:37,437 --> 01:54:40,429
that's why I forced mom and...

707
01:54:46,646 --> 01:54:48,739
I got Aaisha's marriage with Mustafa.

708
01:55:01,327 --> 01:55:03,591
If she will die then you will
listen to me,

709
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:07,163
What kind of man you are?
You are putting extra pressure on me,

710
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:12,235
President don't forgive death sentence
on my proposal.

711
01:55:12,338 --> 01:55:15,330
Who is asking forgiveness?
I am saying stop it,

712
01:55:16,242 --> 01:55:19,109
I mean if case will re-open then I'm
sure she will get forgiveness,

713
01:55:19,512 --> 01:55:21,275
I know this girl is innocent,

714
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:04,751
you have been summoned,

715
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:11,422
It shouldn't happen tomorrow,

716
01:56:19,706 --> 01:56:22,766
That day for your feet,

717
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:24,671
I said beautiful words,

718
01:56:27,213 --> 01:56:31,547
but you didn't say a signal word
for me,

719
01:56:35,254 --> 01:56:37,313
My feet are not so good.

720
01:56:40,793 --> 01:56:44,388
Your foot is like when you walk,

721
01:56:45,531 --> 01:56:50,264
then slave's row should walk along to
put their palms under them,

722
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:03,205
It's another thing that you didn't
said from heart,

723
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,442
Why are you saying like that?

724
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:09,548
My feet are next to you,

725
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:13,486
but I don't know where are
your palms,

726
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:20,924
If these palms are permanently
available,

727
01:57:22,335 --> 01:57:24,428
then your feet will come
along with me,

728
01:57:25,605 --> 01:57:27,300
wherever I take them,

729
01:57:28,307 --> 01:57:30,241
You don't have to leave your
daughter here,

730
01:57:31,644 --> 01:57:33,578
that's why you want to take
me along,

731
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,814
But I am saying it all for you,

732
01:57:38,284 --> 01:57:41,412
I got married with you,
you are my respect,

733
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:44,482
Marriage was your only need,

734
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:47,553
otherwise there is no
tradition here,

735
01:57:54,033 --> 01:57:55,398
Is it possible for you?

736
01:57:57,403 --> 01:58:01,737
That you leave your family
and go somewhere,

737
01:58:03,443 --> 01:58:04,432
forever,

738
01:58:06,412 --> 01:58:08,744
They have no man except me,

739
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:12,942
who earns, and here...

740
01:58:14,053 --> 01:58:15,884
no woman is here except me,

741
01:58:17,957 --> 01:58:18,787
echo earns...

742
01:58:41,514 --> 01:58:42,606
You didn't answer me,

743
01:58:55,428 --> 01:58:56,452
They will do job,

744
01:58:58,664 --> 01:59:00,393
They will become an officer
in some office,

745
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:05,401
they will open their clinic or they
will become a minister,

746
01:59:05,938 --> 01:59:09,499
or ask that witch what she wants
to let them do,

747
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:14,774
What an illiterate girls will go
outside and do,

748
01:59:15,948 --> 01:59:16,972
do you have any idea?

749
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:40,872
We wanted to become your support.

750
01:59:42,108 --> 01:59:43,473
I am feeling pity on you,

751
01:59:44,443 --> 01:59:45,671
that you are so alone,

752
01:59:48,814 --> 01:59:50,782
How our house condition will change?

753
01:59:52,051 --> 01:59:53,985
That's why I needed a son,

754
01:59:55,154 --> 01:59:57,588
but all of witches keep coming,

755
02:00:00,593 --> 02:00:01,719
and who made this raw?

756
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:04,560
We didn't insist to born,

757
02:00:05,898 --> 02:00:07,058
You should stopped after 2 kids,

758
02:00:08,467 --> 02:00:09,559
You made this raw,

759
02:00:10,703 --> 02:00:12,068
and you are blaming to Allah,

760
02:00:33,826 --> 02:00:36,556
What are you saying?
I am right,

761
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:39,621
I can see a rebel in her eyes,

762
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:48,764
Rather I will kill her,

763
02:00:49,976 --> 02:00:51,000
or I will die,

764
02:00:53,713 --> 02:00:54,441
from her hands,

765
02:00:54,714 --> 02:00:56,944
Yes! I am sure you are
making excuses,

766
02:00:57,116 --> 02:00:59,744
Actually! You are afraid to awake
him at this time,

767
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:02,949
But I am telling you if you
won't awake him,

768
02:01:03,589 --> 02:01:08,083
then I will shout on my channel,
Are you threading me?

769
02:01:08,227 --> 02:01:09,489
Yes! I am threatening you.

770
02:01:10,563 --> 02:01:12,588
A person will die,

771
02:01:12,898 --> 02:01:15,196
and you are worried about President
of Pakistan's sleep.

772
02:01:15,635 --> 02:01:18,968
After all who he is?
He is a God! Okay!

773
02:01:20,573 --> 02:01:23,565
You don't get emotional,
I will do something,

774
02:01:30,516 --> 02:01:32,074
Mustafa become a doctor,

775
02:01:32,652 --> 02:01:36,486
then he and Aaisha brought many
gifts and sweets.

776
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:42,491
Entire family thinks like life
will start now.

777
02:01:52,738 --> 02:01:56,697
We have to steal little happiness.

778
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:59,778
And we have to lie to hide them,

779
02:02:00,579 --> 02:02:02,240
To hell with these media channels.

780
02:02:02,715 --> 02:02:06,674
Now journalists will decide who
is innocent,

781
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:13,850
You shouldn't awake for this
stupid thing,

782
02:02:23,302 --> 02:02:28,934
This girl didn't said a single word
in any court for her defense,

783
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:33,608
All witnesses were against her that's
why she got death sentence,

784
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:37,811
I don't know why this girl didn't
open her mouth in court,

785
02:02:38,684 --> 02:02:40,618
but my heart is saying that this
girl is innocent,

786
02:02:40,753 --> 02:02:43,654
Your heart says many things,

787
02:02:44,156 --> 02:02:45,088
but government...

788
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:47,626
doesn't run from your heart,

789
02:02:49,095 --> 02:02:51,697
You don't know what's going to
happen with you,

790
02:02:51,697 --> 02:02:54,962
When this recording will run on
TV and entire country will cry for her

791
02:02:55,201 --> 02:02:58,830
then I will shout and say that I tried
to save her till last time,

792
02:02:59,138 --> 02:03:03,074
but the president's sleep were
important than this innocent girl.

793
02:03:03,943 --> 02:03:06,878
This girl won't survive now but
you will also not save.

794
02:04:02,401 --> 02:04:05,734
Your debt is over now,
It's a baby,

795
02:04:08,407 --> 02:04:12,138
You are lucky,
just make a deal with me,

796
02:04:13,012 --> 02:04:15,810
I gave you 1.75 lacs for this girl.

797
02:04:16,315 --> 02:04:18,715
2.75 for next girl and

798
02:04:19,385 --> 02:04:20,818
3.75 for another next girl.

799
02:04:21,787 --> 02:04:26,815
You just keep giving me daughters and
I will increase lacs.

800
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,727
You go out,

801
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:36,788
Leave all the jobs.

802
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:57,440
Take me out from this situation,

803
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:02,909
She is my blood.

804
02:07:05,951 --> 02:07:09,079
For your late mother's sake.

805
02:07:12,858 --> 02:07:13,882
Give her to me,

806
02:07:15,194 --> 02:07:18,960
I will take her and go somewhere,

807
02:07:21,433 --> 02:07:23,424
Before they will know,

808
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:26,970
I will leave this city.

809
02:07:34,113 --> 02:07:37,014
We pimps are better than you.

810
02:07:38,317 --> 02:07:41,286
At least we fulfill our promises.

811
02:07:42,221 --> 02:07:44,553
You didn't think about your respect
when you were taking money,

812
02:07:45,924 --> 02:07:48,620
You can take my house in
return of your money.

813
02:07:52,131 --> 02:07:55,066
What pain she felt for nine months,

814
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:57,998
Who will pay for that?

815
02:08:09,982 --> 02:08:12,974
If I will ever see your face again,

816
02:08:13,419 --> 02:08:16,047
then I will bring your all
daughters here.

817
02:08:17,056 --> 02:08:19,251
And run them for Rs. 10.

818
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:27,097
It's been 3 days.

819
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:29,965
Dad wasn't eating something,

820
02:08:31,036 --> 02:08:32,560
nor he was talking to someone,

821
02:08:33,472 --> 02:08:35,531
The worst part was that...

822
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:39,139
He also missed his prayers.

823
02:08:41,046 --> 02:08:42,035
Finally...

824
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:44,239
this secret has revealed,

825
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:47,041
Mom! Some woman has come.

826
02:08:55,594 --> 02:08:58,427
Hakim is at home?
Yes, he is upstairs.

827
02:08:58,597 --> 02:09:01,088
Who are you?
I am Meena.

828
02:09:05,003 --> 02:09:07,164
Take this baby to Hakim,

829
02:09:11,744 --> 02:09:13,075
Where are you going?

830
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:20,108
Dad! Come out please.

831
02:09:24,523 --> 02:09:25,581
What's going on?

832
02:09:27,025 --> 02:09:29,152
Who is she?
I don't know.

833
02:09:29,561 --> 02:09:31,529
That woman gave her to me
and gone.

834
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:33,462
I kept stopping her but she
didn't listen.

835
02:09:36,535 --> 02:09:39,095
What's the matter?

836
02:09:40,305 --> 02:09:44,332
Some woman has come and she
left this baby,

837
02:09:46,378 --> 02:09:49,609
You go over there!
You come inside.

838
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,268
Who she could be?

839
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:19,404
I don't know.

840
02:10:21,113 --> 02:10:22,102
I am also thinking about that.

841
02:10:24,183 --> 02:10:26,583
Daughters will listen,
I will tell the entire world.

842
02:10:29,354 --> 02:10:31,219
That's what you have done for me,

843
02:10:38,397 --> 02:10:40,729
You kept us prisoner in home,

844
02:10:41,099 --> 02:10:43,363
and having fun outside.

845
02:10:43,669 --> 02:10:45,261
Shut up!

846
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:53,267
Think about your face,

847
02:10:56,315 --> 02:10:58,510
How would you face Allah.

848
02:10:59,785 --> 02:11:01,753
He will return your all worships.

849
02:11:19,805 --> 02:11:22,103
I am warning you if you will
tell the daughters.

850
02:11:34,486 --> 02:11:37,284
What happen?
Tell me who was she?

851
02:11:39,224 --> 02:11:41,317
She was your dad's second wife

852
02:11:43,228 --> 02:11:44,252
A whore,

853
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:51,636
she came here to drop your
8th sister.

854
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:06,345
That woman didn't stay here
because of us.

855
02:12:08,253 --> 02:12:09,811
You go and bring her back,

856
02:12:10,555 --> 02:12:13,649
Because we all are leaving this
house in morning,

857
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:18,220
I will kill all of you if anyone
will step out from the house,

858
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:20,188
We will step out from the house.

859
02:12:20,799 --> 02:12:22,858
And stop threatening to kill us.

860
02:12:24,269 --> 02:12:25,569
It shouldn't happen

861
02:12:25,871 --> 02:12:28,567
what you couldn't do amongst one
of us will do.

862
02:12:29,942 --> 02:12:31,170
I don't know about others,

863
02:12:33,845 --> 02:12:35,369
I have thought many times,

864
02:12:37,683 --> 02:12:40,243
Rather I will burn myself along
with all sisters,

865
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,181
or I shall kill you.

866
02:12:49,561 --> 02:12:50,550
Kill me,

867
02:12:52,364 --> 02:12:53,353
I am telling the truth,

868
02:12:54,566 --> 02:12:57,501
If you will try to lock us in
this house,

869
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,701
then I will really kill you.

870
02:13:03,842 --> 02:13:05,935
Instead of this baby...

871
02:13:06,845 --> 02:13:08,278
I will drop you in that market,

872
02:13:20,258 --> 02:13:21,953
Dad has beaten Baji.

873
02:13:26,465 --> 02:13:28,456
This is our last night in this hell.

874
02:13:30,435 --> 02:13:32,426
Tomorrow morning we all will
leave this place.

875
02:15:39,397 --> 02:15:41,456
Take this baby from here.

876
02:15:46,805 --> 02:15:49,330
You look over here,
Shannu! You go there.

877
02:15:52,144 --> 02:15:53,406
You come with me,

878
02:16:07,792 --> 02:16:08,781
What happen to Hakim?

879
02:16:11,096 --> 02:16:12,427
I killed him,

880
02:16:32,984 --> 02:16:34,611
Where is our baby?

881
02:16:42,661 --> 02:16:44,720
Dad killed her and threw away.

882
02:16:52,737 --> 02:16:55,729
You didn't miss any place?
There are only two rooms,

883
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:13,582
Time is over,

884
02:17:15,126 --> 02:17:16,718
I can't delay anymore.

885
02:17:17,462 --> 02:17:19,794
If the dawn will come then I will have
to postpone it till tomorrow,

886
02:17:20,165 --> 02:17:23,430
Close your cameras,
Pick up your mic's from here,

887
02:17:42,921 --> 02:17:45,685
I got revenge from my dad,

888
02:17:46,658 --> 02:17:50,617
My father didn't born 8 kids but
he killed 8 kids

889
02:17:51,596 --> 02:17:53,962
I want to leave a question behind me,

890
02:17:54,666 --> 02:17:55,462
And I want...

891
02:17:55,834 --> 02:17:58,632
that all of you ask this question
to this society,

892
02:17:58,970 --> 02:18:00,164
The question is that,

893
02:18:01,039 --> 02:18:04,907
Why only killing is a crime why
not to born?

894
02:18:06,044 --> 02:18:09,480
Think about it,

895
02:18:09,714 --> 02:18:10,612
Ask it?

896
02:18:20,058 --> 02:18:21,616
Explain to people.

897
02:18:22,661 --> 02:18:24,151
Don't born more beggars,

898
02:18:24,763 --> 02:18:28,756
We already have crying faces,

899
02:18:29,734 --> 02:18:33,135
When you can't feed then why
did you born?

900
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:44,934
Zainab has left us and gone,
Who is responsible for that?

901
02:19:45,777 --> 02:19:47,836
That father who born Zainab,

902
02:19:48,279 --> 02:19:49,644
but he snatched her life,

903
02:19:50,682 --> 02:19:54,982
or those beaurucrate officers who could
not dare to awake President,

904
02:19:56,388 --> 02:19:58,618
Or Mr. President is responsible.

905
02:19:58,890 --> 02:20:00,949
Who gave this impression to
his staff.

906
02:20:01,292 --> 02:20:04,125
That his sleep is important than
some Zainab,

907
02:20:28,653 --> 02:20:29,711
Call a meeting,

908
02:20:38,930 --> 02:20:39,828
Sir! What will be the agenda,

909
02:20:44,002 --> 02:20:46,732
Why killing is a crime not to born?
