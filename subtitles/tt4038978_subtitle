Hey, hello!

You always come alone,
at least bring the kid along.

You better ask village Chief
to feed his grandson a bit less.

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,824
Madam, it's his daily routine.

12

Don't finger chicks.

26
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,897
They will stop laying eggs.

Oh, yeah. This is the happiness
about going to the village.

Hawan became hit because he
abducted mother Sita.

Have heard Hawan burning many times
but falling, I've heard first time.

87
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,556
What kind of Ham Leela (Epic drama)
do you perform?

88
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,831
Hurry, come home you jokers.

89

Just in five minutes.

116
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,929
You dramatist! They were here
to finalize your alliance.

117
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,726
Couldn't you have taken of
your sari and come, idiot!

118
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,799
You were in tearing hurry
and told me to hurry up.

119
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,661
Don't you know how long it
takes to take off the sari.

120
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:30,959
Rascal, do I take off saris?

121
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:32,896
Even then you know

00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:34,829
I shall slap you hard!

123
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,931
Everyone is spitting on
my name in the village.

00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,123
Tell me something.

125
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,797
You could only find this role
in Fiamlila?2

126
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:42,059
You know what the
entire village says?

127
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,462
My features match with
that of Shurnpakha's. Yeah.

128
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:46,725
You mom witch and
I look to you a demon.

129
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:49,594
Earlier when I used to go around
people said, Jagdeep Singh is going.

130
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,722
And now they say,
Shurnapkha's daddy is going.

131
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:52,897
Now listen to me.

132
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,691
After today if I see you

00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:59,024
...Laxrnn would cut your nose later,
but I shall behead your first.

134
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:01,463
Wonderful, daddy! You won't let
Hindu's and Sikhs live in peace.

135
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,897
I will slap you, damn you!

136
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:06,124
Poor fellow.

137
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,757
So what went wrong with
your other friend?

138
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,992
The wrong which happens to them
let God not that happen to anyone.

139
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,522
He got well educated.

140
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:37,930
Also fell in love with a nice girl.

141
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,989
Then?

142
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,324
But he could'n marry her.
- “my?

143
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:44,957
You must have heard parents being
belittled due to their children..

144
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,862
...but I think he the first child
in the world".

145
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,793
"Who is belittled due to his father.

146
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:53,390
"Funeral Matrial Shop"

147
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:57,964
Hello, Lalaji!
- Hello.

148
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:00,733
Hey, your old man died today
and how come you're back?

149
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,493
Our old man did not die at all.

150
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,065
Actually he watched
spiritual channel Asha..

151
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:05,763
...holding his breath
and practcing Yoga.

152
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,627
And we thought he is
gone for good..

153
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:08,993
...and we bought funeral material.

154
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,926
Now take back that material
and return 1000 bucks.

155
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:14,430
If your old man did not die,
it's fault.

156
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,863
You should be happy that
your old man survived.

157
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:18,555
And here you're cribbing for
1000 bucks!

158
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:19,961
Goods sold once
isn't taken back.

159
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,293
Hey, we aren't crying for
1000 bucks.

160
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,661
But what are we going to do
keeping funeral material at home?

161
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:25,891
What you say is sensible.

162
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,924
Son, Naviot!
- Yes, uncle.

163
00:12:27,986 --> 00:12:29,863
How is your grandma?

164
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:32,364
What to say uncle,
doctors too have lost hope.

165
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,660
They say better take her home
and nurse her.

166
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,993
She may pop off any day.

167
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,596
Hey, the job is done.
His granny is gonna pop off.

168
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:42,667
You better sell off your funeral
material to him at 50% discount.

169
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:44,824
You'll be better off.
Go, quick. - Yeah, let's go.

170
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,593
Brother, Sahani!
We've heard of your granny.

171
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:52,733
We have funeral materials take
it from us at 50% discount.

172
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,662
Also you will be benefited.
Here take it.

173
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,494
Damn you! Wait!
I'll make you profit!

174
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,257
Get lost, you...!
May you be doomed.

175
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,891
Look, how they fled!

176
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,727
Wanted to return
goods to me.

177
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,297
They just come for nothing.

178
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,432
Dad, why are out to
disgrace me in the village?

179
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,898
Sometime at least talk in my
favour! - What side?

180
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,966
Now you're grown up guy,
help your father in the shop.

181
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:17,924
Let both of us together
bring up this business further.

182
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,728
Is this some kind of business,
selling funeral materials?

183
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:24,391
Son, we shall make some money.
Tomorrow you are to be married too.

184
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,430
Dad, the respect which
you carry in this village...

185
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:29,463
"forget about a bride no one
will even be your pallbearer.

186
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,588
Next month the boy's family
are coming to see me.

187
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,863
Either change your business 1 shortly".

188
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,824
...or change your father.

189
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,290
Why are you being tensed?

190
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:39,933
I have already told dad.
He'll change business.

191
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,356
Then what will he do?

192
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,290
Would put up a sugarcane stall.

193
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:44,430
And what will you do?

194
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,296
Now, do you expect my dad to feed
sugarcane in expeller in this age!

195
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,191
I will have to that.

196
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,926
Bravo!

197
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:54,532
An MBA, now you gonna extract
juice for sugarcane? - Hello!

198
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:57,527
Not MBA, I've studied just
up to BA. Just a Graduate.

199
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,725
Oh yeah! But you must say
MBA to my dad.

200
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,893
You may tell him, I'm a scientist,
but let me extract juice.

201
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:04,590
Why?
Won't my dad ask me..

202
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,891
"What kind of scientist is he,
who extracts juice? -Come on!

203
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:08,591
Hasn't you daddy heard the song...

204
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:12,860
"Have your bread with honor,
even if you've to polish shoes"

205
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,490
Jas, the song you're talking about"

206
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:18,359
"after the wedding you won't
be able to buy it's CC even.

207
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:20,428
And how are you going
to meet other expense?

208
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:24,525
Look, I may not be much
yet a little emotional girl.

209
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,190
Instead of breaking relation
after marriage..

210
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,800
...It's better that I break
your heart today

211
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:31,423
You've a month's time.

212
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,424
Either find a good job..

213
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,262
...or start drinking some
branded alcohol.

214
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,433
Of course, your heart is gonna
break, at least save your kidney.

215
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:55,658
Guys!

216
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:58,397
Even my Laadi has given
me ultimatum.

217
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,422
Said, either find a job
within a month..

218
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,256
"Elses I won't be found too.

219
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,391
Is she some kid that
she would be lost?

220
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:07,294
Rascals, worry about me.

221
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,496
If my father does not allow me
to let off my acting bug..

222
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,260
"This bug would eat me
inside out.

223
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,069
Some day I'd collapse like rotten
roof eaten by termites.

224
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,457
If my girl marries somewhere else..

225
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:22,495
...the you burn me with the
beams of your fallen beams.

226
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:25,226
Don't even think of it.
Do you know how costly wood is?

227
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,932
Damn you! You guys keep
bemoaning on you plight.

228
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:30,256
Never fight with your plight.

229
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:31,660
'Will fight. We'll fight.

230
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:34,399
Sid down, damn you!

231
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:36,293
0k, I will go and rehearse it.

232
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:39,559
Whose father would wish that his
son goes around wearing sari?

233
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,456
Hey, lover boy! Hey!

234
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:44,225
Hey, why don't you listen?
He's talking to you.

235
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:48,401
Look bro. It's damn difficult to
find a nice girl in life.

236
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,964
And once you find her,
then don't lose her..

237
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:53,392
...or you won't settle at all.

238
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,624
Of course, time is asleep..

239
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,623
"But our sleeping conscience
will have to be woken up.

240
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:00,294
Or else, it will too late.

241
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,422
But what should we do?

242
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,432
Show it to the world..

243
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:08,931
...the useless you appear,
you aren't that.

244
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:11,285
Buddy, wonderful!
- You are really are something.

245
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:11,627
Buddy, wonderful!
- You are really are something.

246
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,297
Going to stay in the city?
- Yes.

247
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,191
Here you don't allow me
to do acting"

248
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,560
...I'll go to city and become
actor Dh arm en dar.

249
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:20,465
Hey, here you've have put me
to shame.

250
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:22,122
Are you going to put Dharmendar
to shame going to the city?

251
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:23,559
You'll get a hard slap.

252
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,901
Jass, you do know,
you only have 25 day's time.

253
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,388
Otherwise my daddy will
marry me somewhere else.

254
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,967
And you know,
I don't want to lose you.

255
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:34,857
Why are you being tensed?

256
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:38,030
I shall get a job within 25 days.
- Yeah?

257
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:40,132
Go and die in the city!

258
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:42,827
Throw my other bag too.

259
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,829
You've all your clothe in that bag,
what's there in this?

260
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:45,931
My saris.

261
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,294
Damn you!

262
00:19:53,153 --> 00:19:55,827
Laadi, I will miss you a lot
when I am in city.

263
00:19:56,353 --> 00:20:00,062
I'll give you miss calls you
make sure that you call back.

264
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:02,959
And if someone teases you
after I left..

265
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:05,829
...then just give me a ring,
I will abuse him on phoneitself.

266
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:07,493
Don't worry.

267
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:11,833
As is, the one who teased me
he's going with you.

268
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:13,558
Brother, I am telling you...

269
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:17,266
Hey, finish talking soon I've to

Hey, you go back.
He is here.

275
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,389
Go back. Let him sit.

276
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:31,159
Dipti, buy my ticket, ok.

277
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:42,195
From where have all these
flies come from?

278
00:20:50,153 --> 00:20:52,861
Come on. For how many
days your in town?

279
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,066
<i>'L'lll</i> the time four pallbearers
do not carry me off.

280
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,359
Oh! Have thought of
great achievements! Yeah?

281
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,230
Hey, I am talking of funeral.

282
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:01,865
Yeah, where will you stay?

283
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,491
Brother, you're the one who
woke up our sleeping conscience

284
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,023
We are gonna sleep with you.

285
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:11,333
I sleep at the poultry farm,
how can I accommodate you.

286
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,900
Don't you worry. We'll adjust with
the chickens and sleep with them.

287
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,090
Oh,no man!

288
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,756
We aren't gonna eat your chickens.

289
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,900
As it is, we've turned vegetarian
since yesterday.

290
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:22,092
It's not that, man.
They peck.

291
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,729
Hey, now what we have
boasted back at the village"

292
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:26,389
...now if go back village folk
would kill us with their taunts.

293
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,397
Not this is final.

294
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,092
As long we settle in life,
we won't return home.

295
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:32,028
Now only our bodies
will go back to village.

296
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:34,357
We too will adjust
with the chickens here.

297
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,866
Bro, it's you who'll have to adjust
Please do it.

298
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:38,293

Who's he?
- My star friend Babbu.

304
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,229

308

Sir, fine. It's your...
- Here is your payment.

Even a spot boys take
700 hundred bucks, sir.

332

Buddy, spot boy is valued.
No one asks you.

ask money that day.

00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:22,923
I am good.
Tell me, how are you?

338
00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:24,896
Bro, here are two friends
from my village.

339
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,055
He is Dipti.
- How are you?

340
00:24:26,153 --> 00:24:27,063
He is Jass.
- How are you?

341
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:28,757
They want a place to stay.

342
00:24:28,953 --> 00:24:30,227
You are doing so well, man.

343
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,199
Come on, I've never
took it to my head.

344
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:34,560
Please sign here.

345
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,722
Come on, I am talking.
Come later for autograph.

346
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:38,988
Hello, let autograph go to hell.

347
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:41,133
I'm the accountant.
The 500 bucks you just took..

348
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:43,199
...I want a receipt for it.
Plant your signature here.

349
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:44,256
Oh...

350
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,929
No problem, we are the same.

351
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:54,523
Come on men, I'm also
looking for music teacher's job.

352
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,129
The day I get it, I shall
do what I like.

353
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,226
By the way, you were
talking about a place to stay?

354
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:02,131
Will it be all right where
I put up now?

355
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,656
What do you mean?

356
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,663
We shall put up a mat
just below you and sleep.

357
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,167
I myself sleep on floor,
how'd you put a mat below me?

358
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,161
My landlord charges 1500 rent.

359
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,924
Each of us would pay 1500
and stay.

360
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,158
All right. - What all right?
Where do I've 1500?

361
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,931
Even my bus ticket was
brought by this guy.

362
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,055
Hey, I lied that I bought it.

363
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:23,756
Damn you, you have
travelled with out ti ck et.

364
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:26,191
All together we have
only 5 or 600 rupees.

365
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:29,066
Bro, do this. You pay up
the rent for this month.

366
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,099
When we take up a job
we'll pay back.

367
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,700
Come on, I myself am
striving for little money.

368
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,656
How'd I pay 4500?

369
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,093
You guys are in a bad shape.

370
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:38,754
What do you do?

371
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,621
Me?
- Yes.

372
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,666
L... l...

373
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,957
Soon he'll be a clerk.

374
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,597
Not him, I asked about you?

375
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,165
Oh!I...l...

376
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,726
This guy is in acting.

377
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,061
If not today, tomorrow he will
get a job of clerk..

378
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,858
"And this guy will be a star.

379
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,455
Come on, bro.
Adjust somehow.

380
00:25:57,687 --> 00:25:58,859
Ad]uslment...?

381
00:25:59,553 --> 00:26:01,533
Yeah, a scheme could work.
- Which?

382
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:03,766
If you come after my
landlord goes to bed...

383
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,493
"and go out before
he wakes up...

384
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,064
Yeah.

385
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:07,995
Then you can stay totally free.

386
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:10,855
Tell me, what you say?
- Yeah, fine.

387
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:12,794
Has anyone seen flaying
cow's horns?

388
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,230
And Paali, at the sametime
when our stay is free..

389
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:16,657
...you too join us.

390
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,591
Okay, pick up your bags. Come.

391
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:22,158
Hey, wait here.

392
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:23,863
Dog could have bitten us.

393
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,426
Be quiet.

394
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,190
Hey, seems my landlord
is fast asleep.

395
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:32,691
I'll go and put the lights off.
Come through the window.

396
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:34,025
All right.
- Okay.

397
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:40,556
He is there.
- Come. Let's go.

398
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:45,556
Hold this.

399
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,528
Hock Star! Hock Star!
- Damn you, stop it.

400
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:52,724
Come on settle down.
- Am I responsible for you...

401
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:54,824
Here put the mat.
- Sit down.

402
00:26:57,653 --> 00:26:59,030
The guy has made a pillow of me.

403
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,957
Get up. Hey, get up.
It's morning.

404
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:12,927
Let me sleep, man.
Not going for morning walk.

405
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,626
You guys will be in trouble
and put me in trouble too.

406
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,027
Okay, make some tea.

407
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,622
Come on get up?
- It's not granny's place?

408
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:22,158
Do this, drink two glasses water
from our makeshift fridge.

409
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,832
You keep quite! Put on clothes
and get lost from here.

410
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:27,430
Hey, when brother is asking to go
then leave.

411
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:30,090
Damn you, you'll get thrashed
and get me beaten too..

412
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:31,421
Now better vanish.

413
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,524
Today getting 1500 is a must,
why not if have to pickpocket.

414
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,861
All have harassed me.
Now handover that T shirt.

415
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:39,361
<i>Take.</i>

416
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:44,921
It's too high.

417
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:54,691
Before we're accused of theft,
better let's find some job first.

418
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:04,355
Devil does not laugh like this.

419
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:06,024
Bit loud!

420
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,960
Oof! Will some one tell him
how to laugh.

421
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:23,692
Too good a devil!

422
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:26,924
Thank you.
I've never been proud.

423
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,101
Tell me how do you aci
so well as devil?

424
00:28:30,353 --> 00:28:32,355
Actually, my daddy told me,
when I was about to born..

425
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:34,966
...my mummy crossed over some
evil magic line.

426
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,798
<i>Wham?</i>

427
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,299
This is nothing, last year I got the
award of Best Devil of the Year.

428
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,527
I never heard of this award ever?

429
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,998
Actually a little while ago our village
council has started it.

430
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:47,560
Oh, oh!
So, Mr. Devil...

431
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:51,059
Not Devil.
They call me Dipti.

432
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:52,327
Oh!

433
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:00,656
Here is the advance.

434
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,633
200 for the rehearsal
and 1000 bucks per show.

435
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:06,599
No problem,
I will do it for you.

436
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,957
Along with the Western
we also run classical..

437
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,991
"I really loved it as I've found
someone more beautiful than you?

438
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,028
"Now I don't miss you at all,
I have found someone better"

439
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,294
Yes, sir?

440
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,832
He's our new music teacher,
Babbu Kirtpuriya.

441
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:40,533
I have met him earlier.
On a shooting.

442
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,825
Really?
- Yes.

443
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,490
Okay. You introduce him to
the students.

444
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,356
I will see you later.

445
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,421
Good luck.
- Thank you.

446
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,627
Come I will introduce you
to my students.

447
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:53,557
Pooia, ManpreeL.

448
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,633
"Shivani, Shablin..

449
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:56,924
Gurpreet.

450
00:30:04,353 --> 00:30:05,491
Mr. Babu?

451
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,897
Mr. Kirtpuriya,'
- Oh! '

452
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,923
Yes?

453
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,863
So when are you joining?

454
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:18,297
I feel like not leaving at all.

455
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:20,494
But the classes are
about to be over.

456
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:21,588
Is that so?
- Yes.

457
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,697
0k, then we shall meet tomorrow.

458
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:25,297
Good bye, then.

459
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,559
Okay, kids.
My hearty good bye!

460
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,597
Bye, sir.
- Let's continue.

461
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:35,596
Man, Babbu says that
constable is on night duty.

462
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,593
Then why the sounds
coming from inside?

463
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,755
Come on I am tired.

464
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,558
Come on, we can't wait for him.

465
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,324
I say, let's jump in through
the window.

466
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,694
I have to go for rehearsal
too in the morning.

467
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,800
Damn that I let your conscience
wake up.

468
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,722
My sleep is also tossed off.

469
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:52,162
Come on, brother! Find someiob
at least we'll have a house.

470
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:55,232
Today we did worn out our shoes.\lt will take some time.

471
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,731
Hey!

472
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,530
Guess what?

473
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,430
Does he say go up and sleep?
- No, man!

474
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,462
What happened?

475
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:04,827
Rascals, I got a job! A job.

476
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,399

Tomorrow I will take you to the
move 'Bhag Milkha Bhag'.

479
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:12,594
I too got a role in a drama.
But don't ask about money?

480
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,321
So where's the drink?

481
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:15,788
<i>L</i> mean Pam/P

482
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:18,667
Dummy, you said you'd not party
unless you are set.

483
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:20,288
Who knows when he'll settle.

484
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:21,761
At least let's drink and settle.

485
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,665
Cheers!

486
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,532
Guys, even say cheers
on fourth peg!

487
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,265
Guys, a totally new song...
- Keep it coming.

488
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:33,764
Right now I have made it for you.

489
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:35,696
Must be the some rubbish...
- Listen to the song.

490
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:37,888
Should I start loudly'?

491
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,494
Wow! Wonderful!

492
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:46,194
Give him the beats.

493
00:31:55,453 --> 00:32:00,402
"We two birds study in college"

494
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:06,226
"That's why we have
the perspective"

495
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:09,692
"And sitting on the top
of the bust, we...

496
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:14,827
...we study, we study"

497
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,795
"My white Lansar car keeps
moving fast and fast"

498
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,724
Babbu! Hey, Babbu!
Open the door.

499
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,227
Who's spilled the dustbin outside?

500
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,327
Babbu, open the door!

501
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:29,790
Can't you hear?

502
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:31,357
Who drank here?

503
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,058
Get it's trouble now.
- Who's with you?

504
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,464
Get up, the landlord is here.

505
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,189
Hun guys, run.

506
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:38,764
Hun Dipti run.

507
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,356
Hun, run.

508
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:45,096
He has mugged up the movie name
Bhag Milkha Bhag, making us run.

509
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,824
Come on. Let's go.
Here is the bottle.

510
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,298
Be careful.

511
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:51,763
Hey, you are stuck now
get moving fast.

512
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,292
I am getting suffocated.

513
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:56,761
You get aside.

514
00:32:57,287 --> 00:32:58,391
Who is he?

515
00:32:58,753 --> 00:33:01,097
I don't know.
- You don't know?

516
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:03,724
Come on, bring the Guggu's sari.

517
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:05,561
Damn you, Guggu is a carpenter.

518
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:08,133
Okay, than apply some oil
so we can slip off.

519
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,064
It's not Guggu's shop that
he will give you oil.

520
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:12,598
Then apply grease.

521
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:15,666
Do you think it's a workshop
the you'll get grease?

522
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:22,327
Here take your baggage, and
if I ever see you around here..

523
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,323
...I shall have you arrested
and get you beaten up good.

524
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,193
Get lost you useless fellows.

525
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,660
I was so well settled here..

526
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:30,527
...these guys came and
uprooted me too.

527
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:33,395
My foot, you were set! You were
living a dilapidated house.

528
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:35,763
I will stone you!
Who spilled the dustbin?

529
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:37,999
How would we know in drunk
condition who did it!

530
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,464
Now I don't know where
will I live.

531
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,625
Have courage.
We'll do something.

532
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:46,031
We 4 were living here in 1500
how'd you find cheaper place.

533
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,758
I can't understand
what's there for look for.

534
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:50,659
The windows are broken, we will
climb up the pipe and get in.

535
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:52,289
Damn you!
- Why did not you like it?

536
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:55,658
Look, we will find some cheap
place in town.

537
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:56,654
Comelefs go

538
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:57,723
Come, lefs go.

539
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,385
We will find some place, man.

540
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:04,333
Whether me, Mr. Kripal Singh Gill,
gets a few bucks less..

541
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:06,098
...I'm least bothered.

542
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,960
Because I have happily retired
as Subedar Major from the army.

543
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:11,324
But, tell me something truthfully.

544
00:34:11,986 --> 00:34:14,262
Are both of you bachelors?

545
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,363
Yes, sir. We're bachelors.

546
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:18,296
How proudly they are saying
bachelors"

547
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,161
"as if they are on highest post
in the army!

548
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:23,131
Sorry young men, no home.

549
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,200
But why can't we get the house?

550
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:29,024
You're looking for an house, and
I'd not attend your funeral even.

551
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,029
We didn't get it?

552
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:31,964
It's my father who had
made me understand"

553
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:35,395
...son, never keep a broom erect
and keep a bachelor tenant in life.

554
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,431
Why'd you hate bachelors so much?

555
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:39,932
Hate?
I have a young niece in house.

556
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,561
So how can a have two bachelor
mustangs at home?

557
00:34:42,653 --> 00:34:45,031
I haven't even allowe to hang
bachelor's calendar here.

558
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,599
Uncle, you've totally
diverted the topic.

559
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,423
Sorry, young men.
No room for bachelors.

560
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:56,088
Who told you we are bachelors?

561
00:34:56,353 --> 00:34:58,230
We both have wives
who are married.

562
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,530
StFﬂge!

563
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:01,462
I have heard the bachelors
have sisters"

564
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:03,327
"but they have wives too,
I've found today.

565
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,990
Why, did you get married
and then donated them to someone?

566
00:35:07,153 --> 00:35:08,131
You didn't understand, sir.

567
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,893
We are married. But the
Chhada is our cast.

568
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:15,398
Myself, Palli Chhada.
This is my cousin Jass Chhada.

569
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:19,398
I've heard of Chhada many times,
but Chhada is some cast, no.

570
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:21,464
Okay, sit down now.

571
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,264
However, no one even gives even
hands over a calf to such a bad cast.

572
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,231
"People, so how could anyone
has give their daughter to you.

573
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:28,228
Certainly there must be fault
with the girl's folk.

574
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,464
However.

575
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:32,497
I might as well rent out to you,
I've no problem.

576
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:34,326
But note one thing
very clearly.

577
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,865
If tomorrow, anything
otherwise happens to my niece..

578
00:35:37,253 --> 00:35:39,893
...then take it, your misuses
too will not survive.

579
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:44,997
Because, this Subedar Major,
Kirpal Singh is also a bachelor.

580
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,590
How could you say that
you are married?

581
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,466
But from where are you going
to bring woman?

582
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:56,387
It will...

583
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,522
That too is arranged.

584
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,332
Now, apart from the house they
are also ready with woman.

585
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:02,956
"Damn it, I've become a husband"

586
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,461
"Damn it, I've become a husband"

587
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:07,226
Yeah.
- Dipti, not the husband but wife.

588
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:10,329
What do you mean?
- Say.

589
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,564
Look.

590
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:13,991
As you portrayed Shurpakha
in the village"

591
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:15,828
"similarly you wear saris
and stay in this house.

592
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:17,925
Stay as my wife.

593
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:19,326
You go to hell!

594
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,094
Instead of sleeping with you
I'd prefer to stay on railway station.

595
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,060
We aren't so bad.
With how difficulty we found a house.

596
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:26,222
Make him understand.

597
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,354
Come around, man.

598
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,229
Also you get wonderful
blouses here.

599
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:33,798
I'll slap you! I'm here to be a
hero and you're making me heroine?

600
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:34,797
Oh!

601
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:36,830
So you've made me a Sainay Dutt
of the street"

602
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:38,425
...and you are becoming
a hero Dharmendar.

603
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:40,032
Buddy, till the time we
don't get a house..

604
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,326
...till then wear a sari, man!

605
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,457
Dipti, look if we don't get a roof
over my head..

606
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:46,162
...then you can continue to roam
around in village wearing a sari.

607
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,457
Come on, man. Agree.
Please.

608
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:51,900
Now this has started, don't know
what else we'll have to do in future.

609
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,290
Okay, all right buddies.

610
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:55,333
Great!
This called a friend.

611
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,797
But don't get me killed
by putting me in ladies sari.

612
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,927
Hey, listen. Will all three will
have one wife?

613
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,531
Damn, will you become
the second wife.

614
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:08,965
You go to hell! - When it comes
to you, are blouses are over?

615
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:12,296
Oh, no guys. lfl wear a blouse
my stomach will be seen.

616
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:14,390
Come on, will your navel
turn black?

617
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,491
Then why not wear a dress.
And also I have heard..

618
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,030
...you get wonderful
Punjabi dresses here.

619
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,327
Yeah, wearing sari is a tough job,
I too will wear a dress.

620
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:24,960
Come, no quickly order tea.

621
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:26,392
We also have to get
waxing done.

622
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:27,295
Yeah.

623
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:28,363
Hey!

624
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:05,127
She's Neeru.
- Hello, sir.

625
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:06,823
Neeru Baiwa?

626
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,422
<i>No, Nam Ghhada.</i>

627
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:09,993
Ans she's is Pinki.

628
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:11,063
From Moga?

629
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,895
No, Pnki Chhada.

630
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:15,925
I fail to understand this..

631
00:38:16,386 --> 00:38:18,297
"That you've such beautiful wives"

632
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:20,729
...yet you had such problem
finding a house?

633
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:23,058
Actually this is the thing
that they are beautiful.

634
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:25,224
Wherever we went we found
the landlords lechers.

635
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:27,458
When we brothers went for
theiob, we used to tell them..

636
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:28,924
...to keep watch on them.

637
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:31,863
Forget about watching
they eyed them.

638
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,662
By the way, Mr. Subedar sir,
you aren't that kind, are you?

639
00:38:35,753 --> 00:38:36,288
<i>Wham?</i>

640
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,927
I mean,
is your intention good?

641
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:41,293
Does intentions take time
to change? - What?

642
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:45,130
Oh I mean, you are so
beautiful.

643
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,663
...so where lied the fault
with the landlords?

644
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:49,764
However, tell me..

645
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,230
"Between two of your,
who is whose husband?

646
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,790
<i>Wham?</i>

647
00:38:58,353 --> 00:38:59,798
He's my husband.

648
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:00,896
Both?

649
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,332
No, he alone.

650
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:06,867
Oh, and he is Neelu's hubby.

651
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:07,727
Oh!

652
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,259
I thought both of them
are your husbands. - No.

653
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:11,798
And you are alone.

654
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,361
My father was right.

655
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,859
...a soldire is known by his rifle and
a mare is known from itds lineage.

656
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:21,165
And still if you find the
place upstairs less..

657
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,223
...then one of you can come down
and stay with me.

658
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,229
And for that you may
pay me less rent.

659
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,633
No, we shall pay you
the full rent..

660
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,222
...and also get adjusted upstairs.

661
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:32,232
Of course, no one will
adisut with me.

662
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:34,264
I mean, when I was in army"

663
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:36,390
...in one tent we 20 guys
used to get adjusted.

664
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:37,891
Oh God!

665
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,358
Look.

666
00:39:40,153 --> 00:39:41,188
Uncle!

667
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:43,025
Hi, Jasmieet!

668
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,126
Come dear.

669
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:49,859
Meet her.

670
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,589
She's my niece..

671
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,228
"And they are our
new tenants.

672
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:55,755
Hello. - Hello.
- She's my wife Neeru.

673
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:57,594
Hello!
- Hello.

674
00:39:57,787 --> 00:40:01,257
She's my beautiful wife
Pinki Chhada.

675
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:04,294
Hello...

676
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,028
Hello.

677
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,321
You?

678
00:40:12,053 --> 00:40:13,726
Your face is exactly like...

679
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,298
No, it does not resemble anyone.

680
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:17,122
With whom, by the way?

681
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,561
With our new Music Teacher
Babbu.

682
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:23,093
It seems he is standing in
a ladies dress.

683
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:24,961
Is it my fault?

684
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:28,997
He's my twin brother
two years younger to me.

685
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:30,630
'If Iait a minute!

686
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,562
Here atwin is not considered
even if he is born two minutes late.

687
00:40:33,787 --> 00:40:35,198
So how could he be
two years younger brother?

688
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:36,889
No, Subedar sir..

689
00:40:36,987 --> 00:40:40,560
"Actually their faces are so alike,
so alike..

690
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,930
...that people lovingly
call them twins.

691
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:44,222
Oh! So if you say..

692
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:46,032
...then it's possible they
are twins.

693
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:47,994
Does he know that
you've come here to stay.'

694
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,164
No.

695
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:50,993
So we'll call him tomorrow.

696
00:40:51,087 --> 00:40:53,089
No. We hate together.

697
00:40:53,253 --> 00:40:56,166
It's not hate together.
It's hate each other.

698
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,790
Whatever it is.
You understood, isn't it?

699
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:00,960
You explained
and I understood.

700
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,259
If you are finished with your
enquiries and interference"

701
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,758
...could we go to our room?

702
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:05,627
No.

703
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,290
I had just a request".

704
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,160
"That your dinner is with me.

705
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:11,755
So nice.

706
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:13,091
Because it's our tradition..

707
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,527
.That on the first day we do not
let new bride to go in kitchen.

708
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,164
No. But it's tradition
in his place"

709
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:19,266
...that on the very first day
they put new bride to work.

710
00:41:19,587 --> 00:41:20,622
Come, take the bags.

711
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,926
Come on, bring it.

712
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,760
Thank you sir.

713
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,499
Thank you.
- Come on quick.

714
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:29,958
I made a mistake.

715
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,893
I should have put them
in room downstairs.

716
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,156
So you could only find
this house to stay?

717
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:36,058
Did we know..

718
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,995
"That you keep playing music
everywhere.

719
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,555
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

720
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:40,687
I am the star of tomorrow.

721
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:42,588
Damn star!

722
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:45,927
As it is nobody know you and
where not needed they recon you.

723
00:41:47,187 --> 00:41:50,031
Let that be. Now what should we
do about twin brother problem?

724
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:53,168
Look bro. Between brother and
sister one should walk limping.

725
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:55,965
Jasmeet will then believe that
you two are different.

726
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,723
And what should I do,
that old man is trying to make me.

727
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,190
<i>New“!</i>

728
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:02,993
<i>Pink“.!</i>

729
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,800
Now put on your wigs
and run.

730
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:09,500
Ask old stop making passes
and ring the bell at least.

731
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:11,923
Hide.

732
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:15,791
<i>Maw come in'!?</i>

733
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:18,030
You are already in.

734
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:20,726
Our door sill begins
from here.

735
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:22,888
Com e. Please com e.

736
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:26,624
I have brought dinner for you.

737
00:42:27,053 --> 00:42:28,896
You must not have
cooked today

738
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:32,465
But why are you guys
so baffled.

739
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:33,925
Oh, it's not that.

740
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,727
...It's a new place that's why.

741
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,624
Why what's wrong
with new place?

742
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,989
I can't see you wives?

743
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:42,962
Actually they are bathing.

744
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:44,632
Both together?

745
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:46,696
To apply soap on each
other's back.

746
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:49,060
As your hand can't reach
the entire back.

747
00:42:50,453 --> 00:42:52,558
Of course no one's hand
can completely reach the back.

748
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:55,596
Look at me, I never realized it.

749
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,426
Otherwise I too could have
made me soap at my back.

750
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,600
How careful ladies are
about their health.

751
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,165
And men are so careless.

752
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:05,666
When will they come out.

753
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,490
They will take some time.

754
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:11,797
Once they go in, they get into
the tub and play like children.

755
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:14,561
They haven't come out
of their childhood..

756
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,164
"And my youth is dying
looking at them.

757
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,963
What?
- Nothing.

758
00:43:19,186 --> 00:43:22,565
If I go in right now and give them
my message it won't look nice.

759
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,559
So convey my message
when they come out

760
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:28,759
...that I personally cooked
dinner for them and brought.

761
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:30,123
I'll leave now.

762
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,963
Okay. Bye.

763
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,098
By the way, why not knock once
again, they might come out.

764
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:39,660
Oh, no.
It certainly will take some time.

765
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:41,061
Okay then.

766
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:44,060
All my efforts went futile.

767
00:43:46,953 --> 00:43:48,955
Come out.
Hey, come out.

768
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,124
He left?
- He was here with food.

769
00:43:55,587 --> 00:43:57,624
Are we labouring for him that
he came to give us food.

770
00:43:57,686 --> 00:43:59,688
He wasn't here to give us food,
he came to shock us here.

771
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,764
If not today, tomorrow
we will be caught.

772
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,891
Man the more you are scared,
he will doubt more.

773
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,466
At least talk to this uncle and
nice with such confidence..

774
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,690
"That even if you send you for a
medical test you prove a woman.

775
00:44:08,953 --> 00:44:10,057
What do you mean?

776
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,457
I mean, confidence.

777
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,730
Mr. Babbu!

778
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,898
How are you.
- I'm good. How about you?

779
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:52,830
I am good.
I met your sister.

780
00:44:52,953 --> 00:44:53,897
Yeah 7

781
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,425
Was she alone or her
husband was with her.

782
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:57,691
She was with her hubby.

783
00:44:58,353 --> 00:44:59,559
Do they stay together?

784
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:01,561
And why did you rent
your house to them?

785
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,329
How do you know,
they've come to our place?

786
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,458
I have a sharp sixth sense.

787
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:10,323
You tell me half
and I understand the full thing.

788
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:14,366
Now, they were looking
for a rented house.

789
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,926
I felt they might have
come to your place.

790
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:18,931
Yeah, they have rented
at our place.

791
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,630
But why do you sibling
hate each other so much?

792
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,457
Actually, I have a long running
fued with my sister's clan.

793
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:26,728
You have one
and the same clan.

794
00:45:27,387 --> 00:45:28,695
How could it be feud
in the same clan?

795
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:31,465
Come on, isn't her clan different
when she got married?

796
00:45:31,786 --> 00:45:32,856
It comes from that side.

797
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:34,794
Otherwise I have nothing
against her.

798
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,431
And what's the problem
with the brother-in-law?

799
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:39,031
Many times when we sat on drinks
he threw gospels at me.

800
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:43,357
I've heard of tantrums but
what this throwing gospels is?

801
00:45:43,753 --> 00:45:46,427
Come on, leave it now.
I am already so confused.

802
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:47,964
I mean, it's aching.

803
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:49,864
Shouldn't we go and
have a some tea?

804
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,431
0k, lefs go.
- Come along.

805
00:46:08,387 --> 00:46:09,991
I had come here to be a
hero like Dharmendra..

806
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,831
Rascals, have turned me into
heroine like Hema Malini.

807
00:46:12,787 --> 00:46:13,788
O my Lord!

808
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:16,961
First time Major Katal Singh,
with the chicken legs..

809
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,957
...Is going to try and impress Neeru.
Pardon, I'm not blemished.

810
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:32,701
I am your soldier,
my sweetie!

811
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:34,594
O my sweetie!

812
00:46:35,253 --> 00:46:39,224
Your love makes my heart
beats like drum, O my sweefie!

813
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:41,396
0 my, Sweetie!

814
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:46,231
Come on rascals!

815
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,300
I shall teach you a lesson today.
Come on, son.

816
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:52,489
Surprise!

817
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,657
Oh, you broke my arm!

818
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,860
Oh, you broke my arm!
Open the door, quick.

819
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,596
Are you going to make me lame?

820
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,462
Open the door now.

821
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,330
Sorry.

822
00:47:09,653 --> 00:47:11,599
I thought it was just an arm..

823
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:12,888
...so I was very scared.

824
00:47:13,953 --> 00:47:15,193
However, what brings you here?

825
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:17,194
I have brought Tanduri
Chicken for you.

826
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:19,159
But you made mincemeat
of m y arm.

827
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:21,524
You may eat either of it now.
Choice is yours.

828
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:25,426
By the was, how did you
think of chicken today.'

829
00:47:25,853 --> 00:47:27,855
I thought, only we two soul
are at hom e..

830
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:29,732
...so why not have lunch
together.

831
00:47:30,453 --> 00:47:32,262
Also when soul is afire within..

832
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:34,791
...then why to heat or cook
on separate stoves.

833
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,356
Fire within?
- Yes.

834
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,329
You've acidity?
- Damn!

835
00:47:38,486 --> 00:47:40,432
If I had acidity, would I
come with the chicken?

836
00:47:40,553 --> 00:47:42,123
Wouldn'tl have had
antacid in my hand.

837
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,130
It's not acidity,
I've love's acidity.

838
00:47:45,187 --> 00:47:45,824
Oh my God!

839
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:48,294
I've often heard of DDT..

840
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:50,396
"But what's this love's DDT?

841
00:47:50,487 --> 00:47:52,125
It's a very strange ailment.

842
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:55,127
I will explain.
The warms of this love-acidity"

843
00:47:55,687 --> 00:47:57,826
"makes a soul wander.

844
00:47:58,487 --> 00:47:59,363
God!

845
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:00,731
Let me be.

846
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:02,697
I will go and warm the chicken.

847
00:48:04,887 --> 00:48:06,696
Why wasie time to warm up..

848
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:09,458
"You could have let it be in hands
it would have warm ed up.

849
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,633
He is looking as if he had
never seen something

850
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:24,628
Did my sweetie say something?

851
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:26,797
No.

852
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,555
Here take it.

853
00:48:34,353 --> 00:48:35,491
Partake chicken.

854
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,598
Ladies first

855
00:48:36,787 --> 00:48:37,697

856
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,723
No, you first

857
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:41,191

861
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:52,425
Why is it so bitter?

862
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,597
Oh, I had burnt it.

863
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:56,389
Sol applied
anti-burn cream on it.

864
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,426
Now call me sweetie!

865
00:49:01,653 --> 00:49:03,564

Here it is.

872
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:30,295
Oh.

873
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:31,227
What's wrong?

874
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,765
Madam, tyre is burst.

875
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:33,722
<i>Now when'!?</i>

876
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:35,464
Now you've have step down.

877
00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:38,397
How'd I go home now?
Do something.

878
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,397
0k, I'll try inflating tyre
with my mouth.

879
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:43,263
What's wrong?

880
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,397
Tyre punctured.
Will you repair it?

881
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,361
I can't, but I can help you.

882
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:49,688
How'd that be?

883
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,294
I will drop your passenger
on my bicycle.

884
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,555
After all I am a brother.

885
00:49:53,753 --> 00:49:54,754
Oh yeah?

886
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:56,730
Hey, not hers.
Yours.

887
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,258
Madam , com e.

888
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,093
Oh, no. That...
- All right then.

889
00:50:00,187 --> 00:50:01,427
Remove that wheel
and give it to me.

890
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:04,066
What's it to me. I will get it
repaired. It might take an hour

891
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,666
Oh, no, bro.
Madam, you better go with him.

892
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,523
Instead of going on foot in such
a head, cycle would be better.

893
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:10,665
Come on, don't worry.

894
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:12,288
Please come.

895
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,621
Sit.

896
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:18,230
It's too hot!

897
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:20,131
Com e, sit.

898
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:22,430
Shall we?

899
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,658
0k, Maddi. Get your
puncture repaired.

900
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:29,466
You be careful. In your excitement
don't let make madam fall off.

901
00:50:30,587 --> 00:50:31,725
Madam !
- Yes?

902
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,259
Would you mind
if I say something.

903
00:50:36,353 --> 00:50:37,423
Maw I?

904
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:41,663
Next week I'm organizing
Shabir (Mass Sherbet distribution).

905
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:43,431
Will you come?

906
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,460
<i>Oh, Shaw'!
- 'ix.</i>

907
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:47,388
I felt that...

908
00:50:47,686 --> 00:50:49,996
Oh, did you feel it's
some feast?

909
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:53,063
No problem . I'd arrange
for a feast too.

910
00:50:53,453 --> 00:50:54,625
Then, should I note down
your name?

911
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:56,929
Where you've to note the name?

912
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:58,655
Actually, we're preparing a list.

913
00:51:03,453 --> 00:51:04,124
<i>Wham?</i>

914
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,260
Who is this girl with him?

915
00:51:12,553 --> 00:51:14,157
Okay, here's my house.

916
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:20,192
Madam, you did not reply.
You'd come, won't you?

917
00:51:21,653 --> 00:51:24,259
All right, I wlll try.

918
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,894
Make sure to bring a pot too.

919
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,225
But don't write my name
in any list.

920
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:30,328
There's not list maintained
for the festival.

921
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,893
All right.

922
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:40,157
Thanks for dropping me.

923
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,122
I too thank you.

924
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,958
Hey, where are you off to?

925
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:01,354
You'd get me killed!

926
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,525
If wanna talk loudly,
talk in ladies' voice.

927
00:52:07,286 --> 00:52:08,287
Where are you going?

928
00:52:08,453 --> 00:52:09,625
To work. Where else?

929
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:11,532
And you?
- For the interview.

930
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,226
Everyday you guys walk off.
Am I here to knit a sweater?

931
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:17,559
What would Subedar thing,
everyday women go out of house?

932
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:19,059
Dose not she go out too?

933
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:21,398
Damn you, it's my helplessness.

934
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:26,195
I am helpless, sis.
With great difficult I got a job.

935
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:30,431
Oh yeah, I am on official leave.
Don't I've to attend work too?

936
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:33,524
I too have some dream s.
My youth will be gone, due to you.

937
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,031
So what's wrong with your youth.

938
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:36,998
Why do you make
an issue of minor things.

939
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:39,060
If it is so, let's part today.

940
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:40,131
My God!

941
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,600
Today I realized,
what woman have to go through.

942
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,864
You've to lose a lot to
achieve something in life.

943
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,900
Also, aren't we too have
big dreams in life?

944
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,893
Enough now.
I am leaving.

945
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:51,864
It's time for my interview.
- Go.

946
00:52:57,353 --> 00:52:58,559
You're here?

947
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,390
What now?

948
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:02,998
I was here to give this sweet.

949
00:53:03,053 --> 00:53:04,191
Is it Sankrant festival today?

950
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:07,493
No. Actually these sweets were
for a ceremony, it was not done..

951
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,161
...so I thought I should
give it to you.

952
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,955
I will give it to them.

953
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,224
Sure?
- Yeah.

954
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:17,795
Ask Neeru to eat it.

955
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,258
I have cooked it
with my own hands.

956
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:20,957
All right. I will tell her.

957
00:53:21,187 --> 00:53:22,928
Damn the sweets too did
not help.

958
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:26,329
Says he cooked it with hand,
do you cook with feet?

959
00:53:31,986 --> 00:53:35,092
Eat Mrs. Subedar, your Mister
has brought sweets for you.

960
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,796
Subedar!

961
00:53:37,187 --> 00:53:39,258
Subedar, screw you!
- Hey, don't!

962
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,857
Did notl tell you that Subedar
is keeping an eye on us.

963
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,201
Bro, as long as we aren't set,
please be calm.

964
00:53:46,453 --> 00:53:48,433
Enough. He accepts.
Let's go.

965
00:53:51,553 --> 00:53:54,932
Sister, keep your wig
with yourself.

966
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,231
Bye!
- Hell with your bye!

967
00:53:59,953 --> 00:54:03,264
"0 beautiful lass, do you mind..."

968
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,494
"Beautiful lass, do you mind..."

969
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,793
"...if I say what's in my heart?"

970
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:12,822
Try singing on higher note.

971
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:16,262
"0 beautiful lass, do you mind..."

972
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:19,426
"0 beautiful lass, do you mind..."

973
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:24,163
"...if I say what's in my heart?"

974
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,230
On first call I got scared.

975
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,057
On the second call
I went inside the home.

976
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:35,169
On third call, you straight away
came and knocked at the door.

977
00:54:36,786 --> 00:54:37,423
Sorry.

978
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:41,162
Subedar Major Kirpal Singh,
entered without knocking.

979
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,763
I shall enter again.
You continue.

980
00:54:45,187 --> 00:54:46,291
But pardon me.

981
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:49,260
Is this some new yoga pose
of Baba Ham dev?

982
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,091
Oh.

983
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,458
Oh, no.

984
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,030
Actually, when I am sad"

985
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,996
...I lift my legs like that
and do this yoga posture.

986
00:54:58,187 --> 00:54:58,961
<i>Strange.</i>

987
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,760
I had heard, if a one is happy
his feet do not touch ground..

988
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:04,158
"But they go up like this,
I know it today.

989
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:07,094
However, I am here because..

990
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,330
...when I saw the arguments
going on with you..

991
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:12,762
...so I, Subedar Major
felt very bad.

992
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:14,830
Oh, it means, you are
know of everything?

993
00:55:14,986 --> 00:55:17,091
I have even found what's
inside you.

994
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:18,698
But I am not at fault at all.

995
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,763
This woman business
is all due to them.

996
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,822
Men arelikethat.

997
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:28,293
Leaving beautiful woman behind
other rubbish woman.

998
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,326
<i>(“Here woman'!
- 'ix.</i>

999
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:35,860
Oh, don't remind me!
I'm destroyed! I'm devastated.

1000
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:39,224
Your life is destroyed.
Not your fate.

1001
00:55:39,787 --> 00:55:42,290
But don't worry.
I'll not let anything be destroyed.

1002
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,922
Now, listen to me.

1003
00:55:44,053 --> 00:55:46,226
You too act the same way
as your husband behaves.

1004
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:48,390
I did not get you?

1005
00:55:48,853 --> 00:55:51,390
English have a
awonderful thing.

1006
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,391
Extramarital affair.
You too should have one.

1007
00:55:54,953 --> 00:55:57,126
But I am not used to having
English affairs.

1008
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,233
Have I asked you to fire some
NASA missile ?

1009
00:55:59,753 --> 00:56:01,391
I only asked you to have an
exira marital affair outside.

1010
00:56:01,787 --> 00:56:03,664
But no one knows me outside?

1011
00:56:03,753 --> 00:56:05,790
Then begin in inside.
So don't have to step outside.

1012
00:56:07,053 --> 00:56:08,123
No, I will be a sinner.

1013
00:56:08,253 --> 00:56:11,325
The way my condition is inside,
I'd say it won't be any sin.

1014
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:14,165
You'll be a sinner, if I ask you
to sail in two boats.

1015
00:56:14,353 --> 00:56:17,891
Divorce Paali,
and marry a jolly fellow.

1016
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,722
Mister Subedar!

1017
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,833
For your information, there is
no post of Mister Subedar in army.

1018
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:24,589
And also my father had said...

1019
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:27,297
A sage's female devotee and
soldiers girlfriend..

1020
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,860
...Is never deceived.

1021
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,295
Do you understand,
Mrs. Chhada?

1022
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,094
Please don't call me
Mrs. Chhada.

1023
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,630
I feel like a man.
- Fine. I won't.

1024
00:56:34,786 --> 00:56:37,858
So could I henceforth call you
Mrs. Chhadi?

1025
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,828
God!

1026
00:56:39,087 --> 00:56:41,727
"Red damsel standing
on a field"

1027
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,790

Then you've only seen uncle

00:57:14,787 --> 00:57:16,767
You have never seen him
soaring.

1033
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:18,998
How dare you come to my house?

1034

00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,061
Whatever the share
I have already paid.

1037

for him to make her the owner.

1063
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,793
This Shorty talks too much.

1064
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:15,957
Shameless!

Rascal, I shall teach you lesson.

1074

This way?

1084
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:32,888
Not this kind.

1085
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,432
Enough now. Will you feed me
curd and make me curdle.

Take it away.
I wanna eat.

Sweety, at least pick up
the phone.

1088
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:47,724
Go it. Got the house
vacated?

1089
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:50,831
Such goons, cannot even
get bus seat vacated"

1090
00:59:50,953 --> 00:59:52,432
"forget about the house.

1091
00:59:52,553 --> 00:59:53,657
What actually happened?

1092
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,024
Can't you see our injuries?

1093
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,491
So you got beaten up?
- No, roof fell over us.

1094
00:59:58,853 --> 00:59:59,923
How is it possible?

1095
01:00:00,153 --> 01:00:02,861
Buddy, my baddies never
got beaten up ever.

1096
01:00:02,953 --> 01:00:05,433
Of course they did not get beat
from man, but got it from woman.

1097
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,630
Hey, Pidya!

1098
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,966
Why did not I die
before I could here this!

1099
01:00:10,053 --> 01:00:12,499
Is this fellow a doctor?
How'd he know why you didn't die?

1100
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,462
But friend, see the courage
of my men..

1101
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,594
"Despite being thrashed so badly
they have brought you back.

1102
01:00:18,687 --> 01:00:20,496
What goons?
They are lkie cowards.

1103
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:23,431
Happy, why are you
discouraging me?

1104
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,427
If I wasn't on medical leave today"

1105
01:00:25,653 --> 01:00:28,930
...I'd have personally come and
got your uncle's house evicted.

1106
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:33,529
Who asked you to learn
cycling in this age?

1107
01:00:33,587 --> 01:00:35,589
You aren't the one who can
take up a goon's job.

1108
01:00:35,753 --> 01:00:38,563
Return my money, I will hire
someone better to do my job.

1109
01:00:38,853 --> 01:00:41,561
Buddy, I have paid 20000 hospital
bill from your money.

1110
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:43,633
Where is the money now?
- So give me a cheque.

1111
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:46,527
We goons don't have
any cheque of anything such.

1112
01:00:46,753 --> 01:00:48,755
Just, give me more chance.

1113
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:52,391
Then I shall personally come
and get your uncle's house vacated.

1114
01:00:52,587 --> 01:00:54,931
If I don't, then do what you like.

1115
01:01:00,586 --> 01:01:02,998
I proposed an album.
Miss Pooia does not agree.

1116
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,089
Is it?

1117
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,928
Where do you stay?

1118
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:07,065

1124

1125
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:19,957
Too much, miss.
- Yes?

1126
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,732
Now... I mean,

1127
01:01:23,553 --> 01:01:24,861

Come in, meet with your
sister and go.

1132
01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:43,624
Brother-in-law isn't home
right now.

1133
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,425
But he's in sister's heart.

1134
01:01:45,586 --> 01:01:47,065
As long he is out of her heart".

1135
01:01:47,753 --> 01:01:48,788
...I will not meet.

1136
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:51,431
Let God remove your animosity
from within your hearts.

1137
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,521
Here is the money.

1138
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,030

No, I have the money.

1140
01:01:56,886 --> 01:01:58,024
No let it be.

...I am not gonnalose

01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:03,858
Nothing. You just let it be.

All right.

1145
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:06,661

Yes.

1158
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,422
So suddenly, without informing?

1159
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,395
Yeah, I am here to surprise.

Someone special.

1163
01:02:49,586 --> 01:02:51,463
Someone special?
And you didn't even tell me.

1164
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,530
Jasmeet!

1165
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,260

Hi, Laadi.
- Hello.

1168
01:03:00,387 --> 01:03:01,798
You know, I met your brother.

1169
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,494
Don't tell me.
You know, I hate him.

1170
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,894
The boy is good.

1171
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,865
But he's against our marriage.

1172
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,722
Many times he even raised
hands on my husband.

1173
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,363
However.

1174
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:12,864
Me too am sitting
talking about myself

1175
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,763
I mean, I am standing
and talking about myself.

1176
01:03:14,887 --> 01:03:16,798
He must be here now.
I will make a move.

1177
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:18,630
Okay.
- Bye! Bye.

1178
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,463
Bye, Laadi!
- Bye, sis-in-law.

1179
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:22,890
Bye.

1180
01:03:24,287 --> 01:03:25,891
Their entire familyis
a bit eccentric.

1181
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,498
Comelefs go in.

1182
01:03:29,653 --> 01:03:30,461
Sit.

1183
01:03:30,786 --> 01:03:33,460
Now tell me, you found a guy
and did not even tell me?

1184
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:37,300
Actually, nothing is finalized
with my folk.

1185
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:40,861
In fact, I have told my daddy
that I am here to meet you.

1186
01:03:41,253 --> 01:03:42,857
If he calls,
please handle it.

1187
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,194
Where does the boy stay?

1188
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,160

01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,364
0k, have a seat.
I will get you some tea.

1190
01:03:59,320 --> 01:03:59,889
Jass!

1191
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:06,429
When you come early,
at least tidy up the home.

1192
01:04:06,553 --> 01:04:08,658
Why do you go on to build
muscles with ladies dress?

1193
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,697
Also, at least remove
these accessories.

1194
01:04:10,886 --> 01:04:12,490
If they are ruined,
from where will we get them?

1195
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,297
Hey, listen.

1196
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,466
Hsrt of all I work for you,
and then listen too?

1197
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:18,858
It won't do.

1198
01:04:21,387 --> 01:04:23,833
I mean, please don't
quarrel with me like this.

1199
01:04:24,387 --> 01:04:25,889
I am married to you.

1200
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:27,496
Hey, why are you so loving?

1201
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,729
Is it the first time?

1202
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:31,894
Oh, so if it is so..

1203
01:04:32,353 --> 01:04:33,798
...then please make tea
for you husband.

1204
01:04:34,253 --> 01:04:35,698
Cook for him.

1205
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:37,557
Right now I'll get it.

1206
01:04:39,253 --> 01:04:40,425
Come, Laadi sis.

1207
01:04:45,553 --> 01:04:46,554
Laadi !

1208
01:05:00,653 --> 01:05:00,785
Getlost guys!

1209
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:01,787
Getlost guys!

1210
01:05:01,886 --> 01:05:03,729
I am not gonna destroy
my affair for you!

1211
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,528
I am going to tell Laadi
everything.

1212
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:07,355
Have you lost you mind.

1213
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:10,229
She'll go tell Jasmeet an
Jasmeet will tell Subedar.

1214
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:11,631
She won't.

1215
01:05:11,853 --> 01:05:14,163
Hero! Girls can't digest anything.

1216
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,264
She can digest, man.

1217
01:05:15,353 --> 01:05:17,560
She can digest.
How? Does she wrestle?

1218
01:05:17,653 --> 01:05:19,155
Damn you, why talk nonsense.

1219
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:22,459
I still tell you, pleaseiusi be
don't be so selfish just for house..

1220
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,758
...we can find some other
house too.

1221
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,724
But once my Laadi gets married
somewhere else..

1222
01:05:25,887 --> 01:05:28,333
...I will be of no avail.
- Okay, do this.

1223
01:05:28,453 --> 01:05:30,194
As it is, earlier too we
have managed with lies, right?

1224
01:05:30,253 --> 01:05:32,665
So tell one more lie to Laddi,
why you got married.

1225
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,197
If it does not work,
then tell the truth.

1226
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,164
Also, we hardly have few bags,
we'l walk out with it.

1227
01:05:38,487 --> 01:05:39,625
But what lie should I give her?

1228
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,198
Tell her that she's Laden's sister,
he threatened an got me married.

1229
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,357
Now stop it.
I will think of something.

1230
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:46,389
But don't you come before her.

1231
01:05:46,453 --> 01:05:49,400
If she recognizes her all
four of us will be ruined.

1232
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,600
Hey! The King of Diamonds!

1233
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:53,426
All of our cards are rubbish,
go and..

1234
01:05:53,553 --> 01:05:55,533
"Take care of your Queen of Flowers.
- Get lost.

1235
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,390
Sister!

1236
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,555
Get lost!

1237
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:00,196
He's gone to bring
your other woman.

1238
01:06:04,353 --> 01:06:05,229
Laadi !

1239
01:06:06,153 --> 01:06:07,154
Why are you here?

1240
01:06:07,387 --> 01:06:09,230
Just to see whether your Laadi
is dead or alive?

1241
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:11,128
I can't see my Laadi crying.

1242
01:06:11,353 --> 01:06:12,229
That's whyl am here.

1243
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,199
Jass, please!
Don't give me more lies.

1244
01:06:16,087 --> 01:06:18,431
Such a great deception?
What was my fault?

1245
01:06:18,553 --> 01:06:20,464
Dear, I had to do it
out of compulsion.

1246
01:06:20,753 --> 01:06:23,290
What was such compulsion
that you had to get married.

1247
01:06:23,353 --> 01:06:24,559
Actually, I was going
on a scooter"

1248
01:06:24,687 --> 01:06:26,667
...and Piniki's daddy was
spraying tar on the road.

1249
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,664
My scooter dashed against him
and he suffered from Polio.

1250
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,391
Polio?
That too with a scooter?

1251
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,622
No. Because he fell
on the hot tar.

1252
01:06:35,053 --> 01:06:38,466
When people took him out, his
body was stiff like the hard road.

1253
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:41,295
I took him on my damaged scooter
to the hospital.

1254
01:06:41,486 --> 01:06:43,693
Doctor gave him an injection
to save him ..

1255
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,158
...and as the body was hard
from tar, they could not inject

1256
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:50,092
Doctor, used hammer to
break the hardened tar.

1257
01:06:50,387 --> 01:06:53,129
Forget braking tar,
his 8 tolo bones broke.

1258
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,558
And then he got Polio.

1259
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:58,200
But what does all these things
have to do with your marriage?

1260
01:06:58,287 --> 01:06:59,698
Sorry, what nonsense I've talked.

1261
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:03,429
Actually, when I was brining
Pinki's daddy from hospital.

1262
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,022
...he informed me that
Pinki suffers from cancer.

1263
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,656
And she's gonna pop of
within two months.

1264
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,764
His daddy's wish was the
she dies as married woman.

1265
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,129
So, for sake of humanity
I could not stop.

1266
01:07:13,387 --> 01:07:14,661
And I got married.

1267
01:07:17,053 --> 01:07:18,225
But J ass?
- Yes?

1268
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,261
You did not think about me
even once?

1269
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,663
Of course I thought of you,
ever breath.

1270
01:07:22,187 --> 01:07:24,394
It's been 20 days for our wedding
We still sleep separately.

1271
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,124
That too facing in
opposite direction

1272
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,294
Why?

1273
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,425
Pinki's last wish is to
be a married woman"

1274
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,324
...not a mother.

1275
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:36,297
Oh, Jass.
How pure you of heart.

1276
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:38,558
I know.
So you pardoned me, haven't you?

1277
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:40,561
Yeah.
- Thank you.

1278
01:07:40,653 --> 01:07:42,155
Okay, I will make my
daddy understand"

1279
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:44,397
"but you better get free soon.

1280
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,099
The we will get married.

1281
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:48,228
Now we can't kill Pinki
on our own..

1282
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,490
...you wait a while..

1283
01:07:49,553 --> 01:07:51,362
...we'll get married on
the fourth day of her death.

1284
01:07:52,353 --> 01:07:53,195
Hmm.

1285
01:07:53,753 --> 01:07:55,699
How wrong I took
Pinki sis-in-law.

1286
01:07:56,053 --> 01:07:59,398
Hey! Not sis-in-law,
we'll be brother and sister

1287
01:07:59,586 --> 01:08:01,065
You are right.
Sorry.

1288
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,163
I will go meet Pinki.

1289
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,364
Bird fly!
- flew.

1290
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,625
Crow, fly.
- Flew.

1291
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,693
Cow, fly.
- How can a cow fly'?

1292
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,200
The way you made Jass fly,
can't you fly this?

1293
01:08:16,353 --> 01:08:18,196
Now go ahead continue.

1294
01:08:18,453 --> 01:08:20,399
No. - Donkey fly?
- It can't be.

1295
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,165
Okay, at least fly
something now.

1296
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:23,354
Now who is here?

1297
01:08:23,486 --> 01:08:24,430
Lover boy is here.

1298
01:08:24,553 --> 01:08:25,964
Watch out if he is your guy.

1299
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,031
Is he's Subedar guy,
we'll bury him her today.

1300
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:29,566
I know what you mean.
- I'll be back.

1301
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,063
Rascal, has harassed us.

1302
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,923
God knows, when this ladies
dress headache will go.

1303
01:08:37,053 --> 01:08:38,293
Pinki, sis-in-law!

1304
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:40,561
Pinki, sis-in-law!

1305
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,321
Laadi !

1306
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,258
Sorry, Pinki!

1307
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,264
I am so sorry,
I took you so wrong.

1308
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,957
Jass told me about your daddy.

1309
01:08:51,053 --> 01:08:52,464
About my daddy?
- Yes.

1310
01:08:52,686 --> 01:08:55,257
What happened to daddy
was so good.

1311
01:08:55,453 --> 01:08:56,955
Thank you so much.

1312
01:08:57,053 --> 01:08:59,329
I can understand how greatly
shocked you must be.

1313
01:08:59,453 --> 01:09:00,397
Shock?

1314
01:09:00,987 --> 01:09:03,661
By the way, how many days
still she has?

1315
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:05,555
It at least take nine months.

1316
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,263
Did not you get her treated
with some local medicine.

1317
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,264
For her we got it done,
but he is still left.

1318
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,199
Yesterday, I read on a banner
asking childless people to meet.

1319
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:16,491
No, no!
I am talking about the cancer.

1320
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:17,623
Who has the cancer?

1321
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,159
Who has the cancer?

1322
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:20,095
To you.

1323
01:09:20,153 --> 01:09:20,995
Me?

1324
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:23,589
Neeru sis-in-law,
Cancer... Pinki has it.

1325
01:09:23,987 --> 01:09:25,989
Oh! No.

1326
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:27,430
Who has cancer?
Cancer isn't there at all.

1327
01:09:27,553 --> 01:09:29,055
There is nothing called cancer.

1328
01:09:29,186 --> 01:09:32,895
This should be the spirit of
woman to fight with the cancer.

1329
01:09:33,153 --> 01:09:35,599
All of you say...
"Women unite"

1330
01:09:35,986 --> 01:09:37,329
Neeru sis-in-law!
Control.

1331
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:38,224
<i>0K9!'</i>

1332
01:09:38,353 --> 01:09:39,354
Control.
- What?

1333
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,898
Nothing.

1334
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,461
Why have you
hidden your face?

1335
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:44,831
She has caner..

1336
01:09:44,953 --> 01:09:48,196
...so let her shadow may not fall
on yet tobe born child, that's why.

1337
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:50,990
Yes.
- Is that so?

1338
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,232
By the way, your should take
special care of her.

1339
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,230
Promise.

1340
01:09:57,453 --> 01:09:59,091
Full promise.
Hey!

1341
01:10:00,553 --> 01:10:03,557
If anything happens,
immediately call me.

1342
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,360
If something happens to me..

1343
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:09,025
...then he's the one who will
call you, 'cause I'll be dead.

1344
01:10:09,353 --> 01:10:12,027
But be sure to attend
my last rites.

1345
01:10:12,253 --> 01:10:13,561
I will be so glad.

1346
01:10:13,853 --> 01:10:16,390
Oh, please Pinki.
Don't say that.

1347
01:10:16,987 --> 01:10:18,898
Why not spend your
last days happily.

1348
01:10:19,054 --> 01:10:20,362
Enjoy them.

1349
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,265
You just keep coming like this"

1350
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:24,328
...it's my enioyement.

1351
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,567
And you.
You should be beside her.

1352
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:29,330
Cancer does not spread
like this.

1353
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:32,023
Sure. I promise.

1354
01:10:34,353 --> 01:10:36,856
Pinki. Take care of yourself.

1355
01:10:39,287 --> 01:10:40,527
I will make a move.

1356
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,157
Come, lefs go.

1357
01:10:43,487 --> 01:10:45,057
Okay, Bye, bye!

1358
01:10:46,487 --> 01:10:49,127
Oh, she hugged us!
Damn you guys!

1359
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,196
You were hugging a lot,
should I teach you now...

1360
01:10:52,287 --> 01:10:53,027
You are...

1361
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,760
One in ladies suit
can hug another.

1362
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,763
Hey, look.

1363
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:05,499
Watch brother, what are you doing?

1364
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,230
Are you giving us water
or creating mud down here.

1365
01:11:09,053 --> 01:11:10,293
Seems he is nuts.

1366
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,830
Hello.
- Welcome.

1367
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,829

1368
01:11:34,987 --> 01:11:36,022
<i>Take.</i>

1369
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,231

...you aren't aware.

1388
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:18,527
<i>Miss Ram!</i>

1389
01:15:18,653 --> 01:15:20,826
Some palmist had told me..

1390
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,726
...that I would get marry
to some scholl teacher.

1391
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:26,124
And the one who has
Peeple tree in her courtyard.

1392
01:15:26,553 --> 01:15:27,725
Sure, it's peeple isn't it?

1393
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:31,493
Now I will go.
It's too late.

1394
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,031
Also my sister too has come.

1395
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:35,091
Fine then.

1396
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,200
<i>Ram!
- '(ml?</i>

1397
01:15:46,553 --> 01:15:47,759
Who was that guy?

1398
01:15:48,654 --> 01:15:49,189
He?

1399
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,628
Paali.

1400
01:15:51,187 --> 01:15:52,757
He worked in this village.

1401
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,563
What does he do?

1402
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,925
He's doing his DPic
in poultry farming.

1403
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,593
DPic? - Yes.

1404
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,593
He rears chicken.

1405
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,164
He had organised a Shabil
so he came to drop me.

1406
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,128
Is itiusi that, isn't it?

1407
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,092
What do you think?

1408
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,522
Boy is good, isn't it?

1409
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,530
Our cable guy Jelly too was good.

1410
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,064
An we also liked each other
a lot.

1411
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:24,760
I used to fault my cable
in order to see him.

1412
01:16:25,787 --> 01:16:28,461
If at that time, mom and dad
had not made me see right.

1413
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:32,768
"And would not have got me
married to your bro-in-law".

1414
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:35,866
...so, perhaps, I could not have
given bright future to my kids.

1415
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,500
But sis, it's also possible..

1416
01:16:38,887 --> 01:16:41,561
"That Palli may work hard
and be well settled tomorrow.

1417
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:45,024
What future holds for us..

1418
01:16:45,187 --> 01:16:46,962
...none of us is aware of it.

1419
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,993
These romantic talks
of stars and moons..

1420
01:16:50,487 --> 01:16:53,627
...when it comes down to the
issue of milk and upkeep..

1421
01:16:54,154 --> 01:16:56,657
...then you realize the truth of life.

1422
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,057
Jelli, even today goes around
connecting cables.

1423
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,164
When I see him I get scared.

1424
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,667
If I had married him..

1425
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,424
"What would my life have been?

1426
01:17:07,554 --> 01:17:09,556
But, sister. It's not necessary"

1427
01:17:09,987 --> 01:17:12,126
...that what happend to Jelli
the same will happend to Palli too?

1428
01:17:13,453 --> 01:17:15,490
Look, Hano. I can understand.

1429
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,857
The corner at which you
are stainding"

1430
01:17:18,153 --> 01:17:21,896
...I had returned from that
corner ten years earlier.

1431
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:25,431
Yet I am not repenfing it.

1432
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,060
I am your elder sister.

1433
01:17:27,487 --> 01:17:29,023
I won't wish ill of you.

1434
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,761
My younger brother-in-law
is returning from Canada next week.

1435
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,965
He has seen your photo.

1436
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:36,093
From him it's almost yes.

1437
01:17:36,687 --> 01:17:38,792
Mom-dad to like this alliance.

1438
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:42,796
Rest, you are wise.
Decision is yours.

1439
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,855

01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,093
Jass.l can't see you.

1444
01:18:20,387 --> 01:18:22,367
Whatever you want,

1445
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,996
Theh why on phone also?
I will send a message.

01:18:25,353 --> 01:18:27,731
Come on, don't act now.

1447
01:18:30,354 --> 01:18:31,731
If some one see us then?

All of them are fast asleep.
It's secret meeting.

1449
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:37,461
Come on, man!
- Okay. Fine.

1450

1451
01:18:56,887 --> 01:18:58,525
What is it now?

Come now.

1453
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:02,964
No one wil see.
What's such a secret meeting...

1454
01:19:03,053 --> 01:19:04,862
first you come along,
lwll let you know.

1455
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:07,363
What this guyis
doing in middle of night?

1456
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,694
Why has he gone UP?

1457
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,390
Damn!

1458
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,462
Now you could find only
m y dam e?

1459
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,231
Hey, Palli!
- Let me sleep, man.

1460
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,792
Where are they now?

1461
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:02,360
Seems, again on some mischief.

1462
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,966
Okay, till me what was the
secret talk?

1463
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,457
Seeing you reminds me
of a couplet.

1464
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,526
Is that so? Which one?

1465
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,622
'How beautiful this night is'

1466
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:17,196
'A moon in the sky,
and one is beside me'

1467
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:19,389
Wow! Is it over?

1468
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:20,961
Now tell me what
you wanted to talk.

1469
01:20:33,487 --> 01:20:35,330
Thief! Thief!

1470
01:20:35,453 --> 01:20:36,431
Catch him! Catch.

1471
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:38,430
Let him not escape.
Get hold of him! Catch him.

1472
01:20:38,487 --> 01:20:40,262
Catch him. Hold him.

1473
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:41,730
I am not athief, sir.

1474
01:20:41,987 --> 01:20:43,762
Let me off, Subedar sir.
- Subedar?

1475
01:20:43,887 --> 01:20:45,594
How do you know I am Subedar?

1476
01:20:46,353 --> 01:20:49,163
I read it on the name plate
on the door.

1477
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:51,267
Damn you, my door hardly
has a latch on the door.

1478
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,660
Who could have put
a neme plate on it?

1479
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,890
Who are you after all?

1480
01:20:54,687 --> 01:20:56,496
Show me your face.
Turn this way.

1481
01:20:56,653 --> 01:21:00,533
Hey, your face is so similar
to that of Neeru.

1482
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,222
I am her twin brother.

1483
01:21:05,353 --> 01:21:07,594
How could all the twins
have gathered at my palce?

1484
01:21:07,687 --> 01:21:08,757
Why are you here?

1485
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,763
Came to see my sister.
- At this hour?

1486
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,366
So late at night, even lovers
do not go to meettheir girlfriends.

1487
01:21:16,453 --> 01:21:17,659
And you are here to meet
your sister?

1488
01:21:18,953 --> 01:21:21,365
Yeah. After 12 tonight it's
the festival of Hakhi.

1489
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:24,290
My bro-in-law beats me a lot.
He does not let me meet her.

1490
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,457
So I came on the sly to get the
Hakhi thread tied rom her.

1491
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,655
In your undrwears?

1492
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,389
Wearing such vulgar attire"

1493
01:21:29,487 --> 01:21:30,761
...a person does not even
go near his sleepin sister"

1494
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,263
...and you're here to wake her up?

1495
01:21:32,353 --> 01:21:34,458
Your bro-in-law will beat later,
I will thrash you first.

1496
01:21:39,387 --> 01:21:41,594
What happend Mr. Subedar?
- Bro-in-law is here. - Where?

1497
01:21:44,753 --> 01:21:47,165
Jass, you said it's a secret meeting?

1498
01:21:47,254 --> 01:21:49,734
How was I to know?
I had kept it a secret.

1499
01:21:50,387 --> 01:21:53,129
What kind of secret meeting is this?
Entire family is gathred here!

1500
01:21:53,487 --> 01:21:55,489
What all this noise is about?
- What nois I've created?

1501
01:21:55,653 --> 01:21:57,690
Your brother-in-law was here.
- What in-law of mine?

1502
01:21:57,853 --> 01:21:59,628
One who does not recall
even his wife..

1503
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,165
...how'd he know about
his bro-in-law?

1504
01:22:01,387 --> 01:22:03,230
Neeru's twin brother was here.

1505
01:22:07,754 --> 01:22:10,200
Oh that one. - You must've
thought the some other one.

1506
01:22:10,353 --> 01:22:12,458
What do you mean?
Nothing, go and sleep now.

1507
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:16,628
Why did you get and come
at mid night.

1508
01:22:18,253 --> 01:22:19,630
What happend?
What was to happen"

1509
01:22:19,787 --> 01:22:21,232
...your twin brohter had com e.

1510
01:22:21,387 --> 01:22:23,230
Came to get the sacred thread tied,
and went with bandged knee.

1511
01:22:23,387 --> 01:22:24,627
Oh, my brother's knee!

1512
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,390
Why did not you stop him?

1513
01:22:27,487 --> 01:22:29,057
Could I have stopped him
bandaging his other knee?

1514
01:22:29,287 --> 01:22:30,823
Fellow slipped through
my hands as if..

1515
01:22:31,087 --> 01:22:34,296
...a girl slips through the hand
of her brother-in-law.

1516
01:22:34,453 --> 01:22:36,399
Now tie brothers' pious thread
on his hands. - What?

1517
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,397
Nothing.
We'll talk in morning.

1518
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,324
All right. Com e.

1519
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,693
He is taking upstairs as if she's
gonaa be with him all her life.

1520
01:22:44,553 --> 01:22:46,760
You are sitting here, I was
looking for you in the classroom.

1521
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,793
Yeah?
I have a phone too.

1522
01:22:50,087 --> 01:22:51,657
Why are you talking so
rudely now?

1523
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,526
My sister called.

1524
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,460
Whatever is happening at home..

1525
01:22:56,453 --> 01:22:57,659
...Isn't right.

1526
01:22:58,054 --> 01:22:59,328
So you've have found out.

1527
01:23:00,087 --> 01:23:01,589
Now you see what a
married guy is doing.

1528
01:23:01,753 --> 01:23:04,495
What a married guy can do
if the oppiste side is wrong?

1529
01:23:05,053 --> 01:23:07,499
Oh yeah!
You too find falut with the girl.

1530
01:23:08,087 --> 01:23:09,498
Fault is that of bro-in-law too.

1531
01:23:13,087 --> 01:23:14,191
I am feel sad.

1532
01:23:15,387 --> 01:23:17,333
The person who had
such a place in my heart".

1533
01:23:18,053 --> 01:23:19,726
...he is talking such away
before me.

1534
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,431
Babbu, I accept that
the girl too is at fault

1535
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,600
But Jass is more at fault, isn't it?

1536
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,598
It was Jass who called Laadi
on the terrace.

1537
01:23:28,053 --> 01:23:29,293
What? Called Laadi?

1538
01:23:30,187 --> 01:23:32,030
Yes, I also followed them
to the terrace"

1539
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,565
...so that I can make them
understand there itself.

1540
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,166
But before that a big hullabaloo
was created.

1541
01:23:36,353 --> 01:23:38,390
Oh, so this was the matter!

1542
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,558
See, this why I hate bro-in-law
for his such acts.

1543
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,358
His entire family is such.

1544
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:46,096
Your hatred is also justified.

1545
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,631
You too are right.

1546
01:23:48,587 --> 01:23:50,089
It was not Laadi's fault.

1547
01:23:50,387 --> 01:23:52,628
So soon you agreed with me?

1548
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,693
Thatl have to for my
entire life.

1549
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,600
Meaning?
- It means"

1550
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:02,362
...that I've something in my heart
which I want to speak out.

1551
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:07,567
I want to marry you Jasmeet.

1552
01:24:11,587 --> 01:24:13,328
What happend?
Why are you quiet?

1553
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,599
You'll have to talk to me uncle.
- That I will do.

1554
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,167
Not alone. You will have to bring
along your sister Pinki too.

1555
01:24:20,387 --> 01:24:23,300
So that uncle finds you
a bit of family guy.

1556
01:24:24,587 --> 01:24:26,225
What happend?
Why are you lost?

1557
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:29,658
All right. First sister will have
atalk than I will.

1558
01:24:30,087 --> 01:24:32,465
Not at all. Both of you together
and that too today.

01:24:33,487 --> 01:24:35,194

01:24:35,554 --> 01:24:36,589
Today it's festival of Hakhi"

1561
01:24:36,687 --> 01:24:40,066
"and on the pretext of getting the
sacred thread tied, talk to her too.

1562
01:24:40,553 --> 01:24:42,226
You are against your
brother-m-law, isn't it?

1563
01:24:42,353 --> 01:24:43,991
Not with your sister, right.

1564
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:49,196
Today is Hakhi, man. Be my
brother and pose as my sister.

1565
01:24:49,287 --> 01:24:52,325
Get lost! Some times you make me
Neeru and sometimes you sister.

1566
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:55,635
Buddy, actually Jasmeet wants that
I get thread tied from my sister..

1567
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:57,431
"And she has to talk about
my alliance too.

1568
01:24:57,687 --> 01:24:59,928
It can only be done by you,
so please accept it as brother.

1569
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:01,624
What has to be done?

1570
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,326
Pinki, sis-in-law!
- She's here.

1571
01:25:05,287 --> 01:25:07,995
Everything will be fine, sister.
Everyting will be.

01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:09,427
What happend to you, sis?

1573
01:25:09,553 --> 01:25:11,260
Her cancer is in last stages.

1574
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:13,499
What do you mean?
Her cancer is in terminal.

1575
01:25:13,653 --> 01:25:17,066
Look, what conditon she is in.
Shivering so much due to cold.

1576
01:25:18,254 --> 01:25:21,895
If she's feeling cold,
why are you fanning her?

1577
01:25:23,487 --> 01:25:25,489
I had heated this fan on
the hotplate"

1578
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,622
...so that she may get
some warm air. Yeah.

1579
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,166
Everything will be find.

1580
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,355

How do you know he is

1584
01:25:48,487 --> 01:25:49,727
I can guess.

1585

You take care of her, please.

1590
01:26:03,587 --> 01:26:05,032
I will leave now.

1591
01:26:08,487 --> 01:26:10,125

1594
01:26:16,387 --> 01:26:17,457
Get up, damn you.

1595
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,995
Unncessarily made me
fan you for an hour.

1596
01:26:21,587 --> 01:26:23,965
Uncle, your newspaper.

1597
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,529
Onion is Rs. 100/kg? Its not like
onion, Its like liquor bottle.

1598
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,527
I am gonna buy vegitables.
- Let's go.

1599
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:34,555
No, no.

1600
01:26:35,353 --> 01:26:37,299
I am going alone.
- What?

1601
01:26:39,353 --> 01:26:41,856
She is saying as if she is
informing a hubby and going.

1602
01:26:42,954 --> 01:26:44,991
Seems, things are getting positive.

1603
01:27:15,187 --> 01:27:15,286
You are back?
- Who's back?

1604
01:27:15,287 --> 01:27:16,288
You are back?
- Who's back?

1605
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,257
Uncle, he's Mr. Babu Kirtpuriya.

1606
01:27:19,453 --> 01:27:20,523
My respects, sir.

1607
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,793
Your respects are fine...

1608
01:27:23,287 --> 01:27:25,358
Don't you think as if Pniki
has clipped her hair and come?

1609
01:27:25,953 --> 01:27:27,830
Uncle, I had told you,
they are twins.

1610
01:27:27,987 --> 01:27:29,967
They have really made me mad!

1611
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:33,367
Seems, their mother's had bet
and gave birth to two twins.

1612
01:27:33,787 --> 01:27:36,131
Jasmeet, did you call me for this?

1613
01:27:36,254 --> 01:27:38,359
I came with a marriage proposal
and he is insulting me.

1614
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,962
Should we do upstairs?
- You're too much in hurry?

1615
01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:43,794
We shall go upstairs,
but why is this plate?

1616
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,228
I just picked it up.

1617
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:48,060
If you had to just pick up,
you could have picked a bucket.

1618
01:27:48,187 --> 01:27:50,895
At least impression would be
that a Jat's daughter milched a cow.

1619
01:27:51,087 --> 01:27:52,862
However, what's in that plate?

1620
01:27:54,087 --> 01:27:55,828
It's Hakhi thread.
- Sacred thred?

1621
01:27:56,487 --> 01:27:57,989
Are you making him a brother
while getting engaged to him?

1622
01:27:58,287 --> 01:28:00,198
Dear, she belongs to your cast.

1623
01:28:00,354 --> 01:28:01,458
<i>We are Jan chm.</i>

1624
01:28:01,854 --> 01:28:04,300
In our engagements either a ring
is brought or a rifle.

1625
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,992
I am not gonna tied to thread.
Pinki Sis-in-law is going to do it.

1626
01:28:08,153 --> 01:28:09,860
Yeah.
Now come up.

1627
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,465
Pinki sis-in-law is in bad conditon.

1628
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:12,891
<i>When' s wrong with Pink?!?</i>

1629
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,121
She has cancer.

1630
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,996
Thank God, I got afraid that
she is seriously ill.

1631
01:28:17,854 --> 01:28:19,128
Hey, is he all right?

1632
01:28:22,954 --> 01:28:24,456
When she came she was
so hale and hearty.

1633
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:25,990
And she fell sick at once.

1634
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,827
Panki sis-in-law,
see who is here.

1635
01:28:27,953 --> 01:28:29,023
I will see.

1636
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,094
Sis, are you all right?

1637
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:35,061
No, no. Don't you speak.
If you coughed...

1638
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,027
...then everyone will
get the can cer.l

1639
01:28:37,753 --> 01:28:39,289
ls cancer a contegioius disease?

1640
01:28:39,854 --> 01:28:41,265
Lest Neeru too get it!

1641
01:28:41,787 --> 01:28:43,926
And they also bathe together!
Uncle!

1642
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,259
Sis, I want to get married to
Jasmeet.

1643
01:28:46,787 --> 01:28:47,925
Do you approve of it?

1644
01:28:50,453 --> 01:28:53,866
Hey, not even a borther signals like
that the way your sister is giving.

1645
01:28:54,853 --> 01:28:56,992
Actually, no one has ever
signled my sister.

1646
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,192
The poor she, does not even know,
how to signal and when.

1647
01:29:00,353 --> 01:29:03,891
Yeah! As if our daughters have
grown up giving bad signals!

1648
01:29:05,787 --> 01:29:07,027
And now what's she signaling?

1649
01:29:07,154 --> 01:29:09,065
She asking whether you
approve of this alliance?

1650
01:29:09,254 --> 01:29:11,063
Speak up, uncle.
ls the boy okay?

1651
01:29:11,253 --> 01:29:14,359
Though the boy seems okay,
but I don't feel his sister is okay.

1652
01:29:14,987 --> 01:29:16,057
She has cancer.

1653
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,698
Come now.
From uncle's side it's okay.

1654
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,366
Sister-in-law, you fie this
sacred thread of Hakhi on him.

1655
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:23,755
Not the Hakhi thread.
She's suffering form cancer.

1656
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,158
It's just cancer.

1657
01:29:25,287 --> 01:29:27,152
She's not paralyszzed that
she can't move her limbs.

1658
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:28,154
Tue the thread.

1659
01:29:28,387 --> 01:29:30,663
Here take this. Somehow
tie this Fiakhi thread.

1660
01:29:30,753 --> 01:29:32,255
"Brother get this scared
thread tied from your sister"

1661
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:35,824
Take off the blanket.
- Oh, no. She's feeling cold.

1662
01:29:35,987 --> 01:29:38,126
Come on, are we getting this
thread tied in Tundra.

1663
01:29:38,287 --> 01:29:40,198
I am just saying it because
of her sickness.

1664
01:29:40,687 --> 01:29:41,859
Here it is, she tied it.

1665
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,955
Get the annoinment.

1666
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,925
Is it okay now.
Should we go?

1667
01:29:49,687 --> 01:29:50,791
Oh God!

1668
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:53,899
As it is she takes so long to raise
her hand! Now what she says?

1669
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,225
Sister says,get married
befoe she dies.

1670
01:29:56,353 --> 01:29:59,027
Man, is she gonna turn over
in the marriage?

1671
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,657
Let's go. One should not stand
long with a cancer patient.

1672
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:05,759
Fine sister. Take care.
- Ok, sister-in-law,

1673
01:30:05,953 --> 01:30:07,193
Cheers!

1674
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,765
Come on, Babbu!

1675
01:30:14,987 --> 01:30:16,295
Now your job is done.

1676
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,791
Isn't yours done too?
- With whom it is?

1677
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,058
Isn't it with Mr. Subdar
it's done?

1678
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,622
Yeah, I shall break a bottle
on his head.

1679
01:30:22,787 --> 01:30:23,891
Here take this and
do it quick.

1680
01:30:24,087 --> 01:30:25,998
No, it's full. I'll empty it
and then break it on him.

1681
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,324
But to tell you, this Subedar
has harried me a lot.

1682
01:30:29,987 --> 01:30:31,762
Sometimes, he will call me,
"Sweetie, sweetie"..

1683
01:30:32,087 --> 01:30:35,728
...some time he will come with
sweets or chikens to impress.

1684
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,294
Acts like a big lover!

1685
01:30:40,987 --> 01:30:43,194
Hey, how is my Neeru?

1686
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:47,759
O Neeru how are you doing?

1687
01:30:47,854 --> 01:30:49,663
Guys, these fools have
spoilled me with drinks.

1688
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,825
What was she saying?

1689
01:30:52,653 --> 01:30:54,690
Don'd disturb me...

1690
01:30:54,987 --> 01:30:56,261
She vomitting!

1691
01:30:57,053 --> 01:30:58,259
<i>New“!</i>

1692
01:31:01,187 --> 01:31:03,189
Neeru!
You drowned!

1693
01:31:04,087 --> 01:31:06,192
What have you done?
Nothing has happend.

1694
01:31:06,287 --> 01:31:08,289
You say nothing has happend.
Everything has happend.

1695
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,724
I waned you alone. Not,
buy one get one free.

1696
01:31:11,787 --> 01:31:14,859
At least listen to me.
What's left to listen now?

1697
01:31:15,087 --> 01:31:16,794
You said, you don't get along
well with your husband..

1698
01:31:16,953 --> 01:31:18,159
"And if it was otherwise,
what would've been the outcome?

1699
01:31:18,554 --> 01:31:20,158
You'd have got rid of it
after puking out everything.

1700
01:31:20,254 --> 01:31:22,530
But you've done so wrong
like the sickinking of love.

1701
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,123

By the way, dotor, you were
in theatres before, isn't it?

1730
01:32:42,087 --> 01:32:44,192
Yes. During days I work

01:32:44,487 --> 01:32:46,194
...and then I do theatre
in evenings.

1732

01:32:48,887 --> 01:32:50,798
Oh! Your brother must have
told you.

Okay, then I will let you meet
the brother too.

Oh, so you've brought him along?

01:32:59,753 --> 01:33:00,925
I am sorry Neeru.

Due to me how much trouble
you have to face.

You came to the city
to be an actor".

01:33:10,087 --> 01:33:12,533
"But your life itself has
turned a drama.

1741
01:33:12,654 --> 01:33:13,826
Drama was fine..

1742
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,594
"But the guy who is sitting outside
he is out to turn me into a drum.

1743
01:33:17,087 --> 01:33:20,125
Now don't show teeth. Go out and
tell him that every thing is fine.

1744
01:33:21,553 --> 01:33:22,896
There is nothing to worry about.

1745
01:33:22,954 --> 01:33:24,900
She had slight indigestion.
Now she is fine.

1746

Doctor, you cheked her
properly, didn't you?

1747
01:33:27,453 --> 01:33:30,832
If she starts sucking on raw mango,
my blood would be sucked out.

1748
01:33:31,587 --> 01:33:34,591
Don't take tension . She just
vomited due to indigestion.

1749
01:33:34,753 --> 01:33:38,394
Otherwise, you can gladly take
your wife home.

1750

You are the one who
disturbs the most.

Come on, man! I guy will only

And as I am a army man

1767
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,957
One of these days your husband
is going to abandon you. Note it.

1768
01:34:24,087 --> 01:34:26,727
Even if anyone dies around,
you will not get her.

1769
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:29,768
What do you mean. - Even if he
leaves me, I'd not marry you.

1770
01:34:29,954 --> 01:34:31,956
Why, are you looking for some
famaous hero Sahrukh Khan?

1771
01:34:32,454 --> 01:34:33,956
You are only going to get
guys like me and Bhalla.

01:34:34,087 --> 01:34:35,430
I am scared of you.

1773
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,434
I'm just Kripal Singh not the dreaded
KPS Gill that you are afraid of.

He is lying. Undertaker is
English and she is a Punjabi.

No don't beat me up.

1797
01:35:41,354 --> 01:35:42,765
He is the main boss.

01:35:45,987 --> 01:35:48,763
Brother,I am the main guy,

They are really bad, man.

1809

Once again I have to
struggle with the stove.

1810

Hey, it's you?
Comel was making some sweet dish.

I got a job in the bank.
- Man, it's really good news.

1815

One by one all of us
will be settled.

1816
01:36:44,453 --> 01:36:46,956
My mummy used to say,
whenever there is a good news..

...make sure the sweets are made.
Look I have already prepared for it.

Now what's the ocassion that
you guys are making pudding?

1825
01:37:05,687 --> 01:37:08,395
There that rascal Subedar is ready
to make my pudding, you eat that.

1826
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:09,660
Will you say what happend?

1827
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,563
As if you don't know
how Subedar acts.

1828
01:37:11,687 --> 01:37:13,928
We know he has eyes on you.
- You don't know what more happens.

1829
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:16,267
To save my honor,
lam telling you less.

1830
01:37:16,387 --> 01:37:17,457
You know what happened today.'
- What it is?

1831
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,898
He took me to maternity home
to check whether I'm pregnant.

1832
01:37:20,687 --> 01:37:23,600
I am gonna hit you guys!
He is trying to marry me.

1833
01:37:23,687 --> 01:37:26,361
Now both of your listen.
Either leave this place..

1834
01:37:26,453 --> 01:37:28,865
...or go and tell that
rascal the truth.

1835
01:37:29,554 --> 01:37:32,535
Hey, how can we tell him?
If he comes to know you're a man".

1836
01:37:32,653 --> 01:37:34,564
...then he will not let me marry
Jasmeet.

1837
01:37:34,654 --> 01:37:36,429
Wow! Just because
you want to raise a family"

1838
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,786
...you want to destroy
everything mine. Right?

1839
01:37:37,787 --> 01:37:39,858
Dipfi, we also have to get
Babbu ger married.

1840
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,799
If we told everything to Subedar,
he'll not allow Jasmeet to marry him.

1841
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,799
You get lsot! I was better off
acting as Surpenaksh in villalge.

1842
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,456
At least people respected me.

1843
01:37:47,553 --> 01:37:50,432
And since I have become Neeru,
it's difficult to save my honor.

1844
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,659
Bro, there is a way out of
thie problem.

1845
01:37:52,887 --> 01:37:54,525
What it is?
- If Neeru dies.

1846
01:37:54,787 --> 01:37:57,461
Get lost! I'd better act in
Ramleela drama in villaege.

1847
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,828
Hey, I am not askng you
to die really.

1848
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,722
Just a fictitious death
before the Subedar.

1849
01:38:00,854 --> 01:38:03,733
At least, he'd think that Neeru didn't
rufese to marry him, if she dies

1850
01:38:05,554 --> 01:38:07,727
Look, Neeru!
- Damn with the Neeru.

You know to sweem, don't you?

1852
01:38:10,487 --> 01:38:11,727
Yeah. I do.

01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,699

01:38:30,453 --> 01:38:31,488
I won't survive!

1861
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,690
Don't be mad.

1862
01:38:32,753 --> 01:38:37,463
Don't come after me. I am going
to jump. - Neeru come back...

1863
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,796

Neeru, wait!

1868
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,322
Neeru ! At least stop
and listen.

1869
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,500
Oh God. I won't live.

1870

1871
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,122
"That she is sprinting like
olypian like Milkha Singh?

1872
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:57,699
Mr. Subedar, did someting
transpired between you two?

1873
01:38:57,820 --> 01:38:59,663

1875

Hey, she's going to die
due to you guy!

1876
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,324
But she was happy with him.

1877
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,058
Does one die
out of happiness?

1878
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,292
If anything happens to my wife".

1879
01:39:08,554 --> 01:39:10,227
...I'll kill each one of you.

1880
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,326
I am here!

1881
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,390

It's too cold!

01:39:29,087 --> 01:39:30,327
Yeah!
- Neeru..

1888
01:39:30,787 --> 01:39:35,327
Your Subedar is here for you!
- Hey, he too has jumped in!

1889
01:39:35,587 --> 01:39:37,464
Hey, now what's this now?

1890
01:39:40,387 --> 01:39:42,492
Buddy, one should not
be so besotted!

1891
01:39:42,553 --> 01:39:45,227
Throw some pebbles at him.
- Stones and pebbles won't help.

1892
01:39:45,386 --> 01:39:48,299
They way he is, if we throw
this bridge over him it may work.

1893
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,433
Hey, I've saved her.
Why need more people for it?

1894
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,056
God,I am dead!
- Hey, the one who'd have"

...he standing aside.
It's me who saved her.

1896
01:39:55,387 --> 01:39:57,333
Rascals, now we will have

1897
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:58,626
Com e.
- Yeah, let's.

1898
01:39:59,053 --> 01:40:00,157
Felow is mad!

1899
01:40:00,353 --> 01:40:02,492
Neeru! I am here.

1900
01:40:02,754 --> 01:40:04,756
Mr. Subedar, leave her now.

1901
01:40:05,087 --> 01:40:07,499
Let her go.
If you dare touch my Neeru..

1902
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,429
...I shall drown you here itself.

1903
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,691
Leave her. - Rascals are here
to save now after everything.

1904
01:40:12,253 --> 01:40:14,719
Subedar, let her go now.
- No, It's me who has saved her.

1905
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,256
Sheis mine now.
Get back.

1906
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,024
She is mine.
- No she's mine.

1907
01:40:18,187 --> 01:40:19,632
No, sheis mine.
- She's mine.

1908
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,700
She belongs to me.

1909
01:40:22,086 --> 01:40:24,362
Hey, she is gone! Gone!

1910
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,263
Neeru! My Neeru!

1911
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:28,128
My Neeru has Slipped!

1912
01:40:29,287 --> 01:40:31,631
Neeru!
- Wow, good.

1913
01:40:34,387 --> 01:40:36,230
Neeru!
- I am gone!

1914
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,156
Good bye!

1915
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:41,030
Subedar, come. She's drowned.
Lest, we too drown.

1916
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,430
<i>New“!</i>

1917
01:40:48,953 --> 01:40:50,159
My Sister!

1918
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,561
Where are you gone?

1919
01:40:52,953 --> 01:40:55,991
Who would be my company now?

1920
01:40:57,053 --> 01:40:58,225
Uncle, have some water.

1921
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,457
I h ate water.
Take it away!

1922
01:41:00,653 --> 01:41:02,599
Mr. Subedar drinking it.

1923
01:41:02,987 --> 01:41:06,457
What't the fault of water
in this?

1924
01:41:06,687 --> 01:41:08,997
What you got to loose.
You have other woman too.

1925
01:41:09,254 --> 01:41:12,201
Why are you saying this?
We too tried our best.

1926
01:41:12,254 --> 01:41:13,961
You call it saving her?

1927
01:41:14,087 --> 01:41:15,225
It's me who was actually
saving her.

1928
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,631
You rascals jumped on to me
as if I was not helping her.

1929
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,330
Before my eyes Neeru
was swept away in water"

1930
01:41:23,287 --> 01:41:26,666
...as if a undrgarment is
swept away.

1931
01:41:36,187 --> 01:41:40,101
Those who killed my sister...
Your sister will...

1932
01:41:42,286 --> 01:41:44,197
Tell him who killed her?
Now acting here.

1933
01:41:44,287 --> 01:41:45,527
Will you make invitigation?

1934
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,565
Let it be, now let's
prepare for last rites.

1935
01:41:47,687 --> 01:41:49,462
Rascals, she did not jump
on her own.

1936
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,958
Bullied and harassed from you
guys, sheiumped in water.

1937
01:41:53,187 --> 01:41:56,930
Say it openly,
what you mean.

1938
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,155
Don't make me say it.

1939
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:01,201
Once your sister tried to jump
now see what happend to her.

1940
01:42:01,354 --> 01:42:04,961
If you had married her to me
a nice guy like me..

1941
01:42:05,154 --> 01:42:06,326
...then the canal in which
she has died..

1942
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:10,025
...she would have been
boating with me in it.

1943
01:42:10,553 --> 01:42:12,191
Uncle, please stop.

1944
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,459
What was to happen has happened.
- Nothing has happend as yet.

1945
01:42:14,654 --> 01:42:16,327
Also, do you know
better than me?

1946
01:42:16,553 --> 01:42:18,931
Just sitting here you're
making gussess.

1947
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:21,331
Just, chanting the name
of God..

1948
01:42:21,487 --> 01:42:24,127
...my sister became one
with the God.

1949
01:42:25,087 --> 01:42:29,263
Now who'll tie the sacred
thread on my wrist?

1950
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:35,392
Now my life wil be hell.

1951
01:42:35,954 --> 01:42:36,989
Now forget it.

1952
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,823
At least my sister has paid
the rent for this month.

1953
01:42:40,187 --> 01:42:42,497
May I stay in her place?
- Should I teach you?

1954
01:42:43,087 --> 01:42:44,862
My dad was right when he said...

1955
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:47,296
"that man in father-in-laws' house,
and in sister's house he is a dog.

1956
01:42:47,553 --> 01:42:49,260
And you are asking to stay
in you sister's house?

1957
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,926
Not yours sister, you don't
deserve to be cursed in her name.

1958
01:42:52,054 --> 01:42:54,830
I can't even abuse you
in name of your sister.

1959
01:42:56,854 --> 01:42:57,798
Neeru.

1960
01:42:58,154 --> 01:42:59,132
Love you.

1961
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,797
Yes, Paali.
- Mintu!

1962
01:43:34,153 --> 01:43:35,962
Where is Hano, why doesn't
she come to school?

1963
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,192
Come on, at leasi ask about me
why don't I come to school.

1964
01:43:39,487 --> 01:43:41,364
Man, tell me where she's?
She doesn't even pick the phone.

1965
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,261
She has left the school.
- “my?

1966
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,260
How am Ito know?

1967
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:55,897
Take this one out.

1968
01:43:56,187 --> 01:43:57,393
Here I am.

1969
01:44:02,887 --> 01:44:05,060
Junior! Where is Hano madam?

1970
01:44:05,287 --> 01:44:07,096
She's gone to Gurdwara.

1971
01:44:08,954 --> 01:44:10,126
Now begin.

1972
01:44:27,187 --> 01:44:28,188
Strange!

1973
01:44:28,353 --> 01:44:30,094
Why don't you take my call?

1974
01:44:30,254 --> 01:44:31,790
You've also left school
without informing.

1975
01:44:31,954 --> 01:44:33,865
Do you know how bothered I was?

1976
01:44:36,254 --> 01:44:37,426
Are you all right?

1977
01:44:39,187 --> 01:44:41,997
Thank God. Know, I was
getting strange thoughts.

1978
01:44:43,054 --> 01:44:44,863
If something has gone
wrong with you.

1979
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,799
You really care so much for me?

1980
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:49,255
Why not?

1981
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:51,832
If I don't say, it does not mean
that I do not...

1982
01:44:56,487 --> 01:44:57,727
Paali.

1983
01:44:58,287 --> 01:44:59,891
Day after it's my engagement.

1984
01:45:06,887 --> 01:45:07,957
Engagement?

1985
01:45:35,487 --> 01:45:39,196
But I was under the impression
that you like me.

1986
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,790
Havel ever denied it?

1987
01:45:45,053 --> 01:45:48,057
Then this engagement?
What's all this?... This relationship

1988
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,661
Last week my sister finalized it.

1989
01:45:56,187 --> 01:45:57,996
A person who don't even know..

1990
01:45:59,054 --> 01:46:00,761
...how could you get
engaged to him?

1991
01:46:03,987 --> 01:46:05,364
He is my sister's younger
brother-in-law.

1992
01:46:06,254 --> 01:46:08,757
Both the families have
decided this.

1993
01:46:11,953 --> 01:46:13,193
Then what'd become of me?

1994
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,955
Paali..

1995
01:46:29,853 --> 01:46:31,389
...you are really a good man.

1996
01:46:34,253 --> 01:46:36,028
You'll find a very good girl.

1997
01:46:39,353 --> 01:46:41,060
The one girl good girl I found..

1998
01:46:42,787 --> 01:46:44,130
...she is abandoning me now.

1999
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,128
Perhaps, fate had this in store.

2000
01:47:34,753 --> 01:47:39,753
"Hidden within praying hands,
my prayers weep"

2001
01:47:45,053 --> 01:47:48,330
"My prayers are weep"

2002
01:47:54,787 --> 01:48:04,674
"Hidden within praying hands,
my prayers weep"

2003
01:48:06,254 --> 01:48:08,928
"My prayers weep"

2004
01:48:10,753 --> 01:48:20,231
"Hidden among leaves, winds weep"

2005
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,797
"Winds weep"

2006
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:33,096
"Where, my love, once
we used to meet"

2007
01:48:34,687 --> 01:48:41,605
"Today hugging u=---"

2008
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:47,820
"Today hugging us
those places weep"

2009
01:48:53,954 --> 01:48:57,231
"Those places weep"

2010
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:03,720
"Hidden among leaves,
winds weep"

2011
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,000
"Winds weep"

2012
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:20,997
"Parterres have gone,
ruins have remained"

2013
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:28,897
"I've been just left sitting
within the temple"

2014
01:49:29,953 --> 01:49:33,696
"Have been left in the temple"

2015
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:40,860
"My love has left,
I've lost everything"

2016
01:49:42,853 --> 01:49:49,828
"My love has left,
I've lost everything"

2017
01:49:50,953 --> 01:50:00,738
"While leaving my call to her
they weep"

2018
01:50:01,087 --> 01:50:04,091
"My calls to her weep"

2019
01:50:06,887 --> 01:50:16,740
"Hidden within praying hands,
my prayers weep"

2020
01:50:18,587 --> 01:50:21,932
"My prayers weep"

2021
01:50:31,587 --> 01:50:32,725
She's Getting engaged..

2022
01:50:32,987 --> 01:50:34,796
"And you are sitting here idle?

2023
01:50:34,953 --> 01:50:36,489
So go and celebrate.
- What?

2024
01:50:36,886 --> 01:50:38,058
What else can I say?

2025
01:50:38,154 --> 01:50:40,760
We only came to know today
that this guy is love too.

2026
01:50:41,087 --> 01:50:42,653
But now say what to do?

2027
01:50:42,654 --> 01:50:43,860
Engagement will have
to be stopped.

2028
01:50:44,387 --> 01:50:47,368
Have you gone mad? It's an
engagement, not a joke.

2029
01:50:47,554 --> 01:50:49,033
So should we let your life
become a joke, should we?

2030
01:50:49,087 --> 01:50:51,465
Afterwards keep crying bitterly.
Okay?

2031
01:50:52,054 --> 01:50:53,032
No, man.

2032
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:55,457
She's happy wherever
she is getting engaged.

2033
01:50:55,887 --> 01:50:57,491
And her happiness is
my happiness too.

2034
01:50:57,654 --> 01:51:00,658
Look, Paali. We aren't going to
let her get engaged.

2035
01:51:00,853 --> 01:51:02,799
Why not if we have to
break som one's limbs.

2036
01:51:02,887 --> 01:51:03,991
Listen to me.

2037
01:51:04,387 --> 01:51:05,957
If you even mentioned
of breaking the engagement.

2038
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,557
...I shall break every one's
legs here.

2039
01:51:12,554 --> 01:51:13,555
So you've the medal now?

2040
01:51:14,153 --> 01:51:15,530
Now say, what to do?

2041
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,692
I have an idea.

2042
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,524
The man who is getting engaged..

2043
01:51:19,587 --> 01:51:21,533
...let's make allegation that
heis already married.

2044
01:51:22,487 --> 01:51:23,898
Good idea, man.

2045
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:25,490
But who will do it?

2046
01:51:25,687 --> 01:51:27,428
You!
You'll be his first wife.

2047
01:51:27,487 --> 01:51:28,625
Get lost, damn you!

2048
01:51:28,687 --> 01:51:32,032
I've come to be a hero and you guys
turned me into a housewife!

2049
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,861
Why, can't you do this
much for your friends?

2050
01:51:33,954 --> 01:51:35,524
I have hardly got rid of
this old man..

2051
01:51:35,654 --> 01:51:38,635
...and if I stayed back with you guys
I'll reallybe going after a boy.

2052
01:51:38,787 --> 01:51:40,061
Get lost!

2053
01:51:40,454 --> 01:51:42,092
All the time you ask me
to become a woman.

2054
01:51:44,353 --> 01:51:46,560
Babbu, now you have to
do soemthing.

2055
01:51:47,487 --> 01:51:50,024
Oh, no!I can't face
all those people.

2056
01:51:50,353 --> 01:51:52,993
If you became a hit singer tomrrow,
how would you sing on stage?

2057
01:51:53,554 --> 01:51:56,592
Now stop giving excuses and
prepare to become a lady.

2058
01:51:56,654 --> 01:51:58,292
Else I'll not let you remain a man.

2059
01:52:31,287 --> 01:52:32,823
Babbu, he has left.

2060
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,799
Hurry and get ready.

2061
01:52:35,287 --> 01:52:36,664
Get up. - Has he left?
- Yes.

2062
01:52:45,353 --> 01:52:47,458
Babbu.. I think this is...

2063
01:52:49,353 --> 01:52:50,354
Thank you.

2064
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,661
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2065
01:52:54,353 --> 01:52:56,060
So many things to eat...

2066
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:57,666
You want to eat?
Go...

2067
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,866
Welcome! Welcome!

2068
01:53:00,954 --> 01:53:01,955
Hello!

Waiter, bring some refreshments
fot bro and sis-in-law.

2070
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,290
Where have they all gone?

2071
01:53:20,654 --> 01:53:22,600
If Paali's girlfriend gets
married to someone else..

2072
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:25,966
"These guys will blame
me for all my life.

2073
01:53:32,287 --> 01:53:33,789
Hey! Stop!

2074
01:53:34,354 --> 01:53:35,332
Hold on.

2075
01:53:36,587 --> 01:53:37,793
Move on.

2076
01:53:50,287 --> 01:53:55,287
One more...They are treating so well,
I feel like staying here.

2077
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,500
Don't talk rubbish.
Eat quickly.

2078
01:54:00,587 --> 01:54:01,827
This is the place.
Stop.

2079
01:54:04,587 --> 01:54:05,520

and now this woman?

2081
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,093
What's to you?
Take your money and run.

2082
01:54:14,587 --> 01:54:16,191
Are the rituals over?

2083
01:54:16,887 --> 01:54:18,798
Come on, rites are still
to take place.

2084
01:54:21,753 --> 01:54:23,790
I am detroyed!

2085
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,422
Stop this engagement ceremony!

2086
01:54:26,553 --> 01:54:29,193
This guy was first wedded to me!

2087
01:54:29,553 --> 01:54:32,193
I am going to be the mother
of this guy!

2088
01:54:32,287 --> 01:54:34,460
Stop this engagement!
- What nonsense!

2089
01:54:34,587 --> 01:54:37,227
I am not talking nonseense,
I'm telling the truth.

2090
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,428
<i>Wham?</i>

2091
01:54:41,354 --> 01:54:43,698
Oh! I thoght it's an engegment
cerem oney.

2092
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:45,828
I am really sorry.

2093
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:49,631
He wasn't so disgraced alive
as you've done it after his death.

2094
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,631
Now, before him we shall
complete your last rites.

2095
01:54:51,787 --> 01:54:54,233
No, no!
- Get hold of him!

2096
01:55:10,553 --> 01:55:12,794
Where is my money
for the supplies?

2097
01:55:17,287 --> 01:55:19,267
He is my son.
Takea look.

2098
01:55:20,621 --> 01:55:23,261
Boy is good. I can find him
nurmerous alliances.

2099
01:55:23,554 --> 01:55:25,329
But just tell me what
does he do?

2100
01:55:25,554 --> 01:55:27,534
He has gone to the city
to be an actor.

2101
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,563
On his face I might have
called him anything"

2102
01:55:30,087 --> 01:55:33,296
"but I'm sure he'll be a
great actor someday.

2103
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:35,622
And the world would run...
- Hey, get hold of him.

2104
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:37,324
Hey, get hold of him!

2105
01:55:37,587 --> 01:55:40,067

Go after him!

2111
01:55:49,054 --> 01:55:51,625
Brother, why are you after him?
- We won't spare him.

2112
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:53,097
Man, why are you...

2113
01:55:53,153 --> 01:55:55,531
Why all these guys are
after my son?

2114
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:57,190
Which one is your son
among them?

2115
01:55:57,254 --> 01:55:59,291
The one who is running
as a woman upfront.

2116
01:55:59,387 --> 01:56:02,163
Hey, congratulations! Your son
is gonna be a mother.

2117
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,800
What nonsense it is! I'm laready
a heart patient. What congrats?

2118
01:56:05,087 --> 01:56:08,034
That's why people are after
him to hammer him.

2119
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:09,497
It's me who is going to
beat him up!

Enough... You go...

At least finish why you are here
instead of hogging.

2127
01:56:41,087 --> 01:56:42,395
Let me finish, engagement

Hey! Who are you?

Rascal, finish the fritters
then speak.

2142
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:18,460
I don't know her.

2143
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:20,099
Don't say that my Prince!

2144
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,027
Don't act like this.

2145
01:57:22,487 --> 01:57:25,661
How could you forget those
moment you spent with me?

2146
01:57:26,387 --> 01:57:27,923
What m om ents?
What marriage?

2147
01:57:28,353 --> 01:57:29,331
Why're you talking nonsense?

2148
01:57:29,387 --> 01:57:31,094
Don't be so cruel, dear.

2149
01:57:32,087 --> 01:57:34,033
I am married to you.

2150
01:57:34,487 --> 01:57:36,228
He is already married...

2151
01:57:36,654 --> 01:57:38,099
Now what's this problem?

2152
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:39,628
What did I lack?

2153
01:57:40,287 --> 01:57:42,289
I just got few pains in tummy,
that's all?

2154
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,693
Damn you, at least you
could made some better excuse!

2155
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:47,164

Oh, Subedar.

2159

Jass, you?

The one standing with me.

2162
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,929
But she's his wife,
not sister.

2163
01:58:01,354 --> 01:58:03,425
Mr. Subdar, don't involve
in our problems.

2164
01:58:03,954 --> 01:58:06,093
She is my siter and there
is her hubby.

2165
01:58:06,253 --> 01:58:08,130
How could I be married
to your sister?

01:58:08,254 --> 01:58:10,165
Hello, Paali!

Consider engagement is broken

Yes, Gippy brother!
Yes, Billu?

Rascal, you are calling
your wife you sister!

2179
01:58:58,687 --> 01:59:00,564
Mr. Subedar, you don't understand.

2180
01:59:01,054 --> 01:59:03,364
She is my sister.
You're not in your senses now.

2181
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:06,294
Agreed that I am a bit upset
with the death of my Neeru..

2182
01:59:06,453 --> 01:59:07,932

Sheis my Neeru.

Just now you said
she is dead.

2194
01:59:51,187 --> 01:59:52,530
Why, you wanna offer
wreath to her?

2195

Don't know from where

Jass, have you gone mad?

Laddi, you don't understand.

No!

2371
02:07:19,087 --> 02:07:20,361
I am Depfi.

2372
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:23,955
I am the Neeru..

2373
02:07:24,987 --> 02:07:26,330
...and I am the Japuii.

2374
02:07:30,587 --> 02:07:31,725
What happend?

2375
02:07:32,053 --> 02:07:34,897
Get off me! All women
apear to me men like.

2376
02:07:35,554 --> 02:07:36,692
And I too am not Pinki.

2377
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:42,021
I'm Babbu.

2378
02:07:44,853 --> 02:07:46,992
Hano, it's our plan to get
your engagement broken.

2379
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:50,601
Hearing of your engagement,
he's was so distraught.

2380
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:53,662
If we hadn't ask him today,
he'd have never told us..

2381
02:07:53,887 --> 02:07:55,662
"That's what pains his heart.

2382
02:07:55,853 --> 02:07:57,491
He truly loves you.

2383
02:07:58,687 --> 02:08:00,291
That's why our conscience
has woken up.

2384
02:08:00,854 --> 02:08:03,334
Otherwise, we never woke
up before ten in morning.

2385
02:08:03,487 --> 02:08:06,434
Every fault is ours.
He's not at fault.

2386
02:08:06,787 --> 02:08:09,700
His only fault is that
he loved you with all his heart.

2387
02:08:09,987 --> 02:08:11,660
And took you as everything
of his.

2388
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,025
Today, everything of his
going far from him.

2389
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:16,298
<i>Ram!</i>

2390
02:08:16,753 --> 02:08:17,754
I was wrong.

2391
02:08:18,553 --> 02:08:21,693
You may find who can give
you a bright future"

2392
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:25,601
"but you rarely get
a true lover.

2393
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:28,865
The boy, who for your happiness..

2394
02:08:29,287 --> 02:08:30,925
...sacrificed all his happiness..

2395
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:32,697
...and was going away..

2396
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:34,897
"How deeply he must love you?

2397
02:08:36,053 --> 02:08:37,726
The mistake I made"

2398
02:08:38,387 --> 02:08:39,730
...you can correct it now.

2399
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:48,798
Paali!
- Palli?

2400
02:08:50,587 --> 02:08:51,895
Paali has left, Hano.

2401
02:08:53,553 --> 02:08:55,658
Go my child, stop him.

2402
02:08:56,387 --> 02:08:58,526
<i>'Ix, Rano.
Stop P aah .</i>

2403
02:09:01,687 --> 02:09:02,631
<i>Ram!</i>

2404
02:09:11,254 --> 02:09:12,232
Paali !

2405
02:09:27,354 --> 02:09:29,425
After so much,
you are leaving?

2406
02:09:30,754 --> 02:09:31,994
I know I was wrong.

2407
02:09:32,487 --> 02:09:34,694
If I had not told of my feelings
to my friends"

2408
02:09:36,287 --> 02:09:37,493
"this would not have happend.

2409
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,755
If you had not said it..

2410
02:09:40,453 --> 02:09:43,195
"Perhaps we would have
parted forever.

2411
02:09:43,587 --> 02:09:45,794
I always wished to be with you.

2412
02:09:46,687 --> 02:09:48,758
Paali, forgive me.

2413
02:09:50,253 --> 02:09:51,732
I could not undrstand you.

2414
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:55,195
I too had many things in my heart.

2415
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,299
But I could say it.

2416
02:09:58,487 --> 02:10:00,330
Today, before your true love..

2417
02:10:00,687 --> 02:10:02,189
...my sister's apprehensions
too have lost.

2418
02:10:03,453 --> 02:10:04,431
Really?

2419
02:10:05,521 --> 02:10:06,431
Really.

2420
02:10:09,187 --> 02:10:10,757
I really like you.

2421
02:10:11,187 --> 02:10:13,497
Come on, had your sister
had agreed earlier..

2422
02:10:13,854 --> 02:10:16,266
...then lots of money spent on
engagement would've been saved.

2423
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:17,890
Are you mad somehow?

2424
02:10:18,387 --> 02:10:19,627
You've made me one.

2425
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,455
Sorry, Mr. Subedar.

2426
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:34,326
Just to rent a house,
we hurt your feelings.

2427
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,596
It would have been better
had I martyred in army days.

2428
02:10:37,954 --> 02:10:41,367
If not then, I should have taken
posion today and died.

2429
02:10:41,587 --> 02:10:43,589
So, at least, your truth
I would not have to face.

2430
02:10:43,854 --> 02:10:46,391
Any way, consider that
your Neeru is dead.

2431
02:10:46,653 --> 02:10:47,791
And as far as rest of
your life is concerned"

2432
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:49,194
"spend it with her memories.

2433
02:10:49,254 --> 02:10:50,824
Rascal, with such worst
memories..

2434
02:10:51,187 --> 02:10:52,860
...I don't feel like living
even for a moment.

2435
02:10:53,387 --> 02:10:55,128
The moment I enter my house,
it will make fun of me.

2436
02:10:55,354 --> 02:10:58,563
I fail to understand where should
Subedar Kripal Singh Gill go?

2437
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:01,756
Please, don't be disheartened.

2438
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,431
<i>'L'lll</i> you don't compose
yourself..

2439
02:11:04,853 --> 02:11:05,854
...I promise..

2440
02:11:06,587 --> 02:11:09,591
...I'll come everyday to you for
an hour as a woman.

2441
02:11:09,854 --> 02:11:12,596
If you ever came near me
as a woman..

2442
02:11:12,854 --> 02:11:14,527
...I will forget that you
are a man.

2443
02:11:16,254 --> 02:11:18,200
Solider has gone insane!
He's gone insane!

2444
02:11:18,287 --> 02:11:19,561
Yes he's gone mad.
