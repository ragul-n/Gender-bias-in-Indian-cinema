2
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:19,006
Mr. Jadhav, is big boss
really coming?

3
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:22,271
Coming? You can say he's come.
The train will come anytime now.

4
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,681
Let's see what scene he creates.

5
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:29,688
Is there anything against you?
- Meaning?

6
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:34,284
Exactly what I said.
The jerk Shome is a real...

7
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,218
Anyway, forget it,
let's have tea.

8
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:55,112
Okay tell me, what have I done?

9
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:58,240
And what little I have done,
is not for me alone.

10
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,253
Don't others do it?
Then why am only I being blamed?

11
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,721
Why the report only in my name?

12
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:08,717
Look, he's coming here now. Plead
with him, maybe he forgives you.

13
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,253
Are you crazy? You think
Mr. Shome will forgive?

14
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,257
No point pleading before him.

15
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:22,264
But then, two months hence,
I'm bringing my bride home.

16
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:25,267
What if a report is filed against me?

17
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:03,238
I've repeatedly said, I don't
like this 'yes boss! ' attitude.

18
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,242
You will not be able to
please me with flattery.

19
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:15,125
I'm an old fashioned man.
'Duty first, self last' is my motto.

20
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,252
Do your duty well,
I'll be happy with you.

21
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:21,256
If you don't work diligently,
or do something unwarranted...

22
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,268
know that you won't be spared.

23
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,262
Saluting me won't work.

24
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,674
That ticket collector,
Jadhav Patel was here.

25
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:31,933
Jadhav!

26
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:47,683
He's standing here so innocently.
He knows how to make money.

27
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:50,091
He's an expert at taking bribes.

28
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,222
Don't worry,
your report is ready.

29
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,242
The way he stares at you.

30
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:39,076
It is your wish, whether
you call him good, or bad.

31
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,079
But Bhuvan Shome is such a man.

32
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:45,207
Some people say
he is very stubborn.

33
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,677
Or does anyone dismiss
his own son from a job?

34
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:52,089
What could I do? Make him
sit in my lap and praise him?

35
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,091
There's a limit to
being irresponsible.

36
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,219
He treated office as the bazaar.

37
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,228
Without informing anyone,
he suddenly disappeared one day

38
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,100
Wonder who that Guru is whose
birthday he went to celebrate in

39
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:08,230
Kashi.
And yet people expect me

40
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,697
to treat him well.
Idiot!

41
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,244
He's become a teacher. He's teaching
in Guruji's celibate Ashram.

42
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,714
He failed thrice in his last year of
graduation, and now he's a teacher.

43
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,659
For any years, after spending a
strange and lonely life...

44
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:42,197
suddenly today, Mr. Shome came out
of the four walls of his office...

45
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,675
into a new world.

46
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:50,205
Always alone, absolutely alone.
That's been his life.

47
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:56,679
Now look, until his wife was alive,
he never let her live in peace.

48
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:00,681
He made her life miserable
with his strange habits.

49
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:05,095
He has an only son
who also does not live with him.

50
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,961
But yes, his colleagues
do respect him a lot.

51
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:12,102
But the moment he turns his
back, they say, 'the jerk! '

52
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,700
Bengal.

53
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,239
Golden Bengal!

54
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:28,242
Great Bengal!

55
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,716
Unique Bengal.

56
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:06,281
Long live revolution!

57
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:32,108
It's very straight with us.
If our demands are not met...

58
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:37,246
we, workers of film industry,
will not allow films to be exhibited.

59
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:45,254
Bhuvan Shome is from this Bengal.
An absolutely honest man.

60
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,257
Even after living outside
Bengal for so many years...

61
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,131
he hasn't lost
his Bengali character.

62
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,729
Bhuvan Shome, a true blue Bengali!

63
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:17,763
Mr. Shome is a senior officer
with the railways.

64
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:21,756
A very diligent worker,
and very honest.

65
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,770
He has seen a lot in life.

66
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:28,172
But wonder whether he has
learnt anything from it or not.

67
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,244
And this is his world.

68
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:12,274
After spending 25 years
as a strict disciplinarian...

69
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:16,153
Mr. Shome suddenly,
perhaps unknowingly...

70
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,154
started feeling strange.

71
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:22,159
He started getting bored of
his dull life.

72
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:33,704
And Mr. Shome reached a
famous hunter's home.

73
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:38,232
Hunting.

74
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,234
Very terrifying.

75
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:49,710
And he decided even he will hunt.

76
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,255
He took leave from office one day,
and came here for hunting.

77
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,259
But what will Mr. Shome hunt?

78
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:06,260
Lions?

79
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:11,266
No, all that is...

80
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:20,014
After thinking a lot,
he decided he must hunt birds.

81
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,754
And he became a bird expert.

82
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:43,231
And then, one day, he set
out on his hunting expedition.

83
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:47,696
He will live in this
guest house tonight.

84
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:51,233
His bird hunting expedition
will begin tomorrow.

85
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,245
He will travel for about
10 miles in a bullock cart.

86
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,110
And then he'll walk.

87
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:22,264
People think this is
Mr. Shome's new interest.

88
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:25,744
Dinner is ready, sir.

89
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:12,047
Hindi. So you can speak Hindi too?
- Yes sir.

90
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:17,121
The watchman of the guest house
told me you don't understand Gujarati.

91
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:22,250
I know Hindi, I understand
Hindi. Don't worry.

92
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,125
That's why you sang a Hindi song?

93
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:29,132
People from different places come
here, and I have rode them all.

94
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,202
So I learnt Hindi.

95
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:38,199
I can speak Rajasthani too.
- Is it? - Yes.

96
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,708
Bengali...
- What, sir?

97
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,243
Can you speak Bengali?
- Bengali?

98
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:17,705
Acting smart?

99
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,721
Why are you riding so fast?

100
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,253
What, sir?
- Ride slow.

101
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,265
Why, sir?
- Your cart will break.

102
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:46,669
No sir, it will not break.
It's very strong.

103
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,730
There is no other cart
as strong as mine.

104
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,737
I said ride slow!
- Scared, sir?

105
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,751
How will I not be scared?
You were riding so fast.

106
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,277
Ride slow, then no
one will be troubled.

107
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:05,289
Not you, not your bullocks.
- My bullocks are strong, sir.

108
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:06,756
They don't have any problem.

109
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,101
Ride slow. If I ride slow,
how will he get to kill birds?

110
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:24,174
What did you say?
- You are saying, ride slow.

111
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,302
If I ride slow,
you will get late.

112
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,313
And if you get late,
the birds will be gone.

113
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,246
And if the birds are gone,
your going there will be useless.

114
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,709
How far do we have to go?
- Very far.

115
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:40,248
And you have to walk a lot.
- Okay then, ride faster.

116
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:43,261
All right.
- And listen, don't be hasty.

117
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,318
All right, sir.

118
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,275
What happened?

119
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:22,290
Why were you doing 'katu kutu'
to the bullocks?

120
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:25,769
Kutu kutu?
- Not 'kutu kutu', 'katu kutu'.

121
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:29,172
Katu kutu?
- Don't know what 'katu kutu' is?

122
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,708
No.
- Sursuri.

123
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,235
What?
- What were you doing to the bullocks?

124
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,705
That! Tickle?

125
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:45,246
Sir, if I don't tickle them,
they will not run fast.

126
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,715
If they don't run fast,
you will get late.

127
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,125
If you get late,
the birds will be gone.

128
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:52,253
And if the birds are gone,
your going there will be pointless.

129
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:54,732
Okay, ride fast.

130
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:58,259
Sir, what word did
you use for tickle?

131
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:02,264
Katu kutu.
- Not that, that other word.

132
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:03,730
Sursuri.

133
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,746
Want to be a linguist?

134
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:43,239
Which village is this?
- Mallakamb. It's a big village.

135
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,719
Sir is going to hunt birds.

136
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,251
Sir is going to hunt birds.

137
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,260
Hey!
- Yes sir?

138
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:12,735
Why did you stop?

139
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:30,278
Doesn't he want to looks at girls?

140
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,227
What is your name?
- Singh.

141
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:52,109
Singh? Meaning?
- Singh. Peanut. Don't you understand?

142
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:56,237
Then what do you understand?

143
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:03,711
Singh! Peanut! Groundnut.
Do you eat groundnuts?

144
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:09,717
Who gave you such a silly name?
- It's not silly, it's a nice name.

145
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:15,258
My aunt named me.
I was born in a groundnut field.

146
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,259
That is why I was named Singh.

147
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:25,739
Look, those groundnut fields,
I was born there.

148
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:29,736
My mother died after delivering me.

149
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:21,254
Buffalo!

150
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:28,261
Get off.

151
00:25:31,677 --> 00:25:35,078
That's a buffalo.
- He's a terror.

152
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,682
He's wild. Everyone is scared
of him. Get off quickly.

153
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:43,086
Hurry! Don't shoot!
- Why?

154
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:46,691
Just get off quickly. Hurry!

155
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:55,223
Shall I take my luggage?
- Run quickly, sir!

156
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:00,228
Shall I take this too?
- Take everything, hurry!

157
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:06,234
This...
- Run!

158
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:26,720
Go away!

159
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:33,204
Don't do that... don't do that.

160
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:41,202
Do something! Hey, Singh!

161
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:22,713
No, it's okay.

162
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:30,244
Why fear a buffalo?

163
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,289
Run! Hurry! Climb up the tree!

164
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,124
Acting naughty again?

165
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:46,719
You got beaten in the morning,
yet you are the same! Shameless!

166
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:51,258
Sir cannot go because of you.
Stay there. Idiot!

167
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,264
You were beating her.
- Look up there on the tree.

168
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,272
Shut-up!

169
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:10,277
Let's go home.

170
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:43,721
She's gone.

171
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:50,251
Hey! Where did my cart go?

172
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:50,245
My bullocks ran away.
What a bother!

173
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:54,248
Don't waste time now.
I'll have to find the bullocks.

174
00:31:54,326 --> 00:32:00,265
You will get late. I'll look for
my bullocks, you walk straight.

175
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,733
Walking?
- Yes.

176
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:09,264
You will come across a village,
and then a river.

177
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:12,276
You will find a lot of birds
near the river.

178
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,736
I'll find the bullocks
and wait here for you.

179
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:19,273
Meet me here.

180
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,276
Don't worry, I'll find the
bullocks and wait here.

181
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:28,749
Don't worry, meet me here.
I will come here. Don't worry, sir.

182
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:43,698
Meet me here, in this village,
in Mallakamb village.

183
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:49,962
It's a mud pipe.

184
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,235
I've come to hunt birds.

185
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,715
Where can I find them?

186
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,243
You don't understand Hindi?

187
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,247
Big village.

188
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:15,255
True. It is a big village.

189
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:26,266
I have come to hunt birds.

190
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:30,679
The bullocks ran away.

191
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:32,205
I'm going to walk.

192
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,688
The river where the birds are found?

193
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,214
You show me the way.

194
00:34:42,694 --> 00:34:45,026
I'll pay you.
- No.

195
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,095
Take it.
- No.

196
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,700
Why won't you take?
You'll have to take it.

197
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,231
Show me the way.
You'll have to take the money.

198
00:34:57,308 --> 00:35:00,709
Why won't you take it?
Show me the way.

199
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:02,235
Come.

200
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:14,123
I'll show him the way and come back.

201
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,248
Come.

202
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:27,261
Come... come after me.

203
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:37,657
Hey! Come here! This side!

204
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:45,200
Sir... sir! Come here. This way.

205
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:51,681
Over here.

206
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:01,213
Come here.

207
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,270
Buffalo!

208
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:32,708
Hey! Throw the cigar.

209
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:36,236
Or the birds will fly away.

210
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:42,235
Father has sent a cot for you.

211
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:56,123
He's asked you to sit.

212
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,262
If you wish, you can
come home and take rest.

213
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:12,742
Father has said so.

214
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:30,158
What are you looking? The birds
will not come here for an hour now.

215
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:39,226
Who is your father?

216
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:50,704
Look, that neem tree...
not there, over here.

217
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:54,108
Our home is behind it.

218
00:42:54,252 --> 00:42:58,120
My father's name is Damu Patel.
He'd seen you.

219
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:01,248
Seen me?

220
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,122
He'd see me dead.
Your buffalo almost killed me.

221
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:12,259
Sit on the cot.
- No.

222
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:14,736
If you don't sit,
father will scold me.

223
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:19,141
So what can I do?
I have come here to hunt...

224
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:20,744
not to rest.

225
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:28,275
Scold you? Put your
buffalo after your father.

226
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:30,687
He will forget to scold.

227
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:40,687
The birds here are very smart.
- Because you couldn't kill them?

228
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:44,690
Why do you shoot them?
What wrong have they done?

229
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:49,695
You eat meat?

230
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,701
Vegetables?
- Yes.

231
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:59,239
What wrong have they done?
Why do you cut and eat them?

232
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:04,245
There is life even in them.
Even they get hurt when cut.

233
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:08,123
Really? I didn't know that.

234
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:11,251
But how can birds
and vegetables be the same?

235
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:15,256
When you cut birds they flutter,
they bleed.

236
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:19,133
But vegetables?
They neither flutter, nor bleed.

237
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:27,267
You like bird meat?
- I quit when I was little.

238
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:29,741
Then why do you hunt?

239
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:36,618
You defeated me.
Are there bed bugs in this?

240
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:40,680
Bed bugs? No. It would be nice if
there were. They would bite you.

241
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,225
Hello.
- My father.

242
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:55,705
Father, good you came.

243
00:44:58,242 --> 00:45:02,235
Your daughter speaks fluent Hindi.
Where did she learn it?

244
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:05,113
She has spent her childhood in
her uncle's home in the city.

245
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:08,708
She learnt it there.
She can read and write Hindi.

246
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:15,123
Is it? She knows to read and
write too? Your girl is intelligent.

247
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:16,726
It's your grace, sir.

248
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:23,063
Father, I'm leaving. You
bring the cot, it's very heavy.

249
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:27,135
Where are you taking my gun?
Give my gun.

250
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,739
What will you stand here and do?
Come home.

251
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:31,668
You will get the gun
when you need it.

252
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:34,074
Sir, this girl is very stubborn.

253
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:36,202
Once she decides something,
she does it.

254
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,214
Now you will have to come home.

255
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:42,674
I have told her not to act
stubborn with others.

256
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,085
But this girl doesn't understand.

257
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:49,090
Sir, she lost her mother
in her childhood.

258
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:53,094
She was pampered in her uncle's home.
So she does what comes to her mind.

259
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,698
She's crazy.
- Crazy?

260
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:06,238
When you fired the first shot,
I saw you then.

261
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:12,238
But the way you fired, I understood
you are an inexperienced hunter.

262
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,118
Sir, if you fire like that, you
won't be able to kill a single bird.

263
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:21,247
Why?
- You don't hunt like that here.

264
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:23,255
Hunting is done differently here.

265
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:35,672
This buffalo listens
to your daughter.

266
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,671
Yes sir. Gauri has
reared him since childhood.

267
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:44,079
He's Gauri's pet.
It was a quiet calf.

268
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:47,082
So she named him Sheetal (calm).

269
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:50,085
But now he's a terror.
He creates a ruckus.

270
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,212
Gauri.
- Yes father?

271
00:46:57,228 --> 00:47:00,095
Sir will eat, and then take rest.

272
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:04,099
Did you understand that?
Father is saying...

273
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:06,703
eat something first,
then take rest.

274
00:47:07,238 --> 00:47:10,230
Go with him and help him hunt.

275
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:15,235
I told him hunting
is done differently here.

276
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:19,239
Don't worry, Gauri is very smart.

277
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:22,242
She will teach you how to hunt.

278
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,124
Sir, I'm worried about this girl.
She roams around all day.

279
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:32,059
She has grown so big,
but she is not worldly wise.

280
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:35,654
Her 'aanu' is a few days away.
Know what 'aanu' is?

281
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,192
Her groom will come to take her.
She'll have to go to her in-law's

282
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,068
home.
She will be burdened

283
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:44,674
with responsibility.
I don't know what will happen then.

284
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:54,207
Don't worry, everything
will be fine with time.

285
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:57,678
What does your son-in-law do?
- He's working with the railways.

286
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:00,221
Railways?
- Yes. It surprises me too.

287
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:04,227
No one used to do a job before.
Everyone worked in the fields.

288
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:06,229
But times change.

289
00:48:07,698 --> 00:48:09,689
But Gauri is lucky.
I've got a good son-in-law.

290
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:13,226
What does he work as?
- He's at a good post. A ticket man.

291
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:27,240
Ticket man?
- Yes. He checks everyone's tickets.

292
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:32,051
Ticket collector?
- Yes. He earns a good salary.

293
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:35,123
He even earns extra.
- Extra?

294
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:38,251
I mean, tips.

295
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,741
Wash your hands.
- What are you doing!

296
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:55,143
Why did you bother?
I have brought my food along.

297
00:48:55,279 --> 00:49:00,148
It's not much, just a poor farmer's
fare; only buttermilk and rotla.

298
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:02,752
Please eat.
- But I'm carrying food.

299
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:06,279
So what? You will have to eat.
- You are our guest.

300
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:09,756
Eat for my sake,
it will make me happy.

301
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:14,288
Give it to your father too.
- You eat first. Guest first.

302
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:19,291
Water?

303
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:24,774
Can I wash my hands here?

304
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:32,976
Eat... you didn't eat anything.

305
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,242
<i>Please eat... a little more.</i>

306
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:43,248
Father.

307
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,283
Sir, I'll take your leave now.
I have to go.

308
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:19,158
I have to go far.
- Where?

309
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:21,764
Tansa. I have fields even there.

310
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:26,292
Gauri, take care of him.
Make his stay comfortable.

311
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,294
Good day.
- Good day.

312
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,254
The mattress is laid.
You can take rest.

313
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:51,123
How far is Tansa?
- 3 miles.

314
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:54,253
3 miles!
- Yes. Father goes there everyday.

315
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:57,724
You are not eating lunch?
- I ate long ago.

316
00:50:58,268 --> 00:51:00,736
Who is this for?
- For Sheni.

317
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:05,274
I have to take care of her too.
When I leave for my in-laws...

318
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:08,277
who will feed her?
I keep worrying about that.

319
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:10,737
Who is Sheni? Your sister?

320
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:15,751
No, a blackbird, my pet.

321
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:19,153
She's gone to pick grains.
She will come now.

322
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:21,280
When she sees there is
no food, she screeches.

323
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:32,234
Gauri, your husband
works with the railways?

324
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:49,242
Father told you?

325
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:55,725
What's his name?

326
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:04,997
What's his name?
- Dhut! I can't take his name.

327
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:17,736
You can write.
Write his name and show me.

328
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,757
What is the matter?

329
00:52:39,703 --> 00:52:43,696
Look, he...
- Look, my blackbird!

330
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:46,241
Sheni was born on that
mango tree.

331
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,702
One morning, I saw Sheni
fallen on the floor.

332
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:54,240
Good I was passing by. I brought
her home and put her in a cage.

333
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:58,119
Her mother used to come everyday.
She would give her butterflies to eat.

334
00:52:58,255 --> 00:52:59,244
I used to give her rice.

335
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:04,116
One day she was missing.
I thought it was better.

336
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:06,252
Who would look after her everyday?

337
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:10,733
But when I returned from the
fields, I saw she was back here.

338
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:14,499
She puffed herself, shook her
neck and said, 'give me food! '

339
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:20,266
Since that day, she leaves every
morning, and returns at mealtime.

340
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:25,748
But why hasn't she come yet today?
Ah! Maybe because you are here.

341
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:32,017
Go inside and take rest.
- But... I don't want to rest.

342
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:33,211
What a bother!

343
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:26,732
Listen! Come here.
Come... Sheni has come.

344
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:30,269
Sheni, my blackbird. Come.

345
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:37,209
Damn! She flew away.

346
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,214
Okay, tell me, why is
everyone so scared of you?

347
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:46,220
The birds, Sheni.
Only Sheetal is not scared of you.

348
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:51,700
You won't take rest?

349
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:58,969
Gauri, whose picture
is that in the room?

350
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:02,109
Which one?
- There's only one picture in the room

351
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,644
Nice face. Who is he?

352
00:55:15,189 --> 00:55:18,989
Nobody.
- It is somebody's.

353
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:21,585
How is he related to you?

354
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:25,321
He's not.

355
00:55:36,611 --> 00:55:38,602
I know whose photo it is.

356
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:48,612
Your husband.

357
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:03,230
Oh! So you know him?
- Yes. He is very evil.

358
00:56:03,638 --> 00:56:06,630
You are right.
Know what he's written to me?

359
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,369
That I should write to him everyday.

360
00:56:08,643 --> 00:56:12,044
He's sent me coloured paper,
envelope, pen, everything.

361
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:15,639
But I don't have the time.
I have to work all day.

362
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,644
And the post office is also
very far from here.

363
00:56:19,053 --> 00:56:21,647
And I shouldn't be writing
to him either now.

364
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:28,652
How do you know him?
- Even I work with the railways.

365
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:33,667
Oh! Do you have a senior officer
named Shome in your office?

366
00:56:34,669 --> 00:56:35,658
Mr. Shome.

367
00:56:42,677 --> 00:56:45,077
I've heard he
reports about everyone.

368
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,672
My husband wrote Mr. Shome
has reported about him too.

369
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,684
Has Mr. Shome
reported about you too?

370
00:56:51,686 --> 00:56:54,678
No.
- He says Mr. Shome is very bad.

371
00:56:54,756 --> 00:56:57,691
He even dismissed his son
from the job.

372
00:56:57,759 --> 00:57:00,091
He's evil, just like Sheetal.

373
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:02,094
He gets angry with everyone.

374
00:57:03,698 --> 00:57:07,691
You are right.
Do you know Jadhav accepts bribes?

375
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:09,703
What? Bribe?

376
00:57:11,706 --> 00:57:14,368
You also call it bribe?
He doesn't accept bribes.

377
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:18,635
He gets a salary from the railways,
and extra income from passengers.

378
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:22,649
I mean, he gets tips.
- Tips and bribes are the same thing.

379
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:24,651
No! You don't know anything.

380
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:31,386
The truth is, he makes the
passengers journey comfortable.

381
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:35,652
And they tip him in return.
That's not bribe.

382
00:57:37,198 --> 00:57:41,396
Know what the truth is?
No one gives Mr. Shome any money.

383
00:57:41,669 --> 00:57:44,069
That is why he is jealous
and reports about everyone.

384
00:57:44,672 --> 00:57:46,663
I know him very well!

385
00:57:46,741 --> 00:57:50,404
Is it? You know him?
- I've not seen his face.

386
00:57:50,678 --> 00:57:54,079
But I do know how he must be.

387
00:57:57,685 --> 00:57:59,414
I think more hunters have come.

388
00:57:59,687 --> 00:58:01,678
Hurry, or they will make
all the birds fly away.

389
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:06,015
Wait!

390
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:33,381
Take, wear this.
- What is this?

391
00:58:33,654 --> 00:58:35,383
Clothes. Wear them.

392
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,061
What are you looking?
Go inside and change. Hurry!

393
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,657
But why?
- Because I'm telling you.

394
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:50,067
Seeing your dress,
the birds will get scared.

395
00:58:50,671 --> 00:58:54,402
Don't you remember? Father said
hunting is done differently here.

396
00:58:54,675 --> 00:58:56,666
So I'll have to
wear these clothes?

397
00:58:56,744 --> 00:58:59,076
Yes.
- I've never heard of such a thing!

398
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,679
How would you?
You've come only today.

399
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:03,410
I understand that.
- Then why are you taking so long?

400
00:59:03,684 --> 00:59:05,675
Go!
- Must I?

401
00:59:05,753 --> 00:59:06,742
Yes.

402
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:09,016
You think the birds won't
fly away seeing me in this dress?

403
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,684
No. You got busy talking now.
Go!

404
00:59:13,694 --> 00:59:14,626
Over there?

405
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:17,620
But why?

406
00:59:29,644 --> 00:59:35,640
<i>What now?... Why did you come out?
You're worst than children.</i>

407
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,108
What happened?

408
00:59:38,653 --> 00:59:44,057
You are joking! Will I have to
wear these clothes to hunt birds?

409
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:50,063
I'll have to dress like a villager?
No, you're joking.

410
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:55,263
God! You don't even
understand that much.

411
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,662
The birds here don't recognise
the clothes you are wearing.

412
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:02,675
Seeing your clothes, they will
understand you are not a local...

413
01:00:02,743 --> 01:00:06,076
you are a stranger. Seeing a
stranger, they will get scared.

414
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,272
If they get scared, they will fly
away. And if the birds fly away...

415
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,410
who will you hunt? You understand?

416
01:00:20,027 --> 01:00:23,019
The clothes are dirty.
They are stinking.

417
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:26,028
No, it's okay. The birds
recognise these clothes.

418
01:00:26,634 --> 01:00:27,623
Let me see.

419
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:43,044
It's small.
- No, it's okay. Stand up.

420
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:46,051
No, you're very tall.
Sit down.

421
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:48,644
Why? What do you want to do?
- Won't you wear the turban?

422
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:51,047
Turban? No, it's okay like that.

423
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:55,060
Then you won't be able to hunt. The
birds will know you have come to hunt.

424
01:01:00,668 --> 01:01:04,661
Have patience.
Let me wear the turban.

425
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:10,667
See what I make of you.
You'll look like a villager.

426
01:01:26,627 --> 01:01:29,619
What is this?
I'll have to look like this?

427
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:32,029
Let me see.
How many fingers are these?

428
01:01:34,035 --> 01:01:36,367
Maybe two.
- And now?

429
01:01:36,637 --> 01:01:38,969
Four.
- Right.

430
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,373
Now even if you go near them,
they won't be scared.

431
01:01:42,643 --> 01:01:44,634
They will think you are a farmer.
- Because you say so.

432
01:01:44,712 --> 01:01:47,044
Watch what happens. Wear these.

433
01:01:48,649 --> 01:01:49,638
These?

434
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:58,056
They don't know how to hunt...

435
01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:02,060
and they are out hunting.

436
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:04,653
Wait.

437
01:02:10,671 --> 01:02:14,004
Take this... and give me that... give!

438
01:02:14,608 --> 01:02:16,599
If the birds see the gun in your
hand, it'll all be over.

439
01:02:16,677 --> 01:02:18,941
And if they see it in your hand...
What's going on?

440
01:02:19,013 --> 01:02:20,947
I'll go under cover.
- Under cover?

441
01:02:21,015 --> 01:02:22,346
Yes.
- And I?

442
01:02:22,616 --> 01:02:25,016
Like people go.
- Carrying a stick? - Yes.

443
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:28,952
And go close to the bird?
Very close?

444
01:02:29,623 --> 01:02:32,023
And how will I kill them?
With the stick?

445
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:35,618
No, don't use the stick.
I'll give you your gun.

446
01:02:42,636 --> 01:02:44,627
Let's go... take.

447
01:03:00,654 --> 01:03:03,054
My luggage is inside,
will anyone steal it?

448
01:03:03,157 --> 01:03:05,148
No.
- Wait a minute.

449
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:24,339
We'll go to the river side.

450
01:03:24,612 --> 01:03:30,016
We'll be able to see from a distance
where the birds are perched...

451
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:31,106
from the ghost house.

452
01:04:01,649 --> 01:04:04,641
Where are you going?
- Ghost house. Come.

453
01:04:33,614 --> 01:04:34,603
Whose house is this?

454
01:04:35,015 --> 01:04:38,348
It was the king's earlier.
No one lives here now.

455
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:40,610
I've heard there are ghosts here.

456
01:04:46,026 --> 01:04:48,620
What?
- It's beautiful!

457
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:53,623
When I was little,
father used to tell me a story.

458
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:57,034
He used to say it used to
be very hot in olden times.

459
01:04:57,638 --> 01:05:00,971
In his palace, the king would feel
very uncomfortable in the heat.

460
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:05,034
So he would come to the riverside,
here, in this bungalow.

461
01:05:05,646 --> 01:05:09,377
And he would stay here all summer.
It is never hot here.

462
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:12,642
A nice breeze blows here.
A cool breeze.

463
01:05:29,603 --> 01:05:36,008
Look, there was a swing here.
The queen would swing on it all day.

464
01:05:42,283 --> 01:05:49,621
"The princess sways on the
swing... "

465
01:05:50,624 --> 01:05:56,620
"with her friends"

466
01:06:02,636 --> 01:06:05,628
And in the evening, the king
and queen would come and sit here...

467
01:06:05,706 --> 01:06:08,368
and look at the river.

468
01:06:08,642 --> 01:06:10,633
The king would narrate
stories to the queen.

469
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:13,043
He knew many stories.

470
01:06:13,647 --> 01:06:16,377
He would sometimes tell her stories
of other countries...

471
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:19,642
sometimes of battles,
and sometimes about hunting.

472
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,656
There were no ghosts in those times,
so how would he tell her ghost

473
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:29,655
stories?
He would even tell her stories of

474
01:06:30,664 --> 01:06:38,070
lion, tigers, and even deer.
And listening to stories, the

475
01:07:09,703 --> 01:07:10,692
queen... Hey! Look! Over there!
They flew away.

476
01:07:24,651 --> 01:07:28,052
Let's go on the hill,
the sand dune.

477
01:07:59,686 --> 01:08:07,684
<i>Stay here. Come when I call you.
- Wait... I locked it.</i>

478
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:27,617
Birds have come. Lots of them.
They'll stay here now. For very long.

479
01:11:27,694 --> 01:11:31,027
Don't be hasty. Come.

480
01:12:04,665 --> 01:12:10,661
Don't make noise. Come.
No noise.

481
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:13,665
You know the birds are very smart.
- The gun.

482
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:15,599
You'll get it in time.

483
01:12:30,624 --> 01:12:32,615
You brought the stick?
- It's over there.

484
01:13:52,305 --> 01:13:57,641
So much breeze, so much sand.
You cannot see clearly.

485
01:14:29,009 --> 01:14:30,601
The birds will come again.

486
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,611
Can you pose as a tree?
- Tree?

487
01:14:43,623 --> 01:14:45,614
Wait, I'll be back.

488
01:16:07,641 --> 01:16:09,632
What is all this?
- Wait.

489
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:15,638
You'll have to pose as a tree.
- Tree?

490
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,642
Yes. I have brought this
from the village close by.

491
01:16:20,053 --> 01:16:24,387
You won't have any problem,
just stand still for some time.

492
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:27,388
The birds will think
you really are a tree.

493
01:16:27,661 --> 01:16:28,650
<i>No... no.</i>

494
01:17:36,663 --> 01:17:40,064
Climb up... higher up... slowly.

495
01:18:39,259 --> 01:18:42,660
He's not dead, he's alive.
The bullet didn't hit him.

496
01:18:44,664 --> 01:18:48,657
The gunshot scared him and
he fell down. Only out of fear.

497
01:19:20,633 --> 01:19:25,036
I'll leave, I have
to walk a long distance.

498
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:31,033
Tell your father
his daughter is very good.

499
01:19:31,644 --> 01:19:36,047
Won't you take him along?
- I forgot.

500
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:40,050
You can keep it as a pet.
- Let's see.

501
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:43,383
I've heard they cannot
live without their partner.

502
01:19:43,656 --> 01:19:45,055
Even I've heard that.

503
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,033
You have walked far enough.
Go back, I'll manage from here.

504
01:20:39,646 --> 01:20:40,635
Aaojo (come again)

505
01:20:44,651 --> 01:20:47,051
Say, 'Bhalle' (I will)
- Bhalle?

506
01:20:57,664 --> 01:20:58,653
Listen.

507
01:21:08,675 --> 01:21:10,074
Want to say something?

508
01:21:11,678 --> 01:21:14,613
Jadhav's taking money
like that is wrong.

509
01:21:16,015 --> 01:21:19,007
That's what you said.
- Yes.

510
01:21:20,019 --> 01:21:23,614
Then I'll write to him.
He'll never do it again.

511
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:25,021
He'll surely heed me.

512
01:21:27,627 --> 01:21:34,624
Tell me, do you know Mr. Shome
who is in your office?

513
01:21:35,635 --> 01:21:40,038
Do you know him?
- Why?

514
01:21:42,642 --> 01:21:45,042
Ask him not to dismiss Jadhav.

515
01:21:45,645 --> 01:21:48,045
He will never do this again.

516
01:21:48,648 --> 01:21:51,640
If he loses his job,
he won't come to take me...

517
01:21:51,718 --> 01:21:53,652
and I won't be able
to go to my in-laws home.

518
01:21:55,655 --> 01:21:58,385
But all this you are asking
me to tell him...

519
01:21:58,658 --> 01:22:02,651
Even he is working,
he has to follow rules.

520
01:22:04,664 --> 01:22:06,655
Yet, will you tell him?

521
01:22:11,871 --> 01:22:13,065
I'm going.

522
01:25:13,653 --> 01:25:16,588
Hey! You're back?

523
01:25:21,994 --> 01:25:26,988
I was thinking, I'm alone.
What will I do with this bird?

524
01:25:30,603 --> 01:25:33,003
You can keep him like
a pet, like Sheni.

525
01:25:33,606 --> 01:25:37,337
You keep him.
You will take good care of him.

526
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:41,011
But you caught him with so
much difficulty. You keep him.

527
01:25:43,616 --> 01:25:47,609
You love birds, don't you?
You keep him.

528
01:25:47,687 --> 01:25:51,020
You really are giving it to me?
- Yes.

529
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:54,024
He will be good company
for your Sheni.

530
01:25:54,627 --> 01:25:59,621
And then, he won't be afraid of you.
Everyone is afraid of me.

531
01:26:01,634 --> 01:26:04,626
I'll leave, it's very late.

532
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:07,628
Say aaojo.

533
01:26:11,644 --> 01:26:13,635
Next time I come here,
I'll surely hear you sing.

534
01:27:46,672 --> 01:27:48,401
Since how many years
are you working here?

535
01:27:48,674 --> 01:27:51,666
It's five years now.

536
01:27:52,678 --> 01:27:55,670
And before that?
- This is my first job.

537
01:27:57,683 --> 01:28:00,083
Where did you get
this wrong training?

538
01:28:01,687 --> 01:28:03,416
You've become an
expert very soon.

539
01:28:03,689 --> 01:28:05,680
I don't understand.

540
01:28:08,694 --> 01:28:12,687
Read it, you will
understand everything.

541
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:15,633
Why don't you take it?

542
01:28:16,636 --> 01:28:18,035
Shall I?
- Yes.

543
01:28:22,642 --> 01:28:23,631
Read it.

544
01:28:31,651 --> 01:28:33,642
See what you've been doing.

545
01:28:36,656 --> 01:28:38,055
Give it to me.

546
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:53,664
Take, burn it.
Wear the ash as a charm.

547
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:01,670
<i>Listen... I spared you this time.</i>

548
01:29:04,684 --> 01:29:06,675
Hereafter, think carefully
about how you work.

549
01:30:46,652 --> 01:30:48,643
I'll hunt birds today.

550
01:31:37,636 --> 01:31:43,632
After Mr. Shome left, that girl got a
letter from her husband, Jadhav Patel.

551
01:31:44,643 --> 01:31:47,635
In the end, he had
written, 'my job was saved'

552
01:31:48,647 --> 01:31:51,047
'I have been transferred
to a big junction'

553
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:56,644
'Know what a big junction means?
More money'

554
01:31:59,644 --> 01:32:03,644
