1
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,760
Priya, where's my blade?

2
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,570
Must be near the sink.
- Okay.

3
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,300
I am putting the
clothes in the machine.

4
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,140
Divya, wash the
white ones separately.

5
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,210
Or else they will get
coloured as well. - Okay.

6
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,780
Put my clothes in too, Aunt.
- Fine, put them in.

7
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,050
Deepa. I'm getting late.
Quickly get me tea.

8
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,650
Right away. Just a second.

9
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,660
Priya, please give Manoj tea. I have
to get the children ready. - Okay.

10
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,330
Riya, quickly drink your milk.
You'll miss your school bus.

11
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,740
Divya. Divya.
- Yes.

12
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,310
Have this kept in the prayer room.
- Okay.

13
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,050
The milk has curdled again.
It's just too much.

14
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,080
Good morning, brother.
- Morning.

15
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,420
How was your first
night in the new house?

16
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,260
Like always. - Really. You seem to
be experienced about first nights.

17
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,030
Of course. I have two children.

18
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,420
Wait to go, brother.

19
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,440
Fetch it quickly. I am getting late.

20
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,770
Mannu, please check the cable
connection before leaving for office.

21
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,640
We couldn't watch
our serial yesterday.

22
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,310
Gas, electricity, water... they
aren't worried about these things.

23
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,540
But they create a stir
for no cable connection.

24
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,210
Mom, the serial starts at 1 o'clock.

25
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,350
Why are you whining already?

26
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,120
What? I couldn't hear anything.

27
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,520
Mummy, your son is
mocking our serial.

28
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,160
Okay. Brother, hold on.
- What happened?

29
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,460
What's wrong with the tea?
It tastes different.

30
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,730
I've used milk powder.
The milk curdled again.

31
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,130
Try to adjust today.
- The milk curdled again.

32
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,400
Yes.
- It's not a good omen.

33
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,440
What's wrong?
- The milk curdled yesterday.

34
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,600
And today as well.
That's not a good omen at all.

35
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,140
Mom. Mom, sit. Take a seat.
- sit.

36
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,270
sit, let me explain it to you.
- But you know, it's...

37
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,410
sit, let me explain it to you.

38
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,210
Look, brother and I used all of
our savings to buy this flat. - Yes.

39
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,350
Now, this flat won't be ours...

40
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,050
...until we don't repay the
loan in the next 20 years.

41
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,620
so, forget all the bad omens.

42
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,020
Because we are going to
live in this house happily...

43
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,420
...for the next 20 years.
- Yes.

44
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,620
Brother, please tell her.
- Of course.

45
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,030
Uncle.
- Young man, that's not a toy.

46
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,330
Your uncle had to pay a
lot of money to buy this.

47
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,370
Go to school. Come on, go.
- Come on. Get ready quickly.

48
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,500
We are getting late.
- Have your breakfast.

49
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,540
The children these days go
straight for the mobile phones.

50
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,600
You will get late for school.
- Mom, last cartoon.

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,200
Don't watch so much T.V., or else
you will have to wear spectacles.

52
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,440
Grandma, aunt and you
watch T.V. The entire day.

53
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,280
You never had to wear spectacles.

54
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,050
Quiet. You have
started back-answering...

55
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,350
...since you started going to school.

56
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,480
Come on, eat.

57
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,120
Come on. Let's go to school.

58
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,190
Brother, talk to him.
- I tried to, but he never listens.

59
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,320
Mother, we are getting late.

60
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,990
I'll take them to their pickup spot.
- Okay. - Come on, let's leave.

61
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,030
Bye. Bye.
- Bye. All the best. - Bye, mom.

62
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,070
Brother, don't forget me.
- I thought you forgot about it.

63
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,060
Anyway.
- What?

64
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,370
Be back before 6
o'clock in the evening.

65
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,380
Yeah, I will be back. Bye, Mom.
Bye, everyone. - Bye.

66
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,470
Have your breakfast.
- I'll have it at college.

67
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,520
This girl never eats anything.

68
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
Mannu.
- What is it?

69
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,050
You still haven't put up the
pictures in the prayer room.

70
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,750
sorry, brother. I didn't
get the time yesterday.

71
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,080
I will certainly get it done today.

72
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,220
Promise!
- Promise.

73
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,350
Don't forget to do it by evening.

74
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,450
Okay, Mom. I'm leaving.
- Okay, son. Bye.

75
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,620
I am getting late as
well. I'm leaving.

76
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,720
We'll meet in the evening.
- Bye.

77
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,160
Fine, Mom.
- Bye.

78
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,630
see you, mother.
- Bye, dear.

79
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,630
Mom, I am leaving.
- Fine.

80
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,770
Mom, I am leaving!
- Go.

81
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,640
Mom, I am leaving.
- Why are you blowing at my ears?

82
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,040
If you want to say goodbye
to Priya, then go inside.

83
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,210
she's taking a bath.
- No Mom, I meant you. Fool.

84
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,140
strange.

85
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,010
sir! sir, your dog!
- No.

86
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,280
Come back. Harry, no. Down, boy.

87
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,510
Down, boy.
- sir, please. Keep your dog away.

88
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,420
Who is it?
- sir, my name is Manohar.

89
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,020
And I recently
shifted to flat number 13B.

90
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,030
Oh, hello. My name is Kaamdar.

91
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,630
The watchman was just talking
about your family. - Really!

92
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,000
For the past two
weeks your carpenters...

93
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,730
...were creating quite a racket.
- I am really sorry.

94
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,240
I tried to tell them. But
you know how these people are.

95
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,110
No problem. Actually,
it's a new building.

96
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,740
No one has the right to complain.

97
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,620
But yes, I do. The
Lord took away my sight.

98
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,480
But I still have ears to listen.

99
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,030
But if you keep making such noise...

100
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,460
...I will have to use earplugs.

101
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,560
I am so sorry.

102
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,220
By the way, I am
getting late. Can I leave?

103
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,100
sir, next Friday I have a holiday.

104
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,760
If you wish, you can have
lunch with me and my family.

105
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,100
What do you say?

106
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,640
sure. Why not? I will surely come.

107
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,470
see you, bye. Bye, Harry.
- Bye.

108
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,440
Mr. Manohar.
- Yes.

109
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,580
Will you walk down 13 floors?

110
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,540
There's a lift. Let's use that.

111
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,210
Actually, the lift is not working.

112
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,590
I thought i'd tell the
watchman on my way out.

113
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,020
Oh, fine.

114
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,690
Come, Harry.

115
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,650
stupid lift.

116
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,570
Watchman!

117
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,350
You called, sir.
- slowly, man. Not so hard.

118
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,390
Do you know my flat, 13B?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,050
Just go there
between 1 pm to 1:30pm...

120
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,070
...put up a few
pictures in the prayer room...

121
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,570
Fine, sir.
- Here, keep this.

122
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,440
Listen, don't go there between
1 pm to 1:30pm. Go after that.

123
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,130
They will be watching TV,
and will kill you. - Fine, sir.

124
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,230
Okay, I am leaving.
- Okay.

125
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,370
Watchman.
- sir.

126
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,550
The lift of our building is
not working properly. - Yes, sir.

127
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,180
Call the service company and ask
them to repair it. - Fine, sir.

128
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,310
I will get it done. Okay.

129
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,450
I am leaving.
- Okay. - Okay, sir.

130
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,540
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

131
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,170
He will get you out.

132
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,310
Morning, sir.
- Morning.

133
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,440
Hey, what's up?
- Morning, sir.

134
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,210
Has the concrete arrived?
- Forget the concrete.

135
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,780
Tell me about your new house.

136
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,050
The house is simply amazing.
- Is it?

137
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,060
When I open the window of
my flat on the 13th floor...

138
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,590
...it feels like Manhattan.
- Very good.

139
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,390
And the cross ventilation is
simply outstanding. - Really.

140
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,690
Just a minute.
- Hello.

141
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,330
I don't need any loan.
I am already in debt.

142
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,060
Pestering people. I think
the ad agency gets our number...

143
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,200
...before we do.

144
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,330
New phone, new house. You
are on a roll. - Listen.

145
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,280
I got it on discount. It's
a very cheap phone. - Liar.

146
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,410
What's wrong?

147
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,250
Get it changed from
wherever you bought it.

148
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,290
There's a problem with the lens.

149
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,420
It was fine this morning.

150
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,130
smile. You are looking handsome.

151
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,330
Alright. - I think Gulabi
will be floored. - Of course.

152
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,350
There's no problem with the phone.

153
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,110
My 7-year-old nephew
took that picture.

154
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,520
He must have shaken
the mobile. Get that.

155
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,320
Are all the workers present?
- Yes, sir.

156
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,560
Tell me, Laxmi. If he's not
my child, then whose is it?

157
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,260
What can I say?
- Laxmi, say something.

158
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,200
They always end it so abruptly.

159
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,070
Laxmi didn't get a
chance to tell him the truth...

160
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,610
...and they ended the programme.

161
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,670
Mummy, you watch the
programme so seriously.

162
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,140
You should start writing one.

163
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,770
Our TV programme will be
a hit, right? - Quiet.

164
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,610
Priya, 'shubh
Vivaah' will start now.

165
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,850
Bring the remote quickly.
Change the channel.

166
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,250
Hurry up.

167
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,020
Mummy, tell me what
happened last week.

168
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,330
Last week... The door bell rung
and Mandira opened the door.

169
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,070
The music was so scary...

170
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,900
Mummy, there's no one.

171
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,630
Must be the gas cylinder guy.

172
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,110
Change it.
- Press it.

173
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,710
Come on. - What's wrong?
- I cannot change it.

174
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,240
Just a minute. I'll try it.

175
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,370
You will make me
miss "shubh Vivaah".

176
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,850
The battery must be dead.
Change it from the panel.

177
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,810
Hurry up. It's time
for the serial to start.

178
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,090
Mummy, I cannot change the channel.

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,260
Is something wrong with the T. V?
- I don't know.

180
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,000
What's this?
- seems to be a new serial.

181
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,110
New serial. New
house and new serial.

182
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,870
"Fine! Everything is fine!"

183
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,740
And anyway, "shubh
Vivaah" had become very boring.

184
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,680
"Everything is fine."

185
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,810
"Everything is fine."

186
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,720
"Everything is fine."

187
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,650
Look, Mother. After all the
tribulations and difficulties...

188
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,780
...our house looks so wonderful.

189
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,650
It really is beautiful. But son...

190
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,920
...did we need to pay
such a big price for it?

191
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,900
Mother, your
happiness is priceless to us.

192
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Brother and I have taken a loan.

193
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,760
And Mother, we will
repay this loan soon enough.

194
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,740
Watchman.

195
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,290
Oh God, what a punishment.

196
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,740
What's wrong? Why are you gasping?

197
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,170
You don't know. I had
to climb up 13 floors.

198
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,870
I told the watchman that
the lift is not working.

199
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,000
But he didn't do anything about it.

200
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,110
Give it to me.
- Thanks.

201
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,150
Oh God.
- What?

202
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,750
You still haven't put up the
pictures. - What can I do?

203
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,020
I gave Rs.50 to that watchman for
putting them up. Didn't he come?

204
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,000
He did, and also tried. But
he couldn't bore the nails in.

205
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,000
I think there's a beam here.
- What?

206
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,900
As an engineer's wife,
you know everything.

207
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,600
There's a beam through the
entire room. - Could be.

208
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,910
Okay, do one thing. Get
me a hammer. I will do it.

209
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,600
Before brother
arrives and hammers me.

210
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,740
Fine.

211
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,820
Only after her family ran into
trouble, did she realise it.

212
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,990
Now she'll realise there's
a delay, but not denial.

213
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,670
she'll know it now.

214
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:50,010
Who? - I always said so,
but you never believed me.

215
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,740
Did you see that now? - Listen.
What is mom gossiping about?

216
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,850
About the daily soap operas.

217
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,650
Oh God. - she couldn't see
today's episode. she missed it.

218
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,310
so, she's asking
aunt Kamla about it.

219
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,250
You and your serials.

220
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,590
You've been watching the same
TV programme for many years.

221
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,820
The same story. Doesn't it
make any difference to you?

222
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,330
Darling, why don't you
watch some episodes?

223
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,620
And then we can discuss them.

224
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,790
Forget it.
- Don't mock me.

225
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,270
Faces change.

226
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,210
she joins in again.

227
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,040
Look at her role...

228
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,020
Just a minute. Mannu, why
are you creating a racket?

229
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,090
Do it slowly. I am
talking on the phone.

230
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,280
Yes, Kamla.

231
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,350
Mannu, didn't you hear?

232
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,370
Oh God. Damn it!

233
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,670
What happened? You are just...

234
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,180
What do you think? I am hurt. Get
some ice. - I'll get it right away.

235
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,680
Mummy, see what happened.
- What happened? What happened?

236
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,150
I got hurt.
- What was the need?

237
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,260
You came home late from work.
You should be resting...

238
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,760
And you are doing this. - What a
wonderful mother. Don't be silly.

239
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,960
No, nothing.
- Mannu, you... Here, keep this.

240
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,100
God.
- It must be really painful.

241
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,980
It's the 21 st Manohar. Remember
to pay the flat maintenance fee.

242
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,820
That's all. What's this?
Lower your feet.

243
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,830
Come on, your mummy is waiting
with the milk. - Papa, Papa.

244
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,350
And you all are just... Papa, Papa.

245
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,360
Brother, the milk has curdled again.

246
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,900
since we arrived in this house, I
haven't had a descent cup of tea.

247
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,160
This has become daily routine now.
- Forget it.

248
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,670
Hello, good morning.
Welcome to "Hum se Door."

249
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,940
Just a minute. Go back.
- Have you seen a ghost?

250
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,640
That's Dr. shinde.
- Right.

251
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,710
Call mother. - There are many people
who... - Mother, look who's on T.V.

252
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,910
...who's seen a ghost.
- Who is it? - Your boyfriend.

253
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,650
Most of the people...
- What? - What are you doing?

254
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,780
What are you saying?

255
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,980
Many of them are
enemies of human beings.

256
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,990
Hey. - Yes, right.
- That's the doctor.

257
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,250
Let me sit. What's he telling?

258
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh God, such enthusiasm.
- Let me sit.

259
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,690
Everything is a joke for you.

260
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,790
That's right.

261
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,360
You know, I am sitting here
hale and hearty because of him.

262
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,130
Or else I would
have been dead by now.

263
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,330
Mother, don't say such things.

264
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,060
You know, we
consulted so many doctors.

265
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,240
But he was the only one
who diagnosed my problem.

266
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,780
so, why are you
getting so emotional?

267
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,400
Come, let's...
- Be quiet. Let me hear.

268
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,670
Doctor.
- Hello. - You are considered...

269
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,840
...to be one of the best
general practitioners in India.

270
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,350
But why are you on the discussion
panels for paranormal behaviour?

271
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,660
I was very young when
my parents passed away.

272
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:02,900
I had a younger brother.
I brought him up like my own child.

273
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,330
But he passed away in an accident.

274
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,150
I wanted to tell my
brother how much I love him.

275
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,380
As a doctor, we try to save a human
being as long as he isn't dead.

276
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,650
We try our best to save his
life, but if they still die...

277
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,100
But what after death?

278
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,320
What happened to all
those dead people?

279
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,130
Where are they?

280
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,840
I got interested in this subject
while looking for these answers.

281
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,410
8:30pm. Always late. - Raghav,
where were you? sit here. - Okay.

282
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,740
Priya, bring Raghav's breakfast.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

283
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,220
Are ghosts, spirits and
the after-life, really true?

284
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,350
Or is it just superstition?

285
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,020
Take Newton's third law."Every Force
has an equal and opposite force."

286
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,620
similarly, in spirituality...
if there are Gods and temples...

287
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,730
...then it's necessary to
have an opposite force as well.

288
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,830
Look. - smile, aunt. -
Here's your breakfast.

289
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,240
smile, Aunt.

290
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,910
Divya, eat up.
- Aunt.

291
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,820
Uncle's mobile. He will
scold you today. It'll be fun.

292
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,680
Go and return it to uncle.
- Run quickly.

293
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,380
And if there's life,
there's after-life as well.

294
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,120
And if there are Gods and temples...

295
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,090
...there must be a world of
spirits as well.

296
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,970
But that's my own opinion.
Everyone doesn't have to believe it.

297
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,100
Uncle.

298
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,740
Dennis the Menace,
I told you this is not a toy.

299
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,340
I will get you a toy in the
evening if you want one. - Okay.

300
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,010
Go. You are getting
late for school. - Go on.

301
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,140
How many times have I told you...

302
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,200
...to keep the phone out
of the children's reach?

303
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,050
I do, but he always finds it...
strange... - You are too much...

304
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,660
Mom, just a minute.
- Please, don't take my photograph.

305
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,320
How many times have I asked
you not to?! Please don't do it.

306
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,760
He's a famous personality.

307
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,830
New issue... what is your
opinion about our show.

308
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,150
Mother, it's getting late.
I am leaving. - Fine. - Bye.

309
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,880
Bye.
- Mannu. - Yes.

310
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,080
Remember to send the driller home...

311
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,640
...to put up the photos in
the prayer room. - Fine.

312
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,380
Don't forget.
- I won't, brother.

313
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,160
stupid lift.

314
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,070
Is the driller free?
- Why?

315
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,670
Call him. I have some work.

316
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,750
The driller must be... Hari.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,750
Hari, do you know about my new flat?

318
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,940
Yes, I know.
- I have some work.

319
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,920
Take a taxi. And finish the work.

320
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,260
Good day.
- Yes.

321
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,730
I am the driller, ma'am.
I am coming from the site.

322
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,360
Mr. Manohar has sent me.
- Okay, come in.

323
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,130
Come. Here it is.

324
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,800
I've made the marks. You just
have to bore in the nails. - Fine.

325
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,140
Get it done.
- Yes, madam.

326
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,250
Would you like to have tea
or coffee? - No. - Okay.

327
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,720
Who is it, Priya?
- It's the driller.

328
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,680
I have shown him the
prayer room, Mummy.

329
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,620
Mummy.

330
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,690
Mummy.

331
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,130
Oh God.

332
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,930
Brother. Brother...
Are you fine? Are you fine?

333
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,830
Hey, what happened?

334
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,940
Go... Go... Call the ambulance.
- Yes.

335
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,740
Brother. Brother.

336
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,880
Brother, get up.

337
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,350
Are you fine? Are you fine?

338
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,620
shall we call the doctor?
- No.

339
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,210
Don't call the ambulance.

340
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,230
Come. Rest by the wall. Come on.

341
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,360
Be careful while working.

342
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,930
What if something
had happened to you?

343
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,120
Oh God.

344
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,760
I have been doing this
work for many years now.

345
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,230
I have suffered from
many surprises many times.

346
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,100
But nothing so intense.

347
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,300
It seems like industrial power.
- What?

348
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,700
But, we...

349
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,780
Please get the wiring
checked after sir arrives. - Fine.

350
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,950
There are children in this house.
It's better to be careful. - Yes.

351
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,780
My drill machine.
- Yes, here it is.

352
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,720
Here.

353
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,020
I am not feeling fine.
I will do this work later.

354
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,720
Absolutely. Tomorrow or the day
after, whenever you feel fine.

355
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,790
But please leave now, get a
check up and go home and rest.

356
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,740
Take care and rest.

357
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,620
I was so scared.
The way he screamed...

358
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,720
And there was froth
coming from his mouth.

359
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,220
I didn't know what happened.
- I was so scared.

360
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,850
They don't work carefully.

361
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,020
There's something
wrong in this house.

362
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,830
since we arrived, something
bad is constantly occurring.

363
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,660
The milk curdles everyday.
The prayer room is not ready.

364
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,630
Why do I always feel
there's something in this house...

365
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,040
...other than my family?

366
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,310
Ghosts and spirits,
ghouls. Or someone's soul.

367
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,880
I don't know. But I cannot
talk to anyone about it.

368
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,590
If I mention this to mother,
she will be obstinate...

369
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,180
...about vacating this house.

370
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,190
If brother finds out, he will
arrange for venerations and prayers.

371
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,200
I am scared that something bad
is going to happen in this house.

372
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,930
Mohan! Mohan, my brother.

373
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,800
Why are you so late?
And these sweets?

374
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,770
First, open your mouth.
- But what is the...

375
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,800
Open your mouth. - What's the
matter? - I have been promoted.

376
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,880
Wow. Great news.
- Let me share the entire news.

377
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,620
Tell me. - I got a
salary hike of 10,000 a month.

378
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,350
10,000 a month. Wow.

379
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,250
The loan period for
this house is 20 years.

380
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,630
Now calculate it. We will clear,
the loan in 16 years.

381
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,860
Fantastic, brother.

382
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,860
We were waiting for you.
- sister-in-law.

383
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,660
What's the reason for
that sparkling smile?

384
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,800
There's good news.
- What is it?

385
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,740
Ask your brother. Listen.

386
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,600
You never massage
your hair with oil.

387
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,210
Have you seen the condition of
your hair? It's a complete mess.

388
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,810
Why are you getting
angry with her, Mother?

389
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,350
Actually, that looks good on her.

390
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,210
Mother, ask him to keep quiet.

391
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,870
Why should he? Your
brothers have spoiled you.

392
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,610
What have we done?
- What have you brought for me?

393
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,750
Come. This is for you. And young
man, this is for you. - Thank you.

394
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,730
Uncle, what is this? - That! It's
for Priya. Was it necessary to ask?

395
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,630
see that, Mother. Gifts for the
wife. But nothing for you. - Quiet.

396
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,230
Thank you. Mother,
it's just a cookbook.

397
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,760
Give. Give me this too.

398
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,960
Why are you getting angry?

399
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,640
Mother, if she reads the
cookbook and cooks good food...

400
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,770
...it will benefit all of us.

401
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,180
so, this gift is for all of us.
- Did I ask?

402
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,800
Hey, brother. so,
what is the good news?

403
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,040
I got promoted.
- Again?!

404
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,310
Yes.
- so soon.

405
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,850
Yes.
- There's something better.

406
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,390
I have got a salary
hike of 10,000 a month.

407
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,780
We have taken a loan for a
period of 20 years for this house.

408
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,190
Now calculate it. We will
clear the loan in 15 years.

409
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,830
What's this? The pictures
have still not been put up.

410
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,970
Mom, I sent the driller.
Didn't he come?

411
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,270
He did. There was such chaos.

412
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,170
Freshen up. Priya will
explain it to you. - Okay.

413
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,980
Priya, what's happened? - Take
a bath. I'll explain it to you.

414
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,020
You will have to talk
to the society members.

415
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,190
There's water leaking
through the ceiling.

416
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,630
The stupid watchman must
have forgotten to close the tap.

417
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,030
And the water must
be seeping through.

418
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,660
I will talk to him tomorrow.

419
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,780
Your cookbook is very educational.

420
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,380
The recipes are just to die for.

421
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,680
And it has only non-veg items.

422
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,660
Fine, we will have a feast today.

423
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,830
Get ready, here comes Tarzan-boy.
- Manu.

424
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,860
Go to page number 31.
The interesting stuff.

425
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,140
I can't understand the
head or tails of it.

426
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,880
Do you want me to do this?

427
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,840
I know. Why not
start with a simple one?

428
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,880
Go to page number 44. The easy one.

429
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,150
Do you know it by heart?

430
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,020
show it to me.
- Look.

431
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,660
Look, these small snacks
aren't satisfying at all.

432
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,770
You and I need a seven-course meal.
- shut up.

433
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,800
I will try all of this on you.
- Fine, I will look for another one.

434
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,930
Okay.

435
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,790
Look at this one. This...

436
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,320
Do people really do
such things, Mannu? - Yes.

437
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,160
- Look at this. - Just
a minute. I'll be back.

438
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,200
Manu. What happened, Manu?
- Careful. There's glass.

439
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,470
You are bleeding. Yes, Manu.

440
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,810
The driller was saying that
there's industrial power here.

441
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,980
Industrial power.
- And you should...

442
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,050
That driller is a fool.

443
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,580
The fridge, T.V. And microwave
are working, aren't they? - Yes.

444
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,180
Then how can there
be industrial power?

445
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,980
I know the bulb was a fake one.
That's why it exploded.

446
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,580
I will get it repaired tomorrow.
Let's leave that.

447
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,560
Listen to me. Listen.
- Yes.

448
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,590
Look. - Tell me. - After all that
discussion, I am feeling very hungry.

449
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,000
And I need something to eat
quickly. - Today you're fasting.

450
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,600
Fast? I don't earn all that
money to sleep on an empty stomach.

451
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,670
I want an entire feast
today. Listen to me.

452
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,750
I am talking to you.
- Fine. What would you like to have?

453
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,410
You know what I would
like to have. I would like...

454
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,810
- Leave me.

455
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:18,160
"Walking under the sky,
we arrived at our home."

456
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:29,710
"Our room, that's
covered with clouds..."

457
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,180
"You will find it
only in your dreams."

458
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:43,060
"I have asked the stars to sparkle."

459
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,660
"Call out my name once more."

460
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,630
"Let your desires fly."

461
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:56,410
"Let's share our happiness."

462
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,910
"Wait."

463
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:17,890
"Walking under the sky,
we arrived at our home."

464
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:29,710
"Our room, that's
covered with clouds..."

465
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,110
"You will find it
only in your dreams."

466
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:43,120
"I have asked the stars to sparkle."

467
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,890
"Call out my name once more."

468
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,870
"Let your desires fly."

469
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:56,400
"Let's share our happiness."

470
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,000
"Wait."

471
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,020
Divya. Where are you going?

472
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,820
Will you wear these
clothes for the marriage?

473
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,660
Marriage?! Who's
going for the marriage?

474
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,820
I am going to college. Today
my results are coming out.

475
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,630
It's no use. We know
what's going to happen.

476
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,690
Why are you
wasting petrol and money?

477
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,030
In the last three years you
haven't passed a single subject.

478
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,630
And she won't all her life.
- Mother, you are just...

479
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,110
Come here. Come here.

480
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,970
You know we all love you so much.
- Are you taunting me?

481
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,980
Can't you do a small thing for us?
- What is it?

482
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,640
Just pass in any one subject.
I will buy you any car you'd like.

483
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,850
No. she won't waste her
brother's money at all.

484
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,390
Okay, so as one unit,
mother and son are against me.

485
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,900
What would I have done
without my sisters-in-law?

486
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,430
sister-in-law.
- Yes.

487
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,070
What?
- Give me Rs.500.

488
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,400
Of course.
- My purse.

489
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,000
she's your younger sister.
Give her the money.

490
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,660
There's only 200. Will that do?
- Give it back.

491
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,730
Thank you, sister-in-law.

492
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,740
You know why he is refusing to
attend your friend's marriage?

493
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,410
He is not feeling good.
- He isn't feeling good.

494
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,680
There are two beer
bottles in the fridge.

495
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,880
You can check if you'd like.

496
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,480
I can't say anything else.
- Come here. Hey, failure. Duffer.

497
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,050
Failure in eight subjects.

498
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,850
What is it?

499
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,690
The milk has curdled again.

500
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,630
Won't I get a descent
cup of tea in this house?

501
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:38,040
I got hurt on my face.
I look like a drunkard.

502
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,770
Everyone will laugh at
me in this condition.

503
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,640
I have sent the entire family.

504
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,440
There's someone at the door.
Have that file sent tomorrow.

505
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,780
Okay. Bye.

506
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,510
Coming.

507
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,890
Good morning, sir. Here's my cheek.

508
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,470
You can give me a tight slap.

509
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,660
It's such a nice cheek.
Why should I slap it?

510
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,540
Actually, I invited you for lunch.

511
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,800
But a family wedding came up.

512
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,600
And my entire family
left to attend the wedding.

513
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,610
And I am left alone in
the house, without lunch.

514
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,010
That's fine.

515
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,670
Do you have beer in the afternoon?

516
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,810
Only if I have company.

517
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,750
There's a six-foot
tall company. Come on.

518
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,880
We will have beer together. Come.

519
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,680
sir, come in. I will switch
off the microwave. - Fine.

520
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,460
Harry, come.

521
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,430
Harry.

522
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,620
Come in.

523
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,570
Why are you barking?

524
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,030
Harry.

525
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,580
Come in, Harry. Behave yourself.

526
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,910
I asked you to come in.

527
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,380
Come. Harry, be a good boy now.

528
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,440
Come on.

529
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,980
Come in. Come in.

530
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,390
What's wrong with you, Harry?

531
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,590
What is the matter with you?

532
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,530
Come in now. Come, Harry.

533
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,010
Harry. Harry. Harry.

534
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,070
sir. sir, what's wrong?

535
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,410
sir.

536
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,880
My glasses, Manohar. My stick.

537
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:34,420
I'll pick it up. Your
glasses and stick. - Thank you.

538
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,960
sir, what's wrong? Harry.
I will go get him. - No.

539
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,660
He cannot leave me.

540
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,830
Look. He is calling me.

541
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:49,430
Manohar, something scared him here.

542
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,770
His voice seemed very scared.

543
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,450
Anyway, I will take a
rain-check on the beer today. Fine.

544
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,910
some other day.
- Fine.

545
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,650
sorry. Harry.
- I understand.

546
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,580
Harry.
- Are you okay?

547
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,710
Yes, thank you.

548
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,470
Mother, look at how our
house finally appears.

549
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,060
something bad is happening in
this house since we arrived.

550
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,540
The milk curdles everyday.
The prayer room is still not ready.

551
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,470
There's someone in this
house other than my family.

552
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,670
Ghosts, ghouls,
spectres or someone's soul.

553
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,080
I have been promoted.
- Wow.

554
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,420
I got a salary hike
of 10,000 a month.

555
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,020
Now you calculate it.

556
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,680
We have taken a
20-year loan for this house.

557
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,430
But we will repay
it back in 16 years.

558
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,060
Will you do something for me?
- What?

559
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:07,430
For me, only once... pass
in at least one paper.

560
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,830
I'll buy whichever vehicle you want.

561
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,090
Mohan.
- Yes, Mother.

562
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,800
Ohitra. What?

563
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,410
Oh my God. I have passed.
I don't believe it. I have passed.

564
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,090
It's a miracle, brother.
It's a miracle. - What happened?

565
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,420
You'll be amazed to know.
- What happened?

566
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,620
I have passed in all my exams.
- What?

567
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,430
And I have even
broken my college record.

568
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:14,640
Everything in one go! 69.73%.

569
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,440
Oh my God.
- Congratulations.

570
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,440
Congratulations won't do.

571
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,440
One car for passing one paper.

572
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,780
I've passed in 12 papers,
brother. so you better be prepared.

573
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,450
Where are the others?
- Attending the marriage.

574
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:36,450
The marriage. What was
mama saying the other day?

575
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,460
Hello, sister-in-law.
I have passed. Not just in one...

576
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,930
...but in all the exams.

577
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,400
Hello, sister-in-law.
I have passed. Not just in one...

578
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,800
...but in all the papers.

579
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,870
Tell brother that I passed.

580
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,820
Can't you wait for five minutes?
Is it so important?

581
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,730
Okay, tell me.

582
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,910
Really! Really!

583
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,070
Mannu. Ive been observing...

584
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,800
since you brought that cookbook...

585
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,460
...you have become very naughty.

586
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,940
There's a time for everything.

587
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,070
That's not it.
- Then?

588
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:08,880
Priya, are you feeling fine?
Do you feel nauseous at times?

589
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:15,420
No, why? You are just...
- I was just asking.

590
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,840
Priya, did you... When did we
get mother's medical test done?

591
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,430
Eight to ten months earlier.

592
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:31,830
It's been ten months.
- Yes.

593
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,840
No, that's not right.
I will call Dr. shinde tomorrow.

594
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,640
And take mother,
sister-in-law and Divya along.

595
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:42,450
And get your medical
test done as well.

596
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,450
Why are you being so concerned?

597
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,380
I just want to make sure that
all the women in our family...

598
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,020
...are hale and hearty.
- so sweet.

599
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,590
sure, I will get it done.

600
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,670
K. D.! Listen. Will you take care of
things for two to three hours?

601
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,810
What's wrong?

602
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,680
There's good news.
- What is it?

603
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,940
Priya is expecting.
- Wonderful news.

604
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,080
Thanks.
- Congratulations.

605
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,620
Take the entire day off.
Have fun. I'm there.

606
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,750
I will handle everything.
- sure.

607
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,660
Absolutely, sure.
- Thanks.

608
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,820
Now leave.
- Alright, see you.

609
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,920
All the best.

610
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,050
And listen...
- Yes.

611
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,430
Give my regards to Priya.

612
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,560
And bring sweets along.

613
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,500
sir.
- Who is it?

614
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,450
sir, Manohar.
- Manohar.

615
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,640
What is it? Why
are you honking away?

616
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,380
Can I come with you in the lift?

617
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,000
Have you pressed
the button, Manohar?

618
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,460
The stupid thing doesn't
work only for me. - What?

619
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,470
Nothing.
- There's something...

620
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:22,950
I can smell wonderful
sweets. Flowers too.

621
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,820
some paper packets as well.

622
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,460
Manohar, what are you celebrating?

623
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,550
You are an amazing man, sir.

624
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,830
You are right, sir. I am going
to be a father. - Congratulations.

625
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,960
so, why are you feeling so shy?

626
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,900
It's something to be proud of.
- Thank you.

627
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:49,910
I feel your new house is
very lucky for all of you.

628
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,380
No. I mean, that day I met your
elder brother in the car park.

629
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,920
He was saying that he got promoted.

630
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,650
Last night, Divya
came home with sweets.

631
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,020
she said she passed with
first-class results in her exams.

632
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,580
And now you are sharing good news.

633
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,890
so much good news so quickly.

634
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:15,870
The "Vaast" (Feng shui) of
your house is very good.

635
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,400
You are absolutely right.
It is. It is very nice.

636
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,520
Where's mother?

637
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,430
Divya.

638
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,100
Was it the interesting one?

639
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,700
Or the difficult one?

640
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:53,970
shut up.

641
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,040
Actually, it's the other one.

642
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,470
"Away from pondering eyes."

643
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,080
"Keep it concealed."

644
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,480
"Our love should never be jinxed."

645
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,430
"Let's pilfer the moon."

646
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:51,760
"And keep it just for ourselves."

647
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,960
"Don't let the night know."

648
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:03,980
"I've brought happiness
to ward off grievances."

649
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:12,510
"Life seems like a celebration."

650
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,990
"These small houses
in these big cities."

651
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,960
"How can they hold
so much happiness?"

652
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,460
"Love, happiness, dreams."

653
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,060
"I got everything I wished for."

654
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,800
"These small houses
in these big cities."

655
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,540
"How can they hold
so much happiness?"

656
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,480
"Love, happiness, dreams."

657
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:42,480
"I got everything I wished for."

658
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:07,770
"These days, a small child
visits me in my dreams."

659
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,450
"He tells me everything."

660
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:19,440
"I invited him to come home soon."

661
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,890
"Don't be shy to share happiness."

662
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,480
"It's happiness all around."

663
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:33,470
"I've brought happiness
to ward off grievances."

664
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:41,670
"Life seems like a celebration."

665
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,080
"These small houses
in these big cities."

666
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,680
"How can they hold
so much happiness?"

667
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,690
"Love, happiness, dreams."

668
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,420
"I got everything I wished for."

669
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,020
"These small houses
in these big cities."

670
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:04,090
"How can they hold
so much happiness?"

671
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,630
"Love, happiness, dreams."

672
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,640
"I got everything I wished for."

673
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,650
Priya.
- Yes.

674
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,710
How much do we pay for the cable?
- What?

675
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,450
How much do we pay for the
cable every month? - Rs.200. Why?

676
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,650
If we don't need it,
why not disconnect it?

677
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,460
You want to disconnect the cable.

678
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,660
The last time I gave you a beating,
you were five years old.

679
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,800
If you touch the cable,
I will beat you again.

680
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,670
What's for dinner?
- You were saying something.

681
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,940
I didn't hear it properly.
About disconnecting something.

682
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,410
I was saying, I can shred
the vegetables if you want.

683
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,420
You wanted to disconnect the cable.
I heard it clearly. Why?

684
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:58,420
Yes, I did. I work
hard to earn money.

685
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,680
No one is watching T.V.

686
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,620
If I can save Rs.200, I
can repay my loan faster.

687
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,430
Fine. If you can repay the
house loan by saving Rs.200...

688
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,430
...we don't want this house,
but we do want the cable.

689
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,760
We didn't switch on the T.V. Because
you were at home this afternoon.

690
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,430
And you want to
disconnect the cable.

691
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,700
Come on, we will
watch T.V. Right now.

692
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,430
Come on.
- Yes, go.

693
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:20,030
You know, we watch a new T.V.
Programme these days.

694
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,440
"sab Khairiyat" (Everything's fine).

695
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,450
It's absolutely different
from those daily soap operas.

696
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,040
It also has spectres.
It's really interesting.

697
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,640
Come quickly, Mummy.

698
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,650
Yes, let's watch what's happening.

699
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,980
We missed the past few episodes.

700
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,850
she was pregnant
in the last episode.

701
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,700
What happened?

702
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,800
Why do bad things
happen to good guys?

703
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,730
she had such faith in Lord Ganesha.

704
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,600
And the bad ones are
always depicted well.

705
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,470
Mummy, it's just a programme.
Why are you so tense?

706
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,400
I kept something in the kitchen.

707
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,540
Keep it in the fridge. Go.
- Fine.

708
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,540
Come back soon.

709
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:15,420
You are sneaking a peek and feel
ashamed to watch the show with us.

710
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:16,650
Come out, come on out.

711
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,420
No one will say anything.
- No, Priya. Listen to me...

712
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,430
Mannu, are you fine?
What's wrong with you?

713
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,090
Hello. Hello!

714
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,430
Hello. Hello!

715
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,570
Priya.

716
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,980
Priya. Priya. What's wrong?

717
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,520
Priya. What happened? Priya. Priya.

718
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,380
Priya. Priya. Listen to me.
- Priya...

719
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:46,510
sister-in-law.
- Priya.

720
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,520
Quickly call the ambulance.
- Mother.

721
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,030
Priya.
- What happened to her?

722
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,400
How did this accident occur?

723
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,410
I don't know how she
slipped down the stairs.

724
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,000
she should take
good care of herself.

725
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,480
I don't know how this accident
occur... Doctor, please do something.

726
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,410
I cannot live without her.
If anything happens to her...

727
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,540
...I don't know what I will do.

728
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:20,020
I beg you to tell me.
Will my wife survive?

729
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,650
I will give you anything
you want. Money, wealth...

730
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,950
I will give you everything.

731
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,450
Doctor, I can't stay without her.

732
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,560
Tell me. Doctor, why
don't you say anything?

733
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:31,690
Why are you quiet?

734
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,970
Your silence is scaring me.

735
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,430
Doctor, please tell me.

736
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:40,500
Doctor, please.
Will my wife survive?

737
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,910
Come on, man. Come on.

738
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,500
Will my wife be alive?

739
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,730
Doctor, how is Priya?
- I don't know what to say.

740
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,810
What do you mean? she's
been here for 24 hours.

741
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,410
If you still don't
say anything, then...

742
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,810
Manoj, you are like a family member.

743
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,610
I won't lie to you. We
are trying our best.

744
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:28,820
But she's still critical and
her condition hasn't improved.

745
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,050
But I will do my best.

746
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,920
Doctor, the patient is
in serious condition.

747
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,630
Manoj, what did the doctor say?
- Nothing, Mother.

748
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,040
Nothing! What do
you mean by nothing?

749
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,910
she's been here for 24 hours,
and still... - I don't know, Mother.

750
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,370
But it's not good news.
- Oh God.

751
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,640
What will we tell Mannu?
- No...

752
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,380
I don't understand. If the
doctor cannot tell us, then who can?

753
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,600
Everything will be fine.
- I am scared.

754
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,390
I assure you, everything will
be fine. - How can you say that?

755
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,530
I know everything will
be fine. Try to calm down.

756
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,800
Excuse me, can I switch on the T. V?

757
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,410
Darn it.

758
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,480
Excuse me, doesn't this T.V. Work?

759
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:28,410
No, sir. It's not been
working for the past one week.

760
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,540
Oh god.

761
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,990
Watchman! Watchman!

762
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,130
Come with me.
- What are you doing, sir? sir.

763
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,470
sir.
- How is madam?

764
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,010
Fine.
- sir, the Lord will look after her.

765
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,740
Fine.
- sir, what did the doctor say?

766
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,470
sir, why aren't you telling me?

767
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:33,540
Quiet! Quiet!

768
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,450
Tell me, doctor.
Will my wife survive?

769
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,420
Doctor, please tell me.
Why don't you say something?

770
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,030
Will my wife survive?

771
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:55,760
I am so sorry.

772
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,440
sometimes all the efforts of
the doctor cannot change destiny.

773
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,640
As a doctor, I did my best.

774
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,970
I tried my level best. But
I couldn't save your child.

775
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,710
But your wife, she's
absolutely alright.

776
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,650
Don't worry.

777
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,650
We'll discharge her till tomorrow.

778
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:19,590
I am so sorry.
- No.

779
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,680
I should have been careful, Mannu.

780
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:33,660
A small mistake. I know
how much you love children.

781
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:42,140
What happened? It
wasn't anything grave.

782
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:44,670
You are absolutely alright.

783
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,680
If anything had happened to you,
then I... couldn't have survived.

784
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,660
There's just one
punishment for this.

785
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,830
We will together bear 100 children.

786
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,440
Manu.
- I love you, Priya.

787
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:15,840
I am sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

788
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,780
I am very sorry, Manohar.

789
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,520
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

790
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,450
Is there anything I can do for you?

791
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:32,080
I know you are very happy.

792
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,850
But I didn't know what had
happened to her in the last 24 hours.

793
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:39,000
I conducted every test.

794
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,470
But the results of every
test were contradictory.

795
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,600
And she's going to be
discharged within an hour.

796
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:47,400
And I haven't
given her a small pill.

797
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,810
If you want to say thank you...

798
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,400
...there's a small
temple in the compound.

799
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,610
Go and break a coconut there.
- Okay.

800
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:58,810
And if you want to do something
for me, then get me these medicines.

801
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:02,010
I need to give them to Priya.
- sure.

802
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:03,950
Thanks, Doctor.
- Okay.

803
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,420
I'll be back. Just a minute.

804
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,680
sir, change.

805
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,590
Excuse me, may I have a look
at the paper? - Yes, sure.

806
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,730
Thank you.

807
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:38,040
Where are you going?

808
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,990
Is this the EYE T.V. studios?
- Yes.

809
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,920
Is "sab Khaiyriyat" shot here? - Yes.

810
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,620
Are the writer, producer and
director of this programme here?

811
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,390
Who are you?
- I am a businessman...

812
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:52,800
...and I want to sponsor
this programme. - Okay.

813
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:53,930
Oh, please come in.

814
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:56,730
Come. Come in.

815
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,540
Okays, sir.

816
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,090
Greetings. Welcome
back to "sab Khairiyat."

817
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,750
I am Roshan Abbas, and we are
still discussing the same topic...

818
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:20,450
No, I am not talking about this.

819
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,430
I am talking about the "sab
Khairiyat" that's telecasted...

820
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,630
...everyday at 1 o'clock in
the afternoon on EYE T.V.

821
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,830
This is the shooting
of "sab Khairiyat."

822
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,430
Wait here. I will call the director.

823
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,440
The topic that we are
going to discuss here today...

824
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,500
...will entertain the people...

825
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:40,640
According to Mr. sharma,
everything is fine at home when...

826
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:10,470
Hello.

827
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,480
Hello, excuse me. I need...

828
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:44,970
Love soon turns into a quarrel...

829
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:48,510
We want the answer of
this quarrel right now.

830
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:55,050
He's successful in winning the
first phase of "sab Khairiyat"

831
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:59,030
Till when will the men stay quiet?
Let's start the buzzer round.

832
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,400
Hello. - Hello, Mother
it's Manohar speaking.

833
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,000
Yes, Mannu. What is it?
- How is Priya?

834
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,410
Priya? she's fine. she's sleeping.

835
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,540
Have the children
returned from school?

836
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,340
Children?! No, they still haven't.

837
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:20,010
Mannu, you are disturbing me.

838
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,410
I am at a very
interesting part of the programme.

839
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,150
Is it something important?
Or else call me later.

840
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,020
After half an hour.
- Mother. Just a minute.

841
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:30,620
Which programme are you watching?
- My favourite one. "sab Khairiyat"!

842
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,440
God! Oh God!

843
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,980
Mannu, you have known
me for so many years.

844
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:35,520
When did you notice this
written on my forehead?

845
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,320
silly! Fool! stupid!

846
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:41,150
No, I don't know whether
you are a fool, or am I?

847
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,060
But shivam, I do know that
I lost my child. - I know.

848
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,390
My wife has nearly escaped death.

849
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,520
Please. I am serious.

850
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,130
I think my whole
family is in danger.

851
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,400
Look. I am an educated man.

852
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,940
I could have taken
some priest home...

853
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:58,340
...and held some prayers.

854
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,400
But no. I thought, my good
friend is a police officer.

855
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,000
If I seek his help, he
will give me a solution.

856
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,350
But if you want to laugh
about it, then that's fine.

857
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,540
Enjoy your joke, brother.

858
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:08,950
Hey, Mannu. sorry. sorry.

859
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,220
Listen to me. - It's not a joke,
shiva. It's not a joke.

860
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,380
I am sorry. But if you tell
anyone about this, they'll laugh.

861
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:18,420
Fair enough. - Anyways, now
that you have approached me...

862
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,620
Don't worry, I will
solve the problem.

863
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:23,290
At what time is the
programme telecasted? - 1 o'clock.

864
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,310
They don't even let us
watch the programme.

865
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,510
someone is always ringing the bell.

866
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,450
Go see who it is, Priya.
- You go.

867
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:45,460
"Everyone is happy as
everything is alright."

868
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,620
"Friends, everything is alright."

869
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:49,220
What is it? Why do you
come home whenever you want?

870
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:52,660
There's no food at home. Go away.
- Are you done?

871
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:54,400
Yes.
- Now, meet him.

872
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,660
Hi, shiva.
- Hi.

873
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:57,330
I'm so sorry.
I thought it'd be him alone.

874
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,670
Mummy, look who has come?
- Who is it?

875
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,460
Mom. shiva.
- shiva. After so many days.

876
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,340
Hello, Aunt. - You didn't
even come for the house warming.

877
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,470
I think you have forgotten us.

878
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,600
No Aunt, I haven't
forgotten at all.

879
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,540
But I don't get any time
outside of my responsibilities.

880
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,410
Otherwise why would
I have come today?

881
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,070
Just a minute. Move aside...

882
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:13,020
And how is Manoj? Are
the children fine? - Yes.

883
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,410
They are absolutely fine.

884
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,410
I am so sorry. It's the
same thing at my house.

885
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,190
At least you opened the door.

886
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,880
My mother doesn't even
open the door...

887
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,390
...while watching her
favourite programme.

888
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,160
Manu, we'll talk later.
Let us watch first.

889
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,290
Not here. sit here.
- Okay.

890
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,300
Take a seat. It's very interesting.
- Yes. - Have a seat.

891
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,630
Mannu, I will serve food
during the break. - Fine.

892
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,110
Can you watch T. V?
- Yes.

893
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,100
Keep watching.

894
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:41,370
You're back.
- Eeshwar, that's Gayatri, my wife, .

895
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,970
Hello.

896
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,240
see, I told you so.
That's you. That's you.

897
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,510
Come in.

898
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,660
Hello, Mother. How are you?
- Bless you, son.

899
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:07,470
How are you?
- I'm fine. Just a minute.

900
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:10,600
Excuse me.

901
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:16,010
Hello. Yes, Mr. Madan, how are you?

902
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:17,210
Why did you call?

903
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,210
What?

904
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,420
When did this happen?

905
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:29,960
In the hospital. Which one?

906
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,630
But is she fine?

907
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:38,040
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

908
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,230
What happened?

909
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:43,100
The cylinder at my home exploded.

910
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:47,310
shiva. Come with me. Hurry up.

911
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,040
What are you doing, Mannu?

912
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:50,170
shiva, listen to me.

913
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,440
stop freaking out and behaving
like a psycho. - Listen to me!

914
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,050
Call him right now.
- But why?

915
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,180
Just because you saw
something on television...

916
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,310
shiva.
- What the...

917
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:57,650
It's a matter of life and death.
- Okay.

918
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,950
I am calling.

919
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:01,150
Call home, and tell sheila to
get out of the house right now.

920
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:02,420
Just a minute. I'm doing it.

921
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,470
The network's busy.
- God darn it.

922
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,200
The stupid network.

923
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,410
Oh my God.

924
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:28,940
Come on, come on.

925
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,480
Relax, Mannu.

926
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,100
Hello.
- sheila! she's on the line.

927
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,300
Ask her to get out of the
house right now. - Just a minute.

928
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:48,430
Let me talk to her. sheila, it's me.

929
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:49,570
What are you doing?

930
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,900
Why? What's wrong?

931
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,640
Leave everything, and get
out of the house. Right now.

932
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,650
sheila. It got disconnected.
- Oh God, come with me.

933
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,450
Come on, fast. There's no time.

934
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:04,350
Mother, I'm leaving.
- Mannu, have something to eat.

935
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:05,510
Where are you going?

936
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,620
Where are they going?

937
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:08,320
What has happened?

938
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,120
Why is this happening with me?

939
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:12,460
Relax, everything will be fine.

940
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,070
she cannot even smell anything.

941
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,600
sheila. Are you fine?
- What's wrong?

942
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,940
stay here. I will be back.

943
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,070
Kitchen.
- Oh God!

944
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,020
I just can't believe this Mannu.
It's just so bizarre.

945
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,030
I still can't believe it,
Manu. How can this happen?

946
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,430
You were laughing at me
when I was telling you.

947
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,500
Now we both are entrapped in this.

948
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,900
What do you mean by "we"?
- I was leading a normal life...

949
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:58,640
...with my wife and child. How
can I be entrapped in this story?

950
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:00,380
If anything happens to
them, Mannu... - shiva.

951
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,040
I'm not doing all of this.

952
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,450
I don't know how this is happening.

953
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,650
I am stuck in this on my own.
I don't know what to do.

954
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:14,250
What do you mean?
Just vacate that house.

955
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,990
What are you thinking? What are
you still waiting for? Get out now.

956
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:17,630
shiva. I cannot vacate that house.

957
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:18,990
shiva. I cannot vacate that house.

958
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:20,920
Why? Why cannot you
vacate it? What do you mean?

959
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,050
shiva, listen to me.

960
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:25,460
My house is the only place
where the programme telecasts.

961
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:29,060
If we hadn't seen it
at the right time...

962
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,200
sister-in-law's life was in danger.

963
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:31,400
We couldn't have saved her.

964
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,870
If I vacate that house, I
will never get to know...

965
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,070
...what's going on in that programme.

966
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,880
And if something bad
is going to happen...

967
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,000
...I won't be able to save
my family from it, shiva.

968
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,410
And you thought I was joking.

969
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:43,610
I am entrapped in it as well, Mannu.

970
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,490
But Mannu... You are
absolutely right, Mannu.

971
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,620
Don't go out of that house at all.

972
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:54,490
And first of all, it's very important
for you to stay in that house.

973
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,890
And don't tell your
family about this...

974
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,020
...or else they will ask
you to vacate the house.

975
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,160
And Mannu, most importantly...

976
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:01,900
...please ask your family to
pay close attention...

977
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,100
...to the inspector's duties.

978
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,900
Or else, they might
just side-track it...

979
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,170
...and not pay close attention.
And the inspector...

980
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:10,970
You understand what I am...

981
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,100
Now, you understand what
I am going through.

982
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,580
Harry. What's wrong?

983
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,450
What, Harry? Is
there someone, Harry?

984
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:29,120
Hello, is anyone there?

985
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:32,320
Anyone there? Harry.

986
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,270
Careful. stop.

987
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:37,400
sir, what's wrong?

988
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,130
sir.
- Manohar.

989
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:42,340
Yes sir, just a minute.
- son.

990
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,270
Thank you.
- Are you okay?

991
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,610
Yes, but something
happened to Harry.

992
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,080
He must have spotted
a cat or something.

993
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,280
He just ran away.

994
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:58,620
sir, come here. Take a seat.
I will look for him.

995
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,420
Harry.

996
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:07,490
Harry. What are you doing there?

997
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,430
Harry, come here.

998
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,170
Harry. Come here, boy.

999
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:21,170
Good boy. Come here.

1000
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,280
Come on.

1001
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,070
Priya! Priya! What happened?
- What? Nothing.

1002
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,600
Why do you get so hyper?
- No, I thought something happened.

1003
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,070
Nothing happened.

1004
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:50,400
I don't know why, but you have
been behaving strangely these days.

1005
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,870
That's not it. I felt
like coming to the kitchen...

1006
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:57,080
...and giving you a helping hand.
- Really.

1007
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,880
Yes. Because I've
heard that if husband and...

1008
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,890
...wife work
together in the kitchen...

1009
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,580
...the intimacy
between them increases.

1010
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:06,420
You brought a cookbook earlier.

1011
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,620
And now you are
talking about psychology.

1012
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,290
Forget it. so what's
the latest with you?

1013
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:14,030
Do you still watch that
programme on T.V., "sab Khairiyat"?

1014
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,030
What happened in today's episode?

1015
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,500
You are addicted as well, right?

1016
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,840
You got hitched as well, right?

1017
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,100
And you used to mock us.

1018
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,040
Now you call from the office to
ask what happened on the show.

1019
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,110
When you come to the kitchen you
ask, "What happened on the show?"

1020
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,050
But you won't believe what
happened on the show today.

1021
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,580
Amazing. An amazing thing
happened on the show today.

1022
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,450
Why? What happened?

1023
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,450
The neighbour.
- Yes.

1024
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,060
His dog.
- Yes.

1025
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,590
He goes into the
garden and starts digging.

1026
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:48,930
Then?
- He keeps digging and digging.

1027
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,060
Then what?
- He finds something there.

1028
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,070
What? - That's what I
would like to know myself.

1029
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:01,340
But before they could
show anything, it ended.

1030
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:02,470
I am just fed up.

1031
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,180
sir, some people want an
invitation to the political meeting.

1032
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,250
You asked me to remind you.
- Yes. Go.

1033
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,150
Hello!

1034
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,520
Yes, Kalsekar. - I will call you.
I will call you later. Okay.

1035
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,460
You have reminded me. Now leave.

1036
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,260
Yes! sir.
- Get back to your work.

1037
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,140
shiva. shiva. shiva.
- Manu, you are so late.

1038
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:19,610
Where were you? You said
there's something urgent.

1039
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:22,010
Tell me what happened
in yesterday's episode.

1040
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,880
Was I transferred?
- Take a look.

1041
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,480
What is this?

1042
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,040
This is the tele-serial family.

1043
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:53,500
Where did you find this?

1044
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:57,310
shiva, this was buried in
the ground outside my house.

1045
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,610
And look, there's a
calendar in this picture.

1046
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:06,520
And the date is June 1977.

1047
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:11,600
shiva, this means this
picture is 30 years old.

1048
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:17,870
But even today these people can
be seen on the show on my T. V...

1049
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,000
...at the same age.

1050
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:23,610
How... how is this
happening, Manohar?

1051
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:26,080
What shall we do?
- shiva, I don't know.

1052
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,610
Dr. shinde.
- What?

1053
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:35,980
shiva, some days ago I saw
an interview on television.

1054
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,890
Dr. shinde was doing
extensive research...

1055
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,290
...about ghosts,
spectres and the paranormal.

1056
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:48,490
shiva, he made a lot of sense.
- Let's go now.

1057
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,090
And tell him about everything.
Come. Come.

1058
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:54,440
No, shiva. We cannot
tell him everything. - Why?

1059
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,640
Dr. shinde is also my family doctor.

1060
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:00,450
He operated on mom's
leg some years ago.

1061
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:05,320
If I tell Dr. shinde everything,
he will instantly call home.

1062
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:09,620
And tell mom everything. And
there will be a huge confusion.

1063
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:16,390
shiva. Do you have normal clothes,
other than this uniform?

1064
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,270
Dr. shinde.
- Manohar. Come in.

1065
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:26,130
How is Priya?
- she's absolutely fine.

1066
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,340
And shushma?
- Mom is fine as well.

1067
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,210
Are you feeling sick?
- It's nothing like that.

1068
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,610
I needed a small favour.
That's why I troubled you.

1069
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,880
Please come. Come. - sorry I came
without an appointment.

1070
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,080
It's alright.

1071
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,210
This is my friend, shiva.

1072
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:39,910
Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

1073
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:45,890
He's a writer. And he's
writing something about ghosts...

1074
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,480
...and paranormal activities.

1075
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,630
He was stuck on something,
and I thought about you.

1076
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,160
so, what do you want to ask?

1077
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,900
Actually Doctor, when I
was writing my story...

1078
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:01,100
...I read a story on the Internet...
- I am sorry.

1079
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:05,440
What will you have? Tea, coffee?
- Tea.

1080
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:06,980
Tea will be fine.
- Okay.

1081
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,240
I get it now.

1082
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:14,850
There's a family in Delhi.
They watch a T.V. Programme...

1083
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,290
...which is a replica of themselves.

1084
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,190
I completely get it now.

1085
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,120
Tell me one thing, shiva.

1086
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,600
Do you believe in the paranormal?

1087
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:33,410
I mean, is there a possibility
that lost souls, ghosts could exist?

1088
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:39,070
Well... One can't clearly
say that they don't exist.

1089
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:42,150
But I personally don't...
- Fair enough.

1090
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,580
Tell me one thing, which is the most
complicated machine in the world?

1091
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:49,580
There are so many of them, Doctor.

1092
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:55,900
The rocket, the satellite, the
computer... - No. It's the human body.

1093
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,630
There's nothing more
complicated than the human body.

1094
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,630
And a doctor will
know that the best.

1095
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:08,910
I mean, if we say that a
lost soul has entered...

1096
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:12,840
...something
complicated like the human body...

1097
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:15,040
...everyone will agree to it.

1098
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:20,540
But it has entered a
machine like the television.

1099
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:22,250
No one is ready to believe that.

1100
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:32,060
Forget that. Let us try to find out
why the souls would try to do that.

1101
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:38,070
shiva, the lost souls need a
medium to contact the real world.

1102
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:44,470
The wandering souls need a
medium to contact the real world.

1103
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:46,340
so, why not the television?

1104
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,880
Get one thing straight, shiva.

1105
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:55,380
Humans are not the only
ones who change. souls do too.

1106
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:59,880
Doctor, let us assume
that the ghosts and souls...

1107
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,620
...can contact us through television.

1108
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:08,300
But the question is why are
they trying to contact us?

1109
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:15,100
They have a motive. There's
a goal they want to achieve.

1110
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,100
something that's left unfinished.

1111
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:21,380
And they want to return to
this world to finish it.

1112
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,850
If anyone can achieve their goal...

1113
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,050
...their souls will find solace.

1114
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,550
And the programme
won't be telecast anymore.

1115
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:37,860
You can say, the house
where it's telecasted...

1116
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:42,390
...must be related to that place.

1117
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:45,600
shiva, listen to me.

1118
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:51,200
All the people I saw on that T.V.
show are all dead. That's clear.

1119
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,870
And like Dr. shinde is saying,
they want to say something...

1120
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,070
...through the show.

1121
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,410
And maybe that's why we
have found that album.

1122
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,280
shiva, I feel there's something in
the album that we're missing.

1123
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,180
We should check the album again.

1124
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,350
Where's the album?
- In the car.

1125
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,030
Just a minute.
- What?

1126
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,360
Just a minute.
- Turn it back.

1127
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,020
What is it?
- Hold on.

1128
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:18,040
I think we missed a photograph.

1129
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:22,440
Look. There's something below...
- Just a minute.

1130
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:27,440
Carefully.

1131
01:28:35,490 --> 01:28:39,590
shiva, do you see this man?
- What?

1132
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:44,920
Until now, I have seen everyone on
the T.V. show except for this one.

1133
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,460
Mannu.
- Yes.

1134
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:52,130
The calendar in the
photograph shows the year 1977.

1135
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:54,400
This means they were
alive until June '77.

1136
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,530
That means they must
have died after that.

1137
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:58,270
so we have to check the papers
after that month. Remember that.

1138
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:03,470
'75!'77!

1139
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,020
shiva.

1140
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,160
shiva. Check this out.

1141
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,370
The younger sister in the
television show... - Yes.

1142
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,630
she was a news reporter.

1143
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:33,110
she and her eight family
members were massacred with a hammer.

1144
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,110
The children were not spared either.

1145
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:42,320
And their address, 13B,
Chabra Village... Kailash Nagar.

1146
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,480
What's wrong, Mannu?

1147
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:46,660
shiva.
- What?

1148
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:54,200
The address of their house
and my address are the same.

1149
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:02,670
The number of their house is 13,
and I am on the 13th floor.

1150
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:09,410
That means my apartment was built
after demolishing their bungalow.

1151
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:37,370
Gayatri, bring the
vermillion and sandalwood.

1152
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,380
Let me anoint it.
- Yes.

1153
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:45,650
Why just anoint it?
Why not hold prayers? - Yes.

1154
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,150
Do you know how
expensive this television is?

1155
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,050
Let me get one thing clear.

1156
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,650
Only one person will
touch this television.

1157
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:55,450
I will show everyone how
to switch it on and off.

1158
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,120
And the children will not touch it.

1159
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:00,990
This will look nice.
- What are you doing?

1160
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:03,600
Let it be. It will look good.
- Mother...

1161
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:05,400
We don't need your
approval for everything.

1162
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:09,130
Please.
- Keep it there. - Fine.

1163
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,600
Why are you still standing there?

1164
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,610
switch it on, so we
can see something.

1165
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:20,280
Be patient,
Mother. Patience. I will.

1166
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:26,350
Mohan. Mohan. Is it done?
- Yes, brother. I finished.

1167
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,620
switch on the booster. I
will turn the antenna.

1168
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,620
Let me know when you get a signal.

1169
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,300
Can you see anything?

1170
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:42,430
Can you see anything?
- No.

1171
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,980
No, keep turning it.

1172
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:48,110
Now.
- Now.

1173
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,510
There's nothing.
- Nothing can be seen.

1174
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:53,310
Wait! Wait! I can see it.

1175
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:56,610
No, we lost it. Ask
him to turn it back.

1176
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,320
Mohan.
- Yes.

1177
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:00,120
Turn it back.
- Okay.

1178
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:03,050
I got it. Okay, very good!
- That's it.

1179
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:06,130
We've got a signal.
- Is it clear?

1180
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,660
It's clear, absolutely clear.

1181
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,070
Tightly tie the antenna over there.
- Okay, brother.

1182
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,400
What are you two doing there?
- Nothing.

1183
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,480
Go inside. The television is on.

1184
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,010
Yes, Uncle.

1185
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:28,080
Quickly hide it here.

1186
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:37,620
Their sister, Chitra. That
reads news on television.

1187
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,430
The brothers have brought a
new television to see her.

1188
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,630
Today's programme.

1189
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:46,030
At 7:30, the yoga programme,
Yogmala. At 8 o'clock...

1190
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:50,100
Wow. Mother, the
television is so clear. - Yes.

1191
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:53,310
Just a minute.
- What are you doing?

1192
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,440
Just a minute. I am cleaning it.

1193
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:57,640
Go and call Ashok.
- Yes.

1194
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,010
He would like to see
his brother as well.

1195
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,210
My sister is looking so nice.
- You move from there.

1196
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,260
Just a minute. I am going.

1197
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:11,120
Today in Rajasthan... - Look.
- Is the signal clear? - Yes.

1198
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:16,070
Ganesh, call the neighbours. They
can see your sister as well. - Fine.

1199
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,190
Call them.

1200
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:22,270
Laxmi, Gayatri. spread a mat
here for the neighbours to sit. Go.

1201
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:24,600
Carefully, Ashok. Oarefully.

1202
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,270
We have brought a gift for you.

1203
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,010
Do you know what the gift is?

1204
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,410
Careful.

1205
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,080
You will be very happy to see it.

1206
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,380
Do you know what it is?

1207
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,290
Look, we have arrived.
- News.

1208
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,550
Look, brother. The television.

1209
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:43,890
Ashok.

1210
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,170
son, get up. Ashok.

1211
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:57,100
Come, sit up. sit up.

1212
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:58,640
son, just a minute.

1213
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,120
Look, Chitra. Chitra. Look.

1214
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:12,260
Minister of Maharashtra,
Vasant Patil...

1215
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:16,590
You did recognise your sister.

1216
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,260
You wouldn't have
recognized your father so soon.

1217
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,190
What happened?

1218
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:24,460
sit. sit.

1219
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:32,340
Come in. Come in.
- Come.

1220
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,940
some people can sit on the sofa.

1221
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:37,080
And others on the floor.
- Come.

1222
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,080
What happened, brother?

1223
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:48,430
Take him in the room. Take him away.

1224
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,290
Take him in the room.

1225
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:54,290
stop it!

1226
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:04,640
He never saw outsiders before today.

1227
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:07,370
All the new faces scared him.

1228
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:39,950
Move. Move back. Why are
you crowding this place?

1229
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:45,110
Dont you have any better work to do?
What's all this? Move back.

1230
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:47,120
Who called me? - This man, sir.

1231
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:52,490
Who are you?
- Ram Charan, a High Court advocate.

1232
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:55,420
How do you know this family?
- Family friend.

1233
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,360
I was engaged at the
younger daughter, Chitra.

1234
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,490
I brought the sample for
the wedding invitation.

1235
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:05,100
When I went inside...
I was scared, sir.

1236
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:06,960
Come.

1237
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:30,190
Hey.

1238
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:35,130
Look here.

1239
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:40,600
Hey, throw down the hammer.

1240
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:44,010
Thrown it down, or else...

1241
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:45,470
Catch him.

1242
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,510
Take him away.

1243
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:54,980
Tie him up!

1244
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:58,350
Pull him!

1245
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,460
Desai.

1246
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:46,600
Desai.
- Yes, sir.

1247
01:37:55,350 --> 01:38:00,380
Yes, sir. - Call the ambulance.
Call the obituary.

1248
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,110
Call the forensics. Call everyone.

1249
01:38:02,990 --> 01:38:04,290
Inform headquarters as well.

1250
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:08,150
This is a huge massacre. There
are eight corpses here. - Yes, sir.

1251
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,040
Desai.
- Yes, sir.

1252
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,380
Did you ask around?
- Yes, sir. I did.

1253
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,580
Does anyone know anything?
- There are two people, sir.

1254
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:32,880
Call them.
- Yes, sir.

1255
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,040
Come here.
- Yes.

1256
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:37,050
What's your name?
- Noor Mohammad.

1257
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:40,520
I live in the room next door.
I am scared of these incidents...

1258
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:42,390
Answer only what I ask you.
- Yes, sir.

1259
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:45,130
When did you find out about
what happened in this house?

1260
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:48,000
Right now. - Didn't you
hear anything last night?

1261
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:50,000
No suspicious character?
- No, sir.

1262
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:53,060
No screaming nor yelling?
- No, sir. It was nothing like that.

1263
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:54,610
It's altogether a
different situation.

1264
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,610
A ghost is responsible
for this massacre. Ghost.

1265
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,610
Really? You seem to know a lot.

1266
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:04,010
I know more. The
daughter of this house. Chitra...

1267
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,580
The one that read
news on television.

1268
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,510
she was very good looking,
like a movie star.

1269
01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:10,490
He fell for her after
seeing her on television.

1270
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:14,420
Who is he? - The one that
follows him. And misbehaves as well.

1271
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,890
That day, on the day of engagement...

1272
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,020
...he came here,
barged inside the house.

1273
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:22,030
He created such a racket.
No one could do anything.

1274
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:24,630
Her brother's tried
to reason with him.

1275
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,170
But he wasn't ready to listen.
He threatened everyone.

1276
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:29,900
If they don't get their
sister married to him...

1277
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,640
...he will kill the entire family.

1278
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:33,310
Will you recognise that boy?
- Yes!

1279
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:38,310
He's not alive. He died a week ago.

1280
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,920
On the engagement day,
he created a ruckus...

1281
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:44,120
...and on the same day, he
cut his nerves. And died.

1282
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:46,650
Can I tell you one more thing, sir?
- What?

1283
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:49,920
That boy's soul has
entered the madman's body...

1284
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,120
...and he is taking revenge.

1285
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:54,060
This house is an unlucky one.

1286
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:55,330
Have you noticed
the number? Thirteen.

1287
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:58,190
It can only be ghosts.
There was just one.

1288
01:39:58,270 --> 01:39:59,470
Now, there will be eight more.

1289
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:02,130
Eight people were
massacred in this house.

1290
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:05,140
But you didn't hear or see anything.

1291
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:07,470
But you did see the ghost.
- Yes, sir.

1292
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:08,610
You think I am a fool.
- Yes, sir.

1293
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,940
Get lost.

1294
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,480
You send such fools for questioning.

1295
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:14,310
Who else is it?
- Hey, come forward.

1296
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:15,980
This man...

1297
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,490
Did you see a ghost as well?

1298
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:19,420
There are no ghosts, sir.

1299
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:22,290
That madman has done everything.

1300
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,620
They purchased a new
television yesterday.

1301
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,160
We came here to watch it as well.

1302
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:31,440
But that madman created a ruckus.
And broke everything.

1303
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:33,560
And yelled at everyone.

1304
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,160
And then we realised that he's mad.

1305
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,240
He had to be
locked in the room, sir.

1306
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,170
And because of his madness, he
has committed this massacre.

1307
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,300
Desai.
- Yes.

1308
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:44,650
Go along with him. And the people...
- Yes.

1309
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:45,940
...that came to watch T.V.

1310
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:47,350
Bring them all to the
police station. - Get that?

1311
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,150
Yes. - And bring the
advocate along as well.

1312
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:50,310
Of course, sir.
- And listen.

1313
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:51,520
And the girl that died. Chitra.

1314
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:52,920
Find the person that
stopped her engagement...

1315
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:54,520
...and committed suicide.
- Yes, sir.

1316
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,530
I want all these details
on my table by morning.

1317
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:29,620
He was arrested. But the lawyer that
defended his case was Ram Charan.

1318
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,630
Do you know who Ram Charan is?
- Who?

1319
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,630
Chitra's fiance.
Chitra and he were engaged.

1320
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,320
Chitra. Chitra.

1321
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:53,240
What are you doing?
- Chitra.

1322
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:55,620
Who are you? Who are you?
- Chitra. Chitra.

1323
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,510
Don't call our Chitra.
she's getting engaged.

1324
01:41:57,590 --> 01:42:00,530
stop this engagement,
please stop this engagement.

1325
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:02,190
Who are you? What do you
mean stop the engagement?

1326
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:03,320
Chitra. Chitra.
- Who is this man?

1327
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,520
Chitra. Chitra.
- Quiet.

1328
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:07,660
I love Chitra. I love Chitra.
- Quiet.

1329
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,660
I see her on television everyday.
- Quiet.

1330
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,340
I see her on television.

1331
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,400
Thousands of people
watch our sister everyday.

1332
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,600
so, will everyone
get married to her?

1333
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,470
I will take good care of her.
I will take good care of her.

1334
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,870
Get lost from here!

1335
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,210
Chitra. Chitra.
- Get out.

1336
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,110
I have been trying to talk to you.
But you don't seem to understand.

1337
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:30,020
I will kill you. I will
kill the entire family.

1338
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:33,080
Get lost.
- Where did he come from? Chitra.

1339
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:38,090
That boy committed suicide.
Because he couldn't marry Chitra.

1340
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:43,290
Oh God, this is
getting darn confusing, Manu.

1341
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,490
I cannot understand anything.

1342
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:53,570
Manu.
- Yes.

1343
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:56,380
Manu.
- Yes, tell me.

1344
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:02,320
Remember that day when I came home?
- Yes.

1345
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,650
An inspector came
home that day. Remember?

1346
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:06,650
Yes, the cylinder blast episode.

1347
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:08,250
Do you know what his name was?

1348
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,250
What?
- Eeshwar Ghandre.

1349
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:13,060
What?
- Look at this.

1350
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,940
He was the office
investigating That case.

1351
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,470
And strangely, he committed
suicide in that very house.

1352
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:30,610
He hung himself to death.

1353
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,010
strange.

1354
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:43,420
There's only one person that
seems to be alive in all of this.

1355
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,230
And that's lawyer Ram Charan.

1356
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:49,890
If we meet him and question him,
we can find some information.

1357
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:51,500
You are right. You are right, Manu.

1358
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,350
What's this nonsense? switch it off.

1359
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:12,590
What happened, again? - This
remote. - It had to stop working now.

1360
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:14,580
Mummy, I can't change it.

1361
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,460
I cannot watch this.
I can't bear it.

1362
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,460
I hate this violence.

1363
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,060
sister in law.

1364
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:26,460
He's called me in the office.
- Okay, sir. - You all leave there...

1365
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:28,470
...I have to meet the judge
regarding recess. - Yes, sir.

1366
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:31,410
sir, excuse me.
Advocate Ram Charan. - Yes.

1367
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,400
My name is Manoharan.
- shiva.

1368
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:35,940
sub-inspector shiva. I
talked to you on the phone.

1369
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:37,620
Tell me, what can I do for you?

1370
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,310
sir, we wanted to talk to
you privately...

1371
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:42,580
...about this newspaper article.

1372
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,890
Tell me, what do you want to know?

1373
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:58,570
Why Ashok did such a thing?

1374
01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:02,560
Not allowing him to watch T.V.
Can't be a justification.

1375
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:04,580
Ashok cannot commit murder.

1376
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,040
I have known that family for years.

1377
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:13,040
Ashok loved Chitra immensely.

1378
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:18,850
It was someone else.

1379
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:23,590
He committed the murder, and
left the hammer right there.

1380
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:28,530
Yes. Ashok hugged
everyone's body and was weeping.

1381
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,870
And that's why he
had bloodspots on him.

1382
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:37,410
I saw it myself. He was
angry with the television.

1383
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:42,000
I think he considered the
television responsible for it.

1384
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,870
And he took the hammer and
started breaking the television.

1385
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,580
And that's how the
hammer had his fingerprints.

1386
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:55,620
I tried my best to save
him in court. But I lost.

1387
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,560
sir, where is Ashok now?

1388
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:02,560
Yes. Advocate Ram Charan called me.

1389
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:06,630
Is Ashok here?
- Yes, he has been here for years.

1390
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:10,510
But we recently shifted
him to a different cell.

1391
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:12,570
solitary confinement.
- Why, Doctor?

1392
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:17,080
For 30 years he has
been a model patient.

1393
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:19,850
As a part of therapy, we let
the patients watch television...

1394
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:22,350
...for an hour everyday.

1395
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,190
That day, Feb 21 st...

1396
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:48,070
He became very violent
while watching television.

1397
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:54,880
God knows what he
saw on television...

1398
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,510
...but he was very disturbed.

1399
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:02,550
After that, he had
self-inflicted wounds.

1400
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,890
He would draw squares,
boxes and similar...

1401
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,430
...figures on the
wall with his blood.

1402
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,970
We couldn't control him.

1403
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:15,030
That's why, you know...
- Doctor, can we meet Ashok?

1404
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:29,850
Ashok. Ashok.

1405
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:20,300
Leave it. Let go of my hand.

1406
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:23,370
Leave it.

1407
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:26,900
Move back, Manu.

1408
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:36,550
Are you fine?
- No.

1409
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:43,990
It's Priya. Yes, Priya.

1410
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:46,060
Where are you? When
are you coming home?

1411
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:48,860
I will be there
within 10 to 20 minutes.

1412
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:50,330
Ask her what
happened in today's episode.

1413
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:51,870
Priya, just a minute.

1414
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:55,870
What happened in today's episode?

1415
01:48:57,210 --> 01:49:00,140
I told you, and you were mocking me.

1416
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:02,410
And now you're
inquiring about the episode.

1417
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:03,910
Put it on speakerphone. - Yes.

1418
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:05,920
I just called to tell you that
I've laid the food on the table...

1419
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,320
Priya, leave all of that aside.

1420
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:10,610
Just tell me what
happened in today's episode.

1421
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:14,890
It was such a gruesome scene,
we couldn't see it.

1422
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,460
What happened?

1423
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:25,560
A man entered the house with a
big hammer and killed everyone.

1424
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,300
Priya.
- Yes.

1425
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:36,450
Did they show who the killer was?
- No.

1426
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:39,040
Like everyday, it ended abruptly.

1427
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:42,350
That means we will only find
out tomorrow who's behind it.

1428
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,320
Today is Friday. They
will show it on Monday.

1429
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:47,120
Priya, listen to me.
Listen carefully. - What is it?

1430
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:50,980
Is brother at home?
- I think so.

1431
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:56,930
Priya, lock all the doors and
windows of the house. - Why?

1432
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,940
No matter what happens, whoever
it is, no matter what he says...

1433
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,670
...don't open the doors and windows.

1434
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:03,140
But what's wrong?
- Listen to me.

1435
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,470
When I come home, I
will ring the bell thrice.

1436
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:07,940
Open the door only then.

1437
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:10,910
You are trying to scare me, right?
- Please don't argue with me.

1438
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,380
Just do as I say, Priya. Please.

1439
01:50:19,890 --> 01:50:23,890
shiva. shiva, someone's
going to come to my home...

1440
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,230
...and murder everyone.

1441
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,890
You go home. I will go
to the police station...

1442
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:29,030
...and come back with the force.

1443
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:30,160
We will surround
the entire building.

1444
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,430
I will station one
man at every floor.

1445
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:33,360
Let's see who it is.

1446
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:57,920
Hello.

1447
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:15,340
Who is it?
- Watchman.

1448
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,210
Who is it?

1449
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:24,210
stop. Hello, wait. stop.

1450
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:28,080
Who are you? stop.

1451
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:29,390
stop right there.

1452
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:34,100
stop. Watchman.

1453
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,040
Hey.

1454
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:02,120
Watchman, come quickly.

1455
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:10,260
What's happening?

1456
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:15,940
Hey!

1457
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:35,420
No Priya, don't open the door

1458
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,220
Priya, don't open the door.

1459
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:50,970
Manohar, what happened?
- Nothing.

1460
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:55,440
Was it a bad dream?
- Nothing, go back to sleep.

1461
01:52:57,550 --> 01:53:00,110
Tell me, Mannu, tell me.

1462
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:03,550
Priya...
- seems like you saw a ghost.

1463
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:10,520
Mannu. Mannu, what's wrong?

1464
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:14,000
It's me, Priya. Why
are you so scared?

1465
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,460
Oh God, was it a bad dream?

1466
01:53:34,590 --> 01:53:38,610
"Everything is alright."

1467
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:45,020
"There's happiness all around.
Everything is alright."

1468
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:48,030
"Friends, Everything
is alright here."

1469
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:57,570
"Everything is alright."

1470
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:01,500
Come on. Come on.

1471
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:04,240
Come on. Who is it?

1472
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,910
Come on. show me.

1473
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,140
show me.

1474
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:25,590
Manohar, I can't
understand anything you are saying.

1475
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:27,590
My family can be in
danger because of me.

1476
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:30,860
What danger? - I know my
family can be in danger...

1477
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:32,870
...because of my mental state.

1478
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:35,600
I am going to
murder my entire family.

1479
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:37,540
Do you get that?
- What are you saying?

1480
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:39,540
How do I explain it to you?

1481
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:43,610
I see bad dreams. Not just in
the night, but during days as well.

1482
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,310
I don't know what's
true and what's not.

1483
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:47,510
Whom should I believe,
and whom should I not?

1484
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:50,420
I... Doctor, there are
only two ways to avert this.

1485
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:54,290
Firstly, lock me up in a
place from where I cannot escape.

1486
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:57,420
Or else, the other
option is that you kill me.

1487
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,620
What nonsense?
- No, look. I am being practical.

1488
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:01,230
Listen to me. I am
not being emotional.

1489
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:04,630
And if anything happens to my family
because of me, I will die as it is.

1490
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:07,430
And Doctor, before I do anything,
just kill me. Just kill me.

1491
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:10,370
This is nonsense. Calm down.

1492
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:11,910
No, you calm down. shiva,
try to explain it to him.

1493
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:15,110
Mannu, relax. - Just a second,
calm down. Calm down.

1494
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:17,080
I will talk to him. - Okay.

1495
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:18,970
Doctor, I have an idea.
- What?

1496
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:21,280
Let's send his family far
away without telling him.

1497
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:23,340
Then he wouldn't be able to do
anything, even if he wants to.

1498
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:25,120
Because he just won't
know where they are.

1499
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,860
shiva.
- What are you thinking about?

1500
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:32,330
shiva, hold that thought.

1501
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:33,860
It's a really good idea.
It's a really good idea.

1502
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:35,520
Okay. - Listen to me.

1503
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:41,200
...and don't tell me about it?

1504
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,940
But at this time, how will I
get all the plane tickets?

1505
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:47,070
Doctor, on the Internet. Do you
have Internet connection? - Yes.

1506
01:56:47,150 --> 01:56:49,080
I'll do it.
- He's right.

1507
01:56:49,150 --> 01:56:51,310
Look, log onto the Internet,
book the tickets.

1508
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,880
And take my family.
No, go to my home...

1509
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:57,480
...and take them to a place
where I can't find them.

1510
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:59,890
I shouldn't know where
they are and so shouldn't he.

1511
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:03,290
And one more thing. Tell
Priya and my entire family...

1512
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,120
Mannu, catch your breath.

1513
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:09,960
I am really sorry.
- Relax Manu, cool down.

1514
01:57:10,570 --> 01:57:12,900
Ask Priya to call me. I will
explain everything to her.

1515
01:57:12,970 --> 01:57:14,340
But Doctor, we don't have the time.

1516
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:16,970
We have to move. We
have to act right now.

1517
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,240
Let's go now. Please, please.
- Okay, lets go.

1518
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:26,450
Look shiva, take me to that room
and close all the doors and windows.

1519
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:28,550
No matter what I do, or say.

1520
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:30,980
Though I might be dying,
don't open the door.

1521
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:33,580
Get that?
- Relax, Manu.

1522
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,940
Here. Keep the house keys.
And carefully. Bye. - Bye.

1523
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,310
shiva, open the door,
open it please.

1524
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,910
shiva.
- What's wrong, Manu?

1525
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:41,110
shiva, open the door. I
have understood everything.

1526
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:42,210
What did you understand?

1527
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,910
The television programme that...

1528
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:45,050
...I saw today had two hammers.

1529
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:46,180
Different ones.

1530
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:47,320
What are you saying, Manu?

1531
01:59:47,390 --> 01:59:49,990
There were two different
people on the show today, shiva.

1532
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:52,460
Manu, I don't understand anything.
Go back to sleep.

1533
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:54,060
Open the door. I
will explain it to you.

1534
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:55,190
Open the door, please.

1535
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:59,930
Manu, I won't open the door
before morning. Go back to sleep.

1536
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:03,670
Fine, don't open the door.
Just listen to me carefully.

1537
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:08,670
In the climax that I saw today
there were two different hammers.

1538
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,210
This means there were
two different people!

1539
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:16,940
The one that killed the
entire family has a normal hammer.

1540
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:19,420
You know, the one that's used
for pulling out nails as well.

1541
02:00:19,890 --> 02:00:22,620
And the other one was mine. I
was carrying the bigger hammer.

1542
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:23,950
And there was a red
tape on the handle.

1543
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:25,090
Like a sledge hammer.

1544
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:27,630
shiva, that hammer is right here.
It was in front of me outside.

1545
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:29,490
shiva, that could
mean only one thing.

1546
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:31,890
someone's going to go to my house...

1547
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:34,030
...and my family is in danger.

1548
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:35,570
In the television show
I reached home late.

1549
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:37,630
That's why he killed my family.

1550
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:41,040
If I want to save my family,
then I will have to reach on time.

1551
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:44,240
Please shiva, open the door.
I beg of you, open the door.

1552
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:49,150
shiva, for God sakes open the door.
Open the door, shiva. - Okay.

1553
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,510
Okay, Mannu.
- Please, hurry up. Please.

1554
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:58,050
Thank God. I don't have time.

1555
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:00,120
shiva, open the door.
What are you doing?

1556
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:07,400
No Manu, no. I won't
open the door, Manu.

1557
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:09,130
shiva. - I will open the
door only in the morning.

1558
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:12,470
If I have to kill you to save your
family, then I will do that as well.

1559
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:13,600
You get that straight.

1560
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:15,350
so just shut up and sleep, Manu.

1561
02:01:15,450 --> 02:01:18,080
shiva, open the door. Please
listen to me, and open the door.

1562
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:19,210
Man.
- Manu.

1563
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:21,880
Let me go. Open the door, shiva.

1564
02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:45,100
Manu!
- Oh, god damn it!

1565
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:47,910
shiva, please open
the door. Let me go.

1566
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:49,110
Please, let me go.
- Manu.

1567
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:52,910
You fool.
- shiva! - You idiot.

1568
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:29,180
Manu. Manu. Manu.

1569
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:43,360
Manu!

1570
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,370
Where is he?

1571
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:11,460
What's wrong with him these days?

1572
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:12,920
Manu.

1573
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:23,470
Hi, Priya.
- Uncle, it's so late in the night.

1574
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:27,330
Manu is not at home.
- I know he's at my house.

1575
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:30,310
Are you fine.?
- He has asked me to give you this.

1576
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:34,880
I don't understand. What is this?

1577
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:37,080
Priya, these are air-tickets.

1578
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,420
All of you have to leave for Delhi
by the morning 7 o'clock flight.

1579
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:46,290
What? But why?
- Don't worry.

1580
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:48,630
Call Manohar. He will
tell you everything.

1581
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:56,100
Fine. Uncle, come in. Please.

1582
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:08,020
I am tired of climbing up
13 floors. - I am so sorry.

1583
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:11,180
It's a power cut. Oan
I get you some water?

1584
02:04:11,590 --> 02:04:15,860
Yes, and get me a black coffee
without sugar. - sure, take a seat.

1585
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:16,990
I'll get it.

1586
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:52,160
Priya, where's the bathroom?
- In front of you.

1587
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:55,420
I will bring the candle.
It's -okay. I will find it.

1588
02:05:14,350 --> 02:05:15,550
The electricity has come.

1589
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:43,010
The main headlines.

1590
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:48,880
Thirty years ago, television news
reporter, Chitra, and her family...

1591
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:55,620
...which also included children,
were massacred with a hammer.

1592
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:00,350
The police have taken
Chitra's elder brother into custody.

1593
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:02,020
And he's a mental patient.

1594
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:05,430
He has been accused of
committing all the murders.

1595
02:06:08,110 --> 02:06:10,900
A madman has committed this murder.

1596
02:06:11,110 --> 02:06:14,170
But it wasn't my brother.
It was you!

1597
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:19,180
Your foolish brother
didn't value his life.

1598
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:20,550
That's why he committed suicide.

1599
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:24,590
Just because a girl
refused to marry him...

1600
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:27,520
But how are we responsible for it?

1601
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:31,860
If you loved your brother so much,
and you were so sad about his death...

1602
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:35,330
...you should have
committed suicide yourself.

1603
02:06:39,870 --> 02:06:42,860
sairam. sairam.

1604
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:50,610
What did you do?

1605
02:06:56,890 --> 02:07:00,150
Chitra! - Hey, why are you
barging in? - Throw him out!

1606
02:07:04,630 --> 02:07:06,560
...doesn't have a right to live.

1607
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:14,830
Find out who the boy
was that came here...

1608
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:17,030
...and created an uproar.
- Yes, sir.

1609
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:20,500
Doctor, I am sorry to hear
about your brother's death.

1610
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:23,270
I'll be with you in a minute.
- Okay.

1611
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:35,940
Why did you kill us?

1612
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:39,850
If you would have been
punished for your deeds...

1613
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:42,050
...it might have calmed our fury.

1614
02:08:42,860 --> 02:08:47,860
But you accused my
brother of everything...

1615
02:08:47,930 --> 02:08:49,590
...who could never commit a sin.

1616
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:52,400
You proved him to be a murderer.

1617
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:56,400
And left him to rot
in the mental asylum.

1618
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:58,610
That was wrong.

1619
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,940
Better yet, you should
have killed him along with us.

1620
02:09:02,180 --> 02:09:04,510
But you have punished him the worst.

1621
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:07,180
And that's wrong. It's a crime.

1622
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:12,360
We could have killed
you if we wanted to.

1623
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:18,620
But no. We want my brother to
be acquitted of all accusations.

1624
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:21,160
He should be set free.

1625
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:27,430
And that's why we will kill
you right where you massacred us.

1626
02:09:28,510 --> 02:09:32,030
Today, our rage will
finally be at peace.

1627
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:34,570
And our souls will find solace.

1628
02:09:35,450 --> 02:09:40,210
You will be punished for your sins.
- Punished.

1629
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:43,220
How else can you punish me?

1630
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,050
How else can you punish me?

1631
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:48,650
I lived without my
brother for 30 years.

1632
02:09:49,190 --> 02:09:50,590
How else can you punish me?

1633
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:52,260
What was my brother's fault?

1634
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:54,590
Tell me, what was
wrong with my brother?

1635
02:09:55,470 --> 02:09:59,130
I brought him up with
much love and adoration.

1636
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:01,660
I am proud of my brother.

1637
02:10:02,070 --> 02:10:04,670
My brother died because of you.

1638
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:08,070
I won't spare any of you.

1639
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:09,340
I will.

1640
02:10:14,190 --> 02:10:21,460
I will kill you. I will
kill you. I will kill you.

1641
02:10:21,530 --> 02:10:23,020
Uncle. Uncle.

1642
02:10:41,350 --> 02:10:42,970
Brother.
- What is that noise?

1643
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:45,640
Brother.
- What's going on? - Brother...

1644
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:48,920
Priya
- why are you shouting?

1645
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:54,050
Why did Priya shout?
- Look, here.

1646
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:03,260
Priya...
- What's going on?

1647
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:05,060
What happened?

1648
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:06,190
Who is he?

1649
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:12,200
Divya, take the
children inside. Quickly.

1650
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:17,610
Doctor.
- What are you doing?

1651
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:19,210
Doctor, what's wrong?

1652
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:36,960
Doctor, what's wrong with you? stop.

1653
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:39,370
Doctor, listen to me.
Throw down the hammer.

1654
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:40,560
Carefully, brother.

1655
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:46,040
Please try to understand.

1656
02:11:46,110 --> 02:11:48,910
Listen to my doctor.

1657
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:50,040
Doctor!

1658
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,350
No! Doctor!

1659
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:00,920
Doctor!

1660
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:07,120
Don't do it.

1661
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:08,590
No!

1662
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:20,600
stop it. Manohar, just stop it.

1663
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,040
smile! smile! smile!

1664
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:48,030
Thank you.

1665
02:12:48,110 --> 02:12:49,570
Come on, I am getting late.

1666
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:50,900
Time to go to the office.

1667
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:54,040
Mother.
- The prayer is complete.

1668
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:00,950
I asked him to make a prayer room.
Instead, he made a temple.

1669
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:02,340
Here.

1670
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:05,390
Hello, baby. Looking nice.

1671
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:07,650
Listen. Remember you have
to go to the doctor today.

1672
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:09,520
You have told me 100
times, I remember.

1673
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:11,390
so what? Is it an easy thing?

1674
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:21,600
Brother, how are you?

1675
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:27,610
I'll keep this right here.

1676
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:31,210

1678
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:44,090
He was saying that all
the papers are clear.

1679
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:47,620
That means all the
problems are solved.

1680
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:50,090
Thanks to you. No, I really mean it.

1681
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:51,630
Then say something else.

1682
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:54,030
Like let's meet in the
evening, have a beer.

1683
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:55,430
Fine. Don't get too excited.
