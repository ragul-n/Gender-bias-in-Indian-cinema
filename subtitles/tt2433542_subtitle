1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,504
The characters and scenes
in this movie are not...

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,270
...meant to demean ancient
writings of any religion...

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,972
...and are purely fictional.

4
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,401
Oh dear! Please don't push me.

5
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,342
Looks like you've
completed nine months.

6
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,970
No, l'm jjust in my eighth month.

7
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,571
There's still one month left.

8
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,843
l didn't ask your delivery date.

9
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,280
l meant, is it necessary
to stand in this queue with...

10
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,617
...so many people pushing
you to watch this movie?

11
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,481
Please put some sense into her
She doesn't listen to me.

12
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,990
She put herfoot down
and brought me to this movie.

13
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,250
l need to put some
sense into you first.

14
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,419
lnstead of making
her stand in the queue...

15
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,292
...why don't you go
and get the tickets?

16
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,365
lt's easy for you to say that
just look there.

17
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,657
l will be dead if l go there.

18
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,868
She will lose her husband
but you'll be fine.

19
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:10,867
Lord ama!

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,531
Oh no! lt's so unpleasant
to hearyou. Speak softly.

21
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,506
Hey, l'm Lord ama!

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,341
Chandram master! ou?

23
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,514
No, l'm ayaprada. l felt
like watching a movie with you.

24
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,648
So, l discarded the sari
and came in a shirt and trousers.

25
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,317
Watch the movie, not me.

26
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,648
l have a small doubt.

27
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:29,514
What is that?

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,489
Do you follow equality
before law here?

29
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,926
Listen, l'm in pain.

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,428
es, when you watch
NTR's movie...

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,690
...your hands are bound
to pain with all the clapping.

32
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,129
Not that pain.

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,331
These pains? lt is jjust
your eighth month, isn't it?

34
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:46,970
Oh dear!

35
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,597
Somebody please help.

36
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,504
Come, tie a screen.

37
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,769
Oh God!

38
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,877
No, not my dhoti.

39
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,309
He has nothing inside.

40
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,572
What's the use of having it anyway?

41
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,047
l will never become pregnant
Shut your mouth and go out.

42
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,912
Please be careful.

43
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,779
Okay.

44
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,583
Chandram, don't worry
Nothing will happen.

45
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,057
She is in labor inside
How can nothing happen?

46
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,022
Who are you?

47
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,323
l'm Subramaniam, your neighbor.

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,730
ABODE OF WlND

49
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,567
Listen, you have a baby boy.

50
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,800
l knew it when you pulled
that man's dhoti...

51
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,242
...l knew it was a sign
for a baby boy.

52
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,340
Why is he so quiet?

53
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,382
He came here before
his time, didn't he?

54
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,849
So, he might be
wondering where he is.

55
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,317
just a minute.
l'll show you.

56
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,446
This will be your
plight all your life.

57
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,285
ABODE OF WATER

58
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,557
ABODE OF FlRE

59
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,897
ABODE OF lNDRA

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,560
What is this chaos?
What is happening here?

61
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,000
Kubera! Why do we
have a natural disaster?

62
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,796
Are the Gods of Wind,
Fire and Rain...

63
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,431
...fighting among
themselves for Rambha?

64
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,906
l don't know, Lord.

65
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,010
God of Wind, why are you upset?

66
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,910
l'm not upset
l was driven here by the wind.

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,652
What is happening here, Lord?

68
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,311
Even though we are sitting
at home with no work...

69
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,921
...our own powers
are turning against us.

70
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,080
l don't know what's wrong.

71
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,251
lf l stand up, l might
be thrown into another world.

72
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,791
One thing is clear.

73
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,159
Adisaster has been created
that will ruin us very soon.

74
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,198
Since our own powers
are turning against us...

75
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,167
...l think Lord Brahma gave
our duties to someone else.

76
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,737
There's no doubt about it
Only he can do that.

77
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,007
Let's go and ask him.

78
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,547
Lord Brahma,
how can you be so indifferent...

79
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,281
...when we are faced
with such danger?

80
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,750
He did what he wanted
to and got the desired results.

81
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,760
Now even thorns will be
like a bed of roses for him.

82
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,056
God of Wind! Why are
you hurling accusations at me?

83
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,097
Accusations?

84
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,600
you should've told us,
if you had anything against us.

85
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,566
lnstead, you gave our
powers to somebody else.

86
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,676
We should know
where we went wrong.

87
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,935
God of Rain! Shut yourtaps.

88
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,182
our sins are not
responsible forthis chaos.

89
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,375
There was a small mistake
in my administration.

90
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,951
Narayana!
Greetings to the father!

91
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,714
Father! What are
we facing this distress?

92
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,723
l'll break your teeth,
if you make me angry.

93
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,860
lnstead of using your
spare time for good work...

94
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,759
...you caused all this trouble
with your useless talking.

95
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,599
just look at the confusion
in all the worlds.

96
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,099
What did l do, father?

97
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,694
you didn't do anything, son
you made me do it.

98
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:41,677
Narayana! My greetings
to father and mother.

99
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,582
Father looks busy with
some mindboggling matters...

100
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,777
...concerning the administration
of his duties.

101
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,010
es, son.

102
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,018
l'm writing the destinies
of Telugu movie poets...

103
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,423
...and their works that
need to be sent to the earth.

104
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,228
We need to send them
for their deliveries.

105
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,564
l have a small doubt
Will you clear it for me?

106
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,965
No, son. l don't want
to rattle my brains after that.

107
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,330
l know you very well
Let me do my work. you may go.

108
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,338
My doubt is about your work, father.

109
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,474
What do you mean?

110
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,234
ou've created many
great poets like...

111
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:18,215
...Acharya Athreya
Veturi and Sinare with your pen...

112
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,287
...and caused them
to write amazing songs...

113
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,889
...and entertain millions of people.

114
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,715
Even though your
pen is so talented...

115
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,920
...why did you never
pen a song for your wife?

116
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,260
lf you write jjust
one song for my mother...

117
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,460
...l'll see the happiness
in her eyes.

118
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,332
you can come to see
that when l'm free.

119
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,198
l'm not without any work like you
you may leave.

120
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,171
Listen to me, Sarasu.

121
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,646
Sarasu...

122
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,850
our happiness is
going to cost me a lot.

123
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,659
Sarasu, your mouth looks
sweet when you are angry.

124
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,490
l've nothing left but
an angry mouth and runny nose.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,796
Sarasu, will you be happy,
if l sing a song foryou?

126
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,379
Will you rob my heart...?

127
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,880
Will you rob my heart, my dear lady!

128
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:35,792
l'll keep you safe in my eyes, my dear lord!

129
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:51,273
The flower hit him and
he was born without a destiny.

130
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,672
He is immortal if he is
born without a destiny, right?

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,508
es, and he has powers equal to us.

132
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,111
Whatever he wishes with his
heart will definitely come true.

133
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,718
Then we'll be ruined
lf this is the case when he is born...

134
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,313
...what will happen
when he finds out he has powers?

135
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,322
Narada! Give me
those wooden pieces.

136
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,190
For what?

137
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,226
To sing hymns.

138
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,159
Was that ajoke?

139
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,131
This is what happens,
when you forget your duties...

140
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,360
...and get busy romancing your wife.

141
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,661
Look at him, Narada.

142
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,071
Earlier, lndra used
to be afraid to look at me.

143
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,635
But now he is poking fun at me.

144
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,633
you caused this. you will...

145
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,903
Calm down, father.

146
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,736
Since l created the problem
l'll give you the solution.

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,744
What is that?

148
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,942
you create humans
But who takes away their life?

149
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,487
Lord ama!
He will help us correct this problem.

150
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,716
God of Wind! Bring Lord ama
to me immediately.

151
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:39,889
Okay

152
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,821
God of Wind! Are you deaf?

153
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,759
you were asked to bring
Lord ama not Chitragupta.

154
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,494
Lord ama refused to come.

155
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,831
He sent a message with me
that he won't come.

156
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,133
He refused to come?

157
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,639
That's what l said
you will have to...

158
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,540
Chitragupta!

159
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,809
He asked you to resolve
your own problems. Bye!

160
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,812
Calm down, father.

161
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,283
l know very well howto
bring Lord ama to our feet.

162
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,460
Nowthis problem belongs
to Lord ama, not us.

163
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,995
That premature baby will
be Lord ama's nightmare.

164
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,871
YAMA lNCARNATE

165
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,243
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning.

166
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:37,973
Naresh!

167
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,050
es, ma'am.

168
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:41,949
you are a teacher's son.

169
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,316
Aren't you ashamed
to get a zero in your test?

170
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,219
No, you didn't give me marks.

171
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,417
l wrote correct answers
to all the questions.

172
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,356
What is that correct answer?

173
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,291
That l don't know.

174
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,258
ou!

175
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,294
Why are you screaming?

176
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,660
ou'll understand the pain
if someone does that to you.

177
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,208
Mine will go farthest.

178
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,306
Mine will go even farther.

179
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,386
Mine will go way ahead! Look!

180
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,715
lt's drizzling it might
start raining heavily.

181
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,620
es, when skin touches
skin in the rains...

182
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,025
...your desire for love,
becomes even more, come.

183
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,190
Naresh...

184
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,259
Why are you crying?
Can't you pee like me?

185
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,429
No, Bet Raja took away
all my money.

186
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,631
Really? Come with me.

187
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,870
Why is it not raining?

188
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,070
Why does rain water taste
like salt water? ls it...

189
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,679
Gross! l said we'll go to a movie.

190
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,874
But you brought me
to into these bushes.

191
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,686
Bet Raja, bet!
Two for one, fourfor two!

192
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,358
ou'll lose a single or
win a double! Bet Raja, bet!

193
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,287
One rupee on Sridevi.

194
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,224
One rupee on Sridevi!

195
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,025
Sridevi won! Bet Raja, bet!

196
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,198
Again Sridevi! 6 for 3!

197
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,200
Keep them right there.

198
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,864
Bet Raja, bet!
Two for one, fourfor two!

199
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,407
Again Sridevi!

200
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,234
Bet Raja, bet! Bet Raja, bet!

201
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,903
Again Sridevi!

202
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,445
Bet Raja, bet! Bet Raja, bet!

203
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,483
Again Sridevi!

204
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,214
Bet Raja, bet!
There's a stone in my throat!

205
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:28,453
Take all the money
Take it all away.

206
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,193
How did Sridevi
come so many times?

207
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,425
Anyone will come if l call
even Sridevi.

208
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,365
Who are you?

209
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,095
l'm Sridevi you called me
jjust now, didn't you?

210
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,194
- Did l call you?
-es.

211
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay, come again after 5-6 years.

212
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,099
-Why?
- Then l'll have a mojustache.

213
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,920
'Do you think he's
writing some lAS exams?'

214
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,320
'Not at all lntermediate, Batch No. 2002.'

215
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,799
'Now 2012.
Headache of the home.'

216
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,797
'Talk of the whole town
He's Mr. Naresh.'

217
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,971
Did our son pass the exams?
l'll make pudding.

218
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,014
Forget pudding
give him some poison.

219
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,251
Pathetic!

220
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,951
Did he fail again, uncle?

221
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,278
There's no chance of me failing.

222
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,320
l wrote well. Maybe it's a mistake.

223
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,220
Dad, see the numbers
before and after my number.

224
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,326
Why? Did you copy
from their papers?

225
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,655
No, they copied
from my paper.

226
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,161
Even they have failed.

227
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,594
Thank God!
Even they have failed, right?

228
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,133
you fool! you should
have completed it in 2 years.

229
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,565
But instead you've
settled down there.

230
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,604
All your classmates went
ahead and got good jobs.

231
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,934
Forget about them, dad.

232
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,699
l'll kill you if you try
to play yourtricks before me.

233
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,537
Give me one more.

234
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,541
Eat, my boy.

235
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,042
How can you eat when
l'm scolding you like this?

236
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,048
Mom made such delicious
breakfast that...

237
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,311
...even your scolding
is not spoiling the taste.

238
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,181
Why are you scolding
this little boy?

239
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,446
- ls he a little boy?
-es.

240
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,580
lf we had got him married
he would've given birth...

241
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,021
...to ten more useless
felloWS like himself.

242
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,116
Ten? Come on, dad
you are embarrassing me.

243
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,387
you have no shame!
When will you change?

244
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,324
oujjust roam around
with those useless people...

245
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,898
...in the name of dramas,
the whole day. Pathetic!

246
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,398
Don't worry about him
just wait and watch.

247
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,863
One day he'll definitely
make you proud.

248
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,872
He is becoming irresponsible
because of your love.

249
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,473
- Brother!
-es?

250
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,102
- l have a small doubt
- Go ahead.

251
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,738
We both are born to the same mother.

252
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,544
Then why are you black
and why am l fair?

253
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,676
l'll break your bones if
you mess with ancient writings.

254
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,378
ls that the way to apply lipstick?

255
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,522
l'm Sita, not Hanuman
Do it correctly.

256
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,792
Stop!

257
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,691
What is he doing?
ls he painting my wife's face...

258
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,321
...or, is he trying to impress her?

259
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,990
He hasn't even got his first beard.

260
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,134
ls there no limit
for your suspicions?

261
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,860
l'll be in trouble
if she crosses her limits.

262
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,032
She is not your wife
so it's easy foryou to say.

263
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,070
We can never trjust
these drama people.

264
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,303
Narayana!

265
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,246
Man, how are you
related to that woman?

266
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,040
l'm her laundry man!
She is my wife, so what?

267
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,845
l had a doubt.

268
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,390
Did she give you the rights
to doubt as well? What's up?

269
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,350
My doubt is...
is Sita really your wife?

270
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,990
Or, is she the wife of
Rama that is sitting there?

271
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,359
you are saved because
you are in Lord Krishna's getup.

272
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,526
Didn't l tell you she's my wife?

273
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,434
Don't be upset
Looking at the situation here...

274
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,872
...l thought he's her husband.

275
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,838
lf you peacefully clear my doubt
l'll be grateful to you.

276
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,014
Okay, how should
l clearyour doubt?

277
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,139
you go and ask her to come home.

278
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,183
lf she agrees, she's your wife
lf she doesn't agree...

279
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,187
l'll skin her
if she doesn't agree.

280
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,787
Let's go home.

281
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,456
Why should l come
whenever you call me?

282
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,761
l have a drama
l won't come, you go home.

283
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,528
Let's go.

284
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,494
l won't come.

285
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,630
How dare you refuse?

286
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,361
- l said l won't come
- Let's go.

287
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,663
- l won't come
- Let's go.

288
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,036
Did you see?

289
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,864
What? Sita is gone? How?.

290
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,508
es, her husband
forcefully took her home.

291
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,805
l meant, what will we
do without Sita's character?

292
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:07,977
l'm here.

293
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,104
Narayana!

294
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,646
Look at yourself in the mirror.

295
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,445
ou'll be like a devil,
if you dress up as Sita.

296
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,084
Narada's character was
not there in this episode.

297
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,053
Then who is he?

298
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,854
Why do you care?
l have many girls like...

299
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:27,193
...Rambha, Urvashi and
Menaka to do that role.

300
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,390
Now l got it.

301
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,728
Looking at your getup
l thought you were an actor.

302
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,598
But now l know you have
many kinds of businesses.

303
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,671
Narayana! l'm speaking
of actresses in my drama group.

304
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,570
l see.

305
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,475
Oh! Drama group is a facade
for your actual business.

306
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,805
Why don't you believe me?

307
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,107
Okay, call her.

308
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,648
you call her.

309
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,216
Won't she come if you call?

310
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,644
l don't want to interfere
in your business.

311
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,082
lt will be better if you call her.

312
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,520
Okay, dial the number.

313
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,921
There's no need forthat
just close your eyes...

314
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,756
...call out for amaja
sincerely and wholeheartedly...

315
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:01,424
...and she'll come to
you no matter where she is.

316
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,397
What is he saying?

317
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,195
Really? Okay, l'll try.

318
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,597
ls she really a girl?

319
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,865
Wait, let me check.

320
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,737
Who are you? ou are Laxmana.

321
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,901
you shouldn't look
at Sita in that way.

322
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,839
Can you look at her in that way?

323
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,810
l'm Rama.

324
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,544
By the way, where is that
man that brought her?

325
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:53,984
you are not an ordinary man.

326
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,118
l don't know
where you found her.

327
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,518
But the girl is really beautiful.

328
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,984
She appeared here with
costumes when l called her.

329
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,819
Did you set this up
in advance?

330
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,623
lt's my duty to start
the drama at any cost.

331
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,631
What?

332
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,528
l meant you should start it.

333
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,429
Are you starting a family
instead of starting the drama?

334
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,931
Audience! Silence! Silence! Silence!

335
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:17,872
How long?

336
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,808
'Sita's Wedding' drama
will start in a few seconds.

337
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,172
Lift the curtains first.

338
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,488
The first participant
to break the bow is Ravanasura.

339
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,421
l'll break the bow.

340
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,189
Are you drunk?

341
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,292
l would've come in
the correct way if l was drunk.

342
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,458
Hi! How are you?

343
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,233
Oh God! Save me!

344
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,606
The bow is so heavy
Someone save me.

345
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,007
This is crushing me.

346
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,204
Come, and lift it up.

347
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,082
Kiran! Why did you
make the bow so heavy?

348
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,452
Ravanasura would've
died if not for Rama.

349
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,785
Even this is heavy
l'll talk to you...

350
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,489
...when you come to
pay me this evening.

351
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:28,669
Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world...
and beloved consort of Janaki

352
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:38,947
Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world...
and beloved consort of Janaki

353
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:44,462
Welcome to you, the glorious ruler!

354
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,168
Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world...
and beloved consort of Janaki

355
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:55,229
Welcome to you, the glorious ruler!

356
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,039
Naresh! The response
to the drama was amazing.

357
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,634
Here is your money
and your wife's money.

358
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,676
l thought you had no hair
Did you lose your brain too?

359
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,645
l don't have a wife, do l?

360
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,216
The girl that played Sita's role.

361
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,417
All the viewers felt
that she was your wife.

362
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,917
They even asked for
rice grains to bless you.

363
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,580
Really? you should've
organized a feast for them.

364
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,223
you think l'll reduce
the amount if you flatter me?

365
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,758
ou'll start dressing up
like a woman if l kick you hard.

366
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,794
Give that to me.

367
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,896
Husband! l'm talking to you, husband.

368
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,894
Are you still in the character?

369
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,831
Where is that clown
that brought you?

370
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,968
l don't know how much he asked for.

371
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,731
Take these 1,000 rupees.

372
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,703
What? lt is actually 800 rupees.

373
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,400
But since yourfigure
deserves a better figure...

374
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,376
...l gave 200 rupees extra.
Have fun.

375
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,449
Husband!

376
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,447
What? you feel 1,000 rupees are less?

377
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,721
Take another 100 rupees
l can't give you anymore.

378
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,947
What do you want?

379
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,090
l want you, husband.

380
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,821
Why are you calling me that?
Am l your husband?

381
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,588
you married me here
before the five elements.

382
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,462
This is a stage, not real life.

383
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,700
Even life is a stage, isn't it?

384
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,136
Don't use stupid logics
Why are you following me?

385
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,533
Actually, l should blame
that stupid broker.

386
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,975
'l have many girls like
Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka...'

387
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,881
There's no doubt
that this is his doing.

388
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,110
He left herto me and disappeared.

389
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,353
My life will be ruined
if l don't deal with this carefully.

390
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,845
Won't you leave me?

391
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,887
Awife follows her husband, doesn't she?

392
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,193
Really?

393
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,885
Husband!

394
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,186
Husband!

395
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,698
Why is she following me
like a TV reporter?

396
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,595
Wait, husband!

397
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,034
Wait, husband!

398
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,069
Husband!

399
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,936
Wow! you run quite fast.

400
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,603
Athief that's in form, right?

401
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,409
What did you steal? Achain?

402
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,583
No, Russia.

403
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:46,782
Was that ajoke?

404
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,514
Does the great stage artist
Naresh look like a thief?

405
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,553
you look like
a thief from all angles.

406
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,455
Look, artists like me
are like that water.

407
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,527
We look like the character,
the audience imagines.

408
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,092
Let me give you an example.

409
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,492
Since you are a policeman
l look like a thief to you.

410
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,565
lf you are a doctor
l will look like a patient to you.

411
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,602
Husband!

412
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,638
Since she is my wife
l look like a husband to her.

413
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,965
- Let's go
-es.

414
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,607
Wife and husband.

415
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,141
Thank God l'm saved.

416
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,879
Let go off my hand.

417
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,379
l like this, husband.

418
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,746
l feel like my hand is in acid
Let go off me.

419
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,149
Shall we play a game now?.

420
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,016
But we played a game earlier.

421
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,113
This is another game
Close your eyes.

422
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,620
Count from 1 to 10
and open them.

423
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,757
What then?

424
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,623
l'll tell you
First close your eyes.

425
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,094
Okay.

426
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:41,139
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

427
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,499
Finally l got rid of her.

428
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,845
l need to relax immediately.

429
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,639
Cheers!

430
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,948
What? you needed a whole
night to finish a beer earlier.

431
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,485
Today you finished it in one sip
Did he bite you?

432
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,057
The girl that played
Sita's role in the drama...

433
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,716
...thinks that she is really my Sita.

434
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,661
That crazy girl is following me
calling me her husband.

435
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,023
She is driving me crazy.

436
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,663
l took a bus and fled from there.

437
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,192
Husband!

438
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,462
l'm your husband! Come!

439
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,063
How did you come here
when l left you somewhere else?

440
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,502
l followed you and got
into that strange vehicle.

441
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,136
She's got a great figure
even though she is crazy.

442
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,737
She's not a girl, she's glue.

443
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,180
That's why she's
comfortably sticking to you.

444
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,216
Shut up!

445
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,479
This is not a ladies bar
you can't be here.

446
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,215
Shakeela House,
only for gents.

447
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,847
Get out of here
ladies shouldn't be here.

448
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,186
Don't listen to him.

449
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,785
Look howthey are ogling at you.

450
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,726
l won't go anywhere leaving you.

451
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,890
l'm ready to die with my husband.

452
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,661
ou'll be in trouble,
if you remain here.

453
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,770
Still l won't go.

454
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,199
Super!

455
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,968
l'll drink this poison
and die if you don't go.

456
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,240
Don't drink the whole glass.

457
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,142
My life is useless
without my husband.

458
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,716
Hey, that bottle costs 650 rupees.

459
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,050
Oh dear!

460
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,054
Hey...

461
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:35,847
Oh noble man! You are my hubby
Whether you like or not, l am your wife

462
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:49,530
Oh noble man! You are my hubby
Whether you like or not, l am your wife

463
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:57,572
l've shed my shyness
and longing for you

464
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:03,147
Oh magician! Don't bid me farewell
after garlanding me

465
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:37,906
ln any corner and nook, wherever you hide
l'll reach you at any how, my beloved

466
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:47,925
Wherever you hide
l'll seek and join you

467
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:57,364
l won't let go whatever l wish
l won't leave you and go

468
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:01,166
l won't...

469
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:12,981
Oh noble man! You are my hubby
Whether you like or not, l am your wife

470
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:44,013
Am ljusty and lofty
Yet you avoid me

471
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:53,880
Would be a good wife
and quench your ljust

472
00:24:55,794 --> 00:25:03,360
Listen to me, my hubby
Don't ignore this hottie

473
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:07,336
Brimmed with love...

474
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:18,677
Oh noble man! You are my hubby
Whether you like or not, l am your wife

475
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:26,780
l've shed my shyness
and longing for you

476
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:32,453
Oh magician! Don't bid me farewell
after garlanding me

477
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:36,759
Husband...

478
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,400
She's taking your name
What does that mean?

479
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,334
lt means she's sleeping.

480
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,531
ou trapped her in the name of love.

481
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,538
ou caught her hand
in the name of marriage.

482
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,671
But you left her after
your work was done, right?

483
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,142
Do l look like a white paper...

484
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,908
...that you can write whatever
stories you like on me?

485
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,952
l'll tear your face
apart with one punch!

486
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,414
No one knows why crazy
people behave like this.

487
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,954
Only they know of that art.

488
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,524
lt's better if we maintain
our distance with them.

489
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,694
Let's go.

490
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,988
- Let's go
- Come on.

491
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,620
He ruined the whole plan.

492
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,863
- Hey!
-Another drink.

493
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,767
- Listen!
-es?

494
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:17,304
She's a poor girl it is winter
and this is the centre.

495
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,033
We can't leave her here.

496
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,144
l'll take her to some safe place
ou go ahead.

497
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:22,973
Okay.

498
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:26,083
Finally he likes her
Didn't you get it?

499
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,691
Husband...

500
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,933
Sir! There's a girl.

501
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,068
Madam!

502
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,607
Oh God! Why did
she come at this time?

503
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:53,876
Where is madam?

504
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,980
Not madam, sir. She's a girl.

505
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,282
Someone that is not used
to drinking left her here, sir.

506
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,650
Should we take
a peg and party, sir?

507
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,851
Well, whetheryou want
to party or participate...

508
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,989
...the boss comes first
and then comes the staff.

509
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,929
Should we call up the DGP?

510
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:17,830
For what?

511
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,231
He is boss to all of us, isn't he?

512
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,029
Did you lose your
brain because of ljust?

513
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,373
l meant your boss,
that's me.

514
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:30,037
Let's take her inside
and enjoy her beauty.

515
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,750
Husband...

516
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,888
Husband...

517
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,612
Oh my God!

518
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:14,023
Why are you hanging
in air like batman?

519
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,184
ou came at the right time, 201.

520
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,627
Take the girl inside and
enjoy yourself for 10 minutes.

521
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:20,796
We finished jjust now.

522
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,161
Thank you, sir.

523
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,937
This is the batman story
How is it?

524
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,108
We got a shockjjust
because we touched her.

525
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,801
She's not an ordinary girl, sir.

526
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:37,846
lf we don't send that devoted
wife away, we'll be dead.

527
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,482
She's really a devoted wife.

528
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,453
-We'll leave her in the temple
-es.

529
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,356
Sir, l saw her with
her husband sometime back.

530
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,790
Who is her husband?

531
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,960
ou think l'll give
you money if you come...

532
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,126
...to beg wearing police uniforms?

533
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,933
How dare you poke fun at policemen?

534
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,834
Look there and you'll
get the shock of your life.

535
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,366
Oh God!

536
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,307
Did you get a shock?

537
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,513
Did you try to get
rid of your devoted wife?

538
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,617
Are you a human?

539
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,483
l'm a human, but she is not my wife.

540
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,587
What about him?

541
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,017
No, he's not.

542
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,126
'Since she is my wife,
l look like a husband to her.'

543
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,856
Naresh, l thought
you arejjust good on stage.

544
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,935
But you try to fool
everyone around you, right?

545
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:39,401
Husband!

546
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,143
Let go off me.

547
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,271
lf you try to get rid
of your devoted wife again...

548
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,350
...l'll file a case against
you under domestic violence...

549
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,543
...l'll put you behind bars
and force you to accept her.

550
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,786
Start the car.

551
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,284
Husband, where am l now?

552
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:53,855
- On my neck.
- Huh?

553
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,952
Husband, is this our house?

554
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,025
lt is my father's house.

555
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,991
l'm entering my in-laWS
house for the first time.

556
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,725
So, l'll put my right leg first.

557
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,195
ou don't have to do any of that.

558
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,633
l'll cut your tongue
if you talk about in-laWS house.

559
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,600
Be silent.

560
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,868
l don't know what to tell my family.

561
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,398
Who is this girl?

562
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,771
Actually, you told me our maid is...

563
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,902
...quitting work tomorrow,
didn't you?

564
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,104
So, l brought a new maid.

565
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,814
But she doesn't look like a maid.

566
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,574
ls that because of her
dress and garland?

567
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,845
Earlier, she worked
for a very rich family.

568
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,148
When she quit thatjob,
they gave her new clothes...

569
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,950
...put a garland around
her neck and gave a send off.

570
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,988
Really?

571
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:32,060
l'd rather believe
a thief than believing you.

572
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,324
How can you believe me
when you don't love mother?

573
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,093
She is sad that
the maid is quitting.

574
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:41,298
How can you talk like
this instead of comforting her?

575
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,599
How can you irritate her
with questions like the CBl?

576
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,139
just to save one month's salary...

577
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,211
...are you ready to trouble
mom who has leg pain?

578
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,505
Look into her eyes and tell me dad.

579
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,238
Will you be happy
to see her in pain?

580
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,677
Stop your dialogues.

581
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,217
ou are turning the house
into a drama scene.

582
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,681
This earth is a drama scene.

583
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,422
There are no rehearsals here
Only entries and exits.

584
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,682
ou give answers that are
not connected to my questions.

585
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:01,722
And she doesn't stop crying.

586
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,828
l've had enough
ou do what you want.

587
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,387
- Listen...
-es?

588
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,656
l think your brother married
this girl in some temple.

589
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,960
He is lying to us
that she is a maid.

590
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,534
ou think my brother
did the same mistake l did?

591
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,397
Oh God!

592
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,699
Mom, please don't cry.

593
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,935
l brought a maid foryou.

594
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,477
Dear, the old maid's clothes
are inside. Get changed.

595
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:30,050
lt's already very late
We have lot of work tomorrow.

596
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,847
Go to sleep.

597
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,083
Okay, mom.

598
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,819
lt's all because of this garland.

599
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,776
Why didn't you start
doing the household chores?

600
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,104
What do you mean
by household chores?

601
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,442
ls she really a servant girl?

602
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,479
lt is new to her, mom.

603
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,714
How can household chores
be newto a servant girl?

604
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,545
This girl is
a thorough professional.

605
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,051
She studies the clothes
and washes them...

606
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,018
...without ruining their
color orthe fabric.

607
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,621
And she does all
the work with great clarity.

608
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,224
ou go inside. l'll personally
make her do all the work.

609
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,028
ou've played enough
with me and them. Let's go.

610
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,859
Where? Are we going out?

611
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,433
No, we are going to
do the dishes. Come on.

612
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,694
Now do the dishes.

613
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,825
What do you mean by that?

614
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,666
Cleaning.

615
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,796
What does that mean?

616
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,740
ou are acting as Cleopatra
to avoid doing dishes.

617
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,207
l'll show you how to do them.

618
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,173
First, tuck that sari
at your navel.

619
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,871
Navel? Where is that?

620
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,411
lt is in the living room
go and get it.

621
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,313
Wait! Do l have to
showthis as well?

622
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,423
l finished tucking the sari
now we'll do the dishes.

623
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,128
Doing the dishes
means to sit like this...

624
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,926
...scrub them like this and
rinse them in water like this.

625
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,462
- Did you get it?
-es.

626
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,762
- Now do all the dishes
- But how?

627
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,599
Darn it! l showed you
jjust now, didn't l?

628
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,670
Why do you ask again?

629
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,331
ou showed me
how to wash that one.

630
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,704
But you didn't
show me this one.

631
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,605
Give it to me.

632
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,006
Like this. Did you get it?

633
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,545
l don't know how to
wash this one.

634
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,285
- Did you get it?
-es.

635
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:14,222
Don'tjjust say yes
Do all the dishes again now.

636
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,986
Don't play yourtricks with me

637
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,102
Oh God!

638
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,933
God, l cried when l was
born like every other baby.

639
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,735
But l didn't make you
cry by wishing for big things.

640
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,144
l jjust have one simple wish.

641
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,645
Make sure that no one
interferes in my hard work.

642
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,320
Only then my devotion and
your power will be balanced.

643
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,884
Hail Lord Krishna!

644
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,522
Sir, green tea.

645
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,564
Sir, are you taking a nap?

646
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:57,793
Should l increase
the air conditioner?

647
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,798
l'm not taking a nap
l'm going into the flashback.

648
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,166
Why do we want to kill him?

649
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,838
What is the enmity
between him and us?

650
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,707
Does he actually deserve
to die in our hands?

651
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,643
Only when l rewind
all these facts in mind...

652
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,810
...l'll understand if we
need to take revenge or not.

653
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,118
Move aside!

654
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,523
Don't cry! Don't cry!

655
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,628
- Hey!
-es, sir!

656
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,491
- Come here
- Come on.

657
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,929
15,000 rupees for this family
because he is still unmarried.

658
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,098
ou incapable men!

659
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,065
This pathetic man first buys boats
insures them and...

660
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:38,131
...then destroys those
boats for the insurance money.

661
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,601
Now he has started
insuring the lives of our...

662
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,340
...sons and husbands
for more insurance money.

663
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,377
He is changing them into corpses.

664
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,347
Hey, Royyala Naidu!
May you be ruined!

665
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,615
Sir, she is cursing you.

666
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,850
We shouldn't worry about
the sins of fishermen...

667
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,552
...nor the curses of sinners.

668
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,855
What do you say, officer?

669
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,992
es, but l'll worry about them.

670
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,399
l'll expose all your sins very soon.

671
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,658
This is the officer's house, sir.

672
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,701
Very good.

673
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,634
Not the house
l meant that you balanced...

674
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,209
...my flashback time
and the traveling time...

675
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,474
...very well with your driving.

676
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,478
Who are you?

677
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,742
l'm your distant brother.

678
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,076
But l never saw you.

679
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,708
Even l thought l'll never see you.

680
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:22,877
But your husband made me see you.

681
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,851
ls that so? Please have a seat, brother.

682
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,081
ls the officer not at home?

683
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,022
He is bathing
Will you have some tea?

684
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,619
Green tea.

685
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,920
That's okay. just bring hot water,
we have the tea bags.

686
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:34,793
Okay.

687
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,298
Anu, who was at the door?

688
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,358
Sir is here.

689
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,659
Why are you here?

690
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,501
The doctor said green tea
increases your life span.

691
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,005
Sister, bring another cup
Even your husband will drink.

692
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,541
Why are you here?

693
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,745
Don't take stress.

694
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,781
Stress and screaming have,
an ill-effect on your heart.

695
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,281
Please sit, l'll tell you.

696
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,010
lt is wrong to hurt the heart, isn't it?

697
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,983
We'll sit peacefully and talk.

698
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,448
Come, dear.

699
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,754
lt's a personal matter
Please go inside.

700
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,327
We need to dip it
well and then drink it.

701
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,228
l'm like the vast sea.

702
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:17,035
ou should use me
but never play games with me.

703
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,937
l told you to enjoy life
with your wife and kids...

704
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,742
...without interfering
in my business.

705
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,444
But you said you'll
drink green tea and die.

706
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,542
What can l do?

707
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:35,123
Sister, don't let kids
touch these green tea bags.

708
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,353
l mixed poison in them.

709
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,303
'l should get rid of
her today at any cost.'

710
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,004
ami, what are you doing?

711
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,004
Husband!

712
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,334
That man in the TV is my father.

713
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,536
What? Collection King
Mohan Babu is your father?

714
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,870
Her madness is worsening every day.

715
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,973
l thought only humans
look like humans.

716
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,617
Are there humans who
like Lord ama as well?

717
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,078
This is so strange, isn't it?

718
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,323
ami, you wanted to go
out yesterday. Shall we go?

719
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,360
Go out? Are you going
to Manasa Sarovaram?

720
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,554
That's quite far. l'll have to
sell my kidneys to go there.

721
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,790
For now, we'll go to the exhibition.

722
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:15,830
What does that mean?

723
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,561
Exhibition is a place that
has a display of variety of things.

724
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:19,866
ls that so?

725
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:20,835
Mother!

726
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,135
Where are you going?

727
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,764
l need to inform mother, right?

728
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,841
No need. Mom and sister
went to the market.

729
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:26,910
They'll take time to come back.

730
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:27,841
Should l adorn myself?

731
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,006
ou don't have to adorn yourself.

732
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,681
ou already look like an angel.

733
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,486
Come! Throw a ring
and get the thing!

734
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,027
4 for 10 and 8 for 20! Come!

735
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,527
Throw a ring and get the thing!

736
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,393
Husband! l want to try that.

737
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,432
What? That man couldn't
throw even one ring.

738
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,466
How can you get it right?

739
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,033
Sirs! Madam! Please come!

740
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,035
Okay. Give me those rings.

741
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,138
Here you go, sir.

742
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,486
l don't know whose face
l saw early this morning.

743
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,684
l've incurred great losses.

744
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,953
l don't want any of these.

745
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,891
Playing is jjust fun for me
but it is your livelihood.

746
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,395
Earn some more with these things.

747
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:23,631
Let's go.

748
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,099
-ami!
-es?

749
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:26,999
Will you sit in the Giant Wheel?

750
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:27,866
What is that?

751
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,030
That big wheel.

752
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,232
Come, get in.

753
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,307
Bye!

754
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,436
Come with me, husband.

755
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,410
ou go round and round
l'll watch you from there.

756
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,673
Really? Okay.

757
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,840
- Bye.
- Okay.

758
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,094
Mom, tea!

759
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,334
Thanks, mom!

760
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:00,799
ou?

761
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:05,433
es, husband. l was so sad
that you got lost there.

762
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,204
What? l got lost?

763
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,106
es. But l prayed in my
heart that your love for me...

764
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:14,913
...will safely bring
you home and came back.

765
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,008
And that came true.

766
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,811
Keep yourjoy aside
and tell me this.

767
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,682
How did you find the address
and how did you come?

768
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,857
l jjust followed
the same route that we went.

769
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,425
Darn your memory power!
Why did you come back?

770
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,516
Responsibilities

771
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,955
l need to help mother
and sister at home.

772
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,589
When father and brother
return from...

773
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,897
...school and office
l've to serve them.

774
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,096
l need to arrange
for snacks for the kids.

775
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,673
So l came early and
finished all the work.

776
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,608
Did you learn to do
all this in a single day?

777
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,240
l cannot digest that at all.

778
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,677
- Husband...
- Stay away from me.

779
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:49,150
Are you angry that l
left you there and came home?

780
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,850
l know how to make
that anger go away.

781
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,454
Mother, something
is happening outside.

782
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,322
Please come quickly.

783
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,554
- What is it?
- Come on, l'll tell you.

784
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:59,796
See for yourself.

785
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,491
This is for you.

786
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,494
For me?

787
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,692
And this is foryou.

788
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,327
What is wrong with you?

789
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,631
That girl is lovingly
feeding the kids.

790
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,430
Why did you drag me here
as if something is wrong?

791
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,201
Mother, she was not feeding the kids.

792
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,606
She was planting kisses
on your son's cheeks.

793
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:14,902
- Naresh!
-es?

794
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,445
ls she really a servant girl?

795
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,878
- Why do you ask?
- l saw her kissing you.

796
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,444
ou are so funny.

797
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,983
How can you see clearly
without your glasses?

798
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,685
What? Am l so blind?

799
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,321
Who are you?

800
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,356
our wife.

801
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,655
l'll kill you if you say that.

802
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,953
l almost got into trouble.

803
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,993
Since sister didn't wear
her glasses, l managed it.

804
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,759
Otherwise you would've
got me into deep trouble.

805
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,428
ou can't be mad as you
talk more cleverly than me.

806
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,596
ou can't be trapping
me for my immense wealth.

807
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,469
Because my dad Chandram
doesn't have any wealth.

808
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,007
Why are you confusing
a good kid like me?

809
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,873
What is your concept?
Why did you enter my life?

810
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,012
Who are you?

811
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,950
l'm amraja
Lord ama is my father.

812
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,554
Lord ama is your father?
Where is he?

813
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,749
-amapuri
- Oh! Where is it?

814
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,052
Besides lndra's world.

815
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,024
-And where is that?
- Besides Brahma's world.

816
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,823
- ls Brahma your uncle?
- No, Shani is my uncle.

817
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,196
That's why you came
as a bad omen to me.

818
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,326
Go inside and serve your in-laWS.

819
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,198
Okay.

820
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,032
Oh God! She is totally crazy.

821
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,069
l wish l meet her crazy father.

822
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,673
Hey! l'm ama! ama!

823
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,049
What? How can that be?

824
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,810
How can this happen
to the God of Death?

825
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,024
How can this happen
to the Ruler of justice?

826
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,525
How can this happen
to the King of amapuri?

827
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,559
Why are you ranting
these questions, Lord?

828
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,527
Chitragupta, this is not ranting.

829
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:46,395
l'm burning with anger
that my daughter went to earth.

830
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,639
ou are worried that
she went to earth.

831
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,867
But did you think
about who sent her there?

832
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:52,965
Who is that?

833
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,442
None other than the man
who creates contentions. Narada.

834
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,376
Narada?

835
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,551
es. Earlier,
when Brahma requested you to...

836
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,244
...take up the case
of a baby with no destiny...

837
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,720
...you totally ignored him
Did you forget that?

838
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:06,915
es.

839
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:12,189
Narada took that case up
and created trouble for you.

840
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,988
Narada!

841
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,897
Narayana!

842
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,059
Narada! ou...

843
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,465
Such vulgar language?
He mjust've learnt it on earth.

844
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:25,005
Why are you hurling
abuses on me?

845
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,336
Why did you send my darling
daughter to the earth?

846
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,275
ou...

847
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,313
Lord, please calm down.

848
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,880
l can understand your anger.

849
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,352
But understand the reason
behind my actions.

850
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,712
lf you feel l was wrong
you can do as you wish.

851
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,689
Lord, l needed someone
to play Sita's role...

852
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,388
...to solve the problem
of that human.

853
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,662
Sita was a very beautiful woman.

854
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,401
l searched all the worlds
for someone as beautiful as her.

855
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,703
There was no one
as beautiful as your daughter.

856
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,304
He forgets the problem
when he is praised.

857
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,074
And she got that beauty from you.

858
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,641
lf l had sent someone else
instead of your beautiful girl...

859
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,342
...wouldn't that be
an insult to your beauty?

860
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:13,555
So, l sent her
Did l do anything wrong, Lord?

861
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:14,487
Narada!

862
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,616
This is not a time
to decide right and wrong.

863
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,352
l've to go immediately
and bring my daughter back.

864
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,067
l'll see you and your father
after l return. ou may go.

865
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,302
Thank you, Lord! Narayana!

866
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,065
- Chitragupta!
-es, Lord? Should l pack my suitcase?

867
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,071
Let's go.

868
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,199
Wait, father! Wait!

869
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:44,586
The troubles that are solved at ease
For, you need not go in haste

870
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:49,458
To expose my strength...
a chance has come today

871
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,930
Everybody should praise my valour with joy

872
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,603
Your trait of terror
makes everyone shiver

873
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:04,902
Yama! Believe, the son of you
has that caliber

874
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,840
Great! Son of Yama...

875
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,070
Son amaganda!

876
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,037
To you, the earth may
look like a ball to play with.

877
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,749
But the humans will turn
you into a ball if you go there.

878
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,409
Don't forget that
you arejjust a lad.

879
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,717
Father! How long will you
treat me as a kid?

880
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,015
l'm a young man now.

881
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,725
That's enough.

882
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,387
Go and play with yourfriends.

883
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,427
Darn!

884
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:26,885
- Chitragupta!
-es, Lord?

885
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,827
Why is he upset?

886
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,832
l did this so that
he doesn't see sorrow at this age.

887
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,434
Did l do anything wrong?

888
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,036
ou did everything.

889
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,498
ou did everything, father.

890
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:43,110
l've lost enough from childhood.

891
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,474
What did you lose?

892
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,906
- Happiness, father
-What?

893
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,847
l've lost the smallest
ofjoys because of you.

894
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:54,155
Have you ever asked me
what l like or don't like?

895
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,051
ou always ask my friends
about my likes and dislikes.

896
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,761
These felloWS don't
even understand my words.

897
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,629
How will they understand
your words, father?

898
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,331
Please be my friend, father.

899
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,263
l always say that, don't l?

900
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:10,372
ou are upset because
l said what you usually say.

901
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:14,608
How upset l should be
if you do what l should do?

902
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,914
l'm tasting defeat everyday
in order to give you victory.

903
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,511
Why can't l see my father?

904
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,214
Father! Father!

905
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,786
Since l still look
like a young man...

906
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,222
...maybe l always
see you jjust as a kid.

907
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,257
The fact that you spoke
so many unnecessary things...

908
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,796
...shoWS that you are
a young man now, son.

909
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,991
Go quickly and bring
your sister back.

910
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,192
l can't go, father.

911
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,331
Why?

912
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,337
Even after all this
you are still holding my weapon.

913
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,499
l'll take your leave, father.

914
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,370
Son, the earth will be new to you.

915
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,036
The humans will mislead you.

916
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,280
Take Chitragupta along with you.

917
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,211
- Chitragupta!
-es, Lord!

918
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,283
Keep my son safe.

919
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,850
l need safety when l'm with him.

920
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,919
- l can hear you
- Let's go.

921
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,319
- Chitragupta!
-es?

922
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,726
What was that bird
that went so fast?

923
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:11,330
That was an airplane, not a bird.

924
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,799
Humans travel in that thing.

925
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,496
just like your father
travels on a buffalo

926
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,440
Okay. l'll take ten of them
when we return.

927
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,601
Where will you keep them?

928
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:29,217
lf we don't get down carefully
your head will be smashed.

929
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,479
ama!

930
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,452
Here comes the earth.

931
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,262
Who are you guys?

932
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,735
Hello! l'm amaganda
He is Chitragupta.

933
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,566
ou saw!

934
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,473
Lord, we landed in the wrong place.

935
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,600
-What?
- Let's go.

936
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:57,807
She looks good.

937
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:01,476
They saw! Oh God! They saw!

938
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,948
Oh dear! She threw that at us!

939
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,715
She is screaming
that we saw something.

940
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,357
But l didn't see anything.

941
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,551
ou need to be that to see it.

942
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,491
What do you mean?

943
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,062
-Ayoung man
- l am a young man.

944
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,660
Then you would've seen it.

945
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,026
- Hey!
- Keep running!

946
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,133
Oh dear!

947
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,064
lf you are caught
you'll not remain a young man.

948
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,562
She says we saw but
she is showing the whole world.

949
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,038
She is coming behind us.

950
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,664
We'll hide behind this pillar.

951
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,470
Oh God! They saw me!

952
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,979
She's okay from behind.

953
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,014
Who are you?

954
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,250
He is amaganda
and l'm Chitragupta.

955
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,418
From ama's world.

956
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,553
lf you perform on
stage with these getups...

957
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,916
...people will applaud you.

958
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,216
But if you give
performances on the road...

959
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,518
...the same people will
chase you and beat you up.

960
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,389
She was chasing us
because we saw something.

961
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,559
What did you see?

962
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,656
Wow, you felloWS are lucky.

963
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:49,857
Why? Because we saw?.

964
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,195
No, because you weren't
caught by Silk Dada.

965
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,097
Who is that?

966
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,864
He is the husband of Silk Smitha
you sawjjust now.

967
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,003
What do they say about me
and my knife in this area?

968
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:04,941
They say your knife
is jjust a showpiece.

969
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,115
Was that ajoke?

970
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,442
No, it's a fact.

971
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:08,751
Dada! Dada!

972
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,785
ln which area is she now?.

973
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,889
After covering all the areas
she got tired and went home.

974
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,393
That's the information
we got from our sources.

975
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,832
Silk!

976
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,426
They saw my body that
l was guarding with my life.

977
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,506
l didn't even let my husband
see it properly yet.

978
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:33,842
lt's betterto die than to be alive.

979
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,707
Silk, your death won't
solve this problem.

980
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,280
l was talking about your death.

981
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,044
Till you kill them,
l won't apply oil to my hair...

982
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:46,020
...or soap to my boy
That's my promise.

983
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:51,286
Silk! l'll kill them and
apply their blood to your hair.

984
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,191
l'll cut out their hearts
and turn them into bath soaps.

985
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,525
lt's up to you where
you want to apply them.

986
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,199
ou can use this spray until then.

987
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,770
Come on, let's catch them.

988
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,429
Why did you give me
an empty can, you fool?

989
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,042
'Friday night at 7 pm...'

990
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,775
Mom, why are you both
so relaxed as if there's no work?

991
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:16,749
yes, afterthis girl
came we have no work to do.

992
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,514
At first l was apprehensive
but she finishes...

993
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,091
...all the work as quickly as
you change the channels.

994
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,891
Everybody is
so impressed with her.

995
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,478
'Naresh! Don't look at her navel.'

996
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,712
'That's a very dangerous place.'

997
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:50,080
'Didn't you see the movie
''Khushi''? Don't look.'

998
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,719
Oh God!

999
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:03,664
What is wrong with you?

1000
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,029
Nothing, mom.

1001
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,469
Holding a book and reading
a book are not the same.

1002
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,139
Don't try to fool me
with yourtricks.

1003
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:12,640
Thanks, dear.

1004
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,273
He gave me a headache
but your tea made it go away.

1005
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,106
l don't know
what you put in this tea.

1006
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,510
Milk, decoction and sugar.

1007
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:21,413
ls that so?

1008
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:25,181
Not jjust the tea
even her hands are magical.

1009
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,251
l've been suffering
from leg pain for so long.

1010
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:31,157
She applied balm
yesterday and it vanished.

1011
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,785
What? The bottle of balm?

1012
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:33,725
Shut up!

1013
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,889
Dear, hold his hands
and make him write something.

1014
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,330
At least then he'll pass
in his intermediate exams.

1015
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,925
Dad! ou made me write
my first alphabets, didn't you?

1016
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,234
ls your hand responsible
for all the exams l failed?

1017
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,572
Good neWS, dad!

1018
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,572
What is it?

1019
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,074
l thought the interview
will be very tough.

1020
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,041
- But it was a piece of cake
-Very good!

1021
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,169
Which bakery did you go to?

1022
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:50,974
Shut up! l got
the Bank Manager's post.

1023
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:51,672
- Congrats
-Wow!

1024
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:52,840
Take a sweetmeat.

1025
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,307
Mom, take one.

1026
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,376
Give the kids first.

1027
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,578
Take it, dad.

1028
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:58,654

1029
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,651
- Congrats
- Thank you.

1030
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:01,917
Take it, son.

1031
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,016
-ou too, dear
- Thank you, daddy.

1032

00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,555
lt was a good omen.
Thank you.

1034
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:13,262
yes, every work will be
a success if you see herface.

1035
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,900
Congratulations to the new officer.

1036
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:18,940
Who are you?

1037
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,939
They call me sir.

1038
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,341
Others in the town
call me Royyala Naidu.

1039
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,140
People that trjust me
call me their well-wisher.

1040
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,283
My enemies call me
a corrupt and cruel man.

1041
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,814
Please accept it.

1042
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:36,492
ou can use this bouquet
for offering condolences as well.

1043
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:41,563
l'll take your leave.
The Prawns King, Royyala Naidu.

1044
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:42,995
Let's go.

1045
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,829
Prawns King?
Who was that strange man?

1046
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:46,800
l don't know, dad.

1047
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,598
He was right about one thing.

1048
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,706
He is a corrupt and cruel man
Be careful of him.

1049
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,342
Chitragupta! l'm very hungry.

1050
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,241
ls that a stomach or a djustbin?

1051
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:59,014
ou've been constantly
eating since we came here.

1052
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,481
Are you being sarcastic with me?

1053
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:01,846
Do you expect me
to shower flowers?

1054
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,647
What did we come for
and what are we doing?

1055
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,653
l don't care what you think
l jjust love this earth.

1056
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,683
Wow, that's a lovely dress.

1057
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,325
By the way, what is this called?

1058
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,158
Lollypop.

1059
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,889
ls that so? Will you give it to me?

1060
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,591
ou should lick it
not bite into it.

1061
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:18,860
So, you hold it like this and...

1062
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,765
Mom! My lollypop!

1063
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,771
What's wrong?
What's the matter, dear?

1064
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:23,897
Thief! Thief!

1065
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,439
-Who are you?
- Thief!

1066
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:26,701
He is running away.

1067
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,868
They think we are thieves.

1068
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,309
Come on run! Fast!

1069
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,604
He is running away. Catch him.

1070
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,678
What is this? Nobody ever ran
from me like that.

1071
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:33,578
What do you think is the matter?

1072
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:34,479
l think he is a thief.

1073
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,485
When l'm here?
They are finished! Come on!

1074
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,078
The figures are good.

1075
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,120
Let me settle here.

1076
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,487
Such a big war
for a small lollypop?

1077
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,122
He saw! He saw again!

1078
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,195
ou again? Wait!

1079
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,523
Listen! He saw again!

1080
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,825
Oh God!
Tell me what l saw!

1081
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,125
Oh dear!
lt's you! Who is he?

1082
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,271
He is the one! He was
in the bathroom the other day!

1083
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,132
How dare you see
my wife and make her run...

1084
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,800
...half naked in the city?

1085
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:04,547
Silk! our promise and my revenge
will be fulfilled today.

1086
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,045
- Where is the knife?
- Here you go.

1087
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,210
No, you'll be dead if l kill you.

1088
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,479
yes, that's correct.

1089
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,687
l'll take revenge
by giving insult for insult.

1090
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,846
Only then l'll kill you.

1091
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,048
Hey, hold this.

1092
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,788
He saw my wife half naked.

1093
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,790
Rip his clothes off and chase
him in the city. Come on, go.

1094
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:21,930
Oh God! What a humiliation!

1095
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,431
Did you see what l'm capable of?

1096
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,626
How can l return to ama's world
after this humiliation?

1097
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,427
- Silk Dada!
- Long live!

1098
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,834
- Silk Dada!
- Long live!

1099
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:34,100
What can l do if your
wife comes in my all the time?

1100
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:38,106
Silk! ou'll definitely
come to hell one day.

1101
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,977
l will torture you so much
that you'll regret this.

1102
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,512
Oh dear!

1103
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,857
Give me your leg.

1104
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,425
The rickshaw man is here
He's honking.

1105
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,254
Give me your leg.

1106
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,725
Mom, the shoe is biting me.

1107
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,623
What? ou feel that
when you wear new shoWS.

1108
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,061
ou always make a scene
before going to school.

1109
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,289
Be quiet. Don't make noise.

1110
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,423
Why is she crying?

1111
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,693
She's playing tricks
to avoid going to school.

1112
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,301
l'll give you a tight slap.
Come on.

1113
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,393
The shoe is biting me.

1114
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,529
Don't cry. l said don't cry.

1115
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,073
- lt's hurting me.
- Bye.

1116
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,504
What is this? ou can clearly
see that Royyala Naidu...

1117
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:10,910
...is cheating us in the name
of insurance policies.

1118
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,012
Why didn't the previous
officers file a case?

1119
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,649
They tried doing that.

1120
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,786
That's why they became
previous officers.

1121
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:19,320
And you became the new officer.

1122
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,153
Hello! What?
Ascorpion bit her?

1123
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,627
ou get the kids ready
for school every day, right?

1124
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,593
Don't you have
the common sense...

1125
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,258
...to check the shoes before
making the kids wear them?

1126
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,594
Look what happened now.

1127
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,061
l should've known that
if l treat a servant girl...

1128
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,037
...like a family member
she'll forget her duties. Pathetic!

1129
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,932
Don't worry. She is out of danger
ou can see her.

1130
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,237
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.

1131
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:45,844
What is this, amaja?

1132
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,950
l got the kids ready
for school today, didn't l?

1133
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,310
Mom scolded you because
she didn't know that.

1134
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,648
But you didn't speak a word.

1135
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,979
When you were becoming
close to everyone...

1136
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,081
...with your goodness
l thought my l'll lose my value.

1137
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:59,525
l never tried to understand
you please forgive me.

1138
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:00,760
Sorry.

1139
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:04,396
amaja, why were you silent
when it wasn't your fault?

1140
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,728
What happened today
was jjust a mistake.

1141
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:10,634
Scolding me or sister
for it would be the same.

1142
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,102
Did you feel hurt?

1143
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:16,102
l'm not a neighbor
to feel hurt, husband.

1144
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,805
Husband, what are you looking at?

1145
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,369
The moonlight
lt looks beautiful, doesn't it?

1146
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,509
Moonlight is always beautiful.

1147
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,246
But my eyes never saw
its beauty till today.

1148
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,317
Now l can see it clearly.

1149
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,610
Really?

1150
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,190
l tried to get rid of
you all these days.

1151
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,825
But now l feel l can't lose you.

1152
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,325
Okay, tell me where you father is.

1153
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,658
l'll call him up and say
that you'll be with me forever.

1154
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,959
My father doesn't have a phone.

1155
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,900
Even beggars have i-pads these days.

1156
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,834
By the way, what does your father do?

1157
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,066
He punishes the bad people.

1158
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,143
Oh, he is ajudge. Now l got it.

1159
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,209
ou love dramas jjust like me.

1160
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,404
But your father hates
them jjust like my father.

1161
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,640
So, one day you both
had an argument.

1162
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,918
And the next day you
ran away from home, right?

1163
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,519
amaja, what's wrong?

1164
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,189
l miss my brother.

1165
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,225
That means l have a brother-in-law.

1166
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,984
He loves me very much.

1167
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,858
He can't stay without me orfood.

1168
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,031
Where is he now?.

1169
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,498
- Chitragupta!
-es?

1170
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,161
l love these lollypops.

1171
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,966
We'll take 100 lollypops
when we return to ama's World.

1172
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,006
He's a lollypop and
his father is a fool.

1173
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,133
l heard that.

1174
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,040
ou heard it but didn't
understand it, right?

1175
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:01,079
Stop your nonsense.
l need, to rest now. l'll lie down here.

1176
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,980
This is called a road
Vehicles and dogs run on this.

1177
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,518
l'm not scared of them.

1178
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,557
They might get scared of you
and attack your vital parts.

1179
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,747
My vital parts?

1180
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,460
''l have what you want.''

1181
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,755
He says he has what we want
Let's ask him.

1182
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:15,888
He's coming to us.

1183
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,900
Do you have what l need?

1184
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,435
That's right in your mouth.

1185
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,935
l'll break your skull.

1186
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,469
l need matches.

1187
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,038
What are matches?

1188
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,404
- Fire
- Fire?

1189
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,645
Human, if you show us
a place to rest...

1190
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:32,715
...l'll give you matches.

1191
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:33,680
- Really?
-es.

1192
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,115
There!

1193
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,919
There? Let's go.

1194
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,854
Wait! What about my fire?

1195
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,289
That smells disgjusting.

1196
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,460
Wow!

1197
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:54,728
-young yama!
-yes?

1198
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:58,501
This place looks good for resting.

1199
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,341
Chitragupta!

1200
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,444
Who are they?

1201
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,441
just as we have guards
of death in our world...

1202
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:04,775
...they have protective
guards in this world.

1203
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:06,779
Why don't they have horns?

1204
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,884
They don't need horns
they jjust need money.

1205
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:09,882
Oh...

1206
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,987
Chitragupta! l didn't see
this toy in any other world.

1207
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:14,920
What is this?

1208
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,150
This is that man's weapon.

1209
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:17,950
What does he do with it?

1210
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:22,029
lf you put your finger in
the ring and pull the trigger...

1211
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,793
...lots of lollypops
come out from this hole.

1212
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,630
Lollypops? Why didn't you
tell me sooner?

1213
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,570
Chittu! These lollypops
have no taste.

1214
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:36,972
They tastejjust like grass.

1215
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,475
Who are you?

1216
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,219
Ganda! Yamaganda!

1217
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,020
What do you want?

1218
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,117
We need a place to sleep.

1219
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,591
you should be
a policeman like me...

1220
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,321
...or a criminal like him
to sleep here.

1221
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,360
Who is a criminal?

1222
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:58,795
A person who picks pockets,
steals chains...

1223
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,767
...does eve teasing
and kidnapping...

1224
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:06,001
...or at least beats up
the person before him.

1225
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,304
l like the last option very much.

1226
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,619
How dare you hit me?

1227
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,689
One, two...

1228
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:33,165
He's going around like a wheel
Blow him away.

1229
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,531
l'm the future yama!

1230
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,039
Oh God! The same reaction.

1231
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,410
They are definitely related
to that devoted wife.

1232
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:52,112
Naresh! Open the door.

1233
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,252
Who are you guys?

1234
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,991
Why are you disturbing
us at this hour?

1235
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,684
Did you lose your mind
like our town's lnspector?

1236
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,558
What did you say?

1237
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,221
Sir! How did you get hurt?

1238
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,762
Did someone get
drunk and beat you up?

1239
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,128
Or did they plant a bomb?

1240
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,464
New members of
yourfamily entered...

1241
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,765
...and closed all
the entries of our bodies.

1242
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,804
- My family?
- Take a look.

1243
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,878
Their faces look familiar.

1244
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,810
Human, it's us this morning
we hid behind you...

1245
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,280
...when those
people were chasing us.

1246
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,348
Will they become
my family members...

1247
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,611
...because they hid behind me?

1248
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,276
Not for hiding or
anything else.

1249
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,181
We brought them here
to avoid further trouble.

1250
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,586
l don't care about all that.

1251
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,885
Have a look
Do our genes match in any way?

1252
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,594
We don't care if the jeans,
or underwear match or not.

1253
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,321
The shock treatment
that the girl gave earlier...

1254
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,591
...and the shock treatment
they gave today match.

1255
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,700
That's why we brought them here.

1256
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:46,041
- Sister!
- Brother!

1257
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,372
Sister! How are you?

1258
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,410
- Brother!
- Sister!

1259
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:50,877
Greetings to Princess Yamaja.

1260
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,479
Enough of your greetings.

1261
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:53,639
Are they yourfamily?

1262
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,478
yes.

1263
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,917
Did you hear that?
My eyes may deceive me.

1264
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,519
But my wounded body
won't will never deceive me.

1265
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,757
Tell me where your family
members are not there.

1266
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,425
l'll get myself transferred there.

1267
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,325
Orthe remaining parts
of my body will be transferred.

1268
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,327
l'll take your leave.

1269
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,226
Bye.

1270
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,299
Why is he leaving?

1271
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,724
Who are these men in disguises?

1272
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:13,833
Are they from your drama company?

1273
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,096
No, dad. He is my brother-in-law.

1274
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,229
l mean, he is this girl's brother.

1275
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,203
l don't know who he is.

1276
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,205
l know.

1277
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,842
l'm Lord Yama's right hand.

1278
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:21,739
Why is he talking like that?

1279
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,506
He hasn't come out
of his character yet.

1280
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:25,876
l thought you were the only fool.

1281
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,312
But looks like
there are many like you.

1282
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,710
Why did they come here?

1283
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:29,716
For my sister.

1284
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,116
Do you have to come
at midnight to see your sister?

1285
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,949
We started this morning
in Yama's world

1286
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,145
But it became night
by the time we reached here.

1287
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,281
He is out of his mind.

1288
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,017
Looks like they didn't
eat anything since morning.

1289
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,023
Dear! Take your brother
inside and give him food.

1290
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:39,651
Okay.

1291
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,024
Keep this mad man
out of the house.

1292
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,425
Feed him here and
make him sleep here.

1293
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,162
Come in, brother.

1294
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:53,642
Padma!

1295
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,377
l opened new toothpaste yesterday.

1296
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:56,911
But l can't see it today.

1297
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,276
l think you need
to get your eyes tested.

1298
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,010
you fool! l said there is
no paste in this tube.

1299
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,052
Forget about the paste
that you opened yesterday.

1300
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:06,086
l opened a new soap
and it disappeared...

1301
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:06,984
...by the time l got my towel.

1302
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,150
Notjjust the soaps,
all the breakfast l made is gone.

1303
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,557
All the monthly groceries
in the kitchen are gone too.

1304
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:13,993
l think some thieves stole them.

1305
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,724
Why will those thieves
need my medicines?

1306
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:16,856
They took them as well.

1307
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:18,934
How can they rob
our house when l'm here?

1308
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:19,831
There's no chance for that.

1309
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,130
Our Yamaganda did all this
not any thieves.

1310
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,796
Did he sell all those things?

1311
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:24,895
No, he ate them.

1312
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,105
No matter what your guest
eats at your home...

1313
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,269
...it comes under hospitality.

1314
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,208
But he even ate
the sash gourd that we hanged...

1315
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,747
...at our doorpost to save
our house from evil eyes.

1316
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,182
What is happening here?

1317
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,751
Any human will have
breakfast in the morning.

1318
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,480
Why is he eating medicines
soaps, and toothpastes?

1319
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,558
He will eat anything
as long as it is eatable.

1320
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,455
Where is that glutton?

1321
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,161
l think he has a cleaning
liquid in his hand.

1322
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,893
Sister, this is delicious.

1323
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,902
But this liquid is even better.

1324
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,665
Oh God! That is a cleaning liquid.

1325
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:01,469
Oh no! Did you drink that
liquid like a fruitjuice?

1326
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,339
ou'll die, you fool. ou'll die.

1327
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,241
There's no need to worry.

1328
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,815
He can eat and digest anything.

1329
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:07,779
- Really?
-yes.

1330
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,579
Dear, if he continues
to stay in our house...

1331
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,414
...we'll have to beg alms
forthe rest of our lives.

1332
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:12,578
Send him away immediately.

1333
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,246
There's no need forthat
l'll leave myself.

1334
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,824
Sister, let's go to our home.

1335
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:16,890
Oh no!

1336
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,391
l think he'll end my love story.

1337
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:21,460
l can handle my dad later on.

1338
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,996
But for now l'll have to make
sure this fellow stays here.

1339
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:25,963
Brother-in-law!

1340
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:29,060
you can call me with
any name you like.

1341
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,263
But l don't want you
to call me brother-in-law.

1342
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,337
But l like you
That's why l brought you here...

1343
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,568
...so that you can have fun.

1344
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,245
ou can buy whateveryou want
l'll pay for it.

1345
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:38,472
- Listen...
-yes?

1346
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,548
Beautiful cheeks.

1347
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:42,183
Adelicate nose that
reddens when you smile.

1348
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,315
Lips that are like
petals of a red rose.

1349
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,749
Tiny waist that
attracts your attention.

1350
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,850
He is praising him
and touching her.

1351
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,589
Stop it...l'm nothing
like you described.

1352
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:57,427
He was praising your sister. es.

1353
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,761
Who gave you the right
to praise my sister?

1354
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,733
-you.
- Me? How?.

1355
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,060
Like that.

1356
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,999
Oh God! How does
he know my weakness?

1357
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,274
Look, you can't
buy me with ice-cream.

1358
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,366
Won't you eat it
if l buy it for you?

1359
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,772
No one in my family
takes a back step.

1360
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,575
Let's go. Come on.

1361
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,479
l don't have change, Lord.

1362
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:15,516
- Hey...
-es?

1363
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,279
ou stay right here
l need to speak to you in private.

1364
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:18,216
Okay.

1365
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:19,512
Give two ice-creams.

1366
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:20,418
Okay, sir.

1367
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,615
Hello! The ice-cream
should be chilled.

1368
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,019
Close your mouth
l can see your spinal cord.

1369
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,456
ou can eat as many as you want.

1370
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,492
l'll pay you.

1371
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,526
- Okay, sir.
- Enjoy yourself.

1372
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,057
l said l'll pay you
after he finishes eating.

1373
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,030
He finished eating, sir.

1374
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,065
That's okay.
Give him two more.

1375
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:32,964
He ate all of them, sir.

1376
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:33,831
All?

1377
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,132
ou said you'll buy
me a big ice-cream.

1378
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,539
Why are these so tiny?

1379
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,005
Are these the ice-creams?
ou deceived me.

1380
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:44,077
l want some more.

1381
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,876
Oh God! l need to divert
him with mind, not food.

1382
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,108
Come with me,
l'll tell you something.

1383
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,240
Get your hands off me.

1384
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:50,916
Are you your sister's only brother?

1385
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,782
l'm also the only son
to my father. So what?

1386
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,287
l think there's one more like you.

1387
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:58,416
ou think l'll believe
you so easily? l trjust my father.

1388
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,562
- But l don't trjust him.
- Lord Yama!

1389
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:01,687
l'm asking him who it is.

1390
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:02,661
How will l knowthat?

1391
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,494
He looks exactly like you
l saw him hiding...

1392
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,329
...in that swimming, pool
after seeing you.

1393
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,037
Lord, if he is exactly like you
he'll come to...

1394
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:12,369
...ask for a share in
the kingship of Yama's World.

1395
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,973
ou saved me. l'll bury him
in the same water right now.

1396
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:19,478
l'm coming for you
Where are you? es!

1397
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,378
Chitragupta!

1398
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:21,643
- l'm coming, Lord
- He looks exactly like me.

1399
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,343
So this is the work
that my father comes to do...

1400
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,544
...on the earth from time to time.

1401
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,211
Hey, who are you?

1402
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:27,749
How dare you
talk like that to me?

1403
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,653
l'm coming to get you!
God, give me strength!

1404
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,956
Now show yourself to me.

1405
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:37,499
Lord, chop him up into
tiny pieces and feed the fish.

1406
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,464
Okay, Chitragupta!

1407
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,626
What? This man looks like me.

1408
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,403
He removed his cap
when l removed my cap.

1409
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,938
Lord, l think your father
and my father came to this...

1410
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:50,035
...earth behind our backs
and fulfilled their desires.

1411
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,372
Now l'll teach him a lesson.

1412
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,811
Hey!

1413
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,316
l won't spare you.

1414
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,215
l'm my father's favourite
l'll destroy you today.

1415
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,488
- l got him.
- l got him.

1416
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,190
Oh God! They saw me again!

1417
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,951
- l didn't do anything.
- They saw me again!

1418
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,087
l've seen her before.

1419
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,397
Chitragupta! ls she
the same woman that...

1420
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,899
...we saw in the bathroom
and then in the shopping mall?

1421
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,002
They saw me again.

1422
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,661
ou show everything to
the world and nothing to me.

1423
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:16,635
Go inside now.

1424
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,741
How dare you touch
my wife before my eyes?

1425
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:20,899
Shut up!

1426
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,103
our wife was romancing
someone under water.

1427
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,509
We pulled her up
He looks exactly like you.

1428
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:26,603
See if he is your brother.

1429
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,917
Oh God! He looks jjust like me.

1430
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,046
Father! When did you do this mistake?

1431
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,322
He looks exactly like me.

1432
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:38,359
Brother! l won't spare
you because you are my brother.

1433
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,330
He doesn't knowthat his life
will be in danger in water.

1434
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,195
But we know that. Let's go.

1435
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,626
Finally l got a chance
to speak to you in private.

1436
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,662
l think my heart will die,
if l don't tell this to you.

1437
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:51,932
l'll tell you.

1438
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,505
l'm going to tell you.

1439
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,939
l love you.

1440
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:29,437
Oh girl! With pistol like body
You shot my heart with your bullet eyes

1441
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:34,676
Lost my control, baby
My heart became holey

1442
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:44,685
Oh girl! With pistol like body
You shot my heart with your bullet eyes

1443
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:49,822
Lost my control, baby
My heart became holey

1444
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:54,835
You made me feel crazy
Touched and made me softy

1445
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:59,840
Stay with me
And l'd dance in the air

1446
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:10,147
l'll be your man if l am born again
Would pray to God for that

1447
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:42,876
lf l have this pretty as my girl
l'll live for a 100 years

1448
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:48,013
When l have this great beauty near me
l am in a dilemma to cross beyond limits

1449
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,959
Explore her daily
The milky beauty is for you

1450
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:57,965
Rob pleasures from me non-stop
No restrictions for you, my beau

1451
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:02,800
On her slender body,
is written my name

1452
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:07,103
Seeking me
She has joined me

1453
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:13,004
Stay with me
And l'd dance in the air

1454
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:18,212
l'll be your man if l am born again
Would pray to God for that

1455
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:47,281
lf you are a knife, l'll stab myself
Though it is pain to lose my life

1456
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:52,443
l'll fondle and care you like a baby
despite peoples'gags

1457
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:57,492
You're brimming with love now
Announce it for the people to know

1458
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:02,360
lf you feel hungry
Would offer my beauty to taste

1459
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:07,197
Won't leave you
even if you thrash me or kick me out

1460
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:11,706
l'll stay on your forehead as Kumkum

1461
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:17,343
Stay with me
And l'd dance in the air

1462
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:23,009
l'll be your man if l am born again
Would pray to God for that

1463
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,895
'After considering all these
evidences, it is proved that...'

1464
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,660
'...the accused Royyala Naidu
has killed many fishermen...'

1465
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:45,502
'...for his business.
So, under lPC sections 302 and 420...'

1466
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:48,303
'...the accused is,
given a life sentence.

1467
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,240
They have been...

1468
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,209
Officer!

1469
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,782
l might've gone to the temple
a couple of times by mistake.

1470
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,675
But l've never been
to a court before.

1471
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:58,775
ou forced me to come here.

1472
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,879
ou handcuffed the hands
that gave you a bouquet.

1473
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:05,893
Time is on your side.
But l'm like a cobra.

1474
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:07,660
l'll balance it out very soon.

1475
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,334
Chittu! ou said we'll
find a way to save my sister...

1476
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,461
...from that human.
But l can't see anything here.

1477
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,572
ou are fool!

1478
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,908
Finding a way is not
as easy as finding an onion.

1479
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:25,644
We should go stealthily
and take your sister away.

1480
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,247
There she is. Let's go.

1481
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,417
Don't make any noise.

1482
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:32,379
Come on.

1483
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,485
l'm feeling homesick.

1484
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,890
lf we travel another
100,000 kilometers...

1485
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,865
...you, me and your sister
will be in yama's World.

1486
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,696
- Oh no!
-What?

1487
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,670
Chittu! My sister has changed.

1488
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:54,072
People in love do change.

1489
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,610
ou fool! She is that human's
sister-in-law, not my sister.

1490
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,771
Let me see.

1491
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,405
Let me sleep.

1492
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,575
Why are you both besides me?

1493
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,051
ou were floating in air,
so we are trying to stop you.

1494
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:08,785
Oh God!
Why am l floating in the air?

1495
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,585
That's what l said.
These days it's fashion...

1496
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:13,786
...to lose a lot of weight
to become size zero.

1497
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,759
What? Did l lose so much weight?

1498
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:16,956
Did l become a size zero?

1499
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,599
Oh God!

1500
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:20,265
Thank God!

1501
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:21,301
She fainted for good.

1502
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,934
We'll take her down
before she wakes up.

1503
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,876
Chittu! My sister
usually sleeps here.

1504
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,044
How did she come here?

1505
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:32,374
She might've lost
interest in her husband...

1506
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:33,243
Sister...

1507
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,044
She felt hot inside
as there was no power.

1508
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,481
So she came and slept here.

1509
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,981
ou switched off the power, didn't you?

1510
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:45,820
l know that you came
here to take me back with you.

1511
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,019
But l can't leave my husband.

1512
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,528
This is my in-laws place,
your brother-in-laws place.

1513
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,360
l won't accept that
human as my brother-in-law.

1514
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,126
lf that's the case
since l'm that human's wife...

1515
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:55,430
...l'm not related to you anymore.

1516
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,631
Sister, don't say that
l won't be able to bearthat.

1517
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:01,436
Brother, there are inter-caste
and inter-religion marriages.

1518
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,478
ls it wrong to have
an inter-world marriage?

1519
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:09,048
Even though our mother
was from heaven...

1520
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,346
...she became
the daughter-in-law of yama's world.

1521
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,646
lf she hadn't done that, you and l...

1522
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,781
...would never have
been a brother and sister.

1523
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,789
We wouldn't have had
this headache as well.

1524
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,360
Brother, try to understand
your sister's heart.

1525
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,454
Chitragupta!

1526
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,200
My sister's happiness
is more important for me.

1527
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,633
ou go back and
l'll stay with my sister.

1528
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,671
Hey, stop chanting
your sister's name.

1529
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,736
ou'll father will skin
you if you don't go back.

1530
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:33,773
l'm Lord yama!

1531
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:34,672
Are you upset?

1532
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,302
ou are a man that
has no affection for anyone.

1533
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,108
Why should l listen to you?

1534
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,976
All the worlds should unite
to separate me from my sister.

1535
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,348
ou can do what you want to.

1536
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:47,613
Even his father
didn't abuse me so badly.

1537
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,087
What will you say now?.

1538
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,520
l have lots of lollypops.

1539
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:56,964
Sister, will you come
with us or not?

1540
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,089
How can l ask her that?

1541
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,428
No, l won't come.

1542
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:03,127
Go and tell our parents
that l'm safe.

1543
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,429
Give that to me.

1544
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,403
Okay, sister.
We'll take your leave.

1545
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,604
- Greetings.
- Bye!

1546
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,486
Where is your brother?

1547
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:24,650
l didn't see him since morning.

1548
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,125
He had come for me.

1549
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,695
But l sent him away foryou.

1550
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,769
Husband, you said you have
something important to say.

1551
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:38,600
l wanted to tell that to you
in this sacred place. Let's go.

1552
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,113
Husband, what are they doing?

1553
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,613
They believe that
if they tie their desires...

1554
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,078
...in the form of
a bundle on that tree...

1555
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:51,209
...Goddess will fulfill them
That's why they are doing it.

1556
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:52,580
Come on.

1557
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,202
Why are you tying that bundle?

1558
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,199
ou mjust've wished
for something important.

1559
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:10,967
es. l wished that my in-laws
family should be...

1560
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,507
...happy and prosperous
for all eternity.

1561
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,514
When l put this garland
in your neck that day...

1562
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,120
...you accepted me as your husband.

1563
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,788
Today l consider this
garland as a wedding chain...

1564
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:32,292
...and take you as my wife
before the five elements.

1565
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:41,402
l'll introduce you
to my family as the...

1566
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,266
...younger daughter-in-law
of the house. Come.

1567
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:02,747
Greetings to my father!

1568
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,685
He entered as a comic
villain in a cartoon movie.

1569
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,759
ls he yourfather?
l thought he was ajudge.

1570
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,088
ls he a part of our
drama company?

1571
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,198
Father, l thought graphics
are limited to movies.

1572
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,699
Do they have them
in dramas as well?

1573
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,266
Father, your entry was super.

1574
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,202
Human! Are you joking
with Lord yama?

1575
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,398
Enough of this act now
Get down from the buffalo.

1576
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,771
lf the Blue Cross people see you
you'll be in trouble.

1577
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:25,039
l'm yama! yama!

1578
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:28,442
Really? Have you stopped
calling yourself Lord yama?

1579
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,481
l'm yama! ls that
the latest trend? lt's good.

1580
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:35,282
Lord yama's getup for your
tiny personality is very comic.

1581
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:39,458
ou are mistaken
My father is the real Lord yama.

1582
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,119
l'm from yama's World
l had mentioned it...

1583
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,288
...many times but
you didn't believe me.

1584
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,198
'l left you far away
How did you come here?'

1585
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,394
'l followed you and got
into that strange vehicle.'

1586
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,274
'That man in the TV is my father.'

1587
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,104
'ls Brahma your uncle?'

1588
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,279
'No, Shani is my uncle.'

1589
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:00,947
Yamaja, l didn't come to the earth...

1590
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:04,018
...to prove to this foolish
man that l'm Lord yama.

1591
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:05,484
l came here to take you back.

1592
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,748
Father, l can't leave
my husband to come with you.

1593
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,153
ls that so?

1594
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,060
Father, give my yamaja back to me.

1595
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,468
Otherwise l won't let you go.

1596
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:29,066
Human! l will go up
because l'm yama.

1597
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,309
Let's go.

1598
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,519
NO RESTFOR YAMA

1599
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:58,072
Hey, Human! Usually yama
folloWS the humans.

1600
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,733
But why are you following yama?
Let go off the tail!

1601
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,675
l won't let go off the tail,
if you don't give me my yamaja.

1602
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,872
Howfar will you come like that?

1603
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:07,278
l haven't decided that yet.

1604
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,976
But l've decided that
l'll come any distance for my yamaja.

1605
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:13,577
ou fool! Have you gone mad?

1606
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,486
This is love, not madness.

1607
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,215
Why will you know
about love, father?

1608
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:20,323
lt starts in the heart
and fills the body with power.

1609
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:22,256
No matter how many
villains like you attack...

1610
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,127
...love will win in the end.

1611
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:25,631
l don't think
this human will let go.

1612
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:27,759
What should l do now?.

1613
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:32,030
yes, a weakness is
strongerthan strength.

1614
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,505
l should attack him there.

1615
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:35,599
Hey, Human! l like you!

1616
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:40,805
l like your determination
for love and yourfaith in love.

1617
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:44,077
l'll get my daughter married to you.

1618
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:46,951
But you haven't even
passed your exams.

1619
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,647
How can l give my daughter to you?

1620
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,314
Will you get me married
to her if l pass my exams?

1621
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,017
- Okay, son.
- ls that a promise?

1622
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,185
Father! Father!

1623
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:59,459
Did you see how l
got rid of you? l'm yama!

1624
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,093
ou! How can you
leave me in mid air?

1625
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,364
Somebody please save me

1626
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:09,401
What is this place?

1627
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,637
lt looks like a huge
set in Gunashekhar's movie.

1628
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,272
Where is the entry
and exit for this location?

1629
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,510
Where is that voice coming from?

1630
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:21,717
Om!

1631
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:28,588
'Who is this solo
man in this huge set?'

1632
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,130
This is not a marriage
to work together, son.

1633
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,663
l'm doing meditation.

1634
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,635
That's why l came here solo.

1635
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,704
Wow! ou caught my inner voice.

1636
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,432
We sages are used to doing that.

1637
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:40,200
Sage, where am l?

1638
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:41,309
ou are here, son.

1639
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,775
l meant, what's the name
of this colorful desert?

1640
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,071
This is Trishanku Heaven, son.

1641
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,341
Heaven? ls there
where Rambha, Urvashi...

1642
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,541
...and Menaka do cabaret dances?

1643
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:49,513
Don't get too excited, son.

1644
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,210
That heaven and this heaven
are totally different places.

1645
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:52,718
This is Trishanku Heaven.

1646
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:54,913
There are no revelries
and parties here.

1647
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,717
Sage, l have a small doubt.

1648
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,383
ou don't have proper
transportation to come here.

1649
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,960
l caught the buffalo's tail and came here
What about you?

1650
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:04,098
That is my question
l'm a great sage, son.

1651
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:07,426
l have power to come
and go anywhere l want to.

1652
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:08,662
There is no logic.

1653
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,830
But there is something
behind your coming here.

1654
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,167
Wait a minute.

1655
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:16,503
ou are God's offering, son.

1656
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:17,541
By God's offering, do you mean...

1657
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,876
...Milk Pudding,
Lime Rice and ogurt Rice?

1658
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,539
l'm not talking about offerings
that are eatable, son.

1659
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:24,844
God's offering means God's gift.

1660
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,285
l am God's gift?
Oh God, that sounds very serious.

1661
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:29,617
Can you please give me the details?

1662
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:31,692
ou are a man that
doesn't know fear.

1663
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,288
our shout will be like a thunder.

1664
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,263
ou are a trend setter
not a trend follower.

1665
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:42,669
ou didn't die and come here.

1666
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,740
ou came here to
make yama's World dance.

1667
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:48,637
Sage, after hearing your dialogues...

1668
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:51,368
...my whole body is filled
with power like a superhero.

1669
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,344
Maintain that same power.

1670
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,345
l will.

1671
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:58,316
Lord yama, you cut
my love story short in half way.

1672
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,178
ou will have no peace
till this movie ends.

1673
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:02,756
Go ahead, human.

1674
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,486
Nobody can stop you now. Go!

1675
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:08,119
How can l go?
l don't knowthis place at all.

1676
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,162
How do l reach yama's World?

1677
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:10,162
Very simple.

1678
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:13,564
ln your world, there are
four directions and several ways.

1679
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:15,533
But here there are only two ways.

1680
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,071
The earth is down
and yama's World is up.

1681
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,401
Really? How should
l go to yama's World now?

1682
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:21,907
Don't ask me questions?

1683
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,602
our love has
the powerto show you way.

1684
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,679
Wish for it with sincerity.

1685
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,777
ou will reach your destination. Go!

1686
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:32,581
Thank you.

1687
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,348
Narayana!

1688
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:35,747
Where is he?

1689
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,637
The Lord looks very
happy after a long time.

1690
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,642
Did you show your strength
on madam after a long gap?

1691
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:59,145
Hey! l'm happy because
l got rid of that stupid human...

1692
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:02,773
...on the way and brought
my daughter back home.

1693
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:04,708
l agree that you got rid of him.

1694
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:06,911
But can your daughter
stay without him?

1695
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,077
Can you really stop her?

1696
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:12,159
What did you say?
There's nothing l can't do.

1697
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,821
That's why l shut
her up in a secret place.

1698
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:21,594
What is it?
ls it applause for my victory?

1699
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:24,201
Enough of your laughing.

1700
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,103
lt was a quake that
said that the human is here.

1701
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:42,379
My dear father!
As this place is new to me...

1702
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:45,220
...you thought l'll get lost like
a kid in the market, didn't you?

1703
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,021
ou are in my world
you can't escape from here.

1704
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:49,824
What? Who said anything
about escaping?

1705
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,230
l'm not leaving this place
without yamaja.

1706
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:55,636
What did you say?

1707
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,068
ou can do that if you know
where my daughter is.

1708
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,641
First find her and then
you can take her with you.

1709
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:16,924
ou can do nothing but talk.

1710
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:22,019
What did you say?
Did you say l can't do anything?

1711
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,630
This is a test of love
not a test of proving yourself.

1712
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:27,201
But if you insist
let me tell you something.

1713
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,338
our daughter left your world
and came to earth for me.

1714
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:31,928
Why didn't you do anything then?

1715
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,438
Forget that you sent
your son and Chitragupta...

1716
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:38,034
...to bring back your daughter
that fell in love with me.

1717
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:39,613
Why didn't they do anything?

1718
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,545
How can you challenge me?

1719
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,550
ou came on the buffalo
to kidnap your own daughter.

1720
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,120
What were you able
to do at that time?

1721
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,520
Without any vehicle
facility or a passport...

1722
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:52,286
...or a trip to the airport
didn't l catch hold of the animal's tail...

1723
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:54,453
...and travel through
the other worlds to come here?

1724
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:57,122
Didn't you see what
l can actually do?

1725
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:01,300
Now you are asking me
to find my darling that you hid.

1726
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:05,768
l'll do that and defeat
you completely. Any doubt?

1727
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,901
ou have the past
but l have the present and the future.

1728
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,979
Hello! Even defeat is yours, father.

1729
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:16,640
My coming here is
your first and present defeat.

1730
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:17,649
He is the right man!

1731
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:18,582
l'll see you later.

1732
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:22,213
Oh no! This man made
even Lord yama dance to him.

1733
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:25,520
lf he catches me
my garland will fall to the ground.

1734
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,727
Control yourtummy, uncle.

1735
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,163
Chitragupta!

1736
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:31,198
-yes, Lord?
- Why is that human so overconfident?

1737
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:33,460
He is an extraordinary human, Lord.

1738
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:37,227
He doesn't have enough
flesh in his body.

1739
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:39,272
But he has love foryour daughter...

1740
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,066
...and the courage
to make her his own.

1741
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:44,244
Those two weapons are
enough to give him victory.

1742
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,607
That's impossible!

1743
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,375
lt is possible. Narayana!

1744
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,980
This is not the time
to get angry or scream.

1745
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,254
lt is better to be patient.

1746
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,823
What did you say?
What did you say?

1747
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,825
Did you forget
what will come after...

1748
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,654
...the tenth day from today?

1749
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,229
- Eleventh day
- Stop your calculations.

1750
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,228
Am l wrong?

1751
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:07,358
l didn't ask the number
Which day is that?

1752
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,628
Sunday, a New Moon day. So?

1753
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:16,001
Since that human has
the same powers as us...

1754
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:19,838
...you can do nothing but
hear when he speaks or argues.

1755
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,414
But did you forget
that this New Moon day...

1756
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:26,283
...Gods of Eight Directions
are going to unite their powers?

1757
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:27,046
So what?

1758
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:29,988
Give that human,
a taste of your power.

1759
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,991
Until then, that human
will make him dance to his tunes.

1760
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,186
yes, even if he dances
or makes you dance...

1761
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:36,830
He needs to shut
his mouth and sit.

1762
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:37,522
Chitragupta!

1763
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:38,859
He said that, Lord.

1764
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,599
Narayana!

1765
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,042
This looks like
a family pack.

1766
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:57,243
Who is she? She's equally
beautiful as my darling.

1767
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,381
Why is such a glamorous woman
in this frame?

1768
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,480
ls she an aunt? Maybe.

1769
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,622
l need to change
this aunt into an antenna...

1770
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,957
...that will telecast
my love program successfully.

1771
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:14,529
Who is it?

1772
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:16,501
l'll tell you that
But ladies first. Who are you?

1773
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:17,571
l'm Lord yama's...

1774
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,104
ounger daughter, right?

1775
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:25,011
l correctly recognized
that you are amraja's kid sister.

1776
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:27,274
No, l'm not yamaja's kid sister.

1777
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:28,404
Are you her older sister?

1778
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:30,717
ou don't look older to her
Please tell me the truth.

1779
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:31,876
Are you kidding me?

1780
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:36,252
No, l'm Lord yama's wife, Aiyo.

1781
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:39,016
Oh God! Oh dear God!

1782
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:39,923
What's wrong?

1783
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,562
Such a beautiful
and delicate woman...

1784
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:45,027
...like you is Lord yama's wife?

1785
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,601
Oh God! This is totally unfair!

1786
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,830
Sons of Gods! Sages! Angels!

1787
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,270
ls there nobody to question this?

1788
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,408
All of them went to do their duties.

1789
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:57,077
ou were born in
a wrong place, mother.

1790
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:58,806
Had you been born on our earth...

1791
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,505
...you would've been a top heroine.

1792
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,877
K. Raghavendra Rao wasn't
fortunate enough to cast you.

1793
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:06,509
Otherwise he would've hit you with...

1794
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,747
...all varieties of fruits
and flowers in all the body parts.

1795
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:09,379
Why is that?

1796
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:10,684
To showcase your glamour, mother.

1797
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:15,194
All young directors will
fall at your feet foryour call sheets.

1798
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:15,819
Hmm.

1799
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:17,090
Does that mean a yes?

1800
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,258
That wasn't a yes, it was a sigh.

1801
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:21,460
lt doesn't suit you, mother.

1802
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:24,037
The sound of a sigh doesn't
suit your skin tone at all.

1803
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:27,034
How are you staying
with that hard-hearted man?

1804
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:29,239
Do you know what you've
lost because of him?

1805
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:31,309
l know. But what's the use?

1806
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:32,811
A bud will blossom into a flower.

1807
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,380
Can a flower turn back into a bud?

1808
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:37,280
ou used a clever dialogue
that can't be censored.

1809
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,885
ou are a beauty with brains.

1810
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,011
Father is pressing you down
with his cunning character.

1811
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,213
ls he pressing me down?

1812
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:44,382
yes, mother.
l'll give you an example.

1813
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,323
Mr. Brahma gave his wife Saraswati...

1814
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,453
...a lotus to sit on
and his wholehearted love.

1815
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,493
-What about Manchu Vishnu?
-What?

1816
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:53,157
l mean your Vishnu.

1817
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:55,997
ln every form he takes
he has his wife besides him.

1818
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:56,593
es.

1819
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:58,535
Lord Shiva turned
his life partner Paru...

1820
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:01,836
...into half his body and
gave a new life to concept of love.

1821
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:02,670
es.

1822
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:04,404
All Goddesses are
in the top positions...

1823
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:05,501
...and are being
worshipped by people.

1824
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:07,376
ou don't have any temples
or coconuts as offerings.

1825
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:09,278
How can you bear this?

1826
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:12,319
What else can l do?
lf we dig up the past...

1827
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,718
...we'll be left with nothing
else than ditches, son.

1828
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:15,550
That's right.

1829
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,948
But how did you know
that l'm your son-in-law?.

1830
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:22,722
Because you lovingly called
me mother so many times.

1831
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:24,456
ou have blessed me even though...

1832
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:25,657
...he didn't accept
me as his son-in-law.

1833
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,094
That is enough for me, mother.

1834
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,402
But he hid my
yamaja somewhere.

1835
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,503
ou might knowthe place
Please tell me.

1836
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,164
l don't knowthat, son.

1837
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:38,745
l haven't seen my daughter
from a long time.

1838
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,207
l'm worried about her.

1839
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:41,508
ou don't worry, mother.

1840
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:44,283
lf l apply pressure on father...

1841
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:45,919
...he'll definitely give out
the details about yamaja.

1842
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,417
Please bless me, mother.

1843
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,147
l'll see you later.

1844
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,289
Aiyo, how did
that human come here?

1845
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:24,220
He came through the door.

1846
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,956
Why did you let him come?

1847
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:26,923
Why didn't you throw him out?

1848
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,655
Did l ever throw you out?

1849
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:30,390
No. But l'm your husband.

1850
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:32,065
He's my daughter's husband.

1851
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:33,233
Oh! Hey, listen...

1852
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,097
Wives are the same in any world.

1853
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:38,237
They never listen to
their husbands.

1854
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:40,968
l should be careful
as that Narada said.

1855
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:44,437
l shouldn't let even
a thread enter my doors.

1856
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:48,882
What did l do? Why did
you bring me to yama's World?

1857
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:50,650
By the way, who is here?

1858
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:51,446
oung Lord is here.

1859
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,713
Who? Chandra Babu
Mohan Babu or Bali Babu?

1860
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:54,981
None of them
He is our younger Lord.

1861
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:55,987
younger Lord?

1862
01:29:58,659 --> 01:29:59,785
Please come.

1863
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,495
Did you forget me, son?

1864
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:06,132
yes, l got it.

1865
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,601
l dressed you up as a woman
in the shopping mall, right?

1866
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:11,035
yes, Silk Dada.

1867
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:14,003
Did you die before me and come here?

1868
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,971
you died and came here.

1869
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:17,908
yama's World is Lord's native place.

1870
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,740
He is the son of Lord yama.

1871
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:22,677
What? ounger Lord yama?

1872
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:25,147
l'm very sorry, Lord.

1873
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,549
l didn't knowthat you
are a citizen of yama's World.

1874
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,555
So, l humiliated you on the earth.

1875
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:33,889
l liked the way you
humiliated me on the earth.

1876
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:38,989
So, l've decided to
bestow honor on you here.

1877
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,536
Honor? Lord,
you are not like the other lords.

1878
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:46,834
lt's like Karna
was born to Lord yama.

1879
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,074
- Guards! Prepare to honor him.
- Do it quickly.

1880
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:52,369
Please come, Silk Dada.

1881
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:53,343
- l'm coming.
-Welcome.

1882
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,346
What is this waterfor?

1883
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,973
ln yama's World, you need
to bathe before being honored.

1884
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,312
you need to bathe with perfume.

1885
01:30:58,419 --> 01:30:59,613
- ls this perfume?
- Of course.

1886
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:02,222
Then young girls will
bathe me right? Call them.

1887
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:03,449
We don't have girls here.

1888
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:04,683
Bring the mug.

1889
01:31:04,826 --> 01:31:05,986
Why do you walk as
if you are carrying a corpse?

1890
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,059
our mug.

1891
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:09,620
Why did you give me a spoon?

1892
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:11,322
you should bathe with that.

1893
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:14,223
Are you out of your mind?

1894
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:17,098
yes, l'm out of my mind.

1895
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:18,297
This spoon has a hole.

1896
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:19,566
you need to bathe with that.

1897
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:20,572
l don't want your honor.

1898
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:21,903
100 whip strokes,
if you don't like it.

1899
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:22,805
Tell me whom l should hit.

1900
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,400
you will be hit with a whip.

1901
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:29,041
Now l understood that
you'll honor me with revenge.

1902
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,014
That's right.

1903
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,345
Oh God!

1904
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:34,412
yes, enjoy the whipping.

1905
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,080
l'm very happy today.

1906
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:37,781
That's enough, fat fellow.

1907
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:41,919
Sinner! l saw your wife
on earth by accident.

1908
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,894
But you've tortured me
so much for that.

1909
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,296
That was your earth
But this is my world.

1910
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,890
Torture him!

1911
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:51,968
Father! ou hid my darling jjust like...

1912
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:53,665
...the Maoists hide atom bombs.

1913
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:56,766
That funny man caused
all this trouble.

1914
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:58,339
He is such a fool.

1915
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,707
Dangerous!

1916
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:01,843
Dangerous!

1917
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:04,182
Hello, Muni Sharma! Stop!

1918
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:07,584
l'm not Muni Sharma
l'm Michael ackson.

1919
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:10,020
Michael ackson?
ou are dressed like him.

1920
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:12,021
But something is definitely fishy.

1921
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:14,924
Nothing is fishy, man
l'm purely Michael.

1922
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:16,121
Narayana!

1923
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,219
Narayana?

1924
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:20,026
l caught you! Narada!

1925
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:22,032
l'll break your bones.

1926
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:23,770
Even if you dress up,
a rickshaw as a Benz car...

1927
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,031
...it will still be a rickshaw.

1928
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:26,631
Sorry.

1929
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,641
What is your problem?

1930
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:30,267
There are heroes like
Pawan Kalyan and Mahesh Babu...

1931
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:32,311
...on the earth
Then why did you choose this...

1932
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:33,572
...Allari Naresh to be
the hero in your movie?

1933
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:37,981
Actually, l was curious
to see what happens...

1934
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:40,653
...when the earth and
yama's World become relatives.

1935
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:43,022
When l was searching
for the leading man...

1936
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,249
...l thought you would
suit the role very well.

1937
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,452
Why are you going
around in disguise?

1938
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:48,790
What can l tell you?

1939
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:51,587
l was the director
for all the past episodes.

1940
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:56,635
l was afraid that Lord yama
and you will beat me up.

1941
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:59,638
lf we were on earth
l would have fed you to the dogs.

1942
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,067
But l won't do that now
because...

1943
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:03,666
...you got me a superb
marriage proposal...

1944
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:06,780
...that no marriage
bureau could've offered.

1945
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:10,241
lf you want to be totally free
you've to do me a favor.

1946
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:11,640
What is that?

1947
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:13,117
you have to tell me
where my yamaja is.

1948
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,312
l don't have another option.

1949
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:18,992
Lord yama hid his daughter
in his own weapon...

1950
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:22,460
...so that nobody can
see her or bring her out.

1951
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:26,063
Oh God! He looks
like a malnourished man.

1952
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,132
But he is very intelligent.

1953
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,733
ls there no way
l can meet yamaja?

1954
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:32,237
- There are two ways.
-What are they?

1955
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:35,467
Option one, you go in
Option two, she comes out.

1956
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,406
That's so foolish.

1957
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:39,240
l need herfather's entry
pass for both the options.

1958
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:42,280
ou don't need a pass
if you attack on his weakness.

1959
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,145
Really? What is that weakness?

1960
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:47,419
Lord! This sinner's
name is Mrs. Kanya.

1961
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:50,490
She trapped many
rich men with her beauty...

1962
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:53,751
...made videos of their
ljustful activities with her...

1963
01:33:53,894 --> 01:33:56,021
...and looted them
of all their wealth.

1964
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,293
lt is not wrong to give her
the severest of punishments.

1965
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:02,027
Send herto heaven
without any punishment.

1966
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:02,795
Lord?

1967
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,463
She gave heavenly
pleasures to many men.

1968
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,370
lt is only fair
to send her to heaven.

1969
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:11,043
She did business with
her body to gain profits.

1970
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:12,342
That is fair.

1971
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,004
The law changes for ladies.

1972
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:17,914
Send herto my room
before sending her to heaven.

1973
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:18,781
For what?

1974
01:34:18,886 --> 01:34:21,286
l need to teach her
some important things.

1975
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:25,792
Wow! Travelling on the buffalo
made him like one.

1976
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:29,253
l'll become a female
to play with your weakness.

1977
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:31,126
Mr. Narada, dress change.

1978
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,568
Chitragupta!

1979
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:40,434
l can see golden pumpkins
behind those bushes.

1980
01:34:40,641 --> 01:34:42,199
They are not pumpkins...

1981
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:46,575
She is a beautiful young woman.

1982
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,479
No, Chittu! She's a big woman.

1983
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:55,749
Hey, when l am walking in the street
with flowers in hair bun, finger on my cheeks

1984
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:57,753
Kevvuu Kekaa

1985
01:34:57,925 --> 01:35:01,224
The entire street is going crazy

1986
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,464
Lord, she's hot.

1987
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:08,260
Who are you looking for?

1988
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:12,895
l'm looking for a thief
who stole an important part.

1989
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:15,803
Who is that thief?

1990
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:18,309
Lord yama!

1991
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:22,776
- Lord yama? ls he a thief?
- Hey!

1992
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:24,644
Don't you know him?

1993
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:28,050
l know him very well
When he robbed my heart...

1994
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:30,019
...l captured his image in my eyes...

1995
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:33,888
...and stored it in
all the parts of my body.

1996
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:37,489
When did that disgjusting
incident take place?

1997
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:38,689
ln my dreams.

1998
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,801
Why didn't you recognize him
when he's right before you?

1999
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:42,664
No, he's not that man.

2000
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:45,297
Since her eyes were
closed while dreaming...

2001
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:46,428
...she is not able to recognize me.

2002
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:50,010
No. just like the three
faced lion on one rupee coin...

2003
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:51,542
...l remember his face very well.

2004
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:57,174
He looks like NTRwith thick
curly hair in a well fitted suit.

2005
01:35:57,284 --> 01:36:01,516
Beauty! Don't worry
l'll fulfill your desire.

2006
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:03,555
No, you can't satisfy me.

2007
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:06,090
l meant that
l'll fulfill your desire...

2008
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:08,625
...by sending Lord yama to you.

2009
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:12,122
l'm so happy to hearthat.

2010
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:15,928
Come to my garden
at the same time tomorrow.

2011
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:17,094
Okay.

2012
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:19,036
Forget him, come to
my guesthouse...

2013
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,870
- Chitragupta!
- l'm coming.

2014
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:27,047
Notjjust on earth
even here women have no freedom.

2015
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:36,252
Do l look like NTR in this getup?

2016
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:38,219
Why to compare him with you?

2017
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:41,123
yes, l'm incomparable.

2018
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:42,455
ou understood it that way?

2019
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:45,325
es. Chittu no one
should knowthis secret.

2020
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:46,990
The secret about this suit?

2021
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:51,002
No, my encounter
with that beauty.

2022
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:52,066
Oh!

2023
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:57,304
- Will my Sir come searching me?
- He'll definitely come

2024
01:36:57,411 --> 01:37:01,871
- Will he give me his heart?
- He'll give me undoubtedly

2025
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:07,082
- Will my Sir come searching me?
- He'll definitely come

2026
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:08,348
- Chitragupta!
-es?

2027
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:11,720
- Go and hide behind those bushes.
-What about you?

2028
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:14,124
l'll impress that
beauty with my words.

2029
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:15,195
l'll measure her with my eyes.

2030
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:16,524
l'll embrace her in my arms and...

2031
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:17,494
Go ahead.

2032
01:37:17,932 --> 01:37:19,160
- Lord!
-es?

2033
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:21,860
lf you permit me,
even l want to do that.

2034
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:24,028
No! Only yama!

2035
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:28,537
Come, father! l'll make you
dance with my beauty.

2036
01:37:28,943 --> 01:37:30,001
Priya!

2037
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:31,202
That same voice.

2038
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:33,337
He had that same disgjusting
voice earlier as well.

2039
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,813
Darling, l'm here.

2040
01:37:40,721 --> 01:37:42,279
He's afraid that she'll fall for me.

2041
01:37:42,423 --> 01:37:44,550
What's the matter, darling?

2042
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:48,920
When l saw my dream
man before my eyes...

2043
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:51,497
...l lost control
of myself and fainted.

2044
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,624
What did you say?

2045
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:57,292
Since you desire me
l left everything behind...

2046
01:37:57,404 --> 01:38:00,862
...and came to you
to fulfill your desires.

2047
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:03,441
l hope l won't get pregnant.

2048
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,569
No way. He got a vasectomy.

2049
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,340
Nothing will happen to you, Priya.

2050
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:08,971
My name is not Priya.

2051
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,744
l forgot to ask your name.

2052
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,443
Because you were filled with ljust.

2053
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:15,113
-What is your name?
- Katrina Kaif.

2054
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:19,249
Notjjust your body
even your name is so beautiful.

2055
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:21,286
Naughty boy!

2056
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,054
Wow!

2057
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,493
- Darling!
- Naughty!

2058
01:38:23,597 --> 01:38:25,588
l think he'll
get tired with all the running.

2059
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:28,828
Wife on one side
Kaif on the other side.

2060
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:29,992
Lord! Stop!

2061
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:31,002
l can't stop.

2062
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:32,127
l said stop!

2063
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,572
Chitragupta!

2064
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:36,666
l didn't mean
to disrespect you, Lord.

2065
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:38,745
our wife is coming this way.

2066
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:41,845
Kaif! Go quickly and hide.

2067
01:38:41,949 --> 01:38:43,940
- Shall l hide here?
- No.

2068
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,052
Are there no rooms here?

2069
01:38:46,153 --> 01:38:48,348
This weapon is the right place.

2070
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:49,183
What are you saying?

2071
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,951
l'll suffocate to death inside that.

2072
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:53,582
Kaif, jjust see what l can do.

2073
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,096
Oh God!

2074
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:08,102
The exterior was jjust
one meter and a half.

2075
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:10,107
But the interior
is one kilometer long.

2076
01:39:10,244 --> 01:39:11,609
Where will l search for my yamaja?

2077
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:12,575
Aiyo!

2078
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:13,947
Who are you?

2079
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:15,548
How dare you address
me as my husband?

2080
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:17,173
ou'll turn to ashes if l curse you.

2081
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:21,048
Aiyo! l'm your husband
look carefully.

2082
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:24,824
What is this getup, my Lord?

2083
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,395
l got to knowthat a sinner
escaped from prison.

2084
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:31,588
So l came in this disguise
to catch him. That's it.

2085
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:34,598
Why did you come here at this hour?

2086
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:36,134
What kind of a question is that?

2087
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:38,101
ou sent a messenger
and asked me to come here.

2088
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:39,967
Me? Oh, yes!

2089
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:43,334
l felt that l was neglecting you
because of my duties.

2090
01:39:43,444 --> 01:39:47,574
So, l planned to
spend this day with you.

2091
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:56,320
l found you.

2092
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:00,588
Hi!

2093
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:02,286
Who are you?

2094
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:04,125
l'm your lover's lover.

2095
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:07,667
He came to this world foryou
but l came for him.

2096
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:09,292
Stop it! He is my husband.

2097
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:11,132
l'm his future wife.

2098
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:11,932
What did you say?

2099
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:15,805
lf you say yes

2100
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:17,874
What? ou with my husband?

2101
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:18,944

01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,439
What is this disgjusting getup?

2103
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:24,011
- Don't l look good?
- No.

2104
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:56,477
You're the Man of courage and caliber
This flowery beauty is yours, accept it

2105
01:40:56,583 --> 01:41:05,855
You are the star in the sky and flow of love
Pleasantries arrive, come and join me

2106
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:10,589
Taste the nectar, oh honey-bee!

2107
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:23,335
To fulflll the desires in me
l'll come and join with you

2108
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:33,681
You're the Man of courage and caliber
This flowery beauty is yours, accept it

2109
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:36,950
Oh my star!

2110
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:05,176
Getting aroused by the feelings
The beauty found its company

2111
01:42:07,254 --> 01:42:12,886
Making love with you slowly
Will take you to the magic world

2112
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:19,997
Getting aroused by the feelings
The beauty found its company

01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:25,663
Making love with you slowly
Will take you to the magic world

2114
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:33,042
Luck knocks at the door of mine
l'll come and join as your pair

2115
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:37,912
l crossed the limits of the world
You are my breath of life

2116
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:42,488
Oh my dear...!

2117
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:51,930
You're the Man of courage and caliber
This flowery beauty is yours, accept it

2118
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:55,627
Oh my star!

2119
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:23,294
Don't know why my mind gets disturbed

2120
01:43:25,499 --> 01:43:31,404
Sorrow...anger...wrath
Would lose them with my hug

2121
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:38,243
Don't know why my mind gets disturbed

2122
01:43:38,345 --> 01:43:43,840
Sorrow...anger...wrath
Would lose them with my hug

2123
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:51,514
The dame is ready
For the game is about to start

2124
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:56,152
Come, my beloved!
l'll get rid of your sorrows

2125
01:43:57,197 --> 01:44:01,099
My mind and body fly on high
Never experience this before

2126
01:44:04,137 --> 01:44:08,699
The festival day has come
l was waiting so long

2127
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:16,678
l am a pious girl; have only your thoughts
and admire only you in my mind

2128
01:44:18,986 --> 01:44:24,014
l'll stay in you as the moon-light
And bring the joy and happiness

2129
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:31,261
l'll be your better half,
and live many a births

2130
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,264
- Chitragupta!
-Wait a minute.

2131
01:44:43,176 --> 01:44:44,165
Narayana!

2132
01:44:44,378 --> 01:44:45,743
Narada! ou?

2133
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,948
How is Lord's romance?

2134
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:54,653
This couple looks so
good in different postures.

2135
01:44:54,821 --> 01:44:57,016
lf an older couple
can be so romantic...

2136
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:58,785
...l'm sure the younger
couple inside the weapon...

2137
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:00,450
...mjust've crossed all their limits.

2138
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,959
The younger couple
inside the weapon?

2139
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:03,960
But they both are women.

2140
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:08,358
ou don't have to
bite your tongue or nose.

2141
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,227
l know everything.

2142
01:45:10,404 --> 01:45:11,462
you know it?

2143
01:45:11,705 --> 01:45:15,106
Does that mean
that Lord is in trouble?

2144
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:17,506
The trouble has jjust started.

2145
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,738
The person inside the weapon is...

2146
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:22,178
...not a young woman that
caught Lord's attention.

2147
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:24,244
That person is the human
that yamaja loves.

2148
01:45:24,418 --> 01:45:25,680
The one that will
teach your Lord a lesson.

2149
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:28,379
The one inside is not Katrina?

2150
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:29,682
No, it's him.

2151
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:33,417
As soon as your Lord sees a sari...

2152
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:35,356
...he pounces to embrace
it without checking...

2153
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:37,019
...if it's really a female or a male.

2154
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:40,893
That human is with
yamaja inside the weapon.

2155
01:45:42,035 --> 01:45:45,027
- Really?
- Lord!

2156
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:46,671
Are you out of your mind?

2157
01:45:46,807 --> 01:45:48,138
lf you'll lose your mind
after hearing this.

2158
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:50,471
The one inside is
not Katrina it's him.

2159
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:52,071
Lord, what's the matter?

2160
01:45:52,312 --> 01:45:53,574
Dear, you go home.

2161
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,375
l have information
about that sinner.

2162
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:57,211
l need to go and punish him.

2163
01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:02,746
Hey, Human!

2164
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:05,556
l think yourfather knoWS.

2165
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:07,021
What is it, father?

2166
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:09,095
Did you go into a shock
when you found out that l'm here?

2167
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:11,254
ou could go inside by fooling me.

2168
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,992
But you cannot come out.

2169
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:15,795
ou are proud thinking
that you've captured me.

2170
01:46:15,902 --> 01:46:18,598
But you are forgetting
that l'm in your daughter's arms.

2171
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:21,572
We didn't go to honeymoon
after our wedding.

2172
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:23,232
My body is craving for her.

2173
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,811
Lord, he is a man full of desires.

2174
01:46:26,146 --> 01:46:30,606
He'll get to work and make
you a grandfather very soon.

2175
01:46:30,984 --> 01:46:34,215
l mean, even your daughter
doesn't seem to mind.

2176
01:46:34,354 --> 01:46:37,221
lt would be better
to bring them out.

2177
01:46:41,962 --> 01:46:43,554
Father, do you know something?

2178
01:46:43,697 --> 01:46:44,891
Love is like a lucky draw.

2179
01:46:45,031 --> 01:46:46,157
Not everyone gets it.

2180
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:47,927
But you can't stop
someone from getting it.

2181
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:51,070
So stop your nonsense
book a grand function hall...

2182
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:52,900
...and arrange for a marriage
reception party for us.

2183
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:54,666
All the worlds will
applaud both of us...

2184
01:46:54,808 --> 01:46:56,435
...you for making me
your son-in-law...

2185
01:46:56,676 --> 01:46:59,042
...and me for marrying
your daughter.

2186
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:00,373
Hey, l'm yama!

2187
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,003
l'm Naresh!

2188
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:01,978
l'm Chitragupta!

2189
01:47:02,115 --> 01:47:03,309
Enough of the stupid
introductions.

2190
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:05,044
ours is not love, it is deception.

2191
01:47:05,152 --> 01:47:07,552
Don't be so happy because
you've won with deception.

2192
01:47:07,654 --> 01:47:10,282
ou'll be ruined because
l'll win tomorrow!

2193
01:47:10,557 --> 01:47:13,526
l heard you
Now l'll give you a super challenge.

2194
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,524
ou will agree that
my love is true love.

2195
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:19,130
ou will give
your daughter's hand to me.

2196
01:47:19,332 --> 01:47:21,664
ou will wash my feet.
That's a challenge.

2197
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:23,064
That won't happen even if l die.

2198
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:24,569
ou don't die, you kill others.

2199
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:25,603
Hey, no logic.

2200
01:47:25,705 --> 01:47:27,536
l won't let that happen at any cost.

2201
01:47:27,674 --> 01:47:30,165
lt will definitely happen.

2202
01:47:32,879 --> 01:47:34,346
Why did you bring me here?

2203
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:35,710
Are you going to whip me again?

2204
01:47:35,816 --> 01:47:36,840
We'll show you a cricket match.

2205
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,611
Cricket? l want to play.

2206
01:47:38,752 --> 01:47:39,776
Our Lord will play with you.

2207
01:47:39,886 --> 01:47:42,514
No one ever won a match against me.

2208
01:47:42,656 --> 01:47:44,351
Our Lord has never lost a match.

2209
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,288
What's the bet?

2210
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:48,861
lf you win, you can go back
to earth and be with your wife.

2211
01:47:48,995 --> 01:47:51,088
l like that. What if l lose?

2212
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:53,029
l'll go to earth and...

2213
01:47:53,433 --> 01:47:54,957
Shut up! That's impossible!

2214
01:47:55,068 --> 01:47:56,000
l won't lose even if l die.

2215
01:47:56,169 --> 01:47:57,227
you came here after dying.

2216
01:47:57,838 --> 01:48:01,274
The Earth should, defeat yama's World.

2217
01:48:07,013 --> 01:48:09,140
What is he doing?
How can he sit and bat?

2218
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,408
That's the style of our Lord.

2219
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:13,849
Last time he batted while crawling.

2220
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:14,954
Wow!

2221
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:19,715
That is yamaganda!

2222
01:48:21,428 --> 01:48:23,225
Catch the ball!

2223
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:30,334
That's cheating!

2224
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:31,801
That's the style of our Lord.

2225
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:34,270
He is like a bull in
form and his bat is flexible.

2226
01:48:34,407 --> 01:48:35,704
l condemn this rubbish game.

2227
01:48:35,809 --> 01:48:37,037
A bat should be like a bat.

2228
01:48:37,143 --> 01:48:38,371
- Okay
- Ball, please.

2229
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:39,410
Thank you.

2230
01:48:40,247 --> 01:48:41,111
Stop!

2231
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:46,778
Why should l get up forthis?
l'll sit and bat.

2232
01:48:48,088 --> 01:48:49,783
l got it. l got it.

2233
01:48:52,492 --> 01:48:54,892
Wickets! Come to me.

2234
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:57,686
Run! Run!

2235
01:48:57,831 --> 01:48:58,661
Run! Run!

2236
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:05,732
What is this nonsense?
l won't catch the ball!

2237
01:49:05,839 --> 01:49:06,999
Oh God!

2238
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:10,937
25,000 runs?

2239
01:49:11,144 --> 01:49:13,704
Sachin Tendulkar can't
make so many runs...

2240
01:49:13,813 --> 01:49:14,905
...even if he plays
throughout his life.

2241
01:49:15,015 --> 01:49:16,846
Chittu! The poor man is discouraged.

2242
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:18,280
l'll declare the innings.

2243
01:49:18,418 --> 01:49:21,581
What? He talks as if he
played a gentleman's game.

2244
01:49:21,688 --> 01:49:24,156
What bowling do you want?
Fast or spin?

2245
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:26,158
He can't run fast with his body.

2246
01:49:26,326 --> 01:49:27,691
l want fast.

2247
01:49:40,607 --> 01:49:42,438
How can you bowl
sitting on the buffalo?

2248
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:43,634
That's the style of our Lord.

2249
01:49:43,777 --> 01:49:44,903
l can't handle that much speed.

2250
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:46,342
Then l'll throw a spin

2251
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:47,470
That's better.

2252
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:51,747
Why is he coming in
a palanquin like a bride?

2253
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,681
Why is the ball jumping
this side and that side?

2254
01:49:56,056 --> 01:49:57,080
Oh God!

2255
01:49:59,059 --> 01:50:00,993
ou are finished!

2256
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:05,195
Lord! Lord!

2257
01:50:05,298 --> 01:50:06,026
es?

2258
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:08,498
lt's time to punish the sinners.

2259
01:50:08,768 --> 01:50:11,464
Even this crown feels
heavy because of that human.

2260
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,199
Why worry about it?
Keep the crown at home...

2261
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:15,069
Chitragupta!

2262
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:18,768
our weird behavior shoWS
that you are scared of him.

2263
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:21,005
No! l'm jjust being careful.

2264
01:50:21,147 --> 01:50:22,774
They both mean the same.

2265
01:50:22,882 --> 01:50:25,510
lf you think about him
and stay back...

2266
01:50:25,652 --> 01:50:29,782
...the queue of sinners
will stretch to the other worlds.

2267
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:32,788
l should make sure that the human...

2268
01:50:32,993 --> 01:50:35,518
...doesn't come here in my absence.

2269
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:37,861
Son yamaganda!

2270
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:39,363
Greetings, father!

2271
01:50:39,499 --> 01:50:40,431
May you life forever!

2272
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,763
Son, l want to give you
a responsibility.

2273
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,968
Give it to me, father.

2274
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:46,595
He is stretching
his hands thinking that...

2275
01:50:46,706 --> 01:50:48,105
...responsibility is
some kind of eatable, Lord.

2276
01:50:48,241 --> 01:50:50,038
- ls it not?
- No!

2277
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:54,678
Don't worry, father.

2278
01:50:54,814 --> 01:50:56,805
Leave your worries with me.

2279
01:50:57,017 --> 01:50:58,882
lf he comes anywhere
nearthis house...

2280
01:50:59,019 --> 01:51:00,577
...l'll squeeze him with my hands...

2281
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,280
...and stamp him under
my legs and finish him off.

2282
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:05,221
Will you eat him as well?

2283
01:51:05,358 --> 01:51:08,293
That's my style
l'll eat anything to do my duty.

2284
01:51:08,428 --> 01:51:10,623
yamaganda, don't eat anything you see.

2285
01:51:13,466 --> 01:51:15,457
Father, what is this?
Non-vegetarian food?

2286
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:17,467
No, it's a fruit from earth.

2287
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:18,434
Afruit?

2288
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:20,667
-you should peel the skin before eating it.
- Okay.

2289
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:21,570
And you should throw this part.

2290
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:22,231
Okay.

2291
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:23,331
- Son!
-yes?

2292
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:24,342
Be careful of the human.

2293
01:51:24,444 --> 01:51:26,275
l'll take care of him father
Please go.

2294
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:32,951
What is it, Lord?
ls the crown irritating you again?

2295
01:51:33,153 --> 01:51:35,383
lt's not enough to give
this responsibility to yamaganda.

2296
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:38,184
We should know whether
he is doing it well or not.

2297
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:40,452
We'll know it
when that human comes.

2298
01:51:40,593 --> 01:51:44,529
l'll go to yamaganda
in that human's form to test him.

2299
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:53,839
This fruit doesn't taste so bad.

2300
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:56,940
Hey!

2301
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:00,838
Where are you going, human?

2302
01:52:01,014 --> 01:52:02,311
l know you very well.

2303
01:52:02,482 --> 01:52:04,450
Don't play your tricks with yamaganda.

2304
01:52:04,784 --> 01:52:06,376
Do you think l'm, a fool like my father...

2305
01:52:06,486 --> 01:52:08,818
...that you can
deceive, me and go inside?

2306
01:52:09,522 --> 01:52:11,581
l'm afraid of yourfather, not you.

2307
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,620
Do you know something?

2308
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:16,388
My father is scared of me.

2309
01:52:17,497 --> 01:52:19,692
l'm warning you to turn back.

2310
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:21,460
Otherwise l'll use my weapon,
and bury you in the wall.

2311
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,092
No, l'll go back.

2312
01:52:23,436 --> 01:52:25,097
ou should be afraid of me.

2313
01:52:26,539 --> 01:52:27,506
Oh God!

2314
01:52:31,678 --> 01:52:32,542
Father!

2315
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:33,771
Please forgive me, father.

2316
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,472
l threwthat peel as
l didn't know it was you.

2317
01:52:35,615 --> 01:52:36,673
He has broken bones.

2318
01:52:36,783 --> 01:52:37,408
Hey!

2319
01:52:37,684 --> 01:52:39,481
Son, l'm proud of you.

2320
01:52:39,619 --> 01:52:41,450
Why? Because you had a fall?

2321
01:52:41,554 --> 01:52:45,888
No, l'm proud of the way
he handled his responsibility.

2322
01:52:45,992 --> 01:52:49,928
l'm very proud to be his father.

2323
01:52:50,063 --> 01:52:52,998
Now l can fulfill
my duties with courage.

2324
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:54,589
Chitragupta, come.

2325
01:52:57,604 --> 01:53:00,539
Father, you are a clever man.

2326
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:03,233
But l know how to deal with you.

2327
01:53:04,477 --> 01:53:05,273
Wait!

2328
01:53:06,045 --> 01:53:07,979
Son, didn't you recognize me?

2329
01:53:08,114 --> 01:53:10,014
Of course l recognized you, father.

2330
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:12,118
Why did you come back so early?
Did you finish the meeting?

2331
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:13,412
No, my heart is broken.

2332
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,784
Did you come to test me again?

2333
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:17,747
l have faith in you.

2334
01:53:18,024 --> 01:53:20,458
l came here because
l doubt your mother and sister.

2335
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,424
Father!

2336
01:53:21,528 --> 01:53:25,259
ou fool! l didn't mean that doubt
Slap yourself.

2337
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:27,228
l came in that human's form to test...

2338
01:53:27,433 --> 01:53:29,594
...whetherthey are
as strong as you.

2339
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:30,999
Please go ahead.

2340
01:53:31,171 --> 01:53:31,933
Thanks, brother.

2341
01:53:32,172 --> 01:53:32,831
Wait!

2342
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:34,131
What did you say?

2343
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:36,468
l'm in that human's form now.

2344
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:39,568
That's right
Please go inside. Wait!

2345
01:53:42,682 --> 01:53:43,307
The peel.

2346
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:44,508
l want your sister.

2347
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:45,515
Why did he say that?

2348
01:53:45,618 --> 01:53:46,676
Narayana!

2349
01:53:46,853 --> 01:53:48,286
What is it, troublemaker?

2350
01:53:48,521 --> 01:53:50,751
Narada, why are you here?

2351
01:53:50,957 --> 01:53:53,585
l came here to give you
some important information.

2352
01:53:53,726 --> 01:53:54,818
l won't listen to you.

2353
01:53:55,295 --> 01:53:57,991
our wish
No one can save yourfamily.

2354
01:53:58,097 --> 01:53:59,359
Wait a minute.

2355
01:53:59,465 --> 01:54:00,796
What's the matter? Tell me.

2356
01:54:00,934 --> 01:54:02,196
l won't tell you
l'm not in the mood now.

2357
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:03,700
Please tell me, Narada.

2358
01:54:04,037 --> 01:54:06,699
l will tell you
because l still respect you.

2359
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:12,037
That human is making
your fears come true.

2360
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:31,686
Husband!

2361
01:54:35,268 --> 01:54:39,204
Son, that musical
instrument is very good.

2362
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:43,172
l've heard a variety
of flutes and trumpets before.

2363
01:54:43,309 --> 01:54:44,901
But l've never seen this one.

2364
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:46,102
lt's a mouth organ, mother.

2365
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:47,201
lt's a musical instrument that has...

2366
01:54:47,347 --> 01:54:48,939
...romantic heroism on our earth.

2367
01:54:49,249 --> 01:54:51,581
Heroes like us impress
heroines like you with this.

2368
01:54:51,684 --> 01:54:53,777
Teach me how to play that organ.

2369
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:55,582
- Me too.
- Okay.

2370
01:54:55,688 --> 01:54:58,054
l'll teach you both
at the same time.

2371
01:54:58,725 --> 01:55:02,855
Lord, he is playing
with you and them as well.

2372
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:04,529
He is your son-in-law after all.

2373
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:48,231
Oh my aunt! Daughter of aunt!
Am ready to dance smoothly

2374
01:55:48,374 --> 01:55:54,574
Oh daughter of Yama!
Am ready to show my skills completely

2375
01:55:54,681 --> 01:55:57,445
The mother exhajusted with her movements

2376
01:55:57,884 --> 01:56:00,717
But the daughter yearns for more

2377
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:04,649
Love the pleasure of both their company

2378
01:56:07,393 --> 01:56:13,730
Oh my aunt! Daughter of aunt!
Am ready to dance smoothly

2379
01:56:13,833 --> 01:56:19,999
Oh daughter of Yama!
Am ready to show my skills completely

2380
01:56:47,934 --> 01:56:50,596
Make the fete here

2381
01:56:51,604 --> 01:56:57,873
Make me scream, you naughty!
Defeat me deftly!

2382
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:02,414
l'll offer you all my beauty, my beau!

2383
01:57:10,556 --> 01:57:16,654
Mesmerise us, oh man!
Make us lose control, my boy!

2384
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:20,865
Oh admirer of love!
Come and delight us

2385
01:57:23,169 --> 01:57:25,797
Seeing gorgeous aunt's beauty
my mind sings ringa ringa

2386
01:57:25,905 --> 01:57:29,238
Sensing scented daughter's beauty
My mind craves for her love

2387
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:34,075
You are the suitable son-in-law
to this aunt

2388
01:57:35,782 --> 01:57:41,880
Oh my aunt! Daughter of aunt!
Am ready to dance smoothly

2389
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:48,325
Oh daughter of Yama!
Am ready to show my skills completely

2390
01:58:13,519 --> 01:58:19,788
Oh son-in-law! Your pinching provokes me
Progress without any delay

2391
01:58:20,026 --> 01:58:23,587
Be as my pet for long
l'll satisfy your needs...go

2392
01:58:23,696 --> 01:58:24,788
Okay...that's it!

2393
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:32,367
Show me your skills

2394
01:58:32,672 --> 01:58:38,804
Oh my aunt! Give me something
lt should churn my heart

2395
01:58:39,011 --> 01:58:42,503
You are still attractive

2396
01:58:42,648 --> 01:58:43,706
Don't flatter me

2397
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:51,317
Play the game, hunt the beauty
Don't hesitate, enjoy me fully

2398
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:56,554
l'll make you climb the nuptial bed

2399
01:58:56,929 --> 01:58:57,725
Chitragupta!

2400
01:58:59,232 --> 01:59:00,756
l thought it was her.

2401
01:59:00,933 --> 01:59:02,764
l jjust can't forget
that song and dance.

2402
01:59:02,935 --> 01:59:05,733
Notjjust you
even l can't forget it.

2403
01:59:05,872 --> 01:59:07,066
Madam danced so well.

2404
01:59:07,206 --> 01:59:08,468
Chitragupta!

2405
01:59:08,674 --> 01:59:09,333
yes, Lord?

2406
01:59:09,442 --> 01:59:12,172
Give me that drink
My head is hot with anger.

2407
01:59:12,311 --> 01:59:15,337
That drink won't work
if your head is hot with anger.

2408
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:16,278
So, l got this.

2409
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:17,107
What is that?

2410
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:20,515
lmported scotch whisky from earth.

2411
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:23,453
We can forget our
worries if we drink this.

2412
01:59:23,589 --> 01:59:26,080
We can even trouble
the people that depend on us.

2413
01:59:26,192 --> 01:59:27,716
Even you have a drink.

2414
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:31,126
How can l drink before you?

2415
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:34,162
Respect me before others
not before a drink.

2416
01:59:34,267 --> 01:59:35,234
Go ahead.

2417
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:36,763
ou are kind.

2418
01:59:36,869 --> 01:59:40,361
l have devotion foryou.

2419
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:44,068
l have respect foryou.

2420
01:59:44,377 --> 01:59:47,073
l have hatred for you.

2421
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:48,112
Hey!

2422
01:59:49,582 --> 01:59:51,516
-yama!
-yama?

2423
01:59:51,617 --> 01:59:55,383
ou forgot me, the man beside you...

2424
01:59:55,488 --> 01:59:59,117
...and gave a human
the chance to defeat you.

2425
01:59:59,225 --> 02:00:00,385
Pathetic man!

2426
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:01,755
Do you know whom you are talking to?

2427
02:00:02,328 --> 02:00:05,695
Shut up! What is
so great about you?

2428
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:06,798
He is drunk.

2429
02:00:06,933 --> 02:00:11,893
A genius like me should
get your drinks in secret?

2430
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:14,836
Should l get you
the woman you desire?

2431
02:00:15,107 --> 02:00:20,807
lf l sit on that throne
l won't have figures to punish you.

2432
02:00:21,614 --> 02:00:23,411
Where is the drink?
Did you finish it?

2433
02:00:23,549 --> 02:00:24,641
The drink is finished.

2434
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:28,208
Did l ever answeryour
questions in that manner?

2435
02:00:28,321 --> 02:00:30,482
l poured you another drink. Come on.

2436
02:00:32,124 --> 02:00:35,355
Oh God! l unnecessarily
messed with that fat fellow.

2437
02:00:35,528 --> 02:00:38,691
lf l get caught
he'll show me hell in his own style.

2438
02:00:39,165 --> 02:00:41,599
lt's better to hide here
No one can find me here.

2439
02:00:41,734 --> 02:00:44,726
Tell me what you did for me.

2440
02:00:44,937 --> 02:00:48,839
Because you ill-treated me
a human called Naresh...

2441
02:00:48,975 --> 02:00:54,607
...came from earth to
deal with you and yourfamily.

2442
02:00:55,014 --> 02:00:58,711
He doesn't know that
he has no destiny yet.

2443
02:00:59,118 --> 02:01:04,112
lf he finds out that
he has the same powers as you...

2444
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:06,451
...you'll be completely ruined.

2445
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:11,621
ou and yourfamily will
have to bearthe consequences.

2446
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:17,030
-What? l have the powers of Gods?
-es.

2447
02:01:17,136 --> 02:01:18,467
Anything l say will be fulfilled?

2448
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:20,434
l'm trying to fool, my father-in-law...

2449
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:21,471
...and you are trying
to fool me in turn.

2450
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:23,370
just use your logic
and think about it.

2451
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:24,966
Even though you are
messing with Lord yama...

2452
02:01:25,077 --> 02:01:28,706
...he's not able to do anything
What's the reason?

2453
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:35,779
Think deeper. How could
you come here before dying?

2454
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:36,377
Because of my love.

2455
02:01:36,489 --> 02:01:39,856
That happens only in the movies
This is real life.

2456
02:01:40,059 --> 02:01:41,856
ou can test it to confirm it.

2457
02:01:41,994 --> 02:01:45,088
Command me to go back to earth
See if l go.

2458
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:48,128
Go back to earth.

2459
02:01:51,837 --> 02:01:55,898
Notjjust your mouth
even my brain has power.

2460
02:01:56,108 --> 02:01:58,099
Silk, it's been so long
since l saw you last.

2461
02:01:58,210 --> 02:02:00,337
Adorn your hair with
jasmines and be ready for me.

2462
02:02:00,846 --> 02:02:01,642
Come up.

2463
02:02:03,783 --> 02:02:05,774
Why am l going up again?

2464
02:02:07,253 --> 02:02:08,652
Why did l come here again?

2465
02:02:08,788 --> 02:02:09,447
Naughty boy!

2466
02:02:09,555 --> 02:02:11,113
Can't l bring you up
if l can send you down?

2467
02:02:11,223 --> 02:02:11,655
That's correct.

2468
02:02:11,757 --> 02:02:13,054
Since you gave me such great news...

2469
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:14,126
...you have to see my next step.

2470
02:02:14,226 --> 02:02:15,386
Another step?

2471
02:02:15,661 --> 02:02:19,028
Father, wait and watch
how l'll trouble you.

2472
02:02:19,365 --> 02:02:21,060
Lord, l think l got drunk and...

2473
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:22,759
...spoke disrespectfully
to you last night.

2474
02:02:22,902 --> 02:02:23,698
yes, you...

2475
02:02:23,903 --> 02:02:26,269
No, you didn't open
your mouth at all.

2476
02:02:26,505 --> 02:02:28,632
- But l think...
- Not at all.

2477
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:30,868
- l can't remember.
- There's nothing.

2478
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,773
- Please tell me, Lord.
- l will tell you.

2479
02:02:34,547 --> 02:02:36,208
Lord, you'll fall down.

2480
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:37,077
Hi, Moms!

2481
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:38,172
What will you say?

2482
02:02:38,317 --> 02:02:39,306
He said he'll say something.

2483
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:41,352
Human, please tell me quickly.

2484
02:02:41,587 --> 02:02:43,521
l have equal powers with Gods.

2485
02:02:47,159 --> 02:02:48,456
l remembered.

2486
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:49,285
ou did, didn't you?

2487
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:50,987
Our drinks have the power
to filterthe lies...

2488
02:02:51,097 --> 02:02:52,121
...and bring out the truth.

2489
02:02:52,331 --> 02:02:55,357
lt made me say
without my own knowledge.

2490
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:56,298
Hey!

2491
02:02:56,502 --> 02:02:57,867
There's no use giving
him those looks.

2492
02:02:58,137 --> 02:03:00,230
lt only increases
your blood pressure, that's it.

2493
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:02,603
Now he knows
that he has your powers.

2494
02:03:02,742 --> 02:03:04,300
Darling! My darling wife!

2495
02:03:04,477 --> 02:03:05,466
Om yama!

2496
02:03:05,578 --> 02:03:07,045
Om Hero Honda!

2497
02:03:07,146 --> 02:03:08,875
yamaja darling! yami!

2498
02:03:09,482 --> 02:03:10,608
Husband!

2499
02:03:11,183 --> 02:03:12,741
Mother!

2500
02:03:13,052 --> 02:03:13,780
Son!

2501
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:14,784
- Lord!
-es?

2502
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:17,855
l thought he had only one wife
But even your wife...

2503
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:18,821
Even she...

2504
02:03:19,024 --> 02:03:19,922
Shut up!

2505
02:03:20,025 --> 02:03:20,889
Welcome, son!

2506
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:23,085
This house lit up with your arrival.

2507
02:03:23,329 --> 02:03:26,787
Hey, Human! Get out!

2508
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,360
Mother, he is asking me to get out.

2509
02:03:29,468 --> 02:03:32,767
lgnore him
Make yourself comfortable.

2510
02:03:32,938 --> 02:03:35,998
l will definitely teach him a lesson.

2511
02:03:36,175 --> 02:03:37,437
That's why l'm here.

2512
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:39,305
ou are very mischievous.

2513
02:03:39,412 --> 02:03:41,937
Mom, l like his mischievous nature.

2514
02:03:42,114 --> 02:03:43,706
Aiyo! Go inside.

2515
02:03:43,849 --> 02:03:46,044
Let's go, son
We'll talk while having food.

2516
02:03:46,152 --> 02:03:47,016
Okay.

2517
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:50,588
What is happening here?

2518
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:52,486
Why is he playing these games?

2519
02:03:53,125 --> 02:04:00,031
No matter how hard l try
l can't forget the humiliation.

2520
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:03,764
Am l a toy in that human's hands?

2521
02:04:04,136 --> 02:04:06,263
l'm the King of yama's World.

2522
02:04:07,106 --> 02:04:10,564
l'm God of Death
for humans aren't l?

2523
02:04:10,743 --> 02:04:18,616
How can l stand quietly
like some statue?

2524
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:22,683
Lord, tomorrow you'll have the powers...

2525
02:04:22,788 --> 02:04:25,313
...to put an end
to that human's drama.

2526
02:04:25,491 --> 02:04:27,857
So, please calm down today.

2527
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:30,785
Get your powers tomorrow.

2528
02:04:58,757 --> 02:04:59,519
Will you move aside?

2529
02:04:59,658 --> 02:05:02,218
Why? Will you clean
the throne with that cloth?

2530
02:05:02,361 --> 02:05:04,659
l put that there so that
l can sit on that throne.

2531
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:07,430
- Hey, l'm yama!
- This is a kerchief.

2532
02:05:07,666 --> 02:05:10,100
Whoever puts that in
the seat first should take that seat.

2533
02:05:10,236 --> 02:05:12,898
ou can ask our transport
system about its capacity.

2534
02:05:13,005 --> 02:05:15,405
This is not your government's
transport system.

2535
02:05:15,608 --> 02:05:16,836
This is the authority
of my government.

2536
02:05:16,976 --> 02:05:18,466
Today is an off foryour authority.

2537
02:05:18,611 --> 02:05:21,876
Because the seat and
the authority belong to me.

2538
02:05:32,725 --> 02:05:35,250
Lord, tomorrow
you'll have the powers...

2539
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:37,158
...to put an end
to that human's drama.

2540
02:05:37,563 --> 02:05:40,498
So, please calm down today.

2541
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:42,964
Get your powers tomorrow.

2542
02:05:43,135 --> 02:05:43,931
Gupta!

2543
02:05:44,069 --> 02:05:45,058
Did you call me, Lord?

2544
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:46,364
How do l look in this getup?

2545
02:05:46,505 --> 02:05:48,063
you look like
Lord yama on a diet.

2546
02:05:48,173 --> 02:05:50,698
Gupta! Shut up and sit down.

2547
02:05:50,809 --> 02:05:51,798
Chitragupta!

2548
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:55,276
lt's no use talking after
the high command's orders.

2549
02:05:55,481 --> 02:05:58,006
Here kerchiefs and
seats have more value.

2550
02:05:58,217 --> 02:05:59,582
Well said, Gupta.

2551
02:05:59,718 --> 02:06:01,879
Read the cases
l'll give ultimate tips.

2552
02:06:02,054 --> 02:06:03,521
His name is Siddharta.

2553
02:06:03,656 --> 02:06:05,920
He put his head
on the railway tracks.

2554
02:06:06,025 --> 02:06:06,957
What's the matter, brother?

2555
02:06:07,159 --> 02:06:09,059
My girlfriend's dad
is getting her married...

2556
02:06:09,161 --> 02:06:10,150
...to someone else tomorrow.

2557
02:06:10,262 --> 02:06:12,321
So you died today and came here?

2558
02:06:12,531 --> 02:06:14,123
lsn't eloping better than death?

2559
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:15,994
Look, brother!
ou died jjust once.

2560
02:06:16,135 --> 02:06:18,763
But that girl will die every day
in an unwanted marriage.

2561
02:06:18,871 --> 02:06:22,898
Go! Slap your father-in-law
if he stops you. Okay?

2562
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:24,607
lt's not enough to
have a heart to love.

2563
02:06:24,777 --> 02:06:27,041
ou need to have
the courage to win your love.

2564
02:06:27,346 --> 02:06:28,278
- Chitragupta!
-yes, Lord?

2565
02:06:28,414 --> 02:06:29,506
Send him down immediately.

2566
02:06:29,615 --> 02:06:31,014
- That's not possible
-Why not?

2567
02:06:31,116 --> 02:06:33,243
- Rules of the book
- Throw it in the bin.

2568
02:06:33,452 --> 02:06:35,079
you can go. Next.

2569
02:06:35,254 --> 02:06:39,315
A drunk driver killed these
school children with a truck.

2570
02:06:39,458 --> 02:06:41,585
yama! you are too much!

2571
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:43,885
lf you had killed that
drunk driver 5 minutes earlier...

2572
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:47,328
...these kids would've been
happily playing with parents.

2573
02:06:48,434 --> 02:06:50,595
Don't you care about their pain?

2574
02:06:50,736 --> 02:06:52,533
Don't you have mercy
or common sense?

2575
02:06:52,671 --> 02:06:55,401
Human, life and death
are decided by Creator.

2576
02:06:55,507 --> 02:06:57,737
That's enough. He writes
whatever comes to his mind.

2577
02:06:57,843 --> 02:06:59,811
And you guys go
and take their lives.

2578
02:07:00,112 --> 02:07:02,080
Why can't you give
equal lifespan to everyone?

2579
02:07:02,181 --> 02:07:03,671
Creator decides their
lifespan based on...

2580
02:07:03,782 --> 02:07:05,079
...their acts in
their previous lives.

2581
02:07:05,317 --> 02:07:07,285
Their previous lives?

2582
02:07:07,586 --> 02:07:09,110
ou destine that they
should do those mistakes.

2583
02:07:09,355 --> 02:07:11,050
And you kill them
for doing those mistakes.

2584
02:07:11,223 --> 02:07:13,350
ou are playing
cricket with our souls.

2585
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:14,517
This is what you do, right?

2586
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:16,352
Do you think
nobody will question you?

2587
02:07:16,528 --> 02:07:17,654
l'm giving you the answer.

2588
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:20,458
And that is, l'll give
100 years lifespan to everyone.

2589
02:07:20,566 --> 02:07:22,090
l'll dojjustice to my people.

2590
02:08:07,546 --> 02:08:10,379
l'm yama!

2591
02:08:14,353 --> 02:08:17,754
Human, what do you
know about destinies?

2592
02:08:17,956 --> 02:08:20,686
ln the first birth, everyone
is destined to a full lifespan...

2593
02:08:20,826 --> 02:08:23,317
...with complete knowledge

2594
02:08:23,662 --> 02:08:26,722
But humans selfishly
use that knowledge...

2595
02:08:26,865 --> 02:08:29,629
...to destroy the society
and commit sins.

2596
02:08:29,935 --> 02:08:31,869
Those sins become curses
for the next life...

2597
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:35,235
...and they get punished
in hell for committing them.

2598
02:08:35,641 --> 02:08:37,871
ou said it is wrong
to take the lives of children.

2599
02:08:38,243 --> 02:08:41,337
The sins of their parents
in their previous lives...

2600
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:42,970
...are responsible for
the deaths of these children.

2601
02:08:43,415 --> 02:08:45,042
ou know nothing
about these things...

2602
02:08:45,184 --> 02:08:46,708
...because you are a mere human.

2603
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:53,114
just because you have
equal powers with Gods...

2604
02:08:53,258 --> 02:08:57,126
...you became arrogant
and played games with me.

2605
02:08:57,396 --> 02:09:00,365
But today l'm more
powerful than you.

2606
02:09:01,366 --> 02:09:03,926
Even with all this power
l can't harm you.

2607
02:09:04,136 --> 02:09:06,661
ou have no death
as you have no destiny.

2608
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:13,277
But yourfather and
brother have destinies.

2609
02:09:14,346 --> 02:09:19,477
See what will happen to
your family in the next 3 days.

2610
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:26,789
See this as well.

2611
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:34,857
Did you see their destinies?

2612
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:38,160
They will meet their
deaths in the next 3 days.

2613
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:41,372
Lord yama! Please don't do that
l beg of you.

2614
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:45,738
Fool! lt's my duty
to fulfill destinies.

2615
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:50,314
ou cannot stop death
jjust as you cannot stop time.

2616
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:52,417
Please don't say that.

2617
02:09:52,684 --> 02:09:55,118
Only you have
the authority to stop death.

2618
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:57,650
My only mistake was
to fall in love with your daughter.

2619
02:09:57,956 --> 02:10:01,551
l'll kill my love for
your daughter right before you.

2620
02:10:04,563 --> 02:10:06,190
But please don't harm my family.

2621
02:10:06,632 --> 02:10:11,331
ou can take my life if you want.

2622
02:10:12,204 --> 02:10:13,967
As long as you have those powers...

2623
02:10:14,072 --> 02:10:16,006
...no one has the authority
to take your life.

2624
02:10:16,141 --> 02:10:18,939
l don't want any powers, Lord yama
Take them away.

2625
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:23,546
My father and brother
are the pillars of my family.

2626
02:10:23,949 --> 02:10:26,747
Please don't be unjjust
to my family by taking their lives.

2627
02:10:26,885 --> 02:10:30,412
l can only fulfill
the destinies that are written.

2628
02:10:30,656 --> 02:10:32,624
l don't have the authority
to change them.

2629
02:10:32,724 --> 02:10:36,683
l will save my family
Give me one chance, Lord yama.

2630
02:10:36,795 --> 02:10:38,626
ou have no powers now.

2631
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:40,958
ou can't do anything
even if you go back to earth.

2632
02:10:41,066 --> 02:10:43,125
lt's impossible to save them.

2633
02:10:43,268 --> 02:10:45,634
No, Lord! Since l know
what is going to happen...

2634
02:10:45,737 --> 02:10:47,796
...l'll save them by
not letting them go there.

2635
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:52,170
Give me 3 days time
Afterthat you can take my life.

2636
02:10:52,277 --> 02:10:55,940
Okay, l'll accept your request. Go.

2637
02:11:27,846 --> 02:11:29,074
Son...

2638
02:11:33,452 --> 02:11:36,387
What's wrong?
Why are you so worried?

2639
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:45,562
Son...

2640
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:47,962
Please forgive me
This is your world.

2641
02:11:48,433 --> 02:11:51,368
l came to a place
where no human can come.

2642
02:11:51,937 --> 02:11:55,896
But l'm still a human
l can never be equal to you.

2643
02:11:56,441 --> 02:11:58,875
That's why l'm leaving
this place forever.

2644
02:12:00,212 --> 02:12:01,907
Can you please call yamaja?

2645
02:12:02,414 --> 02:12:03,904
My mom believes that
f we see yamaja's face...

2646
02:12:04,016 --> 02:12:06,507
...before going anywhere
everything will be a success.

2647
02:12:07,419 --> 02:12:10,718
l should succeed
My mom's belief should come true.

2648
02:12:43,755 --> 02:12:45,120
l'll come with you.

2649
02:12:45,557 --> 02:12:46,785
ou can't come.

2650
02:12:46,858 --> 02:12:49,292
ou married me.
l'm your wife.

2651
02:12:49,394 --> 02:12:54,730
No! How can l get married
when l have no destiny?

2652
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,064
What do you mean?
Will you leave my hand?

2653
02:12:57,169 --> 02:12:59,103
My family is in your hands, yamaja.

2654
02:12:59,371 --> 02:13:02,204
l've to leave their
hands to hold your hand.

2655
02:13:02,541 --> 02:13:03,769
Should l leave them?

2656
02:13:06,745 --> 02:13:08,212
our hands tied a bundle
at the Goddess' temple...

2657
02:13:08,313 --> 02:13:09,678
...wishing for their welfare.

2658
02:13:09,915 --> 02:13:11,712
Can you wish badly forthem?

2659
02:13:15,887 --> 02:13:18,481
Since you got a taste
of their affection...

2660
02:13:18,557 --> 02:13:20,752
...you left my hand
to save them from harm.

2661
02:13:21,093 --> 02:13:24,221
l'm their son. What can l leave?

2662
02:13:24,363 --> 02:13:26,797
That's why l left my life.

2663
02:13:54,259 --> 02:13:55,487
Naresh!

2664
02:13:57,362 --> 02:13:58,852
Listen! Our son is here.

2665
02:13:58,997 --> 02:14:00,157
Our son is here?

2666
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,092
Where have you been all these days?

2667
02:14:03,201 --> 02:14:03,929
Actually...

2668
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:04,900
Why are you asking
him that question?

2669
02:14:05,003 --> 02:14:06,766
He mjust've gone to another
town for his dramas.

2670
02:14:07,005 --> 02:14:09,303
yes, dad. l finished the drama.

2671
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:11,740
Didn't it occur to you
that we'll worried about you?

2672
02:14:11,843 --> 02:14:14,277
He'll inform us only
when he has concern for us.

2673
02:14:14,513 --> 02:14:16,105
you were missing
from home for 10 days.

2674
02:14:16,248 --> 02:14:17,340
l wonder whether
you ate well or not.

2675
02:14:17,449 --> 02:14:19,110
Make his favorite dishes for him.

2676
02:14:19,284 --> 02:14:20,979
our exams are approaching.

2677
02:14:21,086 --> 02:14:23,316
lf you don't pass this time
you'll not get another chance.

2678
02:14:23,422 --> 02:14:24,480
The syllabus will change next year.

2679
02:14:24,556 --> 02:14:26,649
yes, dad. The syllabus will change.

2680
02:14:26,858 --> 02:14:28,382
This is my last examination.

2681
02:14:28,627 --> 02:14:30,322
Whatever is destined
will take place.

2682
02:14:31,296 --> 02:14:33,423
By the way
where is the servant girl?

2683
02:14:33,532 --> 02:14:36,023
She didn't come back
from the temple that day.

2684
02:14:36,334 --> 02:14:38,825
She won't come back, mom
Her father took her with him.

2685
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:46,177
Brother!

2686
02:14:46,645 --> 02:14:48,579
Hey, where were you all these days?

2687
02:14:48,647 --> 02:14:50,842
Forget that. Why are you worried?

2688
02:14:51,016 --> 02:14:52,074
No, l'm fine.

2689
02:14:52,250 --> 02:14:53,979
No, brother. Something is wrong.

2690
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:58,113
No. l was a bit worried
about you in your absence.

2691
02:14:58,857 --> 02:15:01,655
Brother, where are you wife and kids?

2692
02:15:01,793 --> 02:15:04,819
She went to see her parents
She'll come in 2 days.

2693
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:12,869
The shirt.

2694
02:15:13,672 --> 02:15:14,969
Light blue shirt.

2695
02:15:20,846 --> 02:15:23,314
l can't find my scooter keys
Where did you keep them?

2696
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:26,948
Where did you keep them?
Why can't l find them?

2697
02:15:27,018 --> 02:15:28,952
l kept them right here
but l can't find them now.

2698
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:29,987
Why did you come running?

2699
02:15:30,088 --> 02:15:32,750
Nothing, dad. ou said
you can't find the scooter keys.

2700
02:15:32,858 --> 02:15:34,291
yes, l can't find them.

2701
02:15:34,659 --> 02:15:35,785
l'm getting late for school.

2702
02:15:35,861 --> 02:15:37,089
Mom, you search there.

2703
02:15:38,196 --> 02:15:40,892
Okay, l'm getting late
l'll take the bus.

2704
02:15:41,266 --> 02:15:42,130
Goodbye, son.

2705
02:15:42,234 --> 02:15:44,794
Dad! ou should say,
l'll see you later.

2706
02:15:45,237 --> 02:15:47,501
- Okay, l'll see you later.
-yes.

2707
02:16:09,561 --> 02:16:10,585
Dad!

2708
02:16:12,597 --> 02:16:13,495
Oh God!

2709
02:16:13,598 --> 02:16:15,828
Dad! Look at me.

2710
02:16:15,934 --> 02:16:17,993
Father! What's wrong?

2711
02:16:18,103 --> 02:16:20,037
-What? ls he yourfather?
-yes.

2712
02:16:20,138 --> 02:16:21,571
Why did you commit
suicide from my bus?

2713
02:16:21,673 --> 02:16:22,503
Suicide?

2714
02:16:22,607 --> 02:16:24,097
yes, he jumped out of the bus.

2715
02:16:24,442 --> 02:16:25,841
Dad...

2716
02:16:26,378 --> 02:16:28,175
Why did you do that
foolish thing, dad?

2717
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:30,543
Why did you try to commit suicide?

2718
02:16:31,049 --> 02:16:32,482
Why did you do that, dad?

2719
02:16:33,318 --> 02:16:34,478
Because l'm a father.

2720
02:16:35,887 --> 02:16:40,756
Every father desires to see
their sons become capable.

2721
02:16:41,459 --> 02:16:44,451
Even l had that desire. But...

2722
02:16:45,864 --> 02:16:47,923
God didn't give me that chance.

2723
02:16:48,767 --> 02:16:51,099
ou are roaming around
without any responsibilities.

2724
02:16:51,236 --> 02:16:54,467
One of my eyes was
blinded long back.

2725
02:16:55,073 --> 02:16:56,540
But l didn't worry about it.

2726
02:16:56,942 --> 02:16:58,170
Do you know why?

2727
02:16:58,610 --> 02:17:01,636
l was happy to see
the world with one eye.

2728
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:03,571
That one eye is my older son.

2729
02:17:03,882 --> 02:17:06,442
l can't bear it if something
happens to that eye.

2730
02:17:06,551 --> 02:17:08,348
What are you talking about, dad?

2731
02:17:11,723 --> 02:17:13,520
Hey! What are you doing?

2732
02:17:13,592 --> 02:17:14,581
Leave me, dad.

2733
02:17:14,693 --> 02:17:15,557
Get down.

2734
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:17,093
l won't life, l'll die.

2735
02:17:17,195 --> 02:17:18,457
First get down.

2736
02:17:18,563 --> 02:17:19,962
lf something happens to you...

2737
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:21,828
How can we live if
something happens to you?

2738
02:17:21,933 --> 02:17:24,527
What is this foolishness?
Why are you doing this?

2739
02:17:24,769 --> 02:17:26,737
Look what happened.

2740
02:17:27,272 --> 02:17:28,830
How can you deceive the bank?

2741
02:17:28,974 --> 02:17:33,206
Royyala Naidu hates me
for sending him to prison.

2742
02:17:33,612 --> 02:17:37,708
The ones who applauded me
for my honesty in the bank...

2743
02:17:37,816 --> 02:17:41,343
...joined hands with Naidu
and forged some documents...

2744
02:17:41,453 --> 02:17:44,217
...to show a deficit of, 2.5 million
rupees in the bank.

2745
02:17:44,522 --> 02:17:48,788
They created strong
proof that l did that crime.

2746
02:17:49,094 --> 02:17:53,463
l can't prove my innocence, dad.

2747
02:17:53,565 --> 02:17:55,226
There are only two ways.

2748
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:58,597
l have to pay back
that money or go to prison.

2749
02:17:58,970 --> 02:18:02,599
l can't do any of them. So...

2750
02:18:03,475 --> 02:18:04,965
What brother did was wrong.

2751
02:18:05,076 --> 02:18:06,407
But did you do the right thing, dad?

2752
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:08,378
l know that it's not
the right thing.

2753
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:13,379
But l'll have to die so
that he gets the insurance money.

2754
02:18:14,185 --> 02:18:16,710
l sold our house but it
didn't fetch 2.5 million rupees.

2755
02:18:16,888 --> 02:18:18,515
We need another 300,000.

2756
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:21,486
Who will lend money
if we can't pay them back?

2757
02:18:21,826 --> 02:18:24,727
Don't worry, dad
l'll arrange that money.

2758
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:28,258
l arrange the food you eat.

2759
02:18:28,933 --> 02:18:31,731
ou have the power
to make others laugh.

2760
02:18:32,137 --> 02:18:33,764
But you don't have
the power to earn money.

2761
02:18:33,872 --> 02:18:34,998
l will really earn that money.

2762
02:18:35,173 --> 02:18:38,973
l will do it, dad.
Please trjust me.

2763
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:42,170
Who else will trjust me if you don't?

2764
02:18:42,314 --> 02:18:44,407
Please, dad! Trjust me.

2765
02:18:46,551 --> 02:18:47,540
What should we do?

2766
02:18:47,686 --> 02:18:50,382
l don't know. But we should
somehow earn that money.

2767
02:18:50,522 --> 02:18:52,251
just say yes,
l'll get the tools ready.

2768
02:18:52,357 --> 02:18:53,153
For what?

2769
02:18:53,258 --> 02:18:57,194
We'll rob the very bank that
is creating problems for brother.

2770
02:18:57,295 --> 02:18:58,728
We'll settle this whole
matter in a single night.

2771
02:18:58,830 --> 02:18:59,660
What do you say?

2772
02:18:59,764 --> 02:19:01,925
lf everyone that needs
money steals it...

2773
02:19:02,033 --> 02:19:03,796
...only thieves will
remain on this earth.

2774
02:19:03,902 --> 02:19:05,130
But...

2775
02:19:08,473 --> 02:19:10,338
Hi, Naresh! How are you, man?

2776
02:19:10,575 --> 02:19:12,668
l've been trying
to contact you since last week.

2777
02:19:12,944 --> 02:19:13,706
ou are...

2778
02:19:13,812 --> 02:19:15,404
l'm Narendra, an event organizer.

2779
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:18,913
l transform stage shoWS
into albums and release them.

2780
02:19:19,117 --> 02:19:21,813
l saw your performance last time
lt was simply superb.

2781
02:19:21,986 --> 02:19:23,749
Look, brother!
l need an ultimate program...

2782
02:19:23,822 --> 02:19:26,518
...which is message oriented
and which touches the heart.

2783
02:19:26,624 --> 02:19:28,615
Will you do it for me?
Don't worry about the money.

2784
02:19:28,727 --> 02:19:30,820
l will pay you whatever
you want in advance.

2785
02:19:32,664 --> 02:19:33,824
Say yes.

2786
02:19:34,332 --> 02:19:35,629
l'll do it, sir.

2787
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:47,644
l'm a joker, not a lover.

2788
02:19:47,712 --> 02:19:49,737
This is my heart.

2789
02:19:51,149 --> 02:19:53,845
Let it be magic or illusion
lt takes us to an unknown world

2790
02:19:53,952 --> 02:19:57,388
Yesterday is a waste paper
Today is a news paper

2791
02:19:57,489 --> 02:19:59,047
Tomorrow is an question paper

2792
02:19:59,157 --> 02:20:02,490
Life is a book, fail to read it properly
Can't find answers for the troubles you face

2793
02:20:02,594 --> 02:20:04,255
And don't get confused yourself

2794
02:20:04,362 --> 02:20:06,660
l am the laughter joker!

2795
02:20:07,432 --> 02:20:12,267
Friend! Both our roles are different
We're born with pre-written destiny

2796
02:20:12,637 --> 02:20:15,868
This is purely the drama of life

2797
02:20:15,974 --> 02:20:20,377
Hardly we born and open our eyes
Then began our life story

2798
02:20:21,146 --> 02:20:24,445
We should lead it forward

2799
02:20:24,549 --> 02:20:28,212
The director who makes us act
The audience who praise our performance

2800
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:31,311
ls none other than God Himself

2801
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:35,086
He hides from our eyes
But watches our antics

2802
02:20:35,193 --> 02:20:38,356
And assesses our good and bad deeds

2803
02:20:38,463 --> 02:20:41,591
Good performance makes you a good scorer

2804
02:20:41,699 --> 02:20:45,135
Get scared and fail and you become a joker

2805
02:20:45,336 --> 02:20:48,430
Good performance makes you a good scorer

2806
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:52,306
Get scared and fail and you become a joker

2807
02:20:53,845 --> 02:20:57,508
l feel l'm seeing light after ages.

2808
02:20:57,649 --> 02:21:01,107
But my body is burning hot.

2809
02:21:01,386 --> 02:21:03,718
Sir, there's air conditioning
in the car. Please get inside.

2810
02:21:03,888 --> 02:21:06,413
Air conditioning
won't solve the problem.

2811
02:21:06,491 --> 02:21:09,722
That officer's death
will cool me down.

2812
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:28,340
ou have the power
to make others laugh.

2813
02:21:28,546 --> 02:21:30,207
But you don't have
the power to earn money.

2814
02:21:30,315 --> 02:21:36,948
Before you close and open your eyes
The time will pass in a jiffy

2815
02:21:37,055 --> 02:21:43,984
lt is His play
He decides the start and the end

2816
02:21:44,095 --> 02:21:50,796
Should perform the characters given to us

2817
02:21:50,902 --> 02:21:57,068
Should fulfill our duties
as written in our fate

2818
02:21:57,175 --> 02:22:03,978
Parents gave life to this body

2819
02:22:04,082 --> 02:22:11,250
l am duty bound to repay them

2820
02:22:11,489 --> 02:22:18,588
Should make them happy
those who gave birth

2821
02:22:19,564 --> 02:22:22,692
Good performance makes you a good scorer

2822
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:26,429
Fail in your duties and you become a joker

2823
02:22:26,538 --> 02:22:31,134
Do your duties perfectly
Don't be called as a joker

2824
02:22:49,294 --> 02:22:52,730
l accept you as my wife
before the five elements.

2825
02:23:00,238 --> 02:23:06,939
Nothing you desire can be attained easily

2826
02:23:07,045 --> 02:23:13,848
No road to happiness is straight

2827
02:23:14,052 --> 02:23:20,685
Destiny can be altered
by parting from the love one

2828
02:23:20,825 --> 02:23:27,025
Will have to bear the pain
of the heart

2829
02:23:27,131 --> 02:23:33,866
Curse and remorse are
the only two ways out

2830
02:23:33,972 --> 02:23:41,276
The life mjust go on whatsoever...

2831
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:48,410
The play should be ended
without fully getting defeated

2832
02:23:49,587 --> 02:23:52,613
Perform the play to His likes
You'll be a good player

2833
02:23:52,724 --> 02:23:56,125
lf you perform otherwise
You'll become a joker

2834
02:23:56,361 --> 02:23:59,524
Perform the play to His likes
You'll be a good player

2835
02:23:59,631 --> 02:24:03,567
lf you perform otherwise
You'll become a joker

2836
02:24:12,076 --> 02:24:13,236
Fantastic!

2837
02:24:34,532 --> 02:24:35,499
Brother!

2838
02:24:35,933 --> 02:24:36,865
l paid back all the money.

2839
02:24:36,968 --> 02:24:38,230
- Brother!
- The problem is solved.

2840
02:24:38,336 --> 02:24:39,963
Okay. But why did you
wear this shirt?

2841
02:24:40,071 --> 02:24:41,299
- What's wrong with it?
-ou didn't have this shirt.

2842
02:24:41,372 --> 02:24:42,805
our sister-in-law brought it
for me while coming back.

2843
02:24:42,907 --> 02:24:43,737
But why are you so worried?

2844
02:24:43,808 --> 02:24:45,105
No, brother
Take off that shirt right now.

2845
02:24:45,209 --> 02:24:46,176
Officer!

2846
02:24:50,481 --> 02:24:51,379
Brother, take off this shirt.

2847
02:24:51,482 --> 02:24:53,450
-What are you doing?
-just take off this shirt.

2848
02:24:53,651 --> 02:24:56,313
l didn't decide that l'll kill him
if he has a shirt.

2849
02:24:56,421 --> 02:24:58,912
l jjust decided that l'll kill him
That's it.

2850
02:25:10,601 --> 02:25:11,795
Brother!

2851
02:25:13,171 --> 02:25:14,502
Oh God!

2852
02:25:36,227 --> 02:25:37,057
Oh God!

2853
02:25:37,161 --> 02:25:39,823
ou can't escape from me.

2854
02:25:39,897 --> 02:25:40,864
l beg of you. Don't kill me.

2855
02:25:40,932 --> 02:25:43,457
Royyala Naidu set the trap.

2856
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:50,534
Brother, take off this shirt
Come on.

2857
02:25:50,608 --> 02:25:51,870
Brother, please take it off.

2858
02:25:52,643 --> 02:25:54,304
Take it off, come on quick.

2859
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,448
Take it off, brother.

2860
02:26:29,213 --> 02:26:34,708
'ou fooled me by showing
only half truth, Lord yama.'

2861
02:26:41,726 --> 02:26:45,127
Royyala Naidu! ou are finished!

2862
02:26:45,396 --> 02:26:46,727
Son!

2863
02:26:48,132 --> 02:26:49,394
Son!

2864
02:26:55,706 --> 02:26:56,832
Mom!

2865
02:26:57,875 --> 02:26:59,240
Brother!

2866
02:27:03,181 --> 02:27:06,309
'ou gave me a chance
to save my family.'

2867
02:27:06,417 --> 02:27:07,543
'Thanks, yama.'

2868
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:11,611
Son! Son!

2869
02:27:23,501 --> 02:27:26,800
l'm the guardian of this
invisible wheel of time.

2870
02:27:27,305 --> 02:27:30,638
l decide the lifespan
of everyone in this universe.

2871
02:27:30,942 --> 02:27:36,312
l give death and take lives.

2872
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:43,044
There is no power
that can stand against me.

2873
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:46,248
How can a mere human
stand against me?

2874
02:27:50,895 --> 02:27:52,556
l made you write
your own destiny.

2875
02:27:52,663 --> 02:27:58,192
l made you spell your own death.

2876
02:27:58,302 --> 02:28:00,395
And then l took your life.

2877
02:28:00,471 --> 02:28:02,166
l'm Lord yama!

2878
02:28:03,507 --> 02:28:05,702
What did you say?

2879
02:28:05,810 --> 02:28:08,278
Will you make me
wash your feet?

2880
02:28:08,846 --> 02:28:12,907
you died today and fell at my feet.

2881
02:28:14,151 --> 02:28:18,053
Narada! ou created all
this drama didn't you?

2882
02:28:18,222 --> 02:28:20,315
Look how l put an end to it today.

2883
02:28:20,925 --> 02:28:26,693
Tell your creator to do
his duties sincerely from now.

2884
02:28:26,797 --> 02:28:28,662
Are you proud of yourself?

2885
02:28:29,734 --> 02:28:31,702
you've proved that
you are impartial...

2886
02:28:31,802 --> 02:28:37,104
...by punishing humans
on earth and you daughter too.

2887
02:28:37,375 --> 02:28:38,239
you can be proud of yourself.

2888
02:28:38,342 --> 02:28:39,604
-Aiyo!
-yes, l'm Aiyo.

2889
02:28:39,944 --> 02:28:43,573
l'm your wife Aiyo that
never spoke against you.

2890
02:28:43,781 --> 02:28:49,242
But l question you today
as a mother of a daughter.

2891
02:28:49,487 --> 02:28:50,784
Answer me.

2892
02:28:52,356 --> 02:28:54,824
What sin did this human do?

2893
02:28:54,959 --> 02:28:57,655
ls it a sin not
to misuse his powers?

2894
02:28:57,795 --> 02:29:00,286
Or, is it a sin to
be born without a destiny?

2895
02:29:00,464 --> 02:29:02,329
Don't you know that
it was Brahma's mistake...

2896
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,027
...that he didn't write
this man's destiny?

2897
02:29:04,201 --> 02:29:07,068
Then how can you
punish him forthat?

2898
02:29:09,807 --> 02:29:11,707
ls it because humans
are below yourfeet?

2899
02:29:11,809 --> 02:29:15,370
Or, is it because there
is no one above to punish you?

2900
02:29:15,746 --> 02:29:18,146
The problem started
the day this human was born.

2901
02:29:18,316 --> 02:29:22,047
Why didn't you take that
into account that day itself?

2902
02:29:22,219 --> 02:29:24,210
Are you punishing him today
because he loves your girl?

2903
02:29:24,755 --> 02:29:27,918
our whip that takes
lives is not great.

2904
02:29:28,025 --> 02:29:32,428
Their love that gives life is great.

2905
02:29:33,564 --> 02:29:37,159
That's why he gave his life
to save his father's life.

2906
02:29:37,335 --> 02:29:39,496
He sacrificed his
love for your daughter.

2907
02:29:39,603 --> 02:29:42,731
He left his powers
at your feet and left.

2908
02:29:43,007 --> 02:29:45,976
you should be proud
that your daughter...

2909
02:29:46,077 --> 02:29:47,908
...got a place in such
a loving man's heart.

2910
02:29:48,913 --> 02:29:51,507
Father, killing is your duty.

2911
02:29:51,782 --> 02:29:53,374
So you killed him.

2912
02:29:53,651 --> 02:29:55,312
you killed our love.

2913
02:29:55,386 --> 02:29:57,320
Kill me as well, father.

2914
02:29:58,022 --> 02:30:01,924
l don't ask for anything
else as your daughter.

2915
02:30:02,026 --> 02:30:06,827
Lord, we are used to giving
lovers an untimely death.

2916
02:30:06,897 --> 02:30:10,094
lt doesn't matter
if he is a man oryour own daughter.

2917
02:30:11,669 --> 02:30:12,863
yes, father.

2918
02:30:13,104 --> 02:30:14,571
Shejjust asked you for one thing.

2919
02:30:14,705 --> 02:30:16,730
At least fulfill
this one desire of hers.

2920
02:30:17,108 --> 02:30:20,600
l love my sister very much
Me as well...

2921
02:30:22,179 --> 02:30:27,207
Husband, look into my eyes.

2922
02:30:31,322 --> 02:30:33,483
Why can't you look into my eyes?

2923
02:30:34,458 --> 02:30:36,517
ls it because you did a mistake?

2924
02:30:36,994 --> 02:30:40,122
Be it a human or a God
they can't look into the eyes...

2925
02:30:40,231 --> 02:30:42,529
...of another person
when they do a mistake.

2926
02:30:42,700 --> 02:30:46,329
l know that you are
stopping your heart.

2927
02:30:46,637 --> 02:30:52,166
Otherwise why would
you have tears in your eyes?

2928
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:55,572
you can deceive your heart.

2929
02:30:57,114 --> 02:30:59,309
But your eyes give you away.

2930
02:30:59,617 --> 02:31:00,413
There's nothing like that.

2931
02:31:00,518 --> 02:31:02,679
Dust went into my
eyes and made them teary.

2932
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:15,831
Hey, Human!

2933
02:31:16,033 --> 02:31:18,900
you what's the most powerful
weapon in the world?

2934
02:31:19,136 --> 02:31:20,034
lt is love.

2935
02:31:20,104 --> 02:31:23,096
you proved that
you can win over your neighbor...

2936
02:31:23,174 --> 02:31:25,665
...the neighboring country
and even Lord yama with it.

2937
02:31:25,776 --> 02:31:29,212
Don't stand before me
Take my daughter and leave.

2938
02:31:30,247 --> 02:31:33,444
ou? Why did you come
after doing what you did?

2939
02:31:33,617 --> 02:31:35,312
l came to do what needs to be done.

2940
02:31:35,453 --> 02:31:37,216
-What is left to be done?
-Wedding.

2941
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:38,948
There are no auspicious
timings in this month.

2942
02:31:39,056 --> 02:31:41,422
Shut up! Brahma himself
wants to get them married.

2943
02:31:41,559 --> 02:31:42,583
Why do you need auspicious timing?

2944
02:31:42,726 --> 02:31:44,353
The time fixed by Brahma
is very auspicious.

2945
02:31:44,428 --> 02:31:45,622
What, Brahma?

2946
02:31:48,999 --> 02:31:51,229
Brahma! What time
did you fix forthat?

2947
02:31:51,335 --> 02:31:53,667
- For what?
- l meant for that.

2948
02:31:53,804 --> 02:31:55,328
We don't need him forthat
We'll fix it ourselves.

2949
02:31:55,473 --> 02:31:56,497
Let's go.

2950
02:31:57,174 --> 02:31:59,904
That's the story
of yama's son-in-law.

2951
02:32:00,010 --> 02:32:02,103
He finished his intermediate exams...

2952
02:32:02,179 --> 02:32:04,147
...and immediately
went for his honeymoon.

2953
02:32:04,315 --> 02:32:07,580
But he got his honeymoon results...

2954
02:32:07,685 --> 02:32:09,448
...before the intermediate results.

2955
02:32:11,455 --> 02:32:12,649

2956
02:32:21,332 --> 02:32:23,300

l told you.

2958
02:32:27,471 --> 02:32:29,564
- My father.
-yes, dad!

2960
02:32:30,875 --> 02:32:31,933
Really?

2961
02:32:32,243 --> 02:32:34,370
-our daughter-in-law is missing.
-What?

2962
02:32:34,512 --> 02:32:35,774
l meant she is pregnant.

2963
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:38,007
-Am l going to be a grandfather?
-yes.

2964
02:32:38,115 --> 02:32:40,447
yeah! Tell this to
your father-in-law as well.

2965
02:32:40,618 --> 02:32:41,744
l told you since you have a phone.

2966
02:32:41,886 --> 02:32:43,183
How should l tell him?

2967
02:32:46,090 --> 02:32:47,990
yami! That man is
going to yourfather.

2968
02:32:48,058 --> 02:32:49,184
Let's tell him.

2969
02:32:51,562 --> 02:32:52,551
Hello, brother!

2970
02:32:52,763 --> 02:32:54,196
Please do me a favor.

2971
02:32:54,632 --> 02:32:56,657
Tell her father
that she is pregnant.

2972
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:57,630
What?

2973
02:32:58,202 --> 02:32:59,897
Oh, sorry. you speak English, right?

2974
02:33:00,037 --> 02:33:02,699
you tell Lord yama that
his daughter is pregnant.

2975
02:33:02,873 --> 02:33:04,636
Ask him to celebrate this
Enjoyment, okay?

2976
02:33:04,742 --> 02:33:05,800
Okay.

2977
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:06,939
He'll give the message.
