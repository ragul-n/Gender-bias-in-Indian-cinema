1
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,240
"I am a witch."

2
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
"My eyes cast black magic."

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,320
"I wander in the darkness of night."

4
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,480
"My aura will instil fear in you."

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,280
"Witch.
- It's my reincarnation."

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,080
"Witch.
- It's the end of your story."

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,480
'CHURAILS'

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
1. FIDELITY...

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,520
'Once upon a time,
a lawyer, a boxer,'

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,480
'Once upon a time,
a lawyer, a boxer,'

11
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,840
'a wedding planner and a
murderer got together.'

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,360
'And they realised'

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,440
'that all their lives,
they'd been mannequins.'

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,920
'Mannequins'

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,560
'clothed in your honour,
for your honour.'

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Your honour can go fuck...

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,040
Watch your tongue, ma'am.

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,880
No, madam. Tell us the full story...

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,080
From the beginning...

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
In order.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,120
Okay, mom.
- Here have this.

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Make sure you finish it!

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,160
Dad, I'm leaving.
- Hold on.

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,240
Wait for your brother.

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,960
Come on, dad.
I'm just going to college.

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,200
And sending Munna as my
bodyguard everyday...

27
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,080
it looks cheap.

28
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,120
And I'm wearing a burka.
So, what's the problem?

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,880
'On one hand, my dad's sandal.'

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,280
It looks cheap? Shameless girl!

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,760
Want to tarnish my reputation!
- 'Size 11.'

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,560
'On the other hand,
this 11 year old bull!'

33
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,440
'Munna by name,
my brother by relation.'

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,840
Dad, do you know what sis
does after college?

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
'And by profession'

36
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
'my bodyguard and blackmailer.'

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,120
Dad, sis attends tuition after
college and works really hard.

38
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
That's why she comes home late.

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,640
Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib...

40
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,960
was a prominent poet
of the subcontinent.

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,840
Ghalib lost his parents
at a very young age.

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,040
He was raised by his uncle,
Mirza Nasrullah Baig.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,400
But when he was 8,
even his uncle passed away.

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,720
Nawab Ahmed Baksh Khan had
fixed an allowance...

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,520
for Ghalib's family
with the British.

46
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,120
Oh my God!

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,880
Zubaida!

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,760
'The witch that lives inside me...'

49
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Zubaida, don't do this!

50
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,360
'Has always been slightly
out of control.'

51
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,800
'And why wouldn't she be?'

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,240
'Girl. Poor.'

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,120
'And if that wasn't enough,
they named me Zubaida.'

54
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,760
'Of all the names in the world...'

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,920
'Zubaida!'

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,080
Oh my! Dongle 420!

57
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,280
Oh wow!

58
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,160
Six pack. Oh God!

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,760
"Those were the days;
We would count coins!"

60
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,040
"We'd smoke cigarettes..."

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,800
"We didn't have a care in
the world..."

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,720
"I teach everyone a lesson,
I'll bury them!"

63
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,320
"I am like the crocodile
in a cat fight..."

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,160
"I indulge in hanky panky,
don't be so sentimental!"

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,280
'Here, Zubaida would tear into
the poor punching bag...'

66
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,320
'And on the other side
of the bridge...'

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
Stop! Sameer!

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
Okay, come on, Sameer.
Here, sweetie.

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
I don't want, mommy.

70
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
Breakfast...

71
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,240
Breakfast is the most important
meal of the day.

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Morning, guys.

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,200
Morning.
- Hey there, buddy. How you doing?

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,720
Morning!
- Dad, stop! Dad.

75
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,600
Hey, sweetheart. How you doing?

76
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,040
What you up to?

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
Morning.
- Morning.

78
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,720
We need to do something
about the garden.

79
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,120
Oh, I'm on it.

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,080
I have shortlisted five gardeners.

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,600
They'll be here for an
interview tomorrow.

82
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,880
But please Jamil,
be nice to who we hire.

83
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,560
If they work properly.

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Grace!

85
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Grace!

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,360
Can you take this please? Thank you.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,280
Listen,
do you want anything from New York?

88
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
Barneys? Bergdorf?

89
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
You fly tonight!

90
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,520
I didn't put it in my calendar.

91
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,680
I'll pack your navy blue pinstripe
and tangerine tie, yeah?

92
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,960
You know I love you.
- Of course I do.

93
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,160
Ew! Yucky, daddy.

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
You're yucky!

95
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,120
Hey! Don't do that. Stop!
- You guys!

96
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,800
Please. - Stop, the lot of you!
Stop it, right now.

97
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,120
Leave it, Jamil.
- Now.

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
This is our home.
It's not a pigsty...

99
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,320
where dirty, filthy...
- Please.

100
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,280
And you!
You're supposed to lead by example.

101
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
Kiddos, you know I love you.

102
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,320
But we've to be the best
versions of ourselves.

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,160
Right?

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
"Keep flying, without a care..."

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,920
Sameer, behave yourself.
- Mila!

106
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,520
Mila, he's pulling off my glasses.

107
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,440
What's going on? Enough!

108
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,120
Chocolate.

109
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,160
Mummy, you always say...

110
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
that we can't have chocolate
in the morning. - Well...

111
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,480
Mummies get a free pass sometimes.

112
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
You're supposed to lead by example.

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,120
When you pop three monkeys
out of your tummy...

114
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,400
then we'll talk.

115
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,160
Mummy.
- But I'm a boy.

116
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
I can't.
- Yes, dear?

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Akbar told me...

118
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,680
that babies don't come
out of mummy's tummy.

119
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,560
You push them from the...

120
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,160
We cannot suspend a child
on that basis alone...

121
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,760
Mrs Khan.
- Last week...

122
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,480
told Amal that a boy's 'nony'
is called a penis.

123
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,960
I mean, we didn't know it was
called a penis up until...

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,520
Times are changing, Mrs. Khan!

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,600
We actually encourage parents...

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,240
to use the correct biological
terminology with the children.

127
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,520
This is highly inappropriate.

128
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,280
Please. I need you to bring Akbar
and his hippie parents in...

129
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,080
so we can have a meeting. - This
is no legal matter, Mrs. Khan.

130
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,960
And even if it was...

131
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,920
it's not like you're a practising
lawyer anymore.

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
Go home. Relax.

133
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,280
Take up knitting.

134
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,040
It can be very therapeutic.

135
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,480
'Asking a full time mother,
who left her career for her kids'

136
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,880
'to take up knitting, is wrong.'

137
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,080
I'm so sorry. I'm really so sorry.

138
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,080
I don't know what happened.
- Crazy bitch!

139
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,960
So we've Amal's piano
lessons on Monday...

140
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Salaar's karate,
and Sameer's English tuition.

141
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,120
Thank God they don't press charges,
or suspend children.

142
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
IN TAGALOG Control your rage or
it'll control you. - Yes, yes.

143
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,400
Putting aside your perfectly
nice family...

144
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
Was this your idea or
somebody else's?

145
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Boss, when you do this heavy
duty work yourself...

146
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,440
something tingles inside me.
- Shut your mouth, Dilbar.

147
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
These? What are these?

148
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,880
I said purple dendrobiums
with green carnations.

149
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,480
I even sent the pictures
from Pinterest.

150
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,840
What flowers are these?

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,760
Hydrangeas.
- What?

152
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
Jugnu, madam!

153
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,960
Crap.

154
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,880
Imported from Singapore.
We got a great deal.

155
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,880
I'm only getting married once.

156
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,440
Lifetime marriage.
I don't want cheap deals.

157
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,800
I want something meaningful.

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,880
Mummy, say something!

159
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,720
My baby wants soul!

160
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,120
Aunty...

161
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
Hydrangeas ooze soul.

162
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,760
Carnations represent weakness.

163
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,800
You want your lifetime marriage
to be strong, don't you?

164
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Obviously! - Then why would you
on the very first day...

165
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,160
I mean, it's okay, I can um...

166
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,560
Have carnations delivered
in two hours.

167
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,320
It's not a big deal.
- No, this is fine.

168
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,920
Sure? Because I could fill this
place up with carnations.

169
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,400
We want hydrangeas. Right, mummy?

170
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760
Yes, sure.
- Yeah, we're fine.

171
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,400
Okay, great then.
Go get your Sabya on.

172
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,480
Fucking soul.

173
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Yes boys, what's the scene?

174
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,440
"The boy is a bit offbeat..."

175
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,760
"But he is very sweet with
girls."

176
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,440
"He is insolent, and a fraud,
this tweet has gone viral."

177
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,360
"But you are a sharp knife,
good at making fools..."

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,600
"We have made preparations
for your wedding."

179
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:08,400
"Everyone is dancing, and
rejoicing together..."

180
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:16,240
"Everyone is dancing, and
rejoicing together..."

181
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,160
"Live it up!"

182
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Boss...

183
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Congratulations.

184
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,080
After this one,
we complete our hundred events.

185
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,360
We should celebrate...
Golden, silver jubilee type.

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,840
We hit a hundred.

187
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,120
Feels like yesterday we were
having our first wedding!

188
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,600
"He is insolent, and a fraud;
This tweet has gone viral."

189
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,560
"But you are a sharp knife,
good at making fools..."

190
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
Don't put your mouth to it.

191
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,120
"Everyone is dancing, and
rejoicing together..."

192
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
'Fucking hydrangeas.'

193
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,080
'Five years ago,
I'd an eighty percent share'

194
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,480
'of Karachi's wedding market.'

195
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,320
'Then I got so distracted
by my marital issues'

196
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,640
'that the gays in this city took
over most of my business.'

197
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,760
'And whatever little
was left of it...'

198
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,400
'I dropped a chandelier
on it myself.'

199
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,160
How do the January bookings
look like?

200
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,960
We've the Jofas right after
Christmas. - And?

201
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,440
Durranis confirmed for January? No?

202
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,560
Yes, I was about to inform you.

203
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,520
I called them for the advance...

204
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
but they've decided to
go with Ro and Ho.

205
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,800
Ro and Ho!

206
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,920
Ro and bloody...

207
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,120
I hate them.
- Yep.

208
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,920
Fucked by fairies.

209
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,760
Story of my life.

210
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,960
Jugnu,
the finances aren't looking good.

211
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,720
Fight stand! One, two...

212
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,200
Three, four, five...

213
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,720
Six, seven, eight...

214
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,080
Nine, ten, eleven...

215
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

216
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,520
Fifteen, sixteen.
- Upper cut, baby! Upper cut!

217
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,600
Oh, thank you.
Didn't they've those...

218
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,440
you know,
the chocolatey flakey things?

219
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,400
Okay, never mind!

220
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,960
He can do better, right?

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
I mean, I know he's my son.

222
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,920
And he's just seven,
but check out his forearm block.

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,480
You can do better!
Salaar, I know you can do better.

224
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,960
He can do better.

225
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Only if I was a bloody gay man.

226
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
All my money worries
would be sorted.

227
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,400
You know,
everything is going so smoothly.

228
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,120
Which is great.

229
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,640
But I have so much time on my hands.

230
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,600
Jamil is never home.

231
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,680
So I was thinking...

232
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,920
that I should start practising
law again.

233
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I had to fire everyone.

234
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,960
I'll have to leave the club too.

235
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,120
But I'll miss being all this.

236
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,960
I'm so resourceful.

237
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,360
And I can multi-task. I should.

238
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,120
Break the board, Salaar!

239
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Come on!

240
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,760
I should just move to Islamabad.

241
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,480
Start afresh.

242
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,800
I should talk to Jamil.

243
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,600
Yes, I should tell him...

244
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,520
that I want to do something new.

245
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
I want to achieve something
new in life.

246
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,360
Break the damn wood, Salaar!

247
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,400
He's done better. He's done better.

248
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
Jamil is crazy about you, okay?

249
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,920
Talk to him, he will understand.

250
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,920
And you go do you.

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,840
Find yourself that courtroom,
and do...

252
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,080
'Objection, Your Honour, and...'

253
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,280
'Ooh, milord!'

254
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
We don't do, 'Ooh, milord'.
- Really, sweetie?

255
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,080
I think that is the real issue then.

256
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,760
Listen, Islamabad is for
socially awkward freaks.

257
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,040
And you're Queen Jugnu, man.

258
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,120
If you killed ten people at
the wedding, almost...

259
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,480
They didn't really die!

260
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,960
People will get over it.
Don't worry about it.

261
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,680
You are right.

262
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,080
I am the Queen.

263
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,920
Jugnu Chaudhary is the Queen
of this whole damn jungle.

264
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,080
This shit isn't working!

265
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,600
Come on, baby!

266
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,640
You can do it, honey!

267
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,920
So your friend was after money...

268
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,440
What were you after?

269
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,040
I love those earrings on you.
- Thanks.

270
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,760
You got them.
- I know.

271
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
That's why I love them.

272
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,680
I was... Thank you for entertaining
Shanwari at the party today.

273
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,040
Due to your irresistible charm,
he'll now invest in my campaign.

274
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,520
You're the perfect wife.

275
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,160
'Perfect wife.'

276
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,080
'Fuck you, perfect wife.'

277
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,560
After this campaign stuff is done...

278
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,080
let's go on a holiday. You and me?

279
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
We'll leave the kids with mummy.
Capri?

280
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
I was thinking,
I should start working again.

281
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Work?

282
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,320
What do you mean work?
You've not worked in years.

283
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,360
Yes, that is why...

284
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,440
I was just being anxious.
- Are you unhappy?

285
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,720
No, of course I'm happy, silly.

286
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm just happy anxious!

287
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,120
If it's because of that principal...

288
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,040
then the bitch totally deserved it.

289
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,040
Plus we're in the clear,
so there's nothing to worry about.

290
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,800
It's not that.

291
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,920
What is it then? I am here.

292
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
Yes, you are.

293
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,360
But I don't think I'm fully here.

294
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,080
I mean, it's just an idea.

295
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,640
But it'll be nice, using my skills
to excel in something else.

296
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
Push my boundaries.

297
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,840
Push your boundaries as what?

298
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,880
Who'll hire you?

299
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
You know what I mean.

300
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,840
I am a qualified lawyer.

301
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,040
Yes, but you're...

302
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,920
You're rusty.

303
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,120
And family law, is it even law?

304
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,400
Work in an NGO...

305
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,920
Part-time. You know, baby steps.

306
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,600
Yeah, you're right.

307
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Part time NGO sounds good.

308
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
'This is what it boils down to.'

309
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,720
'Soft. Mouldable.'

310
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
'Colourful.'

311
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
'Shape us as you deem fit.'

312
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,360
And to make the lives of these elite
types even more colourful...

313
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,640
you jumped right in.

314
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,120
As if we didn't have...

315
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,600
enough thieves and junkies
in the building...

316
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,400
Now even murderers are going
be our neighbours!

317
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,040
They should have hung her.

318
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
Bloody witch!

319
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,440
'This little devil
was spying on us.'

320
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,360
'Looks like he's an informant
for the police.'

321
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,560
'We have to get out of here.'

322
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,800
'And before going,'

323
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,520
'we'll need to get rid of him.'

324
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,120
'Make sure they don't escape.'

325
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,080
'I was all set to end things...'

326
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,720
'But right then...'

327
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,520
'My fucking caseworker
made her entry.'

328
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,160
She lives alone.
No husband or children.

329
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,880
You won't have much work to do.

330
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,880
It's very hot,
may I get a glass of water?

331
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,840
'Who doesn't love a second chance?'

332
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,800
'Fate, boss.'

333
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
'Fate.'

334
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,200
"Surrounded in smoke, where are
you off to?"

335
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,640
"No one is listening to you..."

336
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,520
I'm Batool. You needed a maid?

337
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,160
"Am I thinking, or have
I lost it?"

338
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:39,440
"Dawn in darkness;
What are you saying?"

339
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:47,400
"If you are crazy....?"

340
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,720
I can't iron clothes.

341
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,080
Cut some amount from my pay.

342
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,960
It's fine.

343
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,080
There is that bag over there.

344
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,360
I took some old clothes out for you,
take them.

345
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,080
No need.

346
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,240
You hired someone like me,
that's more than enough.

347
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,680
Someone like you comes cheap.

348
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,680
Cut the amount from my pay.

349
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
How does it feel...

350
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,120
To be free?

351
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,800
You thought I was free?

352
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,080
There are vacant rooms in the house.
If you want, you can stay here.

353
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,520
I'll think about it.

354
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,080
Alright, think about it.

355
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Good night.

356
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Bitch.

357
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:17,400
"I manage to read
your eyes."

358
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:25,480
"I steal everyday, and
sing songs."

359
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:34,720
"Sometimes I just throw
my heart away..."

360
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,320
"I bathe in tears..."

361
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:47,120
"I flow like the wind at night."

362
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,640
"We'll have to fool mother
today..."

363
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,040
Did you have sex with her?

364
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Speak!
- No, sir. I...

365
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,160
I respect her a lot. I wouldn't...
- You respect her?

366
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,960
That's why you sent her naked
pictures on Tinder, motherfucker!

367
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,720
Not naked, sir.

368
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Topless.

369
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,440
This is their doing.
It was all their plan!

370
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Come here!

371
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Hey!

372
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
You keep this...

373
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,120
for your safety.

374
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
If I say something...

375
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
I don't know what you'll
think of me.

376
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,040
What will I think?

377
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,160
You're lovely.
You'll always stay lovely.

378
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,080
You can tell me anything.

379
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,280
I want to be a boxer.

380
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,960
Boxer? Like Muhammad Ali?
- Yes.

381
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,360
When those gloves are on my hands...

382
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,680
and I'm throwing punches...

383
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,040
I have never felt more alive.

384
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,160
Even I do something that
make me feel alive.

385
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,040
I hack accounts...

386
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,520
Over the Internet. Online.

387
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,480
I crack people's passwords and I
browse their internet history...

388
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,320
Sorry, I...

389
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,400
I know this is not right.

390
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,040
Why do you do it?

391
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Honestly, I'm damn good at it.

392
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,960
But also,
because it gives me meaning.

393
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,880
It feels good connecting to
these random strangers.

394
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,560
But I never misuse
their information.

395
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,440
I just use what I know of
them to say things...

396
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,480
that will make their
pain a little less.

397
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,040
Wow, biceps!

398
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,320
You turned out to be even
more messed up than me.

399
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,280
If I offended you...
- No.

400
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
You didn't.

401
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,800
Close your eyes.
- Hmm?

402
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
Close your eyes!

403
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,040
Imagine my face...

404
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,040
Swollen.

405
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,560
Maybe a tooth missing...

406
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,080
Wounded...

407
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,320
Will you still find me lovely?

408
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,520
Yes, absolutely.

409
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,960
Awesome.

410
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,080
'Ninja.'

411
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
'Witch.'

412
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,160
'First rule of boxing.'

413
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,880
One, two.

414
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,760
'Never underestimate your opponent.'

415
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,040
You slut!
- What are you doing?

416
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,160
You've shown your true colours!
Show it. - Let me go, dad.

417
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,880
No.
- Let it go!

418
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,040
Dad, don't.

419
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,600
Let go.

420
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,520
Showing your worth.

421
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,560
'I spent my week's tuition money
to pay for new gloves.'

422
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,600
'My brother missed out on his bribe'

423
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
'and took revenge.'

424
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,040
What is this?

425
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,120
Where are you going?

426
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,400
Come here!

427
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,200
Where are you taking the phone?
Give it to me.

428
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,680
Give it to me!
- Dad.

429
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,560
Dad, give me my phone!
- Let it go! Let go!

430
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,040
What's in it?

431
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,640
Dad, my phone.
- What's the password?

432
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,800
Give the password!
- Come on!

433
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,240
Give it!

434
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,520
"Send all pictures to printer."

435
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,840
Munna! Come here.
Explain this to me.

436
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,040
This monkey it's being shy.

437
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,440
And this is aubergine.
- Aubergine?

438
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,800
And these eyes that are staring
and these sweat beads.

439
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,160
Sis is trying to say that
she's very shy...

440
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,760
but looking at his aubergine
is making her sweat.

441
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,760
What nonsense are you talking!
- Oh God!

442
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,120
Check the photo gallery. You'll
understand everything. - You dog!

443
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
What is it?
- You whore!

444
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,040
'Second rule of boxing.'

445
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,480
'Find a way to keep breathing.'

446
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,960
Go to hell!
- Take this!

447
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,440
Get lost!

448
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,800
'Who knew'

449
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,040
'that the murderous witch,
would be my guardian angel.'

450
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,640
'As mothers we often encourage
our sons to create the world.'

451
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,720
'But never wonder'

452
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,680
'how our daughters will
survive in that world.'

453
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Hi.

454
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,200
"You, who stay awake
at nights..."

455
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,840
"Why do you hesitate to
let us fall asleep?"

456
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,040
"Whenever we come in
front of you..."

457
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,200
"We are not djinns."

458
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,200
Looks like we're having a party.

459
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,600
From Larkana to LA...

460
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,480
75 women got dirty
messages from him.

461
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,520
Huh...
- Seventy five!

462
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,480
And in the last three months...

463
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,800
20 girls sent him their pictures.

464
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,280
Nudes?
- Some.

465
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,520
That means one third
of my entire life...

466
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,400
has been a complete lie?

467
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,360
That's like 33 percent...
- Why are you doing so much math?

468
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,480
What?
- Your kids are not a lie!

469
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,080
They're beautiful and you love them.

470
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,440
Salaar and Sameer will probably
grow up to be like Jamil.

471
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,400
Cheating rascals!
And Amal will turn out like me.

472
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,360
She won't even know what's happening
right under her nose.

473
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,640
Honey, you're grieving.

474
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,280
You need to mourn.

475
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,440
Moan? Why should I moan?

476
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,800
Mourn, not moan.

477
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,040
But you could moan too,
if that's what you want.

478
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,200
I don't want to mourn. I want...

479
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,720
Do you remember Sabeeka?

480
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Her husband was caught cheating
last month. - Oh, that.

481
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,080
Humaira, Zulekha...

482
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,400
Annie, Aliya...

483
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,960
That's like five names in the
last... - No more maths.

484
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,160
All the wives brush it
under the carpet.

485
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,360
All pretending to be
happily married.

486
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,200
So many men, and no punishment?

487
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,960
There should be some kind
of payback. - Payback?

488
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,640
Yeah! Like a compensation.

489
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,080
'Sorry, wifey.
My penis lost its way home'

490
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,760
'and I owe you for the
rest of my life.'

491
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
First of all,
any man who is cheating...

492
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,440
will never admit to it.
- Unless we catch him red-handed.

493
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,080
How will we do that?
What's the plan?

494
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,800
Will we follow them with binoculars?
What?!

495
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,080
That's it!

496
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,080
That's what we'll do.

497
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
For fuck sake! You've gone nuts.

498
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,880
You need to stop.
This is the hash talking, not you.

499
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,600
No, no, this is me talking.

500
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,160
The me inside me is talking!

501
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Let's do it.

502
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,960
Let's grab these men by the balls.

503
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,280
I love ball grabbing.
But, honey, you're not serious.

504
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm sorry.

505
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

506
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,120
Did you like it?

507
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
Yeah.

508
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,680
Hold it.

509
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,920
But, I...
- Go for it.

510
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,640
Go for it. Come on, come on!

511
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,800
Yes! Go, go!

512
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Yes!

513
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Brilliant.

514
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,040
Yay!

515
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,280
Are you having fun?
- Yeah!

516
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,600
Is everything alright, ma'am?

517
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,680
Yes, all good. You go.

518
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,120
I need some water for Zubaida.

519
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Shall I mop?

520
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,360
Who is this Zubaida?

521
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
And what is she doing in my house?

522
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,880
Her father beat her up.

523
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Had to bring her here.

524
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,880
So...
- See this is what I'm saying!

525
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,560
Sometimes fathers,
sometimes husbands!

526
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,440
You need to stop talking this
moment. - Who are you?

527
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,040
Who's she? - My maid. I told you!
She just got released from prison.

528
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,840
What were you in for?
- Murder.

529
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
Whose?

530
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,280
There was a bastard who needed
to be taught a lesson.

531
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,320
Go from here.
- See!

532
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,520
This is what I'm saying!
- You need to stop saying that.

533
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,520
Should I mop? - No man,
I don't want anything mopped! Go!

534
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,240
What's wrong with you?

535
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,840
Can we trust them?

536
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,960
With what?

537
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,920
One has killed, and the other
one was about to get killed.

538
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,840
Exactly.

539
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,440
Aren't they just so perfect?

540
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,120
Enough, Sara.
You need to stop smoking this, okay.

541
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,880
What?

542
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,280
Wha... Sa... What the...

543
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,960
Sara!

544
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,640
Were you all high?

545
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,800
That wasn't it.

546
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,440
After a long time...

547
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,400
I finally had clarity
about everything.

548
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,080
If a crime isn't illegal per se,
is it not a crime?

549
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,400
Does it not require justice?

550
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,320
If you suspect that your husband
is cheating on you...

551
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,240
and you want proof, you call us.

552
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,520
Pay us according to your means...

553
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,960
and leave the entire
investigation to us.

554
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,720
Investigation?

555
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,680
Count me in, ma'am.

556
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,960
You hold it, Phoolan!

557
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,120
And you have gone mad.

558
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,080
The grief has driven you mad!

559
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,360
Listen, I am talking big money here.

560
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,520
This could be an end to all
your financial troubles.

561
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
Give me the joint.

562
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,360
You think desperate housewives
of Karachi...

563
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,320
will spend money on this?

564
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,640
They spend money on Botox,
lawn and jewellery!

565
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,560
But now they'll spend it on this.

566
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,800
When we give them concrete proof
of their spouse's infidelities.

567
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,360
Trust me.

568
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,120
Bigger divorce settlements...

569
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,320
mean more lawn,
more Botox, more jewellery!

570
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,880
And with what we earn from these
cases, we can help...

571
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,800
the more vulnerable women.

572
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,960
Those who get harassed and
abused on a daily basis.

573
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,960
No one thinks about them.

574
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,960
Not even the police but we will!
- But for this...

575
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,800
you need money...

576
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,320
computers for spying...

577
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,160
cameras,
where will all of that come from?

578
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,960
We'll figure that out too.

579
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,640
All figured out!

580
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,960
Larkana to LA!

581
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,280
No.
- Yes, yes, yes baby!

582
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,800
No.
- If we're going to do this...

583
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,880
we've to do it whole-heartedly.
Okay?

584
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,600
You will have to go to your husband.

585
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,880
I don't want to involve him.

586
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,360
I don't want him to know all this.

587
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
He's not going to know anything!

588
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
Because Miss Innocent...

589
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,120
will turn naughty...

590
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,120
by opening up a 'niqaab' shop.

591
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,880
That's a 'burka', sweetie.

592
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,760
Whatever,
keep up with the programme.

593
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,040
Yeah?

594
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,840
'Either fate had brought us together
under one roof for a reason...'

595
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,960
What? - 'Or it was that magical
spliff in our hands.'

596
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,680
Whatever.
- 'But that was the moment'

597
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,840
'when we transformed into
some other creatures.'

598
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,280
'Churails' (Witches)?

599
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
Yes!

600
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,080
Good morning!
- Morning, darling.

601
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,400
Where are the kids?

602
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,280
I sent them out with Mila.

603
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,560
I was telling the boys last night...

604
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,360
that my wife makes the best...

605
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,560
What...

606
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
Listen to me, babe.

607
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
Oh no.

608
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,280
You listen, babe.

609
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,600
You'll stay in this house,
but will move to the guest room.

610
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,480
And the empty commercial building,
that's in your name...

611
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,760
You'll hand that to me.

612
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,880
From that building,
I'll start my business...

613
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,080
that you'll also fund for me.

614
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,040
What kind of business?

615
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,040
Jugnu and I will open a boutique.

616
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,040
In return, you can run your
campaign peacefully.

617
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,160
For the world, you'll stay my
husband. I, your perfect wife.

618
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,480
Who provides wholesome clothing
to other perfect wives.

619
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,960
Are you seriously going to
blackmail your husband?

620
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,560
It's tasty! Have it!

621
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,360
How can we trust him?

622
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,440
Trust takes time, boss.

623
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,680
But...

624
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,080
Phone.

625
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,480
This is my...

626
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
How?

627
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,600
You won't find a hacker
as good as me.

628
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,240
He's mine. He won't break our trust.

629
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,600
Boss.

630
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,880
Not my place to say, but...

631
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,360
What if this creates a ruckus?

632
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,400
We'll only be helping women, Dilbar.

633
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,680
How will that create trouble?

634
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,880
Where are the arms?

635
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,680
Oh, this with the summer stuff...

636
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,160
Here.

637
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,840
'Perhaps we were fooling ourselves.'
- Have a good day, okay?

638
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,480
Run along.
- 'But those early days...'

639
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,960
'It was the happiest any of us
had been in a long time.'

640
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,280
"What am I doing?"

641
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,920
"I slept off on the shores?"

642
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,320
"What is the fear about?"

643
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,680
"I've been to the graves!"

644
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,480
And you didn't see the danger
that was coming your way?

645
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,960
Someone died because of you, madam.

646
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,640
And now,
someone from your group is missing.

647
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,440
Kidnapped on your watch!

648
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,960
"What am I doing?"

649
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,520
"I slept off on the shores."

650
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,920
"Why am I scared?"

651
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,640
"I have been to graves."

652
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,560
"The stars have spoken."

653
00:53:53,120 --> 00:54:00,440
"One more!"

654
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,400
"What am I doing?"

655
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,440
"The sceneries have seen!"

656
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,240
"What am I doing?"

657
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,480
"The graves have seen."

658
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:00,080
"The stars have spoken.
more!"
