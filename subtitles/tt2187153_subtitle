1
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:58,538
What time will
the Train come?

2
00:02:58,538 --> 00:02:59,334
lt's time for it to come...

3
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,461
lt's expected
any time now...

4
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,106
Ask him exactly
when it will come?

5
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,238
He says he can tell you that
only when the train arrives.

6
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,576
Call him and ask him where
the Train is at this point...

7
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,529
Hello...Who is it...?

8
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,366
l am Jagdish's sister...

9
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:38,240
Yes! Tell me...
Our Train has stopped here.

10
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:39,805
ls he there?

11
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,091
l didn't dance...

12
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:57,766
l slipped.

13
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,004
Your kind attention please...

14
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:45,971
The Army Officers'

15
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:49,336
Special Train from Jammu
to Mumbai Central,

16
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:51,602
Train Number; 1 2472,

17
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:54,912
Jammu Tavi Express is arriving
on Platform Number 5...

18
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:10,893
He's the only one missing.

19
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:14,825
Bro's there...
-Where is he?

20
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,934
Right there...

21
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,563
Hi, Bro!
- Hey, Deepti! How are you?

22
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,504
How are you?
What's with the tiny beard?

23
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,111
That's nothing, Mom...

24
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,409
Hello, Uncle... How are you?

25
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:29,036
l am fine!

26
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:30,913
l don't have
the time to chat.

27
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,709
l'm in a big hurry.

28
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,214
All of you must come
home for a meal.

29
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,884
Don't you ever eat...?

30
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:43,729
Hey... Come on
to this side.

31
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:44,753
l am coming, Dad...

32
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:45,888
Keep the bag in the Trunk.

33
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:47,666
Get in.

34
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:48,529
Go in.

35
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,101
Change to the third gear...

36
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:58,338
Where are we going
in such a hurry...?

37
00:11:58,544 --> 00:11:59,909
Don't you know?

38
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:01,443
We are going to see
a girl for you to marry.

39
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,411
The inauspicious month
starts with tomorrow...

40
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,983
No one will let you see their
daughter during that time...

41
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,043
And the inauspicious time
starts in 25 minutes...

42
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:09,451
We have to see
the girl before that;

43
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,045
else you will remain
a Bachelor even this year...

44
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,553
Mom, what is the fuss
about auspicious time?

45
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:14,785
l'm in uniform.

46
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:17,155
Will anyone go to
see a girl this way?

47
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,029
Let me have a bath,
change clothes,

48
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,258
nap for a bit and
then go out for this.

49
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,264
You're getting old!

50
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,797
l am going to be the same
age all of today, Mom.

51
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,405
Can all of you stay quiet!

52
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:30,536
Change to the fourth gear.

53
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,916
The Apartment looks
like a Hotel.

54
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,718
Greetings!
Welcome.

55
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,157
Hasn't the Groom come?

56
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:50,818
This is the Groom!

57
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,154
ls he the Groom?

58
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:54,824
He looks like he is coming
straight from the Battlefield!

59
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,590
Please come.

60
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,237
Hey, where are you
running away? Come on!

61
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,769
Please come in...

62
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:15,080
Three people have fallen
for him already.

63
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,738
We have to see the girl before
the auspicious time gets over...

64
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,107
That's why l brought him
directly from the Station.

65
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,345
Please ask the girl to come...

66
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,994
Sit down, dear...

67
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:40,537
Should l ask her to sing?

68
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,098
Any good song...

69
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:43,409
One can only sing the
National Anthem...

70
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,671
...for the clothes
the Groom is in...

71
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,348
Aren't you happy, my Boy!

72
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:31,956
Dad, can you give me
their number?

73
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:33,682
l'll give it to you...

74
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:42,834
Tell me...

75
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:45,636
Don't make noise...
The Groom is on line.

76
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:47,970
Please tell me...

77
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:52,600
Sir, your daughter
looks beautiful...

78
00:15:54,713 --> 00:15:59,946
But, our tastes
seem different...

79
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:03,385
l don't know if we
will be a good match...

80
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,620
But, you will surely find a
better Groom for your daughter...

81
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:11,529
Please don't get me wrong.

82
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,192
Hey!!What is this!!!

83
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:15,456
He is not going to get
married in this lifetime!!

84
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,331
Give me one reason for
not liking this girl!

85
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,138
l have three reasons!

86
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:19,729
What is it?

87
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,040
That girl has hair that is
a meter and a half long!

88
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,072
ls this even a reason?

89
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,968
Even girls with short hair

90
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,878
take ages to set
their hair before going out.

91
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:33,344
lf she has to go out, l am sure, she will
take 3hours just to set her hair.

92
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,020
Did l ask for this? Did l?

93
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:39,823
Did l ask you to
get me married now?

94
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,487
On top of that,
she is shy.

95
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:44,991
Looks like she will be scared
of lizards and cockroaches...

96
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,395
Look at her,
slapping her own Father...

97
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,203
Well!

98
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:56,006
You should have disciplined
her while she was young.

99
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:57,743
You were the one who played
with her...

100
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:59,267
...asking her to ''Hit Daddy''

101
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:01,569
l thought she would be
a stylish girl,

102
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:02,372
but even while she is
in Bombay,

103
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:03,811
she looks like
a small town girl.

104
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:16,989
Why do you need
so much money?

105
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:17,929
l've told my friends

106
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,620
l will host a party
if the Groom doesn't like me!

107
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,504
Once l heard you are
coming here on Leave,

108
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:37,776
l wanted to say l've fallen
ill with Chikungunya...

109
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,112
...and get back home.

110
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,249
Unfortunately,
l wasn't granted Leave.

111
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:44,320
Are you indirectly saying
that l am disturbing you?

112
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:47,523
No one in the world can tell
you this more directly.

113
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,150
And you claim
this is indirect?

114
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,488
That's how smart you are!

115
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,256
Come on!
What did l even do?

116
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:53,328
You?

117
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:55,023
You will come on
a vacation each year.

118
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,532
Hang out with me.

119
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,629
You will interfere
in everything l do.

120
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,168
Just when l am about to get
promoted from...

121
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,002
...being a Sub lnspector (Sl)
to an lnspector,

122
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,606
...you will drag me back to
being an Sl.

123
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,436
Why don't you spend time
..with your family this time?

124
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:09,274
My parents have given me
strict orders,

125
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:10,608
asking me to get out
of the house in the morning

126
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:11,680
...and to return
only at night.

127
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:13,482
They say l'll get spoilt
if l stay at home.

128
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,186
Don't you know that this is
the most atrocious lie ever!

129
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,922
Come on, now. Chuck it!
l will be with you,

130
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,787
but l won't disturb you.
Ok?

131
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:29,467
What function is it?

132
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:31,666
lt's some Tournament.
lt's security for that.

133
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,003
Are the security
arrangements perfect!

134
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:36,002
Don't send them in if they
don't have an ldentity card.

135
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:43,646
Buddy, this is
a ladies' college.

136
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,974
They are all girls
from Mumbai.

137
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:46,173
You can enjoy
their beauty quietly.

138
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:47,343
But, pretend
to be disciplined.

139
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,979
This is a bit too much.

140
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,418
Well! You went to
see a girl yesterday.

141
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,082
What happened?

142
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:05,597
That girl seems very shy.

143
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,232
Not just that,
she seems soft.

144
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,141
l don't like this girl!!!!

145
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:14,104
lsn't she the kind
of girl you expect?

146
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:18,034
This was the girl l saw.

147
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:48,234
That is just not possible!!!!
He has gone mad!

148
00:24:48,513 --> 00:24:50,674
He said he didn't like her,
but now he says he likes her.

149
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,644
He's got hold of a lame
Police dog from somewhere..

150
00:24:53,718 --> 00:24:55,583
...and is trying to please me
saying it's my birthday gift!

151
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:57,852
ls she a Girl or a dish
that you can re-order?

152
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,321
lf we listen to him,
we'll turn crazy!

153
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,048
Hey!Tell them!

154
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,491
We can't talk to them again!
Forget it!

155
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:09,859
What is it?
ls he kidding?

156
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:12,327
He said he didn't like me then.
But, now he likes me!

157
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:15,800
After the wedding, he might
not like me again. ls that ok?

158
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:18,102
lf a boy proposes,
you must right away say

159
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,810
''l love you too''
and try being in ''love''.

160
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,674
lf you don't like him tomorrow,
you can break up with him.

161
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,579
But, you must think
before rejecting him.

162
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:28,909
lt's only when
you are beautiful

163
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,448
and curvaceous that boys
will come after us.

164
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:31,611
ln a few years from now,

165
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,555
we'll put on weight
just like our mothers.

166
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,050
Before a girl says ''No'',

167
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:38,594
they should think
of their mothers.

168
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:40,158
l don't need to do all that.

169
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,064
l'll go the Gym
and make sure l am.

170
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:48,200
He seems like a Tamilian.

171
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:49,770
Should we try saying ''Hi''.?

172
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,440
He is the guy l said ''No'' to.

173
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,409
Hey! Get down!!
Come on, get down!

174
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,552
What are you going to do?

175
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,515
He'll be dead today!!

176
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,950
Why did you kiss me now?

177
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:43,958
Me.?

178
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:49,366
Ya. l only kissed the Mirror.

179
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:50,701
This is my Mirror.

180
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,096
l will do whatever
l like with it.

181
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,861
The Mirror is yours, but
the reflection in it was mine.

182
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,230
That belongs
to the Government.

183
00:26:57,676 --> 00:27:01,009
l will kiss my Mirror,
cajole it, break it.

184
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:02,443
That is up to me.

185
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:04,708
Why should you break it?
l'll break it myself!

186
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,018
No violence, please.
This is a public Road.

187
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:08,713
What cheek you have
to kiss on the Road?

188
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:09,376
What kind of
a Policeman are you?

189
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:10,886
You are sitting there like
a sack of Potatoes!

190
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:12,885
lf l complaint of
eve teasing,

191
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,457
they'll put you behind
bars and beat you up

192
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,528
She is worse than
my Mother-ln-law!

193
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,630
You can enquire about
''Boxer Nisha'' at Shastri Nagar!

194
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:43,213
Had you said you liked her
at the first instant,

195
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:45,179
my bike mirror
would have been saved.

196
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:46,924
lsn't this super?

197
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:50,423
She flicked the Bike keys
as she was talking to us!

198
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,925
She wasn't talking,
she was chiding!

199
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:55,728
What did my Department Bike
have to do with your fight?

200
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:57,060
Thief!
Thief!

201
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:58,960
l had 5000 Rupees
in my purse!!

202
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,860
Where is my purse?!
l had 5000.

203
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,336
Don't panic.

204
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:04,641
The Thief must be
in the Bus.

205
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:07,603
l am a Policeman.
The two of us are Policemen.

206
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:08,939
We'll check everyone.
We'll find out.

207
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:12,447
Driver! Stop the Bus.

208
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:14,347
No one will get down.
We'll check everybody!

209
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:20,452
Balaji, check people here.

210
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,647
l'll check people
on the other side.

211
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,056
Get down, one by one!

212
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:34,836
Sir, that's my purse!

213
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,431
Hey there! ls this yours?
- No, Sir.

214
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:50,348
You go in and check,
check under the seats.

215
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:52,350
Check the Bags as well.

216
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:00,422
Please open the bag.

217
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:17,945
You stole the purse.

218
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:18,778
My purse!!

219
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:21,978
He is the Thief!

220
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:42,733
Why are you running?

221
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:49,477
Why?
Why are you running?

222
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:44,262
lnstead of enquiring
him first,

223
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:46,127
...they are treating him
at the Hospital.

224
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:54,601
Look at him making speeches
with bated breath,

225
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,406
...as though he caught him.

226
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,906
l should have been there.

227
00:31:58,676 --> 00:31:59,836
You dragged me
away from there!

228
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:04,545
Had l appeared on Television,
my Mother-ln-Law would be shaken.

229
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,940
Things would have been
different at home.

230
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:09,016
l would have become
an lnspector!

231
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:16,960
The motive ofTerrorists could
not have been to plant...

232
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:18,518
...a bomb in the
State Transport Bus,

233
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:23,466
but could have gone off unexpectedly,
while in transit to another place.

234
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:25,530
The Minister of Home Affairs
has expressed...

235
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:27,500
...concern over the number of
terrorist like,

236
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:33,937
Ajmal Lateef and their motives

237
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,404
l've been waiting for you.
-Why?

238
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:08,403
Go in, l'll tell you.

239
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:27,452
What is it?
At this time

240
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:30,721
They work with me.
They're off duty now.

241
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:33,254
They will stay on guard here,
just for tonight.

242
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:36,296
Leave to Tamil Nadu with
your family tomorrow morning.

243
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:39,293
Why are you
doing all this?

244
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,960
He has escaped
from the Hospital.

245
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,071
What?

246
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,608
He has killed a Doctor
and two Police Officers.

247
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:48,744
How?

248
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:49,843
l don't know.

249
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:51,208
Fine, you go ahead.

250
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,746
lt was you who caught him;

251
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,715
l suspect he might
come looking for you.

252
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:55,943
They are here anyway.

253
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:57,382
Both of you go
to the rear side.

254
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:58,812
l'll get going.

255
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,949
All Brands have changed
these days.

256
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:07,821
What happened?

257
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:58,861
What did those innocent kids
in the Bus do to you?

258
00:38:08,012 --> 00:38:09,447
Do you know why l
chopped off your finger...

259
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:10,937
...without asking you anything?

260
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,747
l am going to ask you
a question now.

261
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:16,517
lf you don't answer it, you should
know what could happen to you.

262
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:29,058
One question.

263
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,826
Just one second to give me
an answer,

264
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:37,134
else, the other finger
will go as well.

265
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,420
That's all. So simple!

266
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:16,303
Who is it?
- lt's me!

267
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:22,552
Who is it?

268
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:24,784
What are you doing here
at this time?

269
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:27,789
Who is it?
- l am coming.

270
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,192
l am asking you.
What are you doing here?

271
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:33,758
l need to talk to you.

272
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:35,759
Can you come up
to the Terrace?

273
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,065
What do you want
at this hour?

274
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:39,259
We can talk in the morning.

275
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:55,782
The guy you helped escape is
now at my house as my guest.

276
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:59,287
Sorry, l didn't tell you
who l am.

277
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:03,258
My name is Jagdish,
lndian Army.

278
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:05,861
But l am not just that.

279
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,396
One of the specialists at
the Defense lntelligence Agency.

280
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,203
A Secret Agent in the Army.

281
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,035
People who work with me.

282
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:20,641
My friends.

283
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,143
Even my family
doesn't know this.

284
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,845
Are you wondering why
l am telling you this?

285
00:40:29,487 --> 00:40:31,045
Because, you are not going
to be alive any more.

286
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:37,454
While we are at the Camp,
the other Country firing at us

287
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:41,222
and us firing in return
happens often.

288
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,692
One day, at our Camp,
a boy called Selvaraj,

289
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:51,872
a chap from Puddukottai,
went missing.

290
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,402
We looked for him for 7 days
but didn't find him.

291
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:58,846
We found him
on the eighth day.

292
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,214
Poor thing, guess he got
caught in their Camp.

293
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,283
They tortured him for 7 days.

294
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,825
They dug out his eyes,

295
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:18,394
shoved a Beer bottle
through his body

296
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,661
...and broke it inside him.

297
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:23,234
We were the ones

298
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:24,907
who went home and
delivered his dead body.

299
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,207
His Mom was howling,

300
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,144
his Dad was beating
his chest in grief,

301
00:41:30,414 --> 00:41:31,904
his sisters were weeping.

302
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,442
And on the fourteenth day,

303
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:39,489
his younger brother
joined the Military.

304
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:45,327
We die there every day, so that
you guys here can live happily.

305
00:41:57,408 --> 00:41:59,103
This is a locally made Gun.

306
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:02,607
This is my Gun.

307
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,578
lf l shoot you,

308
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,480
l will have to explain
why l did so.

309
00:42:11,288 --> 00:42:14,280
Even when you are dead,
your family will slander you.

310
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:17,989
Your children will have
to beg on the streets.

311
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:23,791
Your wife will have to beckon
men on the roads at night.

312
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:27,097
But, if you shoot yourself,
it would be called a suicide

313
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:33,942
while on duty and someone from
your family will be given a job.

314
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:36,711
They'll get your
Provident Fund money,

315
00:42:37,314 --> 00:42:38,679
the monthly Pension.

316
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:43,510
You take a call.

317
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:50,253
But if that Gun turns
towards me, l'll shoot you.

318
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:16,977
You are playing with Danger.

319
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:55,256
l know the two of you are not
aware of everything.

320
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,771
When?

321
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:06,872
Among us, she is the first one
to be getting married in our group.

322
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:07,807
Oh, yes!

323
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:08,969
She hails from Kallakurichi

324
00:48:09,112 --> 00:48:10,409
but has managed to charm
a man from Gujarat.

325
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:12,078
She's a smart girl!

326
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:21,888
See how she is blushing

327
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:36,005
l have an urgent doubt.

328
00:48:36,273 --> 00:48:37,399
What is it?

329
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:41,376
Please!!! Just come aside
for five minutes.

330
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:44,480
How do l get
away from here?

331
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:48,083
Please! Else, my head
might just burst!!

332
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:51,354
Fine!!!

333
00:48:55,492 --> 00:48:56,356
Just come!!!

334
00:48:58,962 --> 00:48:59,860
What is it?

335
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,225
ln our you are the next
most beautiful girl after me...

336
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:04,328
Fine!We are equally beautiful!

337
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:07,130
Your hostel room is filled with
posters of Ranbir Kapoor,

338
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,830
Shahid Kapoor
and John Abraham.

339
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,410
And now. how did you get
married to a guy like this?

340
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:17,907
Look here, you need
to think practically.

341
00:49:18,048 --> 00:49:19,481
He earns 2 Lacs a month.

342
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:20,911
What more do you want?

343
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:23,751
A handsome guy will
not be an achiever.

344
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,547
An achiever will
not be handsome.

345
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:28,353
Look there.

346
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,616
He's posing for pictures
by himself at our Reception.

347
00:49:31,194 --> 00:49:35,893
What if a guy is handsome
and also earns well?

348
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:38,095
Praise him and
get married to him

349
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:50,446
Why are you sitting
here like this?

350
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,572
l am thinking about something.
lt's not falling in place.

351
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:55,079
Tell me what it is.

352
00:49:55,218 --> 00:49:56,515
Let's see if l can
think of something.

353
00:49:57,054 --> 00:49:58,851
l being a Policeman
can't do it

354
00:49:59,222 --> 00:50:00,189
and here you are
thinking you can!

355
00:50:00,424 --> 00:50:02,915
Do you know the difference between
a Policeman and a Military man?

356
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:05,385
You Military men don't
have to use your brain.

357
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:07,157
You just have to put have your
feet together for''Attention''

358
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:09,166
and split them for
''Stand at ease''.

359
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,861
And if you are told to shoot,
you just have to rapidly.

360
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:13,926
But, we Policemen
have to use our brains.

361
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:16,167
When we are going to
nab a Pick Pocket,

362
00:50:16,273 --> 00:50:18,036
we have to think like him.

363
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:19,975
When we are going
to catch a murderer,

364
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:21,542
we have to think
like a murderer.

365
00:50:21,845 --> 00:50:23,437
And when we are going to
catch a Terrorist,

366
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,147
...we have to turn
in to a Terrorist.

367
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:28,078
l am a Policeman and yet,
struggling.

368
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:29,376
You go ahead and play.

369
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:32,923
Tell me what your problem is,
l'll see if l can help.

370
00:50:32,923 --> 00:50:34,288
l'll tell you,
try and get the drift.

371
00:50:34,691 --> 00:50:37,125
The night that
the Terrorist escaped,

372
00:50:37,561 --> 00:50:40,052
a Police officer shot himself
and committed suicide.

373
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,888
He was on duty when
the Terrorist escaped.

374
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:49,171
My doubt right now is if these two
incidents could have any connection.

375
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:51,533
Firstly, that is not a suicide.
lt's a murder.

376
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,400
How do you say that?

377
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:53,668
l was the one who killed him.

378
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:57,213
Why did you kill him?

379
00:50:57,481 --> 00:50:59,005
Why did he let
the Terrorist escape?

380
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:01,515
He let the Terrorist escape?
How do you know that?

381
00:51:01,618 --> 00:51:02,619
The Terrorist told me that.

382
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:04,610
The Terrorist escaped from the Hospital.
Where did you see him?

383
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:06,786
Well! The Hospital.

384
00:51:07,991 --> 00:51:08,923
The Hospital.?

385
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:16,957
l am asking you
where you saw him.

386
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,202
Tell me what it is!

387
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:28,278
Jagga darling, you know
l can't handle suspense.

388
00:51:28,278 --> 00:51:30,371
Tell me what it is.
- Give me a minute.

389
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:41,721
Tell me.

390
00:51:54,037 --> 00:51:55,868
Are you coming from a class
in spoken English class?

391
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:56,834
No.

392
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,137
Can l marry you?

393
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:02,769
When did you get this idea?

394
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,583
This morning. at 8.40am
-What happened at 8.40am?

395
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:09,748
lt was my friend's reception.

396
00:52:10,187 --> 00:52:11,745
She's the most beautiful
girl in my college.

397
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:14,123
The guy she is marrying
doesn't look one bit good.

398
00:52:14,324 --> 00:52:19,023
l asked her about it and
she gave me some advice.

399
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:21,321
And then,
friends encouraged me.

400
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:26,629
But, we didn't make a good
match right from the start.

401
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:30,271
l said ''No'' at first
and then you did,

402
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:31,971
and now you are saying
you want this.

403
00:52:32,576 --> 00:52:33,975
l am only saying l want it.

404
00:52:34,544 --> 00:52:39,140
Yes, but our tastes
should match.

405
00:52:40,984 --> 00:52:42,952
Do you smoke?
- Huh?

406
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,254
A Cigarette.
- No way! How can girls smoke?

407
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:50,450
That is not allowed in Boxing.

408
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:53,529
See that!
l only like girls who smoke.

409
00:52:58,068 --> 00:53:00,161
Well. l can't say
l've never smoked.

410
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:04,667
l have smoked at Girls parties,
New Year and occasions like that.

411
00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:09,135
What about Drinks?

412
00:53:10,046 --> 00:53:11,570
Liquor, my dear.

413
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:16,742
Yes. Red wine.

414
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:18,921
That's good for
the heart and skin.

415
00:53:19,356 --> 00:53:21,051
l've even tried Vodka once.

416
00:53:21,725 --> 00:53:25,126
See that, l can't stand
girls who drink Liquor.

417
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:34,837
No!! You are saying different
things on purpose.

418
00:53:34,971 --> 00:53:36,461
You are in love with me.

419
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,901
You are purposely doing this
- Nisha, wait..

420
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:41,067
l came here straight from
the wedding,just for you.

421
00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:42,573
l didn't even eat there.

422
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:47,350
lf you want, l can get married
to you right away.

423
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:49,980
l was just kidding.

424
00:53:55,292 --> 00:53:56,554
There is a small hitch.

425
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:58,922
Again? What is it?

426
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:01,390
Because l was angry with you,

427
00:54:01,498 --> 00:54:04,023
l agreed to marry another guy
my parents found for me.

428
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:05,759
You said ''yes'' to him?

429
00:54:06,169 --> 00:54:07,261
That is not a problem.

430
00:54:07,637 --> 00:54:09,832
Saying ''Yes'' at first and
rejecting him after that

431
00:54:10,507 --> 00:54:11,599
...is hardly a problem for me.

432
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:16,302
What l said to you is different
from what l told him.

433
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:17,675
He is from the Military too.

434
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:22,941
lf l convince him,
all problems will be sorted.

435
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,814
He has asked me to come to
the Coffee shop at 12.

436
00:54:25,088 --> 00:54:27,556
Ok! l'll come along too!
l'll take care of it.

437
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:29,224
Shall we leave then?
-Yes.

438
00:54:34,698 --> 00:54:35,528
lt's here.

439
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:38,990
Just wait a moment.

440
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:44,131
He's a Military guy,
he's here on time.

441
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:46,443
l'll go first.
You can come later.

442
00:54:46,443 --> 00:54:49,708
Hey! l'll talk to him first
and then will call

443
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:14,260
Hey, Jagga,
what are you doing here?

444
00:55:14,337 --> 00:55:14,894
How are you?

445
00:55:16,473 --> 00:55:17,838
When l heard the loud voice,

446
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:19,532
l imagined we were
in the Parade ground.

447
00:55:19,976 --> 00:55:20,772
Ok, come on.

448
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:25,712
Well!

449
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:28,880
The girl l am going to marry has
said she would meet me here today.

450
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,912
All this is to meet her...

451
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:35,686
l am nervous because
this is the first time.

452
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:15,893
Please sit down.

453
00:56:18,368 --> 00:56:22,270
Your Mom called to say that
you like me a lot as well.

454
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,372
Sorry, Nisha. Meet Mr.Jagdish.

455
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:36,418
But, he is much junior to me.

456
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:39,047
He makes mistakes and
gets punished very often.

457
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:42,222
He is a little more scared
of me because of that.

458
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:50,799
Nisha, what will you eat?
- No. Nothing!

459
00:56:53,102 --> 00:56:54,126
What about you, Jagdish?

460
00:56:56,072 --> 00:57:00,236
Nisha, l have a get together
at the Hotel this evening.

461
00:57:02,445 --> 00:57:04,037
Jagdish, you must come too.
- Yes, Sir!

462
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:09,682
Now! lt's 12.30.
We said we would meet at 12.

463
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:15,918
So, we'll meet in the evening.

464
00:57:23,032 --> 00:57:24,158
ls he mad?

465
00:57:25,835 --> 00:57:26,631
l'll see you in the evening.

466
00:57:40,316 --> 00:57:41,647
ls this how you planned
to talk to him?

467
00:57:43,453 --> 00:57:44,249
That's not it, Madam.

468
00:57:44,687 --> 00:57:47,247
Whatever it is,
you are his fiance.

469
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:48,947
Hey! even after he left,
you are calling me ''Madam''

470
00:57:49,225 --> 00:57:50,658
Aren't we in love already.

471
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,857
We can break up with each other.

472
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,563
We've not been in love even
for an hour;

473
00:57:56,032 --> 00:57:57,590
and a break up before that?

474
00:57:57,967 --> 00:57:58,934
Look here, Madam.

475
00:57:59,168 --> 00:58:00,795
He is better than me
in every way.

476
00:58:01,404 --> 00:58:03,702
lt takes me 52 seconds
to run 400 meters,

477
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:04,966
but he can do that
in 48 seconds.

478
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:05,942
ln a High jump,

479
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:07,034
l can get across a height of
6 feet and 1 inch,

480
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:08,474
but he can cover 6 feet
and 4 inches?

481
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:10,239
ln the Long jump,
l can leap across only 7 meters,

482
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,540
but he is 7.4 meters.

483
00:58:11,948 --> 00:58:12,539
ln Weight lifting...

484
00:58:13,683 --> 00:58:15,275
ls someone recruiting people
for the Military here?

485
00:58:15,418 --> 00:58:16,646
l don't like him.

486
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,445
But, you didn't like me
at first either,

487
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:20,351
but you like me now.

488
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,048
You don't like him now,
but you could like him tomorrow.

489
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:26,489
They are two
different things.

490
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:29,460
Not just that.
l can find a match easily.

491
00:58:29,732 --> 00:58:33,224
But who will marry him
at this age.

492
00:58:33,536 --> 00:58:35,629
What do l do for that, why me?

493
00:58:36,573 --> 00:58:37,562
Your phone is ringing.

494
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:38,537
lt's your phone.

495
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,772
Hey!Where did you see the Terrorist
who escaped from the Hospital?

496
00:58:48,785 --> 00:58:50,013
You don't like suspense,

497
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,217
but l don't like to
unravel the suspense.

498
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,251
The two of us have an
important job to do tomorrow.

499
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:12,865
Hey!Why are you
sitting here?

500
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:15,007
Like you don't know
why l've come!

501
01:04:16,379 --> 01:04:17,038
lt's not that.

502
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:18,578
Don't come in to
my room all of a sudden.

503
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:20,111
Wait downstairs and call me.

504
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:22,810
Where did you see
that Terrorist?

505
01:04:37,233 --> 01:04:39,326
How did you catch the guy
who escaped from the Hospital?

506
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:42,567
After you left that day,
l stayed back at the Hospital.

507
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,336
We shouldn't keep him here,

508
01:04:45,474 --> 01:04:46,498
we must hand him
over to the Police.

509
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:48,069
For him to escape again?

510
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,837
Only then will we know how
many more of them are around.

511
01:04:50,246 --> 01:04:51,975
l know what to do.
-What do you know?

512
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:54,241
Why are you taking
the lnjection?

513
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:55,949
Do you have fever?

514
01:04:58,888 --> 01:04:59,786
Tell me why.

515
01:05:00,623 --> 01:05:01,647
What is it?

516
01:05:02,391 --> 01:05:03,358
Don't untie him.

517
01:05:06,262 --> 01:05:07,320
Where are you going?

518
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:08,920
How many questions
will you ask?

519
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:13,035
l've injected him
with Ketamine.

520
01:05:13,402 --> 01:05:15,336
He will remain
unconscious for two hours.

521
01:05:15,504 --> 01:05:16,027
Let's go.

522
01:05:16,238 --> 01:05:17,170
Where do we go?

523
01:05:17,273 --> 01:05:18,069
To the Wedding.

524
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:19,534
My Batch mate is
getting married today.

525
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:20,573
Let's go.

526
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:21,940
This is a bit too much.

527
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:23,705
You want to keep him at home
and go out to attend a wedding?

528
01:05:24,013 --> 01:05:24,809
You've even untied him.

529
01:05:25,014 --> 01:05:26,072
We'll come back.

530
01:06:06,122 --> 01:06:07,180
lt's getting late,
let's leave.

531
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,254
Who is this?

532
01:06:39,755 --> 01:06:41,052
Hey, Jagga. Let's leave.

533
01:06:41,157 --> 01:06:42,419
We'll leave.
What's the hurry?

534
01:06:42,558 --> 01:06:43,422
lt's getting late.

535
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:49,161
Hey, let's go.

536
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:50,424
Come!

537
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:51,996
Why don't you understand
the seriousness?

538
01:06:57,907 --> 01:06:58,874
He is not even looking!

539
01:07:09,085 --> 01:07:12,714
You are eating Cake!!
lt's getting late!

540
01:07:27,036 --> 01:07:28,162
He wants to play,
be it the Camp or...

541
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:30,336
...where the Train stops
now even at the Wedding.

542
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:58,462
Guys, this is a serious game.

543
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:02,003
We'll know who the other
team is only in a while.

544
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:03,835
ln two minutes from now,

545
01:08:04,173 --> 01:08:07,267
a man will come out of
the back door of my house.

546
01:08:08,878 --> 01:08:10,971
We will follow him.

547
01:08:11,413 --> 01:08:12,903
When he meets a man
after that,

548
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:14,680
our group will split
into two.

549
01:08:15,284 --> 01:08:16,581
One group of 6 will
follow one man.

550
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,811
the next 6 will
follow the other.

551
01:08:19,421 --> 01:08:21,616
As they keep meeting
more people after that,

552
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:25,089
we will divide further
and follow them.

553
01:08:25,528 --> 01:08:27,962
Keep your cell phones on.

554
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,721
Don't attend any
other call but mine.

555
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:34,466
We will stay connected
through a conference call.

556
01:08:43,913 --> 01:08:46,575
He is coming.
- ls he the guy?

557
01:08:53,622 --> 01:08:55,817
Jagga, what if we land up
taking a big risk?

558
01:08:56,926 --> 01:08:58,154
lt's a risk only if
we don't do anything.

559
01:08:59,695 --> 01:09:02,528
Start the vehicle and
slowly follow him.

560
01:09:58,287 --> 01:09:59,276
Who is the other guy?

561
01:10:05,694 --> 01:10:08,720
Jagga. What if they don't split
as 12 but stay at one place?

562
01:10:09,131 --> 01:10:11,531
No, they have work at 12 places.

563
01:10:12,935 --> 01:10:13,526
They will split.

564
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:15,568
Stop the vehicle.

565
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:44,392
You follow him.

566
01:13:00,869 --> 01:13:04,100
Boys! We are 12 of us
for 12 of them.

567
01:13:04,907 --> 01:13:06,204
The game is going to end now.

568
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:09,042
Look at the Case in your bag.

569
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:11,573
There is a gun inside
There is a gun

570
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:15,475
Let no one panic.

571
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:18,143
l was the one who kept it.

572
01:13:18,821 --> 01:13:21,346
The guys in front of you
are no ordinary thieves.

573
01:13:22,491 --> 01:13:24,425
We are only going to do
what we do at the Border.

574
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:26,718
We'll show them that
we also know their...

575
01:13:26,862 --> 01:13:29,797
techniques of serial bomb blasts
and simultaneous blasts.

576
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:32,000
We should attack them
at the same time,

577
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,365
without a seconds' difference.

578
01:14:05,934 --> 01:14:07,663
The game is over.
We'll meet in the Train.

579
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:08,701
When is the Party?

580
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:09,463
There's time for that.

581
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,299
We'll take care of it
in the Camp.

582
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:11,267
What happened?

583
01:14:37,566 --> 01:14:39,966
As of today,
the most threataning issue...

584
01:14:40,669 --> 01:14:41,837
...is about the sleeper cells.

585
01:14:41,837 --> 01:14:43,771
Who are these sleeper cells?

586
01:14:44,406 --> 01:14:46,033
Sleeper cells are
present at places

587
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:48,306
Where terrorism is a challenge

588
01:14:48,677 --> 01:14:50,269
We can't identify them, because..

589
01:14:50,646 --> 01:14:54,605
Even these 12 men have led
a normal life with the public

590
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:58,284
They are people who have druid
against the country and the government

591
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,615
They are cultivated for years.

592
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:05,085
And their grudge is misused
for terrorist activities

593
01:15:05,227 --> 01:15:07,889
After 9/1 1 the U S is free
from terrorism because..

594
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:10,162
...only in that country
sleeper cell

595
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:12,494
have been identified and
destroyed completely.

596
01:15:12,701 --> 01:15:14,259
..and their further growth
was arrested

597
01:15:20,842 --> 01:15:22,104
Mom, Dad

598
01:15:49,538 --> 01:15:50,937
Who did all this?

599
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:52,438
lt is still unknown

600
01:15:53,642 --> 01:15:55,234
Even the policemen are clueless

601
01:15:56,712 --> 01:15:57,872
Did you get any clue?

602
01:15:58,413 --> 01:16:01,940
The police has seized the equipments
of all the 12 sleeper cells

603
01:16:02,384 --> 01:16:04,978
But the non tracker phone
that belonged to one of them...

604
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,888
..has been taken by the person
who killed him.

605
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:10,992
Whose phone is it?

606
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,923
Adzar Ali, the who was
killed at Dhobi Ghat

607
01:18:03,505 --> 01:18:05,632
Hey, come to
Lake View Caf, immediately.

608
01:18:07,275 --> 01:18:09,209
lf Sir gets to know,
he will mistake us.

609
01:18:09,344 --> 01:18:11,403
lt is your ''Sir''
who is asked to come, hurry up.

610
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:20,882
Why are you standing here alone,
where is Sir?

611
01:18:21,256 --> 01:18:22,348
Look there.

612
01:18:27,262 --> 01:18:28,820
So, has he found another girl?

613
01:18:28,964 --> 01:18:29,726
That's enough!

614
01:18:30,265 --> 01:18:32,324
He has found that
girl for you!

615
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:35,533
For me.?

616
01:18:35,937 --> 01:18:37,700
As it is, he is posing
a problem for me...

617
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,937
and now he is soliciting
women for you!

618
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:43,067
Don't say such things
about older people.

619
01:18:43,478 --> 01:18:45,173
Have some respect for his age
and marry him.

620
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,442
Come on!

621
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:58,388
Jagdish also came home for
the Holidays,

622
01:18:58,493 --> 01:18:59,960
...to find a girl to marry.

623
01:19:00,529 --> 01:19:02,588
Unfortunately,
nothing worked out for him.

624
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:11,396
He's junior to me,
but he's more like family.Well!

625
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,305
l am like an elder
brother to him.

626
01:19:13,642 --> 01:19:15,439
No no..something more then that..

627
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:17,608
l am like an Uncle to him.

628
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:19,610
l was just saying that.

629
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:21,011
ls it? Wow!

630
01:19:22,117 --> 01:19:23,709
Sorry! l forgot
to introduce you.

631
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:32,251
l've seen you somewhere.

632
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,019
That's right.

633
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:38,366
l had the same doubt
when l saw her the first time.

634
01:19:38,366 --> 01:19:39,924
That is when
l thought of Jagdish.

635
01:19:40,502 --> 01:19:43,369
As his Uncle,
l owe him atleast this.

636
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:47,431
The two of you exchange numbers,
talk to each other.

637
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,434
Check to see if you have some
Biology going between each other.

638
01:19:51,012 --> 01:19:53,071
lt's not Biology,
it is Chemistry.

639
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:55,607
Whatever it is,
they're both Sciences.

640
01:19:56,585 --> 01:19:58,746
l want to speak
to him in private.

641
01:20:00,155 --> 01:20:01,588
They should talk to
each other in private,

642
01:20:01,857 --> 01:20:04,382
if you want to talk,
that should be with me.

643
01:20:07,162 --> 01:20:09,995
l want to encourage him
about that girl.

644
01:20:10,832 --> 01:20:14,097
Ok. Carry on. l get it now.

645
01:20:15,136 --> 01:20:16,034
Will you come?

646
01:20:17,606 --> 01:20:20,200
Sir. She is calling me
right in front of you.

647
01:20:20,442 --> 01:20:21,773
There's nothing wrong
with that, Jagdish.

648
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:23,069
She's calling you when
l am around,

649
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:24,643
it's wrong only if she calls you
when l am not there.

650
01:20:24,846 --> 01:20:27,144
You must not go along then. Ok?
You can go now.

651
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:31,010
What you are doing is wrong!

652
01:20:31,586 --> 01:20:34,282
We are just trying
to start a conversation,

653
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:36,287
but you are trying to
meddle with this right away.

654
01:20:36,558 --> 01:20:37,650
Do you know who she is?

655
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:39,320
l don't know who she is. Why?

656
01:20:39,427 --> 01:20:40,553
She is like a Call Girl.

657
01:20:41,096 --> 01:20:43,223
What?
What do you mean?

658
01:20:43,765 --> 01:20:44,697
Don't you know?

659
01:20:45,433 --> 01:20:47,298
Do you have a internet
connection on your phone?

660
01:20:48,436 --> 01:20:49,198
l do.

661
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:51,837
Then, log on to www.desigirl.com

662
01:21:01,549 --> 01:21:02,481
What are you going to do now?

663
01:21:04,386 --> 01:21:07,412
l can't go against
my senior's command.

664
01:21:07,956 --> 01:21:09,685
He will feel dejected.

665
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,320
Are you fine with that girl, then?

666
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:24,762
Well, Jagdish, another thing.

667
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:25,669
Another.?

668
01:21:26,408 --> 01:21:29,969
l mean. The earlier you discuss
this with your family...

669
01:21:30,111 --> 01:21:31,408
... and arrive at a decision,
the better.

670
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:35,505
l want the four of us to get
married at the same time...

671
01:21:35,617 --> 01:21:38,415
... and at the same wedding hall.

672
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:39,678
That is my wish.

673
01:23:10,412 --> 01:23:12,437
What is the height of the wall?

674
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:15,347
They are good jumpers

675
01:23:19,554 --> 01:23:20,851
What is the speed of the bus?

676
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:28,428
And good swimmer too

677
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:33,233
All of the have been
shot on their forehead.

678
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:36,396
Running bus

679
01:23:37,539 --> 01:23:38,528
Dark theatre

680
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:39,899
Fully crowed malls

681
01:23:40,742 --> 01:23:43,870
Even at a distance of 200 meters,
they have been shot on their forehead.

682
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:51,808
But they are not the police

683
01:23:53,088 --> 01:23:54,385
Any other similarities?

684
01:24:01,029 --> 01:24:02,519
There is something in common

685
01:24:03,098 --> 01:24:04,588
But its not of any use

686
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:07,698
All twelve were
wearing suits and coats

687
01:24:16,144 --> 01:24:17,270
What did you say?

688
01:24:18,413 --> 01:24:20,779
All twelve were
wearing suits and coats

689
01:24:22,383 --> 01:24:23,975
This you should have
told me first.

690
01:24:24,486 --> 01:24:27,751
l thought is common
to wear coats

691
01:24:29,257 --> 01:24:31,191
Wearing coats in America
is quite common

692
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:35,589
But wearing suit in
lndia is quite uncommon

693
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:39,363
So, team wearing suit and coats.

694
01:24:40,835 --> 01:24:42,598
They could be waiters
from a hotel

695
01:24:43,538 --> 01:24:45,733
Businessmen from board meeting

696
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:48,409
Softwere engineers from a seminar

697
01:24:59,154 --> 01:25:00,985
l need an entire list of
wedding and seminars

698
01:25:01,322 --> 01:25:06,191
With formal dress code that
look place in mumbai on the 27th

699
01:25:10,965 --> 01:25:12,296
Do you think
you did something clever?

700
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,835
Had you caught
those 12 guys alive,

701
01:25:13,835 --> 01:25:15,826
...instead of killing them imagine the
amount of information you could have got!

702
01:25:16,104 --> 01:25:17,628
We wouldn't have
got any information,

703
01:25:17,906 --> 01:25:19,635
...because they themselves
don't know the plan.

704
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:23,737
ln fact, the 12 guys
don't even know each other.

705
01:25:24,145 --> 01:25:24,804
ls that?

706
01:25:25,413 --> 01:25:26,710
Yes, they are Sleeper Cells.

707
01:25:27,248 --> 01:25:30,513
One or may be two of their
Heads will make the plan.

708
01:25:31,052 --> 01:25:32,451
The Sleeper Cells merely execute

709
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:35,418
...and will even be willing
to lose their lives for it.

710
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:37,691
Even if one of them
does get caught,

711
01:25:37,825 --> 01:25:39,588
there is nothing we can
get to know through him.

712
01:25:39,794 --> 01:25:41,694
Does that mean Sleeper Cells
carry on lives...

713
01:25:41,863 --> 01:25:43,228
...as normal people
until they get orders?

714
01:25:43,398 --> 01:25:45,525
Yes, they will wait for years.

715
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,429
ls there no way
we can kill them all?

716
01:25:48,336 --> 01:25:51,635
We can't kill them, but we can
stop them from functioning.

717
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:55,599
lf we kill the main head
who gives the orders,

718
01:25:56,211 --> 01:26:00,375
these guys will keep waiting
for orders all their lives.

719
01:26:00,582 --> 01:26:01,276
That's fine.

720
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:03,043
But, how will you search for
the leader? who gives out orders.

721
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:04,849
l don't have to go in
search of him.

722
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,844
l've made him come in
search of me.

723
01:26:07,322 --> 01:26:11,349
lf we killed the 12 of them,
he would retaliate by attacking us.

724
01:26:11,492 --> 01:26:12,584
That was my assessment.

725
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:14,523
l was right.
He's out to get me.

726
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:15,889
Oh, my God!

727
01:26:16,097 --> 01:26:18,861
But, how will he find you
in a big city like Mumbai?

728
01:26:21,002 --> 01:26:22,731
While killing the 12,

729
01:26:23,671 --> 01:26:26,504
we would have surely left
behind some kind of a clue.

730
01:26:27,842 --> 01:26:29,207
He will work
towards finding that.

731
01:26:29,944 --> 01:26:31,935
lf we find out what that is,

732
01:26:32,614 --> 01:26:34,878
we can catch him
before he attacks us.

733
01:26:35,049 --> 01:26:36,710
Then, think of the route
he will take.

734
01:26:38,453 --> 01:26:39,385
Think about it.

735
01:26:39,921 --> 01:26:41,522
You will usually have a
million different thoughts.

736
01:26:41,522 --> 01:26:43,387
Come up with something.

737
01:26:48,062 --> 01:26:49,723
Hey, Jagga, don't attend
that call. lt must be her.

738
01:26:50,865 --> 01:26:51,797
Jagga, don't.

739
01:26:54,469 --> 01:26:55,697
l have shocking news for you.

740
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:56,932
So, you've started again.

741
01:26:57,071 --> 01:26:58,095
l didn't starting anything.

742
01:26:58,406 --> 01:27:01,000
Your senior officer has asked the
both of us to come over to his house.

743
01:27:02,043 --> 01:27:03,032
l am coming.

744
01:27:03,778 --> 01:27:05,302
Jagga, this is wrong.

745
01:27:05,713 --> 01:27:07,305
Look at what are you doing
amidst our important work

746
01:27:07,482 --> 01:27:09,677
Don't run behind a girl,
sit here and think of something.

747
01:27:23,564 --> 01:27:26,692
l am going to tell you something
that will shock both of you.

748
01:27:27,635 --> 01:27:29,102
The first one is for Jagdish.

749
01:27:30,104 --> 01:27:35,542
The girl you met the other day,
Shwetha, she doesn't like you.

750
01:27:37,345 --> 01:27:38,073
What happened?

751
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:39,338
He claims to be shocked.

752
01:27:41,182 --> 01:27:43,776
Before l tell you the shocking
news that concerns you,

753
01:27:44,619 --> 01:27:45,643
...you need to meet someone.

754
01:27:46,154 --> 01:27:48,122
Please wait,
l'll be back.

755
01:28:06,207 --> 01:28:07,231
Why did you laughing?

756
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:10,639
l got away from the Call girl!!

757
01:28:10,778 --> 01:28:12,143
l was laughed at that.

758
01:28:13,348 --> 01:28:14,144
But, why did you laugh?

759
01:28:14,515 --> 01:28:16,642
Even a Call girl said
she doesn't like you.

760
01:28:29,564 --> 01:28:30,588
Come here.

761
01:28:31,065 --> 01:28:32,930
l don't know which
website she is from!!

762
01:28:39,607 --> 01:28:40,665
She is my Uncle's daughter.

763
01:28:42,176 --> 01:28:44,337
She has been in love with me
since she was a little girl.

764
01:28:44,645 --> 01:28:46,408
But, l didn't know about it.

765
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:55,380
She attempted suicide when
she got to know l was marrying you.

766
01:28:57,558 --> 01:28:58,354
Sit down.

767
01:28:59,794 --> 01:29:00,852
She was admitted
in the Hospital.

768
01:29:00,995 --> 01:29:01,962
lt became a big problem.

769
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:04,764
l've arrived at a decision.

770
01:29:07,135 --> 01:29:08,932
l've decided to marry her.

771
01:29:13,007 --> 01:29:16,272
l know how shocking
this will be to you.

772
01:29:17,378 --> 01:29:22,406
lt is wrong that l encouraged
your feelings for me.

773
01:29:28,156 --> 01:29:29,783
Hey. These things happen in life.

774
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,687
l am going to ask
the two of you for something.

775
01:29:35,863 --> 01:29:39,128
You came to Mumbai with
dreams of getting married.

776
01:29:41,269 --> 01:29:44,397
And you wished to marry
a Military man.

777
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,498
Why don't the two of you
get married?

778
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,372
Don't get me wrong.

779
01:29:53,815 --> 01:29:57,774
We were in love,
but never once did l touch her.

780
01:29:58,352 --> 01:29:59,614
Have we ever
touched each other?

781
01:30:00,087 --> 01:30:01,315
Ask her.We haven't.

782
01:30:02,523 --> 01:30:06,084
l know you will find it
difficult to forget me.

783
01:30:07,395 --> 01:30:08,760
Can l be faulted
for being handsome?

784
01:30:09,464 --> 01:30:10,431
Nothing!!

785
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:15,602
He responds like this
for everything! Fine!

786
01:30:28,883 --> 01:30:30,373
Because you couldn't marry me,

787
01:30:30,785 --> 01:30:36,417
don't rush to any hasty decision
the way she did.

788
01:30:37,158 --> 01:30:38,716
ls that a promise?
- l promise.

789
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,767
What happened?
ls someone unwell at home?

790
01:35:58,746 --> 01:35:59,770
lt's our first date.

791
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,047
As per rules of dating,

792
01:36:01,182 --> 01:36:04,709
l can't refuse anything a
boyfriend asks of me.

793
01:36:05,252 --> 01:36:06,583
That is why l am scared.

794
01:36:07,021 --> 01:36:11,720
Hey! Come on! You've already
spent a lot of money for.

795
01:36:11,859 --> 01:36:13,349
l don't want anything,
don't be scared.

796
01:36:15,396 --> 01:36:16,090
Not that.

797
01:36:16,797 --> 01:36:19,425
What if you ask me
for a kiss?

798
01:36:20,534 --> 01:36:23,230
How can l refuse that?

799
01:36:23,971 --> 01:36:25,029
l have to kiss you.

800
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:31,068
You're right.
l want a kiss.

801
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:35,879
Come on! Oh, my! lt turned out
just how l feared it would be

802
01:36:41,755 --> 01:36:43,882
l don't know how to kiss.

803
01:36:44,425 --> 01:36:46,586
Close your eyes.
l'll take care of it.

804
01:37:18,692 --> 01:37:21,559
l have found the clue
on how he will get to us.

805
01:37:33,374 --> 01:37:36,036
How will he know
we left from Church?

806
01:37:36,777 --> 01:37:41,146
The only similarity the 12
shoot outs have is the Dress Code.

807
01:37:41,815 --> 01:37:43,749
lf he is intelligent,
he will come straight to Church.

808
01:37:43,918 --> 01:37:44,816
Then hurry up

809
01:37:58,198 --> 01:37:59,825
Out of at the events
that took place on the 27th

810
01:38:00,267 --> 01:38:02,098
The marriage that look place
at this church is...

811
01:38:02,236 --> 01:38:03,601
...the only event that
connected with our list.

812
01:38:04,071 --> 01:38:06,335
Because the groom was
an army man

813
01:39:08,702 --> 01:39:11,136
Will they give out
the address to anyone?

814
01:39:11,271 --> 01:39:12,738
Don't they have to call
the people concerned.

815
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,037
We don't have time
for that. Let's go.

816
01:39:54,948 --> 01:39:56,882
Uncle, but you have
five teams here.

817
01:40:09,663 --> 01:40:11,153
We got stucked in the end

818
01:40:11,298 --> 01:40:14,062
How to find one
out of five teams?

819
01:40:15,335 --> 01:40:16,427
l will find him

820
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,935
Which camp did you
serve with Joel?

821
01:40:55,309 --> 01:40:56,708
Kashmir which year?

822
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:01,111
He was at Delhi in 2005

823
01:41:01,748 --> 01:41:03,443
After that he has not been
to Kashmir

824
01:41:05,052 --> 01:41:06,451
Can i see your l.D Card

825
01:41:15,629 --> 01:41:18,291
Dad, will you let anyone inside
without checking about them?

826
01:41:18,799 --> 01:41:20,960
They don't seem to know
anything about his work.

827
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:23,431
l hate smart people.

828
01:41:55,702 --> 01:41:58,466
He is faster than
l thought he will be.

829
01:42:20,394 --> 01:42:21,952
Why have he
circled everything?

830
01:42:25,132 --> 01:42:28,431
He has picked one person per team to
find out of five which team it is.

831
01:42:29,503 --> 01:42:30,561
That is why he have marked this.

832
01:42:40,814 --> 01:42:46,411
lntelligence Reports say
you are in danger. Are you safe?

833
01:42:48,922 --> 01:42:49,946
There's no problem.

834
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:53,489
Just be careful,
if there's a problem, call me.

835
01:43:01,868 --> 01:43:02,698
lf l do have a problem,

836
01:43:02,803 --> 01:43:03,701
l'll surely call you.

837
01:43:08,408 --> 01:43:11,002
What is this?
Everyone he has marked is safe.

838
01:43:12,813 --> 01:43:15,907
That is more dangerous.
lf our guess is wrong,

839
01:43:16,583 --> 01:43:18,608
it only means
he is making another plan.

840
01:44:14,608 --> 01:44:16,667
Jagdish, this is Amar Singh.

841
01:44:17,144 --> 01:44:18,839
Someone kidnapped
my brother's daughter.

842
01:44:20,414 --> 01:44:21,176
What are you saying?

843
01:44:22,015 --> 01:44:24,074
Yes, she went jogging
with her friend this morning.

844
01:44:24,418 --> 01:44:25,976
Someone forcefully dragged her
in to a vehicle.

845
01:44:26,486 --> 01:44:28,681
Make a complaint at your
Police Station right away.

846
01:44:28,955 --> 01:44:30,149
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.

847
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:37,622
What happened, Jagga?

848
01:44:37,764 --> 01:44:40,392
They know they can't get
any information out of torturing

849
01:44:40,967 --> 01:44:42,093
an Army man; hence, they are
kidnapping the girls in their house.

850
01:44:42,302 --> 01:44:43,200
Why?

851
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:45,497
To identify the Team that
killed the 12 of them.

852
01:44:45,939 --> 01:44:47,634
They'll kidnap them and then
threaten us over the phone.

853
01:44:47,808 --> 01:44:51,073
l'll send you the numbers of the
5 people he has marked in the Album.

854
01:44:51,745 --> 01:44:55,772
Call their families and get
the numbers of the girls

855
01:44:55,949 --> 01:44:58,747
who are not home right now.
Go to your Control room

856
01:44:59,286 --> 01:45:01,516
and find out which area
the SlM cards are travelling to.

857
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:11,454
What is its

858
01:45:11,732 --> 01:45:12,332
Where are you?

859
01:45:12,332 --> 01:45:13,663
l am going to Designing Class.

860
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:15,561
Which area?
- Powai... why?

861
01:45:31,918 --> 01:45:34,421
My sister hasn't returned from
Yoga class this morning.

862
01:45:34,421 --> 01:45:35,854
She hasn't returned yet Someone
has kidnapped her in a car,

863
01:45:36,456 --> 01:45:37,650
sent from home

864
01:45:46,233 --> 01:45:48,224
Jagga, l was about to call you.

865
01:45:48,769 --> 01:45:52,466
One out of the 5 mobile numbers
has already been deactivated.

866
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:54,474
Another cell
has been deactivated now.

867
01:45:54,474 --> 01:45:55,463
l just got a call.

868
01:45:55,942 --> 01:45:57,603
They've kidnapped another girl
in 45 minutes.

869
01:45:57,711 --> 01:45:59,804
We need to ask for
a massive Police contingent.

870
01:46:00,013 --> 01:46:01,446
Their family has given a
Police complaint.

871
01:46:01,548 --> 01:46:03,150
Don't do anything
to confuse things.

872
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:04,344
What are you going to do?

873
01:46:04,584 --> 01:46:05,278
l'll tell you.

874
01:46:06,019 --> 01:46:07,987
Where did the second phone
get de-activated?

875
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:10,123
The SlM card has been removed
at South Mumbai,

876
01:46:10,123 --> 01:46:12,648
4 Kilometers away
from where she studies.

877
01:46:12,759 --> 01:46:14,522
Even the SlM card of the
other girl who went missing
the area.

878
01:46:17,264 --> 01:46:19,027
You leave to
immediately.

879
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:20,333
l'll join you on the way.

880
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:23,703
Jagga, let's call the other
3 girls and warn them

881
01:46:23,703 --> 01:46:25,170
not to go not alone

882
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:26,873
Don't do anything
and mess things up.

883
01:46:26,873 --> 01:46:29,933
The Sleeper Cell Head is far
more important than the 5 girls.

884
01:46:45,325 --> 01:46:47,623
My sister went to College
for a Seminar,

885
01:46:47,928 --> 01:46:49,020
she isn't back yet.

886
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,819
The fourth girl has also
gone missing,

887
01:46:51,298 --> 01:46:52,356
Just one more to go.

888
01:47:05,245 --> 01:47:07,145
The fifth girl
has gone missing too! Yes!!

889
01:47:07,414 --> 01:47:09,473
Are you human?
You are a sadist!!

890
01:47:09,616 --> 01:47:11,709
Are you even feeling bad that
the girls have gone missing?

891
01:47:11,952 --> 01:47:14,020
You want to kill
the Head of the Sleeper Cell.

892
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:15,385
That is the only thing
that's important to you.

893
01:47:15,522 --> 01:47:18,423
Balaji, try and understand
this. By killing that one man,

894
01:47:18,658 --> 01:47:21,183
Mumbai city will not have
terrorist acts for the many years.

895
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:23,625
So you using the Girls' lives
as baits?

896
01:47:23,763 --> 01:47:25,594
Did you even think of what
their families will go through?

897
01:47:26,333 --> 01:47:27,459
We don't have the time
for that now.

898
01:47:27,667 --> 01:47:30,158
You will not say this if someone
from your family was kidnapped.

899
01:47:30,437 --> 01:47:32,803
Yes, l don't
care about anything else.

900
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:36,971
My sister is one the girls
they've kidnapped.

901
01:47:38,712 --> 01:47:40,577
He will keep all the
kidnapped girls in one place.

902
01:47:41,214 --> 01:47:43,341
We have to save them
and get him as well.

903
01:47:44,117 --> 01:47:46,745
instead of Ashraf's sister,
the person in the 4th photograph.

904
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,816
l sent my sister Sanjana
Where are you?

905
01:47:49,923 --> 01:47:51,858
l am going to Designing class.
-Which area?

906
01:47:51,858 --> 01:47:52,984
Powai.
Why?

907
01:47:54,594 --> 01:47:56,186
Go to lBS College now...

908
01:47:56,363 --> 01:47:58,763
...and bring my team mate
Ashraf's sister's Anisha's Bike.

909
01:47:59,132 --> 01:48:00,622
Why should l bring her Bike?

910
01:48:01,268 --> 01:48:02,235
Do what l ask you to.

911
01:48:03,436 --> 01:48:05,996
Fine! There is a 40 percent Off
Sale at Levis.

912
01:48:06,172 --> 01:48:07,969
Will you buy me a
pair of three fourths?

913
01:48:09,009 --> 01:48:09,998
Fine, you hurry.

914
01:48:25,892 --> 01:48:28,417
Are you mad?
Sanjana is a young girl!

915
01:48:28,662 --> 01:48:31,597
l am getting scared myself.
How can you do this being her brother?

916
01:48:32,766 --> 01:48:33,926
l won't let them escape.

917
01:48:35,902 --> 01:48:37,062
Why did you ask her to come?

918
01:48:51,284 --> 01:48:52,842
This is Sanjana's Dupatta.

919
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:56,052
Buy me a Maroon colored Top, it
should have embroidery on the sides.

920
01:49:03,463 --> 01:49:04,623
You try searching with dog,

921
01:49:04,731 --> 01:49:06,790
l will look around for
anything suspicious. Let's see.

922
01:49:43,336 --> 01:49:44,428
Untie them

923
01:49:51,845 --> 01:49:53,176
Project the photo one by one

924
01:49:55,649 --> 01:49:56,707
Who knows him?

925
01:50:02,188 --> 01:50:03,348
He is my brother.

926
01:50:04,591 --> 01:50:05,683
Go that side.

927
01:50:14,434 --> 01:50:15,298
That's my Uncle.

928
01:50:30,183 --> 01:50:31,081
Who is this?

929
01:50:32,986 --> 01:50:33,816
ls he your Brother?

930
01:50:36,556 --> 01:50:37,420
Yours?

931
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:38,385
No.

932
01:50:45,598 --> 01:50:46,792
Show the other photograph.

933
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:51,002
This is my Brother.

934
01:51:02,816 --> 01:51:04,875
ls your Brother one among
these 5 people?

935
01:51:06,352 --> 01:51:07,182
No.

936
01:51:08,321 --> 01:51:10,221
Show the group photos one by one.

937
01:51:17,664 --> 01:51:19,097
ls your Brother in this group?

938
01:51:37,217 --> 01:51:38,206
That one?

939
01:51:47,494 --> 01:51:49,086
Who asked you to get
the Bike of the girl...

940
01:51:49,195 --> 01:51:50,958
...who was going
to be kidnapped?

941
01:51:52,632 --> 01:51:53,530
My Brother asked me to.

942
01:52:10,049 --> 01:52:10,913
Tell me

943
01:52:11,151 --> 01:52:14,643
The operation in over
We have found the team

944
01:52:15,355 --> 01:52:18,950
One of them has replaced
and sent his sister on purpose

945
01:52:20,093 --> 01:52:24,496
We removed all their sim cards
There is no way he can find us

946
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,826
lf he has sent his sister,
he has a route yo reach you.

947
01:52:30,036 --> 01:52:32,129
He will get to you.
-What are you saying?

948
01:52:32,405 --> 01:52:35,340
Before he comes Kill that girl
and get out of that place.

949
01:52:37,577 --> 01:52:40,341
Get ready, all of you.
Tie up the 4 girls.

950
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:43,048
Tie this girl up and
bring her here. Hurry up!!

951
01:53:54,821 --> 01:53:55,719
He has come

952
01:53:57,557 --> 01:53:58,888
He is trying
to kill everyone.

953
01:56:38,885 --> 01:56:40,045
You got me caught on purpose,
didn't you?

954
01:56:41,087 --> 01:56:42,247
Hey, it hurts!

955
01:56:42,422 --> 01:56:44,219
He held a huge Knife against me!
Right here.

956
01:56:44,624 --> 01:56:46,114
He might have pulled it out.

957
01:56:46,726 --> 01:56:50,389
Only because we risked lives
could we catch him.

958
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:52,630
You should have risked
your life for that.

959
01:56:52,965 --> 01:56:53,693
What did l do?

960
01:56:55,001 --> 01:56:57,629
Do only Policemen and Military men
have to die during troubles like this?

961
01:56:58,004 --> 01:57:00,996
Will all of you do nothing
but swap news channels...

962
01:57:01,274 --> 01:57:04,038
...and exchange ideas on what
should have been done?

963
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:08,210
What would have happened if a bullet
had hit me during your crossfire?

964
01:57:08,748 --> 01:57:10,113
You would have been dead once.

965
01:57:14,587 --> 01:57:16,522
Those guys who want to kill
thousands of people...

966
01:57:16,522 --> 01:57:17,682
...aren't scared of
giving up their lives.

967
01:57:18,357 --> 01:57:19,517
We think of saving lives,

968
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:21,024
we shouldn't worry about
our lives either.

969
01:57:21,627 --> 01:57:24,926
The main man has been
caught alive now.

970
01:57:25,164 --> 01:57:26,290
He is not the main guy.

971
01:57:26,699 --> 01:57:28,462
Someone called him
and gave him orders.

972
01:57:28,601 --> 01:57:30,159
They brought out their
knives only after that.

973
01:58:42,408 --> 01:58:43,432
Why did you come here?

974
01:58:43,943 --> 01:58:46,241
You left me half way.
That is why l came here.

975
01:58:47,246 --> 01:58:51,945
You should not come here all of
a sudden and try to scare me.

976
01:58:52,118 --> 01:58:52,584
Why?

977
01:58:52,718 --> 01:58:55,414
You can't be sure that l will be
the only person in this room.

978
01:59:00,026 --> 01:59:01,084
Sand Bag. Dumb Bells.

979
01:59:01,861 --> 01:59:03,055
Do you work out?

980
01:59:06,999 --> 01:59:09,399
Did you know?
l read this in a message.

981
01:59:10,102 --> 01:59:13,230
40 calories get burnt
in one deep kiss.

982
01:59:19,212 --> 01:59:21,203
lf you want to be kissed,
ask me directly;

983
01:59:21,847 --> 01:59:23,337
don't hint at it by saying you
read this in a message...

984
01:59:23,482 --> 01:59:25,382
... or this is as per some rule

985
01:59:26,385 --> 01:59:31,049
You lead us on and
then claim Men are mean.

986
01:59:31,824 --> 01:59:32,654
You might as well
stand in a queue...

987
01:59:32,825 --> 01:59:34,224
...and buy kerosene instead of
asking him for a kiss.

988
01:59:39,732 --> 01:59:43,031
You are here anyway,
why the fuss?

989
01:59:43,402 --> 01:59:44,630
Why burn 40 calories,

990
01:59:46,038 --> 01:59:48,006
let's burn 80 calories!

991
01:59:57,750 --> 01:59:59,047
Not here. Let's go there.

992
02:00:03,289 --> 02:00:04,881
You are the one
laying down rules now.

993
02:00:07,426 --> 02:00:08,518
Close your eyes.

994
02:00:13,966 --> 02:00:15,558
lf l close my eyes,
you will run away.

995
02:00:26,646 --> 02:00:28,409
l told you.
My mom has come.

996
02:00:28,948 --> 02:00:30,711
Oh! God!
What do we do now?

997
02:00:33,252 --> 02:00:34,378
Open the door first.

998
02:00:36,555 --> 02:00:37,356
Where are you going?

999
02:00:37,356 --> 02:00:38,550
l am going to hide
in the Cupboard.

1000
02:00:39,025 --> 02:00:41,016
That Cupboard engaged.
You get in to this.

1001
02:00:52,938 --> 02:00:54,963
What is it Mom.
lt's you.!

1002
02:00:56,809 --> 02:00:57,935
Did you watch TV.?

1003
02:00:58,077 --> 02:01:00,637
ls this on TV already?
ls there a camera in the room?

1004
02:01:01,147 --> 02:01:04,605
l am coming from there.
l saw what you did.

1005
02:01:04,984 --> 02:01:08,010
1 6 people have died.
All of them belong to the Sleeper Cells.

1006
02:01:08,721 --> 02:01:09,881
They lead normal lives.

1007
02:01:10,156 --> 02:01:12,090
Their families are weeping
for them.

1008
02:01:12,358 --> 02:01:13,757
None of them believe this
to be true.

1009
02:01:14,694 --> 02:01:15,558
This is what we expected.

1010
02:01:15,695 --> 02:01:18,528
Did you find a clue about
the Head of the Sleeper Cell?

1011
02:01:26,739 --> 02:01:27,671
l expected this

1012
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:31,476
He is not the main guy.
We missed the one giving the orders.

1013
02:01:33,145 --> 02:01:34,635
Why is he coughing
in a woman's voice?

1014
02:01:49,161 --> 02:01:54,895
Don't you have the habit of keeping
clothes or books in your Cupboard?

1015
02:01:59,004 --> 02:02:00,301
Are you going to marry?

1016
02:02:01,273 --> 02:02:02,900
You want only the Petromax light,
don't you?

1017
02:02:03,876 --> 02:02:05,468
Yes.
Then your life will be coma

1018
02:06:24,837 --> 02:06:26,270
You go in, i'll join you.
- Find, come along

1019
02:06:59,938 --> 02:07:00,996
Eat soon

1020
02:07:02,441 --> 02:07:03,237
Do you want something else to eat?

1021
02:07:03,409 --> 02:07:04,706
Hey, Jagga, how are you?

1022
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:06,238
Senthil, where are you?

1023
02:07:06,345 --> 02:07:08,438
l have come out with my family.
-Yes, where?

1024
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:14,253
There is a bomb in that building.
Come out now.

1025
02:07:14,253 --> 02:07:15,481
What are you saying?

1026
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:23,321
There are so many of them here.

1027
02:07:23,595 --> 02:07:26,860
Listen to me, alert everyone and
get them out of there.

1028
02:07:27,933 --> 02:07:29,127
Come on menthol out!

1029
02:08:57,790 --> 02:08:59,621
Got scared , didn't you?

1030
02:09:33,192 --> 02:09:34,181
Who are these people?

1031
02:09:35,127 --> 02:09:38,324
We only know about Army officers
who died in the Border war

1032
02:09:38,463 --> 02:09:39,657
and Counter Terrorism activities.

1033
02:09:40,265 --> 02:09:43,666
These are people who have become
incapacitated because of injuries in war

1034
02:09:43,869 --> 02:09:46,497
ln other fields, people who work
sincerely get a promotion.

1035
02:09:46,905 --> 02:09:50,272
lt is only in the Army and Police that
we are awarded with retirement

1036
02:09:59,818 --> 02:10:02,844
l have already spoken
to each of you on the phone.

1037
02:10:03,956 --> 02:10:06,083
This is the time
l have been waiting for.

1038
02:10:06,925 --> 02:10:10,122
We are going to execute
an assignment together.

1039
02:10:13,432 --> 02:10:17,698
l am going to meet the guy who controls
the Sleeper Cells tommorrow.

1040
02:10:18,203 --> 02:10:21,331
No one can follow me
when l go to meet him.

1041
02:10:22,207 --> 02:10:25,142
Hence, even before l go to meet him,

1042
02:10:26,011 --> 02:10:28,639
l will insert
a tracking chip inside me.

1043
02:10:29,081 --> 02:10:32,584
You should track the chip from
the Control Room

1044
02:10:32,584 --> 02:10:34,449
and keep him informed about
its movements.

1045
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:39,586
l have secretly procured explosives
that we use in the Army.

1046
02:10:39,858 --> 02:10:41,883
That should reach
all of you this evening.

1047
02:10:42,261 --> 02:10:47,995
You should make the C4 Plastic explosive
using that and hand it over to him.

1048
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:52,803
After you get to know about
my whereabouts through Balaji.

1049
02:10:52,971 --> 02:10:53,903
Bring it there

1050
02:10:54,673 --> 02:10:58,973
l think they will surely
take me to an isolated place

1051
02:11:00,646 --> 02:11:04,446
You must leave the vehicle carrying
these explosives in thats place

1052
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:11,578
l still don't know
why they want me alive.

1053
02:11:12,391 --> 02:11:15,758
But in the fifteenth minute of me
meeting the Sleeper Cells Head,

1054
02:11:17,296 --> 02:11:18,194
...the bomb must explode.

1055
02:11:19,564 --> 02:11:24,024
Along with me, the guy who gives orders
for the Sleeper Head will be gone.

1056
02:11:24,236 --> 02:11:28,536
After that, all Sleeper Cells
will become Coma Cells.

1057
02:11:29,041 --> 02:11:31,942
They will not get
any orders all their life.

1058
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:43,051
Are you kidding?

1059
02:11:43,188 --> 02:11:45,418
You are talking about a Suicide Attack
and they are applauding!

1060
02:11:46,058 --> 02:11:47,726
He is a very dangerous guy.

1061
02:11:47,726 --> 02:11:50,593
But, why are you saying you will die?
Did you think about your family?

1062
02:11:51,797 --> 02:11:53,321
Who doesn't have a family?

1063
02:11:54,199 --> 02:11:55,223
When the Taj was attacked,

1064
02:11:55,801 --> 02:11:57,894
the Men told their children
that they would see them soon.

1065
02:11:58,403 --> 02:12:02,174
Hemant Karkare and Vijay Salaskar
died in 20 minutes,

1066
02:12:02,174 --> 02:12:03,141
...only their dead bodies returned.

1067
02:12:03,275 --> 02:12:04,469
Didn't they have families?

1068
02:12:06,144 --> 02:12:07,634
What about these people.

1069
02:12:07,746 --> 02:12:10,544
They've lost their limbs
in the same war, yet are happy.

1070
02:12:10,916 --> 02:12:12,144
Don't they have families?

1071
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:24,993
An Army man has no better
opportunity than this.

1072
02:12:29,267 --> 02:12:30,635
Even the guys who want to kill

1073
02:12:30,635 --> 02:12:32,762
...thousands of people are ready
to sacrifice their lives.

1074
02:12:33,338 --> 02:12:36,967
Even those of us who want to save lives
should be ready to sacrifice our lives.

1075
02:12:39,011 --> 02:12:40,808
l have made a clear decision.

1076
02:12:41,947 --> 02:12:44,415
lf you think you want to do
something for me.

1077
02:12:48,854 --> 02:12:52,881
People at home are innocent.

1078
02:12:54,526 --> 02:12:55,493
And l have two sisters.

1079
02:12:58,497 --> 02:13:01,989
lf you are free,
check on them every now and then.

1080
02:13:19,985 --> 02:13:22,453
We have just four days left
for the Engagement.

1081
02:13:23,522 --> 02:13:25,217
Why are you calling
it off all of a sudden?

1082
02:13:26,925 --> 02:13:29,519
Let's not have it for now.

1083
02:13:30,762 --> 02:13:32,787
We'll consider this when
l am here the next time.

1084
02:13:34,666 --> 02:13:38,003
The wedding is only next year;
it's just the Engagement now.

1085
02:13:38,003 --> 02:13:41,166
Yes. Let's not have it now.

1086
02:13:42,474 --> 02:13:46,274
You first said you didn't like me,
later, you said you did.

1087
02:13:48,580 --> 02:13:51,242
Do you not like me again?

1088
02:13:55,353 --> 02:13:56,547
Won't you understand?

1089
02:14:02,494 --> 02:14:06,021
But, l don't know if
l'd be able to forget you.

1090
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:09,667
lt'll take me long.

1091
02:20:14,032 --> 02:20:15,363
What is your name?

1092
02:20:20,238 --> 02:20:21,170
What's your name?

1093
02:20:27,212 --> 02:20:28,304
My name is Jagdish.

1094
02:20:31,349 --> 02:20:32,509
He is a Tamilian.

1095
02:20:33,885 --> 02:20:35,182
l know a bit of Tamil.

1096
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,385
l know a lot about Tamilians.

1097
02:20:38,223 --> 02:20:39,485
You don't know why you
haven't been killed,

1098
02:20:39,691 --> 02:20:42,421
or our plan for you, right?

1099
02:20:53,738 --> 02:20:55,968
These are vehicles you have parked.

1100
02:21:00,712 --> 02:21:02,077
See what they have in them.

1101
02:21:09,787 --> 02:21:11,345
We are not going to let it explode.

1102
02:21:12,423 --> 02:21:13,890
We will inform the Police.

1103
02:21:14,158 --> 02:21:16,820
Ouestions will be asked about
who put them there.

1104
02:21:17,128 --> 02:21:18,026
And then...

1105
02:21:36,447 --> 02:21:38,745
...when the Police come
in search of you,

1106
02:21:38,850 --> 02:21:41,478
...we would have killed you and
all your team mates.

1107
02:21:42,654 --> 02:21:44,383
Do you know who would have killed
you and...

1108
02:21:44,622 --> 02:21:48,353
...diffused these bombs at
the right time?

1109
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:49,884
Look at the monitor.

1110
02:21:51,563 --> 02:21:53,053
Joint Secretary in Defense.

1111
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,628
We will say that
it is his team that...

1112
02:21:58,903 --> 02:22:01,201
...killed the 12 people during
the shoot out, earlier.

1113
02:22:03,408 --> 02:22:06,707
They will come to a conclusion that
you are a double agent.

1114
02:22:09,714 --> 02:22:12,808
He will get promoted as
the next Defense Secretary.

1115
02:22:13,151 --> 02:22:17,144
So far, it is only the lndian Army
that didn't have Sleeper Cells.

1116
02:22:19,791 --> 02:22:25,127
Through him, we'll get a lot of recruits
for the Sleeper Cells in the Army;

1117
02:22:25,997 --> 02:22:27,555
...we'll do whatever
we want after that.

1118
02:22:30,268 --> 02:22:31,530
l shouldn't die.

1119
02:22:33,504 --> 02:22:37,201
Sleeper Cells in the Army is akin to
the Nation suffering from Cancer.

1120
02:22:38,109 --> 02:22:40,771
Think!!!
l need to escape from here.

1121
02:23:18,883 --> 02:23:21,909
l want you to beat me to death.

1122
02:23:23,254 --> 02:23:25,188
l want you to kill me
your bare hands

1123
02:23:32,664 --> 02:23:33,688
Did you hear that?

1124
02:23:34,766 --> 02:23:37,792
His last wish is that l beat him
black and blue till he dies.

1125
02:25:06,491 --> 02:25:09,221
Release the lock now and hit me.

1126
02:25:10,995 --> 02:25:11,654
What?

1127
02:25:33,551 --> 02:25:34,813
Listen

1128
02:25:35,353 --> 02:25:37,685
Your Boss beat me up
when my hands were tied.

1129
02:25:38,523 --> 02:25:40,057
l am asking him to unlock me
and he's hesitating.

1130
02:25:40,057 --> 02:25:44,357
You broke my hand you have
Your men around yet you fear me

1131
02:25:46,731 --> 02:25:48,824
You better fear me

1132
02:25:51,536 --> 02:25:55,131
You broke my hand;
you have so many men with you...

1133
02:25:55,373 --> 02:25:57,739
Yet you fear to release
the lock and hit me.

1134
02:26:00,011 --> 02:26:02,002
l like that fear.

1135
02:26:06,417 --> 02:26:08,715
What are you doing, shoot him.

1136
02:26:11,155 --> 02:26:15,216
Listen to me,just shoot him.
You can't beat him.

1137
02:29:01,158 --> 02:29:03,361
These two will beat
each other to death.

1138
02:29:03,361 --> 02:29:04,885
l can shoot him if you let me.

1139
02:29:05,096 --> 02:29:06,757
No way!!
What do l do?

1140
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:03,587
l am telling you!

1141
02:30:05,256 --> 02:30:05,813
Kill them both.

1142
02:30:56,307 --> 02:30:57,501
You are not smart enough.

1143
02:30:59,276 --> 02:31:00,368
Even if you kill me,

1144
02:31:00,678 --> 02:31:04,978
...details that control
the Sleeper Cell are in that Ship.

1145
02:31:05,783 --> 02:31:07,978
They will continue.

1146
02:31:45,723 --> 02:31:46,815
You don't understand, do you?

1147
02:31:48,058 --> 02:31:49,491
You can die with that suspense.

1148
02:32:15,819 --> 02:32:18,289
Had he said he liked this girl
at the first instance,

1149
02:32:18,289 --> 02:32:19,551
we could have got him married

1150
02:32:19,823 --> 02:32:20,619
The same with her.

1151
02:32:20,724 --> 02:32:21,349
What do we do?

1152
02:32:21,625 --> 02:32:23,092
He's not serious about anything.

1153
02:32:28,632 --> 02:32:29,792
They are a super pair, Sir.

1154
02:32:32,369 --> 02:32:34,803
if they are together today,
l am responsible for it.

1155
02:32:34,939 --> 02:32:35,871
You are?
- Yes!

1156
02:32:36,407 --> 02:32:40,503
On the very day we arrived,
his Dad rushed him to see this girl.

1157
02:32:41,312 --> 02:32:43,380
At first he said he didn't like her,
and then she said she didn't like him.

1158
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:44,711
But when they both liked each other,

1159
02:32:44,815 --> 02:32:46,612
some ldiot came in between them
and confused everything.

1160
02:32:46,984 --> 02:32:48,645
Things have been solved only now.

1161
02:32:50,054 --> 02:32:52,579
But, how are you saying that
you brought them together.

1162
02:32:53,324 --> 02:32:56,623
You spoke about an ldiot
that came between them,

1163
02:32:56,827 --> 02:32:58,294
l am the ldiot.

1164
02:33:03,067 --> 02:33:05,001
Hey! What is it?

1165
02:33:05,569 --> 02:33:07,002
The Army is truly great.

1166
02:33:07,137 --> 02:33:08,331
For another 11 months,

1167
02:33:08,505 --> 02:33:10,370
you are going to be in
a Desert or a Snow clad mountain...

1168
02:33:10,908 --> 02:33:13,477
You will have to live your life
in some dimly lit tent,

1169
02:33:13,477 --> 02:33:15,879
and thinking of these 40 days..

1170
02:33:15,879 --> 02:33:18,315
Keep on seeing family photos
over and over again

1171
02:33:18,315 --> 02:33:19,873
And live with it right.

1172
02:33:20,315 --> 02:39:12,873
