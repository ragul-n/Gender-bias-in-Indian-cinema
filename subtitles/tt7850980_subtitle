Hey, come on lift her up.

21
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,760
There's no need for an auto.

22
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,720
She'll deliver right here.

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,480
There are many women here,we'll take care of her.

24

Be Careful!

25
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,060

Ya right too much of a love.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,290
Son has been living closeby for years together.

43
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,960
You won't call and speak to him.

44
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,270
You're so egoistic.

45
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,040
Look here, keep asideyour differences,

46
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,720
why can't you calland speak to him.

47
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,810
I've been thinkingof him off lately.

48
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,770
You just wait and watch,

49
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,780
my grandson will uniteme with my son.

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,960
Won't you Rajini?

51
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,050
You do one thing,

52
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,000
ask your father to come heretomorrow, I want to talk to him.

53
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,290
I'll tell him grandpa.

54
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,250
Hey.

55
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,270
Come on, come on, come on.

56
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,970
What did grandpa say?

57
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,070
Grandpa...

58
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,230
Grandpa...!?

59
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,190
Tell me.

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,020
Dad, did Mom make Fish fry?

61
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,720
Hey, Hey, Hey...Rajini!

62
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Hey tell me...

63
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,410
...what did your grandpa say?

64
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,420
-Grandpa...-Just let him be...

65
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,520
There's nothing newhe must've mentioned.

66
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,030
He's angry about leaving,her sister's daughter,

67
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,770
you got married to me,

68
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,400
Mom...Grandpa...!

69
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,490
What was it? Did hescold your father?

70
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,800
Why is that?

71
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,810
He must've swore,

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,910
why do you want your sonto utter such words.

73
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,030
Dad!

74
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,870
Dad!

75
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,500
Dad, what happened?

76
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,480
What happened Mom?

77
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,190
He wanted to seeyou for a while.

78
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,760
And you're here afterhe stopped speaking.

79
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,610
Even now...

80
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,210
...he didn't think ofsending a word to me.

81
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,960
He did send a word, andyou didn’t turn up,

82
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,430
that's why he's in this shape.

83
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,800
Who did he send a word through?

84
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,640
Through your son Rajini.

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Through my son!?

86
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,010
Hey, did grandpa asked meto come and meet him?

87
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,810
Hmmm!

88
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,730
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

89
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,820
I forgot about it Dad.

90
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,710
Ramanathan and I closefriends since childhood.

91
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,250
He is Rajini Ramanathan,

92
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
and I was Kamal Vishwanathan.

93
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,020
After his marriagewhen his son was born,

94
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,470
he named him, Rajinikanth.

95
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,890
How can I stay quiet about it?

96
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,430
When my daughter was born,

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,820
I named her Kamili.

98
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,930
Just how good friends arethose Rajini and Kamal,

99
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,250
we've gone a notch up...

100
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,940
we both have decidedto become relatives.

101
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,430
...let's not get in tothese old flashbacks.

102
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,100
Check if son is ready andget him to come down.

103
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,710
Ah! move on, move on.

104
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,840
Why are you standing here?Where is he?

105
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,740
He's inside getting ready.

106
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,090
Hey, come sooner, everyoneis waiting for you.

107
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,370
I'm ready, will be there soon.

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,860
He said will come,so let's leave.

109
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,430
Greetings Uncle!

110
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,000
Why are you so shocked uncle?

111
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,830
Kid who use to runaround in undies,

112
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,320
has grown in to a handsome man.

113
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,410
You're still in the sameattire as your childhood.

114
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,570
-What are you saying?-look down.

115
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,570
I thought you'll be a masshero like Billa, Ranga,Baasha,

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,760
You grew up to be the Rajinifrom Dharmathil Thalaivan.

117
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,360
That too a rebirth of it.

118
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,130
You're not Rajinikanth.

119
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,960
You're Ghajinikanth.

120
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,780
Enough!

121
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,300
Don't keep ranting about it.

122
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,900
Look for another good match.

123
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,390
There's a finaloption left for us.

124
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,110
Even if that doesn'tcome along...

125
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,950
It's done! It's done!

126
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,990
Hey!

127
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,080
Hey!

128
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,030
-Sir.-What are you doing?

129
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,290
I'm spraying medicineson the plants.

130
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,140
Hey!

131
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,530
If we keep eating tablets,just 'cause it's available.

132
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,260
that'll turn into a poison

133
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,260
and make the body incapableof doing any work.

134
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Regardless if it'sa plant or tree...

135
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,550
or for that mattereven a human being.

136
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,570
Look here, nullifying the soil...

137
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,060
post which no matter howmuch you fertilize it.

138
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
It still remains a poison.

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Ramanatha, he's Sathyamoorthy.

140
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,150
He's like a god to the farmers.

141
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,340
He always thinks of the naturaltechnique to cure anything.

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,230
To cut it short,

143
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,520
Hey Guna, stopreeling in stories.

144
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,120
I was speaking the truth,and I'm just telling him.

145
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,980
Greetings!

146
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,090
-Ramanathan.-Sathyamoorthy.

147
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,570
Come on let's go there and sit.

148
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
His Son, is a scientistjust like you.

149
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,710
Uh!?

150
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,160
Junior Scientist...

151
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,330
...but will getthere eventually.

152
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,910
His name is Rajinikanth.

153
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,210
Just like the name,

154
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,720
he does look like a hero.

155
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,590
He's just like him.

156
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,820
No matter how high he rises,

157
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,010
he's well cultured andrespects the elders.

158
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,590
He's just like that.

159
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,710
That too over you, he has ahighest level of respect.

160
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,390
When we said it's your daughter.

161
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,670
He said no need to have a look,

162
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,480
just go and fix themarriage right away.

163
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,270
Stop right there.

164
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,290
Don't take me wrong...

165
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,290
does your son hasany deficiency?

166
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,810
Sir, you can spare mewith your research.

167
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Not with my son.

168
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,520
Oh no, you took me wrong.

169
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,580
Look here, even if there's asmall stain on the leaves.

170
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,210
I start thinking inall possible angles.

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,640
This is my daughter's life.

172
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,810
I'll have to thinkit over a 100 times.

173
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,110
Mr. Ramanathan.

174
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,620
I'll go and meetyour son, today.

175
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,710
If I like him,

176
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,520
we'll take it forward.

177
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,940
"What’s up guys? Setup is it?"

178
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,340
"I, Vengaiyan’s Son,Am standing all alone"

179
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,110
Tell me Dad.

180
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,840
Hey!

181
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,850
Just now I met the girl'sdad Sathyamoorthy,

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,870
He'll come and meetyou at the lab.

183

Speak well!

184
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,190
Ah...Ok!

185
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,400
Moreover Guna has built agreat expectations for him.

186
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,990
Girl is said tobe very beautiful

187
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,690
Be careful.

188
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,060
Guna uncle has spoken the truth.

189
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,080

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!

192
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,000
Instead of showingwith such antics,

193
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,420
don't forget whatI had told you.

194
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,570
How's that? You shouldspeak without forgetting.

195
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,170
understood?

196
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,190
Just 'cause you keep scaring me,I tend to forget everything.

197
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh really!?

198
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,700
If not he would've become the brandambassador of memory capsules.

199
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,850
Hang up the phone.

200
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,890

213
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,710
Hmmm!

214
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,970

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,880
-Is this tea or coffee?-It's coffee.

218
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,670
You call this a coffee, ittastes like cane juice.

219
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,450
I'll teach how to make coffee.

220
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,900
-Ma'am uh...-Yes Sir!

221
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,800
-Did you inform that I'm here.-We did Sir.

222
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,010
Let's take rest after lunch.

223
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,140
Karna it's awesome.

224
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,700
The masala in thechicken is yummy.

225
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,560
It's delicious.

226
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,490
Hey what are you talkingabout chicken and mutton?

227
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,070
Nothing much, Karna got chicken forlunch, so I was complimenting him.

228
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,000
Enough of your compliments.

229
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,670
What compliment didthe visitor give you?

230
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,310

231
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,420
Hey, Sathyamoorthy damn it!

232
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,190
What's it?

233
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,280
Wonder what he forgot?

234
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,590
What happened?

235
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,770
Nothing happened.

236
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,670
He totally forgot about it.

237
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,150
There was someone waiting here.

238
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,550
He was here all thiswhile, just left now.

239
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,610
Dad, send me hisnumber right away?

240
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,960
As if you're going todo squat about it.

241
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,450
Useless idiotic fool.

242
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,570
You were born at the wrong time.

243
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,830
You killed my father.

244
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,680
Why don't you kill me too.

245
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,850
Fine, I'll get homeand take care of it.

246
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,870
Send his number right away.

247
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,370
Hello!

248
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,900

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,550
There were delegatesfrom the USA,

250
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,040
it took sometime to explainabout the sampling seeds.

251
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,470
No issues I left, we'llmeet some other day.

252
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,650

-Buddy!-Buddy!

259
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,800
Regardless of yourmind diversion,

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,170

261
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,330

262
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,260
You're awesome.

263
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,130
Where's your girlfriend?

264
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,480

265
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,430
Hi!

266
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,060
Why is she wearing a parda?Is she a Muslim?

267
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,670
Hey, it was your idea.

268
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah, come on soon.

269
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,310
Hey!

270
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,560
Hey, does his father knowthat she's been kidnapped.

271
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,400
So what if he comes to know.

272
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,860
You were the one who planned it.

273
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,580
Hereafter, you shouldlook after everything.

274
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,950
Hey get me a paper and pen,

275
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,080
get a blue pen.

276
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,060
Don't get the black.

277
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,190
Sentiments!

278
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,370
Wait, I'll feed it to you.

279
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,110
Come to registraroffice on time.

280
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,760
Hey, don't youhave any courtesy?

281
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,810
Get up.

282
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,790
I've been waitingfor four hours.

283
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,600
But you've been talkingnonsense with this guy.

284
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,510
Come on Speak up.

285
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,080
Sir, Sorry Sir.

286
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,310
Sorry my foot.

287
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
You should have adecorum to say sorry.

288
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,960
I wasted my time for auseless guy like you.

289
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,460
When I think of that,I feel ashamed.

290
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,980
It'll be shameful.

291
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,310
Earlier, I use to thinkof me like that.

292
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,550
But after I fell in love

293
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,690
I've been flying high.

294
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,700
Romance has lost its taste.

295
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,130
Buddy, who was that?

296
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,300
He was the father of thegirl who I could've married.

297
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,430
Wow....Father-in-Law.

298
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,820
Uncle...Uncle!

299
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,050
Please Uncle, listento me for a moment

300
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,610
Rajini is a very good person.

301
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,900
Regardless of the job,he'll be at his best.

302
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,080
That's why if you get yourdaughter married to him,

303
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,870
What's it?

304
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
he will take good care of her.

305
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,470
Hey get out.

306
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,280
We're already out.

307
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,630
Hey, Hey...leave from here.

308
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm speaking in your favour.

309
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,210
Leave from here.

310
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,240
What's this nonsense?

311
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,460
Sir, don't take anythinghe said to your heart.

312
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,110
Sir, I have to confessa truth to you.

313
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,770
I have a absent mind.

314
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,710
When I'm at one work, andif I move on to another...

315
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,720
...I tend to forgeteverything automatically.

316
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,540
That's what...

317
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,240
when you came down andwere waiting at the office

318
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,220
I forgot about it.

319
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,220
For God sake, it was anunintentional mistake.

320
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,070
Please be wise and forgive me.

321
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,870
You have so many problems,

322
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,910
and you wanted to getmarried to my daughter.

323
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,080
And spoil her life all together.

324
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,030
Hey!

325
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,110
You are worse thanI had expected.

326
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,460
Here after I shouldn't see you,

327
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,830
In fact never showyour face again.

328
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,650
If I do see you....

329
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,640
I'll kill you.

330
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,620
Flip your plate.

331
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,370
I'm not hungry Mom.

332
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,300
Why is that?

333
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,970
Aren't you used to this?

334
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,480
Then what's with the emotionsas if it's your first.

335
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,270
He keeps building your imagefor a match, his worries.

336
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,270
If you get married,

337
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,540
I'll get to play with mygrand child, my worries.

338
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,570
If a girl steps in to the house,

339
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,500
it will fulfill her wish tohave a daughter, her worries.

340
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,890
Why are you worried?

341
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,960
Forgetting is not my hobby.

342
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,240
If it's not a hobby then what'sthe name for forgetting like this?

343
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,450
When it comes to work,

344
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,900
you should put yourheart in to it.

345
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,870
Ramanatha!

346
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,510
Why don't we take himto a specialist.

347
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,290
We've consultedevery specialist.

348
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,460
He's a specialmanufacturing defect.

349
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,760
So they sent him back.

350
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,400
-What are you saying?-Hey shut up.

351
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,480
I'll give you an idea.

352
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,940
Find someone who'sas peculiar as you,

353
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,260
at least don't forget then,take her elope from here.

354
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,290
I'm done with lookingfor a match...

355
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,960
I never asked you to...

356
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,160
also you don't haveto look around.

357
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,610
Hereafter I won't lookat any girl in my life,

358
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,830
I swear on you.

359
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,570
Hey get lost!

360
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,940
Ramanatha, why don't we do this?

361
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Hey, shut up and eat.

362
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,280
"What’s up guys? Setup..."

363
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,620
Hey what's it?

364
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,780
I'm on my way.

365
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,000
You've called me 25 timesin the last 10 mins.

366
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,040
Hey not that.

417
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:35,960

418
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,430
It's him, he misplacedthe ID card.

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,080
We started the treatment,you can see for yourself.

420

A light scratch...?

426
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,180

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,890

430
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040

431
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,880

432
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,770

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,750

435
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,230

436
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,130

437
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,130
I called to thank youfor donating the blood.

438
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,670

439
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,300

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,980
If at all you hadn'tdonated on time,

445
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,750
I did it right, please hang up.

446
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,760
Boring!

447
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,220
Hey I'm fine with cash.

448
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,540
What have you decided?

449
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,650
-Cash!-We're fine with Cash

450
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,300

451
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,590

452
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,900
What 15,000/-?

453
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,930
I won't pay even a rupeemore than 10,000/-.

454
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,000
What's this, he's ready to pay?

455
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,750
I think he's crazy, let'stake it silently and leave.

456
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Check if it's all there.

457
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,620
Doesn't matter evenif it's off by a few.

458
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,650
Thanks a lot Sir.

459
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,750
-Enough!-Bye!

460
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,560
Hey!

461
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,790
I paid for my own damage...!

462
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,460
Hey guys stop!

463
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,310
You're not like the others.

464
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,950
You're unique.

465
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,390
-Hey!-Hmmm.

466
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,930
What have you beenmuttering about?

467
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,980
Are you ok?

468
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,780
Such a great person, I'venever seen in my life.

469
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,020
Who's that?

470
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,160
More than your father?

471
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,020
Dad...

472
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
since two days...

473
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,210
I was struggling toget A -ve blood.

474
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,440
Finally the guy whoagreed to donate it,

475
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,660
didn't turn up.

476
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,890
But one stranger,

477
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,490
don't know where he came from.

478
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,090
He even left before I couldthank him for donating blood.

479
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,460
That's fine as well.

480
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,080
When I called him,

481
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,140
behaved like as ifhe didn't help.

482
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,560
Even when I thanked...

483
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,480
He's cool and askedto forget about it.

484
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,480
These days people who areready to help others are less,

485
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,920
than the people whohelp to publicize it.

486
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,080
From what you're saying,

487
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,750
you met a great heart-ed person.

488
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,650
I too met someone.

489
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,000
How someone shouldn'tbe in this world,

490
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,850
he's like that.

491
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,010
The thought of him irritates me.

492
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,790
Let that go.

493
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,510
Now thanking him over the phone,

494
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,710
is like insulting him.

495
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,190
Buy sweets tomorrow,

496
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,280
and then thank him.

497
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,500
Ya!

498
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,530
I think we would have to auditiongirls on TV to find a match for him.

499
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,740
In the end he'll reject them too.

500
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,140
Buddy, is that her?

501
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,120
Hey, I said my girlwill be like an angel.

502
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,110
She's like a devil.

503
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,520
To me she looks like an angel.

504
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,190
Oh no, half size hulk is here.

505
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,440
Hi patient how are you?

506
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,710
Why are you guys here?

507
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Did you come to pick up hisbody after post-mortem?

508
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,560
He's in good shape now.

509
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
But I won't let you see him.

510
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,780
Hey, why would I cometo see that man?

511
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,100
I came to see my girlfriend.

512
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,600
-Girlfriend.-Yeah!

513
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,710
Yesterday I saw my angel.

514
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,820
She took one unit of blood,

515
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,380
and installed 100 units of love.

516
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,700
Damn you guys!

517
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
So that's the reason you didn'tturn up to donate blood.

518
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,280
-Yes-Yes.

519
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,100
Even if you search her onGoogle, won't be able to find.

520
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,890
Move away Satan!

521
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,830
He's here for his girlfriend,why are you here?

522
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,490
What if people likeyou divert his mind.

523
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,290
In order to avoid that,I came with him.

524
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,200
You keep searchingdon't get diverted.

525
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,690
-Hello!-Hello Sir!

526
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,220
It's me, I had calledyou yesterday.

527
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,810
I have your ID card with me.

528
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,010
Is that Kunju!?-No it's a Nurse.

529
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,080
Nurse uh!?

530
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,590
I'm here at the hospital.

531
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,600
You can come and give it to me.

532
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
No sir, I won't be coming today.

533
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,720
There's a dance schoolin Besant nagar.

534
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,520
I'm right there.

535
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,150
Fine, I'll pick it upwhen I come by that side.

536
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,540
Sir, you'll come for sure right!?

537
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,640
Oh God! Am I comingto look for a match?

538
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,410
Hang up!

539
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,560
Hang up the call.

540
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,050
Why is this nurse sointerested in me?

541
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,320
Must've been impressedlooking at your ID card.

542
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,130
She might even propose to youwhile returning the ID card.

543
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,390
No no, never.

544
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,330
No one can replace the placeof my angel in my heart.

545
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,330
-Hello!-Hello Sir.

546
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,720

547
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,580

548
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,430

549
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,270
Hi!

550
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,640
-Hi-Hi!

551
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,990
-ID card,-Oh yeah!

552
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,220
Is this your part time job?

553
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,000
Ma'am is Bharathnatiyam teacher.

554
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,800
This one is Kuchipudi.

555
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,560
Doesn't matter what it is.

556
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,370
That's an art too.

557
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,700
How come my ID cardlanded with you?

558
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,270
Actually the patient you savedyesterday is my student.

559
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,510
My Lord, the blood I spilleddidn't go to a waste.

560
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,620
What are you speakinglooking at the sky?

561
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,340
Uh...Prayer!

562
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,670
I prayed nothing should gowrong with the patient.

563
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
You're really great.

564
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,520
Even my father wanted tomeet you if you're free.

565
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,510
We can meet, We canmost definitely meet.

566
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,740
'Cause we're going tobe together hereafter.

567
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,970
What do you mean?

568
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,640
I meant, this is not aordinary relationship.

569
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,040
It's a blood relationship.

570
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,050
Can't understand it easilywhen wise men speak.

571
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,810
-Who's that?-She meant you.

572
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,340
Ya!

573
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,310
By the way, if you don't mind.

574
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,270
Can I come daily to see?

575
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,570
Who!?

576
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,830
I meant dance, can Icome and see the dance?

577
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,200
Oh!

578
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,830
Dance, sorry sorry!

579
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,870
But outsiders are not allowed.

580
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,490
May be if your brother orsister joins the class,

581
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,810

582
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,770

584
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,940

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,670

589
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,710

590
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,530

591
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580

Including all of this, youcan pay us 1 Lac a day.

600
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,550
The things you're demanding,even in CV Kumar's production...

601
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,270
...the Hero doesn'tget paid that much.

We're not shooting amovie here, , next!

603
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:07,960

604
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,650

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,510
Is that a name?

626
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,420
When there is Sundar Pichai,

627
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,090
can't Pichai Sundar be a name?

628

634
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,860

635
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,630
Sister please give me alms.

636
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,400

637
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,010
Brother, give me alms.

638
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,440
Hey what's with these labels,

639
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,250
Seems like you mightget us married.

640
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
For God sake leave.

641
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,060
He can't even spare a rupee,

642
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,180
what's the pointin marrying him.

643
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,810
It'll be a disaster.

644
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,460
You're a beggar right!?

645
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,790
He's a beggar Iknow him very well.

646
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,740
-What!?-Manage the situation.

647
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,280
Lovers are scaredof him at the park.

648
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
His prime focus is todisturb the lovers.

649
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,120
He'll change costumes and beg.

650
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,340
I know it very well..

651
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
he's a beggar.

652
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,070
Begging is the only professionwith no corruption,

653
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,240
You've corrupted that as well.

654
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,370
What's all this?

655
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,990
Huh!...

656
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,860
That's right he's a beggar.

657
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,450
Aaah!

658
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,420
Be careful!

659
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,850
-Ok! where are you from?-Annanagar!

660
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,710
I've never seen atthat Traffic Signal.

661
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,300
He has started it, bettergo and pick him up

662
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,080
-Fine, we'll meet next time when I'm there-Dear...

663
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,490
Don't you want to be a dancer?

664
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,160
Dance is your life right!?

665
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,680
Yes, he's a beggar.

666
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,630
But not a thief.

667
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,180
He's not like us.

668
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,650
For a beggar mother,

669
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,160
he was born as a beggar baby,and he's this Beggar boy.

670
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,060
This beggar baby was born in GH.

671
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,810
that beggar mother threwhim in to the dust bin.

672
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,020
Beggars who passed by,

673
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,400
Picked up this beggar baby...

674
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
made him beg.

675
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,940
and he totally changedin to a beggar.

676
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,160
Brother!

677
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,390
At least she calledme beggar just once.

678
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,990
But you've been rantingBeggar the entire time.

679
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,160
-Sorry dear.-You've insulted my entire family.

680
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,470
I'm there for you,you're my brother.

681
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,290
It's not his mistake thathe was born a beggar.

682
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,020
But if he dies as a beggar,it's on all of us.

683
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,960
-I won't let that happen.-You're right.

684
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,300
Not only in India or Tamilnadu,

685
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,600

00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,870
It's alright, there'sno need of formalities.

729
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,680
Dad!

730
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
Let's have that coffeeand leave, Dad.

731
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,870
Please help yourself.

732
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,470
Come dear.

733
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,710
Hey, I think my sonlikes your daughter.

734
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,190
Hey, why do you look surprised?

735
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,290
For your daughter, you'vebeen looking for a match...

736
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,670
...and I'm looking for amatch for my son too.

737
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,630
If you and yourdaughter, like my son,

738
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,470
then why don't we turn thisfriendship in to relationship.

739
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,910
What's this dad?

740
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,610
Is this how someone behaves,the minute they meet a girl?

741
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,970
It's really embarrassing.

742
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,710
Hey, lower your voice.

743
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,690
They might hear you.

744
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,620
What else do you expect?

745
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,380
I don't like him at all.

746
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,490
Not only that,

747
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,490
I can never marrya Police Officer.

748
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,180
Fine...I'll speak to them.

749
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,400
Sorry buddy!

750
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,200
I've been seekingfor a longtime.

751
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,770
But he never liked anyone.

752
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,800
But he liked your daughterat the first sight.

753
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,930
That's why...

754
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,310
...I rushed in asking youwithout thinking twice.

755
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,880
Please forgive mefor this mistake.

756
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,330
There's nothing wrongin what you did.

757
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,660
It's just that, my daughterhates Police Officers.

758
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,390
Son...

759
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,760
-...don't take me wrong.-It's ok uncle.

760
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,610
Thank you.

761
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,210
Come let's leave.

762
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Fine, you eat on time.

763
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,060

764
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,050
Hmmm...wait a second.

765
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,450
Your brother wantsto speak to you.

766
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,510
Vandhana!

767
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,600
Vandhana!

768
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,690
Seems like she's upsetabout something.

769
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,290
-Why don't you call later.-Ok dear.

770
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,280
You take care of your health.

771
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,200
-Bye.-Bye.

772
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,910
What's it?

773
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,920
He hasn't proposed yet, right!?

774
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,120
I'm well aware, come on tell me.

775
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,890
It's nothing like that.

776
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,090
We're just friends.

777
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,170
But...I like him very much.

778
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,130
Not sure if he feelsthe same way about me.

779
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,360
But one thing...

780
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,080
...he can never be withoutmeeting me even for a day.

781
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,710
That's what love is.

782
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,320
-Is it so?-Hmmm.

783
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,800
Do as I say.

784
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,530
Subside your feelingstowards him.

785
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,320
And first find out if he'sin love with your or not.

786
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,730
Ok...done!

787
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,240

-Hi!-Hi.

790
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,190
He gave his bike asa charity to me.

791
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,620
You're not just lord,

792
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,720

793
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,460

794
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,790
Brother seems likea good person.

795
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,930
Take good care of him.

796
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,080
I can start beggingon bike hereafter.

797
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,420
-Hi.-Hi.

798
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,580

You're good nature to help isexceeding the heights of good deeds.

800
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,140
Don't you have danceclasses today?

801
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,750
You seemed to beteaching me instead.

802
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,010
It's not that...

803
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,340
...you gave your bike ascharity to that beggar.

804
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,530
That's why I feltlike complimenting.

805
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,870
Eh!...bike uh!?

806
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,800

Stop right there, it's my bike.

812
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,410
My dad will kill me, If Iget home without the bike.

813
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,540
I can't return what'sgiven to me as charity.

814
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,740
That's a betrayalto my profession.

815
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,420
Betrayal!?

816
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,970
When did I even betray you?

817
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,550
I gave it away withan absence of mind.

818
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,070
Hey, will anyone give awaytheir bike keys as charity?

819
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,270

Hey, stop right there damn it.

826
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,850
They never listen, always pickingup mud around the sewers.

00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,570
-It's stinking.-Hello Darling!

828
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,980

Not even a call, wheredid you disappear?

830
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,030
I totally forgotin that confusion.

831
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,240

833

-Are you lying?-Eh!?

834
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,440
Do you think so?

835
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,570
Nah...I was just kidding.

836
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,430
I now you're not likea normal person.

837
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,310
You're right about that.

838
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,470
I'm way above it.

839
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,360
Hereafter you shouldn't,

00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,800
You forgot, you're dead meat.

846
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,790
You never took me alongwith you, how would I know?

847
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,110

850
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,070
I don't wish to doit over the phone.

856
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,000
Why would I be dishonest?

857
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,680
I hope that I don'tforget, please ask.

858
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,860
Do you...

859
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,030
Do I...?

860
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,480

00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,580
Yes tell me, do I...?

862
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,090
Do you...?

863
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,400
...like me or you don't?

864
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,870
Hold on for a minute.

865
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:34,890
Huh!?

866
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,710
Hi, Sir!

867
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,130
Thank you my man.

868
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,150
What's this for?

869
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,180
It shows your magnanimity.

870
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,230
If at all you hadn't donatedyour blood the other day.

871
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,960
I would've been dead.

872
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,710
You forgot about donating blood?

873
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,500
You're welcome sir.

874
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,740
Ah...give him the sweets.

875
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,250
There's no need for this,I just did my duty.

876
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,240
This shows how wisea person you are.

877
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,970
But look at him,

878
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,750
he's asking for a day offwhen I was in hospital.

879
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,790
It must've been for your rites.

880
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,470
-Ah...!-I meant the office work.

881
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,510
All you guys are useless.

882
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,480
You're the only oneresponsible here.

883
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,220
If at all I had said the truth.

884
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,090
You would've lost the job.

885
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,710
Hey, take those sweets.

886
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,450

887
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,030
Hello!

888
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,090

889
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,550
They taste bad.

890
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,560
He cheated us with bad sweets.

891
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,010
Damn!

892
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,670
Nothing can beat"Irattu Kadai" sweets.

893
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,500
Why do we have to go that long.

894
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,120
There's a small shopnear that dance school.

895
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,100
People queue up to buy sweets there.

896
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,280
-Dance school!?-Your girlfriend's dance school.

897
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,920
-Queue up!?-That's right they queue up...

898
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,640
Hey! my girlfriend is waiting...

899
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,990

900
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,310
Hey, Hi!

901
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,930

902
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,180
Sorry, my boss cameover, that's why...

903
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,710

I'm done.

905
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,220
Great, what were yousaying earlier?

906
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,790
It was nothing.

907
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,460
I cracked a joke.

908
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,780
Joke...!

909
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,860
That joke was hilarious.

910
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,740
No one has ever crackedme up like this before.

911
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,930
By the way...

912
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,170

913
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,970
Not sure if it's the right time.

914
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,800
But can I ask?

915
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,630

919
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,000

920
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,050

00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:28,960
You can't...

991
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,990

Thatha haven't eaten or drankanything since a week.

1050
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,460
In order to get himto drink the juice,

1051
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,880
I was not able to makeit for the movie.

1052
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,050
I did want to call youand inform about it.

1053
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,200
My entire focus was on,

1054
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,480
carom and Thata so...

1055
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,270

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,970
Please forgive me.

1057
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,990
No no, don't say such words.

1058
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,830
Even If you had come today,

1059
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,460
I wouldn't have been so happy.

1060
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,030
I've seen people lying to theirparents for the sake of a girl.

1061
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,110
But to someone whoyou're not even related,

1062
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,980
the notion of doing good tothem, and me being with you...

1063
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,600
...I just feel that I'm blessed.

1064
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,340
Blessing!? it's a curse!

1065
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,310
Do you know your place in myheart after this incident?

1066
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,180
you've just exceededall the expectations.

1067
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:15,690
Oh!

1068
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,500
If you come to know thetruth, you'll bury him alive.

1069
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,910
Just 'cause you didn'tturn up on time,

1070
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,230
I came down to breakup our friendship.

1071
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,010

1140
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,540

You've forgotten whatto do next, right?

1150
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,510
Not that.

1151
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,690
A car left from her house.

1152
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,140
I think that's my father in law.

1153
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,380
So, shall I wait tillmidnight and wish her...

1154
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,890

1155
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,360
get inside and wishher right away?

1156
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,860
Wish her when youcan remember it.

1157
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:25,900
If not you'll forget.

1158
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,930
Do you think so?

1159
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm sure.

1160
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,000
Just don't wish her, in factpropose to her as well.

1161
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,120
Don't worry about anything,it'll all be fine.

1162
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:32,760
Ok!

1163
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:00,680

00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,520
She's my wife, I'm goingto get married to her.

1179
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,720
Be careful when you're on duty.

1180
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,370
Sorry Sir, it was unintentional.Sorry Sir.

1181
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,740
Don't apologize to me,apologize to them.

1182
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,080

1183

1184
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,510
Sorry Sir, you can leave.

1185
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,530
Who the hell parked the bikein the middle of the road?

1186
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,880
Hey, just hold your horses.

1187
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,160
You shouldn't move thevehicle from here.

1188
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,300
Can't you see themarks down there.

1189
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,140
For what?

1190
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,930
There's been an accident.

1191
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,430
Until Asst.Commissioner is here andfiles an FIR, can't move the bike.

1192
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,260
Who's the reason for this?

1193
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,190
He's right there.

1194
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,690
Oh God!

1195
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,420
Hey, why would you ride on a smallroad and meet with an accident?

1196
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,150
Where are you from?

1197
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,140
I'm from Saidapet.

1198
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,120
Due to rain I lost control.

1199
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,730
Oh you're from my area.

1200
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,850
Where are you in Saidapet?

1201
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,410
I'm at Shanthi Colony 1st Street.

1202
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,210
They said ACP is about to come.

1203
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,950
And was told thatwill file an FIR.

1204
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,520
Don't be scared, I'm with you.

1205
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:14,960
Ok sir.

1206
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:16,710
It likely to lose controlwhen the roads are wet.

1207
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,170
Yes Sir.

1208
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,300
You're here likean guardian angel.

1209
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,480
Oh God!

1210
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,120
I think I've bruisedmyself bad after the fall.

1211
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:24,380
Sir, please drop me atthe hospital on the way.

1212
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,270
Is that ok Sir?

1213
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,380
Sorry!

1214
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,650
It took sometime to find out wherehospital is, we'll be there soon.

1215
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:31,840
Uncle!

1216
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:34,730
Ah...sorry uncle.

1217
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,160
Don't worry about anything.

1218
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,180
I'll make sure nothinggoes wrong hereafter.

1219
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,630
Ah...Vandhana, sorry.

1220
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,750
I mentioned that you're mywife without your consent.

1221
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:47,000
Only then, when theysee you next...

1222
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,260
won't trouble you with it.

1223
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,560
Don't take me wrong.

1224
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,020
That's not an issue, it's fine.

1225
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,490
Ah...one more thing, uncle.

1226
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,710
If there's a Police in ahouse, this won't be the case.

1227
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:58,360
You think about it.

1228
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,020
-Shall we leave Dad?-Ya, let's leave.

1229
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,550
Come on.

1230
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:04,600
Sir!

1231
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,520
At least now, do you think sheunderstood what's your intention?

1232
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,910
She's not a child.

1233
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,690
She's old enough for this.

1234
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,880
The incident will be anunforgettable one for her.

1235
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,950
Fine, you worked hard for this.

1236
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,490
-Here take this and enjoy.-Thank you, Sir.

1237
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,250
Hello...Hello!

1238
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:34,910
Hello!

1239
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,070
Hello!

1240
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,890
Please wake up!

1241
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,420
Oh no, please wake up.

1242
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,240
Damn!

1243
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:56,940
So buddy, did you propose?

1244
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,410
It's ruined.

1245
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,500
Everything is ruined.

1246
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,730
A mother and a child aregoing to die, 'cause of me.

1247
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,120
I don't where am I and how I gothere, I can't figure it out.

1248
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,760
Fine, don't get worked up.

1249
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:09,880
There must be someone around.

1250
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,760
Ask them, you might find something.

1251
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,560
I can only see a board right infront of me, other than that...

1252
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,970
Who brought this patient here?

1253
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,900
It was me, what happened?Is there an issue?

1254
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,980
It's completely a wonder.

1255
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,080
Because, a child tangledinside the womb...

1256
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,150
it got shifted to the position whichis required for a normal delivery.

1257
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,680
In fact to be precise,

1258
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,850
her treatment washalf done on the way.

1259
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:55,970
Oh!

1260
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,720
Thank you Doctor.

1261
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,400
You've done a great job.

1262
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,620
Buddy, is everything fine?

1263
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,290
I was really scared.

1264
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,820
If at all somethinghad happened to her.

1265
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,040
Let it go, it's fine now right!?

1266
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,610
Fine, did you informVandhana about it?

1267
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,640

1268
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:12,990
Oh God!

1269
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,400
-Hello!-Vandhana.

1270
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,470
Your sister in law was in labor, I'veadmitted her in Chettinad Hospital.

1272
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,700
Pain uh!? How is she now?

1273
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,720

Uh...ok!

1276
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,430

1277
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,890
Oh my baby!

1278
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,530
Where's that guy?

1279
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,000
He appeared like a God,

1280
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,900

1281
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,400
He carried me in his arms.

1282
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,510
If he's outside, pleaseask him to come.

1283
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,510
How can I proposein this situation?

1284
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,300
Hey, this is the right time.Better propose to her.

1285
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,400

1286
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,260
I love you!

1288
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,810
What happened?

1289
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:35,610
You didn't like it?

1290
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,430
I came prepared to propose.

1291
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:41,240
But when you proposedall of a sudden,

1292
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,250
I don't know how to react to it.

1293
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,910
Idiot!

1294
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:49,740
I Love you!

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,200

1296
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,760
This child looks justlike my mother.

1297
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,410

01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,430

-Tell me Dad.-Hey...!

1303
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,550
Just 'cause youwon't get married,

1304
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,960
doesn't mean I can'tattend wedding.

1305
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,260

1306
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,610

01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,680
I'll be there in five minutes.

1308
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,480
This what you saidfive hours back.

1309
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,590
Hey don't hang up.

1310
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,630
If not you'll forget, keeptalking until you get home.

1311
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:27,750
Dear...

1312
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,400
Ajay's father is calling.

1313
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,170
I did give a thought about it.

1314
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:33,630
He's a good guy.

1315
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,010
I think he'll be theperfect match to you.

1316
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,280
You take your time on this.

1317
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:39,710
Please...!

1318
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,210
-Uncle!-What's it?

1319
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,570
Vandhana is inlove with someone.

1320
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,460
She's in love!?

1321
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,610
The other day at the hospital,

1322
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,040
the guy who got to me on time...

1323
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,290
...that's him.

1324
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:55,260
Both are madly inlove with each other.

1325
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,230
He's no one but,

1326
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:00,880
the guy who saved Vandhana'sstudent by donating blood.

1327
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,510
-Ya!-That's him.

1328
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:03,680
Oh!

1329
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,990
That guy!?

1330
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,520
If that's him,then I don't mind.

1331
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,950
He's a good guy.

1332
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,260
I should be lucky tohave him as son in law.

1333
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,250
You ask him to come straightwith a proposal to our house.

1334
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,800
Thank you Dad.

1335
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,080

1338
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,130
-Hello Darling!-I Love you!

1339
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,480
Why, suddenly so much love?

1340
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,230
How!? How? How? How? Tell me!?

1341
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,840
Any girl will be happy,who's marriage is fixed.

1342
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,830
What!? are you getting married?

1343
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:37,840

1344
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,810
Damn you, when I'm there...

1345
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,720
...If I get there, I'll...

1346
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,170
You're an idiot.

1347
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,050
I'm getting married to you.

1348
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:44,600
Oh!

1349
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,780
So it's with me...!

1350
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,840
Hmmm...yes!

1351
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,500
I've spoken to my dad.

1352
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,160
He agreed to our wedding.

1353
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,180
Ah...then?

1354
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,670
He wanted to meet you.

1355
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,300
Why not, let's meet him.

1356
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,340

1357
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500

1358
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,310
Bye!

1359
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,600
Bye.

1360
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
Ghajinikanth...

1361
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,660
...it's time for you to be Rajini now.

1362
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,770
Yayy!

1363
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,650
Yayy!

1364
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,470
Yayy!

1365
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:14,810
Oh no, Lakshmi.

1366
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,130
Your son has been possessed.

1367
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,900
Get that broom and the slippers.

1368
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,700
No idea what kind ofspirit has possessed him.

1369
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,380
Wondering how doI drive it away?

1370
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,490
-Hey come on quick.-I'm coming, I'm coming!

1371
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,270
What happened?

1372
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,590
You said I was possessed,but why are you dancing?

1373
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,030
Stop it!

1374
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,050
So, aren't you possessed?

1375
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,430
I didn't get possessed.

1376
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,670
But an angel likes me.

1377
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,180
You!?

1378
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,770
Ma, ask your husbandto learn dancing,

1379
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,560
It'll be useful duringmy wedding celebration.

1380
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,180
What are you looking at?

1381
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,890
Just 'cause I'm absentminded I won't find a girl,

1382
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,250
and said that he won't finda girl for me, didn't he?

1383
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,750
Now a girl came looking for me.

1384
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,060
I'm in love with her, andgoing to get married.

1385
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,930
My sweetheart.

1386
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,970
Ah...maintain thislook on your face.

1387
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,270
My father in law will comeand visit us in the evening.

1388
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,160
Ask your husband toreceive him well.

1389
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,680
Come on Ma, help meselect a nice dress.

1390
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,700
Yeah, come on dear.

1391
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,880
Hey, reduce that volume.

1392
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:19,810
It's a good song.

1393
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,900
Hey, that's my problem,please lower the volume.

1394
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,130
Even if this worldtries to divert you,

1395
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,310
even if they rant thatyou've diverted...

1396
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,640
...until you meetVandhana's dad yourself.

1397
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,720
Never Ever Give Up!

1398
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,520
-Excuse me Sir.-Oh no, diversion.

1399
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,910
Can you look after my kid,I'll get some water and come.

1400
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:37,830
I can't do it.

1401
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,590
Sir, I'll be back in a minute.

1402
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,800
Just 'cause of that one minute,my life is getting ruined.

1403
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,200
Sir tap is right there.

1404
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,970
I cannot do it, please leave.

1405
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,850
Eh...you stay right here,I'll be right back.

1406
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,010
Hey...Hey! Ma'am...!

1407
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,980
Kid, please sit down.

1408
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,760
I don't know what to do.

1409
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,570
The kid looks really cute.

1410
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,680
Just move a bit and sit down.

1411
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,080
Oh God!

1412
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,930
If at all I see you again,

1413
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,140
you should neverappear in front of me.

1414
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,630
Oh no, it's him.

1415
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,490
If he sees me, then theentire plan will collapse.

1416
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,430
Let's run.

1417
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,080
Oh no my child.

1418
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,010
Oh no!

1419
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,630
Hey kiddo!

1420
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,440
Are you headed to swim?

1421
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,630
Where's your mother?

1422
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,430
Sir...Sir!

1423
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:01,450
Here...

1424
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,050
-...is she your kid?-Yes Sir.

1425
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,300
Do you have any sense?

1426
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,120
How can you leave the kid alone?

1427
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:09,500
Damn it, I asked you to lookafter her for a minute,

1428
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,810
is this how you behave?

1429
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,840
-How can you?-He's absent minded.

1430
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,370
I thought you onlyforget the older people.

1431
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:17,670
Seems like even the kids now.

1432
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,980
Sir, do you know him?

1433
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,200
I know him very well.

1434
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:22,290
I'm lucky,

1435
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,480
that I'm away fromhim and happy.

1436
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,870
If not it would've been mydaughter in your place,

1437
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,700
and my grand daughter inyour kid's situation.

1438
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,620
He's the bran ambassadorof absent mind.

1439
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,570
An Icon of Mind Diversion.

1440
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:36,680
No...no, he's a youth icon.

1441
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,850
Am I saying the right thing?

1442
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,990
Never seen such anabsent minded case.

1443
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,020

1460
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:04,130
History states that, theyalways end up getting whacked.

01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,850
Why are you even trying tomimic Thenga Srinivasan?

But not sure, he'll letus meet after that.

Huh, what was that?

1570
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,270
Nothing!

1571
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,850
I was asking when andwhere to meet uncle.

1572
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,610

01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:32,760

1582
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,630
Fine, ask him to be atthe Park in an hour.

...the pig shit hegot from his house.

1595
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,250
It's a proper mixtureof these three shits,

1596
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,680
which we call Golden Shit Sand.

1597

Ah...Rajini!

1600
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,030
A very good lad.

1601
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:05,650
Oh!

1602
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:09,020
In this period, we can'tfind one like him.

1603
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,040
Vandhana is in love with him.

1604
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,590
If it's Vandhana's choice,then it must be good.

1605
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,950
Uncle if you don't mind.

1606
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,100

-Is there a problem?-No!

01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,460
She's asking to meet her father.

1611
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,490
Then go and meet him.

1612
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,140
It's not that.

1613
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,740
Her father knows about myabsent mind inside out.

1614
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:39,320
If I meet him, our lovewill break-up for sure.

1615
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,400
Then don't meet him.

1616
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,240
If I don't meet him,she'll break up with me.

1617
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:42,940
Come on let's leave.

1618
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,740
Hey, give me a solution to this.

1619
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,460
Why are you taking this so hard?

1620
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,600
We've seen thisin lot of movies.

1621
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,840

I don't like peoplewho are not punctual.

1626
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,510
It's been long.

1627
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,740
Hey, go slower.

1628
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,650
He doesn't likepeople coming late.

1629
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,170
He won't like you nomatter how early you're.

1630
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:14,230
You seem worked up.

1631

-I'll drive.-Ok.

1632
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,700

Hey just go!

1638
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:24,970
Oh no...!

1639
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:27,120

My stomach got upseton the way here.

1645
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,270
When I went to the restroom, itwas worse as there was no water.

1646
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,570
Moreover there were no tissues.

1647
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:41,460
Had to get a newspaper towipe it off, so I got late.

1648
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,500
Damn...Vandhana'staste is so bad.

1649
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:45,320
Hello, everyone has ataste of their own.

1650
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:47,160
You like Sunny Leone, Ilike Dindugal Kalyani.

1651
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,400
That's freedom of taste.

1652
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,250
Who's this uncle?

1653
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,630

1658
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:57,990
I didn't wash my hands.

1659
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,480
It's ok, another time.

1660
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,790
Phew! Everything isgoing on smoothly.

1661

Did you happen to watchVijaykanth's movie on your way?

1681
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:42,150
Then why is he interviewing asif I'm here for LKG admissions?

1682
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,650
He doesn't have maturity.

1683
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,160
I have one Fatherand one mother.

1684
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,190

You're blabbering.

1689
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,100
Mom is a house wife.

1690
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:54,750
What's wrong with him uncle?

1691
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,840
He's not able to even answerthese basic questions.

1692
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,490
How will he take careof Vandhana in future?

1693
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,960
He's not a match for Vandhana.

1694
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,360
You cancel the marriage.

1695
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,650
He'll die Sir, he'll die!

1696
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,330

01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:08,010
Can't my father die?

1699
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,090
Why should he die for this?

1700
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,230
Then ask your dad to die.

1701
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:10,980

1797
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,200
you'll be thankful.

1798
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,690
If you rise against me,

1799
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,320
I'll bite you in to pieces.

1800
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,900
So you do agreethat you're a dog.

1801
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,840
It's ok, let's date.

1802
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,640
Buddy in the name of dating,

1803
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:37,230
he took me all around,in a broken Sumo.

1804
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:39,370
finally he stoppedover at a tea shop.

1805
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:41,440
I thought he wasgoing to get me tea.

1806
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,870
And was quite sure about it.

1807
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,610
And there he broughtsomeone just like me.

1808
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:46,110
He stole 100 rupees and was runningaway, that's why caught him.

1809
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,510
I didn't steal 100 rupees.

1810
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,420
He asked for 100 bucks, 'causeI wasn't wearing an helmet.

1811
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,110
Hey!

1812
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,980
Don't you know you've to pay afine if you don't wear one.

1813
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,550
Sir I was walking,

1814
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,260

1815
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,410
Don't talk too much,don't talk too much.

1816
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,720
With this face, you'reseeking out for love.

1817
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:04,200
-You look like a wild buffalo.-Who does he mean by that?

1818
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,410
How can you dream ofthat beautiful angel?

1819
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,850
You're beating me forthat 100 rupees,

1820
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:09,070
I'll give you that 100 rupees.

1821
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,720
Still you can't figure outwhy am I beating you?

1822
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,650
I don't understand Sir.

1823
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:13,540
If you dare to crosspaths in my love life?

1824
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,240
Why would I cross pathsin your love life?

1825
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,470
Understood!

1826
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:17,180
Sir..Sir!

1827
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:17,830
Understood!?

1828
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,390
-I will never, I swear.-Understood!?

1829
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,320
Understood!

1830
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:21,330
What did you understand?

1831
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,470
Even if you forgetyour girlfriend...

1832
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,630
...he doesn't seemto forget though.

1833
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,610
He has impressed yourfather in law already.

1834
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,330
And you're scaredto even face him.

1835
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,880
I'm sure he'll take yourdarling away from you.

1836
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,780
Look here, I'm saying this outof one day's dating experience.

1837
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,850
Until he's present, you can'tmarry your girlfriend.

1838
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,170
I will damn it!

1839
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:39,820
I'll be with my father inlaw starting tomorrow.

1840
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:43,010
I'll work along and impress him.

1841
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:48,010
And I'll make him beg tome to marry his daughter.

1842
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,840
Look, no matter what's theissue, he doesn't stop kidding.

1843
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:52,550
-Do you think I'm kidding?-That's right!

1844
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:55,670
I have a awesome idea.

1845
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:56,590
Be ready!

1846
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,720
-I'll tell you in the morning.-You'll forget, say it now.

1847
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,980
-You be ready.-I won't be ready

1848
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,340
Definitely I won'tcome with you.

1849
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,240
Vandhana!

1850
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,920
Call for you from Rajini.

1851
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:15,090
Tell me son.

1852
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:19,740
The mobile numberyou're calling is busy,

1853
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,660
please try again after sometime.

1854
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,880
We never called!

1855
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,740
Strange!

1856
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,440
What do I do now?

1857
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:36,990
Vandhana!

1858
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:39,980
Vandhana!

1859
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,510
Come on Vandhana.

1860
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,330
This hand is hurting too much.

1861
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:53,700
Get that Zandu Balm for me.

1862
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,580
Why is it taking so long?

1863
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,580
Check if its on the shelf.

1864
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,810
Rajini had called your earlier.

1865
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,350
Did you call...?

1866
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:15,660
Why did you drag me out?

1867
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,490
Dad likes you a lot.

1868
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,850
Dad said that groomis really good.

1869
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:23,380
Really!? He likes him?

1870
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,190
How come your Dad'staste is that bad?

1871
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,130
Thank goodness youfell in love with me.

1872
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,780
If not wondering howyour life would've been.

1873
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,420
what are you blabbering?

1874
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,160
Dad was talking about you.

1875
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,270
-That's right!-Hmmm.

1876
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,450
About me...

1877
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,830
So him and I are the same...

1878
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,930
so does I and him.

1879
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,230
Now my mind is clear.

1880
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,150
Hello!

1881
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,930
Nothing, what I wasthinking about was...

1882
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,170
You're so beautiful...

1883
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:50,200
...how come you fell for me.

1884
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:52,590
You're great baby...

1885
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:54,800
Milky color, six feet height...

1886
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:57,070
husky voice and expressive eyes.

1887
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,260
What else do I need?

1888
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,290
I have everything,

1889
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,530
but I don't I havewhat is required.

1890
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,040
I meant the six pack.

1891
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,760
Six pack uh!? I don't want that.

1892
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,860
What else do you want?

1893
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:11,730
what will you give?

1894
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,000
What else do you take?

1895
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,730
Why did you come here?

1896
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:18,010
Why did I come here?

1897
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:25,780
My friend wants to join yourDad as an assistant and work.

1898
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:27,990
You can take this asmy recommendation,

1899
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,920
or obligation, you cantake it the way you want.

1900
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:32,960
But somehow get him ajob with your Dad.

1901
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,280

Please...please!

1903
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:36,300
-Wait here I'll be back.-Ok darling.

1904
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,540
It's just two days since Icalled him my son in law...

1905
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,520
...and onerecommendation already.

1906
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,780
I have a lot of assistants.

1907
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,460
Dad!

1908
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,370
He's an experiencedcandidate Dad.

1909
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,940
It's for Rajini...

1910
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,210
...please!

1911
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,210
Fine, ask him to come tomorrow.

1912
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,970
-Thank you!-Oh God!

1913
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,220
She's running as ifhe's in the next room.

1914
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:08,110
Yes!

1915
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:08,850
Thank you darling!

1916
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:10,110
You came for this right!?

1917
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:11,050
-Hey!-Hey!

1918
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:11,400
Yikes!

1919
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,710
-Hey.-Trust me I did not...

1920
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,300
Hey Rajini!

1921
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,470
Did you forget tohit the brakes?

1922
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,980
If you lie one more time, I'llbury you alive right down here.

1923
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:26,590
Get lost!

1924
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,980
Come on let's leave andcome back tomorrow.

1925
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,970
Once I've enteredthe battlefield,

1926
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:32,250
it's disrespectful for a warriorto turn his back on it.

1927
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,050
Did you watchBaahubali last night?

1928
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,110
Why are you peckingyourself as a warrior now?

1929
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:36,970
I have to somehow impress him.

1930
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,800
As if you'll rememberwhen we get there.

1931
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,890
-Good morning uncle.-Hey!

1932
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,410
Why is he here?

1933
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,600
Vandhana had spoke to youabout a job opportunity,

1934
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:47,930
that's for him.

1935
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,470
If it was for him, then he shouldn'tstay even for a second here.

1936
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,270
If at all he's still here,

1937
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:54,250
I'll spray the rodentpoison on him.

1938
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:55,710
-Get lost.-He'll spray I believe.

1939
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,820
I'm not here asyour...son in law.

1940
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,300
I came here as an assistant to you.

1941
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,990
I didn't come here to marry yourdaughter and settle in life.

1942
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,050
I came here to join as an assistantto you and settle in life.

1943
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,310
I can understand whyyou're getting angry.

1944
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,450
But I don't have whatyou've been expecting.

1945
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:12,710
Hey, what's that?

1946
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,650
My Absent Mind.

1947
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,720
-You've forgotten about that? Hopeless.-Sorry buddy.

1948
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,550
Hey I'm busy right now,will call you later.

1949
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,490
Hey...Hey...Hey!

1950
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,590
He hung up dear.

1951
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,980
Sir, why don't you waitat the coffee shop,

1952
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,460
why don't you see for yourself,if I'm still absent minded?

1953
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:32,170
Hey, pick up and speak.

1954
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,010
Sir, I'm taking this'cause you asked me to.

1955
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,020
First take the call.

1956
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,900
Hey, I'm standing in front anSitting Legend and speaking to him.

1957
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,830
Whatever it is, finishit in just one word.

1958
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:40,490
Buddy!

1959
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,710
I got a new girlfriend,her name is Rambha.

1960
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:44,790
-Hey!-Hey!

1961
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,190
That's good news buddy!

1962
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:46,620
Hey!

1963
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:52,210
He went there 'cause thesignal was weak here.

1964
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,190
The traffic is quite high here.

1965
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,010
He didn't forget...

1966
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,030
...just doesn't remember.

1967
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,370
Uncle...uncle, uncle!

1968
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:08,830
Please uncle, justgive one last chance.

1969
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,020
-he'll be back via wild card.-No ways, that's great.

1970
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,270
Hey Ghajinkanth!

1971
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:12,480
Hey!

1972
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:15,090
Hey don't you realizewhat's happening right now?

1973
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:16,650
Look there, he's pissedoff and leaving.

1974
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,240
Oh God, he's leaving. Come on!

1975
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:19,280
Sir, Sir, Sir...Sorry Sir!

1976
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:20,650
I got distracted.

1977
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:22,400
That's why I didn'tpick up the phone.

1978
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:23,560
It's you who askedme to take the call.

1979
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:24,570
Sir, just one chance.

1980
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,520
-Please Sir!-Get lost!

1981
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:27,210
-Sir, Sir, Sir.-Uncle...!?

1982
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,440
Kanan will come, but I won't!

1983
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,630
You're sweet and welcoming.

1984
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,660
But your Dad is chasing us away.

1985
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:43,770
What do you guys think of me?

1986
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:44,570
A fool!

1987
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,360
That's a Keerthana.

1988
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:48,770
Regardless of it being Keerthanaor Prathana, a issue is an issue.

1989
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,490
-Keerthana means a Song.-Oh Oh!

1990
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,650
She should know that I'm hurt,

1991
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,530
-Ya move.-Come on.

1992
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:55,880
What does your Dad think of me?

1993
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:57,900
How come you're so angry today?

1994
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,440
He usually forgets,

1995
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:00,580
but today he remembers.

1996
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,840
This counter will workhere, you keep going.

1997
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,870
He asked to come tothe farm for a job,

1998
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,340
put in some style in to it.

1999
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:09,650
He asked to come tothe farm for a job,

2000
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:11,780
-previous one was better.-He insulted my friend.

2001
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:13,880
I know you can't hiresomeone with that face.

2002
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:14,440
Me!?

2003
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:16,580
But he went insulting in spiteof the fact he's my friend.

2004
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:18,260
He was insulted,mocked, and hurt....

2005
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,190
...Chengalpattu!

2006
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,130
He was in tears in-front of me.

2007
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,540
If this is the casebefore marriage.

2008
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,190
After marriage, you guysmight kill me with insults.

2009
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:28,060
He lost the respect of mecalling him Father in Law.

2010
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,610
May be his ego was hurt?

2011
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,240
What did you say? Ego!?

2012
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,260
My Ego!

2013
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,200
Buddy let it go.

2014
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:36,330
So what if not here.

2015
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,310
There's a scientist inMadurai called Raju,

2016
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:39,340
with the help of Thermocol...

2017
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:40,230
...sorry buddy.

2018
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:42,480
He used thermometer andhave become world famous.

2019
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,660
I'll rather join him.

2020
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,530
Look here, Vandhana.

2021
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:45,400
My father-in-law...

2022
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:47,120
...that is, are you going tobe a child to your father?

2023
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,240
or you're going to bemother of my child?

2024
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:50,130
Choice is yours!

2025
01:27:50,230 --> 01:27:51,050
Choice is yours!

2026
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:51,940
Choice is yours!

2027
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,580
More emotions!

2028
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,410
-Matter close!-Halleluiah

2029
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:55,470
Slow-Motion!

2030
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:01,300
Dad!

2031
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:03,160
If you didn't like Rajini,

2032
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,520
you could've told me about it.

2033
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,850
Instead, the friendhe came along with,

2034
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:09,900
you insulted him in front of all theworkers and he is very embarrassed.

2035
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,250
I never said anythingto Son-in-Law.

2036
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,550
If you scold his friendin front of him,

2037
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:16,230
It's like you're scolding him.

2038
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,390
Please don't callthat guy his friend.

2039
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,360
Do you remember?

2040
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:21,810
When you spoke high of him,

2041
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,790
I happened to meet oneridiculous character.

2042
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:24,970
That's him.

2043
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,420
He's a case of absent mind.

2044
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,970
Dad, let me know if youcan't offer a job.

2045
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:32,860
Instead don't give me excusessuch as absent mind.

2046
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:37,020
You don't seemed to understand,what I'm trying to say.

2047
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:39,030
It's you who canunderstand my love.

2048
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:42,250
He's the master of absent mind.

2049
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:44,260
If I'm around thatbrainless fellow,

2050
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:45,530
my brain will get damaged.

2051
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:48,390
Ok Dad, you stay happy.

2052
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,470
We broke up!

2053
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,270
He left saying that willnever look at my face.

2054
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,860
He didn't even turn around once.

2055
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,330
Remember he was theone who saved you.

2056
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:01,640
But Dad couldn't evenkeep up the word...

2057
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,660
Dear don't cry.

2058
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,270
Ask him to come tomorrow.

2059
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,270
When this earth bear him.

2060
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,330
I can bear him too.

2061
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:10,970
I'll manage.

2062
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:15,480
-Be extra careful with it.-Good Morning Sir!

2063
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,270
He's here!

2064
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,720
Everything here isgoing to be tarnished.

2065
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:23,300
Hey, don't feed themmedicines anymore.

2066
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,700
the brain won't function.

2067
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:25,630
Hmmm!?

2068
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,610
Do you feel sorry for me too?

2069
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:31,750
It's really funny to look at.

2070
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:32,840
What's the name of the cat?

2071
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:34,500
Dog damn it!

2072
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:35,870
They named it Dog for a cat?

2073
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:36,850
Very interesting Sir.

2074
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:38,010
that's a dog damn it!

2075
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:38,770
Oh!

2076
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:40,680
You being my son-in-law,

2077
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:42,100
and him being your friend.

2078
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,370
More both your names are Rajini.

2079
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,720
It's clear from that,

2080
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:47,980
God is really pissed at me.

2081
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,220
Thank you Sir.

2082
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:50,750
How's it?

2083
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,020
in spite of scolding you,

2084
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,060
insulting you,

2085
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:55,150
even after stating notto come in front of me.

2086
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,460
You still do theopposite with no shame.

2087
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:00,230
I think it must be a bondfrom previous birth.

2088
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:02,380
Just wait and watch, it'llcontinue for the entire life.

2089
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:03,510
Life long uh!?

2090
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:05,040
On top it this phone...!

2091
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:05,730
Hey!

2092
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:07,980
Someone's again callingyou to ruin your time.

2093
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:08,470
Don't pick up.

2094
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:11,150
Life long...uh!

2095
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,800
Buddy I don't knowwhat you'll do,

2096
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,000
I shouldn't get anycalls hereafter.

2097
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:15,720
Give it to me.

2098
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,050
don't worry, even thephone is gone now.

2099
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,930
-We can't pick it up, can we?-Not possible.

2100
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:22,480
-Thank you-My pleasure.

2101
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,840
-You can leave.-Ok Sir.

2102
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,390
Fine, tell me how...

2103
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:27,820
In spite of being absent minded,

2104
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,970
how can you stay so happy.

2105
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,480
Sir, it's really simple.

2106
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:32,910
One life to live.

2107
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:33,830
A job to work.

2108
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:35,040
And a heart to love.

2109
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:37,020
If that's there,anyone can stay happy.

2110
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,660
Is that a forward message?

2111
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:39,880
You're right about it.

2112
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:41,810
Vandhana come here.

2113
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,770
Ahhh! Vandhana!

2114
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:46,780
-Where?-Over there.

2115
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,070
I asked her to comeas a surprise.

2116
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,190
It's not surprise but a shock!

2117
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:54,680
Fine...

2118
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:56,750
...why are you soshocked about it?

2119
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:58,150
It should be him, whoshould be shocked.

2120
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,170
Hey come on do it.

2121
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:01,420

01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,140
Come dear.

2123
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:03,560
-Hi!-Hi!

2124
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,890
I gave him a job,just as you wished.

2125
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:05,700
Are you happy?

2126
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:08,180
Not me, he should say that.

2127
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,330
Are you happy?

2128
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,730
I'm very...

2129
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:12,680
-Hey speak up...-Yes I'll say...

2130
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:14,320
You've a big heart,

2131
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:14,870

2132
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,980
...you let go of our mistakesand gave an opportunity.

2133
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,320
The favour you did to us,

2134
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:20,100
we'll be grateful toyou the entire life.

2135
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,780
Why are you bothgetting so emotional?

2136
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:23,730
That's right why?

2137
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:24,620
We were quite scared,

2138
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,580
we're happy in fact.

2139
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:26,440
Eyes was welling up.

2140
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:27,770
And my heart will bleed I think.

2141
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,970
-Gave your daughter.-Offered a job.

2142
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,070
-Happiness.-Sadness.

2143
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:31,960
-Laughter-Cry

2144
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,900
Delights, like these everythinghas formed a lump in our throat,

2145
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:34,920
lump in our throat...

2146
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,150
-That's my dialogue.-Ok you go ahead.

2147
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,380
It formed a lump in the throat.

2148
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:38,830
It's stuck and not coming out.

2149
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:43,100
Ok then son-in-law, I'll leave.

2150
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:46,740
Why are you bothnodding your heads?

2151
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,090
'Cause we both have heads.

2152
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,520
You guys are blabbering'cause you're happy.

2153
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,900
He's always like that.

2154
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,400
Our BP is low too at the moment.

2155
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:55,530
Our body is aching too.

2156
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:57,750
There's a small confusionwith the dialogues.

2157
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,130
We're leaving Sir.

2158
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,280
We came to get your blessings.

2159
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,080
It's that way.

2160
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,670
Next time, give me thedialogues up front.

2161
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,220
You said it's a small partand it has so many dialogues.

2162
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:14,050
Gayathri your parents are here.

2163
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,830
Come in welcome.

2164
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:17,460

2165
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,720

-Hey!-Hey sweetie.

2169
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:26,680
Sweetheart!

2170
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,020
It was Dad,

2171
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:31,140
who said we won't get a chanceto a free trip to the Europe.

2172
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:33,790
He took us all, and we were noteven here for your delivery.

2173
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:34,850
Sorry dear!

2174
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,360
Aren't we here now?

2175
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,730
Instead of giving some love to granddaughter, you've been complaining.

2176
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:39,820
Let it go Dad.

2177
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,040

01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:47,640
When are we going to see him?

2181
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:50,060
She's blushing on hearingthe grooms name.

2182
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,490
Blushing is somethingwhich she's not a fan of.

2183
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:54,190
Dear, please eat.

2184
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:57,020

01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:42,710
Why is he here now?

2197
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:44,000

2201
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:52,220
He knows that you're my son.

2202
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:54,550
I was me who went first tomeet him, did you forget that?

2203
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,470

2208
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:03,640
As if you're good.

01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,910
Our entire family is like that.

2210
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,160
Oh no, that's my towel.

2211
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:07,830

2212
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:10,250

My husband's sugarlevels were rising,

2216
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,580
so he has taken him to thehospital to get him Insulin.

2217
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,020
It's just insulin,we'll wait for them.

2218
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,920

Hey, what's your story?

2222

You're in love with her,

2223
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:36,670
you're working with her father.

2224
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:37,730
When they both come home,

2225
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,080
you run and hideinside the bathroom.

2226
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,520
I don't understand a thing.

2227
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,200
Oh God! What is that you'regoing to do knowing it.

2228
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,980
I'm sitting myself here,'cause I'm clueless.

2229
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,630
Just shut up, Dad.

2230
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,580
-Excuse me!-Uh!

2232
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,370
Phone is ringing, mightbe an important call.

2233
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,210
Important Call!?

2234
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,850

2235
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,960
the phone is right here.

2236
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,100
Oh!

2237
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,370

2238
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,600
Thank you.

2239
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:07,800
-Take this dear.-Thank you aunty.

2240
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,370
Aunty, Rajini's phone is here.

2241
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,640
He's a absent minded fellow,

2242
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:16,540
he always leaves things behind.

2243
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:18,230
what's that?

2244
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:20,810
Is son-in-lawabsented minded too?

2245
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:23,910
I didn't mean it that way.

2246
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,530
He was all worked up, 'cause he neededto get a shot of insulin for his Dad.

2247
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:27,820
and forgot about it.

2248
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,580
But otherwise, he'svery intelligent,

2249
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:32,500
and very powerful mind.

2250
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,590
The smell is so good, neverdid this happen before.

2251
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,060
Wonder what Mom is cooking?

2252
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:44,140
Disgusting!

2253
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:47,730
I think your husband andson are going to be late.

2254
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,590
I think so too.

2255
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:51,620
Tomorrow is my granddaughter's naming ceremony...

2256
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,720
Relatives are eagerto meet the groom.

2257
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:57,650
It'll be great if you allcome along tomorrow.

2258
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,150

Thank you, shall we leave?

2260
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,810
Be blessed dear...

2261
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,480
...you're so beautifullike a goddess.

2262
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,780
Will you make a promise to me?

2263
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:14,580
Swear that, no matter what happensyou'll be my daughter-in-law.

2264
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:16,820
Aunty...!

2265
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:18,580
When all of us are goingto make the decision,

2266
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,240
she'll be coming to yourhouse as daughter-in-law.

2267
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:23,610
I'm praying for the samefor long to happen.

2268
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:24,370

01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:48,670
♪ I never lie...

2278
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:52,260

2279
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:54,820

2341
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:19,210
Eh...he was suspicious about it.

2342
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:19,840
So...!?

2343
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,810

2344
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:24,120

At least you're fine...

...usually friends get beaten up inthe process of helping the lovers.

2356
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:49,090
But here the entire familyis going to get beaten up.

Not that....

2442
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:52,950
Relatives think thathe's the groom...

2443
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:54,870
...isn't he the groom, so obviouslythey'll think he's the one.

2444
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:55,880
What did you say?

2445
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,190

Moreover he must've forgottenthat he's in a function.

01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:04,380
I'll ask him to comedown, you speak to him.

2449
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:05,650

2542
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,160
My mother isn't keeping well.

2543
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:03,240
I have to leave right away.

2544
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:04,160
How come all of a sudden?

2545
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:06,090
No Sir, I just got the message.

2546
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,320
Not possible, you'll haveto be in the field today.

2547
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:09,310
Sorry Sir!

2548
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:11,490

2549
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:12,340

2550
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,410
Where's Vandhana's room?

2551
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:20,060
It's up there.

2552
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,730
Hey, you don't have any sense tellingstrangers where's Vandhana's room.

2553
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,450
He's going to get married toher, what's the harm in it?

2554
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,330
That's the biggest doubt I have.

2555
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,350
Yesterday uncle introducedme to a funny guy,

2556
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:29,660
and said he's the groom.

2557
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:31,650
Oh God! It's the same guy.

2558
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:37,070
Rajini, how come you're here?

2559
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:38,220
What are you doing?

2560
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,970
Please don't...thereare relatives outside.

2561
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:43,400
Look at him.

2562
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,100
What he's up to.

2563
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,760
Wait, I'll show him who am I.

2564
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:51,540
Oh God, look properly.

2565
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,740
I got hot water for you.

2566
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:54,890
For sponge bath.

2567
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:56,800
Sponge bath uh!?

2568
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:59,570
They're having a sponge bath.

2569
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:00,800
Give me your hand.

2570
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:05,780
Stop it!

2571
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,330
When I'm down with feverduring childhood,

2572
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:10,780
my granny would do the same.

2573
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:13,370
Hey, you shouldn'tlooking at this, leave.

2574
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:14,990
No I will stay.

2575
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:16,770
Hey, do you think thisis Tom and Jerry?

2576
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:18,950
I have to give to youon your courage.

2577
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:20,240
Before the wedding,

2578
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:20,260
you're in my house andin my bedroom hugging.Before the wedding,

2579
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:23,340
you're in my house andin my bedroom hugging.

2580
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,220
What if someone sees us?

2581
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:26,370
I don't care whatthey have to say.

2582
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:28,670
The minute I came toknow you're sick,

2583
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,210
I couldn't control myself.

2584
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:33,300
Even if the world is against us.

2585
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:34,820
If something happens to you,

2586
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:37,040
I'll be in front youthe very next second.

2587
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:37,960
Vandhana!

2588
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:38,970
Vandhana!

2589
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:41,600
Is that your Dad's voice?

2590
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:43,410
If my Dad speaks,

2591
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:44,820
then only his voicewill be heard.

2592
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:47,180
How's Vandhana?

2593
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:48,550
She's fantastic.

2594
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:49,790
Rajini is here.

2595
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,670
Do you know, he's really caring.

2596
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:54,500
Even we haven't takencare of her that well.

2597
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:55,890
He takes care of her so well.

2598
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,950
This room has just one door,

2599
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,780
or it has another exit?

2600
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,490
You just said won't leave me.

2601
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:03,880
I won't let you go.

2602
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:06,160
Fine then you leave.

2603
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,420
Hey, doesn't matterif we're friends.

2604
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,850
I'm here as a Doctor,let me do a check up.

2605
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,890
That's right Doctor, let's findout what's going on inside.

2606
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:13,980
Only then I'll get a clarity.

2607
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,040
Do you know what's theright medicine for fever?

2608
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:17,610
Love!

2609
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:20,490
If you just speak few words of love,fever will vanish in to thin air.

2610
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:22,680
Come on let's leave.

2611
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,340
Why do you have to?Just shut up!

2612
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:29,020
Dad has left the house,you can be at peace now.

2613
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,470
Why is here without informing?

2614
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:42,980
-Do you understand?-Ok!

2615
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:44,830
He's heading towardsFather-in-Law.

2616

Hi did you call me uncle?

2617
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:49,330
Why didn't you attendVandhana's call?

2618
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:50,820
It must've been in silent mode,he wouldn't have seen it.

2619
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:52,580
Hey, I'm speaking tomy to be son-in-law.

2620
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,680
Why are you interfering?

2621
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:54,600
That's my dialogue.

2622
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,120
I was about to sayit but he did it.

2623
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:57,260

2624
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:57,860

You're taking them.

2628
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,680
How can I takethem to Tirupathi?

2629
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:05,970
Why are you sohesitant son-in-law?

2630
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:08,250
As If I had asked you to takesomeone else's wife along.

2631
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:10,720
You're going to drive.

2632
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,590

2633
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:13,400
So I Can't.

2634
01:49:13,490 --> 01:49:14,740
Will you take them if you can drive?what's wrong with you?

2635
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:15,540
That's not the issue here.

2636
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:16,430
-Son-in-Law!-Tell me uncle!

2637
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:18,620
Why are you in between allthe time, come this side.

2638
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:20,110
I was saying...uh!

2639
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:23,420
Look Vandhana is here.

2640
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:24,210
Oh really!

2641
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,470
Son-in-Law!

2642
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:28,180
You can’t escape this one.

2643
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:29,710
You're going to drive.

2644
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:30,820
If I go he'll thrash me,

2645
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:32,000
If I don't then he'll thrash me.

2646
01:49:32,030 --> 01:49:33,330
What do I do now?

2647
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:34,970
-Sir one minute.-Ah...Ah!

2648
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,960
-Brother get me some water.-Ok Sir.

2649
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:39,230
It's hard to be a friendto someone who's in love.

2650
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:40,240
Hey what happened?

2651
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:42,030
Hey, I'm not ableto manage this.

2652
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,480
Shall I tell him now oryou'll tell him yourself?

2653
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,340
I can't bear the beatings.

2654
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:46,880
Look here.

2655
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:48,870
Luck won't be with us 24/7.

2656
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:50,150
It tends to take rest as well.

2657
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:51,170
It's that moment now.

2658
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:54,180
Look there, she'swalking in high speed.

2659
01:49:54,210 --> 01:49:56,150
You guys will get mescrewed in no time.

2660
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,410
Rather, I'll surrender myself.

2661
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,400
Hey, you remain inthis same pose.

2662
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:01,250
It looks really awesome,I'll take care of it.

2663
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:02,080
Hey...Hey!

2664
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:04,080
What's awesome about this pose?

2665
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,470
Sir, here's the water.

2666
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:08,160
Hey, I asked water to drink.

2667
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:09,360
I thought it was to clean.

2668
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:10,010
Get lost!

2669
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:12,600
Sir just have a look at him.

2670
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:15,070
It's on non-stop since morning.

2671
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,220
without a break.

2672
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:19,110
Don't take me wrong.

2673
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,880
When you're traveling with women,stopping the car every few minutes,

2674
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,540
and keep searching forbushes won't look good.

2675
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:26,040
I don't know about it,

2676
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:27,540
Somehow you'll haveto convince Vandhana.

2677
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,070
I'll convince her, Sir.

2678
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:33,600
Lawyer sir, you know to drive right?why can't you then?

2679
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,580
I’ll drive only in myhometown, not here.

2680
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,450
Better off there.

2681
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:37,310
Do you know the way?

2682
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:39,970
"My path is a unique one!"

2683
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:42,210
I'll take you through asimple route in 2 hours.

2684
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,750
Google map shows the same,then how is it a shortcut?

2685
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:11,170
Hey did you look at theboard on the road?

2686
01:51:11,570 --> 01:51:13,090
Roads are bound to have boards.

2687
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:13,960
Why are you looking at them?

2688
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:16,450
It says, Bangalore andwe're on Bangalore bypass.

2689
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:28,230
Rajini, it's been fourhours since we left.

2690
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:29,770
You said we'll bethere in two hours.

2691
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:31,910
Damn, no idea where I am.

2692
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:32,990
It looks like a new route.

2693
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:34,940
Rajini, I'm talking to you.

2694
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:36,870
There was a roadblock on the way.

2695
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:38,570
That's why I took a shortcut.

2696
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,800
Did you say shortcut?

2697
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,380
You've been roaming around for 4hours, for a route of 2 hours.

2698
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:43,470
Is this your versionof shortcut?

2699
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:47,970
Hold on a moment, I'll be back.

2700
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,590
Yeah right he is stopping over.

2701
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:51,590
Wonder how I'm goingto handle them.

2702
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:54,100
Poor thing, seemslike he's thirsty.

2703
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,370
Brother give me atender coconut.

2704
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:55,970
Take it.

2705
01:51:55,990 --> 01:51:57,340
If it was a wine shop,it would've been beer.

2706
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,300
Is this the route to Tirupathi?

2707
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,540
Triupathi route!?

2708
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:03,590
You’ve crossed Hosur and areheading towards Bangalore.

2709
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:07,590
-Bangalore uh?-Yes!

2710
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:09,770
If you leave now will reachTirupati in 5 hours.

2711
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:10,620
This is the route.

2712
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,330
What were you talkingto him about?

2713
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:17,270
I was asking him abouta small information.

2714
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:19,920
-Is there an issue?-No.

2715
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:22,570
Something unexpected isgoing to happen now.

2716
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,660
What happened, why areyou going so fast?

2717
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,450
We'll reach inanother 15 minutes.

2718
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:33,130
Not 15 minutes...

2719
01:52:33,150 --> 01:52:34,250
...just 5 minutes.

2720
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:36,540
If we continue to driveat this speed, we'll die.

2721
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:43,060
Another stop!

2722
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:44,390
Wonder what he'sgoing to drink here?

2723
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,400
Govinda! Govinda!

2724
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:50,800
Govinda!Govinda!

2725
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:53,270
-Is this Tirupathi to you?-Yes!

2726
01:52:53,290 --> 01:52:55,020
Did I come all the wayfrom abroad to see this?

2727
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:56,150
Who are you trying to cheat?

2728
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,330
This is not Tirupathi.

2729
01:52:58,450 --> 01:52:59,770
But this one is a notch above.

2730
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:01,090
Hey...Hey, Hey, Hey!

2731
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:02,550
Here, just shut up for a moment.

2732
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:04,010
Let us hear what he has to say.

2733
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:04,700
Please go on.

2734
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:06,580
Lord Perumal when he'stired in Tirupathi,

2735
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:09,170
he comes down here andtakes rest for 15 days.

2736
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,360
Lord Perumal!

2737
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:12,130
If we pray to a stress free God.

2738
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:14,480
He will answer ourprayers quickly.

2739
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,320
Lord Perumal!

2740
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,890
Now tell me, do you want togo where he's stressed out?

2741
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:20,870
Or would you like to visit this smallheaven of a place where he spends 15 days?

2742
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:23,230
But if you want to go toTirupathi, we can go right away.

2743
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:24,310
No no...not required.

2744
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:25,740
We're happy to visitthis heavenly place.

2745
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,570
That's why I was roamingaround for three hours.

2746
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:29,300
Get inside to get apeek of the lord.

2747
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,550
Get inside.

2748
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:31,470
Let's go aunt.

2749
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:34,220
Rajini, you justify thename given to you.

2750
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:36,270
Come on, come on,let's get inside.

2751
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:39,960
Just 'cause you've been blessed with amouth, doesn't mean you jabber away.

2752
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:41,280
Lord Elumalai!

2753
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:43,940
did I pierce my ears during childhoodto listen to this nonsense?

2754
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:46,870
Govinda! Govinda!

2755
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:47,900
Govinda!

2756
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:10,610
Next on the list isKundrathur Murugan Temple.

2757
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:12,250
Definitely will take you there.

2758
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:15,840
HEY!

2759
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:24,160
Welcome Sir!

2760
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:28,440
How was the trip to the Temple?

2761
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,020
Hey!

2762
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:33,290
Your fake drama hascome to an end.

2763
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,480
-Why are you looking at him?-What!?

2764
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:37,290
He can't speak a word now.

2765
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,720
Ask me, I'll tell you.

2766
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:42,030
Is that your to be husband?

2767
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:43,770
I'm not saying this.

2768
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:45,770
Do you see your boyfriendstanding here?

2769
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:47,740
It was him who told me that,

2770
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:50,130
and made a fool ofyour entire family.

2771
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:53,020
He's been lurking around with you.Your Lover!

2772
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:54,440
Ah...!

2773
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:56,340
I knew this earlier.

2774
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:58,850
I've been ranting thissince the day I was here.

2775
01:54:58,860 --> 01:54:59,920
No one believed me.

2776
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,820
Do you know why hedid all of this?

2777
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:03,880
Absent Mind!

2778
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,220
Absent Mind!?

2779
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:12,340
His mind gets diverted so much that noone in this world can match up to him.

2780
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,700
He even forgets people.

2781
01:55:15,310 --> 01:55:17,060
Whenever his mind goes absent,

2782
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:18,990
he'll somehow managewith an excuse.

2783
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:21,060
And you believed him.

2784
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:23,650
Also fell in love with him,thinking he's a wise man.

2785
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:29,620
With the fear of losingyou, knowing the truth...

2786
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:32,470
he kept lying about socialservice and other things.

2787
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:37,330
The only person who knows thelevel of his absent mind is,

2788
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:38,480
your father.

2789
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:40,220
Uncle come on, tell her.

2790
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,190
He in fact came to donateblood to someone else,

2791
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:48,280
but forgot about him, anddonated to your student.

2792
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:50,640
That's how becamefriends with him.

2793
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:52,970
He used that friendshipto make you fall for him,

2794
01:55:52,990 --> 01:55:55,210
and now he has draggedthis out till marriage.

2795
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:59,030
With fear uncle rejectinghim knowing his truth,

2796
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:01,550
he recommended hisfriend for a job.

2797
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:03,060
And in fact joinedhimself in that job.

2798
01:56:04,210 --> 01:56:06,710
Just run through the eventswhen he was around you.

2799
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:09,950
Only then you'll knowhis true colors.

2800
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:12,060
Did we donate blood?

2801
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:21,980
Something unexpectedis about to happen.

2802
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:26,080
That's fine,

2803
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,500
are you guys returningfrom Tirupathi temple?

2804
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,620
nah...he was foolingus around for 5 hours.

2805
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:33,350
I had a small nap during that.

2806
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,940
Poor thing, what else can he do?

2807
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:38,240
Would've forgotten.

2808
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,980
If at all you getmarried to him,

2809
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:43,580
when you're on honeymoon.

2810
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:46,350
He will forget andwill abandon you.

2811
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:48,950
What shall we do Uncle?

2812
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,030
Is he telling the truth?

2813
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:54,070
Speak up!

2814
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:01,400
Damn it!

2815
01:57:03,110 --> 01:57:04,110
Come on Dad, let's leave.

2816
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,670
Hey, put him inside the vehicle.

2817
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:08,890
Don't Ajay.

2818
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:10,900
Let him go.

2819
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:13,480
Ah!

2820
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:14,800
Excuse me!

2821
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,100
Hey get inside the car.

2822
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:42,440
Have you told them?

2823
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:44,390
Why!?

2824
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:47,900
You can't hide anything right.

2825
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,200
Mom, I'm really hungry.

2826
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,420
Serve me food please.

2827
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:54,820
what did you make?

2828
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,110
You've fried fish.

2829
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:01,260
What's it Mom?

2830
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:03,820
Did make my favourite fish,so that I can forget my love.

2831
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:18,070
After getting brutally insulted.

2832
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:20,850
To sit down peacefullyand have food,

2833
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:22,020
I'm not such a crazy person.

2834
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:25,030
At least trying to forgether with help of food.

2835
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:26,280
Forget her!

2836
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:29,270
I have the ultimate boonblessed by the God.

2837
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,980
Mind diversion and Absent Mind.

2838
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:32,150
I'll forget her.

2839
01:58:35,580 --> 01:58:36,070
Wow!

2840
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:37,450
What a shot!

2841
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,150
Virat Kohli scored a century.

2842
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,600
Dad, I hope we get into the semi-finals.

2843
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:42,400
'Cause our average...

2844
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:45,240
I'm not able to mom.

2845
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:49,260
I'm not able to...

2846
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:56,300
I always try not to forget,

2847
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:57,380
eventually I forget.

2848
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,910
Now I'm trying toforget but not able to.

2849
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:05,840
I never saw my absent mindas an issue in my life.

2850
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:07,600
But for the first time,

2851
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,610
I regret Mom.

2852
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:14,370
Mom,

2853
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:17,120
I'm absent minded.

2854
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,550
But not a bad person whowould betray a girl.

2855
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:24,990
My problems,

2856
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:27,910
In order to hide them,I've lied a lot.

2857
01:59:29,490 --> 01:59:32,050
But she accused me ofmy love being a lie.

2858
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,910
I'm not able to take that Mom.

2859
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,540
It hurts like hell.

2860
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:46,550
I felt like screaming out that Iwon't forget her until I die.

2861
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:49,750
But I'm sure she won'tbelieve, even If I did so.

2862
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,250
What can the heart do, ifthere's a problem in the brain.

2863
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:58,230
Just 'cause if someoneis differently abled,

2864
01:59:58,260 --> 01:59:59,600
can't he fall in love at all?

2865
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:11,440
Dad!

2866
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:13,590
You're right Dad.

2867
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:14,580
You're...

2868
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:17,290
If at all I hadn'tfallen in love,

2869
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:19,150
no one would've beenin so much trouble.

2870
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:21,580
I did a mistake Dad,

2871
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:23,160
I'm sorry.

2872
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:24,810
I did a mistake.

2873
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:33,800
♪ My heart is hurtingand that's killing me.

2874
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:40,350
♪ But I'm trying tosail through life.

2875
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:45,490

2876
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:51,330

2877
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:54,700

02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:56,760
♪ Don't leave me...

2879
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,380
At least have somefruits my dear.

2880
02:00:58,540 --> 02:00:59,480
I don't want, Mom.

2881
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:01,880
How long are you goingto be like this?

2882
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:03,760
Please understand Mom.

2883
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:05,390
Hello all!

2884
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,220
Isn't Mr.Ramanathan here?

2885
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:10,190
Oh hello, Mr.Ramanathan,come on, come on.

2886
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:18,460
Why are you guys lookingat me so surprised?

2887
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:21,020
Fine, I'll first tellyou why I'm here.

2888
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:23,610
I've fixed marriagefor my daughter.

2889
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:28,460
Even If I don't inform,

2890
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:29,600
you'll eventually come to know.

2891
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:32,040
If your Ex-Lover isgetting married,

2892
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:33,710
as a lover you're not goingto be silent about it.

2893
02:01:34,130 --> 02:01:35,820
Breaking into the weddingduring the last minute,

2894
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:38,100
kidnapping the girl before the wedding.

2895
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:40,020
I came here towarn you about it.

2896
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,270
Just stop it Sir.

2897
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:43,500
My son is not himself.

2898
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:46,060
We're not able to lookat him like this.

2899
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,560
And please you don't killhim with your words.

2900
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,630
What I'm trying to say is,

2901
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:51,640
you don't have to say anything.

2902
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:53,340
You've said enough.

2903
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,970
There wouldn't be any kind of troublefrom son during your daughter's wedding.

2904
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,580
Is that enough?

2905
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:57,820
For god sake leave.

2906
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:00,110
Sir, the way you're putting it,

2907
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:02,060
looks like it was me who separated them,

2908
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:04,370
and I'm getting my daughtermarried to someone else.

2909
02:02:05,070 --> 02:02:07,120
Vandhana doesn't like your son.

2910
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:10,150
She agreed to marry theguy I pick for her.

2911
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:15,430
But do you know, what I did?

2912
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:18,380
That's great, what'sthe wait then?

2913
02:02:18,650 --> 02:02:19,850
Let's exchange the crates.

2914
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:21,520
Here take this.

2915
02:02:22,650 --> 02:02:23,280
Dear!?

2916
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:24,880
Shall I accept it?

2917
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:27,860
Later you shouldn'thold me guilty?

2918
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:29,800
I won't Dad.

2919
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,170
Your wish.

2920
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:33,610
Oh no! Don't say that.

2921
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:37,380
I'm not interested ingetting you married to him.

2922
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:42,150
To me my son-in-law is Rajini.

2923
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,250
The love he showered on you,

2924
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,390
I became a fan.

2925
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:47,670
Uncle!

2926
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:48,920
Please wait!

2927
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:50,670
We're talking.

2928
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:53,650
It's a discussion betweena father and a daughter.

2929
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:55,130
As a father,

2930
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:58,110
it's my duty to find agood match for you.

2931
02:02:58,440 --> 02:02:59,860
So please don't interfere.

2932
02:03:02,030 --> 02:03:02,930
Look here dear.

2933
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:06,730
I don't know why you loved him.

2934
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,940
But he loves youunconditionally,

2935
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:10,270
and I've seen that.

2936
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,840
I saw the love, whichyou didn't see in him.

2937
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,810
But it's his bad luck.

2938
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,800
And you were not aware of it.

2939
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:23,110
But at the hospital whenyou proposed to him,

2940
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:25,150
I saw...

2941
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,200
..the guy who I had rejected.

2942
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:30,920
I was wondering how youfell in love with him.

2943
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:33,810
But after he helpedyour sister in law,

2944
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:35,570
May be when I metthe first time,

2945
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:38,390
the decision I took might be a wrongone, so in order to study him.

2946
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,430
I agreed to meet him again.

2947
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:43,100
He was waiting for usat the boat house.

2948
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:44,290
Once he saw me.

2949
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:47,000
He abandoned thechild next to him,

2950
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:50,110
that's when I learned how hismind diversion actually works.

2951
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:53,060
Post which when he hadto meet me at the park,

2952
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,040
he sent his friend tomanage the situation.

2953
02:03:55,090 --> 02:03:57,920
And I wanted to see how farwill he go with this lie.

2954
02:03:57,990 --> 02:04:00,260
But he had a clarity on life.

2955
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:01,500
A life to live.

2956
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:02,570
A job to work.

2957
02:04:02,590 --> 02:04:03,690
A hear to love.

2958
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:05,290
That's enough, anyone can be happy in life.

2959
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:06,850
When he gave such reply,

2960
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:08,600
I saw myself in him.

2961
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:10,380
When he came to knowyou have fever.

2962
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:12,770
He said his mother is not well,

2963
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:14,190
he lied to me andcame to see you.

2964
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,770
He holds you in a placewhere his mother is.

2965
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:25,550
No matter who diverts him,

2966
02:04:25,570 --> 02:04:26,870
he gets diverted immediately.

2967
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:29,180
But when it comes to you,he doesn't get diverted.

2968
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,560
And he came to see you.

2969
02:04:30,660 --> 02:04:32,690
That's when I realized thecure to his absent mind,

2970
02:04:32,890 --> 02:04:34,390
is your love.

2971
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:37,170
When everyone spoke highof him at the house.

2972
02:04:37,630 --> 02:04:39,410
He's the right choice for you,

2973
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:41,040
I decided that,

2974
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:44,930
When he was in ourhouse the other day.

2975
02:04:45,290 --> 02:04:46,890
I left the house with a smile.

2976
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:48,770
As a father I'm saying.

2977
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:52,980
I can't find a better match thanRajini for you in this life.

2978
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:57,980
You may fear in futurehe might forget you.

2979
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:00,680
Due to the fear offorgetting you,

2980
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:04,040
he keeps thinking about you andfilled his heart with your thoughts.

2981
02:05:04,510 --> 02:05:05,280
Sorry Uncle!

2982
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:08,350
You spoke really well,but it was quite a lot.

2983
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:10,180
You may be a great scientist.

2984
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:12,910
But getting your daughter marriedto someone who betrayed you,

2985
02:05:13,030 --> 02:05:15,150
I don't know whyyou're trying so hard.

2986
02:05:17,150 --> 02:05:17,990
Get her married.

2987
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,170
Get her married to him.

2988
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:24,070
Don't forget you're ruiningyour own daughter's life.

2989
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:27,660
One day when your daughter willdie due to his mind diversion.

2990
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:29,930
Only then you'll realizeyou did a big mistake.

2991
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:31,960
Ok Son,

2992
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:33,090
take her.

2993
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:34,410
Dad!

2994
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:38,810
Today at 12:30pm isthe auspicious time.

2995
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:42,310
Mylapore KabaleshawaranTemple, my favourite place.

2996
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:44,070
I'll make a call to them.

2997
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:46,490
My daughter is coming,and get her married.

2998
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:50,390
But before that onesecond you tie the knot,

2999
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:53,470
that Rajini will come and break yourhand and will hold my daughter's hand.

3000
02:05:55,230 --> 02:05:55,690
Wow!

3001
02:05:57,210 --> 02:05:58,020
Well done uncle.

3002
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,140
Well done.

3003
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:01,590
I really like your confidence.

3004
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,080
Just as you specified,at that same time.

3005
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:05,790
I'll tie the knot with your daughter.

3006
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:07,930
I'll return as yourson-in-law at your door step.

3007
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:10,290
Ask him to try if he can.

3008
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:11,670
Dad!

3009
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:13,110
Why are you scared?

3010
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:15,630
The small doubt youhave on Rajini,

3011
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:17,230
will be cleared today.

3012
02:06:31,290 --> 02:06:31,740
Sir,

3013
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:34,880
even my Dad didn't trustme so much like you did.

3014
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:36,560
But you've trust in me.

3015
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:39,570
People who mock at you,

3016
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,440
should be astounded...

3017
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:43,100
go and get my daughter.

3018
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,030
You said he won't come.

3019
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:05,160
-He's here.-I knew it.

3020
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:07,200
That's why I changed the place.

3021
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,550
He shouldn't move outfrom that place.

3022
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:11,380
and shouldn't comelooking for me here.

3023
02:07:12,490 --> 02:07:13,530
Finish him right there.

3024
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:14,820
Ok Boss!

3025
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,190
Everyone pick up your weapons.

3026
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,390
Get me a Lemon Soda.

3027
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:42,870
What!? Lemon Soda uh!?

3028
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:44,040
This isn't your shop?

3029
02:07:44,570 --> 02:07:45,740

Move away.

3031
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:49,130
-Brother.-Tell me Sir.

3032
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:51,830
Squeeze two lemonsto its fullest.

3033
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:54,670
Add a balanced amountof Salt and Sugar.

3034
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,700
This much...no no!

3035
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,340
Add so much of ice.

3036
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:59,270
Pour in a full glass of Soda.

3037
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:03,100

3038
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:06,140
Brother listening toyou, I'm salivating.

3039
02:08:06,170 --> 02:08:07,170
-Is that so?-Yes brother.

3040
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:08,670
Then what's the issue boss.

3041
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:11,070

3044
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:17,260
Sir, what's wrong with him.

3045
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,990
Just like a hero steps in tosave the heroine in the climax.

3046
02:08:20,010 --> 02:08:23,150
He got down from a running car inhigh-speed and is drinking Lemon Soda.

3047
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:25,240
He's like that, arare candidate.

3048
02:08:25,670 --> 02:08:27,340
He would've forgotten whyhe actually got there.

3049
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:28,910
Have fun with him.

3050
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:31,970
Ok Sir. Happy Married life.

3051
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,930
Your love, has comedown to the temple.

3052
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:37,710
After getting there instead ofsearching for you, he forgot...

3053
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:39,430
...and is beendrinking Lemon Soda.

3054
02:08:39,930 --> 02:08:41,810
You falling in lovewith such specimen,

3055
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,840
and your father ravinghigh about him,

3056
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,150
Oh my God!

3057
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:47,540
What!? Change your expression.

3058
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:50,220
Don't make a face,put a smile on it.

3059
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:51,420
And then get married to me.

3060
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:52,700
Hey come.

3061
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:57,610
It's amazing!

3062
02:09:08,170 --> 02:09:09,420
"Righteous Bowman"

3063
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:10,450
is dead.

3064
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:32,690
Hey...Groom to be!

3065
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:35,200
Do you think we can't pay?

3066
02:09:35,230 --> 02:09:37,850
Not just you, we caneven pay for your Dad.

3067
02:09:38,090 --> 02:09:39,090
We have so much money.

3068
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:41,070
That too is my money.

3069
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:43,030
What!? Your money!?

3070
02:09:43,410 --> 02:09:44,710
It was given asbounty to beat me up.

3071
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:46,710
Pick up that rod.

3072
02:09:49,050 --> 02:09:50,050
Does this Rod look fine to you?

3073
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:56,710
Look here, I'll disha punch line now.

3074
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,800
Even if a person has a defect,

3075
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,230
if his heart is pure.

3076
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:02,860
that God will somehowmake him win at the end.

3077
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,360
The same person nomatter how good he is,

3078
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:07,760
if his heart impure...

3079
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:09,260
it's called as a defected piece.

3080
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:11,380
-Like you.-Hey!

3081
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:13,740
You came looking for your death.

3082
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:14,630
How?

3083
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:16,190
How like that?

3084
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:17,110
Please tell me.

3085
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:20,840
She's the girl who I wasmadly in love with,

3086
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:23,770
but was quite upset that shedidn't understand my love.

3087
02:10:24,890 --> 02:10:26,850
But now how much she loves me,

3088
02:10:27,010 --> 02:10:29,620
clearly reflects from thetears rolling from her eyes.

3089
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:31,890
Looking at that, I'm gettingan insane confidence.

3090
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:33,700
I can feel butterfliesfluttering inside my heart.

3091
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:36,270
Hey! What are you looking at?

3092
02:10:37,170 --> 02:10:39,830
Are you expecting meto sing a love song?

3093
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:41,630
Do you think it's asentimental scene?

3094
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,770
It's an action scene.

3095
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:02,370
Hey, beat him to death.

3096
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:50,200
Boss you've alreadybeaten us up.

3097
02:11:51,850 --> 02:11:52,750
I forgot...

3098
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:54,040
do one thing...

3099
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:55,710
people who got beatenup get to this side.

3100
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:57,480
Those who haven't got theirshare come to this side.

3101
02:11:57,610 --> 02:11:59,750
Great, people who haven'tgot beatings please go.

3102
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:24,230
Boss!

3103
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:27,180
What's it!?

3104
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:29,380
You must be tired fighting.

3105
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:31,480
Have juice Boss.

3106
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:34,190
Don't think too much Boss!

3107
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:35,150
Just the way you like it,

3108
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:36,050
Two lemons,

3109
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:37,340
chilled water,

3110
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:39,460
little bit of sugar and salt.

3111
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,400
I prepared it basedon your taste.

3112
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:42,100
Drink it Boss.

3113
02:12:42,180 --> 02:12:43,880
-Very Good!-Thanks Boss.

3114
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:46,300
Look, how I diverted his mood.

3115
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,060
In the process ofdiverting his mood,

3116
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:51,660
he damaged you for life.

3117
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:10,500
I got this in fightlet me tie it.

3118
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:12,200
You want to get married here?

3119
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:13,820
You didn't ask him,but you're asking me?

3120
02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:21,770

3121
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:23,680

3127
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:57,050
where shall we go for honeymoon?

3128
02:13:57,530 --> 02:13:58,370
That won't happen...

3129
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:59,900
...firstly we'renot married yet.

3130
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:01,310

3131
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:02,800
Oh no!

3132
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:03,820
I forgot.

3133
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:05,250
I have to tie threeknots, right?

3134
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:07,910
Here on, remindabout everything.

3135
02:14:08,630 --> 02:14:09,760
Two...

3136
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:10,790
Three...

3137
02:14:10,820 --> 02:14:11,690
We're married now.

3138
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:13,190
Fine...

3139
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:14,980
shall we plan as a family?

3140
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:17,350
Let's do it.

3141
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:22,010
Does he know I'm here.

3142
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,690
Or he forgot after knowing it.

3143
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:24,540
Dad!

3144
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:27,080
What's it Uncle, youthought I forgot?

3145
02:14:28,190 --> 02:14:30,040
After the marriage due toyou daughter's grace,

3146
02:14:30,070 --> 02:14:31,750
memory power is ona different level.

3147
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:33,510
Then Uncle,

3148
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:36,160
I'm getting remindedof childhood stories.

3149
02:14:36,190 --> 02:14:36,750
Oh!

3150
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:38,030
Like I said the other day.

3151
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:39,660
Malar-Teacher love matter.

3152
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:41,240
My friend Ajay in the school...

3153
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:42,980
I got reminded fromthe name of Ajay.

3154
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:44,890
After that issue,

3155
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:46,840
his dad had called statingthat Ajay is missing.

3156
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,110
Do you know anything about it?

3157
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:49,550
Ajay uh!?

3158
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:52,470

3159
02:14:53,530 --> 02:14:55,330

3162
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:10,050
Hey!

3163
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:13,150
I had asked to untieme and leave.

3164
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:15,720
Why didn't you untie me?

3165
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:19,250
Sorry Boss, I forgot.

3166
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,500

You were about tosay something else?

3170
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,950
-Did you donate blood?-Cover yourself...

3171
02:15:39,310 --> 02:15:41,350
It's not this director's previousfilm, It's U certificate.

3172
02:15:56,930 --> 02:15:59,350
Sir, I forgot my dialogues!

3173
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:00,990

-Matter Close.-Hallelujah

3176
02:16:07,130 --> 02:16:07,760
Slow motion!

3177
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:26,370
-Where was I?-Right there...

3178
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:44,470
Only 30% of emotion reflected...

3179
02:16:46,430 --> 02:16:48,120
Sorry buddy, this was just 40%,

3180
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:50,130
This one was only 50%...

3181
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:52,310
You're right, didn'tfeel like it.

3182
02:16:52,410 --> 02:16:53,810
You all are purposelydoing this.

3183
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:55,540
Wait for you, I'll come.

3184
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:25,800
Even now, it's just 80%!

3185
02:17:26,190 --> 02:17:29,250
Don't know how long I'll have todo this, when will he say Cut?

3186
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:29,980
Cut It!

3187
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:31,300
