1
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,875
Change it.

2
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,875
The remote's close to you.

3
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,250
It's closer to you.

4
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,000
I switched on the TV.

5
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,583
I ordered the pizza.

6
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,458
I opened the door.

7
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,703
I rolled the bloody joint.
- I made the bloody roach.

8
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,958
I ordered booze. - But I paid for it.

9
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,083
Actually, forget it.

10
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,171
I don't mind this film

11
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,625
I love this film.

12
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,375
What a nice dance I tell you.

13
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,500
Where did you get the money? For all this?

14
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,500
Don't know.

15
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,838
This morning I gave my
pants to the laundryman..

16
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,541
..and found 2800 rupees in the pocket.

17
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,750
Jackpot!

18
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,250
2800?

19
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,846
The same amount I gave you two weeks ago..

20
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,416
..for paying the electricity bill.

21
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,958
It was two months due.

22
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,291
You.. didn't pay the bill.

23
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,458
Someone check the fuse.

24
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,416
Power-cut.

25
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,166
Power..

26
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,000
Power..

27
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,541
Fine, I'll check.

28
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,208
Bunny.

29
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,833
Bunny. - Bunny.

30
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:20,666
You all right?

31
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,833
Bunny? - Bunny?

32
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,083
Shit!

33
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,791
You.. - What happened?

34
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,875
Your face..
- Dude, is that shit on your face?

35
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,166
Evil-dead types!
- No, not Evil-dead. The other one.

36
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,958
Hollywood ghosts, right? - Yes.

37
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,708
Zo.. - Zom..

38
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,833
Zo..

39
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:56,500
"Oh! So you're back again
with a long face."

40
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,791
"Will you rest.. only after I'm dead?"

41
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,875
"You've come to suck my blood."

42
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:07,000
"Bloody Monday. Why have you
come to suck my blood."

43
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:11,291
"Thank God's the killer's asleep."

44
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,958
"I won't leave! I won't leave!"

45
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,500
"I won't leave this house!"

46
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,708
"You're back to suck on my blood."

47
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,541
"Bloody Monday. You're
back to suck on my blood."

48
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:30,166
"I won't leave! I won't leave!"

49
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,458
"I won't leave this house!"

50
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,750
"You're back to suck on my blood."

51
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:41,125
"Bloody Monday. You're
back to suck on my blood."

52
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,833
I've been working on it all week, sir.

54
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,208
We'll be ready soon.

55
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,166
Of course, sir. Of course, sir.

56
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,666
Fuck you very much, sir.

57
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,666
Why the stupid grin? - What's your problem?

58
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't be jealous.

59
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,333
Why would I be?

60
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,250
I'm not the one getting screwed everyday!

61
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,958
At least pretend you're working.

62
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,000
It's his face, it's disturbing me.

63
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,958
Is this last weekend?

64
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,541
Nice, right?

65
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,291
Yeah cool pics.

66
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,208
Okay then, that's it.

67
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,041
I need a break.

68
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,250
I need to stretch.

69
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,916
I know what you mean by stretching.

70
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,333
You aren't going anywhere.

71
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,625
Look Luv, I mean it seriously.

72
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,375
Priyanka's just bad luck for you.

73
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,958
What's your problem with her?

74
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:46,750
Tell me.

75
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,166
Why are you so crazy after her? Tell me.

76
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,541
Because I.. I..

77
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,000
I love her.

78
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,541
Love?

79
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,708
She isn't your type, or the loving type.

80
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Answer this.

81
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,833
Have you guys even..

82
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,125
..like even once..

83
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,166
No. I'm saving that for marriage.

84
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,750
Is it petrol, that you're saving it?

85
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,583
Look at yourself, Luv.

86
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,375
You and I had a team, dude.

87
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,708
Now this bitch, Priyanka..

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,166
..she's making you dance to her tunes.

89
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,000
What the..

90
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,000
WTF! Don't call my girlfriend a bitch.

91
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,333
Hey. FYI! I'm your best friend.

92
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,833
I can call her whatever I want.

93
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,666
And BTW! I say she's characterless.

94
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,541
You're heading for KLPD!

95
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,000
FU! I've known her for six months.

96
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,083
Don't say such things for her.

97
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,208
And IMHO! She's totally.. crazy about me.

98
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,083
Crazy about you? That's the
funniest thing I've ever heard.

99
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,291
It is funny. You won't understand.

100
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,041
You don't know what love is.

101
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,416
Love, my ass

102
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,333
You know what?

103
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,916
You opened my eyes.

104
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,583
I'm going to propose to Priyanka.

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm going to change my life.

106
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,791
From today, no smoking, no drinking.

107
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,791
I'll become a nice person.

108
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,666
Progress in my career.

109
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,333
Marry Priyanka.

110
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,666
Have some kids.

111
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,875
Why are you saying such things?

112
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey, Luv. Look, right now..

113
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,079
..I'm just 40% in my senses.

114
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,916
Please don't play games with me.

115
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,333
Hardik.

116
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,083
This pointless life's over for me, man!

117
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,958
I'm done.

118
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,125
I need to stretch again.

119
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,000
Life's simple pleasures.

120
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,750
Smoking, in a no-smoking office.

121
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,333
I've just one goal in life.

122
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,458
To smoke in every..

123
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,208
..no-smoking place in the world.

124
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,750
Just imagine.

125
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,083
How would it feel to smoke
up in the parliament?

126
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,000
We'll form a 'Bhartiya Joint Party'.

127
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,875
You're mad.

128
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,625
One minute.

129
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,083
Hold my joint.

130
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,041
I'll be right back.

131
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,791
Hold your position.

132
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,625
Condom, please. - Which one?

133
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,083
The having sex-kind!

134
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,583
Play longer. Extra-sensitive.
Ultra-thin, ultra-pleasure.

135
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,083
In flavours we have mint, vanilla,
dark-chocolate, tutty-fruity.

136
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,208
Which one?

137
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,458
Hello.

138
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,625
Hi.

139
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,833
Do you like strawberries or chocolate?

140
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,000
Nothing. I'm dieting. Why?

141
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,458
I'm getting some sweets.

142
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,791
Get something fruity.

143
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay.

144
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,416
Strawberry.

145
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,125
Baby.

146
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:23,875
I am back.

147
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,958
What are you doing?

148
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,708
We're.. going to do it, right? - No.

149
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,125
You just said. - No.

150
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,000
Come on aren't we gonna..

151
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,541
Oh my, God!

152
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,958
Shit. - Shit boss..

153
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm screwed now. It's all your fault.

154
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,500
You don't need to worry. You're a girl.

155
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,546
Just open two buttons..

156
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,745
..and the horny old man won't
even look at your face.

157
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,791
Simone!

158
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,583
Hey.

159
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:10,666
Hey you.

160
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,708
Who are you?

161
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,916
Spiderman?

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,916
Look here.

163
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,208
Show me your face.

164
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,125
Don't hide.

165
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,083
I know you.

166
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,708
You're.. Hardik, right?

167
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,583
Don't say no.

168
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,583
I can see the tattoo on your back.

169
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:25,875
Don't hide.

170
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:26,916
Tomorrow when you come to the office..

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,440
..I'll make you take off your shirt.

172
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,000
If I see that tattoo, I'll skin you alive.

173
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,156
Where will you go at this hour?

174
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,541
I'm right here.

175
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,375
Oh, God!

176
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,041
Luv. I am in deep mess.

177
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,083
You don't know what happened with me.

178
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't believe where I jumped from.

179
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,583
The boss has seen me.

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,416
I broke my hand too.

181
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,500
Where's my stuff?

182
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:52,500
Fucker!

183
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,833
Where's my stuff?

184
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,958
Where's my shit?

185
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,083
How could you throw this away?

186
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:04,208
I work hard and buy these things.

187
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,083
And you..

188
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you know what they're worth?

189
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,250
Oh!

190
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,708
Hardik. Look at yourself.

191
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,541
You're looking so lowly and helpless.

192
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,875
I feel pity on you.

193
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,041
I did it.

194
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,958
Basically, I cleaned up.

195
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,666
I threw everything away.

196
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,166
From today, no more booze, no more drugs.

197
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,125
Today is the beginning of my new life.

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,875
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,791
I've been..

200
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,458
The point is you're the
star of my new life.

201
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,541
Okay.

202
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,291
I've a surprise for you.

203
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,875
I don't like surprises.

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,500
No. This is a nice surprise.

205
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,583
Do you know that guy? - No.

206
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,125
The one sitting behind you.
He keeps looking.

207
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,416
No. I don't have any idea.

208
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,291
Are you sure? He looks familiar.

209
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
Just see. - I don't know him.

210
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,000
But you didn't..

211
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,083
Priyanka, take a look atleast.

212
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,791
No. I don't know him.

213
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,750
So, you... you were saying something...

214
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,458
..about some new life, or whatever..

215
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,250
Yeah..

216
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,583
I am starting all.. Just a second.

217
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,791
Hello.

218
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,625
What?

219
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:35,833
What.. what?

220
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,583
Why are you seeing us? - I was not.

221
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,916
You were looking at us, I know.

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
How do you know I was looking?

223
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,750
Because I saw you looking.

224
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,333
But, why were you looking at me?

225
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,375
Hello, don't use reverse logic on me.

226
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,343
I was looking because
you were looking at us.

227
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,416
I was looking because you were looking.

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,333
Nonsense. Just don't see anymore.

229
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,500
You don't see first.

230
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,833
Fucker. - Hey! I heard that.

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,083
You fucker.

232
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,916
You fucker first.

233
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,500
Say that again. Say it to my face.

234
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,250
Fucker! Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!

235
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,708
Stop it guys.

236
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,541
Okay. I know him.

237
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,666
Kapoor. - Kapoor?

238
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,166
How many times have I told you before?

239
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,833
Don't follow me around.

240
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,583
What did you think?

241
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,541
You're invisible to others?

242
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,208
What do you expect?

243
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,319
What are you still doing with him?

244
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,333
You were going to dump him. - What?

245
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,208
Come on now.

246
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,291
Kapoor, you've to give me some time.

247
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,916
How can I dump him in the
middle of the night?

248
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,500
You are dumping me?

249
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,000
Couldn't you wait?

250
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,696
We were going to Goa, aren't we?

251
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,416
You just screwed up everything.

252
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,166
Hang on, Goa? How long
has this been going on?

253
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,833
Two-three months.. - Six months!

254
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,708
Six months..

255
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,250
You've been cheating on me all this while?

256
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,833
Both of you're behaving like children.

257
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,541
Just grow up.

258
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,041
Grow up? Me?

259
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,958
Wow!

260
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,833
Was this my surprise? - Yes.

261
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,333
You like it. - Yes.

262
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,208
Fuck off!

263
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,083
Why did I do this to myself?

264
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,375
Why did I change? I was fine.

265
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,375
For her!

266
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,666
She was cheating on me.

267
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,583
Bloody ungrateful, greedy, deceiving..
- Bitch.

268
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,833
Bitch!

269
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,000
I maxed out my credit
card to buy this for her.

270
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:06,750
What?

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,166
Are you crazy, dude? You spent
your hard earned money on.. whoa!

272
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,750
You know what?

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm changing from today.

274
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,250
Reverse gear.

275
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,375
Full party. Full booze, full on high.
I'll get my life back.

276
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,916
I will drink all the alcohol I can.

277
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,333
I'll do all the drugs.

278
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,916
Don't forget girls. - And girls.

279
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,166
Now, every girl will be on my radar.

280
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,541
Except for our family.

281
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,416
And if one breaks your heart..

282
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,791
..the only cure is another girl. - Yes,

283
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,875
I'm proud of you, man.

284
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,625
Come here.

285
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,208
I missed you man.

286
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,458
Thank God you're back.

287
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,083
I need a break. - We both need a break.

288
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,250
Take me far away, Hardik.

289
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:50,583
I knew it.

290
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,958
I always had my doubts about you two.

291
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:52,666
Fuck you!

292
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,000
Hey. Priyanka dumped him.

293
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,750
She left him for some..

294
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,000
What's new in that?

295
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,208
Dude, forget him. Listen.

296
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,125
Do you know what happened
in client meeting today?

297
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,291
What? Who cares?

298
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,416
Did you get eggs?

299
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,541
Hear me out.

300
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,875
They loved my presentation.

301
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,958
They want me to give my
presentation to the MD.

302
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,125
I'm going to Goa for the presentation.

303
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,833
Flight. Hotel. All five star. All free.

304
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Where are you going?

305
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,666
Goa!

306
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,000
Baba's herb."

307
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,208
Baba's herb."

308
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,583
This is bullshit!

309
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,000
Fully bullshit this is!

310
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,541
You had my business class
ticket cancelled..

311
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,208
..and making me drive to Goa.. in my car.

312
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,583
That's the limit.

313
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,000
Now, one of you at least sit in the front.

314
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,958
Shut up, bunny. We'll take turns.

315
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,333
Balls!

316
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,500
Bunny, you're not listening.

317
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,958
Look. Luv is loveless.

318
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,333
Loveless.

319
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,416
I am jobless. - Jobless.

320
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,750
I'm in deep mess.

321
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,750
And you're still concerned
about your useless ticket.

322
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,583
Just watch.

323
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,250
This trip is going to be the
biggest mistake of our life.

324
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,916
Chill, Bunny. Share our joint.

325
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,916
You'll feel happy.

326
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,416
I don't want your bloody..

327
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,541
What the.. I'm burnt..

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,208
"The herb is the solution
of every problem."

329
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,791
"It gives strength when
you are frustrated."

330
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,708
Baba's herb."

331
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,708
Baba's herb."

332
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,708
Now we just need a party.

333
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,291
And some action for you.

334
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,375
Remember.

335
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,821
When one girl breaks your heart.

336
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,666
Yeah. Yeah. Another one mends it.
- Correct.

337
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,250
Do you know how to double this effect?
- How?

338
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,625
Look.

339
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,750
I'll show you triple effect.

340
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,000
Hardik.

341
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,041
Hardik.

342
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,416
Shit..

343
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,000
Fucker! My balls are exposed!

344
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,541
Hardik.

345
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,375
Are you okay?

346
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,894
You're not drowning or anything, right?

347
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,333
It's okay. You can stop now.

348
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,666
I saw what I had to.

349
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,208
You saw everything?

350
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,625
I have something for you.

351
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,041
You mind? - Oh yeah, sure.

352
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,500
I am Luv, by the way. - Hi, I am Luna.

353
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,875
Nice to meet you.

354
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,583
I've seen you somewhere.

355
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,416
No, no, I'm not flirting with you.

356
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,000
It sounds like a line, but..

357
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,750
..how would I, in a pool... naked?

358
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,666
I've seen you somewhere. - I know.

359
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,750
Right? See.

360
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:09,833
Where?

361
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,833
Actually, I'm quite up-to-date about you.
- Really?

362
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,958
Like your girlfriend just dumped you.

363
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:17,708
How do you know?

364
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,500
Everything is updated, on your status.

365
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,291
For the entire world to know.

366
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,416
So, you're my Facebook friend.

367
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,708
I had seen your picture.

368
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,791
Sorry I couldn't remember.

369
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,041
Actually, I have 2000 Facebook friends.

370
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,291
I don't know anyone, but I do.

371
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,125
You know how it is.

372
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,375
Alright. Take care.

373
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,458
Luna.

374
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,375
Luna.

375
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,791
By the way, you should know.

376
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,416
Completely over her.

377
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,250
I've completely forgotten her. - Who?

378
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,833
My girlfriend Priyanka.
- Yes. I can see that.

379
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,875
You still call her your girlfriend.

380
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,625
By the way, what are
your plans for tonight?

381
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:02,958
What?

382
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,541
Nothing, free.

383
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,250
Me and my friends are
going for a rave party.

384
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,916
I've heard the Russian
Mafia's organized it.

385
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,625
It's on this beautiful, remote island.

386
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,958
If you're free, you should come.
- Yes, I am free.

387
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,958
Oh, hi.

388
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,041

00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:38,916
Oh, hi.

391
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,708

395
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,291
With that attitude, you're
not going anywhere.

396
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,208
Are you from Mumbai?
- No, I'm from Bangalore.

But, first. How much money do you have?

411
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,000
What will that get? Two beers? - I see.

00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,958
Bunny. People can kill to
go to a party like this.

00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,458

Real mafia? - Real mafia.

You work so hard, take a break.

427
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,958
Come on, you've earned it. - Yes.

428
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,375
You could've let me change. - Shut up.

429
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,916
Bunny, just wear your attitude.

430
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,166
Who's going to pay
attention to your clothes?

431
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,416
Where's the party?

432
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,000
Is it too far?

433
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,291
Not too far.

434
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,708
10-15 minutes.

435
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,458
20-50 maximum.

436
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,750
We're going on a bloody island!

437
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,583
It's close.

438
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,250
Hardik.

439
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,666
Think we missed the ferry.

440
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,083
Wait, I'll check.

441
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,291
Are we really going on that island?

442
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,000
No one goes there. I won't go.

443
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,166
It's just close-by..

444
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,958
I won't go.

445
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,333

Thank God! Let's go. - But..

448
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,458
We'll drive the boat ourselves. - Yes.

449
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:52,583
Just a minute.

450
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,666
Does anyone here know how to steer a boat?
- No.

451
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,250
I've to stay alive for tomorrow.
I'm not coming along Hardik.

452
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,875
Bunny, give me your car keys.

453
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:01,875
Why do you want it?

454
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,405
We've to leave it as collateral.

455
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,916
Hardik! Hardik! That's my car. - Bunny.

456
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,500
Bunny.

457
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,375
Don't be a pussy, man.

458
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:57,625
"Don't do it, baby."

459
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,583
"Don't do it, baby."

460
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:03,625
"Don't do it, baby."

461
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,541
"You're my only hope,

Water.

494
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,416
Sand.

495
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:09,958
Very romantic.

496
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,916
What are you doing?

497
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,666
I...

498
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,083
I thought we had a moment.

499
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,833
I am sorry. - We didn't have a moment.

500
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:30,000
We were enjoying the silence. - Yes. I..

501
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,958
I thought there was a connection...
- Look, Luv.

502
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,916
You seem like a really nice guy.

503
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,750
And, you just got out of a relationship.

504
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:41,666
Maybe this trip's just an
excuse to meet new girls.

505
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:45,208
Get over your ex. - No. Who does that?

506
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,958
I understand.

507
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,416
I don't want to be one of those girls.

508
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,958
A time pass girl.
- You're not a time pass girl.

509
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,958
You're a very nice girl. I like you.

510
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,791
You are.. - Luv.

511
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,333
I think my friends are waiting for me.

512
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,500
I should go.

513
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,500
Okay. Bye.

514
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,916
What?

515
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,125
See that? - What?

516
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,541
Where were you all night?

517
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,500
Where were you?

518
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,250
Any luck with Scooty? - Luna.

519
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,625
No. I screwed up.

520
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,875
I shouldn't have listened to you.

521
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,375
Where's Bunny? - Bunny.

522
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,795
I couldn't sleep all night
because of those two.

523
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,000
Those two are such lazybones.

524
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,000
I mean... you know, I got them their jobs.

525
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,625
They stay in my house, drive my car.

526
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,958
And this Goa trip, all because of me.

527
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:40,041
It's okay. They're my friends after all.

528
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,791
I mean, I like to party too.

529
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,458
But, they should be good for something.

530
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,500
Why couldn't I sleep all night?

531
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:53,916
I'm hungry too.

532
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,208
I had brownies.

533
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,583
I had at least 4-5..

534
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,000
What are you doing?

535
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,625
No, I mean let's brush first...

536
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,458
Your make-up is all..

537
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:14,666
Let's freshen up first. After that
we can try to do all this. - Bunny.

538
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:17,166
Bunny.

539
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,750
My friends are calling me. I've to go.

540
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,458
Bunny. - I've to go.

541
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,125
We'll be in touch.

542
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,458
Facebook friends.

543
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,791
Bye.

544
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,166
Bunny.

545
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,125
Where were you guys? - Us?

546
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,291
Where were you?

547
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,333
I've been looking for you two all night.

548
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,581
So, you should've told us.

549
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,875
I can't see anything.

550
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,458
Let's go anywhere, I
think party is over now.

551
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,676
Where has everyone gone?
I can't see anyone.

552
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:54,833
Yes, where did everyone go?

553
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,250
Did you guys try the new drug?

554
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:00,250
Hardik, did you try it?
- No. I didn't have money.

555
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:00,975
Did you try it?

556
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:01,958
No. - Hey!

557
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,083
Wait. Wait.

558
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,875
What did he say?

559
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,541
I think he's Russian.

560
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,958
No, no, speak in English.

561
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,458
Someone put some damn subtitles.

562
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:31,291
What's he saying?

563
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,625
There's no network, or I had used translator..
- Wait a minute.

564
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:37,666
Excuse me.

565
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,000
I no understand what you say.

566
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,375
Who are you?

567
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,333
What is your name?

568
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,000
Name-o!

569
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,333
Run.

570
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,833
Run!

571
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:37,000
Run! Run!

572
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,166
Hardik.

573
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,750
What are you doing? Get up.

574
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,000
Run!

575
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,791
They slit that Russian's
stomach and ate him.

576
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,833
They ate the Russian, they'll eat us too.

577
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:05,833
You two are crazy?

578
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,291
Where have you brought me?

579
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,916
Take me away from here right now.

580
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,750
Hardik. Oh, God!

581
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,458
What's happening? Why is it happening?

582
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,666
Hardik. What now?

583
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,458
What will we do? - Quiet.

584
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:22,083
We should get out of here. - Look..

585
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,166
What's that? - Luna.

586
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:26,666
That must be Luna.

587
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,355
Last night she said she's staying
somewhere near that cottage.

588
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,416
Cool. We should leave. - Come on.

589
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,416
Hardik.

590
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,541
We should help.

591
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,000
We can't leave her.

592
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,291
Excuse me..

593
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:41,916
What do you mean?

594
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,916
We'll go there, get Luna
and leave together.

595
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:46,958
Go there? - Yes.

596
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,625
We shot our pants getting here.

597
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,750
Now, you want to climb a mountain.

598
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,125
We can't leave them alone.

599
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,333
We've to help them.

600
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,125
We don't know if it's Luna or someone else.

601
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,125
We'll have to help whoever
is in the cottage.

602
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,291
That's humanity.

603
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,541
Humanity? - Yes.

604
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,500
Does anyone on this
island look like humans?

605
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,291
I'm going anyway.

606
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,666
What the..

607
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,791
I'm going. - I'm not coming.

608
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,458
I'm going. - I'm not coming.

609
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,125
I'm going.

610
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,416
Should I? - Go.

611
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,583
Always emotionally blackmailing us.

612
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,791
Luv. I'll get you a new Luna (moped).

613
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,791
A better one.

614
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,125
You can ride it everyday.

615
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,541
Why so hung up on her?

616
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,166
Luv. I don't have a good
feeling about this.

617
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,083
I didn't ask for your help.

618
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,125
I can do this alone.

619
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,375
Alone? You'll get screwed by yourself.

620
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,000
Hardik. What's going on?

621
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:41,222
What is all this?

622
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,375
Actually, I had seen something
similar in a horror flick.

623
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,541
But I can't remember now.

624
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,000
Wait a minute.

625
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:50,131
I know what they are.

626
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,875
They can't tolerate sunlight.

627
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,250
Their bodies start burning.

628
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,250
Right! This isn't exactly a dark night.

629
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,916
Guess that's just for vampires.

630
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,875
Well. At least we know
they aren't vampires.

631
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:13,208
Yeah. Because if they were,
he would've surely saved us.

632
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,958
Did you see their feet?

633
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,576
Was it backwards? In mean in reverse.
- Shut up, Bunny.

634
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,666
Those are witches.

635
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,991
Witches have back-facing feet.

636
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,375
And anyway, none of them were
walking backward. Right.

637
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:27,666
Must be ghosts.

638
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,858
Ghosts that can be seen in the day.

639
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:30,916
Mutant ghosts.

640
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:31,625
Cross.

641
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,053
Well show them the cross, they'll run away.

642
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:35,583
I do have a cross.

643
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,875
But, what if they aren't Catholics.

644
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,166
Yes you are right.

645
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,333
Who is the Russian's God? - Stalin.

646
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,500
I think its something they
ate last night at the party.

647
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:47,708
They've lost their minds.

648
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,666
I know what they are.

649
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,000
What? Evil-Dead?

650
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:55,666
They're zombies.

651
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,500
Zombies? But..

652
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,875
We've only ghosts and spirits in India.

653
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,287
Where did zombies come from?

654
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:02,916
Globalization.

655
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,404
These foreigners are screwing us!

656
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:06,458
First they brought HIV. And now zombies.

657
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,000
If they bite us, will we turn into them?

658
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:10,583
Nice theory.

659
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,416
We can't test it.

660
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,666
But how will we escape?

661
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,291
Let's think for a while.

662
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,500
What do we know about zombies?

663
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,541
What do we know, what did we learn.

664
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:23,625
Okay.

665
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,208
We know nothing, and we've learnt shit.

666
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,250
Yes. - Correct.

667
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:30,958
All we know is that they are
hungry, and we are their food!

668
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:32,916
They can't walk fast.

669
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:34,454
They are slow. - Yeah right.

670
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,375
Yeah and we're world class athletes.

671
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,125
No one.

672
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,291
Let's go. - Come on.

673
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,833
Wait. Come here.

674
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:01,958
Luna.

675
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,833
Luna. - Luna.

676
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,666
Luna.

677
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,875
Oh God. - Luna.

678
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:36,791
Luv.

679
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,375
Luv. - What?

680
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,625
Let's leave. - Shut up, Bunny.

681
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,375
Luna.

682
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:48,750
Who's that?

683
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,625
It's me, Luv.

684
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:56,583
Are you alright?

685
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,250
I'm so scared.

686
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,083
It's alright. It's okay.

687
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,083
Relax. - Hey, don't be scared.

688
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,125
You're safe.

689
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,333
We're here.

690
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:07,708
This is Hardik.

691
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,625
And.. -Hi.

692
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,000
That's Bunny. - Hi.

693
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,500
Hi.

694
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:15,083
Hi, Bunny.

695
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,250
What happened here?

696
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:22,041
Last night, after we returned,
Sikha became very sick.

697
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:25,583
I guess.. it was the red pill.

698
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,125
Can you believe it? She bit her!

699
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:03,958
She was damn scary.

700
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,875
She was outside the door for two hours.

701
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:09,875
I was so scared.

702
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:12,083
Then, she heard something
from below and left.

703
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:14,375
I don't know what happened
to Mariah and Daisy.

704
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,833
I've been hiding here since then.

705
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:18,625
That must have been scary.

706
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:19,625
Come let's go.

707
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,125
Yeah, let's go.

708
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,625
Dude. Luna's hot.

709
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,791
I was first. I found her.

710
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,000
No.

711
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,500
Just because you applied first..

712
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:43,500
..doesn't mean you'll get admission.

713
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,000
Admission is only on merit.

714
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,000
What?

715
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,250
Don't try to act smart.

716
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,583
Come on.

717
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:03,208
Mariah. - Run.

718
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,208
Oh no!

719
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:08,791
It's okay.

720
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,291
They're only girls.

721
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,000
Let's fight them.

722
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,541
We can fight them.

723
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:19,750
Yes, we can fight them.

724
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,291
Okay.

725
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:26,166
I'll take the hot one.

726
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,333
Luv, you take the pissed-off one.

727
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,208
Bunny, go for the fat one.

728
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:29,375
Why do I always get the fat one?

729
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,833
I want the hot one. - Shut up.

730
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,875
We are not taking them on a date.

731
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,708
Why are they all coming towards me?

732
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,458
You never respected girls.

733
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:39,416
So, now they're punishing you.

734
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,125
Its bad karma.

735
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,458
Thank you.

736
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,708
Bunny hit her.

737
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,666
Oh my God! - What are you doing?

738
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,666
What are you doing?

739
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,458
What is this dog behavior?

740
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,000
No, shoo.

741
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,166
Mariah, stop.

742
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,000
What's wrong with you?

743
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:09,541
I'll hit you..

744
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:13,541
Shoo. Stop.

745
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Fuck!

746
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,916
Sorry.

747
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,250
Sorry.

748
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:33,833
I said sorry.

749
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,833
What.. Sorry!

750
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,666
I said sorry.

751
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:39,291
Let's talk.

752
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:41,958
Let's talk.

753
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,875
Please.. please.. Don't bite me.

754
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,250
I kill dead people!

755
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,230
Anybody bit? - Which beet? What beat?

756
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,458
What..

757
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,583
Anybody bitten? - Bitten?

758
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,583
No, we're fine.

759
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,000
Take it off.

760
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,583
Take off shirt.

761
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:48,708
Turn around.

762
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:51,500
You.

763
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,291
You.

764
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:10,333
Very good!

765
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:11,791
Very, very good!

766
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,541
They're safe.

767
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:15,625
You..

768
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,083
I saw you last night at the rave.

769
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:19,708
You're Russian Mafia.

770
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,791
Was. Was.

771
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,416
Now, all my men dead.

772
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,916
Only Nikolai and me. - Very sad.

773
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,041
I am Hardik by the way.

774
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,458
Boris.

775
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,000
Luv.

776
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,083
Luna.

777
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:38,166
Hello.

778
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,833
Sir, I'm Bunny.

779
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,666
Such a pleasure to meet you, sir.

780
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:44,231
Thank you for saving our lives, sir.

781
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:47,166
Now, we must be quiet.

782
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,333
Super quiet.

783
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,333
We've to find a way off this island.

784
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,208
There must be a ferry out here.

785
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:53,041
No ferry.

786
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,916
Two days. This party, 72 hours.

787
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,083
We find another way.

788
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,958
We've a boat. - Yes.

789
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:00,881
Excuse me. Excuse me.

790
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:02,333
We've boat. We go in boat.

791
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:04,250
What? Boat?

792
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:05,345
This is very good.

793
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,333
Where's boat? - Near rave party.

794
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,000
That way.

795
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,375
Nikolai.

796
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:40,333
Ask him for a gun, for our safety.

797
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:43,000
Good idea. - Go, go, go.

798
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,125
Boris. Excuse me.

799
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,958
Excuse me, Boris. - Baris.

800
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,291
Boris.

801
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:48,583
Baris.

802
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:51,041
Boris. - Baris.

803
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:54,708
Sir, do you have an extra
gun that we can use?

804
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,541
We'll feel safer.

805
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:58,625
Can you shoot? - Of course.

806
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,601
Actually, yes. We're very good shooters.

807
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:01,625
Call of Duty Champions.

808
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,875
Modern Warfare as well. PS3.

809
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,041
Video games.

810
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:14,458
These guns, careful.

811
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:18,250
Bullets, very precious.

812
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:19,750
No waste.

813
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,083
Till we reach boat, we need bullets.

814
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:24,125
One bullet, one zombie.

815
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,250
Only shoot..

816
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,375
Hardik, why isn't he dying?

817
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,708
Because he's already dead.

818
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,250
How do we kill them? - I don't know.

819
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,916
Aim at his heart.

820
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,250
No damn effect.

821
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,000
Aim at his balls.

822
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,333
All his parts are inactive.

823
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,541
His balls are dead.

824
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:50,458
Oh no. No bullets.

825
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:51,791
Fucker!

826
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,041
He's coming this way.

827
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:02,791
Fuckers!

828
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:04,458
Which planet you're from?

829
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,250
How dumb you are.

830
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,000
You don't understand a word I say.

831
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:09,000
You were saying so many words.

832
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:10,458
Honestly, we can't understand your accent.

833
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:11,875
I'll shoot you both now.

834
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:14,625
But, I don't want to waste bullets.

835
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:15,833
Thank God. - Sir, with all due respect..

836
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:18,666
So many.. So many bullets wasted.

837
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,625
On one.. little zombie.

838
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:23,250
Not even kill zombie.

839
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,625
Okay, it's okay.

840
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,375
At least we know we've to
shoot them in the head.

841
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,375
So, what do we know?

842
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:33,875
What have we learnt?

843
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,500
What?

844
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,416
Are you really Russian? - What?

845
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,416
You look a little desi.

846
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:19,750
Are you really Russian?

847
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:25,250
Fine, I'm from Delhi, mother fucker!

848
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:29,750
After all those years with the
Russians, blood's turned to Vodka.

849
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,333
I'm light coloured. And I
learnt the accent too.

850
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,000
Had no choice.

851
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:40,500
He's a local guy..

852
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:53,791
Mr. Boris. We can't understand the signs.

853
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,041
Two words.

854
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,208
Sounds like.. round about..

855
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,833
Hindi or English?

856
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,375
Bloody fools!

857
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:05,000
I will not play dumb charades
in the jungle, would I?

858
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,958
Every signal means one thing.

859
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,125
Danger.

860
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,208
So shut the fuck up and hide.

861
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:14,500
He could've just said that.

862
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,000
Why confuse us?

863
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:37,750
He must practice every day.

864
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,625
All this is because of D2- RF pill.

865
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:48,291
Latest. Strong.

866
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:49,625
Top quality drug.

867
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,708
This rave party was to launch the drug.

868
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Special consignment.

869
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,541
Ordered from the Siberian Border. - Really.

870
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:58,125
What does this drug exactly do?

871
00:56:58,541 --> 00:56:59,416
It shakes you up.

872
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,625
Coke, ecstasy, MDMA.

873
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:02,990
They're nothing compared to it.

874
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,458
Hard core addiction.

875
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,166
It gives you ultimate high.

876
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,875
I think it gets you so high, the
body isn't able to tolerate it,

877
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:17,000
Except for a small part of the
brain, rest of the body dead.

878
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,500
They've turned into walking corpses.

879
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,958
That's why they say "Say no to Drugs".
- Shut up.

880
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,041
So, that small part of their brain..

881
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,958
..controls their entire body? - Correct.

882
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,750
No pain, no pleasure, no emotion.

883
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:32,750
Only hunger.

884
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,041
Hunger to be high.

885
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:36,856
These people are hungry to get high.

886
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,875
And I think blood gets them high.

887
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,541
They can't feel pain.

888
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,666
So, even if you shoot their hands
and legs they'll keep coming.

889
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:47,166
I think there's just one way to stop them.

890
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:49,750
Blow their brains.

891
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,541
We've already learnt that lesson.

892
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,583
And thank God, at least they're slow.
- Yes.

893
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,125
This is just the beginning.

894
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,750
They can get dangerous as
their hunger increases.

895
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,666
How do you know that?

896
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,041
Baby, I've blown 20- 30
brains since yesterday.

897
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:08,500
Consider it research.

898
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:11,041
Boris. Any way to escape them?

899
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,708
I don't know. Maybe not.

900
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,500
You go, get boat.

901
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:26,583
We go jeep, get diesel.

902
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,541
Sea that way.

903
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:31,208
Water that way.

904
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:34,291
Idiots.

905
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:36,376
How will we know if he
speaks in three languages?

906
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,000
Seat belts do save life.

907
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:08,500
Our lives.

908
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,583
Are you sure you parked it here?
- Don't ask me.

909
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:17,000
We were all there.

910
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,625
Where's the boat?

911
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,083
Oh my, God!

912
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,125
Ariana!

913
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,000
You were with her last night?

914
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:32,500
Ask her to return the boat.

915
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,625
I don't think she'll listen.

916
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:41,125
Guys, she's in a bad state.

917
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:44,916
Just last night she was so.. alive.

918
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,083
Come on, Hardik.

919
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,875
You can woo anyone.

920
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,041
Living or zombie.

921
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,333
Don't be silly. - Are you mad?

922
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,166
No, no, it'll be fine.

923
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:53,583
Go on. - Are you mad?

924
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,541
Go. Go on.

925
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:56,875
Go on.

926
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,083
Are you serious? - You can do it.

927
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,833
Come on. - Fine.

928
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,958
All the best.

929
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:22,583
Hi, baby.

930
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:24,916
Remember me. Last night.

931
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,125
Super fun time.

932
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,208
Hardik. Be polite.

933
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,083
Show her love.

934
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:31,041
So hot on this boat.

935
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:33,541
Come inside, take a dip with me.
It's awesome.

936
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:36,125
Come on. Ariana, come.

937
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,333
Come on. Come, baby.

938
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:39,583
I'll get you

939
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:53,375
We got jeep.

940
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,875
We got diesel..

941
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,625
Where's boat?

942
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,666
Hardik's girlfriend took it.

943
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:00,958
Dead girlfriend.

944
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:03,625
The zombie who's in that boat
which is drifting that way.

945
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,541
We don't have a boat. What now?

946
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,075
These currents have a pattern.

947
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,416
If she stays in the boat,
she'll drift back this way.

948
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:16,916
So.. how long?

949
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,250
16- 18 hours.

950
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:21,416
What the fuck?

951
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,041
How will we survive that
long on this island?

952
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:26,000
It's getting dark now.

953
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,666
We need a safe place to sleep.

954
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,833
Let's go.

955
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,833
Oh my God.

956
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:02,583
Let's check it out.

957
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,416
Anything to eat?

958
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:47,458
Some fruits.

959
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,041
I hate fruits.

960
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,458
No pizza.

961
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:55,000
Order for it. It'll be here in 30 minutes.
- Funny.

962
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:04,000
So, what's the plan?

963
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,041
Let's wait here tonight, and leave at dawn.

964
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:11,125
These bananas no good for me.

965
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:13,583
Isn't there anything better to eat?

966
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,875
Hey. Tell us about your Russian girlfriend.

967
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,875
I mean, not that it matters now.

968
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,201
But still, just for the info.

969
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,083
She was awesome.

970
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,000
Just a minute.

971
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:26,625
Are you sure she was fine before you..

972
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,083
Meaning?

973
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,041
I mean, when you were doing her..

974
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:31,625
..was she doing this.

975
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,666
Are you crazy?

976
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,041
Even I've standards.

977
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:35,625
But..

978
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:39,791
Are you infected?

979
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:41,458
What?

980
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,583
You made sex with zombie.

981
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:45,916
That was before.

982
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,375
She was fine then. I am fine now.

983
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:51,250
Yes, I'm fine.

984
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,375
I doubt it.

985
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:56,250
I can talk, zombies don't.

986
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,495
You're not a zombie, but you
can turn into one later.

987
01:03:58,583 --> 01:03:59,791
That's not done.

988
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:02,000
On that basis, will you kill me now?

989
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:03,666
What kind of mafia-ness is this?!

990
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,125
Boris.

991
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:06,750
I think he's fine.

992
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:08,166
We can't take a chance.

993
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:09,708
Everyone's life is in danger.

994
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,750
I want to be 100% sure.

995
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,541
How?

996
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:15,625
7x2 = 14.

997
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:16,625
7x3 = 21.

998
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,250
7x4 = 28.

999
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:19,666
7x5 = 35.

1000
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,458
7x6 = 5.. 42!

1001
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:23,541
That's easy.

1002
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:25,816
Everyone knows the tables up to 10.

1003
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,458
Let's hear you say tables of 14.

1004
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm having a bad time with
7, why are you going to 14.

1005
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,375
And anyway, I use the calculator..

1006
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,980
..on my mobile phone for such things.

1007
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,088
That's the problem with
the younger generation.

1008
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:37,375
Why calculator?

1009
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,458
Can't you use your brains?

1010
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,708
So, you want me to die now.

1011
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,083
Let's make it simple.

1012
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,125
World capitals.

1013
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,041
What is the capital of Uganda?

1014
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:50,916
Your fuck grandmother.

1015
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,916
I will drink your blood.

1016
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,583
You want to eat him? - No, no.

1017
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,000
You want to eat him? - No, no.

1018
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,208
I didn't mean it.

1019
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,083
I don't really want to drink his blood.

1020
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:00,416
I was only threatening him.

1021
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,958
Boris. I think he's fine.

1022
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:05,541
What did you have last night?

1023
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:07,458
Last night I..

1024
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:09,916
I don't remember.

1025
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:12,875
Memory loss. First sign of brain damage.

1026
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,708
No, no, Boris.

1027
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:14,916
My brains already that damaged.

1028
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,791
Luv, tell him.

1029
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,708
Boris, I think he's fine.

1030
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,416
I'm such a fun-loving, jolly boy.

1031
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,875
Luna, do I look like a dead man to you?

1032
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Enough, Boris. He's fine. - Yeah.

1033
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:27,125
We'll see.

1034
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:28,583
Nikolai.

1035
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,000
Will I've to tell his blood-group now?

1036
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:39,696
You want to eat Nikolai? - What?

1037
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,208
Answer me!

1038
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:45,041
Do you want to eat Nikolai, yes or no?
- No.

1039
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,958
But, I want to puke.

1040
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,000
Boris. I think he's fine.

1041
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:51,833
Okay.

1042
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,500
Okay.

1043
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,583
Thank you.

1044
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,000
You.. - What?

1045
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,166
Uganda?

1046
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,250
Curse you..

1047
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,208
I was trying to help him.

1048
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,500
So you..

1049
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:09,833
Keep an eye on him.

1050
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:12,458
If he changes, we have to finish him.

1051
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:15,333
Once he becomes zombie, no mercy.

1052
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:17,083
Friend, sister, mother, brother.

1053
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,541
All the same.

1054
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:19,458
Have to kill.

1055
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,333
Okay. We've something
important to take care of.

1056
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:28,041
Stay here.

1057
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,625
We'll be back. - Now?

1058
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
That's insane.

1059
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:34,708
What could be so important
to risk your lives?

1060
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,625
It's important for me.

1061
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,166
Listen carefully and
remember, and you'll live.

1062
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:43,708
Shut all doors, windows and curtains

1063
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,375
All lights off.

1064
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,458
Only small lights and candles.

1065
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,500
One person keep watch.

1066
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:50,833
Stay together.

1067
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:53,541
At any condition, don't try to be a hero.

1068
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:57,291
I'll be back.

1069
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,500
Chill! Chill! Chill!

1070
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,041
Oh my, God. You scared me.

1071
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:21,291
I'm sorry.

1072
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,750
Look. I couldn't sleep.

1073
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:27,541
So, I thought on checking up on you.

1074
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:28,875
If you want anything?

1075
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,160
I can see that you're sorted.

1076
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,625
I don't want anything.

1077
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,791
I am fine.

1078
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:44,666
Whatever happened last night
on the beach, I am sorry.

1079
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:47,083
It was actually Hardik's idea.

1080
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,166
Some stupid philosophy.

1081
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,333
There's just one cure for a broken heart.

1082
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:52,833
Sex?

1083
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:55,916
No, not sex.

1084
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,750
No one said sex.

1085
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:59,000
What do you think I am?

1086
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:03,625
You're.. you..
- And, you're here to try your luck again.

1087
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,416
Where to where you're going?

1088
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,875
I came to say sorry.

1089
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,250
I am just joking.

1090
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:12,041
Actually, thank you.

1091
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:16,083
If you hadn't come looking
for me, then maybe..

1092
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:19,541
Thank you. - You're welcome.

1093
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:23,291
Okay, go now.

1094
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:25,375
Get some rest.

1095
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,250
So, this is not a moment? - No.

1096
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:38,708
Okay.

1097
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,875
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1098
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,500
It's just me. - Hardik.

1099
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:21,916
What's your problem?

1100
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:24,416
Why are you two taking turns to scare me?

1101
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:26,208
Was Luv here?

1102
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:27,583
Are you both taking turns..

1103
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,958
..to see who gets the girl? - No way.

1104
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:31,708
Luv and me?

1105
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,875
Luv's no competition for me.

1106
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,083
I can see that.

1107
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,833
You know, Luv's got a problem.

1108
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:41,791
He falls for any girl that
talks to him politely.

1109
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,083
He's a bit stupid.

1110
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,648
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

1111
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,250
Mine?.. No.

1112
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:51,958
All this is not for me.

1113
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:53,625
I'm happier like this.

1114
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,708
Wham! Bam! Thank you ma'am!

1115
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:57,791
Something like that.

1116
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,666
How many girls have you been with?

1117
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:05,666
Around two-three.. hundred.

1118
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:10,166
So, you never fell in love. - What?

1119
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,958
Do I look that type?

1120
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:14,750
You don't.

1121
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:18,166
But you must've fallen in
love with someone, sometime.

1122
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:26,291
Love happens.

1123
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:28,291
But the girls keep changing.

1124
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,500
I feel sorry for you.

1125
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:49,791
That bitch.

1126
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,875
Not you, her.

1127
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,958
We used to chat on the internet.

1128
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:00,166
All night we spoke on the phone.

1129
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,916
I loved her so much.

1130
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,166
I bought her gifts every day.

1131
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,708
Chocolates. Teddy bears.

1132
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,875
All the pink stuff.

1133
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:14,666
I wrote a love-letter
for her, with my blood.

1134
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:16,563
I fell unconscious on the third page.

1135
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,125
But I completed it.

1136
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,125
And what did she give me in return?

1137
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,083
That cheat.

1138
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,041
She just left me one day.

1139
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:28,750
That bitch..

1140
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,500
Since then my reputation is ruined.

1141
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,291
They all think that I'm this big..
Sex maniac.

1142
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:37,375
Bloody pervert.

1143
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:41,000
Even you thought I came here to hit on you.

1144
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:44,083
When actually, I was looking for food.

1145
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:47,125
It's okay. It's okay.

1146
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:56,291
I got a little too sentimental.
It never happens.

1147
01:12:56,666 --> 01:13:00,083
No harm in talking. - What?

1148
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:03,541
I was so gay. - It's okay. It's okay.

1149
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,208
What do you think you're doing?

1150
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,541
I thought you..

1151
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,708
No?

1152
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:24,750
Guess I misread the signals. - Oh God!

1153
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:27,666
Maybe you.. No? - Just go.

1154
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:29,083
Okay.

1155
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,750
You sure? - Just go.

1156
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:42,750
Luv?

1157
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,083
Shit.

1158
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:56,791
Bunny.

1159
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,458
Luv. - What are you doing?

1160
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,125
Bunny. Get up.

1161
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:09,291
Got him. Got him.

1162
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,750
Got him.

1163
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:13,416
What's the idea? - I don't know.

1164
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,208
Then this is a very bad idea.

1165
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:16,541
Why did you jump on him?

1166
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:19,000
Pull the blanket off!
- Are you crazy?! He'll bite!

1167
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,083
Bunny. Get up.

1168
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,458
What the hell are you doing?

1169
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,750
Kill him.

1170
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:39,916
Try again.

1171
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,708
What are you doing?

1172
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,793
Looks easier in movies.
- You don't know a thing.

1173
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:45,875
Watch this.

1174
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:48,041
Very good. Good aim.

1175
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:52,166
What are you going to do with this?
- Don't know.

1176
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,583
Is he dead?

1177
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:07,791
Is he dead?

1178
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,041
Don't know.

1179
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:12,416
Check.

1180
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:15,250
You do it.

1181
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:18,833
Let's check together.

1182
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:29,083
He's angrier now.

1183
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,000
Good shot.

1184
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,833
What happened here?

1185
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:55,416
Where did he come from? - Don't know.

1186
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:57,666
Maybe he lives here.

1187
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,000
It's not safe here.

1188
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,125
We should get out.

1189
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,833
Where do you expect to go
in the middle of the night?

1190
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,791
Stay here. This is safe.

1191
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:07,597
How is this safe?

1192
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,958
Didn't he come in. - But, he's dead.

1193
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:10,000
You tried three times..

1194
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:10,791
..and your knife still didn't hit him!

1195
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:11,625
You didn't get him with the torch either.

1196
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:13,000
At least he fell down. - Guys.

1197
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:14,875
I hear something.

1198
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,416
Let's run away..

1199
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:36,333
Shut the fuck up man.

1200
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,208
Run from the backdoor.

1201
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,916
Run. Run.

1202
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:46,875
Just wait.

1203
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:48,375
Let's check first. Okay.

1204
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,875
The path's clear.

1205
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,291
I think we are safe.

1206
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,583
No... zombies!

1207
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:11,750
Close the door.

1208
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,750
This way. Come on.

1209
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:34,973
We've to get out of here. - Yes, but how?

1210
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:36,791
Oh my, God. We're so dead.

1211
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:38,958
I shouldn't have come
here in the first place.

1212
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:42,125
Mom always said, Hardik and Luv will..

1213
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,166
What the.. Shut up!

1214
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:47,458
Just think what to do.

1215
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,291
Okay.

1216
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:53,583
Zombies.

1217
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:55,083
What do we know?

1218
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:56,750
What have we learnt?

1219
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,625
That they are zombies. - Yes.

1220
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,250
And they want to eat us. - Correct.

1221
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,000
But they walk slowly.

1222
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,416
And.. they're dumb.

1223
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,833
They've nothing up here.

1224
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:09,166
They can't open doors, climb trees..

1225
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:10,750
Can't play Cricket, have babies.

1226
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:11,750
What's the idea?

1227
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:16,375
The idea is.. we pretend to be them.

1228
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:20,458
We'll act like zombies, and they'll
believe we're like them only.

1229
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:23,333
That's your idea? - Rubbish.

1230
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,458
It's simple.

1231
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:27,791
Walk slow, walk crooked.
And you'll look like them.

1232
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,333
He's crazy.

1233
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:32,458
I saw it in a movie. Okay?

1234
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,208
Did it work in the movie?

1235
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:35,933
Don't remember.

1236
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:36,958
Very good.

1237
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:40,250
Hardik.

1238
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:42,708
Hardik, let's get out of here..
- Just a second.

1239
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:45,208
Luv, actually your idea's the best idea.

1240
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,000
I suggest.. you go. - Yes.

1241
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:49,666
No, no, no. It's a bad idea.

1242
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:50,875
Very bad idea.

1243
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,666
Weren't you pushing me last time?

1244
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:56,041
Look, it's your idea, so you go.

1245
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:58,583
And, if it works, we'll follow.
- That's fair.

1246
01:18:58,708 --> 01:18:59,348
Come on. - Okay.

1247
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:00,541
Don't think anything.

1248
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,500
You can do this.

1249
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:02,958
You can do this, Luv.

1250
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,208
Go on. - Come on, Luv.

1251
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:05,708
All the best.

1252
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:53,541
Priyanka!

1253
01:19:58,333 --> 01:19:59,666
Fucker!

1254
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:06,333
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1255
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:10,375
Oh no..

1256
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,458
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1257
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,375
This way! This way!

1258
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,166
That was a great idea.

1259
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:42,625
Bloody Einstein, chickens
can also walk on two legs.

1260
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,958
But they don't become human.

1261
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:44,750
What?

1262
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,291
These things recognize their food..

1263
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,500
..and right now we are the chicken!

1264
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:52,000
Guys, we should keep walking. - Yes.

1265
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:57,666
Can't see a thing. I'm scared.

1266
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,750
Keep walking.

1267
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:03,541
It'll be morning soon. We just have to
reach the boat. We'll be safe there.

1268
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:08,125
And Boris? Will he
directly come to the boat?

1269
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:12,125
Forget Boris. He's gone
to do his important work.

1270
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,791
"Drops. Waves. The morning rays."

1271
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:26,875
"The lazy night that sleeps all day."

1272
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:31,125
"Fireflies. Stars. Sweet and sour."

1273
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:34,208
"The gifts of time."

1274
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:38,000
"The eyes of the heart."

1275
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:41,791
"As I opened them, I realized."

1276
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:49,125
"These views are so beautiful."

1277
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:52,791
"To my buddies."

1278
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:57,458
"To the grace I was blessed with."

1279
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:00,166
"I welcome them from my heart."

1280
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,375
Dear God!

1281
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:07,333
Are you still here? - Hardik. Hardik.

1282
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:12,000
Okay. Please, please, please. Save me.

1283
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:15,250
Luv, Bunny and Luna. Actually,
save all of us, please.

1284
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:17,791
I'll forsake all bad habits.

1285
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,833
I'll stop flirting with
girls, no drinking..

1286
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:21,291
..no drugs. No porn.

1287
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,666
I'll watch a little porn. Can't lie to you.

1288
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:25,625
I will answer my mother's calls.

1289
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:29,125
And I'll get back to you
with a proper list.

1290
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:31,041
But, I've to go now. Jai Hind!

1291
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:34,833
"To my buddies."

1292
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:39,416
"To the grace I was blessed with."

1293
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:43,916
"I welcome you with my heart."

1294
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:55,416
Hardik. Listen.

1295
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,333
Sorry.

1296
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,833
We should've never doubted
you turned into a zombie.

1297
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,041
Don't bring that up again, Bunny.

1298
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:03,166
Topic over.

1299
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:05,041
Don't worry.

1300
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,958
I'll be the first one to die amongst us.
- Very good.

1301
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,500
What philosophy is that?

1302
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:11,750
You two are the heroes.

1303
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:13,708
Luna's the heroine.

1304
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:14,875
That leaves me.

1305
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:16,958
Hero's friend.

1306
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,625
As long as my comedy's working, it's fine.

1307
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,875
Once that's dead, so am I.

1308
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:24,126
That's what normally happens
in such a situation.

1309
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:25,375
Just watch.

1310
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,083
Those rascals will first
attack the hero's friend.

1311
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:30,125
Bunny, do you seriously
think in so much detail?

1312
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,875
Just watch, I will die first.

1313
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,440
Why are you so obsessed about dying?

1314
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,083
Go die. I won't stop you.

1315
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:38,041
I have to go pee.

1316
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:17,291
Not today. Die another day!

1317
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:18,958
Come on.

1318
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:43,000
Looks safe.

1319
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:44,333
Let's go.

1320
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,791
Are you sure? - Yeah.

1321
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:47,250
Do we have to go this way?

1322
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,708
Yes, or else we'll have to circle around.

1323
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:51,541
And no one knows the way.

1324
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:52,958
And we can't miss the boat.

1325
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Come on, Bunny, let's go.

1326
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,125
I'm very hungry. Very hungry.

1327
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,750
Wait it out. Let's get out of here first.

1328
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:13,541
I'm hungry too. - Bunch of school kids.

1329
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:15,041
Let's check the tents.

1330
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:17,208
Bunny, you check this one. - Yes.

1331
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:18,666
I'll check those.

1332
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,708
Guys, we're supposed to
stay together, right.

1333
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:47,125
Where's the food.. must be in here.

1334
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:50,958
Did you find anything?

1335
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:13,875
Bunny. Found anything to eat?

1336
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:17,125
Say something. - Zombie! Zombie!

1337
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,708
What? - Zombie! Zombie!

1338
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:20,791
If we stay here, we'll be food.

1339
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,000
What? Really?

1340
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:23,333
Oh God!

1341
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:29,750
One second.

1342
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:30,875
Oh no!

1343
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:34,875
What now?
- We walked right into their mouths!

1344
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,541
Run! Run!

1345
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:49,833
This way. Come on.

1346
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:07,875
Where's Bunny?

1347
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,291
Bunny! - Bunny!

1348
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:12,541
Bunny! - Bunny!

1349
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:20,208
Bunny! - Let's go.

1350
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:21,791
Let's go.

1351
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,208
Hardik! - Luv.

1352
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,458
We should do something.

1353
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,791
We'll have to distract them.

1354
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:46,083
Yeah, me too.

1355
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:48,250
Hey!

1356
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:52,125
Hey! - Draw their attention!

1357
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:53,708
Zombies!

1358
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:56,208
Hey!

1359
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:58,666
Look.

1360
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,333
Come here.

1361
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:03,500
Come on.

1362
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:11,250
Come on.

1363
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,708
Hardik!

1364
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,500
Come on.

1365
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,583
Hardik!

1366
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,166
Hardik.

1367
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,875
Run! Run!

1368
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:36,625
Run! Run!

1369
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:57,000
Boris!

1370
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,583
Guys! Hurry up!

1371
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:20,958
Move to the car, quick.

1372
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:26,333
Nikolai. Start the car.

1373
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,625
Oh my God! Boris!

1374
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:56,666
Bunny!

1375
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,416
Boris.

1376
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:14,458
Nikolai is..

1377
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,958
The boat must be coming back.

1378
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Any minute now.

1379
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,125
Some coke?

1380
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:04,458
You'll feel good.

1381
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:09,833
No, thank you. No drugs for me.

1382
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,333
I want to feel it.

1383
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,041
Okay.

1384
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:21,833
God. What the..

1385
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:24,750
What's this?

1386
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:27,458
Not right.

1387
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:31,458
You went back for these, right.

1388
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:33,250
Leaving us to die.

1389
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:36,000
Do you know what this is worth?

1390
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:39,125
Not more than life.

1391
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:41,375
No.

1392
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:42,833
No, no, no.

1393
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:45,083
All of you came here on your own.

1394
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:49,291
You had booze, got high, had
fun, and did it willingly.

1395
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:51,791
And now, when the situation changed..

1396
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,375
..I'm responsible for your life?

1397
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:56,000
This is your fault.

1398
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,375
You brought those new drugs
and people started dying.

1399
01:32:58,458 --> 01:32:59,791
Don't start again.

1400
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:01,750
If it wasn't for me..

1401
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,625
..you would've been chewing on each other.

1402
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:06,083
And I also saved your..

1403
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,000
..saved your lives, right?

1404
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:11,375
I saved your little ass, didn't I?

1405
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:14,583
So take it easy, baby.

1406
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:19,333
He was ready for the presentation.

1407
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,875
I dragged him here.

1408
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:28,083
He would've been stuck in
that useless presentation.

1409
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:35,333
At least he escaped that
boring presentation.

1410
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:43,208
Phone?

1411
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:46,666
You've signal.

1412
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,625
Bunny. Hello.

1413
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:49,958
Hello, Hardik.

1414
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,583
Hardik, where are you?

1415
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:52,916
Are you alive?

1416
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:54,875
Of course I'm alive.

1417
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:57,291
Why else would I call you? - Yes!

1418
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:58,750
Come soon, save me. - Thank God!

1419
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:02,291
Come quickly or they'll kill me.
Where are you?

1420
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,780
What do you mean "Where are we"?

1421
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:05,083
We're coming to get you.

1422
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:06,208
Where are you?

1423
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:08,666
I.. I.. I'm on top of the tower.

1424
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:09,833
Hello.

1425
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:11,291
Hello. - Bunny!

1426
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:14,000
Hello. Hardik! Hardik! Hardik! Hello!

1427
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:15,583
Oh no.

1428
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Bunny.

1429
01:34:17,291 --> 01:34:18,691
He's alive. He's at the rave party.

1430
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:19,791
I'll go get him.

1431
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:21,125
I got him here.

1432
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:22,500
I will go save him now.

1433
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:25,458
Sorry, God! I abused you in a fit of rage.
- Hardik.

1434
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:26,583
Thank you.

1435
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,040
You aren't alone. I'm coming along too.
- Let's go.

1436
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:35,833
You're coming, right?

1437
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,625
Do I have a bloody choice?

1438
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:45,583
Without me you'll be mincemeat!

1439
01:34:55,375 --> 01:34:56,916
Oh no.

1440
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:13,541
Oh no.

1441
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,750
Let's kill dead people!

1442
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:26,958
Hardik!

1443
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,208
Mr. Boris! Here!

1444
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,958
Hardik! Get Bunny. We cover you.

1445
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,708
How many of them are there? - 1399.

1446
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,208
How do you know?

1447
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:04,583
It was my party.

1448
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:05,791
These are my guests.

1449
01:37:09,916 --> 01:37:12,125
Hardik. Come quickly.

1450
01:37:14,166 --> 01:37:15,791
Hardik.

1451
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:23,125
Hardik. Hardik.

1452
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,250
You're alive.

1453
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:27,333
I thought you're calling from heaven.

1454
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,583
Bunny is safe. We got Bunny.

1455
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:31,333
Hardik, I love you.

1456
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:33,041
I love you. - I love you too.

1457
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:35,750
But, how are you alive?
- It's a long story.

1458
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:40,708
I see..

1459
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:43,875
What to do? - Bunny. Bunny. Bunny.

1460
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:44,958
I think we'll have to jump.

1461
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,125
Are you crazy? - Or they'll eat us.

1462
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:49,041
Are you crazy? - Bunny, listen to me.

1463
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:12,000
Fuck..

1464
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:13,375
You guys, that way.

1465
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:18,333
Oh no!

1466
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:34,875
Back up! Back up!

1467
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,291
What now?

1468
01:38:38,375 --> 01:38:41,000
Keep shooting.
- I've got no bullets, Boris.

1469
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,750
Here, take this. - No.

1470
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,208
Go. I cover you.

1471
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:47,125
Are you sure? - They will kill you.

1472
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:48,625
Get out of here, quick.

1473
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:50,791
Take it.

1474
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:54,125
Go. - Thank you.

1475
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:56,875
Fast. Hurry up.

1476
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,000
Come and get me.

1477
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:41,625
Bunny. - Luv.

1478
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:42,583
Bunny. - Luv.

1479
01:39:42,666 --> 01:39:43,875
You're alive.

1480
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:45,916
Just you two? Where's Boris?

1481
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:47,625
Boris is still stuck back there.

1482
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:48,791
There are too many zombies.

1483
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:50,075
Oh, God! - How did you escape?

1484
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:53,250
You won't believe it. It's a long story.

1485
01:39:53,333 --> 01:39:54,333
What the..

1486
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:55,833
At least tell us now. - Okay.

1487
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:58,666
It happened like this. Once
I separated from you..

1488
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,791
'Get out. Get out. - Listen.'

1489
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,208
'Get out.'

1490
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,000
'Go away.. - Listen, please.'

1491
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:08,583
'Go away. Go. Go away.'

1492
01:40:08,666 --> 01:40:09,708
'Go.'

1493
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,750
'Oh no.'

1494
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,583
No. No.

1495
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:22,208
'Bunny.'

1496
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,875
Let's go.

1497
01:40:44,291 --> 01:40:46,583
'No, no, no.'

1498
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,500
Go back.

1499
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:02,916
You always said, mixing two
drugs gives side-effects.

1500
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:05,835
I think, it's happening
with the zombies as well.

1501
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:08,833
The coke stopped them in their tracks.

1502
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:13,791
And I escaped.

1503
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:18,833
Coke!

1504
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:29,166
Boris.

1505
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,791
Shoot this.

1506
01:41:33,208 --> 01:41:34,541
What you doing? - Oh no.

1507
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:37,041
That's 10,000 dollars, asshole.

1508
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:38,625
Just shoot it.

1509
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,458
Throw more, its working.

1510
01:41:56,583 --> 01:41:58,625
It's working. It's working.

1511
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:27,625
He is safe.

1512
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:39,083
Nikolai.

1513
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:44,458
Boris, shoot him.

1514
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:47,458
Sorry my old friend.

1515
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:49,583
Goodbye.

1516
01:42:56,416 --> 01:42:57,916
Quickly. Boris.

1517
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:24,875
Please don't shoot. - What?

1518
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:26,791
She's only a zombie.

1519
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:29,000
She maybe a zombie now.

1520
01:43:29,916 --> 01:43:31,333
But she was a babe until yesterday.

1521
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:34,208
Allow me.

1522
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:41,500
Ariana.

1523
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:46,666
Ariana. Baby.

1524
01:43:46,875 --> 01:43:48,041
Baby.

1525
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:32,583
Go, go, go. - Quickly.

1526
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:34,375
Run, run.

1527
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:36,041
Let's go. Let's go.

1528
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:44,208
Bye, Ariana.

1529
01:44:44,791 --> 01:44:46,083
I will miss you.

1530
01:44:52,541 --> 01:44:54,666
What do you think? What does all this mean?

1531
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:56,875
As in?

1532
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,958
What do we know? What have we learnt?

1533
01:45:03,166 --> 01:45:05,500
Drugs can Fuck you up.

1534
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
That's what I learnt.

1535
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,500
They can turn you into a zombie.

1536
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:14,916
You should always respect women.

1537
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:18,875
You never know who might try to bite you.

1538
01:45:20,458 --> 01:45:21,416
I am serious.

1539
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,958
Karma is bitch, my friends!

1540
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:34,541
Finally, Goa!

1541
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:36,250
We are safe!

1542
01:46:06,375 --> 01:46:07,916
Oh no..

1543
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:47,125
Dude!

1544
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:49,458
"Take a puff."

1545
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:51,625
"Baba's herb."

1546
01:46:55,166 --> 01:46:57,250
"Baba's herb."

1547
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:02,791
"Baba's herb."

1548
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:08,708
"Baba's herb."

1549
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:17,833
"When we take a puff, we become heroes."

1550
01:47:17,916 --> 01:47:23,500
"Life seems like a movie and
there are no problems."

1551
01:47:23,583 --> 01:47:29,166
"Alcohol. It's a bad thing."

1552
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:34,958
"Herb is God's grace."

1553
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
"Baba's herb."

1554
01:47:40,625 --> 01:47:42,583
"Baba's herb."

1555
01:47:57,291 --> 01:48:01,375
"Let me take you to the Baba."

1556
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:06,708
"Baba spreads joy and ends sufferings."

1557
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:09,833
"Baba is beautiful."

1558
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:17,541
"Whether it's an affair with a girl."

1559
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:23,125
"Or if your boss is a demon."

1560
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:28,916
"The herb is the solution
of every problem."

1561
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,583
"It gives strength when
you are frustrated."

1562
01:48:34,666 --> 01:48:36,583
"Baba's herb."

1563
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:50,000
Look, what's that?

1564
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:52,000
Is it a bird?

1565
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:54,083
No, you fool. It's a plane.

1566
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:56,500
Look, the underwear is inside-out.

1567
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:57,833
Superman.

1568
01:48:57,916 --> 01:49:00,125
No. That is Baba.

1569
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:10,791
Glory to Baba.

1570
01:49:11,541 --> 01:49:13,583
Glory to Baba.

1571
01:49:14,416 --> 01:49:17,958
Here, there is no differentiation
between rich and poor.

1572
01:49:19,208 --> 01:49:22,125
There is interruption in Baba's telecast.

1573
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:26,250
But no one is sorry for the interruption.

1574
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:32,833
The ring of solution on the
middle finger of problem.

1575
01:49:32,916 --> 01:49:34,250
Baba's herb.

1576
01:49:35,833 --> 01:49:37,708
Baba's herb.

1577
01:49:39,333 --> 01:49:40,708
Baba, I love you.

1578
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:19,916
"Drops. Waves. The morning rays."

1579
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,166
"The lazy night that sleeps all day."

1580
01:50:23,625 --> 01:50:27,250
"Fireflies. Stars. Sweet and sour."

1581
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:30,708
"The gifts of time."

1582
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,916
"The eyes of the heart."

1583
01:50:35,416 --> 01:50:37,333
"As I opened them, I realized."

1584
01:50:39,083 --> 01:50:44,000
"These views are so beautiful."

1585
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:48,833
"To my buddies."

1586
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:52,625
"To the grace I was blessed with."

1587
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:57,875
"I welcome them from my heart."

1588
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:18,375
"It's the sweet moments of life."

1589
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,958
"The grievances of last night
will lose itself in it."

1590
01:51:27,041 --> 01:51:33,333
"Some innocent feeling is this."

1591
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:38,708
"It's the grace bestowed on the heart."

1592
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:44,291
"To my buddies."

1593
01:51:44,375 --> 01:51:48,000
"To the grace I was blessed with."

1594
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:52,875
"I welcome them from my heart."
