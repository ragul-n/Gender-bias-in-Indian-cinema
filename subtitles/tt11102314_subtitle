00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:14,083
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

2
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:55,833
DEAR ANU AND

3
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,500
You can write later
if your hand is hurting.

4
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,000
Will you stop that!

5
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,541
Ms. Nayan…

6
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,791
Let me write in peace.

7
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,250
I'll write at my own pace.

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,416
Thank you.

9
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
How lovely!

10
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,166
-Put a black dot for the evil eye.
-Anu…

11
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,916
Wow! Looking gorgeous.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,791
Thank you. Easy there.

13
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,250
I'm sorry I'm late.
The meeting dragged on.

14
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,041
If you wouldn't have come on time…

15
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,541
How wouldn't I?
Have I ever missed your performance?

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,708
The audience is great today.

17
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,666
-Hey, Anu…
-Mom…

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,750
What?

19
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,625
Wasn't it I who decided to quit smoking
during your pregnancy?

20
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,708
So, trust me, I won't.

21
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,875
There's no harm in just holding it.
You've become the moral police.

22
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,541
-Seriously--
-Okay, relax.

23
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,416
Ma'am, you're on in five minutes.

24
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,791
I know. Let me breathe, will you?

25
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,875
Okay, ma'am. Sorry.

26
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,583
Seat Raghav and Masha in the audience.

27
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,541
-Okay.
-Thank you.

28
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,333
Okay. Have a good performance.

29
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,958
All the best. Come.

30
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:19,291
MAYA PRESENTS - ODISHA MAHOTSAV
SPECIAL PERFORMANCE BY ANURADHA APTE

31
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,958
<i>Thank you so much, Apoorva.</i>

32
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:29,041
And now, it's the moment
we have all been waiting for.

33
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,791
<i>A performance by one of the most famous</i>
<i>Bollywood actresses</i>

34
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>everyone's favorite, Anuradha Apte.</i>

35
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,500
<i>Anuradha Apte has been awarded</i>

36
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:49,208
<i>with the Padma Shri</i>
<i>for her excellence in Odissi.</i>

37
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,083
I was just wondering…

38
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,916
Is there some living left to do?

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,833
No.

40
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,916
Perhaps only dying's left to do.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,875
No, Ms. Nayan.

42
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,666
That was not pleasant to the ears.

43
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,083
Talking about death doesn't suit you.

44
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,666
Okay, I will change my words for you.

45
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,500
Is there anything left to live for?

46
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,333
Yes.

47
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,208
The glass isn't empty yet.

48
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,916
Yes. This suits you.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,375
Speaking of alcohol suits me?

50
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,625
Yes.

51
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,833
But you wouldn't know
of the joys of a drink!

52
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,625
To teach you to drink
is what's left to do.

53
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
Ms. Nayan!

54
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,666
Rani!

55
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,125
Just explain to them
that it's an emergency.

56
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,625
And as soon as I find out,
I'll give them another date. Okay?

57
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,708
And you don't call me.
Instead, I'll call you.

58
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,708
Okay? Please.

59
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,458
-It's not coming out.
-Let it be.

60
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,833
Okay, bye, Shantanu.

61
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,750
Just leave it, okay?

62
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,625
Yes, Deepak. Grandma got a brain stroke.

63
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,791
We've admitted her
at the Silver Cloud Hospital.

64
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,125
No, we had to stop the show midway.

65
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,250
Fuck! Asshole! Fucker, can't you see?
Are those eyes or buttons?

66
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,000
He can't hear you through the glass.

67
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,166
He can see, can't he?

68
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,208
-That's the whole point of driving.
-Relax.

69
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:46,458
No, please don't give it to your mom.
You take care of her. Okay. Bye.

70
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,708
Give, I'll try that again.

71
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,458
-It's okay.
-Okay, fine.

72
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,458
Oh, God.

73
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,541
Parking is full.

74
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,125
Do these journalists
smell tragedies from afar?

75
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,375
-Bloody vultures.
-Listen, please ignore them and calm down.

76
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,416
I'll be as calm as Buddha.

77
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,500
Is that Milan?

78
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,875
How did this asshole get here?

79
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,208
He's the one
who got Grandma to the hospital.

80
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,000
He's the one who called Shantanu.

81
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:21,875
Come.

82
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,708
You go ahead. I'll park the car,
handle the formalities and come.

83
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,750
Okay.

84
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,458
Ma'am, your mother is in a coma.
How do you feel about it?

85
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,166
If your mother was in a coma,
would you have liked it?

86
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,583
No, but your relationship
with your mother isn't great.

87
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,500
So what?

88
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,500
She's my mother.

89
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,458
Please, let us go.

90
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,916
Mr. Upadhyay told us that Ms. Nayantara's
biography will be controversial.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,875
Your comments?

92
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:48,666
When you read my autobiography, you will
understand what controversial truly means.

93
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,083
-Are you writing an autobiography?
-Ma'am, photo please.

94
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,875
"Please?" Is this a red carpet?
It's a hospital. You people are inhumane.

95
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:00,625
So, that was Anuradha Apte,
one of Bollywood's notorious actresses.

96
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,791
Her first movie,
<i>Dil kii Dhadkan</i>,<i> </i>was a hit.

97
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,958
Controversy queen Anuradha

98
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,666
came to the hospital
in a fancy dress to see her ailing mother.

99
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,125
{\an8}Her mother's in a coma.
She's here after hearing the news.

100
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,041
<i>Mr. Milan, could you tell us</i>
<i>something about Ms. Nayantara?</i>

101
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,875
Ms. Nayan won the Sahitya Akademi Award
for her first novel <i>Nirabhra.</i>

102
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,916
A National Award winning movie
called <i>Nayi Raah</i> was based on that.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,916
You'll get to know of
all her achievements in her biography.

104
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,875
What about her personal life
and her relationship with Ms. Anu?

105
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,208
Yes. Her biography contains

106
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:37,083
many facts and anecdotes about
her personal life and relationships.

107
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,000
Do one thing.

108
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,041
Give her this injection and tell me
how she's feeling in half an hour.

109
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,458
-Hello, Ms. Anuradha.
-Doctor! Anu, please.

110
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,125
I'm Dr. Mayekar.

111
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,125
I've done Ms. Nayan's initial check-up.

112
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,125
She's in a coma,
but there's nothing to worry about.

113
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,250
She's in a coma
and it's nothing to worry about?

114
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,666
Ma'am, I mean,
I don't see any other complications.

115
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,125
-No--
-She will be fine, right?

116
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:07,625
We'll observe her for the next 72 hours.
We have to do a few tests.

117
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:12,125
I have spoken to the press.
So, you don't have to worry about that.

118
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,750
Thank you, Doctor.

119
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,875
May we see her?

120
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,000
What the fuck?

121
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,583
It is not allowed actually.

122
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,125
You may see her from outside the room.

123
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,708
Sister, from outside the room.
Only one minute.

124
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,250
-Okay? Thank you.
-Okay, sir.

125
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,166
Thanks.

126
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,750
Please come.

127
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,041
Never seen Grandma this helpless before.

128
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,625
She doesn't want to be burnt.

129
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,125
What?

130
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,625
Ms. Nayan didn't want the body-burning
ritual after her death. She told me--

131
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:23,041
Hey, you body-burning ass! Who asked you?
First of all, let me tell you…

132
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,916
It is not "burn." It is "cremate."

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If you don't know English,
then don't try speaking it, asshole.

134
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,583
Secondly, she's not dead yet.
Ready to cremate her, fucking idiot!

135
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,916
Yes, Raghav.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,125
Wait at the reception. We're coming.

137
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,583
Yes, Deepak, I'm just leaving
the hospital. No, I'll tell you at home.

138
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,791
I had to leave for an emergency
in the middle of the show.

139
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:07,416
Do you think I had the time to change
my outfit and make it to the hospital?

140
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,833
<i>Anu, relax.</i>
<i>You know how journalism is nowadays.</i>

141
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,625
<i>How can you expect them to be sensitive?</i>

142
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,916
They're a bunch of assholes, I swear.

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,666
Now they're playing the same clip again.

144
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,625
They're always spouting nonsense,

145
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,500
but how can they call
an Odissi outfit a fancy dress?

146
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,750
I mean, like,
do they even know anything about culture?

147
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,291
Then the Twitter trolls started.

148
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,916
<i>-This isn't new to you. Just ignore them.</i>
-God.

149
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,541
-Yeah. Tell me.
<i>-Listen, I was thinking--</i>

150
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,375
This asshole is here today as well.

151
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,333
<i>Who?</i>

152
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,291
That Milan! Who else? Fucker!

153
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,041
<i>-Okay, don't get angry.</i>
-Yeah.

154
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,333
-What?
<i>-Anu?</i>

155
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,708
Ma'am, smoking isn't allowed here.

156
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,541
-Did I light it up?
-No.

157
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,916
-Then?
-Sorry.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,250
<i>Are you smoking, Anu?</i>

159
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,208
No! Please don't start.

160
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,500
<i>Okay, listen.</i>
<i>I'll catch up with you later.</i>

161
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,833
Okay. Fine.

162
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,833
<i>Bye.</i>

163
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,416
Where are you taking her?

164
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,333
Shut up!

165
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,875
Ms. Nayan was right about you.

166
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,583
What did she say?

167
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,416
That you're very rude.

168
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,500
That's a compliment.

169
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,083
And stonyhearted.

170
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,583
<i>I'm </i>stonyhearted?
Who was ready to cremate her yesterday?

171
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,666
Waiting for her to die, no?

172
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,083
So the copyrights of her books go to you.

173
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,208
I know that
she's left the copyrights to you.

174
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,458
-How can you talk such drivel?
-What?

175
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,125
I mean, what you are saying is wrong.

176
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,041
What I'm saying is absolutely right.
That's why you were so scared.

177
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,291
Fucking gold digger.

178
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,291
You're wrong. I'm not like that.

179
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,875
Then what are you like?

180
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,666
-I worship her. She's my idol.
-Right.

181
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,333
I'm the biggest admirer of her writings.

182
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,500
You won't understand
that relationship or her writings.

183
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,083
You have no respect for her.

184
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,166
Ms. Nayan and I… we are wired similarly.

185
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,375
Wired similarly, eh?
Now that wire's been cut. She's in a coma.

186
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,291
Now roam around haplessly, without a wire.

187
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,208
Wireless.

188
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,375
Ma'am, sir, silence please.

189
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,291
-There's a patient here.
-Can she hear us?

190
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,625
She's in a fucking coma.

191
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,750
Fuck!

192
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,416
Robindro?

193
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,416
It's been so long since we last met.

194
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,833
How are you?

195
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,958
How do I look?

196
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,958
What are you doing here?

197
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,125
I wanted some peace.
Milan's face really irritates me.

198
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,166
Nayan's student?

199
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,291
Nayan's fucking tail.

200
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,500
Hey, come on…

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,750
But is there any peace here?

202
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,083
All the chaos is here.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,208
Block it right there.

204
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,333
Come on, try it.

205
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,416
I guess
your trick is working a little bit.

206
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,500
See.

207
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,250
You can become a saint or a guru.
You'll earn millions. I'm telling you.

208
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,291
Oh, no.

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,083
What will I do with millions?

210
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,500
I can't take money with me when I die,
can I?

211
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,041
Also, money doesn't guarantee happiness.

212
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,916
I've seen many sad millionaires.

213
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,750
You aren't human-like anymore.

214
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:27,875
You're almost saint-like.

215
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,750
Nothing like that.

216
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,708
Anyway, how is Nayan?

217
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,625
She's great. She's in a coma.

218
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,916
Silent zone. Perfect.

219
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,166
It's a good thing
that she's breathing on her own.

220
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,291
Actually it's a better idea
that you've taken this private room.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,458
You will have complete privacy here.

222
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,541
Yeah, that's true.

223
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,541
Another thing is, in these cases…

224
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,458
we can't really predict…

225
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,166
when a patient will come out of a coma.

226
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,958
-Hope you understand.
-Yeah.

227
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,541
I'll take your leave.

228
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,541
If you need anything,
you can always call me.

229
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,208
<i>Hare Krishna.</i>

230
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,041
I don't like evenings.

231
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,791
I hate twilight.

232
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,166
The time to light the evening lamps.

233
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,208
<i>Salutations to the light</i>
<i>Of the auspicious lamp</i>

234
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,083
<i>For good health and wealth</i>

235
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,041
<i>May evil intentions be vanquished</i>

236
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,541
<i>We bow before the sacred flame</i>

237
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:43,958
<i>We light a lamp to the Gods</i>
<i>That which illuminates the holy basil</i>

238
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:48,250
<i>My salutations to all the Gods</i>

239
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,708
Come, now let's switch on
all the lights in the house.

240
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,000
Wait… let me do that.

241
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,500
Stay aside. Wait.

242
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,416
It's time to light the evening lamps,
but she has kept her room in darkness.

243
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,166
All she thinks of
is her writing and nothing else.

244
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,166
As if she's writing the <i>Bhagavad Gita.</i>

245
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,916
Nayan, switch on the light!

246
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,041
Hey, Nandi Bull…

247
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,583
Do you have
any bad news for these children?

248
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,833
Have you come
to make trouble for these children?

249
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:43,791
He says, "No!"

250
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,125
Will you bless these children
for their school work?

251
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,916
Will these children have a bright future?

252
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,583
Come on, Anu.

253
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,375
Dad?

254
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,291
Nayan!

255
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:05,541
Mom, there's a fly on your face,
and you can't flick it away.

256
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,541
How will Nayan recognize you if you
talk to her in such an adorable voice?

257
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:14,000
You're calling her "Mom"
and not even arguing with her.

258
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,375
Where do I argue?
In fact, I don't even talk.

259
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,375
And has she ever spoken nicely to us?

260
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,708
Now look at her.
She's sleeping peacefully in a coma.

261
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,500
I mean, nobody would think

262
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,916
she is capable of the fucking nonsense
that she's put us through.

263
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,791
Let it go, Anu.

264
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,708
What can she do about it now?

265
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,458
Also, we can't really rewind our life
and live it again.

266
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,416
That's true.

267
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,625
But you can say sorry.

268
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,541
Just one apology.

269
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,750
"Sorry, Anu, for fucking up your life."

270
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,583
"Sorry, Robindro, I ruined your life."

271
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,375
-She could do that at least.
-We've not had it that bad.

272
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,875
How can you say that?
She made my life hell.

273
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,333
This is not the end, Anu.

274
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,250
The Lord gives us many opportunities
to apologize to each other.

275
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:20,208
We will be reborn many times
to pay our debts.

276
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,916
We die and are reborn. It's a cycle.

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,916
Please. One life with Nayan is enough.

278
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,375
I don't want to meet her in my next life.

279
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,583
Then forgive her.

280
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:38,041
Or else you'll have no choice
but to be reborn again.

281
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,500
"Choice"?

282
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,541
When did we ever have a choice?

283
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,250
Did we get to choose
our parents before we were born?

284
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,958
In our childhood,
did anyone ask us what we wanted?

285
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,500
We never had a choice.

286
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,000
We don't have a choice.

287
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:59,625
<i>Choice.</i>

288
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,458
<i>Choosing.</i>

289
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,166
<i>This is what it's all about.</i>

290
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,958
We elders take decisions for children.
Where do they have a choice?

291
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:09,875
Yes.

292
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,833
So in my autobiography,

293
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,875
I want to give them
an opportunity to blame me all they want.

294
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,541
Our memory is very selective.

295
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,458
PREFACE

296
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,541
<i>Isn't it?</i>

297
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,291
<i>Our memory hides our faults…</i>

298
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,958
<i>and makes the good in us</i>
<i>seem larger than life.</i>

299
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,916
<i>Yes.</i>

300
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,166
<i>To know the truth about oneself,</i>

301
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,958
<i>it's important to know the viewpoint</i>
<i>of one's significant other.</i>

302
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:44,666
I wish I could write
my autobiography with my own hands.

303
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,958
There'd be no need
for this recording then.

304
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,125
<i>The way I wrote… so fast.</i>

305
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,791
<i>Just a paper, pen and ink.</i>

306
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,833
<i>My imagination had no limit.</i>

307
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,291
Nayan, Ravi wants milk.

308
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,666
Mom, you write. I'll give it.

309
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,416
Of course.
Your mother has no hands, right?

310
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,208
She's too busy writing, after all.

311
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,625
Come. How was your day?

312
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,541
Great.

313
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,375
Did you take your pills?

314
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,750
Yes, I did.

315
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,875
What's up, kiddo?

316
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,791
Hi, Anu. Where's Mom?

317
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,000
Where do you think? It's been three hours…

318
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,541
She's writing!

319
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,958
Even if I were dying, she'd say,
"Mother, don't die now."

320
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,333
-"Let me finish this writing first."
-Mother, patience!

321
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,541
As if those flowers will change anything.

322
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,583
I don't want flowers.
I want peace at home.

323
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,583
Fine, tomorrow I'll bring
a kilo of peace with the flowers.

324
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,333
Is this all a joke to you?

325
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,541
Don't you get
that I want peace in this house?

326
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:05,791
I come home tired from work,
no one has offered me a glass of water…

327
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:09,541
All you both do is complain
about your problems, I'm sick of all this…

328
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,791
That's right!

329
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,291
You don't have answers,
so you just walk away!

330
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,208
Vinayak?

331
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:20,333
He bought such nice flowers.
Can't you even talk to him properly?

332
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,916
Very beautiful.

333
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,833
-Congratulations, Nayan.
-Thank you.

334
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,041
What can I say about your writing?

335
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,166
She's the topic of conversation
at every literary conference.

336
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,208
That's amazing, Nayan.

337
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,250
Thank you.

338
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,125
Never let the ink in your pen dry up.

339
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,125
-Cheers.
-Keep writing.

340
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,791
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

341
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,208
Okay. I'll be right back.

342
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,666
Vimal, the guests love your sago patty.
Please make some more.

343
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,458
Yes, as soon as I finish
with these coriander patties.

344
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,583
Your pseudo intellectual friends
are having fun, aren't they?

345
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,041
Mom, not today, please.

346
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,750
Let's not do a song and dance
in front of the guests.

347
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,833
"Song and dance"?

348
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,791
You think I'm some cheap performer?

349
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,250
Mother, let it go… Not today, please.

350
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,291
Why should I let it go?

351
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,250
Your wife is celebrated by outsiders…

352
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,833
but her house is in a mess.

353
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,583
Your wife can't cook,
she doesn't do anything in the house.

354
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,208
Why should I praise her?

355
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,250
All she does is write!

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,250
Even if one of her children is dying,
she won't stop writing.

357
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:35,916
Please.

358
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:48,750
Nayan.

359
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,041
I can't live without my writing.

360
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,791
Who's asking you to give up writing?
Don't stop writing.

361
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,458
You married me because you
fell in love with my writing, didn't you?

362
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,791
Of course,
I respect you as a writer even now.

363
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,916
But you can't convince
your mother that I need to write.

364
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,916
I can't live here.

365
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,708
I can't bear this prison anymore.

366
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,833
Nayan, listen.

367
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,250
Let's move out of here.

368
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,958
We'll live
and breathe free someplace else.

369
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,958
Are you out of your mind?

370
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,750
You know I can't leave my mother.
I'm her only son.

371
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,791
You're my only husband
and Anu and Robindro's only father…

372
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,000
You've forgotten that?

373
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,833
Just a minute…
Anu and Robindro are happy here.

374
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,458
And what about me?

375
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,583
My happiness is not important to you?

376
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,791
Let's go, Anu.

377
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,916
Nayan!

378
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,000
-Dad?
-Anu…

379
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,041
Nayan!

380
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:17,375
She was sitting in front of me.
I was interviewing her.

381
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,458
I don't know, all of a sudden, she…
I was shocked.

382
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,250
Meeting with the director at 6:00 p.m.,

383
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,291
meeting with
the production house at 7:00 p.m.

384
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,875
Movie screening at 9:00 p.m.

385
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,833
As you can see,
my mother is in the hospital.

386
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,291
You'll have to reschedule
all this for after three days.

387
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:36,375
-After three days. Okay.
-I'll tell you later. Thank you.

388
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,375
Hello, dear.

389
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
-Hello.
-She'll be fine very soon.

390
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,958
God bless you and your family.

391
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:44,875
Thank you.

392
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:48,875
Thank you.

393
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,166
That was crazy.

394
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,500
I don't know so many of Nayan's friends.

395
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,833
I know everyone.

396
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,833
Okay, listen, all of you leave.

397
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,541
Visiting hours are over.

398
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,625
I'll stay with Mom.

399
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,000
Nayan. I will stay with Nayan.

400
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,875
-Anu, you can go if you want.
-No, I'll stay--

401
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,208
Can I stay?

402
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,291
Why would you stay?

403
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:19,708
Yeah, if Nayan dies at midnight,
how can you miss that moment?

404
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,666
You will take her
to be cremated immediately.

405
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,125
What drivel is this?

406
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,625
I can't ever think like that.

407
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:31,416
I won't be able to make it tomorrow.
I'm going to meet Dad and Aunt Kumud.

408
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,541
They're not your dad and Aunt Kumud.

409
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,916
Okay. Your dad and Aunt Kumud.

410
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Why are you asserting
your right over them?

411
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,000
You didn't even try
meeting your father all these years.

412
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,833
If I don't assert my right, who else will?
You? You bloody fucker!

413
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,000
-Listen…
-Raghav…

414
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,583
You're crossing your limits.

415
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,000
Be in your limits!
Or else we'll ban you from coming here.

416
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,291
You have ruined our peace of mind.
Who are you to interfere in our lives?

417
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,458
I want to meet Grandpa and Kumud Grandma.

418
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,833
I've never met them.

419
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:59,166
I don't think that's a good idea--

420
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,708
Nobody fucking cares
about your opinion here.

421
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,041
Masha will go with you tomorrow.

422
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,750
And if you fuck with me after this…

423
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,875
I promise you, I will never let you
meet Nayan. I'll cut off all the wires.

424
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,916
Please forgive me.

425
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay, now… you can go.

426
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,791
Don't you both want to meet Grandpa?

427
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,000
-No.
-No.

428
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,375
Okay.

429
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,708
I'll see you tomorrow.

430
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,875
Visiting time is over.
Only two people are allowed.

431
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:39,958
Yes, we're leaving.

432
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:47,666
-Take care of yourself. Okay?
-Bye.

433
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:40,833
<i>After I left Vinayak's house,</i>
<i>it wasn't easy for us.</i>

434
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,333
<i>I still had someone who had my back.</i>

435
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:46,833
<i>Vimal.</i>

436
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,375
<i>The poor soul's no more.</i>

437
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:58,291
<i>Ours was an unconventional family</i>
<i>in a very conservative society.</i>

438
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,500
There were the two of us and our two kids.

439
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:04,208
But by "the two of us,"
I mean Vimal and I.

440
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,333
And our two kids were Anu and Robindro.

441
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,708
<i>There was peace in the house.</i>
<i>No quarrel, no arguments.</i>

442
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:23,083
<i>The sad part is that Vinayak never tried</i>
<i>to find out how the kids were doing.</i>

443
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,625
<i>So I changed</i>
<i>my kids' names at their school.</i>

444
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,833
I believed
that since I gave birth to them,

445
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:34,416
and I was raising them all by myself,

446
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,291
and their father's contribution
was nothing beyond some sperm,

447
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,125
why shouldn't they be known by my surname?

448
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:44,333
What right did the school have,
not to allow it?

449
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,291
It was my personal matter.

450
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,583
That was revolutionary
for that era, right?

451
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,708
Yes, of course.

452
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:55,166
-It was 1986.
-Yes.

453
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,208
When the school refused,
I took it to court.

454
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,625
I fought the case for ten years.

455
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,916
I faced a lot of criticism for it.

456
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:09,666
I had challenged an ancient tradition
of a patriarchal society, after all.

457
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,000
It was bound to happen.

458
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,708
<i>Class, quiet!</i>

459
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,458
<i>-Anuradha…</i>
<i>-Anuradha…</i>

460
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,791
-Nayantara…
-Nayantara…

461
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,291
-Apte.
-Apte.

462
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,250
Class, quiet!

463
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,958
Your mother and father are divorced, no?

464
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,333
-Divorce?
-Miss, what is divorce?

465
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,333
You go and ask your mother and father.

466
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,458
Class!

467
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,375
Or ask her.

468
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:55,541
Anuradha, your surname is "Apte"
and your father's "Joshi"? Why is that?

469
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,375
Don't know, Miss.

470
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,125
I can't hear you. Louder.

471
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,666
Don't know, Miss.

472
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,750
Class!

473
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:22,083
Hey… What is divorce?

474
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,500
Hey, Joshi…

475
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,250
Not Joshi… Apte.

476
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:48,625
<i>And then the peace in our home</i>
<i>was shattered, because of me.</i>

477
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:53,541
I invited a storm
called Vikramaditya into my life.

478
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,291
You must have heard of Vikramaditya,
right?

479
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,208
<i>Yes, he's a renowned photographer.</i>

480
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:06,041
<i>He clicked some really good pictures</i>
<i>of me at a writer's conference.</i>

481
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,750
<i>And then he</i>
<i>followed me around like a crazy lover.</i>

482
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,916
<i>I really liked his work.</i>

483
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,458
<i>Due to his mad obsession…</i>

484
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,458
<i>I began seeing myself</i>
<i>from a different perspective.</i>

485
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,750
I fell in love with myself.

486
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,083
I had never experienced passion
with Vinayak.

487
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:44,708
Vikram made me experience emotions
that I had never felt before.

488
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,625
Didn't the ride take forever?

489
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,208
And that taxi driver was staring so much.

490
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:53,375
What could he do but stare
at someone so beautiful?

491
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,875
Anu, I'm your friend.

492
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:30,291
Come here.
Listen, we won't tell anyone. I promise.

493
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,375
Anu, this is our big secret.

494
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:38,041
<i>Anu?</i>

495
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,375
Anu?

496
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:42,625
Anu.

497
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:44,458
Don't touch me.

498
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,250
You okay, Anu?

499
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,750
You okay? Are you all right?

500
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:58,666
Actually…

501
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,416
I overslept, you know? And…

502
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,125
It's noon already--

503
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:05,666
Hey, just relax. Sit down.

504
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,208
You needed to rest.

505
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,958
So it's okay.

506
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,791
Yeah, I know,
but… for Nayan, I have to go--

507
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:16,750
Nayan is fine. She's sleeping, I mean…
She's exactly the way she was.

508
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,916
She's fine.

509
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,875
I've spoken to Robindro.

510
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:24,875
What's wrong?

511
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,708
Is something the matter?
Did you have a nightmare or something?

512
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,208
I think I just…

513
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,875
I just can't breathe…

514
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:35,791
I just can't breathe…

515
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,083
Okay, relax.

516
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:43,000
Here you go. Take it. I got it for you.

517
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,916
You're trying to quit, right?

518
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,375
It might be the withdrawal,
anxiety or nightmares of some kind…

519
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,916
Why are you so nice?

520
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,625
I'm not that nice for you to…

521
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,666
Coffee?

522
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,083
-Yes, please.
-Super.

523
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,750
Dhiru, coffee for madam
the way she likes it.

524
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:08,791
Right away.

525
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,000
Masha, can you show it to me? One moment.

526
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:39,416
Sister-in-law took Anu and Ravi away…

527
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,041
and after that…

528
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,916
Mother passed away. I mean…

529
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,291
She went to her heavenly abode.

530
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:53,916
Anu and Robindro never
visited again after that? Not even once?

531
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,041
Anu?

532
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,833
She's Masha, brother.

533
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:03,208
Anu's daughter, she's not Anu.

534
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:05,875
It's okay.

535
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:17,000
Anu, who's that?

536
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,375
He's a writer, Grandpa.

537
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:22,958
Writer?

538
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,083
Nayan?

539
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,791
Careful…

540
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,958
Where do you want to go, brother?

541
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,458
Where do you want to go?

542
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,250
Come, be careful.

543
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:47,958
Slowly.

544
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,333
Easy. Easy.

545
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,541
Sit, sit.

546
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,458
Hey, you two haven't eaten anything?

547
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:16,666
Have some. Please offer it to him as well.

548
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,208
-No. Thank you.
-Have some.

549
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,416
No formalities.

550
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,375
Have some.

551
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:25,250
These are so good. They're very delicious.

552
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,416
I'll finish the whole lot.

553
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,958
Yes, you must.

554
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:29,666
This is nothing.

555
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,750
Mom used to make very delicious <i>laadoos.</i>

556
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,666
Your great grandmother.

557
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,250
Better than these?

558
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,625
Much, much better than these.

559
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,041
Have, no?

560
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:43,750
Please eat.

561
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,833
-They're great. Just delicious.
-Tasty, right?

562
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,666
Anu and Ravi loved Mom's <i>laadoos.</i>

563
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,625
Those were golden days.

564
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,708
But an evil eye befell us.

565
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,958
And now…

566
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,458
My brother doesn't remember anything.

567
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:13,250
It's good he doesn't remember.

568
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,625
We must leave now.
We have to go to the hospital.

569
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,291
Do you have to go?

570
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,125
Yes.

571
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,208
Come.

572
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:44,166
Thank you, Grandma Kumud.

573
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,208
I'll see you.

574
00:37:55,916 --> 00:38:00,125
Listen, Masha.
Next time, come with your husband.

575
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:02,833
Yes.

576
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,416
Her husband is
our grandson-in-law, you know?

577
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,375
Yes.

578
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,833
-It's his house too, right?
-Yes, of course.

579
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,250
You come, too.

580
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,708
-I'll see you.
-Okay.

581
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,916
Thank you.

582
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,250
-You must visit again.
-Yes, I will for sure.

583
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,333
Come back soon.

584
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,125
It's so good.

585
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:51,250
Wow!

586
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,375
This is a fucking one-hour orgasm.

587
00:38:58,791 --> 00:38:59,916
Dad thought…

588
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:03,500
Your dad thought Masha was you.

589
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,791
He was continuously addressing her as Anu.

590
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:10,833
Yes, he actually
kept referring to me as you.

591
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,416
And your Aunt Kumud
kept referring to you as "Ravi."

592
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:22,916
Anyways, it's time for my prayers.
I'll leave now.

593
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,000
You were here all night.

594
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,375
-Thank you.
-Bye.

595
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,958
-Bye.
-See you.

596
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:32,791
<i>Hare Krishna.</i>

597
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:36,666
Mr. Robindro, when can you
spare time for the biography?

598
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,708
Autobiography. Nayan will
write it herself when she gets better.

599
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,625
Yes, autobiography.

600
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,958
When can we meet?

601
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,750
We have already met.

602
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,625
No, I mean, when are you free?

603
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:50,916
Ms. Nayan wanted you
to give your inputs in her autobiography.

604
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,041
What do you want to know?

605
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,166
Have a seat.

606
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,208
That's okay.

607
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,500
Let's start from the beginning.

608
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,375
The Lord's universe
doesn't have a beginning or an end.

609
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,291
-That's true.
-Yeah.

610
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,500
Let's start with
a memorable childhood moment?

611
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,250
When you were younger…

612
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,958
All moments are memorable.

613
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,958
The good and the bad.

614
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,375
Everything is precious.

615
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,333
Because everything is written by Him.

616
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:21,916
That's true.

617
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,750
But isn't this escapism?

618
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,791
If everything is already decided,
why should we do anything?

619
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,250
So…

620
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,333
Our purpose is to keep doing
what we have to.

621
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,083
The life we're living, is it easy?

622
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:39,500
Yes? No?

623
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,625
-No.
-No.

624
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,791
But we're still living our lives.
We aren't running away, are we?

625
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,250
Then how is it escapism?

626
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:51,833
It's an acceptance
that everything's been written by Him.

627
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,958
Our present is written by Him.

628
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:02,000
What happened in the past
was meant to happen

629
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:05,708
and what will happen in the future,
it's bound to happen.

630
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,791
So to sum it up…

631
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,416
Our body is just a medium
to help our souls reach Him.

632
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,458
Our life is just a pilgrimage.

633
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,333
<i>Hare Krishna.</i>

634
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,416
-Anything else?
-No.

635
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,125
-You sure?
-Yes.

636
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,041
Bye.

637
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,291
Anu, I have to leave too.

638
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,666
If you should need me, call me.

639
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,458
I'll come here right away. Take care.

640
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:37,375
-See you, bye.
-Bye.

641
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,333
Bye.

642
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,291
I should leave too.

643
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,125
My mother-in-law called me
a thousand times, but I didn't answer.

644
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,666
Do I have to stay alone with this asshole?

645
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,208
-He's very creepy.
-He's okay, you know?

646
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,041
He asked me a lot of questions.

647
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:53,833
At Dad's house?

648
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,333
No, on our way here. In the car.

649
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,333
-Masha, you're just…
-For Grandma.

650
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,583
I couldn't say no.

651
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:01,666
-Bye.
-Bye.

652
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,583
Bye, Milan.

653
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,083
Bye.

654
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:23,500
Ms. Nayan really wanted you and Robindro
to be interviewed for the autobiography.

655
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,583
Your point of view meant a lot
to Ms. Nayan.

656
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:27,791
-You should--
-Shut up!

657
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,375
Why do you get so irritated with me?

658
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,041
Fuck, do you want me to worship you?

659
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:37,000
Why do you use such abusive language
with me?

660
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,083
Can't you simply call them "cuss words"?

661
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,333
"Abusive language." Fucking drama king!

662
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,208
You just did it again.

663
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:45,208
Where?

664
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,291
The "F" word…

665
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,208
"Fuck"?

666
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:51,916
Fuck isn't a cuss word.
I use it for good things too.

667
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,541
Imagine you're in front of the Taj Mahal.

668
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:00,541
You're a writer, go ahead.
Close your eyes and imagine.

669
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,416
That you're in front of the Taj Mahal.

670
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,458
And just say, "Love."

671
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:10,583
Love.

672
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:11,833
Hear that?

673
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:14,333
Sounds like an overripe banana.

674
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:19,250
Now close your eyes and say, "Fuck."

675
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:21,958
Go ahead.

676
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,375
Fuck.

677
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,583
See? Wasn't that fun?

678
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:30,583
In life too,
fuck is much better than love.

679
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:38,166
And you've
neither experienced love nor fuck.

680
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:39,791
I have…

681
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,666
So Mr. Wireless Upadhyay,

682
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,208
unless I call you "fucker,"
don't assume that it's a cuss word.

683
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,583
Fucker!

684
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,500
<i>My decisions had the biggest impact</i>
<i>on Anu and Robindro.</i>

685
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,958
<i>Us elders take decisions for our children.</i>
<i>Where do they have a choice?</i>

686
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,000
<i>Yes.</i>

687
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,291
<i>So in my autobiography,</i>

688
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:20,250
<i>I want to give them</i>
<i>an opportunity to blame me all they want.</i>

689
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,833
<i>Our memory is very selective, isn't it?</i>

690
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,625
Your side of the story
is very important to Ms. Nayan.

691
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:38,375
So, Ms. Anu, your story in your own words.

692
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,750
Will you talk about it?

693
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,166
No.

694
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:54,666
Why? What are you so scared about?

695
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,708
Scared?

696
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,750
You should be scared, and she too.

697
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,333
Because if I start talking,

698
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:06,000
your literary goddess here
will be left humiliated.

699
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,916
I promise you, it will not be pretty.

700
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,708
Why do you hate her so much?

701
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,708
She's done so much
to give you a good life.

702
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:18,000
She doesn't deserve so much hate, Ms. Anu.

703
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:21,583
You fucker, what the fuck
do you know about my life?

704
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:23,791
Have you ever been in my shoes?

705
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:27,416
Did your mother get married
to an asshole when you were 14 years old?

706
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,916
That fucking asshole didn't lose a single
opportunity to sexually harass me.

707
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,416
And the great Nayantara Apte
let it happen.

708
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:40,291
I was not safe in my own house
only because of her.

709
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,583
Did your mother
do anything like that to you?

710
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:47,541
And if she had,
would you have worshipped her?

711
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:51,000
Ms. Nayan didn't know
that you were getting harassed.

712
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,041
She hasn't been able
to forgive herself for this.

713
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,250
Listen to what
she had to say for yourself.

714
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,750
Unbelievable!

715
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,333
Was she in a coma then too?

716
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,041
It was happening right under her nose.

717
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,875
How could she not fucking see?

718
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,041
<i>That animal…</i>

719
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:13,125
<i>kept harassing… my daughter</i>
<i>right under my nose.</i>

720
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,291
<i>He kept troubling her.</i>

721
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,583
<i>And I didn't have a clue.</i>

722
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,208
<i>I really trusted Vikram…</i>

723
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,833
and I couldn't ever imagine that…

724
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,458
he would sexually molest Anu.

725
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,000
<i>I feel disgusted with myself.</i>

726
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,708
<i>How could I be so blind?</i>

727
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:58,000
<i>Why didn't I see Vikram's true colors?</i>

728
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,833
<i>Anu?</i>

729
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,333
<i>Mom!</i>

730
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:12,291
<i>Why are you scared? It's our little game.</i>

731
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,125
Nobody is home.

732
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,791
Yeah. We're good friends.
We're going to be really good friends.

733
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,583
Don't worry, it's going to be our secret.

734
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,125
What's going on over here?

735
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,958
You should ask her.

736
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,666
Who's my special friend now?

737
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:29,916
Hey.

738
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,041
What's going on with her?

739
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,083
Nothing at all.

740
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,875
She requires some time.

741
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,416
I'm worried about her.

742
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,375
Don't worry, there's nothing
to worry about. I'll manage.

743
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,083
You know me, I'm irresistible.

744
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:49,125
<i>Dad, we want to live with you…</i>

745
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,458
<i>We don't want to live here anymore.</i>

746
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,208
Nayan won't like it.

747
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,833
Besides, who will look after you?
Now that your grandma is gone.

748
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,791
Aunt Vimal will stay with us.

749
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:03,333
We are coming there.

750
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:06,500
Listen, you can come
here for a few days, but…

751
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,166
But we want to come forever.

752
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,750
That is not possible.

753
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,833
<i>Dad doesn't love us.</i>

754
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,958
<i>We are never going to talk to him again.</i>

755
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,708
<i>-Promise?</i>
<i>-Promise.</i>

756
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,458
<i>You shouldn't say things like this.</i>

757
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:21,333
<i>No, Aunt Vimal,</i>
<i>I don't want to live here.</i>

758
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:22,958
<i>Aren't you a good girl?</i>

759
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:24,708
<i>Please, I can't stay here.</i>

760
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,416
<i>Please, I don't want to stay here.</i>

761
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:33,833
Anu!

762
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:36,666
-Anu! Hold her hand.
-Okay.

763
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,125
Anu…

764
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,000
Anu?

765
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:53,750
Come out, my child.

766
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,000
I want to talk to you.

767
00:48:56,916 --> 00:49:00,750
Come out, please! Anu…

768
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:03,750
I'm an artist.
I won't take random jobs for money.

769
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,833
-One moment.
-What is it?

770
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,208
Why did you have to buy lenses?

771
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,583
How will I find good work
if I don't upgrade?

772
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:11,625
Anu, where are you going?

773
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,250
Robindro.

774
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:23,125
Rob…

775
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:31,333
Anu?

776
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:33,833
Why didn't you knock?

777
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:35,833
I did.

778
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,000
You didn't hear.

779
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,208
You were writing?

780
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:41,166
Yes, my autobiography.

781
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:44,708
Now I will write the truth. About you.

782
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,541
<i>After many years,</i>

783
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:54,541
Anu openly spoke about her dark phase
in an interview for a magazine.

784
00:49:57,416 --> 00:50:01,541
She… named Vikram there.

785
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,541
But it was too late then.

786
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,541
I couldn't do anything about it.

787
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,791
Vikram and I were divorced by then.

788
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:18,333
But then I understood…

789
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,666
why Anu hates me so much.

790
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:03,750
<i>Some years passed</i>
<i>and my second novel was published.</i>

791
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:10,000
Kaai,<i> that was</i>
<i>your first novel in Hindi, right?</i>

792
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:13,583
<i>Yes. And I also worked on</i>
<i>its English translation.</i>

793
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:14,750
<i>It was called </i>The Moss.

794
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:15,791
{\an8}KAAI

795
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:19,125
{\an8}The Moss. <i>And</i> Kaai
<i>was awarded the State Literary Award too.</i>

796
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,250
<i>Yes.</i>

797
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:24,083
{\an8}<i>That same year,</i>
<i>Anu started working in films.</i>

798
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,083
{\an8}DIL KII DHADKAN

799
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,583
{\an8}And in the midst of all this,

800
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:30,708
Anu fell in love
with a Russian boy called Dmitri.

801
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,083
I rented a flat for them.

802
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,250
<i>But it was hard to find them</i>
<i>a rented apartment at that time.</i>

803
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,291
<i>Because they weren't married,</i>

804
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:48,000
people couldn't comprehend
the concept of a live-in relationship.

805
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,250
It was impossible for them.

806
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,458
Anu never spoke to me much.

807
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:58,416
Most of our communication
was through Vimal.

808
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:01,333
But Dmitri and I shared
a good relationship.

809
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:04,041
I've never met my father.

810
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:10,291
He and Mom met at some film festival

811
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:14,125
where Mom's film was shown…
in the House of Soviet Culture.

812
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:19,166
They liked each other
and started living together.

813
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,583
Mom got pregnant and I'm the result.

814
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:26,125
Mr. Dmitri used
to drink and beat up Ms. Anu.

815
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,583
Ms. Nayan told me about it.

816
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,708
Yes. I've heard that…

817
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:37,458
But Mom is a tigress when it comes to me.

818
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:40,625
She will go to any extent to protect me.

819
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:42,083
Bloody bitch!

820
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,333
Anu, stop!

821
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,333
What are you doing!
She's pregnant! Have you gone mad?

822
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:56,625
You hit my baby!

823
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,166
This man is crazy! Anu…

824
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:01,791
How dare you touch me?

825
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,833
No, it's enough, you fucking asshole!

826
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:10,875
And if I ever see you next to me
or my baby again, I'll fucking kill you!

827
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,125
-Anu--
-Asshole!

828
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:28,750
What happened?

829
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,291
What's all this?

830
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,666
Dandekar, who lives downstairs,
had called.

831
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:39,750
He said Anu created a ruckus again today.

832
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,583
I was busy in an event,
and he kept calling me.

833
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,291
And then Dmitri arrived
with a bleeding forehead.

834
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:48,250
What exactly happened here?

835
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,458
This… this is what happened. Look at this.

836
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:52,625
This is what
your precious Dmitri did to me.

837
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,583
Your daughter, you bloody bitch!

838
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:55,583
Anu.

839
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,166
What do you mean by, "Anu"?

840
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,625
I'm eight months pregnant,

841
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,625
Dmitri hit me
and you're concerned about him?

842
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,083
No, I'm concerned about--

843
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,250
No, you're not!

844
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,208
You're not concerned about me, okay?

845
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:08,000
Did you ask even once, "How is Anu?"

846
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,666
You asked? Dmitri! Dandekar!

847
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,166
I could hear everything.
You never asked about me.

848
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,166
No, that's not true, child…

849
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:19,625
You don't care about me,
you don't care about anyone.

850
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:22,583
And I hate you. You're a sick woman!

851
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:23,625
She is your mother.

852
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:27,500
She's not! Is this how a mother
is supposed to be? Like her?

853
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:29,750
You ruined my life,

854
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,083
you ruined Robindro's life,
you ruined Dad's life!

855
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,041
I hate you. Me and my baby are fine.

856
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,250
We don't need you, okay?

857
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:39,541
We don't need you.
Get lost! Get out of here!

858
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't need you!

859
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,625
Anu, please calm down… Control your anger.

860
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:48,833
Stress is bad for the baby.

861
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:53,250
Please calm down…

862
00:54:54,666 --> 00:55:00,166
<i>That's it. After she threw me out</i>
<i>of the house, she stopped talking to me.</i>

863
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,500
I became Nayan instead of Mom.

864
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:08,916
Both my kids disowned me as a mother.

865
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:13,833
Both of them still call me
"Nayan" and not "Mom."

866
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,375
Even Mr. Robindro? Why?

867
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,416
Robindro loves Anu unconditionally.

868
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:26,333
Whatever Anu tells Robindro,
he always agrees with her.

869
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:29,458
My kids love each other so much,

870
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,041
but there's such a huge chasm
between them and me.

871
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,208
Sometimes, I think,
I wish they were characters I'd written.

872
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:43,875
I would have molded them
in any way I wished.

873
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,625
Then they would love me.

874
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,333
<i>I wish I could wipe away</i>

875
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,750
<i>the bitterness</i>
<i>of my personal relationships.</i>

876
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:58,875
<i>Are you okay?</i>

877
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,625
Yes, I'm all right.

878
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,583
And Nayan is all right too.

879
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,416
<i>Thank God. I was worried, you know?</i>

880
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:09,333
You just take care of Grandpa.

881
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,458
<i>He's fine.</i>

882
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:11,666
Excuse me, madam.

883
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,541
Can you help me a bit?

884
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,583
-The other nurse hasn't come in today.
<i>-Mom?</i>

885
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:16,500
Sorry.

886
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:17,708
<i>Hello, Mom?</i>

887
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,250
I'll call you back, okay?

888
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,291
<i>Yes, okay. Sure.</i>

889
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,375
Come…

890
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:24,916
Please come.

891
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:36,958
Just hold on over here.

892
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,333
Here.

893
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:48,083
You just have to hold here.
Her back needs sponging.

894
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:49,666
Just hold on like that.

895
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:51,875
Very good.

896
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:56,958
Poor coma patients,
they can't do anything by themselves.

897
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,625
So I give them a really good sponging.

898
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:06,583
They can develop bed sores
if sponging is not done right.

899
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:11,333
But none of my patients
have had any bed sores until now.

900
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:14,916
It's done.

901
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,583
Very good. You can let go now, no problem.

902
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,416
Very good.

903
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,000
Thank you, madam.

904
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:52,708
Mom.

905
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,333
What are you staring at?

906
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:25,666
No, I was just looking…

907
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,791
There's nobody else here.

908
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:32,833
Nayan is here. You can look at her.

909
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,250
Ms. Nayan and I used to talk so much.

910
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,166
Did you say something?

911
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,375
No. I was saying how I used
to talk to Ms. Nayan so much.

912
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:11,833
Time used to just fly.

913
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,208
Sometimes we'd talk the whole day.

914
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,208
It had become a habit.

915
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:24,375
Now I don't know
what to do with all this time.

916
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,916
How did you meet Nayan?

917
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,708
I've done my PhD
in Indian Feminist Literature,

918
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:35,208
specializing in female writers.

919
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:36,916
Fuck! You're a doctor?

920
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,875
Doctor of Philosophy. PhD.

921
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:42,750
I didn't know what PhD stood for.

922
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,833
This autobiography keeps me busy.

923
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:50,416
And that's also
why I'm associated with her.

924
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,375
But why are you recording it?

925
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,916
Why isn't Nayan writing it herself?

926
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,791
Don't you know
that Ms. Nayan cannot write?

927
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,666
What do you mean?

928
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,625
She has arthritis.

929
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,416
Her fingers hurt, for many years now.

930
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:07,083
She can write with great difficulty now.

931
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:12,291
Fuck! She actually can't write?

932
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:14,833
No. You didn't…

933
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:18,291
My God. Must be devastating for her.

934
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:22,875
I would die if I weren't able to dance.

935
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:27,083
No, don't say that.
That's why I record everything.

936
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,166
I don't want to miss out
on a single thing that she says.

937
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:39,666
Ms. Anu, without you and Robindro,

938
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,083
this autobiography would be incomplete.

939
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,916
No, it will not be written
without both of you.

940
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,041
I will talk…

941
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:55,416
to Nayan, when she recovers. Not to you.

942
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,375
At least you'll talk to her if not to me.

943
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:01,541
Much obliged.

944
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:06,000
What, "Much obliged"?
Can't you just say, "Thank you"?

945
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:09,625
No, I mean… Thank you.

946
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:17,250
Or I might just reveal everything
in my controversial autobiography.

947
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:25,916
Come, asshole. I'll buy you some coffee.

948
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:32,291
Please have a seat. I'll get it.

949
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:33,291
Are you sure?

950
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:34,375
Yes.

951
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,125
-I'll be over there.
-Okay.

952
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,000
One tea and a coffee.

953
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:46,708
Thank you.

954
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,375
It's so noisy.

955
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,916
Doesn't seem like a hospital canteen.

956
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,250
And you're so calm amidst this chaos?

957
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:02,083
It's all right here. Block it. That's it.

958
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:04,958
That was deep.

959
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,916
Do you often go out like this?

960
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,708
I mean, do you go out alone?

961
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:30,916
Ms. Anu, Ms. Nayan said
that you had stopped talking to her.

962
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,416
Then how did you resume talking?

963
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,750
Because of Raina.

964
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:39,000
In my… and even Robindro's life.

965
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:41,791
He brought us some stability.

966
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:50,250
<i>I met Raina the day Masha was born.</i>

967
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:58,500
Hello.

968
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,291
I'm Raina.

969
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,625
Bhaskar Raina. Who doesn't know you?

970
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:08,833
May I?

971
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:14,000
Are your hands clean?

972
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:18,083
Look. No paint stains on my hands.
They're clean. Just like my heart.

973
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,958
Come to me, baby.

974
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,416
How sweet.

975
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,083
She's adorable.

976
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,750
It's time to feed Masha.

977
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:47,333
Masha?

978
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,541
<i>Masha Allah!</i>

979
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,083
That's a beautiful name.

980
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,125
Hold her.

981
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:09,375
When you get discharged from the hospital,
you have to come home with Masha.

982
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:25,708
Vimal.

983
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:44,041
<i>Raina was like</i>
<i>a father figure to me and Robindro.</i>

984
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:46,916
<i>If we'd met Raina in our childhood,</i>

985
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
<i>then we'd have a better</i>
<i>and easier childhood.</i>

986
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:53,500
<i>I was glad that Masha</i>
<i>spent her childhood with him.</i>

987
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,750
Yeah…

988
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,750
My baby girl.

989
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:00,541
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

990
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:05,208
<i>We started staying together after ages,</i>
<i>at Raina's house.</i>

991
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:08,500
-Not like this. Like this.
-I'm sorry.

992
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:09,541
Raina…

993
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,750
<i>Robindro and I loved Raina.</i>

994
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,166
<i>He was lovable.</i>

995
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,750
-I loved it.
-This is my son.

996
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:17,416
Raina introduced us
to a completely different world.

997
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:21,333
He used to take us to music recitals,

998
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,416
art exhibitions, and dance recitals.

999
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:28,583
Then one day he took us to watch
Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra's Odissi dance.

1000
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:32,333
He danced so well that…

1001
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:35,333
You know, our minds were completely blown.

1002
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:39,041
That one performance changed our lives.

1003
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:42,000
Robindro found his Lord Krishna,

1004
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,083
and I became a lover of Krishna,
like Radha.

1005
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:51,333
Actually more than anything else,
I fell in love with the dance. Odissi.

1006
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:02,500
Ladies, smile.

1007
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,208
MRA PRESENTS
RISING TALENTS

1008
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,791
Yeah, I really owe Raina a lot.

1009
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:23,958
If he hadn't come into my life,
none of this would have happened.

1010
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:29,375
If Mr. Raina
hadn't come into Ms. Nayan's life, then…

1011
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,125
That's true.

1012
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,541
But their relationship didn't last long.

1013
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:43,000
They had an "open relationship."
Whatever the fuck that means.

1014
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,875
I felt like Mom wanted to marry Raina.

1015
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:53,500
But Raina wasn't interested in marriage.

1016
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:57,291
He had a lot of other muses in his life.

1017
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:01,041
However open their relationship was,

1018
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,666
Nayan didn't like that.

1019
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,708
She had truly met her match.

1020
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:11,208
Mom became Dad.
And Karma is a fucking bitch.

1021
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:16,333
What did Ms. Nayan think
of your Odissi dance?

1022
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:19,541
What did Nayan think? I don't know…

1023
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,458
I can say Nayan does think.

1024
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,416
But not about others.

1025
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,708
She is…

1026
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:30,875
She definitely thinks
about her characters.

1027
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,416
She's very cerebral, you know?

1028
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:36,583
How do I explain it? She is…

1029
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:39,333
<i>Abhanga.</i>

1030
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:44,416
Slightly weird.
She's a genius, so she has to be weird.

1031
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:48,791
And my Masha is… <i>Samabhanga.</i>

1032
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:50,666
Completely balanced.

1033
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,375
And I'm…

1034
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,625
weird, skewed…

1035
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:57,375
crazy, but sexy…

1036
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,541
<i>Tribhanga.</i>

1037
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:06,875
Ms. Anu, didn't you
ever feel like getting married?

1038
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,875
Marriage is nonsense. Don't get married.

1039
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,333
I call it societal terrorism.

1040
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:14,958
You know, monogamy is injurious to health.

1041
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:17,916
Mom was fiercely protective of me.

1042
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,541
Actually, you'll be surprised…

1043
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:23,291
She never permitted
her boyfriends to stay over at our house.

1044
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:24,416
Never.

1045
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:29,125
She always said
that we didn't need any man in our house.

1046
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,750
I've had many men in my life.

1047
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,416
The whole world knows about it.

1048
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,875
And I'm not a man hater.

1049
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:38,333
But staying with one man
for my entire life

1050
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:40,333
seems like stupidity to me.

1051
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,750
I mean, you know, like tissues.

1052
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,625
You don't fucking wipe
your nose and keep the tissue

1053
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:51,291
regardless of however
satisfying the experience was. Right?

1054
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:56,250
You're Ms. Nayan's granddaughter
and Ms. Anu's daughter.

1055
01:08:56,333 --> 01:09:00,125
Yet you've married into
a very conservative joint family.

1056
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:04,708
What were Ms. Anu and Ms. Nayan's
thoughts about your marriage?

1057
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:07,583
Mom has always been supportive of me.

1058
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:10,500
She's happy with whatever makes me happy.

1059
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:13,458
In fact, Mom likes my family.

1060
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:15,125
Grandma, not so much.

1061
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,625
My family is very typical, you know?

1062
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:20,875
Women cover their heads in my family.

1063
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,000
Hi.

1064
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,750
Come on. Come.

1065
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:38,291
Go inside.

1066
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:47,166
Masha and Deepak love each other.

1067
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,875
They want to get married.

1068
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:55,875
I know you have a lot of questions
regarding Masha's father.

1069
01:09:58,375 --> 01:09:59,791
Masha's father was a Russian.

1070
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:03,291
Her father was a Russian.
Not from around here.

1071
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:08,500
We were divorced even before she was born.

1072
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:12,791
Masha has never met her father.

1073
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:19,208
And my daughter
is very adorable, smart, kind-hearted…

1074
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:22,000
She's a wonderful daughter.

1075
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:26,333
Please, don't go by
what all you read about me, because…

1076
01:10:26,916 --> 01:10:29,875
They always write absurd things
about me in the press.

1077
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:38,916
And if you want dowry, then…

1078
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,333
I'm gonna have
to find myself a rich boyfriend

1079
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:44,625
because I'm a little short
on funds right now.

1080
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,958
All we want is your daughter.

1081
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:10,875
Nothing more.

1082
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,583
God bless you.

1083
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:29,250
<i>And we lived happily ever after.</i>

1084
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:31,666
<i>Grandfather-in-law, father-in-law,</i>
<i>mother-in-law,</i>

1085
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,666
<i>Deepak's uncles, brothers,</i>
<i>elder sister-in-law,</i>

1086
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:37,916
younger sister-in-law,
Deepak, his cousins and their children.

1087
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,541
And Baby Mehta will be with us soon.

1088
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:44,458
<i>Masha has chosen her family,</i>

1089
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:48,041
and I respect her freedom of choice.

1090
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:53,291
But staying away
from her family is my choice.

1091
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:57,250
I'm happy with my audacious life.

1092
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:01,250
I breathe freely, without any oppression.

1093
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:03,625
Cheers.

1094
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,541
It's so strange
that Ms. Nayan was an atheist.

1095
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,000
I mean, she <i>is…</i>

1096
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,250
And both of you are believers?

1097
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,375
I believe in the concept of…

1098
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:16,708
God is omnipresent.

1099
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,625
I'm not sure of atheism or believers…

1100
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,708
but I love my Krishna.

1101
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:23,958
I'm a Baha'i.

1102
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:25,625
What is that?

1103
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:28,791
Baha'is respect
all the religions in the world.

1104
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,750
They believe that humanity
is the biggest religion in the world.

1105
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,333
What are you doing?

1106
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:41,958
It's a video call.

1107
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:44,166
Mother-in-law calls me
from Deepak's phone sometimes.

1108
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:47,083
<i>Jai Shree Krishna,</i> Mother-in-law.

1109
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:49,166
<i>Dear, Grandpa was asking for you.</i>

1110
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,000
Okay, Mother-in-law. I'm leaving in a bit.

1111
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,875
<i>Dear, you should not go out in your state.</i>

1112
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,958
Mother-in-law, I'm in the hospital.

1113
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:58,916
If anything happens,
it's the safest place.

1114
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,041
<i>But the family cares</i>
<i>about their grandson, right?</i>

1115
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,416
Hello, Ms. Vandana.

1116
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,208
<i>Hello, </i>Jai Shree Krishna.

1117
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:08,708
How is Grandpa?

1118
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:11,083
<i>He's fine. Please come visit sometime.</i>

1119
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:14,583
Yes, of course. Once Mom gets better…

1120
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:17,458
Jai Shree Krishna.

1121
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:22,875
This is Milan. He's helping us out
with Mom's autobiography.

1122
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:25,791
-Hello.
<i>-Hello.</i>

1123
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:30,083
Please don't worry about Masha.

1124
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:32,000
I'll make sure she reaches home safely.

1125
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,250
Okay.

1126
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,166
Give my regards to Grandpa.

1127
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,791
<i>-Okay. </i>Jai Shree Krishna.
<i>-Jai Shree Krishna.</i>

1128
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:44,416
They don't like me
coming here everyday to see Grandma.

1129
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,208
For fuck's sake, why? She's your grandma.

1130
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:51,416
They think that seeing a patient
during pregnancy is depressing.

1131
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,916
That it will affect the baby negatively.

1132
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,333
And they've decided
the gender of the baby already, right?

1133
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:59,708
Ms. Vandana kept saying, "My grandson."

1134
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:09,000
Did you do the gender determination test?

1135
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,166
Did you?

1136
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,083
I didn't have a choice, Mom.

1137
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,416
My sisters-in-law have daughters. So…

1138
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,375
They didn't want to take a risk.

1139
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,041
"Risk"?

1140
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,208
A daughter's birth is a risk?

1141
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,333
Her, mine, and your birth was a risk?

1142
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,375
This is fucking unbelievable, Masha.
How did you let this happen?

1143
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:49,458
-Did Deepak pressurize you to do this too?
-No, there was no pressure.

1144
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:51,958
And Deepak
doesn't have a say in front of them.

1145
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:55,625
Sometimes, in families,
you don't have a choice.

1146
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:58,291
What you do
with your body is not your choice?

1147
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,833
And if it was a girl,
would you have aborted her?

1148
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:02,875
No!

1149
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:05,041
They would've asked you to
and you would have.

1150
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:07,750
Because sometimes in families
like this you don't have a choice.

1151
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:11,041
No, that wouldn't have happened.
We'd decided that if it was a baby girl,

1152
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:13,416
we'd convince them after the test.

1153
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,208
But we didn't have to do that,
because it's a baby boy.

1154
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:18,500
We were lucky.

1155
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,416
"Lucky"?

1156
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:24,208
This is fucking nonsense.

1157
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:28,291
What has happened to you, Masha?
Are you a puppet?

1158
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:29,791
What kind of a family is this?

1159
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,375
Abort if it's a baby girl?

1160
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:32,291
It's illegal.

1161
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,750
It's not like that, Mom.

1162
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:37,250
-They're very kind and loving people.
-Really?

1163
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:41,500
Mom, I'm happy that my baby
will get a stable and normal family.

1164
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,833
Meaning?

1165
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,916
I mean, at least
my child will have a father.

1166
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,625
I had a father.
Did it make any difference?

1167
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:52,000
Of course, it did.

1168
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,500
At least you had a father.

1169
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,833
You weren't an illegitimate child.

1170
01:15:58,416 --> 01:15:59,958
You weren't illegitimate either.

1171
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,375
I knew that, Mom.

1172
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,208
But the whole world thought otherwise.

1173
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:10,458
Daughter of an unmarried mother
who'd never seen her father.

1174
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:12,541
Everyone used to call me illegitimate.

1175
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:15,875
Who called you that?

1176
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:19,041
And had you told me,
I'd have done something about it.

1177
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:22,083
It was happening right in front of you.

1178
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,958
I can't believe
you never even realized it.

1179
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,416
Anyway, I don't want to talk about it.

1180
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:34,833
What do you think…

1181
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:37,666
that I wouldn't have
killed them all if you'd told me?

1182
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,083
How many people would you have killed?

1183
01:16:45,416 --> 01:16:46,875
Everyone used to laugh at me.

1184
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:50,250
They looked at me with scorn.

1185
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:55,916
Didn't you ever realize
I hated going to school?

1186
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,500
I hated PTM the most.

1187
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:04,250
Because you would come there
with your latest boyfriend every time.

1188
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:10,166
One day, my class teacher
asked me in front of everyone,

1189
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,083
"How much does your mother charge?"

1190
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:19,708
I wanted to kill myself.

1191
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:23,791
I don't want my children
to face the same thing I did.

1192
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:31,083
You never told me any of this, not once…

1193
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:33,166
You never complained.

1194
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,500
Would I have got
a normal family if I had complained?

1195
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:42,958
I didn't have a choice.

1196
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,166
Fuck!

1197
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:56,875
I'm sorry, Mom.

1198
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,208
I didn't mean it that way.

1199
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:03,250
I know it came out all wrong. I'm sorry.

1200
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,291
No, baby.

1201
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,291
<i>I'm </i>sorry. Okay?

1202
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,666
I'm sorry for fucking up your life.

1203
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,750
No, Mom, please.

1204
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:16,250
Let me say it before it's too late.
I'm sorry.

1205
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:35,166
I just want to say
that whether it's your grandma or I…

1206
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:40,625
We have made some
fucked up choices, I know.

1207
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,958
But they were all our choices.

1208
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:51,208
Nobody imposed their choices on us.

1209
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,708
But I'm neither you nor grandma.

1210
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:58,125
I know.
That's why I worry about you a lot.

1211
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:02,750
You won't understand,

1212
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:08,375
but I have seen hundreds
of so-called normal families like yours.

1213
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:10,750
They will put you on a pedestal,

1214
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:16,416
and keep imposing their appalling,
regressive mentality on you.

1215
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:21,708
I know
these grandfather-grandfarter types.

1216
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:25,916
-"Grandfarter"?
-Yeah. Really.

1217
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,625
And despite all these tests,
if you have a baby girl, that'd be fun.

1218
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:35,166
He and Vandana
will be checking her, saying,

1219
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,208
"There should've been
something in between the legs."

1220
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,875
"Right, Grandpa?" Oops!

1221
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,291
What happened to you?

1222
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,625
I was confused whether to stay or leave.

1223
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,958
We're fine.

1224
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:59,250
Can I take a picture of you both
with Ms. Nayan, if you don't mind?

1225
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:01,958
Three generations.

1226
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:04,750
Four. Did you forget Baby Mehta?

1227
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:08,041
He's talking about
three generations of <i>women.</i>

1228
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,166
I'm done with this, okay?

1229
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,916
I want her to come out
of this fucking coma soon, now.

1230
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:19,625
Did you hear that?

1231
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,416
You've rested enough.

1232
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:24,833
I have a lot to talk to you about.

1233
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:30,791
What did I just hear? Am I dreaming?

1234
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:33,083
Drama queen!

1235
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,333
Let's see happy faces.

1236
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:37,541
Can't you just say, "Smile"?

1237
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:38,500
Okay.

1238
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,416
Smile.

1239
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:47,000
Anu, look who's here.

1240
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,416
You've grown.

1241
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:29,833
Nayan likes jasmine.

1242
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:45,041
-And… how are you?
-Grandpa!

1243
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:49,958
This is Milan. He's helping out
with Mom's autobiography.

1244
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:50,625
DEAR ANU AND

1245
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:00,916
<i>My dearest Anu and Robindro,</i>

1246
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:05,625
<i>for the first time in my life,</i>
<i>I'm out of words.</i>

1247
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:10,791
<i>Where do I start? What do I say?</i>

1248
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:14,833
<i>I wish I could live my life again.</i>

1249
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:18,333
<i>I would set everything right.</i>

1250
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,750
<i>But that's not possible now.</i>

1251
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,291
<i>I can just apologize…</i>

1252
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:30,166
<i>and hope that you forgive me.</i>

1253
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,541
<i>I took all the decisions</i>
<i>for you in your childhood.</i>

1254
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,458
<i>But I want you to decide…</i>

1255
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:52,333
<i>what to do with my body and legacy.</i>

1256
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:56,666
<i>This is your decision. Both of yours.</i>

1257
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:02,708
<i>I always wanted you to have a happy life.</i>

1258
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:06,666
<i>I wanted you</i>
<i>to be surrounded by people</i>

1259
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,250
<i>who'd give you</i>
<i>all</i> <i>the love that I couldn't give you.</i>

1260
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,041
<i>How do I make you believe…</i>

1261
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:19,791
<i>that I love you the most.</i>

1262
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:26,291
<i>Will you believe me? Believe me please!</i>

1263
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:30,708
<i>Your Mom.</i>

1264
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,208
Mr. Milan is here.

1265
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,500
I'll just be back in two minutes.

1266
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,500
Mr. Upadhyay! Long time!

1267
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:03,333
Where were you all these days?

1268
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:05,500
Wish you a happy birthday.

1269
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:06,583
You remembered?

1270
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:09,333
I haven't forgotten anything.

1271
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:14,833
Come, join us.

1272
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:16,916
No, I'm fine here.

1273
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,291
I've brought something for you.

1274
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:26,416
A book?

1275
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,458
Don't you know that I don't read books?

1276
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,250
You'll read this for sure.

1277
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:39,291
TRIBHANGA

1278
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:46,416
I brought the first copy for you.

1279
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,333
I was caught up with this.

1280
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,291
Thank you.

1281
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,375
That was very thoughtful of you.

1282
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:08,375
You will read it, right?

1283
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,583
Yes, I will have to.

1284
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:19,708
I miss you.

1285
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:23,750
I mean, I miss our long conversations.

1286
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:26,958
I'd gotten used to that.

1287
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,333
I miss Ms. Nayan the most.

1288
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:36,333
Every time I try to forget her,
I miss her even more.

1289
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:38,875
Me too.

1290
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,500
I don't have anyone
to blame or complain about now.

1291
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,458
Fuck!

1292
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:51,375
Asshole learned to say "Fuck"?

1293
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:55,833
Heard this word after such a long time.

1294
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:56,916
It feels great.

1295
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:06,500
This has all the recordings
of Ms. Nayan and the rest of you.

1296
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,541
Everything is in this.

1297
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:16,541
Happy birthday once again.

1298
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,416
Read the autobiography
and give your honest critique.

1299
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,708
I will give you my honest critique.

1300
01:28:23,791 --> 01:28:25,833
But you know what that means, right?

1301
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:29,500
If I don't like it, you'll be showered
with "abusive language."

1302
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:32,958
You can simply say "cuss words."

1303
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:34,708
Fucker!

1304
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:37,458
You will like it.

1305
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:39,708
I'll take your leave.

1306
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:48,333
If you need help in writing
your autobiography, do remember me.

1307
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:50,791
I'll remember you just like that.

1308
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:54,416
And I'm not writing my autobiography.

1309
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,583
Never was.

1310
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,333
This one's more than enough.
