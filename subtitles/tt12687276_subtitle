'What's life without nature!'

'An end to pain!'

Vidya, switch off the motor.

Vidya!
- Yeah, I heard you!

36
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,746
Switch off the motor!
- Ask him to drink Horlicks.

37
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:42,636
Didn't you drink Horlicks?

38
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,136
Go, drink it..
- Hands up!

39
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:47,183
Get going!

40
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:49,738
Dad, Blackie is running away!

41
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:51,044
Shaji, go fast.
- Hey!

42
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,779
The stray dogs have given birth to
big bunch of puppies at the field.

43
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,576
Blackie!
- Blackie will attack and kill them!

00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:16,215
Get inside.

53
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,183
Dad, bring him here.
This is his pace.

54
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,644
Not 'pace'.
It's place!

55
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,839
Why are you locking Blackie
up over there? Let him open.

56
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:28,464
And you want your grandpa to
create a ruckus over here?

57
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,371
If his hair falls over here,
grandpa will go short of breath!

58
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,660
When will grandpa
be cured from that?

59
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,933
I don't think he will
be cured anytime soon.

60
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:50,822
Sheesh! Why are you crying?
Come here.

61
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,072
Boys shouldn't cry!

62
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:57,181
If you wanted it, you should
have fought with me and taken it.

63
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,993
Didn't we watch a movie
at Palakkad the other day?

64
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,370
Yes, in an AC theatre.
'Jagannadhan'

65
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:04,574
You should hit like that.

66
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,409
But Jagannadhan
couldn't aim properly.

67
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,292
His spear never hit
the target either.

68
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,779
But this Jagannadhan
is stinking now.

69
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,275
Don't you want to have a bath?
- No.

70
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,237
Why?
- I am upset with you, dad.

71
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,262
For what?

72
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,847
You give a bath to
both Blackie and mom.

73
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:19,441
You never give me a bath.

74
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:20,934
Who told this to you?

75
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,935
I heard you telling mom.

76
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,860
Oh no! Don't spin me!
Oh no! The house is spinning!

77
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:37,831
Dad, is this your house
or grandpa's house?

78
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,340
Dad's house. No doubt about it.
Haven't you seen on the gate?

79
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,365
Shaji 'Nivas' (House).

80
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,069
But mom said that this
is grandpa's house!

82
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:16,024
Park it over there.

83
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:21,841
Hands up, grandpa!

84
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:23,241
Drive properly.
- Appu, come here.

85
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,296
You got back last night, is it?

86
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,413
What about the thing you went for?

87
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:35,469
Did you hire him again?

88
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,820
I've given you many
second chances, right?

89
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:41,304
Consider this also like that.

90
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:44,742
Anyway, don't leave cash in
the dashboard again.

91
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,515
You also wasted a lot of money
in the name of doing business, right?

92
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,765
5000 Rupees is
nothing compared to that.

93
00:10:58,053 --> 00:10:59,053
See you.

94
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:18,880
I'll shoot down these jack fruits.

95
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:19,927
Yeah, right.

96
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:22,674
Stop!

97
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,106
Come here, you...

98
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,799
It's a sweet, firm fleshed one.

99
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:29,824
It had fallen down.

100
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,798
Half was bitten by birds,
but it's still superb.

101
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,640
So I thought I'll
take 10-20 pieces.

102
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,275
Dad likes it a lot.

103
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:39,727
What happened?

104
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,375
You seem upset.

105
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:44,195
Dad just keeps blabbering...

106
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:46,780
Come here, Appu.
- No.

107
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,367
Here.

108
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:50,459
Go, give this to grandpa.

109
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,054
'Appu's grandpa!'

110
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,085
If that upsets you, imagine my plight! I
should have fled from here long back then.

111
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,747
Your dad is really frustrated.

112
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:02,068
He was taunting me a
lot ever since you left.

113
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,763
That's why I thought
I'll go home.

114
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:09,411
Dad talks as if I forced you
to do farming at Attappadi.

115
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:12,318
Let 2 days pass.

116
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,865
Please. Take me home tomorrow itself.

117
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:16,404
Mathappoo is there now.

118
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:19,997
Tomorrow is the 25th, right?

119
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,269
It's dad's check-up date.

120
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:24,686
If I come to drop you,

121
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,062
he'll vent all his anger
on you, when you come back.

122
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,250
Do you want that?

123
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:42,129
I'll take you home
some other day.

124
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:47,416
If you don't have time, call
Ani and ask him to drop me home.

125
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:49,411
Ani has come there earlier, right?

126
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:57,576
You didn't even turn
up for Ramya's wedding.

127
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,709
I had gone to check out
the land at Attappadi then, right?

128
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:03,115
And my vehicle broke down too.

129
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,264
Call your dad and ask him
to send Sudhiyettan here.

130
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,302
Oh yeah! I just remembered.

131
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,646
Aunt Meena had called.

132
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,130
To ask about Vinu's
admission in Bangalore.

133
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,115
The money is ready apparently.

134
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,569
I had told her that you had
gone to Bangalore, Shaji.

135
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,794
I said that I'll call
her once you're back.

136
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:22,028
Won't he get admission in our college?

137
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:23,896
Isn't it okay?

138
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
It is okay!

139
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,332
[Dog barking]

140
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,871
Shall we pluck the arecanuts?

141
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:57,118
Do it after one week.

142
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:58,330
Don't delay it.

143
00:13:58,355 --> 00:13:59,565
Once it starts raining,
we can't climb.

144
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,590
Let's do it.

145
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,516
Looks like it will
be sunny tomorrow.

146
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,977
I have to go to the hospital
tomorrow. Let that be done.

147
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:09,361
I'm here, right?

148
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:10,571
We can call Tamilian workers.

149
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,970
They work for lesser wages.

150
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:13,947
Velu and his boys
have gone somewhere.

151
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,519
Call just 3 or 4 people.
- Okay.

152
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,791
It's okay.

153
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:48,049
What happened?

154
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:49,074
Ghost!

155
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,099
Ghost?

156
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,124
Where?

157
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,704
Near the well.

158
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:54,584
Near the well?
- Yes.

159
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,659
Son, that is Mani Aashan.

160
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,793
Mani Aashan just
dresses up as the Ghost.

161
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,456
The Ghost catches only bad kids.

162
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,745
Are you a bad kid?
- No.

163
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:07,598
Then what's the problem?

164
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:20,726
Minister Pinarayi
Vijayan said that

165
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,373
the electricity charges need
not be increased in Kerala.

166
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:25,850
All time record price for pepper.

167
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,842
French Open tennis
tournament begins tomorrow.

168
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:49,768
Has he slept?

169
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:51,439
Yes.

170
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,484
It's been 2 days since
he slept properly.

171
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,165
He was with the colouring book
that Jithu gave, day and night.

172
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,025
He draws quite well.

173
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:10,360
Look! He has drawn you
as an angel with a gun.

174
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,149
He might do well if
we give him a push.

175
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,408
He's my son, after all.

176
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:36,100
Shaji, I've called Ani and told him...

177
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:38,303
... about dropping me home.

178
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:44,139
Why?
Sudhi won't come?

179
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,740
I had called my brother first.

180
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,827
But since he's getting a fresh
load at his shop tomorrow,

181
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:50,008
he said he can't come.

182
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,241
He's busy tomorrow.

183
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:52,498
That's why I called Ani.

184
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,381
He is free tomorrow.

185
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:04,987
Looks like it will rain heavily.

186
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:08,409
Tomorrow there will be
workers at the field too.

187
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:14,366
Just 2 days.

188
00:17:14,506 --> 00:17:15,959
I'll go and come back soon.

189
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:17,343
I need a break.

190
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:20,560
If I stay here in this mindset,
I'll be even more disturbed.

191
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:24,357
I'll just go quickly,
get refreshed and come back.

192
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,712
The workers will
need food tomorrow.

193
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,378
Prepare that before you leave.
- Okay.

194
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I missed this.

195
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,963
For the past 3 days.

196
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:49,932
If this admissions plan works out,
shall we shift to Bangalore?

197
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,846
I can give tuitions.

198
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,573
Appu will get better education too.

199
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,058
No.

200
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,142
It won't be right if
we shift from here now.

201
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,519
Why?

202
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,197
Then dad will tell everyone that we
left him alone in his old age.

203
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:09,285
Shaji...

204
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,642
Don't take dad's harsh
behaviour to your heart.

205
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:14,534
He's quite old, right?

206
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:18,478
A character change at this age,
is not practical.

207
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:24,760
His main problem is that I bought
the land with your dad's money,

208
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,285
without listening to him.

209
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:28,353
Just that he's not saying it out.

210
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,301
And that flopped big time as well.

211
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,299
When dad called, he said he's
selling all the pepper in the house.

212
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:40,468
We can't predict how the
market is going to be.

213
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:45,040
He said that if there's another
war, prices will definitely go down.

214
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:48,765
It will be foolish to
wait till 2000 apparently.

215
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,697
What are you thinking?

216
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:55,499
You changed the subject so beautifully.

217
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:57,674
My treasure!

218
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:00,832
You are my treasure!

219
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,789
Don't eat it all at once.
Your teeth will decay.

220
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,539
Will Blackie's teeth decay too?

221
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:21,907
He's not supposed to eat this.
There are bones for him.

222
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,015
Hey!

223
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:27,507
You remember that we have to
go for my check-up, right?

224
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:28,532
Yes.

225
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:31,720
She wants to go to her
house with Appu today.

226
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:33,178
It's been long, right?

227
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:35,672
I've called Ani.
He will come.

228
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,850
He will drop them.

229
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,327
But when the workers come,
if there's no one here...

230
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,733
No need.

231
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,914
Manu will come.
I will go with him.

232
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,555
I have to go to the bank as well.
It will take some time.

233
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:56,063
Has Lalitha Chechi come?
- No.

234
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,556
It's not time yet.

235
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:02,912
Ask her to cook the
chicken with bell pepper.

236
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:06,576
Hey!

237
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:09,522
Peel those onions, please.

238

['Vaan Megham' from Punnagai

239
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,476
Do you have to go today?

240
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:25,687
Shaji, you know how difficult it was for
me to take this decision, right?

241
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,758
Please support that decision.

242
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,188
I need that support.

243
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:32,422
You have my support.

244
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,654
But I'll be alone here.

245
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,047
Go and come back soon.

246
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:40,734
Such magical weather, right?

247
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:45,047
Shall I smoke a cigarette here?

248
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,093
Dad won't come here.

249
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:28,165
Not now.

250
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:30,940
There are people outside.

251
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:33,833
There's light all around.

252
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,888
Do we have pineapple here?
- Yes.

253
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Have it!

254
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,533
Was your dad always
like this to you, Shaji?

255
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:30,318
Shaji!

256
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:09,767
Who's that?

257
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,024
You've made that
place all dirty.

258
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,774
There's an orange inside
the cupboard in my room.

259
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,744
Is it 9 o'clock?

260
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:28,087
It's 9:10 AM.

261
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,745
Oops.

262
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:36,207
Oh! You're here, Chechi?

263
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:38,597
I got a little late.
Aren't you going today?

264
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:39,957
I'll leave at 10:30.

265
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,590
There are cobwebs on the window sills.
Please clean them.

267
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,074

00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:53,493
Okay.

269
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:11,526

eye on the things outside.

Vidya!

272
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:12,876
What happened?
- Dad...

273
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:14,984
Dad!

274
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:18,491
Slowly...

275
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:39,191
I felt like someone suddenly
pushed me from behind.

276
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,330
Gently...

277
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:52,000
Who's going to push you?
You just might have felt so.

278
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:53,415
I said what I felt.

279
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:57,056
Gently...

280
00:32:01,924 --> 00:32:03,853
Son, go and bring grandpa's
spectacles. - Okay.

281
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:08,244
Where are these workers from?

282
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,831
Many of them have
landed at Patthirippala.

283
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,963
They do all the chores outside
the houses, in the town now.

284
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:16,636
They charge less too.

285
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:22,316
Dad, shall we plant Robusta
bananas at Chammala fields?

286
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,128
Good quality seeds
are available now.

287
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,228
Reji deals with that now.

288
00:32:26,618 --> 00:32:27,618
Shall I do it?

289
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:29,225
I heard that the
yield is good now.

290
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:31,301
Dad?

291
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:35,021
Get the title deed ready and sell
that land for whatever price you get,

292
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:37,167
and deposit the money
in her account first.

293
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:57,518
What is it?

294
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,871
Didn't I ask you to tie a
net under that coconut tree?

295
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,484
What's the point in telling you?

296
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,069
He never listens to what I say.

297
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:32,483
Mani!

298
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,342
Hey Mani!
- Chechi, give this to them.

299
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,624
Mani!
- Let them eat.

300
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:37,217
Yes.
What is it, Raviyetta?

301
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:40,460
One of the roof tiles in the
kitchen has to be changed.

302
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,683
There will be some left at the shed, right?
- Yes.

303
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,708
Take that.

304
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,904
And yeah, when you go,
tie a net under that coconut tree.

305
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:52,736
Sathyan, ask that Tamilian guy to
get 3-4 roof tiles from that shed.

306
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,197
Take the ladder as well.

307
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,087
Maniyetta, have some tea and go.

308
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:59,423
Wait. I have some work.
- To change the roof tile, right?

309
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:00,579
It's not going to rain now.

310
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,056
Why should you hurry then?
- Okay. Let me see.

311
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:05,970
It's 10 o'clock.
Hey!

312
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:07,549
You can do it after having tea.

313
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:08,956
Call all of them.

314
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,112
What about yesterday's chicken curry?
- It's over.

315
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,839
Do you have the oil
that you applied on dad?

316
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Shut up!

317

318
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:09,919

Brother!

322
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:21,323
Where do I dump this?

323
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:22,949
Dump it under that coconut tree.

324
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:24,417
Hey! Hey!

325
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:26,975
Go and change that roof tile
after washing your hands.

326
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:28,627
The roof tile!
Who am I saying this to?

327
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:48,016
Where is Appu?

328
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:53,016
He's outside, dad.
He's playing with Blackie.

329
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,867
Bring him inside.
Playing, it seems!

330
00:36:57,637 --> 00:36:59,324
I've come at the right time, huh?

331
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,707
Come, sit down.
Have some food.

332
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:02,732
No, dude.

333
00:37:03,076 --> 00:37:04,591
I had breakfast from home.

334
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:06,436
I can have some tea though.

335
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,454
You have a check-up today, dad?

336
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:09,817
Yes.

337
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:11,823
Manu said he will come,
but he isn't here yet.

338
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:12,932
Manu is outside.

339
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:14,688
Is he here?

340
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:16,853
Why can't he say that he has reached?

341
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,440
That's quite a lot!

342
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:27,128
Dad...

343
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:29,013
What should I do about
those Robusta bananas?

344
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:30,692
Reji had called day
before yesterday too.

345
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:32,748
Must be to ask about this.
- What is it? Farming?

346
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,728
Is it one of your
experiments like earlier?

347
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:41,647
Are you planning to waste
your dad's money again?

348
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,541
What's your problem, you fucker?

349
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:30,321
Hey! What is this?

350
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:33,759
I'll come to your house and return your
money today evening or tomorrow morning.

351
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:35,820
Don't come to my
house and mock me, you fucker.

352
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:37,048
I'm already pissed off here.

353
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:41,316
Everyone has their own needs.
You should understand that.

354
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,776
You're not the only one in this world.

355
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:47,903
This behaviour of yours.
It's not right.

356
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,818
You've been saying
that you'll repay...

357
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,881
Ani, I'll come in ten minutes.

358
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:53,248
Yeah. Take your time.

359
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,213
Hey! Are you listening to me?

360
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:00,871
I'll give it, man.

361
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:20,496
Chechi...

362
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,320
We are leaving.
- Be really naughty over there.

363
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:25,454
Chechi, before you go, please serve
the food for Shaji and the workers.

364
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,479
Okay, dear.

365
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,870
Uncle Ani, did you see
my new Tom & Jerry bag?

366
00:39:32,895 --> 00:39:33,895
Is it new?
- Yes.

367
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
You're so smart.

368
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,776
We're ready, Ani.
Come.

369
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:40,260
Blackie, we are leaving.

370
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:46,445
Tell Blackie that
we'll be back in 2 days.

371
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:48,898
Blackie, we'll be back
in two days, okay?

372
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:51,766
Check the air of the back tyre.

373
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:54,214
Shaji...

374
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:57,914
Blackie, we'll be back
in two days, okay?

375
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,900
Check the air of the back tyre.
- Shaji!

376
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:02,646
Yes, coming!

377
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:04,701
And I need your
pick up truck's key.

378
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:06,768
I have to send the
arecanuts before it rains.

379
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:16,692
Look!

380
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:46,651
Shaji, there's no problem here, right?
It's just my imagination, right?

381
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:55,386
Tell me that it's all the
fear within me, Shaji.

382
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:57,774
There's no problem here.

383
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,916
Go and come back happily.

384
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:18,650
Bye bye, Blackie.

385
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,155
Stop howling and climb
the next areca palm.

386
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,311
Gaping over there?

387
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:36,746
Got scared?

388
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:37,863
Yes, a little.

389
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:39,808
By the way...

390
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,700
Where are these workers from?

391
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:43,055
They are Tamilians.

392
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,627
One of them is from
Attappadi, I guess.

393
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:46,245
Is Attappadi in
Kerala or Tamil Nadu?

394
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,270
Who knows!

395
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:49,214
The other one is my sister's son.

396
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,496
Sathyan. He has also joined us.

397
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:51,707
Okay.

398
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,839
Just like you asked...

399
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,229
All of them look quite creepy.

400
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,511
I hand-picked them.

401
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:57,996
Shall we start then?

402
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:00,362
It's not the right time yet.
Let Lalitha leave.

403
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,504
She might tell Dad.

404
00:44:02,323 --> 00:44:03,956
Then I'll climb two
more palms and come.

405
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:12,097
Come on.

406
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,195
Hello?
- This is Jithen. When did you reach?

407
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,562
Yes, Advocate.
I reached last night.

408
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:15,680
What about the thing you went for?

409
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,508
It didn't happen.

410
00:45:18,227 --> 00:45:19,664
You know what will happen if you
don't settle it this week, right?

411
00:45:19,813 --> 00:45:20,930
You'll go behind bars!

412
00:45:22,508 --> 00:45:24,163
We need to go to
Thiruvananthapuram.

413
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,911
What?
- Can I get some water?

414
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:26,936
Okay.

415
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,523
You'll have to spend some money!

416
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,906
But you can become free.

417
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Hello?

418
00:45:35,326 --> 00:45:36,326
Here you go.
- Shaji!

419
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:56,219
Save it up. It will be needed later.
- What?

420
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,570
Hello? Shaji?
Shaji?

421
00:45:58,595 --> 00:45:59,907
I'll call you back, Advocate.

422
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,018
You...!!!

423
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,637
What's your problem, fucker?

424
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,669
Didn't you get a bigger one?

425
00:49:02,714 --> 00:49:04,308
No. I got only this.

426
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:07,455
Okay. I'll clean it.
You load this stuff.

427
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:08,769
Okay.

428
00:50:16,537 --> 00:50:17,537
Bau!

429
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:24,857
Bau!

430
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,048
What is it?
Were you trying to steal something?

431
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:04,409
Don't worry.

432
00:52:04,434 --> 00:52:05,808
I will not call the police.

433
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
Tell me.

434
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,760
Tell me, kiddo.

435
00:52:13,704 --> 00:52:15,110
I have a lot of work to do.

436
00:52:17,071 --> 00:52:18,696
I have to finish all that,
after this.

437
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:24,398
Are you tongue-tied now, you swine?

438
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,724
If you're not planning to say it,
you'll lie here.

439
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,778
I'll beat you to death like a dog.

440
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:36,916
And I'll bury you at some
corner of this field.

441
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:39,323
No one's going to
question me!

442
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,228
That boy was with
the hooch brewer Velangan.

443
00:53:22,685 --> 00:53:25,309
I sensed something wrong when I
heard that he was from Attappadi.

444
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:26,334
I have seen him earlier.

445
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,475
It was his dog that died when you
burst that local bomb at the estate.

446
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,430
He has come to take
revenge for that.

447
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:33,169
He had gone to Paul first.

448
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,010
He beat him to pulp apparently.

449
00:53:35,035 --> 00:53:36,035
For killing a dog?

450
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:37,525
How many of them were there?

451
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,097
This boy was alone.

452
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:41,784
And finally, Paul said your name.

453
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,186
All the liabilities of joint
farming are upon me now, is it?

454
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:47,156
You fucker!

455
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:50,448
This is not about joint farming.
This is your recklessness.

456
00:53:50,578 --> 00:53:51,578
Yours alone.

457
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:53,840
Then who instigated me?
Your dad?

458
00:54:31,366 --> 00:54:32,366
It's wild buffalo meat.

459
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,374
Caught by real hunters!

460
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:39,757
- It's a piglet!

461
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,414
These tribals whom
you call brainless?

462
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:48,396
They are much
smarter in hunting!

463
00:55:00,914 --> 00:55:02,859
Electric shocks and local bombs...

464
00:55:03,003 --> 00:55:04,627
didn't even touch the pig's hair!

465
00:55:06,015 --> 00:55:07,607
Your experiments are impressive, Shaji.

466
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,427
But... nothing is working out.

467
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:34,092
Bau!

468
00:55:41,827 --> 00:55:42,827
Bau!

469
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:15,975
All that meat is getting wasted!

470
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,303
Paid all the money he
had and bought this land.

471
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:22,788
Did farming which he
had no clue about!

472
00:56:22,994 --> 00:56:25,033
At least hire someone
who knows the job!

473
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:29,599
Or pack your bags and give everything
to the pigs here and leave!

474
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:28,723
He's really violent.

475
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:32,469
Their people say that
God has possessed him.

476
00:57:33,027 --> 00:57:34,445
He is a lunatic.

477
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:35,933
He's just acting like a lunatic.

478
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:38,899
I had also acted like one,
when I failed my pre degree course.

479
00:57:40,348 --> 00:57:41,348
I'll deal with this.

480
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:42,664
No problem as yet, right?

481
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:45,991
No problem. I beat him up and
locked him up in the shed.

482
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:26,675
Hey!

483
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,160
Where the hell were you?

484
00:59:29,104 --> 00:59:30,627
Roaming around without
doing any work?

485
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:33,245
If you roam around and stretch your hand in
the evening, I won't give a single penny!

486
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:36,667
The vigour your showed to ask for work?
Show that in your work!

487
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:38,471
And yeah!

488
00:59:38,496 --> 00:59:39,767
If you do the work
you're asked to do,

489
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:40,861
I'll pay you in the evening.

490
00:59:40,908 --> 00:59:42,228
Or go do whatever job you like.

491
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:48,324
There are only 5-6 areca palms.
And they are lazing around.

492
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:49,449
Go and do your work!

493
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:51,272
- Maniyetta, come and have food.

494
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:57,559
Sathyan!
Hey!

495
00:59:57,584 --> 00:59:58,904
Yes!
- Did you see my watch?

496
00:59:59,188 --> 01:00:00,188
No, Uncle.

497
01:00:02,785 --> 01:00:04,003
It's 1:30 PM, Aashaan.

498
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,440
Come on.

499
01:00:16,636 --> 01:00:17,636
Come and have lunch.

500
01:00:18,126 --> 01:00:20,094
It will be 4:30 PM by the time it's done.
Then you can have tea as well.

501
01:00:20,603 --> 01:00:21,603
Come fast.

502
01:00:21,691 --> 01:00:22,745
I have to invite you or what?

503
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:24,312
Can't you hear me?

504
01:00:24,337 --> 01:00:25,359
Come and have food.

505
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,672
That will take another
hour and a half.

506
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:44,015
Did someone run this way?
- Who?

507
01:00:44,124 --> 01:00:45,960
I must have imagined it then.

508
01:00:49,596 --> 01:00:51,213
Shall I leave, son?
- Okay.

509
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:20,078
'The son of this family, born in the
star 'Karthika', with the name Shaji.'

510
01:01:20,103 --> 01:01:26,629
'The son of this family, born in the
star 'Karthika', with the name Shaji.'

511
01:01:26,654 --> 01:01:27,732
Sathyan...

512
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:30,994
This was the land where my
grandfather and Uncle Kelu used to stay.

513
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:33,049
These guys usurped it from us.

514
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,206
We've become good for
nothings, right Uncle?

515
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:43,901
'All your sufferings and
distress should end'

516
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,426
'All your sins should be absolved'

517
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,841
'All your sufferings and
distress should end'

518
01:01:51,813 --> 01:01:53,375
When there was a
conflict in between,

519
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:56,972
the scar from an attack from my father,
is still on Ravi's face.

520
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:58,540
What are you saying?

521
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,831
Long, long ago...

522
01:02:06,415 --> 01:02:08,430
... all this land was ours!

523
01:02:11,822 --> 01:02:13,313
Long, long ago means?

524
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:16,932
Eat!
Have your food!

525
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:39,901
Those who came in like this,

526
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:41,800
vanquished us and left.

527
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:31,610
What's happening, Aashan?

528
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:33,142
Is it done yet?
- Almost.

529
01:03:33,774 --> 01:03:34,774
Has Lalitha left?

530
01:03:35,814 --> 01:03:36,814
Yes.

531
01:03:37,555 --> 01:03:38,555
Shall we start then?

532
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:43,821
Why do you always lock him up?
Set him free. Let him run around.

533
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,190
No.

534
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:47,839
What's his breed?

535
01:03:48,354 --> 01:03:49,830
Cane Corso.
- What?

536
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:52,466
Cane Corso.

537
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:54,401
Whatever said and done,

538
01:03:54,488 --> 01:03:57,736
there's only one being that gives back
double the love that we give them.

539
01:03:57,761 --> 01:03:58,761
Dogs!

540
01:03:59,804 --> 01:04:00,804
I have one at home.

541
01:04:00,993 --> 01:04:03,422
A local breed.
We don't tie him up. He's always free.

542
01:04:04,398 --> 01:04:05,679
This one's not local.

543
01:04:06,531 --> 01:04:07,531
He's foreign.

544
01:04:08,118 --> 01:04:10,602
It's a rich breed. So he has
to be treated differently.

545
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:12,646
So, shall I...?

546
01:04:13,326 --> 01:04:14,755
You go have food.

547
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:15,835
We already had food.

548
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,070
Did everyone eat?

549
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:20,569
No.

550
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:22,830
There's a small problem.
Come there with the key.

551
01:04:23,547 --> 01:04:24,547
I'll tell you.

552
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:39,657
Sathyan!
- Yes!

553
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,540
Climb on 10 more palms.

554
01:04:41,688 --> 01:04:43,336
I'll send these guys back soon.
There's some other work.

555
01:04:43,697 --> 01:04:45,399
Okay, Uncle.
- [in Tamil] Get down!

556
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:47,431
[in Tamil] You have other work.
Come on!

557
01:07:00,089 --> 01:07:01,089
Shaji!

558
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:02,857
That's quite a lot.

559
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:05,821
Let's take 8 sacks
for the time being.

560
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:29,911
Caught him red-handed.

561
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:32,360
I slapped him as
soon as I caught him.

562
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:34,616
He ran away.

563
01:07:35,354 --> 01:07:36,354
Bloody thief.

564
01:07:36,379 --> 01:07:39,169
When they come looking for work,
how can I identify their characters?

565
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:40,511
Each one is a different type.

566
01:07:40,536 --> 01:07:42,489
Anyway, I got my watch back.

567
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,520
Hey! Hold this.

568
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:47,409
We trust these guys and bring them.

569
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,359
And they end up messing with us!

570
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:06,260
Make it fast!

571
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:16,212
Stop admiring it and go
load it into the vehicle.

572
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,967
He's admiring its beauty!

573
01:08:31,717 --> 01:08:32,717
Fill it quickly!

574
01:08:52,178 --> 01:08:54,287
Kiddo... that day.... I
didn't do it deliberately.

575
01:08:55,317 --> 01:08:57,027
It just happened so,
because I was drunk.

576
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,825
I can understand your emotion.

577
01:08:59,443 --> 01:09:01,006
I'll buy a new dog for you.

578
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:11,610
I will kill your dog.

579
01:09:25,714 --> 01:09:27,626
I'll buy a better dog for you.

580
01:09:27,813 --> 01:09:29,243
A Dobermann or an Alsatian...

581
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,923
It was a local dog
that died, right?

582
01:09:31,587 --> 01:09:32,876
I'll buy an awesome dog for you.

583
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,367
Try to understand.

584
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,962
I didn't do it deliberately.

585
01:09:37,057 --> 01:09:39,541
I will kill your dog before
I finish my work here.

586
01:09:47,999 --> 01:09:49,731
For that, I have to
die first, you fucker!

587
01:10:02,212 --> 01:10:03,673
Come fast!
Come on!

588
01:10:09,654 --> 01:10:10,664
Shaji!

589
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,110
Who's that?
What's that sound? Come fast.

590
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:17,399
Shaji, come fast!
- Come fast!

591
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:18,453
Sathyan!

592
01:10:18,707 --> 01:10:19,707
Sathyan!

593
01:10:19,803 --> 01:10:21,180
Son... Sathyan!

594
01:10:21,205 --> 01:10:22,416
Hey!
- Hey! Get up!

595
01:10:22,441 --> 01:10:23,986
Oh God!
What is this!

596
01:10:24,067 --> 01:10:25,386
Sathyan!
- Sathyan!

597
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:27,209
Shaji!

598
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,401
You'll be alright, son.

599
01:10:29,426 --> 01:10:30,426
Where does it hurt?

600
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:31,451
Sathyan!

601
01:10:31,615 --> 01:10:33,527
Shaji, start the vehicle.
Let's take him to the hospital.

602
01:10:33,575 --> 01:10:34,575
Come and help him up.

603
01:10:36,005 --> 01:10:37,293
Hold his hands.

604
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:38,756
Shaji, start the vehicle.
Let's take him to the hospital.

605
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:41,279
Aashan, why don't we
take him to the hospital,

606
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:42,936
after loading the
rest of the pepper?

607
01:10:43,395 --> 01:10:45,702
You know what will happen if
dad sees it lying here, right?

608
01:10:45,802 --> 01:10:47,598
What the fuck are you saying?

609
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:49,659
Is your pepper more important
to you than someone's life?

610
01:10:49,848 --> 01:10:51,207
Give me the key.
I will take him.

611
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:55,161
Shaji, don't complicate things.

612
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,702
If he dies here,
it is only my loss.

613
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,545
Give me the key.
- Hold him!

614
01:10:58,944 --> 01:10:59,944
Hold him!

615
01:11:00,453 --> 01:11:01,998
You'll be alright, son.

616
01:11:07,569 --> 01:11:08,609
You are fine.

617
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:18,403
Shall we go?

618
01:11:20,154 --> 01:11:21,154
Wait.

619
01:11:38,243 --> 01:11:39,992
Shall we go?
- Wait.

620
01:11:40,017 --> 01:11:41,165
What happened?
- Wait.

621
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,475
What is it?
- Wait.

622
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:46,830
Aashaan...

623
01:11:47,775 --> 01:11:49,587
It will only take 10-15 minutes.

624
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:51,868
He will die before that.
Get down!

625
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:54,984
He's sitting here without doing any work.
Get down!

626
01:11:55,994 --> 01:11:58,251
Hey! Load all the pepper
before it rains.

627
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,370
Let's go!

628
01:12:12,486 --> 01:12:14,368
Shaji, I don't have
another option, boy!

629
01:12:25,922 --> 01:12:27,663
Son of a bitch, can't you
understand what I'm saying?

630
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,336
You've been messing around
ever since you came here.

631
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,390
Let me sort this out. I'll buy you
a dog or cat or whatever you want.

632
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:34,360
Now don't get beaten up again.
Go home.

633
01:12:34,673 --> 01:12:36,172
Tell me if you need bus fare.
I'll give you.

634
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,174
What gives you the
courage to mess with me?

635
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:48,934
Come on!

636
01:16:15,728 --> 01:16:17,838
Didn't I tell you decently
first, you fucker?

637
01:16:21,406 --> 01:16:23,182
But you want my dog then!

638
01:16:23,837 --> 01:16:25,837
I'm not going to give
you a dog now, you cunt!

639
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:28,305
Now I will decide when
you will leave from here.

640
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,820
What happened?

641
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:51,079
Why did you come back?
What's the problem?

642
01:17:52,152 --> 01:17:53,246
There's no problem.

643
01:17:54,549 --> 01:17:57,160
What is this?
- It's nothing. I was working in the field.

644
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,378
The door is open. You go inside.
- Did you apply medicine?

645
01:17:59,403 --> 01:18:00,403
I'll come. You go first.

646
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,010
What's the matter?

647
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:05,081
It's nothing.
On our way there,

648
01:18:05,129 --> 01:18:06,356
we saw an accident happening.

649
01:18:06,397 --> 01:18:08,573
Both Vidya and the child got
really scared seeing that.

650
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:10,238
We went a little further after that.

651
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:12,348
But she said let's go back,
and we came back.

652
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:13,443
What happened?

653
01:18:13,538 --> 01:18:15,372
It's nothing.
A pig entered the field.

654
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:16,487
You're not hurt, right?

655
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:18,932
No. I beat it to death and buried it.
That's when this happened.

656
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,199
Where is my pick-up truck?

657
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:22,699
Mani has taken it.

658
01:18:22,909 --> 01:18:24,112
He will bring it
back in some time.

659
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:26,621
You can take my car now. I'll bring
your vehicle home in the evening.

660
01:18:26,646 --> 01:18:28,648
You should settle my cash in the evening.
- I'll give it.

661
01:18:28,696 --> 01:18:29,696
Leave!

662
01:18:29,721 --> 01:18:32,289
You will do it only if I say it like this.
That's why.

663
01:18:34,064 --> 01:18:35,064
And then, the problem.

664
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:36,719
That's in your eyes!

665
01:19:13,019 --> 01:19:14,228
I'm serious.

666
01:19:15,799 --> 01:19:17,072
This blood smells different.

667
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:19,901
You smell different too!

668
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,330
You got really scared, is it?

669
01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:29,173
Can you give me a hug?

670
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:35,728
This is common on the roads, right?

671
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:38,556
Firstly, that turning
is fresh in my memory.

672
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:42,944
We had skidded there during the
time when Appu was conceived.

673
01:19:45,803 --> 01:19:47,107
It was a young boy.

674
01:19:47,553 --> 01:19:49,100
And there was blood
all over the road.

675
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:51,810
Appu got really scared.

676
01:19:53,928 --> 01:19:57,522
How can people hit someone
and go without stopping?

677
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:13,984
You take rest for some time.

678
01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:20,460
Will you take him with you?

679
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:22,328
Let me lie down for a while.

680
01:20:47,035 --> 01:20:49,191
Won't you sit here watching
Uncle Jackie's fights?

681
01:20:50,216 --> 01:20:51,216
Okay.

682
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:17,604
Hey!

683
01:21:18,518 --> 01:21:20,002
I'll throw this rope.
Climb up!

684
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:22,940
Hey kiddo!

685
01:21:24,049 --> 01:21:25,400
Come on up!
I won't hurt you!

686
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:29,478
When I came to save you,
you're being a prick again?

687
01:25:25,522 --> 01:25:27,428
Even when I kept
on holding back...

688
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:29,920
you want your damn revenge?

689
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:13,051
I lied that I killed your
dog because I was drunk.

690
01:27:13,621 --> 01:27:15,910
I got a great high
when I killed it.

691
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:39,706
Die, you fucker!

692
01:33:43,782 --> 01:33:45,250
What the fuck do you want?

693
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,195
I want that 'high'
you spoke about!

694
01:33:51,922 --> 01:33:54,125
For that, I have to die,
you Nigger!

695
01:34:20,722 --> 01:34:22,800
[Mani Aashan : Load all the
pepper before it rains, okay?]

696
01:34:43,925 --> 01:34:44,925
You...!!

697
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,819
[car horn]

698
01:37:07,106 --> 01:37:08,106
You're here?

699
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:10,290
Where the hell were you?

700
01:37:10,401 --> 01:37:11,541
I was at the field.

701
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:13,986
Got your leg bandaged?

702
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:15,128
Does it hurt?

703
01:37:16,477 --> 01:37:17,765
What happened here?

704
01:37:20,688 --> 01:37:22,625
I saw Mani at the hospital.

705
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:24,637
What happened to that worker?

706
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:27,574
Didn't you hear me?

707
01:37:29,868 --> 01:37:30,868
Dad...

708
01:37:35,314 --> 01:37:37,556
Some of the pepper which was
in our shed is missing now.

709
01:37:41,798 --> 01:37:42,798
Missing?

710
01:37:43,658 --> 01:37:44,658
Say it clearly.

711
01:37:45,454 --> 01:37:47,633
The Tamilian workers
shifted it somewhere else.

712
01:37:48,061 --> 01:37:51,059
I had a doubt and whacked them.
One of them fell unconscious.

713
01:38:00,503 --> 01:38:02,557
But... where is the pepper now?

714
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:05,815
I was looking for it. I have no
idea where they shifted it to.

715
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,551
Why the hell weren't
you watching them?

716
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:09,745
Vidya and Appu came
back, in between that.

717
01:38:09,871 --> 01:38:11,097
Some accident on the road.

718
01:38:13,793 --> 01:38:15,433
You went into the
room when she came.

719
01:38:15,536 --> 01:38:18,184
And those guys stole
my stuff in that gap.

720
01:38:18,783 --> 01:38:20,010
It's not like that, dad.

721
01:38:20,035 --> 01:38:21,785
Why do you care if I
lose my pepper, right?

722
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:23,293
It costs around 2.5 Lakhs.

723
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:26,598
I should have asked that dog to guard it,
instead of you.

724
01:38:35,173 --> 01:38:36,173
Dad!

725
01:38:36,807 --> 01:38:39,150
Leave me!
Go and find my stuff!

726
01:38:39,332 --> 01:38:40,522
You also go with him!

727
01:38:47,124 --> 01:38:48,124
You can leave.

728
01:38:48,462 --> 01:38:49,537
I can do this myself.

729
01:38:50,983 --> 01:38:51,983
Don't worry.

730
01:38:52,124 --> 01:38:53,514
I haven't told
your dad anything.

731
01:38:57,342 --> 01:38:58,514
Close the gate when you go.

732
01:39:01,061 --> 01:39:03,592
You've tried to secure the
power of the armour of God.

733
01:39:03,617 --> 01:39:05,953
Such a God must be very powerful.

734
01:39:06,228 --> 01:39:07,954
What is the name of your God?

735
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:10,931
My God is more powerful than
you could possibly imagine.

736
01:39:13,502 --> 01:39:14,837
My God's name is...

737
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:15,908
.... money!

738
01:39:37,684 --> 01:39:40,496
I have a doubt whether Mani
Aashan is also involved in this.

739
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:49,778
Why else should he bring new
workers whom we haven't seen so far?

740
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:06,384
I preserved what my father earned
with his brain and brawn.

741
01:40:07,344 --> 01:40:09,922
You grew under its shade.
You won't understand its value.

742
01:40:10,954 --> 01:40:14,066
The pepper in that shed
is more valuable than you.

743
01:40:18,243 --> 01:40:20,493
When I step out in the evening,

744
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:23,501
the lost pepper should
be back in the shed.

745
01:43:22,985 --> 01:43:24,244
You...!!!

746
01:43:57,747 --> 01:43:59,277
That was worth Lakhs of Rupees!

747
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:24,890
Hey!

748
01:48:25,085 --> 01:48:26,085
You...!!

749
01:49:34,727 --> 01:49:36,000
Hey Shaji!

750
01:49:36,992 --> 01:49:38,999
Shaji, what's the problem?

751
01:49:39,914 --> 01:49:43,211
Shaji, what all troubles
are you bringing upon us?

752
01:49:43,812 --> 01:49:44,812
Shaji!

753
01:49:52,248 --> 01:49:54,084
Hey! What are you doing?

754
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:56,826
What should I do with the guy who's trying
to steal our stuff from our property?

755
01:50:05,795 --> 01:50:07,021
Should I let him go?

756
01:52:48,047 --> 01:52:49,047
Shaji....

757
01:52:51,931 --> 01:52:52,931
Shaji...

758
01:52:54,851 --> 01:52:56,031
Shaji, what happened?

759
01:53:03,633 --> 01:53:05,056
Shaji...
- Hey Shaji!

760
01:53:05,555 --> 01:53:06,555
Who is he?

761
01:53:07,891 --> 01:53:09,507
Tell us who it is, Shaji.

762
01:53:10,438 --> 01:53:11,937
Tell us what the
problem is, Shaji.

763
01:53:12,422 --> 01:53:14,179
I'm asking you!
Who is he?

764
01:53:16,805 --> 01:53:18,352
You've destroyed
our peace of mind.

765
01:53:20,485 --> 01:53:22,121
Shaji, who is it?

766
01:53:24,821 --> 01:53:26,430
He's the one who stole our pepper.
- So?

767
01:53:26,743 --> 01:53:29,211
If you fight and kill each other,
will we get it back?

768
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:34,220
Mommy!

769
01:53:34,251 --> 01:53:35,251
Son...

770
01:53:35,393 --> 01:53:37,721
I told you to take Manu along.

771
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,814
Let me call the police.

772
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:41,602
I know what to do!

773
01:53:43,396 --> 01:53:44,396
Shaji...

774
01:53:44,421 --> 01:53:45,874
Set Blackie free.

775
01:53:45,927 --> 01:53:47,013
He will handle it.

776
01:53:54,912 --> 01:53:55,912
Hey!

777
01:53:56,216 --> 01:53:57,216
Hey you!

778
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:01,412
You came to kill the dog, right?

779
01:54:01,772 --> 01:54:03,616
He's in the kennel.
Kill him and get lost!

780
01:55:45,052 --> 01:55:46,052
Shaji...

781
01:55:46,162 --> 01:55:47,752
Don't do it.

782
01:55:48,839 --> 01:55:50,114
What are you doing?

783
01:55:50,567 --> 01:55:51,975
Shaji...!!
- Shaji...!!

784
01:55:52,507 --> 01:55:53,507
Hey!

785
01:55:58,367 --> 01:55:59,367
Son!

786
01:55:59,455 --> 01:56:00,455
Shaji!

787
01:56:00,766 --> 01:56:02,177
What are you doing?

788
01:56:04,773 --> 01:56:06,132
Mommy!
- Shaji!

789
01:56:06,579 --> 01:56:08,393
Shaji, he will die!

790
01:56:19,976 --> 01:56:20,976
Shaji!

791
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:22,281
I'm telling you!

792
01:56:22,322 --> 01:56:23,322
No!

793
01:56:23,816 --> 01:56:24,931
I said no!

794
01:56:25,944 --> 01:56:26,944
Leave him!

795
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:28,300
Let go of him!

796
01:56:29,879 --> 01:56:31,718
Dear... Just tell him!

797
01:56:33,672 --> 01:56:34,672
Shaji...

798
01:56:34,934 --> 01:56:35,934
Leave him!

799
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:11,410
Shaji...

800
01:57:12,182 --> 01:57:13,631
Dad...
- Hey!

801
01:57:14,915 --> 01:57:15,915
No!

802
01:57:18,665 --> 01:57:19,665
Hey!

803
01:57:21,233 --> 01:57:22,750
If you hit them,
it won't affect me.

804
01:57:22,775 --> 01:57:23,746
Move away!

805
01:57:23,771 --> 01:57:24,771
I am here!

806
01:57:24,869 --> 01:57:25,869
Come on!

807
02:01:24,944 --> 02:01:26,100
Are you done?

808
02:01:29,017 --> 02:01:30,088
Does it hurt?

809
02:01:34,369 --> 02:01:35,843
Do you realize how it feels now?

810
02:02:09,981 --> 02:02:14,881
'I know I'll never forget'

811
02:02:15,693 --> 02:02:19,865
'But I can start up the hill'

812
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:26,654
'Days are grey
Clouds are back'

813
02:02:27,327 --> 02:02:32,225
'Dreaming of my parted friend'

814
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:38,217
'Know the strides to me, far away'

815
02:02:38,975 --> 02:02:43,881
'I’ll remember whole of you forever'

816
02:02:56,135 --> 02:03:01,267
'Sun refused, wounds are deep'

817
02:03:01,963 --> 02:03:05,900
'Your denial, in my heart'

818
02:03:09,493 --> 02:03:10,493
Dear...

819
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,272
Go to him.

820
02:03:15,284 --> 02:03:16,284
Go.

821
02:03:16,757 --> 02:03:17,983
I'll think about it.

822
02:03:44,681 --> 02:03:49,388
'I know I'll never forget my parted friend'

823
02:03:50,529 --> 02:03:55,154
'I’ll be home,
Dreaming high, dreaming low'

824
02:03:56,240 --> 02:04:00,951
'I know I'll never forget my parted friend'

825
02:04:02,045 --> 02:04:06,794
'I’ll be home,
Dreaming high, dreaming low'

826
02:04:07,951 --> 02:04:12,544
'I know I'll never forget my parted friend'

827
02:04:13,685 --> 02:04:18,434
'I’ll be home,
Dreaming high, dreaming low'

828
02:04:43,864 --> 02:04:47,655
'Kala'
[The Unwanted]
