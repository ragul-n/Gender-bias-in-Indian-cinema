1
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,819
Those were very hard times.
The land was afflicted by drought.

2
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,188
Not a drop of rain had
fallen for 10 years.

3
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,490
Every day, hungry people from the
villages left the kingdom in despair.

4
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,133
There was but one hope left
A Great Royal Fire Sacrifice.

5
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,938
That would appease lndra,
Lord of Gods, custodian of rain.

6
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,636
A Great Royal Fire sacrifice.

7
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,873
lmpossible! Chief Priest Paravasu
will never agree.

8
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,010
Did someone call me?

9
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:48,289
Yes, my Lord. There's a troupe of
actors at the city gates.

10
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,622
They want to stage a play in honour
of the fire sacrifice.

11
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,192
l thought the famine had
eaten up all the troupes.

12
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:07,202
This one small troupe survives
That's their manager.

13
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,143
Say whatever you want from
where you're standing.

14
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,776
But don't look at the sacrificial
enclosure, or you'll pollute it.

15
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,191
Your Royal Majesty!O Chief Priest!
O Brahmins!

16
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:28,796
Brahma, Lord of all Creation gave
birth to the art of drama.

17
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:38,974
He handed it over to Lord lndra,
who then gifted it to us humans.

18
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:47,143
So if we wish to please lndra and
rid the land of this long drought.

19
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:54,420
We can't depend only on prayers
The gods need entertainment too.

20
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,996
So l humbly request you to
let us perform a play here.

21
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,064
lf lndra likes it, he might
grant the land rain and salvation.

22
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,397
You called me to decide
this little matter?

23
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:13,741
My Lord, there aren't enough actors
to perform the play.

24
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:20,608
He wants to bring someone new
Your brother, Arvasu.

25
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:27,558
l told him: Arvasu's forbidden to step
in here, get anyone but him.

26
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:36,461
But he says he has a special message
for you from your brother.

27
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,168
Greetings, dear elder brother!

28
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:48,807
You once said to me. The very first
actors in history were Brahmins.

29
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,977
But they lost their caste
because of their profession.

30
00:05:54,554 --> 00:06:00,550
You said, if l valued my high birth
l should not touch this profession.

31
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,855
All these years l have obeyed you.
But today l am branded a criminal.

32
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:16,541
l have killed my father, l'm a
disgrace to Brahmins, l've no caste.

33
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,007
So can't l be an actor now,
according to your own rules?

34
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,781
l trust you won't stop me.

35
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:34,554
Paravasu, you have conducted the
sacrifice flawlessly for 7 years.

36
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:41,426
Let's finish it. Let it rain.
The celebration can come afterwards.

37
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:47,237
As a sacrifice approaches its end,
evil spirits gather in the shadows.

38
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:53,436
We must be careful! -Besides,
you yourself called Arvasu a demon.

39
00:06:55,348 --> 00:07:02,481
Perhaps every sacrifice needs demons
before it can be complete.

40
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,748
lt's a bond we can't break.

41
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,997
Let's have the play,
we shall all watch.

42
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:30,081
Arvasu! Your brother has agreed!

43
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:31,976
Paravasu said yes!

44
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,913
We can do the play!
l'll get everything together. -Come.

45
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,786
He's agreed, Nittillai.
He'll watch our play.

46
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,526
l know you'll come, too.
You had promised me.

47
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,796
Just a month ago you and l were
so happy.

48
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:45,321
My heart is swaying to the tune.
Of the songbird in the wood.

49
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,828
Clouds now gather in the sky...

50
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,503
The weather changes mood..

51
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:08,769
ln welcome of a waking dream,
l wait excited, eyes agleam.

52
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,233
Hear, my dear, the singing breeze.

53
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,551
Listen to the rustling leaves, my dear.

54
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:34,257
As we saunter hand in hand,
The love-note echoes through the land.

55
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:43,708
Romance has brought such melody,
My anklet bells respond in key.

56
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:50,649
ln welcome of a waking dream
l wait excited, eyes agleam.

57
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:48,997
Today l look at you a new
My body filled with raging thirst.

58
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,311
Your gaze is piercing
through and through.

59
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,316
l feel my heart's about to burst.

60
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:07,520
Your presence is like heady mead.
A tavern-full won't slake my need.

61
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,997
Never talk to tribals.
What's to worry about, Arvasu?

62
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,664
The village elders will ask
a few questions, you answer them.

63
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,742
After all, every young man getting
married does it. Just declare...

64
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:05,611
Sure, just say: l want to marry her
l'm potent, l can satisfy her needs.

65
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,377
Yes, more or less that.

66
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,683
And in public!

67
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,851
Obviously. What's the point
of saying it to yourself?

68
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,364
Don't worry, its nothing.

69
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:23,166
Might be nothing to the young men
of your tribe. But l'm a Brahmin.

70
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,969
To say all that in Public!
No chants to drown out one's voice.

71
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,701
No sacred smoke to hide one's face
How awful!

72
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,411
Will there be many people?

73
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,081
Only the whole village...
And people from the villages around.

74
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,951
Are your elders very brutal?

75
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,921
Of course not!
But the young men could be...

76
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:48,918
What young men?

77
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:55,995
Your friends, my brothers and the rest.
They love pulling the groom's leg.

78
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,261
l'm not coming.

79
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:58,962
Why?

80
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,303
Don't say that, Arvasu.
What if some evil spirit hears?

81
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:16,045
Father has told the young men not
to get carried away. He likes you.

82
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,885
But have you faced your people?
Have you told them about us yet?

83
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:28,025
You haven't? Why not?
Are you ashamed?

84
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,832
Ashamed? l'll show you who's ashamed.

85
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,201
You ruffian! Let me go!
What're you doing?

86
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,307
Don't l have any rights?-No.

87
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:43,247
The groom doesn't touch the bride
till the wedding. That's our custom.

88
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,852
l'm about to jettison my caste,
my family, all my traditions for you.

89
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,748
Can't you forget one small custom?

90
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,018
lt's a wise custom,
made by our elders.

91
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:59,830
All these days l kept away because
Brahmins don't touch other castes.

92
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,692
Now you won't touch me.

93
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:08,868
Are you sure someone won't think of
something else once we're married?

94
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:17,916
Listen... it's Andhaka baba
Let's go tell him our news

95
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:38,066
Go, slowly.
What's the hurry...wait...

96
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,536
Andhaka Baba is waiting for my cousin
since a long time lonely.

97
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,298
Why alone?

98
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,066
Now that he has returned.
Andhaka Baba must be happy.

99
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,346
He's not alone. We come every day
to be with him.

100
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,253
Wait.

101
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:07,932
Who's that?

102
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,603
Ah, ha! Arvasu!

103
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,274
May lightning strike your ears!

104
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:25,444
He thinks he's a great actor
But you're too smart to be fooled.

105
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,844
They all try, but l can always tell.

106
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:36,285
Just like you recognize a man by
his face, l can tell his footsteps.

107
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,725
l'll fool you yet!...Watch!

108
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,165
May God grant your wish
But in the meantime...

109
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:50,438
You two have cheered my heart
with your good news.

110
00:16:53,045 --> 00:17:01,817
The world doesn't like such mixing
of blood, it will treat you cruelly.

111
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,784
That's why he's only talked
to my family, not to his own.

112
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,594
One good thing about the famine...
-Don't say such horrid things.

113
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,494
l know. But the famine has
made all my people run away.

114
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,663
And they've taken their daughters.

115
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,705
So l'm free to marry whomever l want.

116
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,673
Actually, l was thinking...

117
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,945
Okay... trying to think.

118
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:36,646
l'm a fool, l know l'll never
be learned like Father or Uncle.

119
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:42,387
Can't be Chief Priest like Paravasu
nor do penance like cousin Yavakri.

120
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:48,859
All l want is to dance, sing,
act... and be with Nittillai.

121
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,697
lt won't matter a flake of cow dung
to my father if l'm alive or dead.

122
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,202
My sister-in-law Vishakha
lives in a world of her own.

123
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,875
That leaves only my brother.

124
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,277
Paravasu is a hard man
He won't be crossed.

125
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,548
Hard? Never to me.

126
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:12,619
To me, he's been a mother, father,
brother, nurse, teacher all in one.

127
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:20,061
He taught me to win at marbles,
to play tunes on bamboo pieces...

128
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,631
What if he forbids you now?

129
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,864
l'll tell him, l can't give up Nittillai
She's my life.

130
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,975
l can't live without her
l would rather be an outcaste.

131
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,640
Beautiful! Marvellous!
Such moving words.

132
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,077
But Paravasu is not one to be
easily moved, l warn you

133
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:46,084
l'm only waiting for the sacrifice
to end before speaking to him

134
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,451
And he's the Chief Priest.

135
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,218
l won't be good to disturb him
now with this matter.

136
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:58,068
But, he's sure to hear that you're
seeing Nittilai's tribal elders today.

137
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,264
l didn't expect her father to hold
the council so soon, nobody asked me

138
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,011
So Father's to blame? Do you know
why he's called the elders so soon?

139
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:15,752
He says, these high-caste men only
want to bed our women, not wed them.

140
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,548
All right!
Let's wed now, then we can...

141
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:29,431
Your cousin Yavakri will be so happy.
That's why, he wants to meet you.

142
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:36,671
Yes, he's asked me to meet him
exactly at noon... where is he?

143
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,646
Let me go, Yavakri.

144
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:25,920
You speak at last! l've waited
here 4 days to hear your voice.

145
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:31,862
Please, Vishakha. There's nobody
in your house, what's the hurry?

146
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,532
My father-in-law returns tomorrow
Say what you want to him.

147
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:39,864
l haven't waited so long to speak
with him. He doesn't care about me.

148
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,372
l can't stand here
chatting with a stranger.

149
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,936
A stranger! That's good!

150
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,204
l'm a married woman.
- l know.

151
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,873
lt was the first piece of news
l got upon my return.

152
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,314
That you had married Paravasu.
l was shaken.

153
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,218
But it was silly of me
not to have expected it.

154
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:09,796
10 years is a long time and
10 years of silence is longer still.

155
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,670
Can't we just talk?

156
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,900
10 years ago l swore that l wouldn't
ever look at another woman.

157
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,541
l have kept my word.
- That time is past now.

158
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,287
l don't regret it. But surely
l still have the right to say.

159
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:39,187
Put your pot down and talk
to me for a while, please...

160
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:46,966
Vishakha, after 10 years in solitude,
l am hungry for words.

161
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:53,476
They say you pleased lndra so much
he granted you Universal Knowledge.

162
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,478
l'm not worthy of exchanging
words with such a learned man.

163
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,087
Universal knowledge!
How good that sounds!

164
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,055
Now, it looks funny.

165
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,850
But, it's true, l did go looking
for some such grandiose thing.

166
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,629
You put it so simply in that
one sentence. So beautifully.

167
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:22,136
You go to the jungle to do penance.
You stand in a circle of fire.

168
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:27,137
Your austerities force the Gods to grant
your wish, and it's yours!

169
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:35,544
Universal Knowledge! Victory!
But it wasn't like that at all.

170
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:42,616
Leeches, beetles,
the relentless heat.

171
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,525
Not demons, but poisonous
snakes to terrorise me!

172
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,167
Life in the jungle is hell.

173
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,768
But you got what you wanted.

174
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:06,581
l don't know. When God appears,
you'd expect something earth-shaking.

175
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,948
A concrete experience. lndubitable.

176
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:18,289
l think lndra came to me several
times, but l was never certain.

177
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:31,133
l don't know how long l sat there
Another year, perhaps two...

178
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,442
He appeared again, another
trite exchange of words...

179
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,615
You can't master knowledge
through austerities, Yavakri.

180
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,279
But that's what l want.

181
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,658
An ocean is just drops of water,
the sun is made of rays of light.

182
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:55,061
But you want the entire ocean and
the whole sun, fully formed at once.

183
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,861
You're right, l want it all!
Universal Knowledge! Here, now!

184
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,738
Your obstinancy
reminds me of a story.

185
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,737
Once a man set out
riding his donkey.

186
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:16,684
Someone saw him and asked,
Where are you off to, my friend?

187
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:24,192
The man replied: l've lost my
donkey, l'm out looking for him.

188
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,930
You get my point, Yavakri?

189
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,796
But l won't give up.

190
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,936
That's your foolishness.

191
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,810
Then one day you returned.

192
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:51,454
Yes! One day l decided l had won.
So, l came back.

193
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,489
l can't quite remember why
l arrived at that conclusion.

194
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,219
l guess l learned something,
but l'm not really any wiser.

195
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,229
May be that understanding
itself is wisdom, right?

196
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:12,810
l've got a few tricks l didn't know
before. - Some magic, some mantras

197
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,108
You'll see for yourself soon.
- Me? No, thank you!

198
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:26,357
But the strangest part is, so much
inside me hasn't changed at all.

199
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:31,857
Do you remember, before leaving for
the jungle l came to say goodbye.

200
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,191
You led me to your garden,
opened the knot of your blouse...

201
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,105
...Pressed my face against your breasts,
then you turned and fled.

202
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:50,371
The air smelled of ripe mango,
and the jasmine in your hair.

203
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:59,824
10 years later, l know...
l'm still hungry for that fragrance.

204
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,188
For that same fragrance...

205
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,888
l don't believe it.

206
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:12,294
The world sings your praises,
but you still have teenage fantasies.

207
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,470
That time is past, Yavakri.

208
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:25,882
lndra may be immortal,
but my breasts hang loose now.

209
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:32,651
l was so afraid of meeting
you these last 4 days.

210
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:41,062
You looked so grand as you stood
there. Now l feel sorry for you.

211
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,930
So you'll stay?

212
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,970
The moment you said you were hungry
for words, l knew l couldn't leave.

213
00:26:53,545 --> 00:27:04,353
l know that hunger only too well
So l should have gone away silently.

214
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,821
Let's go Arvasu, its getting late.

215
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,596
Come!

216
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,433
Yes, l have to meet Yavakri too
before going to your village.

217
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,131
Why couldn't Yavakri meet him here?

218
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,403
We could go to my village from here.

219
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:33,644
He gets no peace here. There's a
stream of learned men visiting him.

220
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,747
You see? lt's no small matter.
Don't you joke about it.

221
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,251
She joked? What did she say?

222
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:46,294
l only said, whatever did Yavakri
spend 10 years in the jungle for?

223
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:53,370
He was seeking God. So he mortified
himself, fasted, meditated, prayed.

224
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,061
Did he tell you all this?

225
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,398
Stupid! Such a man would
never talk about himself!

226
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,646
Yavakri has attained knowledge not
from mortals but from lndra, direct.

227
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:09,814
And l have waited for the day my
Yavakri would come home triumphant.

228
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:16,654
But why are these Brahmins so
secretive about everything they do?

229
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,159
Oh God! She's in the mood
to argue again!

230
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:24,694
And if lndra himself appeared,
why didn't Yavakri ask for rain?

231
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,230
He's their rain god, isn't he?

232
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:35,806
You should see our parched village.

233
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:42,018
Every morning, my father gives
food to shriveled old people.

234
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:47,384
Women come with wailing babies
and shrunken, hungry children.

235
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,322
Father says, all the land needs is a
couple of good showers to revive.

236
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,528
Land will come alive again.
lt'll give us food.

237
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,201
That's what l'd have asked for.

238
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:07,903
But it's said such powers shouldn't
be used to solve everyday problems.

239
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,876
They're meant for inner knowledge
- Then what use is that power?

240
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:19,023
Ask Yavakri. He'll tell you
He's a good man.

241
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,081
l want to ask him just 2 questions.

242
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:27,396
Can he make it rain?
And does he know when he will die?

243
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,395
Hey, guess what animal this is!

244
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:36,832
l know, a bison!

245
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,804
Yes! A bison!

246
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:45,049
They say an actor shouldn't imitate,
he should embody the essence.

247
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:50,953
This means l have captured the
essence of a bison in my body.

248
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,920
You don't need to try.
You were born with it.

249
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,560
That's why the hunter-girls love me so!

250
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,596
Let's go!

251
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,593
Let's go.

252
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,469
Don't go yet, Vishakha

253
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,934
Have l gone? l'm still here.

254
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,847
You're a fool, Yavakri
and you talk like one.

255
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,115
Don't touch me!

256
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,518
You want to hit me? Go ahead.

257
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,591
lt isn't good to hurry so.

258
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,966
lt's not you l'm worried about,
it's this water.

259
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,835
You're hungry for words, so am l

260
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,405
Come, sit beside me

261
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:11,291
Yavakri, it's so good to call someone
a fool, to hold him close...

262
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:21,543
l live in a barren, wordless
hermitage, like a she-devil

263
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:30,653
You went away,
and l was married off...

264
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,442
You didn't want to marry me, l know

265
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:01,418
But don't worry. For one year
l will make you very happy

266
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:16,390
ln that year, he gave me such bliss
Paravasu's love filled all my world

267
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:39,918
Love has showered on us so#

268
00:32:50,368 --> 00:33:02,109
My whole being and yours as well.
Are saturated to their core.

269
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:14,883
As if into a sea of dreams,
My whole being and yours as well.

270
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:21,293
Dissolve like streams.

271
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,204
Love has showered on us so.

272
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:21,384
My eyes, lit up with inner fire
Speak of love and of desire.

273
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:45,273
l feel lighter than a flower,
Thirst of many lifetimes quenched.

274
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:58,891
All chains are shattered,
fists unclenched.

275
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:11,070
My whole being and yours as well,
Have broken from their prison cell.

276
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:51,878
Then, on the first day of the second
year of our marriage, he said to me.

277
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,612
Now we begin our quest

278
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:13,298
The moon's to be
your journey's fruit.

279
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:19,906
The path of love's the only route.

280
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:43,563
That path's the chosen one for me.
l leave behind all modesty.

281
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:50,235
Love spans the brook of modesty.

282
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:02,519
My whole being and yours as well.

283
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:09,357
Have crossed the bridge
and wander free.

284
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:17,195
Love has showered on us so.

285
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:27,443
Then one day he was invited to
become Chief Priest and he left.

286
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:38,081
The site of the sacrifice isn't far,
but in 7 years he's never come home.

287
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:48,965
Yavakri! l will give you knowledge
which even the gods cannot

288
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:59,070
Talking with you has freed
my heart and my body

289
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:15,416
lf we're late, the elders will be
angry. You can meet Yavakri later

290
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,993
l won't be long, Nittillai. You know
the bitterness between our families.

291
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,699
All right. But there's no one here

292
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:42,643
l can't see anyone. Let's go,
everyone's waiting in the village

293
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,122
Our water pot! Has sister-in-law
forgotten to take it back?

294
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,627
No one leaves a full pot of water
behind these days

295
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:57,560
That's true

296
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,645
They say there's a panther about
What if he's attacked...

297
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:21,450
No sign of a panther here, or
any other animal that big

298
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,418
She must be here somewhere
Should l go and look?

299
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:31,668
No need. l see it all very clearly
These footprints are hers for sure

300
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:39,274
And look, she's set the pot down
carefully without spilling a drop

301
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,502
And then...

302
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,516
Arvasu, is your brother back?

303
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,817
Paravasu? Of course not.
How can he leave the sacrifice?

304
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,286
Let's go, then
- But what about sister-in-law?

305
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,529
She's fine, let's go

306
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,858
Nittillai, l can't leave her behind
like this. Let me go see

307
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:49,743
l'll take this home

308
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,149
Some people put the
treacherous viper to shame

309
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:04,087
Aren't you the one who asked
Andhaka if l knew when l'd die?

310
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,625
How do you know that?

311
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,295
True, l don't know when l'll die

312
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:21,036
But l can tell you this.
You'll be dead within a month

313
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,176
Arvasu, l'm going home
-Nittillai! Wait for me

314
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,948
l'll see you at the cliff side cave

315
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:47,967
Where were you?

316
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,205
Fetching water

317
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,808
Father! l didn't know you were
returning home today

318
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,983
l didn't, either

319
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,220
But perhaps l should give the two
of you more such surprises

320
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:06,823
Wait!

321
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:15,159
She went to fetch water, and
you carry it back. Strange!

322
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:17,561
What's going on here?

323
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:24,231
And you look like a buffalo
that's been rolling in mud

324
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:31,174
How did you get so filthy?
- l became dizzy and fell down

325
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,711
And Arvasu turned up at that
very moment! How convenient!

326
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:40,251
Why did it take you two so long?
Who else was there?

327
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,122
Nittillai was there! The two
of us were together, father

328
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,057
But was she alone, or was
there someone with her, too?

329
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,697
No! No one

330
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:56,805
You thought of the savage girl fast
enough. But now you need a cue, eh?

331
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,475
Tell me, Who else was there?

332
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:05,208
Nobody! She was dizzy, she fell
so l helped her. Let me go...

333
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:10,149
Want to run away, do you?
Fine, but where will she go?

334
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,388
You wretch! Tell me who was there!

335
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,153
No...father...no...

336
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,054
l'll get the truth, even if l have
to kill her for it

337
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:25,395
Stop, father, please!
- l know what to do with this bitch

338
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,501
Let him go, Arvasu

339
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:34,400
Yes, somebody else was there
Yavakri! And he had come to see me

340
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,744
Whore! You two-bit whore!

341
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:44,084
l could reduce you to a
fistful of ashes with one curse

342
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,119
But no. Let that husband
of yours handle you

343
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,423
Paravasu, Chief Priest
of the Great Fire Sacrifice!

344
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,764
Let him clean up his own shit

345
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:06,667
Yavakri, you reptile!
So this is your 10 years' penance!

346
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:15,544
Now we confront each other -
You and me

347
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:21,485
No. -Arvasu! Bring me that water pot

348
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:27,157
No, please have mercy!
This is all Yavakri's...

349
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:34,961
No, no! lt's my fault!
Don't harm Yavakri, l beg you!

350
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:34,629
Vishakha, go and tell your lover
that l accept his challenge

351
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:41,769
l shall invoke the 'Kritya'... a spell
that will send a demon soul after him

352
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:50,772
lf he wants to live, let him hide
inside his father's hermitage

353
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:59,052
l won't desecrate my brother's
home with Yavakri's blood

354
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:07,656
lf he escapes and l'm defeated,
l'll give myself up to the fire

355
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,601
Arvasu, we must warn Yavakri

356
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,399
Go to your uncle's hermitage, tell
Andhaka not to let him out of there

357
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:26,413
But he's at the cliff side cave
- l'll go there, meanwhile you hurry

358
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,414
But l have to go to Nittillai's
village to meet the elders...

359
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:35,081
l've never asked anything of you
Do me this one favour, please go

360
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,929
Where have you been? -What?
-Everyone's waiting

361
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:40,824
Arvasu will be on the way.

362
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,024
Where's that boy Arvasu?

363
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:52,636
He's on his way, father
Please wait a little longer

364
00:46:52,976 --> 00:47:01,315
This council ends by sunset, and
you know what l think of Brahmins

365
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,623
Arvasu, haven't you gone
to the tribal council yet?

366
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,293
l'm on my way. ls Yavakri here?
- No, he isn't, but...

367
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,952
lf he comes, tell him not to
step out. His life's in danger

368
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,463
Don't move from here. Warn him
And don't let anyone else enter

369
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,795
Yes, but...
- l have to go

370
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,131
l'll check on sister-in-law,
then go to Nittillai's village

371
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,830
Village council are also waiting for me.
l'm going, Baba.

372
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,066
Listen...
- l have to go

373
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,356
You mustn't stay here, Yavakri
Go to your father's hermitage

374
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,297
l pray you to go.

375
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:11,536
My father-in-law knows everything.
Listen to me. He's sworn to destroy you. Go.

376
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,138
He's chanting the Kritya.

377
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:21,144
He is? l'm flattered

378
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:27,051
To invoke the 'Kritya' spell is
to engage one's full powers

379
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:34,589
lf you fail, you die. He honours me
by choosing this death for himself

380
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:42,669
You'll only be safe in your father's
hermitage. Please go there.

381
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:48,610
Don't be afraid Vishakha, l knew
he would do something like this.

382
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:56,083
You see this water? With it here,
the Death God himself can't touch me

383
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,514
But you don't need any of this!

384
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:04,023
Just go to your father's hermitage,
the demon can't kill you there

385
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:11,023
Once you're safe, l'll happily
watch that decrepit old man die

386
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,633
Vishakha, you've always
given me strength

387
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,042
My father was one of the most
learned men in the land

388
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:28,211
But he was neglected, while his
evil brother grabbed all the honours

389
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:33,883
This is no time for grievances
- Grievances! At least say 'hatred'

390
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:38,292
My father should have been
Chief Priest of the Sacrifice

391
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,064
But that honour too, went
to your husband Paravasu

392
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:48,329
Do we have to discuss this now?
- Every insult throbs in my veins

393
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,406
Now it's time to show the world
what my father's son is capable of

394
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,679
Where is that demon?
What's he waiting for?

395
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:04,080
Look, if anything happens to you
l'll never forgive myself

396
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,086
Go home, Yavakri. Please

397
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:12,022
Are you mad?
You want me to run away?

398
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:21,837
The fire of hatred drives me
And l won't let it be doused

399
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,166
l've challenged them
- Challenged?

400
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,843
Of course. You think it was chance?

401
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,842
Arvasu finding us there, your
father-in-law returning early...

402
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,287
l did it all
- Stop, Yavakri

403
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,380
l don't want to hear any more

404
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:52,792
lt's my fault. l should never have
let myself succumb to you

405
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:59,206
lt's good you yielded, or else
l'd have had to take you by force

406
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:00,810
Enough, Yavakri!

407
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,413
This is the moment l've
waited for all my life

408
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:12,144
Your father-in-law will die. Let's
see what your husband does then

409
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,322
Will he commit sacrilege?
Leave the altar to face me?

410
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:23,227
l'll squeeze Paravasu's balls so hard
he won't even be able to whimper

411
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:30,940
l'm sorry, Vishakha
l've always loved you

412
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,339
lt's not my fault
that you married Paravasu

413
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,182
Oh, God!

414
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,246
l was so happy this morning

415
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:55,023
You were so good, so warm

416
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,045
How life turns upside down, Yavakri

417
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,612
ln one instant

418
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,892
Where's that shadow puppet demon?
My sanctified water is waiting

419
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,727
Vishakha, what are you doing?

420
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,904
That water is my life!

421
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,734
Stop! The water!

422
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,077
All l need is a drop of water!

423
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,916
You devil! l trusted you

424
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,987
Get up! Men should not
aspire to be like the gods

425
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:03,994
Run, Yavakri. Now!

426
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,556
Who's that?

427
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,455
Stop, you can't come in
Who are you?

428
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:29,303
Yavakri! Child!
Why didn't l recognise your steps?

429
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:03,974
l knew Arvasu wouldn't come
He's humiliated me before everyone

430
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,509
That Brahmin did exactly
what l had expected him to do

431
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:20,118
l will marry this daughter of mine
to anyone who will take her

432
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:20,853
Father!

433
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:30,796
l'll marry Nittillai! And l promise
l'll keep her happy, very happy.

434
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:35,304
You can have her
Prepare for the wedding!

435
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,467
Arvasu! What took you so long?

436
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,541
But your father said l must
get here before sundown, so l...

437
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,043
The council is over
- What!

438
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,808
Nittillai is marrying someone else
You can't enter the village now

439
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:36,755
How many times should l tell you,
Nittillai's wedding is fixed. Go away

440
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:55,611
Arvasu, it's very late. Why are you
still hanging around? Go home

441
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:56,785
What's the use of going home?

442
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:03,684
Please ask your father to listen
to me. Just once, l beg you

443
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,223
The elders waited all day
You didn't come.

444
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,854
Yes, but l'm not to blame.
l was coming.

445
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,292
Sure, l've heard your story.
- But listen!

446
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,803
l saw Yavakri running. His life
was in danger. l ran after him...

447
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,301
You told me that already.

448
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:21,136
But he was lying in a pool of blood
l had to perform the funeral rites.

449
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:25,371
Yes, that might be.
- But l was here before sunset!

450
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:30,642
l know father was a bit hasty, but
nothing can change now. You must go.

451
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:36,052
l'll stay right here!
Let me meet Nittillai, just once...

452
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,386
Nittilai, Arvasu is
still sitting there.

453
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,589
Even now?
- Yes.

454
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,734
Ask him to go home, for my sake.

455
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,676
Nittillai wants you to leave, Arvasu,
for her sake. She can't meet you.

456
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,613
You don't know our father's wrath
Do you want him to kill Nittillai?

457
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,012
l just want to say...
- Go away, or else!

458
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,710
Nittillai wants you to leave,
for her sake.

459
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,549
Do you want him to kill Nittillai?

460
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:10,408
Open your soul
to the beat of the dhol.

461
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,651
Hear the drum-roll, and dance.

462
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:30,766
The pulsing beat, the tapping feet,
Come on, my sweet, and dance.

463
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:39,871
We cross the river,
and l, entranced.

464
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:48,923
Make a necklace for you of my arms.

465
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,616
Today l belong to you.

466
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,825
l'm a peahen to your peacock.

467
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:01,796
l'm a boat and you're the river.

468
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:46,675
My heart's a-tremor, steady me.

469
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:53,152
There's a net on my being,
like bark on a tree.

470
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:15,606
Come, make me free.
Teach this peahen how to dance.

471
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:19,713
Come to me!

472
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:52,243
May the golden sun shine,
And clouds pour nectar.

473
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:57,848
May your garden never be bare.

474
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:19,165
l'm a trembling deer
eyes wide with fright.

475
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:26,748
Unless we're together
through day and night.

476
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,432
l'm the lightning, you're the cloud.

477
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:48,101
You a buzzing bee,
l'm the flower proud.

478
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:52,472
Come to me.

479
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,061
Who's there?

480
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,000
lt's me, father, Paravasu

481
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,602
Paravasu? That's not possible

482
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,578
l seek your blessing, father
- What are you doing here?

483
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:49,687
This isn't right! There's a whole
month before the sacrifice ends!

484
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,694
l felt like coming home
- Felt? And you just walked out?

485
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:05,931
Maybe they threw you out, hearing of
your wife's escapade with Yavakri

486
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,169
The news is everywhere
But they haven't removed me

487
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:16,183
lf l get back before dawn,
no one will even know

488
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,043
No one will even know?

489
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:24,520
The Chief Priest sneaks out of the
Royal Sacrifice like a thief

490
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:32,727
And no one will know? The gods will
know, and they will take revenge

491
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,304
How could l have fathered
two such imbeciles?

492
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:42,971
l told the king: My no-good son
will shit on your sacrifice

493
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,307
His Majesty often says you
should have been the Chief Priest

494
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:51,646
But it was a 7-year rite,
they thought a younger man safer

495
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:58,987
Tell his #Majesty# this, 7 years
have passed, and l'm still alive

496
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,655
l shall live long enough
to cremate my own sons

497
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:12,500
The sight of my daughter-in-law's
luscious body keeps me in good shape

498
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:18,344
l want to speak with Vishakha
- You and your wife disgust me

499
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,677
l'm going out
- Alone?

500
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,188
lt's dangerous outside at night
Arvasu will go with you

501
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,450
The real danger isn't from
wild beasts, it's from humans

502
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:38,728
lf you want to be alone with
your wife, send that fool elsewhere

503
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,138
l bow to you, elder brother
-God bless you.

504
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,074
How are you?
- l'm all right

505
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,478
Hope l didn't disturb your sleep
- Not at all

506
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:06,892
Of course! Theatre-lovers like you
are quite used to late nights

507
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,422
There have been no plays for ages

508
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:18,236
But l say: Once my brother finishes
the sacrifice, everyone will return

509
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,307
Then you can show off your acting

510
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:31,853
Me? l haven't acted these 7 years,
since you forbade me

511
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,782
l told you not to act?

512
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:45,597
Long ago - before you went away,
you saw me dancing with a troupe

513
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,999
You said: lf you value your
Brahminhood, never step on stage

514
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,005
So l've given up the theatre

515
01:11:53,475 --> 01:12:00,005
You took a small remark so seriously
You shouldn't have obeyed me

516
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,342
l could never disobey you
- Then you should have asked again

517
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,280
But you'd have given the same reply

518
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:15,123
True. But if you repeat the same
question and answer over and over

519
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:20,397
Eventually you create a new universe
of meanings, more acceptable to you

520
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:29,242
l'll be on the blackberry hill
Call if you need me

521
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:44,723
How are you?

522
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:52,156
l get news of you sometimes
l suppose you're well?

523
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:59,864
Or do you still drive yourself
to madness like a demon?

524
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:07,509
l was sure you wouldn't come,
even if l was on my deathbed

525
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,953
But my disrepute was enough
to bring you running here

526
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,750
Yavakri and you!
How alike you both are

527
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:26,027
You both left when it suited you lndra!
As if he's the ultimate end

528
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:33,971
Will you come back
once the sacrifice is over?

529
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:39,877
No! l suppose that would be too human

530
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:45,781
But what's wrong with being human?
Wanting to be happy together...

531
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,123
Like you and l were

532
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:58,259
Your lndra has looted my happiness

533
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:06,333
l know, l should be silent

534
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:13,070
My silence, then your silence!
l'm sick of these silences!

535
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,762
Do me a favour before you go

536
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,439
l submit to you as a devoted wife

537
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:45,511
You want me to shoot you?

538
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,113
At last you ask a question!

539
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,620
l'll tell you why

540
01:14:54,990 --> 01:15:00,951
There's 3 of us in this house
Arvasu lives in his own world

541
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:03,726
And your father...

542
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:10,464
Since you became Chief Priest,
he's been wracked by two emotions

543
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,465
A sense of humiliation, and lust!

544
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:26,212
An old man's twisted lust!
And whom can he vent it on? Me!

545
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,662
At least for that moment
Yavakri made me forget...

546
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:46,337
Listen, he's coming back!
Kill me now!

547
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:51,672
Murder's the one experiment you haven't
tried. Maybe that's your way to lndra

548
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:57,580
You're still right.
And you have a lot to teach me

549
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,115
You're still my Guru.

550
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,538
What have you done?

551
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,546
Now you'll never know
if what l said was true

552
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:31,709
You didn't need to say a word
Father had to die

553
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,715
He only killed Yavakri to disturb my
concentration as the sacrifice ends

554
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:42,224
l had to stop him
before he went any further.

555
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:50,227
ls that what you came for?
No, there's something else

556
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,309
Your sinews are twisted like ropes
Tell me. What's bothering you?

557
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:06,115
l don't know. l couldn't sit
at the altar... l came home

558
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,657
We must perform father's funeral

559
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:40,785
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
lt's father! What happened to him?

560
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,147
l mistook him for a wild animal

561
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:50,963
How can that be? Do something!
Look, his eyelids are still moving...

562
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:55,125
Quiet!
There's no time to howl

563
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,030
l have to return to the sacrifice
before anyone finds out

564
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:03,235
But there's blood on your hands

565
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,811
That has to be washed. These same
hands must complete the sacrifice

566
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:17,819
l must atone for father's death, but
you'll have to do it instead, Arvasu

567
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:29,270
Don't do it, Arvasu. He killed
his father, let him atone for it

568
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:36,504
Don't you get involved
- But he must finish the sacrifice

569
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,412
Damn the sacrifice!

570
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,519
There's been enough bloodshed
You live your own life

571
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:58,628
Perform the rites carefully, Arvasu
Every detail has to be right

572
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:06,272
Bless me, brother.
-God bless you.

573
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,311
lt's the demon himself!

574
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:51,478
How did you recognise me?
- Where else could you go?

575
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,822
Help me, please

576
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,589
l don't help anyone

577
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:02,354
l beg you. You're my only hope

578
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:04,995
Hope of what?

579
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,492
Of salvation!
Release from this cursed existence

580
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:14,475
Your father gave me a new life
That makes us brothers, right?

581
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,938
l don't need more brothers
One is enough

582
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:24,280
But you have no choice

583
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:32,186
l was locked in nothingness. Your
father plucked me out to kill Yavakri

584
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,794
l didn't want to,
but l did his bidding

585
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:42,136
l hoped to get salvation
along with this new life

586
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:44,198
You should've asked
my father for salvation

587
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,167
Yes, l would have

588
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:54,014
But you killed him before
he could honour his promise

589
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:58,081
Now you have to do his job

590
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:03,724
My brother, l want Salvation
.....Deliverance.

591
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,857
Yavakri wanted Universal Knowledge,
you ask for the final release

592
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,393
People's demands are escalating

593
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:20,402
l'm not interested in your salvation.
l know my duties. Begone!

594
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:27,241
Be warned, no unnatural spirit
can enter the sacred enclosure

595
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,715
Remember, Paravasu

596
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:41,391
lt's not so easy to get
rid of a brother... brother!

597
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:15,480
What happened?

598
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:21,655
Arvasu is here
l'd like to say goodbye. May l?

599
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,328
Go. But come back soon.-Yes.

600
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:42,809
What have you done to yourself?

601
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,979
l've just finished
my father's last rites

602
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,783
Your father! Oh, God!

603
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:53,825
And Andhaka baba too...

604
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,565
Our whole world
is collapsing, Nittillai

605
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,131
What should l do?

606
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:10,811
Be brave. You still have your
brother, your sister-in-law...

607
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,379
Sister-in-law has gone...
l don't know where

608
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:24,054
Go to the city,
to your brother Paravasu

609
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,619
They feed Brahmins at the
sacrifice, don't they?

610
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:31,732
Once it's over, you can come back
with Paravasu

611
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:36,262
You're right

612
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:40,539
l have to go now

613
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:06,099
Be happy

614
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:27,147
You!

615
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:33,848
Who, me?
- Yes you! Who are you?

616
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,046
l'm your...

617
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:39,483
l'm the son of sage Raibhya

618
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:46,159
My father is dead. l've completed
his last rites, and the expiation.

619
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:47,260
Why the expiation?

620
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:51,835
Because... he was killed

621
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:54,133
At whose hands?

622
01:26:57,712 --> 01:27:00,044
At the hands of his son

623
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:03,715
He has killed his father!
He's a sinner

624
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:08,651
He's not a Brahmin, he's a demon
Remove him from this sacred place

625
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:15,193
Brother! What's this? What have l done?
Leave me, what're you doing?

626
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:19,021
What sin have l committed?
Why are you doing this? Let me go!

627
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,528
Brother! Why?
Why're you doing this?

628
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:31,202
As a sacrifice nears completion,
demons come to disrupt it

629
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:35,876
We must identify them and
we must be on our guard

630
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:52,393
Brother! Why're you doing like this?

631
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:22,780
What's the matter, Siddhi?
Why are you crying?

632
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:29,591
lts Arvasu! Paravasu's guards
have beaten him almost to death

633
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:35,429
Paravasu? But how is that possible?
What has he done?

634
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:36,731
Where is Arvasu?

635
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:40,304
l was outside the poorhouse,
l saw them throw him in there

636
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,639
l must go to him!

637
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:48,041
lf you go, the tribe will hunt and
kill you. Where's your husband?

638
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:57,889
He's out with his friends,But l can't
wait, l must go save Arvasu at any cost.

639
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:03,986
lt's all my fault, Siddhi
l sent Arvasu to his brother

640
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,568
l'm leaving
- Take care, Nittillai

641
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,230
No....no...

642
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:54,331
Nittillai, we heard what happened
Don't be afraid, come with us...-Come.

643
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:05,686
Hey, give me a hand!
-Everything will be alright. -Get up.

644
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:11,817
Slowly...-Hold this...-Carry him.

645
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:13,961
Carefully....

646
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:21,492
Carefully....

647
01:32:51,732 --> 01:33:02,370
Your sorrow's embers smoulder still,
Your mind is tense, your body ill

648
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:20,222
The cruel world has wounded you

649
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:38,976
You're lost before the burning sun
But now we're two where you were one

650
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:52,018
l'll give you shade and solace too

651
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:33,997
How is he now?
- Much better. He'll recover

652
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:38,998
l worry for Nittilai
She won't leave his side

653
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:50,180
The touch of love is like a balm
That turns a tortured person calm

654
01:34:50,785 --> 01:35:01,320
lt softly douses sorrow's flame
Or cools it down and makes it tame

655
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:12,630
Each moment while you were alone
Was like a sip of bitter brew

656
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:23,708
But now we're two where you were one
l'll give you shade and solace too

657
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:32,625
Looks like l've found my new actor

658
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,552
You and your play!

659
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:41,699
l fear for them. Two different castes,
how will they manage?

660
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:45,937
Anything's possible during a
famine, but what a girl she is...

661
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:49,102
l wish her well

662
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:16,096
Don't ever leave me

663
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:22,640
l won't, l promise

664
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:37,153
Eat something

665
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,289
You look so beautiful

666
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:48,093
All these patterns on your face
Like a bride!

667
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:52,263
lt's days since you ate anything

668
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,040
But how come you're here?

669
01:36:58,979 --> 01:36:59,741
l've run away

670
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:03,472
From your husband?

671
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,286
Yes

672
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:12,516
Why? Didn't you like him?

673
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:19,529
He was very nice, always smiling

674
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,531
l could have been happy with him

675
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:36,443
But l heard what they did to you,
l couldn't bear it. l came running

676
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:42,588
Yes! Paravasu!
Why did he do that to me?

677
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:46,190
lt's all right. Eat...
- Soldiers pounced on me

678
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:51,324
Tore off my sacred thread
l kept screaming: Brother! Why?

679
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:54,365
Quiet now, you'll wake the children

680
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:04,170
Did he think l had married you?
That l had become a low-caste actor?

681
01:38:05,746 --> 01:38:11,309
No, l clearly remember, he said,
Out! Demon! Throw him out!

682
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:14,179
Hush now

683
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:27,056
l worshipped my brother
and he betrayed me

684
01:38:30,871 --> 01:38:33,499
l let you down, but you've
risked everything for my sake

685
01:38:39,146 --> 01:38:40,408
lt must be days since you left home

686
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:45,046
Don't you know your tribes
They must be hunting for you

687
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:51,617
l was waiting for you to wake
l thought once you're stronger...

688
01:38:56,063 --> 01:39:04,129
Nittillai, l think l'll
try to see my brother again

689
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,165
l want to know why he did that to me

690
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,004
And after you know?

691
01:39:11,378 --> 01:39:17,806
l want revenge! From all of them!
lt's a conspiracy, now l get it.

692
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,655
lt's because l wanted to
marry you and reject my caste.

693
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:26,656
First Yavakri dies... then Father...
Andhaka... corpses drenched in blood!

694
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:30,997
But Paravasu is alive
He's the one behind it all

695
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:33,561
You're talking nonsense!
- You don't know a thing!

696
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:37,760
Tribals do small-time witchcraft
But Brahmins!

697
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:41,597
They can tear apart the earth's
bowels to call forth awful demons

698
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:47,205
lf such an evil man is Chief Priest
it will rain blood in the end!

699
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,783
But you're doing the same thing!

700
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:56,615
All the rest of them wanted revenge
Now you want the same thing

701
01:39:57,524 --> 01:40:02,393
Leave it to their gods now
- Should l sit here like a coward?

702
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:05,794
Better that than becoming like them

703
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:11,131
l'm already a murderer to the world

704
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:15,204
Kick that world aside!
You're my Arvasu, that's enough

705
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,343
All right, go to Paravasu

706
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:30,188
l don't want you to think
l made you run away like a coward

707
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:37,922
Am l going mad?

708
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:02,048
Get some rest now

709
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:18,930
What was that?
Nothing serious, l hope

710
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:22,402
He just woke up...
We were talking, that's all

711
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:26,139
Fine, you get some sleep, child.
How long will you stay awake? Sleep.

712
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,218
Dry it in sun.

713
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:40,790
Done? Have you added the herbs?
- Yes, let him eat it hot

714
01:41:41,228 --> 01:41:47,224
Don't give him too much
Let him go easy for now

715
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:49,334
He's on empty stomach.
He shouldn't drink much.

716
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:52,429
Leave it.

717
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:55,337
Our patient looks better today

718
01:41:56,477 --> 01:42:00,277
Yes, all thanks to you
- Not me, it's all Nittillai's magic

719
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,879
We're lucky you came looking for us

720
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:16,251
l am lucky, you are plucky
You are lucky, l am plucky...Sleep...sleep.

721
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:25,770
Those who're lucky needn't be plucky

722
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:29,101
And those who are plucky,
needn't be lucky!

723
01:42:30,244 --> 01:42:33,771
Now you've found your actor friends,
sing and dance as much as you want

724
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:38,615
l'll go and find something
to eat, then we'll be off

725
01:42:39,853 --> 01:42:41,343
l'll be right back...l'll come back.

726
01:42:41,855 --> 01:42:43,823
What's the hurry, wait!
Get fruits on the way.

727
01:42:46,193 --> 01:42:48,627
She's a good girl
Don't ever hurt her

728
01:42:51,265 --> 01:42:57,135
l'll never hurt her. Soon we'll
leave this town. What will you do?

729
01:42:58,872 --> 01:43:06,802
We came to perform a play for the
sacrifice. But this town's unlucky

730
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:12,083
l had an actor, he took our donkey
and vanished in the jungle one day

731
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:14,648
l think we'll leave with you

732
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:17,521
l can act in your play

733
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:22,458
Silly boy, you're no actor
You're a high-caste Brahmin

734
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:25,494
l'm not a Brahmin! Watch me

735
01:43:25,832 --> 01:43:26,491
Watch me.

736
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:37,796
Enough Arvasu, you'll tire yourself

737
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:46,245
What happened?

738
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:47,747
What happened?

739
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:49,642
l saw them!- Who?

740
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:53,919
My brother and my husband

741
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:56,180
They're here! What shall we do now?

742
01:44:56,456 --> 01:45:00,085
Don't worry, l'm a master of disguise

743
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:02,595
l'll change you so completely,
you'll be invisible

744
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:06,095
Hunters don't need to see
their quarry, they can smell it

745
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:07,324
One thing is for sure.

746
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:14,498
You must stay here
where they can see you

747
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:20,105
lf they think l'm still here,
l'll get a chance to escape

748
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,942
Escape?
- But where will you go?

749
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:26,278
l'll hide in the jungle

750
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:30,820
ln jungle alone! Lonely!
l won't let you go alone

751
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:38,461
Do you want them to hunt me down
and kill me like an animal?

752
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:45,628
l'm scared, Arvasu
l don't want to die yet

753
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:51,140
Don't cry. Go if you must
But what should l do?

754
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:59,645
Why do you keep asking me?
Why don't you decide, for once?

755
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:00,912
But... l was just...

756
01:46:01,121 --> 01:46:02,019
Act in my show!

757
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:07,926
l just watched him
He dances like a celestial being

758
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:11,258
With him, l could stage a play
truly worthy of the sacrifice

759
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:17,501
Arvasu, you must stay here
to save Nittillai, right? -Yes

760
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:22,164
This is the best way. l even have a
play ready, The Triumph of Lord lndra

761
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:26,334
lt's about the battle between
Lord lndra and the demon Vritra

762
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:30,846
l bet Arvasu will play Vritra!
All that thumping and roaring...

763
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:34,349
l never know whether you're
going to laugh or cry next

764
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:38,020
He'll have to be the demon,
because l will be lndra!

765
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,854
Wait, l'll get the masks

766
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,430
But Paravasu will never agree
- He will

767
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,034
l know how to make him
l've explained it to the actor

768
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:55,230
Then what holds you back?

769
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:03,042
You've always wanted to act
- l'm afraid, Nittillai

770
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:05,714
Afraid of Paravasu?

771
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:12,123
Face your brother, Arvasu
Not with hate, but with your talent

772
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,887
The play will wash away your anger

773
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:20,397
Nittillai, can't you come
and watch me act?

774
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:25,727
l wish l could
But it will be dangerous

775
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:28,263
l wish you could...

776
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:38,009
Concentrate on your rehearsals.
l'm sure your dance will bring the rain

777
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:41,921
And then l promise l'll be there

778
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:51,928
Here is the mask of Vritra
The demon's face

779
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:59,503
Pray to it, become one with it. But
don't let it get control over you

780
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:03,605
l'll go give Paravasu your message

781
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:09,945
l trust you won't stop me now

782
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:13,950
Let's have the play
We shall all watch

783
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:44,039
You? But Arvasu said...

784
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:46,041
Why did you come you here?

785
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:49,875
l had to see Arvasu
What will happen now?

786
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:52,445
You stay here

787
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:56,915
Hide behind me

788
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:32,251
l am lndra

789
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:35,488
King of all the Gods

790
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:41,765
Then why am l not supreme
in all the three worlds?

791
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:52,177
Alas, my father Brahma
fell in love with a mortal woman

792
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:56,107
And so was born
my brother, Vishwa

793
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:08,518
He is the King of Men

794
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:14,528
All the world praises
his wisdom and goodness

795
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:17,132
Everyone loves him

796
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:23,401
So much so, that it's a threat
to my power over the world

797
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:28,413
l must destroy him! But how?

798
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:36,547
For my father also mated with a
woman from the nether world

799
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:39,992
And produced Vritra!

800
01:52:01,047 --> 01:52:06,246
He told Vritra
Protect your brother Vishwa

801
01:52:07,053 --> 01:52:12,184
Guard him, even if it
costs your life

802
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:15,194
Because lndra...That's me

803
01:52:15,895 --> 01:52:23,700
lndra will try and kill him
Now these two are inseparable

804
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:59,633
l tempted them with celestial beauties
but they didn't fall for it

805
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:04,577
Oh, what shall l do?

806
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:12,244
Aha! l shall hold a fire sacrifice
in honour of our father Brahma

807
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:16,911
And invite Vishwa to participate

808
01:53:21,127 --> 01:53:23,254
l bow to you, elder brother

809
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:30,331
Vishwa, l'm holding a
sacrifice in honour of Brahma

810
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:35,096
You must attend
- lndeed l shall, elder brother

811
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:42,877
Vishwa, you may enter,
but Vritra cannot

812
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:48,019
He's a demon, he can't
enter this sacred space

813
01:53:49,322 --> 01:53:58,287
But he is Brahma's son too
Surely our brother is a Brahmin

814
01:53:58,498 --> 01:54:03,800
No! His mother was a demoness
Demon blood flows in his veins

815
01:54:04,337 --> 01:54:10,242
He can't come in. -Okay.
Whatever you say, brother

816
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:13,813
Vritra, wait outside

817
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:18,249
Brother, l was born to protect you

818
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:23,383
Take me with you
lndra is a treacherous villain

819
01:54:25,525 --> 01:54:28,824
They say: Never trust the gods!

820
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:35,258
l cannot disobey our elder brother
l must go alone

821
01:54:39,038 --> 01:54:40,062
As you wish

822
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:18,970
Brother, why? l trusted you

823
01:55:30,023 --> 01:55:31,490
No! This is all wrong

824
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:38,553
l didn't mean to hurt him. l was afraid..
l had to complete the sacrifice.

825
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:43,562
l saw a face emerge from the flames
Was it mine, or Arvasu's?

826
01:55:43,937 --> 01:55:48,670
l don't know what happened
l heard myself ask, Who are you?

827
01:55:53,112 --> 01:55:55,740
A river of blood flowing
from the sacrificial altar!

828
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:00,476
More treachery! Another murder!

829
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,480
lndra! You can't escape me

830
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:09,588
l'll grind your sinful
sacrifice into the dust

831
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:34,783
Hey, not there!

832
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:44,020
Someone stop him, for God's sake

833
01:56:46,666 --> 01:56:47,894
Do something, Chief Priest

834
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:54,371
l'm a Brahmin. Whoever kills me
will be cursed with damnation

835
01:56:57,176 --> 01:56:57,642
Get lost.

836
01:56:58,177 --> 01:57:03,809
l'm a demon, too. l'll destroy
anyone who comes near me

837
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,821
The mask has come alive!

838
01:57:18,197 --> 01:57:19,824
Stop him!

839
01:58:13,219 --> 01:58:14,743
Paravasu, only you can
tell us what to do

840
01:58:16,422 --> 01:58:20,654
Forgive me, your Majesty
This is all my fault

841
01:59:42,508 --> 01:59:43,975
Nittillai, come back.

842
01:59:53,686 --> 01:59:54,584
Get away from here.

843
01:59:59,025 --> 02:00:02,825
l don't know what came over me
He sat there unafraid, while l...

844
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,496
Let's get out of here

845
02:00:08,534 --> 02:00:09,228
Let her go!

846
02:00:11,304 --> 02:00:12,464
Let her go.

847
02:00:12,805 --> 02:00:13,396
Leave me....

848
02:00:33,392 --> 02:00:37,192
This is all my fault

849
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:44,699
Forgive me, Nittillai

850
02:01:11,597 --> 02:01:19,060
The fire didn't take me alone,
perhaps it will accept us together

851
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:33,748
Arvasu, son!

852
02:01:35,221 --> 02:01:36,347
Do not grieve so

853
02:01:38,057 --> 02:01:44,621
The gods are pleased with you
Ask any boon, it shall be granted

854
02:01:46,065 --> 02:01:46,759
Who are you?

855
02:01:52,405 --> 02:01:54,532
You question the gods?

856
02:01:58,244 --> 02:02:01,213
l am lndra

857
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:05,550
We admired your performance

858
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:13,285
As much as we admired Paravasu's
sacrifice and Nittillai's humanity

859
02:02:14,493 --> 02:02:19,863
You humans can interpret the
actions of the gods as you please

860
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:29,469
But the fact is, we are here and
You can ask for anything you want

861
02:02:30,009 --> 02:02:33,638
Rain... Arvasu, rain!

862
02:02:33,846 --> 02:02:35,074
l want Nittillai back

863
02:02:37,016 --> 02:02:44,149
l killed my sweet, gentle Nittillai
Please give her back to me

864
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:48,657
Arvasu, it is no great matter
to bring Nittillai back to life

865
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:55,766
But once the Wheel of Time rolls back

866
02:02:57,870 --> 02:02:59,997
No one knows where it will stop.

867
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:03,034
Besides...

868
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:12,341
All those who were alive before
will return to life

869
02:03:14,387 --> 02:03:15,911
Your father Raibhya,

870
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:20,791
Paravasu, Yavakri...

871
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:24,196
Fine! Let the world be as it was

872
02:03:24,397 --> 02:03:32,031
But then, won't the whole
tragedy repeat itself?

873
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:41,739
Everyone will have to endure
the same suffering all over again

874
02:03:42,415 --> 02:03:50,720
Lord, l have been an ignorant fool
My stupidity has caused all this

875
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:56,823
But l'm wiser now
l'll stop it from happening again

876
02:03:57,096 --> 02:04:01,055
You really believe that?
- Yes

877
02:04:01,767 --> 02:04:04,031
All right, then...

878
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,305
Arvasu! Save me!

879
02:04:09,775 --> 02:04:10,241
Who's that?

880
02:04:12,778 --> 02:04:15,110
Me, your brother Rakshasa...
the demon

881
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:20,241
Your father invoked me
to kill Yavakri

882
02:04:21,454 --> 02:04:25,652
l did my duty, but l'm still
suspended between life and death

883
02:04:27,126 --> 02:04:27,922
What do you want?

884
02:04:28,794 --> 02:04:31,262
Salvation!
Release from this bondage

885
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:37,599
You must ask lndra for my release
l can't bear the torment

886
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:41,769
Please help me, Arvasu.
Release from the bondage.

887
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:49,608
Did you hear that Lord lndra?
Could you grant him release?

888
02:04:49,982 --> 02:04:55,943
Arvasu, if you want Nittillai to live
the Wheel of Time must roll back

889
02:04:58,157 --> 02:05:06,690
But it must roll forward if you
want the demon to get his release

890
02:05:07,466 --> 02:05:12,802
You must choose now whether
it rolls forward or backward

891
02:05:13,572 --> 02:05:15,972
You heard that, demon?
There's nothing l can do. -Yes.

892
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:20,909
And when Nittillai comes back,
what will you tell her?

893
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:25,980
Will you say, a wretched soul is
in eternal agony for her sake?

894
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:33,891
Nittillai always helped you
She'd have helped me, too

895
02:05:37,696 --> 02:05:43,157
She cared for other people, and
would have accepted me as a brother

896
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:54,202
You think she would want my soul
to be damned, so she can live?

897
02:05:55,848 --> 02:06:00,615
lf she's reborn, every moment of
her life my screams will torture her

898
02:06:02,488 --> 02:06:07,858
lndra's boon will become a
curse for Nittillai.

899
02:06:13,799 --> 02:06:19,032
Lord, grant this demon his release

900
02:06:19,638 --> 02:06:20,570
You're sure you want that?

901
02:06:23,075 --> 02:06:24,599
Nittillai would have wanted it so

902
02:06:27,079 --> 02:06:28,273
Then, so be it!

903
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:55,568
Look, Nittillai. lts raining
Just like you said it would...
