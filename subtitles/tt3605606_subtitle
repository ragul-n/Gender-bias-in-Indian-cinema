1
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,082
'Adityapuram Palace
41 years ago'

2
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,082
- Vasudeva...?
- Coming

3
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,906
- Vasudeva...?
- Coming

4
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,121
Vasudeva

5
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:53,912
Yes, father?

6
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,894
They are about to
open the treasury

7
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,887
My brother Mahendra Varma and
his son Shekara Varma are opening it

8
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,891
All that wealth was hoarded
and guarded by my father

9
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:10,864
While my father's brother and his sons
chewed betel leaves and played chess...

10
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,900
now they want to claim
equal share in the wealth

11
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,903
- Should I allow that?
- No, don't, father

12
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,884
Then come with me

13
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,910
Srikrishna, let's go

14
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,948
Father, he's just a kid

15
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,918
I was only 13 when
my hands held a weapon

16
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,920
He's younger only
by a year, that's all

17
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,899
Come along

18
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,915
Don't be scared

19
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,896
Ravindra, let's not clash

20
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,399
I'm only following what your father,

21
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,924
my brother, instructed me
before he died

22
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,961
Equal rights to the wealth
inside this treasury

23
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,908
Absolutely not

24
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,933
The entire treasure belong
only to me and my children

25
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,935
Thank you for opening the coffers

26
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:57,914
Come, my children

27
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,972
Stop, Ravindra
Don't be autocratic

28
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,940
Mahendra, get out of my way

29
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:02,975
Ravindra!

30
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,943
Move

31
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,924
I said get away

32
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,914
Move aside

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,917
I won't, not even
if I have to die

34
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,896
Move!

35
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,910
My son...!

36
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,936
What happened, my child?

37
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,942
Father

38
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,947
My dearest child!
What happened?

39
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,934
Oh dear Goddess!

40
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,927
'Following this revolution
in the palace...'

41
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:00,928
'...discussions were held between
Govt. officials and the royal family'

42
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,936
'The palace astrologer
conducted a divine query'

43
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,939
'It was deciphered the blood
spilt within the treasury...'

44
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,940
'...had evoked the wrath of the Goddess
which caused the crystal to burst'

45
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:18,946
'After 7 days of redemptive rituals
and appeasement to the deity...'

46
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,954
'...it was decided to lock and
seal the treasury for 41 years'

47
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:27,955
'After 41 years, it will be shared
equally among 4 legal heirs'

48
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,903
'In the presence of
mediators and witnesses...'

49
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,939
'...the heirs signed
the legal documents'

50
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,940
'Mahendra Varma's sons
Shekara Varma and Rajashekara Varma'

51
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:50,945
'Ravindra Varma's sons
Vasudeva Varma and Srikrishna Varma'

52
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,922
'...were named the future heirs
in the legal document'

53
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,391
'The doors were locked with 4 padlocks

54
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,960
and keys handed over
to the future heirs'

55
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:06,198
'Royal palace came under
the governance of the family trust'

56
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,939
'Royal palace came under
the governance of the family trust'

57
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,926
'Mr Fraud'

58
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,965
Nothing like that

59
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,989
Just a sec

60
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,968
Maria...?

61
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:46,993
Excuse me

62
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:48,994
Yes, sir

63
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:49,995
- Maria
- Yeah...?

64
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,998
No one has heard about
the singer you've arranged

65
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,000
She's my only daughter

66
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,003
And I'm spending
millions on this wedding

67
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,950
Couldn't you have finalized...

68
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:04,009
Sonu Nigam or Shreya Ghosal
for this pre-nuptial bash?

69
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,978
Instead this unknown bloke
What was his name?

70
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,960
Some random John Cliff

71
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,986
Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal
are undoubtedly great singers, sir

72
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,990
But they are too familiar for the crowd
That's why I finalized John Cliff

73
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,962
And you know what?
He's a pure Malayali

74
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:01,996
He left for Jamaica when he was 20
totally hooked on to Bob Marley's songs

75
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,972
Globe-trotter and
a Vagabond musician

76
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,014
Now he's back in
India after 30 years

77
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,017
This is his 1st program
for our sake after his return

78
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,018
Trust me, sir

79
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,999
John Cliff is going
to rock the night

80
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,992
A fusion of reggae and Indian music
That too with Malayalam lyrics

81
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,973
That's what he has promised

82
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,998
Let it be whatever fusion
but not end up in confusion!

83
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,980
- You take care of everything
- Okay sir, will do

84
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,974
My daughter's father-in-law
may be a billionaire NRI

85
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,010
But he remains in his heart
a common villager

86
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:49,014
He hinted we give him today
the promised 1 billion in cash

87
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,018
Take the cash bundles
Leave it in our suite

88
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,990
Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention please?

89
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,026
Let's welcome on stage
the great vagabond musician

90
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,028
John Cliff

91
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,030
His first ever 'live'
performance in India

92
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,977
You guys have a rocking time

93
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,570
Hey! Come
Let's see

94
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:45,005
"Beautiful moonlight
as you sparkled bright"

95
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:51,989
"Clouds amidst
in my heart a tryst"

96
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:59,987
"Moon's rays of radiance
as you flash a glance"

97
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:08,996
"Branches of silence
in my soul as essence"

98
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:30,984
"Tinted moonlight
Touch me and take flight"

99
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,030
- Hey you look pretty
- Thank you so much

100
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,031
Great couple

101
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:52,032
"As time rides its chariot over
in enameled fields in summer"

102
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,039
"Even now I move on
burning with pain forlorn"

103
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,848
"This heartbeat is just a second long

104
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:08,052
Realizing my life on earth
is a love song"

105
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:13,053
"My desires attest
Sweet it is to forget"

106
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,006
"Forever without end"

107
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,050
"Shimmering moonlight
Dazzling desirous delight"

108
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:52,009
"Clouds vapory
in my heart's treasury"

109
00:13:53,032 --> 00:14:01,042
"On the shores when a tempest
is on the warpath of unrest"

110
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:08,014
"I shall rush ahead; no delays
like a rain laden wind always"

111
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,449
"To relieve my burden; in proximity

112
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,054
Singing my love's verses of
immortality"

113
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:24,031
"Like a poem written but erased
my life remains a secret encased"

114
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:52,024
"Moon's rays of radiance
in the blaze of your glance"

115
00:14:53,058 --> 00:15:00,033
"Branches of silence
in my soul as essence"

116
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:24,023
"Tinted moonlight
Touch me and take flight"

117
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,077
Welcome Bhai ji

118
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,078
Can I get you a drink?

119
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,059
- No
- Please

120
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,086
Bhai ji, everything went smooth
just as you planned

121
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,088
Tom Kurien did not file a case

122
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,124
Dowry is a criminal offence

123
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,092
No source for the cash

124
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,073
And scandal hushed up

125
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:14,098
Maria...?
She is in deep trouble

126
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,101
He thinks she is the kingpin
behind this robbery

127
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,104
So her chapter is closed

128
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:24,075
Beyond a few multimedia presentations
and 14 YouTube links, being ignorant...

129
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,078
about the history of
John Cliff is Maria's mistake

130
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,059
Let her pay for it

131
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,053
Javed, 100 million
Your share is in this bag

132
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,067
Thank you, Bhai ji

133
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:42,093
You are the only one to pay
so promptly just for information

134
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:46,065
Are you feeling guilty
for accepting 'gawking wages'?

135
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,101
It's alright
There are different meanings

136
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:54,105
One of it is to be paid
for being a mere spectator

137
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:58,109
But I did something
without your permission

138
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,113
Don't be angry with me
It's a great opportunity

139
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,060
And like nothing
we've ever done before

140
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,085
That's how huge it is
And I couldn't resist the bait

141
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,066
Shall I ask him in?

142
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,867
Bhai ji, this is-

143
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,893
Hi I am Nikhil Atharva

144
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,875
But you can call me Niki

145
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,902
You can call me anything

146
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,883
I have many names

147
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,906
Many faces

148
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,908
Interesting

149
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,911
I have heard lots
about you from Javed

150
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,892
I'm impressed

151
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,916
But I am not

152
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:16,917
Javed, tell him why I am here

153
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,928
Didn't you always say you want to
end everything with a final deal?

154
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:23,906
This is it

155
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,905
This is Adityapuram palace in Kerala

156
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,909
Here occurred bloodshed over
wealth and land issues long ago

157
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,912
And the palace treasury was sealed

158
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:45,913
A rare treasure trove of gold
ornaments and precious stones

159
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,921
Worth many billions

160
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,922
The heirs are Ravindra Varma's sons
Vasudeva and Srikrishna

161
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:59,931
And Mahendra Varma's children
Shekara and Rajashekaran

162
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,937
Vasudeva Varma's sons
are Trivikrama and Pratap

163
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,905
And Srikrishna Varma's
daughter is Damini

164
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,908
Shekara Varma's only son is Sudhakar

165
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,890
Rajashekar's daughters
are Rukmini and Gowri

166
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:18,916
These people are rich,
influential and tough

167
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,863
When the time came to
open the treasury

168
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,659
totally unexpected development-

169
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,925
Stop!

170
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,926
Wait before you look up an auspicious
day to open the royal treasury

171
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:37,931
Mr Lawyer, I have got
a stay order from the court

172
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:38,936
Stay order?

173
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:39,937
Why?

174
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,940
The royal family can't claim
the wealth in the treasury

175
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,943
It belongs to the public
is my contention

176
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:50,915
Treasure amassed from taxes, coercion,
harassment, looting in wars is not ours

177
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:55,916
It is not right for us 'common people'
to share it within our family only

178
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,923
Let the court decide

179
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,925
After that we can
open the treasury

180
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,929
Rajashekar, don't you
bring in your communism here

181
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,934
We've been waiting to claim
this wealth all these years

182
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,905
Now don't provoke us with
such unnecessary objections

183
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,918
I am well aware

184
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,976
The sword you struck
my brother with,

185
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,218
is still safe in the armory
like a souvenir!

186
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,950
If you have dubious intentions
better delete them once for all

187
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,952
I am not Shekara Varma

188
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,954
Ahimsa blood doesn't flow in my veins

189
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,933
Like a comrade once said...

190
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:36,923
I'm a communist with a strong heart
who can return any number of blows

191
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,929
Don't you dare threaten me!

192
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,933
You are going against the word
of honour given by our father

193
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,937
We differ in our
beliefs and ideals

194
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,918
Forgive me, brother

195
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,944
The stay order from
the court is still in effect

196
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,947
And the treasure is in the cellar

197
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,928
You will steal it

198
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,954
How and when...?
That is your call

199
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,956
And the terms between us

200
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:09,960
Out of the total loot,
20% will be yours

201
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,941
In cash

202
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:17,913
I trade only with God
50 for me, 50 for Him!

203
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,940
Since I am my own God
His share is also mine

204
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,921
That makes it 100%

205
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,946
Please understand
There is a 3rd party involved

206
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,948
Unknown entity

207
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,950
Come on Be reasonable

208
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,953
What is your part then?

209
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:36,955
I am a humble trader

210
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,937
I'll sell anything for anyone

211
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,962
I don't bargain
with street vendors

212
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,964
My price is 5 billion

213
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:47,943
No discounts No additions

214
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,967
Nor percentages

215
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,970
2500 million to be paid in 2 days

216
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,644
Balance at the end of the mission
and when assets change hands

217
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,384
How can I trust you?

218
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,927
You asked for it

219
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:10,951
Impossible Simply impossible

220
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,927
What if you fail?

221
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,932
What if I fail?

222
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:29,943
Javed, tell him, Lord of Death is
never questioned about his life span!

223
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,954
He means business

224
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,935
Let's do this

225
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,970
Sajan?

226
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,972
Hey! Sajan

227
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,974
Who the heck?

228
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:08,975
Sorry, sir
Why are you here, sir?

229
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,982
Good question... to ask
why I am in my own office?

230
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,986
Goodness! Your office?
Then why am I here?

231
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,956
Dude, I sent word for you

232
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,938
Numbskull!
Come inside

233
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,969
I expect minimum decorum
when you come to meet me

234
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,971
Look at yourself

235
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,975
Shabby and untidy
and reeking of cheap rum

236
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,980
With the pittance I earn
will I buy scotch whiskey?!

237
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,981
What are you
muttering to yourself?

238
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,983
Nothing, sir

239
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,352
Superintendent of Police has reported

240
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,924
you slink away after
signing in the register

241
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,991
So that rascal has
got me into trouble

242
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,995
If you have any opinion
say it aloud... don't swear

243
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:02,967
No use at all making me sit there
in the name of computerization

244
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,971
The only 'window' I know
is the one you see there

245
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,974
Then I am going to shift you

246
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:10,953
Where to?

247
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,957
Oh!
Gandhi?

248
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:20,981
They have decided to open
the Adityapuram palace cellar

249
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,967
They claim the coffers are overflowing

250
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,993
The royal heirs with divided opinion
have become sworn enemies

251
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,997
As much enmity to each other
as the years they haven't met

252
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:36,000
You know the ex-MLA
Rajashekaran Varma?

253
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,002
He is one of the legal heirs

254
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,972
He has filed a case asking
the Govt. to take over the wealth

255
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,975
Dog in the manger!
This is the problem with communists

256
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,977
Won't eat nor allow us to eat

257
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,979
They are to blame
for all my troubles

258
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,981
You listen to me first

259
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,962
We got this report
from the junior office

260
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:58,018
Since this has reached the media
a robbery of unexpected nature is likely

261
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,972
Your presence is
essential at the palace

262
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,975
On the sly surveillance

263
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:07,998
I agree, sir

264
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,000
I won't allow anyone
to steal that treasure

265
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,002
I will put him behind bars

266
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,005
'I must fix a deal
with that fraud'

267
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,007
'And I must demand
some percent of the loot'

268
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:21,980
'I can then resign from this petty post
and then it is celebration time'

269
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,985
We were waiting for you

270
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:32,986
All of you must be here to take
some decisions regarding the case

271
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,992
Mr Lawyer, explain everything

272
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,996
King Rajashekaran stands alone
opposed by the rest of the family

273
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:43,000
Don't address me like royalty
You can call me by name

274
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:48,001
The court will come to a decision
only after hearing both sides

275
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:54,011
We can also ask the Govt's opinion

276
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:59,012
Treasures in the cellar must remain in
'as is where is' basis with high security

277
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,022
But there is a hitch

278
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:09,994
No one has been able to provide
a list of the treasures in the cellar

279
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,999
We have an approximate
idea of its value only

280
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,999
So we must assess the value of items
by a mediator acceptable to both sides

281
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:24,008
This must be submitted
in court within three weeks

282
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:29,009
Mr A S Shivaram, a private consultant
in Jaipur and he is a Malayali

283
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:37,017
There are very few qualified in
assessing such precious artifacts

284
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,023
I don't know him personally

285
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:43,027
But he was suggested by
a reliable, close friend

286
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,030
If all of you agree
we can proceed

287
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,999
- We need to think over it
- Not necessary

288
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,003
We can go along with
uncle's suggestion

289
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,985
Let Shivaram assess the treasure

290
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,989
She knows what she is talking, brother

291
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,012
We agree

292
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,015
Make arrangements
for him to come

293
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,018
I am Damini, daughter
of Srikrishna Varma

294
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,022
- What are you doing now, my dear?
- Property development in Mumbai

295
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,023
Your husband?

296
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,026
I haven't fallen
into that trap as yet

297
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:20,030
Can the court be
informed about Shivaram?

298
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,032
Please inform me also

299
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,013
About everything

300
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,010
I am Sajan

301
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,992
Intelligence DySP

302
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:41,018
Varma sir?
How are things with you?

303
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,000
Ages since we met, right?

304
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,004
We are old friends

305
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,030
I've understood the issues here

306
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,036
During the evaluation I will
also be inside the cellar

307
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:02,039
We didn't ask for security
So who invited you here?

308
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,041
What the heck!

309
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,044
There are only
2 uninvited guests

310
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,047
One is death and
the other is police

311
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:14,017
We were warned
of a possible robbery

312
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,020
My presence is just a precaution

313
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:22,021
Ever since the media hyped
about the wealth in our treasury...

314
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,028
we arranged our own security

315
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:30,029
We have assigned Bluefox
India's topmost security to protect us

316
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,017
So your service isn't needed here

317
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,042
May I speak, father?

318
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,043
Yes

319
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,046
Good to have additional
police surveillance

320
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,051
When Govt... offers a service
why should we avoid it?

321
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:51,054
What do you say, Rajashekara?

322
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,055
I agree

323
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:55,025
Okay, Mr Sajan You can go ahead

324
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,027
We will co-operate

325
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,999
Varma sir 1 minute

326
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,043
We can't renew old friendship
in front of others, right?

327
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,046
There isn't anything to renew

328
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,048
I don't forget easily

329
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,030
Also I've heard
many stories about you

330
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:26,056
If you reveal anything
in a drunken stupor...

331
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,059
I'll simply kill and bury you

332
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,062
Varma sir, don't worry

333
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,064
What is between us
will remain a secret

334
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,012
No one will ever know anything

335
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:53,018
How can you stop now?
Why this sudden decision?

336
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,054
I'm really bored That's why

337
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:02,055
If you don't enjoy what you do
you must stop doing it

338
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,062
I am glad, end of my career
will be in Kerala

339
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,064
To end where it all began

340
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:11,068
It is about 15 years since
I've stepped into Kerala

341
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,069
What about you guys?

342
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,071
Is that important?

343
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,073
Don't have a long face

344
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,041
Listen, Abbas

345
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,044
You've been with me for 7 years

346
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,047
After this mission
you go your way

347
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,050
I want to be with you always

348
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,029
No, Abbas

349
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:33,024
I've always been a loner
Hereafter totally by myself

350
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,039
There is nothing
personal among us

351
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,064
Don't carry any
emotional baggage

352
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:45,068
Priya, you are secure
after the last deal

353
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,073
So... you aren't needed in this

354
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,073
Yeah, I'm safe

355
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,078
Life has been a fairy tale
after meeting you

356
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:58,049
But I need sleeping pills
if I want to sleep

357
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:03,053
In your language
'my emotional baggage'

358
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,054
Guilt

359
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,035
Hey... no

360
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,059
Haven't you heard?

361
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,062
No one owns anything in this world

362
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:18,036
Anyone can take anything
even if it belongs to another

363
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,041
How can it be called
looting or robbery?

364
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,076
You must never feel guilty

365
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:30,080
I too want to be a part of
this last lap of your journey

366
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,082
You don't have to pay me

367
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,084
I just want to be with you
in your last outing

368
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,087
Free service I'm not for it

369
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,090
Love, obligation and gratitude
Not at all necessary

370
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,059
Everything is as usual

371
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,031
We are equals and we go equal

372
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,065
We go equal

373
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,047
But you are first among equals

374
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,069
Where is the newspaper?

375
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,057
Hello?

376
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,082
Who are you?

377
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,063
Hey... hello?

378
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,092
- Good morning
- Who are you?

379
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,094
- Me?
- Then me, huh?

380
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,096
The one you've been waiting for?

381
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,077
- Me?
- Yes

382
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:32,102
Oh! Then you can go
to the backyard

383
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,103
You'll find the cowshed there

384
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,082
Cowshed?

385
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,105
Yes

386
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:40,106
Veterinary hospital head said he would
send someone to inseminate the cows

387
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,115
Gawd! You misunderstood me

388
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:48,085
I haven't come to make the cows
or anyone else here pregnant!

389
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,066
It's a policy I stick to!

390
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,089
Who is it, Saraswathi?

391
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,091
I can't place you

392
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,094
I am Shivaram from
Hoard Consultancy

393
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,073
Jaipur

394
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,102
I was asked to assess
the palace treasures...

395
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,879
by your lawyer and
give a report to the court

396
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:12,887
Are you Mr Shivaram?

397
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:13,910
Yes

398
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,889
What are you doing?

399
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,888
- Don't move
- You are taken

400
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:24,921
Indeed a surprise, Mr Shivaram
I was not informed of your arrival

401
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,891
I was in Tanjore
So I took a train

402
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,892
I reached early morning

403
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,895
I settled down in the portico
not to disturb you so early

404
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,898
Good, now you can freshen up

405
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,901
After breakfast we can
go to the palace

406
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,109
Your accommodation
has been arranged there

407
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,907
My dear, open the room
on top for Shivaram

408
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,909
Ensure the bathrooms
have fresh towels

409
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,890
Okay, you can go up

410
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,897
Go inside

411
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,920
Anything else for you?

412
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,923
A cup of black coffee
if it's not a botheration for you?

413
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:00,924
Not at all

414
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,906
You heard him, dear?

415
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:08,876
Shivaram

416
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,884
Excuse me

417
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,911
I was just simply
looking at the palace

418
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,914
Why do you need
binoculars for that?

419
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,917
Aren't you going there anyway?

420
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,899
Looking from far and near are
2 different views altogether

421
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:33,924
Some things have to be seen
from far and some nearby

422
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,928
And some must be first seen
from afar and then near

423
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,929
Coffee

424
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,911
Some things must never be seen!

425
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:43,935
Good coffee

426
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,916
That always makes my day

427
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,918
Towel

428
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,888
Soap?

429
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,890
Thank you

430
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,895
Mohanam is beautiful

431
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,895
What?

432
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,920
Most beautiful among
all ragas is Mohanam

433
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,923
Your prelude this morning was
awesome

434
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,927
So you weren't asleep
Just pretending

435
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,930
Why would I pretend?
I was really asleep

436
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:18,903
Actually there is a state
between sleep and wakefulness

437
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,938
That was when Mohanam nudged me

438
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:22,940
That was a great wake up call

439
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:24,942
Oh! Let me shower

440
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,927
Something is amiss

441
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,934
Why this sudden
visit from all of you?

442
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,935
Come inside

443
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,938
No need! We have
not come to socialize

444
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,940
Father, haven't you
harassed us enough?

445
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,944
You squandered wealth intended for
our family to your political party

446
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,948
And now when we may get something
substantial, you've filed a lawsuit

447
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,951
Assets of the palace
is public property, eh?!

448
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,953
Aren't you ashamed?

449
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,957
I do feel ashamed
Not for the lawsuit

450
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,926
But for giving birth
to 2 children like you

451
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:21,933
Before matters turn complicated
we want a last round of discussion

452
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,914
Then you don't have
to waste your time

453
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:27,937
Don't you understand?

454
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:32,910
I don't know how to ask you to
get out in a more civil manner

455
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:36,946
Dad, phone

456
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,949
- Who is it, my dear?
- From the palace

457
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,951
Ask them to call later

458
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,933
I'll ask dad to call you

459
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,957
Dad?!

460
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,959
Are you shameless?

461
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,933
Moment you stepped in here
we lost our father and home

462
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,935
One day we will
settle all scores

463
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,937
If not today, tomorrow

464
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,941
Sister, such dialogues are obsolete

465
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,945
Just stare and turn around
to walk away is today's style

466
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,948
And a music score in support too

467
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:12,927
Come

468
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:25,931
Even though I joked
I am upset, dad

469
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,945
Isn't it true what they said?

470
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,970
Problems began
only after I came?

471
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,973
Everything turned right
only after your arrival

472
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:37,974
Really?

473
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,921
Really

474
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:41,923
Come

475
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,953
My children-

476
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,955
Shall we have breakfast?

477
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:52,956
Sure

478
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,938
My dear, will you lay the table?

479
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,562
Come, Shivaram

480
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:06,563
We got a mail from Bluefox
asking for more security guards

481
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,564
I was replying'

482
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,566
Greetings, uncle

483
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,568
My older brother Shekara Varma

484
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,569
Greetings

485
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,571
He heads our royal family now

486
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,550
Brother, he is Shivaram

487
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,577
Royalty doesn't count
I'm just another citizen

488
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,580
Mr Shivaram, I heard
you're a Malayali?

489
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,583
- Which part of Kerala are you from?
- Sasthamkotta

490
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,586
But I have no one there now

491
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,589
I'm advocate Idiculla
When can we start evaluation?

492
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,591
Tomorrow

493
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,595
My 2 colleagues will come now
Our machines have to be set up

494
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,597
Very sorry, Mr Shivaram

495
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:45,568
Only you are allowed
to enter the treasury

496
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,570
Your assistants will
have to wait outside

497
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,571
Why?

498
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,574
Only Mr Shivaram's name
is recorded in the court

499
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:56,575
Other than Shivaram, during evaluation
those allowed inside can only be...

500
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:01,580
heirs, court officials,
lawyer Idiculla and me

501
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,586
Nonsense!

502
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,588
We'll get permission
for his assistants too

503
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,589
No need

504
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,591
Their main job is...

505
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,593
to assist with data and software

506
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,596
They need not come in

507
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,578
How many days are
required to finish this job?

508
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,602
Depends on the quantity
to be assessed

509
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,604
I haven't seen
the properties as yet

510
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,585
Let me see

511
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:28,556
Then I can tell you
the number of days I need

512
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,563
Okay, See Yo"

513
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,585
Good morning, Bhai ji

514
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,587
Hi Bhai ji

515
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,593
So everything is as planned

516
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,597
Under no circumstance should you
leave the caravan, Abbas

517
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,598
Unless and until I tell you

518
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,577
Sure

519
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,604
The person watching us
now is DySP Sajan

520
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,405
A troublemaker

521
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,408
He's intelligent and
absolutely corrupt

522
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:37,409
You know brains and corruption
is a deadly combination

523
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,415
Deal with him carefully

524
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,396
- So catch you later
- Fine

525
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:01,404
Is your room comfortable?

526
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,405
Yes

527
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,386
If you need anything
don't hesitate to ask

528
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,387
I don't want anything

529
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,412
I'm fine

530
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:14,413
When your name was suggested by
my uncle, none of us opposed him

531
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,399
We only expect you to be fair

532
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,424
We looked up your firm on
the net and we were convinced

533
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,426
My job is to only evaluate

534
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,428
How does 'unfair' come into it?

535
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:30,429
Apart from evaluation we expect
unconditional co-operation from you

536
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,383
You will come to know by and by

537
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:40,406
Unless I know what exactly you want
from me, I find it difficult to reply

538
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,414
There may be families still living
engulfed in nostalgia of royal life

539
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,415
But we are different

540
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,418
We are businessmen playing
with millions in the market

541
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,420
And we always mean business

542
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:54,424
I am a professional
I don't do business

543
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,427
There is always a 1st time, right?

544
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,429
A day you can begin
for the first time?!

545
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,432
Sure... like a day when
everything will end too

546
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,433
Haven't you heard?

547
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,412
The doomsday

548
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,437
You are a tough nut
We are impressed

549
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,440
We will let you know what
we want next time we meet

550
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:14,410
You can then give us
a solid hand shake

551
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,389
Let's see

552
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,421
Hi! I'm Damini Varma

553
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,400
I know

554
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,406
Your salt and pepper 'look' is very hot

555
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,411
- Really?
- Yes

556
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,415
You have the attitude
of a seasoned player

557
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,418
You are a huge turn on

558
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,423
Nowadays I have lost interest

559
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,447
A kind of disinterested indifference

560
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:55,396
Anyway, thank you
for your enticing words

561
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,408
(holy chants)

562
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,448
The Goddess is appeased

563
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,449
Okay

564
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,422
Heirs can hand over the keys
to the court official

565
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,450
I can help him

566
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:08,451
Okay

567
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,453
Not necessary

568
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,455
It's not time for
evaluation as yet

569
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,457
He's only helping
to unlock the door

570
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,458
No need

571
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,460
It isn't the evaluator's job

572
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,461
Sajan

573
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,464
You are here to ensure
things go smoothly

574
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,466
Not interfere in
what Shivaram does

575
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,447
Please go ahead, Shivaram

576
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,481
No one must enter now

577
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,483
This place has to be purified

578
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:51,455
And the king must light
a lamp for the Goddess

579
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,461
Now that I have cleansed the deity
Your Highness can light the lamp

580
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,457
This chest contains
the documents prepared...

581
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,482
before the treasury was
locked, along with its keys

582
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,484
The rituals are over, right?

583
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,465
The priest can step out

584
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,489
Now this is a work place

585
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,491
I will tell you what to do

586
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:32,463
As specified before
only 4 people can enter

587
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,499
Before the evaluation begins
some precautions must be taken

588
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,501
All of you must co operate

589
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,482
I am in charge here

590
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,476
This place should never be
in darkness even for a moment

591
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,458
We need light even if
the generator fails

592
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,483
Are you ready, Shivaram?

593
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:59,484
Tools are okay
but not the camera

594
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,489
Sir, no photography

595
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:05,490
Nothing can be photographed
Especially items you examine

596
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,497
Strictly for security reasons

597
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:08,532
Okay

598
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:10,477
Please proceed, sir

599
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,508
I'm about to begin my work

600
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,510
You can categorize the items

601
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,513
And prepare your list accordingly

602
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,515
From now on I am in charge

603
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:29,485
I won't take orders from anyone

604
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,464
Is that clear?

605
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,468
Okay

606
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,511
Emerald from ancient Persia

607
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,514
Weighs 4.1 gm

608
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,486
Belongs to the period
between 1750 and 1800

609
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,500
Let us count

610
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:26,531
This is one of the most risky
missions I've ever attempted

611
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:31,536
There are 5 factors making this
almost a 'mission impossible'

612
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,542
The position of the treasury

613
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:37,513
Under the hawk eyes of Bluefox
state of the art security machines

614
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:41,517
Proximity of Sajan
a shrewd police officer

615
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,520
And the presence of
other members always

616
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,524
Huge quantity of
my targeted objects

617
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,506
I have a precise plan

618
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,531
But no alternative moves
in any of my plans

619
00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:00,532
There is no place for Lady Luck
or unexpected turn of events

620
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,539
This final game is
actually very thrilling

621
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,520
I am excited

622
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,545
I have few more things to share

623
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,526
Wait for me in the van

624
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,527
Start duplicating these keys

625
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:04,556
These are the detailed sketches
of some major palaces of Kerala

626
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,542
You must analyse them

627
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:13,537
They also house
similar treasuries

628
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,575
Work on them in detail

629
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:20,576
Yes, Bhai ji

630
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:23,545
Wi-Fi transmissions
are active, aren't they?

631
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,547
Yes, Bhai ji

632
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,550
Data will start
pouring in from tomorrow

633
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,531
Keep going, guys

634
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:42,985
Greetings!

635
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,957
A visitor to see you
from Coimbatore

636
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,992
Whose has asked you
to murder me?

637
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,994
A big shot

638
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,997
Business secrets
should not be revealed

639
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,978
Shall I finish my work?

640
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,977
You appeared like God
from shards of wood

641
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Who are you, man?

642
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,981
A lion or Lord Narasimha?

643
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,009
Why did you come here?

644
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,990
Simply... to play

645
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,990
I've repeated countless times
this action of removing my watch

646
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:31,005
So let it remain this time

647
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:51,032
I was expecting this
ever since I filed the case

648
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,013
Who do you think
was behind this attack?

649
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,036
Could be anyone

650
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:58,018
Most probably my own children!

651
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:03,044
What's the point of
sulking like this?

652
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:06,026
Is this the 1st time
I've been attacked?

653
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:12,053
But I'm amazed how you came
at that precise moment to save me

654
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:14,055
I stopped work early today

655
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:17,058
Felt tired, so I just
went out for a drive

656
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:21,029
And reached at the exact time
when Varma sir was attacked

657
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,008
A very strange coincidence

658
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,033
That is called luck

659
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:29,037
We also call it planning

660
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:33,041
She is your daughter, hmm?

661
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,022
Go inside, my dear

662
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:44,048
You seem to be an expert
in martial arts also, eh?

663
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:51,027
People say I am expert
in all kinds of arts, Sajan sir

664
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,063
Shall I take leave?

665
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,066
I don't want to be
formal and thank you

666
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,047
Not at all necessary

667
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,026
Thanks

668
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:20,051
But what happened
was not unexpected

669
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,036
There is a reason

670
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:26,040
Actually who are you?

671
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,066
It's a feeling I can't shrug
ever since I met you

672
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:34,069
You are not upfront

673
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,071
There is something dubious

674
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,053
Tell me Who are you?

675
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,055
Me?

676
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,029
Don't tell anyone

677
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,053
I am Shivaram

678
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,055
I did not ask your name

679
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,057
Are you...

680
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,038
are you a fraud?

681
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,048
May be I'm a fraud

682
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:02,090
Hi boss We've landed

683
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:06,094
He insists on meeting you
ever since he landed here

684
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,063
So I had to bring them here

685
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:12,067
Look who I have
brought along with me

686
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,068
Hello I am Shivaram

687
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,071
From Hoard consultancy, Jaipur

688
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,052
<i>So am 1</i>

689
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,077
Who are these new avatars?

690
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:25,080
2 men in 1 place
with same identity

691
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,061
It's weird

692
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,085
What do you say in Malayalam?

693
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,087
It isn't good at all

694
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,089
Yes, not good at all

695
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,092
But for whom is the question!

696
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,302
'What I thought was 1,
now appears as 2

697
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,367
My sorrow is inexplicable knowing so'

698
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,101
Bhai ji, chill Let's talk

699
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,082
Yeah, let's talk

700
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:52,052
So this Shivaram is actually a fraud

701
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,103
Nikhil's arrival with that man...

702
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,103
Bhai ji, be careful

703
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,106
I had told him I wanted to
communicate certain things

704
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:29,110
But as you said
his arrival was a bit dramatic

705
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:33,081
Getting Shivaram on his side
is a threat to you, Bhai ji

706
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,084
If we get him into trouble
he will get back at us

707
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:39,087
That is why he has
brought Shivaram here

708
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:43,091
He coolly pitched in with them
knowing the stakes are high

709
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:49,065
If he thinks all this will threaten me
his brain must be sadly wanting!

710
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,079
Anyway let us meet him

711
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:02,110
Good to see you, Bhai ji
Very good to see you

712
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:06,114
I'll also call you 'Bhai ji'
like everybody else

713
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,095
<i>Because none of us
even know your name</i>

714
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,120
When he said you wanted to
discuss something with me...

715
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:15,068
I just thought
I'll fly down and meet you

716
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,093
That's good

717
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,097
But your show of getting him here
to threaten me was a dirty move

718
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,098
Bhai ji-

719
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,101
Well, you can't be
anything else but dirty

720
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,103
Bhai ji, don't misunderstand

721
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:33,104
Bittu's gang you had arranged in Jaipur
to hold him in custody wasn't reliable

722
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,909
That's why we hauled him here

723
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,891
But this pig now wants
a share in our deal

724
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:41,894
Come

725
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:47,918
Don't try to soft pedal this issue
with your most pitiful brains, Javed

726
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:52,895
He is a precaution
So I don't double cross you

727
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,103
But whatever the precaution...

728
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,901
if I make up my mind,
you had it from me

729
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,903
Ask him not to irritate me

730
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:02,904
Bhai ji

731
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,885
Give it to him

732
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:10,890
See this

733
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:23,925
You have to replicate
all these materials

734
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:28,926
I know he has the necessary
man-power and machinery for it

735
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:31,933
Diamonds, pearls, emeralds
and other precious stones

736
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:35,904
Collect their duplicates
Try the African market

737
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,907
I have specified the quantity

738
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:39,908
Wrap them in red velvet

739
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,911
Make arrangements to bring
the whole lot in 12 boxes

740
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,913
Within 20 days

741
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,915
It is short notice
But it has to be done

742
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:47,894
Tough task

743
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,918
But this, I can do it

744
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:50,897
Good

745
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,921
If everything goes as planned...

746
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:57,928
within 21 days,
treasure will be lost forever

747
01:09:58,928 --> 01:09:59,906
Till then...!

748
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,938
He is dangerous

749
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:10,917
But I am fit

750
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,944
Hire more workers if you want

751
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,892
But before the rains
concreting must be done

752
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:22,896
You carry on I'll be back

753
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,920
Come, Shivaram

754
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:26,921
How is your arm, sir?

755
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,924
That can be ignored

756
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:34,925
If it's no trouble you can drop
the 'sir' and call me comrade

757
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,933
It's a joy to hear it from people
who are sincere and affectionate

758
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,935
But within our party...

759
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:44,907
sworn enemies call
each other comrade

760
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,941
This school...?

761
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:51,914
A school for the kids here with
least expense and best of education

762
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:56,951
When this desire was born
I sold everything to start it

763
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:57,952
Do you see?

764
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:01,923
Work is incomplete
There is a lot to be done

765
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,925
I need lots of money

766
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,928
I don't have enough
resources in my hands

767
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,910
You also know by now
Saraswathi is not my daughter

768
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:13,935
I brought her home
as an orphan 15 years back

769
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:19,909
But today I prefer to say
I have only one daughter

770
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:27,945
Even if I die
she'll live here with dignity

771
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,953
She must help others
to live progressively

772
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,956
That's how the idea
for a school was born

773
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,958
She runs the school now

774
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,960
I'm not afraid of hurdles

775
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:45,901
But the attack that day
has really shaken me up

776
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:50,938
I'm worried I may not be able
to complete my responsibilities

777
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,940
That won't happen, comrade

778
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:54,942
I just felt like talking to you

779
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,923
That's why I asked you to come

780
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,949
How many days more
to complete evaluation?

781
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,951
At the most 10 days

782
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,953
Did you hear?

783
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:10,954
Our family trust has decided to use
the treasure to build a heritage resort

784
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:17,961
Potential foreign investors have been
invited to a party and musical night...

785
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,967
by our new generation

786
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,969
I heard about it

787
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,938
As the saying goes...

788
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,910
fools rush in where
angels fear to tread

789
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:51,968
"Protect me permanently
Oh lotus-eyed deity Parvati"

790
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:57,974
"Goddess Shakthi Embrace me"

791
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:03,974
"Oh lotus eyed deity, envelop me
Your beauty is ethereal for eternity"

792
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:14,952
"Effortless effulgence"

793
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:20,958
"Protective Goddess
Perfectly peerless"

794
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,970
"Epitome of beauty matchless"

795
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:38,976
"Oh Goddess lotus eyed
Beauty unrivalled far and wide"

796
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:51,927
"Provide me sanctuary"

797
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:17,954
"Your divine words of honey"

798
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:32,996
"Auspicious one! Your words honeyed
Dispeller of sins of the good hearted"

799
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,980
What?

800
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:50,981
"Oh lotus eyed Shakthi, shield me
Your beauty is beatific superlatively"

801
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:04,967
"Protect me, Goddess Parvati"

802
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:31,961
This is a song sung often by
someone I loved very much

803
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,997
Let this remain
a secret between us

804
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:39,969
Give this to your dad
I had borrowed it

805
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,982
Tonight we begin

806
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:59,983
These spots that I have marked
show the position of security guards

807
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:04,988
Between these 2 spots here
is a hub of the CCTV

808
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,974
Priya, you must ensure
this hub is jammed

809
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:13,030
But control room server usually
has a software that checks

810
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:17,004
It checks every 30 minutes

811
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,986
So we get exactly
half an hour for the operation

812
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,009
That's fine

813
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,981
You jam the CC TV circuit
at sharp 1'o clock

814
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,016
You will help me break in

815
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:31,018
And I'll join you
back at sharp 1:30

816
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:35,968
But Bhai ji, inside the cellar
what's the plan of action?

817
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:46,969
Sketches of the cellars
in 4 major palaces of Kerala

818
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:51,005
All 4 have 1 common factor

819
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:54,010
A secret door which is
not obvious at first sight

820
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:59,982
A secret door leading to
the outside world through a tunnel

821
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:04,018
In case of wars or
any other emergency...

822
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:09,019
stuff from the treasury were
shifted through this tunnel

823
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:16,965
Won't some family member or at least
Shekara Varma know of its existence?

824
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,003
I feel he may not know

825
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:25,806
When the treasury was
locked up long ago

826
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,583
the king definitely
would have known

827
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:34,011
But since there was bloodshed
he would not have revealed...

828
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:37,018
this secret to
the next generation

829
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:41,022
A precaution he took to ensure
no one had access to the treasury

830
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:45,026
Then how do we
find that secret door?

831
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:48,031
It takes time And plenty of luck

832
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,032
Luck doesn't count

833
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,034
Logic is what matters

834
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:56,037
Architecture from
the 16th century onwards...

835
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:59,006
shows every door has
at least one bit of metal

836
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,987
It's a general theory

837
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:08,015
If this metal scanner is used
inside the treasury walls...

838
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,996
we get the required result

839
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,999
Guess I can find the door

840
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:18,004
'3 hours before the mission'

841
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:24,031
So you think there could be
a possible robbery here

842
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:29,038
Sir, do you know what is
a good policeman's strong point?

843
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,038
Get feeling

844
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,040
I get the feeling

845
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,042
Something is about
to happen here

846
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:39,013
The air around here has
all signs of that build up

847
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,016
Do you suspect anyone?

848
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:42,995
Suspicion!

849
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:48,022
The outside world knows
about this treasury only now

850
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:52,026
Thanks to the blown up
hype given by our media

851
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:57,033
This may seem a golden opportunity
for a big time gang or thief

852
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:01,014
There is another possibility

853
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:06,040
4 of you are entitled
to this treasure

854
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,042
Then Rajashekaran filed the case

855
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:13,043
Now each one of you may want to
grab the entire wealth for yourself

856
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:17,051
So may be it is
an elaborate scheming?

857
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:20,054
Only Rajashekaran is
responsible for all this

858
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:23,023
Isn't that why there was
an attempt on his life?

859
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:25,025
Don't try to blow it
out of proportion

860
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:28,028
If it comes to a stage where
we have to bump him off...

861
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,030
we are prepared to do that also

862
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,032
Hey! Leave him alone

863
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:35,035
He has suffered a lot in life

864
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,016
None of you know him

865
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,039
But I do

866
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,040
What do you know?

867
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,043
Forget it!
I won't tell

868
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:45,024
It's a secret between us

869
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,050
Fine, don't tell

870
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,031
Let him drink himself to death

871
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,028
Let's go

872
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:08,035
You plan to get me
drunk daily, eh?

873
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:11,038
Oh! Come on
Tell me

874
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,017
What is that secret?

875
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,047
What's the status?

876
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:52,051
- I'm on it
- Okay

877
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,054
I'm done

878
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:53,061
So far I have never
asked You for anything

879
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:57,076
I am not asking You
anything now either

880
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:03,071
I just want You to ensure
these boxes reach their destination

881
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,085
I just thought I will tell you

882
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:10,089
So shall I start my work?

883
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,110
Now this is a secret between us

884
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:20,890
A secret we share
along with 1 more person

885
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:42,917
Abbas, I am at the moment
1.5 km away from the palace

886
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:48,923
But the tunnel
is just 1/2 km long

887
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,941
Okay, Bhai ji

888
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,952
He has come

889
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,934
It's so delicious

890
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,966
Didn't you go saying
'no more discussions'?

891
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:06,945
Changed your mind?

892
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,969
We are not here
to discuss anything

893
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:10,971
Just to give you
a piece of information

894
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:13,974
You must withdraw the case
you have filed in court

895
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:14,975
If I don't?

896
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:16,956
Then we will counter file

897
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:22,951
15 years ago, Saraswathi,
who was 12 years then...

898
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:26,966
was molested by <i>3</i> men

899
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:29,935
A gang rape

900
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:36,963
You were the MLA then

901
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,966
You bribed Sajan who was
the chief inspector then

902
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:41,968
And the case was closed

903
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:45,940
From that day onwards
you brought her here

904
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:51,974
For hiding and destroying evidence
For bribing a policeman

905
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:55,982
And for denying justice to her
we will file a case against you

906
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:58,964
We will demand to have
her molesters tracked

907
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,966
The media will be overjoyed

908
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:04,970
Father and daughter
will be in the limelight

909
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:09,996
Won't you prefer
to avoid all this?

910
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:13,967
We have planned a meeting for
the investors at the palace tomorrow

911
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,949
You have time till then
to withdraw your case

912
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:19,951
Otherwise we'll just do it

913
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:45,999
- You...!
- Let me tell you

914
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,002
Don't be dishonest

915
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:53,006
You got drunk and blabbered

916
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:54,975
Don't, comrade

917
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:56,978
It was a mistake Forgive me

918
01:31:57,979 --> 01:31:59,980
Do you know what he did to me?

919
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:01,961
Rajashekara!

920
01:32:05,987 --> 01:32:08,989
Brother, do you know what
my children came and told me?

921
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:11,994
Don't worry I will talk to them

922
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:15,975
But you could have confided
in me at least at some point

923
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:20,980
I could not Forgive me

924
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:46,993
It was about 15 years ago

925
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:51,994
Actually speaking
April 12th 1999

926
01:32:51,999 --> 01:32:53,979
I was an MLA

927
01:32:55,002 --> 01:33:00,002
I was returning from
a meeting at 2:00 a.m.

928
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,009
Chief Inspector Sajan called me

929
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:07,013
I went to Dr Sebastian's clinic

930
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:09,016
What is it, Sajan?

931
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:14,020
I chased a fellow who was
suspected in a robbery

932
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:16,022
I missed him

933
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,991
But on my way back

934
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:20,973
Among the thick bushes-

935
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:31,004
We received a complaint
from the orphanage

936
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:33,006
About a missing child

937
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:37,010
A 13 year old girl who was
attending vacation classes

938
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:40,013
The name slip showed
it was the same girl

939
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:41,014
Saraswathi

940
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:43,016
What did you say her name was?

941
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:45,018
Saraswathi

942
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,020
I went to her school recently

943
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:48,021
I even presented a prize to her

944
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:49,022
She's a bright girl

945
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:52,025
Yes sir, I asked her before
she lost consciousness

946
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:54,027
But she did not
remember anything

947
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:55,028
There were <i>3</i> of them

948
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:58,977
They abducted her when
she was walking down the road

949
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:03,982
It's terrible

950
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:15,015
My dear?
Saraswathi

951
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:19,019
Don't hurt me, please

952
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,000
Come here

953
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:28,028
Can you catch those miscreants?

954
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,029
I can try, sir

955
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:31,031
We have no clues

956
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:34,034
They might even have
fled from our state

957
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:36,015
Anyway try to find them

958
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,986
Let us wait
before we file a case

959
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:47,009
'I showered tender loving
care on that orphan'

960
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:53,999
'I visited her everyday'

961
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:59,025
'When there was no hope
of finding the culprits...'

962
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,027
'...I said there was
no need to file a case'

963
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:06,000
'The doctor and Sajan
agreed and cooperated'

964
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:11,039
'I brought her to my house and
raised her as my own daughter'

965
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:17,045
To let her be the cynosure of
media's eyes and talk of the town...

966
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,046
I was not prepared

967
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:25,047
A case that may prolong for years
causing her to lose her youth

968
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:32,025
I gave her courage to live

969
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:35,028
I convinced her
that nothing had happened

970
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:40,029
Sajan gave his word of honour
never to reveal this

971
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:43,036
That son of a mongrel
broke his promise

972
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:45,038
My own children
threatened me today

973
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:48,041
If I did not withdraw
the treasure-case...

974
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:53,042
they'd go to court
and revive this rape case

975
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:58,047
They have given me time till
the investors meet tomorrow

976
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,053
And my Saraswathi...!

977
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:05,003
She is silent now
Not even crying

978
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:11,999
Didn't I warn you
I may fall any day?

979
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,012
Comrade...!

980
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:30,049
Hey! Welcome
Stage is all set

981
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:33,031
- Shall we start by 8:00 p.m.?
- Even 8.30 is fine, chill

982
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:43,062
I remember you

983
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:46,044
<i>3</i> years ago in Goa
New year's eve

984
01:36:47,034 --> 01:36:51,037
It was you
You look different now

985
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:53,039
Yeah! It was me

986
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,040
Hey man!

987
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:58,044
After the program that day
I searched all over for you

988
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:59,046
He's a great singer

989
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:03,049
In Goa he barged into
my program and sang

990
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,051
It was mind blowing

991
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:07,053
It was awesome

992
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:09,055
Why are you here?

993
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:11,057
I am on a job

994
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:13,059
And you are Mr...?

995
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:17,063
You did mention your name
that day but I forgot

996
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:18,064
Shivaram

997
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:21,069
No, not Shivaram
I think something else

998
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:24,070
It is Shivaram
Maybe you got it wrong

999
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:27,073
Okay, Shivaram Leave it

1000
01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:29,042
You have to join me tonight

1001
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,023
Balabhaskar will be there
We will rock the show

1002
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:32,056
Hey... no... no

1003
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:35,048
No, Shivaram It's a deal

1004
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,050
You are a singer too?

1005
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:37,961
Great

1006
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:39,963
Looking forward to the show

1007
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:42,055
Cool, see you on stage

1008
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:44,057
Gopi, come this way

1009
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:47,039
I'll arrange to get
your luggage from the car

1010
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:56,446
This is Shivaram

1011
01:37:57,471 --> 01:37:59,451
He's the one who
evaluates the collection

1012
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:03,476
They are interested in trade
aspects of this collection

1013
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:08,477
So the get-together today is
a business party of potential buyers?

1014
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:13,453
It is not something related to
your heritage resort project

1015
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:16,435
You are sharp and spot on

1016
01:38:35,476 --> 01:38:39,479
I know all of you are busy with
your guests for today's event

1017
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,461
I came here to
tell you something

1018
01:38:43,484 --> 01:38:46,486
The time allotted to
my dad ends this evening

1019
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:49,468
I came to tell you our decision

1020
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:54,460
Either suicide or insanity

1021
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:57,442
One of this would
have been my fate

1022
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:03,437
It was my dad who
rescued me from that hell

1023
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:09,475
A right to live
like everyone else

1024
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:11,477
And to live with dignity

1025
01:39:11,478 --> 01:39:17,451
He gave me confidence and
courage to live and help people

1026
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:20,486
You can file a court case

1027
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:22,488
And revive the old rape case

1028
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:24,469
Make me a scapegoat

1029
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:27,472
I will face it coolly

1030
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:33,529
As for the case filed by my dad
regarding the treasure in the cellar

1031
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:37,449
There is absolutely
no question of withdrawing it

1032
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:41,474
I won't let my dad get defeated

1033
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:43,455
I came just to tell you this

1034
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:51,462
A good shower cleansed
my body that was defiled

1035
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:56,489
But is there any holy river that can
ever cleanse your corrupt minds?

1036
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:58,470
Have you ever thought about it?

1037
01:40:09,536 --> 01:40:11,516
You heard what she said?

1038
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:14,486
This is my daughter

1039
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:17,454
My one and only daughter

1040
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:22,460
Come

1041
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:24,462
My child!

1042
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:28,466
No one will file
any case in any court

1043
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:33,471
I won't allow anyone to
tarnish your reputation

1044
01:40:57,484 --> 01:41:00,486
I regret what happened
Shivaram sir

1045
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:02,488
But I can make up for it

1046
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:06,492
I was following a lead regarding
the attack on Varma sir

1047
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:09,495
A lone investigation
without involving anyone else

1048
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:12,477
I found him finally
I will meet him tonight

1049
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:14,500
I have many suspicions

1050
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:16,502
Don't deal with this alone
It is dangerous

1051
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:19,505
Don't worry, Shivaram sir
I have my methods

1052
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:23,509
I even doubted you

1053
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,511
Not anymore All clear

1054
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:29,483
I will be able to give a piece
of good news to Varma sir tomorrow

1055
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:37,491
When this place is busy partying,
I'll execute a crucial operation

1056
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:43,475
'3 hours before the function'

1057
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:46,477
Bhai ji

1058
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:48,501
Javed had called

1059
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:51,504
Duplicates are ready
as per your instructions

1060
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:55,508
12 boxes will arrive
in a van tonight

1061
01:41:55,509 --> 01:41:58,511
Tonight at 12:30
they will hand over...

1062
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:01,514
the consignment
at the spot we specify

1063
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:02,515
Okay

1064
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:05,497
Modifications in the tunnel have
been done as per your instructions

1065
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:07,498
Now it is lit up also

1066
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:10,523
We must complete
the mission tonight

1067
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:11,502
Right, Bhai ji?

1068
01:42:12,526 --> 01:42:13,526
Yes

1069
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:17,498
Bhai ji, are you upset
about something?

1070
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:20,500
The incident about that girl

1071
01:42:20,501 --> 01:42:24,506
Priya, didn't I always say
'no emotional baggage'?

1072
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:32,480
But in life, a force
called fate traps us

1073
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:38,486
Some coincidences
sweep you away in their tide

1074
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,522
Do you know how many years
since I visited Kerala?

1075
01:42:42,523 --> 01:42:43,523
15

1076
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:44,524
You've told us

1077
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:45,503
Yes

1078
01:42:46,527 --> 01:42:48,507
15 years ago

1079
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:54,502
I robbed a bank
along the borders of Tamil Nadu.

1080
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:56,514
I was alone

1081
01:42:57,571 --> 01:43:01,519
Police somehow
traced and followed me

1082
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:06,491
Help...!

1083
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:11,495
Please help

1084
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,500
Save me

1085
01:43:30,537 --> 01:43:32,538
Let me go

1086
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:37,539
The scene I witnessed that day
in the rear view mirror...

1087
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:40,525
till date has not been
erased from my mind

1088
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:44,517
I have had many a sleepless night

1089
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:48,489
Till now I never realized...

1090
01:43:49,523 --> 01:43:53,526
the reason for my anguish
was the scene I witnessed long ago

1091
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:56,508
Now it is my emotional baggage

1092
01:43:58,532 --> 01:44:01,513
She may not have seen
my face on that dark night

1093
01:44:02,536 --> 01:44:05,538
I remain in darkness even today

1094
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:09,510
A different face
in each darkness

1095
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,561
Bhai ji, are we backing out?

1096
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:22,534
No! A job is always a job

1097
01:44:57,557 --> 01:45:02,557
"Lord... Almighty! Strummed
on sarod strings of my mind"

1098
01:45:04,564 --> 01:45:06,544
"Blessing me ambrosial harmony"

1099
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:13,540
"Amidst the moon, stars bring to me
bouquets of 7 notes of melody"

1100
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:19,541
"In enchantment hours awakened
Like a leaf he floats on waves forsaken"

1101
01:45:20,547 --> 01:45:23,616
"Through paths marked by
woeful shadow

1102
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:27,360
share this journey through
the day's glow"

1103
01:45:56,550 --> 01:46:05,527
"Rhythm of heartbeat to raga Nilambari
Notes you shared long ago with me"

1104
01:46:05,592 --> 01:46:09,395
"Kisses of moonlight on those lips tiny

1105
01:46:09,396 --> 01:46:14,368
Mother gave me milk
tasting like honey"

1106
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:18,442
"Wandering bird rests
in the heart's atrium

1107
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:23,711
when unfirm paths unfold
in calm delirium"

1108
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,615
"Many faces, smiles, laughter recalled

1109
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:29,582
on leaves, waves, hills,
withheld walled"

1110
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:32,359
"Between the paths of
day and night

1111
01:46:32,452 --> 01:46:35,160
when mind traversed;
a cloud bows bright"

1112
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:39,358
"Like time bestows wisdom
to the teacher

1113
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:42,772
Be filled to the brim,
oh Mother!"

1114
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:49,570
"On wings of destiny
I continue my journey"

1115
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:55,417
"Knowledge springs
from paths bridged

1116
01:46:55,742 --> 01:47:00,714
Like a river bubbling with kindness hinged"

1117
01:47:19,566 --> 01:47:23,537
"The Omnipotent one"

1118
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:35,577
"The Omnipresent one"

1119
01:47:35,582 --> 01:47:39,553
"The Omniscient one!"

1120
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:46,559
"Lord... Almighty! Strummed
on sarod strings of my mind"

1121
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:49,595
"Blessing me ambrosial harmony"

1122
01:47:49,596 --> 01:47:54,596
"Amidst the moon, stars bring to me
bouquets of 7 notes of melody"

1123
01:47:56,570 --> 01:48:01,570
"In enchantment hours awakened
Like a leaf he floats on waves forsaken"

1124
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:07,947
"Through paths marked by
woeful shadow

1125
01:48:07,948 --> 01:48:12,920
share this journey through
the sun's halo"

1126
01:48:42,582 --> 01:48:45,563
'2 hours after the function'

1127
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:51,590
We will complete
our plan in 1 hour

1128
01:48:51,591 --> 01:48:55,594
You must transport the boxes
you brought into the tunnel

1129
01:48:55,595 --> 01:48:58,597
And exchange the boxes
from the treasury into the van

1130
01:48:58,598 --> 01:49:00,578
Okay, fine

1131
01:49:16,616 --> 01:49:18,617
You have planned it

1132
01:49:18,618 --> 01:49:21,599
Now you must execute it alone

1133
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:26,560
Bhai ji, if you don't mind
let Abbas remain with us here

1134
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:33,577
Okay

1135
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:27,398
Frisk him

1136
01:50:28,421 --> 01:50:30,628
Hey! What the hell?!

1137
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:39,410
I don't think you need
this gun any more

1138
01:50:47,407 --> 01:50:51,617
Javed, I have kept
the GPS chip inside the boxes

1139
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:55,414
Just to make sure
it reaches its destination

1140
01:50:55,415 --> 01:50:57,395
So that he can't double cross us

1141
01:51:01,421 --> 01:51:04,423
See, the boxes are moving

1142
01:51:04,424 --> 01:51:05,402
Perfect

1143
01:51:28,415 --> 01:51:29,393
See this

1144
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:01,447
Yes, Javed He has done it

1145
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:04,452
He has kept the same boxes
we delivered inside the cellar

1146
01:52:05,418 --> 01:52:07,419
I told you He never plays dirty

1147
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:09,421
You pay him
He'll get the job done

1148
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:11,402
Excellent

1149
01:52:15,929 --> 01:52:19,531
I feel a special bond with you, Mother

1150
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:22,206
which I never felt towards
any other God

1151
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:26,438
Thank you for everything

1152
01:52:26,439 --> 01:52:28,419
I'll take leave, see you

1153
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:14,453
Great, Bhai ji

1154
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:17,456
There is a small change in the plan

1155
01:53:17,457 --> 01:53:21,428
Our final transaction
will be in Jaipur

1156
01:53:22,462 --> 01:53:25,443
And I will hand over
the money to you there

1157
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:27,444
Okay

1158
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:30,435
Allow Abbas to accompany us

1159
01:53:30,436 --> 01:53:34,407
You also need to know
we won't cheat you

1160
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:38,443
He is your guarantee

1161
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:40,445
Bhai ji, don't misunderstand

1162
01:53:40,446 --> 01:53:42,447
All will end well

1163
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:43,426
Okay

1164
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:46,430
You can take him

1165
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:51,456
Our final meeting
shall be at Jaipur

1166
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:52,435
Okay, fine

1167
01:54:36,469 --> 01:54:40,474
Detailed report of the evaluation
of the assets is in here

1168
01:54:41,474 --> 01:54:43,454
These are the copies
for the heirs

1169
01:54:44,477 --> 01:54:46,457
So my job is over

1170
01:54:49,482 --> 01:54:51,483
It is all God's grace

1171
01:54:51,484 --> 01:54:53,430
Thank you

1172
01:54:57,457 --> 01:54:59,458
Shivaram

1173
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:00,437
Let's go

1174
01:55:06,466 --> 01:55:08,446
See you

1175
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:15,442
Get the copy of the report
from the lawyer

1176
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:22,076
To certain people
we get too close too soon

1177
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:24,082
You are a great friend

1178
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:26,084
A wonderful human being

1179
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:28,086
You must visit us again

1180
01:55:28,087 --> 01:55:31,091
We must have a blast
with music and booze

1181
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:35,060
Ever since my daughter
told me about your music-

1182
01:55:35,061 --> 01:55:37,041
I will come

1183
01:55:42,068 --> 01:55:45,049
DySP Sajan was
murdered last night

1184
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:49,074
His body was found on the hillside
a kilometre away from the palace

1185
01:55:49,075 --> 01:55:54,047
We got an anonymous call
suggesting a clash between you two

1186
01:55:57,083 --> 01:56:00,064
Sir, you must come with us
We will have to talk

1187
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,072
Bhai

1188
01:56:20,073 --> 01:56:21,074
It has happened as I expected

1189
01:56:22,075 --> 01:56:24,076
I'm going to Jaipur
You go back to Delhi

1190
01:56:24,077 --> 01:56:25,077
Let me also come, Bhai ji

1191
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:29,049
No! Only Abbas and I
will play this one last game

1192
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:31,083
You don't worry

1193
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:34,065
He will come back
to you, safe and sound

1194
01:56:44,097 --> 01:56:45,098
Dad...?

1195
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:51,071
I heard dad has been arrested
Do you know why?

1196
01:58:07,113 --> 01:58:10,148
Greetings, Bhai ji
It was a long journey, eh?

1197
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:13,130
Oh yeah, it was a long journey

1198
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:17,122
And unfortunately
your journey ends here

1199
01:58:17,123 --> 01:58:19,103
You words were prophetic

1200
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:22,127
It's your last game in
the real sense of the word

1201
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:25,130
From the time you reached
the palace on this mission...

1202
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:28,078
I always had my
suspicions about you

1203
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:33,105
Because seeing all this treasure
anyone will lose their mind

1204
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:37,109
Those 12 boxes in the van
can tempt anyone

1205
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:41,115
But I did tell Nikki
Bhai ji will never double cross

1206
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:43,116
But we?
We are bastards

1207
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:45,895
The deal is called off

1208
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:49,126
And I am not going
to pay you anything

1209
01:58:52,925 --> 01:58:56,134
Javed claims you have
a soft corner for him

1210
01:58:56,929 --> 01:59:01,166
So I have put a price on him

1211
01:59:01,167 --> 01:59:05,904
Bhai ji, I spoke to Nikki
and we worked out a formula

1212
01:59:05,905 --> 01:59:08,907
Rs. 2500 million
that Nikki paid you?

1213
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:11,910
Give it back to him
and we'll set this dude free

1214
01:59:11,911 --> 01:59:14,913
And we can part as friends

1215
01:59:14,914 --> 01:59:17,149
We'll part as friends

1216
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,917
Good

1217
01:59:18,918 --> 01:59:22,921
There are some more people
yet to arrive on this scene

1218
01:59:22,922 --> 01:59:26,925
The unknown entity
he had once told me

1219
01:59:26,926 --> 01:59:28,928
'There is a third party
involved in this'

1220
01:59:29,929 --> 01:59:30,929
'Unknown entity'

1221
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:34,901
The silent partner in this game

1222
01:59:35,935 --> 01:59:40,935
I didn't want to trouble you
So I brought them here myself

1223
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:41,918
Take a look

1224
01:59:58,925 --> 02:00:03,925
The stolen treasure will today be traded
with an international diamond cartel

1225
02:00:05,932 --> 02:00:08,934
For a mind blowing price

1226
02:00:08,935 --> 02:00:11,336
I brought the senior
and junior kings who

1227
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:13,681
were to be here for
the final transaction

1228
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:15,941
Not me actually

1229
02:00:15,942 --> 02:00:15,976
Bittu

1230
02:00:17,944 --> 02:00:19,924
My man in Jaipur

1231
02:00:20,947 --> 02:00:22,948
Hey Shivaram
What are you saying?

1232
02:00:22,949 --> 02:00:24,950
I don't understand anything

1233
02:00:24,951 --> 02:00:27,898
You, Shekara Varma,
who heads the Royal family...

1234
02:00:27,954 --> 02:00:29,921
is not a simpleton

1235
02:00:29,922 --> 02:00:32,924
Do you know who
told me that you are...

1236
02:00:32,925 --> 02:00:34,905
a cheat and a lowlife?

1237
02:00:36,929 --> 02:00:38,909
Mother Goddess

1238
02:00:40,933 --> 02:00:44,904
The Mother who guards
the cellar treasures

1239
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:51,939
Bullet, decades old embedded
on the wall of the cellar...

1240
02:00:51,944 --> 02:00:57,917
showed me how the crystal on
the crown of the Goddess burst

1241
02:01:02,955 --> 02:01:05,957
'Now this is a secret between us'

1242
02:01:05,958 --> 02:01:10,907
'A secret we share
along with 1 more person'

1243
02:01:10,963 --> 02:01:16,914
I also got a glimpse of
the good Shekara Varma's evil side

1244
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:21,940
'The king knew your deceitful
nature which no one else knew'

1245
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:25,944
'With astrological assistance,
his decision to close...'

1246
02:01:25,945 --> 02:01:29,948
'...the cellar for 41 years
was to punish you'

1247
02:01:29,949 --> 02:01:38,926
'Neither you nor Vasudeva Varma
must enjoy this wealth in your youth'

1248
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:42,961
When your younger brother
got a court stay order...

1249
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:47,962
you realized you lose
the 1/4th wealth you would inherit

1250
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:51,915
You ganged up with him
for a treasure heist

1251
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,917
The moment I realized...

1252
02:01:53,973 --> 02:01:57,942
it was you and not him
who hired me

1253
02:01:57,943 --> 02:01:59,944
I was watching you

1254
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:04,945
Knowing if your brother is alive
he would cause you problems...

1255
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:06,951
you attempted to murder him

1256
02:02:06,952 --> 02:02:10,955
If he had died, Vasudeva Varma
and Srikrishna Varma...

1257
02:02:10,956 --> 02:02:11,956
will be the suspects

1258
02:02:11,957 --> 02:02:14,959
They will begin to
distrust each other

1259
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:19,960
By taking your brother's case
forward, you will be the winner

1260
02:02:19,965 --> 02:02:22,967
The opening of the treasury
will again be postponed

1261
02:02:22,968 --> 02:02:26,971
There will be more
opportunities to break in

1262
02:02:26,972 --> 02:02:29,953
You'd have even
dealt with me directly

1263
02:02:30,009 --> 02:02:35,009
Sajan had got a lead on
the people hired for the murder

1264
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:37,928
He... Sudhakara Varma

1265
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:41,953
During the investors' party
in the palace...

1266
02:02:41,954 --> 02:02:46,926
invited Sajan out secretly

1267
02:02:48,961 --> 02:02:51,963
It is already known
you are behind all this

1268
02:02:51,964 --> 02:02:56,964
Not heeding my warning,
Sajan walked to his death

1269
02:02:56,969 --> 02:02:58,970
Following my orders...

1270
02:02:58,971 --> 02:03:03,977
Abbas recorded the visuals
'live' with his camera

1271
02:03:04,977 --> 02:03:09,977
That CD must have reached the police
department by speed post today

1272
02:03:09,982 --> 02:03:11,983
You son of a-

1273
02:03:11,984 --> 02:03:13,964
Son of a mongrel!

1274
02:03:22,962 --> 02:03:24,942
Son...?

1275
02:07:24,036 --> 02:07:25,036
Bhai ji

1276
02:07:25,037 --> 02:07:27,005
It was my mistake

1277
02:07:27,006 --> 02:07:28,006
I admit It was my mistake

1278
02:07:28,007 --> 02:07:31,011
Forgive me, Bhai ji
It was my mistake

1279
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:32,989
I am to blame

1280
02:07:33,045 --> 02:07:36,993
Please... please forgive me

1281
02:07:37,049 --> 02:07:40,018
It was him

1282
02:07:40,019 --> 02:07:42,020
This fellow

1283
02:07:42,021 --> 02:07:44,022
He brainwashed me
to switch sides

1284
02:07:44,023 --> 02:07:46,024
Let him pay for it

1285
02:07:46,025 --> 02:07:49,027
I will stand by you
to trade the treasure

1286
02:07:49,028 --> 02:07:51,029
You can give me any cut

1287
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:53,032
Okay... fine
Don't give me anything

1288
02:07:54,033 --> 02:07:55,011
Javed!

1289
02:07:56,035 --> 02:07:58,036
You proved your true nature

1290
02:07:58,037 --> 02:08:00,038
Shut up... you scoundrel!

1291
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:02,040
Bhai ji please

1292
02:08:02,041 --> 02:08:03,019
Okay

1293
02:08:05,044 --> 02:08:07,045
When we confront each other...

1294
02:08:07,046 --> 02:08:11,015
it is not a clash
between good and evil

1295
02:08:11,016 --> 02:08:12,996
Because we are all evil

1296
02:08:14,019 --> 02:08:17,000
The question is who is dirtier

1297
02:08:19,058 --> 02:08:21,004
And I guess

1298
02:08:23,028 --> 02:08:25,008
I am the dirtiest!

1299
02:08:29,034 --> 02:08:30,012
You

1300
02:08:31,036 --> 02:08:34,017
I will make use of you

1301
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:39,043
You and junior king
will deliver the 12 boxes...

1302
02:08:39,044 --> 02:08:42,046
to the place I ask you to

1303
02:08:42,047 --> 02:08:45,049
I will message you the address

1304
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:47,051
You can take
the original evaluator

1305
02:08:47,052 --> 02:08:48,998
He might come into use

1306
02:08:51,023 --> 02:08:53,024
Thanks, Bhai ji

1307
02:08:53,025 --> 02:08:58,998
To see you don't get nasty ideas
let senior king remain with me

1308
02:09:00,032 --> 02:09:02,033
Done, Bhai ji

1309
02:09:02,034 --> 02:09:03,012
Thanks

1310
02:09:04,036 --> 02:09:05,036
Then go

1311
02:09:05,037 --> 02:09:07,017
Come on, come on

1312
02:09:19,051 --> 02:09:22,053
In the games we play
there is only one rule

1313
02:09:22,054 --> 02:09:25,056
The worst always survives

1314
02:09:25,057 --> 02:09:30,057
The night I reached, prepared
to collect the treasure with Javed...

1315
02:09:30,062 --> 02:09:36,013
for 5 minutes that van
on the way waited for your vehicle

1316
02:09:55,053 --> 02:09:57,033
MY Son!

1317
02:10:24,049 --> 02:10:28,052
The royal treasure
is back safe in its cellar

1318
02:10:28,053 --> 02:10:33,053
Nikhil Atharva's boxes with
GPS chips and duplicate jewels

1319
02:10:33,058 --> 02:10:40,033
were exchanged for
the original ones in the cellar

1320
02:10:41,066 --> 02:10:43,067
If you asked me why I did it...

1321
02:10:43,068 --> 02:10:45,048
redeeming a loan is my answer

1322
02:10:45,103 --> 02:10:50,052
Even this mission which came
in search of me was destiny

1323
02:10:50,108 --> 02:10:55,057
And at the end of the day
I have made huge money

1324
02:10:56,081 --> 02:10:59,028
2500 million for nothing

1325
02:11:03,055 --> 02:11:05,056
But you?

1326
02:11:05,057 --> 02:11:08,038
You are a loser

1327
02:11:15,067 --> 02:11:20,073
You deserve a royal death
You call the shot

1328
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:47,064
'After a year'

1329
02:11:47,065 --> 02:11:52,065
'To all our special guests and those
who kindly accepted our invitation'

1330
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:54,071
'...we express our heartfelt thanks'

1331
02:11:54,072 --> 02:11:59,072
Your support and co operation
is the strength of this institution

1332
02:11:59,077 --> 02:12:03,080
The completion of this building
was possible due to the huge sum...

1333
02:12:03,081 --> 02:12:07,084
of a donor who wishes
to remain anonymous

1334
02:12:07,085 --> 02:12:11,056
Our heartfelt thanks to him
for his generosity and affection

1335
02:12:11,123 --> 02:12:15,071
Thanking you once again
Jai Hind!

1336
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:19,041
Very happy

1337
02:12:19,097 --> 02:12:21,043
Thank you, sir

1338
02:12:22,067 --> 02:12:23,045
Okay

1339
02:12:27,072 --> 02:12:29,052
Dad...?

1340
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,081
Shivaram...!

1341
02:12:37,082 --> 02:12:40,084
All those whom we invited
graced the function

1342
02:12:40,085 --> 02:12:44,088
But we waited for the arrival
of this particular uninvited guest

1343
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:46,069
Thanks for coming

1344
02:12:46,124 --> 02:12:51,124
I thanked the anonymous donor
who generously contributed

1345
02:12:52,097 --> 02:12:53,097
Did you hear me?

1346
02:12:53,098 --> 02:12:55,099
There is much more
to thank him, isn't it?

1347
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:58,102
For rescuing me
from the Sajan's case

1348
02:12:58,103 --> 02:13:02,051
For safely entrusting
the wealth to the Govt...

1349
02:13:04,076 --> 02:13:07,078
Don't praise and
glorify my deeds

1350
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:09,059
I am a person without virtues

1351
02:13:10,082 --> 02:13:13,063
I have no regrets
for all I have done so far

1352
02:13:14,086 --> 02:13:17,088
Neither have I
confessed to anyone

1353
02:13:17,089 --> 02:13:19,069
16 years ago...

1354
02:13:21,093 --> 02:13:22,093
one night when I heard

1355
02:13:22,094 --> 02:13:26,097
the anguished pleas of
a little girl crying for help

1356
02:13:26,098 --> 02:13:29,079
I was not in a position to save her

1357
02:13:31,103 --> 02:13:33,083
The face of that girl

1358
02:13:34,106 --> 02:13:35,084
This face...

1359
02:13:38,110 --> 02:13:41,114
remains like a burning
ember within me

1360
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:44,060
My first and last confession

1361
02:13:49,087 --> 02:13:54,087
Most people lead ordinary lives
without committing too many mistakes

1362
02:13:54,092 --> 02:13:56,093
But there are people
who commit misdeeds...

1363
02:13:56,094 --> 02:13:59,096
make amends with greater
gestures of generosity

1364
02:13:59,097 --> 02:14:01,077
History is always with them

1365
02:14:04,102 --> 02:14:06,082
Can I ask you something?

1366
02:14:08,106 --> 02:14:10,086
What is your actual name?

1367
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:16,113
Do you remember
what you once asked me?

1368
02:14:16,114 --> 02:14:18,094
Are you a fraud?

1369
02:14:19,117 --> 02:14:21,097
You can call me

1370
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:24,066
Mr Fraud...!

1371
02:14:49,114 --> 02:14:54,120
"Shimmering moonlight
Dazzling desirous delight"

1372
02:14:56,121 --> 02:15:02,094
"Clouds vapory
in my heart's treasury"

1373
02:15:04,129 --> 02:15:11,069
"On the shores when a tempest
is on the warpath of unrest"

1374
02:15:12,104 --> 02:15:18,077
"I shall rush ahead; no delays
like a rain laden wind always"

1375
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:22,649
"To relieve my burden; in proximity

1376
02:15:22,948 --> 02:15:26,117
Singing my love's verses of
immortality"

1377
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:33,900
"Like a poem written but erased
my life remains a secret encased"

1378
02:15:33,924 --> 02:15:38,724
