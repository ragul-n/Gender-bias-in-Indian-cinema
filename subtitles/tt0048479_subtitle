1
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Beena's so lucky! Her in-laws have
sent her such a beautiful necklace

2
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh yes, it's really beautiful

3
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,880
Expensive too

4
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Must be worth at least 50,OOO

5
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,920
Chand, is it true?
- Absolutely true

6
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,160
True? You realise whom you are
raising head against?

7
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,520
l'm not raising my head, father.
l'm merely asking for my right

8
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,760
Sons don't ask their fathers
for their rights

9
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Fathers give their sons their dues
on their own

10
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
You'll have to change your mind.
- No, father

11
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Unless l see the girl's face,
this marriage is not taking place

12
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,760
You think of it now that you
have arrived at the bride's house?

13
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Were you asleep earlier?
- l wanted to tell you earlier

14
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,880
Talk softly. l know, you haven't
taken

15
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,920
a single step independently in life
You've always done

16
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,840
the bidding of others
l'm not such a coward, father.

17
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,160
- Had you not been a coward...
you wouldn't have humiliated me

18
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,520
like this in someone else's house
Think about it, Chand. How will l be

19
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,120
able to say anything to Kedarnath?
How will l tell him that my son wants

20
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,760
to see your daughter's face...
before he marries her.

21
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,760
- If you can't...
Iet's the bridal procession back.

22
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,680
- The bridal process does not go back
It's a sacred promise. One would

23
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,480
rather die than break it
l was married too,

24
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,800
and so was my father
But neither my father nor l

25
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,800
acted so arrogantly
l trusted my father and

26
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,760
my father trusted his
That isn't happening anymore, father

27
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,760
Times have changed.
We must change too

28
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,160
l'm firm in my decision. l won't
mary

29
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,720
the girl unless l see her face
Shut up! Rascal!

30
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,160
There was a time when sons kept their
father's promise even after he died

31
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,400
And today, you humiliate me
while l'm still alive?

32
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,800
You can afford to be stubborn.
But l won't let that girl's life...

33
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,480
be spoilt, who is dreaming
of a new life ahead

34
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
lf you want my honour to lie
at Kedarnath's feet today...

35
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
that's how it will be

36
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,800
What is the matter?
Say something, please

37
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
Where is Chand?
- In the other room

38
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,800
Squandering away his father's honour.
- What does that mean?

39
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,800
Mr Kedarnath, you are about to hear
words from me today...

40
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
that l do not have
the sanction to utter

41
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,400
But l'm helpless

42
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
My son wishes to see the girl
before the marriage

43
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,800
What are you saying?
- l'm not saying it

44
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,520
Nor is it the love of my son
that makes me speak

45
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
The young man is stubborn,
Mr Kedarnath...

46
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,520
and you know what a big storm
it can unleash

47
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
l did my best to make Chand
See leaSOn

48
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,520
But boys of the new generation go
deaf

49
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,480
when you talk of norms and mores
Mr Jwalaprasad, something like this

50
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,600
has never happened in our community
If anyone gets to know,

51
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,480
l'll lose face
l've already considered that

52
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,600
But if it doesn't happen, the bridal
procession will return from your door

53
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,640
This humiliation is nothing
compared to that one

54
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
You will be humiliated, so will l
and our forefathers

55
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,080
Beena isn't iust your daughter.
She's my child too

56
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,680
My conscience is pricking me

57
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,080
l'm insisting that my own daughter
be put on display today

58
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,600
lf only Chand wasn't my son.
If only l didn't have any issues...

59
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,200
l wouldn't have had to see
this shameless sight today

60
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,240
Please go to Chand.
l'll do what l can

61
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,600
You've done a great thing, my son

62
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,680
You have done something that will
make people will spit at my name

63
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,280
Father...

64
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,720
l've waited enough. l've seen
what l had to from outside the veil

65
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
But my eyes yearn to see your face

66
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,320
Father, l like the girl

67
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,120
Thank you, but l don't like you

68
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,760
Father, this marriage will
not take place

69
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Beena! What are you saying?

70
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,600
Mr Chand did a nice thing by
asking me to remove my veil

71
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,280
He has been exposed in the process.
l can't entrust my life to a man...

72
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,120
who sees superficial beauty
as the way of life...

73
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,120
who's only looking
for a beautiful face...

74
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,720
for whom a wife is no more
than a commodity

75
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,120
You saw my face. You liked
my features and nodded...

76
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
''Father, l like the girl!''

77
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,680
Why didn't you ty to find out what
heart this prem-faced girl has?

78
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
Father!
- Silence

79
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,640
Please be calm. You have come here
only looking for a prem face

80
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,160
So you'd rather listen to a few words
from these prem lips

81
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,120
You had come to get married,
to settle down in life

82
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,800
You wanted a companion for life,
to spend your life in harmony

83
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,680
But your words make it clear that
you need not a wife...

84
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,360
you need a beautiful face in a
beautiful frame for your drawing room

85
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,160
Bravo, my girl!
l'm delighted!

86
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,080
Although you're a girl, you have
taught this arrogant chap a lesson...

87
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,760
which will serve as an example
to misled youngsters like him

88
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,600
Father, do not play
with my feelings

89
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,080
lf l wish, l can find hundreds of
girls

90
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,840
like her wishing to lie at my feet
Let's go, father

91
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,480
So you've seen the girl?
Are your eyes satisfied now?

92
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,480
Now go and insert
an ad in the newspapers...

93
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,080
that you need a beautiful wife!
See the girl first, my foot!

94
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,400
l married your mother
without even looking at her!

95
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,200
The guests have returned!
People poked fun at us!

96
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,760
ls this what l got you educated for?

97
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
ls this why l had you take
Iessons in music and dance?

98
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,800
Father, you sent me to college
so l could decide...

99
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,480
what is good and bad for me.
You gave me the light of education...

100
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,600
so l could find the true path.
- Was this the true path...

101
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,680
to dash your old father's hopes?
To spurn your husband to-be...?

102
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,040
and ruin your life?
- My life isn't ruined, father

103
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
lt has been saved from ruin.
Think about it

104
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,040
Could l ever have been
happy with him?

105
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
After marriage, if l had to
return to your house again...

106
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,800
what would you have gone through?
- Who knows about the future, my

107
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,440
dear?
But you don't know the consequences

108
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,640
of what has happened today
At the worst, no boy might be

109
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,640
willing to mary me. Right?
l can make that much of a sacrifice.

110
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,560
- You are mad
How would you know what a burden

111
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,440
a young, unmarried daughter is!
Believe me, l will not put you

112
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,520
through any hardships, father
Won't you take off

113
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,080
that bridal headgear?
Flowers don't look good

114
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,800
on a rat's face!
Father!

115
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,800
- See the girl, indeed!
What the hell is all this?

116
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,680
What are you doing here?
l'm putting the stuff in.

117
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
- Go ahead
This is an expensive necklace, sir.

118
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,680
Where must l keep it?
So Kedarnath has returned

119
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,720
the necklace?
l never heard ofjewelley

120
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,480
being returned like this
The bridegroom has returned

121
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,600
from the bride's door...
see the girl indeed!

122
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,640
''Father, l have touch your feet
in the darkness of the night...''

123
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
''to go away from you''

124
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,440
''l'd have forever lived with you.
But the sight of me...''

125
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,120
''would have caused you agony.
Had l been present there...''

126
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,160
''people would have pointed fingers
at you, because of me''

127
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,400
''l know what you will go through,
when l go away like this''

128
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,520
''But with time, you and society
will forget about my misconduct''

129
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,320
''l assure you, wherever l live
l will be the ideal Indian girl''

130
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,160
''l will do nothing that will
cast a slur on your fair name''

131
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,200
''At evey step, your blessings
will show me the right path''

132
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,720
''Your daughter, Beena''

133
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
What have you come here for?

134
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,320
Raian hasn't come home for many days.
l'm told he's in jail

135
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,920
lf you sympathise so much with him,
rather you go to jail with your

136
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,920
brother
Do not be so cruel!

137
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,480
l need your help
Please help me!

138
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,280
- Lady, this is a decent man's house
It isn't a home for the destitute.

139
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,120
- l know what house this is!
Of the decent man who plays

140
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,480
with the heart of a poor girl...
as if it were a toy,

141
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,920
and break it
For his selfish needs,

142
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,320
he calls her his beloved
Place a hand on your heart and tell

143
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,320
Don't l mean anything to you?
- You are so naive

144
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,520
Haven't you been able
to figure me out yet?

145
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,440
Pran has a rule in life.
A new suit, he wears just once

146
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,600
New boots, iust once.
And...

147
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,360
Quiet, Pran! Don't forget,
God is looking down at us

148
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,600
On the Day of Reckoning,
He will dispense justice

149
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,920
Right? But l'll deal with it,
when the time comes

150
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,560
So why mustn't l enioy my life?
Now just get going

151
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,320
There are so many girls
pining for their Pran

152
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,240
Don't do this to a broken woman,
Pran.

153
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,320
- Enough of your rubbish! Get out!
Do not be so cruel!

154
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,560
l haven't eaten in days
My brother's in jail.

155
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,560
Have mercy on me!
So you won't listen!

156
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,400
Just get the hell out of here!
Done with!

157
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,400
Darling Pran, who was she?
- A beggar

158
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,920
She came to Pran's door
to beg for his love

159
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,280
Wow!

160
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,400
Wow!

161
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,200
Makardhwai, you're taking digs at me.
You are vey happy today?

162
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,360
Rai-saheb, what a great portrait

163
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,360
lt appears as if he were
a Colonel or a General

164
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,600
What a name your parents gave you!

165
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,960
ldiot! Am l any lesser than
a Colonel or a General?

166
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,560
Lord preserve my virility!
Evey lane l walk through...

167
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,360
even wrestlers step aside.
- The ruins do suggest...

168
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,600
it used to be a grand structure.
- Bloody prawn!

169
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,360
Am l a picture of ruins?
- Youth is youth, Rai-saheb

170
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,960
And old age is old age

171
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,400
Lord preserve my virility!
Old age is miles away

172
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,560
Old fossil! If you ever want
to ty my strength...

173
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,400
summon a King Kong!
- How will King Kong compete with

174
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,240
you?
You are the strongest man in India.

175
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,080
- Bravo! You're a vey nice man!
Step closer, Makardhwaj.

176
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,520
Look...
whenever you want any money,

177
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,600
do not hesitate to ask me, okay?
You may go now

178
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Welcome... welcome, young man!

179
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,240
You will see the girl indeed!
So have you seen one?

180
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Father, don't be under the illusion
that there's a dearth of girls for me

181
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,600
Someday, my wife and your
daughter-in-law's picture...

182
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
will be published right here.
- And why not?

183
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,480
What dearth of girls for you?
You're young, tall, handsome...

184
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,600
and whose son are you after all?
Rai Saheb Jwalaprasad...

185
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,240
a rich retired contractor,
who has returned from Burma!

186
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Whatever, father! In iust a few
days, you'll see...

187
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,240
a beautiful girl will walk into your
house as your daughter-in-law

188
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,360
The sight of whom will make
the Moon hide, the stars break...

189
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,640
and cause an earthquake!
King Rat!

190
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,960
See the girl indeed!
- Poke all the fun at me, father

191
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,880
But l'll bring home a girl who's
more beautiful than Beena

192
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,040
Maybe you'll find a girl who's
more beautiful than Beena

193
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,480
But not you, not even your father can
find a girl with such a nice heart

194
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Had she become my daughter-in-law,
my life was made!

195
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,560
And my life was ruined!
My joys were all over

196
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,400
You say that because you
don't have her, son. Sour grapes!

197
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,880
Not your mistake, father.
Old age has driven you senile

198
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,440
Go away, piss off

199
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,560
God bless my virility!
Old age is miles away!

200
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
My mother died when
l was still a child...

201
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,400
and my father went away,
sick of povem

202
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,160
My brother's in prison.
So you tell me...

203
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,320
what could l have done?
Death was better than the life l lead

204
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,200
God gives us life. And only He has
the right to take it away

205
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,160
l don't blame you, but why didn't
your brother take care of you?

206
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Couldn't he earn an honest
livelihood?

207
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,760
- Don't blame him, sister
The things he has done to stay alive!

208
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,800
He went around looking for iobs...
for days, he lived in penuy with me.

209
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,480
But hunger drove him to desperation
And he turned to crime.

210
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,800
- Rather than steal...
or commit suicide, it's better

211
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,280
to die in penuy
Had there been only a setback or _o

212
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,120
in life, maybe l wouldn't do that
But l had other reasons too.

213
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,800
- What reason?
Do not ask me, please.

214
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,800
That must remain a secret
l want to keep the secret

215
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,480
buried in my heart
A secret like that...?

216
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,480
- You've given me a new lease of life
It would be a sin to hide anything

217
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,800
from you. So, please don't ask
l'm not being stubborn, Roopa.

218
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,080
Just promise me...
that you will never think

219
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,400
of suicide again
You and l will live together

220
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,400
and face whatever happens
If you are with me,

221
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,440
l can even de_ death
My dear Roopa! Relax. l'll go

222
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,440
and get something for you to eat
Why won't you go away?

223
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,120
You have been released
Don't you hear that?

224
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,280
- l do, but you haven't heard
Before l leave, l need a cigarette

225
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,000
and a match to light it
l need a cup of tea to drink,

226
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
and fare to take a bus-ride home
For a shave...

227
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,160
- Don't talk rubbish
This is a police station.

228
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,920
lt isn't a hotel or a restaurant
But it sure is a hotel for me.

229
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,760
Where eveything lands before me...
without even asking for it.

230
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,440
- Shut up!
The fun l find in the confines of

231
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,440
those four walls...
l can't find in the

232
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,920
free world outside!
You are worried here

233
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,360
about what l eat
And out there...

234
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,320
- Shut up!
The world is a big jail

235
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
and this is a small one
But they sure are jails.

236
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,720
- Shut up
See you again,

237
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,760
if God brings me here
God will give you a bountiful!

238
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,760
Please give me a penny! A penny!
You're young and able.

239
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,760
Aren't you ashamed to beg?
l'm in trouble, lady.

240
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Have mercy!
May you always have plenty!

241
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,360
- Get lost!
One penny!

242
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
What sort of a iob are
you doing, watchman?

243
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,400
How do filthy people like her get
here?

244
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,280
- Move it... go away!
Mercy...

245
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,760
You're not hurt, are you?
Get up

246
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Here you are.
- May God bless you

247
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,760
Go and find something to eat

248
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,160
''Society for A Better Woman''

249
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,800
''Helping women is our duty''

250
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Frauds!

251
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,800
Can't you see?
- Forgive me, Bawa (bawa=Parsis)

252
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,120
Where am l headed today...?

253
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,120
My hat!
- Your hat...?

254
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Friends of the poor, our biggest
patron Mrs Mithaiwala...

255
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,760
who has donated 5001 rupees for
the upliftment of women...

256
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,240
and a gold medal for the
best programme for the day...

257
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,960
has something to say to you.
Welcome, Mrs Mithaiwala

258
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
l'm not a rich woman...

259
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,160
l'm a poor woman. But l can't bear to
see atrocities inflicted on the poor

260
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,440
lsn't that right too?

261
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,440
l want all women in the world
to be happy

262
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,440
They must get good food to eat,
good clothes to wear

263
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,920
lsn't that right too?

264
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,080
The 5001 rupees l have donated
is towards this end...

265
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,240
so also is the gold medal
for the betterment of the poor

266
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,480
l want you all to work
for the upliftment of the poor

267
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,720
To ruin someone...? Sory!

268
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,320
To disappoint someone
is a grave sin

269
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,240
ln whatever form you pray to the
Lord,

270
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,720
He'll bless those He has to
What more will l say to you?

271
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,320
Pray to God that l get
Iots of money...

272
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,400
so that l can use it for
the help ofthe needy women

273
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:41,400
An unnamed lady wishes to perform
an item for the poor

274
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,120
Who is it...?

275
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,960
You? l was told you were arrested.

276
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,760
So what's new?
The police took me away...

277
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,200
and when they couldn't find any
evidence against me, they let me go

278
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Brother, l don't mind povem.
But give up this sinful life

279
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,240
What sinful life am l living?
When l'm hungy...

280
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,280
l ty and remain patient. But there's
a limit to someone's patience

281
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,160
My hunger shadows my eyes and l see
someone's pockets stuffed with money

282
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,360
And then, l go mad.
- Stop it, Rajan

283
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,880
You must give up this madness
for your sister's sake!

284
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,720
Starve, till you find
an honest meal. Be patient!

285
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,320
And when you can't take it anymore,
give up your life!

286
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,920
No... don't do that!
It's God who gives us life

287
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,160
What's gotten into you, Roopa?
Looks like you're famished

288
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,200
Wait till l go and
bring you some food

289
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Where will you get it from?
Do you have any money?

290
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,600
Money is always earned

291
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,200
l didn't have money to pay
for my bus-fare home

292
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,200
But God can't bear to see
the suffering of His devotees

293
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,960
l met a sympathiser who let me
have his motorcycle

294
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,880
And l'll find a sympathiser now
who'll provide us a meal

295
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,640
Friends of the poor, for the best
performance of the day...

296
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,640
this medal donated by
Mrs Mithaiwala goes to...

297
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,320
your name...?
- Videvi

298
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,960
lt goes to Miss Videvi.
Here you are

299
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Can l interview you
for my paper?

300
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,560
Sory, l'm an anonymous girl.
l'm not good enough to give

301
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,240
interviews
You're being too modest...

302
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,120
where do you stay?
l have yet to buy a place.

303
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,000
- But you do stay somewhere?
Yes, l'm staying at someone's place

304
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,000
faraway from here
No sweat. The newspaper has

305
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
given me a motorcycle
There's the motorcycle...

306
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,320
Now quietly go to your owner

307
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,600
Hello, Khan-saheb

308
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,760
Where's the 1000 bucks you owe me?
- 1000 ? Over there

309
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,960
Over there? What does that mean?

310
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:59,160
Just that l don't deposit my money in
a bank. l keep it in a gambling den!

311
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,960
Gambling den or anynrhere, l want
my money with interest. Now!

312
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,880
Now ?
- Yes, now. And here

313
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
What sure? l want my money.
- In that case...

314
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,560
let's have a round of cards.
Either square it, or double it

315
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,560
Don't talk rubbish! You borrow money
and also poke fun at me?

316
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,600
Strange man! Does anyone ask
for money on the streets?

317
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,600
Come to my house.
l'll treat you to some tea...

318
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,600
No tea! l want my money!
- Money?

319
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,000
What does that mean?
- Keep this motorcycle

320
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,360
When l have the money,
l'll take it away from you

321
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,600
Now that's something!
You seem to be an honest man

322
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,240
Undoubtedly

323
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,760
Someone took my motorcycle away.
- Nice

324
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,920
Your bike...? Over there

325
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,840
Two days ago, a ladies organisation
bought this medal from this vey shop

326
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,000
Yes, it's the same organisation that
rewarded me the medal for a

327
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,120
performance
Those who win medals in a prize,

328
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,160
don't sell them
They preserve the medals.

329
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,280
- What's that to you?
Give me the medal.

330
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,640
- Sure. We don't buy stolen stuff
Could you give me a ride?

331
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
- Why ask? Make yourself comfortable
Can't you see where you're going?

332
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,960
Please don't be angy.
Accidents do happen in life

333
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,040
Such accidents are vey rare.
- What do you mean?

334
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,560
People do fall off motorcycles,
but always at the wrong place

335
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,160
Some fall in gutters,
some fall in heap of garbage

336
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,160
l'm glad l fell...
- Be thanMul your life is saved

337
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,800
You're the one l must thank.
It was you who saved my life

338
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,760
Mister, come on!
- Go ahead

339
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,600
This is where l had to get off!
- So this is your junction?

340
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,040
A medal!
- Give it to me. It's mine

341
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Yours? It's vey nice.
Looks like it's gold

342
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Prem heavy too. Why do you keep
such precious stuff like that?

343
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,280
There's no dearth of pickpockets.
If someone snatches it...

344
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,920
you'll be left rubbing your hands.
l'm sory. Here you are

345
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,600
Excuse me...
- Yes?

346
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,160
You appear to be an honest man.
Can you help me sell this medal?

347
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,040
You want to sell this medal?
- l've been tying for so long

348
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,600
No one's giving me the right price.
- Give it to me

349
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,200
l'll get you the right price.
- Thanks

350
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,040
Wait here. l'll go with the medal
and come back with the dough

351
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,960
What are you looking at?
- It's vey nice, vey prem...

352
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,240
but the gold is adulterated.
- Adulterated, my foot

353
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,560
That's the usual stuff.
Tell me what it's worth

354
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,560
You are vey old customer for me.
And honesty, is my motto

355
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,560
lt must be worth 24 rupees
and 16 annas

356
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,920
Has the price of gold fallen?
- That is the price in this market

357
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,240
Here you are

358
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,240
My luck is reaching
for the skies today

359
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,200
Luck?
- Yes

360
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,560
lf luck's on your side,
you get all the moolah

361
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,880
Moolah!

362
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,960
Twenty

363
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,200
Fom

364
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,800
Eighty

365
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,960
Another blind

366
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,880
Don't gamble against 3 aces, Raian.
You'll get killed

367
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,480
9, 10 and Jack.
- Don't touch it

368
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,200
Let the money remain there.
- There it is. Take a look

369
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,840
Lord!

370
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,680
Three

371
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,160
Three

372
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
Three

373
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,840
Well, three-aces?
l could turn soil to gold today

374
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,520
Sure, you've made gold.
But l'm a dead man

375
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,120
Don't be a dead man, feller...
it's God who gives us life

376
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,160
l don't understand this

377
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,080
What do you want?

378
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
How much is the sweetmeat worth?
- 3 rupees for a kilo

379
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,040
How much do you want?
- l want to 2 sears

380
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,480
Ganpat, 2 sears of sweetmeat.
- But l don't have any cash

381
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,480
Give me a cheque in that case.
- l don't have the cheque either

382
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,840
That's okay. Give me your address.
l'll have the money collected

383
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,080
l'm an outsider.
You can keep these ear-rings

384
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,080
l'll collect them tomorrow.
- Don't say such things, my child

385
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
For 6 rupees, am l going to
take away your ear-rings?

386
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,480
lt's all right. Take the sweets,
l'll have my money later

387
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,080
Thank you.
- What for?

388
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Here's another 5 rupees. Maybe you
need to buy something else too

389
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,480
You do need money in an unknown city.
- Thank you vey much

390
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,840
l don't need to buy anything else.
Your kindness is enough for me

391
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,240
Wow! Laddoos!

392
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,120
Tell me the truth. Where did you
find the money for the food?

393
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,480
What a question! Don't you know
what my business is?

394
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh yes. You must have gambled.
What else can you do?

395
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,880
Where did you get the money to
gamble?

396
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,480
- Want the truth? Don't be angy
My victim was a prem girl today.

397
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,200
She was vey lucky for me
So you picked her pocket?

398
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,880
- Girls cary a purse
She was tying to sell a medal and

399
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,480
people thought it was stolen
l helped her sell the medal.

400
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,120
- And you betrayed her?
l wonder what hardships

401
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,120
the poor girl is facing
l speak the truth. l didn't want

402
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,080
to deceive her, when l sold the medal
But the moment l got the money,

403
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,080
the devil in me...
took me to the gambling den.

404
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,880
- Shut up! l can't eat this food
Believe me, sister. l forgot

405
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,120
all about that girl when l won
Maybe she's still waiting for her

406
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,840
l'll go and give her the money
and her medal too

407
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,160
A thief... but a good man
at heart

408
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,920
So much of food?
Who brought it, Roopa?

409
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,440
My brother came the moment you left.
- Your brother?

410
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,120
Yes. Your arrival brought back my
brother and quenched my hunger too

411
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,120
Hury up

412
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,880
Looks like you've been in luck today.
Or else, who buys back sold stuff

413
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,600
So give me 50 rupees
and take away the medal

414
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,880
l'll give you a tight slap!
It's just 25 rupees

415
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,600
You've been an old customer and
you know, honesty is our policy

416
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,120
There's a difference be_een
our purchase and sale prices

417
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,040
Damn you...
You act smart with me?

418
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,880
You don't know, l charge interest
for evey minute

419
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,480
And it's hours and minutes since
you sold the medal to me

420
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,160
Calculate that and
give me 50 rupees

421
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,800
No delay... the interest will mount

422
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,960
Honesty is your policy?

423
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,080
Bloody rat!
- So it's you!

424
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,080
lnspector! Why did you
take the trouble?

425
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,080
You're in trouble. You're going to
the police station with me

426
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
What is my crime?
- Selling stolen goods

427
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,400
But this medal wasn't mine,
Inspector.

428
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,400
Am l right, Gangadhar?
Why drag me into all that...?

429
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,000
Sort it out be_een yourselves
C'mon. Move it!

430
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,080
Me too?
- Yes you too

431
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,400
That which the Lord wishes,
always happens

432
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,400
That which the Lord wishes,
always happens

433
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,720
Where's the other guy?

434
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,160
So you're hiding? Even a criminal
has a sense of shame, l see

435
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,600
Yes, that's how it is.
- Do you recognise him?

436
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,440
Yes, he's the one.
- Yes, l'm the one

437
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,760
l'm the one who stole her medal.
Well? What's my punishment ?

438
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,400
lnspector, please do not pay
heed to what he says

439
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,000
l myself gave him the medal
to sell it away

440
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes!
- Yes, Inspector

441
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,040
This girl speaks the truth.
l vouch for her truthfulness

442
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,800
Constable, set him free

443
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,800
You may go now.
- Thanks. But l'll keep coming

444
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,720
See you again, if God
brings me here

445
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,520
Not you.
- No?

446
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,440
No. Go on inside.
- Thanks

447
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Shut the door, constable

448
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,200
Thanks for your sympathy. And l
thought you came to have me punished

449
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,760
You were wrong. Now go home and ty
to find a decent job

450
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,440
l tried finding a decent iob earlier.
l'll ty again

451
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,840
When l committed a theft,
l wasn't punished

452
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,440
And when l wanted to atone for my
wrongdoing, l was caught!

453
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,440
Hats off you to, God!
- Didn't you meet the girl?

454
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,440
She was the one who
had me released

455
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,440
She arrived there and got me
released.

456
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,600
- Where is she?
She came... and she left.

457
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,840
She must've been an angel
What are you telling me?

458
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,640
- Roopa...
Come, Beena. Where have you been?

459
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,480
- Beena? You?
She's the one who gave me

460
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,480
a new lease of life, brother
Beena, this is my brother.

461
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,080
- Oh yes, brother for you
And a thief for her.

462
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,080
- What is the matter?
It was her medal, Roopa.

463
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,480
Strange games of destiny
l didn't know, l was

464
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,680
deceiving a sympathiser
Forget what has happened.

465
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,800
lf you truly regret your sin...
you are not a sinner anymore

466
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,400
''The ticking of the clock
clearly tells me...''

467
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,400
''another moment of my life
has now been reduced''

468
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,400
Strange wheel of life, l say

469
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,000
lt isn't drawn by the bulls either.
But it flies by like an aircraft

470
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,680
True. Which is why l want Chand
to get married at the earliest

471
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,440
Who knows when the wheel of your
life might come to a standstill

472
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,640
What did you say?
My life coming to a standstill?

473
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,600
Have you considered who will
give you your pay, if l die?

474
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,720
Don't say such ominous things, sir.
Death be to your enemies

475
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,440
l was talking about life...
because you're an old man

476
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,120
Don't talk rubbish!
l'm no old man!

477
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,880
God preserve my virility...
old age is miles away

478
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,880
Death be to your enemies, Sir.
You're still a child

479
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,720
Even if l'm not into my childhood,
l'm surely into my youth

480
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,360
lf l still take someone's hand,
he cannot free himself

481
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,560
Splendid thing you've said.
- Great! You're a nice man

482
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,920
Come closer. If you ever need money,
ask me for it. Don't feel shy

483
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,880
Father...
- Come on in young man

484
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,000
See the girl, indeed!
Seen one?

485
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,760
l've brought the bride, father.
- l don't need a bride

486
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,840
You want me to mary at my age?
- What are you talking about?

487
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,560
My bride! Your daughter-in-law.
Give her your blessings

488
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,960
Giriia...
- Girija...

489
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,760
That sounds more like a church

490
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,400
She? She's my daughter-in-law?

491
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,400
He's my father-in-law?

492
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,680
ls she the one you've married?

493
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Chand, is this old man
your father?

494
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,040
Yes, this old man...

495
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,000
Had l known my father-in-law
was so old...

496
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,160
l'd never have married you!

497
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,360
Had l been young,
wouldn't l get married too?

498
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
See the old man?

499
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,120
l've come straight
from the airport

500
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,400
Congratulations.
- Thanks, thanks

501
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,640
Excuse me, he's not going
to introduce us

502
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,720
Let me introduce myself.
l'm Pran

503
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,400
Who l am and what l do,
you need not know

504
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,960
The truth is that l haven't had
a better friend than Chand

505
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Nor has Chand found someone
better than me. Right, Chand?

506
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
You're right.
Girija dear...

507
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,760
go upstairs and rest.
l've got to have a word with Pran

508
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,880
Nothing private... but we'd
like a bit of solitude

509
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,360
What brings you here?
- The same old reason

510
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,880
Times of inflation.
Low income and high expenditure

511
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,680
l need iust 5000 rupees.
- Just 5000 rupees!

512
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,880
l haven't a mint at home, Pran...
- For a young man...

513
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,960
his old father is the mint.
You're the only son...

514
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,680
you'll get whatever you ask for.
- l can't pay you right now, Pran

515
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,360
No? You will pay me.
You surely will

516
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,360
Are you using force?
- Not at all. What force?

517
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,360
You know, l'm a man of peace.
l don't raise my hand at anyone

518
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,960
You know the name of this magic?
- l'll bring it at once

519
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,560
5000, right?
- For the moment

520
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,000
My magic from Bengal!
Here comes 500O

521
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,680
Here's the 5000.
- A gift for your wedding

522
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,920
People normally give on weddings.
But friends like me take gifts

523
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,760
That reminds me of something

524
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,000
Keep the old man in good humour.
You must always have his blessings

525
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,320
lf you ever have a tiff
with your wife, send for me

526
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,680
l know of ways to sort
out marital fights

527
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,680
All right. Go away now

528
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,880
You didn't have to give up
the joy of having a father

529
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,000
But l had all that, and yet
l had to leave the house

530
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,320
Why did you do that, Beena?
- That's a long stoy

531
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,680
Suffice it to say that
l left the house...

532
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,680
with iust a few clothes
and my father's blessings

533
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,680
My revolt is no doubt an act
of a stubborn girl...

534
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,320
but it's also a challenge to
the waynrard young men

535
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,640
Who is it?

536
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,320
Ramu? What is it?

537
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,960
Nothing new.
It's the same old stoy

538
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,920
Where will l bring money
for you evey day?

539
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,520
Why do you need the money now?
- The biggest of the needs is hunger

540
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,720
The _enty rupees you gave me,
l spent on my daughter's illness

541
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,880
We don't have any provisions
at home, sir

542
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,320
Now look, Ramu. Don't ever think
that l'm one of Bombay's rich men

543
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,920
l myself look to others
for help

544
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,960
Here you are.
And ty to find a job, okay?

545
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,960
Vey well

546
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,320
Who was he, Raian?
- Someone in trouble, like us

547
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,920
Where did you get the money
you just gave him?

548
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,360
Wherever. Why are you bothered?
- You didn't have a penny this

549
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,880
morning
Why get angy? Just tell her

550
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,600
where you got the money from
What will he tell me? l know it.

551
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,600
He must've been gambling again
Gambling? So you gamble too?

552
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,960
-Yes, l do
Not because l'm greedy for wealth.

553
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,600
But l've got into a habit
You will kill someone and say

554
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,800
you're not a killer
That you've got into the habit.

555
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,280
- Do not embarrass me
l had to gamble. Or else, where would

556
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
we have got our provisions from?
How would Ramu's daughter

557
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,960
have got her medicines?
You think Ramu's daughter

558
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,280
has recovered?
You have given her poison,

559
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,840
not life-saving medicine
Since l'm staying here,

560
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,960
l'm bound to find a iob
You will also find some work

561
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,280
and Roopa will manage something too
We'll turn this house

562
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,880
into a little heavenly abode
How's the lady?

563
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,400
- Incomparable
Good in English too

564
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,920
Well, lady? Do you know
any song and dance?

565
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,000
Yes, l have been trained in
singing and dancing

566
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,600
Terrific!

567
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,840
So let's see a glimpse, Chhagan.
- She's good, sir

568
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,240
Have a contract typed and give
the lady an advance

569
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,840
That's all right. But what's
wrong in seeing what she's like?

570
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,600
Nothing wrong.
- Get the harmonium then

571
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,840
Not the harmonium.
Get me a taanpura, please

572
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,800
lncomparable! She's classical!

573
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,800
But forget classical stuff, lady.
Let's have something racy

574
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:49,720
Like, ''Enioy life,
the world belongs to you''

575
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,640
Chhagan, you've gone mad. Let the
Iady sing of her own accord

576
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,760
Fantastic! Splendid!

577
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,840
What a voice!
You're a nightingale!

578
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,200
God bless you!
Bless you!

579
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,720
Chhagan, have a 3-year contract
signed for the lady

580
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,200
On a retainership of 1000 rupees
and 24-hour job

581
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,200
1000 rupees?
You're a fortunate lady

582
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,240
The earlier actress started
at 100 rupees and died at 90O

583
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,240
But you're making a
beginning at 1000 rupees!

584
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,720
Chhagan, the lady's classical.
- All the way!

585
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,240
Forgive me, l can't sign
the contract today

586
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,880
What's the problem?
- It's not a nice day

587
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,440
l'll come tomorrow.
- Chhagan, the lady has left

588
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,760
All the way!

589
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,880
Terrible times!
A grave sin!

590
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,760
Come here... l haven't seen such
shamelessness in my life!

591
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,760
Lord!
- What happened?

592
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,520
A sin! A grave sin!
- What happened, sir?

593
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,720
lt's that lady in the house.
- What's happened to her?

594
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,760
She's the one things are happening
to.

595
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,480
Sir, those whose night begins
at midnight, start the day at noon

596
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,240
She's the modern daughter-in-law.
She'll wake up at ten...

597
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,880
take a bath at _elve,
and at 2...

598
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,880
What?
- It's the strange name...

599
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,760
the lady calls her afternoon meal.
May God bless your virility...

600
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,880
it's a strange name...
Oh yes, ''loonch!''

601
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,200
Moron, it's lunch. Not ''loonch'' !

602
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,520
Bearer, get me cup of tea

603
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,200
Father, send for some more tea.
This one is for Girija

604
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,200
Listen here! Is it written on the tea
that only Girija can drink it?

605
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,600
Must be feminine stuff!

606
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,640
Ass, if anyone saw you in this state,
he'd never believe you're the son...

607
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,640
of Rai Saheb Jwalaprasad, the
moneybags, who has returned from

608
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:09,120
Burma!
He'd rather say you're

609
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,120
the son of a butler!
What have you started so early

610
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,480
in the morning, father?
Should l rather start it

611
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,240
in the evening?
Moron! How would you know what

612
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,720
hopes l had pinned on you
When you were born, l threw a pam

613
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,680
for half of Rangoon
You remember?

614
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,320
- Oh yes. Vividly, too
When you first went to school...

615
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,520
l distributed sweets
from Burma to India

616
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,720
lndeed! Sweetmeat vendors in Burma
built huge mansions

617
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,760
When you completed your
matriculation,

618
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,160
l had alms given away...
at temples, mosques and churches!

619
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:49,760
Did l do all that to see my son...
becoming a waiter for his wife?

620
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:55,520
She keeps snoring in bed...
and you run to her service

621
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,760
with a tray in your hand!
Father! This is the limit!

622
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,320
Whatever you say to me,
l will tolerate it

623
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,840
But do keep quiet
about my wife!

624
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,760
Why must l remain quiet?
She isn't just your wife

625
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,120
She's my...
daughter-in-law too!

626
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,520
That doesn't mean
you must poke fun at her

627
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,120
What fun will l poke at her?
She's a bad joke anynray

628
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,160
Chand, let the old man babble away.
Come on upstairs with the tea

629
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,480
Sinful times! A daughter-in-law calls
her young father-in-law an old man!

630
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,760
God preserve my virility!
Old age is miles away

631
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,160
And l won't become an old man
because that sparkler says so

632
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,160
What are you doing nowadays?
- l'm doing nothing

633
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,160
l'm looking for a iob, however.
- You're looking for a job?

634
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,720
lt's true. l was offered a iob at
a theatre, at 1000 rupees a month

635
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,560
You turned it down?
- Yes. 1000 rupees is a big amount

636
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,400
But there is something bigger.
My self-respect

637
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,640
Devi, l understand. It's our good
fortune that you came here on your

638
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,400
OWn
Our society needs someone who will

639
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:13,440
organise art programmes...
and also train these girls. Are you

640
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:17,720
400 rupees? This is more than
the 1000 rupees l was offered

641
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,560
This iob offers respect, money
and the satisfaction of service

642
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,080
lt's time for the show, Raian.
Just fifteen minutes left

643
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,440
Will you drive faster?
- Okay

644
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,680
Stop, Raian!

645
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,680
You're a stubborn girl! How will
you perform in this state?

646
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,000
l'll do what l have to. Or else,
our organisation will get a bad name

647
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,680
People will break the
furniture in the auditorium

648
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,600
People have started getting restless.
- Won't they be livid...

649
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
when you go on the stage
with a face like that?

650
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,000
You will fall on the stage!
Let me perform in your place

651
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,600
What will you do?
- Don't wory

652
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,320
l'll make them laugh
and cool things down

653
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,440
Brothers!

654
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,040
Friends!

655
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,520
Buddies!

656
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,680
l'm here to say something
in your own welfare

657
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,680
Could you tell me why
you folks have come here?

658
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,320
To see Devi dance!
- Exactly!

659
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,320
l too want you to see
Devi's dance performance

660
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,240
Why won't we see it?
We've bought tickets!

661
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:27,280
lndia's leading dancer Devi
will perform a dance

662
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,960
Please be seated

663
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,280
Lallu's mother!
- Yes?

664
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,360
Open the door!
- First tell me your name!

665
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:51,360
l'm your husband.
Shivcharan Das

666
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,000
So you're drunk again?
Damn you!

667
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,320
l haven't drunk any liqour

668
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,600
l've merely sprinkled some
on my whiskers

669
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,400
God! Save me!

670
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,360
Open the door!
l'm feeling cold

671
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,960
Unless you give up drinking,
l'm not opening that door!

672
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,680
lt's almost four and
Rajan hasn't arrived

673
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,240
Don't tell me! The watches of
Switzerland could go wrong

674
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,080
But Raian will never
forget the time

675
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,640
''l fell in love
with the bottle...''

676
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,880
''sure was a bad thing to do...''

677
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,080
''all l have at home now
is fights and arguments''

678
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,680
Hello!
- Welcome, buddy

679
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,080
You're the one we were waiting for.
l swear...

680
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,680
my luck is terrible today.
Ty yours, come on

681
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,120
Sit down.
- Deal me a hand!

682
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,080
l'm going to blow you guys away!
- Really?

683
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,160
Let's see the money.
- Here you are

684
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,680
How are you feeling?
Did you have the medicine?

685
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,680
Medicine?
- It's lying as it is

686
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,080
Where's Raian?
- Rajan?

687
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,320
l went to sleep. He must be
somewhere around

688
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,640
He doesn't care for his ailing
sister.

689
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,640
- So what's new, Beena?
But why did he leave you

690
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,160
in this state?
What was so important?

691
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,320
- He alone knows what he does
l thought he had

692
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,120
given up his old ways
But a disease that has

693
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
taken over the system...
cannot be cured so soon

694
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,640
Till now, we only reasoned with him.
But that's not working

695
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,960
Roopa, l'll return in a little while.
- Where will you go, Beena?

696
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,320
lt's futile looking for him.
He must be at a place...

697
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,840
which isn't safe for you to visit.
- l'll go there too

698
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,840
Maybe he'll be ashamed to see me
at a place like that

699
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,360
You think l'm a kid?
This is not my card

700
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,240
Come to my senses, Raian.
l never make a mistake

701
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,120
And my eyes can't be deceived either.
- Forget it, Rajan

702
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,840
You're mistaken.
- l know you, Pran. Look

703
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,200
Eight and nine. The third card
is a Queen

704
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,320
But this isn't my card.
That one is mine

705
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,200
The one this rascal swapped.
It must surely be a ten

706
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,960
This prince is now claiming
to be a victim

707
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,600
As if he could close his eyes and
tell us the whole stoy

708
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,640
lf that's how it is,
Iet's open the card

709
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,000
Take a look! It's a ten!

710
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,000
The _o of you are hand in glove.
Return my money to me!

711
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,360
Or else, l'll lay your bodies here!
- Here's another Hitler, l say!

712
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,240
Raian, you mustn't blame others
because you can't play

713
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,640
Even if what you say is true,
it doesn't mean we're cheats

714
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,000
You are indeed a cheat! Whatever l
have lost is because you've cheated!

715
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,160
Return my money to me!
- Shut up!

716
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,160
Raian, come with me

717
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,200
The Goddess of Beauty?
At this place?

718
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,320
Raian, l've won a lot of money today

719
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,280
But l wouldn't
regretted losing either

720
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,280
What a figure, what a face...!

721
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,640
l thought you had come
to the right path

722
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,360
But what l saw today
tells me...

723
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,640
that even if the world changes,
you will not change

724
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,640
lt's true that l haven't changed.
But l have really made the effort

725
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,640
What good is an effort
that does not succeed?

726
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,760
lf an ailing man dies despite
getting the best of treatment...

727
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,160
it's neither his fault,
nor the doctor's

728
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,680
Beena, ever since you have
come into this house...

729
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,680
l have done my best
to give up my bad habits

730
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,080
But despite my good intentions,
at the stroke of four...

731
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,240
my feet start moving
towards the gambling den

732
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,680
My heart tries to stop me,
it shackles my feet

733
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,120
But my brains break the shackles.
l'm not bad at heart

734
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:05,200
lt keeps telling me to reform.
But my dim mind kills the feelings

735
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,040
lt was a dream

736
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,360
How l wish it were true

737
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,720
l'd rather have married a lamp-pole
than getting married to you!

738
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:56,200
Both of us would've been happy then.
Your airs and dad's stick...

739
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,040
l'm sandwiched be_een the _o of
you!

740
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,040
- Pran...
you're such a wicked man to be

741
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,640
angy with a tender wife like her
You've got to take care

742
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
of such fragile things
Where did you spring from?

743
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:18,360
l'm but a slave of yours.
Like servants...

744
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,680
come to you for rewards on festivals,
l too come calling once in a while

745
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:28,160
l'm broke nowadays, Chand. If you
could help, it'd solve my problem

746
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,000
You're not getting
another penny from me!

747
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:36,680
So that's how it is?
The jackal turns into a lion?

748
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,440
Chand, you know
l wield a magic wand...

749
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
that can turn the lion
into a jackal again. Look

750
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,680
Put that in your pocket.
l'll go and get it

751
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,360
''Secrets of Marriage''

752
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,400
The moron!

753
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,640
Pran, l've brought a necklace.
Go away before my wife comes here

754
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,880
What will l do with a necklace?

755
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,240
Your wife's necklace!
That's all right

756
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,640
l want money, even if you sell your
wife's necklace or your old man's

757
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:16,640
ring
Your wife after all.

758
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Whom will she help, if not you?
Here's your book of secrets.

759
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,200
What insolence is this?
- No insolence. It's tea

760
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,640
l can also see it's tea,
but why interrupt my shirsh-aasan?

761
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,240
l have heard of so many aasans...
but what's a shirsh-aasan?

762
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,600
How would you know
what shirsh-aasan is?

763
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,240
lt's meant for youngsters like me.
- Strange

764
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:54,240
l've heard of an animal which
hangs upside down at night

765
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:02,040
Are you comparing me to a bat?
Ass, you don't know...

766
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,840
shirsh-aasan is a boon granted
by sages and saints

767
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,600
When l was a young man...
- You mean you're old now

768
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,600
God preserve my virility.
Old age is miles away

769
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:20,360
l mean, when l was vey young,
l did 101 push ups evey morning

770
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:26,960
l used the heavy club 50 times.
And 180 minutes l spent in

771
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:32,880
shirsh-aasan
Later, l'd have over a litre of cow

772
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,240
milk, buffalo milk and goat milk...
in all, more than 3 litres

773
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,920
of milk in one gulp
Guess what l ate with the milk?

774
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,680
- What?
Ass! No tea after a work- out!

775
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,880
After a work out one eats almonds.
l used to have 101 almonds...

776
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:54,240
ground on a white grinding-stone

777
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,880
Not even the devils eat so much, sir!
With that much...

778
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,280
it would explode a man's size.
- Explode it...?

779
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:09,760
You are so naive! You are a kid,
you are hare-brained

780
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,280
As a result of my work-out
and diet...

781
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:18,800
l defeated the strongest of wrestlers
in the world, at the age of 18

782
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:25,640
Guess who? Mirza Abu Baig of Turkey.
Don lebesko of England...

783
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,720
Ching Chong of Korea,
Ming Mong of Manchuria...

784
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:37,640
and Ping Pong of Persia! l slayed
all of them with my bare hands!

785
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,240
And then came the one...
- Who?

786
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,240
He came at me like this,
l advanced like this...

787
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,680
He kept a hand on my neck,
l held his neck too...

788
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
l shook his hand off and
went for his neck...

789
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,240
he tried the same,
and his neck broke

790
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,840
Tell me his name.
- Don't ask. l held his head...

791
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,760
pressed him to the ground
with my knee on him...

792
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,920
l gave him a heave,
and it broke his spine!

793
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,560
Tell me his name.
- Don't ask

794
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,920
He then came for me,
so did l...

795
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:21,800
l grabbed his hair and pulled.
It came unstuck. He went bald!

796
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,000
What was his name?

797
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,400
His name was Dara Singh

798
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,400
C'mon!

799
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,760
That's foul!

800
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,520
The fourth round of the bout

801
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,880
Two

802
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,240
Three

803
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,200
Four

804
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Five

805
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,800
Six
- Start the count again

806
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,760
Seven
- Start again

807
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,600
Water...

808
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:50,200
Sir, do you want me to get cow,
buffalo and goat milk?

809
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,200
My throat is parched and you're
thinking of milk? Get me water!

810
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,560
Do you want me to get 101 almonds?

811
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,880
You want to kill the old man
by feeding him so many almonds?

812
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,800
What farce is this?
This is a bloody wrestling ring!

813
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,640
Listen sparkler, don't
talk too much

814
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,880
lt's my house. Not your father's.
Go and get some water

815
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,880
Oh yes, give him
a bucket full of water

816
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:38,640
Waiting for you has
taught me a lesson

817
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:43,200
lt's dusk from dawn,
and yet you haven't come

818
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,520
Greetings. Please sit down

819
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,200
You've probably never heard of me
nOl Seen Me

820
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,600
l can't remember anything.
- How will you?

821
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:05,360
You're a Goddess of Art.
And l'm merely a devotee of your art

822
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,200
The Goddess can forget her devotee.
But the devotee...

823
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:16,680
sees his Goddess all the time.
Lest you think l'm flattering you...

824
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,240
it's true that not even death can
stop

825
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:24,920
me from attending your performance
Thanks for the admiration.

826
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:29,480
- l present my salutations...
and also wish to say that l haven't

827
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:34,040
come here for my selfish needs
It's your talent and your love...

828
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,760
l mean, your love for your art...

829
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,800
l wish to present you something
vey humble for that

830
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,760
lt isn't humble. It looks like
a vey expensive necklace

831
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,680
Oh yes, it's vey expensive.
But why must you wory about that?

832
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:52,560
lt's iust a token of appreciation.
Please accept it

833
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,800
Excuse me, but this necklace,
Mr Jwalaprasad...?

834
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:04,800
What a thing to say! It couldn't
belong to any Tom, Dick and Hary

835
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,960
lt belongs to the family collection.
In Queen Victoria's time...

836
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:14,040
my grandfather had four Englishmen
make it for my grandmother

837
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:18,600
Perhaps someone called Jwalaprasad
has an imitation of this necklace

838
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,200
lt's the age for duplicates.
Anything goes

839
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,720
Beena...
- Excuse me, l'll be back in a moment

840
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,200
What is it, Roopa?

841
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:39,440
l must go, Roopa. Someone
is waiting for me

842
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,800
Chand...?

843
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,240
Jwalaprasad...?

844
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,240
You...? Welcome

845
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:42,560
Please sit down. Maybe you think,
l'm still a bachelor

846
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,880
You will be disappointed to know
that l'm the husband...

847
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,920
of a girl far prettier than you are.
- Congratulations to you

848
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,560
Maybe your wife is prettier
and more fashionable than l am

849
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,840
But beauty for me
means something else

850
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,760
You may build castles in the air.
What can l do for you?

851
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,840
There's a secret l need your help
to shed light on

852
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,880
My help to shed light on a secret?
Am l a detective from Scotland Yard?

853
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,280
No, you are the culprit

854
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:17,880
Do you recognise this diay?
- How did you get it?

855
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,200
Stay away from me

856
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:23,200
How did this land with you?
What have you to do with him?

857
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,560
Thanks, l don't need to
know anything more. Good bye

858
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,520
You can't take the diay away!
- See the girl indeed!

859
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,600
Seen one?

860
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,240
Bless you! In my house...?

861
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,760
God brings her to my house.
l gape at her and...

862
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:46,760
my son. See the girl indeed!

863
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,800
Sit down, my child

864
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,520
Well? What brings you
to this house today?

865
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:56,680
Fortunate for me to have a virtuous
girl like you set foot in my house!

866
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:00,840
Makardhwai! Get tea, coffee...
- No thank you

867
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:05,240
l was passing by and
just dropped in

868
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:10,240
l'll come again some day.
- Bless you, but you must surely come

869
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,520
Treat it like your own house

870
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,840
My diay?

871
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,920
See the girl indeed!

872
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:29,560
Chand! l'm ruined!
l've been robbed!

873
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,720
Listen to that,
you do have ears

874
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,600
Look at that,
you do have eyes

875
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,880
Here was this girl.
One glimpse of her...

876
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:48,000
told me that she was an angel.
And there's your madam Girija

877
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,800
She's calling you all the names
in just a moment

878
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,440
Chand! l'm ruined!
l'm robbed!

879
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,920
See the girl indeed!

880
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,920
Where is it?

881
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,240
What's happening here?
You act as if you are possessed!

882
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,240
This is no time for iokes!
My necklace has been stolen

883
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:24,520
How could it be stolen?
You have the keys to your cupboard

884
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,840
Has the earth swallowed it?
- How would l know?

885
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,840
l've looked eve_here.
- l'm glad it has been stolen

886
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,840
That necklace was worn by goddesses
like my mother and grandmother

887
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,200
You were not worthy of it!
- Chand dear...

888
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,240
the necklace has been stolen!
l'm sure your father has sold it

889
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:43,720
He doesn't want me to wear it!
- Keep this sparkler on a leash

890
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:47,000
How dare she accuse me of
theft in my own house?

891
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,000
A baker's daughter points
a finger at me?

892
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,880
This is gross iniustice!

893
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:55,240
After Bengal and Bihar, to raise
money for the charity fund...

894
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,560
Devi performs here in this city

895
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,240
''Devi's love affair''

896
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,240
What insolence is this?
Who are you?

897
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:35,240
Tell me, who gave you
this news about Devi?

898
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,240
l can't tell you!
- Shut up!

899
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:39,640
lf you don't,
l'll wring your neck!

900
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,840
Don't be angy. Please sit down.
Should l send for some tea?

901
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,680
Just give me the answer
to my question!

902
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:49,240
What's the answer, sir...?
l'll give you all the evidence

903
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,640
''Ways to Peace''

904
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:20,200
''Come to me, O slumber...''

905
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,240
Coward, scoundrel! Speak up now!
- Let me go, else...

906
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:43,640
Else what? You'll call the police?
You'll be dead before they arrive!

907
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,560
Let me go, l say!
- Sure, l will

908
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,920
Father! Giriia...

909
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:53,920
See the fun of giving
Beena a bad name?

910
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,960
ls there any other false news
you can give the editor?

911
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,240
Thief! Thief!

912
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,680
You've turned this house
into a race-course!

913
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,880
He was out to kill your son!
Why don't you call the police?

914
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,280
Why are you standing silently?

915
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:23,800
Are you a thieR Were you
here to rob or kill someone?

916
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,880
l'm not a thief.
l was here to take revenge...

917
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,200
from your son for slinging
mud at an innocent girl

918
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,760
What's all this about, Chand?
- Nothing, father

919
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,760
So what's the fuss...?

920
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,600
Nobody's calling the police!
No one cares for my Chand!

921
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:51,200
Shut up, girl.
There's no need to call the police

922
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,200
Leave him alone!
- Don't!

923
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,760
He's a bandit!
He should be hanged!

924
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,240
Leave him alone, l say!
- Thanks

925
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,920
What a difference
be_een father and son

926
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:06,840
Why did you let him go, father?
Are you out of your mind?

927
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,240
He was never in his senses
go to mad now!

928
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:13,240
Girl! Watch your manners.
If l lose my temper...

929
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,520
you'll lose the bread and butter
you get in your bed evey morning

930
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,840
See the girl indeed

931
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:25,600
lt's a small wound.
It'll heal soon

932
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,840
Why did you have to risk
your life for my sake?

933
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,520
Do you think l value my life
more than your honour?

934
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:38,880
l don't want any big amount.
l need just 5000 rupees

935
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,880
Days when you could blackmail me
are gone, Pran

936
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:47,480
l'm not giving you a penny.
l have seen that letter with Beena

937
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:53,840
Remember, Chand. l'm Pran.
l'll have that letter back vey soon

938
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,840
We'll see when that happens.
You may go now

939
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:59,400
Want me to show you the door?
- You talk back at me?

940
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:03,840
Don't be silly. l can take 5000
from you even without the letter

941
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,560
What is the matter?

942
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:15,600
l will leave now, Chand.
l'll deal with you later

943
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,680
What is the matter?
- How will l explain!

944
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:24,640
Problems and problems... l wonder
who will get us out of this mess

945
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:30,520
Problems for you. Not for me.
- You are part of it too

946
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:44,720
Don't wory. You take your Giriia
to be an innocent doll

947
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,880
lf l wish, l can make
the mountains bow to us

948
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:51,720
Mountains are for
mountain climbers, darling

949
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,600
That letter with Beena looks
like Everest to me

950
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,240
l wonder what that letter contains
to make you wory so much

951
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,360
Whatever it is, l'll
take that letter from Beena

952
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,680
Beena is no kid, darling.
- Neither am l

953
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,240
l could make a thousand Beenas
dance to my tunes

954
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,880
lf you could do that,
life would be fun!

955
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,920
We'll have all the happiness!

956
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:16,240
You...? l don't understand

957
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,920
You came and left
like a storm yesterday

958
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:22,160
l'll explain that later.
Where is my diay?

959
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:26,160
Your diay...?
When did you give it to me?

960
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:29,840
Don't pretend to be innocent.
My diay got left behind yesterday

961
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,160
Strange diay that gets left behind
when it wishes to

962
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:37,200
Are you talking about the leather
case?

963
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:41,200
- Yes, that's the one
l'll fetch it immediately.

964
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,880
l wondered who had left it behind
Here you are.

965
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:53,880
lsn't this the one?
Where's the diay?

966
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,200
- Which diay?
Do not ty to fool me, Beena

967
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:01,000
Watch your tongue, Mister. You can't
speak like this to someone in his

968
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,880
house
Why would l go through

969
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,600
someone else's belongings?
Forgive me, maybe l've

970
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,880
forgotten it somewhere else
l'll find the diay.

971
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,760
Where will it go?
See you again

972
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,920
Strange man! But why did he
Ieave so suddenly?

973
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:21,200
Maybe he was scared of you.
- Me?

974
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:25,520
What has he to do with me?
Do l scare people away?

975
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,200
l don't understand this, Roopa

976
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,200
My life was always run
by other people

977
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,520
Especially the rich

978
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:40,520
l couldn't understand why you were
sympathetic to me the other night

979
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:47,520
Young man, behind that sympathy is
a painful incident in my life

980
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:52,440
The moment l saw the
injuy on your arm...

981
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:58,880
l was reminded of the days when
l was a contractor in Burma

982
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:05,480
l was away from home one evening,
when my house caught fire

983
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:12,240
Only my wife and my only son
were at home at that time

984
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:15,240
What happened then?
- The fires were e_inguished

985
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,240
But my wife was killed

986
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:24,160
l could save my son's life
with great difficulty

987
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,680
He had an iniuy like that
on his arm too

988
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:33,840
When l saw blood flowing
from that injuy...

989
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:39,480
my heart felt so much anguish,
l still haven't forgotten it

990
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:46,720
That's the reason. Whenever
l see someone's injuy...

991
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,720
l am reminded of the iniuy
my heart has taken

992
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:57,200
You do have a compassionate heart
which understands others' feelings

993
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,600
There is still humanity
in the world

994
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:07,200
Please grant me your leave now.
- Do drop in sometimes, son

995
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,200
Good bye.
- Good bye

996
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:25,840
What are you reading so intently?
- Alibaba's tales

997
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,640
l'll read it out to you some day.
- Really?

998
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:38,240
Know a secret? During our days
of romance...

999
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,760
l got my hands on
a diay in your house

1000
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:43,240
lt has the effect of magic

1001
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:46,680
But that diay is now with
your cunning friend

1002
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:50,240
To get it back, l'll have to pretend
to be in love with you again

1003
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:53,920
When the time comes,
l even call an ass my father

1004
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,960
Roopa, you must forgive me
for my mistake

1005
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,600
Roopa, it is the return
of the prodigal

1006
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,280
My life is an album of sins.
There is no trace of goodness

1007
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,800
l have committed a thousand sins,
the worst of them being...

1008
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,280
the betrayal l handed out
to a goddess like you

1009
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:16,960
You have always treated me like God.
You have worshipped me

1010
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:20,720
But like Satan, l spurned
your worship

1011
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,200
But l'm not the Pran of old.
The devil is dead

1012
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,200
Forgive me, dear...
- No

1013
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:31,800
lf you really forgive me,
it'll give me peace

1014
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:35,880
Pran, you are my lord and master.
Do not touch my feet

1015
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:40,560
l belong at your feet, Pran.
- No, Roopa. You are a goddess

1016
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Do not call a fiend
your lord and master

1017
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:47,720
Give me a curse. A curse that will
turn my sinful body into ashes

1018
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,240
No, Pran!

1019
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:55,240
When l am born again,
with a new soul...

1020
01:56:55,520 --> 01:57:00,240
l will appreciate your love.
- For my sake, don't say such things

1021
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:03,600
l have love for you.
l can't cure you

1022
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:07,840
You are my lord.
-You are a goddess of compassion

1023
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:12,920
And l'm scum from the gutters!
If you do believe my love...

1024
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,280
here's proof of it.
- What's this, Pran?

1025
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,480
lt's the gift of my love
that has now awakened

1026
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:24,240
lt's so beautiful.
- Give it to me

1027
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:26,640
l'll personally make you wear it

1028
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:32,560
Reminds me. Do you have a proper safe
to preserve such precious jewelley?

1029
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:35,760
Of course, Pran. Look at the
wonderful safe we've got

1030
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,560
How is it?
- Wonderful

1031
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:45,880
l needn't wory that the symbol of
my love will be stolen by someone

1032
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,880
You have a bad cough, Pran.
- It's the punishment...

1033
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:01,440
for betraying a goddess like you!
Water... warm water!

1034
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,280
My magic wand!

1035
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:38,240
Even water from a goddess
is like elixir

1036
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:41,240
One sip, and the cough
has disappeared

1037
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:46,640
Grant me your leave now.
l'm vey happy today

1038
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,240
l have my wish

1039
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:54,920
Makardhwai! Where the hell are you?
The barrister still hasn't arrived!

1040
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:56,760
Yes, sir?.

1041
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:01,240
He should be coming any moment.
But why do you need him today?

1042
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:05,920
Are you fighting a case?
- A serious case

1043
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,840
What happened?

1044
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:12,600
What else? Come closer

1045
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:20,200
You are a loyal servant. Don't tell
anyone what l'm going to tell you

1046
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:23,200
l'm going away to Kashi.
- When will you come back?

1047
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:25,760
l'm not coming back at all!

1048
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,200
l'm renouncing the world

1049
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,720
Renouncing the world
at such a young age?

1050
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:37,720
Makardhwai, you are the only one
who appreciates my youth

1051
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:41,720
The truth is, l'm fed up
ofthis world of sinners

1052
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:45,200
l want to live at a place
where there is no one else

1053
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,800
Makardhwai, come closer.
- Sure

1054
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:52,800
l've seen enough of this farce. l
only

1055
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:57,240
want to chant the name of the Lord
Praise the Lord...

1056
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,440
Greetings, sir.
- The lord is here!

1057
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:13,680
Barrister? l've been waiting for you.
Please take a seat

1058
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:18,600
Anything important?
- This is vey important, barrister

1059
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:22,200
Makardhwai, get some coffee

1060
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:27,760
l want to make a will.
- Why do you need to do that?

1061
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:31,200
You have an only son.
- Good morning, barrister

1062
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,200
Why did you come here
without my permission?

1063
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:36,720
Can't you see l'm at some
vey private work?

1064
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,720
l'm having my will made.
- What for, father?

1065
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,880
Who the hell are you to ask me?
Go and polish your wife's sandals!

1066
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,240
See the girl indeed!

1067
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:51,240
Barrister, l wish to bequeath
half my wealth to an orphanage

1068
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,760
My bank balance must go
to Makardhwaj

1069
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:00,640
One third of the other half
must go to Chand

1070
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:04,240
Father, such a small share for me?
- Shut up

1071
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:07,880
Else, l'll give you zero!
See the girl indeed!

1072
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:14,240
One third of the half must go in
making a gym for budding wrestlers

1073
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:19,280
So that no weak-minded and weak-kneed
children like Chand are born again

1074
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:22,520
Father, what's gotten into you?
You have no idea what it'll do to us!

1075
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:26,880
l know what's going to happen!
With my money...

1076
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,920
you will see a few English films,
take your wife to the ballroom...

1077
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:34,200
and when it's all over,
you'll love on air

1078
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:38,720
You will then think of your father.
In tears!

1079
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:42,880
Father, l need your support.
l'd be ruined without you

1080
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,920
lf l don't renounce the world...

1081
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:47,880
your wife is going to
make my old age miserable

1082
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:50,800
God preserve your youth.
Why do you say such things?

1083
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:53,520
Makardhwai, it slipped
out of my mouth

1084
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,920
l'm sory, barrister.
- That's all right

1085
02:01:57,400 --> 02:02:01,800
Mr Contractor, do not be hasty.
Think it over

1086
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:04,240
He's your only son

1087
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:11,560
What if l had _o sons like him?
Keep your sympathy to yourself

1088
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:14,920
Quietly prepare the will,
collect your fees and leave

1089
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:17,240
Vey well, sir

1090
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:19,520
l'll have the will prepared
in a day or _o

1091
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,680
All right. Good bye

1092
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:26,160
Are you here to meet Beena?
- Yes. Isn't she there?

1093
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,520
She's away at the institute.
Is it something important?

1094
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:33,440
lt is vey important.
l must meet her

1095
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,200
Where did you get that necklace?
- Mind your manners. What's it to

1096
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:42,200
you?
Tell me quietly who gave

1097
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:45,560
that necklace to you
It's my necklace. Why must you

1098
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,800
bother who gave it to me?
l'll tell you why l bother.

1099
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,480
Tell me his name first!
Who the hell are you to ask me?

1100
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:54,200
- Tell me his name quickly...
or l'll be the worst yet!

1101
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:57,800
- Go to hell!
You can act smart in your house.

1102
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,880
But remember...
if Chand has given you the necklace,

1103
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,800
l'll drag you to court!
l don't know who Chand is.

1104
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,600
To hell with him
Why must l care about him?

1105
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,200
- Don't ty to fool me
What have you to do with Chand?

1106
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,720
- To hell with Chand and you
It's Pran who gave me this necklace.

1107
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,920
- Pran?
How did the necklace

1108
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:21,520
land with Pran?
l'll fix you!

1109
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:26,520
l'll fix him too!
Madam! At my humble abode...?

1110
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:28,920
Welcome
l have urgent business

1111
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,760
with you
You come to see me for the

1112
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:34,680
first time, on urgent business
Please be seated.

1113
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,440
- l want you to answer a question
You will have the answer.

1114
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,200
What is the question?
l want to know how my necklace

1115
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:43,200
landed with you
Your necklace with me...?

1116
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:45,720
What are you tying to say?
Don't ty to evade the question

1117
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:50,520
How did my necklace fall in your
hands?

1118
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,760
- l wish it had fallen in my hands
But you never gave me

1119
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:57,240
the golden chance
Don't you know anything

1120
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:01,760
about the necklace Roopa has?
Roopa...? Nice name.

1121
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:05,720
ls it a girl?
So you don't know Roopa either?

1122
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:15,240
- l don't know anyone of that name
Madam, l'm not as intelligent

1123
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:19,480
and cunning as your husband Mr Chand
He has the numbers of all the girls.

1124
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:25,840
- What do you mean?
Obviously, you are vey naive,

1125
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:33,160
despite being so modern and simple
Your husband Chand is a womaniser

1126
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:37,720
of the first order
You're blaming my husband for

1127
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:42,720
You ought to know that your
husband's true name is Dosharoof

1128
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:46,760
Despite being a married man, he's
blowing up his father's money on

1129
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:50,200
WOMen
There isn't a girl in town

1130
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:53,880
he doesn't flirt with
Chand must surely have given Roopa

1131
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:57,720
the necklace you're talking about
Oh yes, he has squandered away

1132
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,880
all the iewelley of his family
l'm sory, despite being

1133
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,600
the lady of the house...
you can't save it from destruction.

1134
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,800
l'm vey sory for you
What is it, Beena?

1135
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:25,240
Did someone come here after l left?
- Yes, Beena. He was here

1136
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:28,560
Who's he?
- He... how will l tell you

1137
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:31,800
Ever since you have arrived,
my life has changed

1138
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:34,400
Raian is giving up
his bad habits...

1139
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,840
and the love l had lost
has come back to me

1140
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,640
The love you had lost?
- Have you forgotten?

1141
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,480
l once told you about Pran?
He has come back to me

1142
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:46,240
And you brought him into this room
to show him evey nook and corner

1143
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:50,400
Beena, have l made a mistake?
l've never seen you so angy

1144
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,840
No, Roopa. What l mean to say is
that when a man comes into our

1145
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:59,280
lOOM...
things ought to be in order.

1146
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:03,640
Look at the things lying scattered
He doesn't pay attention to all this.

1147
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:08,280
He's a vey broad-minded man
He surely must be.

1148
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:10,600
l'm going out
Don't wait for me at dinner

1149
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:16,920
Take this!
- The diay? Wow!

1150
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:21,640
Take this, this and this...
l don't need anything you gave me!

1151
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:26,200
l spit at your wealth and riches!
A hundred times!

1152
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:30,200
Tell me what happened?
- l don't even want to see your face

1153
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,400
You keep following me around...

1154
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:36,920
and behind my back, you
gave the necklace to Roopa!

1155
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:39,840
Roopa? Which Roopa?
l swear, l don't know any Roopa!

1156
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:43,800
l know it all.
You know evey Roopa in town!

1157
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:48,920
l'm sure someone has instigated you.
Don't lose your senses like this!

1158
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:52,640
l don't know any Roopa,
nor am l seeing any girl

1159
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,840
Did my necklace fly to her then?
- l was the one who gave it away

1160
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:58,240
But it was to Pran, not to Roopa.
- To Pran?

1161
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:01,840
Yes, where could l have found the
huge amount he was asking me for?

1162
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:04,840
You mean, it was Pran who
gave that necklace to Roopa?

1163
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,400
l can't understand what
this is all about

1164
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,360
Why are you so scared of Pran?

1165
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:13,680
What secret does the diay hold
that you want to hide at any cost?

1166
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:17,680
My necklace goes from Pran to Roopa,
your diay goes from Pran to Beena

1167
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:20,560
What the hell is
all this about?

1168
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,880
Wow!

1169
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,720
lt was devastation let loose!

1170
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:47,680
l thought you were
a Goddess of Dance

1171
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,480
Now l realise, you are also
a Goddess of Music

1172
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:55,240
l swear it on your beauty,
l've heard a million songs...

1173
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:57,640
but this was a class apart

1174
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:02,560
While you sang, my heart
was being lit up

1175
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:05,240
You are embarrassing me

1176
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:09,400
l'm not such a good singer.
l only keep tying

1177
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:12,840
lf you call that tying,
what would genius be?

1178
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:18,280
l must say, l have never seen such
a combination of beauty and music

1179
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,720
God must've crafted you
with great care

1180
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:26,200
Hats off to you, Creator!
Hers is one face...

1181
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,200
and mine is another.
The ugliest of beasts

1182
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:36,800
Don't say that. A handsome,
outgoing and lively man like you...

1183
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:42,200
is found one in a million.
- Thanks for the lavish praise

1184
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:49,760
Whatever God has made, l wonder why
girls don't find my looks appealing

1185
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:56,240
How would a gem know what it's worth?
It takes a true jeweller to know one

1186
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:00,560
lf only someone asked my heart...
- What this feeling is all about

1187
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:04,840
lt's the desire that
stabs at my heart

1188
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:07,840
What happened?

1189
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:11,560
Not a cold, is it?

1190
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,920
What a terrible cough!

1191
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:21,760
Looks like my praise
went to your throat

1192
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:25,840
No, it's a punishment

1193
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,520
Water...
- At once

1194
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,160
A bit warm

1195
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:33,840
Sory for the bother

1196
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:19,400
Police Station. Hury up!

1197
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:27,200
Where's Beena?
Where?

1198
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,560
She's not in

1199
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:47,600
Now listen, Shambhu.
If you want this place to remain...

1200
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:50,400
and want to preserve my name...

1201
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:54,920
find Beena from wherever she is
and lay her at my feet

1202
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:57,040
Raian, Beena's life is in danger

1203
02:16:57,480 --> 02:17:01,240
Pran was here iust now.
He's gone to kill her with a pistol

1204
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:22,560
Pran, where's Beena?

1205
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:27,680
That's a question l must ask you.
And you're asking me?

1206
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,920
Skip the iokes. Tell me...
where have you hidden her?

1207
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:34,000
l've hidden her?
- Yes. Tell me where's Beena?

1208
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:37,240
Else, l'll kill you!
- You'll kill me...?

1209
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:59,360
l'm glad to see you that you're
not as weak as l expected

1210
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,840
The death of a brave man
is like mamrdom

1211
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:07,760
Be prepared to be mamred

1212
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:21,200
lnspector, l've been waiting for
you for a long time

1213
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:25,560
You're here at last.
- Yes, l've been waiting for you too

1214
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:27,200
Move it!

1215
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:29,200
Why don't you arrest him?

1216
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:33,560
He's a kid compared to you.
The student comes after the teacher

1217
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:40,200
So it was all his doing.
The rat

1218
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:49,880
Don't touch me

1219
02:19:50,280 --> 02:19:53,200
You think l need your sympathy
because l've been arrested?

1220
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:56,920
There isn't a woman who can
do a favour to Pran

1221
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:05,240
Beena, now l understand
where you were

1222
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:13,280
l am thanMul to you, l've been
arrested because of a beautiful girl

1223
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:22,560
Repeat after me: ''l have nothing
to do with the material world''

1224
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,840
''l have nothing to do
with the material world''

1225
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:32,200
''l hereby renounce this material
world

1226
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:37,840
and go unto the Lord's feet''
''l hereby renounce this material

1227
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:40,560
Sir, take me along!

1228
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:44,560
What will l do in this world
without you?

1229
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:49,240
The status of an ascetic
not evey living being can have

1230
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:51,920
May the Lord be praised forever

1231
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,560
Praise the Lord!

1232
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:56,880
Praise the Lord.
My fee?

1233
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:03,400
Where will l give you any fee from?
l have renounced the material world

1234
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,840
But my fee?
- l could have given you...

1235
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:10,720
before l renounced the world.
l now beg in God's name

1236
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:13,880
My lot is to take alms,
not give any

1237
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:17,880
Jwalaprasad, l inspired you to
renounce the world

1238
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:21,200
l agree.
- l'm a Brahmin, your Guru

1239
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:25,200
Unless you pay your Guru his fee,
you will never find redemption

1240
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:26,640
l don't agree

1241
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:30,280
Jwalaprasad, have you really
renounced the world?

1242
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:33,200
l started the moment
l received your letter

1243
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:34,880
Please sit down

1244
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:38,720
Why did you think of giving up
a settled life and doing this?

1245
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:41,200
l had no other way

1246
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:44,480
My son talks back to me...

1247
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:47,200
my daughter-in-law calls me
''Old man''...

1248
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:50,880
l thirst for a cup of tea
right till the afternoon...

1249
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,760
and my son plays bearer to his wife
and flits around her

1250
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,760
lsn't it better to leave the house
and turn an ascetic?

1251
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:59,400
Welcome, barrister

1252
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:03,240
Here are the documents, sir

1253
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:05,400
Greetings.
- Bless you

1254
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,840
Read the documents and
sign them, Mr Kedarnath

1255
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:13,920
This will has been prepared after
a great deal of thought, Mr Kedarnath

1256
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:16,760
Will....? Hold it

1257
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:18,040
You...?
- Beena!

1258
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,760
Come in

1259
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,160
Father

1260
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:26,160
l'm sory, but l have to ask you
something vey important

1261
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:28,160
Go ahead. What is it?

1262
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:31,160
Did you live in Rangoon earlier?
- Yes

1263
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:34,680
Did you move to Africa,
after your wife's death?

1264
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:37,200
Yes.
- Before leaving for Africa...

1265
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:39,800
did you leave your only son
with a close friend?

1266
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:41,800
Yes. But what is all this about?

1267
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:45,600
Because war had broken out, you
came directly to India from Africa

1268
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,840
lt's true.
- Where was your son then?

1269
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:49,880
ln Rangoon, with a friend

1270
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:52,880
After a year, l had my son
brought back to me

1271
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
And you thought
the child was your son?

1272
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:57,800
Nonsense! Won't the father
accept his own son?

1273
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:01,480
Calm down, Chand.
Go ahead, my dear

1274
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:04,560
You've been kept in the dark.
You have been betrayed

1275
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:07,600
Chand is not your son

1276
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:12,640
What do you mean?
Why're you jealous of us?

1277
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,200
Girl! Be patient

1278
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:19,800
Beena, how can you prove it
that Chand is not my son?

1279
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,200
ProoR

1280
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,200
This diay will bring
the facts to light

1281
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:40,920
Keep reading.
You will get to know the truth

1282
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:49,760
What is the proof that this is
indeed an authentic diay?

1283
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:51,880
The one who wrote it is missing.

1284
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:54,440
Jwalaprasad...
- Who is it?

1285
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:58,240
Who are you?
- An unfortunate man...

1286
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:02,240
you know vey well,
but someone you can't recognise

1287
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:07,240
My name is Naraindas

1288
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:09,800
Yes

1289
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:18,480
Naraindas! You are alive!

1290
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:24,680
What state are you in?
Beena, this is my friend from

1291
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:28,280
Rangoon!
Tell me the truth, Naraindas.

1292
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:32,320
Did you really write this diay?
Tell me...

1293
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:36,200
Yes, it's a diay
of my black deeds

1294
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:43,960
So isn't Chand my son?
Why did you betray me? Why?

1295
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:49,360
l'll explain it to you, my friend.
When you went to Africa from

1296
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:54,680
Rangoon...
war broke out in your absence.

1297
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:59,800
Panic had gripped the whole city
People started running helter skelter

1298
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:07,480
to save their lives
l took your son and my children

1299
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:13,600
to leave Rangoon empty-handed
In the ensuing confusion, your son

1300
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,560
was separated from me
My wife died in the bombardment

1301
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:23,400
For _o years, l suffered.
l had neither food nor shelter

1302
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:28,240
When peace returned to the city,
l went back to Rangoon

1303
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:33,240
Someone from India had come
to take your son back to you

1304
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:41,760
l thought, that if l told you
l had lost your only son...

1305
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:44,400
you would go through hell

1306
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:50,560
l saw off my own son, who was of
the same age, with that man

1307
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:53,680
Chand is not your son.
He's my son!

1308
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:59,280
l know what you're going through

1309
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:05,840
But l was only being a good friend.
By giving my son away...

1310
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:08,800
l wanted to save you
from a rude shock

1311
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:12,280
But destiny willed otherwise

1312
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:19,600
l raised the money to come to India
and boarded a ship

1313
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:22,800
On board were a lot of
orphaned children...

1314
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:28,200
Whose parents were dead in the war.
On the ship, l found your son again

1315
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:32,560
Found my son...? So why didn't
you send him to me?

1316
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:36,240
Answer me, Narain!
- l brought him to your doorstep

1317
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:39,640
l thought l'd seek your forgiveness
for lying earlier...

1318
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:44,240
and return your real son to you.
However...

1319
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:47,240
the moment l reached your gates...

1320
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:52,240
lt's my son's birthday.
Keep it here

1321
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:57,600
Here you are, son. A motor car

1322
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,640
l'm so happy to have
found my son again

1323
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:06,240
lt's all thanks to the kindness
of my friend Naraindas

1324
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:12,600
Forgive me, Jwalaprasad.
l have changed my mind

1325
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:17,840
l'm taking your son away with me

1326
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:20,640
lt was a moment of weakness

1327
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:24,240
l thought my son would be
vey comfortable with you

1328
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,720
l was human, l made a mistake.

1329
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:32,840
For my son's bright future, l took
your son back with me

1330
02:27:33,480 --> 02:27:36,240
And God punished me severely
for my sin

1331
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:39,880
l suffered greatly to provide
for the children

1332
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:43,240
l was deeply in debt

1333
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:48,240
The children had grown up.
And one night...

1334
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:51,480
l left them in God's care,
and went away

1335
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:57,600
This state you see me in
is because of my evil deeds!

1336
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:01,880
Naraindas, this is the last thing
l expected you to do

1337
02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:07,280
Tell me, where is my son?
How is he?

1338
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:09,920
Take me to my son.
- Have patience

1339
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:13,840
Your son is right here.
Rajan...

1340
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:18,280
Come in

1341
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:32,200
My daughter!
- Father!

1342
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:36,720
Father! In this state...?
Where had you gone away?

1343
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:40,760
Raian, don't call this sinner
your father

1344
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:44,760
l'm not your father.
Your father is Jwalaprasad

1345
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:46,760
My daughter!

1346
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:56,840
l've seen many clever men
going astray...

1347
02:28:57,240 --> 02:28:59,920
but the secrets of God,
only He knows

1348
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:09,240
Wait!

1349
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,920
Where are you going?
- To hell

1350
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,600
What have you to do with us?
- Really?

1351
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,880
You've been harassing me
for 25 years

1352
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,000
l spent my younger days
worying about you

1353
02:29:21,480 --> 02:29:25,200
ln this old age, l had my whiskers
shaved to renounce the world

1354
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:27,560
My lovely whiskers!

1355
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:31,200
And you want to go away...?
Set the luggage down!

1356
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:38,560
And don't you ever tell anyone
that l'm not your father. Get that?

1357
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:43,600
A friend's son is
like one's own son

1358
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:46,560
Forgive me.
- Forgiven

1359
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,800
Brother Raian... forgive me

1360
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:53,200
Me too.
- You too?

1361
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:57,240
Wonderful! The cat expresses regret!

1362
02:29:57,640 --> 02:30:01,240
You are forgiven too.
But remember...

1363
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:04,240
you will give up
your western ways

1364
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:09,840
You will be the true Indian woman.
Like Beena

1365
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:12,600
Bless you

1366
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:15,920
Mr Kedarnath, it's time to fulfill
the promise l made to you

1367
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:20,400
Do you agree?
- How can l disagree?

1368
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:29,520
Don't get a vagabond like me
married to Beena

1369
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:33,200
l'm not worthy of her.
- Vey rightly said

1370
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,880
Evey decent man's son considers
himself inferior to others

1371
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,840
But my son, Beena can't find
a better husband than you

1372
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:44,840
And you will not find
a better wife than Beena

1373
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:50,240
l'm so happy today! l feel as if
my young days have returned to me!

1374
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:53,480
Who could be luckier than me?

1375
02:30:53,960 --> 02:30:56,480
Two sons.
Two daughters-in-law

1376
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:00,560
Two friends.
And a goddess-like daughter

1377
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,880
Vey soon, l will be
a grandfather too!

1378
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:09,560
Sir, my fee... ?
- Fee?

1379
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:13,240
What fee?
- l've made you renounce the world

1380
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:15,880
Hey Makardhwai!

1381
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:22,560
There you are. l renounce hermitage
and return to the material world

1382
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:26,520
Only the hair and whiskers are
missing. What say, Makardhwaj?

1383
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,720
Absolutely!
