1
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,707
With the announcement
of polls to parliament,

2
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,851
parties in the state are busy
with seat allocations.

3
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:15,852
Ruling Swayamshakthi party has
been winning few seats regularly,

4
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,614
Chittoor constituency is one of them,

5
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,622
with sitting MP Mahendra Naidu,

6
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:23,627
former MP Seshadri Naidu
claiming for the seat,

7
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:25,856
political weather has
turned hot here,

8
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:29,001
enmity between the two families
is going on for few decades,

9
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:33,033
this enmity has resulted in many
conflicts and bloody clashes,

10
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,308
but for sometime now, with active
brokering by the party bigwigs,

11
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:38,842
with ticket given to each family
on rotation basis,

12
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,480
peace has been restored
in the region,

13
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:45,651
breaking this peace
accord of rotation,

14
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:49,380
Mahendra Naidu who won the
last elections with bumper majority,

15
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:52,787
with rumours that ruling party
wants him to contest again,

16
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,722
the tension has reached the peak,

17
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:58,320
we have to wait and see
it's consequences.

18
00:01:58,498 --> 00:01:59,988
Swayamshakthi Party Office, Chittoor.

19
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:04,895
l was an MP of this constituency
for 30 years,

20
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,840
now l've retired from
active politics,

21
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,741
l'm a well wisher of you both,

22
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,640
who so ever may get the seat,

23
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:15,748
l'll ensure that the
other man gets justice.

24
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:16,905
Tell then Minister.

25
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,916
High command respects you both,

26
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,453
last four elections we've won
with vast majority here,

27
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,647
you both are responsible for it.

28
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:26,383
No need of prologue, Minister.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,822
Tell us, who is going to contest here?

30
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:30,690
Priest! Why are you interested
in politics?

31
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:36,029
Why not? Remember that former
PM Narasimha Rao was also a Brahmin.

32
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:36,858
Tell us.

33
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:41,030
High command has decided
to nominate MP Mahendra again.

34
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:43,531
Bloody!

35
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,576
Seshadri Naidu must get the seat
according to the rotation policy.

36
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:50,716
CM's survey results say
people are not with him.

37
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,112
That's why we had to
take this decision.

38
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:54,647
Elder one and middle one, get up.

39
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:58,452
You didn't give me the ticket
saying people are not with me,

40
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,560
l'll prove that they are with me.

41
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:07,763
Our constituency is peaceful
for the past 25 years,

42
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:11,392
let it remain peaceful,
it's good for everyone.

43
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:12,833
Shake your hands.

44
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,776
l'm getting late for my prayers,
l'll take leave now.

45
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:18,911
Okay.
- Okay Guru.

46
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:27,680
We'll not accept party decision.

47
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:32,416
How dare you!

48
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,434
He'll become MP only if he
goes out from here, father.

49
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,201
Who was that?

50
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,876
Am l a eunuch?

51
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:59,815
Come...come...
l'll take you to task...

52
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:01,249
Come l say!

53
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:05,786
Brother-in-law! l've been kidnapped.

54
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:12,629
We'll come wearing slippers
while entering thorny area.

55
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:36,920
Leave him.
- Untie him.

56
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:44,620
How dare you kidnap me.
Do you know me?

57
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:48,791
l'll hack you!
l'll hack you all!

58
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:52,996
Who will untie my hands, your fathers?
- Come on boys!

59
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:57,234
l remember your dirty faces.
l'll not spare anyone of you.

60
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,545
First l'll kill your children,

61
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:03,171
then l'll molest your wives
as you watch,

62
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,508
and then kill you all,
bloody bastards.

63
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:10,122
May be you were all born
to me only.

64
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:24,903
Have you left me, my husband?

65
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:30,336
You came here as live-in
son-in-law with love on me.

66
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:36,071
How am l to live here without you?

67
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:38,046
Calm down...

68
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,576
l didn't kill him wantonly, sir.

69
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,745
He was abusing us wildly,
we beat him.

70
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:44,116
We didn't expect he'll die.

71
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,919
Let him die, Seshadri can
only raise dust nothing else.

72
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:50,927
By the time we complete
his obsequies,

73
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,031
they must mourn a death
in their home,

74
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,226
before we change these clothes,
we must finish them.

75
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,269
l'll not remove my vermilion dot
until someone is killed in their home,

76
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:07,046
promise me, only then
l'll let you cremate his body.

77
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,340
lf you say you can't,

78
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:16,054
then l'll burn alive in
my husband's pyre.

79
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:20,249
Lost MP seat, lost 100s of crores
worth mining contracts,

80
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:24,791
now lost brother-in-law too,
l'm sure he'll be furious on us.

81
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:31,836
Mahendra and his brother killed my
brother-in-law unable to harm me or my sons,

82
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:36,874
they started it after 25 years,
l'll put an end to it.

83
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,305
l'll see their end.

84
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,203
He can't do anything, uncle.

85
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,215
He may not harm us, what if they
attack our people living outside.

86
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:47,277
Uncle is right.

87
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:52,788
25 years ago to take vengeance on us
killed our relative living in Madras.

88
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,153
We must take necessary precautions.

89
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:57,387
What should we do now?
- Get all our near relatives here.

90
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,130
By tomorrow morning
everyone should be here.

91
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,426
Get going.
- Yes boss.

92
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:07,362
Shall we bring Ajay also?
- No need.

93
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:09,334
He's in no way connected
to this house.

94
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:13,009
Just because you don't accept,
the relationship won't break.

95
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,180
Whether you accept or not,
Ajay is your brother's son.

96
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,340
l didn't accept him
when my brother was alive,

97
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,084
now that he's dead,
l don't care about him.

98
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:23,450
lf anything happens to Ajay,
you mustn't be responsible for it.

99
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,155
Think about it.

100
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:30,088
She's right,
if anything happens to Ajay,

101
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:33,994
not only we'll be responsible,
we'll lose our face too.

102
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,965
Okay, get Ajay also.

103
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:40,467
Ajay is coming!

104
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,517
He's coming! Run boys!

105
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,257
Close the gate!

106
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:23,200
You're finished today.
- Why are you running away?

107
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:26,478
Stop.

108
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:27,802
Ajay is beating us.

109
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,779
How dare you tease girls
using your MLA's father's name?

110
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,939
Bloody idiot!

111
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,916
Why are you getting angry?
Village farmer!

112
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,020
Don't abuse him!

113
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:40,853
He ploughs, sows, raises crops,
harvests it, cooks it,

114
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:44,224
you're a dog who eats
when it reaches your plate.

115
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,304
Come...come...

116
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,309
What's this fight? Move!

117
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,081
Who is it?

118
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,581
Sir, he's teasing girls.

119
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:10,621
Stop the fight.

120
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,284
Stop it l say.

121
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,321
Question papers.

122
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:16,626
Fast.

123
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:23,366
Get out fast.

124
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:26,232
Am l not tell\ling you?
Stop it l say.

125
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:29,571
lf you continue fighting,
l'll resign as principal.

126
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,377
l'm leaving you since Principal
has threatened to resign.

127
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,012
lf not l'll...

128
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:37,177
Boss, l'm helping you, give me a party.
- Okay done.

129
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,646
You mustn't go sir, without you this
college will lose it's sheen.

130
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,113
You mustn't go sir.

131
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,350
All of you go and study.

132
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,359
Learn from Ajay.
- Yes sir!

133
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,320
Who banged on my door
when l was meditating deeply?

134
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,685
Your elder paternal uncle wants
you at home immediately.

135
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,221
l'll not come.

136
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:23,657
Why should l come?

137
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:27,364
Did you ever respect me as
Mahendra Naidu's nephew?

138
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:33,438
No, atleast showed any pity
as an orphan without parents,

139
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:34,334
not even that,

140
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,498
why should l come then?
l'll not come.

141
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:40,709
They will invite me for festivals only,

142
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:42,912
did they ever think of me
on other days?

143
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,710
Not even that. Why should l come?
l'll not come.

144
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:48,652
He's not inviting you for festival.

145
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:51,954
They'll kill you, your wish now.

146
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,717
But still l'll not come.

147
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:55,409
What to do?

148
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:58,479
Shall we go brothers?

149
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:23,369
There's no boundary
to birds in the sky...

150
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:25,640
There's no route
for fishes in the sea...

151
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:27,750
There's no place
where wind not reaches...

152
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,443
Why should only we have the rules?

153
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,349
Why should we fear anyone?

154
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:34,581
We are king to ourselves...

155
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,953
y ou live only once...

156
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:39,387
Do whatever you want to do...

157
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:41,463
Experiencing it is the only passion...

158
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,758
Devil-may-care...

159
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,994
Nobody teaches wind...

160
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:51,868
Don't live a life of burden...

161
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:56,879
It's a ocean filled with
billions of dreams...

162
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,926
Who so ever may earn
any big money...

163
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,329
Who so ever may rule the roost...

164
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:23,837
Who so ever may develop body...

165
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,908
It's all ours...buddy...

166
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:29,235
Don't care about anyone...

167
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:31,573
Never bow before anyone...

168
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:33,010
Never beg with anyone...

169
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,580
Our self esteem is our power...

170
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:40,348
I'm a wastrel of wastrels...

171
00:13:40,524 --> 00:13:44,620
Mix water with my drink...

172
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:49,755
Come, let's wipe out
the narrow boundaries...

173
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:47,690
If a girl looks at you...

174
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:49,985
If she smile at you...

175
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:51,521
If she makes a mischief gesture...

176
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:54,664
y ou take it lightly, brother...

177
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,992
If your love ditches you...

178
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,325
If people you trust betray...

179
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:00,662
Even if they take away everything...

180
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:03,067
Nothing will happen to you, brother...

181
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:07,900
Happiness is between
past and future...

182
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,344
Who knows what's in store
for the future...

183
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:17,509
Live with a smile...
only your shadow is your companion...

184
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,448
How many times do l've
to tell you l don't want food?

185
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:42,882
lt's two days since
my husband is dead.

186
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:45,319
Not a dead body in
the opposite camp.

187
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:49,396
There's no value for me here,
no use of me living anymore.

188
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:55,433
Aunt....aunt...
- Leave me.

189
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:58,802
Killing relatives of him
is easy task to me,

190
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,473
will it satiate our fury of revenge?

191
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:05,808
lt will calm only on killing
Mahendra and his brother.

192
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,810
That's why l kept quiet.
- But they weren't quiet, right?

193
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,312
lf they were angry on us,
why did they kill our uncle?

194
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:15,150
Yes father, let's not show
any mercy on them.

195
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:23,390
Then, go to their place and
kill anyone you lay hands on.

196
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,363
There's no one in
the village to kill.

197
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,331
They'd waken up long before you.

198
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,471
All have reached Mangapuram safely.

199
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,369
What if they are in Mangapuram?
ls it any impregnable Golconda fort?

200
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,170
More than it,
soldiers saved using spears,

201
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,540
but here people stand as
human shields to protect Mangapuram.

202
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,614
ls it so strong? Let me test it.

203
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:44,685
l'll come back home only after
killing atleast one person there.

204
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:47,246
Stop...

205
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,358
Stop!
- Stop son!

206
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:55,857
When you fight equals you need to
use brain more than physical power.

207
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:57,529
Get inside.

208
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,259
Are you also afraid of that place?

209
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:08,536
Priest! Tiger takes 2 steps back
to lunge forward 3 steps.

210
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:12,371
At opportune moment,
l'll pounce on them.

211
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,210
l swear on Lord Venkateshwara.

212
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:17,885
Have all our people reached here?

213
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,017
Are you asking me or the Lord?

214
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:23,552
Look, sisters and sons-in-law
are coming.

215
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,819
Sisters and useless sons-in-law.
Welcome.

216
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:30,261
Why did you bring us here urgently?
What's the matter?

217
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,593
Festival is still far away.

218
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,736
Doesn't look like invitation for festival,
but brought to police station,

219
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,394
didn't even allow to wear
pant properly.

220
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:37,537
Dividing property?

221
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:39,971
l'll tell you later,
have children come with you?

222
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,300
All have come?
- Has Ajay come?

223
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,968
lf Ajay comes, l'll not stay here.
Come.

224
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,781
l'll not agree to let him stay here.
- l'm going away right now.

225
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,439
Check if food is ready.

226
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,414
Why is everyone so angry on Ajay?

227
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,053
Not anger, furious.

228
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,753
His father brought dishonour
to the family,

229
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,687
he ruined it completely.

230
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,555
We know how much he
had troubled elder brother.

231
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:02,027
Sisters are sharing
Mahendra's sorrows.

232
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:05,357
Fearing they may to get share
in property if they don't it now.

233
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:06,796
What the hell are you blabbering?

234
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:08,596
Look, Ajay is coming!

235
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:22,614
Grandpa! Aunts! Uncles!

236
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:23,717
Are you all doing well?

237
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:24,818
Who is your uncle?

238
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:26,386
l'll not agree if you call me uncle.

239
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,022
l'll kill you.

240
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,956
Hubby! Brother is coming.

241
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:33,962
Elder uncle and junior uncle,
are you fine?

242
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,959
We haven't called you here for
any festival or celebration.

243
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,825
tensions are running high here,

244
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:43,403
fearing someone may
harm you instead of me.

245
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:44,971
lf tensions are high here,
why did you bring us here?

246
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,605
lt's difficult to give security
to each one of you.

247
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,404
lf it's our village,
outsiders will not enter.

248
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:50,306
That's why brought you all here.

249
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,413
How long should we stay here?
- As long as we ask you.

250
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:53,809
Any problem?

251
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:59,377
You needn't worry,
take it as 10 day holiday,

252
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,815
no need to tell the kids about this,

253
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,652
one more thing,

254
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:06,995
nobody must go out of the
village without my permission.

255
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:08,755
Understood?

256
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,490
Go and have food.

257
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,497
He gave bad news and
wants to have food.

258
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:13,828
We face this trouble
because of his doings.

259
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,334
l too have the same feelings.

260
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,768
Uncle, let's go around the village.

261
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,843
Hey brainless elder uncle!

262
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,922
Will you say who is uncle to me?

263
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,387
Keep away from me.

264
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,858
l don't know myself how crook l'm.
- But l know it, uncle.

265
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:43,829
lt seems you own two hotels
in Guntur, what's the matter?

266
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,160
ls it true?
- Shut up.

267
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:50,700
lt seems you lent money to someone
without uncle's knowledge on high interest,

268
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:54,134
it seems you kept quiet
when he cheated you.

269
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:55,409
ls it true?

270
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,102
First you tell me,
what he said is true?

271
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,142
No, you tell me if he's true.
- l'm asking you to tell me first.

272
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,041
He said about Guntur matter,
is it true?

273
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:04,147
l don't have patience,
l'm dying with you only.

274
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,045
tell me how much you lost?
- My wish, my money...

275
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,151
Hello senseless middle uncle.

276
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:09,753
Won't you keep quiet
if l call you uncle?

277
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,392
You don't know about me.

278
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,959
lf l remove the glasses,
l'm not a human at all.

279
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,390
Even if you don't,
you're not a human, uncle.

280
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,087
Tell him to go away.

281
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:17,865
You too have a mouth,
why can't you tell him?

282
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,558
You've a big mouth!
- Do l've a big mouth?

283
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:21,794
lf it's not big,
you think it's small...

284
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,836
May your mouth get paralysed.
- Why are you cursing me?

285
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,667
Are you talking too much
because l'm in your home?

286
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,570
l'm stopping with speech
because it's my home.

287
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,472
Hello, shameless younger uncle!

288
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:30,905
Will you kill me if l call you uncle?

289
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,913
l don't talk to idiots.
- But l do.

290
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:36,778
lt seems you were troubling
people as MP's brother-in-law,

291
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,510
and they beat you
covering up in darkness.

292
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,951
Who told you that?
- Who else? Your wife!

293
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:43,091
ls it true?
- Don't l've any other work?

294
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,756
You're diverting the issue.
- You're diverting it.

295
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,791
How would he know
if you don't tell him?

296
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,690
Will you believe whatever he says?

297
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:50,161
Uncle! Where is Girija?

298
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,765
lf you utter my daughter's name,
l'll kill you.

299
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,767
Hey girls!
- Get lost idiot!

300
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,601
l'm coming!

301
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,142
Hey Gita! Where is your husband?
Already divorced?

302
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,919
He has gone to US, you buffalo.
- On job or escaped?

303
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,178
lf you open the mouth...

304
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:16,047
That's okay, do you remember about
things we had before marriage?

305
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:22,528
l too have a similar dress.
l bought it in Kalamandir.

306
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,731
Who called me an idiot?
Of course l may be an idiot!

307
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,929
But if you call an idiot as idiot,
no idiot will take it easy.

308
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,700
lf he's quiet, he'll be a foolish idiot.
Come on tell me.

309
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,776
lt's me, what will you do?
- What will l do?

310
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:38,038
Whatever has to be done,
God has already done with your face.

311
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,942
Talking to you is like talking to bull.

312
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:42,049
Poor girl! Do you talk to only bulls?

313
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,650
Are you a buffalo?
And you...?

314
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:45,150
lf you trouble me,
you'll regret for it.

315
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,149
l'm already regretting
to see you so closely.

316
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:55,219
Don't trouble me, if you do,
you'll lose honour, you'll regret for it.

317
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,997
Anyway...where is Girija?

318
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,994
You need someone else.
- Who?

319
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:29,262
How dare!

320
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,194
Teasing girls!

321
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,024
They are not girls, very hard nuts.
Look again.

322
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:36,694
l'll see your end.

323
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,704
You can't even see anything
beneath your stomach,

324
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,536
how can you see my end?

325
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:47,805
Go!
- You go!

326
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:51,877
Where is Girija?

327
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:58,226
Sister Girija!

328
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:08,896
Take offering, father.

329
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:13,105
She's not my daughter, my parenting.

330
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:15,300
She's first in beauty and humbleness.

331
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,306
l'll marry her to an NRl,
watch out, she'll go long way.

332
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,274
Where will she go
if you marry her to NRl?

333
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,583
ln two years, she'll get pregnant.

334
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,614
ln three years she'll grow fat.

335
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:24,309
You both are not co-brothers,
but jackals.

336
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,143
Sister, come here.

337
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,152
We must send back Ajay
to Vijayawada.

338
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,019
l want your support.
Come fast, sister.

339
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:35,027
lt's better to have water standing
than having Pepsi while running.

340
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:36,755
Will you stop your remix proverbs?

341
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:40,595
Today he's finished, swept off.

342
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:51,771
What's your problem?
- What a great act sister!

343
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:53,881
Docile at home and
tomboyish outside.

344
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,985
lf you want to go to pubs,
if you want money,

345
00:23:58,153 --> 00:23:59,882
you need to act docile at home.

346
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:02,819
You've great talent, my goddess!

00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:03,855
You'll come good in life.

348
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,288
What's this Ajay problem?

349
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:11,793
Do you remember the dose you
gave to Ajay during last festival?

350
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:27,612
Top and bottom would've got burned!

351
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:28,681
Wound wouldn't have dried yet.

352
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:34,221
Hey Girija! Will you put thorns
under my butt and wound it?

353
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,721
l'll not leave you Girija!

354
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,156
You can't harm me!

355
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:40,920
Aunt!

356
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,453
Come dear.

357
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,731
l'll come if you promise not to cry.

358
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,993
lt'll not stop even
if you say no, come.

359
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:50,302
Are you fine sister Gayathri?

360
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:51,871
Mother, look at him!

361
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,736
Won't you ever change?
Always like this.

362
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:58,472
What's this son? You've grown so thin.
- Wait...wait...

363
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,742
Speak now!

364
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:05,914
Are you eating well in hostel?

365
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,784
l don't feel shy,
l'm having a go at food.

366
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:14,293
You visit for some festival
and go away

367
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,428
Don't know how you're living there?

368
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,130
l'm happy-go-lucky guy!
Please don't cry!

369
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,726
Looks like you're teasing
all the guests.

370
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:23,769
There's no other way to talk to them.

371
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,873
Either l must tease them
or they must scold me.

372
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,770
Tease them to hell.

373
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,870
But don't trouble Muddukrishna.

374
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:39,051
Your uncles dote on him.
Be good with him.

375
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,384
Okay, l'll try.

376
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,488
Meowing cat...
cat without moustache...

377
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:44,682
Greetings sir.

378
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:45,820
Sir!

379
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:50,291
She warned to stay away
from Muddukrishna.

380
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,830
That's why l'm thinking of
shaking hands with him,

381
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,600
what's your idea?
- Good idea sir.

382
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:56,862
lf l shake hands with him
and he doesn't respond to it.

383
00:25:57,205 --> 00:26:01,767
lf give my hands to him and
if doesn't return my hands...?

384
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,135
l'll be sad, right?
- lndeed sir.

385
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:09,614
Won't l get angry if he doesn't respond
properly for my shake hands?

386
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:16,853
How dare he insults me without
responding to my hand shake?

387
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:21,285
You fool!
Won't you shake hands if l offer?

388
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:28,791
You're dead meat today!
l'll see your end today.

389
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,627
You silly fellow!

390
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,206
No monkey tricks with
monkey God Hanuman!

391
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:38,471
l can't jump because l've eaten full.

392
00:26:38,746 --> 00:26:40,805
These stunts are performed
by experts.

393
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:43,510
Your jumps and my walk is same.

394
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,677
You've been beating me since
childhood, this settles all that.

395
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:47,718
My towel!

396
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:49,516
l must only beat you.
- You mustn't beat me.

397
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,715
What's this rule?
You crazy boy!

398
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:52,723
You're eating like a gargantuan.

399
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:55,226
What will you do man?

400
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:58,490
Will you beat me with volley ball?
- Yes, you fool.

401
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,541
Two things l hate in this world!

402
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:14,512
One is you, two is English films
with censor cuts.

403
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,647
l'll take you to task later.

404
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:20,914
Where will you go escaping from me?
No way from there.

405
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,516
Where are you getting up?

406
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:26,990
lf you're a monkey, l'm a simian.
No please...

407
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:31,689
Leave my hand...leave my hand...
Leave...

408
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,859
What's this?

409
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,260
lf you hold me,
it means you're saving me,

410
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,904
1 if l hold you,
it means l'm saving myself.

411
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,831
You bloody...

412
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,936
One rupee coin!
- That's mine!

413
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,980
My name is not B. Saroja, but Girija!

414
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:57,018
Don't hit me, l can't rub also.

415
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:06,231
Did you see what Ajay did?

416
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,569
Look uncle!
Ajay is teasing me.

417
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,399
Ajay, come here.

418
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:26,046
Do you know what my father said
on his death bed, uncle?

419
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,416
Didn't say anything!

420
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:39,527
Bharath, Ajay is doing too much.

421
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:42,036
l've given him long rope
of hundred mistakes,

422
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,065
99 are over,

423
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,606
after that he's finished.

424
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,941
Did you hear this ring tone?
Child's cry.

425
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,774
Let me hear.
- Play it.

426
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,102
True, he came with a sword, sister.

427
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:25,804
Where is he?
- Come.

428
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,312
You disturbed me.
- He was here only.

429
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,810
Thank God!

430
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:33,476
No dear.

431
00:29:33,654 --> 00:29:35,986
lf they know l'm your friend,
they'll tonsure my head,

432
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:37,689
and stop serving me food,

433
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:43,320
that's why l'm scolding and
living a hell as if l'm enjoying it.

434
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:44,487
Please don't feel sad,
my little brother-in-law.

435
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:49,529
l'm getting angry
when others scold you.

436
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,605
Leave the elders,
but that Muddukrishna,

437
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,675
he looks down upon us like
Australians treating lndians there.

438
00:29:55,843 --> 00:30:00,109
We must teach him
what is social justice.

439
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,077
l've another scheme for it.
- Cash exchange scheme?

440
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,852
lt didn't work out.

441
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,682
l'll design a Rajeev T-shirt scheme.

442
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:17,357
Brother-in-law!
Look, what l've got for you.

443
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:20,399
What is it?
Looks very cheap.

444
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,695
Why are you saying like that?
Do you know what's in it?

445
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,030
What's in it?

446
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:28,870
Moddukrishna!(dullard Krishna)

447
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:30,169
Nice!

448
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,145
Thanks big boy!
- Please wear it.

449
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:36,541
Why are you so affectionate on me?

450
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,115
Perfect fit.

451
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:43,856
ls it good?
- How nasty it is?

452
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,583
How nice it is!

453
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,728
One more present for you.

454
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,393
What?
- Do you know for whom this is?

455
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,556
Ajay!
- Ajay?

456
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,927
Look, what's written on it.

457
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:56,569
Big fool!

458
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:58,967
Ajay will wear this and
become a big fool.

459
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,402
How is it?

460
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,206
Ajay, come here.

461
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,582
This T-shirt is for you, have a blast!

462
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,949
Wear it now.
- Here?

463
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:17,685
l'm little shy with boys,
l'll change in room.

464
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:25,587
All of you look here!
He's a big fool!

465
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:34,472
What's on your T-shirt?
- Muddukrishna.

466
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,234
On my T-shirt?
- Big fool!

467
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:37,908
What's on your T-shirt?
- Muddukrishna.

468
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,103
On my T-shirt?
- Big fool!

469
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:40,175
Muddukrishna...Big fool!

470
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:47,444
Muddukrishna....big fool!

471
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:58,457
What's this, he's calling
himself a fool?

472
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:01,067
We are not aware if him as much
as he knows himself, right?

473
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:02,725
l'll beat you.

474
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:07,464
Muddukrishna....big fool!

475
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,940
l'll ask you two questions, uncle.

476
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:17,482
First one, you know it.

477
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:18,880
Second is...

478
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,989
lt's not that important.

479
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:31,830
Greetings sir.

480
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,593
Mahendra and his brother are
coming to quarry tomorrow,

481
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,930
you asked information, l gave it.

482
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:39,004
Don't add this sin to my account.

483
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,133
Sir!

484
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,336
Kill him!

485
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:18,543
Don't leave them.

486
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:31,558
Brother-in-law, inform doctor,
we are coming there.

487
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,216
People at home mustn't know this.

488
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,697
This time, we must attack his home.

489
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:45,737
But we mustn't go, l'll send a rat.

490
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,735
Because rat can enter places
where an elephant can't.

491
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,743
Sir, junior boss is going out.

492
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,913
Sir!
- Go with him.

493
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:06,355
lf anything happens to him,
take it as you all are dead. Go!

494
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,594
Go...go...be with him.

495
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:13,200
Elder son, middle son...
Go meet Yogi. - Yes father. Come.

496
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,685
Don't you've manners not to enter
room while changing clothes?

497
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,659
l saw everything from the keyhole
and then entered.

498
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,423
Tell me why you are here?

499
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,294
Aunt called you in the cattle shed.

500
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,867
Okay, you go.

501
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,403
l like green very much.

502
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,442
Your long skirt is also green.

503
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,637
You!

504
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,313
Why did you enter my daughter's room?

505
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,218
Leave about it, uncle.

506
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,689
She removed her half sari
on seeing me.

507
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,328
Find out why from her.
- True?

508
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,367
Did you remove your
half sari on seeing Ajay here?

509
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,832
Not that father...
- Did you remove it or not?

510
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,330
l removed it but...
- Removed it?

511
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,665
lt's all your parenting.

512
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,708
Yes, l taught her to remove sari
if any man comes into the room.

513
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,368
Hey you go out.
- l lost a chance to scold him.

514
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,740
Why are you scolding me for her deed?

515
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,644
Green is good,
if you give it, l'll go.

516
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,284
...you'll know it.
- l know, that's why l'm asking you.

517
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,476
For everything you accuse me.

518
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,644
lf l get angry l'll beat you.
- Beat me, l'll take you to task.

519
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:25,846
Will you beat me?

520
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,181
What's this?

521
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,348
He's irritating me, father.

522
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,619
Will you give him your half sari
if he irritates you?

523
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,955
lt's all your parenting.

524
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,197
Yes, l taught her to remove sari
and give if any man irritates her.

525
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,458
Mother!

526
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,527
You go!

527
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,572
Come to the cattle shed.
- You go, l'll come.

528
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,936
Cattle shed?

529
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,212
He's calling to cattle shed,
you say you'll come, l'm...

530
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,007
Got a tight slap!

531
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,652
Bull!- lt's not a bull, it's a cow.
- You stop it.

532
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,982
l'll kill him in a day or two.

533
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,223
lf you kill him for this,

534
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,623
what would you do for his
prank in Gita's marriage?

535
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,323
What did he do?

536
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,988
Shut up! Why rake up past?

537
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,732
You keep quiet first.

538
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,564
Tell me what did he do?

539
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,803
Gita's marriage was
going on one side...

540
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,535
He took her to the room and
asked her to elope with him.

541
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,576
ls it true, Gita?

542
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,741
Please, let's elope, listen to me.

543
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,044
lt's true, forget it.

544
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,024
Come here.

545
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,324
What brother?
- You know this?

546
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,261
l don't know.

547
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,593
Sit here, l'll tell you.

548
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,603
You fell down, that's the matter.

549
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,071
What a good prank!

550
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,469
l'll put a simple riddle,
will you answer it?

551
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,045
Come on ask me.

552
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,309
What is it that comes closer
when called up on,

553
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:03,443
with hand on cheek,
shout loudly, what is it, brother?

554
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,019
What is it that comes closer
when called up on,

555
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,291
with hand on cheek,
shouts loudly?

556
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,986
l don't know, you answer it.

557
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,922
Sure? - Sure.
- Come closer.

558
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,561
lt's you, brother.

559
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,962
You're dead today.

560
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,964
You'll die today in my hands.
- Oh ghost!

561
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,737
Do you've sense?
- What happened?

562
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:27,708
How dare you ask Gita to elope
with you while she's marrying?

563
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,106
What's your problem?
For not asking you?

564
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,973
Who will dare to scratch you?
No man with sense dare touch you.

565
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,978
Except some fool!

566
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,982
Stop, l can imagine
what had happened,

567
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:42,884
Ajay would've teased you and
you're rushing to beat him,

568
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,721
am l right?
- Right.

569
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,420
Why?

570
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,330
You're seeing Girija with love,
but she's looking at you like dog,

571
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,663
am l right?
- Right.

572
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,366
Do you know what you should do to
make her look at you with love?

573
00:37:58,543 --> 00:37:59,669
What should l do?

574
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,344
Give this rose to Ajay.
- To Ajay? What's this twist?

575
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:07,075
This is Gandhigiri.
There's a twist in the story here.

576
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,852
lf you give this rose to Ajay
while Girija is watching,

577
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,683
Girija will see a Munna Bhai in you,

578
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:13,881
after that love,

579
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,047
then marriage,

580
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,692
after that a child with your features...

581
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,426
Whatever you say?
No man will ever love you.

582
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,696
There are many to love me.

583
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,136
Even my physics teacher ogles at me.
- Oh god!

584
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,442
A boy gives me flower everyday.

585
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,645
Look, a boy is giving me flower
as you watch.

586
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,379
What's this 'friendship' brother?
- Shut up!

587
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,052
What happened?

588
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:54,895
Ajay is teasing Girija.
- Yes uncle.

589
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,728
Tell him to come down.

590
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,160
You'll get a stick now.

591
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:07,207
Will you lie that l teased you?
Now l'll really tease you.

592
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:18,914
Coming.

593
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,467
Oh God!

594
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:37,904
So she's K.Vishwanath film at home
and K.Raghavendra Rao film outside.

595
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,600
l'll show her Ajay film!

596
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,449
Yuck! Off late heroines have
become like club dancers.

597
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,020
Won't their dads see these pictures?

598
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,056
Uncle, look at my bum!

599
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,122
Looks like our Girija!
- Not like Girija, but wearing a shorts.

600
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,955
Oh God! Look she's holding
a glass in hand.

601
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,625
Glass is filled with drink....look...

602
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:13,136
Cries of enemy is
sweet music to ears!

603
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,806
Where is he?
- Upstairs. Bash him up!

604
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,475
l'll kill you today and
call a press meet.

605
00:40:56,771 --> 00:41:02,403
O my dear, my two plaited beauty...

606
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:03,908
I'm worse than you...

607
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:05,371
Don't cross my path...

608
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,640
Don't spoil a good boy...

609
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,613
Come to me...
Naughty...

610
00:41:11,786 --> 00:41:14,619
Come to romance...Hot...

Cat walking beauty...

612
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:20,957
Don't rock my life...

613
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,410
If you don't want to talk to me...

614
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:53,455
If you want friendship,
I'm a hero man...

615
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:56,995
If anyone dares go against me,
I'll take his life...

616
00:42:02,637 --> 00:42:05,401
y our eyes are double barrel gun....

617
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:08,474
Don't fire at my little heart...

618
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:11,373
y ou're thin baby Taliban...

619
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:14,878
y our shouts can't scare me,
Andhra Shahrukh Khan...

620
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:20,554
Will you come to a film?

621
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,383
Film...film...NTR film...

622
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:26,492
Will you see his film
and dance like him?

623
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,718
Sword fight like Kantha Rao...

624
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,552
I was born before you,
challenging me...

625
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:01,923
Stop getting smart with me...

626
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:10,530
I'm a good man in appearance...

627
00:43:10,705 --> 00:43:13,731
Dealing with me is tough...

628
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:16,308
Stop acting naive and innocent...

629
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:19,939
I'm a man, don't incite me,
it's loss to you only...

630
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,352
That's all!

631
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,794
Why are you so dejected?
Watch out now!

632
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:39,955
Play!

633
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:39,989
What's exactly is your problem?

634
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,454
What's exactly is your problem?

635
00:44:42,627 --> 00:44:46,085
The exact problem is,
sister loves roses.

636
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:48,732
We didn't know this
and gave it to Ajay.

637
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:53,769
As repentance, l've filled
sister's room with roses.

638
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:56,472
She asked who sent it,
l said Muddukrishna.

639
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,768
l didn't take out a print,
Muddukrishna did it.

640
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,102
Why would he do it?
- l don't know, go ask him.

641
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:04,077
lf sister asks, tell it's you.

642
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:10,453
Muddu! ls it you?
- Yes, it's me.

643
00:45:13,658 --> 00:45:15,558
Grandpa! Girija is slapping me.

644
00:45:16,061 --> 00:45:19,792
l took up to a print, why did you
imprint your hand on his cheek?

645
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:29,698
Bloody fool!
You damaged my image.

646
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:33,135
l didn't damage it, infact helped you
not to manage it anymore.

647
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,472
Now you can happily be
what you are.

648
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:37,137
Why are you bothered
about my character?

649
00:45:37,315 --> 00:45:41,649
Because l like your real character
of doing what you like.

650
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:45,247
lf l'm wrong, please forgive me.

651
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:49,553
lf it's big sin, still forgive me.
What to do?

652
00:45:57,335 --> 00:45:58,563
Sub Jail, Chittoor

653
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:04,575
Brother is coming out.

654
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:10,239
Brother! Why did he go to the jail?
- Brother hit DSP's son.

655
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:15,081
Move man!
DSP's son

656
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:17,753
How dare you beat me with ball?

657
00:46:18,256 --> 00:46:20,747
Do you know who l am?
l'll kill you.

658
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:26,428
How dare you beat my son?
Book a case and arrest him.

659
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:29,589
Brother many happy returns.

660
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:32,565
Many happy returns?
l'm coming out of jail.

661
00:46:32,737 --> 00:46:33,533
Not from Switzerland.

662
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:35,764
Brother, our bus is ready,
let's to go our village.

663
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:37,165
Bloody!

664
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:41,369
l didn't spend 3 months
in jail to go home silently.

665
00:46:41,546 --> 00:46:47,576
3 months...3 months...
it's burning inside. lt's boiling!

666
00:46:47,752 --> 00:46:50,550
What shall we do now?
Shall we finish DSP?

667
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:53,918
Not DSP!

668
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:06,495
Jayamma, it's 3 month gap...
- Move away!

669
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:08,832
lt's 3 month gap...
- Leave me, fool!

670
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:12,166
Trouble has erupted again between
your brother-in-law Seshadri & Mahendra.

671
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:14,403
lf you stay here, you'll die,
go to your village.

672
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,171
Who will dare kill me?
Come in please...

673
00:47:16,348 --> 00:47:17,610
Shut up...idly is steaming.

674
00:47:17,782 --> 00:47:19,807
We can come back before it steams.
Come in please.

675
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:21,846
How can we go in?
My husband is inside.

676
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:23,279
Whose husband? Your husband?

677
00:47:23,455 --> 00:47:25,650
No, your husband.
Mrithyunjaya Naidu.

678
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:30,620
Uncle! What is he doing here?
He's coming!

679
00:47:30,795 --> 00:47:31,819
Nephew!

680
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:34,358
You came her straight
from jail, right uncle?

681
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:36,966
Yes, l came straight here,
never stopped at anywhere.

682
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:39,270
Uncle, you're also burning inside, right?

683
00:47:39,437 --> 00:47:41,667
Heat is unbearable.
- Bloody idiot!

684
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,365
Did you see boys?
Uncle is real man!

685
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:45,941
l came here to clear that doubt.

686
00:47:46,278 --> 00:47:48,644
Tell me uncle, when shall we
bump off that Mahendra?

687
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:50,280
He must give us a chance first.
- How shall we do it?

688
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:52,279
At an opportune time
when there's no one around...

689
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:56,409
Why do you also say time
like my father?

690
00:47:56,588 --> 00:48:01,548
l'll leave this eatery only after killing
atleast one man in Mahendra's camp.

691
00:48:01,726 --> 00:48:03,455
Me too!

692
00:48:05,864 --> 00:48:08,196
Children!

693
00:48:14,306 --> 00:48:18,709
Hey! Get me only one...
dozen bottles.

694
00:48:18,877 --> 00:48:19,741
Have a go!

695
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:36,388
Hey cool drink for you.

696
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:43,000
Muddu, cool drink for you.

697
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:44,893
Cheating girl.

698
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:57,443
l hear DTS sounds inside,
my urine bladder is full.

699
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:02,753
Dear, cool drink for you.

700
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:05,048
My hands are busy,
pour into mouth please.

701
00:49:09,327 --> 00:49:10,760
Pour Girija!

702
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:12,787
Wait!

703
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:16,729
lt's houseful!

704
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,461
l thought of teasing him
but caught up with this fool.

705
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:21,434
Come on pour.

706
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:24,001
lt's houseful here too!

707
00:49:24,342 --> 00:49:28,278
Each one should've a bathroom,
only then it'll be clean,

708
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:30,607
and body too!

709
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:37,779
What are you doing?
- Giving it a water wash.

710
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:45,493
Cool drink with your hands
is like intoxicating liquor.

711
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:47,722
Come on pour Girija!

712
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:51,892
l don't know what to do,
let anything happen.

713
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,435
My style is different.

714
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:55,869
Get up, Telugu warrior...

715
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,065
Unzip your pant...

716
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,073
To free the body, urinate out!

717
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:06,043
Pour correctly, Girija.

718
00:50:06,384 --> 00:50:09,820
Just now l knew it's so happy.

719
00:50:16,428 --> 00:50:17,656
Who is it?

720
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,123
lnto my mouth?

721
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:34,101
Red half sari! Butt her!

722
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:57,363
lt's coming after your red dress,
go sideways...

723
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:15,112
Where is your half sari?
- Ajay stripped it.

724
00:51:17,622 --> 00:51:20,386
She's thanking God for
Ajay stripping her half sari.

725
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:21,547
My fate! lt's all your parenting.

726
00:51:21,726 --> 00:51:25,059
Yes, l taught her to thank God
if anyone strips her half sari.

727
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:28,729
Shut up!
There's nothing worse than this.

728
00:51:29,968 --> 00:51:32,061
Somebody pissed on my face.

729
00:51:33,638 --> 00:51:35,037
This is worse than that.

730
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:40,838
lf your uncle knows you put the
cloth on the statue, he'll kill you.

731
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:45,073
You know about the statue
and the story behind it.

732
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:49,045
Your father left this house
because of him only.

733
00:51:55,927 --> 00:51:57,155
Stop, uncle!

734
00:51:57,795 --> 00:51:59,558
lt wasn't Ajay's mistake.

735
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:02,461
Bull chased me seeing in red sari,
he removed and threw it.

736
00:52:02,634 --> 00:52:04,761
lt fell on the statue.

737
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:08,038
lf he hadn't done that,
l would be dead by now.

738
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:10,834
You're saved because
of Girija today,

739
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:14,775
if you do anything like
this again, l'll kill you.

740
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:28,721
No, l must thank you.
- Yes, you must thank me.

741
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:32,260
lf hadn't saved your life,
your statue would stand next to it.

742
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:35,123
l can never understand you.

743
00:52:39,971 --> 00:52:41,632
He'll not meet anyone.

744
00:52:41,806 --> 00:52:45,071
Tell me who has to die,
how much advance?

745
00:52:45,243 --> 00:52:47,643
How much after job is done?

746
00:52:57,655 --> 00:53:00,146
Mangapuram 10 kms

747
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:04,988
Call him.

748
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:06,986
Hey Ajay! Come here.

749
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:09,693
Why did you call me?

750
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:13,931
Take chocolate.
Today is my happy birthday.

751
00:53:14,105 --> 00:53:16,005
But l don't see happiness
on your face.

752
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:19,103
Just wishes will not do,

753
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:21,074
she's crying because
there's no cake also to cut,

754
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,110
get a cake from the town.

755
00:53:23,848 --> 00:53:25,713
Uncle will beat me
if l go out of the village.

756
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,180
Find someone else.

757
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:29,179
l'll kiss you,
if you get me a cake.

758
00:53:32,223 --> 00:53:33,520
Tell him like that.

759
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:35,522
l'll kiss you,
if you get me a cake.

760
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,788
Girija, don't talk to him.

761
00:53:37,962 --> 00:53:39,793
Your father told me to see
that you don't talk to him.

762
00:53:39,964 --> 00:53:42,125
Tell me if you need anything.

763
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:46,028
lt seems Girija will kiss anyone
who brings cake from the town.

764
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,699
l'll get it. l'll change dress.

765
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:53,868
After bringing cake,
l must brush the teeth.

766
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:56,346
But l don't know to drive.

767
00:53:56,814 --> 00:53:58,873
Ajay, you come with me.
- Why me?

768
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,042
When l go at 120 kms speed,
who will carry the cake safely?

769
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,346
Come with me.

770
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:07,257
He's going overboard.
Will take him to task.

771
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:10,356
About the kiss, it's for you only.

772
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:17,659
Getting into romantic mood,
fallen in love?

773
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:19,060
Nothing like that.

774
00:54:19,904 --> 00:54:21,963
How many people did you
kiss by betting?

775
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:25,735
l want to be good,
but you never allow it.

776
00:54:28,846 --> 00:54:33,749
Even if l do, when l think about
Gita's matter, l want to kill you.

777
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:37,079
You're angry about
Gita's matter, right?

778
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:38,919
Okay, l'll tell you the truth.

779
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:43,349
That day, i didn't call Gita to the
room, infact she called me.

780
00:54:46,164 --> 00:54:51,932
Please listen to me.
Take me somewhere and marry me.

781
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:55,203
lt's not big deal to take you.

782
00:54:55,373 --> 00:54:59,275
lf l take you, they will never
forgive me in this life.

783
00:55:00,044 --> 00:55:01,773
Even that's not stopping me.

784
00:55:02,046 --> 00:55:04,879
They will say like father like son.

785
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:06,676
l don't want them to say it.

786
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:12,319
Open the door....open it...
what is she doing in?- Open the door.

787
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:14,124
What should l do now?

788
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:15,956
Looks like everyone in
the family will know it.

789
00:55:16,127 --> 00:55:16,957
Open the door, Gita.

790
00:55:17,128 --> 00:55:19,619
Come quickly,
what are you doing inside?

791
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,791
Gita, l love you, let's elope.
Please listen to me.

792
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:27,130
Will you elope with my daughter?

793
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:31,271
Okay? Clear now?

794
00:55:47,825 --> 00:55:49,053
Brother-in-law!

795
00:55:50,928 --> 00:55:54,193
How come you're here?
Uncle will kill us if he comes to know.

796
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:58,028
l didn't come just like that,
l've a love message from sister.

797
00:55:58,202 --> 00:56:01,000
For you only, sister sent it.

798
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:05,331
He has gone into coma.

799
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:11,009
Brother-in-law! Half sari message.

800
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:44,211
Oh dear! Feeling shy already!

801
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,248
A pining that's heartbreaking...

802
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:52,376
Tell me my love....
is it pangs of separation in heart?

803
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:56,423
Is it bliss to forget yourself?

804
00:56:56,592 --> 00:57:00,426
Laugh it out...

805
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:04,123
Open out your secrets...

806
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,165
Though surrounded by hurdles...

807
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,235
In the hidden honeycombs...

808
00:57:08,404 --> 00:57:12,397
I came like a dragonfly
but found honey in my lap...

809
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:16,443
Millions were after me...

810
00:57:16,612 --> 00:57:21,208
y ou took me away
with just one sight...

811
00:57:21,383 --> 00:57:29,415
Let me taste the sweetness of
your song and kiss, come dear...

812
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:33,585
What's this anxiety?
What's this overwhelming feeling?

813
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:37,528
I'm having strange feelings...

814
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:22,307
I've seen your virgin beauty
today only...

815
00:58:22,478 --> 00:58:26,437
I've arrested you in my heart
with my manliness...

816
00:58:26,615 --> 00:58:30,574
I was like a statue...
I was cursed one...

817
00:58:30,753 --> 00:58:34,621
I've seen love hidden deep inside...

818
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:39,124
I've become queen in your heart...

819
00:58:39,295 --> 00:58:43,288
Ebullient youth is asking
for new tastes...

820
00:58:43,465 --> 00:58:47,196
Take revenge on my thin waist...

821
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:51,135
y our structure is ravishing...

822
00:58:51,307 --> 00:58:55,403
Appear romantically to me...

823
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:59,344
Till yesterday I said many things,
called you informally...

824
00:58:59,515 --> 00:59:03,508
Today I'm standing silently
unable to say anything...

825
00:59:03,686 --> 00:59:07,417
That's normal, dear,
it's called as love...

826
00:59:07,723 --> 00:59:09,623
It brings two hearts closer...

827
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:48,786
I discovered myself in your eyes...

828
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:52,897
I opened my heart for you only...

829
00:59:53,235 --> 00:59:56,898
Come on dear, scold me...

830
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:01,300
I smiled when you cried...

831
01:00:01,477 --> 01:00:05,607
I discovered now
all smiles were for you...

832
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:09,808
My love has blossomed...
under the sari...

833
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:13,644
y our pink cheeks have
narrated the love tales...

834
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:21,820
Oh God my secrets!
Don't open it...

835
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:25,827
With a green half sari,
you trapped me...

836
01:00:26,168 --> 01:00:30,161
I've not had much good times in life,
show it to me now...

837
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:34,173
I was waiting for you to
change your route...

838
01:00:34,343 --> 01:00:38,939
I took you to my route
and changed you...

839
01:00:56,598 --> 01:00:58,395
Ajay, stop in that eatery,
savouries are tasty here.

840
01:00:58,567 --> 01:00:59,898
Won't you get tasty savoury at home?

841
01:01:00,068 --> 01:01:00,591
Stop the car man.

842
01:01:00,936 --> 01:01:04,497
Jayamma, an omelette
with fresh laid egg.

843
01:01:04,673 --> 01:01:07,233
l'll burn you with freshly burnt spatula.

844
01:01:10,913 --> 01:01:13,074
Come here boys!

845
01:01:14,016 --> 01:01:15,074
Take your hands off him.

846
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,411
Which place are you from?

847
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,419
Which place l am asking you?

848
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,423
Why don't you talk to me?
Are you dumb?

849
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:27,252
Have you lost power of speech
in the fear of seeing me?

850
01:01:27,996 --> 01:01:29,258
Bloody! l'll thrash you!

851
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:33,367
Bloody wastrel!
Why are you talking too much?

852
01:01:33,535 --> 01:01:36,595
l'll stab you, why do you want
to know our details?

853
01:01:36,939 --> 01:01:38,167
l'll cut it.
- What?

854
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,400
You asked me who am l?
l'll tell you.

855
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:43,374
Mahendra Naidu's relative.

856
01:01:43,545 --> 01:01:44,375
You...

857
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:47,208
Brother...brother!
Mahendra Naidu's relatives.

858
01:01:47,382 --> 01:01:52,945
l blurted out in emotion.
Get out from here fast. Go...danger...

859
01:02:04,566 --> 01:02:05,555
Catch them!

860
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:09,299
Start the vehicles!

861
01:02:31,493 --> 01:02:33,324
Watch in the front!

862
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:08,656
How did you let them to go
despite so tight security?

863
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,474
Come fast....run...

864
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:32,219
l'm scared!
- What to do now?

865
01:03:35,324 --> 01:03:36,723
Where will you go now?

866
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:41,055
Save me...

867
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:43,554
Go...run away..

868
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:49,729
Sit here...sit here...

869
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:54,731
Brother, please...
please, listen to me once...

870
01:03:55,143 --> 01:03:56,405
Just once please.

871
01:03:58,714 --> 01:04:00,841
Brother, they are kids.

872
01:04:01,183 --> 01:04:04,414
Settle it between elders,
leave we kids.

873
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,412
Please brother.

874
01:04:06,688 --> 01:04:10,681
Please brother, kids...
Please leave us, brother.

875
01:04:10,859 --> 01:04:14,260
l'm telling you, please leave us.

876
01:04:23,538 --> 01:04:25,233
Leave me...

877
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:29,275
They spilled chilly powder into my eyes!

878
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:01,799
Brother-in-law!

879
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:49,687
Dare beat now!

880
01:05:55,197 --> 01:05:56,687
Brother-in-law!

881
01:06:00,702 --> 01:06:02,363
Are you fine?

882
01:08:00,322 --> 01:08:00,981
Come...come...

883
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:04,981
Come!

884
01:08:34,856 --> 01:08:36,380
Brother-in-law!

885
01:08:36,558 --> 01:08:39,686
That family is mine,
they are my people!

886
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:43,627
You've to take on me first
before you reach them.

887
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:45,356
Remember that!

888
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,026
Bloody!

889
01:09:07,155 --> 01:09:08,816
Like father like son!

890
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,514
He too never cared about the family.

891
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:11,624
You too have become like him.

892
01:09:11,793 --> 01:09:12,885
Uncle, please listen to me.

893
01:09:13,061 --> 01:09:15,120
What's there for you to say?
- Brother-in-law!

894
01:09:15,397 --> 01:09:16,989
Take him away, why are you
calling him brother-in-law?

895
01:09:17,165 --> 01:09:19,429
Kick him...kick him and
throw him out.

896
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:21,569
He took the children out.
Kick him.

897
01:09:21,736 --> 01:09:23,567
Please listen to what l say.
- Shut up!

898
01:09:24,472 --> 01:09:27,669
We are done with you,
never show your face to me again.

899
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:28,740
Go away!

900
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,910
Come!

901
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:37,015
Brother-in-law!

902
01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:49,461
Though we were so many,
we couldn't kill one man.

903
01:09:49,631 --> 01:09:51,929
We couldn't because
we were too many.

904
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,197
Yes, we took it easy because
we out numbered them.

905
01:09:56,538 --> 01:10:00,099
He hit us softly but
we took it hard.

906
01:10:00,442 --> 01:10:04,708
Shut up bastards!
Don't tell this to anyone at home.

907
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:09,473
Like father like son!

908
01:10:09,647 --> 01:10:12,844
He too never cared about the family.
You too have become like him.

909
01:10:16,654 --> 01:10:20,055
Unable to harm us here, Seshadri got
our relatives killed in Madras,

910
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,385
He's the man who did it.
Move away.

911
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,649
Move, kill him.

912
01:10:23,828 --> 01:10:29,232
Uncle, you'll kill him now,
what will happen in future?

913
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,129
They will go to another place
and kill our relatives,

914
01:10:31,302 --> 01:10:33,497
We'll start with him and wipe out
entire clan of Seshadri.

915
01:10:33,671 --> 01:10:35,605
What will they do then?
Move away.

916
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:41,507
Before you kill their family,
they will kill few in our family,

917
01:10:41,812 --> 01:10:44,576
who gave you or them the right
to sacrifice lives of innocents?

918
01:10:44,748 --> 01:10:45,646
What do you want us to do?

919
01:10:45,816 --> 01:10:49,217
You want us to leave him
and sit like eunuchs.

920
01:10:49,386 --> 01:10:51,081
Why are you talking to him?

921
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:53,587
He's inspired by
Puchchalapalli Sundarayya.

922
01:10:53,757 --> 01:10:57,625
He removed Reddy from his name
and he removed Naidu.

923
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:01,629
He too donated like him all the
wealth he got as his share.

924
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:05,667
He made slaves to become bosses
as we watched.

925
01:11:05,836 --> 01:11:08,828
He's misfit in our family.
Throw him out.

926
01:11:09,173 --> 01:11:11,437
Want to kill him,
go ahead kill him.

927
01:11:11,609 --> 01:11:14,806
Kill him but remember one thing,

928
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:19,310
the moment he dies,
l'll stand along with Seshadri Naidu.

929
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,781
When he comes to know
about this killing,

930
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:24,849
he'll kill atleast one man
in our family,

931
01:11:26,357 --> 01:11:28,882
l'll become that one man.
- Don't listen to him, kill him.

932
01:11:29,226 --> 01:11:31,660
Stop! You know very well about him.

933
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,194
When he says, he'll do it.

934
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:35,628
Will you let him die willingly?

935
01:11:43,807 --> 01:11:44,899
Go!

936
01:11:56,754 --> 01:11:59,655
Uncle! Stop...

937
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:08,754
Uncle...

938
01:12:11,235 --> 01:12:12,167
Brother!

939
01:12:13,237 --> 01:12:15,262
We are done with you forever.

940
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:17,907
Never show your face to me again.
Go away!

941
01:12:21,345 --> 01:12:24,542
Son, that is your family.

942
01:12:25,249 --> 01:12:28,685
They may say you anything
getting angry on me,

943
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,786
you don't care about it,

944
01:12:31,355 --> 01:12:33,448
never leave that home.

945
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:37,955
This is my last wish, son.

946
01:12:40,631 --> 01:12:42,963
Everything happened because of me.

947
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,463
Uncles are not listening to me.
Something may happen to him.

948
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:48,901
Don't worry sister,
brother-in-law will be safe.

949
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,539
He beat 20 people,
he can send another 20 into coma.

950
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,575
But l'm not scared about that.

951
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:58,545
l'm scared of anything happening
to us in his absence.

952
01:13:06,323 --> 01:13:07,813
He'll not meet anyone.

953
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:31,606
Don't stop, get going!

954
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:38,819
Breaking news!

955
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:41,457
Popular politician Mahendra Naidu
of Chittoor district,

956
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:45,584
his family was attacked with bombs
simultaneously at home and on him.

957
01:13:45,763 --> 01:13:48,857
But all of them escaped
with small wounds.

958
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:55,294
Grandpa always told you're
a well wisher of both families,

959
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:56,939
that's why l've come to you,

960
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:01,569
if there's problem, they have to
settle it between themselves,

961
01:14:01,745 --> 01:14:03,474
what's this trying to kill
women and children?

962
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,842
l've tried to tell them
in many ways,

963
01:14:06,016 --> 01:14:11,613
Seshadri says they started it,
l'll finish it.

964
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:16,448
Not they, l'll finish them.

965
01:14:20,397 --> 01:14:23,696
Such a big feud for killing one man,

966
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:26,700
if you do anything in rashness,

967
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:30,897
and if anyone gets killed again,

968
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:33,668
it will become a deadly never
ending battle of death.

969
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,038
Think about it.

970
01:14:37,548 --> 01:14:39,482
Uncle! Remember me?

971
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:41,413
l don't have any necessity
to remember anyone,

972
01:14:41,585 --> 01:14:44,486
let it be anyone,
he must only remember me.

973
01:14:46,824 --> 01:14:49,588
Are you here to fight me?

974
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,557
When two fight, it's fighting,

975
01:14:51,729 --> 01:14:53,754
You don't call it fight
if one beats up another,

976
01:14:53,931 --> 01:14:56,593
you call it thrashing.
- You mean, will you thrash me now?

977
01:14:57,501 --> 01:14:58,559
l'll beat you so that you won't get up.

978
01:14:58,736 --> 01:14:59,998
Will you thrash me so that
l'm useless for anything?

979
01:15:00,337 --> 01:15:01,099
Are you useful for anything?

980
01:15:01,438 --> 01:15:02,427
Same thing my concubine too told me.

981
01:15:02,606 --> 01:15:04,665
You've a concubine too?
- Did you see face?

982
01:15:06,076 --> 01:15:09,011
Why are you diverting the topic?
Who chased us yesterday?

983
01:15:09,346 --> 01:15:10,438
Seshadri Naidu's youngest son.

984
01:15:10,614 --> 01:15:11,774
Where is he now?
- How would l know?

985
01:15:11,949 --> 01:15:13,780
He'll be in some hospital
getting beaten up you.

986
01:15:13,951 --> 01:15:15,009
Go and find.

987
01:15:15,352 --> 01:15:16,341
Look down!

988
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,557
Tell me.

989
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:23,022
lf you promise to leave me,
l'll give you an idea.

990
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,523
Won't you tell without promise?
This is not option, this is a threat.

991
01:15:26,697 --> 01:15:28,062
Tell me...tell me...
- l'll tell.

992
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,832
Seshadri Naidu dotes his daughter.

993
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,059
He loves his son-in-law very much.

994
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,531
His son-in-law is coming in a train
from Bangalore to see her.

995
01:15:35,773 --> 01:15:36,831
lf you want kill him.

996
01:15:37,007 --> 01:15:39,032
Brother, you're giving me an idea,

997
01:15:39,376 --> 01:15:42,140
l'm sure a big army will be there
in station to receive him.

998
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,037
lf take away the knife,
l'll tell you another idea.

999
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:46,042
You kill him is the earlier station.

1000
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:48,817
How will he look like?

1001
01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:17,679
l'm coming!

1002
01:16:24,421 --> 01:16:27,754
Hey stop!

1003
01:16:29,426 --> 01:16:32,156
ls it pure water or bore water?
- Pure bore water.

1004
01:16:32,496 --> 01:16:34,691
Never cheat customers.
- Are you Seshadri's son-in-law?

1005
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:36,924
Yes...why?- Look there,
people are coming to kill you.

1006
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,193
Come on...
- Who are they?

1007
01:16:39,536 --> 01:16:41,731
Your father-in-law's enemies,
if they get you, you're dead.

1008
01:16:41,905 --> 01:16:43,600
Run away!
- My bag is in the train, l'll get it.

1009
01:16:43,774 --> 01:16:47,107
You want bag or life?

1010
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:52,445
l didn't know my father-in-law
has so many enemies here.

1011
01:16:52,616 --> 01:16:53,173
They belong to other state.

1012
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:55,849
Then, Tirupathi Venkatesha,
Kanipakkam Ganesha.

1013
01:16:56,019 --> 01:16:58,817
Lord! Why did you let my wife
take birth here?

1014
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,217
Brother, run without seeing behind.

1015
01:17:00,557 --> 01:17:02,047
You too come after me.

1016
01:17:22,813 --> 01:17:25,145
He's coming amidst blasting bombs.

1017
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:28,878
l think his body is bomb proof.

1018
01:17:32,155 --> 01:17:34,988
Send us away, we'll face our fates.

1019
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:39,060
lt's not safe to be outside now.
- ls it safe here?

1020
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:41,220
This house has been bombed,
there's no safety here also.

1021
01:17:41,565 --> 01:17:44,193
Anyway, it's not good for you to
play with our lives for your politics.

1022
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:50,496
Didn't you think about this when
you sought favours from me?

1023
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:54,007
l'll do what l have to,
sit tight here.

1024
01:18:03,186 --> 01:18:03,880
Guru...

1025
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,648
Seshadri Naidu, Mahendra has
come to compromise.

1026
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:09,087
Purushottam Naidu will call you
for a compromise.

1027
01:18:09,259 --> 01:18:11,557
Don't let the opportunity go.

1028
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:14,060
lt's good for you and
your supporters like me.

1029
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,592
Will Mahendra give
his MP seat to me?

1030
01:18:18,769 --> 01:18:21,135
Who is he to give me?
ls he CM or high command?

1031
01:18:21,305 --> 01:18:23,967
Will he give seat?
Tell him, we'll take it by force.

1032
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:26,006
Yes, father.
We'll not spare him.

1033
01:18:26,176 --> 01:18:28,542
Did you hear my sons?

1034
01:18:28,712 --> 01:18:31,943
l'll spare them only when my dead
brother-in-law comes back alive.

1035
01:18:32,115 --> 01:18:33,639
Let bygones be bygones.

1036
01:18:33,817 --> 01:18:36,308
Don't worry about past,
watch what's unfolding in future.

1037
01:18:36,653 --> 01:18:39,986
Has his ground shaken with
a bomb going off on his head?

1038
01:18:40,157 --> 01:18:42,216
From tomorrow a bomb
will go off everyday.

1039
01:18:42,559 --> 01:18:43,924
Tell him to keep watching it.

1040
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:47,287
Excellent brother!
You spoke like a great man!

1041
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:52,895
Sir, son-in-law is not in the train.
- What happened?

1042
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:54,002
Only his luggage is there.

1043
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:55,934
Did you search entire train?
- We have sir.

1044
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,074
lt seems son-in-law is missing.

1045
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:04,239
By now he would've killed him.
- Whom?- That guy!

1046
01:19:05,248 --> 01:19:08,342
What if he misses him
and gets caught?

1047
01:19:08,685 --> 01:19:11,620
What if he gets caught and tells
them l gave the information?

1048
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:14,313
Whom?
- To them!

1049
01:19:15,225 --> 01:19:19,719
So, l'll go and tell them that
he has kidnapped him.

1050
01:19:19,896 --> 01:19:23,593
By the way, who is this he?
- l'll tell them who is that he?

1051
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:27,232
So many are here, find the
whereabouts of son-in-law.

1052
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:29,231
Father-in-law!

1053
01:19:30,573 --> 01:19:31,631
Son-in-law!

1054
01:19:34,277 --> 01:19:35,744
What happened son-in-law?

1055
01:19:35,911 --> 01:19:40,143
l almost died reaching here.

1056
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:43,046
Tell me clearly, brother-in-law.
Did anyone tried to kill you?

1057
01:19:43,219 --> 01:19:45,312
Not just one but many tried to kill me.

1058
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:49,250
They threw bombs at me,
they gave me a tour of Chittoor.

1059
01:19:49,592 --> 01:19:52,720
Though l'm a software engineer,
they behaved very hard with me.

1060
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:56,023
God came as brother and
saved me in time.

1061
01:19:57,033 --> 01:19:58,057
Who is he?

1062
01:19:58,234 --> 01:20:01,203
He said he's enemy of your enemy.
- Who is the enemy?

1063
01:20:02,705 --> 01:20:05,367
You look like a kid,
what's your enmity with him?

1064
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:07,972
Mahendra Naidu is
my father's enemy.

1065
01:20:08,144 --> 01:20:11,307
l share not only my father's blood
but his enmity too.

1066
01:20:11,647 --> 01:20:12,739
Brother, superb.

1067
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:15,213
What's the enmity between
your father and Mahendra?

1068
01:20:15,384 --> 01:20:18,114
My father and Mahendra were
once close friends,

1069
01:20:18,287 --> 01:20:22,348
my father used to look after his
business interests in Hyderabad,

1070
01:20:22,692 --> 01:20:25,786
once a building built by my father
came crashing down,

1071
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:28,054
he accused my father did it,

1072
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:30,061
after some time real estate crashed,

1073
01:20:30,232 --> 01:20:31,961
my father was accused of doing it too.

1074
01:20:32,134 --> 01:20:34,295
What's the connection between
crumbling real estate and your father?

1075
01:20:34,637 --> 01:20:36,195
That's what my father went
and asked him.

1076
01:20:36,372 --> 01:20:37,134
What did he say?

1077
01:20:37,306 --> 01:20:38,739
He asked him but didn't get any reply.

1078
01:20:38,908 --> 01:20:41,308
He was beaten up and sent to jail.

1079
01:20:41,644 --> 01:20:45,307
l came to Mangapuram to ask
why they sent my father to jail?- Then?

1080
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:48,045
When l went there, house was empty.

1081
01:20:48,217 --> 01:20:53,712
Then l came to know they are hiding
in fear from Tiger Seshadri.

1082
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,752
With no other way to go,
l went back to railway station.

1083
01:20:56,926 --> 01:20:59,690
At the same time, his people
were after brother's life...

1084
01:20:59,862 --> 01:21:02,330
Brother-in-law...

1085
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:04,997
Mahendra Naidu's man
kidnapped son-n-law.

1086
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:07,158
Me only?

1087
01:21:07,403 --> 01:21:10,668
They tried but brother saved me.
- Which brother?

1088
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,068
This brother!

1089
01:21:14,844 --> 01:21:15,674
This brother?

1090
01:21:15,845 --> 01:21:18,006
How did you save my brother-in-law
from a big gang?

1091
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:23,208
l feel from their inquiry that they are
not happy about saving your life.

1092
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:25,946
Yes, l too feel the same.

1093
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:27,350
Atleast you tell them, father-in-law.

1094
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:30,750
Let him be anyone, he saved our
son-in-law, so he's our man now.

1095
01:21:30,926 --> 01:21:32,689
That's not the main issue,

1096
01:21:32,862 --> 01:21:37,128
main thing is how did they
know about his train journey.

1097
01:21:37,299 --> 01:21:38,857
Find that first.

1098
01:21:39,502 --> 01:21:43,495
Son-in-law, come to see my grandson.
Come.- Come brother.

1099
01:21:44,373 --> 01:21:47,171
Where are you going man?
What's this twist?

1100
01:21:47,343 --> 01:21:50,369
He says you saved his life.
- Ask him.

1101
01:21:50,713 --> 01:21:52,112
Can't you tell me?

1102
01:21:53,048 --> 01:21:54,481
This is not a threat, just a question.

1103
01:21:54,817 --> 01:21:56,808
What's the use in killing him?

1104
01:21:56,986 --> 01:21:59,045
l'm here to kill the family head himself.

1105
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:01,917
Kill head of the family?
- Will you dare stop me?

1106
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:03,149
l'll tell him now.
- l'll also tell him.

1107
01:22:03,325 --> 01:22:07,455
What will you tell him?
- That you gave the railway station idea.

1108
01:22:08,063 --> 01:22:10,224
You've afflicted me like swine flu.

1109
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,526
l've already booked seat
for you in kindergarten.

1110
01:22:12,868 --> 01:22:14,733
Brother! How is my son?

1111
01:22:14,904 --> 01:22:16,132
Very handsome.

1112
01:22:16,305 --> 01:22:18,068
Absolutely no resemblance with you.

1113
01:22:18,974 --> 01:22:20,373
He resembles elderly man.

1114
01:22:22,244 --> 01:22:24,906
l'll take leave now.
- Have food and go, brother.

1115
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:27,508
My stomach is full after
meeting the elderly man,

1116
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,750
this is enough for this life,

1117
01:22:29,985 --> 01:22:31,384
this is my last meeting.

1118
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:35,518
Hold him, Lakshmi.

1119
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:40,453
Stop...stop...stop...
Why did you say last meeting?

1120
01:22:40,796 --> 01:22:43,264
l saved your life,
so they will not spare me.

1121
01:22:43,432 --> 01:22:47,095
They know all the details about me.
They will kill me.

1122
01:22:47,536 --> 01:22:51,370
By now people would be waiting for
me in bus stand and railway station.

1123
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:53,303
How can you go now, brother?

1124
01:22:53,476 --> 01:22:58,038
No problem, l saved your life,
l was lucky to meet lion,

1125
01:22:58,214 --> 01:23:00,182
this is enough for this life.

1126
01:23:00,349 --> 01:23:01,281
Stop brother.

1127
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:03,543
Father-in-law, he save my life
and put his life in danger,

1128
01:23:03,886 --> 01:23:05,046
please save him, father-in-law.

1129
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:07,781
lf he's so scared,
let him stay here for few days.

1130
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:09,958
Your order, l'll stay sir.

1131
01:23:10,793 --> 01:23:13,785
Father-in-law said, your life is safe now.
You can stay here bravely.

1132
01:23:13,963 --> 01:23:17,126
Arrange for his stay here.
- Should l do it?

1133
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,796
You heard it right, come.

1134
01:23:21,203 --> 01:23:24,172
What's your scheme?
- You want coaching?

1135
01:23:24,807 --> 01:23:25,466
Brother!

1136
01:23:25,908 --> 01:23:29,469
Are you staying here?
- Elderly man asked me to stay.

1137
01:23:31,547 --> 01:23:33,981
Do you know why l hit you?
- l don't know.

1138
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:38,017
To tell you that, l suspect you.
- Can't you say it with mouth?

1139
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:40,587
Hereafter l'll keep an eye on you.

1140
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:48,997
Don't smile like mad man, hold it.

1141
01:23:50,165 --> 01:23:52,326
This is common to me.

1142
01:23:57,973 --> 01:24:00,999
Do you know why l hit you?
- l think you too suspect me.

1143
01:24:01,176 --> 01:24:04,168
Not only that other than me
nobody should sit in this chair.

1144
01:24:04,346 --> 01:24:05,438
Got it?

1145
01:24:09,285 --> 01:24:10,877
You know about that chair, right?
Why didn't you tell me?

1146
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:14,614
You said you'll run over them,
to let you know them l kep quiet.

1147
01:24:14,957 --> 01:24:17,289
Actually people here...
- Please don't touch that bottle also.

1148
01:24:17,459 --> 01:24:21,520
Why?- When elderly man kills Mahendra Naidu,
saved it to celebrate then.

1149
01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:22,592
That's it.

1150
01:24:23,566 --> 01:24:25,557
l knew they were fools but
didn't think they were so foolish.

1151
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:28,028
You may not know this,
my brother-in-law is crook,

1152
01:24:28,203 --> 01:24:30,865
my brother-in-law's sons are
worse crooks than him.

1153
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,007
Flash news!
- What's it?

1154
01:24:33,175 --> 01:24:35,040
l'm worse crook than
they all together.

1155
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,044
Brothers are suspecting him,
stay with him and find about him.

1156
01:24:43,052 --> 01:24:45,384
l'm totally confused.

1157
01:24:46,221 --> 01:24:48,451
What if l kill Ajay?

1158
01:24:48,624 --> 01:24:49,989
You don't have that capacity, uncle.

1159
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,389
He went that side,
when did he go this side?

1160
01:24:53,929 --> 01:24:56,591
Who is it?
- Brahmam...Parabrahmam.

1161
01:24:56,932 --> 01:24:58,490
Check the fancy number!

1162
01:24:58,901 --> 01:24:59,560
ls it you brother?

1163
01:24:59,902 --> 01:25:01,267
l didn't see your fancy number
in tension, brother.

1164
01:25:01,437 --> 01:25:04,406
l told you to chant my name
whenever you feel tension.

1165
01:25:04,573 --> 01:25:06,097
This tension is giving me
lose motions.

1166
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:08,300
A boy is giving me jitters.

1167
01:25:08,477 --> 01:25:11,071
Stop the rhyme and tell me his details.

1168
01:25:13,415 --> 01:25:16,077
Brother, you must come here.
- l'll come.- When?

1169
01:25:16,251 --> 01:25:18,116
Heroes will not come first or last,

1170
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:21,415
they will come at the right time.
l'm a real hero.

1171
01:25:34,269 --> 01:25:36,464
Oh my God! Why is he coming here?

1172
01:25:47,182 --> 01:25:50,709
Hey Das! What happened to you?
Why don't you talk to me?

1173
01:25:51,053 --> 01:25:52,111
What happened to him?

1174
01:25:52,287 --> 01:25:54,755
Somebody hit his head,
brain damaged.

1175
01:25:55,157 --> 01:25:59,423
Didn't you see in films, if you hit on
head again, he'll regain memory.

1176
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:01,563
Right! Where's the baton?

1177
01:26:05,634 --> 01:26:09,297
Looks like it'll work,
hit him whenever anyone is free.

1178
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:10,403
You come brother.

1179
01:26:11,707 --> 01:26:12,571
Hit him.

1180
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:16,337
Who are you?

1181
01:26:19,548 --> 01:26:21,539
What's this brother?
- Why did you get worried on seeing Das?

1182
01:26:21,717 --> 01:26:23,207
Who are you really?

1183
01:26:23,385 --> 01:26:24,613
He's...
- Stop!

1184
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:30,148
Don't tell me stories, tell me,
who you really are?

1185
01:26:30,526 --> 01:26:34,587
l'll tell you the truth, listen calmly.
- Tell me.

1186
01:26:35,564 --> 01:26:38,624
Mahendra Naidu is my paternal uncle.

1187
01:26:49,745 --> 01:26:53,772
After that...
- Stop! l'll tell the rest.

1188
01:26:54,116 --> 01:26:58,553
You came to the station to leave,
your people attacked me there,

1189
01:26:58,721 --> 01:27:01,690
you saw it and saved me,

1190
01:27:03,525 --> 01:27:05,356
you're great!

1191
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,697
What would've had happened
to me if you weren't there?

1192
01:27:09,698 --> 01:27:10,687
Brother!

1193
01:27:13,268 --> 01:27:15,498
lt seems Lord Rama had
one such brother then,

1194
01:27:15,671 --> 01:27:18,231
now, only l've one such brother.
- Yes brother.- ln the form of you.

1195
01:27:18,407 --> 01:27:20,375
How easy my job would be
if everyone here is like him?

1196
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:24,034
l'll remove God' screensaver from
my computer and use your photo.

1197
01:27:24,213 --> 01:27:28,115
l don't know why, on seeing your
face l felt like saving you, brother.

1198
01:27:28,283 --> 01:27:31,548
By the way, what are you
doing here, then?

1199
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,051
Will you kill my father-in-law?

1200
01:27:33,222 --> 01:27:36,817
lf l had that idea, my entry style
would've been completely different.

1201
01:27:37,159 --> 01:27:38,285
Why did you come here then?

1202
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:41,554
l'll make them not to attack us.
- How will you do it?

1203
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,595
Do you know about this family?

1204
01:27:43,766 --> 01:27:46,234
My father-in-law murders
as easily as drinking water.

1205
01:27:46,668 --> 01:27:49,159
He goes to Durgah to offer prayers
and says his sins are washed.

1206
01:27:49,338 --> 01:27:52,671
Elder son, he beat his angel
like wife and sent her away.

1207
01:27:54,209 --> 01:27:58,509
Not only he has a concubine,
irony her name is Sheelavathi,

1208
01:27:59,081 --> 01:28:01,572
elder son and second son
have drinks together always,

1209
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,242
if anyone turns against them,
they both join to kill him,

1210
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:08,514
and second liked a girl,

1211
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:10,922
her father and my father-in-law
are friends,

1212
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:14,161
they were playing chess in the marriage
and had a problem in the game,

1213
01:28:14,329 --> 01:28:15,626
Check!
- No!

1214
01:28:15,798 --> 01:28:17,789
Why are you playing cheating game?

1215
01:28:18,133 --> 01:28:19,862
Why did you spoil the board, buffalo?

1216
01:28:20,202 --> 01:28:22,670
Second son beat his father-in-law
for calling names.

1217
01:28:22,838 --> 01:28:24,430
How dare you scold my father!

1218
01:28:25,207 --> 01:28:26,731
With that marriage stopped.

1219
01:28:26,909 --> 01:28:28,604
What next?
His story started all over again.

1220
01:28:28,777 --> 01:28:30,768
lf these two are like this,
how can the third son be normal?

1221
01:28:31,113 --> 01:28:34,276
Forget about him.
You said about some Durgah!

1222
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:36,917
My father-in-law believes Mastan Baba.

1223
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,917
Got any idea?

1224
01:28:40,255 --> 01:28:42,382
Your infant son is having fever.

1225
01:28:45,902 --> 01:28:47,893
Hail Mastan Baba!

1226
01:28:48,071 --> 01:28:50,062
Atleast one man in
that family must die.

1227
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,868
Hail Mastan Baba!

1228
01:28:53,043 --> 01:28:54,840
Peer Sahib, come in.

1229
01:28:55,245 --> 01:28:57,645
How are you Seshadri?
- l'm fine.

1230
01:28:58,181 --> 01:28:59,808
My grandson is having fever.

1231
01:28:59,983 --> 01:29:01,575
My son-in-law wants you to
ward off evil eye cast on him,

1232
01:29:01,751 --> 01:29:02,979
so l called you here.

1233
01:29:03,153 --> 01:29:06,919
Where's the child?
- lt's with him only. Come.

1234
01:29:15,832 --> 01:29:19,290
Go out...go out...move away...

1235
01:29:19,636 --> 01:29:20,933
Satan! Go out!

1236
01:29:21,605 --> 01:29:22,970
Go out Satan!

1237
01:29:23,273 --> 01:29:25,264
Satan! Go out!

1238
01:29:26,943 --> 01:29:28,103
Satan! Go out!

1239
01:29:28,345 --> 01:29:29,209
Move away!

1240
01:29:34,017 --> 01:29:35,985
Here's the Satan!

1241
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:42,788
Come out....come out...
Come out...

1242
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,121
Who are you?
How dare you call me a Satan!

1243
01:29:46,296 --> 01:29:49,129
l'm calling you, come out....
- You bloody!

1244
01:29:49,299 --> 01:29:51,961
Lady Satan has hit me.

1245
01:29:53,236 --> 01:29:56,967
Go out Satan! Go!

1246
01:29:57,641 --> 01:29:58,972
Go out!

1247
01:30:11,254 --> 01:30:12,812
Will you lie if l pay?

1248
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:14,388
What did you say?
- What did l say?

1249
01:30:15,258 --> 01:30:17,089
l'll pay Rs.5000, will you lie?

1250
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,160
What did you say?
- What did l say?

1251
01:30:20,363 --> 01:30:23,924
l'll pay Rs.500, will you lie?
- You said Rs.5000 earlier.

1252
01:30:24,134 --> 01:30:27,433
l said that to test if you fall
for money, you do fall for money,

1253
01:30:27,771 --> 01:30:29,170
now you're bargaining.

1254
01:30:29,339 --> 01:30:32,172
You're a magician.
- l know it.

1255
01:30:35,278 --> 01:30:36,006
Hold this!

1256
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,477
There's a Satan in this house.

1257
01:30:38,848 --> 01:30:41,817
l sent it out from the door, but it
entered again from the window,

1258
01:30:41,985 --> 01:30:44,749
a bad thing should've happened
here but it wasn't conducted,

1259
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:49,017
am l right?- Yes Sahib, following traditions
my sister should've become a widow,

1260
01:30:49,192 --> 01:30:49,920
but we haven't yet done it.

1261
01:30:50,093 --> 01:30:51,390
That's why Satan is refusing to go.

1262
01:30:51,728 --> 01:30:54,196
lsn't there any way to send it out?
- There is a way.

1263
01:30:55,398 --> 01:30:56,365
Even if you sneeze, there is.

1264
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,964
A good function must happen
here by full moon day,

1265
01:30:59,135 --> 01:31:01,228
till then no bad thing
must happen here.

1266
01:31:01,404 --> 01:31:03,372
Nobody in the house must
hold a weapon.

1267
01:31:03,707 --> 01:31:05,231
Nobody's hand must get wet with blood.

1268
01:31:05,408 --> 01:31:06,705
Mustn't kill anyone.

1269
01:31:06,876 --> 01:31:09,242
Full moon day is 1o days away,
we can't wait till then.

1270
01:31:09,412 --> 01:31:12,870
We've a plan to wipe out
entire Mahendra's family .

1271
01:31:13,049 --> 01:31:16,712
lf you've a plan, wipe it and sleep on it.

1272
01:31:16,886 --> 01:31:18,217
lmpossible.

1273
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:20,478
Must make it possible.
- Why?

1274
01:31:20,824 --> 01:31:22,052
For the infant's health you must do it.

1275
01:31:22,225 --> 01:31:24,193
lmpossible.
- Then l'm going away.

1276
01:31:24,361 --> 01:31:25,760
You wait.
- Me or him?

1277
01:31:25,929 --> 01:31:29,524
Not you Sahib!
l'll do anything for my grandson.

1278
01:31:29,866 --> 01:31:31,265
l'll arrange for his cradling
ceremony in 10 days.

1279
01:31:31,434 --> 01:31:35,302
Forget about guns, sickles,
bombs for next 10 days.

1280
01:31:35,472 --> 01:31:40,068
Be peaceful without any fights.
- Okay, now l'm leaving happily.

1281
01:31:40,243 --> 01:31:42,905
Yours is in mine hands.
- Hold it and come after me.

1282
01:31:44,347 --> 01:31:46,907
Can live peacefully for 10 days.

1283
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:48,516
Who is there?
- Sir.

1284
01:31:48,852 --> 01:31:50,752
Call Mrithyunjaya Naidu
wherever he may be.

1285
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:54,481
He must be here by morning. Go.

1286
01:31:54,824 --> 01:31:57,190
lf becomes here, you're finished.

1287
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,089
Let him come, l'll take care.

1288
01:31:59,996 --> 01:32:01,793
Sir, l'm Rangaiah,
father wants you at home.

1289
01:32:01,965 --> 01:32:04,900
l made a vow to come home only
after killing one in that family.

1290
01:32:05,068 --> 01:32:07,536
Peer Sahib has told us not to
do any bad thing for 10 days.

1291
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:11,439
My father believes blindly
whatever anyone says.

1292
01:32:11,775 --> 01:32:12,867
He wants you at home
before morning.

1293
01:32:13,043 --> 01:32:17,207
Then, l'll go tonight and
kill someone in that family.

1294
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:20,281
Don't tell about this to my father.

1295
01:32:21,451 --> 01:32:22,383
Come on boys.

1296
01:32:23,353 --> 01:32:24,945
l must go to my village immediately.

1297
01:32:33,463 --> 01:32:37,797
Alert! Enemy has entered village alone.
- Come on!

1298
01:32:41,504 --> 01:32:42,801
Come!

1299
01:32:43,006 --> 01:32:44,303
Go that side.

1300
01:32:52,382 --> 01:32:54,543
lf l leave him, he'll kill my people,

1301
01:32:54,884 --> 01:32:57,876
if my people get him,
they will kill him.

1302
01:33:01,524 --> 01:33:03,822
You're the only one who
has soft corner for me,

1303
01:33:03,993 --> 01:33:06,257
that's why l called you through Giri,

1304
01:33:06,429 --> 01:33:09,592
he must be here for sometime
for our family's safety.- Okay.

1305
01:33:09,933 --> 01:33:10,991
Be careful.
- Okay sir.

1306
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:13,192
Meet Girija before going.
- l'll meet later, l've work.

1307
01:33:13,369 --> 01:33:15,337
She's crying for you.

1308
01:33:30,186 --> 01:33:34,020
That is....my clothes are here,
l came to pick it...

1309
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,654
You've come anyway, stay here.

1310
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:41,292
Your aunt is very sad.

1311
01:33:41,865 --> 01:33:43,526
Stay but without doing any mischief.

1312
01:33:49,472 --> 01:33:51,269
What are you looking at?
Go and sleep peacefully.

1313
01:33:51,441 --> 01:33:54,376
Now that you're here,
how can we be peaceful anymore?

1314
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:58,210
He's shameless, we necked
him out, but he's back here.

1315
01:33:59,182 --> 01:34:02,208
Though we are abusing him
on face, look at his smile.

1316
01:34:08,892 --> 01:34:11,690
Where are you coming?
Go to sleep. Come.

1317
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,232
Come.

1318
01:34:27,577 --> 01:34:29,340
Who are you searching?

1319
01:34:31,247 --> 01:34:32,407
Blanket.

1320
01:34:34,984 --> 01:34:36,542
Have you started it all over again?

1321
01:34:55,371 --> 01:34:56,702
What's this kiss?

1322
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,736
l'll get down slowly,
l must get used to it.

1323
01:35:01,644 --> 01:35:05,045
You smiled, l'll go now.
- Where to?

1324
01:35:05,215 --> 01:35:07,149
l must go, l've urgent work.

1325
01:35:07,317 --> 01:35:09,012
Why did you come if you'd to leave?

1326
01:35:09,185 --> 01:35:10,743
To see you smile.

1327
01:35:11,688 --> 01:35:12,950
Okay, go.

1328
01:35:13,122 --> 01:35:17,354
But do something before you go
which l can never forget.

1329
01:35:47,722 --> 01:35:51,783
Girija! I always think of you only...

1330
01:35:52,526 --> 01:35:56,690
Girija! y ou're my breathe...

1331
01:35:57,231 --> 01:36:01,691
Girija! y ou're my desire...

1332
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:06,531
I gave my heart to you...

1333
01:36:11,145 --> 01:36:12,908
I'm means you...

y ou're my dream always...

1340
01:37:27,855 --> 01:37:32,292
My eyes see only you...

1341
01:37:32,626 --> 01:37:37,393
I hear your voice only
in the wind...

1342
01:37:37,732 --> 01:37:42,135
Whatever I say, you're on the
tip of my lip always...

1343
01:37:42,303 --> 01:37:47,070
I'm living in your love world...

1344
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:51,837
y ou're my dream girl,
the girl I love deeply...

1345
01:37:52,012 --> 01:37:56,210
y ou're taking over my every cell...

1346
01:37:56,383 --> 01:38:01,013
Shall I wake up every morning
in the warmth of your arms?

1347
01:38:01,188 --> 01:38:05,989
May I live all my life in the
cool moonlight of your love?

1348
01:38:34,188 --> 01:38:38,750
Though it was written on the wall,
I saw it today only...

1349
01:38:38,926 --> 01:38:43,386
Whether you agree or not,
I was born for you only...

1350
01:38:43,731 --> 01:38:48,259
Trust me I'm not myself anymore...

1351
01:38:48,435 --> 01:38:53,202
I'll be with you in all my births...

1352
01:38:53,374 --> 01:38:57,970
Am I not your heart, soul,
love and everything?

1353
01:38:58,145 --> 01:39:02,445
Shall I become a part of your life?

1354
01:39:02,783 --> 01:39:07,243
I accepted this beauty with
both hands as my luck...

1355
01:39:07,421 --> 01:39:12,051
May I worship your love
as gift in my heart...

1356
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,907
Hey stop!
- Brother!

1357
01:39:49,082 --> 01:39:50,982
Where were you yesterday?
- l went out, brother.

1358
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:53,050
Why did you go out
when you fear for life?

1359
01:39:53,219 --> 01:39:54,709
Brother...
- Why did you come back again?

1360
01:39:54,888 --> 01:39:56,913
No, l'll tell you....
- Why don't you answer me?

1361
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:58,352
Why are you coming on me?

1362
01:39:58,691 --> 01:40:01,216
Uncle sent me out.
- ls it true, uncle?

1363
01:40:01,561 --> 01:40:03,222
When did l sent you out?

1364
01:40:03,563 --> 01:40:05,724
Why are you lying now uncle?
Didn't you send me out?

1365
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:07,230
Why should l lie to them?

1366
01:40:07,567 --> 01:40:11,094
My brother-in-law is crook.
His sons are worse crooks than him.

1367
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:12,602
Promise, uncle sent me out.

1368
01:40:12,772 --> 01:40:13,932
Uncle, tell them or else
l'll show it to them.

1369
01:40:14,107 --> 01:40:15,870
Stop...stop...
l had only sent him out.

1370
01:40:16,042 --> 01:40:18,306
l sent him to get medicines
for my aches.

1371
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:23,082
Why did you lie then?
- My pain is in a place l can't tell openly.

1372
01:40:29,756 --> 01:40:30,745
You?

1373
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:32,585
Looks like my brothers-in-law
may kill you.

1374
01:40:32,759 --> 01:40:34,124
Please go away from here, brother.

1375
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:37,024
They have plenty of free time
so they are concentrating on me.

1376
01:40:37,196 --> 01:40:38,322
Cradling ceremony is
just 4 days away,

1377
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:39,927
they'll be back to their
old ways immediately.

1378
01:40:40,099 --> 01:40:42,932
l'll shift their focus to keep
them off weapons for the life.

1379
01:40:43,102 --> 01:40:44,364
How will you do it?

1380
01:40:44,704 --> 01:40:47,104
l'll make these bachelors
into family men,

1381
01:40:47,273 --> 01:40:50,709
l'll get them taste the family life.
- How will you do it?

1382
01:40:50,877 --> 01:40:53,038
l'll follow the British rule.

1383
01:40:53,212 --> 01:40:58,115
First l'll divide them, then rule them.
- l'll watch all this.

1384
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:03,412
Who is it?

1385
01:41:08,127 --> 01:41:10,027
Check the number, its fancy number.

1386
01:41:10,663 --> 01:41:14,292
You promise to come,
won't you come till l'm finished?

1387
01:41:14,667 --> 01:41:16,430
Look next to you.

1388
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:18,298
Brother!

1389
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,170
Your fingerprints will fall on me.

1390
01:41:21,341 --> 01:41:22,933
Why didn't you come with 10 men?

1391
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:27,409
Only pigs come in groups,
Parabrahmam will come solo.

1392
01:41:27,747 --> 01:41:28,736
Where is the fool you told me about?

1393
01:41:29,248 --> 01:41:31,739
Look there! Till now ate my brain,
now he's eating an apple.

1394
01:41:31,918 --> 01:41:34,648
Did you call me unable
to kick out this kid?

1395
01:41:34,821 --> 01:41:36,948
You don't know about him, brother,
he can sell sand in desert.

1396
01:41:37,123 --> 01:41:40,650
l can sell ice in Himalayas.
- He'll sell us together.- Shut up.

1397
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,087
How much you've in your pockets?
- Rs.500.

1398
01:41:43,262 --> 01:41:44,422
How much is this?

1399
01:41:45,398 --> 01:41:47,730
Rs.750?
- What's the difference? Rs.250.

1400
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,391
lf you're a fool, l'm an idiot.

1401
01:41:50,903 --> 01:41:52,837
Uncle, just now arriving?

1402
01:41:53,706 --> 01:41:56,174
Uncle!
- Coming.

1403
01:42:01,848 --> 01:42:04,874
Hey kid! lt seems you're
doing too much here.

1404
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:07,110
Who are you getting irritated
without any introduction?

1405
01:42:07,286 --> 01:42:08,844
My elder brother,
he has come Ananthapur.

1406
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:12,355
ls that why he's so hot?

1407
01:42:13,092 --> 01:42:17,688
No jokes with me, l'll change lives.

1408
01:42:17,864 --> 01:42:20,196
Don't get angry, elder uncle.
- He's calling me uncle.

1409
01:42:20,366 --> 01:42:22,231
He's like that, he develops relationships
but does what he wants to.

1410
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:24,734
You do something.
- Why are you irritating uncle?

1411
01:42:24,904 --> 01:42:25,700
You come uncle,
let's have a drink.

1412
01:42:25,872 --> 01:42:27,737
No...no...there will be
some scheme in it.

1413
01:42:27,907 --> 01:42:31,365
What scheme will be there in whisky?
You're too much uncle.

1414
01:42:31,844 --> 01:42:34,210
Where's the whisky?
- There...

1415
01:42:36,816 --> 01:42:40,343
He thinks l'm also a fool like you.

1416
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,215
What's this uncle?
- Shut up!

1417
01:42:42,822 --> 01:42:44,289
Do you think l don't know
about that bottle?

1418
01:42:44,457 --> 01:42:47,756
Don't l know elder one will beat
if anyone touches it?

1419
01:42:47,927 --> 01:42:50,521
You sit first, let's talk later.
- l'll sit.

1420
01:42:52,198 --> 01:42:56,498
l know touching that bottle or sitting
in that chair will invite trouble.

1421
01:42:56,836 --> 01:42:59,236
Not that chair, this chair, uncle.

1422
01:42:59,839 --> 01:43:02,740
Why are you sitting
in this chair, uncle?

1423
01:43:05,244 --> 01:43:08,338
No nephew...actually...

1424
01:43:23,863 --> 01:43:26,263
Brother, it wasn't uncle's mistake.

1425
01:43:26,499 --> 01:43:27,431
True?

1426
01:43:27,767 --> 01:43:29,132
l thought otherwise.

1427
01:43:29,302 --> 01:43:32,271
Uncle sat without knowing
in brother's chair,

1428
01:43:32,438 --> 01:43:34,099
second brother slapped uncle,

1429
01:43:34,273 --> 01:43:37,071
uncle fell on the bottle
and the bottle fell down.

1430
01:43:37,243 --> 01:43:40,838
Hey Shailendra! What will happen
if anyone sits in that chair?

1431
01:43:41,013 --> 01:43:43,880
Lost a bottle and uncle got slapped.

1432
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:45,950
Bloody chair!

1433
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:48,951
You said there's no scheme.

1434
01:43:49,122 --> 01:43:52,148
You wait...said there's no scheme.

1435
01:43:52,325 --> 01:43:53,587
This is not a scheme,
it's a scam, uncle.

1436
01:43:53,926 --> 01:43:54,858
What's the difference between the two?

1437
01:43:55,027 --> 01:43:57,461
lf l plan it's scheme,
if you get trapped, it's scam.

1438
01:43:58,865 --> 01:44:00,025
l think must increase the dose.

1439
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:02,565
You came making great statements.
- Come closer.- What?

1440
01:44:02,902 --> 01:44:04,062
He slapped me!

1441
01:44:10,009 --> 01:44:15,311
He's bad, moreover using a scent too.
That's why we get bad smell.

1442
01:44:15,548 --> 01:44:19,109
Where's he going with scent
and gaudy outfits?

1443
01:44:19,285 --> 01:44:21,981
Where else? To his concubine.

1444
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:25,522
We must turn his attention from her
and bring his wife home.

1445
01:44:25,858 --> 01:44:28,156
How to bring her here?
- Somehow we must do it.

1446
01:44:28,327 --> 01:44:29,316
You mean?

1447
01:44:30,096 --> 01:44:34,829
Someone go to the ayurvedic doctor
and get medicine.

1448
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:35,626
l'll bring, sir.

1449
01:44:35,968 --> 01:44:38,198
Do you know who is he
and where will he be?

1450
01:44:38,371 --> 01:44:40,635
l'll know it sir.
- Okay, go.

1451
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:44,838
What for sir?
- For something....for my knee pain.

1452
01:44:45,011 --> 01:44:49,607
Don't announce there it's
for Seshadri's knee pain. Go.

1453
01:44:49,949 --> 01:44:55,353
lf doctor is not there,
get it from his wife.- Okay sir.

1454
01:45:00,993 --> 01:45:02,358
Who are you?

1455
01:45:03,896 --> 01:45:06,228
Sir sent me.
- Why?

1456
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:10,028
To send you away
from here or kill you.

1457
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:14,003
l don't believe it, he knows
everything happening here.

1458
01:45:14,173 --> 01:45:15,663
Then listen it yourself.

1459
01:45:25,418 --> 01:45:29,548
Hello sir. - What?
- ls the job done?- No sir.- Why?

1460
01:45:29,889 --> 01:45:32,881
He has slept after having drinks,
she's here.

1461
01:45:33,059 --> 01:45:33,991
She's not listening to me.

1462
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,559
She's scolding and
wants me to go out.

1463
01:45:35,895 --> 01:45:37,954
Even after taking my name?
- Yes sir.

1464
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:40,894
Hit her head with a boulder and
throw her body in the lake.

1465
01:45:41,067 --> 01:45:42,534
l'll take care of the consequences.

1466
01:45:42,702 --> 01:45:46,263
l'm thinking about doing
something bad in vow period.

1467
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:49,237
But still you don't worry,
l'll think of something.

1468
01:45:49,408 --> 01:45:50,500
Okay sir.

1469
01:45:53,512 --> 01:45:57,073
Boy, leave me,
l'll leave immediately.

1470
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:09,923
Take it!

1471
01:46:13,099 --> 01:46:14,691
She's faster than me.

1472
01:46:15,034 --> 01:46:17,525
Play.
- l'm dropping.

1473
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:32,210
Bloody!

1474
01:46:32,618 --> 01:46:34,279
Why are you beating, brother?

1475
01:46:35,521 --> 01:46:39,287
You lost rings with someone
and taking that anger on us.

1476
01:46:41,994 --> 01:46:45,725
How dare you slap me?
- Brother, please stop fighting...

1477
01:46:46,065 --> 01:46:52,004
Please don't fight, brother.

1478
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:55,038
Why are you watching
their fight like a movie?

1479
01:46:55,207 --> 01:46:56,299
Don't you've sense?

1480
01:46:56,976 --> 01:46:58,705
You've grown like bulls,
why are you fighting?

1481
01:46:59,045 --> 01:47:00,535
Do you've any sense?
Have got any common sense?

1482
01:47:00,713 --> 01:47:02,374
What's this fighting among yourselves?

1483
01:47:07,153 --> 01:47:10,316
l'm here only,
if you need, call me.

1484
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:13,053
This is also your scheme, right?

1485
01:47:13,225 --> 01:47:15,352
This is not a scheme,
just warm up.

1486
01:47:15,528 --> 01:47:16,756
ls there more?

1487
01:47:18,097 --> 01:47:20,327
Brother, you wouldn't mind, will you?

1488
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:25,000
Brothers are fighting among themselves,

1489
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:28,265
son-in-law is crying in fear of
something happening to him.

1490
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:32,168
Son-in-law!

1491
01:47:36,015 --> 01:47:38,779
You've grown so big,
still fighting like kids?

1492
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:40,517
Not worried about son-in-law in home,

1493
01:47:40,686 --> 01:47:42,677
not worried about something
happenning to the child.

1494
01:47:43,022 --> 01:47:44,387
Always worried about son-in-law.

1495
01:47:44,557 --> 01:47:45,785
ls he more to you than us?

1496
01:47:46,092 --> 01:47:49,186
lndeed he's more to me
than you, shut up.

1497
01:47:55,568 --> 01:47:58,799
Compared to you Shakuni
is very innocent.

1498
01:47:59,138 --> 01:48:01,197
Don't praise me, l fell shy, uncle.

1499
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:11,577
Hold this.
- Okay madam.

1500
01:48:11,751 --> 01:48:15,653
Will you eat or
shall l break your head?

1501
01:48:16,222 --> 01:48:20,124
Eat man, she'll really do it.
- Will you eat or not?

1502
01:48:21,427 --> 01:48:22,553
l'll eat.

1503
01:48:25,164 --> 01:48:26,722
Don't play with me.

1504
01:48:27,566 --> 01:48:28,555
That's it.
- Eat.

1505
01:48:30,302 --> 01:48:32,065
lf you don't eat, you'll die with hunger.

1506
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:36,071
Open your mouth.

1507
01:48:36,675 --> 01:48:39,337
Brother, l'll make a drink for you.

1508
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,807
Don't worry brother.
- l'm not worried. l'm a tiger.

1509
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:48,609
Sir too said this, my elder son is tiger.

1510
01:48:48,788 --> 01:48:49,755
Trust me,

1511
01:48:50,089 --> 01:48:53,081
when l said bull or buffalo,
second son rebelled against me,

1512
01:48:53,259 --> 01:48:54,658
elder son never protested,

1513
01:48:54,827 --> 01:48:57,489
that's why l love him, he said this.

1514
01:49:00,699 --> 01:49:01,757
When you love him so much,

1515
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:04,569
why do you always dote
on daughter's child,

1516
01:49:04,737 --> 01:49:07,638
l bravely asked him if brother's
children weren't his grandchildren?

1517
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:08,831
What did he say?

1518
01:49:09,341 --> 01:49:12,174
My leg is paining,
can l sit on chair, brother?

1519
01:49:12,344 --> 01:49:14,505
Okay sit.
- Okay.

1520
01:49:15,548 --> 01:49:17,880
Elder son sent away
his wife and kids,

1521
01:49:18,217 --> 01:49:20,777
l can show affection only
if they are here, he said like this.

1522
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,111
There's truth in what he said,
right brother?

1523
01:49:24,356 --> 01:49:27,917
lf wife and kids are here,
sir will respect you, brother.

1524
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:32,222
You're right.

1525
01:49:32,398 --> 01:49:35,925
You stand on it,
l'll manage the rest of it.

1526
01:49:40,773 --> 01:49:45,142
We must tell these guys
that Ajay is a cheat.

1527
01:49:45,311 --> 01:49:47,142
This is the way to send him out.

1528
01:49:47,746 --> 01:49:49,907
Elder one!

1529
01:49:50,249 --> 01:49:54,515
Hey Sheelavathi!
How dare you steal my rings.

1530
01:49:54,687 --> 01:49:57,212
You must get slapped!

1531
01:50:00,259 --> 01:50:03,820
l think he's in different mood,
let's go.

1532
01:50:05,297 --> 01:50:07,322
He slapped you and
you slapped me.

1533
01:50:10,769 --> 01:50:13,966
Get up, freshen up,
have breakfast and sleep again.

1534
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:15,500
Father!

1535
01:50:21,747 --> 01:50:25,683
Brother! Your brain is
double extra large.

1536
01:50:26,986 --> 01:50:28,419
Won't you shake hands
with me, uncle?

1537
01:50:28,587 --> 01:50:30,179
No...no...there will be
some scheme in it.

1538
01:50:30,356 --> 01:50:32,916
What scheme?
What will be there in a shake hand?

1539
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:34,692
Always suspecting!

1540
01:50:36,729 --> 01:50:38,526
Sister-in-law, here's the ring.

1541
01:50:45,604 --> 01:50:47,196
l told you there will be some scheme,
you didn't believe me.

1542
01:50:47,373 --> 01:50:50,865
Go and give it to brother,
tell me if he doesn't fall for this.

1543
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:10,554
Strangers only take,
only near ones give.

1544
01:51:16,302 --> 01:51:20,398
Brother, your brain is not
double extra large, it's triple.

1545
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:22,729
Won't you shake hands
with me, uncle?

1546
01:51:22,908 --> 01:51:24,432
No way, isn't there any end
to your schemes?

1547
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:25,907
You keep quiet.

1548
01:51:26,245 --> 01:51:30,409
Come here...isn't there any
end to your schemes?

1549
01:51:30,749 --> 01:51:32,614
With your grace elder one
is happy and settled,

1550
01:51:32,785 --> 01:51:35,253
if second one gets married,
he'll live with your grace.

1551
01:51:35,421 --> 01:51:36,854
Yes...
- How is it possible?

1552
01:51:38,357 --> 01:51:40,052
You're in for bigger trouble.

1553
01:51:41,493 --> 01:51:42,323
You guessed it right, uncle.

1554
01:51:44,195 --> 01:51:46,095
Ajay is no ordinary guy,

1555
01:51:46,264 --> 01:51:48,095
he'll steal ring without
the finger knowing it.

1556
01:51:48,266 --> 01:51:50,234
No use in getting drunk
and sleeping like log.

1557
01:51:50,568 --> 01:51:52,263
Use your brain.

1558
01:51:55,072 --> 01:51:57,131
Brother, l'll make your drink.

1559
01:52:02,179 --> 01:52:04,977
No water please.
- Liver will get damaged, brother.

1560
01:52:09,987 --> 01:52:12,114
Elder brother hit you in public,

1561
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:13,752
it's not paining me,

1562
01:52:13,925 --> 01:52:17,588
sir chided you in public,
it's not paining me,

1563
01:52:17,762 --> 01:52:23,667
but you gave up your love for sir,
that's paining me, brother.

1564
01:52:24,001 --> 01:52:25,127
Get up.

1565
01:52:28,572 --> 01:52:31,097
Why brother?
- Sit in the chair.

1566
01:52:37,281 --> 01:52:40,114
There are many who claim
to be great here.

1567
01:52:40,284 --> 01:52:43,276
You gave up your love for your father,
you're really great, brother.

1568
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:46,613
They don't realise this,
they never see it.

1569
01:52:46,791 --> 01:52:48,986
lf you want them to realise it,
you must say yes to whatever l say.

1570
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,993
What is it?
- You must marry the same girl.

1571
01:52:52,163 --> 01:52:53,892
Only then they will come to know.

1572
01:52:54,065 --> 01:52:56,693
lf there's any problem,
you're very strong.

1573
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:03,968
lmpossible. l slapped both she
and her father.

1574
01:53:04,976 --> 01:53:07,035
l'll get their acceptance, brother.
- How will you do it?

1575
01:53:07,211 --> 01:53:10,305
You'll make him a fool, that's all.
- Uncle, you keep quiet.

1576
01:53:10,648 --> 01:53:13,913
Brother, you write a love letter to her.

1577
01:53:14,085 --> 01:53:17,953
But you must write it
with your blood.

1578
01:53:18,789 --> 01:53:21,053
Super idea, brother.
Uncle!

1579
01:53:26,764 --> 01:53:33,294
With love to my dear Shailaja...

1580
01:53:38,609 --> 01:53:39,735
Fantastic brother!

1581
01:53:40,011 --> 01:53:42,002
There must be strong words to end it.

1582
01:53:42,179 --> 01:53:44,010
Write, it's written in your blood.

1583
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:46,911
Uncle!
- Great uncle!

1584
01:53:48,285 --> 01:53:53,917
This love letter is written
with my blood.

1585
01:53:54,692 --> 01:53:56,922
Brother, deliver it to
your sister-in-law.

1586
01:53:57,094 --> 01:54:01,997
Sure brother.
Uncle donated blood for your love.

1587
01:54:02,166 --> 01:54:03,292
Won't you thank him?

1588
01:54:03,634 --> 01:54:04,931
Thanks uncle.

1589
01:54:08,072 --> 01:54:10,768
What happened, brother?

1590
01:54:11,342 --> 01:54:16,006
l beg you,
l'll leave this place now.

1591
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:18,114
l can't handle him anymore.

1592
01:54:24,989 --> 01:54:27,389
This love letter is written
with my blood.

1593
01:54:29,627 --> 01:54:31,117
l agree.

1594
01:54:31,662 --> 01:54:33,220
But father must agree, right?

1595
01:54:33,397 --> 01:54:35,126
l'll get his approval, you don't worry.

1596
01:54:35,299 --> 01:54:37,164
How will you do it?
He slapped my father.

1597
01:54:37,334 --> 01:54:38,961
He'll do it, he has great many
schemes under his belt.

1598
01:54:39,136 --> 01:54:40,433
He's no ordinary man.

1599
01:54:48,245 --> 01:54:51,339
Greetings sir. We are calling from
Seshadri Naidu's residence,

1600
01:54:51,682 --> 01:54:53,809

cradling ceremony.

1601
01:54:53,984 --> 01:54:55,178
Tell them l'll not come.

1602
01:54:55,352 --> 01:54:57,650
Then you please be on
the line for a minute.

1603
01:54:57,822 --> 01:54:58,914
He'll talk to you directly.

1604
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:00,022
Please don't hang up the phone.

1605
01:55:00,191 --> 01:55:01,920
How will you make him speak?

1606
01:55:03,761 --> 01:55:08,061
Sir, your last son Mrithyunjaya is
refusing to come to the function,

1607
01:55:08,232 --> 01:55:10,029
you talk to him once...
- Give it to me.

1608
01:55:11,202 --> 01:55:14,763
What man? lt seems you
refused to come to the function.

1609
01:55:14,939 --> 01:55:18,170
How can you stay away
from a function in our home?

1610
01:55:20,377 --> 01:55:25,178
Though l've so many,
you know l love you the most.

1611
01:55:26,016 --> 01:55:30,009
Forget about the function,
l'm eager to see you.

1612
01:55:30,788 --> 01:55:33,757
Come once.
- Okay.

1613
01:55:37,795 --> 01:55:39,490
Are you coming sir?
- l'm coming.

1614
01:55:40,764 --> 01:55:43,232
He's coming.
Tomorrow is the function.

1615
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,868
My plan has reached the climax.

1616
01:55:46,837 --> 01:55:49,032
My last days are numbered.

1617
01:55:49,306 --> 01:55:53,037
What if l elope with Jayamma forever?

1618
01:56:08,092 --> 01:56:08,888
Greetings...

1619
01:56:14,231 --> 01:56:16,324
Sir, look there!
- Look!

1620
01:56:18,736 --> 01:56:19,532
There!

1621
01:56:24,208 --> 01:56:25,266
There!

1622
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,447
l'm very happy.
l feel, is it really my home?

1623
01:56:33,784 --> 01:56:36,116
Sir, do you want this happiness
to continue always?

1624
01:56:36,287 --> 01:56:37,515
lt must stay like this.

1625
01:56:37,855 --> 01:56:40,756
Then l'll suggest something,
you mustn't get angry.

1626
01:56:40,925 --> 01:56:42,483
l'll not get angry, tell me.

1627
01:56:42,927 --> 01:56:45,919
Let's leave that
Mahendra Naidu's family.

1628
01:56:48,132 --> 01:56:52,068
l mean let's not spare him
but leave his family.

1629
01:56:52,236 --> 01:56:54,864
But let's finish Mahendra
and his brother.

1630
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:58,270
But innocent other family members....

1631
01:56:58,943 --> 01:57:01,571
lf we do anything,
they will not keep quiet, sir.

1632
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:05,772
Now our home is happy with
daughters-in-law and kids,

1633
01:57:05,950 --> 01:57:08,282
if anything happens
to anyone of them,

1634
01:57:08,452 --> 01:57:10,852
will this happiness be there, sir?

1635
01:57:16,894 --> 01:57:19,954
Seshadri, what the boy says is true.

1636
01:57:20,464 --> 01:57:22,056
Think over it.

1637
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:24,993
Elder son, second son!

1638
01:57:25,169 --> 01:57:29,868
l've decided not to harm any
family member of Mahendra.

1639
01:57:32,343 --> 01:57:34,334
Father-in-law, you're a great man!

1640
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:37,309
Brother! Are you really saying this?

1641
01:57:37,481 --> 01:57:39,176
Or are you possessed by any devil?

1642
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:42,342
l've not decided to spare
Mahendra Naidu,

1643
01:57:42,519 --> 01:57:44,180
his family members only.
Listen to me.

1644
01:57:44,355 --> 01:57:47,586
Don't try to teach me,
let better sense in you prevail.

1645
01:57:47,925 --> 01:57:51,383
l've been watching you all
since last 10 days,

1646
01:57:51,562 --> 01:57:53,530
everyone in home has changed,

1647
01:57:53,864 --> 01:57:56,230
forgotten about a death completely,

1648
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:00,097
elder one is after his wife,

1649
01:58:00,471 --> 01:58:03,599
second one is romancing that girl,

1650
01:58:04,174 --> 01:58:07,007
you're happy with your grandson,

1651
01:58:07,177 --> 01:58:10,476
all have forgotten about revenge
and celebrating happily.

1652
01:58:10,648 --> 01:58:11,842
Shut up.

1653
01:58:12,016 --> 01:58:14,177
l'm feeling sad for your
husband's death.

1654
01:58:14,351 --> 01:58:17,514
l haven't forgotten about the revenge.
Go inside.

1655
01:58:28,132 --> 01:58:30,430
Beau!
- 90% problem is solved.

1656
01:58:30,601 --> 01:58:32,296
Nobody will come after
our family anymore.

1657
01:58:32,469 --> 01:58:34,562
You can go back to your homes.
Tell everyone there.

1658
01:58:34,905 --> 01:58:37,396
Let anyone go anywhere,
l'll be here only.

1659
01:58:37,574 --> 01:58:39,166
Waiting for you.

1660
01:58:39,343 --> 01:58:40,207
No...

1661
01:58:40,377 --> 01:58:43,141
l'll not listen,
l'll be there wherever you are.

1662
01:58:43,856 --> 01:58:46,051
I'll always be with you only.

1663
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:10,378
Happy-go-lucky!

1664
01:59:12,919 --> 01:59:15,911
Full mass!

1665
01:59:29,202 --> 01:59:31,898
Twist dance!

1666
01:59:41,247 --> 01:59:43,841
Romance is pulling me
towards it...

1667
01:59:48,087 --> 01:59:50,783
Hot chunnis are unstoppable
with desires...

1668
01:59:50,957 --> 01:59:53,391
y ou're major, I'm major...

1669
01:59:53,726 --> 01:59:56,160
It's danger if you and me
are near each other...

1670
01:59:56,329 --> 01:59:58,991
y ou're major, I'm major...

1671
01:59:59,165 --> 02:00:02,134
Let's tie the knot and
change the future...

1672
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:45,175
Have a blast!

1673
02:00:45,344 --> 02:00:47,869
y oung man's temper is raising...

1674
02:00:48,047 --> 02:00:50,413
My pulse is racing up
in anticipation...

1675
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:53,241
Why hesitate says my x-ray vision...

1676
02:00:53,419 --> 02:00:55,944
y ou'll taste the bliss...

1677
02:00:56,122 --> 02:00:58,682
Why are you rushing for it?

1678
02:00:58,858 --> 02:01:02,021
Don't hit a sixer
when you get the chance...

1679
02:01:45,071 --> 02:01:47,437
Get jasmine flowers in advance...

1680
02:01:47,773 --> 02:01:50,173
Go for it with full throttle...

1681
02:01:50,343 --> 02:01:52,937
Let's tie knot as
Sivamani plays the drum...

1682
02:01:53,112 --> 02:01:55,410
Let's tie the knot
at the earliest...

1683
02:01:55,748 --> 02:01:58,308
Just kiss me once...

1684
02:01:58,484 --> 02:02:02,250
No boyish mischief with me...

1685
02:02:03,289 --> 02:02:05,086
I don't know anything....

1686
02:02:24,294 --> 02:02:28,230
Forgive me for coming late.
- Anyway you came, that's enough.

1687
02:02:28,899 --> 02:02:31,561
What are you doing here?

1688
02:02:34,838 --> 02:02:37,170
Do you know him?

1689
02:02:39,042 --> 02:02:41,567
Who do you think he is?
He's Mahendra Naidu's nephew.

1690
02:02:45,182 --> 02:02:46,843
Am l Mahendra Naidu's nephew?

1691
02:02:47,017 --> 02:02:50,180
He has mistaken me
for someone else.

1692
02:02:51,021 --> 02:02:56,186
He's the man who beat me
and junior boss.

1693
02:02:58,128 --> 02:02:59,857
Bloody bas...

1694
02:03:02,165 --> 02:03:03,860
Brother, listen to me.

1695
02:03:04,034 --> 02:03:07,197
Brother, your last brother is safe
with us in my village.

1696
02:03:07,537 --> 02:03:09,869
Brother.
- Got caught, brother.

1697
02:03:15,045 --> 02:03:17,536
Catch him! Don't leave him.

1698
02:03:17,714 --> 02:03:20,046
Catch him!

1699
02:03:24,588 --> 02:03:27,751
lt seems Seshadri Naidu's son
is somewhere here only.

1700
02:03:27,924 --> 02:03:29,551
Search and kill him.

1701
02:03:41,872 --> 02:03:43,305
Our people have come
to know about you.

1702
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:45,301
1 l'll take you to the outskirts of village,
escape from there.

1703
02:03:45,642 --> 02:03:46,631
Let them come, l'll take care.

1704
02:03:46,810 --> 02:03:50,007
Calm down, they are many,
if they find, you're dead.

1705
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:51,238
Come fast.

1706
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:04,588
Come this side.

1707
02:04:04,761 --> 02:04:05,921
Come fast!

1708
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:07,922
Come fast!

1709
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:11,394
Sir!

1710
02:04:13,336 --> 02:04:17,773
Uncle, stop...stop...don't beat him.

1711
02:04:17,941 --> 02:04:20,705
Kill him...
- Please listen to me.

1712
02:04:20,877 --> 02:04:31,276
Uncle no...
- Uncle no please don't kill him...

1713
02:04:32,355 --> 02:04:33,185
Move...

1714
02:04:33,356 --> 02:04:34,220
You ask him to stop.

1715
02:04:34,391 --> 02:04:35,915
You're kids, stay out of it,
go home. Go!

1716
02:04:36,092 --> 02:04:38,117
Then act like elders!

1717
02:04:39,362 --> 02:04:42,297
Ajay hid him here,
if you kill him now,

1718
02:04:42,632 --> 02:04:44,691
it'll be back to square one.

1719
02:04:44,868 --> 02:04:46,961
Brother, please listen to me.

1720
02:04:52,275 --> 02:04:53,799
Kill him!

1721
02:04:55,979 --> 02:04:58,004
l don't think we'll go alive from here.

1722
02:04:58,181 --> 02:05:00,411
l have hope, Ajay will save us.

1723
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:03,150
Shut up! How can he save us?
- You shut up!

1724
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:05,311
Who do you think has been
protecting us till now?

1725
02:05:05,655 --> 02:05:07,816
Not your brothers or
bulls they are raising.

1726
02:05:07,991 --> 02:05:09,322
lt's Ajay.

1727
02:05:19,903 --> 02:05:23,669
You're playing with our lives
in the name of revenge.

1728
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:27,401
Ajay is fighting with them
risking his life.

1729
02:06:23,733 --> 02:06:25,928
l've added fuel to the fire
with great schemes,

1730
02:06:26,102 --> 02:06:30,903
will you put off that fire and
bring peace to the feuding families.

1731
02:06:35,178 --> 02:06:40,013
Now l can see the hesitation of
Arjuna on seeing the Kaurava army.

1732
02:06:44,087 --> 02:06:50,287
You think you're the director,
no just an actor,

1733
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:52,928
we are the real directors.

1734
02:06:54,431 --> 02:06:58,231
l'll tell you a news before you die.

1735
02:06:58,401 --> 02:07:01,768
We killed Garika Naidu.

1736
02:07:12,315 --> 02:07:17,446
This constituency either goes
to Mahendra or Seshadri.

1737
02:07:17,787 --> 02:07:19,846
Shouldn't a third man
raise up the ranks?

1738
02:07:20,023 --> 02:07:22,150
Don't l desire to be an MP?

1739
02:07:22,325 --> 02:07:24,020
Don't l feel like making money?

1740
02:07:24,194 --> 02:07:28,460
That's why l added fuel to the fire.

1741
02:07:29,232 --> 02:07:35,364
You'll die here and
Mrithyunjaya will die there.

1742
02:07:35,538 --> 02:07:37,802
lt will be back to square one.

1743
02:07:45,081 --> 02:07:46,981
l didn't stop losing out.

1744
02:07:47,817 --> 02:07:50,308
l kept quiet to know your intentions.

1745
02:08:09,139 --> 02:08:13,166
You say we...
who else is with you? Tell me.

1746
02:08:13,943 --> 02:08:16,275
Won't you?
- l'll tell.

1747
02:08:16,446 --> 02:08:18,175
Purushottam Naidu!

1748
02:08:19,449 --> 02:08:22,350
He promised to make me an MP
and run the show from behind.

1749
02:08:22,519 --> 02:08:25,852
He told me about you staying
in Seshadri's house.

1750
02:08:26,022 --> 02:08:27,512
He made me to open this with them.

1751
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:37,930
What happened?

1752
02:08:38,101 --> 02:08:41,036
l don't know,
l got stuck between you both.

1753
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:58,612
Sir, he's the real culprit.

1754
02:09:07,564 --> 02:09:09,054
Today you are dead.

1755
02:09:09,232 --> 02:09:11,564
Sir, you're an elder person,
listen to me.

1756
02:09:11,901 --> 02:09:15,234
What are you waiting for?
Kill him.

1757
02:09:22,512 --> 02:09:27,415
Come on! Had l feared death,
l wouldn't have entered this place!

1758
02:09:27,584 --> 02:09:30,246
Come on...bloody!

1759
02:09:31,254 --> 02:09:32,243
Stop!

1760
02:09:45,935 --> 02:09:48,426
Seshadri, here's your son.

1761
02:09:49,205 --> 02:09:51,105
lf you believe we had killed
your brother-in-law,

1762
02:09:51,274 --> 02:09:53,367
we are ready to face
any punishment.

1763
02:09:56,012 --> 02:10:00,005
Uncle, Garika Naidu wasn't
killed by our men,

1764
02:10:09,025 --> 02:10:11,118
He killed him!

1765
02:10:18,134 --> 02:10:20,295
Catch him, brother.

1766
02:10:22,338 --> 02:10:25,136
Shailendra, stop!
Why are you killing him?

1767
02:10:25,308 --> 02:10:28,300
Hand him over to your aunt.

1768
02:10:40,623 --> 02:10:41,988
Come son, let's go home.

1769
02:10:42,158 --> 02:10:44,649
Uncle, one minute.

1770
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:55,328
l know grandpa,
you're behind all this.

1771
02:10:56,272 --> 02:10:59,173
lf l tell your name,
they will kill you in minutes.

1772
02:11:00,043 --> 02:11:01,601
l don't want that to happen.

1773
02:11:02,178 --> 02:11:08,606
You must live rest of your life
with a regret that a boy spared it,.

1774
02:11:10,019 --> 02:11:11,509
l want that only.

1775
02:11:12,288 --> 02:11:16,816
Retire from life also along
with active politics.

1776
02:11:17,794 --> 02:11:22,197
lf not l'll kill you, grandpa.
l'll do it.

1777
02:11:27,403 --> 02:11:28,529
Bye Guru.

1778
02:11:48,625 --> 02:11:50,149
We've become kinsmen.

1779
02:11:50,326 --> 02:11:51,657
Greetings MP!

1780
02:11:52,061 --> 02:11:54,859
Greetings.
- MP! ls it nice to hear?

1781
02:11:58,368 --> 02:12:00,859
That is Ajay's victory story.

1782
02:12:01,537 --> 02:12:04,233
When he could so much,
why did he do like that with Gita?

1783
02:12:04,407 --> 02:12:08,070
Okay, issue has come to this point,
so l'll tell you the truth,

1784
02:12:08,244 --> 02:12:13,739
Gita called him to the room and
expressed love and proposed to elope.

1785
02:12:14,117 --> 02:12:15,243
Why don't you say something?

1786
02:12:15,418 --> 02:12:17,409
Silly girl! He would've lied to you.

1787
02:12:17,587 --> 02:12:19,418
He asked me to elope with him.

1788
02:12:19,689 --> 02:12:21,816
Really?
- l swear on mother.

1789
02:12:23,693 --> 02:12:26,321
Skirts, half saris and saris!

1790
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:28,589
Today you're dead.

1791
02:12:29,098 --> 02:12:31,896
What happened to her?
- She knows about us.

1792
02:12:32,769 --> 02:12:34,259
Knows...

1793
02:12:38,741 --> 02:12:40,675
l was young and ignorant...

1794
02:12:40,843 --> 02:12:42,105
She was little beautiful then...

1795
02:12:42,278 --> 02:12:46,112
You weren't in full form then...
l mean...

1796
02:12:56,673 --> 02:12:59,540
Why are you leaving as if it's over?

1797
02:12:59,709 --> 02:13:01,939
That's right!

1798
02:13:02,111 --> 02:13:06,377
You must also see the people
who made this film, right?

1799
02:13:06,549 --> 02:13:08,039
See it happily!

1800
02:13:30,139 --> 02:13:33,199
Hollywood or Bollywood,
l'm a star!

1801
02:13:35,545 --> 02:13:38,742
Monday or Sunday, l'm happy...

1802
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:47,012
l'm ready always for any fight...

1803
02:13:58,067 --> 02:14:01,093
A hundred note!
lt's mine.

1804
02:14:01,437 --> 02:14:03,200
Brother, that's mine.

1805
02:14:03,806 --> 02:14:05,501
How can you prove it?

1806
02:14:05,875 --> 02:14:08,605
100 is printed on it,
Gandhi photo is on it.

1807
02:14:08,778 --> 02:14:11,212
down, there's Governor's sign.

1808
02:14:15,918 --> 02:14:16,885
Take it.

1809
02:14:17,186 --> 02:14:19,620
He remembers everything.

1810
02:14:24,827 --> 02:14:28,126
Hot sun or rains...

1811
02:14:53,656 --> 02:14:55,681
Uncle, l'll tell you something,
don't get tensed.

1812
02:14:55,858 --> 02:14:58,486
What's it?
- Don't get tensed.

1813
02:14:58,861 --> 02:15:02,024
Don't beat me, l'm sad.
- Why are you sad?

1814
02:15:02,198 --> 02:15:04,928
Do you know who came to my room in
white sari and sporting jasmine in hair?

1815
02:15:05,101 --> 02:15:07,535
Who came?
- Nobody came, that's why l'm sad.

1816
02:15:07,704 --> 02:15:10,172
Why not give your daughter
in marriage to me?- You...

1817
02:15:10,506 --> 02:15:12,940
Going to London, Europe....

1818
02:15:13,109 --> 02:15:15,509
Forgetting it is...

1819
02:15:15,812 --> 02:15:20,840
Never forget those behind this...

1820
02:15:26,255 --> 02:15:31,522
After earning millions,
if you don't give any charity...

1821
02:15:31,961 --> 02:15:36,921
lf your parents don't see you drunk...

1822
02:15:49,345 --> 02:15:52,542
Any place any time...

1823
02:15:54,550 --> 02:15:57,951
Any time any day...

1824
02:16:44,767 --> 02:16:53,266
Though there are any number of stars,
NTR is the best...

1825
02:16:58,881 --> 02:17:03,978
Taj Mahal is best than
any biggest building...

1826
02:17:04,153 --> 02:17:09,420
Chilly bajji is best compared
to pizzas, burgers and sandwiches...
