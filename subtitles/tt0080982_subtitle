1
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,213
The family of Puran Chand.

2
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,783
This is Puran Chand's widow. Savitri.

3
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,622
Dharam Raj. His elder son.

4
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,417
Dharam's wife. Supriya.

5
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,222
Their son. Parikshit.

6
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,399
Puran Chand's second son Bal Raj
and his wife Kiran.

7
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,638
Their son. Sunil.

8
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,902
His third son Bharat Raj
and his wife Subhadra.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,314
Khubchand.
Puran Chand's elder brother.

10
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,413
His wife. Devki.

11
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,554
Their elder son Dhan Raj
and his wife Vibha.

12
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,717
Their two daughters. Dia and Keya.

13
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,058
Khubchand's second son. Sandeep.

14
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,798
This is Bhisham Chand.
He never married.

15
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,464
He had raised his nephews
Khubchand and Puran Chand.

16
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:55,810
And this is Karan Singh. He holds
a very high post in Khubchand Co.

17
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,717
Cheers to you. We bagged the contract
because of you.

18
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,268
Saxena, are you sure everything
is checked properly?

19
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,337
Was there any extra costing

20
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,542
Very little.

21
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,900
Where is brother?

22
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,305
What is the matter?

23
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,410
We lost the contract
for the fourth time.

24
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,138
This is the limit.

25
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,848
All thanks to our cousins
Khubchand And Sons.

26
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,382
But where is brother?

27
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,114
How can their tender quotation
be lesser then ours?

28
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,286
Our profit margin was minimum.
Overheads minimum.

29
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,419
Rejection percentage was minimum too.

30
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,891
We hardly kept
any contingency margin.

31
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,829
They surely must have
waved a magic wand.

32
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,094
Bharat, there's nothing
to get worked up.

33
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,166
So what if we lost the contract?
- But...

34
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,872
Perhaps, in some discipline
their quotation outdid ours.

35
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,211
It must be Karan Singh's doings.

36
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,316
But sister-in-law, it is hard
to figure it out.

37
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,314
Call from Uncle Kishen.

38
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,456
Yes brother?
- How are you?

39
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,561
When did you return?
- Today morning.

40
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,291
How is your Doctorate doing?
- How is Subhadra?

41
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,867
Fine. She fared very well in
her exams. Hopes for a first class.

42
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:27,403
She returned last night from Sonawar.
- Why didn't she contact me?

43
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,905
Only if she is through
with her friends.

44
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,173
Give the line to Bharat.
- One minute.

45
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,076
What about the contract?
- We lost it.

46
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,349
How?
- Let's discuss it tomorrow.

47
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,925
Subhadra has come.
- Really?

48
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,497
Has she stopped wearing frocks?
- Stopped.

49
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,691
She inquires whether your moustache
is still intact or not.

50
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,937
What did he say about Subhadra?

51
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,212
Nothing.

52
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,851
Bharat, shave off your moustache.

53
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,924
If I did, are we going to
win back the contract?

54
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,542
Parikshit, your grandma's not going
to come to feed you in school.

55
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,742
Learn to eat on your own.

56
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,484
Keep all the hassles at home.
But on Bhimshamchand's birthday...

57
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:53,250
no one dare raises his voice. As for
the business affairs, not a word.

58
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,330
Welcome, Subhadra.

59
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,564
You are all grown up!

60
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,301
Welcome.
- Many happy returns of the day!

61
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,382
You do possess a Midas touch.

62
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,915
I get the accolades for
what Karan and Dhan Raj do.

63
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,785
Nevertheless, they make haste.

64
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,058
For you, Dhan Raj will
always remain a kid.

65
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,212
Sing, dear.

66
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,626
Send your father over.

67
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:18,308
What's wrong with him?
- His mom is sending him to Darjeeling

68
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,905
Boarding schools are apt
to acquire discipline.

69
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,975
I would've sent Sandeep, but...
- Is he taking care of his health?

70
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,131
Feed him sweets.

71
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,539
Sandeep is calling you.

72
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:10,056
Let me stay here, Devki.
- No, you need rest. You have fever.

73
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,409
Almost killed me!
- You won't die so soon.

74
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,411
Why are you in a hurry to die?
Eat, drink and enjoy.

75
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,551
If you say, shall I send some
beautiful masseuses?

76
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,385
Did you speak to your wife
about that Swedish masseuse?

77
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,724
It's an adults' drink.

78
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,162
Well!

79
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,507
Your uncle hasn't come?
- He is your uncle too.

80
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,020
Have a drink. Drink it. Come on.

81
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,554
An adult that you are, I preferred
to offer an adults' drink.

82
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,066
Puran Chand companies
have a sound balance sheet.

83
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:30,967
But why the mutual competition?
- It helps the natiors progress.

84
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,737
Do you intend to study further
or make a housewife?

85
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,507
Aunt Supriya never left her studies
even after marriage, however.

86
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,286
Who is she, dear?

87
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:49,255
Lovely! Is it new?
- No, old one.

88
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,986
Aunt Devki's?
- Yes.

89
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,161
When two women meet, they are forever
lost in clothes and jewellery.

90
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,998
Supriya hasn't come.
- They must be on their way.

91
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,742
Come.
- Dia.

92
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,002
Excuse me.

93
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,575
Karan, do you intend to play forever
with others' children?

94
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,816
Can't help it.
I'm born unlucky.

95
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,025
How about some consideration
for the situation?

96
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,051
How about some quick strides?
- Sure. Come, Bharat.

97
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,234
How are you, brother?
- Fine.

98
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,769
How are you, Karan?
- Very fine. Welcome.

99
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,077
What a moustache your uncle has!

100
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,825
Was there any black magic involved
behind the S.T. S contract?

101
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,759
No, we just forwarded our tender.
- Fill the next tender for us.

102
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,232
You will paid double, and
the management will be under you.

103
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,004
Shall we shake hands?

104
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,816
Are you related to Dhan Raj?

105
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,381
Friend.

106
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,117
Friend?
- Yes.

107
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,261
Go and meet grandpa.
Where is Bharat?

108
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,295
Wort you meet Bhisham grandpa?

109
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,572
I hear, you are sending
Parikshit to Darjeeling?

110
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,139
All is well, I guess?
- Yes.

111
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,786
What were you talking?
With Bharat?

112
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,553
He offered me double pay.

113
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:47,969
Bharat, business is like a game.
You win some, lose some.

114
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:56,571
Grandpa, a soccer match
results in killings.

115
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,176
But you underquoted tenders to win
three of our projects.

116
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,685
Including the S.T. S project.
What games do you play to underquote?

117
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,685
No games. It's all
Karars head at work.

118
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,598
Don't we have 3 high precision
imported machines?

119
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:20,672
Karars connections in England
had earned them a special contract...

120
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:28,943
The government provided them with
3 imported high precision machines.

121
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:35,075
They still possess them. Which
explains their underquoting tenders.

122
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,222
Including the S.T. S project.

123
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,614
No question of costing.

124
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,892
And the brain behind
all this is Karan.

125
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,289
Why does everyone loathe Karan?

126
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,235
Karan has made a place
for himself on his own.

127
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,968
Overcoming one's own shortcomings
is no joke.

128
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:59,236
Yes. But to lose a contract won'th
270 million is a joke.

129
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:05,814
Why worry? We'll surely win
a contract to rear horses? Say what?

130
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,414
Brother, we must appeal at any cost.

131
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,586
Go ahead if you want to.
But...

132
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,486
why do you have to get annoyed
at everything? It is bad.

133
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,551
In business, one ought to
keep his cool.

134
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,932
Sunil, call up Uncle Kishen.

135
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,502
I'll get him.

136
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,614
Bharat, you have been
drinking profusely.

137
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,063
Come on, dear.

138
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,133
Anything important that I can do...?

139
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,142
No. Take rest.

140
00:19:56,261 --> 00:20:01,927
Where does Karan get his ideas from?
- You know, Karan wanted to marry me?

141
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,035
What are you saying?

142
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,438
Sister-in-law, he must not have been
a sole candidate.

143
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,643
Brother, speak to Bharat.

144
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,948
What's the matter?

145
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,080
We'll have to appeal
against the S.T. S contract.

146
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,189
Found any sound technical point?
- Let's discuss it with your experts.

147
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,550
Sure.

148
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,059
Rush of hope. We might be saved

149
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,652
Are you changing, or are you
cooking up something?

150
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,228
Are you famished?

151
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,931
Quite obvious, for all
the hard day's work.

152
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,002
How many flies did you kill
at the party.

153
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,706
Come here. I'll tell you.

154
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:35,182
What's the urgency? Supriya and
her husband make an interesting pair.

155
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,123
He is forever into books.
- Shut up.

156
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:42,092
And Aunt Devki and Vibha
are mad about jewellery.

157
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,633
At the time of distribution,
I should've been considered.

158
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,464
Had you been a grizzly
on your previous life?

159
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,499
Message for you, sir.

160
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,673
Sahib, Mr Dhan Raj asked you
to call him up.

161
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,340
They have appealed
against the S.T. S contract.

162
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:17,614
What?
- Yes. Come over quickly.

163
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:28,859
They have shown their won'th.
They had decided it on your birthday.

164
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,762
It's just an appeal.

165
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,804
The contract hasn't slipped out
of our hands, has it?

166
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,042
Not only this contract is in jeopardy,
but also all the last three.

167
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,714
It is only because of those imported
machines that we had underquoted.

168
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,054
. Bharat must have objected to it.

169
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:56,190
I had warned you that all our
four tenders can be objected to.

170
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,190
Karan, you had made haste.

171
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,195
But you signed it.

172
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,198
I only signed it.

173
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,234
But grandpa...
- What had to happen has happened.

174
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,943
Suppose our contract is cancelled...

175
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:18,344
and Puran Chand company is determined
to acquire the machines...

176
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,351
and the government accepts
their proposal...

177
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,681
then our previous three projects
will be stalled.

178
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:29,153
570,000,000! Projects
won'th 570,000,000 is in peril.

179
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,085
But the machines from the government
were very confidential.

180
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,860
How did they come to know?

181
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,866
Dhan Raj, perhaps I committed
this mistake.

182
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:51,946
Bharat was upset with the
S.T. S project on my birthday.

183
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,881
While reasoning with him, I spilled.

184
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,452
Yes, perhaps.

185
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:33,017
He is getting old.
- What's new about it?

186
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,991
Sandeep, you have to go to
see the doctor. Go.

187
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,293
So? You are here?

188
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,268
You must not cry.

189
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,205
Come.
- No.

190
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,334
Subhadra, take this in.
I'll be right back.

191
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:10,653
By winning the appeal, you've bagged
a project of 270 million.

192
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,987
With that comes the three machines.
Now watch the fun.

193
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,290
Shall I talk to mother?
- Don't tell her you've spoken to me.

194
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,535
Chicken!

195
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,538
Ramdin, have you polished
Parikshit's shoes?

196
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,729
Coming up.

197
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,747
Mother, if you stay here,
he won't stop crying.

198
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,407
It's time. Let him get ready.

199
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,099
How are you?
- Fine.

200
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,074
Milk for Bharat and Sunil.
Would you mind giving them?

201
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,583
So what if Parikshit is going to
school? He'll come during vacations.

202
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,156
And moreover, children from
boarding schools never go astray.

203
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,925
Supriya's stupid resolution! You mean
to say children go astray at home?

204
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,798
Does Sunil have any vices?
- Didrt he drop out of college?

205
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,401
But, isn't he wholeheartedly
learning business from Bharat?

206
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,465
Congratulations for winning
the S.T. S contract!

207
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:39,239
What's going on with Dhan Raj Co.
- Just a business fight, Savitri.

208
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,613
Tell me, have you resolved to make
Bharat a celibate for life?

209
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,807
Bharat! Does he have
any regard for my word?

210
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:52,948
Milk.

211
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,123
Milk!

212
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,508
You play.
- Do you know to play badminton?

213
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,974
Have you been to college?
- Do you know how much is .3 micron?

214
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,079
100th part of this hair is .3 micron.

215
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,982
Now, do you understand
what is .3 micron?

216
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,225
You...!

217
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,736
Don't!

218
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:49,069
It's your decision that matters first.
- What do you say Bal Raj?

219
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,316
Agree to it, mother. You will have
one more granddaughter to play with.

220
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,496
Better speak to Bharat.

221
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,046
Bharat, your mother has agreed.
- Now think about Subhadra.

222
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:35,050
If not his only daughter, who else
would he think about?

223
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,530
Congratulations!
- What for?

224
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,495
Your mother and Bharat have agreed.
- On what?

225
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,067
On Subhadra.
- I see.

226
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,872
Let me change. Take his consent.
- Why my consent?

227
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,402
Bharat, my happiness lies in yours.

228
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,640
Well, have you taken permission

229
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,981
Permission? Do you think this
is a government office?

230
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,427
If you cry, no vacations for you!
- Symphony...?

231
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,111
How come you manage to
come early today?

232
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,512
Mother has agreed to
Bharat and Subhadra's wedding.

233
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,784
What?
- Yes.

234
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,661
I see. But...
Subhadra is still a kid.

235
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,137
Is she is a kid?

236
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,365
Keep them in the car.

237
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,138
Grandma!

238
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:07,607
Oh come on! Why so much sweets?
D'you plan to feed the whole school?

239
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,745
The more you cuddle him,
the more he will whine.

240
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,161
You motherhood may not beckon you...!

241
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:22,228
Oh my prince. Don't cry.
We will call you back very soon.

242
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,603
Ramdin, get Parikshit's luggage down.

243
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,678
Come, dear.
- No!

244
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,988
Hey, don't yell.
They will tease you in school.

245
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,191
Say bye.

246
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,005
Don't cry. Good boy.

247
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,539
Are you coming, Bharat?

248
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,572
Whining away!

249
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:13,081
What is it, dear? Don't cry.

250
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,216
Shut up!
- You're coming during vacations.

251
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,086
How is it?
- Good. What do you say?

252
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,430
Well...!

253
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,989
But we came here on your behest.

254
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,324
Just because you said it's going
to be fun, I came.

255
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,011
We'll move, if you say.

256
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,390
Bharat is here.
Time for me to go.

257
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,390
Okay.

258
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,073
Karan Singh is here.

259
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,688
They have some good
French vintage stuff.

260
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,758
You look gorgeous!

261
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:29,169
Why do you swear?
- It is the truth.

262
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,465
There's no sign of his parents.
Thanks to Bhisham grandpa...

263
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,942
for rearing him, else...
- He is so handsome!

264
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,512
Really?
- The girl he proposes...

265
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,652
will be really fortunate.
- And stupid, too.

266
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:14,310
Please have your Limca.
- Have your French vintage wine.

267
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,787
What is to be done now?
- Let's have a soft drink.

268
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,321
Shall we dance?
- Sure.

269
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:29,196
The sister goes to the same house...
as the daughter.

270
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,567
Your brother must've given it
a good thought, isn't it?

271
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,791
And the age difference!

272
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:57,064
Hasrt Subhadra come of age?
- But, such age difference!

273
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,202
Ten years later, what?
Think about it.

274
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,307
A few years of marital bliss, and
rest of his life man lives it up.

275
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:46,445
Grandpa, do regard my word sometimes.
- Control yourself.

276
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:51,213
You suffered a loss in the
silver deal. Don't I understand...

277
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,016
What had to happen has happened.
Why dig up the past?

278
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,023
Because you are bent on doing wrong.

279
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:03,732
What's the big deal?
Even after the government's order...

280
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,098
the machines should be
with us, right? It will be with us.

281
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,675
Puran Chand's sons won't go
against my words.

282
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,979
What is the guarantee?

283
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:27,087
All right. Do as you wish.
But first, throw me out of this.

284
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,397
Grandpa refuses to appoint Saxena.

285
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,307
What about the machines?
- He says...

286
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,446
he'll try to cancel its' transfer.
- What's the problem then?

287
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,808
They are ill-intentioned!
Untrustwon'thy!

288
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,812
It is proved. Didrt the contract
go their way?

289
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,548
And why did this matter of
transfer of machines come up?

290
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,091
But if grandpa says...

291
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:48,098
After all, they are your cousins.
- Cousins...?!

292
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:55,536
Hypocrites they are! Bastards!

293
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:10,119
The truth is, my uncle was not
capable enough to produce children.

294
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,188
He was impotent.

295
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,795
But grandpa deliberately
got him to marry.

296
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,168
Those three are
not Uncle Puran Chand's.

297
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:32,204
A religious man used to stay with us.
Swami Premanand.

298
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:39,549
Aunt Savitri served him well.
That explains their creation.

299
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:46,021
Unbelievable, isn't it?

300
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,626
How does it concern with business?

301
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,469
If Grandpa manages to stop
the transfer of machines...

302
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,031
There are other ways to stop it.

303
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,446
Is your sir in?

304
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,050
Uncle Bharat's wedding invitation.

305
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,985
Did he send you?
- Grandma did.

306
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,629
How is she?
- She's fine.

307
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,503
Has your aunt Supriya
finished her Doctorate?

308
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:40,683
And you haven't finished your college?
- No.

309
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,079
Why not?

310
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,719
I'm training under Uncle Bharat.

311
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,381
"I see"? What for?

312
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,694
I know you dislike him.

313
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,498
Why do you have to fall in between
matured peoples' fight?

314
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,098
Yes Dhan Raj?

315
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,532
I'm leaving.
- One minute.

316
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,741
Convey my thanks to grandma.

317
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:16,779
We are invited for Bharat's wedding.
- I received the invitation just now.

318
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,422
I plan to introduce you
to a distant relative.

319
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:24,119
Who is it?
- You'll get to meet him. See you.

320
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,206
Welcome!

321
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,452
Dhan Raj is here!

322
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,819
Hello! How are you?

323
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,159
Everyone jam up.

324
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,389
Sandeep?
- Coming.

325
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,661
Could you please step aside?

326
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,845
Frame me in, too. Oh come on.

327
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,186
Pan a little.

328
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:31,851
Congratulations!

329
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,194
Congratulations!

330
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,571
God bless!

331
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,554
Happy married life!

332
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,376
One unavoidable glitch in weddings...
moustache has to be shaved off.

333
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,242
Which is why perhaps you are
still out of it, right?

334
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,528
Look, Keya, that's you.

335
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,758
Sandeep, change your profession.
Become a tv cameraman.

336
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,001
Kiran doesn't pass off
as Sunil's mother.

337
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,798
Yeah? I was dropped from the skies!

338
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,268
Say what?

339
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,869
Who's that?!

340
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:07,017
Do not embarrass me. You have done
a lot for the two families.

341
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:12,025
You never built your family.
Can't we do this much for you?

342
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:16,859
Savitri, if you could reason out
with Bharat, the matter would subside

343
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:22,101
And Dhan Raj will be saved.
- Trust me. Bharat won't go against me

344
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,319
As lovely as the moon!

345
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,469
Welcome!

346
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,481
Swamiji!

347
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,659
This is obviously to humiliate me!

348
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:22,756
I won't mediate anymore. Let
Bharat and Dhan Raj settle it out.

349
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:29,538
Bharat, you are perhaps meeting
Swami Premanand for the first time?

350
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:33,240
He was the guru of Aunt Savitri
and her father.

351
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,877
May you live forever
in marital bliss.

352
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,004
How are you, Devki?

353
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,188
Is Khubchand well?

354
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,932
Why the suspicion in your eyes?

355
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,702
Dhan Raj called me over.
It is just a matter of coincidence.

356
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,214
By the way, I was supposed to come
and meet everyone.

357
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:47,979
Son, believe me, apologise
to Savitri. It'd change the tide.

358
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:05,132
Past is past. Grandpa has left.

359
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,663
You are the number one now.
Now you decide on it.

360
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,037
And whatever you decide upon,
let me be a part of it.

361
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,469
It's going to be lot more demanding,
and will need more attention, Sandeep

362
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,477
You will strain yourself in vain.
- It was demanding earlier, too.

363
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,081
I didn't die, did I?

364
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,744
The doctor has forbidden you.
- Beautiful girls excite me.

365
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,889
Movies excite me.
Tennis matches excite me.

366
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,786
What more will you forbid me to?

367
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,033
What has to be done of him?
- Let's make him a part of it...

368
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,295
for some consolation.

369
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,901
So, shall I contact Bhavani Pandey?

370
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,663
Why isn't that man working...
on the machine?

371
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,769
I'll check, sir.
- Do it.

372
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:29,341
It's been half hour now.
Why don't you start your work?

373
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,345
I won't do this job?
- Why not?

374
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,156
It is a new contract.
And the union does not permit me.

375
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,086
Start the work. Pronto!
Else, I'll chargesheet you.

376
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,354
Desai, don't you threaten me.
Understand?

377
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,590
What is it?
- Don't you interfere. Move it.

378
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,566
Why do you swear at him?
- Who swore? Get on with your work.

379
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,365
Don't touch me!
- How dare you!

380
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,369
Go to your place!

381
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,681
No more production.
The Union is backing us.

382
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,185
We won't do the new job.

383
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:34,916
Hold it! Listen.

384
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,251
Yes?
- Listen.

385
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,618
Quiet!

386
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,127
Tools down!

387
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,300
Move. Everyone move out.

388
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:57,838
. to the ground.

389
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,968
Send Mhatre in.

390
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,812
Do not make the mistake
of chargesheeting him.

391
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,048
Then? Do I let them rule over?

392
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,919
They go on strike at will.
This is the limit!

393
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,659
There's something
known as discipline, too.

394
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,103
Pandey is the man
behind this mischief.

395
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,444
In the name of bonus, he's trying
to instigate the workers.

396
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,806
Just to get a hold on the union.
- Chargesheet is unavoidable...

397
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,347
Have patience.

398
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:46,885
After the meeting,
the work will resume.

399
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,088
It's preposterous to bring up
bonus at this point.

400
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,330
Work came to a halt
because of our mistake.

401
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,695
Which is why, we must
commence work immediately.

402
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:05,506
The management has guaranteed.
No worker will be chargesheeted.

403
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:10,238
Nor anyone will be suspended.
- Every word of his is a lie.

404
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:14,249
They are cheating us.
It is their toady speaking.

405
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,948
The management has bought him.
- This is a lie.

406
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:22,717
Do not get carried away by him.
You know of him since all these years

407
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:29,590
I hope Mhatre won't betray us?
- He has always supported us.

408
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,527
That scoundrel Pandey
ought to be thrashed.

409
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,532
This company has acquired a contract
of 270 million from the government.

410
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,975
For which we need a bonus.

411
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,173
First comes the bonus,
then begins the work.

412
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:47,739
No friends. Everyone of us
is aware of the contract.

413
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,883
It's a no-profit proposition.

414
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:57,286
Yet, the management has promised
to provide a bonus on completion.

415
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,157
Nothing comes out of promises.
Let them make an agreement with us.

416
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,628
On paper.

417
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,361
Listen friends. This contract is a
very significant one for our country.

418
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,202
We aren't mere workers. We are
also citizens of this country.

419
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,775
Are we traitors of this country?!
This is a ploy!

420
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,775
In the name of our country,
they are trying to mislead us.

421
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:22,446
We want bonus! And we will have it!

422
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,983
We won't allow them to pressurise us.
We will fight...

423
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:27,588
we will raise our voice,
and we will go on strike!

424
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,985
Those with me, will quit
this meeting, right now.

425
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:36,323
We will fight for our rights!

426
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:41,793
Listen to me friends. Do not get
carried away by someone.

427
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:48,033
Come back.

428
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,942
Pointless strikes are unproductive.

429
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:59,288
Believe me, this contract
holds no profit. Come back.

430
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,668
Why did you shave off your moustache?
- Moustache?

431
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,269
Yes. Moustache?

432
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:59,306
It was your Aunt Supriya's order.
- On her command...

433
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,238
you'd even jump into fire.

434
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,436
That's precisely what I did.

435
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:16,357
One thing is clear.

436
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,588
You are quite experienced.
- On what?

437
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:23,962
On this.

438
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,983
We will fight for our rights!

439
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:09,776
Long live Puran Chand Union!

440
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:15,747
Down with Mechanical Workers Union!

441
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,020
Listen...

442
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,019
Mhatre, it's no good
fighting each other.

443
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:35,832
Long live Mechanical Labours Union.

444
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:42,707
If need be, we'll all sit here.
- No need. We'll try shifts.

445
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:49,350
Mr Bal Raj is a conman!

446
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,184
Mr Bal Raj is a conman!

447
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,069
Sit down. Those who are coming
with me, follow me.

448
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,810
Rest of you, stay here.
- All right.

449
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:18,538
And if rain falls, move under
the tree. No one leaves.

450
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:24,885
Sit. We are on night shift.

451
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:39,627
We started off well.
- It'll take momentum tomorrow.

452
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:44,532
The management will call a meeting.
Mark my words, they'll sweat.

453
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,635
It's going to be fun.

454
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,240
What the heck! Let go!

455
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,612
Help! Help!

456
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,127
Madhav!

457
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,475
This discount will be valid
only on areas...

458
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:24,373
where fixed discount charges
on steel production exist.

459
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:31,843
As you know, famous Industrialists
Puran Chand Dharam Raj and Brothers...

460
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:38,755
have been of late, realising some
important government assignment.

461
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:45,967
Last night, unidentified persons
assaulted 3 of their workers...

462
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:51,970
with weapons, injuring two. They were
immediately rushed to the hospital.

463
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,837
One of the workers is said
to be serious.

464
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:06,418
The matter is getting out of hand.
Bhavani's man will certainly die.

465
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,319
I hope we are not accused
of killing him.

466
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,196
Bharat's presence would've
made a difference.

467
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:20,396
Supriya, when Bharat was in America,
Dharam and Bal Raj handled all matters

468
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:21,870
But...

469
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,198
By the way,
aunt is right, grandma.

470
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,377
You're reading a book during dinner.
What kind of habit is this?

471
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,807
Aunt reads, too.

472
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,612
Ass! Talking back, are you?

473
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:54,635
Ill-mannered! Everyone has
pampered him. This is the limit!

474
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,649
By God, the line should disconnect.

475
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,267
Yes, Sister-in-law?
I'm Bharat here.

476
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:27,260
What?

477
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,547
Got disconnected.

478
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,884
This country's telephones
will never improve.

479
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,546
Nor will its men.

480
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,296
Don't ponder so much over work.
- Yeah?

481
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,959
Should I only think of this?
- Yes.

482
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,731
Here?
- Right here.

483
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:15,312
Let Mhatre answer me,
if he has the guts.

484
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:19,984
What is our fault?
The management has bagged...

485
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,716
a contract of 270 million

486
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,056
Is it a crime to ask for a
few morsels more for the workers?

487
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:28,321
No!

488
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,998
Is it a sin to ask for one's right?
- No!

489
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,999
Tell me, is it a sin?
Last night...

490
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:39,335
Mhatre and his goons attacked us.
- He is lying.

491
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:47,011
Mhatre and his goons attacked us
with batons and daggers.

492
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:51,343
Our friend Madhav Kulkarni
was killed.

493
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,355
Nonsense! He is lying!

494
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:58,354
These people! These people
have killed Madhav Kulkarni!

495
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:05,595
They have killed our worker friend!

496
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:16,537
Look.

497
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,980
Look! This is Mhatre's true self.

498
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,581
He is a dog of the management!

499
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,112
Mechanical Labour Union.

500
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:31,580
We made it!
They have locked-out.

501
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,259
Which means, for the time being
our machines are safe in our factory.

502
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:46,265
Is Dharam capable of resolving this?
- He'll never agree to Pandey's demands

503
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:56,473
When is Bharat coming back?
- What difference does it make?

504
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:41,512
Yes, sister-in-law?
One minute.

505
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,528
Yes?

506
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,522
What?

507
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,525
Is that so?

508
01:12:58,407 --> 01:12:59,533
Okay.

509
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,641
What is the matter?
- We take the first flight to Bombay.

510
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:53,622
Bhavani Pandey's mars death
complicated the matter so much that...

511
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,822
we had to lock-out.
- It must be resolved at the soonest.

512
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,600
Like you say...
- Cent percent right.

513
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,601
We must talk to Bhavani Pandey.

514
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:08,102
Mhatre failed. Moreover,
brother won't agree to it.

515
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,278
Then forget the completion
of S.T. S project.

516
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,277
The deadline has to be
met with, isn't it?

517
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:18,418
It's a project won'th 270 million. And
the government is on top of our head.

518
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:22,423
Agreed. But how will you make
brother agree?

519
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,927
This is pure business.
Not a charitable institution.

520
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,873
I hope everyone is well at home?

521
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,519
Shall we come to the point?
- It will save time.

522
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,230
Terms...
- Bonus.

523
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,131
No. That later.

524
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:15,338
Your majority is questionable.

525
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:18,671
Well, wait for the Union elections
if you want.

526
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,145
Will your Union recognise it?

527
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,489
The right to the agreement
remains with us.

528
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:32,292
Sans the extra bonus demand.
- For the time being.

529
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,425
Till the new project is completed.

530
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:45,266
But the workers will have to be
assured that bonus is on the cards.

531
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,516
Do we need to shake hands on this?

532
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:05,058
You feel the need?
- No.

533
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:12,398
Pandey will never chuck his stand
on bonus. He is our time-bomb.

534
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:17,733
To trust Pandey is a gamble.
Anyway, forget what has happened.

535
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:21,965
How do we profit from this new plan?
- We do gain.

536
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,606
If the government gets wind of the
scandals in Puran Chand factory...

537
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,876
the S.T. S project
will be jeopardised.

538
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,885
And the order to get the machines
transferred, may even get cancelled.

539
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:39,352
And they will lose prestige in
banking circles and stock market.

540
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,552
What will be the plan of action?

541
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,639
Their first consignment
of special imported steel...

542
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:58,905
is slated to reach the docks
in few days.

543
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,483
As usual, it will be
transported in trucks.

544
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:07,552
The trucks will be hijacked before
it reaches their factory.

545
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:13,326
. but only for few days. Naturally,
the Puran Chand family will fret.

546
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:17,060
They will complain to the police.
They'll try to claim the insurance.

547
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,569
Then, the police will be
informed that...

548
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,604
the trucks are right inside
Puran Chand factory.

549
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:47,323
The consignment has reached on 25th.
It should be delivered on time.

550
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,497
You will get the advance
tomorrow. Okay?

551
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:02,627
The stolen special steels are
for an important government project.

552
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:06,297
What takes you so long to trace it?
- Don't worry.

553
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,959
This case is our priority.

554
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,205
Whoever did it, it is
done professionally.

555
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,377
It must be Karan Singh.

556
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,580
The steels are not stolen to
trade them in the black market.

557
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:26,981
It is an effort to sabotage
our S.T. S project.

558
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:33,459
Of late, you've been
dreaming of sabotage.

559
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,796
The police is investigating. And...
- Brother...

560
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:39,227
Why are you scared to face the truth?

561
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,547
Good news?

562
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,519
The police will be informed
today, on phone.

563
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,816
We need to inform our agent.

564
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:05,250
No need to supervise.

565
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,696
Tonight you won't hover around
near that place.

566
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,343
This is the limit!

567
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,059
What's wrong?

568
01:21:57,145 --> 01:22:01,241
I'll be right back.
- Your concern won't settle matters.

569
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,650
But where are you going?
- Stop nagging

570
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,079
I'm going to take a look
at the factory.

571
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,336
Hello sir!

572
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:33,346
Joshi, is everything okay?
- Yes sir.

573
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,111
Bye sir.

574
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:59,135
Oh my God! Move!

575
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,780
Open the gate.

576
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:16,208
Faster!

577
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,213
Faster!

578
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:39,731
Company goods.
- Wait.

579
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:56,255
Halt the truck. Stop!

580
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:01,423
Get down. Right now.

581
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:06,261
Didrt you hear? Get down!
- Take them away.

582
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:19,140
I'm Joshi, factory security.
- Yes?

583
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:24,581
Police is here. Few trucks came too.
The police have seized them.

584
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:26,619
I'll be right there.

585
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,084
I must go to the factory.

586
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:15,868
You had complained of your consignment
being stolen from the docks.

587
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:17,800
The goods are right here.

588
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:21,505
You want the goods as well as usurp
the insurance as well?

589
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:28,147
No, inspector. That's not true.
- Then what is?

590
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:31,978
If rich like you are bent on stealing,
what fault is of the poor?

591
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:35,122
Just keep your investigations on. Our
lawyers will take care of the rest.

592
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:09,620
Sandeep... you?

593
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:16,386
Why werert you stopping your car?
I gave you signals.

594
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:20,999
What is the matter? Are you out
at midnight on a new adventure?

595
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:27,739
Why don't you answer me? Come on.

596
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,404
Come out.

597
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,539
Out!

598
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,412
What were you doing outside our
factory in the middle of the night?

599
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,413
I ask you, what were you doing?

600
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:45,214
Answer me!

601
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,423
What were you doing outside
our factory? Tell me.

602
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,429
Tell me! Were you upto something?

603
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:57,931
Tell me! Why don't you speak?

604
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:14,753
What happened to him?

605
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:17,449
Sandeep! What's wrong with you?

606
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:21,055
You were all right...

607
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:27,700
Come on, let's take him
to the hospital.

608
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:20,521
People are coming. Control yourself.

609
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:58,610
I warned him several times
not to get excited with work.

610
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:05,049
. to take rest.
But he wouldn't listen.

611
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,951
He'll listen no more.

612
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:15,428
Who can win over Time?
- How I wish Time would take me!

613
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:21,972
My young son!

614
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,959
Karan, my younger brother is no more.

615
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:48,059
What harm had he done to anyone?

616
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:56,272
He was murdered.
They killed him!

617
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:04,347
Wasrt Bal Raj aware of
Sandeep's illness?

618
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:50,291
The samples are ready.
Once they are approved...

619
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:52,328
you may take a hike for a month.

620
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:01,737
Did Karan Singh contact you?

621
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:03,934
Who...?
- Karan.

622
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,740
No.

623
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:11,243
You will inform us if he
contacts you, won't you?

624
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:15,952
You won't forget, will you?
- No sir.

625
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:29,067
Are you happy?

626
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:32,764
Yes.

627
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:37,771
. and no.

628
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:44,574
I feel restless from deep within.
I feel like doing something.

629
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:51,790
What'd you like to do?
- Research.

630
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:56,026
Where?
- In America.

631
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,330
When would you like to go?

632
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,541
You'll have to help us out a bit.

633
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:20,318
It'd have been safer had you
offered me the job earlier.

634
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:24,625
Now their eyes are set on me.
And this project comes under...

635
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:26,952
the Defence department.
There's something known as...

636
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:29,629
the Central Bureau of Investigations
in our country.

637
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:44,004
What? Really?

638
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:02,524
You guessed it right.

639
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:19,103
Kiran, buy some blue colour wool
to knit two sweaters for Parikshit.

640
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:25,879
Our samples got rejected.

641
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:32,885
We will bear the loss. We'll bring in
a foreign expert in place of Saxena.

642
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:34,888
Then what?

643
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:41,891
Let's talk to Kishen, and try to
acquire control on their management.

644
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:48,065
No. It will develop more differences.
- So what?

645
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,938
Why get into unnecessary hassles?
- Mother, you wouldn't know...

646
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:55,582
we have lost face in the market.
They stole our special steels...

647
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,718
and made us the thief
in front of others.

648
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:13,361
And now, we're being held responsible
for Sandeep's death.

649
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:16,426
You too were adamant, and had
the machines transferred?

650
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:20,128
And why not? It was lawfully ours.

651
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:23,934
All right, but...
- Uncle Bharat!

652
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,277
The news is true.
Saxena has flown to America.

653
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:39,721
His throat must be slit!
- Shame on you, Bharat!

654
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:42,622
You must not spit such evil words.
- Why not?

655
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,561
It is all that bastard's misdeeds.
Ask brother if you want to.

656
01:36:50,004 --> 01:36:54,566
Yes, mother.
All these moves have to Karars.

657
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,970
Listen...

658
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:01,174
Some men have come. They say,
they are from the tax department.

659
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,983
This is it! Last thing
that was expected.

660
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:17,795
Every detail has been provided in the
income and wealth tax returns files.

661
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:20,224
You can check all items.

662
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,993
Go ahead and search as you please.

663
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:12,712
Is this any way to search?
Don't you have manners?

664
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:16,388
Racking black money
is mannerly, isn't it?

665
01:38:27,635 --> 01:38:30,297
These men...
Can't you do something?

666
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:39,069
Bharat! What are you thinking?

667
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:44,815
Just how to break the backbone
of Karan Singh and Dhan Raj.

668
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:54,791
It was natural of you to fret
at Dhan Raj's actions.

669
01:38:54,962 --> 01:39:00,559
After Sandeep's death the rift
between our families is on the rise.

670
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:07,096
What if Bharat does something
untoward? He disregards my words.

671
01:39:08,309 --> 01:39:12,712
Savitri, the situation can still be
brought under control, but...

672
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,108
But what?

673
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:19,116
You'll have to tell Karan the truth.

674
01:39:23,891 --> 01:39:26,689
His world will turn topsy turvy.

675
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,629
Why should injustice
be done to him once again?

676
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:32,123
You want to stop destruction,
don't you?

677
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:36,131
All your life were you not
subjected to injustice?

678
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:39,538
Your father's blind faith
in Swami Premanand...

679
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:42,642
made you a mother while you were
still a spinster.

680
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:46,936
You had to forsake Karan.
And...

681
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:53,284
did I not do injustice to you, when
I got you married to Puran Chand?

682
01:39:56,924 --> 01:39:58,448
Believe me, Savitri.

683
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:04,622
And, wasrt Puran obstinate on
letting the Swami stay with you?

684
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:11,504
But... we have to save
both the families.

685
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:17,708
But Bharat, to become the director
of Khubchand and Company...

686
01:40:17,878 --> 01:40:20,847
he has to buy
their shares in plenty.

687
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:24,644
And that'd need a lot of money.

688
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:29,178
I thought, my father-in-law would...
- What can I do all by myself?

689
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:33,721
You have friends too.
- What if we fail...

690
01:40:33,894 --> 01:40:37,591
to get control over the company?
We lose the investment.

691
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:41,832
If we are on their board,
Karars monopoly can be restricted.

692
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:48,873
True. Are we using the
government machines?

693
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:52,440
Their last three projects
must be in dire circumstances.

694
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:58,409
The government will have to look for
other companies to complete them.

695
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:03,217
That is, Puran Chand
Dharam Raj and Brothers.

696
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:07,819
Karan Singh will have no place
to hide his face.

697
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:10,223
And, Dhan Raj was in need
of competition.

698
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,948
Karan, I...
- Turn off the music and stay out.

699
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:09,280
Come.

700
01:42:15,329 --> 01:42:19,698
Something important?
- Surprised to see me here?

701
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:26,903
Tell me. - Dhan Raj has told you
everything about Swamiji, hasn't he?

702
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:40,419
And he's holding Bal Raj responsible
for Sandeep's death, isn't he?

703
01:42:43,957 --> 01:42:46,323
We have to bring an end
to this feud, Karan.

704
01:42:48,428 --> 01:42:53,593
I've seen blood in Dhan Raj's eyes.
He can do anything.

705
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:00,599
I'll reach you home.

706
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:22,090
Come. Your sons must be waiting
for you at home.

707
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:35,573
I have one more son.
The eldest of all.

708
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:39,505
Ask Bhisham grandpa about him.

709
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:31,658
Nothing can be done now.

710
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:38,566
There sure will be a way out.
- When?

711
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:44,244
The injunctions under Companies Act,
has been overruled.

712
01:44:48,148 --> 01:44:54,644
If they buy our shares, our share
value will rise. And we will...

713
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:59,722
And Bharat will sit on our board.
I can't bear to see it.

714
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:06,462
All our three projects
have been stalled.

715
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:13,664
And there's no chance of obtaining
a loan for new machines.

716
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:21,279
Shall I talk to Bharat
What for?

717
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:27,649
A compromise could be reached.
- Compromise?

718
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,292
He is bent on destroying us.

719
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:39,491
He can be stopped.
- How?

720
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:49,505
There's only one way to stop Bharat.

721
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:54,313
At 8 tomorrow,
he has an appointment...

722
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:58,773
with the Minister of
Nigerian Industries.

723
01:46:07,327 --> 01:46:11,024
What's your planning?
- Bharat's accident.

724
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:18,130
No, Dhan Raj.
- Sandeep's was an accident, too.

725
01:46:20,307 --> 01:46:24,107
But this is killing. Murder!

726
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:30,546
What else had happened to Sandeep?

727
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,346
He was my brother!

728
01:48:03,276 --> 01:48:07,804
Hail Lord Ganpati!

729
01:49:44,644 --> 01:49:46,737
Tea sir?
- No.

730
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:29,377
Where is brother? Got him on line?
- In the paddock. I've sent for him.

731
01:51:47,734 --> 01:51:50,100
Did you get him on the line?
- Not yet.

732
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:07,117
Where's the other file?
- Right there.

733
01:52:15,695 --> 01:52:17,287
Tell brother...

734
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,564
Do you have to play music all day?

735
01:52:23,636 --> 01:52:25,194
Tell him to meet me over there.

736
01:52:48,361 --> 01:52:49,919
Sister-in-law, I'm leaving.

737
01:53:04,577 --> 01:53:06,670
Who is it?
- Call mother.

738
01:53:08,148 --> 01:53:11,606
I said, call Mrs Puran Chand.
Quick, will you?

739
01:53:16,156 --> 01:53:17,953
Call for you, mother.

740
01:53:19,559 --> 01:53:21,959
Call for you, mother.
- I'll receive it here.

741
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,145
Who is it?
- Bharat hasn't left, I guess?

742
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:45,979
What?
- Stop him.

743
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:48,780
Who is speaking?
- Don't let him out.

744
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:51,515
Stop him. His life is in danger.
- Who...

745
01:53:51,691 --> 01:53:55,593
He's going to meet with an accident.
- Who is this?

746
01:53:57,897 --> 01:53:59,888
Please stop him! Please!

747
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:02,230
Stop him!

748
01:54:08,908 --> 01:54:11,809
Bharat, stop.
- What's the matter, mother?

749
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:13,806
You are not going anywhere.

750
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:17,741
Get out of the car.
I said, out!

751
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:20,486
What's wrong, mother?
- You aren't going anywhere.

752
01:54:20,653 --> 01:54:23,645
Why not?
- I had a bad vision.

753
01:54:23,823 --> 01:54:26,792
I have an important meeting.
- No. You are going nowhere.

754
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:29,257
What are you talking?

755
01:54:30,063 --> 01:54:33,829
If you go, you'll be responsible
for my death.

756
01:54:34,067 --> 01:54:35,227
But mother...

757
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:49,542
Sunil, take my car and give these
papers to brother. Quick.

758
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,187
Let's go.

759
01:55:02,962 --> 01:55:05,055
What's gone wrong with mother?

760
01:55:07,267 --> 01:55:09,235
I'm right here.
I haven't gone anywhere.

761
01:55:09,602 --> 01:55:11,661
Who has taken the car?
- Sunil.

762
01:55:11,838 --> 01:55:15,797
Sunil? Stop him.
Supriya, stop my Sunil.

763
01:55:15,975 --> 01:55:19,570
What are you staring at?
Save him! Where is Bal Raj?

764
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:22,714
Sunil! Driver, stop!

765
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:29,082
Where is everyone?
Save my child. Call him back.

766
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:33,085
Oh God!

767
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:39,658
What?

768
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:50,158
Devki, what's wrong?
Who is it?

769
01:56:52,972 --> 01:56:54,735
Devki, what's wrong?

770
01:56:58,277 --> 01:57:02,338
Bal Raj's son met with an accident.
- Is he hurt seriously?

771
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:28,735
What's happening?
- Vibha, tell the driver.

772
01:57:29,108 --> 01:57:30,666
We are going there.

773
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:43,716
Yes, sir is here.
He's having his breakfast.

774
01:57:45,258 --> 01:57:48,557
Who is it? Madam Vibha?
One minute.

775
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:06,042
Bharat, I'm Vibha here.
We were just informed that...

776
01:58:06,279 --> 01:58:09,737
Bal Raj's son is no more.
We are going there.

777
01:58:11,284 --> 01:58:14,913
How?
- Accident. Dharam told us.

778
01:58:16,155 --> 01:58:17,816
I'll hang up.

779
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:51,642
Recognise the voice?

780
02:00:52,945 --> 02:00:55,607
It is the one whom you
tried to bump off.

781
02:00:56,449 --> 02:01:00,351
Bastard! You stooped down to killing,
when you couldn't win over business?

782
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:03,555
What do you think?
The matter is settled?

783
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:08,421
You've killed an innocent.
I'll avenge Sunil!

784
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:10,729
You won't stay alive!

785
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:15,726
Now you'll see your end.

786
02:01:19,005 --> 02:01:21,439
Even others can use such methods.

787
02:02:00,446 --> 02:02:02,004
Shall we call Parikshit back?

788
02:02:24,203 --> 02:02:26,899
The Commercial bank's manager
Mr Bhatia wants to speak to you.

789
02:02:30,343 --> 02:02:31,708
How are you?

790
02:02:33,546 --> 02:02:35,571
How are you?
- Very well, by your grace.

791
02:02:36,482 --> 02:02:39,747
I hear, Karan Singh is resigning.
- Perhaps.

792
02:02:40,686 --> 02:02:44,679
Don't let that happen.
You'll lose hold in market.

793
02:02:45,324 --> 02:02:47,519
It could affect the
Overdraft facilities, too.

794
02:02:49,428 --> 02:02:51,328
I'll see you. Okay.

795
02:03:00,306 --> 02:03:03,036
The company accepts your resignation.

796
02:03:08,447 --> 02:03:13,714
I couldn't pen down something
in the resignation.

797
02:03:14,587 --> 02:03:16,214
I don't want to hear it.

798
02:03:21,594 --> 02:03:24,563
What I am today, is due to...
- Move!

799
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:27,889
Move out of here! Go away!

800
02:03:30,469 --> 02:03:37,375
What is happening, has to be stopped.
Hear me out, Dhan Raj...

801
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:39,578
Nothing's left to be heard.

802
02:03:41,647 --> 02:03:47,381
The one whom I laid my trust since
childhood, has today betrayed me.

803
02:03:49,622 --> 02:03:53,888
But why? Wouldrt you like
to know the reason why?

804
02:03:55,828 --> 02:03:58,262
Answer me, Dhan Raj.
- Mr Dhan Raj!

805
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:12,960
How about breakfast?

806
02:05:15,708 --> 02:05:20,805
Are you all right? You haven't been
to office for quite some time now.

807
02:05:23,582 --> 02:05:25,675
Leave the office affairs to me.

808
02:05:56,749 --> 02:06:00,241
Dia, Keya, come here.
Were you playing?

809
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:12,030
Call from the bank.

810
02:06:24,944 --> 02:06:25,933
One minute.

811
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:40,548
Your last three projects are to be
questioned in Parliament.

812
02:06:40,793 --> 02:06:44,229
I'm under pressure.
Forget about the overdrafts.

813
02:06:44,396 --> 02:06:47,763
Try to avoid invoking guarantee.
- What are you talking?

814
02:06:48,567 --> 02:06:50,432
Has a personal guarantee
ever been invoked?

815
02:06:50,803 --> 02:06:53,966
Don't you have any other work?
- I'm helpless.

816
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:56,107
The matter has run out of my hands.

817
02:07:16,629 --> 02:07:17,789
Karan here.

818
02:07:19,498 --> 02:07:23,059
I want to talk to you.
It's important. Shall I come home?

819
02:07:23,268 --> 02:07:24,462
No need to.

820
02:07:27,606 --> 02:07:31,474
Don't be childish.
I can save the company.

821
02:07:31,677 --> 02:07:34,145
Don't you forget what you are?
- Bharat will listen to me...

822
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:46,820
What is it that you can't
spell it out to me?

823
02:07:49,862 --> 02:07:54,822
You didn't attend Sunil's funeral;
not even his last rites.

824
02:07:56,035 --> 02:07:58,265
Karan resigned.
But you never told me.

825
02:08:04,777 --> 02:08:07,143
You've never raised your voice
against me.

826
02:08:08,881 --> 02:08:11,076
And now, you get worked up
on everything.

827
02:08:12,751 --> 02:08:14,514
What is the matter, Dhan Raj.

828
02:08:18,657 --> 02:08:20,124
Tell me.

829
02:08:42,781 --> 02:08:45,682
Sahib, I'm hungry.

830
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:54,489
Sahib, I'm hungry.
Very hungry, sahib.

831
02:08:54,993 --> 02:08:56,221
Move it!

832
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:16,160
I agree that I was brought up well
enough. But by a maid, not a mother.

833
02:11:20,372 --> 02:11:23,034
But son, you have lived it up.
- My foot!

834
02:11:23,208 --> 02:11:25,699
All that I conceived and worked out,
was unethical.

835
02:11:25,944 --> 02:11:30,278
I tried to save a life, and earned
a title of traitor from Dhan Raj.

836
02:11:30,883 --> 02:11:34,148
And now. Now Bharat is bent
on killing me.

837
02:11:35,487 --> 02:11:38,854
What if we uncover the truth?

838
02:11:39,091 --> 02:11:43,528
Bharat will be bent on
killing Dhan Raj. Truth!

839
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:47,298
You've made my life miserable
by uncovering the truth.

840
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:51,001
Bharat's life was saved by that.
- Not Sunil's.

841
02:11:51,203 --> 02:11:54,639
Even the poor worker lost
his life in that strike.

842
02:11:55,107 --> 02:11:57,075
Who is responsible for that?

843
02:11:58,277 --> 02:11:59,335
Not me.

844
02:12:00,379 --> 02:12:04,748
Grandpa, whatever and
whenever it happened...

845
02:12:05,050 --> 02:12:06,483
I'm not responsible.

846
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:11,311
I'm not even responsible
for my own existence.

847
02:12:12,324 --> 02:12:14,292
Go away, Karan.
- No grandpa.

848
02:12:15,027 --> 02:12:18,758
My responsibility lies with you.
- I'm not God.

849
02:12:20,065 --> 02:12:25,367
What you are and what you want to do,
you decide. Take your own decisions.

850
02:12:28,807 --> 02:12:31,674
How about suicide?
- Go away, Karan.

851
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:36,347
Tell me. Shall I commit suicide?
- Who is stopping you?

852
02:12:37,082 --> 02:12:42,110
And what good is suicide?
Karan, if one has reasons to die...

853
02:12:42,287 --> 02:12:45,916
he does have reasons to live, too.

854
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:56,330
Son, build a relationship with life.
- With whose life?

855
02:13:09,915 --> 02:13:11,143
I'll try.

856
02:15:54,779 --> 02:15:56,576
I need to speak to the three of you.

857
02:16:18,303 --> 02:16:20,328
I need to speak to my sons.

858
02:17:16,127 --> 02:17:17,788
Karan was murdered.

859
02:17:24,269 --> 02:17:29,605
He was my son.
He was your elder brother.

860
02:17:36,848 --> 02:17:38,873
Slut!

861
02:18:00,305 --> 02:18:01,897
Control yourself, Bharat.

862
02:18:16,421 --> 02:18:17,445
Mother!

863
02:19:07,038 --> 02:19:08,733
One in Hindi, dear.

864
02:19:10,375 --> 02:19:16,507
Mera ghoda naache khude... tera ghoda phoos.

865
02:19:20,552 --> 02:19:22,816
Devki, how did Karan die?

866
02:19:24,756 --> 02:19:30,786
Did someone kill him?
- Forget it, dad. Past is past.

867
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:38,929
This watch on your ring-finger,
I remember it since I was a kid.

868
02:19:43,341 --> 02:19:45,036
Everything will settle down, mother.

869
02:19:53,351 --> 02:19:56,115
Vibha, take the kids to bed.

870
02:20:00,325 --> 02:20:04,728
I'm feeling drowsy.
And I have to wake up early.

871
02:21:30,482 --> 02:21:32,450
In your house.

872
02:21:36,521 --> 02:21:38,989
We are relieved of all miseries.

873
02:21:43,828 --> 02:21:48,856
The Home in Dev Prayag suits me.
- Why waste time then?

874
02:21:52,337 --> 02:21:54,328
Dharam too has had
enough of business.

875
02:21:55,540 --> 02:21:57,667
He will visit us some times.

876
02:21:57,842 --> 02:22:00,470
What about Vibha?
- Grandpa is here.

877
02:22:01,312 --> 02:22:05,248
Kiran, Supriya and Subhadra
are at home. Don't worry about her.

878
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:11,484
We must spare a little thought
for our salvation, too.

879
02:22:58,536 --> 02:23:00,003
Take the glass away.

880
02:23:18,723 --> 02:23:20,418
Shut the door behind you.

881
02:24:14,646 --> 02:24:15,977
Do not weep.

882
02:24:20,785 --> 02:24:22,116
I'm with you.

883
02:24:27,859 --> 02:24:29,827
I'll take care of you.

884
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:11,430
Uncle, where is Dev Prayag Ashram?

885
02:25:13,771 --> 02:25:15,363
Far away in the Himalayas.

886
02:25:18,910 --> 02:25:22,402
Is Daddy going too?
- Some times.

887
02:25:27,018 --> 02:25:31,148
How is mummy?
- She is fine.

888
02:25:33,925 --> 02:25:36,155
Uncle, will they send me back again?

889
02:25:40,798 --> 02:25:43,892
No dear. You are the only one now.

890
02:25:44,936 --> 02:25:50,374
You'll have to take care
of everything. Will you?
