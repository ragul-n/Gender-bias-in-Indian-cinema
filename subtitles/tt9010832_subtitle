1
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,583
Which is that incarnation?

2
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,833
This deity, invoked with all 
the fury of incarnations,

3
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,583
Has been named now as Narasimham.

4
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,666
Look there!

5
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,583
(chants going on)

6
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,625
He went to the theatre by himself!

7
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,666
Still a baby, but he wants 
to watch the movie.

8
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,250
Get inside!

9
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,708
Missing his school, you idiot.

10
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,250
Get inside, such an arrogant boy!

11
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,583
I was not worried about getting beaten.

12
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:45,166
Watching Lalettan's movie Narashimham 
the very first day, first show

13
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,750
in the theatre gives a great pleasure!

14
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,708
So, that’s your love story.

15
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,375
Still Ram, it’s been 7 years 
after that, right?

16
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
These days, after a break-up,

17
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,666
maximum 2 to 6 months,

18
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:40,000
Then people forget it and 
get new relationships.

19
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,333
99% of boys,

20
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,208
But you are quite different.

21
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,291
Saira, what you said is true.

22
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,541
But some moments in life,

23
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,333
Whether good or bad,

24
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,875
It will take some time to 
fade from our memories.

25
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,666
A longer time.

26
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,583
Cut it!

27
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,208
Very good, Aswin!

28
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,208
Very good.

29
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,208
Ok, let’s take a break.

30
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,416
It’s after the break, right?

31
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,416
Hi, let’s sit over there.

32
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,416
I read the whole script.

33
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,666
It’s good.

34
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,458
Thank you, sir.

35
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,208
I am happy about one of my assistants 
making a movie independently.

36
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,541
But you should be brave enough for that.

37
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,666
I saw that bravery in this script.

38
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,666
I feel tensed as it is my first movie.

39
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,666
You should feel tensed.

40
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,333
Not just for the first movie,

41
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,166
For all the movies you make, 
you should feel tensed.

42
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,000
Because, film making is a serious profession.

43
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,458
Do you know what are the most important 
factors in a film maker’s life?

44
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,958
Confidence, hard work and luck.

45
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,333
The first two are depending on us.

46
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,666
And the third on God.

47
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,666
Then, there is a producer behind you, 
who invests crores believing in you.

48
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,833
I understand Sir.

49
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:57,666
I am not in a hurry.

50
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,666
I will start the shoot only after 
proper planning of the pre-production.

51
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,583
Very good.

52
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,166
How’s the work going on?

53
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,458
The music work is going on now.

54
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,625
Who’s doing the music?

55
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,666
A newcomer named Ranjan.

56
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,166
He had done the music for Joseph.

57
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,958
Most of the people are newcomers.

58
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,375
That’s good.

59
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,833
New people, new thoughts…

60
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,708
This will be excellent,

61
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,333
I am sure.

62
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,166
So, all the very best.

63
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,458
- Thank you, sir. 
- Ok.

64
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,875
Move this aside.

65
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,166
- Good morning, Sir. 
- Good morning.

66
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,208
Where is the producer?

67
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,750
- He’s not reached yet? 
- He’s on the way.

68
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,000
Where have you been?

69
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,375
I had told you that I would pick you.

70
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,625
And you said you had some urgent work.

71
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,666
I went to meet Jithu sir.

72
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,916
Oh, that’s nice.

73
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:01,958
Good morning.

74
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,791
Hi Nithin, Come.

75
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:06,875
- Hi Ranjan, 
- Hi.

76
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,458
What’s the confusion about singer?

77
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,708
The song is nice.

78
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,166
But we are confused 
whether we should try a new voice.

79
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,625
Because our risk will be reduced, 
if it’s an experienced singer.

80
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,875
Better than an old usual voice,

81
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,166
A fresh voice is better than 
an old and over-used voice,

82
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,916
Overall there would be a freshness.

83
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,166
That’s right.

84
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,625
If so, there is a voice that 
I have filtered from the mails I received.

85
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,000
- You please listen to that. 
- Ok.

86
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:55,750
"Somebody is gently caressing my heart"

87
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,000
Who is the singer?

88
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,333
One Varsha from Cochin.

89
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,166
What happened? Do you know her?

90
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,375
Hey!

91
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,833
Do you like rain?

92
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,458
You got anything to tell me?

93
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,250
Hey,

94
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:11,208
Hey dude, she is not the only one 
in this world with the name Varsha.

95
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,916
It is not her.

96
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,375
It’s her dude.

97
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:48,166
"An Autumn in Memories"

98
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,250
Subeesh!

99
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,666
What’s it?

100
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,500
Got it.

101
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,833
I have printed it, take it.

102
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,333
Here!

103
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,416
A+, B+, C, D… 
For you?

104
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,708
C, D, C… I only have these.

105
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,625
(Screaming)

106
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,958
I will kill you.

107
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,750
Where can you get admission 
with these marks?

108
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:44,791
I don’t know.

109
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,416
Dad, I can get for Humanities easily.

110
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,166
What? Humanities?

111
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,666
After that what will you do?

112
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,250
Dear, he wants to make movies 
after 12th grade.

113
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,625
What? Movie making?

114
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,166
And then roam around jobless.

115
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,375
You must study computer science 
for 12th grade.

116
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,458
I will arrange for your engineering admission.

117
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,458
Do you understand?

118
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:02,958
Mom!

119
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,250
Humanities…. Useless….

120
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,166
What are you doing, dear?

121
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,375
What’s the problem?

122
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,833
If you put all the manure 
together for that coconut tree,

123
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,166
Won’t it wither away?

124
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,666
It won’t wither.

125
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,916
I have been doing coconut business 
for 10 years.

126
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,583
I know how much manure I should put.

127
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,291
Stop all your games after this week.

128
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I have arranged your admission to 
Thokkanangadi School for 12th grade,

129
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,666
for computer science.

130
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,666
Study well and become an engineer.

131
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:31,541
Do you hear me?

132
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,500
What are you saying?

133
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,291
Teacher!

134
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:10,875
What’s this Varsha?

135
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,833
Is it how you come to a classroom?

136
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,708
You are all wet, Go outside.

137
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,000
You may come inside after drying your clothes.

138
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,583
All of you note down 
the derivation of the problem written on the board

139
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,166
Do you like rain?

140
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,875
What?

141
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,166
You are all wet.

142
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,625
I… I just got wet.

143
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,916
It’s fun to get wet in the rain.

144
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,166
Any amount of rain is not enough for me.

145
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,833
What’s your name?

146
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,458
Nithin Mohan.

147
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,375
What’s your name?

148
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:07,875
Varsha.

149
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,541
Oh, Varsha.

150
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,875
Hello, sit here.

151
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,666
What’s your name?

152
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,375
Nithin.

153
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,666
I’m Jithin.

154
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,375
I will be back in a moment.

155
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:43,958
- Are you studious? 
- No.

156
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,375
Dude, you know the guys 
sitting on the first two rows,

157
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,875
Are very studious.

158
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,583
Our lives will be wasted if we sit them.

159
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,375
Let’s do one thing,

160
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,750
Let’s sit in the back.

161
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,375
Come on dude.

162
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,958
Look at these two guys.

163
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:00,875
Move man!

164
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,250
Sorry.

165
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,666
Riyas,

166
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:05,666
Nithin,

167
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,000
This is Robin.

168
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,625
He wants to be a priest after 12th grade.

169
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,666
- Let’s wait and see. 
- Dude.

170
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,666
Nothing like that.

171
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:17,291
If I’m not spoilt after 12th grade, 
then I might try to become a priest.

172
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,416
Just that.

173
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,166
This is Abhi.

174
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,166
- Hi 
- Hello.

175
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:23,875
What happened to your arm?

176
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,666
I fell off the bicycle.

177
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,708
When the school opened, 
he had plaster on his leg,

178
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,666
And now it’s on his arm.

179
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,708
So, we have given him a name, Odiyan.

180
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,583
Riyas, if you tell my name to everyone,

181
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,458
I will also give you a weird name 
and tell everyone about it.

182
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,208
You can do that, I don’t care.

183
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,666
Can’t you stop that yet?

184
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,666
To woo girls?

185
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,333
Leave it.

186
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,666
You may woo any girl,

187
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,666
Did you see that girl?

188
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,291
Who?

189
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,375
With a white hijab.

190
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,291
Don’t try to woo her, ok?

191
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,958
- Why so? 
- She is for me.

192
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,625
- What’s her name? 
- Rehna.

193
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,375
She looks very proud.

194
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,791
That I will manage.

195
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:26,791
Then it’s fine.

196
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:32,583
(humming a song)

197
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,375
Here!

198
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,666
Dear bro, I asked you to 
stitch boot cut trousers,

199
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,291
This looks like a tube.

200
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,375
Yesterday your father had come 
after you left.

201
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,583
Do you know what he said?

202
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,166
No need to make it fashionable.

203
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,625
Just to stitch it in the usual way.

204
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,166
What can I do?

205
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,708
I had enough of my dad.

206
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,416
Shall I bring a new cloth?

207
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,375
Will you stitch boot cut trousers?

208
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,458
I can do it.

209
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,708
But will your father let you?

210
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,666
I don’t think so.

211
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,750
He won’t let you.

212
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,375
I won’t tell my dad about it.

213
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,458
Then it’s fine.

214
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,250
I will take this one.

215
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:09,958
You take it.

216
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,000
I had told you not to 
put all the manure together.

217
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,750
Mistakes happens to everyone.

218
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,416
The manure is not good enough.

219
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,833
Now you are blaming the manure.

220
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,875
You may leave.

221
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,541
See your father’s coconut tree.

222
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,000
What a beautiful sight, isn’t it, Mom?

223
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,416
Don’t you have anything to study?

224
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,958
Dad, today was my first day in the school.

225
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,916
So what? Are you not allowed to study today?

226
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,375
Dear, I have kept tea and snacks on the table.

227
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,916
Eat it. Go.

228
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,000
I will tell you one thing.

229
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,166
The children are also like that coconut tree.

230
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,000
If you feed them too much, 
they will also wither away.

231
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,000
Do you understand?

232
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,333
No, I don’t.

233
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,375
You don’t have to.

234
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,833
Go and try to get the Best Farmer Award.

235
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,125
This man!

236
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,458
Dear, you remember that trouser 
we bought for him last week?

237
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,833
He doesn’t like it.

238
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,791
He says it’s old fashioned.

239
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,916
There’s a new style trouser…

240
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,333
- What’s that? 
- Boot cut.

241
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,125
Yes, he says he wants the boot cut trousers.

242
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,833
Do you know about fashion?

243
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:23,791
There he starts…

244
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,000
Fashion keeps changing through time.

245
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:31,416
This decent dressing, gentle dressing,

246
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,708
That remains without change all the time.

247
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,833
You will be shocked if you see 
what people do in the name of fashion.

248
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,125
This boot cut, short cut, what else,

249
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,666
with long side-whiskers,

250
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,833
growing long hair like the guy 
in Anniyan movie,

251
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,708
What are you thinking?

252
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:54,416
There is a small black and white 
photo inside my suitcase.

253
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,916
The guy in that photo looks 
around 20 years old.

254
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,750
He has a nest-like hairstyle,

255
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:03,875
with a moustache which goes like 
this below the lips,

256
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,541
the side-whiskers and a bulgan beard,

257
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,000
He’s wearing a chequered shirt 
with long collars,

258
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,541
And a belt, you should see that belt,

259
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,333
And the trousers with flare of 30 cm.

260
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,541
Enough of your blabbering, 
bring the chutney.

261
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,333
That I will bring.

262
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,708
Who’s that crazy guy, mom?

263
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,666
Don’t call him crazy, dear son.

264
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,833
He’s your close acquaintance.

265
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,000
Now, isn’t the boot cut fine for you?

266
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,833
Ok, ok.

267
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:36,875
Don’t you agree?

268
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,375
Dad has agreed,

269
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,791
I will give you the money for 
stitching boot cut.

270
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:52,833
Hi Latha sister,

271
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,000
Hi Jalaja, didn’t see you for a long time.

272
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,625
Don’t you come to the temple these days?

273
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,125
Goddess is most important to us.

274
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,125
Now Varsha has got a lot to study.

275
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,000
She is in 11th grade.

276
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,125
- Varsha got full A+ in 10th grade, right? 
- Yes.

277
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:08,000
She used to study in Pushkaran’s 
tuition centre, didn’t she?

278
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,375
That we sent her just for a confidence.

279
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Now, the school requested us to 
admit her in the 11th grade.

280
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,458
She would become a great doctor 
in future, won’t she?

281
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,666
No, she is not interested in that.

282
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,750
She wants to become a Scientist,

283
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,333
In rocket science.

284
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,125
Like our President Kalam.

285
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:29,083
Pushkaran Sir says she’s smart enough 
to become the President of India.

286
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,541
You know Pushkaran Sir?

287
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,791
Hey, the temple will close soon.

288
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:34,625
Ok then.

289
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:35,583
Bye sister.

290
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,000
Will tell you the rest when we meet 
for the Ayalkootam meeting.

291
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,375
Bye.

292
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:40,875
Hope the temple is not closed.

293
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,416
If you shut your mouth, 
we can pray before it is closed.

294
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,125
He won’t even let me talk to anyone.

295
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,333
What a behaviour!

296
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,416
She started in the morning itself.

297
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,000
Varsha, I am telling you,

298
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,083
One day I will throw everything away.

299
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,458
She’s doing this during study time.

300
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,583
I don’t care.

301
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,625
You wait and see, 
A fish lover….

302
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:12,750
- Dear, 
- What?

303
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,541
Children would have some craze 
for these things.

304
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,000
- So what? 
- We should encourage them.

305
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,125
Dad, Mom would be happy 
if I keep studying for 24 hours.

306
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:23,583
Your Mom boasts to people that 
you will become the President of India.

307
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh god!

308
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,000
Ok, now all the blame is on me.

309
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,333
There comes a dad and daughter.

310
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,833
- Dear, 
- Yes.

311
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:39,750
Sunny had told me that some new breeds 
of fish are available in the town.

312
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:40,541
Really?

313
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,000
Should I buy them, or will you go?

314
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:43,833
No need dad,

315
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,833
I will go and buy on Saturday or Sunday.

316
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,333
That’s better.

317
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,000
Then, look here.

318
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,500
Don’t tell mom that I’m going there.

319
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,166
You know her behaviour.

320
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,666
Oh, if she comes to know about it, 
she would start fighting.

321
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:04,083
Yesterday we studied about vaporisation.

322
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:10,416
Today we will discuss about 
the topic boiling point.

323
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,666
I had asked you to study yesterday’s part.

324
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,583
Hey!

325
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,000
So, what is vaporisation?

326
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:22,833
I don’t know.

327
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,000
Rajesh? You answer me.

328
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,333
Dude, he is trapped.

329
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,833
Sir, I didn’t study.

330
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:28,833
You don’t know.

331
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,416
Who is sitting with head down?

332
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:36,541
What’s your name?

333
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:38,166
Nithin.

334
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,583
Ok, Nithin answer me.

335
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,375
What is va…..?

336
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,000
I asked him.

337
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,166
Let him answer it.

338
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,625
Don’t be over smart.

339
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,375
What is vaporisation?

340
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:50,833
Tell me.

341
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:52,875
You don’t know.

342
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:53,875
Then you say the answer,

343
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:54,833
Dude, say you don’t know.

344
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,458
…which an element is converted from a solid 
or liquid to a gas is called vaporisation.

345
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:00,583
Correct, very good.

346
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:04,375
Both of you deserve a cane treatment.

347
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,416
Say you were absent in last class

348
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,583
Rajesh, show your hand,

349
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:14,833
Stretch your hand!

350
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,541
Jesus!

351
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:22,083
Should I tell you again?

352
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,416
Stretch your hand!

353
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,666
Sir,

354
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,833
Nithin was not present in the last class.

355
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,166
He joined this Monday only.

356
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,625
- Is it? 
- Yes.

357
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,583
You could have told me that?

358
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,541
Before you come for the next class,

359
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,791
Learn `what is vaporisation`.

360
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,416
Everyone, take your text books,

361
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,541
And go to the chapter boiling point, 
page number 43.

362
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:54,458
Thanks.

363
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,458
Hey Odiya!

364
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,833
Isn’t it time for you to put 
the next plaster?

365
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,416
We, friends may call him by many names.

366
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:06,916
But you don’t call him like that.

367
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,000
Now you called him like that.

368
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,333
If you repeat it,

369
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,000
You will also get a crazy name,

370
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,833
And we will make it famous in this college.

371
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,416
By putting posters everywhere, ok?

372
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:16,916
I shouldn’t have called like that.

373
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,166
Do you care about me that much?

374
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:26,666
If one of us have an issue, 
that’s for all of us, isn’t it?

375
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,000
Come on give hand

376
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,750
"They gave me their hearts"

377
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,750
"And stood by me"

378
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,541
"They are coming smartly"

379
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:03,750
"These friends are like my heart beat"

380
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,625
"They come, giving me life"

381
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:11,541
"They can bring mountains tied with rope"

382
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,625
"Stand with me strongly"

383
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,541
"They can demolish bastions of 
forts like an egg"

384
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,750
"After the battle, if we stand together"

385
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,333
"Then it is celebration"

386
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,041
Principal...Principal!

387
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,916
The World ends here, Pal!

388
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,541
Sir, I am blind

389
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,416
-Come dude - Yes Yes

390
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,083
"Eyes are two, eyes are two"

391
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,125
"You are one of those two"

392
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,125
"I gave you half of my heart,"

393
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,083
"Keeping aside the other girl"

394
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,333
"If the heart is good, 
no need of a mirror"

395
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,083
"To sleep, even a pestle 
will do for a bed"

396
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,083
"We behaved badly, jumped over steps"

397
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,375
"And showed cunningness in many ways"

398
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,875
"To lock us by teacher’s words"

399
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:16,083
"We are not dolls with key"

400
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,875
"There is no peace even at home"

401
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:24,083
"We must hear scolding like thunder"

402
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:29,125
"Why should we obey others"

403
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,833
"When we can think for ourselves"

404
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,083
"We are not small children"

405
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,083
"We are self sufficient"

406
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:41,000
"We must fight and advance"

407
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,958
"We have come, we have come"

408
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,083
"Hereafter we are all one"

409
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,875
"Without a bit of naughtiness"

410
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:32,000
"What is the use of life?"

411
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:36,875
"We’ll build a nest with a 
lot of dreams"

412
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,125
"And travel around merrily"

413
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,000
"Without standing bewildered,"

414
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,083
"Or rotating like a top,"

415
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:48,500
"We must lead and reach in front."

416
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,333
"Without being stunned,"

417
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,333
"Bravely expanding our chests"

418
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,833
"We must win"

419
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,958
"We have come, we have come"

420
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,916
"Hereafter we are all one"

421
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,750
Move..Move..Is it over?

422
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,000
Dude, you’ve been wooing 
that Varsha for a long time.

423
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,166
Will anything work out?

424
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:56,791
There he starts again with his wooing.

425
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:58,833
Dude, she’s one of the 
smartest girls in the class,

426
00:32:58,958 --> 00:32:59,750
And keeping good company with us.

427
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:00,750
That’s it.

428
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:06,833
Dude, but seeing the expressions that 
you have on your face when you see her,

429
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,000
We don’t feel like that.

430
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,083
Dude Nithin, what he is saying is true?

431
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,583
There is nothing like that.

432
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,583
He’s just joking.

433
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:14,625
What is not there?

434
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,875
Nothing is there.

435
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,333
Still, isn’t there a little bit…

436
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:18,416
That…

437
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,125
See, this Riyas won’t say 
anything thoughtlessly.

438
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,833
Something is there.

439
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,458
I don’t know if it’s love.

440
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,750
But something….

441
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,000
Something?

442
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,166
I don’t know.

443
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:30,541
You don’t know.

444
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,458
To understand that, 
you should have love within you.

445
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:33,708
I already have that.

446
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,708
For you to understand that,

447
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,000
- I will do a memory test, 
- What’s that?

448
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,125
Close your eyes.

449
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,416
Close your eyes, dude.

450
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:43,416
Believe me.

451
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,375
Can’t I open?

452
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:45,500
No, you can’t.

453
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:55,750
Now, fill your mind with her face.

454
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,500
Yes, I did.

455
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,833
Dear, when you want her 
to look at you, she looks.

456
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:17,541
Then, do you feel a fire ball going up 
from your stomach to your chest?

457
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,541
Yes, I do.

458
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:23,125
Do you feel like talking to her 
all the time?

459
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,833
Yes, I do, I do.

460
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:28,916
That’s enough.

461
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:29,958
Now you can open your eyes.

462
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,875
Do you understand your feelings 
for her now?

463
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,791
You are in love with her,

464
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,333
Go and tell her before it cools down.

465
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,875
If you were this smart,

466
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,333
why didn’t you tell Resna about your love?

467
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,833
Not Resna, it’s Rehna.

468
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,333
Why didn’t you tell Rehna?

469
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,083
I will tell her.

470
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,083
When my love for her fills my heart,

471
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,625
I will tell her.

472
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:53,000
Rehna, my sweetheart, I’m coming for you.

473
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:55,875
Come!

474
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:01,541
Feels like a festival is going on.

475
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,375
Go man!

476
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:05,875
He will set everything today.

477
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:13,333
Hey, do you put cardamom in dumplings?

478
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,125
You know these dumplings?

479
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,458
That…

480
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,000
If you don’t know, it’s fine.

481
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,458
I will ask someone else.

482
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:22,458
It’s ok.

483
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,333
Juniors!

484
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,750
Hello Juniors!

485
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,583
What’s up?

486
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,916
Why are they here?

487
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,833
It’s fun to wash hands in a crowd.

488
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,541
Dude Nithin, be careful.

489
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,666
He has an eye on Varsha. That’s sure

490
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:41,833
Look there.

491
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,083
Varsha, did you come to wash your hand?

492
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:45,375
Have you finished eating?

493
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,125
You have a nice lunch box, with clips.

494
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,541
Mine is a round one.

495
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,541
I have to hit it on the wall to open.

496
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,125
This one is easy to open.

497
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,333
Varshu, didn’t you go to temple today?

498
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,750
Varshu?

499
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,833
Yes. Varshu. Varsha.

500
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:57,875
That sounds great.

501
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,583
Varshu!!!!

502
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,916
- War shoe? 
- Hell…

503
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,750
I will buy you a pen for the Onam Exam.

504
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,500
A pen worshipped in the temple 
for seven days.

505
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,916
Then your exams will be easy.

506
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,916
Then she doesn’t have 
to write the exams, right?

507
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:13,750
A little bit.

508
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,833
God helps those who help themselves.

509
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,875
Then, if you have god’s help,

510
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,000
You don’t have to study, right?

511
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,083
Joke.

512
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,500
Where’s he going to?

513
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,625
Varsha….

514
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:26,666
Who are you?

515
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,541
Varsha, Sreekala teacher is 
looking for you.

516
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,000
- Go fast. 
- Come.

517
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:31,750
Are you going?

518
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,666
No, she won’t.

519
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,166
Bro, they are our classmates.

520
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,750
Leave them.

521
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:42,916
You are smart.

522
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:44,875
Come here.

523
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:45,958
Please don’t insult me.

524
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,875
What you did is good.

525
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,958
This is how classmates should be.

526
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,166
Very good.

527
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:55,625
Do you have fever?

528
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,833
Your face looks tired.

529
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:00,333
I have a herbal medicine with me.

530
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,833
I will bring it in the afternoon.

531
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,000
If that guy hadn’t come there,

532
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,750
I would have set everything.

533
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,958
Else he would be singing romantic 
songs by now.

534
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,166
Get lost man.

535
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,583
Dude, listen to me.

536
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:14,666
I have an idea.

537
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,416
Shall we give her a letter.

538
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:18,541
Letter?

539
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,833
Love letter.

540
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,083
That’s a good idea.

541
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,708
You can write whatever is 
in your mind.

542
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,875
Are you all studying well?

543
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,500
Yes, isn’t it, dude?

544
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,166
What man?

545
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,166
- Ramani! 
- Yes.

546
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,791
His friends have come.

547
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,833
Yes, they came for combine study.

548
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,083
So, he has the company of good children now.

549
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:55,666
Don’t go to his room often to disturb them.

550
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:56,541
Let them study.

551
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,750
I won’t go.

552
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,000
You please deshell this coconut.

553
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:00,125
Let me cook something,

554
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:01,333
I have to feed the children.

555
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:02,166
Move please.

556
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,583
Dude. She’s here.

557
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,166
- Where is he? 
- Where did he go?

558
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,166
There he comes.

559
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:19,000
It’s very hot.

560
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,833
Tell me, did you write?

561
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,125
Let me see

562
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,166
- Is it Arabic? 
- Yes.

563
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,125
How will she understand it?

564
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:36,000
She knows Arabic very well.

565
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,833
She comes first in the madrasa.

566
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,333
Even if anyone else see this letter,

567
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,791
They won’t understand.

568
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,000
I haven’t even written my or 
her name in this.

569
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,500
So, this letter is safe.

570
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,625
Then, give this letter to her.

571
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,833
- Will give it later. 
- Go man!

572
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,541
Although I prepared well for the exam, 
I still have some tension

573
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:00,333
Tell her!

574
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:03,833
Hey!

575
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,125
What?

576
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,041
I like you Rehna, I love you.

577
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,458
What’s this? Love letter?

578
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:30,750
Riyas,

579
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,416
I am already in a relationship.

580
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,083
Not just that, we don’t make a good pair.

581
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:40,083
People will laugh at us 
if they hear about our love.

582
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:44,541
All the boys have this kind of 
sickness towards beautiful girls.

583
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,541
Aren’t you ashamed to say that to me?

584
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,666
Don’t you have any common sense?

585
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:52,750
Riyas, you don’t worry.

586
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:57,333
Find a girl who matches you 
and love her.

587
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:58,791
Come dear.

588
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,916
I will start laughing if stand here any more

589
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,041
You shouldn’t have said like that.

590
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,125
He deserves more!

591
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:07,750
Hey!

592
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:11,875
Do you see your face in the mirror?

593
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,750
Do you?

594
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,583
Who do you think you are?

595
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,333
Rani Mukherji or Aishwarya Rai?

596
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,666
Kavya Madhavan or Navya Nair?

597
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,125
There are many beautiful girls 
in this school.

598
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,500
But this stupid guy loves only you.

599
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:26,541
If you like him, say yes,

600
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,750
if not say no.

601
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:28,958
Don’t try to boss.

602
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,875
We, boys are not fools.

603
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:32,416
Come dude.

604
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:35,916
Let’s go.

605
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:39,458
Didn’t you have enough?

606
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,125
His Arabic….

607
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:43,541
Dude…

608
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,333
I like that boy.

609
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,708
Super dialogue.

610
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:54,750
What he said is true.

611
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,708
There are some people here also 
who deserve this kind of dialogue.

612
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,333
Will she report it to the Principal?

613
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,791
No, she won’t.

614
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,416
I have stopped her from that.

615
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,875
Even if she does, 
it’s a shame for herself.

616
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:12,000
Next time when I come to school,

617
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,166
- I want to meet Nithin. 
- Ok.

618
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,458
Haven’t you finished eating?

619
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,708
Go and study.

620
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,125
There she starts again.

621
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,666
This is not proper.

622
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,083
She is a big girl now.

623
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,833
When she talks about romance,

624
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,625
Why are you encouraging her?

625
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,833
Shouldn’t you stop her 
from interfering in that?

626
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,833
Not just mothers, fathers should also be 
cautious about grown up daughters.

627
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:40,750
One incident happened in the classroom.

628
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:46,458
How many children of her age would 
share this with their parents?

629
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:52,708
When a girl is confident enough 
to share everything to her parents,

630
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:54,916
She would never be spoilt.

631
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,125
I know my daughter very well.

632
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,666
Fine, fine.

633
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:02,666
- Hello 
- Tell me dude.

634
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,333
There’s nothing to worry as we thought.

635
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,208
I thought Rehna would complain about us.

636
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,083
Dude, it’s Varsha who stopped her.

637
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:13,500
She had told me in school itself 
that it won’t be an issue.

638
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,125
That’s great.

639
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,916
Anyways, I lost my love.

640
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,708
Let’s do one thing, let’s set your love.

641
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:19,875
You come fast.

642
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:22,416
Over, over.

643
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,166
Ok dude, over.

644
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:28,416
CID Naseer…

645
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,291
What?

646
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,416
I was saying that the movie CID Naseer is 
there in Asianet channel, this morning at 10.

647
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:41,208
Dude, most of the famous people 
in this world have failed many times.

648
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,458
- Don’t you know? 
- For 12th grade?

649
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,166
Riyas,

650
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,291
My dear Odiyan…

651
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,250
Riyas,

652
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:46,375
Please call him.

653
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,833
- Me? 
- One minute.

654
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,333
What’s the matter?

655
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,666
It’s there, not here.

656
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:57,666
- What? 
- Let’s go there.

657
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,166
What’s it, man?

658
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,166
Hey, would he have given 
any Arabic letter to her?

659
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,958
Looks like it’s Urdu.

660
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,250
Will it be the question paper for 
our next exam?

661
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,333
There is a chance for that.

662
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,291
What’s that?

663
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,250
What dude?

664
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,458
- She says she likes me. 
- What’s it?

665
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,125
- Arabic? 
- Yes.

666
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,208
Then what did you tell her?

667
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,166
That I also like her.

668
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,500
Sunny dear,

669
00:43:54,083 --> 00:44:06,333
(singing movie song)

670
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:10,791
Dude Princi..

671
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,666
No dude, it’s Tiger Chacko.

672
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,291
Do you think it is right 
for only you to sing and have fun?

673
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,208
Like the boys, girls also have 
the right to sing and enjoy.

674
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:28,833
Boys have done their performance.

675
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:34,250
Now, who among you is going 
to sing a beautiful song?

676
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,291
Varsha sings well.

677
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:39,666
Ok, please sing for us.

678
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:48,250
-Sing well, okay - Okay

679
00:44:54,958 --> 00:45:06,458
"Somebody is gently caressing my heart"

680
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:19,666
"Is it the breeze, rain or sunlight" 
"Resting under the “Vaaka” tree?"

681
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:34,000
"Unable to speak out, 
sweet honey rains endlessly in my heart"

682
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:40,666
"Unknowingly, I hear at the door of my soul"

683
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:46,791
"A footstep regularly"

684
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:54,458
"Is it a dream, is it a story"

685
00:45:54,791 --> 00:46:00,250
"Or just a feeling"

686
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:08,000
"Did love bloom?"

687
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:14,958
"I did not know anything"

688
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,666
Very good

689
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,208
Our school youth festival will be 
conducted on 16th of this month.

690
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,166
One of the main events will be 
Varsha’s song.

691
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,291
Thank you, sir.

692
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,666
-It was nice. - Thanks

693
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,083
All the best for your exams

694
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,083
Thank you, sir.

695
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,166
What’s his problem?

696
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:54,333
Check quickly dude.

697
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:55,500
I don’t see anyone.

698
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,791
Better if they don’t see us.

699
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,875
Would she have gone to temple?

700
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,333
What are you doing?

701
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,458
Please check secretly.

702
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,125
I am not peeking into someone’s bathroom.

703
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,000
I came to see my girlfriend.

704
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,250
So, I have to stand boldly.

705
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,333
You stand like that.

706
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,166
Still… where’s she gone…Hey!

707
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,000
What are you doing there?

708
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,125
Our bicycle is damaged.

709
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,333
Whose bicycle?

710
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:22,333
Mine.

711
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:23,333
Go away from here.

712
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,333
There he comes to break his bicycle.

713
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,000
Let’s go… go…

714
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,500
I had told you…

715
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:29,750
Would he chase us?

716
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,041
It’s telephone directory,

717
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,333
All phone numbers are there inside,

718
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:42,166
Do you know?

719
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,083
Her father’s name is Rajendran.

720
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,291
We know her house.

721
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,291
Can’t we find the number from this easily?

722
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,166
Here….

723
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,250
Find it quickly,

724
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,916
Do it actively dude.

725
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,500
2 1 9 …

726
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:57,666
Did you find it?

727
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,875
One of these eight numbers will 
be her number…

728
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,208
- Shall we call? 
- Yes.

729
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,125
- Call then. 
- Give me.

730
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:06,875
Dial the number.

731
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,166
Shall I?

732
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,166
2347…

733
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:18,375
It’s ringing.

734
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,291
Hello,

735
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:23,916
Hello,

736
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:26,000
- Is it Rajendran’s number? 
- Yes.

737
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,875
Working in Water authority?

738
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,166
No, I work in Police department.

739
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:31,500
Lightning Rajendran.

740
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:39,333
Hello…

741
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,666
Is it Rajendran?

742
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,416
Yes, who are you?

743
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,166
Do you work in water authority?

744
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:48,208
Yes, I am Rajendran working in 
Water authority.

745
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:49,291
Who are you?

746
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,083
Hello,

747
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:51,750
It’s her father.

748
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,666
What… What can I say to him?

749
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,083
- Hello 
- Talk to him, please.

750
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,166
Hello,

751
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,166
- Hello 
- Who are you?

752
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,250
How long I’ve been saying hello to you?

753
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:03,333
I couldn’t hear properly.

754
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,500
Where are you calling from?

755
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:06,166
From the telephone exchange.

756
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,000
- Oh… 
- Can you hear now?

757
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:08,916
Yes, I can hear now.

758
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:10,458
Is it clear?

759
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,666
Yes, but not very clear.

760
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,708
Yes, that’s the problem everywhere.

761
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:15,666
Do one thing,

762
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,791
Just try shaking the telephone body.

763
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,833
One second,

764
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,416
To shake the body?

765
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:24,416
Did you shake?

766
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:25,875
Yes, I did.

767
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,166
- Isn’t the voice clear now? 
- Let me check.

768
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,958
If there’s any problem again, 
do like this.

769
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,500
You are right, it’s clear now.

770
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,750
Ok sir, Thank you.

771
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:38,875
- It’s her number, isn’t it? 
- Go away.

772
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:40,833
It’s simple method.

773
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:47,750
This world is for those 
who are successful in life.

774
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:51,916
So, we should only think 
about success all the time.

775
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:54,916
We should keep finding ways to success.

776
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,250
For example, take the case of a farm,

777
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:58,666
You plough it, sow the seeds,

778
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,916
When they sprout, what do you do?

779
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:01,333
We give manure.

780
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,750
We remove the weeds.

781
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,666
The saplings are important.

782
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:08,041
This world doesn’t need weeds.

783
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:11,875
So, do you want to be a weed or a sapling?

784
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,791
It’s you who has to decide it.

785
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,666
I want to be a sapling.

786
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:17,916
Correct!

787
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,166
So, you are joining, aren’t you?

788
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:20,750
Of course.

789
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:24,166
- The classes happen on every Sunday. 
- Ok.

790
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,166
Sunday?

791
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:26,166
Yes, Sunday,

792
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,708
Are you hearing for the first time?

793
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:33,000
Are you going to be an 
engineer as your father says?

794
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,166
May be my dog.

795
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,250
To join the film institute, 
a degree is necessary.

796
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,166
I’m just getting this degree for that.

797
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,083
Your case looks funny to me.

798
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,458
You, getting a passport and 
going to Dubai,

799
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,250
After doing business for 30-40 years,

800
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,666
Will get bedridden with high cholesterol 
and other illness.

801
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:51,166
You see, I will maintain 
a fit body doing exercise,

802
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,166
Like the movies star Mammooka.

803
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:54,208
Then, after retuning I will 
produce a movie.

804
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:55,458
Mammooka is fine, but him…

805
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,000
Come.

806
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,083
Dude

807
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:22,666
Dude, please show me.

808
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:26,750
It’s commerce.

809
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,833
Do you want?

810
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:32,166
Miss, paper please.

811
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:35,000
What’s this?

812
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,250
Write!

813
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:02,166
Hey, the answer sheet…

814
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:55,333
Thanks!

815
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:57,166
What you are doing is not right.

816
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:59,166
I hadn’t studied anything, that’s why…

817
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,333
I don’t see Rehna with you these days,

818
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,166
Did you have a fight?

819
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,666
Nothing like that.

820
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,250
What you said that day was correct.

821
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:08,166
She deserved it.

822
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:10,791
Even if you don’t like a person, 
one shouldn’t speak like that.

823
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,458
Riyas would have been hurt very badly.

824
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,750
Anyone would be hurt hearing that.

825
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:18,250
If I tell you the same as 
what Riyas told,

826
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,916
Would you reply me the same way?

827
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:21,791
But Nithin would never tell me like that,

828
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,125
We are friends.

829
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:26,666
Aren’t we?

830
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:30,333
It didn’t work,

831
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:31,708
I will get in the next try.

832
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,916
Dude, what’s the plan for Onam celebration?

833
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:39,166
Let’s not wear usual traditional 
dress for Onam.

834
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:40,500
Then?

835
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:43,791
This is a bit different.

836
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:44,958
Different?

837
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:47,291
Different?

838
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,791
Different?

839
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:33,458
Beat it!

840
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,333
Flowers,

841
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,166
Aren’t you doing floral design 
in your class?

842
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:01,666
Yes, we are.

843
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:04,041
But, shall I tell you the truth?

844
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:05,958
Even though they are doing it there,

845
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:07,416
I like to do it here.

846
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:08,791
It will be there.

847
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,208
Shall I keep this flower over here?

848
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:12,083
If you are running out of flowers,

849
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,291
We have a lot in our class.

850
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:13,875
I will bring from my class.

851
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,333
It would be nice to keep 
these flowers on the corners.

852
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,166
Which flower do you like Varshu?

853
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:19,666
Yellow or red?

854
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,750
Let’s fill this design with yellow flowers.

855
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:23,416
Why are you staring like this Sandhya?

856
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,291
I will help you.

857
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,708
See I am helping…

858
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:26,875
It’s nice.

859
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,208
What kind of dress are you wearing?

860
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:31,166
Did you go for the drum concert?

861
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,333
Laugh everyone…

862
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,416
Stop it!

863
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,666
Let’s fill this design with yellow flowers.

864
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:41,208
What happened Sandhya?

865
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:42,291
Ok, leave now.

866
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:43,666
Go, go.

867
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:44,791
Which is your class?

868
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,166
I’m your senior, talk respectfully.

869
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,083
I am your senior.

870
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:51,125
I just came to help you guys.

871
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,291
We don’t need your help, go now.

872
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,208
Leave.

873
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,458
Get out of our class.

874
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:56,666
Get out.

875
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,875
I’m in 12th grade, your senior,

876
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:58,791
Don’t forget that.

877
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,375
- Get out. 
- Go and eat some oil cake and gruel.

878
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:05,666
I will smash you.

879
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,333
People laugh at me, 
you know why?

880
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:08,958
Because I’m different.

881
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,166
But I laugh at you.

882
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,750
Because you are same, you bloody fools…

883
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,166
You fool...

884
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,125
God!

885
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:23,333
What is it, the Indian flag?

886
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:26,208
Is it the way to dress 
for Onam celebration, sir?

887
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,208
See his dressing,

888
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,125
Okay leave it

889
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:32,791
Anyway, you participate in the programs.

890
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:34,958
Happy Onam sir.

891
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:35,791
Come dude.

892
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,166
Nothing.

893
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:40,958
Sir, this is an educational institution.

894
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,666
You should have some discipline.

895
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:46,875
Dear Namboodiri Sir, today we are 
celebrating Onam in this school.

896
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,750
We should come out of teacher’s 
attire today and

897
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:52,166
join our students for the feast 
and other programs.

898
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,333
Shouldn’t we be doing that?

899
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,083
Let's also join and dance with them!

900
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,791
Dude, we have got a wonderful 
chance to compensate.

901
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:15,750
Let’s recover from this first.

902
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:16,666
You keep quiet.

903
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,125
Tell me the matter.

904
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:21,166
The tug of war competition 
is taking place in the ground.

905
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,500
All teachers and students are there.

906
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,125
The students of 12th grade, 
commerce are leading now.

907
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,166
Shall we go and defeat them.

908
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:28,666
Dude, they are seniors,

909
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,416
How can we win over them?

910
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,083
Dude, I have never participated 
in such competition before.

911
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,250
That’s not a problem.

912
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,083
We will take care of them,

913
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,916
You just have to stand at the back 
and pull strongly.

914
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:41,875
Please dude.

915
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,166
Still, me…

916
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:46,083
I will buy you 10 porottas 
and 2 plates of beef curry.

917
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:47,083
Are you ready?

918
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,958
Then I’m ready.

919
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,916
Pull… pull…

920
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,166
Don’t let it go…

921
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:04,875
Pull harder…

922
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:07,458
I will buy you 28 porottas 
and 10 plates of beef curry…

923
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:08,875
Pull!

924
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,875
Robin, what are you staring at?

925
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:17,791
Pull!

926
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,458
Dude… pull hard….

927
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,000
We won… we won….

928
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:49,708
(cheering)

929
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:51,458
This way…. This way…

930
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:58,083
(cheering)

931
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:09,083
Why are you sitting alone?

932
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:13,875
Nothing, it’s difficult to walk 
around wearing this saree.

933
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:16,166
Are you the only child at your home?

934
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:17,250
Yes, why?

935
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:20,291
Just asked seeing you sitting 
alone comfortably.

936
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:24,875
Nithin, you have a sister, right?

937
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:27,708
Yes, she is always a trouble to me.

938
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:29,041
Nothing like that.

939
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:34,500
You are lucky to have someone 
to fight and have fun.

940
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:39,041
I want to thank you for two things.

941
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:43,333
One, for saving me from the beating 
of Namboodiri Sir.

942
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:45,916
And other one for helping me 
in the exam hall.

943
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,166
You don’t have to thank me for that.

944
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,166
I’m like this.

945
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:50,958
I don’t know if I might change tomorrow.

946
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:51,916
You won’t change.

947
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:53,666
I’m sure.

948
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,750
10 days… We will meet after 10 days.

949
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,291
Yes, 10 days.

950
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,083
- It was nice, isn’t it? 
- Super.

951
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:30,541
Prithviraj was excellent.

952
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,458
I liked the songs.

953
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:36,416
“Oh Great singer, 
you are the moonlight of my heart”

954
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,000
Enough guys! come on.

955
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,375
The school will open in one week’s time,

956
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,583
It’s really hard, dude.

957
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,541
The school will open in three days, right?

958
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:02,166
See how happy he is.

959
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:05,041
Nithin, when are you going to 
tell her about your love?

960
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,375
She is considering me as a good friend now.

961
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:09,500
Why should I cause unnecessary trouble?

962
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:10,541
That’s true.

963
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,625
Don’t do foolish things as he did.

964
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:15,125
Why to trouble her giving Arabic letter?

965
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,916
Dear Robin…. The saint…

966
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:25,541
Why is it raining now? Come, come.

967
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,166
Let’s go.

968
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,000
Take that cloth also.

969
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:30,958
Come fast.

970
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:32,666
Nithin, come fast.

971
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,625
You came with your dad today,

972
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:06,500
What happened to your bicycle?

973
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:07,916
That got punctured.

974
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,958
Are you friends with that Pasu again?

975
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:13,416
I saw you talking.

976
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:14,125
Did you see?

977
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,083
Still you didn’t come to save me.

978
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:17,458
I don’t like him at all.

979
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,416
He always comes to talk to me, 
with a dirty smile.

980
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:46,458
Varsha Rajendran has secured more than 
90% marks for all subjects in 11th grade.

981
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:51,541
Very good.

982
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:52,625
Thank you, sir.

983
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:54,000
Varsha is smart.

984
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:57,541
If you prepare for entrance exams, 
you can get admission on merit.

985
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,333
Let her decide about that sir.

986
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:07,500
Jithin Xavi.

987
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,083
Nithin M.

988
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:20,083
Mom

989
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,250
God, my hands and legs are 
shaking with fear.

990
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,375
Why does he come to school?

991
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:36,291
He comes to school and sleep 
sitting on the back bench,

992
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,000
Good for nothing.

993
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,625
Let me tell you,

994
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,541
He is only good for doing 
crazy things in the school,

995
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,708
Do you know what he and his friends 
have been doing here in the school?

996
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:49,541
This way, we don’t think 
he can continue for long.

997
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:54,708
What to do, he is not ashamed of anything.

998
01:04:59,125 --> 01:04:59,708
Mom,

999
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,333
Hey, what’s happening here?

1000
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,208
Based on the marks they got for first exam,

1001
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:14,250
You are talking to parents about 
how to improve them, right?

1002
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,875
But I can’t agree with what you are doing.

1003
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,333
You are teachers.

1004
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,500
Your responsibility is to understand 
the limitations of students

1005
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,458
And inform the parents about them.

1006
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:24,583
I agree with that.

1007
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:28,166
But it’s not right to say 
that in front of everyone.

1008
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:31,166
You should talk to them in private.

1009
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,625
That’s the manners, right?

1010
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:35,166
You flattered my daughter a lot.

1011
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:39,875
Can you guarantee me that she would 
become successful in her life in future?

1012
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:42,666
How can you predict that Nithin, 
whom you are criticizing now,

1013
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,083
Will not be successful in his life?

1014
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,250
The PTA meeting should not be 
for demotivating students.

1015
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:55,333
Please.

1016
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:06,000
Why does the system here never change, sir?

1017
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:08,375
How can I change the system alone?

1018
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,208
That’s true.

1019
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:13,458
Already other staffs are complaining that 
I am supporting students unnecessarily.

1020
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,458
Anyways, you did excellent job.

1021
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,291
Dad, this is Nithin.

1022
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:20,333
I already know him.

1023
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:22,000
Sir, please sign here.

1024
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,708
I will back in a moment.

1025
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:26,708
Uncle, you are great.

1026
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:28,958
Shall we leave, dear?

1027
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:32,000
Brother, I wanted to whistle 
when I heard that.

1028
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:33,375
What?

1029
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,500
Just because this is a school.

1030
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:37,166
If you think something is wrong,

1031
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,666
Don’t hesitate to respond.

1032
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,375
Children grow up seeing us.

1033
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:44,208
- In that case, you should visit 
our house one day.- Why?

1034
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,333
There is one person there who needs advice.

1035
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:47,291
Is it a child?

1036
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,208
Like a child.

1037
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,875
Everything will be fine.

1038
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:51,958
Come dear.

1039
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:53,625
Ok then.

1040
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:55,708
Did you see him?

1041
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,458
Tell dad to be like him.

1042
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,958
You can also be like her. Come.

1043
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:08,666
Dude, the youth festival 
is a good chance for us to shine.

1044
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:12,083
If you have any different idea 
like the Onam celebration,

1045
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:13,958
- Dear Nithin, I am not for it. 
- Go away.

1046
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:16,875
Dude, we should be the heroes 
like the tug of war contest.

1047
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,375
Fazi will participate in Oppana dance, 
as bride.

1048
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,291
Varsha’s song will be there.

1049
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:22,958
I can’t.

1050
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:24,375
Then, what shall we do?

1051
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,375
Don’t make mistake. One more!

1052
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:27,375
- Sit like this. 
- Ready, come on!

1053
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:31,416
You fool, in this posture,

1054
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:32,541
Ok, like this.

1055
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:34,375
Start.

1056
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,125
- Keep your back straight. 
- Show me.

1057
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,125
Not yet.

1058
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,125
Here, here.

1059
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,375
Hold.

1060
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:42,541
Come on! Ready!

1061
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:50,375
(humming music)

1062
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,291
Stop it, turn it off.

1063
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:54,291
Did he come to receive any award?

1064
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:55,958
- What? 
- It’s off.

1065
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,375
Can I also dance with you?

1066
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:00,208
You…

1067
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:01,666
- What’s this? 
- Robin…

1068
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,416
Dear Award bro, this 
program is just for 5 minutes.

1069
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:08,958
It’ not one-hour program as you think.

1070
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:09,958
So, you can’t join us.

1071
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,625
Leave, you please leave.

1072
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:12,291
Leave!

1073
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:13,333
I too…

1074
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:14,458
Please don’t come back again.

1075
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:15,875
Close the door and leave.

1076
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:16,541
Just wasting our time…

1077
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:20,166
Go fast man!

1078
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:22,416
I will rock.

1079
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,291
- There comes the next idiot. 
- What?

1080
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:29,916
Are you guys practicing secretly?

1081
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,083
- To the right. 
- Turn it off.

1082
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,000
Which song is it?

1083
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,708
"En Aasai Mythiliye"

1084
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,083
That’s nice, carry on!

1085
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:38,416
Come dude!

1086
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:40,541
- You close the door. 
- Of course,

1087
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,125
- Who is this guy? 
- Play the music.

1088
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,000
Shall I lock the door?

1089
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,250
Do whatever you like.

1090
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:46,291
Ready! One more!

1091
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:19,458
Light Music - Chest Number 82

1092
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:46,875
-Dude, like this… 
- Doesn't look good

1093
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:51,458
Like this

1094
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:52,458
Dude, when will you get that right?

1095
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:54,916
Come, let’s practice.

1096
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,708
- Yes, let’s practice. 
- Come.

1097
01:09:58,375 --> 01:09:59,500
Ready!

1098
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:01,000
- Which one? 
- Sit down.

1099
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:02,000
Like thanathana…

1100
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:03,333
1, 2, 3, 4..

1101
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:14,375
(singing)

1102
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,541
Isn’t that our song?

1103
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:19,375
Who else chose that?

1104
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:21,375
Come, let’s find.

1105
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:32,625
Dude, those guys…

1106
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:34,041
Hey!

1107
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:46,375
Come on

1108
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:51,666
Don’t you have anything else to do?

1109
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,125
I’m your teacher, god!

1110
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:57,541
I am telling you to stop.

1111
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,125
Kick him!

1112
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:03,625
I’m telling… oh god,

1113
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:08,541
Dude, that’s Mani.

1114
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:09,458
Which?

1115
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:10,375
From Aasan colony.

1116
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,666
Do you dare enough to hit the seniors?

1117
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:14,916
If you come here to study, do study.

1118
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,875
Or your parents will regret.

1119
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,416
Stop guys!

1120
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,291
Let me see.

1121
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:25,541
Does it hurt a lot?

1122
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:27,416
No, it feels very nice.

1123
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,500
You got hit in front of so many people.

1124
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,166
It’s a shame in front of everyone.

1125
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:35,083
Couldn’t you hit him back?

1126
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,541
When I was about to hit him, 
Principal came

1127
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:39,291
Or I would have smashed his nose.

1128
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:40,375
I didn’t want to make the issue worse,

1129
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,541
Or I would have hit him badly.

1130
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:42,958
You can hit them even now.

1131
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,875
You can hit them even now.

1132
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:49,875
Already we are in trouble.

1133
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,375
Principal has already warned us.

1134
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,333
and if we go and hit them again...

1135
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:55,291
Only when you hit them inside the school 
you will have a problem

1136
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:57,000
You can hit them while outside.

1137
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:59,000
- Outside? 
- Please don’t say like that.

1138
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:04,708
Riyas, you got hit very badly, didn’t you?

1139
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,500
Why did you have to fight with the seniors?

1140
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:10,125
Hey, fights are usual for boys.

1141
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:12,958
If we got hit, 
we also know how to hit them back.

1142
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,333
But you know only to get hit.

1143
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,375
First, I have to hit her.

1144
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,875
- Riyas… 
- Move!

1145
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:20,541
Roaming around with the blue shirt guy.

1146
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:21,500
We have to hit back.

1147
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:23,375
Get up!

1148
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:27,708
We will talk only after hitting them 
within one week.

1149
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,125
What is he saying?

1150
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:29,583
Come dude!

1151
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:30,875
Where?

1152
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:32,375
Riyas,

1153
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,000
Come here.

1154
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,583
My god…

1155
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,666
Everything was back on track,

1156
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:58,541
Now,hell with his vow.

1157
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,458
Dude, the pain of getting beaten 
on one side,

1158
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,375
Then Rehna’s teasing on other side,

1159
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:08,958
I lost control.

1160
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:10,541
Let’s do one thing.

1161
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,250
Let’s change what we said.

1162
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:16,500
Is it weather forecast, 
to change when you like.

1163
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,458
You guys don’t know about that Mani.

1164
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:20,625
He is the brother 
of Drum Ravi in Aasan colony.

1165
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,375
If something happens to him, 
that whole colony will attack us.

1166
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:24,458
Drum Ravi?

1167
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:27,416
Yes, once he starts hitting, 
it’s like playing drums.

1168
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:29,333
He won’t stop once he starts hitting.

1169
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,625
That’s how he got the name.

1170
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:34,541
Then we can’t handle him directly.

1171
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:35,875
How can it happen?

1172
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,208
Let’s do one thing.

1173
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:39,375
Let’s hit him in the dark.

1174
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,875
You can hit even in the light, 
then how to hit in the dark?

1175
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:41,666
Hitting in dark!

1176
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,583
Riyas, be practical.

1177
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:45,875
I have an idea.

1178
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,125
It’s slightly different.

1179
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,375
Difference! Don’t say that word.

1180
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:52,500
Stop it, you tell me.

1181
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,541
We can’t fight face to face.

1182
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,125
- That’s danger, right? 
- Yes, danger.

1183
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,500
But we want to hit him,

1184
01:13:58,083 --> 01:13:59,166
And save our faces.

1185
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,875
There’s only one way for that.

1186
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:03,875
- Let’s hire some thugs. 
- Thugs!

1187
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:04,500
What are you talking about?

1188
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,041
Hire which thug?

1189
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:09,875
There’s a guy near Subeesh’s workshop.

1190
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:11,416
Chenkannu Sabu.

1191
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,125
So, that’s the matter.

1192
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,375
You guys can handle this easily.

1193
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,541
Sabu bro, no one should know 
that we have done it.

1194
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:31,500
Why so?

1195
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,541
If they know that we have done this, 
he will dismiss us from the school.

1196
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:35,583
Who?

1197
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:36,875
The Principal.

1198
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,458
Tell him to get lost.

1199
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:42,541
It is thrilling only when you hit 
a person telling who and why.

1200
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:46,458
Not just that, the person who gets beaten 
has the right to know the reason.

1201
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:47,541
You don’t worry.

1202
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,041
He won’t tell this even to his own mother.

1203
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:54,125
Not only that, his relative… who is that?

1204
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:56,083
Drum…

1205
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:58,541
Who is that idiot, Shaji?

1206
01:14:58,916 --> 01:14:59,625
Don’t you know him?

1207
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,333
He lives in Aasan colony.

1208
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:04,000
- Our boys had a fight with him once. 
- Who?

1209
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:07,875
The guy who messed with us in the theatre.

1210
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:10,125
That germ…

1211
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:11,375
Do one thing,

1212
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:14,375
Tell our boys to handle him 
also along with others.

1213
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:16,250
I will take care of that.

1214
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,000
Did this happen in the fight that day?

1215
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:20,541
No, it was when I was catching the ball like….

1216
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,083
- How? 
- Like this…

1217
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,416
Sabu bro!

1218
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,375
What’s it?

1219
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,541
- How about the expense? 
- What?

1220
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:29,375
How much do you charge for this?

1221
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:34,000
Friend, do you think I’m that hard-hearted?

1222
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,500
- Still? 
- Don’t say anything.

1223
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,083
Not that Sabu bro…

1224
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,333
I will do this for my friend.

1225
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:40,708
You be bold.

1226
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:46,875
Dear, it’s been two days since 
Riyas talked to me.

1227
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:49,166
He is avoiding me 
whenever I try to talk to him.

1228
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,416
They might be upset.

1229
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:52,958
He said he will talk to us 
only after hitting Mani.

1230
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:54,708
That’s what I’m worried about.

1231
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,125
Will they get hit again?

1232
01:15:58,375 --> 01:15:59,583
I am also scared about it.

1233
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,291
Why are you scared?

1234
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,875
My concern is about Riyas.

1235
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:09,375
Aren’t we all friends?

1236
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,541
I understand everything.

1237
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:16,458
Look there.

1238
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,250
What happened Mani bro?

1239
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,916
I fell off the bike.

1240
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:25,416
Do you know bike riding?

1241
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:28,083
People can fall if they sit in the back.

1242
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,125
That’s not a big deal.

1243
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,291
Do you know where it happened?

1244
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:07,125
Where?

1245
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,375
At the colony.

1246
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,375
- In front of everyone. 
- Really?

1247
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:15,000
Then? Tell us!

1248
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:20,375
Hey Mani!

1249
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,875
What’s up silly boys? 
Didn’t you have enough?

1250
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:50,666
We came to return you everything with interest.

1251
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:57,291
Don’t get your body damaged, 
go home and study.

1252
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,875
We will study only after making you bedridden.

1253
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:03,875
If you don’t understand what I said,

1254
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,375
You will understand when you get hurt.

1255
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:20,375
Who are these people?

1256
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,666
All are famous goons.

1257
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:30,541
Kerosene Faisal, Drum Ravi, 
Bheeman Anu and Chilanka Stephen.

1258
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:45,083
"Eyes are two, eyes are two"

1259
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:47,083
"You are one of those two"

1260
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,458
"I gave you half of my heart,"

1261
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:51,458
"Keeping aside the other girl"

1262
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:53,458
"If the heart is good, no need of a mirror"

1263
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:55,458
"To sleep, even a pestle will do for a bed"

1264
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:57,583
"We behaved badly, jumped over steps"

1265
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,875
"And showed cunningness in many ways"

1266
01:19:01,291 --> 01:19:02,791
Who was that?

1267
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:15,708
I won’t let anyone to hurt those, 
who love me.

1268
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,375
You were not like this before.

1269
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:27,875
Hasn't he still reached down?

1270
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Record, record.

1271
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,500
Where is your record book?

1272
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:44,375
What?

1273
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,125
Your record.

1274
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:50,708
You haven’t drawn the diagram.

1275
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:52,875
No problem, you can draw later.

1276
01:19:54,083 --> 01:19:54,666
Carry on.

1277
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:55,708
Record.

1278
01:19:57,291 --> 01:19:58,875
Record, record.

1279
01:19:59,083 --> 01:19:59,958
You tell

1280
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:31,208
(screaming)

1281
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,875
If you touch any one of us again,

1282
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:37,291
You will have to appoint a person 
to take care of you.

1283
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,333
Do you understand?

1284
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:39,250
Come.

1285
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:52,958
Excellent.

1286
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:53,875
I liked it.

1287
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,208
They deserve it.

1288
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:26,708
Get ready quickly Biju bro, 
it’s getting late to school

1289
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:27,916
Do you have classes today?

1290
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:31,208
Although it’s Second Saturday, 
I have Chemistry Special Class.

1291
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:34,833
Special Class! Needlessly fooling the children!

1292
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,125
Don’t they have any other business?

1293
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,416
You keep it ready, I will take it 
in the evening

1294
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,250
Won’t you pay my money?

1295
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:49,750
Will pay you in the evening bro.

1296
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:03,666
Hello

1297
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,500
Hi! Where is your bicycle?

1298
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:08,166
Usual Problem! Flat tyre!

1299
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:10,041
Aren’t you coming to School today?

1300
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,583
No. I am travelling to Town 
to purchase something.

1301
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:13,500
Alone?

1302
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:14,416
What’s wrong in it?

1303
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,125
My dad says girls should learn 
to travel alone.

1304
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,041
Your dad is fantastic!

1305
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,708
You are very lucky to get such a dad.

1306
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,000
Your place is reached, aren’t you getting down?

1307
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:36,791
Should I?

1308
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:38,541
If you are not getting down,

1309
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,750
And if you come with me, 
I will buy you a Biriyani.

1310
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,291
Then okay

1311
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:01,500
Why have you come here? 
What is there to buy from here?

1312
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:02,333
Come

1313
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:08,041
Dear, didn’t see you for a long time!

1314
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,250
It’s been nearly 2 months since I informed 
Rajendra Sir that new varieties are available

1315
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,208
You are coming only now.

1316
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:14,625
Only today I got time, brother.

1317
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:15,750
Who is this, child?

1318
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:17,583
My friend – Nithin

1319
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:19,125
Come, Have a look.

1320
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:20,916
Shall move

1321
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:22,208
Don't we have to pay him?

1322
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:23,583
Father will pay

1323
01:25:03,416 --> 01:25:05,500
Most favorite thing is to get drenched in rain

1324
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:11,125
Favourite hobby is Aquarium and Fish keeping

1325
01:25:11,916 --> 01:25:13,458
A good scholar…

1326
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:15,625
And scores 90% in all subjects.

1327
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:19,708
To tell the truth, I can’t understand you

1328
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,083
There is nothing to understand about it.

1329
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,458
Do what you wish.

1330
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,583
My dad has given me full freedom for that.

1331
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:29,375
Shall I tell you the truth?

1332
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:33,291
I am least interested to pursue Engineering.

1333
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:37,916
Only because of my dad’s insistence, 
I attend this coaching class

1334
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:41,541
I am not that studious.

1335
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:46,666
Doing something creative is my desire!

1336
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,541
What do you want to be?

1337
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,916
Me?

1338
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,375
I wish to become a Film Director

1339
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:02,875
So what?

1340
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:04,250
It’s a good ambition

1341
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:07,458
Really! Isn’t it bad?

1342
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:10,250
Nothing! Go ahead with it!

1343
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:38,833
Can’t you tell about your ambition 
to your dad?

1344
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,041
I told him many times

1345
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,125
He won’t listen. No use of telling him.

1346
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:48,916
Anyhow, in one way, I am impressed

1347
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,291
Why?

1348
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,875
Normally boys won’t reveal anything to Girls,..

1349
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,416
I mean in boys’ words, 
to a studious girl like me,

1350
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:56,750
Boys don’t reveal their true ambitions

1351
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,208
Even if they do,

1352
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:00,500
they only say they wish to become 
Doctors, Engineers etc.

1353
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:02,875
But you are totally different, Nithin

1354
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:03,833
I like it

1355
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:22,500
"The flute of breeze sang about you"

1356
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:32,000
"The moon and the star turned 
into you today"

1357
01:27:32,416 --> 01:27:37,416
"Whenever I close my eyes"

1358
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:42,000
"Your footsteps fill my heart"

1359
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:47,000
"All my dreams adorn with colours"

1360
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:55,166
"Loving endlessly, we became"

1361
01:27:56,541 --> 01:28:05,000
"Flower-stamen sticking with dew drops"

1362
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:23,666
Look...Look…Look..

1363
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:33,583
"Loving endlessly, we became"

1364
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:45,416
"Flower-stamen sticking with dew drops"

1365
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:47,541
Pat slowly, mom

1366
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,291
Don’t you know you will catch fever 
if you get wet in the first Rain?

1367
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,041
My hair will be ruined.

1368
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,625
Learning new habits!!

1369
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:52,541
Here mom!

1370
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:53,875
Bring it here.

1371
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,125
Attend the phone, I have chores in the kitchen

1372
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:02,041
You come.

1373
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:06,833
Hello

1374
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,000
Hello, Nithin?

1375
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:12,041
Varsha?

1376
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,708
Can you recognize my voice?

1377
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:15,583
Yes, I do

1378
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:17,666
How did you get my number?

1379
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:19,750
Simple. Telephone Directory

1380
01:29:21,666 --> 01:29:22,750
My number is also in it.

1381
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:23,833
Didn’t you check?

1382
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:25,791
No..I didn’t.

1383
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,291
Why did you call me?

1384
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:33,208
I just felt like chatting and I called

1385
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:37,208
Why are you silent?

1386
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,541
As I’m surprised, don’t know what to say.

1387
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:45,791
Okay, See you tomorrow

1388
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,083
Yes!

1389
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,500
Whose call was that?

1390
01:29:56,166 --> 01:29:57,291
Mom’s friend

1391
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,500
Which friend of Mom?

1392
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,750
I got many friends

1393
01:30:03,166 --> 01:30:04,291
I have many friends.

1394
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,500
I call them often and they also call me

1395
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:09,583
Be it Girlfriend or Boyfriend.

1396
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:11,000
Dear, Neelima!

1397
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,791
I’m coming.

1398
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:14,416
- Who? 
- Varsha

1399
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:18,500
Listen friends.

1400
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:20,666
We got to select our Christmas friend

1401
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,791
Please write your name on a Paper 
and give it to me.

1402
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:26,500
Everyone just write one name.

1403
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:28,416
Only your own names!

1404
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,125
Did you put it?

1405
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:40,500
- Fasila, aren’t you dropping? 
- Yes

1406
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:44,041
Dude, please put it.

1407
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:45,333
What a guy is he! Won’t I come over there?

1408
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,500
Get lost

1409
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:49,375
Please move your muscle, let me drop this

1410
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,500
Thank you..Thank you

1411
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,041
Has everyone given?

1412
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:54,291
Okay, Pick one

1413
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,041
Which one to pick?

1414
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:56,416
Don’t swallow it

1415
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,041
Just one, right?

1416
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:01,500
Yeah, take it.

1417
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:03,375
I’m scared. I don’t want to see.

1418
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:09,875
Get me one dude

1419
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,500
Has everyone got one?

1420
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:15,583
Then, bring a gift for your friend!

1421
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,791
He is a perfect match for you!

1422
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:22,000
Then you will have the only thought of studying!

1423
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,833
- Who did you get? 
- Fasila!

1424
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:26,708
- And She got me. 
- How?

1425
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
We neither wrote our names nor picked a chit

1426
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,791
Then nobody else will get our names

1427
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:35,000
So, Fasi and me will exchange our gifts

1428
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:38,833
Oh no! I should’ve also used some trick

1429
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:40,416
How is that possible?

1430
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:43,291
It was possible for him 
because Fasila also agreed.

1431
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,708
But in your case, 
Varsha doesn’t know that you love her

1432
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:48,500
Nithin!

1433
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:51,166
When did he become this fast?

1434
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,333
I got something to tell you

1435
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,041
What is it? Tell me

1436
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,625
Can I talk to you personally?

1437
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:02,500
You talk here… 
We have no secrets between us

1438
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:07,000
I know you love Varsha

1439
01:32:07,666 --> 01:32:08,416
Is this a secret?

1440
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:09,541
What a discovery?

1441
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,375
I got Varsha as my friend

1442
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:18,541
I came to give this to you

1443
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:20,500
Lucky guy!

1444
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:23,208
Hey, it’s Varsha.

1445
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,041
Thanks!

1446
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:27,500
Why thanks? We are friends, dude!

1447
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:30,375
Did he change his engine?

1448
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:33,416
Shouldn’t have scolded him

1449
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:35,833
I got Varsha!

1450
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,125
Dude, look there.

1451
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:01,500
Oxford Dictionary!

1452
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,791
Oh Encyclopedia!!

1453
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,625
Move from here or you will get questions now.

1454
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:15,791
I liked your gift a lot

1455
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:17,708
But this is not my size

1456
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:20,208
Give it to your mom

1457
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:20,875
Mom!!

1458
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:23,500
I am bringing it.

1459
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:46,833
Varsha!

1460
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,333
Happy Christmas!

1461
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:52,541
Thank you

1462
01:34:55,416 --> 01:34:56,416
Hey, have a look!

1463
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,125
I liked your gift a lot

1464
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,291
What kind of fish is that?

1465
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,791
Looks Cute!

1466
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,291
I will tell you

1467
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,583
Can you come with me to Library?

1468
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:26,500
Okay

1469
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:59,541
Sorry… Sorry… Sorry bro

1470
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:04,666
You… Where are you looking, you !

1471
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,166
Nithin!

1472
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:21,666
How many times they are repeating this, sir…

1473
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,583
I don’t understand… 
Why are you showing sympathy on them?

1474
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,875
Give a T.C and send them away

1475
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,416
I was looking for you everywhere

1476
01:36:57,541 --> 01:36:59,541
Riyaz only told me that you will be here

1477
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:01,458
What are you doing here?

1478
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:03,500
Nothing.

1479
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:04,833
I feel strange

1480
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:05,875
What strange?

1481
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:07,416
What is wrong with you?

1482
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:10,375
We’ll retaliate if anyone troubles us!

1483
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,583
What’s wrong in that?

1484
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,583
Well, you didn’t tell me the name of my gift

1485
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,833
Not a big Secret!

1486
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,416
They are snakehead fish babies

1487
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:24,750
Snakehead fish!

1488
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:28,625
When small, It looks very lovely... 
appears red in color

1489
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:32,375
When they grow big, Color will vanish… 
looks like normal

1490
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:34,541
How come I never noticed it?

1491
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:39,291
We fail to notice things that 
lie in front of us!

1492
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:47,666
Okay then, I will leave?

1493
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:48,875
Hmm

1494
01:37:55,500 --> 01:38:00,208
Nithin, You got anything to tell me?

1495
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,625
I..

1496
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:04,208
Can I call you at 11.p.m?

1497
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:05,541
At night?

1498
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:06,708
Can’t you tell now?

1499
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:10,000
I can..

1500
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:12,875
It’s something to be told directly

1501
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:15,625
Still, I will tell it over phone

1502
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,375
It is risky, still okay

1503
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:36,916
- Hello 
- Hello

1504
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:38,291
Gently

1505
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:40,333
Haven’t you slept yet?

1506
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:42,958
You promised to call me, 
how will I sleep then?

1507
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:44,833
What is it? Tell me quickly

1508
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:51,333
Ever since I heard your song, 
I have been thinking of asking you something

1509
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:55,958
Can’t you make Singing as your profession?

1510
01:38:57,833 --> 01:39:00,250
Was it to tell this that you 
called at this hour?

1511
01:39:01,916 --> 01:39:04,666
No, not that...Still, I..

1512
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:07,541
I too have that desire

1513
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:10,625
But waiting for my studies to get completed

1514
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:13,708
You tell me the matter quickly

1515
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:16,250
I will…Before that..

1516
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:18,916
Can you sing a song for me?

1517
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:21,458
- Song? 
- Yeah

1518
01:39:21,958 --> 01:39:23,125
At this mid-night?

1519
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:29,625
I will not tell until you sing

1520
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:31,708
Which song?

1521
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,125
Any song that you like

1522
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,708
Hmm..Okay

1523
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:53,166
"To listen to the whispering 
played on the veena of silence"

1524
01:39:53,708 --> 01:40:06,666
"Are you not there in the 
shore of some moonlight"

1525
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:13,541
"The cooing of koels on the mango branches"

1526
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:20,166
"Mingle with your cool words secretly"

1527
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:26,875
"Don’t you see my mind?"

1528
01:40:28,333 --> 01:40:29,166
Oh God! Dad is coming

1529
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:36,958
Not yet slept, dear?

1530
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:37,875
No, dad, what happened?

1531
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:41,625
I forgot to take water, 
You go to bed

1532
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:42,625
Okay dad

1533
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:44,875
Hail God!

1534
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:53,625
Move

1535
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,625
Dude…

1536
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:59,583
So you didn’t reveal yesterday also

1537
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:01,333
It was because of her dad

1538
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:02,791
Or else you would have!

1539
01:41:03,166 --> 01:41:06,541
By the time you made her sing, 
couldn’t you disclose your love?

1540
01:41:06,666 --> 01:41:09,625
I’ve been wishing to listen 
to her song since a few days

1541
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:12,750
In that good mood, 
I thought of revealing it to her

1542
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,333
By that time, her dad came 
and messed up everything

1543
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:17,625
Definitely I would tell it to 
her during Interval

1544
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:18,625
But she hasn’t still turned up

1545
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:20,541
She normally reaches school by 9 a.m

1546
01:41:20,666 --> 01:41:21,791
First Period is about to start.

1547
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:23,125
She hasn’t turned up still now

1548
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:27,166
Would her dad have created any problem 
due to my phone call last night?

1549
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:27,916
He might have.

1550
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,833
May be not, as her dad is not that kind of a person, 
I don’t think there will be an issue

1551
01:41:33,166 --> 01:41:33,916
Sit down

1552
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:36,916
I will convey

1553
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:39,458
You go and arrange the transport

1554
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,666
I have come to tell you a sad news

1555
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:51,666
Varsha who is studying in our class..

1556
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:54,416
Her dad Rajendran passed away this morning.

1557
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,458
It was a heart attack

1558
01:42:03,333 --> 01:42:06,708
Cremation will take place at 4 p.m. today

1559
01:43:18,333 --> 01:43:27,250
“When the sky covered by summer becomes silent”

1560
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:38,416

1561
01:43:39,666 --> 01:43:43,625

“In the tune of melting soul”,

1564
01:43:55,125 --> 01:44:00,125
“Surrounded by lonely silence”

1565
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:06,708
“Listening for the rain”

1566
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:17,958
Hello!

1567
01:44:18,416 --> 01:44:20,833
Dude! Fasi had called me

1568
01:44:22,708 --> 01:44:23,458
That’s dude…

1569
01:44:23,625 --> 01:44:25,583
Varsha is moving to her Uncle’s home

1570
01:44:27,625 --> 01:44:28,458
Hereafter she will..

1571
01:44:29,166 --> 01:44:31,250
…will be studying over there..

1572
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:40,416
Buddy.. She wants to see you before leaving

1573
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:42,625
They are leaving at 5 p.m.

1574
01:45:35,125 --> 01:45:40,375
“The winter tunes went somewhere”

1575
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:45,125
“The “Vaaka” tree stands blazing in the heat”

1576
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:49,708
“Did half of the unspoken word”

1577
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:55,375
“Burn in the depth of the soul”

1578
01:45:56,916 --> 01:46:02,166
“The flaming light of life’s lamp too”

1579
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:06,291
“Goes off in the wind”

1580
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:12,750
“And the heartbroken pigeon on the “Vaaka” branch”

1581
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:16,375
“Where dreams are dry, sings”

1582
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:22,375
“In the tune of melting soul”

1583
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:27,541
“Surrounded by lonely silence”

1584
01:46:27,666 --> 01:46:34,125
“Listening for the rain”

1585
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:01,208
Nithin..

1586
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:02,833
See this

1587
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:06,166
This is Varsha’s Uncle’s address

1588
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:07,625
Collected from the Principal

1589
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:09,208
Go and meet her

1590
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:10,958
We’ll see the rest

1591
01:47:12,666 --> 01:47:14,375
How could he travel that far?

1592
01:47:14,625 --> 01:47:16,750
Let him say there is an 
NSS (The National Service Scheme) Camp

1593
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:24,750
I have saved one number Shihab Ikka

1594
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:26,166
He is my Cousin

1595
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:27,791
You reach there and call him

1596
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:29,500
He will take care

1597
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:34,291
Wait..

1598
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,833
Keep this..You will need it

1599
01:47:41,458 --> 01:47:45,958
Then when you return, 
return as our old Nithin

1600
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:04,625
Shihab Ikka! This is Nithin..

1601
01:48:06,916 --> 01:48:09,250
Yes..

1602
01:48:09,458 --> 01:48:10,291
There is a jeep..

1603
01:48:13,666 --> 01:48:14,416
Okay, Ikka.

1604
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:20,750
Move..Move

1605
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:11,125
I think this is the house, We will check

1606
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:31,875
Who are you? Where are you coming from?

1607
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:36,125
Bro, One Mr.Anilan..

1608
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:37,250
No one is at home

1609
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:39,250
Anil’s Sister’s husband has expired

1610
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,708
They have gone to Rameswaran 
to perform the Immersing Ceremony

1611
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:43,541
Not sure of their return

1612
01:50:45,708 --> 01:50:47,333
Any Phone number?

1613
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:48,958
Land Phone was there.. 
But that has been disconnected

1614
01:50:51,166 --> 01:50:52,500
Other Contact number…

1615
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,541
Well, Where are you coming from?

1616
01:50:55,666 --> 01:50:56,708
What is the matter?

1617
01:50:57,541 --> 01:50:58,625
Nothing…

1618
01:51:01,583 --> 01:51:02,916
Come, let’s move

1619
01:51:25,875 --> 01:51:30,791
“The autumn season has passed”

1620
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:36,250
“The pond stands dry in pain”

1621
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:41,250
“Did one broken glance”

1622
01:51:41,958 --> 01:51:46,416
“Glimmer in each thought”

1623
01:51:56,875 --> 01:51:58,916
Even after travelling this far,

1624
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:01,125
You are worried about not seeing her, 
aren’t you?

1625
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:05,500
I have respect for you in one thing

1626
01:52:06,333 --> 01:52:07,625
The risk that you have taken now,

1627
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:10,625
I don’t think I would’ve taken 
it at your age

1628
01:52:17,375 --> 01:52:18,500
Let me tell you one more thing

1629
01:52:19,333 --> 01:52:22,708
In this World, compared to the people 
who expressed their love,

1630
01:52:23,666 --> 01:52:25,958
People who loved without expressing, 
are more in number!

1631
01:52:27,166 --> 01:52:32,333
“The pollen-less lips of flowers”

1632
01:52:32,541 --> 01:52:36,666
“Keep falling by itself”

1633
01:52:37,666 --> 01:52:42,875
“And the tormented pigeon”

1634
01:52:43,208 --> 01:52:46,541
“Thinking of the approaching 
season again, sings”

1635
01:52:46,666 --> 01:52:52,541
“In the tune of melting soul”

1636
01:52:52,666 --> 01:52:57,625
“Surrounded by lonely silence”

1637
01:52:57,750 --> 01:53:04,291
“Listening for the rain”

1638
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:15,500
“When the sky covered by summer 
becomes silent”

1639
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:26,625
“When each moist cloud flies away”

1640
01:53:37,541 --> 01:53:38,500
Where had you gone?

1641
01:53:39,458 --> 01:53:40,625
I inquired in your School

1642
01:53:41,625 --> 01:53:42,916
You didn’t attend any NSS camp

1643
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,791
I came to know the happenings 
at your School

1644
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:48,291
Don’t you hear me?

1645
01:53:48,833 --> 01:53:51,416
At last you started cheating your parents 
telling lies, didn’t you?

1646
01:53:57,708 --> 01:53:59,333
- Don’t hit him 
- Get away

1647
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:00,958
Get away I say

1648
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:02,625
Don’t dare hit me

1649
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:05,916
I’m good for nothing..

1650
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:07,458
Good for nothing!

1651
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:10,208
Have you ever asked what my likes are…

1652
01:54:10,541 --> 01:54:11,833
…my happiness…

1653
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:12,625
Never! It is all your wish, dad..

1654
01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:13,958
Got to obey whatever you say!

1655
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:17,125
I will be happy only when I do 
what I like

1656
01:54:17,541 --> 01:54:19,208
Not when I do what you like, dad!

1657
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:20,791
Do you want me to do what you like, dad?

1658
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:21,791
Tell me!

1659
01:54:23,125 --> 01:54:26,458
Today I went to see a person… 
Whom I like

1660
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:30,333
You needn’t ask me who that person is!

1661
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:31,166
I will not tell you

1662
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:32,916
I never feel like telling you

1663
01:54:38,333 --> 01:54:40,791
Son..Son..

1664
01:55:36,333 --> 01:55:36,958
Son..

1665
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:39,625
Get up and come..

1666
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:43,625
Eat something

1667
01:55:43,833 --> 01:55:44,541
Mom

1668
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:50,625
I was a little arrogant

1669
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:56,916
that my son never conceals anything from me

1670
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:02,708
But now..I am not sure...

1671
01:56:21,833 --> 01:56:25,916
Son…I’m not here to hit you or scold you

1672
01:56:26,916 --> 01:56:28,125
What you said was right..

1673
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:31,625
You will feel happy 
only when you do what you like

1674
01:56:33,416 --> 01:56:35,583
Only then you will succeed.

1675
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:38,625
Some people would take time 
to realize certain things.

1676
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:41,708
Your dad also needed it

1677
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,625
Your desire is Cinema

1678
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:48,458
You might win,

1679
01:56:49,666 --> 01:56:50,958
Sometimes you might lose.

1680
01:56:52,541 --> 01:56:53,583
Even if you lose…

1681
01:56:53,916 --> 01:56:55,541
This dad will always be beside you

1682
01:56:57,375 --> 01:57:00,375
But in case if your dad is not alive then….

1683
01:57:06,666 --> 01:57:09,791
Who else is there 
for your mom and sister other than you?

1684
01:57:10,833 --> 01:57:12,291
That’s the reason I advise you

1685
01:57:12,791 --> 01:57:14,208
To pursue a degree

1686
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:17,625
Not an Engineering degree as I desired

1687
01:57:18,666 --> 01:57:19,625
Anything of your choice!

1688
01:57:26,833 --> 01:57:27,541
Come.

1689
01:57:41,666 --> 01:57:42,125
Tell me..

1690
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:43,875
Do you want to see her again?

1691
01:57:45,791 --> 01:57:46,541
Tell me..

1692
01:57:49,458 --> 01:57:51,291
But hereafter don’t go alone

1693
01:57:52,958 --> 01:57:53,916
I shall also come along with you

1694
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:55,833
I will talk to them

1695
01:57:58,083 --> 01:58:00,458
Before that, You got to decide three things

1696
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:02,833
One – She is a fatherless child

1697
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:06,041
Two – The distance between both of you

1698
01:58:09,875 --> 01:58:14,666
Three – What Confidence can you give her 
about your future at this age of 16!

1699
01:58:14,875 --> 01:58:16,291
Now the choice is yours!

1700
01:58:17,041 --> 01:58:17,958
I will be with you

1701
01:58:19,166 --> 01:58:20,625
Your dad will be with you

1702
01:58:56,583 --> 01:59:09,458
"Unable to speak out, sweet honey rains 
endlessly in my heart"

1703
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:16,375
"Unknowingly, I hear at the door of my soul"

1704
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:22,583
"A footstep regularly"

1705
02:00:42,458 --> 02:00:43,625
Don’t worry, son

1706
02:00:45,333 --> 02:00:48,666
If she is destined for you, 
you will definitely get her

1707
02:00:50,666 --> 02:00:53,333
Such infatuations happening at this 
age are for good

1708
02:00:54,125 --> 02:00:55,916
Only then we can succeed in life

1709
02:00:58,208 --> 02:00:59,208
You ought to win

1710
02:01:00,333 --> 02:01:02,208
Even if you decide to lose

1711
02:01:02,958 --> 02:01:04,625
This dad will not let that happen, Son!

1712
02:01:49,583 --> 02:01:50,375
Isn’t it Okay?

1713
02:01:51,791 --> 02:01:52,916
Varsha, once more

1714
02:01:53,958 --> 02:01:57,250
One, two, three, four…

1715
02:01:57,458 --> 02:02:10,583
"When each moon which embraces 
the eyelashes, vanish"

1716
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:23,750
"You didn’t come in search of the pearl 
in dream’s casket"

1717
02:02:26,666 --> 02:02:28,250
Varsha, very good

1718
02:02:28,458 --> 02:02:29,458
Only the last stanza is left.

1719
02:02:29,666 --> 02:02:30,708
Let’s take a break

1720
02:02:32,125 --> 02:02:33,666
Varsha, let’s take a small break

1721
02:02:35,791 --> 02:02:36,791
Shall we go for a puff?

1722
02:02:37,708 --> 02:02:38,583
No, you guys carry on

1723
02:02:38,916 --> 02:02:39,625
Okay

1724
02:03:49,583 --> 02:03:50,541
Hi Juniors!

1725
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:55,208
Pasu!

1726
02:04:06,083 --> 02:04:06,583
Come.

1727
02:04:11,291 --> 02:04:12,083
You are shocked, aren’t you?

1728
02:04:13,833 --> 02:04:16,708
I know. That is why I told 
her to give you a surprise

1729
02:04:18,291 --> 02:04:20,541
Are you thinking about how this happened?

1730
02:04:20,875 --> 02:04:23,083
Sit here.. 
Isn’t that what you are thinking now?

1731
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:27,416
The thing is…in our School days,

1732
02:04:27,583 --> 02:04:28,666
although we develop infatuations 
with many girls

1733
02:04:28,875 --> 02:04:31,083
But only towards one person, 
a true feeling will emerge

1734
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:34,666
Say…a divine love.. 
..a kind of fire…

1735
02:04:34,875 --> 02:04:39,500
I too felt the same towards Varsha, 
I swear

1736
02:04:40,083 --> 02:04:43,083
As my image was too bad in the School

1737
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:44,791
She totally ignored me

1738
02:04:45,291 --> 02:04:47,625
After she left the School 
and moved to another place

1739
02:04:47,833 --> 02:04:49,541
I had an urge

1740
02:04:49,583 --> 02:04:52,208
To see her..

1741
02:04:52,875 --> 02:04:56,333
Then I searched for her address 
and contacted her uncle

1742
02:04:56,541 --> 02:05:01,666
I went there and had Tea and snacks 
and developed friendship with his uncle

1743
02:05:01,875 --> 02:05:03,375
It was a big struggle.

1744
02:05:04,083 --> 02:05:07,333
Then I applied for PSC, found a good job

1745
02:05:07,541 --> 02:05:08,625
And went to her house with my 
parents to propose

1746
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:09,750
And dealt the matter.

1747
02:05:10,125 --> 02:05:11,333
Now we are settled

1748
02:05:11,625 --> 02:05:12,583
And living a happy life.

1749
02:05:13,625 --> 02:05:15,583
Even if there’s a lot of drama,

1750
02:05:15,708 --> 02:05:19,916
This is our life story

1751
02:05:21,333 --> 02:05:25,583
Dude Riyaz! You fatso!

1752
02:05:25,791 --> 02:05:27,500
You bulged after being to Gulf!

1753
02:05:28,166 --> 02:05:28,916
A little bit.

1754
02:05:29,291 --> 02:05:30,500
- Is this Ray-ban’s? 
- No, it’s mine

1755
02:05:30,625 --> 02:05:31,875
Were you hiding over here?

1756
02:05:32,208 --> 02:05:35,583
No, I was standing there 
watching your performance,

1757
02:05:35,708 --> 02:05:36,708
Performance!

1758
02:05:37,083 --> 02:05:38,666
Give me also some money, dude

1759
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:40,333
Let me also make few movies

1760
02:05:40,541 --> 02:05:41,583
Movies?

1761
02:05:42,208 --> 02:05:44,416
Film making is not an easy task

1762
02:05:44,583 --> 02:05:46,416
You need to be sensible for that!

1763
02:05:46,583 --> 02:05:47,583
Look at his joke!

1764
02:05:48,083 --> 02:05:49,541
He still has the humour sense!

1765
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:53,791
May be with this humour sense 
you tricked the Arabs in Gulf!

1766
02:05:55,083 --> 02:05:55,708
Shall we start?

1767
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:58,500
Be seated with dad, 
Mom will be back now, okay

1768
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:59,583
Come dear

1769
02:05:59,791 --> 02:06:01,208
Let’s listen to mummy’s song.

1770
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:03,875
Didn't she find anyone else to marry?

1771
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:09,500
Nithin

1772
02:06:23,083 --> 02:06:30,291
"Is it a dream, is it a story"

1773
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:36,291
"Or just a feeling"

1774
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:43,666
"Did love bloom"

1775
02:06:43,875 --> 02:06:50,291
"I did not know anything"

1776
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:51,083
Bro!

1777
02:06:57,583 --> 02:06:59,083
Congratulations, buddy

1778
02:06:59,291 --> 02:07:00,583
I forgot to wish you inside

1779
02:07:01,083 --> 02:07:02,250
Your Directorial Debut, isn’t it?

1780
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:07,083
I can sense the meaning of your smile

1781
02:07:07,541 --> 02:07:09,250
Shall I tell you 
what you thought in your mind?

1782
02:07:10,125 --> 02:07:12,125
Didn’t you think 
“This fool has won a lottery”

1783
02:07:15,291 --> 02:07:16,500
This God…

1784
02:07:16,625 --> 02:07:18,625
Sometimes play some games with humans

1785
02:07:19,166 --> 02:07:20,333
Whatever we wish for,

1786
02:07:20,541 --> 02:07:22,708
God will keep it at a distance from us

1787
02:07:23,083 --> 02:07:24,583
And when we strive and reach nearby,

1788
02:07:24,791 --> 02:07:26,416
God will keep it little farther.

1789
02:07:26,583 --> 02:07:28,166
And keep repeating same game.

1790
02:07:28,375 --> 02:07:29,458
You know why?

1791
02:07:30,083 --> 02:07:32,166
To boost one’s vigor

1792
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:39,291
Your achievement in film making 
and my marriage with Varsha

1793
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:41,583
Pertains solely to the results 
of our endeavors!

1794
02:07:42,291 --> 02:07:44,250
English people call it as Effort

1795
02:07:45,166 --> 02:07:47,791
It’s the Effort that creates Miracles, dude!

1796
02:07:49,208 --> 02:07:51,208
What happened? No one taught you about this?

1797
02:07:54,583 --> 02:07:56,083
Riyaz is in a good set up now.

1798
02:07:56,291 --> 02:07:57,333
Take that off from your ear

1799
02:07:57,541 --> 02:07:59,333
Or by the time Shoot gets over, 
Your ears will be blown away

1800
02:07:59,541 --> 02:08:00,583
- Hello.. 
- What is the matter?

1801
02:08:00,708 --> 02:08:02,125
I’m not talking to you, yeah one minute

1802
02:08:03,708 --> 02:08:04,291
Tell me..I am in Kochi now

1803
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:06,333
Shall we move, dear?

1804
02:08:06,541 --> 02:08:08,666
Let’s go and bring the Car

1805
02:08:09,583 --> 02:08:11,500
Dude! We must meet again

1806
02:08:11,625 --> 02:08:12,791
You owe a treat, friend

1807
02:08:13,916 --> 02:08:14,708
See you

1808
02:08:37,208 --> 02:08:39,333
Though there is no point in telling now..

1809
02:08:39,541 --> 02:08:40,750
It is needless of course!

1810
02:08:44,375 --> 02:08:45,750
Still I’m curious to know

1811
02:08:46,708 --> 02:08:49,291
Why did you wish to meet me before leaving?

1812
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:41,416
“To listen to the whispering 
played on the veena of silence”

1813
02:09:41,875 --> 02:09:54,708
“Are you not there in the shore 
of some moonlight”

1814
02:09:55,125 --> 02:10:01,583
“The cooing of koels on the mango branches”

1815
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:08,375
“Mingle with your cool words secretly”

1816
02:10:08,583 --> 02:10:15,208
“Don’t you see my mind?”

1817
02:10:34,125 --> 02:10:37,166
In this World, compared to the people 
who expressed their love,

1818
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:39,625
People who loved without expressing, 
are more in number!

1819
02:10:47,208 --> 02:11:00,500
“When each moon which embraces 
the eyelashes, vanish”

1820
02:11:00,625 --> 02:11:13,750
“You didn’t come 
in search of the pearl in dream’s casket”

1821
02:11:14,083 --> 02:11:20,208
"The sun rays are also raining darkness”

1822
02:11:20,625 --> 02:11:26,916
“The winter days also scorch the body”

1823
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:32,333
“I became an unspoken word”

1824
02:11:32,541 --> 02:11:39,583
“Is it a dream, is it a story”

1825
02:11:39,875 --> 02:11:45,583
“Or just a feeling”

1826
02:11:45,708 --> 02:11:53,083
“Did love bloom”

1827
02:11:53,291 --> 02:12:00,583
“I did not know anything”
