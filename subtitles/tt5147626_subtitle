7
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:25,000

-Hello.
-<i>Hello... </i>

9
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,167
<i>-Mr. Gautam?</i>
-Yes?

10
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:17,250
<i>Sir, I am calling you from</i>
<i>the Clear Sight Eye Care Center.</i>

11
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,500
<i>Your appointment is fixed</i>
<i>for 3 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

12
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,750
That’s nice. But what
appointment is this?

13
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:30,958
<i>Your vision test, sir. You had</i>
<i>asked for an appointment.</i>

14
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:35,333
I didn’t. And there is nothing
wrong with my vision.

15
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:39,583
<i>Isn’t this Mr. Gautam of</i>
<i>Beach Avenue?</i>

16
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:43,083
Yes, this is Gautam of Beach Avenue.

17
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:48,083
His vision is fine and he never
asked for an appointment.

18
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,292
First they’ll take your number
from the telephone book.

19
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:58,208
Then they will fix you an
appointment. Great!

20
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,417
Nachiketas and Me.

21
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,042
The ocean had dried up.

22
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:21,917
Men and women who had lived along
its shore had already turned to ash.

23
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:27,833
Nachiketas lay beside a
rock on the beach...

24
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,667
his body and mind eaten away
by the worms of forgetfulness.

25
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:39,792
Often in the form of the wind,

26
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:43,417
I fed him his daily dose of life breath.

27
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,375
Sometimes, as the sweat of dying trees,

28
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:54,042
I fed him salt.

29
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,917
Once, he entreated the skies

30
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,208
to ease his pain...

31
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:08,250
and to muffle his thinking with
the electrical displays of rain.

32
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,375
But I stood in the way of the storm...

33
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:19,083
and guarded him with my own body...

34
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,875
watching over him like
the apple of my eye.

35
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:29,125
Like an animal that had
forgotten to blink.

36
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I came alone. Can I come in?

37
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,667
Oh yes, of course. Come in.

38
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,750
Suitcase?

39
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,792
It’s a bit of a story. Can I bring it in?

40
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,333
Yes, sure.

41
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,625
Have a seat.

42
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:42,917
Guttoo... I’ve been thrown
out of my house.

43
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:46,667
The landlord is a real
bast... bad guy.

44
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,625
Yes, they usually are.

45
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,250
My roommates and I owed
him a few months’ rent.

46
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:57,583
I mean, it’s not like we
didn’t intend to pay.

47
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,625
In short... can I stay
here for one day?

48
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,500
I’ll have another place by tomorrow.

49
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,250
Or the day after.

50
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,208
Surely not more than three days.

51
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,375
What about rent, Vishaya?

52
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:21,333
Yes, if you’ll sign a contract
to let me stay for a year.

53
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,667
No way. Three days is fine. Free!

54
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,500
Thank you, thank you, Guttoo!

55
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,458
So, what have you been writing?

56
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,250
Tell me, did you think of me? At all?

57
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:42,083
But tell me, how did you find
my house?

58
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,417
There’s only one writer on Beach
Avenue. Everyone knows.

59
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,708
Come, let me show you your room.

60
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:03,625
Wow... this is so beautiful!

61
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,792
I just love it!

62
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,417
Here's your room.

63
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,875
You saved my honor, Guttoo.

64
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:32,500
I had a bet with my friends
that you'd let me stay.

65
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,292
Thanks, Guttoo.

66
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,875
Freshen up if you like. I’ll get coffee.

67
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,375
Okay.

68
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:04,250
I didn’t realize it was this late.
Fell asleep.

69
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,375
Come, I have a surprise for you.

70
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,333
-Surprise?
-Yes, come.

71
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,333
I really don’t know what to say.

72
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:47,542
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...

73
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:52,333
-Happy birthday, dear Vishaya...
-Thank you.

74
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:08,542
I've read somewhere, Guttoo...

75
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:14,125
that every birthday
is like being reborn.

76
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,625
Reborn?

77
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,417
Yes... like a new vision.

78
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,125
Like starting on a new journey.

79
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,667
Meeting friends we've never met before.

80
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,917
Then this could be a birthday for me too.

81
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,292
One where I meet a new friend.

82
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,083
Young enough to be my granddaughter.

83
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,042
But you don’t have a granddaughter.

84
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,792
You didn't even marry, remember?

85
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,750
To you then, my new friend.

86
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:53,542
To you, my friend who came in
from the darkness.

87
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:07,792
This is the most touching
birthday gift I ever got.

88
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,375
Unexpected kindness.

89
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,958
Thanks, Guttoo.

90
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,667
Guttoo, you said you'd show
me your novel.

91
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:34,083
Not now. I don't want to
bore you tonight.

92
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,292
No, now is the time!

93
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,167
Come. Come on!
Come.

94
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,375
"Eternity.

95
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:57,542
When I speak of eternity
an image rises to mind.

96
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:03,792
That of a seashore, deserted and calm
with an unending stream of waves…

97
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,833
and on that shore, bedded in the shingle
is a chair and on that chair is…

98
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,625
an ancient man a little older
than time itself.

99
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:19,333
Nachiketas is that man of withered frame
quivering from the cold, wet wind.

100
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,667
He is the keeper of history, the teller
of stories, the protector of time itself.

101
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:31,417
Sometimes people waited long hours

102
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,917
just to catch a moment
with him on the shore.

103
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,792
He would never pay them any attention

104
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,542
but they loved to be nearby...

105
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:52,125
to touch him and to sit in a circle
around him as he sat in the sand,

106
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,458
resting after long hours of
cleaning the beach.

107
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:05,375
Some would have washed out his
clothes or brought new ones.

108
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,708
But he never spoke to anyone.

109
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:13,458
At times he rambled in strange,
foreign tongues.

110
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,333
Words which he alone understood.

111
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,792
So, I’ve shown you my work. Happy?

112
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,750
-Yes, indeed.
-Like it? Is it good?

113
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,625
Well, it is...

114
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,917
We are friends. So tell me
what you really think.

115
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,208
Okay, Guttoo.

116
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,167
I’ll be honest with you.

117
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,542
Yes, please.

118
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,125
Guttoo, these are just empty words.

119
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,583
Kind of, 'being clever with words.'

120
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,750
You think so? Why?

121
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,167
Because I don’t think even you know

122
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,375
what you are talking about.

123
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,792
Sorry if I hurt you.

124
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:18,875
But I think I owe you the truth.

125
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:29,167
-Good night.
-Good night.

126
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,917
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

127
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,292
Back from your walk?

128
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:07,000
-Oh yes. Did you sleep all right?
-Like a log.

129
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,292
But I woke up early.

130
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,542
I shouldn’t have touched the laptop
without asking you. Sorry.

131
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,458
I was just checking my mail.

132
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,917
Not an issue.

133
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,500
Vishaya, I had an interesting dream.

134
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,250
What'll you have for breakfast?
Omelet and toast?

135
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,500
Not toast. Omelet is fine.

136
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,125
Oh! Don’t you like toast?

137
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:32,750
I don’t mind. But I like
to make them myself.

138
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:39,417
I want them warmed slow, with butter.
That way they turn out crispier.

139
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,333
Shall I shut down the laptop?

140
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,500
No, leave it on.

141
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:49,292
I could write a bit, seeing as I am
up and feeling good.

142
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,958
You know, Guttoo, you remind me
of my granddad.

143
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,792
No, you aren’t that old, it’s not that.

144
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,583
It’s the tone of your voice,
the way you talk.

145
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:05,625
-I don’t know. Anyway...
-Is that a compliment?

146
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:14,292
Guttoo... I did a terrible thing.

147
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,667
Promise me you won’t be angry.

148
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,708
First tell me what you’ve done.
I’ll promise later.

149
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:24,500
No. Promise me first. I’ll tell you after.

150
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,708
Okay. I promise. Now, what
have you done?

151
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:34,333
Guttoo, I erased it.

152
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,083
I am sorry. I am sorry.

153
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,958
Please don’t be angry with me.

154
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,042
What have you erased?

155
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,292
Your book! I am sorry.

156
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,792
Please don’t scold me.

157
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,083
What have you done?
What do I do now?

158
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,708
You promised me you won’t get angry.

159
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,583
No, I am not angry.

160
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,125
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

161
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,167
How dare you?!

162
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,958
I am sorry, Guttoo. I just had to do it.

163
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,000
Please forgive me.

164
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,000
You deserve a good thrashing.

165
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,625
Who are you?
What are you up to?

166
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,333
Didn’t you hear me? Who are you?

167
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,583
You know me.

168
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:28,042
Why are you treating me
like a stranger?

169
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,250
I think you don’t like me at all.

170
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,000
Maybe you want me to leave.

171
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,542
It’s not about liking you or not.

172
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,125
I want to know what your game is.

173
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:50,083
You came into my house and now
you are trying to destroy my life.

174
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,750
Tell me. Who sent you here?

175
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,667
I did not destroy your life.

176
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:02,417
I only destroyed some stuff
you had written.

177
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,708
Just some meaningless words.

178
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,167
You know it yourself.

179
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:17,292
But you refuse to accept it because
you're a known writer.

180
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:22,333
I may not be a world class writer.

181
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,792
Some of what I’ve written
may not even be good.

182
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:30,417
But destroying it? What’s that!

183
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,250
You should've burnt it all
yourself, Guttoo.

184
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,375
But you didn’t.

185
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,708
So, I did. Somebody had to.

186
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,958
We look great together, don’t we?

187
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,458
Take one of that bonfire too.

188
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:11,250
There may never be another like it again.

189
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,792
Vishaya!

190
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,167
I am sorry. I was looking at...

191
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,875
no, looking for you.

192
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:32,208
-Sorry. I’ll wait.
-It’s okay. It’s okay!

193
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,542
It just happened. It was
completely by accident.

194
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,417
I didn’t have the slightest...

195
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,833
It’s okay.

196
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,375
What did you do? Nothing.

197
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,625
Anyway, what’s wrong with
seeing a girl naked?

198
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,958
Tell me Guttoo,
why didn’t you marry?

199
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,708
I very nearly did.

200
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,167
Luckily she broke off the engagement.

201
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:37,750
She was from up north. Sensible girl!

202
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,542
She realized it was better to jump
before the going got tough.

203
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,708
But why? What went wrong?

204
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:49,458
Another guy. She ran off
with my best friend.

205
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,625
Oh. I am sorry to hear that.

206
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,625
I am not sorry at all.

207
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:59,833
I am glad to let another man
suffer in my place.

208
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:08,625
Guttoo, I think you are very hurt inside.

209
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,500
You poor thing!

210
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,875
Am I? I don’t think so.

211
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:17,583
I think I made it through unscathed.

212
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:31,042
38 steps. Long veranda.

213
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,500
You have a beautiful house, Guttoo.

214
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,542
Look what you’ve done.

215
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,625
My story, my words... all gone.

216
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't feel like reading, either.

217
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:48,375
I am bored. There is nothing to do.

218
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,958
Just relax, enjoy the weather.

219
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,375
Or, enjoy my company.

220
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:06,250
You don’t have to write
books to enjoy life.

221
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,083
You only have to live it.

222
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,792
You're surely better than any book.

223
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,458
Guttoo!

224
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:28,042
What are you going to burn
this time, you little devil?

225
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,125
You!

226
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:58,750
Your eyes are magic.

227
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,083
Flatterer!

228
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:12,208
I am sorry... I mustn't.

229
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,917
Why? What’s the matter?

230
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,042
I am an old man...

231
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:25,292
I shouldn’t be doing this.

232
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:32,042
Guttoo, what has age got to
do with this?

233
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,583
Do you like me, Guttoo?

234
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:42,208
Yes I do. Very much.

235
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,583
In fact, I want you so bad. But...

236
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,833
Guttoo...

237
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,250
this is love.

238
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,583
This longing...

239
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,500
This is the real thing, Guttoo.

240
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:15,000
Everything else is just words.

241
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,000
Empty words.

242
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,125
Who is this now?

243
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,542
I am not buying anything.
Please leave.

244
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,125
I am not selling anything, sir.

245
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:56,792
I just need some water, and a rag.

246
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,167
My car broke down.

247
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,917
Managed to fix it.
But got my hands all dirty.

248
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,667
I only need to wash my hands.

249
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,458
And, if you don’t mind, a glass of water.

250
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,417
All right, come in.

251
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,167
I live far away.

252
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,167
I was driving through
when this happened.

253
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,917
-Lovely house.
-Aren't you done?

254
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,625
In a moment, sir.

255
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,583
Your grandchild?

256
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,875
No, my wife. What’s your problem?

257
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,875
I am sorry, sir. No offence meant.

258
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:12,042
-None taken.
-Tea is ready!

259
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,875
Well… join us.

260
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,333
I too am from around here.

261
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,167
We lived here for many years.

262
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:26,792
I see...

263
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:30,333
When my parents died, I inherited
the family home.

264
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,167
It’s on top of a hill. An estate.

265
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,375
Sorry to hear about your parents, Rahul.
It’s Rahul, right?

266
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,958
Both parents gone. That's sad.

267
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,542
Yes, in an accident.

268
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:56,583
The estate is large and rather lonely.
But I love it.

269
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:57,917
Where is it?

270
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:59,625
Perancode.

271
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:00,875
Rubber plantation?

272
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:06,083
Among other things. There’s a wild garden
and a view of the entire city.

273
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,458
Hills all around.

274
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,292
You'll like it.

275
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:19,708
There is quite nothing like living
in a house on a hill.

276
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:24,875
The wind, the lightning... Everything
is so good there.

277
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,625
You have to see it to believe it.

278
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,917
Yes, maybe sometime.

279
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,375
When I built this house, I liked it here.

280
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:36,750
It’s set on a slope and at odd levels.
I loved the feel of it.

281
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,833
But that's all gone.

282
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,875
Now, I’d like to live somewhere more open.

283
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,375
Away from all these salesmen
knocking on your door.

284
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,667
That’s my place sir.

285
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,250
You won’t see a salesman
in your life.

286
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:58,417
-More tea?
-Yes, please.

287
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:06,917
Oh, thank you.

288
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:29,833
I'll be going now. Thanks for the help.

289
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:34,458
I’ll come back later and take you home.
You’ll like it, sir.

290
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,500
No hurry at all.

291
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,375
Next month, maybe.

292
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,875
-You really will love it!
-Strange fellow, indeed.

293
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,333
You know, for years I lived in Delhi.

294
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:54,250
I lived in a place which was full of
ambassadors and princes.

295
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,542
The house belonged to a friend of mine.

296
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:00,042
The only thing I missed
there was the sea.

297
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:02,458
The sea is my weakness.

298
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,875
Were you an ambassador too?

299
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,375
You’re funny!

300
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,625
I was a scribe. For the
New India Times.

301
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,875
Covering politics.

302
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,458
That's when my first book was published,
‘Angels of Dynasty.’

303
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,000
Sorry, never heard of it.

304
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,958
Good. Or you’d have burnt that too!

305
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,000
Probably, yes.

306
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,958
You know, I love teaching. I became
a Professor of English.

307
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,125
Incidentally, that was when I began
to write in Malayalam.

308
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:40,500
I discovered that even if you live a
thousand miles away...

309
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:44,667
from your native land, you can never
forget your mother tongue.

310
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:48,458
Anyway, after twenty long years in Delhi,
the exile returned to Kerala.

311
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:49,792
Your parents?

312
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,667
One of the reasons I came back.

313
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:55,750
Mother’s death, father’s illness.

314
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,708
So, how is the place?

315
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,083
This lake looks so peaceful,

316
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,917
so silent.

317
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:16,042
But it’s like the human mind.
Deep and troubled.

318
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:19,875
It fills me with fear, just to look at it.

319
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,375
No fear for me. I can swim.

320
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:30,792
I can swim too. I don’t think
I'd drown if I fell into it.

321
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:35,750
But the fear is still there.
A kind of dread.

322
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,083
So, where are you?

323
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,417
Aren’t you feeling well?

324
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,250
I guess it’s only beginning
to sink in now.

325
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,958
That I am here with you?

326
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,917
No, that my work has been destroyed.

327
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:01,375
That you think I am no good as a writer.

328
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,917
Guttoo, perhaps what hurts you more
is the second thing.

329
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,083
The first one does too.

330
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,333
How am I ever going to write that book?

331
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,750
So many books have come and gone.

332
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,542
Why worry about that?

333
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:21,333
I am finished. You’ve ruined me.

334
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,250
What is a writer without his work?

335
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,042
Just relax, Guttoo.

336
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,667
Should I be taking psychology
lessons from you?

337
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:38,583
No, but you can take some in
happiness from me.

338
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,292
At least, I am not unhappy like you.

339
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,958
I too was happy at your age.
It’s called youth.

340
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:56,458
I don’t think you can understand
a writer’s mind.

341
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,625
I am not blaming you.

342
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:04,125
The emptiness, the sorrow...

343
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:09,000
I overcame
it all with my writing.

344
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:11,583
Writing is my boat to happiness.

345
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:19,083
I love it when people feel uplifted
by what I write.

346
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:24,583
Maybe. I don’t know about all that.

347
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,458
But I think,

348
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:34,542
Guttoo, you write because
you love it when readers praise you.

349
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,167
Praise? What do I care about praise!

350
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:42,250
I am too old for all that.

351
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,667
All I know is how to write.

352
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:49,167
And so, I keep writing and writing.

353
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:52,542
Guttoo, I’ll be right back.

354
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:54,458
Need to take a shower.

355
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:00,375
I love the feel of water
falling on my skin.

356
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,792
I just love it.

357
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,583
And listen, I won't come peeping.

358
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,583
See you soon.

359
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,958
I am here, sir. Down here.

360
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:57,125
What a bother!

361
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,750
-I came back.
-So I see.

362
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,833
So, shall we go?

363
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,583
Go? Where to?

364
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,250
My home, sir. Have you forgotten?

365
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,917
Rahul, I already told you we can go
some other day. Not today.

366
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,667
You said you'd come with me.

367
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,292
I said I'd come. But some other day.

368
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,625
Why not today? Today is as
good a day as any.

369
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,875
In fact, there’s no day like today.

370
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:30,042
Not today. I have other plans.

371
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:35,250
I changed all my plans for you, sir.

372
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,375
I even drove all the way
back just for you.

373
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,083
Don't cheat me now.

374
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:43,458
Cheat you? What do you mean?

375
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,000
You made me come back. And suddenly
you change your mind.

376
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,583
Isn’t that cheating?

377
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,208
I didn’t ask you to pick me up.

378
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:54,167
I didn’t even promise to come with you.

379
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,708
Didn’t you say you wanted to see my house?

380
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:00,083
I did.

381
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,708
-See what I mean?
-What?

382
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,000
So, are you calling me a liar?

383
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,125
Look, Mister...

384
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,833
Don’t ‘mister’ me. Get ready to leave.

385
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,083
Are you out of your mind?

386
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:17,833
I told you politely, but you won’t listen.

387
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,667
Good, now get your hands behind you.

388
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,458
If you try to hurt the girl,
I’ll kill you.

389
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:23,042
Yes, of course. I know you will.

390
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,792
But why would I hurt her?

391
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:32,042
You're the one who wanted to see
my house. So you come.

392
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,167
You're not hurt, I hope.

393
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:38,667
You’re old enough to be my granddad.

394
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,500
So don’t you die on me.

395
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,208
Drink up. You have a long ride ahead.

396
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:55,250
Can’t have you yelling on the way.

397
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,833
Good...

398
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,917
Now let’s go.

399
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,958
Climb into my vehicle.

400
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:11,625
Meanwhile, let me go rape that girl.
Where is she?

401
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:22,500
Joking, old man. I don’t need to do that.

402
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:27,000
Shall we leave?

403
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:37,125
Move!

404
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:13,875
I am going to cover you up.
You won’t die.

405
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:19,208
But if you try to jump off or something,
you will.

406
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:24,417
Wake up. writer!

407
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,208
So, do you like the place?

408
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,250
You’ll like it soon enough.

409
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:05,750
It has a charm of its own.

410
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,125
Give it a couple of days.

411
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,875
Don’t look so glum, old man.

412
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,292
To look at you, one would think someone
has taken you prisoner.

413
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:23,458
No one is going to hurt you,
unless you ask for it.

414
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:44,292
What do you want?

415
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,625
Who are you?

416
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:55,667
That’s a good question. ‘Who are you?’

417
00:48:57,083 --> 00:49:02,333
But in here, I ask all the
questions. For now.

418
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,667
So, home at last.

419
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:01,375
Feel free here.

420
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:07,208
Roam around all you wish.

421
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:19,500
Your room.

422
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:23,542
See, I’ve set up everything to
make you comfortable.

423
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,250
Get moving, old man.

424
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,917
You can stay here for as long as you wish.

425
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:43,250
But remember this, I am what you are.

426
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:47,625
You play decent, I’ll be decent.

427
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:51,167
You play funny...

428
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:58,750
that’ll be the end of you.

429
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,458
Come, my friend. Let me
show you something.

430
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:33,792
Come on.

431
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,542
Come up.

432
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,833
You can climb, can’t you?

433
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:58,417
Why should I follow you?

434
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,667
That’s up to you.

435
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:05,625
Come up, and I’ll show you
the way to freedom.

436
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,000
Want a hand?

437
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:33,375
I don’t need your help.
I can get there myself.

438
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:37,375
Whoa! Man of spirit!

439
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,208
Shall I kick you in your ugly face?

440
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,083
Just joking, old man.

441
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,542
We have a deal.

442
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:54,417
You act decent with me,
I don’t hurt you.

443
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,167
Why did you bring me here?

444
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:29,000
Who are you? What do you want?

445
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,792
You can ask only one question a day.

446
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:42,167
Your question: Why did I bring you here?
Okay, listen.

447
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:48,583
For all your wisdom and all the books
you have written, you’re stupid.

448
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,833
You’re not here because of me.

449
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:57,667
You’re here because you
wanted to see my house.

450
00:54:57,792 --> 00:55:01,042
Stop repeating that nonsense.
I am not a fool.

451
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:07,167
You don't know a thing.
You only think you do.

452
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:11,625
Your head is full of second-hand ideas
picked up from others.

453
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,917
And you think it's some kind of knowledge.

454
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:21,375
Your life is actually one big lie.

455
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:26,458
Each morning you put on your
pious face and go around...

456
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:30,500
hiding all the pain and anger
that’s raging inside you.

457
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:36,125
And as if that weren't enough,
you write books too.

458
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:43,458
You collect bones chewed up by others and
dish them out as wisdom.

459
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,000
That’s your opinion.

460
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:49,375
Right, so listen to this too.

461
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:55,833
You think you’re God’s gift to mankind.

462
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,875
Actually, you’re just another bag of shit.

463
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:05,125
Just like me!

464
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,250
If you can understand this,
you’re a free man!

465
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,167
Wake up, young man!

466
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,542
-It’s you!
-Yes. Happy to see me?

467
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:52,250
Of course.

468
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:54,875
And he?

469
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,417
Who? Rahul?

470
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,583
You know him from before?

471
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:03,375
Of course. We're friends.

472
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:06,917
So, it was a setup.

473
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,833
You are working together on this.

474
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:38,208
Eat, my friend. You must be hungry.

475
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:42,000
These fellows make the best dosa
and curry for miles around.

476
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:56,417
You’ve been fooling me. The two of you.

477
01:01:57,542 --> 01:02:02,625
Fooling? It was you who wanted
a change. Amazing curry.

478
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:05,875
Like a fool I walked into your trap.

479
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:16,042
Don’t look so sad Guttoo.

480
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:19,042
We’re your friends.

481
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:25,708
Vishaya told me all about you.

482
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:29,250
Quite a bull, aren’t you?

483
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,250
Come on, Rahul!

484
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:35,292
Guttoo is a good man. I like him.

485
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,833
Okay, so you like him.

486
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:41,208
But he hates you enough to kill you.

487
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:44,458
Look at that face!

488
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,583
Not hungry!

489
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,125
Closer.

490
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:31,333
Why not?

491
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,375
No, Guttoo.

492
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,417
But you can roll all over him?

493
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,125
But Rahul is my boyfriend!

494
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,833
What’s the game?

495
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,083
Don’t be angry with me, Guttoo.

496
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:52,083
Guttoo?! Stop calling me that
ridiculous name.

497
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:56,250
I am old enough to be your grandad.

498
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,000
Don’t get upset, Guttoo.

499
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,542
This is like a dream.

500
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,417
A dream which can wake us up.

501
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,125
Don’t try to teach me.

502
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:15,167
I am an old dog. I won't learn new tricks.

503
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:20,208
And forget the pop psychology.
I’ve heard enough of that.

504
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,792
You're still carrying old hurts and aches.

505
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,417
But you won’t accept it.

506
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,833
Now I know what your problem is.

507
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:39,417
One man isn’t enough for you!

508
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:46,333
We can talk later, when you're
a bit less angry.

509
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:52,958
You think I am jealous of that fellow?
I am not.

510
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:57,667
I’ve seen too much of life to be jealous.

511
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,208
I can handle my emotions well.
Very well.

512
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:05,167
It’s quite clear now. You're with him.

513
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:08,417
Then don’t come shaking your stuff
in front of me again.

514
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,417
I am not with him, Guttoo.

515
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:16,625
Actually, we’re both with you.

516
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,417
I know.

517
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:07,292
The moment their leader sat at my head,
I knew my plan would work.

518
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,917
I just lay there with my eyes closed
as if I were fast asleep.

519
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,625
And then?

520
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:16,458
Maybe five minutes. That’s all it took.

521
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:20,625
Guttoo...

522
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:35,417
What do you want now?

523
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,583
You poor thing!

524
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:40,542
Don’t ‘poor thing’ me.

525
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:46,125
I can ask Rahul to let you roam
around freely on the grounds.

526
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:50,125
It’s not as if you’re going to run away.

527
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:54,625
What if I run away?
Will you shoot me down?

528
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,208
I don’t need your help.

529
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:00,167
I can fend for myself quite well.

530
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:06,542
I was doing just that when the
two of you broke into my life.

531
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:13,583
When all this is over, who knows Guttoo,
you may even thank us.

532
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,333
Thanks?

533
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,083
For wrecking my quiet life?

534
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:21,458
Or for ruining my happiness?

535
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:26,458
Happiness, Guttoo? You weren’t happy.

536
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:34,458
And a quiet life? That's no big deal.

537
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:41,583
It’s just a routine which life
imposes on lonely people.

538
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:44,792
If I was lonely and unhappy,
that's my business.

539
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,375
Look, I am not some old fashioned prude.

540
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,667
I’ve been to places and lived life.

541
01:07:54,875 --> 01:08:01,042
I am not like the two of you.
I believe in the virtues of life.

542
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,917
-Virtues?
-Vishaya!

543
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:07,958
At your age, and with the
kind of life you lead...

544
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:12,958
you won’t even understand
the meaning of 'virtue.'

545
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:20,708
Perhaps virtue is just a mask
created by the mind.

546
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:25,042
A mask behind which
the mind can hide.

547
01:11:57,583 --> 01:12:00,000
Oh, you are up?

548
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:02,667
You woke me up, didn’t you?

549
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,125
Me? Why would I?

550
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,583
I don’t know. You tell me.

551
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:11,458
You're the one who walked around naked.

552
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,042
I did what?

553
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:16,500
Guttoo, you must’ve been dreaming.

554
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,292
You're beautiful.

555
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,292
Thanks.

556
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:25,792
Have you been on the balcony?

557
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:32,917
It’s very nice. So is this window.
My favorite place to read.

558
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,042
Give me a kiss, beautiful.

559
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:39,667
No, Guttoo. You know I can’t do that.

560
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,417
You can’t? Why not?

561
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:45,333
We did a lot more that afternoon.

562
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:48,208
That was different. That was...

563
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,792
I won’t let you go, Vishaya.

564
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:53,208
This time you are mine.

565
01:12:53,292 --> 01:12:55,792
No Guttoo. This is not right.
Let me go.

566
01:12:55,917 --> 01:12:57,875
Please!

567
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,000
What’s wrong?

568
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:02,042
Is it that you don’t
fancy it in the morning?

569
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:03,750
Calm down, I say!

570
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,750
This is no way to behave with a woman.

571
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:08,417
So, now you’re playing hard to get?

572
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,375
Stop right now, or
you’ll be sorry for this.

573
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,750
We’ve done this before.
So what’s the big deal now?

574
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:18,125
Now you’re asking for it!

575
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:24,250
You dare slap me?! You bitch!

576
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:29,958
Have you any idea what you’re doing?

577
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,250
You will regret this!

578
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:36,625
Stop trying to act like a teacher.
You’re just a whore...

579
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:39,875
making out with every hick in town.

580
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:45,958
Wow. That’s very nice indeed.

581
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:56,750
Now, don't you see what you really are?

582
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:15,667
-Get up, now. Have this.
-No.

583
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,583
Mother!

584
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:09,542
Cover me in the sweet perfume
of your kisses.

585
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:14,875
Tell everyone that, at last, you're
willing to push me out.

586
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:23,250
Even though it breaks your poor heart
to know that you are sending me...

587
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:28,125
without armor and mask,
into a world seething with

588
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:31,708
horrid lies and sex.

589
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:37,000
Tell them you are crying because
the water of your disenchantment

590
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:41,292
has broken and finds its way
through your blazing eyes.

591
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:45,042
Tell them the river of death
has passed us by.

592
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:50,250
Tell them they can come back
tomorrow to look at me

593
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,333
to hold me and tickle me on
the cheek, if they wish.

594
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:59,083
Tell them you have set me free,
like the smoke

595
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:03,500
which is held in an unlit cigar

596
01:16:03,917 --> 01:16:07,500
under orange trees. In summer.

597
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:29,708
Do you think you’re still 20?

598
01:23:36,542 --> 01:23:40,083
Get a move on, you old thing.

599
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:47,542
I want this rope in my room.
In 5 minutes, flat.

600
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:55,917
That’s the wrong end, dumbass.
Untie it from the top.

601
01:23:56,958 --> 01:24:01,333
Have the boxes tied up by morning.

602
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:06,625
I’ll come checking. You hear that?

603
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,667
Say ‘yes’, dammit!

604
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,042
Yes.

605
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:17,625
If you ever touch this rope again…

606
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:25,167
that’ll be the end of you.

607
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,958
I’ll hang you with it.

608
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,417
Right here... Get that?

609
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,917
Yes.

610
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:32,250
You shouldn’t have...

611
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:35,958
Please. Say nothing…

612
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:38,708
I made a mistake. Big mistake.

613
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,917
Yes, why did you try to escape?

614
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:46,250
I meant the other thing.
What I did to you.

615
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:49,542
I am really sorry.

616
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:52,625
I know. I know you are.

617
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:58,167
Why are you with this fellow?
Who is he?

618
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:02,417
You don’t belong together.

619
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:07,375
We do! We very much belong together.

620
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:09,458
Who is he?

621
01:26:09,542 --> 01:26:11,833
That’s something you've
to figure out, Guttoo.

622
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,708
Could he be a student of mine,
someone I’ve forgotten?

623
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:19,708
I certainly never fathered a child.

624
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,083
Are you that certain?

625
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:29,083
Don’t worry, he’s not your son.

626
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:34,750
Vishaya, leave him and come with me.

627
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,917
Let's escape from here.

628
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,917
We can live in my house.

629
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:43,833
I'll never hurt you again. Promise.

630
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:48,708
No, Guttoo. That’s impossible.

631
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:56,042
Besides, that’s not the
point of this story.

632
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:00,417
-Story?
-Yes. This story.

633
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,625
Want some tea?

634
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,708
No, thanks.

635
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:31,458
There's some left.

636
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:51,708
Sure you don’t want any?

637
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,583
Give me a sip then.

638
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,833
He seems badly hurt.

639
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:08,000
Who? Oh him.

640
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:13,042
He had it coming.
It’s always like that.

641
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:16,125
They don’t get it till it hits them hard.

642
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:21,000
He wants me to leave you
and go with him.

643
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:24,625
I thought as much.

644
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:28,667
You know, he apologized to me.

645
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:35,625
For desiring you? Or for the manner
in which he showed his desire?

646
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:43,667
I don’t think he knows the difference.

647
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:50,333
I don’t think he even knows
there is such a difference.

648
01:29:00,417 --> 01:29:04,250
Wake up! We have some talking to do.
Up! Up!

649
01:29:12,542 --> 01:29:14,000
What do you want?

650
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:15,875
Let me cheer you up.

651
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,667
I see that you’ve been
feeling a bit down.

652
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,500
Buck up.

653
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:25,167
You really hate me, don’t you?

654
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:29,292
No. I don’t. But I pity you.

655
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:32,625
That’s what I said. You hate me.

656
01:29:33,792 --> 01:29:37,167
So pity and hate are the same for you.

657
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:40,833
Are you drunk?

658
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:45,083
You really are a funny one.

659
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:51,667
Attempted rapist, hater,
prospective murderer.

660
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:55,333
And still you go about
with your saint’s face.

661
01:29:58,083 --> 01:30:01,208
See? Now you are acting again.

662
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,625
Acting the part of the injured soul.

663
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:09,000
You have the look of a dog which
has been whipped. Why?

664
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:15,500
True, I beat you up,
but you had it coming.

665
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:23,375
If you act funny with my girl,
I’ll kick your balls in.

666
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:47,083
Where is he?

667
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:56,458
What’s up?

668
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:01,750
Close your eyes.
I have something to show you.

669
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,125
What is it?

670
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:05,792
Proof.

671
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,625
Everything is falling into place.

672
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:11,292
Close your eyes first.

673
01:31:11,792 --> 01:31:12,958
Okay.

674
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,458
Now see for yourself.

675
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:29,625
Who are they? What’s this all about?

676
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:32,833
It’s us! You and me.

677
01:31:33,667 --> 01:31:36,792
Guttoo, what’re you saying?

678
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:41,750
Of course it’s not us.

679
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:43,958
It’s not even me.

680
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,250
This is you. And this is me.

681
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:52,125
Don’t try to fool me.
Don’t be so blind, Vishaya.

682
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:57,750
You belong with me. You are mine.

683
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,917
You’re going to be set free.

684
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:30,333
What’s the game now?

685
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:34,167
I’ll let you go if you admit
that you hate me.

686
01:32:34,792 --> 01:32:39,583
I told you I don’t hate you.
I only pity you.

687
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:41,542
Not just that you hate me.

688
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,333
But that
you hate me enough to kill me.

689
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,708
Do that, and you can leave.

690
01:32:48,167 --> 01:32:51,583
Nobody can save you.
You're a damned soul.

691
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:55,625
Accepted. But that’s not
what I asked you.

692
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:59,625
Come on. At least,
call me a few names.

693
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:04,667
Come on.

694
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:09,667
Can’t you really see anything?

695
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:12,875
I can see through your trick.

696
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:16,292
You want to make me do something
against my conscience.

697
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:18,875
I won't do that
even if you try to kill me.

698
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:23,458
All my life, I tried to understand
virtue and to live by it.

699
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:26,208
You’re on a different track.

700
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:29,417
This freedom that you offer me…

701
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:32,167
I don’t want it!

702
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:38,750
Stupid fool.

703
01:34:00,417 --> 01:34:02,500
It’s so quiet...

704
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:07,125
Yes... Indeed.

705
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:29,333
I was once walking along a
deserted beach.

706
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:33,333
Suddenly,

707
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:39,708
I saw a woman sitting
near a pile of rocks.

708
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:47,208
Three or four people were sitting
on the sand around her.

709
01:34:49,167 --> 01:34:51,333
There were a few dogs too.

710
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:58,583
She was naked, she was alone.

711
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:04,833
A man offered her something to eat.

712
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:11,833
She accepted it, and began
feeding everyone.

713
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:20,000
First the dogs and then the people.

714
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:25,750
Without any distinction.

715
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:32,917
She saw me looking at her and paused.

716
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:45,417
In her eyes I saw unimaginable kindness.

717
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:52,625
Compassion.

718
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:04,333
Everything went silent...

719
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,875
and I began to cry.

720
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:16,292
You know what, you’re beautiful.

721
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:18,333
So are you.

722
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:29,833
I am going to the balcony.
Want to come?

723
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:35,542
No, you go on. I think I’ll sleep.

724
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:50,042
Guttoo!
