Kichu!

00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,932
Don't be so arrogant!

49
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,059
When you prepare food, why
can't you make it clean?

50
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,236
Hey Kichu!

51
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,601
Where are you going?
- I'm leaving!

52
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,232
Have dinner <i>&</i> go!
- I don't want dinner!

53
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,838
Where are you off
to, at midnight?

54
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,923
Elm
E

55
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,219
Pour some water for him!

56
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,089
- The chicken down
there; put it in!

57
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,665
You want Dosa, right?
- Huh?

58
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,035
- Dosa, right?

59
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,536
Ya.

60
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,903
Shall I serve chicken too?
- Ya.

61
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,012
Yes, Mahesh!
- Where are you Kichu?

62
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,739
I've been waiting for so long!

63
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:26,748
In.

64
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,750
I have reached the town.
I'll come rig ht now.

65
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,809
I'm having food.

66
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,048
Oh! Is it?

67
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,215
When I'm starving
here waiting for you,

68
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,656
you're sitting there <i>&</i> hogging?

69
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,886
Oh! You didn't have food?

70
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,584
Since it's so late, I thought.

71
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,661
Where are you now?
I'll come there.

72
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,065
Inna

73
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,632
No.
I'm done here.

74
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,996
I'll get a parcel.

75
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,595
OK?
By e.

76
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,868
What do you want as parcel?
Dosa?

77
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,238
Ya.
- Shall I keep some chicken too?

78
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,276
No! No!

79
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,871
Just pack Dosa <i>&</i> Chutney alone!

80
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,975
You don't have soap here?

81
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,019
Hey!

82
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,848
Most people don't use
soap these days.

83
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,956
People like their hands
to be oily after eating.

84
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,288
The smell of masala, rig ht?

85
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,597
Evenl like it!

86
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,665
But not today.

87
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,701
You could've bought
an omelette at least!

88
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,710
Dude, they didn't have any!
I swear! It was over.

89
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,870
What did you eat?

90
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,044
Me?
Dosa & Chutney!

91
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,681
I swear!

92
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,353
What is it?

93
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,250
You had Dosa made
of soap or what?

94
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,756
Stop kidding and eat it fast!

95
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,019
We have to plan our activities.

96
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,690
- Maybe my nose went wrong!

97
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,729
- He won't lie!

98
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,157
Mahesh, do you know what are the basic
qualities that a politician should have?

99
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,069
Well.. The people..

100
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,737
It's not about the people!

101
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,340
Pay attention!

102
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,309
Point No.1

103
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,581
We should have a complete sense
of our skills and the belief in them!

104
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,617
We should believe that
whatever we do is rig ht!

105
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,051
Two.

106
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,621
We should also have a complete
sense of our limitations.

107
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,619
We should realize that we are not
skilled in certain fields.

108
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,156
But don't ignore them!
- No!

109
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,297
We should figure out how to
overcome those limitations.

110
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,694
So what about thick skin?

111
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,330
That's a usage coined by
mimicry artists to mock us!

112
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,368
Is it?

113
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,961
Actually, that's not related
to being thick skinned!

114
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,674
It's all about our
self-confidence!

115
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,138
The self-confidence that
our lives won't be spoiled

116
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,202
just because of some
allegation or charge-sheet.

117
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,974
Even if the world falls apart,

118
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,912
don't step down from
positions of power.

119
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,314
Just say that there's no proof or
that the law is taking its course.

120
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,618
Done!

121
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,058
Three.

122
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,425
The ability to fall on four
legs, however we fall!

123
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,930
Or, the attitude to say that if we
catch a rabbit, it will have 3 horns!

124
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,734
Why did you say that now?

125
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,232
Hold your horses!

126
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,765
That's the 4th quality.

127
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,973
Whoever says whatever, don't react
or make a statement immediately!

128
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,109
Next is the fifth one.

129
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,238
The reason we are here today.

130
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,285
Whoever becomes an
obstacle in our path,

131
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,312
we should eliminate
them at the right time!

132
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,420
If we keep it for later, we
might not be able to handle it.

133
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,827
So, at the right time;

134
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,455
In a way that there's no damage
to the leaf or the thorn, right?

135
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,326
Dude, even if the leaf
and thorn are damaged,

136
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,391
there shouldn't be
any damage to us. Got it?

137
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,767
He is Rajeev!

138
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,702
He's doing his PG at SA College.

139
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,867
I know Rajeev.

140
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,036
Isn't he the district
vice-president of our union?

141
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,980
That's now.

142
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,414
But he can even become the
district secretary in future.

143
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,746
Most probably!

144
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,215
There is a possibility.

145
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,286
So?

146
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,912
We should get rid of him.
- How?

147
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,156
No matter how!

148
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,484
You mean... Should we kill him?

149
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,282
No! We needn't kill him.

150
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,793
We just have to scare him.

151
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,190
Will he be scared?
- Dude,

152
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,162
I'm not talking about
scaring him with a knife.

153
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,895
A slight inertia.

154
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,194
When he's about to
enter political work actively,

155
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,430
he should get an inner calling.

156
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,471
Will he get it?

157
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,200
We should make sure he gets it.

158
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,067
For that, he has
to be beaten up.

159
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,109
Us?

160
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,207
We shouldn't be
involved directly!

161
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,436
That's why we need
Bennychayan's help.

162
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,744
That hard-slapper Benny?
- Ya.

163
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,783
Will he beat up a
member of our party?

164
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,510
Yes. He will.

165
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,287
I don't understand anything.

166
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,016
Dude, hear me out.

167
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,347
Or else..

168
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,326
Watch this!

169
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,163
Rajeev, who is walking
towards the market junction.

170
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,168
Red Salute!

171
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,203
Red Salute!

172
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,471
Come. Hop on!
- Of course!

173
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,974
Stop right there!
Where are you going?

174
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,103
Oh God!
Goons!

175
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,477
Goons from our opposite party!

176
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,038
Catch him!

177
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,017
Drag him out!

178
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,052
Take him!

179
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,220
- Kichu!

180
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,024
- Aren't we on the same team?
- Hit me on my hand!

181
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,285
Oh my God!

182
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,290
Sorry! Did it hurt?

183
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,420
Go beat him up!

184
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:09,832
Don't hit me!

185
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,067
Why are you hitting me?

186
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,109
Help!

187
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,011
Kichu!

188
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,579
Don't hit me!

189
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,240
Who are you guys?

190
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,476
Didn't we tell you earlier?

191
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,478
If you dare to continue
political work hereafter,

192
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,384
we will finish both of you!
- No! Never again!

193
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,888
Got it?
- Sorry brother!

194
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,118
I'll do something.

195
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,150
I will go crawling.

196
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,860
Rajeev!

197
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,521
Are you hurt badly?

198
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,329
Oh! I understood!

199
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,596
You are hurt badly!

200
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,599
Anyway»

201
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,100
I have decided something
today, Rajeev.

202
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,138
I'm not continuing
active politics anymore.

203
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,335
If I do, they will come again!

204
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,969
I'm backing out, Rajeev.
I'm backing out.

205
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,542
You are rig ht, Krishnakumar!

206
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,404
I've had it!

207
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,484
I'm backing out, Krishnakumar!

208
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,148
You're over-doing it!

209
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,548
Over here!

210
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,487
This side!

211
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,091
Your acting is too over the top!

212
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,149
Sheesh!
- I don't mind that!

213
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,994
Dude,

214
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,462
it's not the acting
which is important.

215
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,827
It's the planning!

216
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,392
Didn't it work out?

217
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,494
I made him say that he
will back out, right?

218
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,364
That's enough! It will all fall in
place when it actually happens!

219
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,872
All that's fine!
- Thank you!

220
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,100
But shall I ask you something?

221
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,174
Move!

222
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,576
Suppose..

223
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,641
I'm not continuing
active politics anymore!

224
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,040
If I do, they will come again!

225
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,343
I'm backing out, Rajeev!
I'm backing out!

226
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,475
Krishnakumar!

227
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,951
Were you such a coward?

228
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,159
Are you going to leave the party
you loved more than your life?

229
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,893
I can't do that!

230
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,856
This attack is like an
energy boost to me!

231
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,133
An energy boost to lead
the party strongly!

232
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,062
Long Live The Revolution!

233
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,136
Dialogues might not be the same.

234
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,876
Hey!

235
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,370
He won't say that.

236
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,535
What if he does?

237
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,513
Are you with me or him?

238
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,682
I'm with you!

239
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,641
If so, he won't say
that dialogue.

240
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,920
If he does, I know
what to do next.

241
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,153
Okay.

242
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,122
But as per the plan, he has to come
where you are at that time, right?

243
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,682
He has to be called there.

244
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,986
Who will call him?

245
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,151
Me!

246
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,222
Will he come if you call him at that time?
What if he says no?

247
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,195
He won't say no!

248
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,629
He cannot say no.

249
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,904
Both of you?

250
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,704
He will come if I call him.

251
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,207
He is a close friend of mine.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,172
You devil!

253
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,442
You want to send people to
beat up your own close friend?

254
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,516
Point No.6

255
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,483
In politics, there's no
father, mother or friend.

256
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,953
If they block our path...

257
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,179
Haven't you heard it?

258
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,450
However fruitful a tree maybe,
if it grows above the house;

259
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,387
we have to cut it!

260
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,120
So, will you do the same to me?

261
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,323
I won't do anything to you!

262
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,296
I know that you won't grow much.

263
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,028
There are many good people
like Rajeev in our party.

264
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,035
Will you get rid of all of them?

265
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,531
If I have to.

266
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,510
You know rig ht?

267
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,010
I am not scared of anyone.

268
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,213
Rajeev!

269
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,278
Go and open the door!
- No! I won't!

270
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,248
Open <i>m</i>

271
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,512
I won't open it!
- Obey your leader! Go!

272
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,417
I'm scared, dude.
I swear!

273
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,714
Shall I open it?
- Ya.

274
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,257
Open it.

275
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,560
Who is it?

276
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,095
Comrade?

277
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,490
Oh! It's you?

278
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,426
I was just checking since the
light was on, at midnight.

279
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,625
How come you're not sleeping?

280
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,170
Yes. We are going to sleep.

281
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,038
Krishnakumar, now..

282
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,665
SFK's district joint secretary.

283
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,606
Not that.

284
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,108
What do you do now?

285
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,644
Are you studying?
- Yes.

286
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,576
DTP.

287
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,771
DTP?
- Yes.

288
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,170
Well..

289
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,114
Software“ Com puter..
C++

290
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,981
And I'm trying for LLB
at the academy as well!

291
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,019
Okay then!

292
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,384
You don't have to study anything,

293
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,050
just to be a part of SFK.

294
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,036
Ya right! As if he's the
one who decides all that!

295
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,195
He has a point!

296
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,671
You're studying just to
be a pan of SFK, right?

297
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,231
Yes. I'm studying only for that.
- Why do you have to do that?

298
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,243
Isn't it better to work
full time for the party?

299
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,243
Hey M... Mahesh!

300
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,474
Didn't I tell you earlier?

301
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,549
Time!

302
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,684
Correct time!

303
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,518
That is very important!

304
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,420
If I quitSFK now,

305
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,615
it will be bad for me.

306
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,679
I will quit.

307
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:28,724
Not now.

308
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,252
After 2 years.

309
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,687
Within those 2 years, I will become
the district secretary of SFK.

310
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,561
I will be a state
committee member as well.

311
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,701
And gradually, I
will shift to DYFK.

312
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,234
By then, I would get a
membership in the party.

313
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,239
With the contacts I make while
I am in the state committee,

314
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,739
I will be able to enter the DYFK
district committee directly.

315
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,837
Maybe, into the state
committee as well.

316
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,512
And after one and a half years,

317
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
there will be an
assembly election.

318
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,148
According to the thesis approved
during the last Party congress,

319
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,680
the youth will have more
prominence in that election.

320
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,118
If that's the case,

321
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,488
young people would be considered
as candidates in our constituency.

322
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,424
Because, here there are no veteran
comrades who can't be replaced.

323
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,131
Since this is a constituency
which has more Nairs (caste),

324
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,395
and since non-Nairs
have never won here;

325
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,795
party will obviously select a
Nair youth as the candidate.

326
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,365
At that point of time,

327
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,738
there will be chances for
three people, including me.

328
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,403
Out of the three,

329
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:28,075
I know how and when to get
rid of the other two.

330
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,521
After that, MLA, Minister,
Chief Minister.

331
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,748
I have planned all that.

332
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,290
Will all this happen?

333
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,750
We should make it happen!

334
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,122
We have to work for that!

335
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,252
Not for the people.

336
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,295
For us!

337
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,365
We have to work out our plans intelligently
according to the situations.

338
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,695
And the first step towards that,

339
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,802
is this attack against Rajeev.

340
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,669
It's politics, dude!

341
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,638
Shall we sleep?
Switch off the lights!

342
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,838
I've told you many times not to wear the
blanket. - Should I walk naked then?

343
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,114
I can't see anything.

344
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,642
I have to speak to Bennychayan
tomorrow morning itself!

345
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,686
Can you move a little, Kichu?

346
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,482
Assistants should be
sleeping on the floor!

347
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,783
Thank you.
Kichu,

348
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,693
You can do all this even if you choose
the right path like our comrades, right?

349
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,823
I can, but it will
take a lot of time!

350
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:13,886
I don't have patience.

351
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,431
Kichu,

352
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,127
Don't do anything
to me in the dark.

353
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,292
I will always be a
loyal slave to you.

354
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,896
Shut up and go to sleep!

355
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,394
Kichu,

356
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,373
What?

357
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,405
Are you sure there was
no more chicken fry?

358
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,842
Oh my God!
- Sleep on the floor!

359
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,818
Kichu!

360
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,476
Aren't you done?

361
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,821
Point No.7

362
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,915
A politician should always have his
weapon, that is his phone, with him!

363
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,958
Here you go.
- What is it?

364
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,494
Yes Comrade!

365
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,822
No. I'm at the AC office.

366
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,794
Why not? I'll arrange that.

367
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,596
I will send you a phone number.

368
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,407
Well.. No..

369
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,534
I had some work...

370
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,722
No!

371
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,757
Hello?

372
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,458
What is it?

373
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,289
I'm done for!

374
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,419
I've reached the medical college.

375
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,779
Where are they?
- I think it's that way.

376
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,623
Must be there.
- Hey.

377
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,986
How long will this take?

378
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,655
15 minutes, maximum!

379
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,751
I have a lot of other work.

380
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,524
15 minutes to donate blood?

381
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,222
If I say 15 minutes, I mean it!

382
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,700
Point No.8

383
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,531
Clarity about the things
you're going to do.

384
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,631
But how will you do
it in 15 minutes?

385
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,000
I will annoy them!

386
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,503
I will annoy the hell out of them
and make them ask me to leave!

387
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,280
Come!

388
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,482
Watch <i>&</i> learn!

389
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,929
Annoy them!

390
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,065
Who wants blood here?

391
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,313
Kichu, this is a hospital.
Who doesn't need blood here?

392
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,479
There's a patient here
who needs blood, right?

393
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,283
<i>A comrade'.!</i>

394
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,581
Inna

395
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,925
Area Secretary Kuria
Sir sent me here.

396
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,722
This blood donation campaign
is a programme by SFK.

397
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,520
At the district level,
we have done around..

398
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,862
Com e.
- Huh? What?

399
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,865
Let's go to the lab.

400
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,701
I didn't finish talking!

401
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,072
As a leader of SFK..
- It's okay.

402
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,303
We can give it for
cross-matching.

403
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,718
Okay!

404
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,478
You're awesome, Kichu!

405
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,616
This could've taken
such a long time.

406
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,921
But with just one lame dialogue of
yours, things moved so swiftly!

407
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,426
Hey.

408
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,089
Will it be a problem if those 15
minutes are extended to half an hour?

409
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,130
Why?

410
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,331
We can add today's
breakfast in this account.

411
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,466
I was going to say that.
I had forgotten about it.

412
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,738
Hey! Brother!

413
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,834
Well, shall we eat something
and then go there?

414
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:46,773
Well..

415
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,741
We can do that after you
donate blood, right?

416
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,109
The nutrition value of blood that
I'm donating shouldn't be less.

417
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,945
Not just that.
That's how it is, right?

418
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,642
And we haven't had
breakfast too.

419
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,081
- Buy it for us, uncle!

420
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,055
APPam,
(So)

421
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,989
No Appam.
Only Parotta, Chappathi & Masala Dosa.

422
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,855
Parotta!

423
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,118
For all three of you?

424
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,019
No. I'll have just a tea.

425
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,463
Nowl know! You already
had breakfast, rig ht?

426
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,029
No. I'll have it later.

427
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,992
So that's better.
Just for two of us.

428
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,425
And curry?

429
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,404
Chicken?

430
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Beef!

431
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,439
Get beef.

432
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,736
Chicken <i>&</i> beef are
not ready yet.

433
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,070
Egg or vegetable curry.

434
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,107
It's okay.
Bring an egg curry.

435
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,578
Three eggs extra.
Boiled!

436
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,636
For both of you?
- Ya.

437
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,909
No! He doesn't need it!

438
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,641
I'm the one who's donating blood.
So I should be eating more!

439
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:29,852
Kichu!

440
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,420
Then get it for him too.
What if we need his as well?

441
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,456
Blood!

442
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,389
So ya..

443
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,994
Blood is something
which we really need.

444
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,052
You know rig ht?

445
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,429
Be it the person who's
donating it or receiving it!

446
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,991
This blood is a pan of the body of
the person who's donating it, right?

447
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,628
So when this blood is lost,
one can feel really tired.

448
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,933
That's what these eggs are for.

449
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,407
But the yellow of the
egg; that's full of fat.

450
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,738
And the white is
full of protein!

451
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,540
We can get proteins
from milk as well.

452
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,136
Oops! We didn't ask for milk!

453
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,674
Ya. We haven't.

454
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,977
Bro, milk!
In a tall glass!

455
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,915
Don't shout. They will come here.

456
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,219
Are you happy now?
- Ya.

457
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,459
What you did now; that's
called a political burp!

458
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,066
The pleasure of hogging
for someone else's money;

459
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,033
will we get that if we stay at home?
- No!

460
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,068
That's it!

461
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,035
Are you really going
to donate your blood?

462
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,032
I haven't decided.
- You haven't?

463
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,510
Kichu!

464
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,770
Wait!

465
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,776
Well, if you annoy them too much;
what about your image then?

466
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:36,652
<i>Wage';?</i>

467
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:38,851
Buddy,

468
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,048
why should I care about my image in
front of these people from the hills?

469
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,625
Point No.9

470
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,755
We should be good only in front
of people who will be useful for us.

471
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,821
Even if we have to do all
sons of crooked things,

472
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,731
we have to be good in
front of them, always!

473
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,768
Got it?

474
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,275
Keep it folded.

475
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,068
Hey! Is that enough?

476
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,636
I am donating it to someone.

477
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,814
Take some more.

478
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,906
What if it's not enough?

479
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,610
This is for
cross-matching, right?

480
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,152
Oh! Then say it clearly!

481
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,687
Dude, Bennychayan is calling.

482
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,548
Hello Bennychaya!
Just a second.

483
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,055
Can I know what my
blood group is?

484
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,028
Hello?

485
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,864
Hey!

486
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,599
I just asked my blood group,
not your phone number, right?

487
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,101
What are you saying, Bennychaya?

488
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,968
I understood!

489
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,630
I will promise one thing.
No one will know about this.

490
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,866
If they know, I'll also
be in trouble, right?

491
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,574
Don't say anything!

492
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,239
You have to do it for me,
because our bond is such!

493
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,281
Right?

494
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,611
That's true, right?

495
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,547
My need is your need
as well, right?

496
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,781
Anyway, you should operate the
plan within today evening. Okay?

497
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,757
We'll discuss the rest of
the details in person.

498
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,792
Okay. Bye.

499
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:51,994
What is it?

500
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,656
He's asking if Kuria Sir knows about
it, will it be a problem and all that!

501
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,301
Not just Benny, I can
fool even his grandpa!

502
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,836
Don't you have to
call Rajeev now?

503
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,604
I'll meet him in person.

504
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,673
No.

505
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,537
I'll call him.

506
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,902
We'll meet Benny in person.

507
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,702
Let's get out of here first.
Com e.

508
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,078
Did you see a moustached guy?
- Moustached?

509
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,049
A big man..
Who came with us.

510
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,551
A dark, ugly grandpa!

511
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,043
No such person came here.

512
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,087
He didn't come?

513
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,227
Hey Mister!

514
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,722
What did you do right now?

515
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,195
You made us wait there
and came back here?

516
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,199
That..

517
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,633
That's because both of you left from there.
- No!

518
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,602
Who left? For what? Why?

519
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,929
If we wanted to leave, we
wouldn't have come only!

520
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,074
You should understand something.

521
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,804
I didn't come asking for
blood, to you for me!

522
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,973
Instead, I've come here with my
rare blood group, for you!

523
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,015
O Negative!

524
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,608
Do what I said.
- Okay Doctor.

525
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,684
It's because you don't
know my busy schedule.

526
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,949
I am the district joint
secretary of a students' union!

527
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,216
Hello!
Look here!

528
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,390
I am a comrade with
thousands of commitments.

529
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,359
If I can leave my busy schedule and
come here, why can't you wait there?

530
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,397
Hey!

531
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,827
What's the problem?
- Let it be!

532
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:07,762
You are a doctor?

533
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,404
Doctor,

534
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,005
try and make him understand;

535
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,366
about the availability
of O Negative blood group.

536
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,673
If this is the situation of an
SFK District Joint Secretary,

537
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,748
what will be the condition of ordinary
students at the blood donation camp?

538
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,647
Come, let's go to the
room and discuss.

539
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,781
No. That's not necessary.

540
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,081
I was just trying to
make them understand.

541
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,756
Please come.

542
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,058
Let's go!

543
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:31,994
Okay!

544
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,825
Is he an actual doctor?
- Of course!

545
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,092
Can't you see? He might have
become one unknowingly.

546
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,100
Just that he doesn't look like one.
- Good.

547
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,396
I want to talk to him privately.

548
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,072
Must be about some transfer.

549
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,336
I'll be right back.

550
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,398
Com e.

551
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,377
Wait.

552
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,003
Wow. So many bottles!

553
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,009
This doesn't look like your
consultation room, Doctor.

554
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,246
I don't need any
particular room for this.

555
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,785
I didn't get you.
- I'll make it clear.

556
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,783
What was that show you
put up over there?

557
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:05,761
What?

558
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,120
Goondaism, is it?

559
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,893
Only you can do
goondaism or what?

560
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,929
Do you know who
you're talking to?

561
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,698
Whoever you are,
why would I care?

562
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,137
Remember that you're
messing with a Comrade!

563
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,801
I got hold of you because I heard
you saying this over there!

564
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,335
I am a much bigger
Comrade than you are!

565
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,880
If you try to show off, using
the name of the party;

566
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,746
I'll knock your teeth out!

567
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,883
If you have come to donate blood,
do that and leave decently.

568
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,156
Puny leader!

569
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,358
You were a comrade?

570
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,022
That's why you have such energy.
I had thought about it.

571
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,387
How are the activities of
the Doctors' Association?

572
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,432
Get lost!

573
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,868
Not about me. The
Doctors' Association..

574
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:46,959
Get lost, I say!

575
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,067
He...

576
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,174
Red Salute!

577
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,300
He is a Comrade.

578
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,745
I heard it.

579
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,407
Everything?
- Yes.

580
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,447
He shouldn't have
shouted at you.

581
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,916
Why didn't you react?

582
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,881
You noticed all that, right?
- Yes.

583
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,521
Point No.10

584
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,189
A politician,

585
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,120
should not be impatient
or short-tem pered.

586
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,922
A doctor can be all that.

587
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,556
Asocial worker

588
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,232
should never be involved in anything
that may cause damage to his body.

589
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,065
That too, in a closed
room like this.

590
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,969
Even if we react or not,
nobody is going to see it.

591
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,006
Got it?

592
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,536
It's politics, dude!
- Why are you hitting me?

593
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,878
Hey, the half an hour
you asked for, is over.

594
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,981
Is it?

595
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,012
Then, we'll leave after
donating the blood.

596
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,050
Come!

597
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,087
Wm
E

598
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,179
We will take time to identify
the group <i>&</i> give the result.

599
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,918
Kichu doesn't have any such problem.
Any group..

600
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,384
I know that my group
is O Negative!

601
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,827
It's not enough if you say that!

602
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,159
Remember that you're
talking to a Comrade.

603
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,391
Come here, dude.

604
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,994
Nurses' association
is important to us.

605
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,539
So?

606
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,307
Bloody has!

607
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,176
Hello Mister!

608
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,310
Why isn't she taking my blood?

609
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,205
Didn't she tell you why?

610
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,577
If she says so, you
don't want my blood?

611
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,810
If not, tell me!

612
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,318
They take it from so
many people, right?

613
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,149
The result might take some time.

614
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,344
So much time?

615
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,858
They think they can do any nonsense
since this is a government hospital!

616
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,052
I know what to do!

617
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,822
What's the use in
saying all this to me?

618
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,420
A 'Elfin

619
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,555
Ask him directly!

620
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,424
Good morning, Doctor.

621
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,868
Why should I talk to the Doctor?

622
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,166
You don't have to
drag him into this.

623
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,470
Let that innocent soul
go wherever he wants.

624
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,208
You talk to them and
make things fast.

625
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,443
See Mr. Prabhakaran uncle,

626
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,280
why does she want
to know the group?

627
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,446
Whichever group it is, you
just want the blood, right?

628
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,648
Yes.
- Then during the afternoon or night,

629
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,257
you can check that blood group <i>&</i>
identify it whenever you want.

630
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,418
Right, Kichu?
- Yes.

631
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,395
In case you can't use
it, you don't have to!

632
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,487
Right, Kichu?
- Yes!

633
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,555
You can give it to some dogs or cats!
Right, Kichu?

634
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,600
Yes!

635
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,302
Come here!

636
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,639
Are you donating
your blood, you dog?

637
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,876
Sorry uncle. My mistake. You can
pour it under some banana plant.

638
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:40,976
You..

639
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,078
Oops.

640
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,112
It's Kuria Sir.

641
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,646
Did Bennychayan mess things up?

642
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,549
Is he calling after
knowing our plan?

643
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,010
Anyway, pick up the call. We
haven't done anything, right?

644
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:54,923
Hello Comrade!

645
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,151
I mean.. Sir!

646
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,525
Krishnakumar,

647
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,560
where are you?

648
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,527
Sir, I am at the hospital.

649
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,063
I'll come. Just tell me where.

650
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,599
You're at the hospital, right?

651
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,099
You should be there.

652
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,069
The person who's admitted there is a
Comrade who is very important to us.

653
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,697
I came to know only now that you
have gone to donate blood to him.

654
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,068
But they said it
will take some time.

655
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,212
I'll go.. Come back" Donate blood..
And then..

656
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,607
Where do you want to go?

657
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,476
You don't have any programmes today
that you can't avoid, right?

658
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,539
Yes.
No!

659
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:22,951
No, Sir.

660
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,515
Then you should stay there.

661
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,983
I'll call you later.

662
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,019
I'm stuck here now.

663
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,689
Actually, who is that
person in the ICU?

664
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,068
Dear,

665
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,261
Your mom can take rest in
the room if she wants to.

666
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,406
No.

667
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,473
It's okay.

668
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,942
I'll sit here.

669
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,178
We'll do one thing.

670
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,611
Let's go freshen
up and come back.

671
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,714
You carry on.

672
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,416
Come, mom!

673
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,450
Com e.

674
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,552
Did you eat anything?
- Yes.

675
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,426
I don't think she realized that we were
the ones who created a ruckus earlier.

676
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,068
Why?

677
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,195
If she did, she would've
knocked our teeth out!

678
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,205
Will she speak so decently then?

679
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,577
<i>“Bheem Bheem. Chum Bheun“</i>

680
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,011
It's the Circle Inspector.

681
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,543
Comrade Krishnan?

682
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,287
Hello Sir.

683
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,495
I don't know!

684
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,502
Hello?

685
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,500
Sir!

686
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,172
Sir told me everything.

687
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,571
So, I'll do the needful.

688
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,148
Sir, l...

689
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,676
SFK's..

690
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,224
So where did we stop?
"Bheem Bheem, Chota Bheem"

691
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,260
Hello!
Tell me, dude.

692
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,302
Rajeev,

693
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,672
I want to meet you.

694
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,466
WSW

695
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,565
I'm in the college.

696
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,541
Or I'll come to the AC office.
- No, no!

697
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,839
We'll meet later in the night.

698
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,046
What time?

699
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,513
Miami
a

700
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,410
Around 11-11.30?

701
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,450
Okay, fine.

702
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,315
I'll call you later <i>&</i>
tell you where to come.

703
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,648
- Okay.
- Will he come?

704
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,552
Of course!
Come!

705
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,056
Why don't they have WiFi in
a government hospital?

706
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,097
All this is normal.
There is nothing to worry.

707
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,300
She?

708
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,836
Oh God!

709
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,640
Who is it?

710
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,341
Doctor?

711
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,709
I showed that to the doctor.

712
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,181
Do you know this grandpa?

713
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,337
Aishwarya!

714
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,740
Krishnakumar?

715
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,501
How come you're here?

716
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,811
For a responsible social worker,

717
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,642
a hospital is like
his mother's house.

718
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,341
Oh! ls your mother's
house close by?

719
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,850
Leave that. What are you doing here?
- I am a nurse here.

720
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,176
Is it?
- Yes.

721
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,189
It's been a long time since we met.

722
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,348
Hows your social work going?

723
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,552
Oh! You remember all that?
- Of course!

724
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,789
I had stopped it in between,
but I'm active again now.

725
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,455
He stopped it when he
failed 12th grade.

726
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,890
This is Mahesh.
My friend.

727
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,126
A small-time worker of SFK.

728
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,262
I'm the District Joint Secretary.
You know, right?

729
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,237
I saw your name in the
newspaper some time back.

730
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,170
You did?

731
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,274
Oh! You read every line
of the newspaper, is it?

732
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,845
He's the comedian of SFK as well!

733
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,810
Well, how come only you're
not wearing a uniform here?

734
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,582
Is it because you can do anything
in a government hospital?

735
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,181
I'm on leave today.

736
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,289
Someone who's very dear
to me is in the ICU.

737
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,380
I came to meet them.

738
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,422
The people whom you
were talking to..

739
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,586
A Comrade, right?

740
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,254
Yes. You know him?

741
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,165
What a question!

742
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,795
I came here to donate
blood for that Comrade.

743
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,762
How do you know him?

744
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,534
Well..

745
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,434
If you ask me howl know him..

746
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,474
He is..

747
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,702
He is everything for me.

748
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,877
He made me study nursing.
- You mean nursing teacher?

749
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:44,935
No.

750
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:45,914
This guy!

751
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,449
Krishnan Achan is
like a God to me.

752
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,944
He paid for my education"

753
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,649
What is his name?

754
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,557
Krishnan.

755
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,783
Comrade Krishnan.

756
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,426
Krishnan!

757
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,665
Like you, he was also a
great political worker.

758
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,532
Like me?

759
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,767
Yes.

760
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:11,538
A great man with a lot of virtue;
who has helped so many people.

761
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,871
You're doing something great.

762
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,609
Donating blood to save
Krishnan Achan's life;

763
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:24,685
You will always have
our love and prayers.

764
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,355
Thanks.

765
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,686
Thank you so much.

766
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,519
Okay. I'll just go there.

767
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,897
What is this?

768
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,400
Earlier, a doctor shouted
at you for no reason;

769
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,992
and now this girl is
crying for no reason.

770
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,661
Did we ask anything so serious?

771
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,639
We just asked what his name was; they
just have to say that, right Kichu?

772
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,503
I realised only now.

773
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,711
Your name and his name are similar.

774
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,438
Comrade Krishnan.

775
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,042
Comrade Krishnakumar.

776
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,050
Krishnan - Krishnakumar.

777
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,246
Krishnakumar - Krishnan.

778
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,882
Kri - Kri!

779
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,654
Didn't you hear what she said?

780
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,582
He was like me it seems.

781
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,987
I don't think you both
have any similarity.

782
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,626
Elam?

783
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,628
Come here!
- Why?

784
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,035
Let me give you some love!

785
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,770
They are saying that they will take
the blood only in the afternoon.

786
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,705
Then you should be doing
the formalities at least.

787
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,379
It's because I don't know
what the formalities are.

788
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,405
Tell me whatever
you want me to do.

789
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,444
Don't put too much ice, brother.

790
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,655
Its
a

791
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,919
Why aren't there seeds in it?

792
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,426
It doesn't have any.
That's all!

793
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,538
It's because this is a part of it.
- He told me.

794
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,408
Actually,

795
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,574
most people pay money to
get such rare groups.

796
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,113
Yes.
- But we are not like that.

797
00:38:58,869 --> 00:38:59,904
He is a Comrade.

798
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,378
I am a Comrade.

799
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,980
I like helping others.
That's all!

800
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,688
Avinue..

801
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,891
Hey! I'll be right back.

802
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,026
I'll also come.
- No. You wait here.

803
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,487
Or go back inside.
I'll come.

804
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,694
He asked me to wait here because he fears
that you would disappear like earlier.

805
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,401
Why aren't you moving?

806
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,153
Kunji!

807
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,795
Who is calling you, grandpa?

808
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,536
Check it.
It must be urgent.

809
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,365
Well, since it is a hospital.
- Or else, you would've...

810
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:58,940
Picked it up?

811
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,372
What kind of a man are you?

812
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:02,936
Did you forget that

813
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,674
you used to keep calling me on this
same phone until a month back?

814
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,381
Havel ever ignored your calls then?
- But son..

815
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,944
It's always like that.

816
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,987
You just wanted me until
you got what you wanted.

817
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,988
And, how is your
daughter's job going on?

818
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,817
Is a job at the co-operative
bank, such a small feat?

819
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,654
Son, I had kept the
money aside for you.

820
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:19,854
But that's when she..

821
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,919
You'll have a 100
excuses for all that.

822
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,398
Afterl fell on so many people's
feet and got her the job;

823
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,456
I'm out!

824
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,935
I had given Rs.25,000
to Sukumaran Sir.

825
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,537
So?

826
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,900
It's true that Sukumaran
Sir got her the job.

827
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,632
And you have to pay
him his commission.

828
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,741
But you promised me that
you'll give me Rs.5000

829
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,938
for introducing you to him!

830
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,538
And now you're making excuses saying that
you paid him, she's sick & so on?

831
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,843
Is it not valuable because
it's a small amount?

832
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,077
It's not like that.

833
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,542
Sukumaran Sir is not alone
on the director board.

834
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,116
There won't be much time before
she loses the job. Mind it!

835
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,454
No, son.
Don't say that!

836
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,924
I have Rs.2000 with me.

837
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,458
I had kept it aside for medicines.
You can take it.

838
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,428
Emotional blackmail!

839
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,758
No! I don't need it!

840
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,462
You will curse me for
this and then...

841
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,604
No. I'm giving this
to you happily.

842
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,030
This won't make up for even the
phone calls I made back then.

843
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,098
I'll pay the rest when
she gets her salary.

844
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,444
Whatever!

845
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,446
- How are you?
- This is why I don't help anyone.

846
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,840
Continue the medicines
we have been giving her.

847
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,243
Move, grandpa.

848
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,252
Grandma,

849
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,214
How are you now?
Are you feeling better?

850
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,784
Get well soon.

851
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,219
Isn't she your grand-daughter?

852
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,820
Hi dear..

853
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,453
- Do you want this uncle's blood?

854
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,563
Okay then. I'll call you
on the 1st of next month.

855
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,739
My
Em

856
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,643
You didn't curse me, rig ht?
- No.

857
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,181
That's good.

858
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,845
And then?
- Hey!

859
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,088
Hey!
- Really?

860
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,048
I'll come later.

861
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,493
Where were you?

862
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,029
Nothing. I had to give
someone some money.

863
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,664
I made a small inquiry.

864
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,764
This Comrade Krishnan was quite a tiger!

865
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:14,871
Ya right!
Tiger!

866
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,073
Maxim um a State
Committee Member.

867
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,739
What more can he be?

868
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,047
He wasn't an MLA or MP, right?

869
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,811
He was brought here
with Kuria Sir's help.

870
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:24,816
That means,

871
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,615
the highest position he could reach
would be an Area Secretary.

872
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,148
Dude!

873
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,551
Dude!

874
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,052
Kichu!

875
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,574
Dude.

876
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,609
What just happened here?

877
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,773
What happened to you?

878
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,715
Usually you barge in when you
see state leaders, right?

879
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,680
I don't understand anything.

880
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,227
I'm sure about one thing.

881
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,327
What you found out is
true to an extent.

882
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,068
The person who's lying inside,

883
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,335
is not any ordinary man,
unlike what I had imagined.

884
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,431
The surgery would be in
the afternoon, right?

885
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,637
Yes. You had told me earlier.

886
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,788
Even if it's in the
night, I will be around.

887
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,649
It's the matter of his life, right?

888
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,365
The one who's inside;

889
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,936
the Comrade;

890
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,374
All are saying that he is a great man.

891
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,337
The girl who came earlier, Aishwarya.
She studied with me in school.

892
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,774
She also told me.

893
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,047
And,

894
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,806
all the Comrades who came earlier.

895
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,111
Just out of a curiosity to
know more about him.

896
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,883
Just for a curiosity, uncle.

897
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,086
I am not in a state of mind
to talk to you right now.

898
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,761
Whoever he is;

899
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,293
He is done for, anyway!

900
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:25,424
He is in the ICU, right?

901
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,331
Knowing about him won't
be of any use to us.

902
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:28,736
That's true.

903
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,034
But still, who is he?

904
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,503
Hey. You do something.

905
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,738
Get into the ICU somehow.

906
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,871
And then ask him directly.

907
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,005
The surgery is only in the afternoon.
You have a lot of time.

908
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,049
Get lost!

909
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,487
It's Rajeev.

910
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,289
Hello Rajeev.

911
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,757
Ya dude. We shall meet
at Market Junction.

912
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,320
No. I will wait at
Market Junction.

913
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,525
And from there, we can go to
the party office together.

914
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,231
I will call you.
I'll let you know.

915
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,072
Okay.

916
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,407
What happened?

917
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,509
I have to get rid of him today.

918
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,174
What all do we have
to do to survive!

919
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,420
Did you ask seriously?

920
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,116
What?
- About Com rad e?

921
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:25,793
Yes.

922
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,462
Comrade always used to say;

923
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,197
'It's not when we feel like it'

924
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:34,560
'But when people need it, that we should
do the things that they ask you to do'

925
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,803
Not just because of that;

926
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,207
Everyone should
know about Comrade.

927
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,574
Especially you.

928
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:42,977
Because,

929
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,472
Comrade was always
like a textbook to me.

930
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,514
A huge book, from which I could learn
a lot, and also emulate a lot from.

931
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,080
Your name is
Krishnakumar, right?

932
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,323
Yes.

933
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,587
When I heard you
talking earlier,

934
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,485
I was reminded of our Comrade.

935
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,563
He was also like you.

936
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,260
A politician who was always busy.

937
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,403
Actually,

938
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:14,804
it would be better to call him a
social worker, or a public servant;

939
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,435
rather than a politician.

940
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,538
Certain glances and talks of yours;

941
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,245
felt exactly like
those of Comrade's.

942
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,049
He was my closest friend.

943
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:30,824
I was in the Police.

944
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,088
I met Comrade for the first time..

945
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,288
At Peerum ed u.

946
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,354
I was a Sub-Inspector
there, back then.

947
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,964
Comrade was a worker who had come there
to develop the Communist Party.

948
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,403
Back then, he would've
been of your age.

949
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,507
But.

950
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,841
He had maturity beyond his age;

951
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,975
eyes that exuded confidence;

952
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,141
the spirit of revolution all
over his mind and body.

953
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,317
He came onto the
chilly Peerumedu,

954
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,181
like a wildfire.

955
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,178
- Don't hit me, Sir.
- Shut up!

956
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,576
I didn't do it, Sir.

957
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,649
Get in, I say.

958
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,918
It's not me, Sir.
I didn't do it.

959
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,113
Don't hit me, Sir.

960
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:20,728
Put him into the jeep!

961
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,229
I didn't do it, Sir.

962
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:23,599
Don't take me, Sir.

963
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,401
I am innocent.
- Shut up!

964
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,099
Don't take me, Sir.

965
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,942
Don't hit me, Sir.

966
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,291
One Sod a.

967
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,229
Why was he beaten
up so brutally?

968
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,090
You're new here, right?

969
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,965
If the Policeman Eerali
wants to torture someone,

970
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,364
he doesn't even need a reason!

971
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,597
This is usual here.

972
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,008
Where are you from?

973
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,511
I haven't seen you here earlier.

974
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,138
You will see me from
now on, everyday.

975
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,609
For the time being, this
is our party office.

976
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,211
You can stay here as well.

977
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,718
It has all the basic facilities.

978
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:22,363
Come in.

979
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:27,724
Eldo!

980
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,502
Shall we talk?
Come.

981
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,346
I don't think I have to introduce
Comrade Krishnan any further.

982
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,611
This is Comrade Dasan.

983
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:43,740
Comrade Senthil.

984
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,011
That's Comrade Basheer.

985
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,055
This is Comrade Eldo.

986
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,324
Comrades,

987
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:54,354
to make the activities of Communist
Party more powerful over here,

988
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,157
Comrade Krishnan was appointed by
the Kottayam District Committee.

989
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,532
Comrade will tell you
more details himself.

990
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,471
After that, we can discuss.
I invite Comrade to speak.

991
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:07,775
But.

992
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,373
Let the others also come.

993
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,045
Well..

994
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:12,513
Comrade,

995
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,546
In Peerumedu, the red colour
isn't that strong yet.

996
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,142
Only five of us are here
as Party members now.

997
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,414
What about the workers' union?

998
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,147
There is a union.

999
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,250
Just for namesake.

1000
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,724
Firstly, the workers
here are unorganized.

1001
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:31,254
The union and party are supposed to
bring together the unorganized workers.

1002
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,659
Well, for the party to
be involved properly...

1003
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,235
Which is that book
you have with you?

1004
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,140
Karl Marx:
A new age leader.

1005
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,570
Written by Comrade EMS.

1006
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,575
Apart from conceptual ideologies,

1007
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,107
the party needs a place,

1008
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,742
to converse and interact
with the people,

1009
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,411
like Comrade mentioned earlier.

1010
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,223
That place which we don't
see, know or understand;

1011
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:57,514
is inside their minds!

1012
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,753
The first thing that a
Communist should understand,

1013
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,256
is not about the worker's
job or wage or working place;

1014
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,101
it is his mind!

1015
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,699
His mind which has thoughts about his
family, job, difficulties and anxieties;

1016
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,865
and his happiness and sorrows.

1017
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,169
That's where we should plant the
seeds of communist ideologies.

1018
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,875
The party's growth should be
along with his realizations.

1019
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,777
It's uproar should resonate

1020
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,251
from the minds of each worker who belongs
to the lower class of this society.

1021
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,415
The slogan, 'Long
Live The Revolution'

1022
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,548
should be infused in
his nerves from there!

1023
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,759
We have limitations to
what we can do, Comrade.

1024
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,290
There are many reasons
for that as well.

1025
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:39,427
There are no limitations to the
things that a Communist can do!

1026
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,200
In the beginning of 1940s,

1027
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,530
when the Communist Party formed
in Kerala through a wall scrawl,

1028
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,741
at Karivalloor, Morayur,
Kavumbayi in Malabar;

1029
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,242
when revolts broke out under the leadership
of Communist Party and Peasants' Union,

1030
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,876
when Comrades Keeleri
Kunjikkannan, Pulava Kumaran,

1031
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,748
and Pulikkal Kunjiraman
became martyrs;

1032
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,786
the party had to face much bigger
limitations, difficulties and obstacles.

1033
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,887
For every Communist who
was depressed by all this,

1034
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,861
it was the workers' minds that gave
them the energy that they needed.

1035
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,256
And the trust they have in our Party.

1036
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,733
It was that trust which brought the
EMS ministry to power in 1957.

1037
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,302
We can do it!

1038
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,664
We should do it, Comrade.

1039
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,963
10 years back,
Mehta from Bombay;

1040
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:53,496
bought 3 estates including this one
from the British Company called Morrison.

1041
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,346
Elappara,

1042
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,480
Kallarkudi,

1043
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:01,615
Peerumed u.

1044
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,449
Out of these three,

1045
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,816
the biggest one and the one
where most people are working,

1046
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,354
is in this estate.

1047
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,298
This manager has been here
only for 3 years now.

1048
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,498
But his cruelties are unbearable.

1049
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,770
Why isn't anyone reacting then?

1050
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:24,928
They are scared!

1051
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,409
Don't look at me.
All of us are scared!

1052
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,543
He has a right-hand man,
Garudan!

1053
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,869
Garudan Kangani.

1054
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,053
Hey!

1055
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:41,555
Come here.

1056
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,852
Why didn't you come
for work yesterday?

1057
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,953
It was my child's
admission day in school.

1058
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,730
And did your child learn anything?

1059
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:54,927
I will teach her.

1060
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:55,899
Shall I?

1061
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,298
No.

1062
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,600
I will come everyday hereafter.

1063
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,702
Then, you should learn something.

1064
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,342
To run!

1065
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:04,745
Run!

1066
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,087
He has been here for
some years now.

1067
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,750
He came from Coorg.

1068
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,317
Kangani is the one who sends
workers to the Company.

1069
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,894
He distributes the money that the company
gives him, to the workers, as he pleases.

1070
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,523
No one raises any objection.

1071
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,466
Can't you complain
to the Police?

1072
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,969
To whom?

1073
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,070
To Eerali?

1074
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,864
- Why didn't you do it?

1075
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,732
What's up, Garudan?

1076
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,777
Greetings!
- How are things?

1077
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,743
In such a situation, how can
we strengthen the Party?

1078
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,880
The Union is not able to
do anything worthwhile.

1079
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,921
Even we are staying here as Communists
ready to face whatever comes our way.

1080
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,053
Do you know the meaning
of the word 'Union'?

1081
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,630
Association.

1082
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,023
To be associated.

1083
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,693
Or to come together.

1084
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,027
If workers don't
come to the Union,

1085
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,995
the Union should reach
out to the workers.

1086
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:07,568
Here, conceptual
ideologies are not enough.

1087
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,635
We need practical
activism as well.

1088
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,850
In 1951,

1089
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,918
Central Government
passed a bill here.

1090
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,519
Do you know what that is?

1091
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,381
Indian Plantation LabourAct.

1092
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,789
For the welfare and job security of the
labourers who're working in plantations,

1093
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,125
Company Act came into force.

1094
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,498
The plantations which are
spread over 15 acres or above,

1095
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,565
and where 15 or more
labourers are working,

1096
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,371
come within the limits of
Major Plantations Company Act.

1097
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,172
According to that, the labourers
working in such plantations,

1098
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,709
are eligible for direct salary and
other concessions from the Company.

1099
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,039
How many of you,

1100
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,377
are getting salary directly from the
Company <i>&</i> not through Kangani?

1101
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,616
Leave that. The concessions
entitled to a labourer by law;

1102
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,084
How many of you receive them?

1103
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:55,155
Concessions?

1104
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:58,715
Provident Fund, which is supposed to be
paid equally by the labourer &the Company.

1105
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,792
Bonus, which is a share
from the total profit.

1106
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,420
Gratuity, Increment;

1107
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,463
And,

1108
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,694
paid and unpaid sick
leaves and casual leaves..

1109
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,791
Any such things?

1110
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,928
Sir, what are you talking about?

1111
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,171
About you!

1112
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,966
About labourers including Muthu, Mani,
Selvan, Raghavan, Nalini and many others!

1113
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,506
You, who haven't even
heard such things;

1114
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,842
how many years have you been
working for a company like slaves?

1115
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,781
The Company that you helped
grow, with your sweat <i>&</i> blood;

1116
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,149
is exploiting you!

1117
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,181
Even though you work
throughout the year,

1118
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:33,056
the working class is always
in poverty and starvation;

1119
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,561
is because of this exploitation!

1120
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,827
They are building forts of exploitation
over your ignorance and fear.

1121
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,424
Company is not our enemy.

1122
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,992
We are not against
the Company either.

1123
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:45,439
But we have to fight for labourers'
rights that they deserve.

1124
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:46,473
<i>How'?</i>

1125
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,770
For that we need a
Workers' Union here.

1126
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:50,904
And it should be strong too!

1127
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,764
Most of the workers are
ready to support us.

1128
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:17,537
What's the next action plan?

1129
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,040
We should talk.

1130
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,106
We should talk to
the management.

1131
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,607
We should make them
realize the situations.

1132
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,077
What are you saying, Comrade?

1133
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,615
Do you think they will accept
all this as soon as we talk?

1134
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,051
Never!

1135
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:38,581
But neither they or us should feel that,
an opportunity to discuss was lost.

1136
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,493
We want to meet the manager.

1137
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:41,855
What's the matter?

1138
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,022
We want to talk to him.

1139
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,191
If you come all of a sudden,
how can you meet him?

1140
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,192
You should get a prior
appointment, rig ht?

1141
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,827
We'll meet him once
we get permission.

1142
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,828
You can't get that so soon.

1143
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,235
Manager Sir is busy
with a lot of things.

1144
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,267
Just tell him,

1145
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,669
that the representatives of the
Workers' Union have come to meet him.

1146
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:03,673
You can't meet him now.

1147
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,018
He is busy.

1148
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,052
It's all right.

1149
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,117
We will wait until
he becomes free.

1150
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,220
Didn't I tell you earlier?

1151
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:48,557
This is not going to happen.

1152
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,091
Since we didn't get an
opportunity to talk..

1153
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,995
If we have decided to talk,

1154
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,828
we will definitely talk.

1155
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,331
But we should get permission
to meet the manager, right?

1156
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,166
We already got it.

1157
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,300
The time we waited today,

1158
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,903
will be our permission
for tomorrow.

1159
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:09,277
Where are you going?

1160
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,124
Sit down.

1161
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,158
These chairs are for us to sit.

1162
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,859
What do you want?

1163
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,167
It's okay.

1164
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:04,169
It's because you heard things which are
unfamiliar to you, all of a sudden.

1165
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,940
The workers are demanding
only their basic rights.

1166
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,841
You will have to accept
that sooner or later.

1167
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:11,711
Think about it.

1168
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,011
Did you think that I'm going to
give it as soon as you ask for it?

1169
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,116
Yes. I believe so.

1170
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:26,725
Even the sun cannot keep the world
in darkness, more than a night.

1171
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,691
There will be light.

1172
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,667
There are around
3000 labourers here.

1173
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,242
And their families
and helpers, etc.

1174
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,144
If we call for a strike,

1175
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,439
I don't know how many of
them would support us.

1176
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,040
Among them, there are people who
work for other unions as well.

1177
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,011
Majority of them have
accepted this way of life.

1178
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,883
Until they realize that a
better life is possible here,

1179
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,089
they will adjust
to any situation.

1180
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,187
That's ignorance.

1181
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,827
Our job is to make them
aware of their rights.

1182
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,458
And, the strike.

1183
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,063
Even if we have just one person
who supports us whole-heartedly!

1184
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,038
That one person can make
this strike successful!

1185
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,806
Communist ideology is like fire.

1186
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,840
Even if it is on a match-stick,

1187
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,045
the exploitative bourgeois
class will be scared.

1188
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,742
They should be scared.

1189
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:22,816
Because,

1190
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,842
to burn down a forest,

1191
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,777
a spark is more than enough.

1192
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,461
I don't understand why we
have to think so much.

1193
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,326
Is he our new adversary?

1194
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:46,031
Well, let's see how
far he goes, Garudan!

1195
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,409
Here he comes.

1196
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,907
You remove all those
chairs from there.

1197
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,844
I want to see how he's going
to sit and talk to me.

1198
01:02:58,875 --> 01:02:59,853
Sir,

1199
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,421
They..

1200
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,791
Come in, Comrade.

1201
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,365
Sit down.

1202
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,126
You came to sit down
and discuss, right?

1203
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,825
Come. Let's discuss.

1204
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:18,337
I'm not going to accept
your demands in any case.

1205
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,938
But we shouldn't refrain from
discussing because of that.

1206
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,142
Sit down.

1207
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,444
Sit!

1208
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:39,183
If I have decided that
I will sit &talk,

1209
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,520
I will always sit and talk!

1210
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:42,927
- Hey!
- Don't move!

1211
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:50,904
And,

1212
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,406
if you don't realize what
the workers' rights are:

1213
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,442
you are yet to realize,

1214
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,313
the strength of the workers,

1215
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,604
and how powerful they are!

1216
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,881
Long Live The Revolution!

1217
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,991
Long Live the Workers' Union!

1218
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,240
What is this?

1219
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,908
Loo k!

1220
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,921
- Long Live The Revolution!

1221
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,386
Move!

1222
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,419
Move, I say!

1223
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,667
Long Live The Revolution!

1224
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,178
Long Live The Workers' Union!

1225
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:35,050
You shouldn't gather in front of
the company, breaking law <i>&</i> order;

1226
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,322
shout slogans,

1227
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,399
or interrupt the
Company's functioning.

1228
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:41,025
So, all of you should disperse
from here immediately.

1229
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,130
Or else, we will have to use
force to send you away!

1230
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:50,110
Long Live The Revolution!

1231
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,079
You should disperse.

1232
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,217
Long Live The Revolution!

1233
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:00,653
Charge!

1234
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,285
Long Live The Workers' Union!

1235
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:17,134
Long Live The Workers' Union!

1236
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,108
Move!

1237
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:24,444
Move, I say!

1238
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:38,892
Don't spare any of them!

1239
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,122
You <i>&</i> your Communism!

1240
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,170
Get in!

1241
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:52,205
Close it!

1242
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,714
You don't have to take them
to the station rig ht now.

1243
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,448
You &your strike!

1244
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,624
Bloody Comrade!

1245
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:14,851
Sir, he will die if you
hit him like this.

1246
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:15,895
Die?

1247
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:16,929
This guy?

1248
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:26,300
Long Live The Revolution!

1249
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,835
Long Live The Workers' Union!

1250
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,224
Stop it.

1251
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,354
They hurt you a lot, is it?

1252
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,496
Let's go to Kottayam.

1253
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,227
You will be all right if you
take rest for some days.

1254
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,168
To continue the rest of the activities,
we have other comrades here.

1255
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:00,473
No, Comrade.

1256
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,436
Before this issue dies down, we have to
go forward with other forms of protests.

1257
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,703
I should be here for that.

1258
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:08,470
And it's not my pain which
should be relieved first,

1259
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,211
it's their stand towards the working
class that should be changed.

1260
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:14,615
This is Rajan Sir.
- Hello.

1261
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,588
He is the assistant
labour officer here.

1262
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,553
He is an old Comrade.

1263
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,694
There is no change in that.

1264
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,954
And the only relief I get when
I'm called an old Comrade,

1265
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,223
is that old is
supposed to be gold!

1266
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:30,636
Comrades,

1267
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,303
our protests should be
stronger from now on.

1268
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,308
The Company should realize that
they have no other option,

1269
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,402
other than accepting the
fair demands of workers.

1270
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,541
The next generation should
learn from this land that,

1271
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,210
police brutalities cannot put
and end to the workers' blood!

1272
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,378
Long Live The Revolution!

1273
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,548
Long Live The Workers' Union!

1274
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:56,519
Long Live The Revolution!

1275
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:12,603
Long Live The Revolution!

1276
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,795
They would do anything to transport
the goods during the night.

1277
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:35,400
So at least some of us should be awake.

1278
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,337
Comrade!

1279
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,006
What happened?
- Over there!

1280
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:43,672
That Kangani!

1281
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,546
There were four or five of them.

1282
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:57,486
They didn't spare
even the children.

1283
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:13,500
They might be trying to scare them when
the men of the house are not around.

1284
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:17,770
Did you get scared, dear?

1285
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,951
Why should we be scared?

1286
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,751
Kangani is the one who
should be scared!

1287
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,353
Who is it?

1288
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:01,721
Who is it?

1289
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,149
Who the hell is it?

1290
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:07,426
Garudan!

1291
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:08,527
Who is it?

1292
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,128
If a group of people are not working
according to your whims and fancies,

1293
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:15,867
is it right to force those whims
and fancies upon them, Garudan?

1294
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,069
Who are you?

1295
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,734
If you do so,

1296
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,671
do you think a Communist
would stay calm?

1297
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,908
Stop hiding in the dark
and come to the light.

1298
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,980
It's not me.
You are the one who is in the dark!

1299
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:53,139
You forgot a major
fact, Garudan!

1300
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,946
That you are also a worker!

1301
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,979
May this remind you about that!

1302
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:18,526
"In the heart...
a fire rises ablaze"

1303
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,767
"and spreads beyond time"

1304
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:27,330
"The pulsating red of the new
age has united us for our land"

1305
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,806
"At the places we gather"

1306
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:30,342
"With the hands that rise"

1307
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:33,845
"We shall hold our red
flag high for a better tomorrow“

1308
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,176
"Hereafter, when there's a
war cry on our streets"

1309
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,982
"We will give our
lives to stop it"

1310
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:17,050
"In these dark ages"

1311
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,556
"In the burning
heat of oppression"

1312
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:21,321
"We shall become the
comforting shade"

1313
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,463
"We will beat their
words with our glances"

1314
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,896
"We will fight a
battle if we have to"

1315
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:30,935
"Let us join hands"

1316
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:34,470
"And may the skies resonate
with the uproars of revolution"

1317
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,008
"At the places we gather"

1318
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,509
"With the hands that rise"

1319
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:41,104
"We shall hold our red flag
high for a better tomorrow“

1320
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,620
How many of you are there?
- We are out of work now, Comrade.

1321
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:22,910
Kavalam Pattar.

1322
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:23,651
Kavalam Pattar.

1323
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,355
He is a famous landlord here.

1324
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,493
In this high range, where only
tea and spices are grown;

1325
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,530
he came from Kavalam <i>&</i>
started cultivating paddy.

1326
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:34,362
Since he was reluctant to pay Rs.6 as
wages to the poor peasants in town;

1327
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,868
he has brought Tamilians to
work, from Kam bam <i>&</i> Theni;

1328
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,632
who would work for
4 or 5 Rupees.

1329
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,107
Since a peasants' union
does not exist here,

1330
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:44,268
my opinion is that the Party &the
Workers' Union should act upon this.

1331
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,109
Awage of 5 Rupees.

1332
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:55,010
1/12th of the profit.

1333
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:56,121
Let them work!

1334
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,056
That's not fair, Pattar.

1335
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,086
Awage of 8 Rupees.

1336
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,319
1/10th of the profit.

1337
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:06,125
Then you better get going
before it becomes too sunny.

1338
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,661
You know that we didn't
come here to stay!

1339
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:13,172
Let's settle the scores on the field!

1340
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,406
What is your name?

1341
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:22,410
Krishnan!
- Krishnan!

1342
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:24,209
Just Krishnan?

1343
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,013
Don't you have any 'tail'
along with your name?

1344
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:28,384
Like Krishnan Namboothiri
or Krishnan Nair?

1345
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:29,615
Or is it something else?

1346
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:33,018
If you want to know about
my caste and faith,

1347
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:34,583
they are not a 'tail' to my name.

1348
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,094
It comes before my name.

1349
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,462
Comrade!

1350
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,064
Comrade Krishnan!

1351
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:53,705
So,

1352
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,606
nobody should work on Pattar's
fields from today, right?

1353
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,251
No.

1354
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:01,310
Agriculture is not like business.

1355
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,212
Each enterprise has its
own methods of strike.

1356
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,088
Here, it's not like how
we went on strike,

1357
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,685
by stopping work at the Company,
until our demands were accepted.

1358
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,188
Until our demands are accepted,

1359
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,264
we should go on strike,
by working vigorously.

1360
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:14,955
You shouldn't support the
landlord's exploitation.

1361
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:17,630
You shouldn't support the
landlord's exploitation.

1362
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,473
No one can stop you
from working here.

1363
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:21,666
You can work here.

1364
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:22,774
Or leave.

1365
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,709
But to work on these fields,

1366
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,643
we will have peasant
workers from here, as well!

1367
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:28,146
Not just a Workers' Union;

1368
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,080
we need a Peasants' Union as well.
- Comrade,

1369
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,082
Pattar has decided that he's not going
to cultivate anything this year.

1370
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:36,418
He sent the Tamil labourers back, asking
them to stop whatever work they were doing.

1371
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:38,423
It's paddV-

1372
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:39,624
It's our food.

1373
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:41,284
Even if he lets go
of it for a year,

1374
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,287
nothing will happen to Pat-tar.

1375
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,695
But that's not the situation of
the poor people in this town.

1376
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,328
We should begin where
Pattar stopped.

1377
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:54,306
"Time will constantly, firmly
yet slowly, create history"

1378
01:23:54,662 --> 01:24:01,204
"In it, we shall write in blood and our
smiles will reflect the seasons of change"

1379
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,748
Until a decision is made about this,

1380
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,717
we should be able to supply the
ration for families of peasants.

1381
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:08,721
"Until we see the sun rising"

1382
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:12,054
"We should stand guard
during the nights"

1383
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:15,219
"Thousands will sacrifice
their blood <i>&</i> lives"

1384
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,797
"May the skies resonate
with the uproars of revolution"

1385
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:20,423
"At the places we gather"

1386
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,126
"In the hands that rise"

1387
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:25,399
"We shall hold our red
flag high for a better tomorrow“

1388
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,779
I can't agree to
these conditions.

1389
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,818
There's something that you
haven't understood until now.

1390
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,851
They haven't take a single
grain as a wage from this yet.

1391
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,059
Oh!

1392
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:50,229
Who asked them to to cultivate
my fields without my permission?

1393
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:54,198
That's why they approached me to hand over
the paddy they cultivated there, to you.

1394
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,563
I shall tell you something.

1395
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:58,604
The peasants have taken
a very decent stand.

1396
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,072
If your create any other
problems because of this,

1397
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:03,469
you will be in trouble,
as per the labour law.

1398
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,511
The peasants don't want
anything illegally.

1399
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,108
It should be the same for you.
- Awage of <i>7</i> Rupees.

1400
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:09,409
1/10th of the profit.

1401
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:10,745
There's no compromise on that.

1402
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:13,679
It's a decision that wouldn't
affect both the parties.

1403
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,187
If you agree, you can sign it.

1404
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:18,580
Or else, you will lose
your paddy & your fields!

1405
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,292
Here!

1406
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:24,420
Why do you have to be so stubborn?
It's of no use!

1407
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,625
Go ahead, sign it!

1408
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:31,870
Down there.

1409
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:44,809
So,

1410
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:46,208
that's over.

1411
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:48,920
Here you go.

1412
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,224
All the best then!

1413
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:16,339
If it boils too much,

1414
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,511
however good the rice is,

1415
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,812
it won't be edible.

1416
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,516
If it was in Kavalam,

1417
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,587
I could've drowned him in the lake,

1418
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:26,885
and not a single
soul would know it.

1419
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:30,292
If you can deal with
the consequences,

1420
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:34,492
I will make sure that there won't be any
trouble from him, here in Peerumedu.

1421
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:48,747
Where, Muthu?

1422
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,182
It's nearby.

1423
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:09,294
At a time when wild
boars go astray,

1424
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,734
where are you off to, Comrade?

1425
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,603
To save Rag havan, who is
lying wounded in the jungle?

1426
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:18,610
No.

1427
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,612
Raghavan isn't wounded.

1428
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:23,272
And he isn't lying
in the jungle.

1429
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,942
You must be thinking
why I came here then.

1430
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,747
Didn't you talk about

1431
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,481
wild boars that have gone astray?

1432
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,990
I came here to trap
one such wild boar.

1433
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,018
To tame him inside
thejungle itself.

1434
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,558
Because,

1435
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,253
if it reaches the village,

1436
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,888
it will be troublesome
for the villagers.

1437
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:42,026
Don't look at him.

1438
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:44,632
Aworkerwho's concerned
about his kind,

1439
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:46,738
cannot betray his colleague.

1440
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,706
But he brought me here
since you asked him to.

1441
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,936
That was with my knowledge.

1442
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,310
Isn't it against one's civic sense to beat
up an SI in front of the public, Eerali?

1443
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:01,781
Even if it was
because of my plan,

1444
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,618
or because of your idea,

1445
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:06,818
you will not return from
this jungle, Comrade.

1446
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:10,929
Do you know what's the biggest
desire of a real Communist?

1447
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:14,834
To become a martyr for his
beliefs and his Party.

1448
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:17,528
Those who run and hide
when they face death,

1449
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:18,729
would need a gun.

1450
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:20,938
To stand in front of
a fearless Comrade.

1451
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,409
I'm not scared to die, Eerali.

1452
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:27,775
But I will not die at the
hands of a scumbag like you!

1453
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:14,619
Didn't you say that he
was your best friend?

1454
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:16,712
He ripped you apart, huh?

1455
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:18,148
Is he a fool?

1456
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:46,117
Hey!

1457
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:47,552
Stop <i>m</i>

1458
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:48,720
Sorry Kichu.

1459
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:53,191
But that was so funny!

1460
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,485
Didn't he say that they
were best friends?

1461
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,789
Who will do such a
thing to their friend?

1462
01:30:58,953 --> 01:30:59,931
Sorry!
- Why?

1463
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:01,761
Because I talked about
beating up a friend.

1464
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,699
Bennychayan.
Hello!

1465
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:07,472
Bennychayan!

1466
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:08,506
Tell me.

1467
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:10,938
I am stuck up right now.

1468
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:13,136
I'll do something.
I'll send Mahesh there.

1469
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,077
He'll tell you what the plan is.

1470
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,114
Okay?

1471
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:18,576
No, Bennychayan.
Mahesh will be with you.

1472
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:20,047
Sure.
Confirm ed!

1473
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:21,820
Okay?

1474
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,947
Hey, you should go and
meet Bennychayan.

1475
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,958
And explain our plan
in detail to him.

1476
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,256
And you should wait ahead
of Market Junction.

1477
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:31,824
I'll come along with
him around 11-11.30,

1478
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,031
or, let's make it a
little more late.

1479
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,462
Maxim um 12 o'clock!

1480
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:37,901
I will come by then.
- Are you going to stay here till then?

1481
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,595
I was talking about bringing him.

1482
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:40,934
I will leave quickly from here.

1483
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:42,540
Okay. You can leave now.

1484
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:44,702
Shouldn't we buy some
food for Bennychayan?

1485
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:49,178
I'll buy the food for him, myself.
Okay?

1486
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,274
You get going!
Come on!

1487
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:57,515
I should eat something, right?

1488
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,885
Even though I won't grow
much, I have to grow, right?

1489
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:03,661
Here you go.

1490
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:05,920
Okay then.
Bye.

1491
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,027
You will come by
afternoon, rig ht?

1492
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:11,002
Yes. But before that, you should
arrange everything. - Okay.

1493
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:12,270
Hey!

1494
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,241
Ask them not to
hurt him much.

1495
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,160
Sorry.

1496
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,195
He..

1497
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,162
He doesn't know how to behave.

1498
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,198
That's why.

1499
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,765
You said that he was
your friend, rig ht?

1500
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,102
Then when you got beaten up?

1501
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:51,774
Is this scar from that day?

1502
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:22,800
That's true.
I was a villain initially.

1503
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,171
After that fig ht,

1504
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:26,573
Comrade didn't see
me for many days.

1505
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:30,115
For a really long time.

1506
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:32,751
I was in the hospital
for 3-4 months.

1507
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,045
Then I got a transfer
and went to Malappuram.

1508
01:33:35,343 --> 01:33:36,822
Because of this fight,

1509
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:39,983
even Comrade had to go into hiding
and then to the jail for sometime.

1510
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:44,089
But I realized later that it was
good that I was beaten up by him.

1511
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:47,825
Pain is not just for
certain people.

1512
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:51,693
The one who's inflicting it will
realize it only when he gets it back.

1513
01:33:58,432 --> 01:34:00,969
When did you becomes
his friend then?

1514
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:06,017
Didn't I tell you?

1515
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,643
After a long time, I
retired as a DYSP.

1516
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:11,920
After that, I settled
down at Kottayam.

1517
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,990
My grand-daughter had
a certain ailment.

1518
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,095
The treatment was
happening here.

1519
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:20,728
Comrade had become the life and soul
of the people of Periyar by then.

1520
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:23,431
Age never mattered to him.

1521
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,398
But, he suffered from
a stroke in between.

1522
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:28,297
One side was paralyzed.

1523
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:32,436
And, he wasn't that old then.

1524
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:36,312
He had to bear a lot of beatings
from goons and the police, right?

1525
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:38,108
After that,

1526
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:41,813
he didn't have the capacity to walk
too much or do anything stressful.

1527
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:44,686
When Comrade and family
shifted to Kottayam,

1528
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:47,256
they came to stay
as my neighbours.

1529
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,986
Initially both of us
felt really awkward.

1530
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:53,031
Gradually,

1531
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:56,391
there's a problem only if
friends turn into foes.

1532
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:59,096
When foes turn into
friends, it's good.

1533
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:02,669
So many years after that;

1534
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:07,812
he did everything that he could do,

1535
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:11,907
for his friends,
relatives or siblings.

1536
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:17,684
What's the status, Advocate?

1537
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:18,956
What do I say?

1538
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:21,486
The registration happened
without any problems.

1539
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:23,090
Aren't you all happy now?

1540
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:30,963
Thekkum para Tea Estate which
was closed for several years,

1541
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,231
will have a new lease of life.

1542
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:35,140
The Company is going to
be operational again!

1543
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:39,378
The one who wanted to
hear this the most,

1544
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,978
is inside..

1545
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:44,414
He should've been the
first person to know it.

1546
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:49,314
This is as valuable as
Com rade's life for us.

1547
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:51,719
I'll go tell this to Janaki.

1548
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:52,757
Okay.

1549
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:57,160
Our Company is going
to start functioning again!

1550
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,058
The registration is over.

1551
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:00,732
<i>The Company</i>

1552
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:03,162
our Comrade gave us.

1553
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:32,054
"Actually, who are
you, Comrade?"

1554
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:34,932
"I know something for sure."

1555
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:37,927
"What I heard until
now was nothing"

1556
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,996
"There's much more to hear"

1557
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:43,007
"Right?"

1558
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,932
"Comrade Krishnan!"

1559
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,478
"Red Salute!"

1560
01:37:00,948 --> 01:37:02,518
Have you had any
diseases earlier?

1561
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:03,928
Of course!

1562
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:06,362
Not that. Any contagious
diseases like jaundice?

1563
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:07,398
No.

1564
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:09,024
Are you having any
medicines right now?

1565
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:10,067
No.

1566
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:12,570
Have you taken any anti-biotics
in the past 3 days?

1567
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:15,407
Have you been anywhere
outside Kerala?

1568
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:17,239
No.
- Recently?

1569
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:18,572
Not as far as I know.

1570
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:21,613
I had taken a hot water
bath two weeks ago.

1571
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:23,573
Just for a change.
Is that a problem?

1572
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:25,817
Sign here!

1573
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:32,518
Show this at that counter.

1574
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:03,886
You scared me.
- What?

1575
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:05,490
I've come to donate blood.

1576
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:07,525
They are all here for that.
Just wait.

1577
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:12,553
Where were you?

1578
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:16,234
I was at the blood
bank to donate blood.

1579
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:18,566
I would've come with you.
- That's okay.

1580
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:19,627
Did you donate the blood?

1581
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:22,071
No. It's really crowded.
So I thought I'll wait outside.

1582
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:25,103
It's always like this here.
They are understaffed.

1583
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:28,273
If you go outside, what
if more people come?

1584
01:38:28,369 --> 01:38:30,178
No. I have kept a
towel on the seat.

1585
01:38:32,106 --> 01:38:33,414
Come.
Let's eat something then.

1586
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:35,312
No.

1587
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:36,654
I'm not hungry.

1588
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,352
Why? Don't you want
nutritious food for lunch?

1589
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:41,359
Not that. I'm not hungry right now.
That's why.

1590
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:43,622
Okay. Let me know
when you are hungry.

1591
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:44,662
Okay.

1592
01:38:49,523 --> 01:38:51,196
Yes, Mahesh
- Hello Kichu!

1593
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:54,100
Bennychayan was saying that he will
hit you using 'Paulytechnique'

1594
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:56,131
What? My phone's
running out of charge.

1595
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:57,174
Just a second.

1596
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,244
What was that thing called?

1597
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:00,903
That was pauly... poly..

1598
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:02,446
Get lost!

1599
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:03,547
Go to hell!

1600
01:39:03,704 --> 01:39:05,581
What was that thing called?

1601
01:39:06,073 --> 01:39:08,485
The thing that's used to
make rods for movies?

1602
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:10,221
Polyform!

1603
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:12,985
If we make a rod using polyform,
it will seem really original.

1604
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:14,651
You won't get hurt.
- Will I get beaten up?

1605
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:16,524
Dude, it's something likethermocol.

1606
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:18,726
Hello?

1607
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21,223
His phone would've
run out of charge.

1608
01:39:21,355 --> 01:39:22,629
Anyway, let's get it mad e.

1609
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:24,068
Point No.3

1610
01:39:24,558 --> 01:39:26,265
Three horns of a rabbit.

1611
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,600
Those horns are politician's horns!

1612
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:39,543
Oh, you woke up?

1613
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:44,045
This is Krishnakumar.
He came to donate blood.

1614
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,655
Yes. We saw him.

1615
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:47,686
He was my senior in school.

1616
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,392
He is a major students' leader.

1617
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:51,428
I heard him saying that.

1618
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:52,754
Nothing like that.

1619
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,227
Why are you shy about it?

1620
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:56,467
Only a person who is
aware of his country,

1621
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:58,002
will have political awareness.

1622
01:39:58,058 --> 01:39:59,366
I am SFK's district
joint secretary.

1623
01:39:59,426 --> 01:40:00,962
Let me know if you
need anything.

1624
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:03,298
You want some tea?
- No.

1625
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:07,771
Niyathi Chechi was also actively involved
in politics while studying in JNU.

1626
01:40:08,802 --> 01:40:11,408
Many girls are joining here as well.
Were you an office-bearer?

1627
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:13,383
Yes. I was a central
committee mem ber.

1628
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:15,552
Once I finished my PG, I quit.

1629
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:18,155
It's good.

1630
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:19,782
Being a central committee member,

1631
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:20,751
is really good.

1632
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:23,356
Give me your phone.
Don't you want to charge it?

1633
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:27,431
Oh.

1634
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:29,124
Why do you want to
know more about dad?

1635
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,165
Are you planning to
write any novel on him?

1636
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:33,170
Not that.

1637
01:40:33,627 --> 01:40:35,402
The morel know about him..

1638
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:38,271
He is like that.

1639
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:39,809
As you get closer to him,

1640
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,305
you feel as if there is much
more to learn about him.

1641
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:46,642
Actually, his life has
enough content for a novel.

1642
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:54,517
Pack one of them.
- Okay.

1643
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:57,453
Just rice?
We have Biriyani, Sir.

1644
01:40:58,485 --> 01:40:59,520
No. I will have rice.

1645
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:01,190
We have chicken
biriyani with egg, Sir.

1646
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:03,262
I can give you two extra eggs.

1647
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,197
No.
- Where is the other guy?

1648
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:07,296
Just check the coupon
<i>&</i> bring the food.

1649
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:08,704
If you don't want it, fine.

1650
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:11,174
What will I get by
serving Biriyani for you?

1651
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,207
How a father should be
like, for a daughter;

1652
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:14,806
My dad was like that to me.

1653
01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:18,045
He never tried to control me;

1654
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:20,248
or took decisions for me.

1655
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:23,319
But each and every
decision of mine,

1656
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:25,181
had my father's
influence on them.

1657
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,457
While I was studying
in 7th grade,

1658
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:29,454
there was a strike in our school.

1659
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,688
Something related to
free lunch for students.

1660
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:34,492
I didn't try to find who
was behind the strike.

1661
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:36,561
But I went ahead and
joined the strike.

1662
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:41,236
Usually girls go
nowhere near a strike.

1663
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:42,866
Not just girls,

1664
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,475
even boys were just peeping
out of the window.

1665
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:47,211
While studying in 7th or 8th,

1666
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:51,243
we would just be curious
about all this.

1667
01:41:51,638 --> 01:41:54,118
I also went ahead,
shouting slogans!

1668
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,149
And that was it!

1669
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:57,845
The school headmistress
caught me.

1670
01:41:58,245 --> 01:42:00,657
She asked me to enter class
only after bringing my father.

1671
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,892
Back then, I used to see dad
only once or twice in a month.

1672
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:08,461
I was scared that my parents would
scold me if they know about this.

1673
01:42:08,889 --> 01:42:09,867
To be frank,

1674
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,395
I had expected a dialogue
from dad on that day;

1675
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:15,864
"It's good that you
took pan in a strike"

1676
01:42:15,929 --> 01:42:18,466
"But when it's time for you to
study, you should be doing that"

1677
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:20,904
I told my mom about it.

1678
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:22,745
Next day when I went to school,

1679
01:42:22,836 --> 01:42:25,544
my friends told me that
my dad was in the office.

1680
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:28,744
You might be very
active in politics.

1681
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,722
But do you want to drag your daughter
into politics at such a young age?

1682
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,284
Let the kids study well.

1683
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:36,453
Don't you want them to study,
and get a job in the future?

1684
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:41,763
Their behaviour in school will depend
upon how their parents have raised them.

1685
01:42:42,756 --> 01:42:46,226
You should promise me that such
incidents won't happen hereafter.

1686
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:49,403
You don't have to scold
or beat her for this.

1687
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:52,476
What is it?

1688
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:54,311
Nothing.

1689
01:42:55,702 --> 01:42:58,683
I knew that you will
support your child.

1690
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:00,614
Everything that you
said is right, teacher.

1691
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:03,686
You can only think in that way.

1692
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:06,220
But don't mistake it to
be the truth for me,

1693
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:08,791
anyone else, or
the entire world.

1694
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:12,528
To play around, politics
is not a ball game;

1695
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:16,229
To be dragged into, it is not a swamp
or filth infested by worms.

1696
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,502
Politics.

1697
01:43:19,226 --> 01:43:22,298
Age or lineage is never an
issue for that, teacher.

1698
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:25,639
From the second we are born,
we are a pan of politics.

1699
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:28,742
When children use pens
with blue and black inks,

1700
01:43:29,436 --> 01:43:31,382
don't you correct
them using red ink?

1701
01:43:31,605 --> 01:43:32,675
Isn't that politics?

1702
01:43:32,806 --> 01:43:35,480
Even this green ink pen which
you use to attest documents,

1703
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:36,850
isn't it a pan of politics?

1704
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:39,752
If you use black or blue for that,
it won't have any value, teacher.

1705
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:42,721
If the ink of a pen
can be political,

1706
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:45,661
why can't a 7th grade
student be political?

1707
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:47,391
My daughter.

1708
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:49,763
She is an individual.

1709
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:52,435
She did something which
she felt was rig ht.

1710
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:54,801
Not just my daughter;

1711
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:57,432
All the other children who
participated in that strike too.

1712
01:43:57,864 --> 01:44:00,344
You can't say that it
is totally unfair.

1713
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,605
Each student here should not be
coming to the school to study,

1714
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:05,613
just to secure a
job in the future.

1715
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:06,977
Didn't I tell you earlier?

1716
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:08,715
They should have the ability

1717
01:44:08,775 --> 01:44:10,686
to differentiate between
such rights and wrongs,

1718
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:12,451
by the time they complete
their schooling.

1719
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,417
The jobs they do will
not be important.

1720
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:18,329
How they are doing it,
would be more important.

1721
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:20,698
For that, this ability
is necessary for them.

1722
01:44:21,054 --> 01:44:24,592
In these short lives of ours, the
highest education we should be getting;

1723
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:26,599
should be about choice.

1724
01:44:27,494 --> 01:44:28,768
It should be about wisdom.

1725
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:32,339
It should be about the sense on
how we have to live our lives.

1726
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:35,771
Dad never taught me
how to live my life.

1727
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:38,278
But he showed me how to.

1728
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,350
He lived his life and
taught me through that.

1729
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:45,750
Comrade Krishnan wasn't
just a good Comrade,

1730
01:44:47,414 --> 01:44:48,791
he was a great father as well.

1731
01:44:50,584 --> 01:44:51,756
The best father ever!

1732
01:44:55,989 --> 01:44:57,798
Hello!
Look who's here!

1733
01:44:58,492 --> 01:44:59,493
When did you come?

1734
01:44:59,593 --> 01:45:00,731
Around 15 minutes back.

1735
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,671
Is it? Where is Sudha Chechi?
- In the room.

1736
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,341
This is Prabhakaran Sir's
granddaughter, Sreekala.

1737
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,046
She has a slight
mental retardation.

1738
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:10,444
Not like that.

1739
01:45:10,637 --> 01:45:11,775
Differently abled.

1740
01:45:11,872 --> 01:45:13,408
Rig ht, S reekutty?
- Yes.

1741
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:15,017
Sreekala sings very well,

1742
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,287
draws well.

1743
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:18,519
Come. Let's go to the room.

1744
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:20,591
Aren't you coming?
- No.

1745
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:27,962
If you have eaten food, we can
take blood only after 2 hours.

1746
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:30,660
What kind of a rule is that?
- That's how it is here.

1747
01:45:30,724 --> 01:45:32,726
Who asked you to leave earlier?

1748
01:45:32,926 --> 01:45:34,098
Well.. That..

1749
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:36,565
Come after an hour.

1750
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:39,500
Are you doing this deliberately?

1751
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:40,544
What?

1752
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:42,313
Nothing!

1753
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:46,050
The police came home
for an inquiry.

1754
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,683
I said I don't know anything.

1755
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:48,776
What have you told them?

1756
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:51,322
We didn't say anything clearly.
- What is it, Krishnakumar?

1757
01:45:51,378 --> 01:45:52,857
My mobile phone..
- Oh.

1758
01:45:53,447 --> 01:45:54,619
I'll get it.
- No.

1759
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:55,659
I'll take it.

1760
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:02,400
I'll sit outside the ICU.

1761
01:46:02,622 --> 01:46:03,828
What if they need something?

1762
01:46:04,057 --> 01:46:05,092
Sit here, aunty.

1763
01:46:05,425 --> 01:46:06,631
Everyone else is over there.

1764
01:46:06,927 --> 01:46:07,905
Very nice.

1765
01:46:08,395 --> 01:46:10,841
She stayed away from there at
least for some time, only today.

1766
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:12,706
The surgery will be in
the afternoon, right?

1767
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,842
You don't have to wait
there already, right?

1768
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:18,141
This is nothing!

1769
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,351
That's true.

1770
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:22,948
If dad leaves for
something important,

1771
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:24,350
Sud ha Chechi,

1772
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,785
Long back, dad went
off to Kumali once.

1773
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:28,525
For 60 days.

1774
01:46:28,715 --> 01:46:30,888
He came back after
exactly 60 days.

1775
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:32,589
Two months?
- Yes.

1776
01:46:32,919 --> 01:46:35,763
He met an old friend of his
when he went to Kumali.

1777
01:46:35,822 --> 01:46:36,630
A doctor.

1778
01:46:36,823 --> 01:46:38,461
He took him along with him.

1779
01:46:39,092 --> 01:46:40,594
Not to have fun;

1780
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:43,065
When he saw him, dad was
looking really sick.

1781
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:44,803
He brought him here directly.

1782
01:46:45,098 --> 01:46:46,406
When they did tests,

1783
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,011
he had a very bad case of ulcer.

1784
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:50,376
He never used to
have food on time.

1785
01:46:50,837 --> 01:46:51,815
Or..

1786
01:46:52,005 --> 01:46:54,007
You never cooked
for him or what?

1787
01:46:54,474 --> 01:46:55,612
Stop kidding!
- Then?

1788
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:56,920
Then what?

1789
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,853
Compulsory treatment
for 60 days, completely free.

1790
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,388
After the treatment,

1791
01:47:01,481 --> 01:47:03,757
he gave dad his travel
fare and sent him back.

1792
01:47:04,117 --> 01:47:05,095
Two months?

1793
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,061
Didn't anyone go looking for
him when he didn't come back?

1794
01:47:09,122 --> 01:47:09,930
Great!

1795
01:47:10,123 --> 01:47:11,397
My dear Krishnakumar,

1796
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:13,596
that was not my dad's
first disappearance.

1797
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:15,596
Why go further?

1798
01:47:15,862 --> 01:47:18,103
Even their wedding
was a great comedy.

1799
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:19,476
Comedy?

1800
01:47:19,566 --> 01:47:20,544
Ya.

1801
01:47:20,634 --> 01:47:22,045
You should listen to this story.

1802
01:47:22,502 --> 01:47:23,981
You want to know more
about dad, right?

1803
01:47:25,038 --> 01:47:26,813
Comrade Krishnan had a
different side to him.

1804
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:29,052
What's that?

1805
01:47:29,543 --> 01:47:30,180
Tell him, mom.

1806
01:47:30,544 --> 01:47:31,648
That would be better.

1807
01:47:32,946 --> 01:47:34,448
What's wrong with you?

1808
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:36,519
I was about to ask you.

1809
01:47:36,983 --> 01:47:40,021
In between his
political activities,

1810
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:41,933
did he have time for his family?

1811
01:47:41,988 --> 01:47:44,992
For Comrade, his Party and his
family were equally important.

1812
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:48,563
He made sure that we never
faced any difficulty.

1813
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:51,601
He was the best husband;

1814
01:47:52,165 --> 01:47:53,143
and father.

1815
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,639
Tell him about
your wedding, mom.

1816
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,176
About our wedding..

1817
01:47:59,606 --> 01:48:02,018
Working with Comrade was like,

1818
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:04,112
an addiction.

1819
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:05,985
For all of us.

1820
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,484
Not just strikes and protests;

1821
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:10,656
There was music, plays and much more;

1822
01:48:33,073 --> 01:48:39,820
"Behold! Someone has risen up in
the sky, crossing the mountains"

1823
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:46,623
"He adorned this yearning
earth with his light"

1824
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:53,034
"In these misty mountains,
our dreams have finally come alive"

1825
01:48:53,093 --> 01:48:54,071
"Comrade"

1826
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:10,545
"Over the rivers and shores,
as far as our eyes can see"

1827
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:14,080
"The golden Sun is spreading
rays of happiness"

1828
01:49:14,147 --> 01:49:17,754
"Over the rivers and shores,
as far as our eyes can see"

1829
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:21,128
"The golden Sun is spreading
rays of happiness"

1830
01:49:35,268 --> 01:49:37,646
Due to many misunderstandings
and ignorance,

1831
01:49:37,837 --> 01:49:39,680
your lives were made
really difficult.

1832
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:42,117
But you can do a lot
of things here.

1833
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:43,245
You should do it!

1834
01:49:43,843 --> 01:49:47,052
This age demands a
wind of change.

1835
01:49:48,648 --> 01:49:51,561
"In the valleys where
pine-trees grow“

1836
01:49:51,618 --> 01:49:54,929
"The playful winds gave
us a fresh, cool breeze"

1837
01:49:55,355 --> 01:50:03,240
"While sun-rays caress
them with their gentle touch"

1838
01:50:03,296 --> 01:50:10,236
"The dewdrops on the flowers
spread light like pearls"

1839
01:50:10,303 --> 01:50:11,281
"Comrade"

1840
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,710
There are some more people.

1841
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:14,945
I'll drop them and come back.

1842
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:17,682
Comrade Janaki is an
asset to our Party.

1843
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,624
Where is Comrade Janaki?
I didn't see her.

1844
01:50:23,683 --> 01:50:24,684
She hasn't come.

1845
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:25,923
Don't feel bad, Comrade.

1846
01:50:26,419 --> 01:50:27,955
She won't be coming from now on.

1847
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:29,591
I'm asking you the reason for that.

1848
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:32,129
Since she is working for
the Party and the Union,

1849
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:34,672
two marriage proposals that
came for her, didn't happen.

1850
01:50:35,161 --> 01:50:36,868
We will always be with the Union.

1851
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:40,174
But don't force Janaki to come
for any of the activities.

1852
01:50:40,734 --> 01:50:41,712
So that was it.

1853
01:50:42,002 --> 01:50:43,037
Not just Janaki,

1854
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:45,271
I have never forced
anyone to do anything.

1855
01:50:45,839 --> 01:50:47,113
But just because of this reason,

1856
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,345
don't confine such a
talented girl in your house.

1857
01:50:49,943 --> 01:50:53,652
Have you ever felt that she
is doing something wrong?

1858
01:50:54,381 --> 01:50:55,359
No.

1859
01:50:55,415 --> 01:50:57,986
There are many more things that
Comrade Janaki has to achieve.

1860
01:50:58,184 --> 01:51:00,425
Shouldn't you be proud
of your daughter?

1861
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:01,428
Yes.

1862
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:02,756
That's what I'm saying.

1863
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,892
The farmers' strike is
about to begin in Kumali.

1864
01:51:05,959 --> 01:51:07,370
Mm
a

1865
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:09,433
Shall we leave?
- But Comrade,

1866
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:10,835
What about her wedding then?

1867
01:51:10,897 --> 01:51:12,672
Her wedding will happen
at the right time.

1868
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:14,845
You can say that.
But what about her future?

1869
01:51:15,735 --> 01:51:17,681
If no one marries her,
I will marry her. Okay?

1870
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,780
I'll see you at tomorrow's meeting.
Shall I go? - Okay.

1871
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:34,326
"The breeze awakened the flower
which had forgotten to bloom"

1872
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:37,891
"Lining the eyes with sun-rays"

1873
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:41,131
"The inner eyes were shown
the light of wisdom"

1874
01:51:41,227 --> 01:51:48,111
"The little bird sang songs
to awaken us and flew high"

1875
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:54,380
"Peerumedu has woken
up to a new red dawn"

1876
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:55,419
"Comrade"

1877
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:38,758
Haven't you slept, Comrade?

1878
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:40,530
<i>Basheer'?</i>

1879
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:42,258
What is it?
At this hour?

1880
01:52:46,092 --> 01:52:47,070
Well..

1881
01:52:47,527 --> 01:52:50,064
You wouldn't have remembered in
between your busy schedule.

1882
01:52:51,464 --> 01:52:52,943
But they are worried.

1883
01:52:54,167 --> 01:52:55,237
Who?

1884
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:56,279
Janaki.

1885
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:59,373
Since you haven't decided
anything about her after that..

1886
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:00,944
It's been a year.

1887
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:02,111
You mean Comrade Janaki?

1888
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:03,777
What about her?

1889
01:53:05,979 --> 01:53:08,391
You had agreed to
marry her, right?

1890
01:53:12,352 --> 01:53:14,798
It was a mistake which slipped
out of my mouth unknowingly.

1891
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:20,164
But I haven't come here to
justify it or run away from it.

1892
01:53:20,527 --> 01:53:22,063
Even though it was unintentional,

1893
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:24,004
I have caused such a grief for you.

1894
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:25,267
To get rid of that,

1895
01:53:25,498 --> 01:53:27,478
if I have to marry Janaki,

1896
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:29,373
I am ready for that.

1897
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:32,408
You can think over
it and let me know.

1898
01:53:47,253 --> 01:53:48,254
What is it, Comrade?

1899
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:54,167
Comrade, even though you had
mentioned such a thing that day;

1900
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:58,103
you have never behaved
like that to me.

1901
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:00,439
I shall talk to my parents.

1902
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:03,537
You don't have to be in a relationship
that you're not interested in.

1903
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,279
Unlike what you think, I
didn't say no to this wedding

1904
01:54:09,342 --> 01:54:11,982
because I don't like it or
to live with someone else.

1905
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:13,890
Not just you“.

1906
01:54:14,514 --> 01:54:16,994
I have never felt attracted
to any woman in this world.

1907
01:54:17,584 --> 01:54:18,961
The Party is everything for me.

1908
01:54:19,886 --> 01:54:23,527
I let go of my family, to become
a full time party activist.

1909
01:54:24,224 --> 01:54:25,328
But this wedding..

1910
01:54:26,559 --> 01:54:27,867
It should happen.

1911
01:54:29,429 --> 01:54:32,376
I know that I can never
be a good husband.

1912
01:54:32,632 --> 01:54:35,408
Not even a good father
or a family man.

1913
01:54:35,468 --> 01:54:37,880
Even if my wife Janaki may not
be able to understand that,

1914
01:54:37,937 --> 01:54:40,042
I believe that Comrade Janaki
would understand that.

1915
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:44,650
You've asked for vessels, right?

1916
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:46,585
You should finish all
the work by today.

1917
01:54:47,213 --> 01:54:48,988
Two big vessels;

1918
01:54:49,883 --> 01:54:51,157
Why do we need all this, Comrade?

1919
01:54:51,618 --> 01:54:53,529
This is not just a wedding
in the Party for us.

1920
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:55,132
It is a festival for this village.

1921
01:55:10,603 --> 01:55:13,049
It's his wedding tomorrow
Where is he going?

1922
01:55:40,466 --> 01:55:42,139
Don't just sit here.
Come out.

1923
01:56:15,034 --> 01:56:16,104
Sit here, my dear.

1924
01:56:17,303 --> 01:56:18,441
Where is Comrade?

1925
01:56:30,183 --> 01:56:31,560
He will come soon.

1926
01:56:31,617 --> 01:56:32,652
Calm down.

1927
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,187
Where is Comrade?

1928
01:56:34,253 --> 01:56:36,494
Did something happen to him?
Or did he cheat us?

1929
01:56:36,556 --> 01:56:38,502
Comrade was not at all
interested in this wedding.

1930
01:56:38,558 --> 01:56:40,128
People have started talking.

1931
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:43,240
Did he tell you anything?

1932
01:56:50,403 --> 01:56:51,381
Okay.

1933
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:00,457
Shall we eat something
at least now?

1934
01:57:00,646 --> 01:57:01,624
It's 3 PM.

1935
01:57:02,015 --> 01:57:03,119
Com e.

1936
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:06,261
You don't have to reach
back urgently, rig ht?

1937
01:57:18,564 --> 01:57:19,542
He's here.

1938
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:30,377
Comrade!

1939
01:57:43,823 --> 01:57:45,302
What happened, Comrade?

1940
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:47,065
The discussion went
on for a long time.

1941
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:50,465
It's true that he forgot about the
wedding because of the discussion.

1942
01:58:03,609 --> 01:58:05,520
Did you think that I left
the town cheating you?

1943
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:07,857
If I thought so,

1944
01:58:08,347 --> 01:58:11,590
I wouldn't have waited
here for you, for so long.

1945
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:18,127
"Oh my honey"

1946
01:58:18,224 --> 01:58:23,105
"You are so beautiful"

1947
01:58:25,331 --> 01:58:29,507
"Howjoyous, is this beginning"

1948
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:31,604
<i>"Full of love"</i>

1949
01:58:33,806 --> 01:58:37,413
"Oh my honey"

1950
01:58:37,477 --> 01:58:41,755
"You are so beautiful"

1951
01:59:17,783 --> 01:59:20,730
"I see you all the time"

1952
01:59:20,786 --> 01:59:25,565
"Even when you are away,
you will still be in my eyes"

1953
01:59:26,792 --> 01:59:34,404
"Even when I cannot see the
naughtiness in your eyes"

1954
01:59:34,934 --> 01:59:38,882
"A thousand flowers are blooming"

1955
01:59:39,205 --> 01:59:43,483
"And my heart is overjoyed"

1956
01:59:43,743 --> 01:59:51,685
"And the sweetest feeling is when
I can feel what is in your heart"

1957
01:59:56,689 --> 02:00:00,364
"Oh my honey"

1958
02:00:00,459 --> 02:00:05,306
"You are so beautiful"

1959
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:08,971
"Oh my honey"

1960
02:00:09,235 --> 02:00:13,843
"You are so beautiful"

1961
02:00:13,906 --> 02:00:18,355
"Howjoyous, is this beginning"

1962
02:00:18,411 --> 02:00:20,584
<i>"Full of love"</i>

1963
02:00:23,883 --> 02:00:24,884
Get that flag!

1964
02:00:36,529 --> 02:00:38,531
It's not just because of
the promise I made,

1965
02:00:39,565 --> 02:00:41,636
To hold the flag along
with me during a strike,

1966
02:00:42,435 --> 02:00:44,711
To chant slogans until
our last breath,

1967
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:48,677
To keep ourselves warm by the fire,
in this cold weather of Periyar,

1968
02:00:49,308 --> 02:00:52,846
To hold my hand and walk
with me when I am tired,

1969
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:54,958
I think you can do
all that, Comrade.

1970
02:00:55,514 --> 02:00:57,687
I think only you can
do all that, Comrade.

1971
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:36,898
"My sweetheart"

1972
02:01:36,956 --> 02:01:40,369
"You should march along
with me, holding my hands"

1973
02:01:40,426 --> 02:01:43,305
"Beyond the limits of time"

1974
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:46,967
"On our way forward"

1975
02:01:47,033 --> 02:01:48,478
Done with your work?
- Here you go.

1976
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:50,772
What is this?
- My wage.

1977
02:01:51,671 --> 02:01:54,709
Comrade, it's your wage.
It belongs to you.

1978
02:01:56,809 --> 02:02:00,780
"My heart is overjoyed"

1979
02:02:01,047 --> 02:02:09,023
"And the sweetest feeling is when
I can feel what is in your heart"

1980
02:02:14,393 --> 02:02:17,738
"Oh my honey"

1981
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:22,074
"You are so beautiful"

1982
02:02:22,768 --> 02:02:26,545
"Oh my honey"

1983
02:02:26,605 --> 02:02:31,418
"You are so beautiful"

1984
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:35,822
"Howjoyous, is this beginning"

1985
02:02:35,881 --> 02:02:37,952
<i>"Full of love"</i>

1986
02:02:53,766 --> 02:02:53,998
Keep this.

1987
02:02:53,999 --> 02:02:54,841
Keep this.

1988
02:02:54,934 --> 02:02:55,935
What is this for?

1989
02:02:56,001 --> 02:02:56,979
We give this usually.

1990
02:02:58,137 --> 02:02:59,514
Can I leave now?

1991
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:01,680
No. Lie down for some time.

1992
02:03:01,741 --> 02:03:03,482
We're not supposed to
leave you quickly.

1993
02:03:12,918 --> 02:03:14,056
Thank you so much!

1994
02:03:14,487 --> 02:03:15,488
For what?

1995
02:03:15,554 --> 02:03:17,431
You donated blood for
our Comrade, right?

1996
02:03:17,723 --> 02:03:18,997
We are indebted to you!

1997
02:03:19,992 --> 02:03:22,700
Donating blood is not a debt.
Everyone does it.

1998
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:24,369
Not just that.

1999
02:03:24,430 --> 02:03:26,467
They would've taken the
blood for Comrade already.

2000
02:03:26,599 --> 02:03:27,976
I am just replacing it.

2001
02:03:28,033 --> 02:03:31,537
Each and every thing that is
done for Comrade, is important to us.

2002
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:33,383
Until we die,

2003
02:03:33,672 --> 02:03:34,810
it will remain so.

2004
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:36,852
Comrade is..

2005
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:38,684
Special to me also now.

2006
02:03:39,211 --> 02:03:40,713
Like someone very close to me.

2007
02:03:43,749 --> 02:03:45,524
I wanted to know one more thing.

2008
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:48,860
Actually, what happened to him?

2009
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:52,831
What is this surgery for?

2010
02:03:53,859 --> 02:03:56,135
I noticed that the police had
come for an inquiry earlier.

2011
02:03:59,165 --> 02:04:00,872
If you don't want to say it..

2012
02:04:02,468 --> 02:04:03,879
Comrade has some health issues!

2013
02:04:04,737 --> 02:04:05,977
A minor surgery to treat that.

2014
02:04:06,872 --> 02:04:08,476
That's what we have
told everyone.

2015
02:04:09,175 --> 02:04:10,950
He was the one who
was particular that,

2016
02:04:11,911 --> 02:04:13,549
people should know
only that much.

2017
02:04:14,947 --> 02:04:15,925
Comrade,

2018
02:04:52,952 --> 02:04:54,761
"My life is a protest in itself"

2019
02:04:56,121 --> 02:04:58,260
"A protest for my
fellow human beings"

2020
02:04:59,992 --> 02:05:02,666
"A protest for the
right to live"

2021
02:05:10,703 --> 02:05:11,738
Dad,

2022
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:53,022
Sit down.

2023
02:05:54,246 --> 02:05:55,748
What did the Doctor say?

2024
02:05:55,814 --> 02:05:56,792
As usual,

2025
02:05:57,016 --> 02:05:58,962
to continue the medicines
for blood pressure.

2026
02:05:59,084 --> 02:06:00,620
Everything else is normal.

2027
02:06:02,922 --> 02:06:04,868
Were you able to meet
the physiotherapist?

2028
02:06:04,924 --> 02:06:08,133
No. He is on leave today. It's okay.
I will meet him tomorrow.

2029
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:09,995
<i>_</i> Dad!

2030
02:06:11,597 --> 02:06:12,575
Call for you!

2031
02:06:18,737 --> 02:06:20,114
Activism is a good thing.

2032
02:06:20,339 --> 02:06:23,115
To get justice for a
girl who has been raped,

2033
02:06:23,242 --> 02:06:27,122
Or to arrest the teacher
who molested his student,

2034
02:06:27,212 --> 02:06:28,919
You can do all that, right?

2035
02:06:29,815 --> 02:06:34,286
Instead, if you go behind these ones, you
won't even get media attention.

2036
02:06:35,854 --> 02:06:37,663
And this is a routine for them.

2037
02:06:37,923 --> 02:06:38,901
Loo k!

2038
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:41,564
Do they have any shame, even though
they are in a police station?

2039
02:06:41,627 --> 02:06:42,765
You better go now.

2040
02:06:42,995 --> 02:06:45,601
If there's something with news
value, I will let you know.

2041
02:06:46,298 --> 02:06:47,743
What are you going
to do with them?

2042
02:06:47,833 --> 02:06:49,835
I can't eat them up, rig ht?

2043
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:52,942
Can't say since it is you, Sir.
That's why I asked.

2044
02:06:53,005 --> 02:06:55,246
I will register a case and
present them before the court.

2045
02:06:55,307 --> 02:06:57,309
What about the men who were
caught along with them?

2046
02:06:57,610 --> 02:07:01,114
A woman cannot do immoral
trafficking by herself, rig ht?

2047
02:07:01,246 --> 02:07:04,056
They“ They would also be
presented before the court.

2048
02:07:04,617 --> 02:07:05,595
I'm sure, Sir.

2049
02:07:05,818 --> 02:07:07,798
There's no such person in
this station rig ht now.

2050
02:07:08,153 --> 02:07:09,131
Even if they are here,

2051
02:07:09,221 --> 02:07:10,723
they will escape from this mess,

2052
02:07:10,789 --> 02:07:13,963
by getting bail or through bribes
before they reach the court.

2053
02:07:14,393 --> 02:07:15,736
Didn't you say earlier?

2054
02:07:16,028 --> 02:07:18,304
About getting justice for
girls who are raped?

2055
02:07:18,664 --> 02:07:20,234
In many families, including yours;

2056
02:07:20,299 --> 02:07:23,405
women can walk around peacefully
without the fear of rape,

2057
02:07:23,636 --> 02:07:25,411
at least to a certain extent;

2058
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:28,881
because such women are here to
fulfill the perversions of men.

2059
02:07:29,975 --> 02:07:31,750
You will arrest them
out of excitement.

2060
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:34,048
Court will send them to
rescue shelters orjails.

2061
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:35,124
And then?

2062
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:36,887
Does prostitution end with that?

2063
02:07:37,182 --> 02:07:39,992
You can only harass
these poor women.

2064
02:07:40,352 --> 02:07:42,958
The same thing happens here
in five star facilities too.

2065
02:07:43,656 --> 02:07:45,101
Can you even dare to touch them?

2066
02:07:46,325 --> 02:07:47,929
I want to take them away from here.

2067
02:07:48,293 --> 02:07:50,830
I can't do that without
your permission.

2068
02:07:51,664 --> 02:07:53,337
But you have to give
me permission.

2069
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:54,872
Are you ordering me?

2070
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:56,812
Bloody...

2071
02:07:59,004 --> 02:08:02,349
Even if I slap an SI for using
foul language to a woman,

2072
02:08:03,042 --> 02:08:05,420
there would be enough and
more news value, Sir.

2073
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:09,716
Hope you can understand.

2074
02:08:12,918 --> 02:08:14,261
I can promise you one thing.

2075
02:08:15,754 --> 02:08:17,165
You can see at least some of them,

2076
02:08:17,723 --> 02:08:20,897
making a living through a different
profession in the near future.

2077
02:08:30,235 --> 02:08:31,805
You can take them
to LIFE foundation.

2078
02:08:32,071 --> 02:08:33,914
I have to collect my dad's
blood test results.

2079
02:08:34,039 --> 02:08:35,177
I will get it and come there.

2080
02:08:37,743 --> 02:08:39,051
All of you take some rest first.

2081
02:08:39,111 --> 02:08:40,454
We'll talk after that.

2082
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:12,088
Maya!

2083
02:09:21,854 --> 02:09:23,265
I made a mistake, Comrade.

2084
02:09:23,856 --> 02:09:25,893
We didn't have any other option.

2085
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:28,364
It has been 8 years since
the Company was shut.

2086
02:09:28,961 --> 02:09:30,269
Everyone are out of work.

2087
02:09:31,196 --> 02:09:32,436
All the young people,

2088
02:09:33,132 --> 02:09:35,271
left the hills looking
for otherjobs.

2089
02:09:35,434 --> 02:09:40,440
Many went to Kam bam <i>&</i> Theni
leaving everything behind.

2090
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,249
And there are many of
us, remaining there.

2091
02:09:44,376 --> 02:09:47,823
We had no idea what to do.

2092
02:09:48,514 --> 02:09:50,084
We are starving.

2093
02:09:51,049 --> 02:09:52,460
Terribly starving.

2094
02:09:53,919 --> 02:09:54,954
Dear..

2095
02:09:56,789 --> 02:09:59,531
It's because we didn't
have any other option"

2096
02:10:06,331 --> 02:10:08,277
Your condition back then was..

2097
02:10:09,134 --> 02:10:10,112
Dear

2098
02:10:27,486 --> 02:10:29,261
It was my mistake.

2099
02:10:29,488 --> 02:10:32,094
I didn't know anything.
I didn't bother to find out.

2100
02:10:40,465 --> 02:10:42,376
It has been around 10-15 years..

2101
02:10:43,402 --> 02:10:45,313
Since I climbed that
misty mountain.

2102
02:10:46,972 --> 02:10:47,950
In.

2103
02:10:50,342 --> 02:10:51,980
I have to go there.

2104
02:11:41,894 --> 02:11:43,100
Aren't you going to bed?

2105
02:11:44,897 --> 02:11:46,638
Periyar has changed a lot.

2106
02:11:48,667 --> 02:11:52,581
Now that change should happen in
the lives of the people here.

2107
02:12:01,213 --> 02:12:03,159
Who are you?
- Is Mathew Sir here?

2108
02:12:03,248 --> 02:12:05,057
Dad is sleeping.
What's the matter?

2109
02:12:06,685 --> 02:12:08,289
We want to meet him.

2110
02:12:08,987 --> 02:12:10,660
He will wake up only
around four - four thirty.

2111
02:12:11,089 --> 02:12:13,626
You can either wait here or
come back later in the evening.

2112
02:12:16,995 --> 02:12:18,201
Then we shall wait here.

2113
02:12:18,363 --> 02:12:20,240
No. Let's come back
in the evening.

2114
02:12:21,166 --> 02:12:22,144
That will be better.

2115
02:12:25,304 --> 02:12:26,977
Then we will come
in the evening.

2116
02:12:28,173 --> 02:12:29,675
When Sir wakes up,

2117
02:12:30,409 --> 02:12:33,549
tell him that Comrade
Krishnan had come to meet him.

2118
02:12:33,612 --> 02:12:34,590
Okay.
I'll tell him.

2119
02:12:43,188 --> 02:12:45,361
Mathew Sir will be able to do it.

2120
02:12:47,359 --> 02:12:48,702
In the present situation,

2121
02:12:50,228 --> 02:12:52,367
only he can do
something about it.

2122
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:04,086
Sorry. Papa asked me to
take you back immediately.

2123
02:13:17,689 --> 02:13:20,397
You have avoided a huge loss
which could've happened to me,

2124
02:13:20,559 --> 02:13:22,402
due to an unnecessary
misunderstanding.

2125
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:25,567
If you are in need of something,
whenever it is;

2126
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:26,642
Don't hesitate to ask me.

2127
02:13:28,467 --> 02:13:30,105
Thank you for your
kindness, Sir.

2128
02:13:30,502 --> 02:13:31,480
And,

2129
02:13:31,737 --> 02:13:33,341
I hope such a situation
never arises.

2130
02:13:35,107 --> 02:13:36,142
I was sure that,

2131
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:39,212
you would never come
asking for my help,

2132
02:13:39,378 --> 02:13:40,584
for yourself, Comrade.

2133
02:13:43,281 --> 02:13:47,423
This is something I want
for myself as well.

2134
02:13:49,421 --> 02:13:51,128
It's the necessity of a village,

2135
02:13:51,656 --> 02:13:53,397
of which I am also a pan of.

2136
02:13:53,458 --> 02:13:57,031
Comrade, I can understand
what you are saying.

2137
02:13:57,729 --> 02:14:00,437
But, to buy an entire
plantation...

2138
02:14:01,633 --> 02:14:04,443
Firstly, the plantation
industry is not profitable now,

2139
02:14:04,736 --> 02:14:07,376
Moreover, it is in a huge loss as well.
You know it, right?

2140
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:10,379
Then there are cases, arguments,
workers' issues, etc.

2141
02:14:12,644 --> 02:14:15,625
Now, my children look
after everything.

2142
02:14:18,183 --> 02:14:19,253
Let me think about it.

2143
02:14:21,186 --> 02:14:25,134
If he gets a good buyer, Mehta
is ready to sell the estate.

2144
02:14:25,791 --> 02:14:27,236
Even they would've felt that,

2145
02:14:27,292 --> 02:14:29,704
it would be better to sell it,
than letting it go to ruins.

2146
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:31,700
So no such buyer has
come until now?

2147
02:14:32,264 --> 02:14:33,743
Many came and went back.

2148
02:14:34,733 --> 02:14:37,339
Some of them were almost about
to get the registration done.

2149
02:14:38,070 --> 02:14:39,344
But it didn't happen.

2150
02:14:40,806 --> 02:14:43,047
Comrade, don't worry.
Let's see.

2151
02:14:43,508 --> 02:14:45,181
There are other people
as well, right?

2152
02:14:45,410 --> 02:14:48,118
Or else, we can request
Mehta to reopen it himself.

2153
02:14:50,582 --> 02:14:51,822
I am not sad.

2154
02:14:53,151 --> 02:14:54,824
I feel angry towards myself.

2155
02:14:56,455 --> 02:14:59,197
I have shouted many slogans
for and against that Company.

2156
02:15:01,726 --> 02:15:03,296
I can't let it ruin.

2157
02:15:21,513 --> 02:15:25,154
We thought about it and
made a decision.

2158
02:15:25,584 --> 02:15:29,555
Job's group is ready to buy
Thekkum para tea estate.

2159
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:39,875
We are not just buying it;

2160
02:15:40,432 --> 02:15:42,537
We will also reopen the
company and start work there.

2161
02:15:42,934 --> 02:15:45,437
People who lost their
jobs will get them back.

2162
02:15:46,872 --> 02:15:47,850
Sir..

2163
02:15:49,441 --> 02:15:51,387
I don't know what to say.

2164
02:15:52,611 --> 02:15:54,591
But I have a small condition.

2165
02:15:54,913 --> 02:15:57,359
It's not such a big deal.

2166
02:15:58,183 --> 02:16:00,288
Since we are spending so much money,

2167
02:16:00,886 --> 02:16:02,524
on a field which is
not familiar to us,

2168
02:16:02,587 --> 02:16:04,157
and the place is also new to us.

2169
02:16:05,357 --> 02:16:06,927
When the Company starts
functioning again,

2170
02:16:07,292 --> 02:16:09,670
you should be there, as a
representative of the Company.

2171
02:16:12,531 --> 02:16:15,808
I know about your health issues.

2172
02:16:16,501 --> 02:16:17,809
I am also getting old.

2173
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:19,148
Just a fear.

2174
02:16:20,372 --> 02:16:23,910
The Company shouldn't close down
because of yet another workers' issue.

2175
02:16:24,376 --> 02:16:26,185
For that, you should
be there, Comrade.

2176
02:16:26,578 --> 02:16:27,852
As the Company's man.

2177
02:16:31,516 --> 02:16:32,654
Think about it.

2178
02:16:32,984 --> 02:16:34,895
Think about it and let
me know what you decide.

2179
02:16:37,622 --> 02:16:39,295
There is nothing to think about.

2180
02:16:40,458 --> 02:16:41,596
I will be there.

2181
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,668
As the Company's man.

2182
02:16:44,629 --> 02:16:45,972
For the workers.

2183
02:16:51,002 --> 02:16:52,948
The Doctor had
warned you, rig ht?

2184
02:16:53,805 --> 02:16:54,909
Isn't it really cold there?

2185
02:16:55,774 --> 02:16:57,720
At least, he was slightly
younger back then.

2186
02:16:59,778 --> 02:17:01,519
I will talk to Mathew Sir.

2187
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:03,953
You can stay here and look after
the things there, right?

2188
02:17:13,959 --> 02:17:18,567
If Mathew Sir is is willing to buy the
estate without any second thoughts,

2189
02:17:18,997 --> 02:17:20,476
that's a great thing.

2190
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:25,373
And his only demand was
that I should be there.

2191
02:17:25,704 --> 02:17:31,746
If people are still calling me
'Comrade'; be it a boss or a worker;

2192
02:17:32,611 --> 02:17:34,852
it is because of their
belief in our Party.

2193
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:38,852
Their belief that there will
always be a Comrade to help them.

2194
02:17:39,618 --> 02:17:42,895
Krishnan, the individual
is not important here.

2195
02:17:43,388 --> 02:17:45,026
But it is Krishnan, the Communist.

2196
02:17:46,358 --> 02:17:48,429
It's not just as
a help for them.

2197
02:17:48,493 --> 02:17:51,599
It is my necessity,
that I should be there.

2198
02:17:52,264 --> 02:17:55,575
For that, I must stay there.

2199
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:08,881
Com rad e, Periyar's cold
weather can never defeat,

2200
02:18:09,714 --> 02:18:12,718
the heat of a communist's blood!

2201
02:18:15,453 --> 02:18:17,592
Till there, it's 8 acres
according to the old records.

2202
02:18:18,323 --> 02:18:19,666
And after that?

2203
02:18:20,859 --> 02:18:22,805
I have received some
threatening calls.

2204
02:18:38,510 --> 02:18:39,488
Okay.
I'll do it.

2205
02:18:41,746 --> 02:18:42,724
Okay.

2206
02:18:48,887 --> 02:18:50,423
It was Sanjay from Bombay.

2207
02:18:50,922 --> 02:18:55,064
They received some blackmail calls
regarding the sale of the estate.

2208
02:18:55,593 --> 02:18:57,436
These are all random excuses!

2209
02:18:57,696 --> 02:18:59,334
They are not random.

2210
02:19:00,098 --> 02:19:01,600
I don't think so!

2211
02:19:03,068 --> 02:19:04,411
Not just that.

2212
02:19:04,536 --> 02:19:06,072
Since we have come so far,

2213
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:08,743
they don't have any
reason to lie to us.

2214
02:19:10,575 --> 02:19:11,986
There is something"

2215
02:19:12,043 --> 02:19:14,387
I didn't want to
tell this to you.

2216
02:19:15,914 --> 02:19:18,087
Even I received such threats.

2217
02:19:19,451 --> 02:19:21,897
About the after effects
if I buy the estate.

2218
02:19:22,687 --> 02:19:24,132
Some even said that
they will finish me!

2219
02:19:26,391 --> 02:19:28,598
We've heard much
more, right Comrade?

2220
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:31,363
But this is a good thing that
is going to happen, right?

2221
02:19:32,163 --> 02:19:33,972
Who has a problem with that?
- Excuse me!

2222
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:40,550
Do you have a light?
Match box?

2223
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:42,351
Sorry.

2224
02:19:42,507 --> 02:19:43,713
None of us smoke.

2225
02:19:43,942 --> 02:19:44,943
Oh. It's okay.

2226
02:19:52,817 --> 02:19:53,955
Hello Comrade.

2227
02:19:54,819 --> 02:19:56,423
There's a small problem.

2228
02:19:56,888 --> 02:19:57,958
I would like to meet you.

2229
02:19:58,423 --> 02:20:00,869
From what the documents
show, 4 acres are less.

2230
02:20:01,126 --> 02:20:03,663
The survey was done dividing
the property into 3 pans.

2231
02:20:04,028 --> 02:20:06,133
The area that you see there
is included in that.

2232
02:20:06,564 --> 02:20:08,475
The area which is
missing is in Pan C.

2233
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:16,180
You are not supposed to desire
things that don't belong to you.

2234
02:20:16,641 --> 02:20:18,086
Even if it is a needle.

2235
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:22,389
Tony, you wished for
it and took it as well.

2236
02:20:22,614 --> 02:20:23,684
We want it back.

2237
02:20:24,949 --> 02:20:27,020
I don't understand
what you are saying!

2238
02:20:27,085 --> 02:20:29,531
Son, to understand
what I'm saying,

2239
02:20:29,821 --> 02:20:32,062
you need to see a lot more
of the world around you.

2240
02:20:32,490 --> 02:20:35,437
At Thekkum para estate, which has
been defunct for the past 8 years,

2241
02:20:35,693 --> 02:20:37,798
an encroachment happened
two years back.

2242
02:20:38,997 --> 02:20:42,069
On the company's property
which was rendered useless,

2243
02:20:42,167 --> 02:20:44,545
there are two resorts
operating now.

2244
02:20:44,702 --> 02:20:46,682
As pan of the sale of that property,

2245
02:20:47,505 --> 02:20:49,041
the Company wants that land back.

2246
02:20:51,176 --> 02:20:52,814
Why are you saying
all this to me?

2247
02:20:52,944 --> 02:20:56,517
Those resorts are owned by
a certain Tony Manakkal.

2248
02:20:56,581 --> 02:20:57,889
When I made an inquiry,

2249
02:20:58,450 --> 02:21:00,487
I got to know that it's you.

2250
02:21:01,553 --> 02:21:04,159
However many fake documents
you try to forge;

2251
02:21:04,656 --> 02:21:06,101
You are not going
to get that property.

2252
02:21:06,491 --> 02:21:09,438
Legally, you can't sell
that much land as well.

2253
02:21:09,694 --> 02:21:12,573
I can think of only one
solution for this.

2254
02:21:12,864 --> 02:21:14,468
Demolish those resorts!

2255
02:21:15,166 --> 02:21:16,736
If you do it yourself,

2256
02:21:17,802 --> 02:21:20,544
you might get a
compensation from them.

2257
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:23,016
So you want me to demolish it?

2258
02:21:23,541 --> 02:21:25,452
That's awesome! I'll
definitely demolish it!

2259
02:21:25,710 --> 02:21:26,814
You better leave right now!

2260
02:21:31,749 --> 02:21:34,855
It was my duty to
inform you about this.

2261
02:21:35,487 --> 02:21:37,228
And it is your duty to do it.

2262
02:21:42,827 --> 02:21:44,500
This might be the first
time in the world,

2263
02:21:45,063 --> 02:21:49,478
that someone has asked a thief to
return a stolen property so decently.

2264
02:21:50,034 --> 02:21:52,071
I expect the same
decency from you too.

2265
02:22:05,917 --> 02:22:09,296
I don't understand why we
have to beg him for this!

2266
02:22:09,921 --> 02:22:11,298
Let's just go ahead
and demolish it!

2267
02:22:12,924 --> 02:22:14,597
We don't have to do
anything in a hurry.

2268
02:22:15,093 --> 02:22:16,936
Let's see if he is going
to do it himself.

2269
02:22:17,061 --> 02:22:19,007
Either he is not going
to take this seriously,

2270
02:22:19,664 --> 02:22:23,202
or he may get a stay from court
against demolishing the resort.

2271
02:22:23,601 --> 02:22:27,981
But I don't think that he is going to
demolish it by himself, as you think.

2272
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:31,652
The kids these days, Prabhakaran Sir.

2273
02:22:32,143 --> 02:22:35,522
We can never predict
what they will do.

2274
02:23:14,919 --> 02:23:16,728
Oh, is that you, Comrade?

2275
02:23:16,955 --> 02:23:17,933
I didn't know.

2276
02:23:18,156 --> 02:23:20,693
Have you been waiting for me
here for a long time?

2277
02:23:21,893 --> 02:23:23,031
Whatever it is,

2278
02:23:23,695 --> 02:23:25,140
let's talk about it tomorrow.

2279
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:27,031
Move your Jeep.

2280
02:23:29,033 --> 02:23:31,980
Comrade, my Jeep has a problem.

2281
02:23:32,103 --> 02:23:34,879
It has a problem if
someone comes in its way.

2282
02:23:37,675 --> 02:23:41,316
That's because you're looking
from that jeep alone.

2283
02:23:42,647 --> 02:23:47,096
If you look from here, it's
your jeep that is in my way.

2284
02:23:56,427 --> 02:23:58,338
I wanted to meet you.

2285
02:23:58,863 --> 02:24:00,934
Speak of the devil
and he appears!

2286
02:24:01,866 --> 02:24:03,903
Even if this Company
comes up or not,

2287
02:24:04,068 --> 02:24:05,775
how would it affect you?

2288
02:24:06,738 --> 02:24:07,978
To be frank,

2289
02:24:08,206 --> 02:24:10,652
if it was a personal
problem of yours,

2290
02:24:10,942 --> 02:24:13,718
I would have
demolished it already!

2291
02:24:14,212 --> 02:24:16,192
But now, I have spent
a lot of money on it.

2292
02:24:16,414 --> 02:24:18,655
And now, it's doing well also.

2293
02:24:19,317 --> 02:24:22,161
It's true that I made
a mistake back then.

2294
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:24,322
I didn't care that it
belonged to someone else.

2295
02:24:24,656 --> 02:24:26,727
Now, sincel have
invested so much on it;

2296
02:24:27,258 --> 02:24:28,965
it would be difficult
to demolish it now.

2297
02:24:29,394 --> 02:24:31,032
Not just what you did back then;

2298
02:24:31,295 --> 02:24:34,333
What you're doing today
is also a mistake, Tony.

2299
02:24:34,666 --> 02:24:36,270
Yes. It's a mistake.

2300
02:24:36,401 --> 02:24:37,937
It's because I can't help it.

2301
02:24:38,036 --> 02:24:39,310
You should help me out.

2302
02:24:39,937 --> 02:24:42,247
Offering money to you,

2303
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:43,851
would make me a typical villain.

2304
02:24:44,676 --> 02:24:46,314
That's why I asked
for it as a favour.

2305
02:24:47,679 --> 02:24:50,751
If you stay here, it will
be a problem for everyone.

2306
02:24:51,115 --> 02:24:52,093
Even for you!

2307
02:24:57,422 --> 02:24:58,400
So,

2308
02:24:58,990 --> 02:25:00,298
shall we pan ways happily?

2309
02:25:08,332 --> 02:25:09,675
Take your hand off, Tony!

2310
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:16,718
Take it off!

2311
02:25:21,379 --> 02:25:22,357
Stan the car!

2312
02:26:22,006 --> 02:26:26,421
I know very well that they are not going
to buy this Company, if you are no more.

2313
02:26:27,445 --> 02:26:29,220
I don't have any other option.

2314
02:26:38,156 --> 02:26:41,365
You can only kill the
person called Krishnan.

2315
02:26:41,492 --> 02:26:43,369
But you can never
kill the Comrade!

2316
02:26:43,895 --> 02:26:45,875
This didn't start with a Krishnan,

2317
02:26:46,063 --> 02:26:48,304
nor is it going to
end with a Krishnan.

2318
02:26:49,801 --> 02:26:52,213
This problem won't be
solved if you kill me!

2319
02:26:52,904 --> 02:26:57,250
Not just one, but thousands of
Comrades would take my position.

2320
02:26:57,441 --> 02:26:58,943
Brave-hearts!

2321
02:26:59,544 --> 02:27:02,286
You will be finished, if I
draw a line here with this.

2322
02:27:03,214 --> 02:27:04,591
I'm not doing it,

2323
02:27:05,149 --> 02:27:08,995
because I don't want to spoil the sanctity
of Periyar with your filthy blood!

2324
02:27:10,021 --> 02:27:10,999
Two days!

2325
02:27:11,455 --> 02:27:13,560
I will give you two days time.

2326
02:27:15,092 --> 02:27:18,096
You must demolish your
resort and leave the hills.

2327
02:27:18,496 --> 02:27:21,102
Otherwise, my boys
would destroy you!

2328
02:27:21,499 --> 02:27:23,479
Don't expect any mercy for this.

2329
02:27:24,936 --> 02:27:26,074
Because,

2330
02:27:26,137 --> 02:27:28,048
this is a Communist's word!

2331
02:27:28,506 --> 02:27:30,452
<i>A Comrade's word'.!</i>

2332
02:27:30,908 --> 02:27:31,886
Get lost!

2333
02:27:55,333 --> 02:27:56,311
Comrade!

2334
02:27:58,236 --> 02:27:59,214
Comrade!

2335
02:28:02,506 --> 02:28:05,112
He did that for us..

2336
02:28:06,377 --> 02:28:09,051
Comrade was ready to
sacrifice his life for us.

2337
02:28:09,647 --> 02:28:14,392
Even the smallest things that you do
for him, will be great deeds for us.

2338
02:28:14,452 --> 02:28:17,228
The man who is in the ICU is
not just a person.

2339
02:28:17,688 --> 02:28:20,430
He has the love and faith
of an entire village.

2340
02:28:21,058 --> 02:28:23,561
That's where an individual
called Krishnan,

2341
02:28:23,928 --> 02:28:25,532
becomes a genuine Communist;

2342
02:28:26,130 --> 02:28:27,438
a genuine Comrade.

2343
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:38,481
Basheerikka, the
Doctor is calling you.

2344
02:28:38,542 --> 02:28:42,012
I don't think we can get a clear
idea until the surgery is over.

2345
02:28:44,715 --> 02:28:46,388
We have shifted him to the OT.

2346
02:28:48,085 --> 02:28:49,894
To start the surgery.

2347
02:28:50,087 --> 02:28:52,067
There is nothing
much to worry about.

2348
02:28:52,523 --> 02:28:55,265
It's just a continuation
of what we did yesterday.

2349
02:28:55,393 --> 02:28:56,371
And,

2350
02:28:56,527 --> 02:28:59,303
that wound on the right kidney
which I told you about,

2351
02:29:01,232 --> 02:29:03,269
Since he has only one kidney,

2352
02:29:07,038 --> 02:29:09,314
Sir, what is this?

2353
02:29:09,373 --> 02:29:10,443
Dad!

2354
02:29:14,011 --> 02:29:15,149
It's because of me.

2355
02:29:15,613 --> 02:29:16,591
It was for me!

2356
02:29:17,181 --> 02:29:18,558
It was for me!

2357
02:29:18,616 --> 02:29:21,654
It wasn't for anyone else.
Dad did it for himself.

2358
02:29:23,421 --> 02:29:24,593
Don't cry!

2359
02:29:26,490 --> 02:29:30,302
Prabhakaran Sir's grand-daughter
had a slight problem with her kidney.

2360
02:29:30,494 --> 02:29:34,408
Sir had shifted to this
town, for her treatment.

2361
02:29:38,569 --> 02:29:39,741
As a replacement,

2362
02:29:40,538 --> 02:29:42,313
Krishnan Achan
donated his kidney!

2363
02:29:45,376 --> 02:29:47,117
Nature doesn't have
any such rule that,

2364
02:29:47,511 --> 02:29:51,186
an intelligent person
should live longer.

2365
02:29:51,615 --> 02:29:55,995
And we are not breathing any
more of the oxygen than her.

2366
02:30:01,292 --> 02:30:03,738
Why are you standing here like this?
Why don't you sit down?

2367
02:30:04,395 --> 02:30:05,430
No. It's okay.

2368
02:30:18,409 --> 02:30:19,683
Are you hungry?

2369
02:30:24,048 --> 02:30:25,220
Krishnan's relatives?

2370
02:30:25,316 --> 02:30:26,522
You should buy this medicine.

2371
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,695
Buy it from IP pharmacy.

2372
02:30:29,754 --> 02:30:30,732
Okay.

2373
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:37,534
I need this medicine urgently.

2374
02:30:39,130 --> 02:30:40,734
How much?
- It's IP billing.

2375
02:31:07,491 --> 02:31:08,595
Didn't I tell you?

2376
02:31:08,759 --> 02:31:10,170
He is completely all rig ht.

2377
02:31:17,735 --> 02:31:20,716
He will be shifted to the
post-surgical ICU after some time.

2378
02:31:25,076 --> 02:31:26,521
Didn't you leave, Comrade?

2379
02:31:26,577 --> 02:31:28,454
No, I was about to leave.

2380
02:31:52,536 --> 02:31:53,776
I think it's charged fully now.

2381
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:56,875
Aren't you leaving?

2382
02:31:58,342 --> 02:31:59,480
You guys are here?

2383
02:32:03,414 --> 02:32:04,392
Thanks.

2384
02:32:04,882 --> 02:32:07,294
For donating your blood,
and for being with us.

2385
02:32:09,753 --> 02:32:10,731
In.

2386
02:32:10,788 --> 02:32:14,133
Dear, your dad has been shifted
to the post-surgical ICU.

2387
02:32:14,425 --> 02:32:16,462
Doctor said that we can
see him, standing outside.

2388
02:32:17,895 --> 02:32:18,703
Come!

2389
02:32:18,896 --> 02:32:20,569
Don't you want to see
him, Krishnakumar?

2390
02:32:23,767 --> 02:32:24,745
Comrade!

2391
02:32:27,338 --> 02:32:29,340
Let me see him!
- Comrade!

2392
02:33:45,449 --> 02:33:46,427
Kichu!

2393
02:33:47,985 --> 02:33:49,862
Don't you want to see him?

2394
02:33:54,291 --> 02:33:55,326
No!

2395
02:33:56,961 --> 02:33:58,599
Comrade is in my heart now.

2396
02:33:59,930 --> 02:34:01,341
For some more time,

2397
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,638
let me be Comrade Krishnan.

2398
02:34:07,838 --> 02:34:08,873
I will see him later.

2399
02:34:16,313 --> 02:34:21,592
"You cannot become a Comrade just because
you believe so and say it out loud"

2400
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:27,499
"if you stand up for people who
are starving, denied justice and exploited;

2401
02:34:27,558 --> 02:34:29,936
giving your heart
and blood for them;

2402
02:34:30,394 --> 02:34:32,874
they will address you from the
bottom of their hearts;

2403
02:34:33,464 --> 02:34:34,875
as a Comrade!"

2404
02:34:35,065 --> 02:34:41,983
"Nothing has ever been able to
replace that, in this world"

2405
02:34:47,678 --> 02:34:49,680
Don't be scared. It's my phone.
- I wasn't scared.

2406
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:50,984
It's Kichu.
- Who's that?

2407
02:34:51,515 --> 02:34:52,619
Hello! Where are you?

2408
02:34:52,816 --> 02:34:55,387
L.. Where are you?
What's happening there?

2409
02:34:55,619 --> 02:34:57,064
What did you think of me?

2410
02:34:57,554 --> 02:35:00,057
Did you think I would cancel
it if I couldn't contact you?

2411
02:35:00,491 --> 02:35:02,732
Kichu, you can trust
me completely.

2412
02:35:02,993 --> 02:35:05,997
Me, Bennychayan and his gang
are all prepared here. Come!

2413
02:35:06,463 --> 02:35:07,874
Mahesh, there's
a small problem.

2414
02:35:07,931 --> 02:35:08,966
What problem?

2415
02:35:10,067 --> 02:35:11,068
Let's not do it today.

2416
02:35:12,369 --> 02:35:13,575
Then?
- I'll tell you later.

2417
02:35:13,771 --> 02:35:15,876
Cancel the plan.
Just tell Bennychayan.

2418
02:35:16,507 --> 02:35:17,952
We'll think about it
and decide later.

2419
02:35:18,575 --> 02:35:19,576
I'm hanging UP-

2420
02:35:21,111 --> 02:35:22,089
Hello?

2421
02:35:26,617 --> 02:35:27,652
Rajeev, where are you?

2422
02:35:27,851 --> 02:35:29,922
I have almost reached Market Junction.
Where are you?

2423
02:35:29,987 --> 02:35:32,797
Rajeev, there's a problem. You better
leave from there. It's dangerous.

2424
02:35:33,624 --> 02:35:34,602
Is it?

2425
02:35:34,658 --> 02:35:36,001
Nothing to worry.
Just go back.

2426
02:35:36,126 --> 02:35:37,400
Let's meet tomorrow

2427
02:35:37,528 --> 02:35:38,700
Dude, what's the problem?

2428
02:35:38,862 --> 02:35:40,739
I will tell you everything tomorrow.
Hang up.

2429
02:35:40,798 --> 02:35:41,776
<i>_</i> Okay.

2430
02:36:37,688 --> 02:36:39,065
Hello?
- Mom!

2431
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:41,768
Where were you?
I called you so many times!

2432
02:36:42,159 --> 02:36:43,399
My phone was switched off.

2433
02:36:43,527 --> 02:36:44,835
Where are you now, Kichu?

2434
02:36:45,429 --> 02:36:46,567
lam..

2435
02:36:47,398 --> 02:36:49,605
I am coming there now.
I'm really hungry.

2436
02:36:49,666 --> 02:36:50,770
Is there rice at home?

2437
02:36:50,834 --> 02:36:52,814
Yes. But not many curries.
- That's fine.

2438
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:54,811
Keep it ready.
I'll be right there.

2439
02:36:54,872 --> 02:36:56,715
Be careful.
- Okay.

2440
02:38:24,027 --> 02:38:25,005
Who is it?

2441
02:38:27,664 --> 02:38:28,642
Who is it?

2442
02:38:30,567 --> 02:38:31,204
Who is it?

2443
02:38:31,568 --> 02:38:34,071
If someone is not working according
to your whims and fancies,

2444
02:38:34,671 --> 02:38:38,949
is it right to think that you
should finish him off, Tony?

2445
02:38:40,244 --> 02:38:41,746
If you do so,

2446
02:38:42,679 --> 02:38:46,217
do you think that us Communists
would stay calm, Tony?

2447
02:38:47,184 --> 02:38:48,162
Who is it?

2448
02:38:49,853 --> 02:38:51,560
Whoever it is, stop
hiding in the dark!

2449
02:38:51,655 --> 02:38:52,827
It's not me!

2450
02:38:54,324 --> 02:38:56,201
You are the one who
is in the dark.

2451
02:39:29,126 --> 02:39:31,231
Where Comrade Krishnan stopped,

2452
02:39:32,296 --> 02:39:34,276
we are beginning from there!

2453
02:39:34,476 --> 02:40:00,276
