1
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,241
27 Down Varanasi Express is
about to leave from Platform No.3

2
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:53,286
Passengers travelling
by this train...

3
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,116
...may please
occupy their seats.

4
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:42,369
Again another bridge?
Perhaps it is a bridge.

5
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,484
How many bridges keep
coming on the way...

6
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,250
Looks like uptil now I've
crossed innumerable bridges.

7
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:28,482
People usually go from
one place to another.

8
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,853
But I keep travelling
without a destination.

9
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:37,923
People reach a place after
a day or a night's travel.

10
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:44,058
But I only keep
shifting my thoughts.

11
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,725
Don't know where
am I wandering...

12
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:53,633
...why am I going, with
whom am I revolting?

13
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,373
It usually happens
with me that...

14
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:01,982
...whenever I see a
calendar or a clock...

15
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:06,048
...I get a feeling
that I am alive.

16
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,916
The beginning of life
itself was unique.

17
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,059
What a big childhood I had.

18
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,900
But not a part of
it is a past to me.

19
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:23,365
There was not a single day
with a flash that would shine...

20
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:24,998
...and make me shine too.

21
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:30,535
Even now, my vision
recapitulates the sight of a...

22
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:37,910
...morning, a bridge, a moving
train with a III class ticket.

23
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,087
Sleep.

24
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:59,001
Since childhood Anna was
like a mountain to me.

25
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:02,037
Never asked a
question anytime.

26
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:05,175
Was scared to ask a question.

27
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,688
Who lays these tracks?

28
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,291
We, Railway people.

29
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:34,567
Buy lovely toys from
me. Here's a train.

30
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:56,897
Akka, how does a train
stop with a chain?

31
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,657
I don't know. Ask your Anna.

32
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:16,274
Akka, this train...
- Train, train. Sleep quietly.

33
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:38,363
What? Has Bhusawal
come? Come on, get up...

34
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,930
Hey! What are you doing?

35
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,665
Want to become an engine
driver like your Anna?

36
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,232
Come on, go and study.

37
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:26,473
Get up soon Sanjay.
You'll get late to School.

38
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:32,806
Get up. Don't you
want to go to School?

39
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:57,827
What are you doing here? Go
and play with the other kids.

40
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,958
You keep hanging
round here only.

41
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:23,006
Chuk chuk chuk
chuk goes the train.

42
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:26,679
Chuk chuk chuk
chuk goes the train.

43
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,656
Come children,
let's play a game.

44
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:34,525
Come children,
let's play a game.

45
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:55,646
It runs fast on the ground.

46
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,053
It stops at stations with
crowds boarding, and alighting.

47
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:08,889
Come kids, let us play a game.

48
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,348
Someone comes
and someone goes.

49
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:46,722
This is a game of this world.

50
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:55,675
Bell rings at every station.

51
00:13:56,611 --> 00:14:02,481
Signal will be given
and the flag will wave.

52
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:10,089
Then the train starts moving.

53
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:52,417
I don't want to become
an engine driver.

54
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:18,246
Thank God! Only my leg broke.

55
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:22,683
No driver could have
survived this accident.

56
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:29,090
While I tried to
put the brakes,...

57
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,263
...I lost control
over the train.

58
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:34,559
I kept chanting
the name of God...

59
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,932
...and the
accident took place.

60
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:40,297
What a sight it was!

61
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,778
God bless you
Sanjay. Be happy.

62
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:02,617
I am worried as I didn't
get any letter from you.

63
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,348
Everytime I tell you...

64
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,661
...that you should write
one letter every three days.

65
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,296
It might be monsoon
now in Bombay.

66
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,867
Don't sleep in
open air at night.

67
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,666
Monsoon winds tend to
make a man's body frigid.

68
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,441
Use a bed sheet also at night.

69
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,635
There might be mosquitoes
at night due to the rain.

70
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:30,279
Close the window at
night, if it has no grills.

71
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:35,119
Days are very bad. You
won't understand that.

72
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:38,422
But a son is like a vision
to his father's eyes.

73
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,887
Don't unnecessarily
spend money.

74
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:42,752
Don't eat that Bhelpuri
sold in the market.

75
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,529
Your stomach will
get upset due to that.

76
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,861
Go for a walk in the morning.

77
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:48,728
Also do surya namaskar.

78
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,336
Health is wealth.

79
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:55,832
People keep roaming out
till late night in Bombay.

80
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,777
But you come home on
time and go to bed early.

81
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,212
Early to bed and
early to rise...

82
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,246
...makes a man healthy,
wealthy and wise.

83
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,883
Had your Akka
been alive today...

84
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:11,682
...I needn't have
to worry at all.

85
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,525
I never thought that you
would leave Bhusawal...

86
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,456
...and go to rot in Bombay.

87
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:23,862
Now it is all God's will.

88
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,774
Yesterday I had shown
your horoscope to Joshi.

89
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,170
He was saying that
everything was fine but for...

90
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:35,409
...Mangal, due to which
you went to Bombay to study.

91
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:38,148
I am even trying
ways and means to...

92
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:40,411
...make your life comfortable.

93
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:44,821
O.K. Take care.

94
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:48,121
Skip your lunch and reply
my letter immediately.

95
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,057
Blessings, Anna.

96
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,248
Yes, what is the matter?

97
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,946
Sir, I want to go to
Bhusawal for a few days.

98
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:18,154
But you've just now
returned after your holidays.

99
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:20,353
I have a telegram
from my father.

100
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:21,787
Is everything O.K. there?

101
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,255
Don't know sir. Father's
one leg is paralysed.

102
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,360
Perhaps there might
be some problem.

103
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:32,564
O.K. But return soon.
This is your final year...

104
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,201
Or else you will be lagging.

105
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,081
Filled up the
form for your job?

106
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,726
You won't get
this chance again.

107
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:29,995
I have already spoken
to the Superintendent.

108
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,528
He will set right everything.
I know him since long.

109
00:21:34,268 --> 00:21:36,099
Suppose tomorrow
someone else comes, then?

110
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,434
But Anna?
- What's there to hesitate in this?

111
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,101
You've to work now
and in future too.

112
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:46,409
Then why don't you start
working today itself?

113
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,276
But allow me to
complete my studies.

114
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:53,315
You can study later also.

115
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,550
What's there in
education these days?

116
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:59,490
No one gives a job these
days even for an M.A.

117
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:04,090
Other than railways, I
can work elsewhere also.

118
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:09,733
Else where? Why? What is
wrong with a job in railways?

119
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:12,465
How many facilities are there?

120
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:16,033
Free quarters, pass
and even coal is free.

121
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:19,071
Your Anna too was
in the railways.

122
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,954
I am lame now
without any courage.

123
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:32,655
God knows what will
happen tomorrow.

124
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,688
I want to see you
settled while I am alive.

125
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,896
Had your Akka
been alive today...

126
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,160
...it would've been
a different story.

127
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,400
I am not all that strong now.

128
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:58,676
You've written 2 names
of your birth places.

129
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:02,382
How is this possible?
Did you take birth twice?

130
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,049
No sir. Actually I was
born in a moving train.

131
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:10,061
My parents were going to
Bhusawal from Chalisgaon.

132
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:13,824
Between Manmad and Shirsoli,
I was born in the train.

133
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,461
So, you were born when
the train was at Manmad?

134
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:19,335
No sir. It had
already left Manmad.

135
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,167
Then, were you
born at Shirsoli?

136
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:24,842
No, I was born before the
train reached Shirsoli.

137
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:28,304
As such the train was neither
at Manmad or at Shirsoli.

138
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:30,243
I was actually born
when the train was...

139
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:31,841
...running between
Manmad and Shirsoli.

140
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:33,846
I don't know all these things.

141
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:36,921
You should write only one
name in your place of birth.

142
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:38,851
Take this.

143
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:46,658
Look, this is
Railway, not a joke.

144
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,298
Like the railway tracks...

145
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,530
...we have reached here
today with great difficulty.

146
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,164
You also make a habit of
walking on tracks, from now.

147
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:56,102
Then only, you can
become something in life.

148
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:59,805
O.K. sir.

149
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:46,935
Are you on some other
duty, these days?

150
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:07,031
Sanjay Babu, where
were you all these days?

151
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,627
This letter is lying
here since four days.

152
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,369
I have come to know
everything from Pandurang.

153
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:15,139
He says that, when
you are not on duty...

154
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:17,904
...you sleep and eat
in the train itself.

155
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:19,904
Don't you like this place?

156
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:22,211
Nothing like that uncle.

157
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,674
So what is wrong in
staying there itself?

158
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,677
Not only food, but
everything is available there.

159
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,890
Then, why do you
pay rent every month?

160
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:36,361
My letters should have
an address to reach.

161
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,096
Oh God! What is wrong with
the boys of these days?

162
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:49,568
Is there a bridge again?

163
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:56,783
Looks like the tune, of my life
too has changed like the train.

164
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:58,978
Sometimes on a bridge
or on a level ground...

165
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,679
...sometimes on an
ascent or on a descent.

166
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:02,945
But now I should
know one thing.

167
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:09,424
How many places have
I left behind me?

168
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:13,230
Let someone tell me how much
time have I left behind me.

169
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:15,697
In reality where
have I spent my life?

170
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:19,033
Have I just grown up to
1, 2, 3, 23, 24 years?

171
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,966
I heard the first noise of
train when I was an year old.

172
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:26,369
When I heard the noise of
engines and compartments...

173
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,213
...joining together, I
was seven years old then.

174
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:30,940
I have heard Anna chanting
shlokas from Gita...

175
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,650
...and I have thus
grown my beard.

176
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,514
If reclining on the berth
of the train I try to...

177
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:37,590
...recollect the length
of my past nights...

178
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,184
...I gather that I
am 24 years old now.

179
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:33,806
Why didn't you board
the ladies compartment?

180
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,373
It is more crowded there.

181
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,749
You could've boarded
the First class then.

182
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:41,516
But I have a third class pass.

183
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,786
So what? Do they check
tickets daily on locals?

184
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,155
My both the hands
were engaged.

185
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:53,499
I feel as though...

186
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,794
...I am standing before
that marble statue.

187
00:29:57,771 --> 00:30:00,763
Both had no hands.

188
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:05,671
Keep them both in your bag
and keep your one hand free.

189
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:07,777
It may be useful to you.

190
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,119
Did you get lost
with her in the crowd?

191
00:31:28,328 --> 00:31:30,990
Nothing like that. Poor
thing, she left her box behind.

192
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,789
Don't worry. Stand at
the gate in the evening.

193
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,233
You can meet her there.
- Let us see man.

194
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,667
You...
- Your box.

195
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:44,707
You were in such a hurry
then that you forgot your box.

196
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,442
You might have
starved the whole day.

197
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:47,844
No I ate in the Office.

198
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:50,678
Instead I was worried that
you may worry about my box.

199
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:53,915
I had kept it safe and now
I have brought it for you.

200
00:31:54,354 --> 00:31:55,685
Didn't you open it even?

201
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,848
How could I? It is
your box, your food.

202
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:00,988
Will this train go?
- Yes.

203
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,323
I was searching for you only.
- Me?

204
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,360
Why? I have returned
your box. Isn't it?

205
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:52,395
Yes. But now, I want
to give this box to you.

206
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,797
Empty it and give it
to me in the evening.

207
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:58,394
There is food for you
inside. O.K. shall I go then?

208
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,395
He hasn't come till now.
O.K. I will tell him.

209
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,329
Tomorrow you have a holiday, isn't it?
- No.

210
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,690
When do you get an off?
- Anytime.

211
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,599
As such, I am never
in need of a holiday.

212
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:40,661
I won't mind even if I'm
on duty day and night.

213
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:45,208
Where do you stay?
- Kalyan.

214
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:47,539
Kalyan is close by.

215
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:51,375
Is Kalyan is close by?
- Yes.

216
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:54,109
Igatpuri and
Kasara are far away.

217
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:57,481
Do you always stand
at the gate only?

218
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,659
No. I stand there just
to chat with my friends.

219
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:03,861
I travel on long
distance trains.

220
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:05,521
Perhaps, I may be
on duty tomorrow...

221
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:06,690
...and return
after three days.

222
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:11,028
It is O.K. Atleast you will
return after three days.

223
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,598
What do you mean?

224
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,602
Where have you come from?

225
00:37:20,547 --> 00:37:22,572
From Poona. My
grandpa is there.

226
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:25,741
I have a brother and a sister.

227
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,581
What is your grandpa doing?
- He is a pensioner.

228
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:33,124
That is why I am working.

229
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:34,951
I have learnt shorthand
and typing also.

230
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,155
And in Kurla?
- I have got a room.

231
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:45,063
Kurla has come.

232
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,162
Why don't you come and
have a cup of tea...

233
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:47,398
...and go by the next train?

234
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:49,634
No, I will go now.
- Please come.

235
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:18,830
Please sit down.

236
00:38:27,814 --> 00:38:29,179
So, this is your room.

237
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,479
It is very big. The
rent must be pretty high.

238
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:41,558
Not much. My Landlady is
staying in my adjacent room.

239
00:38:42,462 --> 00:38:45,226
Daily I have to keep her
company in the evening.

240
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,531
Poor thing, she is all alone,
so the rent is also less.

241
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:57,670
As I am away from my people,
I feel depressed here.

242
00:38:58,678 --> 00:38:59,975
Why don't you bring
them also here?

243
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,938
How can I manage then?

244
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:04,508
They will be happy, if
I send money from here.

245
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:08,845
There are 6 years more to
complete brother's education.

246
00:39:09,455 --> 00:39:10,581
Sister is also small.

247
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,051
So, you are the
only earning member?

248
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:19,021
Hey! I forgot to make tea.

249
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,011
What were you asking?

250
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:45,823
Who all are there
in your house?

251
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:50,823
I have an Anna.
- And...?

252
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:56,730
No one else. My
mother's no more.

253
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:04,234
Since when are you
with the Railways?

254
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:06,469
Since three years.

255
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,576
But sometimes I feel, I am
with Railways since years.

256
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:13,084
Since when are you
growing this beard?

257
00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:18,021
Since my College days.
Why? Don't you like it?

258
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:21,527
Yes, I like it.
Don't remove it.

259
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:30,698
Looks like this year
monsoon will set in soon.

260
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:32,769
Look, how the sky is overcast.

261
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,158
Why do you have a
fascination for V.T only?

262
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,001
Because of this
crowd and noise...

263
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:12,361
The noise of coming and
going trains, whistle...

264
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,301
What have we to
do with this noise?

265
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:19,944
If 2 people meet in private,
they become the talk of the town.

266
00:42:21,614 --> 00:42:22,672
And in a crowd?

267
00:42:23,216 --> 00:42:27,778
In a crowd, people take
us to be some travellers.

268
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,086
But it is difficult
to even stand here.

269
00:42:32,225 --> 00:42:34,625
If you get lost in yourself
you will have no problem, then.

270
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:36,123
People will keep passing
from your vicinity.

271
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,858
So, are we stones then?

272
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,588
Not stones, but
definitely we are machines.

273
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:44,292
O.K. Mr. Machine,
have your coffee then.

274
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,394
I have to go home early.

275
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:03,976
I was lucky that I
could clear my Inter.

276
00:44:04,283 --> 00:44:05,773
Or else, I would
still be appearing.

277
00:44:07,053 --> 00:44:08,577
I would also never
have come to Bombay.

278
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:10,121
Even if you would've come
what could've happened?

279
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,255
I would say that had there
been no trains in Bombay...

280
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:13,883
...we would never have met.

281
00:44:14,593 --> 00:44:16,857
So, do you spend week
after week on trains only?

282
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,822
I swear,...

283
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,005
Why?
- So many people are sitting here.

284
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:35,680
So what? So many pairs like
us sitting here and there.

285
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:45,757
Are you really not scared?
- Why should I fear?

286
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:49,460
Why should I fear to put
my arms on your shoulder?

287
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:25,928
Today, I wish to
ask you something.

288
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,961
I too wanted to
ask you something.

289
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:31,965
Then you ask me first.
- No, you first...

290
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:35,472
No you ask me first.
- I'll ask you some other time.

291
00:45:36,475 --> 00:45:37,567
What did you want to ask?

292
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:43,514
I wanted to ask you about the
beginning of our friendship.

293
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:46,818
Are you reminded
of my dry bread?

294
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:48,717
How could you think
me to be so cheap?

295
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:52,956
Will I remember your
eyes or that dry bread?

296
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:54,852
You seem offended.

297
00:45:55,194 --> 00:45:58,994
Where am I all that rich?
I divide my salary into two.

298
00:45:59,498 --> 00:46:02,433
Half for Anna and the rest
to spend with my friends.

299
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:05,637
But...
- Know, what I've thought of?

300
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,131
What?

301
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,533
I'll stop dividing
my salary henceforth.

302
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,168
So start saving
from this month.

303
00:46:14,013 --> 00:46:15,640
From now on, I'll
give it to you.

304
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,949
You're my L.I.C.

305
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,051
You never asked me,
what you wanted to ask.

306
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:29,220
Leave it. I'll ask
you some other time.

307
00:46:29,428 --> 00:46:30,486
No, ask me now.

308
00:46:31,864 --> 00:46:33,354
Have you asked me,
what you wanted to?

309
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,593
It's like this Shalini...

310
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,806
...that whenever I see
my drooping shadow...

311
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:45,474
...I'm able to
see another one.

312
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:51,840
Sometimes it is my
Anna's or at times mine.

313
00:46:55,888 --> 00:47:00,325
Why does it happen so?
- Don't know.

314
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:14,303
These days, there are
power failures daily.

315
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,030
You wait, I'll light a lamp.

316
00:47:22,748 --> 00:47:24,648
It's getting late.
Let me go now.

317
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:28,112
O.K. You may go after
eating your food.

318
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:31,480
As such, I'm not all hungry.

319
00:47:32,658 --> 00:47:35,456
Have a little and go.
Look, I'll cook quickly.

320
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:36,688
It won't take
even half an hour.

321
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,769
Come here.

322
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:52,462
This is a very beautiful
place. So serene...

323
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:53,596
Yes.

324
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:06,945
Have you come here earlier?
- No.

325
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:10,749
You always like noise.

326
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,625
How come you brought
me here today?

327
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:22,430
Don't know. I don't
like crowds now-a-days.

328
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:27,471
I've lost my faith on
trains and traffic noise.

329
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:39,747
You never told me
about your parents.

330
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:51,025
I lost my mother
and my papa...

331
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:57,464
Tell me, why did you stop?

332
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:04,333
I was very young when papa
left home and went away.

333
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,438
Don't know why.

334
00:50:07,346 --> 00:50:11,840
He, mother and grandpa
always used to quarrel.

335
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:18,087
One day without telling
anyone, he left our home.

336
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:23,318
Since that day, we
have no news about him.

337
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:29,298
Someone told mother that...

338
00:50:29,635 --> 00:50:33,366
...he became a
sage in Banaras.

339
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:41,469
Don't know, what was the
reality. I don't know.

340
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:45,713
And I didn't
want to know also.

341
00:50:47,286 --> 00:50:48,947
Mother used to
stitch day and night.

342
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,321
Thus we grew up.

343
00:50:56,128 --> 00:50:58,221
I only know this much that...

344
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:03,160
...I'm also just like you.

345
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:24,212
Didn't you write to grandpa
that we're coming to Poona?

346
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:28,652
No.
- Why?

347
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:31,655
Just like that.

348
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:34,822
If I write to him, he'll come
to receive us in the station.

349
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:39,167
I didn't want to trouble him.
- Oh! I see...

350
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,706
But have you written about me?

351
00:51:44,877 --> 00:51:51,282
No. Afterall we are going
there. You can meet him there.

352
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:27,244
Shalu my child, come, come...

353
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:30,015
You could've intimated
me about your arrival.

354
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:35,153
Grandpa, he is Sanjay.

355
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:44,561
Please come in.

356
00:52:56,648 --> 00:52:59,446
So Mr. Sanjay, where
are you working?

357
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,810
?He is also in
L.I.C., grandpa.

358
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:09,054
Where are you
staying in Bombay?

359
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:12,096
Very close to my
house, at Kurla.

360
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,693
Yes. Very close to her.

361
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,709
Why did you tell
lies to grandpa?

362
00:53:29,515 --> 00:53:32,575
Don't ask me anything
now. I'll tell you later.

363
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:41,849
O.K. I will go then. Till
when should I expect him?

364
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:43,953
Don't know when
he will return.

365
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,357
I had told you
earlier itself that...

366
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:47,955
...there is no fixed
time for his return.

367
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,290
Sometimes, he doesn't
return for a week also.

368
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:52,834
He only likes
trains. That is it.

369
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:59,509
These days, because of that
girl, he hardly comes here.

370
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:09,517
Who is that girl?
What is she doing here?

371
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,318
I don't know much about her.

372
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:18,458
But, I know this much that
she is working in L.I.C.

373
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,465
She is staying alone in Kurla.

374
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:29,572
Give the room keys to him.

375
00:54:39,785 --> 00:54:42,879
You know that I'm
always worried about you.

376
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:45,614
Keep writing
letters frequently.

377
00:54:46,124 --> 00:54:51,756
Please help this
child, in times of need.

378
00:54:51,863 --> 00:54:57,699
Next time, when you come
here, do bring your wife also.

379
00:54:59,137 --> 00:55:03,631
God bless you. O.K.
Namaskar, Mr. Sanjay.

380
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,212
What have you done like this?

381
00:55:14,052 --> 00:55:17,215
I never dreamt that it
would happen like this.

382
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:22,083
I am helpless.
- Why?

383
00:55:23,662 --> 00:55:25,323
Perhaps you're unaware...

384
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:30,802
with me, he was taken aback.

385
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:35,264
I could clearly
grasp his thoughts.

386
00:55:36,675 --> 00:55:38,438
That's why, I didn't
have the courage to say.

387
00:55:40,278 --> 00:55:42,769
I've never mentioned
this to you before.

388
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:46,614
When I got a job,
grandpa was sobbing...

389
00:55:46,852 --> 00:55:49,946
...as he forcefully had
to send me to work...

390
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:52,146
...so that I could
earn their bread.

391
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,856
I had given confidence to
grandpa, not to worry about me.

392
00:55:56,495 --> 00:55:59,328
At that time he had said
while sobbing that...

393
00:56:00,132 --> 00:56:03,158
...''be away from marriage
though you're of that age.

394
00:56:04,436 --> 00:56:06,461
But for the sake of
these small children...

395
00:56:07,172 --> 00:56:08,503
...I'm asking this of you.

396
00:56:09,207 --> 00:56:12,438
Look, don't get married
before the time is ripe.

397
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:14,772
Otherwise, we all will
die of starvation''.

398
00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:19,481
He had asked me to get
acquainted with a decent man...

399
00:56:19,685 --> 00:56:22,916
...from my Office
or from Kurla.

400
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,781
He said that it would be
better if he is married...

401
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,361
...so that he won't be a
hindrance in my path of duty.

402
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,459
Then why did you
come so close to me?

403
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,098
When you were overburdened
by your duty...

404
00:56:37,502 --> 00:56:39,402
...what was the need
to be so frank with me?

405
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:44,202
Man thinks of something but
it happens the other way.

406
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:48,312
I thought that,
you understand me.

407
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,179
How could you
be disillusioned?

408
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,243
The first day when you
had eaten my dry bread...

409
00:56:53,985 --> 00:56:59,821
...I had thought that you
took pity on my dry life.

410
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:02,891
But you had so much of
problems on your head...

411
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:06,129
If you keep
weight on a fire...

412
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:09,093
...does its heat perish?

413
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,208
No, don't cry.

414
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:47,420
Here is your telegram.

415
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:17,126
Anna is sick. He has no legs.

416
00:59:21,998 --> 00:59:23,727
And who has no
hands at all...?

417
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,268
If you had not come,
I would have gone back.

418
01:00:12,082 --> 01:00:13,913
How could I not come?

419
01:00:14,417 --> 01:00:16,885
One who enjoys
eating dry bread...

420
01:00:16,953 --> 01:00:18,818
...how could he leave you?

421
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:23,485
Anna's telegram has
come. He is sick.

422
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,187
I am going today
itself to Bhusawal.

423
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:28,795
Write about his health,
as soon as you go there.

424
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:32,266
I will write. I'll bring him
along, if he is very sick.

425
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:35,065
Bring him here. I'll
nurse him personally.

426
01:00:35,171 --> 01:00:36,263
Here?

427
01:00:43,947 --> 01:00:46,609
Bring Anna here?

428
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:00,821
Anna you...

429
01:01:00,931 --> 01:01:02,421
Got my telegram
that I am sick?

430
01:01:04,301 --> 01:01:05,461
Even then you have
come two days late.

431
01:01:05,569 --> 01:01:06,661
I was not in Bombay at all.

432
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:10,940
Where were you then?
- On duty.

433
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:12,834
I returned today morning
and got your telegram.

434
01:01:13,643 --> 01:01:15,804
How are you now? What
was wrong with you?

435
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:21,112
Nothing was wrong with
me. I was not sick at all.

436
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:31,283
Since when have
you been on duty?

437
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:34,258
Since 2-3 days. -
Where were you staying?

438
01:01:34,564 --> 01:01:35,724
Kalyan.

439
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:40,903
How many rooms are
there? One or two?

440
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:47,271
One.
- Lie

441
01:02:09,332 --> 01:02:12,768
Listen, you take
leave for 15 days.

442
01:02:16,606 --> 01:02:18,005
When you had not come
here for six months...

443
01:02:18,074 --> 01:02:19,200
...I had been to Kalyan.

444
01:02:20,477 --> 01:02:21,569
I came to know that...

445
01:02:21,645 --> 01:02:22,873
...you don't stay in the
room but stay on trains.

446
01:02:24,881 --> 01:02:26,872
I was waiting for
you for 2 days there.

447
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:29,045
But why should you come there?

448
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:33,718
I too have spent
weeks on trains.

449
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:37,590
But train has become
a home for you.

450
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:39,152
But Anna I...

451
01:02:39,262 --> 01:02:40,786
Shut up. Go and have a bath.

452
01:02:51,341 --> 01:02:53,571
Looks like you've not had a
look in the mirror since ages.

453
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:56,773
Had your Akka
been alive today...

454
01:02:56,846 --> 01:02:57,972
...would this have
been your plight?

455
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:02,883
Look at yourself
and your hair.

456
01:03:05,455 --> 01:03:10,290
I too have decided to reform
your looks and your hair.

457
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:18,596
Try to recollect, 5 years
ago Akka died on the same day.

458
01:03:24,174 --> 01:03:27,837
Come on hurry up. I've
cooked food for you.

459
01:03:37,554 --> 01:03:38,680
Come, sit down.

460
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:43,117
Ate your food properly?

461
01:03:43,226 --> 01:03:44,318
Yes.

462
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,056
Listen...

463
01:03:52,836 --> 01:03:54,770
I've fixed your
marriage in Jalgaon.

464
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:01,677
Next Monday is your wedding.

465
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:05,111
You must be thinking
about your leave.

466
01:04:05,615 --> 01:04:08,243
Don't worry about that.
I've arranged for your leave.

467
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,312
But Anna...

468
01:04:11,588 --> 01:04:14,113
You must be worried that
where will you stay in Bombay.

469
01:04:14,657 --> 01:04:15,988
Don't worry about that too.

470
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,117
There was a vacant
house in Ramwadi.

471
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:21,122
I've paid money and
put my lock on it.

472
01:04:21,765 --> 01:04:24,757
Your cot that was lying outside,
I've put that inside now.

473
01:04:25,168 --> 01:04:26,430
I've given the keys to Bhavu.

474
01:04:29,038 --> 01:04:30,403
Your Anna has no legs.

475
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:32,372
At least you're
standing on your legs.

476
01:04:32,976 --> 01:04:35,638
You are a young
man with a good job.

477
01:04:36,112 --> 01:04:38,012
Now you have your
own house also.

478
01:04:48,858 --> 01:04:51,019
Your father-in-law is an
old land owner in Jalgaon.

479
01:04:51,795 --> 01:04:57,961
He has lots of fields,
cattle, the girl is also nice.

480
01:04:59,536 --> 01:05:00,764
But Anna, I...

481
01:05:01,104 --> 01:05:04,733
Now, if you wish that like
your Akka, I too should die...

482
01:05:04,941 --> 01:05:06,067
...then do as you wish.

483
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:21,654
Is there a bridge again? Whether
there's a bridge or not...

484
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:23,716
...but now I must ask.

485
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:28,728
No I am not thirsty.

486
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:31,927
My thirst is to know,
where have I come to.

487
01:05:33,336 --> 01:05:34,997
The Mahabharaat (turmoil)
going on within me...

488
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:37,567
...till when will it continue?

489
01:05:39,342 --> 01:05:40,832
Can't we elope
and go somewhere?

490
01:05:42,111 --> 01:05:43,635
Can't we elope
and return back?

491
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,972
Can we keep running forever?

492
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:49,544
Is it necessary to
know where we are going?

493
01:05:51,588 --> 01:05:53,419
I have no answer
to these questions.

494
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:56,249
Perhaps, I have no way too.

495
01:05:58,461 --> 01:06:01,453
The truth is that, the
train had got derailed.

496
01:06:02,398 --> 01:06:04,730
I had got a glimpse
of a new life at Kurla.

497
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:08,368
A road without tracks.

498
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:11,940
I was slowly gaining courage
to search my own paths.

499
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:16,745
But Anna, again dragged
me back to the tracks.

500
01:06:36,532 --> 01:06:39,126
You know that my daughter
is everything for me.

501
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:41,903
Now, I am entrusting
her with you.

502
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:46,909
I have groomed her
up without a mother.

503
01:06:47,443 --> 01:06:50,310
Pardon me, if there are
any mistakes on my part.

504
01:06:56,653 --> 01:06:59,019
Know that your father-in-law
is giving you...

505
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:00,214
...four buffaloes
also as your dowry?

506
01:07:01,324 --> 01:07:03,224
Buffaloes?
- Yes.

507
01:07:08,131 --> 01:07:09,359
But what will I do with them?

508
01:07:09,966 --> 01:07:12,366
Why? How much income can
be obtained with them.

509
01:07:14,637 --> 01:07:16,537
I...buffaloes...

510
01:07:17,707 --> 01:07:20,073
You must be thinking that
who will take care of them.

511
01:07:20,643 --> 01:07:24,545
Don't worry about that. I
will arrange for that also.

512
01:08:41,057 --> 01:08:43,252
What is this, ate so little
and you are getting up?

513
01:08:43,526 --> 01:08:45,687
I have eaten enough.
Can't eat anymore.

514
01:08:45,895 --> 01:08:50,594
You have hardly eaten.
Come on, eat this also.

515
01:09:17,827 --> 01:09:20,193
You are not used
to eating properly.

516
01:10:22,558 --> 01:10:24,355
Which oil do you
apply on your head?

517
01:10:25,595 --> 01:10:26,653
Coconut oil, why?

518
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:30,424
I will buy a perfumed oil
for you tomorrow itself.

519
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:31,959
Apply that only.

520
01:10:32,201 --> 01:10:35,500
No, I feel nauseatic
with such oils.

521
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:08,064
Have you ever fallen in love?

522
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,166
What do you mean?

523
01:11:13,809 --> 01:11:15,401
That Bhavu, who is
your neighbour...

524
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:19,539
...and a goods clerk
was saying that...

525
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:22,010
...you were roaming
after a girl.

526
01:11:22,885 --> 01:11:26,685
What else did he say?
- Forget about what he said.

527
01:11:27,123 --> 01:11:28,750
But was she very beautiful?

528
01:11:32,328 --> 01:11:34,796
I have heard in Jalgaon
that in Bombay...

529
01:11:34,864 --> 01:11:36,161
...you get girls
on hourly basis.

530
01:11:36,599 --> 01:11:38,999
What are you saying?
- Why do you get annoyed?

531
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:45,270
Does he have so
much of work daily?

532
01:11:46,142 --> 01:11:49,339
What work?

533
01:11:49,412 --> 01:11:53,109
He only likes to
stay on trains.

534
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:57,915
To eat and sleep on
trains and on train...

535
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:05,627
Finished your duty just now?

536
01:12:52,475 --> 01:12:53,601
What is the problem?

537
01:13:12,194 --> 01:13:14,128
Is it that you always
stay with that girl?

538
01:13:15,197 --> 01:13:16,323
With whom?

539
01:13:22,605 --> 01:13:25,870
Swear on me that you
never think of her.

540
01:13:26,075 --> 01:13:28,703
I can think about
anyone. So what?

541
01:13:30,012 --> 01:13:31,377
I am working on a train.

542
01:13:31,881 --> 01:13:33,508
Daily I see
thousands of girls.

543
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,110
Then, send me to Jalgaon.

544
01:13:38,154 --> 01:13:39,917
So that you could make a
laughing stock of me there?

545
01:13:41,057 --> 01:13:42,888
But why do you get carried
away by other's words?

546
01:13:43,492 --> 01:13:45,687
So, am I bad?
- Did I ever say so?

547
01:13:54,036 --> 01:13:57,028
That way, he is my
friend and a nice man.

548
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,230
But keep him
under your control.

549
01:13:59,742 --> 01:14:01,676
Or else, he will again
fall in love with someone.

550
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:13,252
O.K. I will go now.
- O.K.

551
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,869
What do you keep
talking with Bhavu?

552
01:14:33,676 --> 01:14:35,439
Anything, why?

553
01:14:37,113 --> 01:14:39,240
I have never asked you
about your personal things.

554
01:14:39,448 --> 01:14:41,211
What do you mean?
- Nothing.

555
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:44,479
He was saying that
she is a cheap girl.

556
01:14:44,954 --> 01:14:46,080
I am any day better than her.

557
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:48,020
How long are you going to
harp on the same strings?

558
01:14:51,494 --> 01:14:54,156
I have shirked her
like a dust on my dress.

559
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,459
So, am I a dust
on your clothes?

560
01:14:56,532 --> 01:14:57,658
When did I say so?

561
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,557
Let me see, how you shirk me.

562
01:15:00,202 --> 01:15:04,298
Come on, let me
see you shirking me.

563
01:15:04,373 --> 01:15:05,465
Why don't you shut up?

564
01:15:05,574 --> 01:15:07,838
Remaining quiet, I have finished
reading stories of Swami Ramdas.

565
01:15:08,244 --> 01:15:09,472
How long should I keep quiet?

566
01:15:10,179 --> 01:15:12,238
I swear on Saibaba,
try shirking me.

567
01:15:19,655 --> 01:15:24,149
Have the buffaloes
come? ...No.

568
01:16:15,211 --> 01:16:18,669
Don't worry. I came
to know long ago.

569
01:16:19,915 --> 01:16:21,075
So what, if you are married?

570
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:24,009
You had not made
any promises with me.

571
01:16:25,754 --> 01:16:27,984
Initially, I was
waiting for you.

572
01:16:29,358 --> 01:16:30,882
Later on, I stopped
expecting you.

573
01:16:36,098 --> 01:16:39,158
Yes, if ever you
come towards Kurla...

574
01:16:39,969 --> 01:16:41,766
...then please come and
take back your money.

575
01:17:23,979 --> 01:17:25,310
Good that you
have come now only.

576
01:17:34,156 --> 01:17:37,557
Take this money of yours.
This is your paid up policy.

577
01:17:43,165 --> 01:17:46,657
Shalini, will you pardon me?

578
01:17:50,472 --> 01:17:53,339
Will you pardon yourself?

579
01:17:55,177 --> 01:17:56,303
No.

580
01:17:56,712 --> 01:17:59,579
Then, what is the
use of my pardoning?

581
01:18:01,383 --> 01:18:06,320
Life doesn't move on
one's pardoning or excuses.

582
01:18:07,156 --> 01:18:10,455
But Shalini, I am
entangled in a puddle.

583
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:13,691
This is your personal
problem, Sanjay.

584
01:18:15,497 --> 01:18:16,589
But you...

585
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:20,561
Don't worry about me.

586
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:27,799
My skin is slowly
getting thickened

587
01:18:29,278 --> 01:18:30,540
Don't say like that Shalini.

588
01:18:35,284 --> 01:18:38,219
When you met me, the
colour of the sky was blue.

589
01:18:39,455 --> 01:18:41,082
My footsteps had become rapid.

590
01:18:41,957 --> 01:18:45,688
I had started
looking into a mirror.

591
01:18:46,028 --> 01:18:50,590
I can't even raise my
head to look at you.

592
01:18:52,635 --> 01:18:54,830
All this is due to me.
- Because of you?

593
01:18:57,806 --> 01:19:02,209
Only one thing is
lost. Do you remember...

594
01:19:03,412 --> 01:19:05,437
...I had told you while
returning from Poona...

595
01:19:06,915 --> 01:19:10,009
...that I am scared
of sages? Because...

596
01:19:10,919 --> 01:19:14,411
...amidst them, my
father may be there.

597
01:19:16,191 --> 01:19:18,091
I am scared of a
sewing machine...

598
01:19:19,128 --> 01:19:21,619
...Because my mother died while
stitching on it all her life.

599
01:19:23,232 --> 01:19:27,635
I am scared to see
the blue coloured sky.

600
01:19:29,471 --> 01:19:33,339
I have told you also that,
I wanted to become someone...

601
01:19:34,476 --> 01:19:35,807
...but I was forced
to become someone else.

602
01:19:37,513 --> 01:19:39,003
I had wanted a long road.

603
01:19:40,215 --> 01:19:42,206
Instead I got
these iron roads...

604
01:19:43,252 --> 01:19:44,776
...where directions
are pre-decided...

605
01:19:45,087 --> 01:19:46,452
...and you've to walk
according to instructions.

606
01:19:46,955 --> 01:19:48,513
I am tired of everything.

607
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:53,891
I still feel as thought you,
like that day on train...

608
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:57,420
I am not the same one.
Now, my road is different.

609
01:19:58,434 --> 01:19:59,833
I am that same Sanjay.

610
01:19:59,935 --> 01:20:01,926
But I am no longer
the same Shalini.

611
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:05,999
But after seeing you...
- This is your imagination.

612
01:20:10,579 --> 01:20:12,240
Can we have a cup
of tea together?

613
01:20:15,617 --> 01:20:16,675
No.

614
01:20:23,992 --> 01:20:25,619
Look, the signal
has been given.

615
01:20:27,162 --> 01:20:28,459
What should I
presume from this?

616
01:20:30,065 --> 01:20:33,626
When a signal is given,
what does that mean?

617
01:21:07,736 --> 01:21:12,036
Again a journey?
Whenever I was restless...

618
01:21:13,308 --> 01:21:15,799
...and unable to
answer questions...

619
01:21:16,912 --> 01:21:20,678
...I have found a moving
train as my only support.

620
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:23,440
Don't know, why I feel that...

621
01:21:24,153 --> 01:21:26,280
...this running
speed alone is true.

622
01:21:26,922 --> 01:21:29,186
The rest are all lies.

623
01:21:31,727 --> 01:21:37,461
It is a unique cycle.
Run, and run again...

624
01:21:39,201 --> 01:21:40,930
While reforming with
one wrong move...

625
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:42,300
...everything has gone wrong.

626
01:21:43,338 --> 01:21:44,396
That is right also.

627
01:21:44,973 --> 01:21:46,998
A wrong beginning
has a bad end only.

628
01:21:48,377 --> 01:21:50,174
But it is happening
reverse with me.

629
01:21:50,879 --> 01:21:54,246
After I pass a place, that
place becomes standstill.

630
01:21:54,983 --> 01:21:56,416
Questions keep arising.

631
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:01,185
I thought that when I go
to sleep with my blanket...

632
01:22:02,124 --> 01:22:04,592
...I will find the world also
go into a slumber with me.

633
01:22:05,427 --> 01:22:08,919
Mornings, afternoons and
evenings will pass over me.

634
01:22:09,798 --> 01:22:11,288
When I will get down
at my destination...

635
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:13,428
...I may be ahead
of my thoughts...

636
01:22:13,836 --> 01:22:15,133
...or behind them.

637
01:22:15,971 --> 01:22:19,202
A thought ahead or behind.

638
01:22:21,043 --> 01:22:22,908
But, now I should
ask someone...

639
01:22:23,712 --> 01:22:24,872
...where have I reached now?

640
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:37,810
The Bombay Varanasi Express...

641
01:24:38,313 --> 01:24:42,374
...which was late by 5 hours
is arriving on Platform No.4.

642
01:24:50,659 --> 01:24:51,751
Have any luggage?

643
01:24:54,563 --> 01:24:55,723
Pardon me sir.

644
01:25:23,392 --> 01:25:26,384
From where have you come sir?

645
01:25:33,368 --> 01:25:38,806
Where am I going?
No need to ask this.

646
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:42,808
Don't know, when
I will return back.

647
01:25:43,779 --> 01:25:45,406
Don't try to search for me.

648
01:25:49,785 --> 01:25:51,480
Have you come from Bombay?

649
01:25:53,055 --> 01:25:54,818
Did you alight
the train just now?

650
01:26:08,136 --> 01:26:09,626
Had your bath?

651
01:26:15,944 --> 01:26:20,278
This is Banaras.
Beware of this place.

652
01:26:20,816 --> 01:26:25,844
Be away from pomp,
show and sages.

653
01:31:03,898 --> 01:31:05,263
Do you stay in Banaras?

654
01:31:16,845 --> 01:31:18,278
My name is Sanjay Shinde.

655
01:31:20,849 --> 01:31:22,009
I am working for the Railways.

656
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:35,553
I have come from Bombay.
It is a very long journey.

657
01:31:53,314 --> 01:31:56,112
Do you like that picture?

658
01:31:57,585 --> 01:32:02,545
Indeed it is good from
the top to the bottom.

659
01:32:06,494 --> 01:32:09,224
Wow!

660
01:32:11,566 --> 01:32:13,363
Banaras is indeed wonderful.

661
01:32:15,036 --> 01:32:17,971
There are Ghats,
there is Ganga.

662
01:32:26,614 --> 01:32:28,081
Any means of
entertainment here...

663
01:32:31,085 --> 01:32:32,279
I mean...

664
01:32:42,564 --> 01:32:46,159
Your name?
- Call me by any name.

665
01:32:46,734 --> 01:32:51,694
That way people here
call me as Sitara.

666
01:32:52,207 --> 01:32:53,765
And my name?
- Don't mention that.

667
01:32:56,678 --> 01:32:58,839
How did you like Banaras?
- Banaras?

668
01:32:59,113 --> 01:33:02,014
Yes, this city of
cities, Banaras.

669
01:33:03,117 --> 01:33:07,053
Let this city be
Banaras or Amritsar.

670
01:33:08,056 --> 01:33:09,489
I had boarded a train.

671
01:33:10,391 --> 01:33:12,825
When the train stopped, I
found that I was in Banaras.

672
01:33:13,161 --> 01:33:15,095
You mean you go anywhere
without any goal?

673
01:33:16,798 --> 01:33:18,231
What is there
to laugh in this?

674
01:33:19,133 --> 01:33:21,658
Just like that.
People who come here...

675
01:33:22,136 --> 01:33:24,661
...know before hand
where they want to go.

676
01:33:25,106 --> 01:33:26,232
And you are one...

677
01:33:30,678 --> 01:33:33,408
Why don't you remove your
shoes and sit comfortably?

678
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:03,802
Yesterday, you were overjoyed
seeing my dance number.

679
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:06,679
You had thrown
ten rupees at me.

680
01:34:08,082 --> 01:34:09,208
What do you wish to say?

681
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:14,077
What will you
pledge on me now?

682
01:34:15,256 --> 01:34:16,314
I will give myself to you.

683
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:36,904
If ever you come to know that
I am not the one as I look...

684
01:34:38,313 --> 01:34:39,780
I will have no objection then.

685
01:34:40,548 --> 01:34:42,675
Even if you say that
you are married...

686
01:34:43,017 --> 01:34:44,177
...it won't bother me.

687
01:34:44,385 --> 01:34:48,412
Even if you have a lover,
I am not concerned with her.

688
01:34:49,724 --> 01:34:52,158
If you say that you are
going to die tomorrow...

689
01:34:52,694 --> 01:34:54,355
...then who am I to stop you?

690
01:34:54,762 --> 01:34:56,696
But why are you so
unconcerned about things?

691
01:34:58,333 --> 01:35:01,325
Because I am much
above all these, so ...

692
01:35:01,836 --> 01:35:05,135
...I am unconcerned
about them.

693
01:35:20,455 --> 01:35:21,979
Today I am wishing
for a special thing.

694
01:35:22,857 --> 01:35:26,122
Whatever is there,
it is before you now.

695
01:35:28,129 --> 01:35:29,357
Then what is that
special thing?

696
01:35:29,998 --> 01:35:32,330
Give me a word.
- O.K.

697
01:35:35,403 --> 01:35:37,166
Today, you will not put
out the light in the room.

698
01:35:38,439 --> 01:35:40,634
You will not hang a
dark curtain before me.

699
01:35:41,442 --> 01:35:44,605
Why? - I have
more than Rs.100/-.

700
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:48,676
Take away all that money
and give me brightness.

701
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:51,885
But, I...
- You have given me a word.

702
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:45,527
What have you done?
You had given me a word.

703
01:38:33,314 --> 01:38:34,838
Corpse...

704
01:38:44,058 --> 01:38:47,550
What is the matter?
Were you scared?

705
01:38:47,995 --> 01:38:49,121
No.

706
01:38:52,433 --> 01:38:55,994
Nothing. Just got a bad dream.

707
01:38:59,907 --> 01:39:03,104
Go to sleep. I am
in the adjacent room.

708
01:39:03,477 --> 01:39:05,138
Call me, if you need my help.

709
01:39:58,399 --> 01:39:59,923
Again I am starting
my my journey...

710
01:40:01,269 --> 01:40:03,134
...from Banaras,
back to my home.

711
01:40:05,106 --> 01:40:09,008
Man returns back only after
all roads have closed on him.

712
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:39,333
Have you come back?
When did you return?

713
01:40:40,007 --> 01:40:42,168
Did you come by
the morning train?

714
01:40:44,145 --> 01:40:48,013
How could you run
away like this?

715
01:40:49,083 --> 01:40:51,415
I am doing all this
for your sake only.

716
01:40:51,852 --> 01:40:54,548
I am an old man.
I am alive today.

717
01:40:54,789 --> 01:40:56,051
Who knows about tomorrow?

718
01:42:01,255 --> 01:42:03,917
Are you still in her thoughts?

719
01:42:28,282 --> 01:42:31,740
What is the matter? You are
not drinking your tea also.

720
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:42,454
Where were you all these days?

721
01:42:42,763 --> 01:42:45,391
Varanasi.
- Where is that?

722
01:42:46,233 --> 01:42:49,031
It is at Kashi.
- Went there for some work?

723
01:42:51,305 --> 01:42:52,602
No
- Then?

724
01:42:53,841 --> 01:42:55,274
I was fed up of this place.

725
01:42:57,578 --> 01:42:58,840
Fed up of me?
- No.

726
01:43:00,481 --> 01:43:04,042
Then?
- With nobody.

727
01:43:20,134 --> 01:43:23,570
Nearly Rs.500/-, monthly,
we get with these buffaloes.

728
01:43:24,939 --> 01:43:27,169
Rs.50

729
01:43:27,308 --> 01:43:29,776
But here, I am there for that.
So that money is also saved.

730
01:43:31,112 --> 01:43:34,479
If you wish, you can save
some money from your salary.

731
01:43:34,715 --> 01:43:37,206
This place behind Ramwadi...

732
01:43:37,551 --> 01:43:38,916
..we can purchase that place.

733
01:43:39,253 --> 01:43:40,811
Then we can have
our own place.

734
01:43:41,755 --> 01:43:46,488
Suppose in 2-3 years,
4 buffaloes become 8,...

735
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,324
...you can leave
your job, if you wish.

736
01:43:59,607 --> 01:44:00,767
Move away...

737
01:44:11,652 --> 01:44:13,950
Get up my dear.
Give my breakfast.

738
01:44:28,202 --> 01:44:30,636
Are you alright?
- What?

739
01:44:31,906 --> 01:44:34,704
Are you alright?

740
01:44:37,611 --> 01:44:38,839
Will you have your
food now or later?

741
01:44:39,213 --> 01:44:40,840
No.
- Why?

742
01:44:41,248 --> 01:44:42,408
Just like that.

743
01:44:43,484 --> 01:44:44,883
So, has she broken your heart?

744
01:44:45,819 --> 01:44:46,911
What?

745
01:44:47,254 --> 01:44:49,654
Why didn't you take
her with you there?

746
01:44:50,024 --> 01:44:51,150
You could've taken her along.

747
01:44:52,459 --> 01:44:53,653
There are lots of
mosquitoes here.

748
01:44:57,798 --> 01:44:59,026
Good that you have come back.

749
01:45:00,367 --> 01:45:03,962
Return?
- Yes. Have not you returned?

750
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:08,137
No.
- Then?

751
01:45:09,043 --> 01:45:10,237
I have come running
away from there.

752
01:45:10,778 --> 01:45:13,906
What did you do there,
that you came running here?

753
01:45:15,249 --> 01:45:16,773
What was wrong here
that I ran away?

754
01:45:19,386 --> 01:45:20,853
You did not like my love.

755
01:45:22,389 --> 01:45:23,515
Started again...

756
01:45:25,492 --> 01:45:27,790
Said something?
- No.

757
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:47,144
I have returned
disillusioned...

758
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:49,782
...that I could start
from the beginning again...

759
01:45:50,884 --> 01:45:54,047
...perhaps my wife is slowly
getting transformed into a buffalo.

760
01:45:55,089 --> 01:45:58,718
Slowly this house may
become a dairy farm.

761
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:03,987
Perhaps we may eat their
grass and fodder one day.

762
01:47:14,134 --> 01:47:15,897
Who is it?
- Me.

763
01:47:18,572 --> 01:47:19,732
You?

764
01:47:21,475 --> 01:47:23,966
Yes, it is me, Sanjay.

765
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:27,307
Please sit down.

766
01:47:29,416 --> 01:47:31,384
You need not get scared of me.

767
01:47:33,287 --> 01:47:36,279
Now I have become matured.

768
01:47:38,392 --> 01:47:40,917
Just as we remove the thorn
from our leg and throw...

769
01:47:42,563 --> 01:47:44,690
...likewise, I have
thrown my fear out.

770
01:47:52,039 --> 01:47:55,304
Good that you have returned.
- Returned?

771
01:47:56,777 --> 01:47:58,039
I can never return back.

772
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,643
I don't know the
trick to return back.

773
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:06,651
I have come running.
- Running?

774
01:48:08,288 --> 01:48:10,051
I ran away from
Kalyan to Banaras.

775
01:48:11,258 --> 01:48:12,987
From there I came
running to Kalyan.

776
01:48:14,128 --> 01:48:15,789
From Kalyan, I have come
running to Kurla, now.

777
01:48:17,865 --> 01:48:21,528
No. Now I don't want
to go anywhere, running.

778
01:48:23,103 --> 01:48:24,695
I am tired of running.

779
01:48:34,982 --> 01:48:36,643
I will make tea for you.

780
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:53,991
That day, you must
have got angry with me.

781
01:48:54,802 --> 01:48:55,962
So what?

782
01:48:56,136 --> 01:48:58,001
Fist tell me, were
you annoyed or not?

783
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,434
I don't know.

784
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:05,276
To tell the truth, the
day I came to know that...

785
01:49:05,345 --> 01:49:07,006
...you have come from Bhusawal
after getting married...

786
01:49:07,881 --> 01:49:09,314
...I thought of
teaching you a lesson.

787
01:49:10,150 --> 01:49:13,586
Thought of marrying the first
man, I saw outside and...

788
01:49:14,121 --> 01:49:17,284
...tell my husband that...
- Why did you stop?

789
01:49:18,792 --> 01:49:21,124
I had told you that
nothing happens with anger.

790
01:49:22,362 --> 01:49:23,659
You definitely become strong.

791
01:49:24,531 --> 01:49:26,021
So you are strong
now, isn't it?

792
01:49:27,801 --> 01:49:28,859
Yes.

793
01:49:30,237 --> 01:49:31,465
So, shall we decide tomorrow?

794
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:37,871
Decide?
- Yes.

795
01:49:42,916 --> 01:49:47,148
O.K. Come to the station
tomorrow at 5 P.M.

796
01:49:48,255 --> 01:49:49,722
I will wait for you there.

797
01:49:52,092 --> 01:49:53,354
Let us decide there itself.

798
01:53:13,994 --> 01:53:16,895
I had said wrongly
that we have to decide.

799
01:53:18,532 --> 01:53:21,626
Now I have neither
to run or to return.

800
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:25,599
Now I don't wish
to reach anywhere.

801
01:53:26,506 --> 01:53:27,837
I just wish to walk.
