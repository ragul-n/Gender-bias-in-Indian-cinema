1
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,140
"Born in this world,
I jumped in the arms of my momma."

2
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,350
"My momma..."

3
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,430
"When I got into school,
I danced to the tune of cha-cha."

4
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,390
"Yeah, cha-cha..."

5
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,930
"Running after butterflies
is where I belonged."

6
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,390
"Small were my feet
but the sky was my limit."

7
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,220
Raju...

8
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,430
- Mom...
- Raju...

9
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,550
"Then tragedy struck my-oh-my."

10
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,930
"Like in the movies, I got separated..."

11
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,100
"...from my momma."

12
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,050
"Wearing the badge of 786
showed up big brother."

13
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,550
What do you have?

14
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,430
Me...

15
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,100
I...
I don't have mom.

16
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,930
"So big brother said learn
to smile in your sorrows."

17
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,430
"Life is all about
lending a hand."

18
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,180
"Since that day
no one messed with me."

19
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,510
"...little cracker, that was me..."

20
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,930
"Like a free kite,
Raju soared in the sky."

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,180
"Hey Coolie."

22
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,250
I like your son.

23
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,170
Nice boy.

24
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,920
Let Jeffery my son take a look...

25
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,300
...and then we can decide.

26
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,590
- Yes, of course.
- Heaven on the Docks, man!

27
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,840
That's him.

28
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,920
Whiskey on the rocks, man!

29
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,340
The favourite son of the Lord.

30
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,630
Jeffery Rozario.

31
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,210
Hello, Mr. Rozario.

32
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,500
I am Jai Kishen.

33
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,630
Marriages are made in heaven but...

34
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,670
...my job is bring families together.

35
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,920
I got it. You're an agent.

36
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,210
Rozario!

37
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,840
Marriage agent, mom.

38
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,710
Mr. Rozario, let the boy
and girl get to know each other...

39
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,340
...then we can continue this conversation.

40
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,920
Where is your daughter Sarah?

41
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,960
- I'll go get her.
- Hold it!

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Just for my knowledge.

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,590
How did you guys get here?

44
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,170
Bus.

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Bus?

46
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,670
Bus?

47
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,250
Bus?

48
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,210
You were dreaming about making my daughter
Your daughter-in-law

49
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,130
...and what did you guys travel in?
A Bus?

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,750
Enough!

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,380
We can't have any
relation with these guys...

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,670
...because they are already
related to poverty.

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,050
- Go!
- JP, you're going too far.

54
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,420
What far, mummy? I am still here.

55
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,090
And you, agent.

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
You know what kind of
son-in-law I am looking for.

57
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,340
A son-in-law who charters an airplane
to buy groceries .

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,500
If a country wants to borrow money,
they should ask him.

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,380
I want a stinking rich
son-in-law for my daughter.

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,960
And you brought me these
stinking cheese rolls! Goddamn.

61
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,380
- Goddamn!
- That was pretty humiliating.

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,500
Come on, son. Let's go.

63
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,000
- Rude. Very Rude.
- Listen...

64
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,460
I never imagined humiliation
can be pretty, man.

65
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,500
Jeffery, you have two daughters.

66
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,800
This is not the way to behave.

67
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,840
Do I wait until I've a third daughter?

68
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,800
Mummy, please don't interfere.

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,800
Please go light candles
in front of Christ.

70
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,380
- Pinto.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,590
- Give her a few candles. Keep her busy.
- Come on, mummy.

72
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,920
No good relatives and no good agent.

73
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,670
Jeffery Rozario,
I am a devoted Pundit.

74
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,800
My self-respect is my pride.

75
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
But you...

76
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,420
You're blinded by your arrogance.

77
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,170
But coming to the point...

78
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,750
You'll pay for your ego.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,300
What ego?

80
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,710
You go, man.

81
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,550
I am going.

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,050
But I'll come back soon.

83
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,840
Because I'll be the one who gets your daughter married.

84
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,380
Okay, you can whatsApp
me the rest later.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,090
'I'll find you a son-in-law
who will shatter your pride.'

86
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,000
'A son-in-law who will
strip you off your reputation.'

87
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:48,800
'A son-in-law who will shatter
your ego as easily as counting 3...2...1..."

88
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,420
Stop, sir.

89
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,210
I can't carry anymore.

90
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Why don't you hire another coolie, sir?

91
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,340
Money doesn't come easy.
Take it.

92
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,590
No, sir.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,880
Uncle, are you alright?

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,880
Raju...

95
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,460
Sir, this is not the way.

96
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,670
This is what I am paying him for...

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,340
...so he must carry all the luggage.

98
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,920
If you're feeling so sympathetic,
then you carry it

99
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,300
Unbelievable, sir.

100
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,880
I am being polite
while you're being so disrespectful.

101
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,000
If you see the real me
you'll be humiliated

102
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,630
Get lost coolie!

103
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,670
Hey...!

104
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,800
Listen, you piece of a mozzarella stick.

105
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,920
You don't know but I can see the future.

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,750
I am an astronaut.

107
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,840
That's astrologer, you idiot.

108
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,090
That's right.

109
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,000
Because I can see in one minute
you'll be carrying your own bags.

110
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,300
Because I am highly trained to train
those who think that they are trained.

111
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,710
Whether they are in front
of the train or behind the train.

112
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Because I fight off the train,
by the train, for the train.

113
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,130
See...train.

114
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,090
Beat him. Beat him. Beat him.

115
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,920
Move. Move.

116
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,170
Wait.

117
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,090
Beat him. Raju, beat him.

118
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,840
Drugs.

119
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,550
Meow-Meow...

120
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,130
You were carrying drugs.

121
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:19,500
Drugs is an addiction
that spares no one.

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Today it's him, tomorrow someone else.

123
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,630
Now it's your turn.

124
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,710
Bravo, sir.

125
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,300
"Drugs on a roll..."

126
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,800
"...there's no way out for him."

127
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,050
Well done, Raju.

128
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,590
You should've been on the Police force.

129
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,550
Please, sir. I was just doing my job.

130
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,960
Hey wise guy.

131
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,300
What?

132
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,170
Celebrate all you want

133
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,090
But when I come out
that will be your last.

134
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,250
See...he's threatening me.

135
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,340
Why don't you kill
these guys in an encounter?

136
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Why don't you join the Police force?

137
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,960
Exactly.

138
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,590
As for you...

139
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,880
Threatening me is futile.
Because I've no kin to cry.

140
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,500
The world's my home,
the station's my hangout...

141
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,300
...come over whenever you like,
name's Raju.

142
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,380
And people call me "Coolie No. 1".

143
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,250
Coolie?

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,880
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,130
You brought a coolie to my door.

146
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,300
- Deepak.
- Hold on.

147
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,800
So what, sir?

148
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,670
Don't mind,
but you're not some emperor.

149
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,130
You're just a driver.

150
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,090
I may be a driver,
but I've respect.

151
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,130
I drive expensive cars.

152
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's presume that I
let him marry my daughter...

153
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,380
...and the trains go on a strike tomorrow.

154
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,460
He'll starve to death.

155
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,800
How will he feed
himself and my daughter?

156
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,800
Why do you care?
She's my wife.

157
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,960
I'll beg-borrow for her.
Why do you care?

158
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,250
See...he's already
admitting he's a beggar.

159
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,130
Keep it back!

160
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,170
I feel like giving you a good whack.
Who are you calling a beggar?

161
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,170
You.

162
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Who do you think you are some emperor?

163
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,340
Get lost.

164
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,920
Go to the station and carry luggage.

165
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,250
I'll do just that. I am a coolie.

166
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,380
But everyone today is a coolie.

167
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,840
Everyone's carrying a burden on their shoulder.

168
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,340
Whether it's his sorrows, debt, or just life.

169
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,000
And you...

170
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,250
You're a burden on this earth.

171
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,420
Burden?

172
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,050
Shalini, listen. I like you,
but your father's scrooge.

173
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,300
Come with me,
I'll treat you like a prisoner.

174
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,750
- You mean princess.
- Yes, I'll treat you like a princess.

175
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,050
Come with me.

176
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,550
How...

177
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,090
How...

178
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,630
They left.

179
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,800
They...how dare you...

180
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,340
'Agent.'

181
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,800
'You know, what kind of
son-in-law I am looking for.'

182
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,670
'A son-in-law who charters an airplane
to buy groceries .'

183
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,340
'If a country wants to borrow money,
they should ask him.'

184
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,130
'I want a stinking rich
son-in-law for my daughter.'

185
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,000
I guess I'll never get married.

186
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,300
Cute cheeks.

187
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,750
Pretty tresses.

188
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,550
She's fantastic.

189
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,300
Raju.

190
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,090
What are you doing, son?

191
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,130
- Raju...
- Train's coming.

192
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,550
Raju!

193
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,920
Raju, the train's coming!

194
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,550
Son, the train was so close.

195
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,300
What if it had crushed you?

196
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,630
Correction uncle, I am already crushed.

197
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:18,920
Oh no...

198
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,500
Tear it and you'll face my wrath.

199
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,050
Return my picture to me.

200
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,090
What's the name?

201
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,420
Raju. Coolie no. 1.

202
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,550
Her name !!!.

203
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,460
Mrs. Raju.

204
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,090
This is my picture. Her name is Sarah.

205
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,210
Sarah

206
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,590
Couldn't be any better.
She's just the one I was looking for.

207
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,460
Look...

208
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,420
Jai Kishen.

209
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,880
Pandit Jai Kishen.

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,050
Pundit sir.

211
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,880
If Sarah wasn't made for me...

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,800
...this picture could've gone left,
or right.

213
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,710
And not landed on my body.

214
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,840
I think we've a connection.

215
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,550
Look son, she'll blow your fuse.

216
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,460
She's from a rich family.

217
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,800
I wouldn't have minded if she was poor.

218
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,050
Tell her I just want her.

219
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,340
I'll carry her on in my shoulder like a queen.

220
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,880
Can't get over your profession huh.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,750
Pandit sir,
old habits die hard you know.

222
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,300
'I want a stinking rich
son-in-law for my daughter.'

223
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,630
Pandit sir, what thinking?

224
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,800
Thinking that I'll
get Raju and Sarah married.

225
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,800
Honestly?

226
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,300
Pandit sir, come here.

227
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,170
Sit.

228
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,670
You see, I was humiliated by a lowly driver.

229
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,800
And you were saying she's a billionaire.

230
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,380
Imagine how much they will humiliate me.

231
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,840
We're friends now, okay.

232
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,550
Sit up.
Come on.

233
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,630
Your job is to marry this girl.

234
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,840
And my job is to shatter
her father Rozario's pride.

235
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,590
Will I get married?

236
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,670
You will, son.

237
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,090
- Then give me this picture.
- But why?

238
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,840
- I want to show it to them.
- Them who?

239
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,420
Pandit sir, even I have a family.

240
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,590
Uncle, Raghu, Vishu...

241
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,130
Your sister-in-law's coming.

242
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,840
Which train is she coming from?

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,670
"Everyone's looking in her direction."

244
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,500
"Everyone's looking... ."

245
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,960
"Everyone's looking in her direction."

246
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,050
"I am looking in the direction
of their sight."

247
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,420
"I knew my chances were bright."

248
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,960
" If my chances aren't bright
then something isn't right."

249
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:13,380
"Make way,
your sister-in-law's coming."

250
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,800
"Make way,
my eyes are locked with her."

251
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,340
"Make way,
your sister-in-law's coming."

252
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,300
"Make way,
my eyes are locked with her."

253
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,340
"Feeling."

254
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,130
"I'll take you in my arms..."

255
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,500
"...and play with your tresses night and day."

256
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,880
"I'll pamper you when you're angry."

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,340
"And even tolerate your father's tantrums."

258
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,960
"...tolerate your father's tantrums."

259
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,380
"Whenever you look at me and smile..."

260
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,000
"...I feel like I've
been struck by lightning."

261
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,960
"Make way..."

262
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,250
"Sister-in-law..."

263
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,880
"Make way,
your brother's coming."

264
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,630
"Make way,
my eyes are locked with him."

265
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,840
"Everyone's looking in her direction."

266
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,000
"I am looking in the direction
of their sight."

267
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,340
"I knew things are looking up."

268
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,590
"I knew my chances were bright."

269
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,550
" If my chances aren't bright
then something isn't right."

270
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,340
"...my eyes are locked with her."

271
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,840
"Your sister-in-law's standing there."

272
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,050
"Your brother's standing there."

273
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,340
"Your sister-in-law..."

274
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,500
"Your brother..."

275
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,700
Got to do something
for the sake of your love.

276
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,780
You guys want a car, don't you?

277
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,110
Yes...and only you
can get us one, Deepak.

278
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,240
Come on.

279
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,610
How about this one?

280
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,360
This one.

281
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,110
How about it.

282
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,150
People won't give us
a second look in this car.

283
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,700
Forget about his daughter.

284
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,990
Then you're looking for an expensive car.

285
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,450
Come on.

286
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,320
This way.

287
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,700
How about this one?

288
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,110
Deepak, this looks expensive.

289
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,110
You don't have to buy it.

290
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Belongs to billionaire Mahendra
Pratap Singh of Singapore.

291
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,700
The engine needed some fixing.

292
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,200
I've fixed the car.

293
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,030
No one's going to ask if I
keep the car for a couple of weeks.

294
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,570
Will this do, Pandit sir?

295
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,570
This will do. It will glide.

296
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,530
Deepak.

297
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,820
Raju, pay attention and remember.

298
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,400
You'll be surrounded
by the rich and famous.

299
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,530
Like on your right will be Dhoni.

300
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,110
Dhoni's coming.

301
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,610
Dhoni's not coming personally...

302
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
...but we'll photoshop him next to you.

303
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,650
Understood.

304
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,070
Now shake hands with him confidently.

305
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,860
Higher,

306
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,150
On your left is Donald Trump.

307
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,200
How to do. How to do.

308
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,200
How you doing?

309
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,530
Don't stare at his wig.

310
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,820
Pay your respects.

311
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,280
Mr. Amitabh Bachchan's in front.

312
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,570
Big B...

313
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,610
No shaking hands.

314
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,150
I need his blessings.

315
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
I am going to get Mrs. Raju.

316
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,110
Give me your blessings,
sir, your blessings.

317
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,200
What a get-up, Pandit.

318
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,280
I could hardly tell it's you.

319
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,570
I'm the master of disguise,
I'm dressed to kill tonight.

320
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,400
If you couldn't recognise me...

321
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,990
...Jeffery will never know who I am.

322
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,570
Deepak, will you look after me?

323
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,030
Of course, I will.

324
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,360
Hello, No. 1. He's now Deepak
your driver, not your friend.

325
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,950
And I am your secretary, Mr. Jackson.

326
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,650
And you are Mahendra Pratap Singh's son...
Kunwar Rajpratap Singh.

327
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,700
Prince and all.

328
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,900
- Great.
- Have you ever lied?

329
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,700
Not often.

330
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,400
You love her, don't you?

331
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,530
True love, Pandit.

332
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,820
You'll have to say
small lies for her, son.

333
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,320
Does God approve of it?

334
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,820
God's pretty adjusting, you know.
It's okay.

335
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,240
Jeffery Rozario.

336
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,240
Mission Son-In-Law begins.

337
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,780
Oh God...

338
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,030
What is this place, Pandit?

339
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,320
It's your future father-in-law
Jeffery Rozario's hotel.

340
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,280
This is where we'll find
his brother-in-law Pinto.

341
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,200
He'll be our first target.

342
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,360
Kunwar, show some attitude.

343
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,320
Yeah...

344
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,530
What's this? Welding glasses.

345
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,990
They are the latest trend.

346
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,900
Even Karan Johar and
Ranveer Singh wear them.

347
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,240
- Don't they?
- Of course.

348
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,400
Okay. Let's go.

349
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,780
Its 3:42..

350
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,200
Look, your checkout time.
I can't help you.

351
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,110
It's the question of
our hotel's reputation.

352
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,990
Come on.

353
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,030
Secretary, from what angle
does this look like a seven-star hotel.

354
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,740
This looks like a ragpicker's shack.

355
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,450
Shack.

356
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,570
Shack?

357
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,650
Sir, even Virat Kohli stays here.

358
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,860
So says Google.

359
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,200
Back. Back. Stay back,

360
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,780
Even my dog won't stay here.

361
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,700
Kuku, Will you stay here?

362
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,360
Sorry. He said no.

363
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,780
You guys seem rich.

364
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,900
Stay in your limits.

365
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,700
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Who?

366
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,280
King of Singapore Mahendra
Pratap's son Kunwar Rajpratap Singh.

367
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,320
What's he doing in Goa?

368
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,780
He's here to build
the largest port in Asia.

369
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,740
That's yours?

370
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,280
He'll be perfect fit for my niece Sarah.

371
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,450
Brother-in-law was looking
for a son-in-law like him.

372
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,150
When you knew there are
no good hotels out here...

373
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,570
...then you should've
built one before I arrived.

374
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,070
I would've donated
it to some poor guy later.

375
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,700
Yeah...

376
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,610
You know,
pluck some money from my tree...

377
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,900
...and build a hotel for me.

378
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,150
-Driver, let's go.
-Excuse me.

379
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,320
Does your money grow on trees?

380
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
Yes.

381
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,610
And all my banks have branches,
small boy.

382
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,650
- Sir...
- Don't touch. Don't touch.

383
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,780
Sorry. Sorry.

384
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,400
Please don't leave us.

385
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,280
Our suite room is fantastic.

386
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,240
And our owner/supervisor
will prep your room.

387
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,860
Sarah.

388
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,570
Sarah!

389
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,490
"One-two-three, four..."

390
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,990
"Sarah's gonna decorate the room for you."

391
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,990
"Let's go..."

392
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,650
Deepak, this dog pissed on me.

393
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,360
Why are you giving it to me?

394
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,780
He got pissed because of his lisp.

395
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,820
Change your clothes.

396
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,400
Yes...

397
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,570
I'll have to get changed as well.

398
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,030
Where is that Anju?

399
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,450
The Prince will be here any minute.

400
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,610
Oh my...Mrs. Raju, so close.

401
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,490
There you are.

402
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,900
What are you waiting for?

403
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,320
Hurry up

404
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,740
Don't stare at my face.

405
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,030
Go in the bathroom
and turn on the shower.

406
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,860
I am coming.

407
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,280
I...

408
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
Should we...

409
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,950
Shouldn't we get to
know each other first?

410
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,900
Hi. Hello.

411
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,200
That's all.

412
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,360
Come on, let's get this over with first.

413
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,900
Uncle took forever to send the plumber.

414
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,570
Plumber?

415
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,700
Yes, plumber.

416
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,740
You.

417
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,570
But...

418
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,070
Who else?

419
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,450
Hurry up, please. The shower's leaking.

420
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,360
Guests are coming.

421
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,450
For gods sakes, please.

422
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,450
- But I am..
- Please go.

423
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,070
- Will you...
- I said go.

424
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,570
I am going.

425
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,030
I'll fix it.

426
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,820
I thought I got lucky.

427
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,530
But she thinks I am a plumber.

428
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,110
Curses...

429
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,240
Hey...

430
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,740
"It's raining..."

431
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,990
"It's raining..."

432
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Jesus!

433
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,990
Sarah...

434
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,740
Uncle.

435
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,150
Giving the Prince a personal bath.

436
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,110
Keep it up. Keep it up.

437
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,200
Are you the Prince?

438
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,490
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,280
I am so sorry.
I thought you're the plumber.

440
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,200
There's been a misunderstanding.

441
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,320
Being a miss you tried to
understand but misunderstood...

442
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,150
...that the misunderstanding
is not a miss standing under.

443
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,650
But understanding a miss, understanding?

444
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,820
hey...

445
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,320
Hey...hey...

446
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,990
Didn't make sense, but funny!

447
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,240
Funny.

448
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,740
Funny.

449
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,860
I am funny.

450
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,030
I am funny.

451
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,700
Where's the plumber?

452
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,570
- There you are.
- Yeah...

453
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,450
Thanks to your showing up late...

454
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,200
...my sister mistook
the prince as the plumber.

455
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,110
What's so funny?
Go and fix the shower.

456
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,990
You're just like your sister,
aren't you?

457
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,700
What?

458
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,150
I mean I am not the plumber.

459
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,700
I am a guest.

460
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,740
Of the prince.

461
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,070
Oh my, God.
I am so sorry. I didn't know.

462
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,030
- It's okay.
- Happens.

463
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,320
Happens all the time.

464
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,740
Thank you. You've very kind.

465
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,650
- You're so cute.
- Thank you.

466
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,240
Oh, hello, sir.

467
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,070
I wonder what's wrong with me today?

468
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,030
I'm mistaking the guests for the plumber.

469
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,110
Please tell me which room
and I'll walk you there.

470
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,740
Room.

471
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,320
I am The Plumber, madam.

472
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,400
See

473
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,360
Show me the leakage.

474
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,030
Room no. 21. Go and fix the shower.

475
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,820
Okay, madam. You two, please continue.

476
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,650
Plumber.

477
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,400
What's this, dear?

478
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,240
Dad, only diet food from now.

479
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,860
Diet food. Look who's talking.

480
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,950
Dad

481
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,150
Yo...

482
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,650
"I'm the one like Varun Dhawan."

483
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,950
"I take off like Tiger Shroff."

484
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,070
"I am the king like Ranveer Singh."

485
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,820
"My time will come..."

486
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,360
- Who the hell are you? Out! Get out!
- My time's come.

487
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,740
- Brother-in-law, it's me.
- ??

488
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,110
Dad, he means fooled.
It's Pinto uncle.

489
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,110
Looking good.
- ??

490
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,320
Oh my man, Pinto.

491
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,200
What's all this?

492
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,860
Check out Armani,

493
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,990
Armani, JacknJones, Gucci.

494
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,070
Gucci. Seriously?

495
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,820
- Where did you get it?
- The Prince gave me these.

496
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,780
Prince?

497
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,030
Brother-in-law,
let's make him our son-in-law.

498
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,740
He might just give us a country.

499
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,400
Madman.
A country...

500
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,360
What's a rich man like
him doing in our country?

501
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,740
He's building a port.

502
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,530
He's making toast.

503
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,150
No, big port over the water.

504
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,450
He's making a port.

505
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,280
He's visiting the site now.

506
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,360
What are you thinking, brother-in-law?

507
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,240
I am thinking,
Pinto seems like a genuine party.

508
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,780
I'll have to crosscheck.

509
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,780
??

510
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,070
??

511
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,030
...69 meters.

512
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Hello. Hello.

513
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
What are you guys up to?

514
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,070
Shooting, eh.
You guys are shooting a film.

515
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,320
I know it.
You guys are making Bahubali 3.

516
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,610
We're not shooting here.
We're constructing a port.

517
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,240
- I very good actor. Give me any role.
- Hey-hey...

518
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,450
Nonsense person disturbing factor.
Come on, get out. Out, out. out.

519
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,490
These roadside Romeo
types no better work to do.

520
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,530
You have any problem,
anybody disturbs you.

521
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,570
You tell them...talk to Master.

522
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,200
We'll take care of everything.

523
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,820
- Over there.
- Okay, good.

524
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,570
Heaven on the docks, man.

525
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,740
Whiskey on the rocks, man.

526
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,030
Are they building a port or Portugal?

527
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,110
Hello, my friend, what are you doing?

528
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,450
And what is this going on?

529
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,400
Any questions please speak to master.

530
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,490
He's over there.

531
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,320
Master.

532
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,280
??

533
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,860
He's my master too.

534
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,990
Secretary,
park our half a dozen ships here.

535
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,280
But sir, we won't get permission.

536
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,570
Don't worry,
I spoke to the PM at one PM.

537
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,570
The PM?

538
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,320
Before I forget my
helicopter will land here.

539
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,900
- So build the helipad here.
- Right, sir.

540
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,530
Sometimes I'll get off
my ship and ride my helicopter

541
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,490
And sometimes I'll get off
my helicopter and ride my ship.

542
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,360
- I'll decide.
- Of course.

543
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,860
See that tree.

544
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,570
- That one?
- That's a sapling.

545
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,150
The tree behind it is where
we'll build our railway station.

546
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,150
- Sir, why railway station?
- Where will we unload our cargo?

547
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,200
Where will we unload our cargo?

548
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Genius, sir.

549
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,780
What is this?

550
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,780
The railway station isn't ready yet and people
are already signing up for coolie's job.

551
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,490
- Sir...
- Give this poor man a job.

552
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,280
Sir, people like them are like wolves.

553
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,990
Waiting to pounce on rich
people when they see one.

554
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,150
Secretary, ATM on the phone.

555
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,780
- ATM, sir.
- Ambani-Trump-Modi.

556
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,110
On a conference call.

557
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,570
It's too hot out here.

558
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,860
I'll go sit in my ACBCDC car.

559
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,490
Yes, sir, of course.
- ??

560
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,900
Go on, Donald. Please...
- ??

561
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,700
What?

562
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,780
I'd heard about AC cars.

563
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,490
But what's a BCDC car?

564
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,700
Bada-Chauda-Dhasu-Car.
(Big-fat-expensive-car)

565
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,530
Now please, get lost.

566
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,320
Back to square one.

567
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,240
You've no class to hold this glass.

568
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,820
Please, get lost.

569
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,240
Ambani-Trump-Modi.

570
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,240
This guy's a billionaire.

571
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,200
Lord, I want him to be my daughter's husband.

572
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,200
I'll beg him to marry my daughter.

573
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,240
WoW!

574
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,070
Rozario's impressed.

575
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,320
Now Sarah's turn.

576
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,360
But Pandit, will she be
impressed by this ball and stick?

577
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,200
It's called Golf.

578
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,740
What?

579
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,610
- Golf
- Golf.

580
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,240
Rich man's game.

581
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,360
Raju.

582
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,240
Look.

583
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,860
Hey...

584
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,780
Raju. Stop it.

585
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,570
Play...

586
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,200
Stop overacting and play.

587
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,200
Golf.

588
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,700
Prince...playing golf.

589
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,280
Rich man's game.

590
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,110
I will

591
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,820
Play nicely, Raju. Everyone's watching.

592
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,320
Not like cricket.
Not like cricket.

593
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,150
Raju, you got to aim first.
Aim for the hole.

594
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,450
Play, play... this is so much fun.

595
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,780
Hit it hard. Hit it hard.

596
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,490
"My balls"

597
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,990
His balls bearings are gone.

598
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,070
"My balls"

599
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
His eggs are smashed.

600
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,150
??

601
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,280
I'll get you patched up.

602
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,820
Where is the bellboy?

603
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,030
Bellboy!

604
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,990
Where is the bellboy?

605
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,610
I'll take your luggage, sir.

606
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,280
- Come on.
- Thank you. Thank you.

607
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,070
Thank you.

608
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,360
Make place, take place, here comes Raju.

609
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,240
Where to?

610
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,990
This way?
That's our room.

611
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,740
Don't carry too much
luggage in this age, uncle.

612
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Come on.

613
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you, son. Thank you.

614
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,570
Keep your thank you. That's 200 rupees.

615
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,610
What?
What are you saying?

616
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,200
Stop wasting my time and pay up.

617
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,950
Quickly. Quickly.

618
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,820
200...

619
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,150
Joking. Joking.

620
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you, son.

621
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,450
Prince, now I know your true character.

622
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,900
No, I was just helping...

623
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,860
You really are a gem of a person.

624
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,610
You're so rich and yet the
other day you became a plumber,

625
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,610
today you became a porter...

626
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,360
...and carried their luggage so naturally.

627
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,900
I actually thought you're a coolie.

628
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,490
I really like your attitude.

629
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,700
I like your hotel.

630
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,150
And?

631
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,450
I like your father.

632
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,610
And?

633
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,490
I like your sister.

634
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,450
And?

635
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,200
I'll tell you later.

636
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,780
Hotel?

637
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,780
I love Goa!

638
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,990
Sarah.

639
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,740
Sarah.

640
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,650
Don't say anything.

641
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,490
Otherwise,
I won't be able to say what I want.

642
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,740
You see...

643
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,950
First time when we met...

644
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,030
...I couldn't handle
the bathroom shower.

645
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,360
The second time when we met...

646
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,450
...I couldn't handle the golf stick.

647
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,860
And the third time when
your hand's in my hand...

648
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,900
This hand...

649
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,150
This hand...

650
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,530
I can't handle this hand, Sarah.

651
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,400
What are you doing?

652
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,650
No...

653
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,530
I am here for some serious talk.

654
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,900
You'll not be able to
handle what I say next.

655
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,700
Sarah?

656
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,070
Hi, Prince. What's the matter?

657
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,200
Midnight entry straight to the room.

658
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,110
I came to ask her something.

659
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,990
Yes, of course.
Sure.

660
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,610
Ask away.

661
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,900
Sarah, whatever the
question just say yes.

662
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,900
Okay.
Bye.

663
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,200
Bye.

664
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,650
All the best.

665
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,030
The other day we both said 'I like you'.

666
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,320
I came to ask you something.

667
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,570
Ask.

668
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,200
Imagine...

669
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,820
I don't have a bungalow,
car, airplane...or port.

670
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,200
In fact, I don't even
have a roof on my head.

671
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,400
Nothing.

672
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,400
Would you still like me?

673
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,990
Sarah.

674
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,030
- Dad?
- Heaven on the docks, man.

675
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,150
- At this house door has locks, man..
- Dad.

676
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,400
??
- Hide.

677
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,610
Why man?

678
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,820
Sarah.

679
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,240
Yes, dad. What's wrong?

680
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,530
I am not the pizza delivery guy.
I am your father.

681
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,950
Let me in.

682
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,780
See, I brought your yoga book back.

683
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,490
- Thank you, dad. Goodnight.
- You know something.

684
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,200
I learned three asanas.

685
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,280
- Very nice, papa.
- I'll show you.

686
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,740
- You don't have to show me.
- I'll show you.

687
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,360
Vakrasan.

688
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,360
Ta-dah.

689
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,700
Trikonasana.

690
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,650
Ta-dah.

691
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,320
And Gauasan.

692
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,240
Ta-dah.

693
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,700
Very nice, papa. I understand.
Okay, papa.

694
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,610
- Very good. Very amazing. Thank you.
- And this is called...

695
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,610
Vitthalasan.

696
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,610
Who said that?

697
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,200
I did.

698
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,110
You?

699
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,610
What's wrong with your voice?

700
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,360
Last night I was watching a film.

701
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:42,900
Right?

702
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,150
Mr. Bachchan's.

703
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
I see...

704
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,400
He had a strong voice.

705
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,780
So even my voice got depth.

706
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,700
Ohh...

707
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,530
Can I do it again?

708
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,030
Please. Please.
- Okay

709
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,570
Goodnight.

710
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,740
Goodnight!

711
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,610
Such depth. With surround sound.

712
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,240
Amazing.

713
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,280
- Very good.
- Yes.

714
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,530
Amazing.

715
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,780
- Now listen, dear.
- Yes...

716
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,490
What is this?

717
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,700
Gutnasan.

718
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,150
- Gutnasan?
- Yes.

719
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,280
What's this for?

720
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,950
Let's breathe freely.

721
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,450
Thank you, papa.

722
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,360
Saved.

723
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,610
Raj!

724
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,780
Will you leave before hearing my reply?

725
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,070
"Back to the 90s."

726
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,240
Wow!

727
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,530
"I was walking down the road."

728
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,400
"Eating my snack."

729
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,990
"I was strolling with my girl."

730
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,900
"I was walking down the road."

731
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,650
"Eating my snack."

732
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,200
"I was strolling with my girl."

733
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,200
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

734
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,990
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

735
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,240
"I was walking down the road."

736
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,610
"Eating my ice-cream."

737
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,320
"Locking eyes."

738
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,280
"I was walking down the road."

739
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,150
"Eating my ice-cream."

740
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,530
"Locking eyes."

741
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,740
"If you're Jealous, what do i do."

742
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,150
"If you're Jealous, what do i do."

743
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,950
"Hello."

744
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,070
"The number you're trying
to call is currently in love."

745
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,200
"Take me to see a new movie..."

746
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,740
"...take me out to dinner."

747
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,610
"Let me sip from your eyes..."

748
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,650
"...and douse my thirst."

749
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,280
"I want to love you all night."

750
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,530
"I want to see myself in your eyes."

751
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,450
"I was swaying to the beat."

752
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,110
"I was singing a song."

753
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,700
"I was trying to impress him."

754
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,490
"I was swaying to the beat."

755
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,360
"I was singing a song."

756
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,820
"I was trying to impress him."

757
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,030
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

758
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,700
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

759
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,240
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

760
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,200
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

761
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,780
"Hey Coolie..."

762
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,900
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

763
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,530
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

764
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,570
"If you're Jealous, what do I do."

765
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,570
- Pinto
- Yes, brother-in-law.

766
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,570
By God, if my daughter
marries Kunwar

767
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,480
...I'll give you this hotel
with the fountain.

768
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,820
You say that all the time
but never keep your promise.

769
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,480
No. 1, Rozario's coming.

770
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,320
- Remember your dialogues?
- Of course.

771
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,690
Okay, action.

772
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,070
Why not?

773
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,480
Because sir,
look at you, up in the sky so high...

774
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,770
...and that guy's a speck
of dust on the ground.

775
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,230
Huge difference sir.

776
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,820
I guess they are talking
about some beggar.

777
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,940
That cheapskate Jeffery Rozario.

778
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,940
Pinto, who is Jeffery Rozario?

779
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,020
You are, brother-in-law.
They are talking about you.

780
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,650
Sir, you and his daughter...

781
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,320
I love his daughter. I like her.

782
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,360
- But, sir...
- Enough.

783
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,770
I don't want any stupid reasons.

784
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,690
Sir, your reputation's at stake here.

785
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,400
Marrying that ordinary man's
daughter is against your pride.

786
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Secretary...

787
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,070
We live only once...

788
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,190
Die once...

789
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,820
And...we also fall in love once.

790
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:01,570
The love devil's after you,
and you after the devil.

791
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,270
In Big boss home, too much fun.

792
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,570
- Weekend fun.
- The earth's my mother, sir.

793
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,230
And I won't let anyone
else take her from me.

794
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,070
Nice. Nice. But water under the bridge.

795
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,020
We'll have to convince him.

796
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,520
Tell his father, keep standing
until you're not told to sit down.

797
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,980
Because this is the love station,
not your home.

798
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,980
Wow!

799
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,690
Prince, very risky.

800
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,190
What...
What risky.

801
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,940
When my daughter's willing and ready.

802
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,980
Now it's just time for rum and whiskey.

803
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,020
Their love's downloading, sir.

804
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,400
Don't delete their file of love, please.

805
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,770
- Who let you in?
- I am sorry.

806
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,520
This is my hotel.

807
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:47,480
Kunwar, I am the owner of this hotel.

808
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,820
- Pleasure. Pleasure.
- No touching. No touching.

809
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:55,110
You know what, I'll stand
strong and see this wedding happens.

810
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,690
- Who will get them married?
- Yes.

811
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,110
Who do you think you are?

812
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,610
That reminds me.

813
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,690
I've to call Kunwar's father.

814
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,940
Please.

815
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,360
Listen. Listen.

816
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,190
We'll get Kunwar and
Sarah married in a couple of days.

817
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,900
Okay?

818
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,230
And after that?

819
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,270
After that...

820
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,070
We'll fall at his feet. We'll apologise.

821
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,770
And say that kids made a mistake.

822
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,820
End of story.

823
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,480
And his father will end me.

824
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:18,650
I don't agree.

825
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,070
No, no, keep it.
And there's more. There's more

826
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,110
Okay, happy.

827
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,360
Happy?

828
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,860
Singing Goan Song

829
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,730
Prince, wedding's fixed.
Groom's hitched. Bride's blessed.

830
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,570
There end's my Queens Quest

831
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,320
Pinto, leave that here.

832
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,400
The wedding's fixed.

833
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,320
Prince...

834
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,730
We'll definitely get a country now.

835
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,440
Mr. Jackson.

836
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,690
Mr. Jackson. Welcome. Welcome.

837
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,400
Welcome. Welcome.

838
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,440
Wow. So this is your entrance?

839
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,480
Entrance? This is my entire house.

840
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,570
- The whole house.
- House? So small.

841
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,820
Who is he?

842
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,320
He's Kunwar's secretary.

843
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,730
- Mr. Jackson.
- Take his blessings.

844
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,980
- Take his blessings.
- Is she your wife?

845
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,270
No.
My mom.

846
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,610
Ahh, Mom... hello.
- Hello.

847
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,230
- Did you ask about the groom?
- Mom.

848
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
- You want to inquire about the Prince?

849
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,360
No.
She means the Prince's likes,

850
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,020
dislikes, his favourite food,
tea, coffee...etcetera.

851
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,020
You'll be his favourite pastime now.

852
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,940
Watch. I will show you.
Come on.

853
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,650
Mom, please. Always in the way.

854
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,110
Present Kunwar and Kunwar Multinational.

855
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,020
Ohh...

856
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,860
- Amitabh Bachchan.
- That's the Prince, mom.

857
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,610
- No, the one next to him.
- With Amitabh Bachchan.

858
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,150
Playing KBC with AB.

859
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,150
This one...he pumped 1 billion
in Trump's election.

860
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,900
Now, this...

861
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,480
Nick-Priyanka.

862
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,360
He gifted an island on their wedding.

863
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,730
- Island.
- Ireland.

864
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,820
Imagine, Ireland.

865
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,690
Dad, the Prince is quite handsome, huh.

866
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,820
Sorry, dear, this one's already taken.

867
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,900
- Lay your eyes off him.
- Dad...

868
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,150
He gives classes on
handsomeness to Brad Pitt.

869
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,610
Prince is very nice.

870
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,900
Pita bread.

871
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,900
Tell me if Vijaya Mallya calls.

872
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,690
Yes.

873
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,730
Kunwar sir.

874
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,270
That was quick.

875
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,270
- Wedding presents for everyone.
- Anu, go take it.

876
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,610
Look, mom, apples from Kashmir.

877
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,690
Mom, he's Kunwar sir.
My future son-in-law.

878
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,940
And that's my mom.

879
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,020
Hello.

880
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,940
- Mom...
- What?

881
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,190
I don't have a mom.

882
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,150
Ohh...

883
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,900
Can I touch her feet?

884
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,900
Please do. Please do.
She's got two in fact.

885
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,440
Bless you, son. It's okay.

886
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,860
Son, why didn't you
bring your father too?

887
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,270
Don't spoil the mood.

888
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,940
Don't mention his father.

889
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,440
Do you want to cancel the wedding?

890
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,980
Our daughter's life here is at stake.

891
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,980
- At least go and see his house.
- House...

892
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,770
What's mom saying?

893
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,690
Well...

894
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,110
Mom has a hobby of
seeing people's bungalows.

895
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,940
So she was asking about your bungalow?

896
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,020
What bungalow?

897
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,190
What bungalow?

898
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:27,650
He means the one below London
Tower or the one on top of Burj Khalifa.

899
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,610
See, mom.
You're ranting about bungalows.

900
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,860
He's got so many bungalows.

901
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,440
Mumbai bungalow is good enough.

902
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,860
This fool doesn't know, I have no money for rent

903
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,320
I agree but we have to find a way to fool this fool

904
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,360
What about the Shooting bungalow

905
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,570
In Juhu

906
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,570
- Scr** Juhu! Scr** Juhu!
- Scr** who?

907
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,070
Juhu!

908
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,520
I mean come see our bungalow in Juhu.

909
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,730
Juhu Scheme.

910
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,570
Happy?
Mom's, happy.

911
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,400
Pandit, an ordinary coolie who sleeps
on platforms can't get a bungalow.

912
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,860
Don't worry, Raju.

913
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,650
There's a bungalow in
Juhu that's available on rent for film shoots

914
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,110
We'll show that to Rozario.

915
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,900
See. We're here.

916
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,690
Let's drive inside with the car.
It'll give a good impression.

917
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,730
On the contrary, we'll get beaten up.

918
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,110
Why?

919
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,520
The car belongs to
the owner of this bungalow.

920
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,230
You guys go on. I'll wait out here.

921
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,150
Pandit sir,
I'll take my shoes off outside.

922
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,440
Feel at home, no. 1.

923
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,360
Come on.

924
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,230
Hello, good afternoon.

925
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,980
We want to meet the
owner of this bungalow.

926
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,070
That's me.

927
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,270
Hello, sir.

928
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:47,480
We want to shoot in this bungalow.
And want to discuss.

929
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,070
I'm leaving for Singapore.
I've a flight to catch.

930
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,610
He's my manager. You can talk to him.

931
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,150
Be quick.
I've to go to the airport with sir.

932
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,190
You see, we're making
a serial of 420 episodes only.

933
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,730
It's called Father-in-law cheats the law.

934
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,520
The bungalow is the main character.

935
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,820
What a character.

936
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,320
We wanted to show the
director this bungalow.

937
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,230
He can come whenever he wants.

938
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,440
He's coming today.

939
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:12,730
At 5 o'clock.

940
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,690
It's as big as the Bay of Bengal.

941
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,480
My son-in-law's loaded.

942
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,520
Two stair-cases.

943
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,360
One goes up the other comes down.

944
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,900
I'll first climb up
And then climb down.

945
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,270
Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Jackson.

946
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,900
How do you like our bungalow?

947
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,940
Jesus Christ, my daughter's
going to live here like a queen.

948
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,730
She will be the queen of her king.

949
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,230
Mind-blowing,
the bungalow and the owner.

950
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,770
Mr. Jackson, you're a god.
Can I touch your feet?

951
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,320
- Of course.
- Go ahead. In fact, he's got two.

952
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,610
This one too.

953
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,400
You...My son-in-law.

954
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,110
Singing Goan Song

955
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,570
Singing Goan Song

956
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,020
Singing Goan Song

957
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,940
Prince Raj Pratap Singh, do you take
Sarah Rozario as your lawfully wedded wife.

958
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,690
Yeah-yeah.

959
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,820
Say I do.

960
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,150
I do.

961
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:17,400
Sarah Rozario, do you take Prince Raj Pratap
Singh as your lawfully wedded husband.

962
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,440
Yes, I do.

963
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:21,860
She said I do.

964
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,860
You may now kiss the bride.

965
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,860
Yes. She's done it before.

966
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,610
Raj.

967
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,770
Come on.

968
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,820
- On the lips. On the lips.
- What are you doing?

969
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,820
- I am doing it. I am doing it.
- What are you doing?

970
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,270
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

971
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,440
- Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.
- Come on.

972
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,690
"You're so special to me."

973
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:38,150
Lord, I can't believe
that we got married.

974
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,690
Me too.

975
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,150
We're no match.

976
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,820
And I know that you're adjusting
in this small place only for me.

977
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,230
Yeah-yeah...come on.

978
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,770
Wait a minute.

979
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,360
Dad was praising your Juhu bungalow.

980
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,980
Bungalow.

981
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:00,900
Yeah.

982
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,400
We'll go to Mumbai tomorrow
and stay in the bungalow.

983
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:04,940
Okay.

984
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,570
Weather in Mumbai is pretty bad.

985
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,440
The weather in Goa is very nice.

986
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,020
I want to settle down here.

987
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,480
Come here.

988
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,440
What rubbish.

989
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,150
What are the people going to say?

990
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:21,150
A billionaire husband
is living with his in-laws.

991
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:22,940
Does it sound nice?

992
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:25,270
Why are you stuck on the
bungalow like a broken record?

993
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,940
We'll definitely go...

994
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,520
In a week, month, year...decade.

995
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,190
- Come here.
- No!

996
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,230
First, promise me.

997
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,230
We'll go to Mumbai tomorrow
and stay in the bungalow.

998
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,820
Fine, we'll go...live in the bungalow.

999
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,820
What a nice bungalow.

1000
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,520
Husband...

1001
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,320
I meant Husband.

1002
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:56,820
I even heard there's a gym,
spa, jacuzzi in your bungalow.

1003
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,190
- You talk too much at night.
- Really?

1004
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,980
Heaven is where the bungalow is.

1005
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,650
We even have two dozen trains.

1006
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,770
- Oh god, Sarah.
- Anju.

1007
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,360
I am going to miss you.

1008
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,150
I know. You should've
gotten married first.

1009
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,610
But I did.

1010
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:15,610
Wait a minute.

1011
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,980
I can't stand the tears of a sister.
I will stay right here.

1012
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,860
- Come, Deepak.
- No, brother-in-law.

1013
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,480
This was just the vidai-pose
for Instagram post.

1014
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,860
You know sad types.

1015
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,570
Otherwise, my sister got
married why wouldn't I be happy.

1016
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,520
- My child...
- Granny.

1017
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,480
I am going, granny.

1018
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,860
Look, dear. Don't forget your
old granny in your big bungalow.

1019
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,070
Mother ***

1020
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,860
- What?
- I mean tear in mom's eyes.

1021
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,650
I can't play with mummy's emoji.

1022
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,020
- Emotion.
- Exactly.

1023
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,520
- Deepak, keep my luggage back.
- Yes.

1024
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,820
I'll stay right here.

1025
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,020
I don't want my dad's mansion,
I want mom's compassion.

1026
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,230
- No, there's no need for that.
- There is.

1027
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,610
No, there isn't, son.

1028
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:58,730
When the daughter leaves,
mothers always cry.

1029
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,770
- It's a tradition, son.
- What a tradition.

1030
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,570
- Go on, children. Be happy.
- How can we?

1031
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,440
My blessings are there.

1032
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,270
Daddy.

1033
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,020
Child. Child.

1034
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,270
- Daddy.
- Leaving your father.

1035
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,230
Child.

1036
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,400
I can't see your sorrow.

1037
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,820
I'm gonna stay right here.
And never leave.

1038
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,690
- Sarah, let's go.
- Listen, son, listen.

1039
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,230
Father of the bride has to cry.

1040
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,520
- It's a rule.
- Papa.

1041
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,520
The ceremony is incomplete
without father's tears.

1042
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:33,270
And this isn't real.

1043
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:34,480
See...

1044
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:35,900
It's glycerin.
- Papa.

1045
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,400
The wedding planners carry it with them.

1046
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:44,020
But...if her uncle cries next,
I won't listen to anyone.

1047
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,070
I will stay right here.

1048
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,480
Why is he laughing?

1049
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:54,900
He will go with you.
Stay with you for a month.

1050
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,360
That's our tradition.

1051
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,440
What kind of tradition is this?

1052
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,980
- Pinto.
- Yes, brother-in-law.

1053
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,320
You're going to a mansion now.

1054
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,520
Take good care.

1055
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,020
And there will be a couple of dozen servants.

1056
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,900
Don't be rude to anyone.

1057
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,230
I'll be rude with each and every one.

1058
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,980
Pinto...

1059
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,520
Secretary.

1060
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,440
Let's go, sir.

1061
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,570
Bye, love you.

1062
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:23,690
Mom...you did only one good thing in life.

1063
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,230
Giving birth to a wiseman
like Jeffery Rozario.

1064
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,440
See...I got her married
in a billionaire family.

1065
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,860
Heaven on the docks.

1066
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,860
I am the wolf and I am the fox.

1067
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,530
We're home.
Sarah's home.

1068
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,400
What a huge bungalow.

1069
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,440
Is this yours?

1070
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:54,730
Is this yours?

1071
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,230
What a place.

1072
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,610
Come on, Raj, let's take a selfie.

1073
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,070
Smile, Raj.

1074
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,820
- Smile?
- How can I smile?

1075
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,820
I got married without
our daddy's permission.

1076
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,650
I'll have to go inside and
make him smile, get him in the mood.

1077
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,030
Try to understand.

1078
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,860
Now listen, you guys wait out here.

1079
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,070
I don't want anything
to go wrong on the first day.

1080
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:20,730
Okay.

1081
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,980
Jackson.

1082
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,980
I am going in to handle the situation, Follow me

1083
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,280
Ok, but what if our cover is blown

1084
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,820
Then we're screwed

1085
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,110
We are Screwed

1086
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,900
We are Screwed

1087
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:32,940
Let's go.

1088
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,070
Pandit, blow up this
place along with me.

1089
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,070
I am getting stressed.

1090
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,570
Relax, man.

1091
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,820
God knows your love is true.

1092
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,110
He'll show us a way.

1093
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,400
Whatever happened with you
is none of my business!

1094
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,320
A useless son like
you is already dead for me.

1095
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:01,030
I figured that out when
you let me rot in jail, dad.

1096
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,780
You didn't even bail me out.

1097
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,480
I've nothing to do with
someone who deals in drugs.

1098
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,110
You've nothing to do with me,
with my business, and my property.

1099
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,030
You are not the law, dad.

1100
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,360
And according to the law all this...

1101
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,110
This is mine!

1102
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,280
And I'll sue you for it if I have to.

1103
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,400
Pandit, that boy's a rascal.

1104
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,650
I got him arrested.

1105
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,230
- What?
- Now he's suing his father.

1106
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:26,940
Wait a minute.

1107
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,570
Then you should sue your father too.

1108
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,530
But I don't have a father to sue.

1109
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,110
That guy up there.

1110
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:35,110
I can't sue him.

1111
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:40,400
Sweetheart, for Sarah and
his uncle he's your father.

1112
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,230
Sue him!

1113
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,530
Leave me, secretary!

1114
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,440
Calm down. And don't overdo it.
They might hear you inside.

1115
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:51,230
I'll sue every member
of Singapore family.

1116
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,690
What do they think?

1117
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,530
Don't I have a right to this bungalow.

1118
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:59,030
I'll send him a notice. I'll sue him.

1119
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,940
I'll win and then set
foot in this bungalow.

1120
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:04,690
Or my name isn't Prince Raj Pratap.

1121
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,030
I'm leaving now, dad.

1122
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,530
But I'll take this bungalow from you.

1123
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,820
I'll see...how you take
this bungalow from me?

1124
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,400
I will take it from him.

1125
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,360
I'll show him that I am his blood.

1126
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,480
If he thinks he's bad, I am his dad.

1127
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,980
Calm down, Prince, calm down.

1128
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,530
What calm down?

1129
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,440
My father's denying
to accept Sarah as my wife.

1130
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:28,530
He means refusing.

1131
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:33,730
He won't find a cute
daughter like her anywhere.

1132
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,690
I can tolerate anything
but not Sarah's insult.

1133
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,110
I'll do anything.
I'll be a coolie.

1134
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,070
Coolie.

1135
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,980
"The burden of the world on my head..."

1136
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:46,280
- I'll sleep at the railway station.
- No, sir.

1137
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,320
You know why?

1138
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,480
Because when there is
a will there is a lawyer.

1139
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,690
So first I'll win the case
and then set foot in this bungalow.

1140
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,110
Anju...

1141
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,730
When will we get married, man?

1142
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,150
Deepak.

1143
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:02,900
Deepak.

1144
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,690
Sir...

1145
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,650
Where are you bringing the car from?
- Hello, sir.

1146
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,900
No, sir. I am just standing here.

1147
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:12,070
Why is the car so decorated?

1148
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,940
- I...
- Shut up.

1149
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,150
- You take sir's car to weddings.
- No, sir.

1150
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,070
- What are you saying?
- Park the car inside.

1151
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,610
Here's your cap.

1152
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,530
Wear it.

1153
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,070
Let's go inside.

1154
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,070
Sorry, sir.

1155
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,030
Oh Lord, what's going on?

1156
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,650
They even took your car.

1157
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,360
Temper. Angry Dad.
- Uncle.

1158
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,400
Temper. Took his car
with boot and bumper.

1159
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,900
- What to do?
- See uncle.

1160
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,400
Do you still want to live
in this house like shameless people?

1161
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:42,030
Never.

1162
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,230
Raise your hand and hail a taxi.

1163
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,070
Taxi?

1164
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,610
Taxi.

1165
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,690
Five people are not allowed.

1166
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:49,360
Then?

1167
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,320
Uncle.

1168
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,530
Uncle.
Go back to Goa.

1169
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,980
- No, I won't go back to Goa.
- That's not possible.

1170
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,280
Uncle's going to stay with me.
He won't go anywhere.

1171
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,780
This bird of a feather...

1172
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,150
...wants to flock in with his
niece together. Okay.

1173
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:03,400
- Deepak.
- Yes.

1174
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,940
- Take uncle to his destination.
- Okay.

1175
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:05,940
- Come, uncle.
- But where?

1176
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,610
- The other taxi.
- Okay.

1177
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,150
Come, sir. Please.
Let's go, madam.

1178
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:11,860
Don't look.

1179
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,440
Please, mind your head.

1180
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,320
Did she hurt herself.

1181
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:20,940
Koliwada.

1182
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:25,440
- You must be hungry.
- Very hungry. Very hungry.

1183
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:26,690
What do you want?

1184
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,400
Rice cakes, pancakes.

1185
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:30,360
Stuffed pancakes.

1186
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,480
- What did he say?
- Rice cakes, pancakes, flatbread.

1187
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:34,860
Fried bread.

1188
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,190
Get two of everything. I am starving.

1189
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,530
Will that be enough?

1190
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,690
First, we'll eat then tell you.

1191
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,400
And if it's less we'll order more.

1192
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:43,820
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1193
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,110
Water...
- Pancakes.

1194
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,070
Fill it up

1195
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,110
Hurry up, I am hungry.
- Coming.

1196
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:53,320
Are you happy?

1197
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,400
Very happy

1198
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,070
Okay, I'll go get a taxi.
Don't forget to eat the ice-cream.

1199
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,440
Ice-cream before the main course?

1200
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,980
You can eat whatever you want, uncle.

1201
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,150
Sir, bill.

1202
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,730
Where did your partner go?

1203
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,570
He's gone to get a taxi.

1204
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,900
It's been more than half an hour.
Who is going to pay?

1205
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,150
What money?

1206
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,690
Money comes and goes. Food is important.

1207
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,940
Tawde. Shinde.
Show him from where money comes and goes

1208
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,230
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1209
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,780
Consider me as your guest and you served me

1210
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:30,400
Is this how you treat you guests?

1211
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,820
Pandit, how can my Sarah live here?

1212
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,690
I know this place isn't right.
But unfortunately...

1213
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,940
Wait She's coming.

1214
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,820
Raj.

1215
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,480
Yes.

1216
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,650
Are we going to live here?

1217
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,030
Impossible.
What are you doing, Mr. Secretary?

1218
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,780
From our bungalow to this place?

1219
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:10,570
See Sarah, he's so persistent.
He even sued his father.

1220
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,070
I know he'll win.

1221
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,900
But the case might take days,
months, years even.

1222
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,900
But how can Sarah live here?

1223
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,320
Raj, I'll manage.

1224
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,730
What are you saying, Sarah?

1225
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,400
You want a bungalow, don't you?

1226
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,280
Yes.

1227
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,900
Give me 10 minutes.

1228
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:30,190
I'll clean this place
up and turn it into a bungalow.

1229
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,070
Okay.

1230
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,730
See...what a sensible child.

1231
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,860
God bless you, dear.
Bless you.

1232
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,360
Pandit, it's my first day
in the city after our wedding.

1233
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,940
- Lend me some money.
- Money?

1234
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,650
Great.

1235
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,820
You're my first customer who is taking a commission
from the agent who fixed his wedding

1236
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,030
Stop counting, Pandit. You're a Godsend

1237
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,570
Make space.

1238
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,230
We also have our honeymoon to go to.

1239
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,280
"Coolie no. 1."

1240
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,940
"I am Coolie no. 1."

1241
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,440
What are you doing?

1242
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:22,900
You're carrying these bags
like porters (coolie's) do at railway stations.

1243
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:23,610
Coolie?

1244
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,440
Yes.

1245
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,480
Just like this.

1246
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:29,400
I can be a Coolie for you.

1247
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:48,280
My child, how are you? All fine.

1248
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,030
Everything's not fine.

1249
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,150
Uncle must have told you, dad.

1250
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,530
Uncle told me.

1251
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,030
Uncle isn't here, dear?

1252
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,070
What?

1253
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,280
- Uncle didn't reach?
- No.

1254
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,860
Raj said he left two days ago.

1255
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:05,070
Anyway, things are not looking good here.

1256
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,530
What happened?

1257
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,780
What happened, dear?

1258
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,860
- Jeffery...
- The connection's lost.

1259
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,190
Pinto hasn't returned yet.

1260
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,900
And why did Sarah say things are not looking good here?

1261
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,190
Something doesn't feel right.

1262
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,530
But who is going to explain to him?

1263
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,820
Okay fine.

1264
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,860
Talk to him. I know the rest.

1265
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,610
- Mom. Mom.
- I'm with you.

1266
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,070
- Mom. Mom.
- Sudha.

1267
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,980
Sudha, you listen to me.

1268
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,110
Whose child is that?

1269
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,860
You'll love the city.

1270
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,190
Hey...

1271
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,730
Someone save the child.

1272
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,110
Look at that child. He's on the tracks!

1273
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,570
Whose child is that?

1274
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:13,780
Where did Rohan disappear?

1275
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,110
- Rohan!
- The train's coming.

1276
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,480
My son is Hard of Hearing...

1277
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:32,730
Raja...

1278
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,570
Someone save my child!

1279
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,780
Rohan!

1280
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,900
Raju!

1281
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,360
Rohan!

1282
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,360
- Mom!
- My son.

1283
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,400
Thank you, Raju. Thank you very much!

1284
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,690
You've a mother's blessings.

1285
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:48,820
May you be blessed
with whatever you desire.

1286
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,570
Don't cry, sister.

1287
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,820
I am a Coolie.

1288
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,320
My job is to take care
of people's possessions.

1289
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,860
Take care of him.

1290
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,400
Let's go, son.

1291
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,730
I'll never leave you alone again.

1292
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:43,190
What...

1293
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,820
You're a coolie?

1294
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,360
Coolie?

1295
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,320
I am ruined.

1296
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,070
Bloody fraud.

1297
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,190
What did you say?

1298
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,570
Ambani's entire business rests on your shoulders.

1299
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:02,610
In fact, the entire world's bag,
baggage, luggage is on your shoulders.

1300
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,280
Coolie!

1301
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,190
Coolie!

1302
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,440
Hey, son of a disco dancer.

1303
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:11,690
Who are you?

1304
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,230
Who are you?

1305
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,820
I know who are you.

1306
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,190
Mahendra Pratap Singh's son.

1307
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,780
King of Singapore.

1308
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,780
Get lost.

1309
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,340
The world's my home,
the station's my hangout.

1310
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,250
And my job is to carry luggage.

1311
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:26,130
And entertain people.

1312
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,670
The name's Raju.

1313
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,090
Orphan. But I like to have fun.

1314
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,750
And people call me Coolie no. 1

1315
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,880
Any doubts.

1316
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,960
Any doubt.

1317
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,540
What doubt?
What the f***

1318
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,960
Listen, mister, mind your tongue.

1319
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,790
Why are you pestering Raju?

1320
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,960
He's been working here
as a coolie for many years.

1321
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,420
- Isn't that right?
- Yes! Yes!

1322
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,710
He's not a coolie. He's my son-in-law.

1323
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,710
Don't kill my vibe, or I'll vanquish your tribe

1324
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,500
To hell with your son-in-law.

1325
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,000
- Where...
- Hell.

1326
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,790
Now get lost or I'll punch you so hard...

1327
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,330
...that you'll start bleeding
from both the nostrils.

1328
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,210
The train's coming.
I guess he bit some mad dog.

1329
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,960
- Get lost old man.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1330
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,460
Me mad?

1331
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,420
Father of the bride is mad?

1332
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,960
Coming, sir, coming.

1333
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,790
Let's go. Let's go.

1334
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,750
Pandit sir, I am in trouble.

1335
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,960
Sarah.

1336
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,040
Saru.

1337
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,120
Are you angry because I am late?

1338
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,080
Look what I brought for you.

1339
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,040
See...

1340
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,250
I'll take that lingerie.

1341
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:08,960
That sounded like daddy.

1342
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:09,830
It is him.

1343
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,960
Dad...

1344
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,120
Sorry, I didn't see you.

1345
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:17,170
But I saw you...
At the railway station.

1346
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,670
Coolie. Coolie.

1347
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,250
Coolie?
Coolie, who?

1348
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,580
You...a coolie.

1349
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:25,670
Dad saw you at the railway station.

1350
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,210
Working as a coolie.

1351
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:30,790
You think I'll work as a coolie.
Prince Raj Pratap Singh.

1352
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,670
Enough of Prince Raj Pratap Singh.

1353
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,500
To hell with this Prince.

1354
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,750
He's lying, dear.

1355
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:39,060
The person you saw
at the railway station

1356
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,640
wasn't Prince Raj Pratap Singh.

1357
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,020
That was Raju.

1358
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,520
Prince Raj's twin brother.

1359
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:46,970
Twin?

1360
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,470
Did you hear?

1361
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,180
Do I have Moron written on my face?

1362
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:54,310
That you'll make up some
twin story and I'll buy it.

1363
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,560
I'm not make up anything.

1364
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,850
I'll give you a proof.

1365
01:11:58,970 --> 01:11:59,890
- Proof?
- Yes.

1366
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,720
- Proof?
- Yes.

1367
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:02,970
Watch.

1368
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:07,810
Same-to-same.

1369
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,850
If he was the only one, it would've been
called Kunwar Multinational Company.

1370
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:18,470
But since they are two, that's
why Kunwar and Kunwar Multinational.

1371
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:19,600
Simple.

1372
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,810
No, no...he wasn't in
the picture until yesterday.

1373
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,310
Where did he pop up from?

1374
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:26,810
And even if he did how did he get so big?

1375
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,520
And why would a boy from
a rich family work as a porter.

1376
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,930
It's a sad story.

1377
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,770
My brother had some bad habits.

1378
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,560
He had become an addict.

1379
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:39,220
And used to go to Red lights.

1380
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,390
Red light, you mean Traffic Signal?

1381
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,520
Red light area.

1382
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,270
Shabnam in one arm and rum in the other.

1383
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:45,600
And that too neat.

1384
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:49,930
When dad found out about
his habits he threw Raju out of the house.

1385
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:50,810
Then what...

1386
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:54,890
Raju started working
as a porter to humiliate papa.

1387
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,520
I mean...porter.

1388
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,890
Today cause of his mistakes
I've go to pay the price.

1389
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,060
I even left my father for my reputation

1390
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,850
...but today my father-in-law
and wife tarnished it.

1391
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,310
Shame on me!

1392
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:12,560
- Shame on me! Shame on me!
- No, no, no, Raj, sorry.

1393
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,600
Sorry, Raj. It was a mistake.

1394
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,600
We...we don't doubt you at all.

1395
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,640
We completely trust you.

1396
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,060
Tell him, dad!

1397
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,470
Yeah...

1398
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,430
We...trust you...also.

1399
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,180
You do, do you?

1400
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:31,140
Sarah, serve lunch. I am starving.

1401
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:32,020
Come.

1402
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:33,060
Come on.

1403
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,470
Raj...

1404
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,470
Raju.

1405
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,890
Raju-Raj.

1406
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,180
Raju-Raj-Raj-Raju.

1407
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,350
- That Rozario's living in my house.
- Are you serious?

1408
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,430
Seems like I am married to him.

1409
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,220
- I wish I could...
- Don't worry.

1410
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:49,020
Raj...

1411
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:50,890
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

1412
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:52,520
Raj, what are you doing here?

1413
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,140
Dad must be getting bored inside.

1414
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,020
Let's take him out.

1415
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,640
But dad left in the morning.

1416
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,350
- Dad left.
- What?

1417
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,350
- Dad left.
- I didn't hear you.

1418
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,180
- Dad left.
- Say it again.

1419
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,560
Dad left.

1420
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,020
Dad left.

1421
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,430
"Monalisa..."

1422
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,970
"Monalisa..."

1423
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,810
"This isn't fair."

1424
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,680
"Monalisa..."

1425
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:25,560
"I won't stop coming after you."

1426
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,180
"What a mind-blowing
girl I've impressed."

1427
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,770
"What a mind-blowing
girl I've impressed."

1428
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,640
"Mother promise I'm gonna die."

1429
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:46,060
"Winter has arrived."

1430
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,640
"Winter has arrived."

1431
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,680
"And the blanket's too small."

1432
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:03,520
"I've found your earring
from the marketplace..."

1433
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,640
"...waiting at your doorstep
like a lover estranged."

1434
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,310
"I found your earring
from the marketplace..."

1435
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,520
"...waiting at your doorstep
like a lover estranged."

1436
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:27,430
"Your beauty's giving
me sleepless nights."

1437
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,930
"Your beauty's giving
me sleepless nights."

1438
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,100
"Mother promise I'm gonna die."

1439
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:00,060
"I won't be impressed, sweetheart."

1440
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,720
"Why do you drag
your mom in the middle?"

1441
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:14,560
"I won't be impressed, sweetheart."

1442
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,310
"Why do you drag
your mom in the middle?"

1443
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,140
"Why don't you quit chasing me?"

1444
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:21,970
"You're so persistent."

1445
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,560
"I won't believe
in your lies...lies...lies..."

1446
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,060
"You got me imprisoned for life."

1447
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:34,640
"You got me imprisoned for life."

1448
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,890
"Mother swear I'm gonna die."

1449
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,810
"I am lucky you're my wife.

1450
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:51,520
"I am lucky you're my wife.

1451
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,890
"Mother promise I'm gonna die."

1452
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,720
"Mother promise..."

1453
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,600
"Mother promise die."

1454
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,520
"Mother promise..."

1455
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,430
"Mother promise die."

1456
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,220
Mummy!

1457
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:38,640
Singing Goa Song

1458
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:41,970
Singing Goa Song

1459
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,220
Singing Goa Song

1460
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,060
Jeffery.

1461
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,560
You left yesterday and returned today?

1462
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,810
And now I'll say my
'Hello-hi' and leave again.

1463
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:50,600
Why?

1464
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,640
Why, mummy?

1465
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:54,310
It's buy 1 get 1 free season.

1466
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:54,890
What?

1467
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,640
Meaning with one son-in-law
get another son-in-law free.

1468
01:17:58,770 --> 01:17:59,720
Another son-in-law?

1469
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,970
Mummy, when we buy the map of India...

1470
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,770
...the map of Sri Lanka
comes complimentary.

1471
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,850
Similarly even this one's complimentary.

1472
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:08,890
Raj's kid brother Raju.

1473
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,600
We'll get Raju married to Anju.

1474
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,810
And imagine, mom.

1475
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:17,810
Anju will also become the daughter-in-law
of a royal billionaire family.

1476
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:22,100
Sooner or later...the father of
our sons-in-law will kick the bucket...

1477
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,770
- And both of them will pounce on wealth.
- No, no, Jeffery.

1478
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,600
You don't know their father, Jeffery.

1479
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,930
- So.
- Be patient. Wait.

1480
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:30,680
No, mom. If I wait, it'll be too late.

1481
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:31,680
Anju.

1482
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,310
Jeffery. Jeffery.

1483
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:37,470
Dad, where are we going?

1484
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,520
It's a surprise. I'll tell you later.

1485
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,560
Anju.

1486
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:41,970
Heaven on the dock.

1487
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,600
Did you pack your mini frocks?

1488
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,390
Dad...

1489
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,100
Come on.

1490
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,430
Jeffery, listen.

1491
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,890
Don't worry,
mom, I'll call you over soon.

1492
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:53,350
The Lord will keep you safe.
Just light candles.

1493
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,220
Why didn't he take me along now?

1494
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:59,520
You and Sarah have settled in.

1495
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,560
I wish Anju and I
get married pretty soon.

1496
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,890
Do something, Raju. Think of something.

1497
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,350
Don't be mad.

1498
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,430
How can you even think of marrying Anju?

1499
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,020
She is a millionaire's daughter
and you're just a cheap mechanic.

1500
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,430
What are you?

1501
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:16,560
I am much better than you.
At least I am a mechanic.

1502
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,560
Car?

1503
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,970
That's not a train. It's a car.

1504
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:26,310
Deepak.

1505
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,350
Raju. Raju.

1506
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,520
Raju, my dear, Raju.

1507
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,770
Why do you keep following me?
Any doubt?

1508
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:41,470
No doubt, only luck.

1509
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,600
Deepak, what are you doing here?

1510
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,970
I came to meet the young master.

1511
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,390
Even I came to meet the CM.

1512
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,180
CM?

1513
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:49,100
Chote Malik. (Young master)

1514
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:50,640
- You know why?
- Why?

1515
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,890
Because we're relatives. We're related.

1516
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:53,930
Related how?

1517
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,970
Your twin brother
Raj married my daughter.

1518
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,270
He got married, man.

1519
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:01,520
Hey...??

1520
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,180
I want nothing to do with my brother...

1521
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:04,350
...why would I entertain you?

1522
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:07,520
But you will have to. And come
with me wherever I tell you to go.

1523
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,640
Swear on the creator.
I won't go anywhere with you.

1524
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,600
- You mean you won't listen to me.
- No.

1525
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,720
- Are you sure?
- No.

1526
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,470
Then I'll go see your father.

1527
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,560
Why? Why? Why?

1528
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,350
I'll go tell him...what
kind of a father is he.

1529
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:26,720
Father's rolling in riches,
And his son's down here in ditches.

1530
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:27,770
Hey...

1531
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,270
What father is he going to?
The one I don't have.

1532
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:35,930
How would I know?

1533
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,270
- Deepak, I am in traffic.
- You mean trouble.

1534
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,970
Trouble!

1535
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,180
Watchman!

1536
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:44,100
Watchman!

1537
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,270
Open the gate bloody Watchman!

1538
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,100
Hey...I won't let you meet my father.

1539
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,100
I am going to teach your father a lesson

1540
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:53,220
He's not some school that you'll teach.

1541
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,020
Deepak.

1542
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,390
Please, Mr. Rozario.

1543
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,060
If you complain about my
young master to my master's master...

1544
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:03,220
...then my master's master will reprimand
my young master.

1545
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:04,270
He's right.

1546
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:05,770
Forget all this.

1547
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:08,020
- I'll go wherever you say...
- I am not luggage.

1548
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:08,890
No, Raju.

1549
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,060
See...now he's on the right track.

1550
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:14,180
Now you'll have to
go wherever I tell you.

1551
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,520
Sings Goan Song

1552
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,640
Welcome, Welcome.

1553
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,350
From today you'll live here, Young Prince.

1554
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:33,430
Anju.

1555
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,770
- What?
- Anju.

1556
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,640
Anju. Surprise.

1557
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:42,270
Deepak.

1558
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,310
Deepak? Surprise?

1559
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,850
Even his parents were
surprised when he was born.

1560
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:51,470
Come.

1561
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,430
This.

1562
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:53,970
Brother-in-law.

1563
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,680
Brother-in-law?

1564
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:00,390
See...even you got duped like me.

1565
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:05,180
He's your brother-in-law's
twin brother Raju.

1566
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,350
He's a bachelor.

1567
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,560
And she...is your sister-in-law's sister.

1568
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,220
She's a bachelor.

1569
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,560
This old man will take Anju from me.

1570
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,640
Why are you stressing
on 'bachelor' so much?

1571
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,520
I am not the correct guy for your Anju.

1572
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,390
- There's a lot missing in me.
- Missing?

1573
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,640
- Come on. Come on.
- Raju...

1574
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:26,390
There was a lot missing
in 'Sholay' as well.

1575
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,520
Thakur's arms were missing,
Gabbar's home was missing,

1576
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,430
Jaya Bhaduri's dialogues were missing.

1577
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,810
What can I do?

1578
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:36,180
Get to know Anju.
And you'll miss her too.

1579
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,220
Take her out.

1580
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,720
Do I look like a tourist guide to you?

1581
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:41,430
I won't go at any cost.

1582
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,560
- You won't go?
- No.

1583
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:43,680
- Are you sure?
- No.

1584
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:45,020
Then I'm going to your father...

1585
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,720
I'll take her out at any cost.

1586
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:49,220
I will...

1587
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:51,810
I've heard Mumbai's
ice-candies are pretty famous.

1588
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:54,390
- Let's have some.
- Fine, then stop here.

1589
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,430
Hey...Tambi, two ice-candies.

1590
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,060
Right away.

1591
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,600
Two ice-candies for those two.

1592
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:20,770
Prince!

1593
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,890
Prince...

1594
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:28,970
Look what that rascal did to me.

1595
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,350
Prince...

1596
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:35,310
- Who the hell is he?
- Dedh-phutia. Juhu's gangster.

1597
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:37,430
- What?
- Let's go. Come on.

1598
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,640
Let's go, let's go.

1599
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:42,350
Oh my, god. He's climbed up on the car.

1600
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:43,770
What the hell is he doing?

1601
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:47,520
- Stop. Stop.
- Drive faster. Drive faster.

1602
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:50,520
They make me wash all the plates.

1603
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,600
Raj, let go of the steering
wheel let me drive.

1604
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:53,560
Prince...

1605
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,720
Turn, turn, turn...

1606
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,310
Prince left me.

1607
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,220
Prince dressed like a coolie.

1608
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,060
Is he a coolie?

1609
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:18,640
Today I'll pester him so
much that he'll throw me out.

1610
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,560
Good lord.

1611
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,180
Dear-dear son-in-law.

1612
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,100
- I've been waiting for you.
- Don't touch.

1613
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,890
Don't touch? Should I serve dinner?

1614
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,430
This is not the time to eat.

1615
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,600
Bring me a soda, snacks, and ice.

1616
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,520
I can't sleep until I don't drink.

1617
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,970
- Drink.
- "Julie-Julie."

1618
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:35,970
Yuck.

1619
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,720
You didn't like it, did you?
Then throw me out.

1620
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,220
I've brought something better for you.

1621
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:42,350
Wait.

1622
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,600
He won't stop until I am not drunk.

1623
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,430
Look.

1624
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,100
Full bottle.

1625
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,770
Looks more like a barrel.
I won't drink it.

1626
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:51,930
- You won't.
- No.

1627
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,270
- Are you sure?
- No.

1628
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:54,310
Then I'll go offer some to your father.

1629
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,560
I will drink it.

1630
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,600
Always using my father...

1631
01:24:58,890 --> 01:24:59,770
Anju.

1632
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:04,270
Bring a glass,
soda, ice, snacks...turn on the AC.

1633
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,970
Cheers.

1634
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,430
Raju.

1635
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:24,970
Raju.

1636
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,140
Raju, wake up.

1637
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:27,220
Let me sleep.

1638
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,560
Your sister-in-law's here. She's crying.

1639
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,270
- I don't have a sister-in-law.
- What?

1640
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,180
- Sister-in-law?
- Yes.

1641
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:34,520
And she's crying.

1642
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,560
Why is she crying?

1643
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,270
What do I tell you, dad?

1644
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,560
He hasn't returned since last night.

1645
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,520
I am worried.

1646
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,890
Don't worry, dear.

1647
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,270
Don't worry.

1648
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,680
There you are.

1649
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,850
Where were you?

1650
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,020
Don't leave me alone again.

1651
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,890
Please don't do it again.

1652
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,470
Sarah. Sarah.

1653
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,180
Sarah, he's not your husband Raj.

1654
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,350
He's his brother Raju.

1655
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,270
What?

1656
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:09,970
Yes.

1657
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,560
Sorry.

1658
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,350
Sorry.

1659
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,640
You see...you two look exactly the same...

1660
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:19,350
So... sorry.

1661
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,930
What do I say?

1662
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:25,390
He hasn't come home since last night.

1663
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:29,220
Even his phone's switched off.
I've been trying for so long.

1664
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,890
He must have got drunk and passed out.

1665
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,680
No. He doesn't drink.

1666
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,850
Sometimes people force you to drink.

1667
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:45,890
Don't worry, dear.
Let's all go together and find him.

1668
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,270
Okay.
Come, Raju.

1669
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:50,430
If I come along you'll never find him.

1670
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,560
I'll go and find him, sister-in-law.

1671
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,770
No, no, let's all go together.

1672
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:58,520
A family that looks together,
finds together.

1673
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,140
No!

1674
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,700
Sir, my son-in-law's
been missing since last night.

1675
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:04,820
Now it's dawn.

1676
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,660
The milkman delivered milk,
the baker delivered bread...

1677
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:08,660
...but still no sign of him.

1678
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:10,780
Do you have a picture of him?

1679
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,070
Yes, yes.

1680
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,700
Here you go.

1681
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,660
For god's sake please find him.

1682
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,620
I am worried about him.

1683
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:28,240
"Whose face is this in the picture?"

1684
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,990
"Whose is it?"

1685
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,950
"...the one that's in front of me."

1686
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,990
- Dhople.
- Sir.

1687
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,450
Catch him and hand him over to them.

1688
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,910
Inspector, he's my twin brother.

1689
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,700
I've been trying to
explain to this miser.

1690
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,620
Chuck the Police complain in the sea.

1691
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:55,910
I said I'll go alone
and find that son of a gun.

1692
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,950
Why are you always staring at me?

1693
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:01,910
Take him home and lock him up.

1694
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,370
Otherwise, our cops will
catch him and you'll say...

1695
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:10,120
"We found him...found him... found him..."

1696
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,160
He's completely shaken.

1697
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,700
Repeat that again. I didn't get it.

1698
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,820
He said found him, found him.

1699
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,570
Raj. You're back.

1700
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,200
Where were you?

1701
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:27,570
You didn't return last night.

1702
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:29,030
What are you doing? I fall down.

1703
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,490
This is the fifth time
I checked back since morning.

1704
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,660
I went to Pune last
night to meet the lawyer.

1705
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:35,570
When I came home it was locked.

1706
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,660
And the wife's missing.

1707
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:37,780
Where were you?

1708
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,820
We thought you went missing.

1709
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,200
I am not a kid to go missing.

1710
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,280
Open the door. I haven't slept a wink.

1711
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,490
I need some rest.

1712
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:48,620
Right. You get some rest.

1713
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:49,910
I'll be back from the temple.

1714
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:52,030
But...why the temple?

1715
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,120
I had prayed.

1716
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:58,870
When you are found I'll
first thank Lord Ganesha.

1717
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:03,950
You love me so much, and Ganesha too.

1718
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:06,370
Let me go.

1719
01:29:10,570 --> 01:29:11,620
I've lost my mind.

1720
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,620
Hey daredevil,
give us your purse and ring.

1721
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:37,620
What for?

1722
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,370
Who do you think you are?

1723
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,280
Hey...

1724
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,410
Do not touch.

1725
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,660
What's wrong, sister-in-law?

1726
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:44,870
Brother-in-law?

1727
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:49,370
Brother-in-law, these guys are trying
to steal my ring and purse.

1728
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,490
Why you...

1729
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:53,910
He's a coward.

1730
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:55,120
Not the face.

1731
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,490
He's a wimp.

1732
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,410
Guys, I beg you...

1733
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:01,990
Stop begging you, coward.

1734
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:06,370
Not a coward. I think he's crazy.

1735
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:11,160
Sister-in-law,
just handover the ring and purse.

1736
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,070
Soon. Soon.

1737
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,490
- No, no.
- Give it.

1738
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,120
Sister-in-law, when there's
life there's brother's wife.

1739
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,200
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

1740
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,490
- Give it here.
- We're the same.

1741
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:19,950
Now get lost.
- We're one.

1742
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:21,620
- Let's go.
- Get lost.

1743
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:23,120
Don't look back, sister-in-law.

1744
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,700
- Get lost.
- Times are bad.

1745
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,240
Get lost.

1746
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,870
Wimp!

1747
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:31,280
Raju. Raju. At least get my ring back.

1748
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:33,120
Raj gave me that ring.

1749
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,660
Okay, sister-in-law, I'll try.

1750
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,780
Please.

1751
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,950
Punching me in the stomach?

1752
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,700
I look like a coward to you, right ?

1753
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:47,160
Yes.

1754
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,950
Who isn't scared of goons?

1755
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,280
But you know what...

1756
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:53,780
When God's with you,
no one can harm him.

1757
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:03,070
I look like a wimp to you?

1758
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,240
Yes, I am a wimp.

1759
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:18,280
Raju...

1760
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:20,780
Raju, I look like a coward to you?

1761
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:22,200
Get lost, Malinga.

1762
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:23,660
Raju... Raju...

1763
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,740
Give me. Give me. Give me.

1764
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,410
- Give me.
- Leave me.

1765
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,030
Do I look crazy to you?

1766
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:52,620
Crazy...

1767
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:56,660
Sister-in-law.

1768
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:57,620
Sister-in-law.

1769
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:01,370
I will tell him how good you are.

1770
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,820
I mean he's always
talking rubbish about you.

1771
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,070
Forget it, sister-in-law.

1772
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,490
One can't stop anyone
from saying things.

1773
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,660
Okay, see you then.

1774
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:09,910
How can I let you go?

1775
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,780
- Come upstairs.
- No, sister-in-law.

1776
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,200
Even I have a reputation.

1777
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,200
I won't come up until
he doesn't call me.

1778
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,910
Okay, but wait here.
I'll go call him.

1779
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:19,950
- Okay.
- Wait here.

1780
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:20,740
- Right here.
- Okay.

1781
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:21,620
Okay, sister-in-law.

1782
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,570
Okay, fine.

1783
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:26,780
Raju.

1784
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:27,780
Raj.

1785
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:29,620
Raj.

1786
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,660
Raj, where are you?

1787
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:32,700
Raj.

1788
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:34,700
Sarah, at least let me shower in peace.

1789
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:36,910
Enough...brother-in-law's here.
Come, let's meet him.

1790
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:39,070
Brother-in-law.
What is that alcoholic doing here?

1791
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,490
Raj, he saved me from goons today,
you know.

1792
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,530
He thrashed them.
Come on.

1793
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:46,410
What else do you expect
of a goon after all?

1794
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:47,410
Bloody ruffian.

1795
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:50,030
Raj, enough. Bury the past.
Come on.

1796
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:53,030
What are you doing, Sarah?
Sarah. Sarah, wait.

1797
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,120
Brother-in-law.

1798
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,280
Brother-in-law.

1799
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,120
Where did he go?

1800
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,370
He's gone, the bloody ruffian.

1801
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:04,320
Let's go.

1802
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:24,030
Jeffery Rozario, I've come
to tell you something important.

1803
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,870
Raju Coolie is a...

1804
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:40,320
Rozario, Raju Coolie is taking
you and both your daughters...

1805
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:11,620
Godbole. Why take the extra trouble?

1806
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:13,200
I found my son-in-law.

1807
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,910
Swear on the creator.

1808
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,620
And the matchmaker.

1809
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,570
Tobacco causes cancer.

1810
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,620
And a guy like me is disco dancer.

1811
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:23,870
yeah-yeah...

1812
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,030
"Julie-Julie..."

1813
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,120
"Johnny's mad about Julie..."

1814
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,820
"For her he can do all sorts of crazies."

1815
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:31,820
"That's Raju Coolie-Raju
Coolie-Raju Coolie."

1816
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:36,450
Rozario, Raju Coolie and
your son-in-law are the same people.

1817
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:37,870
Are you blind?

1818
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:39,820
He's only mimicking his voice.

1819
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,780
Are you deaf?

1820
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,530
The city's filled with people who
can mimic Mithun Chakraborty's voice.

1821
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,530
I am going to charge
him with section 304...

1822
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:49,370
...who put me in the
sack and cracked my eggs.

1823
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:51,450
That hurts. Bloody hurts.

1824
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,780
Can't sleep?

1825
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:58,780
I will.

1826
01:34:58,950 --> 01:34:59,530
I will.

1827
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:00,950
Sarah.

1828
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,070
Sarah.

1829
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:03,870
Dad?

1830
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,200
Dad!

1831
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:07,410
Come down.

1832
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:14,280
Daddy.

1833
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:15,410
My baby.

1834
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:17,070
How are you, daddy?

1835
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,240
So good to see you, dear. Thank you.

1836
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:24,570
Why are Raj and you living
in a place like this?

1837
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:26,910
Makes me cry.

1838
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:28,410
It's okay, daddy.

1839
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:29,370
Anyway...

1840
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:32,160
A father has thought
of something for his children.

1841
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,490
Don't say no, okay.

1842
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,660
- What is this?
- This is a honeymoon package.

1843
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,450
3-days, 2-nights stay free.

1844
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,740
Don't say no.

1845
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:42,280
There's complimentary breakfast as well.

1846
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:43,120
Please.

1847
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:44,530
Thank you, daddy.

1848
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,370
God bless you. God bless you.

1849
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,450
Why would I go on a 3-days
2-night stay with Anju?

1850
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:52,950
To lock-pop-and hip-hop
with my daughter.

1851
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,120
A father's allowing you.
Take her.

1852
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,450
Whatever...I won't go.

1853
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,870
- You won't go?
- No.

1854
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:00,030
- Are you sure?
- No.

1855
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,280
Then I am going to your father.

1856
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:03,910
No matter what, I'll go...

1857
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:11,820
Take me with you.

1858
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:13,740
- What are you doing?
- Hello, sir.

1859
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:14,990
Hello, madam.

1860
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,160
This is your bellboy, Mac.

1861
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:20,160
What Mac? You're as big as McDonald.

1862
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:23,910
We have a booking under the
name of Anjali Rozario and Raju...

1863
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:24,780
Pratap Singh.

1864
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:25,620
Let's go.

1865
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:29,820
Sir, we would like to inform you that the
hotel offers a complimentary breakfast.

1866
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,700
A bottle of wine and free wifi.

1867
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,370
To hell with your wifi.

1868
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:35,620
Show us to our room.

1869
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:37,410
The suite we're going to show you...

1870
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:40,280
...you would've never
seen a room as big as this.

1871
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,450
Forget the room...

1872
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:44,030
...I've never seen a fatso as big as you.

1873
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,410
That's extremely rude, sir.

1874
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:46,490
I agree.

1875
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,620
Why did you leave my hand?

1876
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:49,870
Anju.

1877
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:50,870
Wait.

1878
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,120
Listen to me.

1879
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:57,280
Happy meal,
who's going to take us to our room?

1880
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:58,410
Come on.

1881
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,410
One down.

1882
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,450
Anjali, walk with me.

1883
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,910
Your dad said...

1884
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,070
Wait a second, ma'am.
The keys to your room.

1885
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:12,280
Thank you.

1886
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,620
Listen to me.

1887
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,280
No, don't touch me.

1888
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,820
By the bellboy,
I heard you've got a sound reputation.

1889
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:25,700
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1890
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:28,530
Unfortunately, no one respects you.

1891
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:33,240
How rude.

1892
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,450
What?

1893
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:38,410
Anjali.

1894
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:40,820
Raju. Don't come any closer.

1895
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:41,780
Why not?

1896
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:42,950
I love someone else.

1897
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:46,070
- Who do you love, Anjali? Tell me.
- Just stop it.

1898
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,370
- Tell me, Anjali.
- Please, stop it.

1899
01:37:47,410 --> 01:37:48,870
Anju.

1900
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,780
Plumber.

1901
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:54,700
Hi.

1902
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:27,280
How am I looking?

1903
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:28,570
Superb.

1904
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:30,950
Thank you.

1905
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,570
And me?

1906
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:35,240
You...

1907
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,410
You're already exploding from all sides.

1908
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,820
Do you want to blow up?

1909
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:41,950
- Relax, Raj.
- Show us to our room.

1910
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:43,950
Please.

1911
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:51,120
- Baby...
- I've something to...

1912
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:53,030
Sir, we need to...

1913
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,410
I am a Prince, I don't talk to the poor.

1914
01:38:58,450 --> 01:38:59,370
Prince?

1915
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,570
A penny.

1916
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:08,780
Gentleman.

1917
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:09,990
- Did you see...
- What?

1918
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:12,950
...that guy came with
a different girl first.

1919
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:14,910
She was my daughter.

1920
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:17,700
And now he arrived
with a different girl.

1921
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:20,570
You jolly young man
she's my daughter too.

1922
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:21,950
Why?

1923
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:24,280
Can't a man have two daughters?

1924
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:27,620
And there's two of him, not one.

1925
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:28,410
Two.

1926
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:30,660
Heaven on the docks, man.

1927
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:33,240
Twins out of the box, man.

1928
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,410
Singing Goan Song

1929
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,780
Singing Goan Song

1930
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,910
"Beauty's..."

1931
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:05,660
"Love's..."

1932
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,030
"My body's beautiful..."

1933
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,950
"My love's passionate..."

1934
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:15,700
"I want to shower my love on you..."

1935
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:19,450
"Come and take me in your embrace."

1936
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,950
"No..."

1937
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:21,950
"No..."

1938
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:22,950
"No..."

1939
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:26,820
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1940
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:30,620
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1941
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:34,490
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1942
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:38,740
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1943
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,620
"My beauty's been giving you signs."

1944
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:03,450
"Don't seduce me like this, silly."

1945
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:07,240
"Don't seduce me like this, silly."

1946
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:18,950
"My beauty's been giving you signs."

1947
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:22,820
"Don't seduce me like this, silly."

1948
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:26,320
"Don't seduce me like this, silly."

1949
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:30,660
"Come closer...come closer, beloved."

1950
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:38,200
"Sweetheart,
you're the queen of my dreams."

1951
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:45,740
"I'll make you mine, look into my eyes."

1952
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,660
"No..."

1953
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,660
"No..."

1954
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,660
"No..."

1955
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:52,570
"Sweetheart's driving me crazy."

1956
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:56,240
"Sweetheart's driving me crazy."

1957
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,990
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1958
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:04,410
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1959
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:33,200
"The moment of love doesn't come often."

1960
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:36,780
"Why do you draw me closer like this?"

1961
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,660
"Why do you draw me closer like this?"

1962
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:45,070
"Don't torment me slowly..."

1963
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:52,620
"Don't make me stagger with
your words on a night like this?"

1964
01:42:56,160 --> 01:43:00,070
"What are your intentions, beloved."

1965
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:00,910
"No..."

1966
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,910
"No..."

1967
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:03,030
"No..."

1968
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:06,870
"Sweetheart, your lover's crazy."

1969
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:10,620
"Sweetheart, your lover's crazy."

1970
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:14,410
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1971
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:18,120
"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart."

1972
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:39,190
Daddy.

1973
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:39,770
Yeah.

1974
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:40,770
What's wrong?

1975
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:42,940
Anju's having
a headache since morning.

1976
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:45,270
She's vomiting. Taking pills.

1977
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,400
The doctor's checking her.
Let's see what's wrong.

1978
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,150
Congratulations, Jeffery.

1979
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:50,900
Anju's pregnant.

1980
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:53,150
You're going to be a grandpa.

1981
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:54,350
- How?
- Grandpa?

1982
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,020
But she was fine till last night.

1983
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:01,900
This is Raju's doing.

1984
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,270
Serves you right for sending
him with Anju all the time.

1985
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,980
See the result.

1986
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:08,270
Look, he's my brother.

1987
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,310
He can never do such a thing.

1988
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,520
What do you mean?
It's all his fault.

1989
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:13,520
And the doctor just checked Anju.

1990
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:15,270
- And not some Manju or Ranju.
- Daddy.

1991
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:18,190
Mummy, now what to do?

1992
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,150
Like a responsible father...

1993
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:23,150
...you got to meet the boy's father
and discuss this.

1994
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:23,560
I see...

1995
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,150
I hope he agrees.

1996
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:27,400
He will have to agree.

1997
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,350
You know why?

1998
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:31,770
Mummy, the biggest joy for any father...

1999
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:34,150
...is when he becomes a grandpa.
Grandpa!

2000
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,350
Heaven on the docks, man.

2001
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,690
I'll meet his father
with sweets in the box, man.

2002
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:46,230
Hey Deepak...

2003
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:46,810
What?

2004
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,270
You killed my vibe

2005
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,980
Now I'll go and vanquish your tribe

2006
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,190
- Back to work all of you.
- When did you and Anju do it?

2007
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:52,810
Tell me.

2008
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,650
Raju, what's wrong with you?
Why are you talking like this?

2009
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:56,480
Shit.

2010
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:58,900
I've lost my mind playing double roles.

2011
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,600
Doesn't matter. It happens.

2012
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:03,350
Don't change the topic.
When did you do it?

2013
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:08,310
When you would meet Sarah,
I would go to meet Anju.

2014
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:11,150
It's alright. Sip some tea.

2015
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,770
You know what,
put some poison in this tea for me.

2016
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:14,400
Why?

2017
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,810
I would rather die
than live a life like this.

2018
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:19,100
Then die.

2019
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,270
How dare you say that for a friend.

2020
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,770
I am saying this because I am a friend.

2021
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,810
You will have to die.

2022
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:28,100
Not Kunwar Rajpratap Singh.

2023
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,940
But Raju Coolie.

2024
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,150
Sir...

2025
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:39,560
Have a sweet. Have a sweet.

2026
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:42,770
Singing Goan Song

2027
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,850
Singing Goan Song

2028
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:49,150
Singing Goan Song

2029
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:52,190
Singing Goan Song

2030
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,810
Singing Goan Song

2031
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,020
Who are you?

2032
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:02,100
First sweet,
then congratulation, then introductions.

2033
01:46:02,190 --> 01:46:04,600
- Have a sweet.
- Sweet? What for?

2034
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:06,440
I am going to be a granddad.

2035
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:07,560
Granddad.

2036
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:09,190
But who are you?

2037
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:13,440
You are going to be
the grandpa of my grandson.

2038
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,190
You.

2039
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,230
Meaning your son and my daughter.

2040
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:17,440
Ohh...

2041
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,980
So my son's been seeing your daughter.

2042
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:23,940
I know greedy people like you too well!

2043
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:29,100
But I will not let this happen! No!

2044
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:32,310
The lives of both my
daughters are at stake!

2045
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,770
And you will not let this happen!

2046
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:37,060
Mind you, I'll sue you!

2047
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:39,150
How dare you speak to me like this!

2048
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:42,600
Guards. Throw this man out.

2049
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:44,310
Throw him out.

2050
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:48,310
No one has ever humiliated
Jeffery Rozario like this.

2051
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:52,190
I am keeping my cool
because of my daughters.

2052
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:53,850
Otherwise, come to Goa.

2053
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:56,270
I'll show you...I'm the
bloody king over there.

2054
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,480
King.

2055
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,400
Leave me. Leave me.

2056
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:03,850
If you can't raise your
kids then why have them?

2057
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:07,310
One is begging on the streets
and the other is working as a coolie.

2058
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,150
- Another son?
- Yes, another son.

2059
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,020
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

2060
01:47:11,150 --> 01:47:12,560
What manager?

2061
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,560
Don't you know he has twin sons?

2062
01:47:14,690 --> 01:47:15,190
What?

2063
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:19,100
Tell him how his twins
are making him proud.

2064
01:47:19,190 --> 01:47:22,520
Tell him if he interferes in my matters...

2065
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:25,730
...then I'll bring this
mansion to the ground.

2066
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:29,190
Coolie's dad...yuck! Coolie's dad...yuck!

2067
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:30,440
Stop spitting.

2068
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:35,810
Coolie's dad...yuck!

2069
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:39,810
- Mahesh, I've good news for you.
- What?

2070
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:41,150
Remember Raju Coolie.

2071
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:42,690
How can I forget him?

2072
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:45,440
He's the reason I lost
this wealth and bungalow.

2073
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:49,980
The time's come, you'll
get your revenge and the bungalow.

2074
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:52,650
But don't forget my commission.

2075
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:12,270
What are you doing?

2076
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:13,770
Come on.

2077
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:19,980
I gave you the idea to kill Raju Coolie,
but what story are we going to tell.

2078
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:23,270
Raju took Rozario's car to the hills.

2079
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,230
Drunk.

2080
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:25,560
Fine, drunk.

2081
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:26,940
And then it happened
exactly as we feared.

2082
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:27,520
What?

2083
01:48:27,850 --> 01:48:32,150
Diving into a ravine,
Raju Coolie goes up into the skyline.

2084
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:33,730
Come on.

2085
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:38,770
Coolie no. 1. Goodbye.

2086
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:41,100
Don't look too happy.
I am not dying really.

2087
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:43,440
- Heave
- Ho...

2088
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:45,650
- Heave
- Ho...

2089
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,940
- Heave
- Ho...

2090
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:49,560
Raju Coolie.

2091
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:50,980
Goodbye.

2092
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:53,560
Raju.
Raju, my shirt's stuck.

2093
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:55,190
- Deepak.
- Your friend's dying, Raju.

2094
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,310
Your friend's dying, Raju.

2095
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,600
- Raju...
- Take off your shirt.

2096
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:01,560
Take off your shirt.

2097
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,190
Raju...

2098
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:38,230
Found it.

2099
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:39,690
Found it, sir.

2100
01:49:39,810 --> 01:49:40,850
Sir...

2101
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:42,020
Sir...

2102
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:43,060
We found it.

2103
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,480
Where is Raju?

2104
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,270
Don't know.

2105
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,190
Did he run...

2106
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,560
...or did he sink?

2107
01:50:02,150 --> 01:50:02,900
Raj.

2108
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,400
You have to be strong, Raj.

2109
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,560
Sarah, he was strong and I was weak.

2110
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:12,060
He wrote the exams but I would pass.

2111
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:15,810
He would send his passport,
and I would get the visa.

2112
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:19,770
He would lift luggage
at the railway station...

2113
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,730
...but he didn't burden
anyone with his corpse.

2114
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:23,600
No!

2115
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,600
I feel my brother's going to say...

2116
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:30,020
"Bro, don't cry. Don't cry, bro."

2117
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:31,150
Hey...

2118
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,690
"Don't cry, bro."

2119
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:34,400
Huh?

2120
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:35,480
My brother spoke.

2121
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,350
- He spoke to me.
- No, Raj.

2122
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:38,270
Please.

2123
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,730
Hey, bro, don't cry.

2124
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,900
I want to say something before I go.

2125
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:51,100
The person responsible
for my death is Rozario.

2126
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:53,940
Daddy?

2127
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:56,560
Everyone nowadays has Jio.

2128
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:59,480
But in my life there was Rozario.

2129
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,850
No!

2130
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:06,520
And before I go I will
say that Anju is a sweet girl.

2131
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:13,020
Before I go I want to request you all to
get her married to the person she likes.

2132
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:16,980
A guy that would be the
light (Deepak) in her life.

2133
01:51:17,190 --> 01:51:18,440
Deepak.

2134
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,100
I am going, bro.

2135
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:25,560
No, bro...

2136
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:27,480
I am going, bro.

2137
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,850
No, bro...

2138
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:30,560
See you, bro.

2139
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:31,980
No, bro...

2140
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:34,400
Bye, bro.

2141
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,560
You cannot do this to me, bro.

2142
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,230
No.

2143
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:39,270
- Raj.
- No.

2144
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:42,440
No.

2145
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,600
Raj.

2146
01:51:43,730 --> 01:51:44,400
Raj.

2147
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,150
Sir.

2148
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,940
Young master, good morning.

2149
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,650
Why do you look stunned?

2150
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,940
He's your manager.

2151
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:00,270
- Manager.
- Yes...

2152
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:06,980
The master,
your father, has called you right now.

2153
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:11,350
He was in tears and
saying that I lost one son...

2154
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:14,060
...and I don't want to lose the other one.

2155
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,650
So...he's called you over right
now to solve all differences.

2156
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:20,440
Please, come.

2157
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,600
I won't go.

2158
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:22,310
Raj.

2159
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:23,770
Are you mad?

2160
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:24,980
- I won't go.
- Raj.

2161
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:27,190
- He's your father, son. He's calling you.
- Forget the tea.

2162
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,190
Go on.

2163
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:29,850
Raj, let's go.

2164
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:31,900
He must be shattered
after hearing this news.

2165
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:32,350
Yes.

2166
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,850
For god's sake Raj,
you should be with him.

2167
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:37,060
- Go on.
- Come on, go.

2168
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,310
Be careful with him.
Or else he'll run away.

2169
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,100
Don't worry, I will take care.

2170
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:45,600
Sir, whatever I did
was the sake of my love.

2171
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:47,060
I am a poor man.

2172
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,730
If my wife finds out...

2173
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:53,480
Sir is waiting for you, Raju.

2174
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:57,190
He's in his room upstairs.

2175
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,020
Just go and apologise.

2176
01:52:59,190 --> 01:53:01,440
Okay, I'll beg for his forgiveness.
You take care of the rest.

2177
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,690
All the best.

2178
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:34,730
Sir...

2179
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:38,190
Sir...

2180
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:41,600
Sir, I am Raju.

2181
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:44,440
I know what I did was wrong.

2182
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:46,650
But please don't put me in jail.

2183
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,650
Or my wife will leave me, sir.

2184
01:53:49,690 --> 01:53:50,900
I am just a coolie.

2185
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:52,850
I work at Mumbai Central.

2186
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,730
Sir...

2187
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:03,060
Anybody there!

2188
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:05,060
Someone killed him!

2189
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:06,350
Anyone...

2190
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,980
What have you done?

2191
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:10,310
You killed my dad.

2192
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:13,480
Rascal, you're framing
me because I got you arrested.

2193
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:15,900
- This was your planning.
- You rascal...

2194
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:17,850
What happened?

2195
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:19,230
What happened?

2196
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:21,810
Sir...

2197
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:26,350
I sent you here to apologise.

2198
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,980
But you killed him.

2199
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,480
I haven't done anything, sir.
He's framing me.

2200
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,270
- He's a rascal.
- Did what?

2201
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:36,190
I can see for myself...there's
blood on your hands.

2202
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:41,480
He is lying, sir. This is a facade.

2203
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:49,980
Inspector, he killed my boss.

2204
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:53,230
Inspector, I haven't don't anything.
They are lying.

2205
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:54,810
He isn't even dead, sir.

2206
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:55,940
He's still alive.

2207
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:57,730
He's still breathing.
Check for yourself.

2208
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,480
Please...
Check. Check him!

2209
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,650
Check him!

2210
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:05,900
Rascal duped me.

2211
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:26,520
Catch him.

2212
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:28,150
Deepak!

2213
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:29,810
Where is Deepak?

2214
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:30,650
There.

2215
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,060
Deepak!

2216
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:35,100
Deepak, listen.

2217
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:35,730
What are you doing?

2218
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:36,900
You know Mahendra Pratap
owner of the bungalow...

2219
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:37,190
Yes.

2220
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:39,310
- His son stabbed him.
- What are you saying?

2221
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,730
And I've been accused of it.

2222
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:43,690
Look...we must keep him
alive to prove me innocent.

2223
01:55:43,810 --> 01:55:44,190
Okay.

2224
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:46,730
Police are taking him to the hospital.

2225
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:48,900
His son will definitely
show up there to kill him.

2226
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:51,150
We must get there before him.

2227
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:52,350
Don't worry.

2228
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:54,850
Okay.

2229
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:57,020
Dad, tell me why are we here?

2230
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:59,020
To get a second opinion, dear.

2231
01:55:59,230 --> 01:56:02,730
With a hope that the doctor
says that you're not expecting.

2232
01:56:03,190 --> 01:56:04,230
- Talk to him.
- What...

2233
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,480
Anjali Motwani, Gynaecologist.

2234
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:09,650
The first floor, on the right.

2235
01:56:09,730 --> 01:56:10,940
- First floor. Thank you.
- Welcome.

2236
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:11,560
Let's go.

2237
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:13,480
- Let's go. Let's go.
- But why, I am walking with you, papa.

2238
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:16,440
??
- Rozario. Where is your son-in-law?

2239
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:22,600
The guy that comes to the Police station
and files his own missing complaint.

2240
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:24,480
I don't understand a thing.

2241
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:26,900
Have you ever seen them together?

2242
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,810
One leaves and the other shows up.

2243
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:31,400
Other leaves and the first one shows up.

2244
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,940
Do you know what his biggest crime is?

2245
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:34,650
What?

2246
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:38,020
He tried to kill Mahendra Pratap.

2247
01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:40,770
Inspector, what rubbish?

2248
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,650
Who tries to kill his father?

2249
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:45,600
Mahendra Pratap doesn't know him.

2250
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:46,900
What father?

2251
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:49,600
- Mahendra Pratap Singh is...
- Not his father.

2252
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:51,150
- And he's...
- Not his son.

2253
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:52,060
Then who is he?

2254
01:56:52,190 --> 01:56:54,440
He's just a coolie,
just a coolie, just a coolie.

2255
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,100
Just a coolie,
just a coolie, just a coolie.

2256
01:56:56,230 --> 01:56:57,230
I'll lose my mind.

2257
01:56:57,350 --> 01:57:00,350
He's just a coolie,
just a coolie, just a coolie.

2258
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,600
She is Julie, she's Julie, she's Julie.

2259
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:07,270
- What a big fraud.
- No, dad.

2260
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:10,690
He married one daughter
and got the other one pregnant.

2261
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:14,770
- No, daddy...
- I will ruin his entire family.

2262
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,730
He doesn't have a family.

2263
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:18,940
Come on.

2264
01:57:41,150 --> 01:57:43,900
- Gyno Karishma.
- Yes, nurse Kareena.

2265
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:46,400
Listen, you know why we're here right?

2266
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:47,440
Why?

2267
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,560
"I'm the nurse, you're the gyno."

2268
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:52,690
"Come with me..."

2269
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:55,480
"Where's the boss..."

2270
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,440
"...look around."

2271
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:59,440
"You're Deepak, I am Coolie..."

2272
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:02,600
"...if anyone finds out, we'll be..."

2273
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:03,940
You check the 7th floor.

2274
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:06,310
Sorry. My bad.

2275
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:08,770
Hey, what is...is what?

2276
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,020
What is...is what?

2277
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:12,190
I mean what is this, this is what?

2278
01:58:12,650 --> 01:58:13,770
I am sorry.

2279
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:14,810
It's okay.

2280
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,690
Wait a minute.

2281
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:18,480
I've seen you before.

2282
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,350
Hey inspector, first decide.

2283
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,150
Have you seen us or not?

2284
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:24,850
I am sure I've seen you.

2285
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:26,600
Madam, you are...

2286
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,850
Above your paygrade.

2287
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:32,690
"We uproot every disease from the root..."

2288
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:36,230
"Singapore nurses. Singapore nurses."

2289
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,690
Very shitty policeman, I like your cap.

2290
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,190
Dhople.

2291
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:43,190
- Dhople.
- Sir.

2292
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:45,190
Two nurses rammed into me.

2293
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:46,230
Where were you?

2294
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,270
"Singapore nurses."

2295
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,940
Deepak, check what room is he?

2296
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,270
What are you doing here?

2297
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:05,730
I mean what is this
cute girl doing here?

2298
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:06,650
Hey man, who are you?

2299
01:59:06,770 --> 01:59:07,940
I am nurse Kareena.

2300
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:10,190
And I am gyno Karishma.

2301
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,190
- Gynaecologist?
- Yeah.

2302
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:15,400
Then only you two
can do this job for me.

2303
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:19,350
Okay. Okay.

2304
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:20,980
You're f***

2305
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,690
- Why?
- They want to abort the child.

2306
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,060
I'll handle it.

2307
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:27,440
Look, over-aged uncle, we'll do it.

2308
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,850
- Thank you.
- But first,

2309
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:30,560
your baby has to come with your baby

2310
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:32,230
Come, baby, come with us.

2311
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:33,400
Go with madam.

2312
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,400
Don't worry.

2313
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,400
Go, baby, go.

2314
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,440
Not you.

2315
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:39,480
Hello. Hello...

2316
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:42,100
I've seen you before.

2317
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:45,060
Oh, come on. Oh my, god.

2318
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:48,520
It's an old trick to impress girls.

2319
01:59:48,650 --> 01:59:53,440
Many say I'm the heartbeat of the youth,
queen of their dreams.

2320
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:54,650
What say, man.

2321
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:57,560
Heaven on the dock, man.

2322
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:59,850
Beauty in the frock, man.

2323
02:00:00,350 --> 02:00:02,270
Get lost pervert.

2324
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:07,100
How could you agree?

2325
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:08,900
How could you agree to abort this child?

2326
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:09,520
But I...

2327
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:11,440
You love Deepak, don't you?

2328
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:13,850
It's all my fault.

2329
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:16,850
I left you two alone at the hotel and...

2330
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:17,560
Brother-in-law.

2331
02:00:17,650 --> 02:00:19,440
To hell with brother-in-law.

2332
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,900
Is something wrong with your voice?

2333
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,060
My entire life's gone wrong.

2334
02:00:24,190 --> 02:00:26,350
Raju, don't get some frustrated.

2335
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:27,600
Shut up.

2336
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:30,940
If anything had happened to the child,
I wouldn't have spared you.

2337
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:33,520
You take care of her.

2338
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,100
I'll go check on sir.

2339
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:45,060
Sarah, I made a mistake
but I am not a wrong guy.

2340
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:48,150
You just believe me.

2341
02:00:48,270 --> 02:00:49,600
Believe you?

2342
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,940
Believe who?

2343
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,850
On Raj?

2344
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:57,310
Raju Coolie?

2345
02:00:58,100 --> 02:00:59,350
Or a nurse?

2346
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:07,650
Wait.

2347
02:01:08,650 --> 02:01:09,310
Go.

2348
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:42,520
Sister...

2349
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,310
Hey...I am not your sister.

2350
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:04,190
Let's go. Let's go, Raju.

2351
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:30,980
I wouldn't even resuscitate my wife,
but this is different.

2352
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:31,850
Oh, God.

2353
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:47,770
Congratulations. Congratulations.

2354
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:50,520
Sir, keep your mouth open.

2355
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:53,350
Inspector, you'll get Corona.

2356
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,900
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Who is that? Where are you taking me?

2357
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:56,560
Come on.

2358
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:58,850
Is this oneway ticket to Hong Kong?

2359
02:02:58,980 --> 02:03:01,310
I am saving his life.

2360
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:04,350
I am saving him, inspector.

2361
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,980
I am saving his life.

2362
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:07,150
Dhople.

2363
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:11,480
Sir. Sir.
What happened?

2364
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,650
Where were you?

2365
02:03:12,730 --> 02:03:13,230
Wake up.

2366
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:16,350
Whenever I get whacked,
my crazy heart says...

2367
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:19,020
- Dhople. Dhople. Dhople. Dhople.
- Where is sir?

2368
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:21,270
Forget sir. Ask about the nurse.

2369
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,190
Where is the nurse?

2370
02:03:22,310 --> 02:03:23,650
- Nurse?
- Nurse!

2371
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:31,770
Raju.

2372
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:33,400
Deepak, take him someplace safe.

2373
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,350
Right, right, right, nurse.

2374
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:46,900
I'll take this patient
to the operation theatre.

2375
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:48,810
Excuse me. Who are you?

2376
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:52,190
I am Dr. Joshi. Manoj Joshi.

2377
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,150
Cardiac surgeon.

2378
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:55,100
I've seen you before.

2379
02:03:55,230 --> 02:03:56,480
In the operation theatre.

2380
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:58,690
How could I have seen
you in the operation theatre?

2381
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:01,690
Your mother...is the one I operated on.

2382
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:03,230
Mom got operated.

2383
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:05,650
Why doesn't she tell me?

2384
02:04:13,730 --> 02:04:16,020
Since when did the
manager become a doctor?

2385
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,650
You?

2386
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:42,980
Rascal.

2387
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:54,190
He's still alive.

2388
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:35,850
It's hot.

2389
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:40,440
Not the iron. Not the iron.

2390
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:42,900
Trying to frame me.

2391
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:46,440
- Not the iron. Not the iron.
- Come on.

2392
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,270
Close it.

2393
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:53,520
Who the hell are you?

2394
02:05:53,650 --> 02:05:55,850
- Nurse Kareena.
- Gyno Karisma.

2395
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:59,560
We changed getup at home.

2396
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:03,350
"Singapore nurses. Singapore nurses."

2397
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:06,980
Let's go.
You're the one always singing.

2398
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,600
Let's go.

2399
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,350
There he is.

2400
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:19,900
Move.

2401
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:21,270
Move.

2402
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:49,190
Are you okay?

2403
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:52,560
Did you forgive me?

2404
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:54,650
I've only one husband.

2405
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:57,480
My Raju.

2406
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:00,650
I'll always be this one.

2407
02:07:01,150 --> 02:07:06,850
Now hold your ears and
promise that you'll never lie to me.

2408
02:07:08,150 --> 02:07:09,600
I'll never lie again.

2409
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,270
Never.

2410
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:22,730
Sir...

2411
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:27,690
Help. Help, please.

2412
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:30,520
Help. Help, please.

2413
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:31,480
Help!

2414
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:33,560
Help!

2415
02:07:37,230 --> 02:07:39,190
Come on. Come on, guys.

2416
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:42,520
Come on. Come on, guys.

2417
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:45,650
Raju's coming.

2418
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,650
Come on. Come on, guys.

2419
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:54,650
Help! Help!

2420
02:07:54,730 --> 02:07:57,190
Give me a hand. Come on. Come on.

2421
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,940
Help, please!

2422
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:03,980
Rozario.

2423
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:06,600
Trying to stick me
now you're stuck yourself.

2424
02:08:06,690 --> 02:08:08,480
Help!
Help!

2425
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:11,480
Fine, now Coolies are going to save you.

2426
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:13,560
Help me up.
He's my wife's father.

2427
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:15,350
Careful, Raju.

2428
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:17,190
Careful.

2429
02:08:18,650 --> 02:08:19,270
Give me a hand.

2430
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:22,400
Rozario, I love your daughter.

2431
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:26,100
Just say once that Raju
Coolie is your real son-in-law.

2432
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:27,690
No! I won't say it.

2433
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:29,190
- You won't say it.
- I'll never say it.

2434
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:31,230
- Never.
- I swear...

2435
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:32,310
Okay then...

2436
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:33,900
Heaven in the dock, man.

2437
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:36,100
You'll die and go
in the coffin box, man.

2438
02:08:36,230 --> 02:08:36,770
I am going.

2439
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:40,020
No! No! No! I'll say it.

2440
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:41,730
Raju Coolie is my son-in-law.

2441
02:08:41,850 --> 02:08:43,520
And always will be.

2442
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:46,690
Jump.

2443
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:49,100
Yes, jump.

2444
02:08:49,230 --> 02:08:51,480
If I jump I'll go straight to heaven.
Help!

2445
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:54,690
Just jump. Just say Jai Hind,
Jai Maharashtra and jump.

2446
02:08:54,850 --> 02:08:56,690
Jai Hind...

2447
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:58,650
Father-in-law.

2448
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,900
My leg...

2449
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:06,270
My leg's broken.

2450
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:08,350
That's my leg, not yours.
Leave it.

2451
02:09:09,810 --> 02:09:11,810
My leg's okay. My leg's okay.

2452
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:12,850
Here's my other leg.

2453
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:14,850
Stop laughing after
all this coolie huddle.

2454
02:09:15,190 --> 02:09:16,600
Why are they all lying down?

2455
02:09:16,690 --> 02:09:18,020
Is the train late?

2456
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:19,440
- You're late.
- Is the train late?

2457
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:23,650
Rozario, I've forgiven Raju.

2458
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:25,690
You should forgive him too.

2459
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:27,350
Forgive? Him?

2460
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:31,230
I will never forgive him...period!

2461
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:35,350
You accepted him after
seeing my bungalow.

2462
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:38,060
Then now that bungalow is his.

2463
02:09:38,190 --> 02:09:41,690
No. Sarah is all I want, that's it.

2464
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:44,060
Don't say no. He's giving it for free.

2465
02:09:44,190 --> 02:09:44,900
We'll rent it out.

2466
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:46,940
Daddy...what are you saying?

2467
02:09:47,190 --> 02:09:49,850
My son tried to kill me.

2468
02:09:50,690 --> 02:09:52,060
But Raju saved my life.

2469
02:09:52,190 --> 02:09:52,810
I did.

2470
02:09:53,150 --> 02:09:54,850
Now he's my son.

2471
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,350
He cheated me twice.

2472
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:00,600
He ruined my other daughter Anju's life.

2473
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:04,600
Daddy...I am responsible for that.

2474
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:06,100
Since when did I become your daddy?

2475
02:10:06,230 --> 02:10:10,270
Greedy daddy,
please forgive him as you forgave me.

2476
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,310
- Just forgive them, daddy.
- Why?

2477
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:13,650
Because they love each other.

2478
02:10:13,730 --> 02:10:14,190
Love.

2479
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:15,020
Love?

2480
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:18,230
When did your story begin?

2481
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:20,850
A man like you deserves
an ending like this.

2482
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:26,690
A son-in-law who charters an airplane
to buy groceries.

2483
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:29,850
If a country wants to borrow money,
they should ask him.

2484
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:30,850
Wait a minute.

2485
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:34,350
I said these words
to that agent Jai Kishen.

2486
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:35,440
How do you know?

2487
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:37,810
Because he's Pandit Jai Kishen,
