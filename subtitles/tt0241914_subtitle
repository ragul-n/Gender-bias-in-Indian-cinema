1
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Salim Pasha

2
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,866
People call me
Salim Langda (the Lame)

3
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:14,736
They're right too! Because

4
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:17,938
..to be frank there's
something special about my gait.

5
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:19,879
There're many Salims around.

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,413
Four under every
stone you overturn!

7
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:25,620
Salim Checkak.. Salim Kanya..
Salim Tempo, Slim Honda!

8
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,753
You can take this as
my self-portrait..

Salim Langda

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,491
My own True Life Story!

11
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:39,761
Spiced up a bit here
and there, of course.

12
00:00:55,985 --> 00:00:58,613
It's not opening.
- Try harder.

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,888
Come on, hurry up.
- Get the stuff.

14
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:05,290
Salim, run. Abdul.

15
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,423
Salim.

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,427
Don't worry.

17
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:15,200
Rajan.

18
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:25,475
Langda! Don't you
know you're trespassing!

19
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:28,745
Look Rajan, these goods are mine!

20
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:32,685
Loot that crosses into
my area is mine! Get it!

21
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,647
You'll regret it

22
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,323
Are you trying to scare me?

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,890
I'll give you such a thrashing..

24
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:42,862
..you'll cry for Grandma!

25
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,524
Let's go

26
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,701
Let him go, after all..

27
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:55,500
every dog thinks he's his domain.

28
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:58,406
Get lost Langda! Or..

29
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:02,141
..you'll lose the other leg too!

30
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:08,551
Pick up the stuff. Pick it up.
- Move..

31
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:18,630
I will deal with you.

32
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,804
This is your area, after all.
- The rascal.

33
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,729
Are you heart?
- No.

34
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,543
The rascal.
- Let him come in our area..

35
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:58,636
DON'T SHED A TEAR FOR SALIM LANGDA

36
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:47,213
This is my father

37
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,509
Worked in a textile mill

38
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,086
There was a country
- wide strike

39
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,546
The milll re-opened

40
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:56,648
But they didn't take him back

41
00:04:57,927 --> 00:05:00,452
25 years he spent in
back breaking work..

42
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,622
And it took just one
minute to throw him out!

43
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:06,830
Just like that.

44
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,180
This is my mother,
she's very lovable

45
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,948
A mother, after all..

46
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,814
She takes in
stitching from the neighbour

47
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,883
Earns a little extra for the home

48
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:35,559
Has spent her whole life, working,
working, working..

49
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,458
..Not a moment of rest

50
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:44,263
And this quiet one
is my little sister

51
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,370
Anees, the baby of the house

52
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:51,269
Has nothing
- save her family's love.

53
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:55,943
But one day I'll see she
has everything. Everything

54
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,448
Javed is my brother was

55
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,186
He was a factory electrician

56
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:09,258
A 440 Volt-Shock killed him

57
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:17,100
Hello.

58

..call Peera my right hand

60
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,478
Nothing scares
him-but a flash of my eyes

61
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:29,709
The goggles were
inspired by some English film

62
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:31,979
Sometimes, he sports
them at night too!

63
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:34,720
And Abdul He's like my shadow

64
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:38,150
Still a boy, but
'solid' I can vouch for that

65
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:44,697
This is Rafiq bhai's
restaurant our - hangout

66
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,798
And this is Rafiaqh bhai.
A man who says little..

67
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,835
..but knows everything.
Wedded to his work

68
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,234
That's why everyone respects him.

69
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:56,471
No. its not ready yet.

70
00:06:56,545 --> 00:07:00,675
And this is Vilas Nakashe. His
business is bootlegging and gambling

71
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,844
A loner

72
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:06,521
A good friend

73
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:07,714
Goodbye.

74
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:10,518
but as an enemy Deadly!

75
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:14,129
And that one in between..

76
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:16,061
They call him 'Lala'

77
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,157
Owns a jewellery shop..

78
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:22,699
..but his real
business is stolen goods

79
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:26,238
Don't be scared, this is common.

80
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,673
This is Nathu Seth

81
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,902
We finally got hold of him.

82
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:32,879
Runs brothels and gambling dens

83
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,650
He's a hothead

84
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,351
Enter Ibrahim Malbari!
The Silver King!

00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:46,793
A smuggler

Soared from the
gutters to the skies

87
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,333
Politicians, film-stars,
wealthy folk - all know him

88
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:07,639
And this is my special friend
- Johan

89

Where he came from no one knows
- England, USA, Paris..

93
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,432
No one knows.

94
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,736
The one thing that has eluded me..

95
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,780
..is what they call 'Love''

96
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:45,311
But if any one
person has won my heart..

97
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:47,916
..it is this woman..

98
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,918
She is right here.

99
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,422
Mumtaz.

100
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:57,760
Someone stole up silently

101
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,360
Put his arms around

102
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:07,265

Sir, sir, sir, let him go.

111
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,535

00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,477
Constable.

114
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:49,983
He will never reform.

115
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:53,681
Hello, sir. How are you?
- Hello.

116
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:55,086
Hello.

117
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:57,388
This is our Police Station.

118
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:00,789
Where I must show my face everyday

119
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:04,960
In fact, only recently
I've been let out of jail

120
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:09,034
The police warn me
to stay out of trouble

121
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,733

And to whom? Him.

125
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:21,744
You lie.

126
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,143
I didn't pick any pocket. Sir.

127
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:26,085
Rascal, you dare pick pockets.

128
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:28,183
Take him away.
- Okay, sir.

129

Hello. - You dare speak
to sir in a raised voice.

No trouble, I hope?
- No, sir.

Twice in jail is enough!
I'm fed up of prison food

There were riots in Bhiwandi

182
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:15,079
Some people got killed.
- Muslims?

183
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:17,557
Give me a omelets.

184
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,116
Hindus and Muslims

185
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,622
If anyone shows off here,
we'll tear them apart

186
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:24,061
Shut up, you imbecile.

187
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,803
What's happened to Rafiqbhai?
- Fine, right away.

188
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:30,531
But why do riots
happen in the first place?

189
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,733
Bugger that! Riots here..

190
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,776
And we'll be wiped out
a lesson one and all

191
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:40,348
They act the police side
with them, they can show off!

192
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:43,149
Forget it! Listen..

193
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:46,819
..there's a big haul to be made

194
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:51,851
But police are all around?
- Arre, leave them to me

195
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:55,295
Come on, unnecessarily..

196
00:13:55,497 --> 00:13:56,862
God be with you

197
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:58,092
See you.

198
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,996
So, is everything fine?

199
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,097
Salim.

200
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:05,873
Salim, you went to the
Police Station the day before?

201
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:08,635
Yes, I..

202
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,476
..have to report to them.
- Only to report.

203
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:13,373
Yes. Something special?

204
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:15,244
Get me tea as well.

205
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:18,379
No, nothing.

206
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,817
See you.

207
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,262
Can't you see
- Don't monkey with my bonnet

208
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:32,399
Consider yourself lucky
we didn't bash you up!

209
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,935
Mind your language.

210
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,298
Do you own the road?

211
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:37,598
What did I say?

212
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:38,798
Come on.
- Now leave.

213
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:40,569
I am going. Mind your own business.

214
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,504
Leave.
- I am going.

215
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:48,706
Come on, quickly.
- Wait.

216
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,182
My mother.

217
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,226
Going out brother?
- Yes.. why?

218
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:09,093
Don't go. They say
there's going to be trouble

219
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:13,441
Stupid! Can any harm
come to your brother?

220
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:16,238
Can't you spend one day at home?

221
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:19,478
Ammi, you worry needlessly
Nothing's going to happen

222
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,842
Do you think
they're so crazy as to..

223
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,316
..stir up trouble in our area?

224
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:26,882
Our area?

225
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,554
Their area?

226
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,116
Swines! Now
everyone's area mapped out?

227
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:36,157
Listen to your father! - Don't
worry, we're ready for anything

228
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:39,927
Ready for anything?

229
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:45,434
Ready with knives?
ready with daggers?

230
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:50,138
Is this what you've learnt?
How to use guns and knives?

231
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:53,008
For God's sake, no
fighting in this house, Go inside!

232
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:55,912
Enough Ammi! It's time
we settled matters..

233
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,378
..once and for all!

234
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,578
Listen! Why didn't I go to
school like my brother Javed?

235
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,750
You know well enough why!

236
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,359
At six I learnt how to
elbow my way thru the allies!

237
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:10,059
Had enough of what
you call education

238
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:11,393
Brother.

239
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:15,101
Education? With street ruffians
as teachers, I know? - Be quiet.

240
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:19,801
Yes Abbu, the street
has taught me a lot

241
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:23,034
Taught me how the
uneducated must wield there..

242
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:24,510
..brains to make it in this world!

243
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:27,181
Taught me: if you
admit you're a Mulsim..

244
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:28,772
..you won't get a job

245
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,545
If not one trusts you,
how can you survive?

246
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,957
I learn how to fight my
way ahead, inch by inch..

247
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,287
..and you're teaching me?

248
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,554
Brother.

249
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:50,666
You're a kid, what do you
know of the world outside?

250
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,100
Arre, they won't let pass
a paise's worth of mistake!

251
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:58,642
If there's trouble here..

252
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:01,111
..only those ruffians can save us.

253
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:03,114
Because only they
brave the battlefield.

254
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:05,948
Nonsense.

255
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,052
Brother.

256
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:15,456
Come on.

257
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,300
Salim, why are you
getting so angry?

258
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,193
Did I say anything wrong?

259
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:25,700
No..

260
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:42,916
Atom bomb.

261
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:44,818
Atom bomb.

262
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,267
Hiroshima.

263
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,170
Jani, what is this 'Hiroshima'?

264
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:08,642
It's a town where a small bomb..

265
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,618
..sent up half a million people..

266
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,915
..in a cloud of smoke

267
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,554
With just one bomb.

268
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:19,086
With bomb.

269
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:25,129
But why did you suddenly
remember this Hiroshima?

270
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:28,796
Because we have not
learnt from Hiroshima

271
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,697
Learnt what?

272
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,438
The value of human life

273
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,281
The value of human life

274
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,352
Attack! Murder! Riot!

275
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:56,057
Attack! Murder! Riot!

276
00:18:57,265 --> 00:19:00,564
Attack! Murder! Riot!

277
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,113
Enough talk of hatred friend..

278
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:18,015
..let's talk of love instead

279
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:23,288
What news of your Mumtaz?

280
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:30,060
How's it going with your Mumtaz,
Emperor Shahjehan?

281
00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:34,426
Bastard! He's calling me Shahjehan!

282
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:47,178
Come on.

283
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,487
Slowly. Slowly.

284
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:00,854
Come on.

285
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:03,897
Follow me.

286
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:14,974
Hurry up. Come on.

287
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,102
Hurry up.

288
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,122
Salim, did you find anything.

289
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:33,159
Salim, this one.

290
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,525
We are here only for this.

291
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,300
I will take this one.

292
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,544
Come on, hurry up.

293
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:57,044
Hurry up. Hold this.

294
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:03,519
Get down.

295
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,063
Take it upstairs.

296
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,435
Hurry up.

297
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:18,668
Count it.

298
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,173
It's okay.

299
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,537
We are leaving.
- Okay.

300
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:26,878
Hello.

301
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:31,346
I will beat you.

302
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,780
Hello, Vilas. How are you?

303
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:38,155
I am fine.

304
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,691
How're you?
- Fine!

305
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:46,830
How much have you made Salim?
- Which job do you mean?

306
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:48,528
Gokuldas, godown..

307
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:51,569
No, no
- someone told you wrong

308
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,075
Trying to make a fool of me?

309
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:59,746
No great deal! Made
enough to scrape by..

310
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:04,878
We're expecting a good
consignment next week..

311
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,878
Steal it.
- We're always at your service -

312
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,587
I am leaving.
- Kebabs.

313
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:11,989
No.
- Okay.

314
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:17,691
I like Vilas.
- Me too.

315
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:19,663
Serve us kebabs.

316
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,834
I am full, now what next.

317
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:30,139
How are you? Business doing well?

318
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:34,706
Peera. I am borrowing
these glasses. - Hold him.

319
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:38,946
You are done for.
- Don't touch it.

320
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:45,318
Salim. Police informer.

321
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:47,493
You rascal..
- Why you?

322
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,424
Leave me.
- No, don't go Rajan.

323
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:57,161
Hey, you sneaked on me, isn't it?

324
00:22:57,505 --> 00:23:02,408
That day you beat me
up with your sycophants.

325
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:07,747
Get away you bastard!
Or I'll carve you up!

326
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:10,884
Rascal.

327
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:14,716
You dare threaten me?
Beat it. You drunken scum!

328
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:16,590
Get lost.

329
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,194
But he informed on me..

330
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:25,892
Your head's screwed
on wrong Take him away

331
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,399
Rajan, let's go inside.

332
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:29,402
I'll see you suffer in hell Langda!

333
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:32,229
Even if it takes forever!

334
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,276
Get lost or I won't spare you.

335
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:39,379
There's no place on
earth you'll be safe from me

336
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,777
Come on, Rajan.

337
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:51,257
Salim.

338
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:55,886
People come here to
loosen up, to enjoy themselves

339
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:00,790
They don't like to
be hassled in any way

340
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:02,768
Did I trouble anyone?

341
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:09,037
Tell me.. I am all ears

342
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:10,905
Then hear this!

343
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,874
Try getting it
into your vacant head

344
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,341
I don't want any police here..

345
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,716
..nor any hoodlums!

346
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:22,720
Understand.

347
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:25,624
This place is out of bounds for you

348
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:38,266
Go inside.

349
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:42,739
Rajan will pay for this

350
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:44,505
Once I lay hands on that swine,
he'll sober up..

351
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:45,841
..for the rest of his life!

352
00:24:45,913 --> 00:24:48,108
Hey. Listen to me.

353
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:50,214
We're done for.

354
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,518
Don't be scared, Abdul.

355
00:24:52,587 --> 00:24:53,918
Hello, sir. How are you?

356
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:57,049
Who are you?

357
00:24:57,158 --> 00:24:59,956
What Nigam Saheb,
have you forgotten us?

358
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:04,396
Swines! You know under Sec.
144 you can't roam..

359
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:07,363
..around in groups.
Want to start a riot?

360
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,266
No sir, you've enough

361
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:16,705
Shut up! Or you'll be
holding your teeth in your palm

362
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:18,208
Bloody bastards!

363
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:23,749
What are you gaping at?
- Nothing. Just looking around

364
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,045
Check him

365
00:25:26,154 --> 00:25:29,351
Salim. - Let him go, Sir. Just
a kid. go on, salute the Saheb

366
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:30,717
Come on, get going.

367
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:34,818
OK, scram! And take that
brat with you! Bloody swine!

368
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:37,296
Rascals.

369
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:40,258
What a day!
Inauspicious from the start

370
00:25:42,203 --> 00:25:46,299
Salim, sometimes I think..
- Think what?

371
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:49,539
We'll spend our whole
lives swallowing their abuses?

372
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:54,343
If luck just favours us once
- our lives'll light up!

373
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:57,513
Like Ibrahimbhai.. or Nathu Seth

374
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:00,185
What style! What confidence!

375
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:04,349
Even the police wag
their tails for them

376
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,157
That's okay but still..

377
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:10,459
Arre, both of them
were no different from us

378
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,165
Nothing to begin with!
Empty-handed!

379
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:16,964
Now they're sitting
pretty at the top!

380
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,474
Abdul, our turn will
come Just you wait!

381
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:22,041
Understand.
- I assure you.

382
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:32,509
Things seem to have
cooled down in our area

383
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:37,146
They've lifted the restrictions

384
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:42,055
It's business as usual
for public and police

385
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:46,298
We even celebrated 'Id' in style!

386
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:49,264
What a crowd!

387
00:26:50,738 --> 00:26:54,265
To tell the truth, I made
full use of the opportunity!

388
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:10,446
Come close. Even in the Family
Room, you want to sit so far?

389
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:14,391
What are you doing
- This is English style!

390
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:16,589
Not for me!

391
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:19,456
Then we could as well
had faloodas downstairs

392
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:26,200
Sorry.

393
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:46,817
Oho, why don't you
make conversation?

394
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:49,088
You talk
- I'll listen

395
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,634
You really love me?

396
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:56,793
When do you give me
the chance to love you?

397
00:27:58,306 --> 00:28:00,570
What's happened?
- My ring!

398
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,007
You didn't tell me..
- What?

399
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:09,512
Whether you really love me..

400
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:15,480
I love you a lot.

401
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:17,751
I will make a Taj
Mahal for my Mumtaz.

402
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,558
What are you doing?

403
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:24,621
What is this? Wait. I told you not to
wear all this when you go out with me.

404
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,501
Who's that?

405
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,441
Your kin.
- Hey you.

406
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:37,067
Your falooda will become cold

407
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,775
Who comes here for falooda?
- Then why don they come?

408
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:42,439
Shall I show you?

409
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,279
Salim.

410
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,467
Hello.
- Hello.

411
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:09,107
Hello, father.
- Hello.

412
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:23,354
Any good news?

413
00:29:25,192 --> 00:29:28,719
They said, come back in 10 days

414
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:30,127
Hello,. Father.

415
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:31,926
Then they must have decided

416
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,033
Yes, let's see.

417
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:39,239
They'll take you.

418
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,034
I am praying for you!

419
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:47,239
Prayers? For what?

420
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:50,980
Your Abbu has applied for a job

421
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:52,711
Where?

422
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:55,585
There's a vacancy
for a factory watchman

423
00:29:56,157 --> 00:30:01,789
Great news!

424
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:08,731
Abbu, I'm sorry I
shouted the other day

425
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:12,105
It's okay

426
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,705
You're sure to get this job, Abbu

427
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:24,779
It's time to think of
getting Anees married

428
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:28,380
She's just kid

429
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:31,948
Not anymore. She's
of marriageable age

430
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:36,018
There's a good boy in
the neighbourhood - Aslam

431
00:30:36,263 --> 00:30:38,060
Who?
- Aslam Ahmed

432
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,228
A good boy

433
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,747
You know him then?

434
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,183
You meet him on the sly?

435
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:08,421
O brother! I've only
seen him passing by

436
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:12,062
What do you think of him?

437
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:19,195
Nothing.. people say he is nice

438
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:22,733
People say! What
do you have to say?

439
00:31:25,713 --> 00:31:28,307
I'll have to see
this nice man for myself

440
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:31,551
I too have duties as your brother..

441
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,111
I'll go meet him

442
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:39,449
If you like him, we'll fix
the engagement next month

443
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,897
Shall I go then?
- Today?

444
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:46,261
If you say so, this very moment

445
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:49,366
I will see him soon.

446
00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:02,641
I promised Annes to meet Aslam

447
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:07,517
So I went to see him.
As unusual meeting

448
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:09,756
An unusual man he turned out to be!

449
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:29,969
Salaam, Aslam bhai

450
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:35,544
Wel-e-qum Salaam, Salim Mia

451
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,008
You're well?

452
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,587
I have tried to meet you
several times - even at your home.

453
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:48,088
In my work, I have
to move about a lot

454
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:50,587
The job's like that

455
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:56,965
What work do you do Aslam bhai?

456
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:01,136
I proof-read in a newspaper
- What's that?

457
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:05,802
I correct others mistakes

458
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:08,081
Tremendous!

459
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:14,145
And all these heavy books
- They're yours?

460
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:17,088
Yes.
- You've read all of them?

461
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:18,556
Take a seat.

462
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:30,931
What salary do you get?

463
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:33,832
600 Rupees

464
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:37,106
That's all?

465
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:41,806
I make a couple of
hundreds over that

466
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:45,615
But you've graduated

467
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:49,554
Yes. M.A.

468
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,323
Such an educated gentleman
should surely draw more!

469
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,422
Not necessarily

470
00:33:57,498 --> 00:34:00,023
I did my M. A. in the Urdu medium

471
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:04,300
It's not easy getting work

472
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:06,132
Why's that?

473
00:34:07,508 --> 00:34:10,534
Today no one uses
the Urdu language much

474
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:15,178
Your salary will be Rs.
600 all your life?

475
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:21,281
Maybe. I don't know

476
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:24,990
But household expenses, clothes,
laundry, rent..

477
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,220
..how do you manage

478
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:31,460
One has to make do..

479
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,989
But it won't do for us!

480
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,801
Anees is my only sister

481
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:41,132
She must not lack any comforts

482
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,274
Okay.

483
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,514
She's your younger sister.

484
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:52,916
You must get her married to
whosoever you consider best.

485
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:56,052
What can I say

486
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,155
I'm sorry

487
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,367
But that's the way I feel

488
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:11,598
Don't Feel bad..

489
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:13,865
I understand.

490
00:35:15,442 --> 00:35:17,740
See you.

491
00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:19,670
Goodbye.

492
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:33,582
Are you serious about Aslam?

493
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:35,754
Why?

494
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:39,731
Arre, his salary is 600

495
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:44,395
People manage on that much

496
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:49,107
What did you say?

497
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:51,238
Do you know what you're saying?

498
00:35:52,346 --> 00:35:55,907
In this city, 600 is
nothing at all - nothing!

499
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:59,776
Why do I drive myself
like crazy? All for you!

500
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:05,552
Anees is our child too..

501
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,353
We want only her well-being

502
00:36:10,397 --> 00:36:13,855
That's right Abbu. But
let's get this straight..

503
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,794
Anees will not marry any pauper!

504
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:20,302
Maybe Salim is right..

505
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:25,645
But somehow I have a
feeling he will keep her happy

506
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:26,972
Mother..

507
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:37,788
Shell out the money.

508
00:36:40,494 --> 00:36:42,189
A new cupboard
- Yes.

509
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:44,025
Pay double next week
- Okay.

510
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:49,394
Get me tea.

511
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,401
Show me the shirt.
- How often must you be told?

512
00:36:51,638 --> 00:36:52,832
Sorry, I didn't see you Bhai

513
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,373
Hurry up
- no time to waste

514
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:55,874
What goods do you keep?

515
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:58,834
I was working.
- ''Working.'' As if..

516
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:00,504
I will come and
collect the money tomorrow,

517
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:03,082
What about that one?
- Let him go

518
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,412
Get me tea.

519
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,918
Abdul, I told you.

520
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:07,111
Understood.

521
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:09,249
What are you staring at?

522
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,786
You met Aslam that day?
What happened?

523
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:15,259
No use at all: he's a pauper

524
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:18,229
Whatever you may say
people respect him

525
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:21,992
To hell with respect! Hard
cash is what we're after

526
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:23,593
Shell out the money.
- Hello.

527
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:30,142
Come on, rush it! Don't
have the whole day for you

528
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,136
Rascal.
- Sit down.

529
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:36,709
One hand extracts money
the other pushes you around!

530
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:39,317
What did you say?
- Forgive me!

531
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:41,616
You are growing very audacious.

532
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:44,584
Want one? Get back to work.

533
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,152
Abdul, get me..

534
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:54,028
Hands off, Abdul. It's rush hour

535
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:56,296
Our three heroes!
- How's business?

536
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:59,270
We're busy, Vilasbhai
but of business, no sign!

537
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,970
Give them some work..

538
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,703
..whole day they harass me

539
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:09,039
Our stories don't click
with this fellow - let's go

540
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:12,975
Make a betel leaf.
- Yes.

541
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:17,049
Oh..

542
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:23,790
Allah!

543
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,629
What's all this Vilasbhai?
- Nothing

544
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,500
Sit.

545
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:38,200
Give Salim a paan
(betel leaf) Sweeten it up!

546
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:43,276
But who was that bugger?

547
00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:46,517
We won't leave him alive

548
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,717
You're not his target
- I am

549
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:52,956
Vilas, are you fine?
- Yes.

550
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,186
I am fine.

551
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:59,791
Bad shot, that's all..
I'll settle any damages

552
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:03,325
His aim may be bad
but your luck is good!

553
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,738
You have somebody's blessings..

554
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:10,040
Arre Rafiqbhai, I too have my fans!

555
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:12,303
What happened next is..
- What happened?

556
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:14,277
What happened.

557
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:19,215
One bullet zipped by Salim's ear!

558
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:22,678
I was shit scared!

559
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:24,724
Are you a girl or what?

560
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:26,650
Men don't get scared.

561
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,955
Was Salim afraid?

562
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:31,622
Has the courage of a lion!
He saved Vilasbhai

563
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:35,498
Peera, now we're big shots!

564
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:36,694
Why?

565
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:38,828
They don't use big
guns on small fry

566
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:43,707
Now knives shives won't do.
We need machine guns!

567
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,040
Finish a crowd at one go!

568
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:13,734
So you've come?
- Am I late?

569
00:40:14,074 --> 00:40:15,769
Then why tell me to come urgently?

570
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:19,679
What happened yesterday?
You were in a fight?

571
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,972
You didn't get hurt? Why
don't you say something?

572
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,983
What can happen to me?

573
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:27,549
They were gunning for Vilasbhai

574
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:30,450
The public thought they're after
me. Why tell them differently?

575
00:40:31,158 --> 00:40:34,855
Wah! And so you became a hero!

576
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:37,622
You won't understand.
It's all good for business!

577
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:40,489
Pay off that taxi-driver

578
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:43,434
No, I'm in a hurry..

579
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:46,939
Going already? Why'd you
come in the first place?

580
00:40:47,007 --> 00:40:50,204
I came to see you
- Then stay

581
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:56,408
I have to go. I've work to do..

582
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:59,818
Work? What kind of work is that?

583
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,382
Paint your lips, bell your ankles,

584
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:02,785
..wiggle your hips for the public!

585
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:05,551
Call that? Work?
You work very hard!

586
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:07,023
Why don't you understand?

587
00:41:07,394 --> 00:41:11,660
You may not like it
but for me, it's work

588
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:16,258
Then go! Or you'll
shatter your fan's hearts!

589
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:17,803
Go on
- get lost!

590
00:41:18,705 --> 00:41:23,574
What kind of talk is that?
Yet you say you love me..

591
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:27,277
Okay, I'm leaving

592
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:28,473
I..

593
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:34,577
Take care of yourself, Khuda Hafiz

594
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:51,903
What lucky kids!

595
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:53,965
Rich family.

596
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:58,810
They've got everything

597
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:02,172
And daddy takes care of the bills

598
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,584
Sometimes I feel like
bashing their heads in!

599
00:42:08,822 --> 00:42:12,690
Back off Salim.
That's 'No Entry' for you!

600
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:14,654
Let's return to where we belong

601
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:16,687
Hey you, come out.

602
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:19,732
And when I did, I
met the poor intellect

603
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:22,334
'And what a meeting it was.'

604
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:27,565
Come on out, you!

605
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:31,369
What's holding you up..
Show us your face!

606
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:33,470
Blasphemer!

607
00:42:33,547 --> 00:42:35,208
If you're a man, show yourself

608
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:39,518
Why this violence?
How have I harmed you?

609
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:43,384
By spreading havoc, that's how
- But what have I done

610
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:47,655
More than enough! Telling
our girls to go to college!

611
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:50,260
So what's wrong with that?
- It's against our faith!

612
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,293
Do you know what
goes on in colleges?

613
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:54,159
You're shameless!

614
00:42:54,835 --> 00:42:57,235
Want to ruin our women folk!

615
00:42:57,637 --> 00:42:59,070
Is this what Islam has taught you?

616
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,533
I can see what it has taught you!

617
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:05,640
Islam is not against progress!
It is not against education

618
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:07,279
Has the nerve to argue

619
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:09,646
Beat him. Don't spare him.

620
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:13,019
You cannot change
my way of thinking.

621
00:43:13,787 --> 00:43:14,947
Wait..

622
00:43:15,956 --> 00:43:18,083
What are you doing?
Attacking a brother!

623
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:21,753
Not our brother, he's our enemy!
An enemy of the faith!

624
00:43:22,162 --> 00:43:27,794
No lauding it around
here Aslam, you go up

625
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:29,927
No Salim I can handle them

626
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:34,166
What can you do? Go on
- go upstairs

627
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,771
You fellow want a fight?

628
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:45,585
Talk to me..
- You'll do

629
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,651
What you say? Do you
know who you're talking to?

630
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:55,860
One slash - and you'll
remember me daily in the loo!

631
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:59,126
You think you can bully us?

632
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:04,563
Piss off
- or your days are numbered!

633
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:27,653
There is a limit to stupidity

634
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:32,624
Strange.

635
00:44:37,003 --> 00:44:38,095
Illiterate people.

636
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:42,330
They think women are
whores or ornaments

637
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:46,769
Hypocrites behind veil of virtue

638
00:44:48,982 --> 00:44:51,815
What sparked it off?

639
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:58,051
The fact that those
people cannot face the truth

640
00:45:02,796 --> 00:45:04,388
Why are you
getting angry with them?

641
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:06,128
Aren't you also at fault

642
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:08,759
Haven't you urged Muslim
girls to go to colleges?

643
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:10,864
Why do you go against our religion?

644
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:19,307
Who told you that
it's against Islam?

645
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:25,684
I don't know. That's
what they were saying

646
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:30,682
There's a saying: ''It's easy
to make fools of the ignorant

647
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,195
But they won't understand that

648
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:41,292
What's wrong with people?

649
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:43,267
Which people?

650
00:45:45,238 --> 00:45:50,574
You, me and all other Muslims

651
00:45:55,882 --> 00:45:57,747
Those good for nothing
who've sprung from the gutters..

652
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:01,843
..like vermin to live
and die there futilely

653
00:46:02,689 --> 00:46:04,384
A poor Muslim
- What else can he do?

654
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:15,829
Educate himself

655
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:19,597
Try and do something

656
00:46:21,107 --> 00:46:23,007
Sounds very good brother..

657
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,677
But out there, it's quite different

658
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:31,273
Out there, people hate Muslims

659
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:37,423
Why treat us like dirt?
Why terrorize us?

660
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:40,421
Why say they want us wiped out?

661
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:44,020
You tell me why?

662
00:46:57,143 --> 00:46:58,269
Yes.

663
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:05,046
I know what is going on

664
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:09,983
I can understand their fears

665
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,357
But for how long can they
live on fear and illusions?

666
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,192
Why don't they understand that
India that is as much theirs

667
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:24,634
..as everyone else's?

668
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:35,874
But no.

669
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:41,913
They've grown
accustomed to the dark

670
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:49,193
If only they try a
little they can come into foe

671
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,508
Will you have tea?

672
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,680
Anything's fine.

673
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:27,226
Aslam bhai, why do you
want to marry Anees?

674
00:48:29,602 --> 00:48:31,194
Because I like her

675
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:37,075
And because she's my
friend Javed's sister

676
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:47,777
You knew Javed?

677
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:51,516
Yes

678
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,822
What was he like?

679
00:48:56,963 --> 00:48:58,794
He was your brother.
Didn't you know him?

680
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,233
He never had time to talk to me

681
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:09,199
He spend his whole day studying

682
00:49:10,844 --> 00:49:12,402
No time for anything else

683
00:49:15,014 --> 00:49:20,577
Javed was made of steel

684
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:24,151
Had a very strong character

685
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:29,787
All these bullies
that roam the streets..

686
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:33,095
..would seem like mice before him!

687
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:36,799
Meaning?

688
00:49:37,403 --> 00:49:38,768
Meaning.

689
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:46,511
Meaning that it's child's
play to become a hoodlum here

690
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,649
Takes a flick of your
fingers to gather a following

691
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:57,716
What's difficult is to
survive with dignity.

692
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:03,360
Javed was trying to do that

693
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:09,195
He waged his own battle
for a better life, Salim.

694
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,034
He was an example to others

695
00:50:21,548 --> 00:50:23,345
After a long time,

696
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:28,253
I suddenly felt like praying

697
00:50:30,623 --> 00:50:32,523
I didn't know how to

698
00:50:34,928 --> 00:50:36,486
But I tried anyway

699
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:39,662
and to tell you the truth..

700
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,030
..I felt very good inside

701
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,271
Very good.

702
00:50:48,975 --> 00:50:51,205
Greek herb. Greek herb

703
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:53,643
Cures your stomach
ache and indigestion.

704
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:55,805
What are you saying?
- Famous all over India.

705
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:58,015
Hello, Acheh Miya.
- Go away.

706
00:50:58,117 --> 00:51:02,281
Our hero descends from the
horse some more betel nut

707
00:51:02,355 --> 00:51:03,481
Here
- then what happened?

708
00:51:03,556 --> 00:51:06,184
Then the hero says, Pish, pish..

709
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:09,086
Did you understand?

710
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:11,163
I don't think I understand
- Me too!

711
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,288
I said hello.

712
00:51:12,398 --> 00:51:15,458
Why do you want to
curdle my brains?

713
00:51:15,802 --> 00:51:17,702
Do you have brains
in the first place?

714
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:19,431
Why you.. catch him.

715
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,572
Ok. Where was I?

716
00:51:21,674 --> 00:51:24,700
The hero falling from the horse,
says in English..

717
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:29,771
It's Interval now! Time
for paan, tobacco, lemonade..

718
00:51:32,285 --> 00:51:34,719
Like everyday. I
got my betel leaf..

719
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:36,220
Why do you do this to him?

720
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:42,321
Hello.

721
00:51:42,996 --> 00:51:45,328
Hello.
- How are you, Rafiq?

722
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:49,557
How are you Vilas?
- Fine

723
00:51:49,669 --> 00:51:50,966
Get me tea.

724
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,162
Hello, Vilas.

725
00:51:52,372 --> 00:51:54,602
And how are our three young heroes?

726
00:51:54,707 --> 00:51:56,800
Fine. Whose number is up now?

727
00:51:57,143 --> 00:51:59,008
For him, look.

728
00:51:59,746 --> 00:52:01,145
Is it a special meeting?

729
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:03,080
Welcome.

730
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:04,643
Is everything fine?
- Yes.

731
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,043
So, Patil?

732
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:07,516
Rafiq.

733
00:52:07,987 --> 00:52:09,079
Hello.

734
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:11,953
See! Some real black magic at work!

735
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:15,153
This way. How did my
man get arrested, Patikl?

736
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:17,989
I wasn't there.

737
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:22,193
I told you, you weren't there.

738
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:23,931
You should have told me.
- I..

739
00:52:24,137 --> 00:52:27,106
The hand of the law
embracing the outlaw

740
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:36,074
Take sir along. .

741
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:39,843
Be there.

742
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:43,611
Rafiq, is everything fine?

743
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:46,257
It's the grace of Allah.
- Everything well.

744
00:52:46,693 --> 00:52:48,388
Black magic alright!

745
00:52:49,262 --> 00:52:52,095
He came in a local car.

746
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:55,228
And left in a imported one.

747
00:52:56,335 --> 00:52:58,929
Nabbed him! Trapped him in a bottle

748
00:53:01,507 --> 00:53:04,533
Bhai, what is our business?

749
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:07,937
To please one and all,
big and small

750
00:53:08,681 --> 00:53:12,048
A silver boot, each
according to his size

751
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,381
Well said, Seth

752
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:19,353
Sometimes you know I
think of retiring.

753
00:53:21,094 --> 00:53:22,220
But then, I think..

754
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:23,785
..if I do, what will happen
to all those poor workers..

755
00:53:24,697 --> 00:53:26,426
..who look up to me for sustenance?

756
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,528
Well thought, Seth!

757
00:53:29,902 --> 00:53:31,802
I don't know good or bad,
but I do think.

758
00:53:48,469 --> 00:53:53,771
Abbu, I had this
specially ironed for you

759
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:55,235
Really?

760
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:58,670
Thank you, keep it there

761
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:01,009
Now I'll get you some tea

762
00:54:04,819 --> 00:54:08,915
Brother, get up, get up.
You too have to go with Abbu

763
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,516
Why?

764
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:12,991
He applied for that job.
Don't you remember?

765
00:54:13,194 --> 00:54:17,130
He can't manage it alone. Hurry!

766
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:19,761
What time was he called?

767
00:54:22,837 --> 00:54:24,168
7 o'clock

768
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:28,334
Ok Abbu, I'm coming along

769
00:54:29,677 --> 00:54:34,114
It is okay, I'll go alone

770
00:54:34,215 --> 00:54:38,208
I said I'm coming Ready in a minute

771
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:39,952
Why the rush anyway?

772
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:45,492
Take him along. It will be good

773
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,287
Why trouble him? I'll got alone

774
00:54:57,872 --> 00:55:01,069
You don't understand Ammi.
Father is worried..

775
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:03,373
..of what people
will say if he's seen

776
00:55:03,644 --> 00:55:04,872
..with a street ruffian

777
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:09,509
I'm not my brother.

778
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:11,050
Shut your mouth

779
00:55:11,852 --> 00:55:16,585
The same old story day
after day! I'm tired..

780
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,152
Ameena.

781
00:55:19,393 --> 00:55:20,587
Ameena.

782
00:55:22,263 --> 00:55:26,791
Ameena, your daughter
is about to be engaged

783
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:30,162
Why shed tears at a
time for happiness?

784
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:33,537
Don't cry

785
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:37,437
Salim, hurry up

786
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:48,916
Father

787
00:55:50,925 --> 00:55:58,422
You feel we were
fonder of Javed, isn't it?

788
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,393
No.. I.. nothing

789
00:56:03,204 --> 00:56:04,671
I know that's what you feel.

790
00:56:06,107 --> 00:56:07,597
But it's not true

791
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:15,276
I wasn't earning enough to
send both of you to school

792
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,146
That is why Javed..

793
00:56:23,524 --> 00:56:28,552
I thought if he was educated
then started some business..

794
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:30,028
..then you to
would join him some day

795
00:56:34,101 --> 00:56:38,037
That is what I planned..
what can I say?

796
00:56:42,843 --> 00:56:45,812
It's alright Abbu.. I'll
hand around here for you

797
00:57:08,169 --> 00:57:10,467
Back so soon.. What happened?

798
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:18,505
Didn't get it.. I
knew this would happen

799
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,074
Why the..

800
00:57:21,315 --> 00:57:22,680
Salim, let's go.

801
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:30,950
Abbu, you have me, why
do you still look for work

802
00:57:31,692 --> 00:57:33,125
What harm is there in trying?

803
00:57:33,194 --> 00:57:34,661
Abbu..

804
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:40,029
And listen, don't
let your mother know..

805
00:57:42,236 --> 00:57:43,567
She'll be upset

806
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:46,566
One day she's bound to find out

807
00:57:48,642 --> 00:57:52,806
We'll think of it after
the engagement. Not now.

808
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:56,111
Are you coming
- No

809
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:58,409
You go, I will come later.

810
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,717
Okay.

811
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,325
Go carefully, father.

812
00:58:31,285 --> 00:58:36,313
Deal me some great
cards and see my luck turn!

813
00:58:36,724 --> 00:58:37,952
Great.

814
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:45,355
Go on, show your
cards Pay attention here

815
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:46,999
Queen
- Show me

816
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:48,996
Hurry up
- Two kings.

817
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:51,594
Two aces, it's mine.

818
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,970
Salim. They're showing
a film near our place

819
00:58:56,277 --> 00:58:57,972
Bugger the film

820
00:58:58,045 --> 00:58:59,808
What film are they showing?

821
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,277
On Bhiwandi

822
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:04,278
I've heard that name
- It's a hit film?

823
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:07,944
No
- like a newsreel

824
00:59:09,857 --> 00:59:13,088
On the riots in Bhiwandi?

825
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:18,492
What will they show?
Men being killed?

826
00:59:19,233 --> 00:59:21,030
Women and children suffering?

827
00:59:21,135 --> 00:59:22,727
Who watches that kind of film?

828
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:26,064
People want to see a
heroine wiggling her

829
00:59:28,843 --> 00:59:30,276
Rascal.

830
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:33,607
I'm going to see the film

831
00:59:37,418 --> 00:59:39,079
Bhiwandi Mumbai.

832
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:54,366
The riots spread
like fire thru the city

833
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:58,601
Not only in
Bhiwandi all thru Bombay

834
00:59:58,706 --> 01:00:01,402
A stranger fear gripped the people

835
01:00:02,276 --> 01:00:04,642
Terrorism reached such heights

836
01:00:04,745 --> 01:00:08,044
That the army had to be called in

837
01:00:09,316 --> 01:00:13,776
Behinds the scenes there
lucks a frightening truth

838
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:31,964
Weavers used to live here

839
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,442
8 to 10 persons to
a house. And now..

840
01:00:38,379 --> 01:00:40,609
This is not the first time

841
01:00:41,415 --> 01:00:45,476
Once before they were burnt

842
01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:48,811
But we put up our homes again.

843
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:56,860
Then no one came to our aid.
We are all labourers here

844
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,598
One by one we rebuilt our houses.

845
01:00:58,699 --> 01:01:00,997
In 15 minutes they turned to ashes.

846
01:01:01,302 --> 01:01:03,395
14 years of labor..

847
01:01:03,504 --> 01:01:07,531
..erased in 15 minutes

848
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:11,402
And today when we see each
house it breaks our heart.

849
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:13,036
Brings tears to in our eyes

850
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,842
Tell me.. we will have to work
hard for another 15 years, isn't it?

851
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,049
I had a nice family.

852
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:24,750
Later..

853
01:01:24,925 --> 01:01:29,419
They beat us up.

854
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:35,930
My 11 year old daughter, they..

855
01:01:36,303 --> 01:01:38,601
An uneasy silence filled the city

856
01:01:38,706 --> 01:01:41,834
Such massacre.

857
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:47,738
humanity is one and yet divided

858
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:54,852
When religious enmity explodes,
who benefits?

859
01:01:56,156 --> 01:01:59,216
If there's no conflict between
ordinary Hindus and Muslims..

860
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,926
..then who provokes the riots?

861
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:07,757
Who add the fuel of
enmity to the fire?

862
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:16,276
Friends, my group
made this film so that..

863
01:02:16,777 --> 01:02:19,245
..everyone
realises what is going on

864
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:22,506
We get the point but..

865
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,847
..still why this
senseless violence?

866
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:28,145
Swines! We'll kill them one and all

867
01:02:28,255 --> 01:02:31,691
Yes, kill, kill! That's
exactly what they want

868
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:34,751
What do they gain by all this?

869
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:36,921
So that people caught up
in religious quarrels..

870
01:02:37,131 --> 01:02:39,031
Will have no time to
question or think!

871
01:02:43,137 --> 01:02:46,800
You labour night and day, yet
your stomachs are not full..

872
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:51,202
Why do you have to live
in filthy surroundings?

873
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,340
Why don't you get jobs? Why
can't your kids go to school?

874
01:02:58,385 --> 01:02:59,682
Have you ever thought about it?

875
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:04,252
Think? We can
think of how to survive

876
01:03:04,892 --> 01:03:07,952
You're right. But what
is the real problem?

877
01:03:08,062 --> 01:03:11,759
Why is everything so costly?
And getting costlier everyday?

878
01:03:11,865 --> 01:03:13,833
Corruption.
- Yes.

879
01:03:14,201 --> 01:03:16,032
These are the very
questions I am posing

880
01:03:16,303 --> 01:03:19,761
Issues that get
suppressed by religious conflict

881
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,205
That I understood

882
01:03:21,608 --> 01:03:25,442
But why not lecture those
who provoke the rioting?

883
01:03:25,879 --> 01:03:28,712
I'm willing to talk to
anyone ready to listen

884
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,515
Why did you make the film?

885
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:43,694
To bring the facts to light

886
01:03:44,932 --> 01:03:48,732
You are a Muslim?
- No

887
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:52,995
From the Government?
- No

888
01:03:55,909 --> 01:04:00,403
Then why the film?

889
01:04:04,084 --> 01:04:07,110
I'm a Hindu. I have Muslim friends

890
01:04:07,588 --> 01:04:09,522
Our group has people of all faiths

891
01:04:10,691 --> 01:04:15,060
Look brother.. he's talking sense..

892
01:04:15,162 --> 01:04:18,325
Open your minds to it

893
01:04:18,966 --> 01:04:23,869
Hasn't the truth dawned on you yet?

894
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:29,534
Greek herb. Greek herb

895
01:04:29,643 --> 01:04:32,043
Cures your stomach
ache and indigestion.

896
01:04:32,112 --> 01:04:34,046
Famous all over India.

897
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:35,843
Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.

898
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:38,043
Hello.
- Hello.

899
01:04:38,118 --> 01:04:39,210
How are you?
- Alright

900
01:04:39,286 --> 01:04:40,776
You arrive at the right time.

901
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:43,448
What is the matter
- He has a stomachache

902
01:04:43,524 --> 01:04:47,221
Oh, I don't treat asses!
- Up yours!

903
01:04:48,996 --> 01:04:51,396
Peera, why don't you
ever finish the story.

904
01:04:53,834 --> 01:04:55,199
Hello.

905
01:05:02,776 --> 01:05:03,902
What is wrong, Salim?

906
01:05:05,012 --> 01:05:06,707
Not in a good mood?

907
01:05:08,715 --> 01:05:12,549
Vilasbhai, they
showed a film on Bhiwandi

908
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:15,145
A movie on riots.

909
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:17,823
I've heard of it

910
01:05:17,925 --> 01:05:21,622
What a film! Terrifying

911
01:05:22,129 --> 01:05:23,426
Innocent children were murdered.

912
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,397
That film was a load
of lies and nonsense

913
01:05:27,067 --> 01:05:30,662
Those swines are just
stirring up the public

914
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:34,873
The film said rioting should
come to a stop. Rightly so

915
01:05:36,243 --> 01:05:38,234
God knows which
bastards spark off these riots

916
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:40,604
The English screwed it up
- otherwise..

917
01:05:40,681 --> 01:05:42,842
..we'd all be living like brothers

918
01:05:43,183 --> 01:05:47,677
Lala, the English
were thrown out long ago

919
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:51,520
Even now there are people
who have no love for the nation

920
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:54,488
Like our good Muslim friend here?

921
01:05:54,561 --> 01:05:57,359
Where do I get time
off from preparing paans?

922
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:01,026
Lala, you do love your land?

923
01:06:02,169 --> 01:06:03,227
Of course

924
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,037
And how do you prove it?

925
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:07,072
By dealing in smuggled goods?

926
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:10,701
By having shares in
gambling dens and brothels..

927
01:06:11,078 --> 01:06:13,512
Why pick on me, Rafiqbhai?

928
01:06:13,747 --> 01:06:15,214
Did you hear that?

929
01:06:15,749 --> 01:06:17,216
Was Rafiq bhai wrong?

930
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:21,146
Lala, in this nation of ours..

931
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:23,121
..patriots have been
queuing up right from the start

932
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:28,560
Don't turn it into
a traffic jam Lala!

933
01:06:30,364 --> 01:06:35,028
Talk of 'love' and sit
uneasy on your tongue!

934
01:06:58,358 --> 01:07:00,952
Rascals, swines.

935
01:07:01,762 --> 01:07:03,320
Vilas.

936
01:07:03,597 --> 01:07:04,689
Vilas.

937
01:07:06,033 --> 01:07:07,159
Vilas.
- Who were they?

938
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:09,725
Peera, stop a car. Abdul,
get a car.

939
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:11,031
Stop one quickly.

940
01:07:11,138 --> 01:07:13,504
Vilas.
- Vilas.

941
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,034
Vilas, let's go to the hospital

942
01:07:15,108 --> 01:07:19,602
No hospital.. here

943
01:07:21,014 --> 01:07:22,743
Right here.

944
01:07:25,052 --> 01:07:26,986
I knew this would happen

945
01:07:27,087 --> 01:07:28,213
No, Vilas.

946
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,783
I knew my end was this

947
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:36,524
Vilas.
- Vilas.

948
01:07:50,577 --> 01:07:51,942
No one knew

949
01:07:52,846 --> 01:07:55,474
..who killed Vilas or why

950
01:07:56,817 --> 01:08:00,253
The public says it's gang rivalry

951
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:06,023
I don't know why but it
seemed to me sometimes..

952
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,591
Vilas wanted to die!

953
01:08:09,629 --> 01:08:11,893
He was fed up with his life

954
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:17,869
Vilas, I will never forget you

955
01:08:18,805 --> 01:08:20,363
I'll remember you till 'The End'

956
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:44,927
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

957
01:08:46,299 --> 01:08:47,766
Reporting, sir

958
01:08:49,102 --> 01:08:53,061
Oh good, you've come, I
was about to send for you

959
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:56,470
Anything special, Saheb?
- Yes.

960
01:08:59,913 --> 01:09:04,316
Saheb, have you found
out who killed Vilas?

961
01:09:04,785 --> 01:09:07,583
Who knows? Your line
of business is such

962
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:13,316
Even so Saheb, he was a human being

963
01:09:14,494 --> 01:09:17,088
No doubt, but for
the police records..

964
01:09:17,164 --> 01:09:18,722
..it's just one
goonda less. That's all

965
01:09:24,404 --> 01:09:25,564
Thumbprint here.

966
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,666
Why?
- As witness for the enquiry.

967
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:35,143
But I wasn't there
- Do as I see

968
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,274
But Saheb, when I
wasn't there to see..

969
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:40,552
Acting with me?

970
01:09:42,856 --> 01:09:44,881
I'll see you rot a lifetime in jail

971
01:09:46,126 --> 01:09:47,923
Put your thumb impression here.

972
01:09:50,163 --> 01:09:53,326
Your kind are all dogs and thieves

973
01:10:45,418 --> 01:10:47,682
Arre, you'll hurt yourself

974
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:52,351
Why didn't I get one chance Anees?

975
01:10:52,893 --> 01:10:54,884
I am trapped, Anees.

976
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:04,599
Why?

977
01:11:06,406 --> 01:11:08,533
I never got a chance!

978
01:11:10,477 --> 01:11:14,436
I want to climb out but I cannot

979
01:11:15,081 --> 01:11:18,380
I'm trapped

980
01:11:24,457 --> 01:11:25,583
Forget it.

981
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,686
Have a puff.

982
01:11:52,886 --> 01:11:56,947
Jani, why don't you
go away from here?

983
01:11:57,691 --> 01:11:58,817
To where?

984
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:06,362
To your house, to your parents,
to your country..

985
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,926
Why?

986
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:11,363
Arre, there's
nothing for you here..

987
01:12:13,073 --> 01:12:14,665
There's nothing here for anybody

988
01:12:16,576 --> 01:12:19,807
Get away as fast as you can

989
01:12:21,014 --> 01:12:22,311
Shall I tell you something?

990
01:12:24,784 --> 01:12:26,308
You know, as a place to die in..

991
01:12:27,954 --> 01:12:30,081
..India is difficult to beat

992
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,451
They've found a corpse
in the gutter. It's rotted

993
01:13:07,961 --> 01:13:12,125
Bastards! Our work
is to remove garbage.

994
01:13:13,566 --> 01:13:15,534
Not corpses littering garbage

995
01:13:17,237 --> 01:13:21,765
Does anyone know this corpses
- In this condition!

996
01:13:22,008 --> 01:13:24,135
Must have been there
since the day of riot.

997
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:25,404
Seems to be a Muslim

998
01:13:25,812 --> 01:13:30,579
Hindu or Muslim, he
died a dog's death

999
01:13:31,651 --> 01:13:33,380
Check if there are
any more lying around

1000
01:13:33,953 --> 01:13:37,389
What Saheb? One corpse won't do?

1001
01:13:37,691 --> 01:13:40,387
Go on, fill the gutters.
We're there to clean up

1002
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:43,760
Hey! What're you looking?
- No.. just looking

1003
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,128
Go on, look your fill

1004
01:13:48,802 --> 01:13:52,329
Now you're feeling sick?
At the time of killing..

1005
01:13:53,673 --> 01:13:55,573
They clash swords over
temples and mosques..

1006
01:13:55,642 --> 01:13:56,973
..but where they
end up is the gutter

1007
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:58,570
Take him away.

1008
01:13:58,778 --> 01:14:00,871
Yes, take him away. Take him away.

1009
01:14:26,473 --> 01:14:30,671
Hindu.. Muslim..

1010
01:14:31,745 --> 01:14:35,613
..what is it all about?

1011
01:14:41,287 --> 01:14:43,721
Right from birth
Muslims are told that..

1012
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:45,451
Hindus are non-believers..

1013
01:14:47,794 --> 01:14:51,093
and Hindus.. that
Muslims are outcastes.

1014
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:54,994
This poisonous mix of
hatred and illusion..

1015
01:14:55,068 --> 01:14:56,933
..is fed them right from childhood

1016
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:05,877
This very poison led to..

1017
01:15:06,913 --> 01:15:10,474
..the country being partitioned

1018
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:21,052
How did Partition take place?

1019
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,363
Many years ago..

1020
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:28,490
by drawing a line..

1021
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:31,169
..this country was
sliced into two parts

1022
01:15:32,372 --> 01:15:35,739
India this side Pakistan on that

1023
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:39,478
But why?

1024
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,612
So that the powerful on each side..

1025
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:46,875
..could reign over their

1026
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:49,518
And so Pakistan was created..

1027
01:15:57,363 --> 01:15:59,957
Thousand of Muslims were killed..

1028
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:04,401
Thousand of Hindus too!

1029
01:16:09,175 --> 01:16:11,803
Senselessly they cut
each others throats

1030
01:16:11,878 --> 01:16:13,743
Rivers of blood flowed

1031
01:16:15,348 --> 01:16:19,808
The severed shoulders
were named Pakistan.

1032
01:16:23,823 --> 01:16:25,290
What a mishap!

1033
01:16:25,925 --> 01:16:27,051
Yes.

1034
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:33,521
Mishap it was

1035
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:41,600
The same fools..

1036
01:16:42,609 --> 01:16:44,076
were under the illusion that..

1037
01:16:44,177 --> 01:16:48,113
religious bonds can
tie people together

1038
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:52,316
They were proved wrong

1039
01:16:52,986 --> 01:16:56,080
Absolutely wrong!
- How?

1040
01:16:59,826 --> 01:17:03,023
A day came when they had
to divide Pakistan too

1041
01:17:03,563 --> 01:17:05,690
And yet another nation
was born.. Bangladesh

1042
01:17:06,533 --> 01:17:08,592
But this time Muslim fought Muslim

1043
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:13,000
The maker of Pakistan
did not grasp the lesson

1044
01:17:13,072 --> 01:17:14,562
that time teaches..

1045
01:17:16,309 --> 01:17:21,872
That shared experience, music,
dreams, language

1046
01:17:21,948 --> 01:17:25,509
..bind people together.
Not religion. Ever

1047
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:38,754
Today, it's happening in India too

1048
01:17:40,233 --> 01:17:42,793
A virus of hatred is
being spread among people..

1049
01:17:42,902 --> 01:17:45,336
by saying that India
is only for Hindus

1050
01:17:46,172 --> 01:17:49,266
that only religion can
tie people together..

1051
01:17:55,782 --> 01:17:58,216
One day these people
will be proved wrong too

1052
01:18:01,487 --> 01:18:03,546
Mankind has spent ages..

1053
01:18:03,756 --> 01:18:08,125
..on locating
difference between people

1054
01:18:10,797 --> 01:18:12,924
If only it could spend a moment..

1055
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:17,829
..locating what unites them instead

1056
01:18:27,413 --> 01:18:29,005
Whom am I?

1057
01:18:30,717 --> 01:18:32,480
Whom am I?

1058
01:18:35,622 --> 01:18:41,959
O God, help me

1059
01:18:42,762 --> 01:18:45,287
Your share.
- Shell it out.

1060
01:18:45,365 --> 01:18:47,162
I told you this is a bad day.

1061
01:18:47,233 --> 01:18:49,224
What can the poor public do?

1062
01:18:50,703 --> 01:18:53,035
Is there any way out of the gutter?

1063
01:18:54,574 --> 01:18:56,735
Via gambling? Or vie the lottery?

1064
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:02,971
But the Govt. say:
Gambling is bad, lottery is good!

1065
01:19:04,817 --> 01:19:08,753
One is criminal the other legal!

1066
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:11,447
I lost after talking your advice.

1067
01:19:11,524 --> 01:19:13,287
Did I say anything.

1068
01:19:14,694 --> 01:19:18,892
The world's a screwed up place
- who did it

1069
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:24,831
is there anyone who can explain?

1070
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:28,634
If there is, he'd better show up

1071
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:33,471
We're in a bad way

1072
01:19:36,015 --> 01:19:39,280
For me.

1073
01:19:43,723 --> 01:19:45,156
Come on, Salim.

1074
01:19:45,992 --> 01:19:48,358
Go on. Hurry up.

1075
01:19:49,595 --> 01:19:50,721
Go on.

1076
01:19:53,332 --> 01:19:55,596
Salim, you here?

1077
01:19:56,235 --> 01:19:59,204
Came here for some work..

1078
01:19:59,839 --> 01:20:03,036
I'm glad you came. I've
been waiting to meet you..

1079
01:20:03,409 --> 01:20:05,468
Me? Why?

1080
01:20:05,778 --> 01:20:09,111
Don't be innocent.. asking why

1081
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,376
One minute. I have
something for you

1082
01:20:12,185 --> 01:20:13,277
What is it?

1083
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,548
A Small present.. a lighter

1084
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:20,225
For me?
- Who else do I have?

1085
01:20:21,194 --> 01:20:22,354
Who gave it?

1086
01:20:23,796 --> 01:20:25,286
What difference does it make?

1087
01:20:30,236 --> 01:20:31,567
I don't want it.

1088
01:20:33,106 --> 01:20:34,198
Keep it!

1089
01:20:35,141 --> 01:20:36,301
I told you, I don't want it!

1090
01:20:36,776 --> 01:20:39,870
Okay.. why the fuss?

1091
01:20:39,979 --> 01:20:41,173
I said I didn't want it!

1092
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:44,580
The customers will
be here any moment!

1093
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:47,346
One minute Seth, I'm ready

1094
01:20:52,592 --> 01:20:56,119
You'll have to leave, Salim
- I'm going

1095
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:59,195
Shall I tell you something
- Quickly!

1096
01:20:59,632 --> 01:21:02,760
You look beautiful today!
- Really?

1097
01:21:03,603 --> 01:21:04,695
No, I am lying.

1098
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:08,637
Thank you. You're
looking handsome yourself

1099
01:21:09,275 --> 01:21:10,401
Okay, push off!

1100
01:21:11,444 --> 01:21:12,570
Khuda Hafiz

1101
01:21:21,387 --> 01:21:22,479
See you.

1102
01:21:22,555 --> 01:21:27,185
This is a business house
not a rendezvous for Romeos!

1103
01:21:27,794 --> 01:21:30,160
Do you understand?
- I do.

1104
01:21:31,097 --> 01:21:32,758
Remember that!

1105
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:35,996
Yes, sir.
- Get going.

1106
01:22:09,902 --> 01:22:13,338
Very nice. Who gave it to you?

1107
01:22:17,743 --> 01:22:19,040
Somebody

1108
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,579
Someone special?

1109
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:29,678
Go and sleep!

1110
01:22:37,864 --> 01:22:47,239
''My shoes are from Japan
My pants from England''

1111
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,002
''My hat is Russian But
my heart is Hindustani''

1112
01:22:50,109 --> 01:23:01,885
''I set out on the open road,
Courage in my heart''

1113
01:23:02,321 --> 01:23:13,630
''Where is the destination?
Only God above knows''

1114
01:23:14,033 --> 01:23:17,833
''My face is familiar
Still people are confused..''

1115
01:23:18,004 --> 01:23:23,567
''My hat is Russian But
my heart is Hindustani''

1116
01:23:28,014 --> 01:23:30,005
My life was changing..

1117
01:23:32,084 --> 01:23:36,350
And I knew, if I tried..

1118
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:40,151
..really tried..

1119
01:23:41,894 --> 01:23:44,556
I too could become
like my brother, Javed.

1120
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:50,631
In other words, Salim Langde,
Salim Pasha!

1121
01:23:54,707 --> 01:23:57,005
''Wants to be..'' What
are you staring at?

1122
01:23:57,076 --> 01:23:58,441
Peera.

1123
01:23:59,412 --> 01:24:01,312
Abdul, don't fool around.
- No joking around.

1124
01:24:01,447 --> 01:24:02,709
Salim, better explain him.

1125
01:24:02,815 --> 01:24:04,442
He tries to be a hero..

1126
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:07,314
''Wants to be a hero.''
- Wear anything you like.

1127
01:24:07,386 --> 01:24:09,581
Yes.

1128
01:24:10,389 --> 01:24:12,380
Abdul.
- Yes, 10 o'clock.

1129
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:15,059
It's useful.
- Yes, I am coming.

1130
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:17,459
Take it out. - Yes, in 15 minutes.
- Can't get it open.

1131
01:24:19,665 --> 01:24:21,428
Hey, what are you doing

1132
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:22,827
Can't you see? I'm
removing the wipers

1133
01:24:22,902 --> 01:24:25,370
That's my car!
- Did I say it was mine?

1134
01:24:25,438 --> 01:24:27,030
Leave it.

1135
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:30,504
You're lucky we're not
taking the whole car!

1136
01:24:30,676 --> 01:24:33,509
Thieves! Bullies!
I'll call the police

1137
01:24:34,013 --> 01:24:35,480
Call them.
- Call them.

1138
01:24:35,648 --> 01:24:39,709
Police? We pay them off
every month - In advance!

1139
01:24:39,986 --> 01:24:42,181
Let him go.. go

1140
01:24:42,288 --> 01:24:43,653
Understand.
- Leave, sir.

1141
01:24:44,056 --> 01:24:45,648
We spare your wiper.
- Leave.

1142
01:24:48,694 --> 01:24:50,161
What is happening?

1143
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:52,220
Nowadays, such things happen..

1144
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:06,075
This part of Bombay
is top! Wonderful!

1145
01:25:06,212 --> 01:25:09,841
Fresh breeze..

1146
01:25:09,915 --> 01:25:13,749
Wow.. fancy public!

1147
01:25:16,088 --> 01:25:19,023
Look at her legs.
- Look at the other one.

1148
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:21,649
Abdul.

1149
01:25:24,463 --> 01:25:25,953
Why didn't we go to school?

1150
01:25:26,198 --> 01:25:28,359
I went. Until Class II

1151
01:25:29,435 --> 01:25:30,595
After that?

1152
01:25:30,669 --> 01:25:32,728
I joined in your school

1153
01:25:35,174 --> 01:25:36,641
Rascals.

1154
01:25:39,645 --> 01:25:40,873
And you Peera?

1155
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,676
No school for me!
College. Straight off

1156
01:25:43,816 --> 01:25:48,719
College! Where boys and
girls roam hand in hand..

1157
01:25:48,788 --> 01:25:50,187
Just like them

1158
01:25:50,489 --> 01:25:52,514
How are you?
- Just a minute.

1159
01:25:54,427 --> 01:25:56,793
I am fine.
- Where going?

1160
01:25:57,029 --> 01:25:59,998
There.
- Where? Where? Where? Where?

1161
01:26:00,066 --> 01:26:01,829
Don't touch.

1162
01:26:02,435 --> 01:26:04,266
Coming for a movie?
- No.

1163
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,361
Coming to the discos?
- No.

1164
01:26:06,472 --> 01:26:08,201
Coming for videos?
- No.

1165
01:26:08,307 --> 01:26:10,571
Coming at the back alley?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

1166
01:26:10,643 --> 01:26:14,807
Got her. Got her. Got her.

1167
01:26:18,217 --> 01:26:19,616
Peera.

1168
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:27,584
Peera, if I start some business..

1169
01:26:27,726 --> 01:26:28,954
Like what?

1170
01:26:30,429 --> 01:26:32,624
Could be any business..

1171
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:37,799
Not robbery, stealing

1172
01:26:41,073 --> 01:26:42,267
But why?

1173
01:26:44,543 --> 01:26:45,874
I'm tired of this kind of life..

1174
01:26:48,414 --> 01:26:50,041
But what will happen to you two?

1175
01:26:50,983 --> 01:26:54,919
What can I do? I've no
one else but you two

1176
01:26:54,987 --> 01:26:57,717
But Salim bhai, why are
you talking like this?

1177
01:27:05,231 --> 01:27:09,531
Anees will get
married ..She'll have kids!

1178
01:27:11,871 --> 01:27:17,070
They'll want a
proper uncle, isn't it?

1179
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:22,470
I'll have to send them to school..

1180
01:27:23,516 --> 01:27:24,642
..then to college

1181
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:29,278
'Top' idea, isn't it?
Make them big shots!

1182
01:27:29,822 --> 01:27:31,289
They'll live in house like these

1183
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:33,956
We'll show the whole
world what we're made of..

1184
01:27:34,059 --> 01:27:36,960
.. can shine as
brightly as the best

1185
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:40,966
Well said! Well said!

1186
01:27:42,401 --> 01:27:44,335
Now tell the whole world..

1187
01:27:45,504 --> 01:27:47,199
We'll show you what we're made of!

1188
01:27:47,273 --> 01:27:50,401
No less than the best of the rest!

1189
01:27:51,177 --> 01:27:53,111
We'll show you what we're made of!

1190
01:27:53,212 --> 01:27:56,704
No less than the best of the rest!

1191
01:28:46,098 --> 01:28:47,326
What is it Salim?

1192
01:28:48,834 --> 01:28:51,530
I want a job..

1193
01:28:53,138 --> 01:28:54,730
Don't you already have job to do?

1194
01:28:55,007 --> 01:29:00,001
Not that kind of job, brother!
A proper one!

1195
01:29:02,381 --> 01:29:04,008
What kind of work?

1196
01:29:06,986 --> 01:29:10,513
You know what I mean..

1197
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:15,784
I have no training. I
cannot read or write..

1198
01:29:17,496 --> 01:29:20,659
Won't you help me?

1199
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:23,358
Looks like you're in a big hurry!

1200
01:29:25,938 --> 01:29:27,997
I have waster a lot of time.

1201
01:29:28,674 --> 01:29:30,073
Just like that.

1202
01:29:32,611 --> 01:29:35,375
Will you help me? Say something!

1203
01:29:38,751 --> 01:29:40,810
..Why not?

1204
01:29:49,461 --> 01:29:51,986
Excuse me.

1205
01:29:52,197 --> 01:29:54,631
Where is Nazir sir?
- There, working on the white car.

1206
01:30:03,409 --> 01:30:04,774
Hello, boss

1207
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:09,174
Can I get job here?

1208
01:30:09,581 --> 01:30:12,209
Here jobs are not given
- they get done

1209
01:30:13,352 --> 01:30:15,843
Rafiq bhai sent me

1210
01:30:24,396 --> 01:30:26,159
I want to learn, sir..

1211
01:30:26,799 --> 01:30:28,426
What do you want to learn?

1212
01:30:29,601 --> 01:30:33,594
Everything. Everything you know..

1213
01:30:33,839 --> 01:30:35,101
Everything?
- Yes.

1214
01:30:35,974 --> 01:30:39,967
I want to become the
world's 'top' mechanic..

1215
01:30:40,179 --> 01:30:44,172
You can't be the
world's 'top' mechanic..

1216
01:30:46,652 --> 01:30:48,017
Why?

1217
01:30:49,822 --> 01:30:51,153
Because that's me!

1218
01:30:53,492 --> 01:30:56,723
Ok Boss! Second place will do

1219
01:31:03,369 --> 01:31:05,098
When do you want to start?

1220
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:08,468
Whenever you say. Today? Now?

1221
01:31:09,141 --> 01:31:13,373
You'll have to work very hard
- I will

1222
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:16,676
You'll have to be punctual
- Definitely

1223
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,517
If you skip even one day,
I'll sack you

1224
01:31:22,087 --> 01:31:23,384
Alright

1225
01:31:23,789 --> 01:31:25,518
You won't be paid
much to start with..

1226
01:31:28,927 --> 01:31:31,919
..But I'll teach
you everything I know

1227
01:31:34,933 --> 01:31:37,925
When do I start?
- From the First

1228
01:31:40,005 --> 01:31:43,031
Thank you.

1229
01:32:13,972 --> 01:32:15,439
Like it?

1230
01:32:17,009 --> 01:32:19,034
I like the music too

1231
01:32:20,379 --> 01:32:23,974
Sometime I hear it at
night and think of you

1232
01:32:30,689 --> 01:32:32,316
Never lose it

1233
01:32:32,691 --> 01:32:37,754
Where can it go? I
carry it 24 hours a day

1234
01:32:39,965 --> 01:32:42,866
When is Anees's engagement?

1235
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:47,400
We'll have it soon. Soon

1236
01:32:50,409 --> 01:32:51,967
Then it's our turn

1237
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:02,816
Your tea's getting cold..

1238
01:33:04,022 --> 01:33:05,853
You have no faith in me

1239
01:33:09,361 --> 01:33:13,229
Look Mumtaz, we'll
have a home of our own

1240
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:15,696
Our home

1241
01:33:18,971 --> 01:33:20,768
It's not just a dream..

1242
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:26,671
All I need is you by
my side, that's all

1243
01:33:28,814 --> 01:33:30,441
You do want to be with me?

1244
01:33:33,318 --> 01:33:35,286
It's not all that easy

1245
01:33:35,454 --> 01:33:36,887
So you're saying Then
it's difficult. So what?

1246
01:33:36,989 --> 01:33:38,513
Where do these people come from?

1247
01:33:39,391 --> 01:33:40,756
Don't shout

1248
01:33:47,533 --> 01:33:51,867
Why accept defeat
right at the start?

1249
01:33:54,206 --> 01:33:56,037
We must try at least, isn't it?

1250
01:33:58,076 --> 01:34:03,036
Tell me it will happen. Tell me!

1251
01:34:04,116 --> 01:34:05,481
Say it's possible.

1252
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,816
It will happen

1253
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:14,655
Not like that. With a smile

1254
01:34:22,034 --> 01:34:23,501
It will happen!

1255
01:34:33,011 --> 01:34:34,239
Mumtaz

1256
01:34:43,288 --> 01:34:46,724
Wow mother. A masterpiece

1257
01:34:46,892 --> 01:34:49,383
Like it.
- Its beautiful.

1258
01:34:50,529 --> 01:34:53,987
What a bride Anees will make

1259
01:34:56,068 --> 01:34:57,592
Anees

1260
01:34:58,437 --> 01:35:00,496
Once you put it on,
will you recognise me?

1261
01:35:01,807 --> 01:35:03,297
You won't

1262
01:35:04,309 --> 01:35:07,801
Now it only remains to
organise a little cash

1263
01:35:08,046 --> 01:35:09,741
We'll have first
class decorations..

1264
01:35:09,848 --> 01:35:11,440
..a glittering show

1265
01:35:11,516 --> 01:35:14,076
Brother, what's the
point of wasting money

1266
01:35:14,353 --> 01:35:17,322
What did you say? Waste of money?

1267
01:35:17,789 --> 01:35:19,416
It's the first

1268
01:35:22,027 --> 01:35:24,962
First time, I'll do
something for my little sister

1269
01:35:25,364 --> 01:35:27,093
Don't stop me

1270
01:35:28,066 --> 01:35:31,763
How will you return the money?

1271
01:35:32,237 --> 01:35:38,665
I'll manage Abba with
money earned by my sweat

1272
01:35:38,844 --> 01:35:41,039
Just wait
- see how hard I work

1273
01:35:43,882 --> 01:35:47,716
Basher, how are you?

1274
01:35:49,354 --> 01:35:51,049
Salim, they have called
for you. I don't know.

1275
01:35:56,094 --> 01:35:57,823
Shankar's case
must be settled today

1276
01:35:57,929 --> 01:35:59,794
It will be done

1277
01:36:02,367 --> 01:36:06,827
Brief all the boys
- We've taken care of all

1278
01:36:07,472 --> 01:36:09,770
..but for this one
- Hello.

1279
01:36:10,442 --> 01:36:12,876
Where have you been?

1280
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:17,071
You need special invitation

1281
01:36:19,084 --> 01:36:24,021
Let them brief you
- What do I have to do?

1282
01:36:24,956 --> 01:36:26,856
Pull the seat from under Shanker.

1283
01:36:27,926 --> 01:36:30,019
Then?
- Then what?

1284
01:36:31,029 --> 01:36:34,396
Be outside the Club 10 p.m. sharp

1285
01:36:35,567 --> 01:36:36,829
Seth, I won't be there

1286
01:36:37,536 --> 01:36:40,596
What'd you say? Did you
hear that Ibrahim bhai?!

1287
01:36:42,407 --> 01:36:45,069
And never interrupt me.
Whatever I say..

1288
01:36:48,447 --> 01:36:49,675
Just a minute.

1289
01:36:53,351 --> 01:36:57,310
What's wrong with you
- Nothing

1290
01:36:59,758 --> 01:37:02,784
When's your sister's engagement?

1291
01:37:04,329 --> 01:37:06,058
In a couple of days

1292
01:37:07,332 --> 01:37:08,822
You've arranged for the money?

1293
01:37:10,535 --> 01:37:13,368
We'll manage it

1294
01:37:13,438 --> 01:37:17,033
What am I there for? We'll
have the function in style!

1295
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:20,476
Get cracking! Check your
part in the production

1296
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,908
I want to stay away
from this kind of trouble

1297
01:37:25,417 --> 01:37:29,012
Call this riot? It's business!

1298
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,493
You don't have to
tell me that Seth.

1299
01:37:37,195 --> 01:37:42,030
I know this 'business'
can slide into a riot.

1300
01:37:43,034 --> 01:37:47,198
Hindu
- Muslim. And innocents will die,

1301
01:37:47,272 --> 01:37:50,036
What? I start riots?

1302
01:37:50,475 --> 01:37:52,340
I protect my men!

1303
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:56,811
I look after my brothers!

1304
01:37:57,415 --> 01:38:00,350
If I or 2 die on either
side how does it matter

1305
01:38:00,552 --> 01:38:04,147
In business, there are
always profit and loss columns

1306
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,885
Have you ever seen a riot?

1307
01:38:09,694 --> 01:38:10,991
Who are you asking?

1308
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:15,266
Not you Seth in a general way

1309
01:38:17,636 --> 01:38:20,434
I've seen riots and the have reap

1310
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:24,268
How men destroy men

1311
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:27,137
Cut each other into pieces

1312
01:38:28,046 --> 01:38:30,037
Rape each others women

1313
01:38:30,482 --> 01:38:35,078
Slay innocent children

1314
01:38:35,554 --> 01:38:37,317
Burn houses to the ground

1315
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:40,517
And you call it business!

1316
01:38:42,794 --> 01:38:44,523
I want no part of it

1317
01:38:46,398 --> 01:38:47,695
I don't want it.

1318
01:38:48,567 --> 01:38:49,966
I don't want it.

1319
01:39:13,692 --> 01:39:16,024
Aslam. Aslam.

1320
01:39:16,928 --> 01:39:19,726
What's the matter?
- Forgive me. It's very late but..

1321
01:39:20,932 --> 01:39:22,866
Come up!
- No, I'm in a hurry

1322
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:25,801
I came to say one thing..
- Tell me

1323
01:39:26,104 --> 01:39:27,799
Do you remember you said..

1324
01:39:28,173 --> 01:39:31,631
..there's no need to
live in the shadows

1325
01:39:31,776 --> 01:39:33,243
Of course, I remember

1326
01:39:33,545 --> 01:39:36,639
I wanted to tell you, I'm
coming out into the light

1327
01:39:38,016 --> 01:39:39,210
God be with you

1328
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:42,709
I'm coming out into the light

1329
01:39:55,533 --> 01:39:57,728
My name is Salim

1330
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:04,333
I am an Indian

1331
01:40:06,444 --> 01:40:11,848
I want to live with dignity..
with dignity

1332
01:40:14,052 --> 01:40:17,510
I want to live with dignity

1333
01:40:25,297 --> 01:40:27,527
Hello.

1334
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:30,232
Hello.

1335
01:40:32,037 --> 01:40:33,561
Welcome. Hello.

1336
01:40:33,838 --> 01:40:35,305
Hello.

1337
01:40:42,147 --> 01:40:44,638
Why are you all here?

1338
01:40:44,783 --> 01:40:48,446
The electrician wants a wire
- I'll take care of it

1339
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,215
Go down, there are so
many things pending.

1340
01:40:50,288 --> 01:40:52,848
Bhai, Shehnaz has arrived!

1341
01:40:53,091 --> 01:40:56,993
I told you
- No mischief today. Beat it

1342
01:40:57,162 --> 01:40:59,892
See, Salim.

1343
01:41:19,184 --> 01:41:20,651
Are you happy?

1344
01:41:23,755 --> 01:41:26,747
In a little while,
you'll go to your own home..

1345
01:41:31,229 --> 01:41:35,928
May God let every
happiness flower there

1346
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:52,209
Salim has made all
the arrangements.

1347
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:13,137
Abbu, now you can say
with pride: Salim is my son.

1348
01:42:19,377 --> 01:42:22,608
I'm downstairs. Call
me if you need anything.

1349
01:42:22,714 --> 01:42:24,181
Go.

1350
01:42:29,988 --> 01:42:31,319
Hello.

1351
01:42:52,143 --> 01:42:55,408
One two three.. four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1352
01:42:55,547 --> 01:42:58,846
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1353
01:42:58,983 --> 01:43:02,419
One two three.. four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1354
01:43:02,487 --> 01:43:05,820
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1355
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:10,156
I wait for you.. I wait
for you counting the days.

1356
01:43:10,295 --> 01:43:14,732
Come, my dear, the spring's here.

1357
01:43:14,799 --> 01:43:17,324
I wait for you counting the days.

1358
01:43:17,402 --> 01:43:21,463
Come, my dear, the spring's here.

1359
01:43:21,606 --> 01:43:25,201
One two three.. four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1360
01:43:25,276 --> 01:43:28,643
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1361
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,714
One two three..

1362
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:57,007
Salim. Salim.
- Stop it. Blood. - Who did this?

1363
01:43:57,242 --> 01:43:59,802
Salim. Salim.

1364
01:44:01,446 --> 01:44:11,879
One life, and few dreams..

1365
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:23,830
One life, and dreams..

1366
01:44:24,836 --> 01:44:34,370
How casually were they sacrificed

1367
01:44:35,113 --> 01:44:42,747
Those who dismembered the land..

1368
01:44:44,923 --> 01:44:54,059
Those who dismembered the land..

1369
01:44:54,866 --> 01:45:02,830
Those who dismembered the land..

1370
01:45:04,275 --> 01:45:12,546
Shifted the blame..

1371
01:45:13,017 --> 01:45:22,415
To the shoulder's of innocents

1372
01:45:24,629 --> 01:45:28,190
Those who drove people

1373
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,659
Across borders..

1374
01:45:33,338 --> 01:45:40,073
Cared not to know who
fell exhausted when..

1375
01:45:40,378 --> 01:45:48,285
Cared not to know who
fell exhausted when..

1376
01:45:49,487 --> 01:45:57,019
Or where they laid their Meads

1377
01:45:57,562 --> 01:46:07,904
Even after all that happened.

1378
01:46:09,507 --> 01:46:17,505
People still are in the same mood

1379
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:21,943
Even now temper of hatred..

1380
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:27,788
Rules the land..

1381
01:46:30,328 --> 01:46:38,758
One life, A few dreams..

1382
01:46:39,971 --> 01:46:51,576
How casually were they sacrificed..
