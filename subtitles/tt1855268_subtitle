Do you know? The roof of
our orphanage has come down? - What?

..when Lord Krishna came
to meet His mother Yashoda?

46
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,722
Brother Nattu, he didn't come to meet,

Yes, he was brought.
- He was brought? From where?

48
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,623
Do you want to know?

Okay, listen.

This happened when
Mathura was ruled by Kans.

53
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:10,148
Even that night,
it was raining heavily like this.

54
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,464
King, why are you worried?

55
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:38,273
You all know very well that
the eighth child born to Devaki..

56
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:39,936
..will be the reason for my death..

57
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:44,347

l'm very restless.
Moreover, this nature problem.

00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:55,358
Such heavy rains..
l've never seen such rain till today.

60
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:01,797
lt looks like this rain
is going to flood over Mathura.

61
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,268
Lord, you are very powerful.

62
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:07,329

You don't worry and go
to your bedroom. Take rest. - No.

69

Go and see Devaki. - As you order.

Be alert, as soon as Devaki
gives birth to her child..

00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:05,662
..inform the king immediately.
- As you order.

72
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,773
Glory to the king.
King, you don't worry.

73
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:28,184
l don't think Devaki
is going to deliver today.

74
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:30,882
So, you don't worry and take rest.

75
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:36,184
By the way,
all our soldiers are on guard.

76
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,253
Be careful.

77
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:48,507
Devaki, you've given birth to a son.

78
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:56,541
See this. Our eighth
son will kill Kans one day.

79
00:08:56,616 --> 00:09:01,246
But.. - Devaki, don't worry.
l'll take him to Gokul.

80
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,460
Lord, l'm blessed.

81
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,317
Oh Lord, how will l

82
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:54,198

How will l repay your favor?

86
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:31,674
What are you saying?
This is Lord's wish.

87
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:42,445

- Who told you that you are ill?

177
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:02,393
This is calcium tablet.

178
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:06,290
Calcium makes bone stronger.
Just like that.

179
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:09,863

You would've taken a run.

196
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:05,489
Sister, shall l ask you something?

197
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:10,626
Do ghosts exist?
l mean, have you seen them in real?

198
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:14,594
Brother Nattu.. come on,
everything is ready. Call everyone.

Tempo, why have you come alone?
Where's Krishna?

206
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:44,755
Take this, it is not bitter.

207
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,773
Krishna! Krishna!

208
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,245
Krishna! - What's the matter?

209
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,489
Can't you hear me? l've
been shouting your name from long.

210
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,218

Always stay with Tempo. ls that clear?

214
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:25,260
Vitamin, Sanskar..
- When will l get parents?

215
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:32,742
Parents?
Why do you need parents suddenly?

216
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,539
Come herre.. come herre..

217
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,907
l'm here..
l'm your mother as well as father.

218
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:45,485
Do l lack in giving you love
that you are thinking like this?

219
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:49,483
No.. but still l want parents.

220
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:54,732
Won't l get parents?
- You'll get. You'll surely get them.

221
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:58,697
Why won't you get them? Not only you,
all the children will get.

222
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:03,606
Nice parents.
Promise. - Sister guarantees it.

223
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:07,737
Yes. - Sanskar won't get
parents because he is dark.

224
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:11,683
He is dark.
- No, you shouldn't say that.

225
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:17,217
isten to me..
he is not darrk. H e is wrhitish.

226
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,287
Lord Krishna was also whitish.

227
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,290
Do you know, all the colors
have their own importance? - Yes.

228
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:26,456
Once all the colors started fighting.

229
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,429
Blue color said l'm very important.
So the color of the sky is blue.

230
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:35,468
Then green color said, 'get lost,
not you, but l'm important..

231
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:39,733
..so all the trees and
the leaves are green in color.

232
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:43,942
The same way,
red, yellow, orange, everyone said..

233
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:46,443
..'l'm better than you,
l'm important.'

234
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:49,686
The rain was listening to them.

235
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:52,622
She said, 'you all are
important in your own place.'

236
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:56,422
Then there was a strong
lightening in the sky.

237
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,593
All the colors got scared
and hold each other hands.

238
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:04,559
Then a beautiful rainbow
was seen in the sky.

239
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:07,936
All the colors were smiling together.

240
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:13,210
Frrom that dayn..
all the colors stopped fightin g.

241
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:14,506
Just like that.

242
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,403
Everyone hold each others hands.

243
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:18,314
These kids..

244
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:21,553
Sister, what's the matter?

245
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:26,581
Brother Nattu,
the way Krishna spoke about parents..

246
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:32,222
..did you hear that?
But his disease.. who will adopt him?

247
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,460
l get scared when
l think about his future.

248
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:37,968
Sister, you are
worrying unnecessarily.

249
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,773
Krishna is a unique child.
God has his mercy on him.

250
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,308
You say all these things,
don't you? - Yes.

251
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,674
So, God would've surely
thought something good for him.

252
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,607
Sister, l guarantee you.

253
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:56,744
Children, tell me.. who made
Agra's world famous Taj Mahal?

254
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:59,290
Who made it? - Tell me, who made it?

255
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:01,292
Sister, a carpenter made it.

256
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,160
Carrpenterr?

257
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:15,733
Who is that carpenter? Krishna,
Taj Mahal was made by Shah Jahan.

258
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,833
Sister, Shah Jahan got it made.

259
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:22,179
But the carpenter made it. - Oh.

260
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:26,649
He said it right, isn't it?
- lntelligent. Very intelligent.

261
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:31,588
Okay.. l'll ask you one
more intelligent question.

262
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,757
10 + 4 is equal to.. tell me..

263
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,925
10 + 4.. - Howr much? - lt is 14..

264
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:44,225
Yes, it is 1 4. - 1 4!

265
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:50,435
This is a very simple thing.. but
l'm telling that 1 0 + 4 is equal to 2.

266
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:51,801
What? - How is that possible?

267
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:55,335
1 0 + 4 = 1 4.. how can it be 2?

268
00:23:55,614 --> 00:24:00,381
lt is possible.
See this.. 1 0 o'clock plus 4 hours..

269
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:04,149
..is equal to.. - 2 o'clock! - Yes.

270
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,220
This is an intelligent thing,
isn't it?

271
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:09,593
l remembered one more thing..
do you know..

272
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:14,764
..an ostrich's eyes
are bigger than his brains?

273
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,331
Star fish..
it doesn't have a brain at all.

274
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:22,272
ike brrotherr hNattu.. - Shut up.

275
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:25,943
What's the matter?
- Sister, the family is here.

276
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:29,640
l had verified them yesterday..
- They are here? - Yes.

277
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:31,883
Do one thing.. - Yes.

278
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:35,812
You make the children ready,
l'll chat with them. - Yes.

279
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:39,685
Tell me,
why do you want to adopt a child?

280
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:44,560
Actually.. - Actually ma'am,
she had a miscarriage thrice.

281
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,695
The doctors say that
she cannot conceive now.

282
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,200
So, we've decided
to adopt a child now.

283
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:54,973
Okay.. - Yes,
whichever child we adopt from here..

284
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,201
..we'll take care
of him very well. - Yes.

285
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,203
You have to do it.

286
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:02,778
Actually,
we give our children only to those..

287
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:06,215
..who are responsible,
caring, and gentle.

288
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,376
l don't let my children
suffer for anything here.

289
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:14,283
All the children stay happily.
We all stay like a happy family.

290
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,562
So, when we get a
better family than this..

291
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:20,823
..only then l allow my children to go.

292
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,700
Brother Nattu has seen
our office and house.

293
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:24,900
He doesn't have any problem.

294
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:29,300
All the otherr details arre in this
file. You can have a look. - Okayn.

295
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:33,903
Tempo, why are you applying
so much of oil on your head?

296
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,242
So that l look like a fool.

297
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:38,850
Why do you want to look like a fool?

298
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,408
Because l don't want to
go from here leaving sister.

299
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:42,544
Why should l go?

300
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:45,346
lf l go away..

301
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:48,655
..where will l find brother
Nattu to scare him? - You are right.

302
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:54,626
Tempo, give me some oil. Even
l don't want to go leaving sister.

303
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:58,425
l've even prayed to God
that they take Krishna with them.

304
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:00,471
Why do you want to send Krishna away?

305
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,633
Shall l tell you?
Sister Kanta loves Krishna very much.

306
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,803
So, this girl is jealous.
- Why should l feel jealous?

307
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:09,848
You may feel jealous.
Krishna is my best friend.

308
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:12,782
lf he goes away, even l won't like it.

309
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:15,820
But l wish that these
people take Krishna with them.

310
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,254
Childrren , arre ynou rreadyn?

311

Golu, why have you
become like a ghost?

No one applies so much of powder.

313
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:27,428
Give me some, l'll apply it.

314
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:32,263

..but there are some
rules of this orphanage too.

317
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,844
Sister, no problem.
We'll follow all the rules.

318
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:42,944
Okay, you can meet the children.

319

She is our cute child Diya.

325
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:05,761
He is Krishna, Sanskar, Vitamin..

326
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:09,204
Vitamin is not his real name.
His real name is Vineet.

327
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:11,299
We call him Vitamin with love. - Oh.

328
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:13,469
He is Golu.

Wow.. you are very intelligent.

Sister, l've told them.

You are number 1 mischievous.

338
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,399
Sister, we would like

You are not hungry?

l'm still not hungry.
So, l don't want to eat.

But sister, he is Krishna, isn't it?

377
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:42,444
l'm not talking about him,
but about Lord Krishna.

378
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:46,949
While eating food,
he used to trouble his mother Yashoda.

379
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:48,652
The same way? - Yes.

380
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:51,786
He is nothing,
but he was more stubborn.

381
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,562
More stubborn.
- No, he was so mischievous..

382
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,193
..that he was ahead of everyone.

383
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,863
He and his team used to
create a chaos in whole Gokul.

384
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:04,738
Everyone used to complaint
about him at home.

385
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:09,445
Do you want to know how he
used to trouble his mother, Yashoda?

386
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,642
Yes, sister. l want to know.
- Sister, even l want to know.

387
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,546
But l'm not getting
any answer from him.

388
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:23,917
Krishna, tell her. Tell her or
sister will not tell the story to us.

389
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:25,921
Yes, l want to know.

390
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:29,693
But there's one condition,
you have to eat food.

391
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:31,793
Sister, our Krishna
will surely eat food.

00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:35,565
You will food, won't you?
- No food, no story.

He is hungry since morning.
Poor guy. - Poor guy?

He has eaten all

woman and orphan children.

00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:24,232
Yes, so what. You think, what if

So.. what.. - Sister,

00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,734
Congratulations.
- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

507
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:56,671
Wow.

508
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:01,811
''Happy birthday to you.''

509
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:05,610
''Happy birthday to you.''

510
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:09,551
''Happy birthday dear Krishna.''

511
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:14,254
''Happy birthday to you.''

512
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:17,954
Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !

513
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:22,889
Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !

514
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:24,699
Yeah ! Yeah !

515
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:25,667
Krishna!

516
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:36,869
Sister? What's the matter?

517
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:38,608
Brother Nattu.. - Yes.

518
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:41,277
l don't know why l felt
something happened to Krishna.

519
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:44,988
l'm feeling very scared.
l hope nothing happened to him.

520
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:46,586
Nothing would've happened to Krishna.

521
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,324
Since Krishna left,
you've been only thinking about him.

522
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:50,485
That's the reason, you feel so.

523
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,625
No, brother Nattu..
it is not like that.

524
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:54,756
Sister, he must be very happy there.

525
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:57,733
They'll keep them happily.
l guarantee you.

526
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:01,595
You know, when l guarantee something,
it is true.

527
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:05,240
So, stop thinking about Krishna and..

528
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,670
..take Lord Krishna's
name and go to sleep.

529
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:12,410
orrd krrishna,
let his guarrantee be trrue this time.

530
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:13,609
He will surely do that.

531
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:17,651
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:22,485
orrd krrishna..

533
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:28,857

534
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:32,425
Brother Nattu, l shall leave now.
Goodbye. - Goodbye.

535
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:40,874
Krishna! - Brother Nattu !
- Sister Kanta, Krishna is here.

536
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,674
Hi, brother Nattu.. - Come on.

537
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:46,808
Hi, brother Nattu.. - Very good.

538
00:41:46,884 --> 00:41:48,215
Krishna?

539
00:41:48,886 --> 00:41:50,353
Please come. - How are you?

540
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,880
Greetings. - Greetings.

541
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,356
Come in , sisterr Dheepali. H ave a seat.

542
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:59,829
Krishna, how are you?
- l'm good. l'm absolutely fine.

543
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:02,832
Do you know, they had organized
a party for me last night?

544
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,735
l cut the cake.
Do you know l even danced? Like this.

545
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:12,804
Then, what happened?
- Then.. after that..

546
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:25,781
Krishna? - Dear Krishna,
what happened to you?

547
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:27,654
Call the doctor..
- What happened Krishna?

548
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:30,692
l don't remember what happened then.

549
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:35,322
You don't remember.. what do you mean?

550
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,866
Sister Kanta, we need to talk to you.

551
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,836
You go inside and play..
meet everyone.. - Yes.

552
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:44,500
Brother Nattu.. - Yes, come on.

553
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:47,669
Brother Nattu..
- How are you? - l'm good.

554
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:48,541
Have a seat.

555
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,710
What do you want to say?

556
00:42:53,985 --> 00:43:00,618
Sister Kanta,
whatever you asked us, we told you.

557
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:03,785
But you had to tell
us everything about Krishna.

558
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:07,489
Don't you think you have..
- Cheated you.

559
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,732
You want to say this, don't you?

560
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:14,803
Yes, l've cheated you.

561
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:18,474
l had to tell you
about Krishna's ailment.

562
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:22,673
But Mr. and Mrs. Mehta, he is
not suffering from any big ailment..

563
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:25,315
..by which his life is in danger.

564
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,645
He has epilepsy.

565
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:30,479
But now there are medicines
available to cure epilepsy.

566
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:33,550
Just you have to take some extra care.

567
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:35,382
This is what our doctor told us.

568
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:36,824
Sister Kanta, he has lied to you.

569
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:40,290
Krishna is suffering from such
ailment, which can never be cured.

570
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:41,888
You are telling, a little care..

571
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,928
..not a little,
but he needs care all 24 hours.

572
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:46,970
He can have an attack
anytime and anywhere.

573
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:48,838
Who will stay with him for 24 hours?

574
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:49,838
Why will anybody with him?

575
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:52,799
We took him from here thinking
he will support us in our old age.

576
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:55,245
But he himself needs
support all the time.

577
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:58,407
One minute..
so, you don't want a child..

578
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:00,817
..but ynou need a support
forr ynourr old age.

579
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:06,249
Just because you feel that Krishna
cannot support you in your old age..

580
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:10,853
..you don't want to
keep him with you, isn't it?

581
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:14,721
Okay, no problem. No problem at all.

582
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,798
l'll take care of my Krishna
all the 24 hours.. like you said.

583
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:21,337
l can take care of him.
You can leave him here.

584
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:25,433
But Mrs. Mehta, tell me something.

585
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:31,409
lf you had given birth to a child,
who was suffering from same ailment..

586
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:34,349
..which Krishna is suffering from..
what would've you done?

587
00:44:34,685 --> 00:44:35,811
Would you leave him..

588
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:39,548
..giving this logic that he
can't support you in your old age?

589
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:45,751
Mr. Mehta, you tell me.
You wouldn't have left him, right?

590
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:48,323
Because, he was your own son.

591
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,336
Forr some dayns,
ynou gave happiness to krrishna..

592
00:44:53,904 --> 00:44:55,462
..thanks a lot for that.

593
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:59,600
You can leave. - Let's go, Deepali.

594
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:21,262
Sister, my parents.
Where did they go? Sister?

595
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,768
They left. You'll stay here now.

596
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,200
But sister, they are my parents.

597
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,830
l want to go with them.

598
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:33,673
Sister, my parents left.
- They are not your parents.

599
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:36,841
They are not related to you in anyway.

600
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:23,851
Sister..

601
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:30,129
lt is too late, go to sleep.

602
00:46:32,002 --> 00:46:39,431
Brother Nattu, l cannot sleep..
as l've seen tears in Krishna's eyes.

603
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,677
Did you see how sad
Krishna's face was..

604
00:46:47,585 --> 00:46:51,954
..when Mr.
and Mrs. Mehta left him here?

605
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:53,884
Sister, you don't get tensed.

606
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,786
He will forget them
in a couple of days.

607
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:01,529
He will forget? Will he forget?

608
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:05,869
He will not forget anything.
He will remember everything and cry.

609
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:08,863
All this happened because of you.

610
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:10,435
Brother Nattu,
it is all because of you.

611
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:15,640
You told me not to tell
them about Krishna's ailment.

612
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:16,845
Don't say anything.

613
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:21,551
Hiding the truth is equal to lying.

614
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:26,913
Krishna is suffering from
epilepsy and this is the truth.

615
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:29,254
We have to live with that truth.

616
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:35,396
lf we would've told them,
what would happen?

617
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,427
They wouldn't have adopted Krishna.
That's all, isn't it?

618
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:43,134
But Krishna or we wouldn't
have endured so much pain.

619
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:48,644
lt is a different thing
if you are an orphan..

620
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,415
..but he got parents, but they
let go off him after accepting him.

621
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:58,216
Krishna would be heartbroken by this.

622
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:00,616
Do you realize that?

623
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:07,324
l made a mistake. A grave mistake.

624
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:12,632
You are right.
All this happened because of me.

625
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:14,897
This happened because of me.

626
00:48:17,308 --> 00:48:23,838
l thought.. l was wrong. l was wrong.

627
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:26,906
You can punish me the way you want.

628
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:30,245
No.. brother Nattu, l'm sorry.

629
00:48:30,988 --> 00:48:33,479
Brother Nattu, please don't cry.
Please, don't cry.

630
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:36,622
ln anger, l told you many things.

631
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:42,291
lt is not only your fault,
l'm also a part of it.

632
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,496
Whatever you thought
was for Krishna's betterment.

633
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:53,202
Our way was wrong,
but our intention was not wrong.

634
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:55,806
Please, don't cry.

635
00:48:57,448 --> 00:48:58,608
What worse can happen?

636
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:03,509
No one will adopt Krishna..
he will not get parents.

637
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:08,718
et him not get..
wre'll love him so much..

638
00:49:09,293 --> 00:49:13,787
..so much that he'll
not think about anyone. Yes.

639
00:49:14,732 --> 00:49:15,721
This is right.

640
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:20,632
Today, l guarantee this.

641
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:39,487
''l looked in the earth,
l saw the sky..''

642
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:50,690
''l looked in the earth,
l saw the sky..''

643
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:54,937
''l looked in the whole world.''

644
00:49:56,607 --> 00:50:06,482
''ln the crowd of this world,
where are you lost?''

645
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:13,253
''Why did the dream
in my eyes shatter?''

646
00:50:13,324 --> 00:50:18,819
''Why did you leave my hand suddenly?''

647
00:50:18,896 --> 00:50:24,391
''l stood seeing you helplessly.''

648
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:30,504
''Mother, where are you?''

649
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:36,240
''l looked for you in the whole world.''

650
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:41,945
''Mother, where are you?''

651
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:48,282
''l looked for you in the whole world.''

652
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:03,636
''Who do l ask here?''

653
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:09,342
''Who will tell me?''

654
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:16,948
''l've never seen my mother.''

655
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:22,253
''l've never seen any affection.''

656
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:33,500
''He has seen God who
has seen his mother's face.''

657
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:39,270
''Mother, where are you?''

658
00:51:39,343 --> 00:51:44,906
''l looked for you in the whole world.''

659
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:50,943
''Mother, where are you?''

660
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:58,826
''l looked for you in the whole world.''

661
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:16,406
You are Krishna, aren't you?
Even l'm Krishna.

662
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:25,919
But everyone worship you.
They love You. They come to You.

663
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:33,557
They want you to always
stay with them.. be with them.

664
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:38,424
But no one wants to
keep me with them. Why?

665
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:46,437
After so many days,
l met parents, but even they left me.

666
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:50,803
Why did they leave me?
Because l have ailment?

667
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:54,379
Why am l sick?

668
00:52:55,886 --> 00:53:01,188
Sister says that you
give everything to everyone.

669
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:04,158
You gave this ailment to me,
didn't you?

670
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:07,661
Why did you give me this ailment?

671
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,766
Did you give me so
that l don't get parents?

672
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:17,135
Sister told me Your story.
You had two parents.

673
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:21,537
l don't have even one.
Why is it like that?

674

01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:01,100
l will leave only
after having pudding.

848
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:05,276
You are taking from my plate?

849
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:06,679
Here, have it.

850
01:05:09,252 --> 01:05:12,153
Whenever sister makes pudding,
l'm in trouble.

851
01:05:12,488 --> 01:05:14,615
Who wants pudding?
- l want.

852
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,092
You?
- So?

853
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,650
l served you pudding
a little while ago?

854
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:20,992
l just started having pudding,
brother Nattu.

855
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:24,264
lf you started now
when will you finish it?

856
01:05:24,801 --> 01:05:26,063
Here, have it.

857
01:05:26,603 --> 01:05:27,763
Tasty, isn't it?
- l will take some pudding too.

858
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:28,503
Strange.

859
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:30,739
Krishna, give me more pudding.

860
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,205
Take.

861
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:54,392
How much will you have?
Your stomach will burst.

862
01:05:56,466 --> 01:05:58,696
Sister, l'm tried going there.

863
01:05:59,268 --> 01:06:00,326
Oh God.

864
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:04,770
What's this?

865
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:07,969
The pudding vessel is still full..

866
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:10,569
..even after the kids
had so much pudding?

867
01:06:11,047 --> 01:06:11,741
And sister.
- Yes?

868
01:06:12,048 --> 01:06:15,142
Krishna had almost 20
bowls of pudding. - Really?

869
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:17,049
Then why isn't it getting empty yet?

870
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:19,152
Sister?
- Yes?

871
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:21,019
Did you put any special
ingredient in it?

872
01:06:21,424 --> 01:06:22,550
Yes, l did.

873
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:25,992
l now realize why
they are eating so much.

874
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:28,228
l've put love.

875
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:29,792
And how many times have l told you..

876
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:32,397
..ot to cast your
evil eye on kids' food?

877
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:36,662
lt isn't love.

878
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:39,304
l feel something fishy.

879
01:06:41,244 --> 01:06:42,142
Oh no.

880
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:46,170
l hope Kalicharan's
ghost didn't posses Krishna.

881
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,615
l will not go to serve pudding.

882
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:51,347
Kids, it was fun, isn't it?

883
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:53,246
The pudding was tasty, isn't it?

884
01:06:53,322 --> 01:06:55,449
Shall l tell her l liked it too?
- No.

885
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:59,720
Krishna, didn't you like the pudding?

886
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:03,192
No, sister.
l liked the pudding very much.

887
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:05,764
But Tempo didn't like the pudding.

888
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:07,633
l see.

889
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:09,765
Why, Tempo? What's the matter?

890
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,433
No, l liked the pudding very much.
He is lying.

891
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:14,169
Oh no. You kids..

892
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:17,110
Oh yes, shall l give you good news?

893
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:19,344

894
01:07:19,415 --> 01:07:22,384
Oh. Krrish !

895
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:24,716
lt will be a lot of fun today.

896
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:40,363
Well Krishna,

897
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,662
..on hearing it all the
children became so happy?

898
01:07:44,073 --> 01:07:45,734
Krrish is a film.

899
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:49,175
Film?
- Yes, superr hit film.

900
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:51,042
Super hit? Meaning?

901
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:53,005
Super hit means..

You want to watch Krrish?
- Yes. - Okay.

Oh my God.
- Look. He runs so fast.

910
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:19,636
Wow. Wonderful jump.

911
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:21,438
Hope l could jump like him.

912
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:24,271
What a stunt?

913
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:28,210
Oh, he is running faster than a horse.

914
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:29,478
Who is he?

915
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:32,514
Talk softly. They will hear you.

916
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:34,055
Okay, but who is he?

917
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:36,387
He is Krrish.

918
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,523
Krrish.
- He is as powerful as you.

919
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:42,723
He can do many things.
He can climb trees.

920
01:08:43,032 --> 01:08:45,626
He can jump from one
building to the other.

921
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:50,603
As yours and mine,
his name is also Krishna.

922
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:52,038
He becomes Krrish later.

923
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:54,008
How?
- You will find out later.

924
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:57,006
But it is just the
character name in the film.

925
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:01,580
Otherwise, his name is Hrithik Roshan.
Hrithik Roshan.

926
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:03,141
Hrithik Roshan?

927

Yes.

Fan? What does that mean?

929
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:11,184
Krishna, you know everything.

930
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,524
Then why don't you
know the meaning of it?

931
01:09:13,596 --> 01:09:18,590
The person whom we like
very much we become his fan.

01:09:19,802 --> 01:09:22,396
Then from today,

lt is not possible.
No one can meet him.

939
01:09:38,254 --> 01:09:40,119
But l want to meet him.

940
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:42,316
l can't take you to him..

941
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:44,492

942
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,154
..and this is Gujarat.
lt is not possible.

943
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,221

944
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:53,491

l wrill not talk to ynou.

945
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:01,669
He's gone?

946
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:03,575
He should've watched the whole film.

The real fun begins now.

01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:51,688
What? Today's Krishna birthday?

952

But doctor, what has happened to them?

1138
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:17,595

..other parts of the city as well.

1142
01:23:23,412 --> 01:23:25,573
Several children have fallen
ill due of adulterated milk.

1143
01:23:25,647 --> 01:23:28,480
Adulterated milk?
- Yes, adulterated milk.

1144
01:23:30,285 --> 01:23:31,343
Oh my God.

1145
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,515
May people who do
adulteration be given..

1146
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:35,120
..such a punishment that
they don't get place even in hell.

1147
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:37,415
Relax.

1148
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:45,690
Hey Lord Krishna..

1149
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:49,566
..protect all the children.

1150
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:52,404
Now what happened, Krishna?

1151
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:53,498
You know what?

1152
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:55,406
All the children

..fallen ill drrinkin g
adulterrated milk.

1154

Moreover, several children
in the city have fallen ill.

1155
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:05,211
Please Krishna, do something. Please.

1156
01:24:07,489 --> 01:24:11,152
l think those who do adulteration
in milk should be taught a lesson.

1157
01:24:12,227 --> 01:24:18,723
7, 8, 9, 1 0, 1 1 , 1 2,
1 3, 1 4, 1 , 1 6, 1 7, 1 8, 1 9, 20, 21 ..

1158
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:22,265
What's the need to count,
brother Paddu?

1159
01:24:22,337 --> 01:24:26,205
Kalwa, do you mix less
chemical in the milk?

1160
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:29,141
l think the quantity is less.

1161
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:30,735
What to do, brother Paddu?

1162
01:24:31,046 --> 01:24:33,640
Chemical is morre expensive than milk.

1163
01:24:34,015 --> 01:24:37,610
Kalwa, you are trying
to fool Paddu Singh?

1164
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,284
lf l lose my mind, l will
make chemical out of your bones..

1165
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:44,757
..and mix in the milk.
Get away, idiot.

1166
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:46,760
Oh. So this is the case.

1167
01:24:47,395 --> 01:24:49,420
Adulteration of milk is done here.

1168
01:24:49,498 --> 01:24:52,695
Really? l will teach
them a lesson today for sure.

1169
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:56,065
Krishna, you teach them a lesson..

1170
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,504
..and l will teach
these a lesson. - Okay.

1171
01:25:02,144 --> 01:25:04,408
He is trying to fool me?

1172
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:05,605
Who, brother Paddu?

1173
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:11,243
Kalwa is trying to fool Paddu Singh.

1174
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:15,278
But my name is Paddu
Singh and not insane.

1175
01:25:16,358 --> 01:25:18,451
''Paddu's milk store.''

1176
01:25:18,527 --> 01:25:20,757
''Paddu is a cheat.''

1177
01:25:21,062 --> 01:25:24,190
Wow. Come on..

1178
01:25:28,403 --> 01:25:31,702

What's this?
Someone broke the headlight.

1181
01:26:09,544 --> 01:26:11,774
Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!

1182
01:26:17,686 --> 01:26:19,711

''l'm Krishna.''

1190
01:26:54,623 --> 01:26:56,352
Come and have a look.
- No.

Okay, don't come. Okay?

So what if he is God.
What does he think of himself?

1255
01:30:42,217 --> 01:30:44,947
Hrithik Roshan will
not come to meet everyone.

1256
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:49,688
Don't talk to me if you don't want to.
l too will not talk to you.

1257
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,321
He was Sanskar, right?

1258
01:30:54,395 --> 01:30:57,364
Sanskar! Sanskar, stop.

1259
01:30:57,432 --> 01:30:59,627
Why are you running?
- Goons are after me. - Stop!

1260
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:02,693
You too run else they
will catch you too. - Stop!

1265
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:18,243
Sanskar. - Yes?
- Why are the goons after you?

01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:20,014
And why'd they catch me too?

01:31:44,712 --> 01:31:47,545
No. You are sister Katrina, right?

1270
01:31:47,615 --> 01:31:49,549
Yes. But why are you both running?

1271
01:31:49,617 --> 01:31:51,710
Sister, some goons are after us.

Yes, l'm on my way but..

Bring the kids out

Don't mess with us.

1311

They've attacked Katrina.

1317
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:11,450
Attack? - l told you
not to mess with us, didn't l?

1318

Come on.

01:35:36,244 --> 01:35:38,735
Now.. all the goons ran away.

1320
01:35:40,515 --> 01:35:44,451
lt will be great if we
have a group snap with Katrina.

1321
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:52,685
Sanskarr, sisterr katrrina

Yes, she thrashed them hard.
l enjoyed it.

1323
01:35:56,364 --> 01:35:59,333
Tell me, Sanskar.
Who were those goons?

1324
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,493
Krishna, they were dangerous goons.

1325
01:36:01,569 --> 01:36:05,562
They kidnap children,
make them work and also beat them.

1326
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,473
They had confined me too.

1327
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:08,736
Really?

1328
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:11,040
Yes. Like me,
there are many children there.

1329
01:36:11,345 --> 01:36:13,313
What? Take me there right now.

1330
01:36:13,381 --> 01:36:15,349
No, they will confine you too.

1331
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:16,508
Just take me there.

1332
01:36:17,051 --> 01:36:18,109
Okay, let's go.

1333
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:21,155
lnspector,
this kid has seen Sanskar running.

1334
01:36:21,556 --> 01:36:23,183
Some men were after him.

1335
01:36:23,691 --> 01:36:27,718
l then called Mr. Kumar but no one
answered the call on the landline..

1336
01:36:28,095 --> 01:36:29,460
..and the mobile phone
was switched off as well.

1337
01:36:29,864 --> 01:36:31,627
l feel something fishy.

1338
01:36:31,699 --> 01:36:32,757
Please do something.

1339
01:36:33,367 --> 01:36:35,392
l'm worried about the kids.

1340
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:36,732
Do you have the man's photograph..

1341
01:36:37,104 --> 01:36:39,402
..who adopted Sanskar?
- We do have. - Yes.

1342
01:36:39,474 --> 01:36:40,634
Show it to me.

1343
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:41,732
Look.
- Look.

1344
01:36:43,211 --> 01:36:44,269
Oh my God.

1345
01:36:45,313 --> 01:36:49,306
Sister, he is not Kumar.
He is Natwarlal from Gujarat.

1346
01:36:49,584 --> 01:36:50,573
Robert D'souza.

1347
01:36:51,219 --> 01:36:52,584
He works for Angar Singh.

1348
01:36:52,653 --> 01:36:54,416
And Angar Singh is
a very dangerous criminal.

1349
01:36:55,623 --> 01:36:58,456
He uses children in
his every illegal work.

1350
01:36:58,726 --> 01:36:59,715
Oh my God.

1351
01:37:00,228 --> 01:37:02,560
But l talked with
him just 1 0 days ago.

1352
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:04,655
And he was talking
with me very nicely.

1353
01:37:04,732 --> 01:37:06,495
He also had Sanskar talk with us.

1354
01:37:06,567 --> 01:37:11,368
And regularly, he sends Sanskar's
medical report and academic report.

1355
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:13,566
So there is no scope for doubt.

1356
01:37:14,108 --> 01:37:15,132
What has happened?

1357
01:37:15,209 --> 01:37:16,608
Look, don't worry.

1358
01:37:17,278 --> 01:37:20,304
So far, we didn't have any
evidence or witness against them.

1359
01:37:21,115 --> 01:37:23,709
Now, we have evidence and witness too.

1360
01:37:23,784 --> 01:37:26,753
Yes. - Neither Robert
nor Angar Singh will get away.

And he makes many
children beg for alms..

The same way.. as Lord Krishna
was brought up by Yashoda.

Just like that.

1594
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:21,362
The mother who has a son like you,

''l'm king of Gokul.
People talk about me.''

''l can fill your mouth with sugar.

1610
02:00:40,213 --> 02:00:42,204
''Why are you called as butter thief?''

1611
02:00:42,282 --> 02:00:45,115
''Why do the girls shout
at the river banks?''

1612
02:00:45,184 --> 02:00:49,143
''The guys of Brij watch
stealthily from the trees.''

1613
02:00:49,222 --> 02:00:53,659
''l'm Krishna.''

1614
02:00:53,726 --> 02:00:58,322
''l'm Krishna.''

1615
02:00:58,398 --> 02:01:00,628
''l'm Krishna.'' - No, not that.

You do one thing, get back the temple.

1621
02:01:15,548 --> 02:01:17,448
Everyone would be
coming to play the flute.

1622
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:22,747
That's the reason,
the color of every tree is..

1623
02:01:23,823 --> 02:01:25,688
What am l doing? - Not the
color of the tree, but the leaf.

1624
02:01:26,292 --> 02:01:27,759
The color of the
petal of the rose is..

1625
02:01:27,827 --> 02:01:29,124
Then the sky..

1626
02:01:32,165 --> 02:01:37,228
