Ali and the Cops Just don't get along.

67
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,249
I hope you understand.

68
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,874

69
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,041

00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:54,708
Ali! You dropped something.

Cops. His name is Ali.

73
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,833
This powder is fake.

74
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:11,541
You said powder buddy. So it's powder.

75
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,708
There's a transmitter too.

76
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,999

Live been trapped in this
By Jai Dixit. He's crazy.

80
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,083
He conned me to come here as a cop.

81
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:30,874
I told him I didn't want
to cheat on you guys.

82
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,166
Hey! We are just like brothers,
Aren't we? Okay, I’ll leave.

83
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,916
One minute. I’ll join you

And together we'll rock man!

85
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,624
Every part in my body is illegal.
Don't mistake me for a cop.

86
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:48,333
Don't handcuff me.
I’m a thief, not a cop.

87
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:51,833
Brother, we are like
brothers. Brother. No!

88
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,249

last wish before I die.

00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,833
Promise me, after killing me you'll..

90
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,874
..shoot that lowly
Jai Dixit In the head!

91
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,583
Ever since I saw his
face, My life is ruined!

92
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,916
Finish him!
- Sit down.

93
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:12,958
Just a minute. I can't see
Myself die. Let me shut my eyes.

94
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,958
I’m going. Bye everybody.
Mummy! Someone save me please!

95
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:37,874
Now you're going to say, I saved
you. Right. I could have died, man.

96
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,999
You can't do one thing properly.

97
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,124
Every time I have to forget
The goons and save you.

98
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,791
Hey! Hey relax! I had
already taken care of them.

99
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,583
Sorry, I was just kidding.

100
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,083
I am nothing without you.

101
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,666
Like a cylinder without gas.

102
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,249
A monkey without a tail.

103
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,124
Sweetie!
- Sweetie is dead!

104
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,124
Sweetie I’m at work.

105
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,041
Later? Later You'll see
my dead body. Got it?

106
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,708
You understand nothing.
How do I explain to you?

107
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,916
Remember Jai, You have
put me in this condition.

108
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,041
It’s all because of you.

109
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,291
I am here alone at home And
you are least bothered about it.

110
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,749
What are you talking
about? What have I done?

111
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,874
Sweetie, if I keep
talking To you like this..

112
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,374
Pomfret.. Pomfret.
- What?

113
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,749
Get it from anywhere.

114
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,416
I don't know anything.
I want fish right now.

115
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,458
Hello, yes. Thank you.

116

Then how am I going?

124
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,916
Brother, save me! The
water is very cold!

125
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,791
Brother Jai! I can't swim!

126
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,666
If you take so much time to cook..

127
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,874
..I wonder how long You'll
take to change diapers.

128
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:54,874
Sweetie, that's no way to talk.

129
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:57,458
And what will you do If I talk this way?

130
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:03,833
Affair! I don't say so. My aunt
Says 90 per cent married men..

131
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,458
..have affairs When
their wives are pregnant.

132
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,458
Aunt Usha knows everything.

133
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:11,374
She delivers babies
In the entire Nagpada.

134
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,749
Now, tell me Jai, Would
you have an affair?

You think I could do that?

136
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,708
Who are you going to get
To have an affair with you?

137
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,124
Poor Sweetie. She's stuck with you..
- What do you mean?

138
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,499
I mean that a girl's got to be
nuts To have an affair with you.

139
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,916
He's right Jai. I’m
the only one for you!

140
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,916
I’m not scared Of any Seeta or Geeta.

141
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:38,416
No girl's going to
agree To go out with you.

142
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,291
Mr. Grumpy, You don't
know how to treat women.

143
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,624
And they generally
prefer poets, Like me.

144
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:48,791
Right?

145
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,374
Poet! You?

Yes, I’m a poet! Love has
no age, It has always been.

147
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,291
Love has no age, it has always been.

148
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,374
Fifteen, sixteen, Seventeen, eighteen.

149
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:05,624
Don't push it guys. I am
decent, so I don't fool around.

150
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,541
But I might just go
ahead If I wished, okay?

151
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,541
Alright. Go ahead, have an affair.

152
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,208

"Come on, come on, baby."

159
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,083
ACP Shonali Bose reporting, sir!

160
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:17,333
Wait here, I’ll send the
officer In charge of this case.

00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:19,499
He is our best man.
- Sir.

162
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:05,374
Hello, how do you do?

163
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:08,208
Some style!

164
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,874
You're the one with the
handcuffs on And you're asking me?

Take it easy. I’m a cool headed
guy. Everybody makes mistakes.

167
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,874
But if you cooperate with me
then, Everything will be fine.

168
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,916
Cops and criminals
Should be like couples..

169
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,958
..you know, like a husband and wife.

170
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,499
Once that happens, the world
Will be a better place and..

171
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:35,958
..all crime will vanish. Just like that!

172
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,749
Shut up! I’m not a criminal!

173
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:44,749
Look, you better speak up darling,
Because when Ali 'entrygates..'

174
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,208
Interrogates.

175
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:50,124
Yes, that's the word. When
I do what you just said..

176
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,124
..the toughest of criminals
Confess everything.

177
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,416
Get that! Now speak up. You got it?

178
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,708
You're a cop?

179
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:03,624
Well, I know I look like an actor.

180
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:07,041
But actually I am a cop.
Ali Akbbar. Sub-inspector.

181
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,791
Just remove my handcuff.
It got stuck by mistake.

182
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,666
Don't try to fool me darling!

183
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,166
Handcuffs are not something..

184
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,958
..that you put on by
mistake. Tell me the truth.

185
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,333
Because of you. Well,
they were in my hand.

186
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:23,208
I was moving it aside When
you opened the door suddenly.

187
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,624
And this thing..

188
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:25,916
It doesn't happen like that, darling.

189
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,374
You were moving it aside, right? And..

190
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:33,958
Oh, I was just 'entrygate'.

191
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,333
She has committed some
crime But not admitting it.

192
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,583
Her name is..
- Shonali Bose

193
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,541
Jai Dixit? I don't believe this!

194
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:46,124
Shonali Bose. Roll number 23.
- Jai Dixit, Mr. Long Legs.

195
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:47,999
The boy who never dared to go in..

196
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,624
..the swimming pool
Because of his long legs.

197
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,458
I didn't want to give
You any competition..

198
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,374
..because everybody
Would come to see you.

199
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,333
You are a show off.
- Show off and me?

200
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,083
And the girls' hostel?
Pooja Mehta's room.

201
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,249
Weren't you caught Sneaking in there?

202
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,583
Yes, right. I remember. You still
Owe me 25 rupees for the bet.

203
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,416
So good to see you.
- 7 years, 7 months..

204
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,624
Wow! You know The exact number of days?

205
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,708
Yes, I do. Once a girl dances with you..

206
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,041
..she can never ever
forget you, That's for sure.

207
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:29,916
Jai and dance! No
way? I mean, Jai.. You?

208
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,166
Anyway. What are you doing here?

209
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:39,374
A! The smartest And
coolest thief in the world.

210
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:44,458
Smart because he dares
To do the impossible and..

211
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:51,208
..cool because he leaves no clue
Behind. Only his symbol, "A".

212
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,916
We don't have anything
Else apart from this.

213
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,749
No description? No sketch?
- Nothing, sir.

214
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,999
From Rio De Janeiro to
Jaipur, All the heists he..

215
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,458
..has pulled off were in disguise.

216
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,416
He stole the Queen's antique
Crown disguised as the Queen.

217
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,624
He is the master of disguises.

218
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,583
And no one knows How he
vanished from the train.

219
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,749
Excuse, Ali to say. Since the
robbery Took place on a train..

220
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,624
..shouldn't the case
Be under the Railways..

221
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,541
For the last 2 years, I have
been following Mr. A's case.

222
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:23,791
He always robs things that
Are rare, almost priceless.

223
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,791
A diamond from London,
Painting from Paris..

224
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,791
..necklace from the crown
Of the prince of Istanbul.

225
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,333
But he's got to be selling all this
Priceless stuff somewhere. Right?

226
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:35,708
Unfortunately, we don't know What
he does with the stolen goods.

227
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:40,624
Every year he works just about
3-4 months and then disappears.

228
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:44,374
Is there anything else,
Like a pattern or something?

229
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:47,166
What is significant Is the way he robs.

230
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,624
And he's Committed The
thefts so randomly..

231
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,749
..that it's impossible
To find a pattern.

232
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,749
There is a pattern, Shonali.

233
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:02,208
What is interesting Is the signature.

234
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,749
That's what he leaves
behind At each crime scene.

235
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,458
But what he's really after..

236
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,833
..is to leave his mark
All over the world.

237
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,166
And that's not all.

238
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:27,541
1 4th July 2006. The
date of the next robbery.

239
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,249
How do you say that?

240
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:39,791
Besides antiques, Mr. A is
fascinated by numbers too.

241
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:45,916
Seoul: 5/4/2004. If you
add up all the numbers..

242
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:53,916
..5+4+2+4=1 5, you get the date
For the next robbery, 1 5/7/2004.

243
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:57,749
Once again, the total adds
up to 28. And the next..

244
00:24:57,834 --> 00:25:02,416
..robbery at Australia
on 28/9/2005. Total 44.

245
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,791
When the total exceeds 30 He adds the total, 4+4.
- 44!

246
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:17,416
8. The next robbery: 8/1/2006..

247
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:20,749
..the date of every robbery lies
In the date of the previous robbery.

248
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,916
Mr. A is making every
effort To Challenge us.

249
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,499
But the problem is that Nobody
understood his challenge.

250
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,041
But you got it. Fantastic!

251
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,666
And the train robbery
Took place on the..

252
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,958
.. 1/5/2006, Total: 14.

253
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,124
The next robbery is going
To take place on 1 4th July..

254
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,958
..Mumbai.
- How's that?

255
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,208
Because he wants to make the
symbol 'A' on the world map..

256
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,624
To complete the 'A'.. The
line must cross Mumbai..

257
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:58,583
We better get cracking
Before he gets here.

258
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:02,583
If I am not wrong, He's already here!

259
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:17,833
And if my guess is right,
He's one step ahead of us.

260
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,708
Mr. A always robs in disguise..

261
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,041
..and yet he wants the whole
world To know who he is.

262
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:38,041
The signature says it all.

263
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:51,583
He thinks he's an artist, Not
a thief. An unknown artist!

264
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:58,916
Such an artist, Though he
is amongst us, is hidden!

265
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:19,666
You can't look for him.
You can only catch him.

266
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:29,208
But nabbing such a smart
thief Is going to be tough.

267
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,833
Perfect!

268
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,874
He's the perfect thief!

269
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:04,458
Create excitement!

270
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,833
It’ll be great meeting you, Mr. A!

271
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:08,666
Everybody say..

272
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,916
I think we will have fun.

273
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,083
"We want the fury."

274
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:18,124
In college, I never thought a girl
Like you would join the police force.

275
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,541
Your peppers.
- Thanks.

276
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,958
Why did you feel that way?

277
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,624
Dressing.

278
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:30,666
No, no. You were such a sissy. I mean..

279
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,624
..you wouldn't talk to
anyone, And stuck up.

280
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:37,291
I would talk to you though..

281
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,958
That's because you were
secretly In love with me.

282
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:48,749
I’m still in love with you.

283
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:57,291
Whatever you do, Don't think of divorce.

284
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:01,291
Divorce is bad for family life.

285
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:05,874
Not divorce, I’m thinking of murder.

286
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,083
If you don't mind. - No.
- I’ll just be back.

287
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,041
Your fish.

288
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,083
Sweetie, your husband is too sexy.

289
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,458
And he is such a great cook.

290
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,583
How did you manage to trap him? Tell me

291
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,249
You've got to see this.

292
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,749
Sho! You were like An
ugly duckling in College.

293
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:29,791
What rubbish! I was the hottest girl
In college! I was the most wanted.

294
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,291
Give me a break! Did you see yourself?

295
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:37,374
Look, who is this?
Who's looking dumb here?

296
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,791
Anybody would look stupid In a sarong.

297
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,624
You wore a sarong?

298
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:42,791
Must have been a bet. Right?

299
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,374
Bingo! Bet for 1 0 bucks.

300
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,041
Whose sarong was it?

301
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,666
Hers. Naturally!

302
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:53,291
Sho! Remember that. Parrot green dress.

303
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,874
You still have that?
- What?

304
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,416
There's a college reunion
Party tomorrow. Class of '96.

305
00:29:58,792 --> 00:29:59,874
And everyone's going to wear what..

306
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,708
..we used to wear in
college. So, I thought..

307
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,291
Reunion!

308
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:06,708
Yes. And now you're in town. We
will go together, it will be fun.

309
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:08,666
But I have nothing to wear.

310
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,124
Why don't you borrow
One of Sweetie's clothes?

311
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,791
No problem, come, I will show you. Come.

312
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,499
2 murders instead of 1 , the
Punishment remains the same, right?

313
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:31,124
No Sweetie, I vowed to
mummy That I’ll keep..

314
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,833
..away from trouble and women.

315
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,708
But for you and your family, Montu..

316
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:37,916
..Ali part two, I’ll
break that promise.

317
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:40,041
What are you talking about, Ali?

318
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,958
I have a plan. I’m going To
make her fall in love with me..

319
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:46,124
..and then she'll forget
Jai. Ali will charm her..

320
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:48,208
And your family will be fine.

321
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,041
But how are you going to do that?

322
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:51,499
Like this.

323
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:32,708
O Baby!

324
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,708
My love!

325
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:42,124
O Baby!

326
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:44,291
My love!

327
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:50,791
The fire in your eyes burns
me Through and through.

328
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:55,458
So don't look at me like that.
My senses come crashing through.

329
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:59,916
The fire in your eyes burns
me Through and through.

330
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:04,916
So don't look at me like that.
My senses come crashing through.

331
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:09,499
If my heart loses It's self-control..

332
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:13,833
..there'll be no end
To the rock and roll.

333
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:22,791
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

334
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:27,708
Don't stand so close to
me. I feel a lot of fear.

335
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:32,291
With every word you say, I
can sense that love is near.

336
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:36,916
Don't stand so close to
me. I feel a lot of fear.

337
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:41,749
With every word you say, I
can sense that love is near.

338
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:46,374
If my heart loses its self-control..

339
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:50,708
..there'll be no end
To the rock and roll.

340
00:32:50,792 --> 00:33:00,041
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

341
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:25,916
O Baby!

342
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:37,166
I’m drawn to you.
I just can't help it.

343
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:46,083
Between our swaying bodies,
Let there be some distance.

344
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,041
This crazy heart of mine
Now only wants romance.

345
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:55,624
If my heart loses its self-control..

346
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:59,958
..there'll be no end
To the rock and roll.

347
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:09,458
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

348
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:27,458
My love!

349
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:36,666
My charm!

350
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:43,833
We must both resist the
temptation We can dare.

351
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:48,874
Let's hold back a little,
Love is in the air.

352
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,624
Deep in my heart There's
a kind of burning.

353
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:02,541
Can't say no to love,
My mind keeps on turning.

354
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,958
If my heart loses its self-control..

355
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:11,541
..there'll be no end
To the rock and roll.

356
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:20,666
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

357
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:25,416
The fire in your eyes burns
me Through and through.

358
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,916
So don't look at me like that.
My senses come crashing through.

359
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,624
Don't stand so close to
me. I feel a lot of fear.

360
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:39,374
With every word you say, I
can sense that love is near.

361
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:43,999
If my heart loses its self-control..

362
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:48,416
..there'll be no end
To the rock and roll.

363
00:35:48,500 --> 00:36:09,624
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

364
00:36:53,917 --> 00:37:08,999
"Dhoom."

365
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,583
All Cameras working,
Samar? - Yes, ma'am! - Good.

366
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,291
Go there.

367
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:45,208
Two snipers on that roof.
All escape routes blocked.

368
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,791
And what if he doesn't show up?

369
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,541
Jai, you said that in
Mumbai, There are only..

370
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,624
..two places he can strike And
we have both the places covered.

371
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:01,916
Hello.

372
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,416
Fried Bombay duck or spicy clams?
- What?

373
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,208
You must have had tea
At the Taj Mahal hotel..

374
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,916
..but you wouldn't
Have tried the fried..

375
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:10,124
..Bombay duck at Basheer's
Restaurant. Hmm, best!

376
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:13,083
After lunch We will have some dessert.

377
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,916
You can go for ice-cream If you want.

378
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,916
Basheer is my friend So
he won't charge extra..

379
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:19,958
..but remember one thing, Sho.

380
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:26,708
Please don't let Mr. Grumpy
Know our plan, alright?

381
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:30,916
Come quick, I’m waiting
for you. I’m starving.

382
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,083
You need to get kicked, right?

383
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:38,291
Hey mummy! At least you
Should give me a warning.

384
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,416
You're on duty, not on a picnic.

385
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,416
The thief is not going to ask you.

386
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,833
Brother Ali, are you done
With your lunch? Can I rob now?

387
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:48,916
And anyways the robbery Is not going..

388
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,916
..to happen here Or you
wouldn't have sent me here.

389
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,833
I know you don't think
Very highly of me.

390
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,916
Shut up and stay alert! Ok?

391
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,749
Can I grab some snacks From the corner?

392
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:00,916
Quick!

393
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:07,541
What's the matter Jai?

394
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:14,249
I don't know, Sho,
but.. Something is wrong.

395
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,499
I can just feel it!

396
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,624
Come on, Mr. A. Where are you?

397
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:28,916
Come in, unit one.
Everything ok on your side?

398
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,999
All right. Report to me.

399
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:23,874
"Dhoom."

400
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:37,916
Look, there is no need For
explanation. Follow my orders.

401
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:40,041
Do as I have told you.

402
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:43,624
No! No! No! Follow the
briefing I gave you.

403
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:49,291
Ok? And Unit number 2. Please come in.

404
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:55,458
Listen. I want you to Check
All the exit points. Ok. Yes.

405
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:58,749
And see to it that every
guard Is in his place.

406
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,958
All right? Over.

407
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:28,291
"Dhoom."

408
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:52,541
"Dhoom again the way with me."

409
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:08,666
It’s beautiful, isn't it?
- Right.

410
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,083
But I’ve heard the owner
Was even more beautiful.

411
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,916
Oh absolutely!

412
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,541
And she had a temper too.

413
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:20,458
They say that one day
She was so upset with..

414
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:24,749
..Shahjahan that she threw it away..

415
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:31,374
.. And she chucked it so hard,
The central piece went missing.

416
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,249
Sho, he's not going to come here.

417
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:46,833
He robs things that are perfect
And this necklace is damaged.

418
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,041
He's not coming, let's go!
- You go Jai.

419
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:53,541
What if you're wrong? Someone
Should be here to welcome him.

420
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:06,124
Ali, the robbery's going to happen
At the museum. Get there! Quick!

421
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,708
Oh my God! I’m on my way!

422
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,249
Ali, where have you reached?

423
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:18,999
Close the gate!
- Yes, sir.

424
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:23,041
Secure all the exit points and report To me every 5 minutes
- Okay.

425
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:27,249
"Dhoom."

426
00:43:31,334 --> 00:43:33,124
Sorry uncle.
- Who are you saying sorry to?

427
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:37,666
I banged into an old man, a
cleaner. You drive me nuts, man!

428
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,958
Stop him!
- What?

429
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,541
Stop him now!

430
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:41,916
But he's just a Cleaner.

431
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,666
I cancelled the shift
For the Cleaning staff!

432
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,124
He shouldn't be there!

433
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,874
Stop! Police!

434
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:56,833
Shoot him, knee cap! Come
on, fast! I said stop him!

435
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,708
Stop, uncle!

436
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:03,916
He has stopped.
- Check his I .D. And hold him. I’m just getting there.

437
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:09,791
I would have shot you.
Why didn't you stop?

438
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:11,124
What?

439
00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:14,916
Put on a hearing aid. You
could have lost your life.

440
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:20,916
Yes. I have a slight
Hearing problem, son.

441
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:23,458
You should stop when a cop says so.

442
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:26,166
Now, what are you doing here?
Your shift was cancelled.

443
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,666
At this age, I forget my name sometimes.

444
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,749
How do you expect me To remember shifts?

445
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,708
Come on, show me your l-Card.

446
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:39,999
What?

447
00:44:40,084 --> 00:44:42,499
L-card,
dear, l-card.

448
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:00,124
What's your name?

449
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:03,499
It’s written behind.

450
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:12,624
Where did he go?
- Where did he go?

451
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:17,749
Oh my God! He has fooled us!

452
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:22,624
Do you know how to swim?

453
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:31,416
"Create excitement."
- Open the gate!

454
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:52,374
"Create excitement."

455
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:13,916
Hey, look at him.

456
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,666
Oh God. Where did he go?

457
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:31,333
"Once again."

458
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,916
"Once again, "Dhoom."

459
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:46,874
"Once again."

460
00:47:06,084 --> 00:48:27,124
"Create excitement."

461
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:37,458
Ali. Come in. He is among
the crowd. North Block.

462
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:38,916
Ok, brother Jai.

463
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:55,916
"Dhoom."

464
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:02,416
"Let's greet it."

465
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:06,791
"Shall we seek it? Keep up the spirit."

466
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:09,458
"Let it go. Let it go."

467
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:11,874
"Let's greet it."

468
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,124
"Shall we seek it?"

469
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:26,833
I’m leaving town. I am resigning.

470
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:31,083
Great! The thief and you,
Both are leaving town.

471
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:34,499
Very similar, you guys. Interesting.

472
00:49:36,459 --> 00:49:39,958
Jai, I was there instead
of you, Chasing him.

473
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:41,291
What if?

474
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,083
Mauser .9mm: Bullet
speed: Three thousand..

475
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:49,791
..feet per second. A man
can never run away from it.

476
00:49:50,334 --> 00:49:55,916
Shonali, my job is to catch
thieves, Not to kill them.

477
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:59,208
One thief dead, is one thief less.

478
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:04,666
Power lies here, not in there.

479
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:07,583
We are wasting our time
standing And talking here.

480
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:10,083
Mr. A must be leaving the city.

481
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:15,666
"Dhoom."

482
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,541
Excuse me, ma'am. This is my
ticket. I’m on the waiting list..

483
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,083
Sorry, but the flight is full.

484
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,708
Ma'am, tomorrow is my tennis match.

485
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:24,499
Listen, I have to go today.

486
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:26,958
Excuse me, I said, The flight's full.

487
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:28,749
If there is any cancellation,
I will let you know.

488
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,499
Now please, go and sit there.

489
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,124
You're wasting your time.

490
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:39,708
Father, if God existed, I
would have been on this flight.

491
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,583
For the last three years, Live
been winning the championship.

492
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:48,416
God knows that. And now
someone else Will take my place.

493
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,791
'After robbing a rare
diamond Worth three millions..

494
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,624
..what is the thief planning next?'

495
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:56,499
'May the not say, But
we are telling you.'

496
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:00,416
TV!

497
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,958
Just a few minutes ago,
Mr. A called our news desk..

498
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:05,333
..and informed us of his next
robbery At the Junagarh Palace..

499
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:08,416
..and that he will Rob the 600 year..

500
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,833
..old antique sword
In the next 24 hours.

501
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:15,749
Before the phone could be
traced He disconnected it.

502
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:17,958
I must say, Mr. A's got style.

503
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,416
I suggest we strike a deal
with him And settle things off..

504
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,208
..because we won't be able To
Catch him for sure. Ali to say!

505
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:26,916
Will the police nab him
After this information?

506
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,708
There's only one champion, remember.

507
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:32,958
No one can take his place.

508
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:38,499
Not even God!

509
00:51:38,584 --> 00:51:42,249
"Create excitement."

510
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:43,999
"Let's greet it."

511
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:48,124
"Shall we seek it? Keep up the spirit."

512
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:57,208
"Create excitement."

513
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:09,958
I want cover on all the four corners.
- Yes, sir.

514
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:32,583
Sometimes it goes off
by itself, You know?

515
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:38,666
Means you'll just kill me?

516
00:52:39,709 --> 00:52:42,791
If you really want to
sleep, Why not forever?

517
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:45,916
Joke!

518
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,999
You can't do anything About the thief.

519
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,291
If he slips off from our hands
In day time, catching him..

520
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:57,374
..at night is next to
impossible. And anyways Sho..

521
00:52:57,709 --> 00:52:59,458
..I doubt if he's going To show up here.

522
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,916
He must be robbing
someplace else For sure.

523
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:08,749
If he comes here, he's never
Going to leave. That I promise.

524
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:13,458
If he's Mr. A, He will
come here for sure.

525
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:16,374
But how?

526
00:53:28,667 --> 00:54:09,124
"Dhoom."

527
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:11,458
One's an original, the other isn't.

528
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:20,666
But it's difficult
to see that, Isn't it?

529
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:31,458
Well it was tough to get here..

530
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:35,208
..but from here on,
It only gets tougher.

531
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:39,874
No! Don't even think about it!

532
00:54:57,167 --> 00:55:00,999
Yes, infra-red beams.

533
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:04,666
If anything crosses
those beams, An alarm..

534
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:08,208
..comes on and the guards
Will be here in 30 seconds.

535
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:15,333
See the pillars?
Electromagnetic stunners.

536
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,499
I love this so much!

537
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,624
They're quite deadly..

538
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:23,833
..as soon as you lift the
sword.. A strong current..

539
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,374
..of 2000 volts will shoot out..

540
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:32,124
..you'll land up either
in jail Or in hospital.

541
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,583
May I?

542
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:44,041
Confused?

543
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:49,874
How will it be stolen?

544
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:53,374
Shall I tell?

545
00:55:56,584 --> 00:55:59,583
"Dhoom."

546
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:03,333
The fake one for you..

547
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,916
.. And this one, for me.

548
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:32,541
Go for the sword, when I say so.

549
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:49,041
You shouldn't have done that.

550
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,291
Now I’m going to
have To Come after you.

551
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:23,333
Stop!

552
00:57:24,834 --> 00:57:27,333
Jai. I got him.

553
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:51,249
"Create excitement."

554
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:07,708
What's this, mummy! One thief
was tough to handle and..

555
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:14,041
..you sent another one!
Now we've had it! Sorry!

556
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:43,333
'Sexy lady on the floor.'

557
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:45,874
'Keeps you coming back for more.'

558
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:53,208
I am so hot! Don't you
feel hot in all this?

559
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,124
Are you like..

560
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,208
'Sexy lady on the floor.'

561
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:06,708
'Keeps you coming back for more.'

562
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:09,416
'Sexy lady on the floor.'

563
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,833
'Keeps you coming back for more.'

564
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:19,999
Are you like.. Checking me out?

565
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:26,708
Behind your mask, I hope not.

566
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:30,624
Because if you are, Then you've had it

567
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:33,458
And you'll have a lot to regret.

568
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:38,624
You won't be able to walk..

569
00:59:38,834 --> 00:59:41,166
And your job needs Some running around.

570
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,749
Is there a reason for using
my name For the robbery?

571
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:48,374
You! You are the
reason. You're the best!

572
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,458
I mean, besides me No
one else would admit it..

573
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:52,791
..but Sunehri. No, not at all.

574
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:55,708
Sunehri's a fan of yours. Like forever.

575
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,833
But you know who the next best is?
- Sunehri.

576
00:59:59,917 --> 01:00:04,291
Ok, Su - neh - ri. The Golden
Girl! Who lives in Bombay..

577
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:08,958
..but thinks of Amsterdam,
Australia. America even.

578
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,124
Let's hear what Sunehri thinks.

579
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,291
Do you play cricket? I mean..

580
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,249
Who are the best opening
batsmen In the world?

581
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:20,041
Not Saeed Anwar, Aamir Sohail,
Not Hayden or Gilchrist.

582
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:23,916
Tendulkar, Sehwag.
- Funny guy!

583
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:27,791
Not just diamonds. Like..
You read thoughts as well.

584
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,749
Cool! Anyways.

585
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:37,833
I have a motto. Less talk, more
work. So tell me, when do we start?

586
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:43,541
Start?
- You and me, Tendulkar, Sehwag. Partners.

587
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:46,874
Together we can be quite a team.

588
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:51,749
Thank you. But I’m better off alone.

589
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:57,333
Everybody needs a partner In this world.

590
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:02,666
Someday even you'll need one.
And this is a golden chance.

591
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:08,166
Golden! Sunehra means golden. Get it?

592
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:19,541
You've seen my work. I’m
really good. Come on..

593
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:21,333
..take me.

594
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:25,583
I am a worthy thing, trust me.

595
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:32,333
I don't trust anyone.

596
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:46,458
In principle, you robbed using
My name. So, the loot's mine too.

597
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,666
Funny guy!

598
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:56,541
You can keep the sword.
It’s a gift from me to you.

599
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,124
But then, think about it.

600
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:05,416
Today a sword, Tomorrow
it could be a diamond.

601
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:08,083
Last chance.

602
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:11,916
Pull off the mask shake hands.

603
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,499
Like partners.

604
01:02:19,084 --> 01:02:23,666
You're good at what you do,
So I’ll give you some advice.

605
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:31,416
Thieves shouldn't have partners.
Stay alone, you'll stay alive..

606
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,666
..because if you're alone there's
No chance of getting betrayed.

607
01:02:38,834 --> 01:02:40,499
Not even by your own self.

608
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:55,083
"She is sexy. You are the man."

609
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,083
"Sexy lady on the floor."

610
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:04,708
"Keeps you coming back for more."

611
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:07,333
"Sexy lady on the floor."

612
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,749
"Keeps you coming back for more."

613
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:25,416
Slowly and slyly You've stolen my heart.

614
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:30,999
You weave the magic
of Your love around me.

615

I don't let it show.

622
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:37,166

01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:45,333
Live fallen for him.

626
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:47,749
Somebody please let him know.

627

This love, I slowly accede.

628
01:04:51,959 --> 01:04:54,541
The waiting that must precede..

629
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:57,041
..in my love for you.

630
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,749

01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,749
'Moving out through the

636
01:05:54,459 --> 01:05:56,916
I went from here.

637
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,541
All the way to there.

638
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:02,333
Can't get you out of my head.

639
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,833
Here, there and everywhere.

640
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:07,208

01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:09,874
All the way to there.

642
01:06:10,084 --> 01:06:12,833
Can't get you out of my head.

643
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:15,333
Here, there and everywhere.

644
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:19,333
Be it dusk or be it dawn.

645
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:21,916
Thoughts of you just turn me on.

646
01:06:21,959 --> 01:06:24,499

Slowly and slyly You've stolen my heart.

Think of you all the way.

653
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:05,999
Memories of you.

654
01:07:06,084 --> 01:07:07,541

Hey! Are you like.. Checking me out?

658
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,208
Same dialogue. Tendulkar, you?

659
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:54,333
From what I’ve heard, You
leave town after every robbery.

660
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:58,916
What made you stay back this time?

661
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,291
Wanted to find out For myself whether..

662
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,291
..you imitate me in basketball too.

663
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:19,708
Less talk, more work.

664
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:37,499
Not bad.. For a girl.

665
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:40,583
Oh no.

666
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:43,999
Sunehri was wrong about you..

667
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,166
..thought you were Not like other boys.

668
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,499
But.. All boys are the same.

669
01:09:50,584 --> 01:09:51,874
Funny guys.

670
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:58,624
Know a lot of boys?
- Jealous?

671
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,249
Yes. I know that look.

672
01:10:03,334 --> 01:10:06,374
You were going to say
something But you forgot.

673
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:13,374
It’s not your fault. Sunehri
has that effect on people.

674
01:10:15,709 --> 01:10:17,833
I think you're forgetting something.

675
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,083
What?
- The game's not over!

676
01:10:53,084 --> 01:10:55,499
Had enough?
- No way!

677
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:52,916
Funny guy. You're not a bad player
So I’ll give you some advice.

678
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,374
Get yourself a partner If
you want to go a long way.

679
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,624
This is An international game Sunehri.

680
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:26,499
You need to play it with
your head, Not with the heart.

681
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:30,999
Continue like this, You'll
be right here forever.

682
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:35,458
Not Amsterdam. Not Australia..

683
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,208
..and definitely not America!

684
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:41,458
With a teacher like you,
Sunehri will learn everything.

685
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,541
Think again. You are not
Just going to be my partner.

686
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:56,541
You'll have to be my shadow. And
you'll never be able to leave.

687
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:06,499
What happened? Nothing to say?

688
01:13:06,584 --> 01:13:11,583
Shadows don't speak. They
just follow. Silently.

689
01:13:18,334 --> 01:13:22,291
Silent? You?

690
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:26,541
This one I have got to see.

691
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:33,374
Hey! What do I call you?
- Funny guy!

692
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:50,416
Jai you shouldn't have..

693
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:56,041
Surprise! It’s me
Ali and flowers for you.

694
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:58,874
A fool is as different From
a flower as you are from Jai.

695
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:02,499
Let me tell you something,
Sho. Just forget about Jai.

696
01:14:02,584 --> 01:14:05,499
Jai is in deep trouble And
whatever he said about..

697
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:07,624
..the thief was all
wrong But I had my doubts.

698
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,874
I always knew they were two of them.

699
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,374
We had thieves like these
back home, Bheem and Nadeem.

700
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:16,624
One would steal from the back
pocket And the other from the front.

701
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:19,499
What is the point?
- Point noted to be.

702
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:22,416
Now we have two thieves So
we need two honest officers.

703
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,624
Very honest.

704
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,333
You and me.

705
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:28,916
And what about Jai?

706
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,083
Jai's future is not looking
too good. You got injured.

707
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:35,291
The thief got away. What else?

708
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,041
Jai has to be suspended.

709
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:40,374
Where's Jai?
- He's taken Sweetie To the gynecologist.

710
01:14:40,459 --> 01:14:43,458
She's going to have a baby.
Do you want to have a baby too?

711
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:48,791
Mummy! No! No baby!

712
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:05,249
You're always late!

713
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,708
Why are you.. Like always early?

714
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:13,416
I like to see things from the start,
Whether it's a film or a robbery.

715
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:15,666
Any more information?

716
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,958
Why don't you ask him
yourself? He is coming here.

717
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:23,083
I am sure. If you speak to him
Sweetly, he'll tell you everything.

718
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:25,958
6 months ago a girl was
About to get arrested..

719
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:29,291
..but she was spared
Because she pleaded with..

720
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,458
..a kind police officer For forgiveness.

721
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:36,333
'Sir please, I will do
anything To help the police..

722
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:39,416
..but I don't want to go to jail.

723
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:45,749
I am working on it. What else do
You want me to do? And I am good.

724
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:50,791
He's taken me on as a partner.
Now you can arrest him.

725
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:54,291
For taking you on as a partner?

726
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:58,916
Don't try to use your
intelligence. You don't have much.

727
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:01,874
Now remember, We can
only arrest him when..

728
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:06,999
..he's committing the
robbery. Not before nor after.

729
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:13,458
And what if he finds out That
Sunehri is working for you?

730
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:18,833
The end. He'll kill you.

731
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,374
There is always that Gap
between a thief and a cop..

732
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:27,958
..and you bridge that gap.

733
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,916
Right. That's where I’m stuck.

734
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:48,833
How's the film, Sehwag?

735
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,083
You've changed your appearance again.

736
01:16:55,792 --> 01:16:58,249
Sunehri can never recognize you.

737
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:03,166
I’m known for my work
And not for how I look.

738
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,166
And I am on a holiday, So don't worry.

739
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,541
I know you.

740
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,458
Popcorn?

741
01:17:20,959 --> 01:17:23,374
After the interval You'll
take a taxi to the airport.

742
01:17:24,959 --> 01:17:26,916
There's a ticket and a
passport In your popcorn packet.

743
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:30,208
Passport?

744
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:35,458
I told you. It’s
an international game.

745
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:46,749
"Create excitement."

746
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:51,999
"Create a storm.." Once again.."

747
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:56,833
Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to Rio.

748
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:00,541
Are you sure this is the place?

749
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,583
Are you very sure
That this is the place?

750
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:07,249
Ali, if you ask me The
same question ten times..

751
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:09,416
..the answer is not going to change.

752
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,583
Sho has given me the
address, Copacabana.

753
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:13,999
So, it must be this.

754
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:19,374
She's done really well.
What a place! Coca banana.

755
01:19:19,459 --> 01:19:20,749
Am I right?

756
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:23,999
Since the time she's come,
Life has only gotten worse..

757
01:19:24,084 --> 01:19:28,083
..and now we have to
Live with her sister.

758
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:32,041
I mean, we'll stay with
her But where is she?

759
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:36,083
We are surrounded by hot chicks.

760
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:44,208
Coca banana, here I come!
Yippee! Hello to Ali! Hello, item!

761
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:46,416
Sho had said ask
Anyone around the place.

762
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,166
Everyone knows.

763
01:19:48,334 --> 01:19:50,874
Everyone is fine. But who do we ask?

764
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:54,458
Coca banana.

765
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,791
Can you give me the ball, please?

766
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:00,541
Oh my God! Is that allowed?

767
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:02,583
Can you give me the ball, please?

768
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,624
Should I ask the one in yellow?

769
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:07,208
Her swim wear matches
The color of my bike.

770
01:20:07,292 --> 01:20:10,791
Loll ask her. Hello! Hi!

771
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:22,458
"l want to.."

772
01:20:23,209 --> 01:20:26,791
"l want to shake it, till you drop."

773
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:29,958
"l want to.."

774
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:34,124
"l want to shake it, till you drop."

775
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:38,124
Shonali's sister, Monali Bose.

776
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:47,208
You knew?
- What?

777
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,708

778
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:08,791

01:21:09,334 --> 01:21:13,041

"l want to shake it, till you drop."

782
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:27,999
Hello, mia kaza. How are you my darling?

783
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:30,874
Did you miss me? My sweetie pumpkin?

784
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:39,624
I say hello to my house.
Some people find it weird.

785
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:43,333
Hello. You can say hi
To people you live with..

786
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:47,749
..so why not houses? And
I mean I live in my house.

787
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,458
What do you think? Ko liya..

788
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:56,249
Hello house! What's up, everything ok?

789
01:21:57,584 --> 01:22:02,458
You know in India, I do the
same Thing. I say hi to my bike..

790
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:05,166
..my toothbrush, my fridge,
I say hi to everything.

791
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:08,874
Oh my gosh! Really? We are so similar!

792
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:11,791
But you didn't introduce
me To your house.

793
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:12,999
How will it recognize me?

794
01:22:13,084 --> 01:22:15,124
Oh I’m so sorry.

795
01:22:15,209 --> 01:22:20,624
Housie, housie, This is
Ali and this is Jai. Jai.

796
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:24,791
Jai, say hello. Say, say hello, house!

797
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:30,124
You know guys? I love India
And Indians and you know what?

798
01:22:30,209 --> 01:22:34,791
We all have to hang out together
Because we are all Indians.

799
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,749
But there's one sad thing.

800
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:40,333
I know.. You don't know
How to speak Hindi, right?

801
01:22:40,417 --> 01:22:42,958
Gosh! How did you guess it?

802
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:45,083
Are you an astrologer or something?

803
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:48,124
Mechanic! He's a mechanic.

804
01:22:48,209 --> 01:22:50,999
Have I been looking for you or what?

805
01:22:51,084 --> 01:22:54,374
I know I’m in demand.
Internationally..

806
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,958
Can you fix my hair dryer, please?

807
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:57,791
I can fix an airplane too..

808
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:03,166
..the one we came in had
trouble. I fixed it on the spot.

809
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,833
Manero!

810
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:21,999
Don't even think about it. She
doesn't know a word of Hindi..

811
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:24,499
..and God help your English!

812
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,958
It’ll take you 20
years Just to get started.

813
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:32,916
So what if my English is poor?
I speak the language of love.

814
01:23:33,959 --> 01:23:39,374
Ali, you have come here as
A cop not as a lover boy.

815
01:23:43,334 --> 01:23:44,749
Where are the rooms?

816
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,291
Ali, get the luggage.

817
01:23:54,084 --> 01:23:56,916
Is he ok?
- He is a nut case.

818
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:59,333
You know, he doesn't seem right.

819
01:23:59,417 --> 01:24:02,083
He is a nut case. You know nut case?

820
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:03,833
Crazy.
- Crazy.

821
01:24:05,584 --> 01:24:10,749
Ali, you know I am so glad
You guys are staying with me.

822
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,791
You know I haven't been
To India for so long..

823
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:15,416
..and with you guys around..

824
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,374
..I feel closer to home. Thank you.

825
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:38,208
What an emotional girl!

826
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:43,999
Thank you mummy, for sending Monali!

827
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,416
Her name too has Ali in it.

828
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:38,916
Not bad! Dinner?

829
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:58,374
The food is fantastic!
Like.. It's really nice.

830
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:01,583
Don't force yourself.

831
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,958
You want something else?

832
01:26:06,042 --> 01:26:09,291
Do you have some regular food?

833
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,333
It is very unhealthy.

834
01:26:15,459 --> 01:26:16,624
Sure!

835
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:30,583
You don't look like a cook.

836
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:32,916
You too do not look like a thief.

837
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:37,499
And anyway, This is not my real face.

838
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:59,874
Sunehri, can I ask you something?

839
01:27:06,042 --> 01:27:07,833
In an unknown place..

840
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:15,333
..with an unknown
guy, Aren't you scared?

841
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:21,624
Sunehri might not recognize you..

842
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,333
..but she definitely knows you.

843
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:29,833
You can change your face But
you cannot change yourself.

844
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:33,874
I’m a thief. I can Change myself.

845
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,208
I’m a thief too.

846
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:41,833
The first time we met
I just saw your eyes.

847
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:44,416
Even now I still know them.

848
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:51,333
You might be a thief
But your eyes are honest.

849
01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:56,208
Really?
- I could be wrong.

850
01:27:58,709 --> 01:28:04,249
There's something About
you that tells me..

851
01:28:04,334 --> 01:28:08,124
..you'll never harm me.

852
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:12,041
Sunehri trusts you.

853
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:15,333
I trust you.

854
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:24,083
Now, can I ask you something?

855
01:28:29,834 --> 01:28:31,416
Do you trust me?

856
01:28:38,667 --> 01:28:42,374
Enough conversation for
one night. Time to sleep.

857
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:45,749
Training at 6 a.m. Tomorrow.

858
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:51,791
Yes. 6 a.m. Sharp!

859
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:59,291
Funny guy!

860
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:19,624
Hello, You guys haven't even started?

861
01:29:19,709 --> 01:29:21,874
Come on, hot leavened bread!

862
01:29:22,542 --> 01:29:24,791
She looks totally Indian, man!

863
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:26,416
Mummy would have been
thrilled To have met you.

864
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,749
Really? I would love to meet her.

865
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:31,916
You know? I love Indian food! Delicious!

866
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,791
This is cottage cheese-butter
Goulash, that's butter chicken..

867
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:38,916
..and this is my favorite.. Black lentil soup.
- Mine too.

868
01:29:39,084 --> 01:29:41,041
How about some poison?

869
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,958
Don't you have any poison?

870
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:47,166
Sorry I missed something.

871
01:29:47,459 --> 01:29:50,541
You know, I keep forgetting
Your name all the time.

872
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:54,708
Jai. He loves the food.

873
01:29:54,792 --> 01:29:56,833
It’s just that he's not Used
to traveling around the world.

874
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:58,958
His stomach is upset.

875
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,208
Ok, you take one more.

876
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,833
If we have to eat this food anymore..

877
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:10,458
..then I’m surely going to the
hotel And you'll go to the hospital.

878
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:11,916
Tell her this.

879
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,458
What did he say?

880
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:17,708
He's suffering.

881
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:22,124
I know. You know? I
understand everything you say..

882
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:24,874
..but him! I just don't get him.

883
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:27,999
Is that what's called a nut case?

884
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:30,666
You're too smart!

885
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:35,166
Loll get you two more
rolled breads. Loll be back.

886
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:47,749
What are you watching?
So you're in love?

887
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,999
No. That happened In the morning itself.

888
01:30:54,209 --> 01:30:58,458
Jai, I must confess.
This is my last case.

889
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:02,958
After this, I’m going to quit.

890
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:06,666
Monali will find it
hard To adjust in India.

891
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:11,333
We plan to have a small house here..

892
01:31:11,417 --> 01:31:13,708
..and live happily Ever
after with our kids..

893
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:16,249
Happy family, export family!

894
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,583
Have you given Monali the good news?

895
01:31:25,292 --> 01:31:28,041
No. Not now. Tomorrow.

896
01:31:28,959 --> 01:31:31,499
My mummy always said That one should..

897
01:31:31,584 --> 01:31:35,124
..always declare one's love In
the morning. Fresh and early.

898
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:04,499
Most thieves work at
night. Like.. Bit different.

899
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:43,708
From today, Nothing
will be hidden from you.

900
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:49,166
Neither my face, nor my name.

901
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:54,374
Aryan!

902
01:33:00,834 --> 01:33:03,124
No one has seen this face till date.

903
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:08,958
Neither have I ever
Trusted anyone so much.

904
01:33:11,084 --> 01:33:15,166
From now on, We live
and die for each other.

905
01:33:20,792 --> 01:33:23,499
Sunehri you have to
not only Be my shadow..

906
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:26,208
..but also my reflection.

907
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:32,208
From now on, everything you
see Will be through my eyes.

908
01:33:41,709 --> 01:33:47,374
I trust you. Do you trust me?

909
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:54,208
Then jump! Jump!

910
01:34:29,417 --> 01:34:30,833
Funny guy!

911
01:34:56,167 --> 01:34:58,041
Excuse me to please.

912
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,249
My name is Ali.

913
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:09,249
Please listen to me.

914
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:12,416
Don't steal my heart And
then walk away from me.

915
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:16,833
Excuse me to please.

916
01:35:16,917 --> 01:35:20,666
I don't get sleep any more.

917
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:24,583
I fear I may not breathe no more.

918
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:27,791
In my heart you've created a furor.

919
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:48,041
Excuse me to please.

920
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:25,124
A man.
- What?

921
01:36:25,834 --> 01:36:29,333
A simple man.
- Is it true?

922
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:37,374
I don't know, sweetheart,
What's happening to me.

923
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:41,416
Your magic does play its part.

924
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:45,291
It’s driven me crazy from the start.

925
01:36:45,417 --> 01:36:48,333
Burning flames of passion In my heart.

926
01:36:48,709 --> 01:37:08,583
Excuse me to please.

927
01:37:47,292 --> 01:37:49,958
You are..
- Yes.

928
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:53,833
My ultimate desire.
- Cool.

929
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:58,249
I am so totally lost.

930
01:37:58,417 --> 01:38:01,541
So lost in your love.

931
01:38:02,167 --> 01:38:05,916
My heart skips a beat.

932
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,666
It cannot now retreat.

933
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:12,874
Surviving the night In itself is a feat.

934
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:28,416
Excuse me to please.

935
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:34,666
My name is Ali.

936
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:36,624
Please listen to me.

937
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:39,874
Don't steal my heart And
then walk away from me.

938
01:38:40,042 --> 01:38:43,791
Excuse me to please.

939
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:48,041
I don't get no sleep no more.

940
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:51,833
I fear I may not breathe no more.

941
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:55,041
In my heart you've created a furor.

942
01:38:55,417 --> 01:39:18,124
Excuse me to please.

943
01:39:36,709 --> 01:39:39,208
Excuse me. May I sit here?

944
01:39:47,334 --> 01:39:49,791
Sorry if I disturbed you.

945
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:55,333
Indian. You don't look it.

946
01:39:57,834 --> 01:39:58,916
Vijay.

947
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:01,541
Amit.

948
01:40:13,292 --> 01:40:15,166
My secret ingredient.

949
01:40:15,584 --> 01:40:17,958
The difference between Regular
coffee and perfect Coffee.

950
01:40:18,042 --> 01:40:20,249
You seem to be quite A
connoisseur of coffee.

951
01:40:20,334 --> 01:40:21,999
Is that your work too?

952
01:40:22,209 --> 01:40:24,374
Coins actually.

953
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:29,291
I collect coins.

954
01:40:31,042 --> 01:40:34,624
Money. You're after money.

955
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:36,916
I guess you Can say that!

956
01:40:37,834 --> 01:40:40,374
Funny. I too was thinking About a coin.

957
01:40:40,584 --> 01:40:42,249
Reminded me of my grandfather.

958
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:47,333
He used to give me a coin every
Sunday and say, have a blast.

959
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:51,249
That coin is quite similar To this dime.

960
01:40:51,334 --> 01:40:56,166
Hmm.. They don't make them
anymore. That's a rare coin!

961
01:40:56,834 --> 01:40:58,541
That's a rare grandfather!

962
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,083
That's for you.. -Thank you.

963
01:41:10,209 --> 01:41:14,041
So.. What's your obsession?

964
01:41:14,417 --> 01:41:16,916
Stories. I’m a writer.

965
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:19,124
What kind of stories?

966
01:41:19,209 --> 01:41:23,291
All kinds. At this
moment, We too are a story.

967
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:26,666
Two Indians, Ten thousand
miles away from home.

968
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,333
Coffee and conversation.

969
01:41:28,417 --> 01:41:34,041
I like it. But don't you need
A heroine for a popular story?

970
01:41:34,417 --> 01:41:39,166
There is one, but I don't know
Where she is and what she's doing.

971
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,791
I have no idea.

972
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:42,958
Excuse me.
- Yes.

973
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,541
I’m running late,
Maybe a Couple of hours.

974
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,624
Should I come straight to the villa?

975
01:41:51,709 --> 01:41:53,499
Sure. I will see you there.

976
01:41:53,584 --> 01:41:54,749
Alright!

977
01:41:55,459 --> 01:41:56,749
Girls!

978
01:41:59,542 --> 01:42:02,916
Why are stories
incomplete Without women?

979
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:06,249
Life without women Is not a life at all.

980
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:10,916
Everyone needs someone.

981
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:18,708
Earlier I used to think differently,
But now, I agree with you.

982
01:42:19,084 --> 01:42:20,249
Excuse me.

983
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:26,624
Live got two hours. I can meet you now.

984
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:29,208
Superb! Same place! One hour!

985
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:33,083
Girls!

986
01:42:37,292 --> 01:42:39,249
Thank you for the coin!

987
01:42:40,667 --> 01:42:44,458
The next time we meet, we should
Have something else to drink.

988
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:47,291
If we meet, definitely.

989
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:48,916
I hope so.

990
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,499
Cheers!
- See you.

991
01:42:50,834 --> 01:42:53,083
"Dhoom."

992
01:43:04,584 --> 01:43:09,999
I can now recognize him.
I have seen his real face.

993
01:43:12,084 --> 01:43:13,208
Good.

994
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:16,916
It takes one thief to know another.

995
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:22,416
Aryan is not just a thief.
- Aryan! Nice name.

996
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:24,583
And his sun sign?

997
01:43:30,667 --> 01:43:33,166
Get this straight. For
me, Aryan's just a thief.

998
01:43:33,292 --> 01:43:37,416
And you're going to
Help me nab him, right?

999
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:41,624
Of course. Sunehri was just..

1000
01:43:41,709 --> 01:43:46,833
..and anyway, you're the one who
Asked me to get to know him well.

1001
01:43:46,917 --> 01:43:51,041
Get to know him! Not
get a life with him.

1002
01:43:52,084 --> 01:43:55,041
Only you can tell me What Aryan's up to.

1003
01:43:57,209 --> 01:44:00,374
He's going to strike
very soon. I can sense it.

1004
01:44:01,709 --> 01:44:05,708
So, after you've caught
him, Loll be free, right?

1005
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:09,333
Loll think about that later.

1006
01:44:11,459 --> 01:44:15,666
Though he's a thief, I can trust him.

1007
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:18,749
But you? I don't think
so. You are a cheat.

1008
01:44:22,917 --> 01:44:29,374
You have to choose. A thief You
can trust or a cop you can't.

1009
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:34,833
Now leave. And remember.

1010
01:44:34,917 --> 01:44:38,208
In this case, You are
Aryan's biggest weakness..

1011
01:44:38,292 --> 01:44:42,499
..and my biggest strength.
I am counting on you.

1012
01:44:50,584 --> 01:44:56,041
"A friend betrayed me."

1013
01:44:56,459 --> 01:45:00,583
"Love betrayed me."

1014
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:02,666
"Life, I don't trust you anymore."

1015
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:08,499
Brother, you've found a girl
For yourself, so I am leaving.

1016
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:11,458
If you drive so slowly,
I will miss my flight.

1017
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:15,124
Ali.
- Ali is dead.

1018
01:45:15,834 --> 01:45:18,833
A heart attack would
Have been less painful.

1019
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:20,583
Ali is a fool.

1020
01:45:21,667 --> 01:45:25,124
You were like my brother,
I’d do anything for you..

1021
01:45:25,209 --> 01:45:29,458
..sacrifice my life for you,
But you don't respect me.

1022
01:45:29,542 --> 01:45:31,374
If I didn't respect you,
Then why would I get you here?

1023
01:45:31,459 --> 01:45:33,749
For fun, I’m a jester right?
You thought let's take Ali..

1024
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:35,666
..he's good fun. He'll make us laugh.

1025
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,416
And that woman Sunehri,
She'll do all the work.

1026
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,833
Just wait and watch
What she does to you.

1027
01:45:39,917 --> 01:45:45,083
Mr. Jai, just wait and watch,
She'll make a fool of you.

1028
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:50,999
Ali, I think you look nice
With a cap. You chiraou!

1029
01:45:51,334 --> 01:45:54,749
Did you hear that? She
hardly knows me and..

1030
01:45:54,834 --> 01:45:58,041
..yet she cares for me
and you, Look what you did.

1031
01:45:58,125 --> 01:45:59,333
Ali, I was about to tell you.

1032
01:45:59,417 --> 01:46:01,083
When? After arresting him?

1033
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:02,624
Or after that girl gets the
medal For catching the thief?

1034
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:05,916
Ali..
- I not talk to you. Not talk l!

1035
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,249
I had a dream too. That we'll
catch the thief together.

1036
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:12,333
But unfortunately, he saw your face.

1037
01:46:13,125 --> 01:46:14,833
And if headquarters got To know this..

1038
01:46:14,917 --> 01:46:17,208
..they wouldn't have
allowed you To Come here.

1039
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:21,791
I had to involve Sunehri
And save our mission.

1040
01:46:24,334 --> 01:46:29,166
You will arrest the thief, you
Will get the medal and promotion..

1041
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:31,541
..you will get married,
You will have kids.

1042
01:46:31,625 --> 01:46:33,541
The whole world will look up to you.

1043
01:46:33,625 --> 01:46:36,666
But I think my dreams Won't come true.

1044
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:42,124
But dreams are just dreams.
And you are leaving..

1045
01:46:42,209 --> 01:46:48,583
Enough. These are the
dreams You had for me?

1046
01:46:49,209 --> 01:46:54,666
Yes. After all, you are the
one Who's taught me to dream.

1047
01:46:55,875 --> 01:46:56,999
Jai brother..

1048
01:46:57,084 --> 01:46:59,624
Hello, guys somebody hug me too.

1049
01:46:59,709 --> 01:47:04,166
Our friendship is forever.

1050
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:12,124
We'll be friends till we die.

1051
01:47:13,584 --> 01:47:16,374
"Dhoom."

1052
01:47:23,084 --> 01:47:29,208
Nice place! Cool. But why are we here?

1053
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,333
To rob.

1054
01:47:33,834 --> 01:47:35,749
To rob?

1055
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:39,374
But here, What are we going to rob here?

1056
01:47:42,417 --> 01:47:45,583
Isn’t this guy too small to rob?

1057
01:47:56,292 --> 01:47:57,416
This?

1058
01:47:59,334 --> 01:48:00,499
Why?

1059
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,458
The first chapter In
the history of money.

1060
01:48:05,875 --> 01:48:07,999
This is where it all began.

1061
01:48:08,875 --> 01:48:12,916
The very first coins made by man.

1062
01:48:16,334 --> 01:48:17,749
The first ever!

1063
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:21,874
And they are priceless!

1064
01:48:24,584 --> 01:48:27,708
They don't cost much, I bet.

1065
01:48:28,084 --> 01:48:31,083
I could get you these coins On
the streets of Bombay itself.

1066
01:48:31,167 --> 01:48:32,833
We didn't have to come
All the way to Brazil..

1067
01:48:32,917 --> 01:48:34,458
150 crores!

1068
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:41,541
The starting bid will be 1 50 Crores!

1069
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,666
You can very well
imagine Where it'll end.

1070
01:48:50,459 --> 01:48:52,166
What have you decided?

1071
01:48:55,709 --> 01:48:56,833
When?

1072
01:49:00,459 --> 01:49:01,541
Tomorrow.

1073
01:49:30,209 --> 01:49:32,333
"Dhoom."

1074
01:49:37,167 --> 01:49:38,458
That's quick!

1075
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:45,041
He's super-fast. You
should nab him soon.

1076
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:52,291
You'll be with him During the robbery.

1077
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:54,791
Signal me as soon as he strikes.

1078
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,916
How?

1079
01:50:04,542 --> 01:50:07,583
You just have to press
this And I will do the rest.

1080
01:50:34,125 --> 01:50:36,458
From today we'll be like this.

1081
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:38,083
Hand in hand.

1082
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:39,958
I trust you.

1083
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:42,249
I trust.

1084
01:50:46,042 --> 01:50:47,666
What are you up to?

1085
01:50:49,667 --> 01:50:52,999
I was making coffee.

1086
01:50:53,084 --> 01:50:55,499
Coffee. Allow me.

1087
01:51:00,167 --> 01:51:03,541
What would you feel If I were to die?

1088
01:51:05,084 --> 01:51:10,083
Sorry. Stupid question.
We all have to die someday.

1089
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:21,541
But what if I die tomorrow?

1090
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:30,708
Why do you say that? You are the best!

1091
01:51:37,334 --> 01:51:39,416
But, Sunehri the truth is that..

1092
01:51:40,709 --> 01:51:42,958
..today for the first time In my life..

1093
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:49,291
What will happen tomorrow?

1094
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:54,208
What do you think Will happen tomorrow?

1095
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:02,041
Tomorrow? Sunehri lives
Life one day at a time.

1096
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:04,624
You know, That's what I like about you.

1097
01:52:06,375 --> 01:52:07,499
Coffee?

1098
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,208
Really.

1099
01:52:09,417 --> 01:52:11,624
You know I have Learnt a lot from you..

1100
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:13,499
..and look at me.

1101
01:52:13,875 --> 01:52:16,166
I think too much and don't
live My life to the fullest.

1102
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:19,041
Think.. Think.. Think.. And look at you.

1103
01:52:19,125 --> 01:52:23,833
That's the way to be! What
an attitude! Fantastic!

1104
01:52:25,167 --> 01:52:28,791
So, no more boring stuff,
This coffee, this cooking.

1105
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:31,291
Health food, nothing safe.

1106
01:52:32,709 --> 01:52:37,083
Now let's live life to the fullest!

1107
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:41,416
So, what do you say?

1108
01:52:44,042 --> 01:52:50,958
Let's party!

1109
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:53,124
"Create a storm."

1110
01:53:57,417 --> 01:54:00,499
"Dhoom."

1111
01:54:13,209 --> 01:54:16,791
Jai Dixit! ACP, Mumbai police.

1112
01:54:17,334 --> 01:54:19,708
Real name and real job.

1113
01:54:22,417 --> 01:54:26,874
Aryan, my true name. My
job, I’m sure you know.

1114
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,624
Been chasing you for a long time.

1115
01:54:31,959 --> 01:54:33,999
You've really made me run.

1116
01:54:34,709 --> 01:54:37,749
If it's you chasing, One has to run.

1117
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:43,249
And then, I like being chased.

1118
01:54:49,959 --> 01:54:51,833
I was just wondering..

1119
01:54:51,917 --> 01:54:55,208
..what if you give up
The idea of robbing?

1120
01:54:55,292 --> 01:55:00,124
Bad idea! If all the thieves Give
up robbing, what will cops do?

1121
01:55:02,292 --> 01:55:06,374
Everyone needs a job to survive, Right?

1122
01:55:06,584 --> 01:55:09,749
But what if the job
kills you? What's the use?

1123
01:55:09,834 --> 01:55:13,999
I mean, I will really feel
Bad if I have to kill you.

1124
01:55:16,334 --> 01:55:19,333
True, I’ll feel bad
too If you kill me.

1125
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:28,041
But if I don't get killed,
Will I have to kill you?

1126
01:55:32,542 --> 01:55:36,833
I guess you have to do your
job And I have to do mine.

1127
01:55:37,084 --> 01:55:38,833
The funny thing is..

1128
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,708
..a man's work becomes his
destiny. And your destiny's..

1129
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,333
..not looking too good, my friend.

1130
01:55:48,584 --> 01:55:49,999
Don't be too sure of that.

1131
01:55:50,084 --> 01:55:52,124
I like your confidence.

1132
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:53,708
I like you.

1133
01:55:55,084 --> 01:55:56,874
May the best man win!

1134
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:05,166
And how are we going to decide that?

1135
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,749
Oh simple.

1136
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,999
We'll do what my dad always did..

1137
01:56:18,084 --> 01:56:21,749
Your Coin, but the win will be mine.

1138
01:56:21,834 --> 01:56:24,124
"Dhoom."

1139
01:56:52,167 --> 01:56:53,291
"Love. "

1140
01:56:54,584 --> 01:56:56,916
"Burn your heart."

1141
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,208
"Love. "

1142
01:56:59,292 --> 01:57:01,541
"Burn your heart."

1143
01:57:01,625 --> 01:57:05,999
Don't ever fall in love, It’ll
only give you a heartache.

1144
01:57:06,334 --> 01:57:10,916
Giving your heart to the heartbroken
Will only lead to heartbreak.

1145
01:57:11,042 --> 01:57:15,499
Don't ever fall in love, It’ll
only give you a heartache.

1146
01:57:15,709 --> 01:57:20,208
Giving your heart to the heartbroken
Will only lead to heartbreak.

1147
01:57:20,459 --> 01:57:25,124
No one believes it, no one knows it.

1148
01:57:25,209 --> 01:57:29,208
But I now know that.
Love takes your life away.

1149
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:32,166
"Dhoom, just take my life."

1150
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,374
"Dhoom, just break my heart."

1151
01:57:34,459 --> 01:57:36,624
"Dhoom, just tear apart."

1152
01:57:39,209 --> 01:57:41,541
"Dhoom, just take my life."

1153
01:57:41,625 --> 01:57:43,833
"Dhoom, just break my heart."

1154
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:46,458
"Dhoom, just tear apart."

1155
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:49,833
"Come, take my life."

1156
01:57:51,125 --> 01:58:00,333
"Dhoom.
- Yes, "Dhoom."

1157
01:58:09,834 --> 01:58:14,416
Love is a gift. A gift from above.

1158
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:18,624
Each of us once has fallen in love.

1159
01:58:18,709 --> 01:58:21,333
Love's an obsession.
Love’s an addiction.

1160
01:58:21,417 --> 01:58:23,708
Love is soothing. Love is joy.

1161
01:58:23,792 --> 01:58:25,999
A call from the heart.

1162
01:58:26,084 --> 01:58:28,124
You know this.

1163
01:58:28,209 --> 01:58:33,083
This love is forever.
I hope it never ends.

1164
01:58:33,167 --> 01:58:38,083
All my love is for you, sweetheart.
Believe me when I say this.

1165
01:58:38,167 --> 01:58:42,791
No one believes it. No one knows it.

1166
01:58:42,875 --> 01:58:46,916
But I now know that Love
takes your life away.

1167
01:58:47,542 --> 01:58:49,833
"Dhoom, just take my life."

1168
01:58:49,917 --> 01:58:52,124
"Dhoom, just break my heart."

1169
01:58:52,209 --> 01:58:54,541
"Dhoom, just tear apart."

1170
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:58,416
"Come, take my life."

1171
01:59:36,959 --> 01:59:41,583
Who knows? This moment
may never come again.

1172
01:59:41,667 --> 01:59:45,708
Right here, right now.
May never come again.

1173
01:59:45,792 --> 01:59:50,749
This love takes you higher.
This love's a desire.

1174
01:59:50,834 --> 01:59:55,124
This love is a fire.
This love takes you far.

1175
01:59:55,209 --> 02:00:00,124
Love starts a fire, Then puts it out.

1176
02:00:00,209 --> 02:00:05,124
Love is loyalty, then it's
a doubt. Love is a sentence.

1177
02:00:05,209 --> 02:00:09,874
No one believes it. No one knows it.

1178
02:00:09,959 --> 02:00:14,124
But I now know that Love
takes your life away.

1179
02:00:14,584 --> 02:00:16,916
"Dhoom, just take my life."

1180
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,166
"Dhoom, just break my heart."

1181
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:21,541
"Dhoom, just tear apart."

1182
02:00:21,917 --> 02:00:25,583
"Come, take my life."

1183
02:00:26,375 --> 02:00:27,708
"Love."

1184
02:00:28,709 --> 02:00:29,958
"Burn your heart."

1185
02:00:31,084 --> 02:00:32,249
"Love."

1186
02:00:33,375 --> 02:00:34,958
"Burn your heart."

1187
02:00:35,709 --> 02:00:40,083
Don't ever fall in love. It’ll
only give you a heartache.

1188
02:00:40,459 --> 02:00:44,791
Giving your heart to the heartbroken,
Will only lead to heartbreak.

1189
02:00:45,167 --> 02:00:49,874
No one believes it. No one knows it.

1190
02:00:49,959 --> 02:00:54,041
But I now know that Love
takes your life away.

1191
02:00:54,542 --> 02:00:56,916
"Dhoom, just take my life."

1192
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,208
"Dhoom, just break my heart."

1193
02:00:59,292 --> 02:01:01,374
"Dhoom, just tear apart."

1194
02:01:04,125 --> 02:01:06,249
"Dhoom, just take my life."

1195
02:01:06,334 --> 02:01:08,624
"Dhoom, just break my heart."

1196
02:01:08,709 --> 02:01:11,041
"Dhoom, just tear apart."

1197
02:01:11,292 --> 02:01:15,208
"Come, take my life."

1198
02:01:15,792 --> 02:01:23,749
"Dhoom."

1199
02:01:40,584 --> 02:01:42,374
What a beautiful day, Sunehri!

1200
02:01:45,167 --> 02:01:46,458
Beautiful!

1201
02:01:51,125 --> 02:01:52,541
It’s a perfect day!

1202
02:01:54,709 --> 02:02:00,749
It’s a perfect day! Perfect
betrayal, perfect death!

1203
02:02:03,334 --> 02:02:04,541
Just perfect!

1204
02:02:07,084 --> 02:02:11,666
Why are you saying all this?

1205
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,249
Sorry.

1206
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:19,749
Do I have to take permission
To talk from Jai Dixit?

1207
02:02:22,542 --> 02:02:24,874
Try to understand..

1208
02:02:26,167 --> 02:02:30,708
..that's not what it is. Trust me.

1209
02:02:32,667 --> 02:02:33,833
Okay.

1210
02:02:37,625 --> 02:02:39,499
So then, Why don't you explain it to me.

1211
02:02:42,125 --> 02:02:47,458
You were sent here by Jai.

1212
02:02:50,042 --> 02:02:51,583
You were planted!

1213
02:02:54,792 --> 02:02:55,874
Yes.

1214
02:02:55,959 --> 02:02:58,624
And with your help Jai
Would get me, right?

1215
02:03:05,542 --> 02:03:10,166
If it were you in my place,
Would you have trusted me?

1216
02:03:12,625 --> 02:03:13,708
No.

1217
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,791
A bullet and a gun Are like partners..

1218
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:24,833
..and the bullet never Betrays the gun.

1219
02:03:27,209 --> 02:03:29,749
And wherever it hits,
It takes away life.

1220
02:03:34,959 --> 02:03:36,291
I love that.

1221
02:03:40,459 --> 02:03:45,583
Only you have the right
To take my life Sunehri..

1222
02:03:47,667 --> 02:03:48,874
..not Jai.

1223
02:03:51,542 --> 02:03:52,791
So please..

1224
02:03:57,334 --> 02:03:58,833
..do the need full.

1225
02:04:04,125 --> 02:04:06,833
I can't!
- You will have to.

1226
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:13,249
In this game of trust and
betrayal, There are rules.

1227
02:04:13,334 --> 02:04:16,958
After every betrayal,
Someone has to die.

1228
02:04:17,625 --> 02:04:23,916
Then why not Sunehri? I’m
the one who's betrayed you.

1229
02:04:25,125 --> 02:04:26,374
You are right.

1230
02:04:40,042 --> 02:04:41,249
Shoot!

1231
02:04:45,334 --> 02:04:48,708
Come on, Sunehri, pick up the gun.

1232
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:52,333
Pick up the gun, Sunehri.

1233
02:04:55,792 --> 02:04:57,333
I said shoot, damn it!

1234
02:05:07,042 --> 02:05:09,083
Death too has betrayed me.

1235
02:05:34,209 --> 02:05:36,083
Why are you doing this?

1236
02:05:37,542 --> 02:05:40,499
Everything has an end to it.

1237
02:05:46,667 --> 02:05:48,749
This is the result..

1238
02:05:51,125 --> 02:05:55,583
..of what you have done.

1239
02:05:57,125 --> 02:05:59,124
Don't make me do this.

1240
02:06:00,875 --> 02:06:02,624
You can't escape it.

1241
02:06:16,709 --> 02:06:19,583
For the first time I
am not afraid of death.

1242
02:06:22,167 --> 02:06:24,916
Death is here, wearing your face..

1243
02:06:26,625 --> 02:06:30,624
..then Sunehri is ok, like forever.

1244
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:46,541
The last bullet. Finally, death is mine.

1245
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:52,416
I’m a thief Sunehri.

1246
02:06:54,167 --> 02:06:57,249
I have Changed my face many
a time To Cheat this world.

1247
02:07:00,292 --> 02:07:02,708
But you changed my whole life.

1248
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:09,749
It’s only right If
I die in front of you.

1249
02:07:11,375 --> 02:07:16,624
Please, don't let me down At this stage.

1250
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,208
Sunehri would rather die..

1251
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,874
..but won't betray you.

1252
02:07:25,667 --> 02:07:26,958
I love you.

1253
02:07:38,584 --> 02:07:45,333
You can't take your
life, It belongs to me.

1254
02:07:47,167 --> 02:07:53,249
I hate you! I hate you!

1255
02:07:57,292 --> 02:07:58,374
I know!

1256
02:08:10,125 --> 02:08:12,041
How far would you go with me?

1257
02:08:16,334 --> 02:08:17,791
I am your shadow..

1258
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,874
..and shadows can Only follow silently.

1259
02:08:29,209 --> 02:08:34,416
Quiet and you?

1260
02:08:40,917 --> 02:08:42,874
This one I have got to see.

1261
02:08:53,792 --> 02:08:57,583
Hello everyone. Welcome to

1269
02:09:54,334 --> 02:09:56,041
All weapons are concealed.

1270
02:10:46,084 --> 02:10:48,291
Don't run!

1271
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:52,499

1278
02:11:20,125 --> 02:11:21,666
Why is your phone off?

1279
02:11:36,042 --> 02:11:38,041
Everyone's been searched. Nothing at all

1280
02:11:38,125 --> 02:11:39,499
How can that be? Was
everyone searched properly?

1281
02:11:39,584 --> 02:11:41,999
Yes, Jai. Except the children,
Everyone's been searched.

1282
02:11:42,084 --> 02:11:43,833
Ali I told you to..

1283
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,499
Wait a minute!

1284
02:11:51,167 --> 02:11:53,041
Didn't Snow White have seven dwarfs?

1285
02:12:01,209 --> 02:12:02,833
Loll look there..

1286
02:12:10,709 --> 02:12:14,416
Brother, full house empty.
Looks like they're gone.

1287
02:12:23,542 --> 02:12:24,624
Hello.

1288
02:12:24,709 --> 02:12:26,374
'You had once asked me..

1289
02:12:26,542 --> 02:12:29,499
.. To choose the cop or thief.'

1290
02:12:31,875 --> 02:12:34,208
'Sunehri has made up her mind.'

1291
02:12:34,834 --> 02:12:36,416
I’m coming for you.

1292
02:12:37,709 --> 02:12:39,624
Find yourself a place to hide..

1293
02:12:40,334 --> 02:12:44,916
..because once I’m done
with you, You all are done for!

1294
02:12:50,834 --> 02:12:53,041
Now, both have had it!

1295
02:12:55,917 --> 02:13:36,166
"Dhoom, once again."

1296
02:13:41,292 --> 02:13:49,624
"Dhoom."

1297
02:13:53,584 --> 02:13:56,083
"Create a storm."

1298
02:14:38,959 --> 02:14:42,416
"Dhoom, once again."

1299
02:14:50,959 --> 02:15:34,249
"Create a storm."

1300
02:16:29,584 --> 02:16:35,166
"He's made me crazy."

1301
02:16:51,375 --> 02:16:59,374
"Dhoom, once again."

1302
02:17:43,500 --> 02:18:28,999
"Create a storm."

1303
02:20:46,459 --> 02:20:50,708
This is the end Aryan, let's go now.

1304
02:20:52,834 --> 02:20:55,291
Have you ever loved someone deeply?

1305
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:01,416
Put your hands up, and start walking.

1306
02:21:02,542 --> 02:21:05,583
Can you love someone
enough To take their life?

1307
02:21:05,667 --> 02:21:11,791
I don't care, Aryan. But if you
Love yourself, then start walking.

1308
02:21:17,334 --> 02:21:22,499
Can you love someone
enough To take their life?

1309
02:22:36,125 --> 02:22:37,333
Why?

1310
02:22:43,334 --> 02:22:45,333
Because I loved him.

1311
02:22:53,709 --> 02:22:58,999
Get lost, Sunehri. Your
punishment is your life.

1312
02:23:00,917 --> 02:23:06,583
Alone, you'll never betray
anyone. Not even yourself.

1313
02:23:34,542 --> 02:23:39,583
Hey Nick, here's your coke
And burger with pickles.

1314
02:23:39,667 --> 02:23:41,083
Just the way you like it.

1315
02:23:41,167 --> 02:23:42,708
You are amazing, Sunderi.

1316
02:23:42,792 --> 02:23:43,916
Charles.

1317
02:23:48,917 --> 02:23:51,041
Enjoy.
- Hey where's my order?

1318
02:23:51,125 --> 02:23:53,624
Chicken and vegetables coming up.

1319
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,416
What the.. Funny guy!

1320
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,916
Sorry ma'am, But the cook's on strike.

1321
02:24:07,459 --> 02:24:08,541
What?

1322
02:24:09,667 --> 02:24:13,291
My contract clearly states that
I get a kiss every half hour.

1323
02:24:14,167 --> 02:24:18,749
It’s over an hour now.
And no kiss yet. I quit!

1324
02:24:20,459 --> 02:24:25,499
Really! I’m not that kind of girl.

1325
02:24:30,584 --> 02:24:34,749
Well, there's just One way to find out.

1326
02:24:35,084 --> 02:24:36,874
And, how's that?

1327
02:24:37,959 --> 02:24:42,833
A little bit of this
And a little bit of that!

1328
02:25:03,834 --> 02:25:05,249
How about a beer?

1329
02:25:13,625 --> 02:25:17,541
Can you love someone
enough To take his life?

1330
02:25:19,834 --> 02:25:21,291
Don't think so.

1331
02:25:24,292 --> 02:25:28,333
Because the one Who
loves doesn't take life..

1332
02:25:29,125 --> 02:25:30,833
..but sacrifices their life.

1333
02:25:32,209 --> 02:25:37,208
That day Sunehri gift wrapped
Your life in that bullet.

1334
02:25:39,959 --> 02:25:41,291
Masterstroke!

1335
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:48,249
I felt bad when You were
falling off that cliff..

1336
02:25:48,625 --> 02:25:53,999
..and I said to myself, what
a guy! What a great love story!

1337
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,333
Then I thought, what crap!

1338
02:26:02,375 --> 02:26:05,208
This story can't end this way.

1339
02:26:08,542 --> 02:26:14,666
And that's why you set Sunehri free,
Knowing that she'll lead you to me.

1340
02:26:18,417 --> 02:26:19,583
Masterstroke!

1341
02:26:19,667 --> 02:26:23,624
Well, thank you.. But
now I’m really tired.

1342
02:26:24,875 --> 02:26:28,374
For 6 months Live waited in this town.

1343
02:26:28,667 --> 02:26:31,124
Waited for that next robbery.

1344
02:26:31,542 --> 02:26:33,666
I am tired of thinking..

1345
02:26:33,834 --> 02:26:36,874
..for the symbol of 'A' to re-appear.

1346
02:26:37,834 --> 02:26:40,458
So I thought I’d
come over personally..

1347
02:26:40,709 --> 02:26:43,291
..and ask you If you've
changed your signature.

1348
02:26:43,542 --> 02:26:45,249
I have Changed myself.

1349
02:26:47,625 --> 02:26:49,249
But I haven't.

1350
02:26:49,459 --> 02:26:55,124
Knew you'd come in
search of us.. Someday.

1351
02:27:01,542 --> 02:27:03,541
All the information About my robberies..

1352
02:27:03,917 --> 02:27:07,083
..the deposit boxes, Locker numbers..

1353
02:27:07,542 --> 02:27:11,541
..all the data is in this watch.

1354
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,874
We won't be needing it now.

1355
02:27:36,834 --> 02:27:40,624
So, how are we going to the
airport? Or should we take our car?

1356
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:44,708
Excuse me. Is this place still open?

1357
02:27:45,209 --> 02:27:46,333
Of course!

1358
02:27:49,709 --> 02:27:51,499
This place is always open.

1359
02:27:53,917 --> 02:27:59,458
Let me tell you, That for
the world, Mr. A is dead.

1360
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:02,833
And there's nothing..

1361
02:28:02,917 --> 02:28:05,291
..that great about putting
Dead thieves in jail.

1362
02:28:08,834 --> 02:28:12,499
I’m going to let you guys
go, Because it's a love story.

1363
02:28:14,167 --> 02:28:16,916
But remember, I’ll be watching.

1364
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:26,624
The lover will die With great pomp.

1365
02:28:26,834 --> 02:28:29,041
"Dhoom."

1366
02:28:30,584 --> 02:28:31,833
For the beer.

1367
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:34,624
So long.

1368
02:28:44,292 --> 02:28:46,166
May I have two beers, please?

1369
02:28:50,042 --> 02:28:52,999
Open the beers, I am still on strike.

1370
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,249
Funny guy!

1371
