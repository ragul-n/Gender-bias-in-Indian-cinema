00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,040
'Good morning
Today's headlines'

4
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,560
'Early this morning, Baluthambi
an industrialist was found murdered...'

5
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,000
'...under a bridge near
Thirupurankundram highway'

6
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,720
'Past 8 months, 4 businessmen
have been murdered in this manner'

7
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,520
'This serial killing
has sent panic waves...'

8
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,960
'...amongst industrialists
and the general public'

9
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
'The police force is taking
serious measures...'

10
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
'...to find the motive
and nab the assailant'

11
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,960
Did you get scared?

12
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,360
Don't be

13
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,560
At 2:00 a.m come
to the stone quarry

14
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Near Yanaimalai
with Rs 20 million

15
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,560
Are you trying
to threaten me?

16
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,920
If you don't turn up, you'll be
the 5th corpse under the bridge

17
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,200
Lal sir, this bag
contains Rs 20 million

18
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,920
Everyone has started
pressing the panic button

19
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
Hereafter our treasury
will start overflowing

20
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
Call every single one of them

21
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,200
Why should I give you money?

22
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,240
I won't

23
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,680
(overlap of voices)

24
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,000
Trying to threaten me?

25
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,640
The matter is a bit serious

26
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
They've demanded
a sum of Rs 20 million

27
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,840
Balathambi who died now
was a friend of mine, sir

28
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,800
So many who seem rich to
outsiders are actually starving

29
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Businessmen have loans
heavier than their bank accounts

30
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
They are dying
unable to pay the interest

31
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,640
To tell you the truth...

32
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,400
...when Balathambi was threatened
he had no money to pay up, sir

33
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,800
Not knowing this
they killed him

34
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,080
His entire family fell at my feet
and lamented their hearts out

35
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,040
We must not spare them

36
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,120
Where did they ask you to come?

37
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,640
Is the money intact?

38
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,640
Yes

39
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
We got the money

40
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,960
No problem
We'll see you soon

41
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
There's a van coming
all of a sudden?

42
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,640
Vazhi maari vaaraanu nu ninaikiraen@@

43
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,040
It's the police!

44
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Come...come
Don't be scared

45
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,560
'In an encounter between the police

'The police are in pursuit of
his accomplices who escaped'

49
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,880
Enough, dad
My bike may wear out

50
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Son?

51
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,880
You left your phone behind

52
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,080
Throw it, ma

53
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,000
- See you, ma
- Okay, dear

54
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,840
Enough, son...go

55
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Don't tease me, pa

56
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,760
'In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'

57

of the soul of brother Albert...'

58
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,080
'...let us pray to
Almighty God, amen'

59
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,360
Sir, full settlement

60
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
You'll get a monthly pension

61
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,120
Let me know
of any relative

62
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,040
I'll get a job for them
in the department

63
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,840
He was our only son

64
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,360
His wedding was to
be held next month

65
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
This happened
all of a sudden

66
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,440
My bloodline has
been wiped out

67
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,960
Sir, we don't want this money

68
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,600
We want our son's killer punished

69
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,480
That's enough, sir

70
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,440
Please forgive us

71
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,960
We'll take leave

72
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,760

of sub inspector Albert...'

73
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,320

00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600

78
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,040
Durai, call me as soon as
you hand him over in the prison

79
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,600
Are you surprised
I've surrendered?

80
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,840
I'll be out in 15 days

81
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,960
But every cop should be scared
to lay a finger on any of my boys

82
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
Say that again

83
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
Fear?

84
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,760
For a policeman?

85
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,640
Look there

86
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
With just his entry a policeman
is making a deep impact there

87
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,040
Won't spare you

88
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Who are you playing with?

89
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,120
I'm from Madurai

90
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,400
The chap who got hit
is also from Madurai

91
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,640
Everybody knows you are from
Madurai, right up to Malaysia

92
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,880
But why did you hit him?

93
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,920
He snatched a biscuit
from that small kid

94
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,520
Biscuit?

95
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,000
You've hit him as if
he was a murderer

96
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,800
What is this?

97
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,480
I decently asked and
got it from that kid

98
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,040
Both are the same
Come along

99
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,400
Dude, when I called you
yesterday you sounded weird

100
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,600
Why?

101
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Want to know about that?

102
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,000
That's nothing

103
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
Shall I tell you the truth?

104
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
My wife hit me yesterday

105
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,560
What are you saying?

106
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,160
I drank a little
and went home

107
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,600
But I was steady only

108
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,360
What do you want?

109
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,920
Open the door

110
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
Are you drunk?

111
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,720
Yes, you are

112
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
I'm telling you
I'm not drunk!

113
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,560
Then why ring my doorbell
instead of your own?

114
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
What?

115
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,560
- Sorry
- It's okay

116
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
My wife is here

117
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,120
What are you doing there?

118
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Then she is-

119
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
She shut the door on my face

120
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,560
What are you doing
in the neighbor's house?

121
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,560
Hahn? Searching for
my blessed husband

122
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
- Get inside
- I'm a police constable

123
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,000
People might misunderstand

124
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
How could you get that tipsy?

125
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,760
What to do?

126
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,280
Govt wine shops think
they are greasing my palm

127
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,920
And indulge me too much

128
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,560
Let me withdraw
cash from the ATM

129
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,680
Come soon

130
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,680
"Who is this lovely bunny?"

131
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,440
"What's your name, honey?"

132
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,920
"Who is this beautiful bunny?"

133
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,960
"What's your name, honey?"

134
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,080
"White as snow of a different mold
Wisp of a cloud crossing the road"

135
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,520
I need 5000 cash

136
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,200
"Who is this Flopsy bunny?"

137
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,280
"What's your name, honey?"

138
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,120
"In a jungle with bamboos ablaze
like a butterfly that has lost its way"

139
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,080
"In a busy thoroughfare, all alone
like a child that has lost a balloon"

140
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,560
"Who is this Mopsy bunny?"

141
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,680
"What's your name, sweetie?"

142
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,160
"With your beauty
you mesmerized me"

143
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,680
"With your anxiety
you blessed me"

144
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,560
"With your gaze so lovely
you tattooed me"

145
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,120
"With your eyes flashing panic
you made me a lunatic"

146
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,600
"Will I follow you?
Will you be my shadow?"

147
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,600
"Before you try to cross
I can't kidnap you, lass"

148
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,520
"I can't, alas!"

149
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,200
"Who is this cotton-tail bunny?"

150
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,760
"What's your name, honey?"

151
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,640
Dude, I am here

152
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,240
"With your hand so pretty
if you beckon me"

153
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,080
"I will stretch both my hands out
to hold you without a doubt"

154
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,400
"If you cross the road, lovely lady"

155
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,320
"I will sail through this birth readily"

156
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,800
"You might forget this incident
Till I die will I ever forget?"

157
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,040
"Before you try to cross
I can't kidnap you, lass"

158
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,120
"I can't, alas!"

159
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,960
"Who is this beautiful bunny?"

160
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,880
We have to go straight

161
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,360
No, we turn right

162
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,400
Tell me now

163
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,640
You're joining duty
only on the first

164
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,760
Why book a room here
15 days in advance?

165
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,440
I want to know all the crimes in
our city like the back of my hand

166
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,080
I want to meet
all the rowdies

167
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,200
Decided to meet and clean
the whole city on the 1st day?

168
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,200
Clean for what joy?

169
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,280
- Come
- Then?

170
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,280
Share

171
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,680
I plan to strike
a deal with all of them

172
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,200
Thank God

173
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
You almost made
my stomach somersault

174
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,720
I was scared you
would puff up your chest

175
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,320
And give utmost priority to duty

176
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,680
Tell me, broker
Not that piece of land

177
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,880
Confirm the 10 cent area
next to that land

178
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, sir's planets are aligned
most auspiciously from now

179
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,480
Finalize that

180
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,280
Tell me about
the city's DRP

181
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,920
What is DRP?

182
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,080
D is don, R is rowdy
P is punk and crook

183
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,240
Short cut?

184
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,480
'Listen to my listing'

185
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,400
'The most important DRP
in the city is Bhavani'

186
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,800
'He's all in all'

187
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
'He's under remand for
15 days for killing Albert'

188
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,840
'Vettu Rajendran
is his right hand man'

189
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,520
'If he's angry,
he'll kill anyone'

190
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,800
'His lackey is Maha Prabhu
He's a bit of a psycho'

191
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,640
'Teaching them all the tricks of
the trade is lawyer Pankaj Lal'

192
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
'They call him Lal'

193
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,520
'He grabs Govt land for
minister Chinrasu on the sly'

194
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,160
'He finalizes illegal contracts'

195
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,440
'He takes care of
all his avaricious needs'

196
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,640
'Today he is very close
to the minister'

197
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,960
DRP in a nutshell for you

198
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,360
You mentioned Vettu Rajendran

199
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,280
- Call him
- Done

200
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Tell me, Murugesa

201
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,680
The new assistant commissioner
is joining duty from the 1st, bro

202
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
- So what?
- He's our friend

203
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,040
Is that so?

204
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,760
He wanted to meet you
on a friendly basis

205
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,280
I have a small errand to run
upto Aruppukkottai

206
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,880
I'll call you at 6:00 p.m

207
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,040
Okay, bro

208
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,760
He'll call you at 6
this evening it seems

209
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,000
6:00 p.m?

210
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,960
Let's meet him then

211
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,240
Shall we see
Goddess Meenakshi?

212
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,720
What are you doing?

213
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,680
New slippers

214
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
It will be stolen
if placed together

215
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,120
A policeman's mind
should be razor sharp

216
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,440
When you enter a temple,
you should touch the door step

217
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,760
- Learn that
- Scriptures?!

218
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,880
Meenakshi, I want a new car
Build a house of my own

219
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,720
Collect money
like nobody's busines-

220
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,440
Take it off

221
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,280
I removed my slippers
hardly a second ago

222
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
You can still feel
the warmth of my feet

223
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,880
At least can't you
steal it 10 minutes later?

224
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,040
Don't hit me

225
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,600
Can't you wait 10 minutes?

226
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,400
Bro, both our slippers
were the same brand

227
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
That's why I was confused

228
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,200
Show me your slipper?

229
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,720
This one

230
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,720
These two look like
the same brand to you?

231
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,920
And you were
slightly confused?

232
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,920
Yes, bro

233
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,280
Do you even
have a conscience?

234
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
What is the logic behind this?

235
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,040
You might as well not wear
slippers and wander bare feet

236
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,240
On top of it
clad in white!

237
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,200
How did you know
I hid the slippers apart?

238
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,840
As if you will place
the other one in a locker?

239
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,120
Very funny!

240
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,600
You are a lowlife thief
and you're acting smart

241
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
If I see you this side
I'll chop you to pieces

242
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,040
Keep my slipper safe
I'll come back for it

243
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,800
- Let's go in
- Try stealing now

244
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,760
- Get on the bike, dude
- Wait, I'm coming

245
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,640
Velraj

246
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,440
My daughter wanted to
learn to ride a 2 wheeler

247
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,200
- Okay, sir
- No rush at all

248
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,760
Teach her patiently

249
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,520
Your daughter is here
One moment, sir

250
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,240
Your father is on the line

251
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,040
- Sowmy?
- Yes, dad

252
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,840
You're a young girl

253
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,480
Don't get your pretty face hurt

254
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,040
- Take utmost care
- Okay, dad

255
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,880
When will you learn to U-turn?

256
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,040
I'm also trying, sir

257
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,480
But the scooty
doesn't want to

258
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,160
Your scooty told you?

259
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,440
Slowly

260
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,200
Go slowly when you take the turn

261
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,160
Don't be scared

262
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,960
Looks like you're the one who is scared

263
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,560
Shut up

264
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,200
Move aside

265
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,200
Go, girl

266
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,680
How could you do this, sir?

267
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,400
Take 5 years if you
teach her this way

268
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,160
Know how many I've pushed
into a well and taught swimming?

269
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,920
See how well
she will U-turn now

270
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,640
Not me!

271
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,640
Don't run

272
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,040
Wretched fellow!

273
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
1st check if he's alive

274
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,800
- I'm fine, sir
- 1 minute

275
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,160
I'm fine, sir
Listen to me

276
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,200
Shut up and sit tight
I know what to do

277
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
You killed an innocent chap

278
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,760
I didn't hit him with
such force for him to die

279
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,960
You didn't

280
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,880
But he flew in mid air
at such a speed, he died

281
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,320
The pumpkin he was carrying
was squished so much

282
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Wonder what a mess
his brain will be

283
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
Anyway he'll kick
the bucket on the way

284
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,440
What are you saying?

285
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,680
He'll die on the way for sure

286
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,280
How much property do you own?

287
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,640
- No idea
- Be ready to spend

288
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,880
He's here
Come soon

289
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,560
Where is the body?

290
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,240
Where is the body?

291
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,160
His life is still hanging
by a slim thread

292
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,920
I've sent word to his relatives
to be with him before he dies

293
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,920
Poor thing!

294
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,360
I never thought
he would die so young

295
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,480
Do you want to see him...

296
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,280
...to bid farewell
as a finishing touch?

297
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
Please cooperate

298
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,160
I can't do that

299
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,680
Don't worry
Trust in God

300
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,400
'He has made
his 1st move'

301
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,240
Without a license
if you kill someone...

302
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,400
...according to 304A section

303
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,080
Like that you know

304
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,640
You can be imprisoned for
5 to 7 years, you know?

305
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,520
Then?

306
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,520
Then what?

307
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,760
He'll flash in your dreams
like a ghost every night

308
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,000
Even face to face
he'll be like a ghost only

309
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,680
But if he haunts you like
a ghost imagine your plight

310
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,440
Your fate, you have to
chat with a ghost!

311
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,360
Why are you crying?

312
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,600
Don't know if I am
a cop or a hustler!

313
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,000
You've killed only one chap

314
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,400
Very soon another will follow

315
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,880
Hey! Go and see
if he is dead by now

316
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,040
You'll get rid of your friend
once your job is over

317
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,720
Go, check

318
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,440
Don't cry

319
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,440
Why be scared?
Let him die

320
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,400
- Nothing to worry, dear
- I am here for you

321
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,000
- Wait
- Let me go

322
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
I'm fine, dear

323
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,280
'He's back from the dead!'

324
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,280
Sorry, anna

325
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,600
You're fine, right?

326
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,120
Why should you apologize?

327
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,040
You saved my life
My guardian angel

328
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,320
Do you know she was the one
who hit you and tried to kill you?

329
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
I know

330
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,640
If I had gone to work...

331
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,560
...I'd be 1 of the 11 casualties
who died in a fire accident

332
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,160
My good time, she came
like a Goddess and saved me

333
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
My wife

334
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,960
She's so worried something
terrible has happened to me

335
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,680
Yes, dear

336
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,880
No, I am fine, dear

337
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,600
Watch your step

338
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,040
Can't bear to see blood
flowing like a river

339
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Even the doctor
removed his glasses!

340
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,280
Don't interrupt me

341
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,920
I couldn't bear the sight

342
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,320
He is dead

343
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Sekhar is dead

344
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,560
You should cry now

345
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,640
'I thought my performance rocked'

346
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,640
'Maybe he kissed her
while I was inside?'

347
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,840
She hit me and
went off in a huff

348
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,600
The reel snapped
half an hour ago

349
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,440
Cat got out of the bag, huh?

350
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,920
If my wife gets to know
a girl slapped me-

351
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,280
She'll poison your food
instead of hitting you!

352
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
The food she cooks
is poison for sure!

353
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,080
Hey! Vettu Rajendran

354
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Take the call

355
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,880
Bro?

356
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,120
Bring him at around 7:00 p.m
to Rajakoor festival

357
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Super, bro

358
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,200
Okay, we'll be there

359
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
Why are you grinning
like a Cheshire cat?

360
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,520
You know what fun
the Rajakoor will be

361
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
Tap your feet to
do re me!

362
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
Her dance-

363
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,320
"Warm welcome"

364
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,680
Soothe the body soulfully

365
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,440
"If you nod your head
we can paint the town red"

366
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,200
"Come, fan of mine"

367
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,600
"In this moment of time"

368
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,160
"I am a damsel hot and aroused"

369
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
"A ripe mango not yet caressed"

370
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:34,880
"I am a lass hot and lush
A mango ripe and fresh"

371
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,240
"Dude, are you ready?
Love, want to bed me?"

372
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,160
"Not touch and leave me
But to hug me tenderly"

373
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,640
"Dude, are you willing?
Want to bed me, darling?"

374
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,400
"Dude, will you come?
With open arms I welcome"

375
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:05,080
"I am a temptress in the making
A ripe fresh fruit for the taking"

376
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:12,440
"I am an enchantress sensuous
A mango fresh and precious"

377
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:24,280
"Like the crowing of the rooster
shall I rouse your senses altogether?"

378
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,840
"There are fruits in plenty
in the guava grove certainly"

379
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,520
"But you insist on a pair
That's simply not fair"

380
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,480
"In the market shandy
is roasted chicken handy"

381
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,360
"But you want a virgin beauty
How's that reasonable, tell me?"

382
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,760
"Even if you will your wealth to me
I won't comply readily"

383
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,240
"If you threaten me too
With a knife I won't oblige you"

384
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,240
"Ancestral inheritance
is this graceful folk dance"

385
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,720
"We refuse to sell it
for monetary benefit"

386
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,120
"Ancestral inheritance
is this ethnic folk dance"

387
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,480
"We refuse to sell it
for monetary benefit"

388
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,680
"I am a lass hot and lush
A mango ripe to refresh"

389
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,840
"When the sun goes to bed sing your tune
Tap your feet for our love to be immune"

390
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:37,120
"When this damsel dances at night
your adrenalin rushes in delight"

391
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,920
"Come on
my machaan"

392
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,360
"Heave-ho, no pain no gain
Will Mr Wise-guy reign?"

393
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,000
"With your skill, lure me or not
I am a finely chiseled glam doll"

394
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,880
"1000s of men fall for me
But to marry me conditions apply"

395
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,760
"I would love to
be married to you"

396
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,480
"But my first love is
this dance of bliss"

397
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,080
"I won't be a cook for men"

398
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,400
"I won't be a baby making machine"

399
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,320
"Whoever follows my clause
most welcome to come close"

400
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,240
"Otherwise swim against the tide
Go back safely where you reside"

401
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,200
"Whoever follows my clause
most welcome to come close"

402
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,840
"Otherwise swim against the tide
Go back safely where you reside"

403
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:30,280
"I am a damsel hot and aroused
A ripe mango not yet caressed"

404
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:37,960
"I am a lass so sensuous
A mango ripe and fresh"

405
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,280
"Dude, are you ready?
Love, want to bed me?"

406
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,080
"Not touch and leave me
But to hug me tenderly"

407
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,640
"Dude, are you willing?
Want to bed me, darling?"

408
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,320
"Dude, will you come?
With open arms I welcome"

409
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,720
"I am a damsel hot and aroused"

410
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,080
Sir, isn't the norm only 3%?

411
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
How is it fair
to ask for 10%?

412
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,600
In Madurai city alone
there are 51 police stations

413
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,440
51 inspectors,
150 sub inspectors

414
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,960
3000 police officers

415
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,680
We pay a lump sum of
Rs 220000 per month, sir

416
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,720
We have a long list to bribe, sir

417
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,880
You have granite, sand quarry,
loans, real estate, hotel

418
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,560
...contract, market
to fall back on

419
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,080
On top of it, you blackmail
top businessmen in our city

420
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,760
And get tonnes of money

421
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,200
I know that too

422
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,080
Our city tops other cities
in greasing palms

423
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,960
What's wrong in paying me 10%
for me to turn a blind eye?

424
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,480
We'll wrap up the deal, huh?

425
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
You think our deal will work out?

426
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,920
He'll decide only after
consulting Bhavani

427
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,600
You think I've exceeded
my drinking limit tonight?

428
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,640
Not at all

429
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,840
You drank just 5 pegs

430
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,600
Scared?

431
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,720
You want to ride pillion?

432
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,000
That's not my problem, dude

433
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,520
I'm only scared of my wife

434
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,640
She'll pickle me to pieces

435
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,520
Have you watched 'Myna'?

436
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,920
Yes, I've seen it

437
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Remember the sub inspector's wife
who speaks in a specific modulation?

438
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,760
'I'm not bothered about all that
When are you coming home?'

439
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,240
'When are you coming?'

440
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,840
Ditto, my wife uses
the same tone on me

441
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,080
Did you drink or you didn't?

442
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,400
You know our commissioner-

443
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,400
Did you drink?

444
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,000
All of us from
the department wen-

445
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,000
Did you drink?

446
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,880
Even if I drink some brand
that doesn't stink at all, she'll find out

447
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,880
How's that possible?

448
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,160
I swear I didn't drink, dear

449
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,880
Then blow into this machine

450
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,600
How did you get
this breath analyzer?

451
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,880
Blow into this machine

452
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,800
I ask the whole city
to take the alcohol test

453
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,080
This is like carrying sand
to the Marina beach!

454
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,280
Sheer torture! If this news leaks out
it will be a disgrace to our department

455
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,280
It's a disgrace to you
Do as I say

456
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,120
Go straight home

457
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Pretend to be angry

458
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,280
Take off your clothes
Get into the shower

459
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,040
Brush your teeth
and come out fresh

460
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,040
You'll smell of soap only
Not liquor definitely

461
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,640
You think so?

462
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,200
Let me try my luck
with your idea

463
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,560
Take care

464
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,920
See you tomorrow

465
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,240
Sekhar, what happened?

466
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,400
Don't know
Let me check

467
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,040
See if someone has strewn
any nails on the road

468
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,600
Find any nail on the tyre?

469
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
Looks like the tyre burst, bro

470
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,040
Bro, looks like a bullet

471
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Bullet?

472
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,520
Get the gun

473
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,120
Watch out
Someone is out there

474
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,080
Sekhar!

475
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,120
Hey! Who is it?

476
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Whoever it is
come out in the open

477
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,360
They have killed a sub inspector
in the middle of the road

478
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,680
Let's take action legally, sir

479
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,520
But this kind of 'encounter'
is too much, sir

480
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,160
If people lose faith in us
and are terrified of rowdies...

481
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,280
...then we are not even
eligible for this post, sir

482
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,760
If we 'encounter' media will
surely make an issue of it, sir

483
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,200
Encounter is the answer

484
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,320
But neither the people nor the press
should be aware of our involvement

485
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,080
Even the police in our department
should not be in the loop

486
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,920
But the rowdies should be informed

487
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,360
Sir, is it the police station?

488
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,160
Move...move aside

489
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,160
Step back

490
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
- What happened, sir?
- Move back

491
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,120
3 men shot dead
by a barrage of gunfire

492
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,320
Investigations are on

493
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,360
How did it happen?

494
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,800
We'll know very soon

495
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,960
- Where are you?
- Trichy

496
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,600
Phone missing for
the past 2 days

497
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,840
You lost your phone?

498
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,480
That's why should never
get you a costly phone!

499
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,480
Very funny!

500
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
Is that my brother?

501
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,640
Our sis wants to talk to you

502
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,080
You'll be in Trichy
But you won't visit Madurai

503
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,920
What if someone steals
the Rockfort while I am there?

504
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,720
Can you never be serious?

505
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,640
Let me talk to my son

506
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,200
Mother wants to talk to you

507
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,400
- Son?
- Yes, ma

508
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,240
Your sister-in-law has selected
3 girls for you to choose from

509
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,680
I can't marry 3 girls

510
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
But I am okay with 2!

511
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,440
Is there any law that a cop
can indulge in polygamy?

512
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,320
Oh! I thought I was
still talking to my mother

513
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,200
My daughter's 1st day at school

514
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Wish her luck

515
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,040
Uncle, 1st day
of school for me

516
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,360
Is that so, darling?

517
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
Kids go to school
only to play

518
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,960
Go with a smile

519
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,320
If anyone scolds you
tell them your uncle is a cop

520
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,680
I'll give them a tough time

521
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,840
Okay, uncle

522
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,480
Shall I hang up now?

523
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,480
- Hello, ma
- What, my dear?

524
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
Where's my father?

525
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,360
He has got visitors

526
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,320
'I am always elected as leader
Why can't one of you take my post?'

527
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,880
He's talking to them

528
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,880
You should head
our Thirumangalam taluk

529
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,880
Is it our youngest son?

530
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,640
When are you coming home?

531
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,360
'In another 10 days, father'

532
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,160
Come in such a way you can
stay for our temple festival

533
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
I'll be there

534
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,120
See you soon, father

535
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,120
Did my brilliant idea work out?

536
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,120
No, my wife found out

537
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,640
How's that possible?

538
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,040
You did what I said?

539
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,560
I followed it to a T

540
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,520
'I went in with
an angry expression'

541
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,480
'I removed my slippers
with that same flow'

542
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,200
'I hung my key'

543
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
'I unbuttoned my shirt
with extra energy'

544
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,960
'I took out my watch too'

545
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,080
'I wore my lungi and
got out of my pants'

546
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,720
'Then I went into the loo
with toothpaste on my brush'

547
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,600
'And...?'

548
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,760
'With a jerk, my wife
grasped my hand'

549
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
Did you drink?

550
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,880
How did she find out?

551
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,680
I had the same doubt

552
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,960
'How did you find out, dear?'

553
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,440
Take the helmet off your head
my blockhead of a husband!

554
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,760
Helmet is still on my head!

555
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,000
When I stripped from head to toe
I forgot to remove my helmet

556
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,640
'In the most mysterious manner
in Madurai late last night...'

557
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,720
'...Vettu Rajendran and his accomplices
Kannan and Bhaskar were shot dead'

558
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,600
'The police are investigating
the murder and motive behind this'

559
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,200
How could this happen?

560
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,920
We met them only last night

561
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,000
So we won't get our share?

562
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,240
Then I won't get
that 10 cent land either

563
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,760
What about his left hand Maha?

564
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,200
True, let me try him
Our deal might work out

565
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,800
Dial his number
We can finish him

566
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,800
Whaaat?

567
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,480
We can finalize it, call him

568
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,400
Bro, I'm Murugesan speaking

569
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,720
Tell me

570
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,480
How did this happen, bro?

571
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,280
Don't know

572
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,360
We are trying to find out

573
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,960
Let me know if you
know anything

574
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,160
I'll definitely do so

575
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
Another important matter, bro

576
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,560
The new assistant commissioner
is joining on the 1st, bro

577
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,280
He's a good friend of mine

578
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,720
He wanted to meet you, bro

579
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,200
Pccht!
Not now

580
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Maybe 10 days later

581
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,720
- I'll let you know
- Okay, bro

582
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm meeting Bhavani anna now

583
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,320
I'll call you

584
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,120
He hung up

585
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,960
What?

586
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,720
Bro

587
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,080
Who killed Raja?

588
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,840
Don't know
We are trying to find out

589
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,080
He said he'll meet
only after 10 days

590
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,400
It's better to fix the deal
before I join duty

591
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
Tell him it's urgent

592
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,720
Before I come out
I should know the culprit

593
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,400
What now?

594
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,800
Bro, I'm Murugesan-

595
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,360
Hey! I told you
I'll let you know

596
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,480
What's the tearing hurry?

597
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,000
Jackass! If you call again
I'll smash up your face

598
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,320
Bloody disconnect now

599
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,120
Bad timing
He’s pissed now

600
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,360
Who was that?

601
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,040
Constable Murugesan

602
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:02,040
Ask our Trichy Bhai to find out
if Tuticorin Vetri killed our Raja

603
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,120
Okay, bro

604
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,880
I had told you
I wanted to talk to Lal

605
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,800
Lal, Bhavani here

606
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,360
I've spoken to the judge
You'll be out in 10 days

607
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,320
Don't worry

608
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,200
- Minister wants to see you
- I'll be there

609
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,960
Minister is calling me
I'll talk to you later

610
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,600
'In the assembly election
representing the opposition TMK party...'

611
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,520
'...Thirumangalam candidate
Veerapandiyan has been chosen'

612
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,720
How can he contest
as my opposition candidate?

613
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,360
Why do you get perturbed?

614
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,120
Only you have won twice
in this constituency

615
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,320
For the influence and
power you command...

616
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,080
...you can defeat him easily, sir

617
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,640
We don't even have 10% of
the cash flow Veerapandiyan has

618
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,920
1st time he has got a seat
He'll spend money lavishly

619
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,880
I feel bad I antagonized
Mr Ramasamy's family

620
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,360
Sir, if you don't mind,
shall I talk to Selvam?

621
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
Will he come to our side?

622
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,280
I'll talk to him

623
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,040
Lal, tell me

624
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,000
Minister asked me to call you

625
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,000
Regarding?

626
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,720
He wanted to meet you at GRT

627
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,000
Why all of a sudden?

628
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,480
Why harbor old grudges?

629
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,480
It's only good news

630
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,080
To your advantage

631
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,080
Listen to me

632
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,040
You are coming

633
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,200
1 minute

634
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,960
Has the parcel been
sent to Canada?

635
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,000
Yes, bro

636
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,480
Lal, I have a small errand to run

637
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,240
I'll finish that, call
and then come over

638
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,160
Okay, Selvam

639
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,360
Place it there

640
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,680
Greetings, uncle

641
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,640
Come, Selvam

642
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,520
Sit down

643
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,040
Is everything fine at your end?

644
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,600
Yes, thank you, uncle

645
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,600
5 million in this bag for you

646
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,240
You must join my party again

647
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,080
You must work for me in
the coming Assembly election

648
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,480
To secure a seat for you in
the next election for chairmanship...

649
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,840
...is my responsibility

650
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,720
Okay?

651
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Okay, uncle

652
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,840
I don't want this money

653
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,760
I'll be more than happy
if I become chairman

654
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,960
Grandfather's death anniversary
is this Wednesday

655
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,520
I'll join your party on that day

656
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm so glad, Selvam

657
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,480
See you, uncle

658
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,880
- Will fulfill your wish
- Okay, uncle

659
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,640
You've promised Nagaraj
for the same chairman's seat

660
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,000
You've promised the same to-

661
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,240
Political moves change
as and when required

662
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,560
Will cross the bridge
when we come to it

663
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,360
Tell me, bro

664
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,040
I told you I went to
see Chinrasu uncle

665
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,560
He asked me to work for him
in the coming Assembly election

666
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,040
He has promised to
make me the chairman

667
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,600
Have you informed our father?

668
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,480
I did and he asked me
to consult you also

669
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,480
I somehow feel it is wrong

670
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,960
Is that so?

671
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,400
I gave my word I'll join his party
on our grandfather's memorial day

672
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,480
Okay, anna

673
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,080
You do what you feel is right

674
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,960
Hey! Chit of a boy

675
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,120
Look here

676
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,960
Blabbermouth!
I'm talking to you

677
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,320
He's on my back again

678
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,520
Who the hell
are you maligning?

679
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
- You'll get it from me
- Ptch...ptch!

680
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,760
Blabbermouth! As if you
won't step into my area

681
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,080
What audacity!

682
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,240
I'll make sure your spine
splits to million pieces

683
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,160
- I'll beat you up
- Don't get into a fight

684
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,160
Have the courage to
meet me face to face, da

685
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,080
He's calling you
with such disrespect

686
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,560
But I won't go, you see

687
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,720
I'll come and get you

688
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,200
Wait, don't go

689
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,040
We have a difference of opinion

690
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,680
Between you both?

691
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,120
What do you want me to do?

692
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,080
What's the hassle?

693
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,680
Er...uh...look here

694
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,160
Don't turn that side

695
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,880
He belongs to my area

696
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,160
Bro...bro

697
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,160
Get up

698
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,200
You want me to lie
that I'm your real brother?

699
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,920
'Falsehood can take
the place of truth'

700
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,320
So said poet Thiruvalluvar

701
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,280
He's tagging the great
Tamil poet here

702
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,480
My father has said I should always
help a student even if he's a stranger

703
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,680
Respecting my father's
pearls of wisdom...

704
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,040
...trusting this pipsqueak

705
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,160
...I went on this charade

706
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,400
Didn't I ask you to bring
your mother or father?

707
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,800
He is my brother, sir

708
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,880
Elder brother?

709
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,280
'He's looking at me strangely'

710
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,480
Good afternoon, sir

711
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,040
He is my younger brother

712
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,520
It was wrong on his part to
bunk class and go watch a film

713
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,640
Forgive him this once-

714
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Forget that

715
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,720
Do you know what all
your brother is up to?

716
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,880
He smokes, chews betel nut, drinks,
stands on the footboard in the bus

717
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,040
He clicks dirty pictures of girls

718
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,240
He links up teachers and
maligns them on restroom walls

719
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,200
He's a bad influence
on all the other students

720
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,800
- Maybe I made a mistake?
- He lies at the drop of a hat

721
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,920
Even now he claims
you are his brother!

722
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,280
Wondering if this is also
one of his clever ploys

723
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,600
Rascal! If we send you to school...

724
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
...are you getting into
all these bad habits?

725
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,360
Your teacher is equal to God

726
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,440
How can you malign them
on the restroom walls?

727
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,920
Our parents have dreams
of you becoming a doctor

728
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,800
Or an engineer

729
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,160
You shattered their dreams

730
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,760
You made even your teacher
doubt if I was related to you

731
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,520
He isn't even my brother, sir

732
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,880
He put me in a spot

733
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,480
Who is he to say this?

734
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,160
I don't consider him
my brother at all from today

735
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,040
He isn't even related
Not my brother at all

736
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,280
Sir, give me one-

737
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,280
Chalk piece?

738
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,200
Give me a sickle

739
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,520
I'll chop him into bits
and bury him

740
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,640
Stop...stop it

741
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,840
It was a mistake, he didn't
know what he was doing

742
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,560
Forgive him
Just this once

743
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,760
I'll keep an eye on him

744
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,440
You're giving me that assurance?

745
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,720
You don't doubt me, do you?

746
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,920
Oh no! I don't doubt you one bit

747
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,120
I'll die of shame, sir

748
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,280
My self respect is of
utmost priority to me, sir

749
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,920
I come from such a family

750
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Don't hide behind his back

751
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,640
I'll handle this

752
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,040
You don't know how much-

753
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,120
Hey blabbermouth! Stop

754
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,480
Brother?

755
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,680
Bother!

756
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,720
If I had brought my father
I'd have just got 1 tight slap

757
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,120
If I hadn't brought anyone...

758
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,560
...my teacher would have
stopped with just 2 blows

759
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,720
Why are you in this
murderous rage mode?

760
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,200
He doubted my integrity

761
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,000
I was worried I might get
caught in this web of deceit-

762
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,040
Oh! To escape you will
beat me up black and blue

763
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,240
I'm letting you off lightly
because I'm in school

764
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,760
One day, I'll find you
all by yourself

765
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,320
Eye for an eye
Tooth for tooth

766
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,920
I'll make sure
you end up as a corpse

767
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,480
Keep an account
of what I owe you

768
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,320
See you, blabbermouth

769
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,880
This is what happened

770
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,200
I went overboard
on my performance

771
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,560
How can you be scared
of this chit of a boy?

772
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,200
So you think

773
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,800
We can even trust an accused

774
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,240
They will go on a cussing spree

775
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,440
Maximum they will knock
a few blows, that's all

776
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,640
These kids will strike you
and snap your cable off

777
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,120
- Chapter closed
- You call yourself a cop!

778
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,920
You must handle
such kids with care

779
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,760
I'm just on my way to school

780
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,320
I'll come this evening, sir

781
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,920
Hold your child
to your right

782
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,720
- That way she'll be safe
- Thanks a lot

783
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,160
Oh gawd!
My scooty

784
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,520
Thief...thief

785
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,880
Get on to my bike

786
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,680
Come on
We'll miss your scooty

787
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,360
My scooty is over there

788
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,120
Don't you dare touch it

789
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
If you do, you'll be
as good as dead

790
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,600
Do I have to tell you separately?

791
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,480
I'll chop you to pieces
Better take her with you

792
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,320
Take your scooty and leave

793
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,120
You also come with me

794
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,960
Dai! I'm warning you, go

795
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,360
Come and get me, da

796
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,720
Can you do me a favor?

797
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,880
I want you to beat up someone

798
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,520
What's the problem?

799
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,400
When I was in college...

800
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,080
...a guy named Vinod
fell in love with me

801
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,600
Sowmya, I got this for yo-

802
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,200
How many times
have I told you?

803
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,960
I'm not interested
Why don't you get it?

804
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,840
Tortured me with missed calls
and zillion messages

805
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,320
3 months ago he brought a rowdy
with him to the nursery

806
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,560
- Ramya, where's Sowmya?
- Akka is over there

807
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,560
Sowmya, I want to talk to you

808
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,160
Vinod, are you here
with a goon to threaten me?

809
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,640
Not come to threaten

810
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,320
He wants to apologize to you

811
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,320
- What's this, bro?
- Apologize

812
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,840
- Bro...?
- Do it now

813
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,600
Leave now

814
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,480
Bro...?

815
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,160
Listen-

816
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,920
- What's your name?
- Sowmya

817
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,440
If I see you following
Sowmya again...

818
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,440
...I'll twist your head
and feed it to the crows

819
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,600
- Go away
- Bro?

820
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,880
Hey! Take him away

821
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,000
Why are you doing this?

822
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,600
You came only to
talk on my behalf

823
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,520
Actually my name is Maha Prabhu

824
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,480
Part of Bhavani's gang

825
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
Maha is one of Bhavani's boys?

826
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,320
Chapter closed

827
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,200
Are you scared?

828
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,600
Tell me more
Some more

829
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,520
6 months ago I saw you
at the traffic signal in Anna Nagar

830
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,280
'For some reason same day
I saw you thrice in various places'

831
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,800
'A strange thought crossed
my mind that evening'

832
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,160
'If I see you again
within the next 6 months...'

833
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,560
'...I decided I will
marry only you'

834
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,760
Destiny has made us meet again

835
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,120
He really turned
my life topsy-turvy

836
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,360
What's the big deal?

837
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,200
Maha continued
where Vinod left, right?

838
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,600
'She's asking me for help
unaware of the twist I'll be giving'

839
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,800
'Fine'

840
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,240
If you call, will Maha come?

841
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,600
Where should he come?

842
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,320
Reason I called you-

843
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,200
Hey listen

844
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,840
If you make up stories like
your parents are not for this...

845
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,040
...I'll get real mad

846
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,120
I don't want a single paisa
from your father

847
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,720
Just come with the sari on you
I'll treat you like a princess

848
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,560
She doesn't know
to tie a sari, boss

849
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
Hey! Who the heck are you?

850
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,840
My friend

851
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
Look at this

852
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,320
She has brought
a chap along to hit us

853
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,800
I'm assuming you know me, bro

854
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,320
I do, boss

855
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,200
But before that I must
share the real truth about me

856
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,560
Are you the most dreaded don?

857
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,520
- 2 minutes
- Tell me

858
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,000
Go to that corner

859
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,760
Face the wall
Count until 10

860
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,760
I'll join you soon

861
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,640
Go

862
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,160
My name is Jayaseelan

863
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,080
So?

864
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,480
How could you do this?

865
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,880
I asked you to only beat him up

866
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,440
If I see my girlfriend being
tortured by some random thug...

867
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,640
...will I turn a blind eye?

868
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,000
That's why I got trigger-happy!

869
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,680
No one will come
between us hereafter

870
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,160
Are you also in love with me?

871
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Yes...same

872
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,800
You like me, right?

873
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,280
Anyone hassles you,
let me know

874
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,080
Your fiance will
do the needful

875
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,200
Okay?

876
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,000
I've killed 3 thugs for you

877
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,920
Won't you fall in love with me?

878
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,160
You love me, don't you?

879
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,200
Then profess
your love to me

880
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,720
Go...bye

881
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,440
Sample...simply!

882
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,000
"Lady from Madurai city
Battled the British bravely"

883
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,640
"She drove even a tiger away
with a winnowing fan's sway"

884
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,280
"Born in the city of valor
how can you tremble with fear?"

885
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,880
"Isn't your ancestral bravery
in your genes, tell me?"

886
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,640
"My aunt's daughter dearest
make my blood rise hottest"

887
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,800
"Just one kiss
Teach me, miss?"

888
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:07,520
"Come, girl from Madurai city"

889
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:12,480
"Welcome to my heart as priority"

890
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:18,200
"Lass from the sleepless city"

891
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,800
"Enter my soul for eternity"

892
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,560
"To make your fear disappear
I'll show my art to you, dear"

893
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,280
"To protect you 24x7
I'll murder a 100 men even"

894
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,720
"I will climb the temple tower
chanting your name, my dear"

895
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,080
"Thirupazhakundram hill I'll lift
to easily play marbles with it"

896
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,280
"I will climb the temple tower
chanting your name, my dear"

897
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,280
"Thirupazhakundram hill I'll lift
to effortlessly play marbles with it"

898
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,760
"Come, girl from the city of jasmine"

899
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,200
"Get into my mind to be mine"

900
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,640
"Lady from Madurai city
Fought the foreigners fiercely"

901
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,320
"She drove even a tiger away
with a winnowing fan's sway"

902
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,960
"Born in the city of valor
can you chicken out ever?"

903
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,640
"Isn't your ancestral bravery
in your genes, my sweetie?"

904
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,320
"My aunt's daughter dearest
make my blood rise hottest"

905
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,960
"Tip of your nose is beautiful
Even from far you're an eyeful"

906
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,760
"My life thanks to you
has changed many a hue"

907
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,560
"My desires new
now follow you"

908
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,840
"A cucumber fresh, ready to feast"

909
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,680
"You captivated me, my parakeet"

910
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,240
"Warm greetings, peahen dear"

911
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,920
"Koel, say yes crystal clear"

912
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,920
"Soul mate for life
Almost my wife"

913
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,640
"In my lap you'll favor
to bloom, my flower"

914
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,840
"Beauty from the temple city"

915
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,560
"Breeze into my heart with divinity"

916
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
"Eyes soaked in rain showers
Girl swathed in pretty flowers"

917
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,200
"Looking for you, my princess
My heart wavers as waves restless"

918
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,720
"Like froth on the shore
I bow my head in rapture"

919
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,080
"Shall I cast aside my fear?"

920
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,000
"Shall I reach the peak of surrender?"

921
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,320
"Shall I explore you thoroughly?"

922
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,840
"Detail the rest of my discovery?"

923
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:20,040
"If you're true or not, as a shadow,
I'll follow you, Goddess of love"

924
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,480
"Lass from the festival city"

925
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,280
"Fill my soul with felicity"

926
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,800
"Lovely girl from Madurai city"

927
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,800
My political career today
has a 2 fold happiness

928
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,480
1st is unveiling the statue of
my guru Mr Ramasamy's statue

929
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,040
2nd is Mr Ramasamy's grandson
Selvam joining my party

930
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,720
In the coming legislative
assembly election...

931
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,080
...we are happy to announce
we'll make a clean sweep

932
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,600
'In the murder case of
Sub inspector Albert...'

933
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:26,800
'...due to lack of evidence or witnesses
against the police suspect Bhavani'

934
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,440
'...this court acquits Bhavani
who voluntarily surrendered'

935
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,120
Did you kidnap the girl
Maha was in love with?

936
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,240
Done, bro

937
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,120
The guy on the right is
the one who shot them

938
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,840
The chap next to him is a police
constable in Thallakulam station

939
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,320
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir

940
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,080
Dorai, start the car

941
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,880
Akka...sis?

942
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,960
Dude, Bhavani is on the phone

943
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,320
Talk to him

944
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,480
Dai! Dumbass

945
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,320
I know who you are

946
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,840
Your girlfriend is here

947
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,400
Come to Sellur mill
go-down immediately

948
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,080
I'll be there

949
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,280
Is everything okay?

950
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,840
Bro wants to meet us at once

951
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,480
Shall we go meet him?

952
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,640
Super, dude

953
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,920
Don't mess up like last time

954
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,520
Finish the deal properly

955
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,720
Done deal

956
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,600
Give me the key

957
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,280
Why are they lined up here
as if they're about to pounce?

958
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,840
Welcome, police

959
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,440
Do you think I don't know
you killed my Maha?

960
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,880
Bro, you're mistaken

961
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,280
We are here to
discuss our share-

962
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,840
Yes, I killed Maha

963
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,040
When did this happen?

964
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,800
Not only Maha

965
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,440
I also killed
Vettu Rajendran

966
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,960
I'm here now
to kill you also

967
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,080
Goodbye to my land dream

968
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,160
Kill him

969
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,640
Think you are a big shot

970
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,640
You'll kill and walk away?

971
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,960
Who authorized you?

972
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,080
Don't you get it?

973
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,280
I'm Jeyaseelan

974
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,840
This is an undercover operation

975
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,600
For Albert

976
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,440
We don't spare a man
who assaults the public

977
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,920
But he has killed a cop

978
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,600
How can we let him go, sir?

979
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,200
That's why I shot all of them
in the middle of the road

980
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,000
In this world one can get away
from law by killing anyone

981
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,120
But if he kills a cop
he can't escape death

982
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,600
Hereafter all rowdies in every
nook and corner of Tamil Nadu...

983
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,040
...should be scared to even
stand next to a police officer

984
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,160
Similar to the trust
people place in us...

985
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,920
...rowdies must shiver with
the same amount of fear, sir

986
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,720
Only then you and I are cops

987
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,680
If I finish him off right now...

988
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
...Madurai will be
crime-free from today

989
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,960
If you kill me, you think
Madurai will become clean?

990
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,600
It will happen again

991
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,320
He will make it happen

992
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,280
To escape from the jaws of death
are you trying to scare us?

993
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,120
If someone like that exists...

994
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,480
...whoever he may be

995
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,800
...he will face the same fate!

996
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,320
Please, Selvam
Let me go

997
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,600
I'll pay the amount you want

998
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,000
Don't, Selvam
Please let me go

999
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,760
I swear, please believe me
I don't have money

1000
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,360
Mr Lal, there's 20 million in here

1001
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,440
Everyone is petrified now

1002
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,800
Hereafter we will
start receiving money

1003
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,120
Call everyone

1004
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,880
The very first time when you went to
the cops, we should've finished you

1005
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,280
Because of you
Bhavani's brother died

1006
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,800
That sub inspector who interfered
with Bhavani's brother died

1007
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,400
Because of him,
Bhavani and all his men died

1008
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,480
The same mistake
is repeated again

1009
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,320
The cop who is responsible
for Bhavani's death should die

1010
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,680
I've crossed Thirunagar

1011
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,640
I'll be there in 2 minutes

1012
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,480
Yesterday you didn't even drink

1013
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,400
Then why did your wife hit you?

1014
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,320
Don't even ask

1015
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,240
My wife and I went
to the temple yesterday

1016
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,160
Just then a monkey
crossed the road

1017
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,480
My wife immediately said...

1018
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,080
'...look over there!
Your relative is crossing'

1019
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,200
Will I keep quiet?

1020
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,280
'Won't I know
my father-in-law?'

1021
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,520
I retorted

1022
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,080
Can't you zip your lips for once?

1023
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,200
Nowadays repartee reaps respect!

1024
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,240
How are you, sonny?

1025
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,600
I'm doing good, akka

1026
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,080
How many liters
does this buffalo give?

1027
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,080
This is a cow, sonny

1028
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,720
Don't I know that

1029
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,520
I meant the buffalo
milking the cow!

1030
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,560
Heyyy!

1031
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,120
You shouldn't glare so fiercely

1032
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,960
The cow might get
agitated and kick you

1033
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,640
Milk is dripping on to the ground

1034
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,600
You stayed in a hostel for 5 years

1035
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,360
The next 5 years?

1036
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,400
Training and job made you
stay out of town

1037
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
What do you know about us?

1038
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,120
Are we suffering from
diabetes or blood pressure?

1039
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,680
What do we eat?

1040
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,640
What tablets do we need?

1041
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,280
Do you know anything at all?

1042
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,080
You won't let down your eldest son
who will be cremating you!

1043
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,000
True, my eldest son
means the world to me

1044
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,920
Is it enough if you
just send us money?

1045
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,720
Whatever happens
in this family...

1046
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,520
...good or bad he is the one
who handles everything

1047
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,680
Ma, your eldest son
is for your home

1048
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,800
I am for our motherland

1049
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,880
Come to Trichy and
ask about your son

1050
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,760
For having given birth
to this perfect son...

1051
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,200
...they will praise you skyhigh!

1052
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,040
I've been such a good Samaritan

1053
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,960
Self praise is no recommendation!

1054
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,120
Your son has just stepped in
Why drag him into a fight?

1055
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,000
Go and get the 'sambar'

1056
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,800
What's the use of doing service
outside of our town?

1057
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,480
You should rule the roost here

1058
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,000
He is a king in his own right

1059
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,400
He rules his territory

1060
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,080
Why are you puzzled?

1061
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,640
Bhavani and his henchmen
were creating havoc in Madurai

1062
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,680
All of them were finished in
one shot in an encounter

1063
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,880
Who is the mastermind?

1064
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,320
'Your brother only'

1065
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,440
'What more good should he do?'

1066
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,040
'Those who borrowed from him
can roam happily now'

1067
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,640
'My grandfather Ramasamy
was a freedom fighter'

1068
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,840
'He was elected 4 times as minister'

1069
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,400
'He was very honest and upright'

1070
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,640
Why did you mention my name
at the police station?

1071
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,560
Father, I used your name
because Ponnusamy is my friend

1072
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,760
That's why

1073
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,760
Takes years to earn a good name

1074
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,920
To ruin the good reputation you have
painstakingly built, 1 minute is enough

1075
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,320
Forgive me, father

1076
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,920
Hereafter I will never
tarnish your name

1077
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,360
'From that moment onwards, my father
decided not to get involved in politics'

1078
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,000
'After my grandfather passed away...'

1079
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,360
'...many politicians asked
my father for his support'

1080
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,360
'He refused'

1081
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,160
Am I equal to a stranger, brother-in-law?

1082
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,080
After your father, shouldn't one
from our caste make a mark in politics?

1083
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,440
Sorry, Chinrasu

1084
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,160
I have promised my father
I will not get into politics

1085
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,840
You don't have to, brother-in-law

1086
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,000
I'll take your son with me

1087
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,640
'Chinrasu forced me
without giving me a choice'

1088
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,680
'On that day, my life
changed its course'

1089
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,040
'I went door to door asking
people to vote for Chinrasu'

1090
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,840
'That's when I realized how much
people respected my grandfather'

1091
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,160
'In that election
Chinrasu won thanks to me'

1092
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,600
'He became a minister'

1093
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,760
'In the next 4 years he was heaped
with money, name and fame'

1094
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,640
What's the use of all this money?

1095
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,480
People of our caste respect
only Mr Ramasamy's family

1096
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,640
Even worse!

1097
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,760
They claim but for that family's help
you couldn't even have won

1098
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,960
I have to win Ramasamy's family

1099
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,440
You show Selvam
the power of politics

1100
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,600
I'll spend 20 million for you
in this election

1101
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,320
So many random strangers use
your grandfather's name and win

1102
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,640
Why shouldn't you contest?

1103
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,480
Go ahead if that is
what you want, son

1104
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,800
But keep this in mind

1105
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,160
Not one rupee you earn in politics
should find its way into this house

1106
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,440
Similarly you shouldn't ask me
to spend for your political moves

1107
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,000
Okay, father

1108
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,400
'I trusted Venkatesh would keep
his word and stood in the election'

1109
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,960
'He betrayed me'

1110
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,200
'My friend Lal came to my rescue
and I campaigned day and night'

1111
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,800
'I fell at everyone's feet'

1112
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,800
'But despite my grandfather's name...'

1113
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,320
'...Chinrasu's money power
won him a sweeping majority'

1114
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,400
Long live
Leader Chinrasu!

1115
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,280
Name alone can't
guarantee victory, Selvam

1116
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,800
You need money too

1117
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,160
Keep it

1118
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,480
'More than the disappointment of losing...'

1119
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,160
'...advice from every Tom, Dick and
Harry was the worst torture possible'

1120
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,560
Whatever happens,
don't lose heart, Selvam

1121
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,200
Politics isn't a cakewalk, sonny

1122
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,000
Because you lost, Lakshmi is
discreetly having a dig at me

1123
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,080
Politics is not your kind of game
Don't get your hands dirty, sir

1124
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,200
The whole town thinks your defeat is
equal to Ramasamy sir himself losing

1125
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,400
To avoid our family name
from being tarnished...

1126
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,280
...I decided to turn
my back on politics

1127
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,440
'The desire within me to get
into politics turned into a frenzy'

1128
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,920
'I wanted to kick those who
looked at me with contempt'

1129
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,560
'To win in politics I realized
money was a necessary evil'

1130
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,000
'I was introduced to Bhavani
through my friend Lal'

1131
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,120
'We demanded money
from all the businessmen'

1132
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,120
'We killed those who didn't pay up
and thrashed them under the bridge'

1133
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,080
'The entire business clan got petrified'

1134
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,720
'We had access to money'

1135
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,000
'I made Lal befriend Chinrasu'

1136
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,560
'I am now aware of Chinrasu's
entire devious corrupt record'

1137
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,760
'I decided irrespective of
the men killed or millions spent'

1138
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,800
'...I should become a minister'

1139
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,360
Call for you

1140
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,200
Selvam, the one who killed
Bhavani and his boys-

1141
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,760
I know my brother did it

1142
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,000
What shall we do?

1143
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,760
He has come only to find out
about the sub inspector's murder

1144
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,240
He'll go back to Trichy

1145
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,920
He won't step into our space

1146
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:26,960
Ignore him

1147
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:27,920
Okay

1148
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,680
'Missing for some days at a stretch...'

1149
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,680
'...Rathnavel, owner of RK Jewelry
and chairman of New Polyton club'

1150
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,480
'...was found dead near Anamalai
under a bridge early this morning'

1151
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,320
Hello, Mr Jayaseelan

1152
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,640
We thought with Bhavani's death
everything was wrapped up

1153
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,240
My friend has fallen prey to it

1154
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,800
Jayaseelan, I want you to
handle this case officially

1155
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,160
You never told me about
your article in today's paper

1156
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,800
Sudden appointment

1157
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,600
Don't want to disturb sir

1158
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,160
Our 1st move is to meet
our city's topmost businessmen

1159
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,440
Arrange this immediately

1160
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,480
I am Jayaseelan

1161
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,160
I am in charge of this case

1162
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,640
Your fear
is their power

1163
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Rathnavel's murder last week...

1164
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,240
...has made us realize
there's a kingpin above Bhavani

1165
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,520
You will all receive
threatening calls soon

1166
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,000
Don't get scared

1167
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,160
Rathnavel was killed
because he snitched

1168
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,000
How can we be sure
we won't be killed too?

1169
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,560
For your sake didn't we also
lose a sub inspector?

1170
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,440
Even now I'm speaking
with your best interest at heart

1171
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,360
The only clue we hold is you

1172
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,000
Only if you support us
we can nab the culprit

1173
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,440
Hey Selvam!

1174
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,560
You said your brother
won't step into our space

1175
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,000
He's few inches behind us

1176
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,560
We'll all be caught

1177
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,400
Look here, Selvam

1178
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,920
First kill your brother

1179
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,360
Don't, brother

1180
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,280
What's your problem?

1181
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,160
When we killed a sub inspector
the entire police team has ganged up

1182
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,360
Risk is even more when this involves
an assistant commissioner

1183
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,360
No need

1184
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,080
Your son wants to
ask you something

1185
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,400
Tell your dad

1186
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,760
Dad, I want a small car

1187
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,600
When I come home for lunch
I'll get it for you, dear

1188
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:42,920
Okay?

1189
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,600
Selvam, listen to me

1190
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,480
Election is due in 6 months

1191
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,840
We can grab all the money
from businessmen by then

1192
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,560
Before my brother closes in
we'll finish our game and disperse

1193
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,000
Tell me

1194
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,080
Sir, police meeting, huh?

1195
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,120
Who is this?

1196
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,840
Only the 5 men found dead
under the bridge know our identity

1197
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,920
You arrange 20 million

1198
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Or you'll also be found
dead under the bridge

1199
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,600
Sir, let's inform the police

1200
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,840
We get a call when we've just
stepped out of the meeting with them

1201
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,280
That means his spy is right
inside the police department

1202
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,800
So should we be handing over
our money to whoever calls us?

1203
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,760
I have an idea

1204
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,680
There is a Muslim Bhai
in Tirunelveli known to me

1205
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,080
He is as notorious as
Bhavani of Madurai

1206
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,440
If we inform him and
ask him to send his goons...

1207
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,320
...we can nab the culprit

1208
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,760
He has 2 daughters

1209
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,480
Let's not invite trouble

1210
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,320
Just give them the money

1211
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,560
Why risk your life?

1212
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,600
I've given my 2 pennies' worth

1213
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,880
Let's go

1214
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,720
Bro?

1215
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,880
Going out?

1216
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,400
Yes, to the office

1217
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,880
I've given my car for servicing

1218
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,280
Can you drop me
at the market?

1219
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,120
Sure, bro

1220
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,320
What, ma?

1221
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,240
Your father's medicine is over

1222
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,280
Will you buy it on your way back?

1223
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,280
Okay, ma

1224
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,200
Where are you going
at this time of night?

1225
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,120
I've got a lead about
that businessman's kidnapping

1226
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,640
I'm going to investigate

1227
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,000
Just stop at the kerb here

1228
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,920
Okay, bro

1229
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,600
Bye, anna

1230
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,960
Aadhi, follow my brother

1231
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,360
Lal, cancel tonight's meeting

1232
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,360
What happened?

1233
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,560
My brother got wind of it

1234
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,440
No chance

1235
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,680
This businessman would not
have breathed a word

1236
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,640
He's a wimp

1237
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,760
Cancel it now

1238
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,320
My brother himself told me
he has found a clue about us

1239
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,000
Meeting tonight is cancelled, sir

1240
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,480
I haven't told anyone, sir

1241
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,920
Pccht!
Cancel, sir

1242
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,040
- When will we meet then?
- I'll let you know

1243
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:31,960
Where is he?

1244
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:32,960
Residency hotel

1245
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:33,920
With a girl

1246
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,520
Where...Residency?

1247
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,080
Shall I shoot a video, bro?

1248
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,520
Don't be silly
Come back

1249
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,000
I wanted to tell you first

1250
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,040
Then decided to
tell you later

1251
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,840
Selvam, he lied to you and
went somewhere on the sly

1252
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,120
If he was meeting a girl
will he tell me the truth?

1253
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,880
Shift the meeting to
tomorrow night

1254
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,800
Okay, bro

1255
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,480
For a minute
I was petrified

1256
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,880
When you knew he was a rowdy
your love didn't bloom

1257
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,760
It blossomed when
you knew he is a cop

1258
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,880
How, huh?

1259
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,240
Just like how
we fell in love

1260
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,480
Sowmya...?

1261
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,560
I was-

1262
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,360
Dai!!

1263
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,160
When you will flirt...

1264
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,240
...how you will react

1265
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,920
...I know all of that from A to Z

1266
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,400
If you cross the limit
rascal, I'll tear you to bits

1267
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,120
Some family problem, I think

1268
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,600
Tell me

1269
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,320
If you won't get me wrong-

1270
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,680
It's okay, tell me

1271
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,400
Just once

1272
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,960
Will you pay the bill?

1273
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,120
Don't you have cash?

1274
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,760
"Persian silk tree
Satiny and glossy"

1275
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,160
"In my heart blossom
You're most welcome"

1276
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,640
"Sweet red cherry
My tutti-fruity"

1277
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,200
"Sip my lips, honey
Come to satiate me"

1278
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,640
"Caresses constant
fear now absent"

1279
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,320
"Wherever you hold
now no longer cold"

1280
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,040
"Buds of desires on display"

1281
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,240
"Dresses top to bottom too gave way"

1282
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,920
"Marriage alliance
Got clearance"

1283
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,320
"Happiness spread its bed twosome
Lips roamed a welcome lovesome"

1284
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,680
"Tease me, come
My hulk so handsome"

1285
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,600
"Pink silk tree
Sparkling and silvery"

1286
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:04,320
"Bloom and blossom
In my soul most welcome"

1287
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,040
"If an eagle grabs me
in front of people many"

1288
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,520
"How will you save me?"

1289
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,440
"In my hands I'll hold you
folding you into two"

1290
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,840
"And in my pocket hide you"

1291
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,280
"If I'm swept away by the Vaigai river"

1292
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,320
"How will you rescue me, dear ruler?"

1293
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,440
"I'll swim then
like a water hen"

1294
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,280
"Gather you to my chest
And carry you, my princess"

1295
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,440
"My dear girlfriend
Don't be frightened"

1296
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:08,200
"Even if the howdah tilts to fall
the tusker elephant will stand tall"

1297
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:14,600
"Please me, come
Nourish me wholesome"

1298
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,160
"Silk tree scented sweet
Rich red tipped flowered treat"

1299
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,880
"In my mind blossom
You're most welcome"

1300
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,760
"In a cactus forest very thick
an elephant attacks double quick"

1301
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,280
"How will you save me, think?"

1302
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,440
"I'll lift you with one sweep
Take you to a hill top steep"

1303
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,720
"Topple the elephant down deep"

1304
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,400
"In its jaws ferocious
if a lion grabs me vicious"

1305
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:02,720
"How will you, warrior victorious
save my life that's so precious?"

1306
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,080
"I'll turn into a pouncing tiger
Till ravines deep I'll overpower"

1307
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,160
"I'll take my parakeet pretty
Snuggle her into bed with me"

1308
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:15,160
"Let us swim in sweat, tussle sweet
within folds of the sheet, love-retreat"

1309
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,520
"Silk tree deciduous
nectar source delicious"

1310
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,360
"Blossom within my body
Let's make a rhapsody"

1311
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,400
"Sweet red cherry
My tutti-fruity"

1312
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,720
"Sip my lips, fairy
Freely f(l)avor me"

1313
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,800
"Caresses constant
fear now absent"

1314
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,560
"Wherever you hold
now no longer cold"

1315
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,280
"Buds of desires on display"

1316
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,520
"Dresses A to Z too gave way"

1317
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,240
"Marriage alliance
Got clearance"

1318
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:48,680
"Tucked in happiness, twosome
Lips quenched a thirsty welcome"

1319
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,680
"Gratify me generously"

1320
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:04,000
"Nemunoki, my exotic silk tree
Satisfy me soulfully"

1321
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,960
Drive straight and turn left

1322
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,320
The car just crossed

1323
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,800
The car is approaching

1324
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,320
Stop at a power grid
to your right

1325
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,280
I'll come there, sir

1326
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,440
Yes, Muruga

1327
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,600
Car has crossed, bro

1328
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,560
Bro...?

1329
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,920
Hey! Lakshminarayanan

1330
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,960
Did you think some jackass
is threatening you

1331
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,920
And you could bring
your boys and thrash us?

1332
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:10,720
No, sir

1333
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,440
- Huh?
- No, sir

1334
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,600
You thought if Bhavani is dead
everything is over?

1335
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,800
Bhavani is my man

1336
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,960
- Hey!
- Bro?

1337
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,560
Check if the amount is right

1338
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,480
Lakshminarayanan

1339
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,120
Punishment for your blunder

1340
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,440
I will give you a list

1341
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
From every businessman on
that list you must collect 20 million

1342
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
And hand it over to me personally

1343
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,520
You'll get a call specifying
when and where

1344
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,600
You think I am lying?

1345
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,480
That girl was painting
the town red with your son

1346
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,640
Isn't it wrong for a girl
to chase a boy so madly?

1347
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,640
That's why I told
your son to agree

1348
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,880
He was the one
who proposed first, dad

1349
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,280
My sister didn't agree at all

1350
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,920
She said she won't utter a word
unless you are okay with him

1351
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,880
Sis-in-law, just say the word

1352
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,040
He'll pack his bags
say 'tata' to his parents

1353
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,440
And be at our doorstep

1354
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,160
Actually he said he would
come home and talk to you, dad

1355
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,720
Akka objected to it

1356
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,560
Murugesa, you said they won't
nitpick on caste and community

1357
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,280
Yes

1358
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,480
If they are not particular about caste
let's meet at a common place

1359
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,400
I feel it is a good alliance

1360
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,520
Let's meet him first

1361
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,600
Sir, tell me

1362
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,600
Is the entire amount ready?

1363
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,800
Almost ready, sir

1364
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,440
Just 6 more have to give, sir

1365
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,280
They will give it to me
by tonight, sir

1366
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,560
Tomorrow if you tell me
when and where I should be...

1367
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,200
...I'll bring the entire amount

1368
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,120
We will let you know about
the venue tomorrow night

1369
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,280
Tell me

1370
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,080
Cash will be ready by tonight

1371
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,240
He wants to know where-

1372
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,200
We'll talk later

1373
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,640
Sir, I'm here

1374
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,040
Please take a seat

1375
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,640
Good afternoon

1376
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,920
She's my wife

1377
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,680
This is my eldest son

1378
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,280
He is into exporting jasmine

1379
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,440
Oh! That's very good

1380
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,520
In my house, it's just me
and my 2 daughters

1381
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:47,440
My wife died when
my eldest daughter was 12

1382
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,560
I'm not too keen to get
my daughter married to a cop

1383
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,320
Still I'm here because
my daughter likes him

1384
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,600
Sir, what's your problem
if my brother is a policeman?

1385
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,120
If you and I are at peace today...

1386
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,080
...credit goes only
to the police force

1387
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,040
5 years since my brother stayed
with us for 2 days at a stretch

1388
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,280
Do you know that?

1389
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,520
Do you have any hassles
with the police-

1390
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,360
No, sir

1391
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,160
Just a common opinion, that's all

1392
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,120
I've brought up both my sons with
values my father Ramasamy upheld

1393
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,440
If your daughter marries
my son, she'll be very happy

1394
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,080
I can guarantee that

1395
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,280
Thank you, sir

1396
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,360
We can choose an auspicious day
and have a formal engagement

1397
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,680
Glad to hear that

1398
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,680
We can finalize a day
in mid-January itself

1399
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,480
Okay

1400
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,840
Shall we take leave?

1401
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,200
Thank you

1402
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,640
Good afternoon

1403
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,680
Tell me, uncle

1404
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,800
Can I just meet you
for 10 minutes?

1405
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,800
My parents did not
accept the alliance?

1406
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,800
All that went off well

1407
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,280
This is about something else

1408
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,320
Come to my office, uncle

1409
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,400
I'll come right away

1410
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,560
I'm at the accident spot, sir

1411
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:20,320
The van driver escaped after
a headlong collision onto the car

1412
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,800
The people in the car
behind Lakshminarayan...

1413
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,960
...have rushed him to the hospital

1414
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,560
Did anyone note the car number?

1415
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,760
I'll find out and
let you know at once, sir

1416
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,320
Pardon me, sir

1417
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,960
I didn't kill you

1418
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,120
Fate is your Yama

1419
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,560
In the form of my brother

1420
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,080
If my brother hadn't
met your daughter

1421
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,000
If you hadn't accepted
your daughter's preference

1422
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,240
You won't be killed by me

1423
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,040
Don't kill me, sonny

1424
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,360
I haven't told anyone anything

1425
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,920
Dad...!

1426
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,320
Before he passed away
your father called me

1427
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,200
I don't know what
he wanted to tell me

1428
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,920
Before he could meet me-

1429
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,400
Did he say anything
confidential to you?

1430
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,080
2 weeks ago
he was very upset

1431
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,880
When I asked him
what was troubling him...

1432
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,440
...he said 'just business issue'

1433
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,960
Who would be so vengeful
as to murder my dad-

1434
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,080
I don't know

1435
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,520
Last conversation I had
with him, he said...

1436
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,080
'You like him, don't you?'

1437
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,960
'Don't worry, I'll finalize
and then call you, dear'

1438
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,800
'Those were his last words to me'

1439
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:08,960
Sowmya, don't cry

1440
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,640
Sir, I want to share a vital
piece of news with you

1441
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:23,480
Tell me

1442
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,840
5 days after we arrested Bhavani...

1443
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,280
...owner of Kamatchi mills
got a threatening call

1444
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,680
Based on his information to us
we tailed his car discreetly

1445
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,560
Getting wind of our presence
they cancelled the meeting

1446
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,680
Same time we tried to trace
Rathnavel's phone call

1447
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,680
But we couldn't, sir

1448
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,840
Because he passed on
information to us...

1449
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,800
...they killed him
the very next day

1450
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,800
As per our records, fingerprints of
the 5 businessmen who were killed...

1451
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,040
...do not match
the post mortem reports

1452
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,720
Even Bhavani's fingerprint
doesn't match at all

1453
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,400
It is easy to find a culprit
if he has a criminal record

1454
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:00,240
But really tough to nab a culprit
who merges with the public

1455
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,520
Sir, from what you say
we don't have any clue

1456
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,240
Then how do we
nab the assailant?

1457
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,040
Why did you want to
meet me urgently?

1458
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,160
To nab the gang
threatening businessmen

1459
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,120
What's your idea?

1460
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:17,800
After Lakshminarayan's murder
businessmen are terrified

1461
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,000
Definitely they won't inform us
if they are threatened again

1462
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,760
This gang so far
hasn't threatened...

1463
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,320
...the public, politicians, judges,
Govt officials or any such sector

1464
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,960
They target only businessmen

1465
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,960
Business tycoons in our city
will only be 60-70

1466
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,120
If we tap their phones
without their knowledge...

1467
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,960
...when the gang contacts them
we will be in the loop, sir

1468
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,240
If we follow them
we can nab them for sure

1469
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,600
What are you saying?

1470
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,840
If this leaks out, there will be
a huge hue and cry

1471
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,920
This is our only trump card

1472
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,960
Okay, handle it discreetly

1473
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,240
Another small request

1474
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,960
From our force I need
200 of our retired policemen

1475
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,480
200 cops...why?

1476
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,120
Trust me, I'll tell you later, sir

1477
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:12,240
Inform me if you get
any suspicious calls

1478
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:16,120
Till this operation is completed
volunteers here have no personal life

1479
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,280
Work on multiple shifts

1480
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,800
You wanted to talk
to me personally?

1481
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,160
- Yes, anna
- Tell me

1482
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,760
I've been appointed to handle
the murder case of that businessman

1483
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,120
I know that already

1484
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,880
Are you scared?

1485
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,320
I'm worried something untoward
might happen to you or our family

1486
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,000
Definitely they will
target you to get me

1487
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,840
Be on your guard
when you go to the market

1488
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,720
Same time, take care
of our family too

1489
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,720
You are getting worked up
for no reason

1490
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
No, anna

1491
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,960
We can't brush them off like that

1492
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,080
They are beasts with
no iota of compassion

1493
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,200
Psycho

1494
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,520
The more I zero in on them
they will stoop low to any level

1495
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,480
But I will definitely
catch them soon, anna

1496
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,440
I know how good you are

1497
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,720
You'll nab them for sure

1498
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,040
You attend to your work

1499
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,360
I'll take care of the rest

1500
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,360
Okay, bro

1501
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,600
Did you see the mail
I sent this morning, sir?

1502
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,640
I did, sir

1503
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,520
I've collected all of it
just as you specified

1504
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,680
Where should I deliver?

1505
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,760
I'll let you know
by 11:00 p.m

1506
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,600
They are ready with the cash

1507
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,760
Is that so?

1508
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,840
I'll be there in a while
We'll take it forward

1509
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,760
Really?

1510
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,080
Are you sure?

1511
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,280
Confirmed, sir

1512
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,360
When did they say
they would call back?

1513
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,480
11:00 p.m, sir

1514
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,280
I'll be there right away

1515
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,600
This is our 1st call last night

1516
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,680
8:30 p.m

1517
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,800
Call from the same number now

1518
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,000
Call got disconnected

1519
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,640
Mr Manikandan, I had asked
for a retired police team

1520
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,840
Ready and waiting, sir

1521
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,240
Reasons I selected you
for this operation are...

1522
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,560
...you should merge
with the public

1523
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,960
Same time, possess
the courage of a policeman

1524
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,480
This threatening gang have
asked the businessmen...

1525
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,840
...to come to the outskirts
to extort money from them

1526
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,040
There are 6 routes
to this venue

1527
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,560
Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga,
Natham, Virudhunagar, Tuticorin

1528
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,160
But we don't know
the route they will choose

1529
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,440
So if we tail their car, their informers
planted en route will get suspicious

1530
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,240
We keep changing cars
at every junction

1531
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,960
If you inform me
at every juncture...

1532
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,480
...I'll also keep changing cars

1533
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,840
Only then they won't
suspect anything

1534
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,960
Finally with your support...

1535
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,200
...we can nab that gang tonight

1536
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,320
He has left his house, sir

1537
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,800
"To be the victor
and vanquisher"

1538
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,600
His car is approaching

1539
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,680
"To be the subduer
And subjugator"

1540
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,840
"Every stride with sheer power
To hunt here is this bold tiger"

1541
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,120
"For the foe to shiver
For the army to retire"

1542
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,080
"Here comes the pouncing tiger"

1543
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,520
"When it snaps and traps
even mountains collapse"

1544
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,720
"Who can stop his fast advance?"

1545
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,520
"The ruthless predatory beast
The tiger ready for its feast"

1546
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,680
Ford Ikon
Silver

1547
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,400
"The best camouflage expert
Here to hunt its preys perfect"

1548
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,720
"For the foe to quiver
For the army to retire"

1549
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,280
"Here comes the relentless tiger"

1550
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,200
"When it snaps and grasps-"

1551
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,960
Down the bridge
car has turned right

1552
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,320
"Who can halt its progress?"

1553
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:55,120
"Provoked police officer
Is now the pouncing tiger"

1554
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,800
"Has our earth ever seen
a world bereft of a battlefield?"

1555
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,920
"India's world war
is not over by far"

1556
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:07,480
"Has our earth ever seen
a world without a war field?"

1557
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,640
"India's most savage war
is not over by far"

1558
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:15,000
"To be the defender
And the defeater"

1559
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,120
"Best camouflage expert
Here to hunt its preys perfect"

1560
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,480
"For the foe to quiver
For the army to retire"

1561
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,200
"Here comes the frenzied tiger"

1562
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,800
"When it attacks to catch
even mountains are no match"

1563
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:28,440
"Who can block its war path?"

1564
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,680
Sir, car is speeding straight

1565
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,000
What's the car number?

1566
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,200
2696
White Indica

1567
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,560
I'll take it from here

1568
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:08,960
"One with alcohol intoxicated
Or by adulation dominated"

1569
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:12,920
"He won't dillydally in vain
to kill another for personal gain"

1570
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:17,560
"Even if God tries to stall
he won't show mercy at all"

1571
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:21,120
"By alcohol possessed?
Fame and name obsessed?"

1572
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,520
Bro, car has crossed

1573
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,840
"Has our earth ever seen
a world bereft of a battlefield?"

1574
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,000
"India's world war
is not over by far"

1575
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:35,400
"Has our earth ever seen
a world without a war field?"

1576
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,240
"India's gruesome war
is not over by far"

1577
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,720
"The warrior
The winner"

1578
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,360
Car has crossed, bro

1579
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,320
Start the car

1580
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,840
- Hey! Selvam
- What?

1581
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,200
Your brother

1582
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,320
We are done for

1583
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:48,720
Selvam-

1584
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,800
Don't panic

1585
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,160
Start the car

1586
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,600
Take that one way road

1587
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:53,400
Okay, anna

1588
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:55,680
Our faces won't be seen
in the head lights' beam

1589
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,440
Go

1590
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,640
He's here

1591
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,400
Turn...turn

1592
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,000
Go...go

1593
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,240
Get down from the car

1594
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:23,640
Mr Manikandan

1595
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,680
They have entered
Jain puram area

1596
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,840
Spread...move

1597
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,240
Lal, get up

1598
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,640
Quick...you go

1599
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:04,680
Escape

1600
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,160
You go

1601
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,280
Don't shoot, sir

1602
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,840
It's me...me...Lal

1603
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:20,920
Take him to the hospital

1604
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,800
Sir, there's a man
sprawled over there

1605
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,280
Anna...!

1606
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:02,200
What happened?

1607
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:03,360
Why are you here?

1608
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,440
Go after him

1609
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,600
Velu, take him to the hospital

1610
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,160
Hurry up!

1611
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,400
Gently...it hurts

1612
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:14,840
Don't worry, bro
Be brave

1613
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,880
You went alone
to the theatre?

1614
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,600
I went with my friend, sir

1615
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,960
- What's his name?
- Vinod, sir

1616
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:30,960
Where is he?

1617
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,360
He died in the gunfire
last night, sir

1618
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,600
Because I deal with flowers...

1619
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,200
...we load our trucks
only after 2:00 a.m

1620
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:55,840
I went for a late night show
so as not to fall asleep

1621
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,920
Did you see
your assailant's face?

1622
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,760
Wasn't very clear

1623
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,560
He just started shooting
whomever he saw

1624
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:03,760
When he shot at me...

1625
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,360
...I covered my face
with my hand

1626
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:07,800
The bullet missed my chest
by the fraction of a second

1627
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,920
Take care of yourself, anna

1628
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,200
Father, stay with him

1629
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,880
Tell me, bro

1630
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,600
Has Adithya come with the cash?

1631
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,520
Yes, bro

1632
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,080
Our Lal got caught

1633
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,400
I know

1634
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,880
He can't stand pain

1635
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,080
He'll betray us

1636
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,360
The police will start
interrogating him now

1637
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,600
Kill him

1638
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,440
What, bro?

1639
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,560
Kill Lal

1640
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,160
Get unknown men to do it

1641
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:51,080
Okay, bro

1642
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,680
Sir, don't shoot

1643
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,600
Take the accused
with you, sir

1644
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,720
I'll handle this

1645
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:52,840
Careful

1646
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,560
Get him into an auto

1647
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,880
Go...fast

1648
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:55,160
Watch your step

1649
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,520
Seat him inside

1650
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,320
I'll just go to the restroom

1651
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:25,880
I should have-

1652
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,720
It's okay

1653
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:28,680
It's my fault

1654
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:29,960
I should've balanced it

1655
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,000
I'll call you
if I need you again

1656
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,400
Come

1657
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,400
Why did you play this drama?

1658
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,000
The person we will be
enquiring is no ordinary man

1659
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,320
He's a lawyer

1660
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,360
We can't hit him

1661
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,640
He has to come out
with the truth by himself

1662
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:48,120
Worst pain in this world is betrayal

1663
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,960
That's why
I enacted this byplay

1664
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,480
'Why are my own men
trying to kill me?'

1665
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,880
By now this question
will be buzzing in his head

1666
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,240
According to my calculation...

1667
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,480
...he'll blurt out the truth
of his own accord now

1668
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,440
You have 2 children, sir?

1669
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,640
If he had really
finished you off...

1670
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:32,560
...you would have
been dead by now

1671
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,400
I know however much
I interrogate or hit you...

1672
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,280
...you won't confess

1673
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:45,480
But-

1674
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,680
I will

1675
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,600
I'll tell you

1676
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,880
Who, sir?

1677
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,160
He's no one else but-

1678
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:02,000
He's your-

1679
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,240
Hey! Who are you?

1680
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,480
They paid me, I killed

1681
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,080
Whaat?

1682
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,120
Who paid you?

1683
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,560
I am trying my younger son
But he isn't picking up

1684
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,960
We brought an accused to
the station this morning, right?

1685
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,520
He just died

1686
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,000
- What?
- They shot him

1687
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,320
Who sent you here?

1688
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,480
He's busy with that case

1689
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,360
I'll tell him to call you
as soon as he is free

1690
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,080
Open your mouth and tell me

1691
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,600
Hello, what happened?
Did you finish off Lal?

1692
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:55,800
Yes, they finished him

1693
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,600
Father, what are you saying?

1694
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,440
I don't get it

1695
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,600
You wanted Lal
to be killed

1696
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,080
They killed him

1697
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,280
What are you doing?

1698
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:17,000
Is my son a murderer?

1699
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,960
I can't believe it

1700
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,880
How can you go
against your conscience?

1701
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,680
All that's crap!

1702
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:29,200
In 6 months your son
will become a minister

1703
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,360
No one gave me the seat
on a golden platter

1704
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,200
I've given 300 million
as kickback!

1705
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:37,640
Chinrasu wanted to show off
he is more affluent than us

1706
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,240
He instigated a desire for politics
in me when I was least interested

1707
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,280
And betrayed me
through Venkatesh

1708
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,000
How can I forget that, father?

1709
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,600
I lost my mind too

1710
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,800
I decided to stand as
an independent candidate

1711
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:52,000
I begged for votes door to door
using my grandfather's name

1712
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,800
But did they vote for me?

1713
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,080
They didn't

1714
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:58,880
For a mere 500 and 1000 bucks,
they made Chinrasu win again

1715
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,000
World has changed now

1716
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,040
Money is politics

1717
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,480
I can understand
if politicians are prejudiced

1718
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,840
But people have become
selfish opportunists

1719
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:16,080
80,000 voted for you
respecting my father

1720
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:17,480
Are they opportunists?

1721
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:20,280
They are all naive like me

1722
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,680
Don't know how to survive

1723
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,560
But I somehow managed

1724
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,080
I want to win only those
200000 who defeated me

1725
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,680
Father, you didn't hear anything

1726
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,640
You know nothing

1727
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,320
Okay?

1728
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,160
Let this remain
between us

1729
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,920
Our family life will change
for the better, father

1730
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:51,360
If you think what I'm doing is wrong
and insist on sneaking to my brother...

1731
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,920
...then your father's name
will only be put to shame

1732
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:58,680
If I get arrested, I will be
black listed by this whole town

1733
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,600
My brother's life

1734
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,440
My sister's wedding

1735
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,120
Think about all this
and then decide

1736
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,520
'He is no one else but-'

1737
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:27,000
'Could it be a minister
Commissioner...?'

1738
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,440
'Inspector'

1739
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,560
'He's your-'

1740
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:39,800
Hello, sir

1741
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,560
From the last words spoken
by Lal, I've prepared a list

1742
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:46,280
I doubt the names listed here

1743
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,400
Enquire discreetly

1744
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,280
Why did you take this route?

1745
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:04,280
Who knew?

1746
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:22,160
He's one of them

1747
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,040
1 more

1748
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:26,880
Of these two
1 is alive

1749
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,360
This is the chap we enquired
in the hospital

1750
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,720
This is your brother

1751
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,400
1 more

1752
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,520
He's also dead

1753
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,680
He has escaped after
this chap was shot

1754
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,240
After these 3 men...

1755
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,000
...based on the sound-

1756
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,720
First 2 bullets

1757
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,040
Then 1

1758
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,240
Again 2 bullets

1759
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,560
Then 1 more

1760
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,920
By this calculation, 2 bullets
should've pierced my brother

1761
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,880
One bullet could have
missed your brother?

1762
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:09,320
Then the last one to die
should have only 1 bullet in him

1763
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,000
But 2 bullets have
lodged into him

1764
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:15,080
According to the order,
he should be here

1765
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,800
And anna should be there

1766
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:53,680
Are you suspecting
your own brother?

1767
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,240
Dress and height match, dude

1768
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,960
Why couldn't my bro
have shot him?

1769
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,880
And pretend
he had been shot?

1770
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:05,960
But why should he do all this?

1771
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,960
Tell me, Das

1772
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,800
- You should certainly make it
- Oh yes, I'll be there

1773
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,240
Wedding is in Kerala

1774
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,680
I think there are 2 invitations

1775
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,680
You've given me 2 by mistake

1776
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,680
2 cards are stuck

1777
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,960
2 cards are stuck
to each other

1778
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:37,480
From the list you gave
the fingerprints of the accused...

1779
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:40,080
...matches only your
brother's fingerprints

1780
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,080
I gave money too

1781
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,240
How is it I lost?

1782
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:24,800
Wondering how
they gave me a seat?

1783
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,480
I reported all your corrupt acts
through Lal to the higher authorities

1784
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:29,720
Lal was actually my man

1785
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:32,160
Money doesn't help
at all times, uncle

1786
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,000
You also need a good name

1787
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:35,480
See you?

1788
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:37,400
Very happy

1789
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,720
Don't create a ruckus

1790
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:41,960
Enjoy the feast

1791
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,240
Murugesan has accepted
to work for us

1792
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:47,120
Is that right?
Super, bro

1793
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,440
Tell me

1794
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,360
Okay, I'll come

1795
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,600
I got a seat, father

1796
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:30,280
In 6 months your son
will become a minister

1797
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:33,480
From today I'll stop
all my criminal acts

1798
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,840
I'll be a honest politician
like my grandfather

1799
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,040
I swear on you, father

1800
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:41,200
I wish you could be alive
and see all this happen

1801
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,840
Hey! What?

1802
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:46,800
Has he come?

1803
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,080
I'll be there
in 10 minutes

1804
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,840
Even if I request you not to tell
my brother you won't listen to me

1805
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:56,640
Because you are
a chip off the old block

1806
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:58,920
- Cheenu
- Bro?

1807
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,240
Mother, you called
saying father is missing

1808
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,240
Where did he go?

1809
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,720
He didn't pick
my call either

1810
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,160
Your father is back home, son

1811
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,440
Anna brought father home

1812
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:57,720
Your brother hit me
on my head with a rod, son

1813
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,120
- Murugesa, where are you?
- I'm in the station

1814
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:24,440
Okay, along with inspector Mani-

1815
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,560
Son, don't involve the police

1816
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:27,960
Father?

1817
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,680
Tell him not to bring
the police in please

1818
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,160
- Murugesa
- Yes, dude

1819
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:35,960
Wait, I'll call you back

1820
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,680
Why, father?

1821
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,440
Don't arrest him

1822
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:40,840
Kill him

1823
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,480
Otherwise the name and respect
accumulated by your grandfather

1824
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:50,480
...will go to the dogs, son

1825
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:54,320
Instead kill this cutthroat son
of mine with your own hands

1826
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:03,360
Don't, bro

1827
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,480
Don't do it

1828
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,360
Like our grandfather I wanted
to become a great politician

1829
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:09,480
Fate brought me to this spot

1830
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:12,480
How many people have you killed
without your conscience pricking you?

1831
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,120
Now to kill our father...

1832
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,000
...how did you turn
into a beast, anna?

1833
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:17,240
Fierce hatred

1834
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,400
Political frenzy

1835
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:22,120
Please forgive me, bro

1836
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,360
I know you very well

1837
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,640
There's no other way, right?

1838
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,720
It's alright

1839
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:34,800
Kill me

1840
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,680
Kill me

1841
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:45,920
Finish me off once for all

1842
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:48,680
Kill...!

1843
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,840
No

1844
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,840
Don't go there

1845
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,840
Listen to me

1846
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:03,520
Kill me

1847
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:57,840
Go ahead, do it

1848
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,320
Hey murderer!

1849
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,240
Let go of my son

1850
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:08,000
Dai! Leave him alone

1851
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:10,680
Let go of him

1852
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:25,800
Jeyaseelan!

1853
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,800
Father, are you okay?

1854
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:47,680
What hap-

1855
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,400
He's coming back at you

1856
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:36,040
'In the serial killings of
entrepreneurs in Madurai...'

1857
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:39,320
'...last night another businessman
named Selvaraj was murdered'

1858
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:42,440
'He was the grandson of
ex-minister Ramasamy'

1859
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:45,000
'The 4 culprits responsible
for these murders...'

1860
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,800
'...Murugan, Aadhi, Logu, Seenu'

1861
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,640
'...were arrested by ACP Jeyaseelan
and his force early this morning'
