00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
'TARAK'

2
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,520
Dear, come on.
Let's go.

3
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,480
Greetings.
- Greetings.

4
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,280
May God bless you.

5
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,720
How long will you
continue this penance?

6
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,760
Until my heart is purified
and I reach my motive.

7
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,360
Sir, weren't you the one who
was collecting footwear outside?

8
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
Yes, it was him.

9
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
He is the chairman
of TR Food Company.

10
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,080
He is Mr. Tarak Ram.

11
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,680
Sir, we use the spices
sold by your company.

12
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,640
Thank you.

13
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,080
Being such an eminent personality,
you are..

14
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
Who is an eminent person?

15
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
We all stand at the same place

16
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,040
and pray to the same God.

17
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,600
Sir, what about the veneration?
- Go ahead.

18
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,520
You know the name, right?
It's Tarak.

19
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,080
"Tarak."

20
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,040
"His strike is very powerful."

21
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,720
"This macho will excel.."

22
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,320
"His talk is so mesmerising."

23
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,880
"There's no gentleman like him."

24
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,320
"No one can stand against him."

25
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,400
"Come on, you stranger.
You set the trend."

26
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,680
"Come on, you stranger.
We follow you."

27
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,200
"Tarak.."

28
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,080
"Tarak.."

29
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
"Tarak.."

30
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
"Tarak.."

31
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,560
"Tarak.."

32
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,040
"Tarak.."

33
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,000
"He can stand calm against
the current of the waves."

34
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,960
"His kindness is mightier
than the Everest."

35
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
"We footsteps are indelible."

36
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,680
"He is furious and enthralling."

37
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
"There's no gentleman like him."

38
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,720
"No one can stand against him."

39
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,840
"Come on, you stranger.
You set the trend."

40
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,040
"Come on, you stranger.
We follow you."

41
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,400
"Tarak.."

42
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
"Tarak.."

43
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,800
"He is the Greek God
of every girl."

44
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
"He is an ideal man
from a reputed clan."

45
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,480
"His words are as powerful
as a tiger's roar."

46
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,560
"He can send shivers
down anyone's spine."

47
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,560
"There's no gentleman like him."

48
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
"No one can stand against him."

49
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,880
"Come on, you stranger.
You set the trend."

50
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,800
"Come on, you stranger.
We follow you."

51
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
"Come on, you stranger.
You set the trend."

52
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,680
"Come on, you stranger.
We follow you."

53
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,680
"Tarak.."

54
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,440
'Happy birthday, Tarak!'

55
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,440
'You disappear into thin air
on your birthday, every year.'

56
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,040
'Happy birthday, Tarak..'

57
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,840
'Happy birthday to you.'

58
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,240
Tell me, Grandpa.

59
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,320
Tarak, happy birthday.
- Thank you, Grandpa.

60
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,880
I wanted to talk to you
as it's your birthday.

61
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,360
I was busy.
- I know.

62
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
A lot of people maybe calling you.
May God bless you.

63
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
I will not take
too much of your time.

64
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,000
I have only one question.
- I know what it is.

65
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,520
You want to know if I'll come
to India at least this year, right?

66
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,400
My answer is the same.
I can't come.

67
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,360
Today is a special day.

68
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,120
So, I had hoped that you'd tell me
some good news.

69
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,280
Grandpa, I can send you
a photo of mine if you wish.

70
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
Only those who have departed
should be seen in photographs.

71
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,840
I want to see you in person.

72
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,200
It's difficult, Grandpa.
- Hey.. Don't come

73
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,480
if it's going to be difficult.

74
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,600
I'll wait for another year.

75
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,760
But I really wish to see you.

76
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
I had last seen you
when you were eight years old.

77
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
I wonder how you look now.

78
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,880
Then, why don't you come here?

79
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
I have fear of heights.
I feel so dizzy.

80
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,520
Do you really think
I can travel by flight?

81
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,480
No way. Even if I do travel

82
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,440
I am not sure if I'll be alive.

83
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
How do I
explain it to you, Grandpa?

84
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,480
Please try to understand.

85
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay, dear.

86
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,440
But remember one thing.

87
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,680
I don't have anyone except you.

88
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,920
I have nothing except you.

89
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,040
Oh, God! Grandpa is so annoying.

90
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,360
Well..
- Tell me.

91
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,320
Everyone has grown up and evolved

92
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,360
but grandpa hasn't changed a bit.

93
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,000
Right. Feelings and relationships
never change, come what may.

94
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,040
Ms. Sarasamma,
you talk as if it's all my fault.

95
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,560
Many people like me consider
your grandpa to be their God.

96
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,880
Even though God has
thousands of visitors

97
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,760
He searches for the one He likes.

98
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Similarly, your grandpa
longs to see you.

99
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,760
For me, he's just my grandpa.

100
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,360
And you're my God.

101
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,920
You always shut my mouth
by saying this.

102
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,000
Look, you've given me
so much of love

103
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,560
you've considered me your mother

104
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,000
and you've also taught me
how to survive abroad.

105
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,880
You've even taught me
a little bit of English.

106
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,280
But you've forgotten
that I am an Indian. - Me?

107
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,040
Yes!
Since you consider me your God

108
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
this would be a temple, right?
- Yes!

109
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,000
Then, we need a girl
to light a lamp in this temple.

110
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,160
Is that all? - Yes!
- Okay, done.

111
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,440
Really? - Definitely,
Ms. Sarasamma! - So sweet!

112
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,680
I'll go and get ready.
- Where are you going?

113
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,800
Don't you know?

114
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,080
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

115
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,160
Who are you, ma'am? Why are
you standing here? Come in.

116
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,800
Come in. - I am..
- Come inside first.

117
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,800
Come in.

118
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,760
You went there to study.
I agreed to that.

119
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,720
You said you'll work there.
I agreed to that as well.

120
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,480
I had promised my sister that I'd
get her daughter married to you.

121
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,080
Even you knew about it.

122
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
But now..

123
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,120
You've bought home a girl
who doesn't know our language.

124
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,320
I know your language, feelings

125
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,600
and your lifestyle too.

126
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,800
Please give me one chance.
- No way!

127
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,240
He's my bloodline,
he belongs to my clan.

128
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Leave him here with me.

129
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,720
You can keep him with you
if he wishes to stay.

130
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Hey..
- Mom!

131
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,320
Dad..

132
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,160
Yes? - My birthday party
will be ruined if you're sad.

133
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
What happened?

134
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,640
My father will never accept us.

135
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,600
One must never get stuck

136
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,360
between love and family.

137
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm the reason
for all of this, right?

138
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,160
Hey..

139
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,960
No.. It's nothing like that.

140
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
Both love and family
are important but..

141
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
It's difficult
to handle them together.

142
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,760
I'll go for a drive.
It'll freshen up my mind. Okay?

143
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,760
Get ready.

144
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll come, too.

145
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,120
Tarak!

146
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,440
Dad..

147
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,480
"Oh, Mother!"

148
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,160
"Oh, Mother!"

149
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,520
"Oh, Mother.. I am a fish
trapped in this universe"

150
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,800
"created by you.."

151
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:03,640
"And I am suffering in it."
- What are they doing!

152
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
Are you mad?

153
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,880
Let us pray in peace.

154
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,080
Are you out of your mind?

155
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,600
Hey, shut up. - Are you mad?
- Shut your mouth!

156
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
This is how I pray.

157
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I will sing. What is your problem?
Tell me!

158
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,960
You can't do this. - No, come on..
- Get lost if you have a problem.

159
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,000
She's not listening to us.
- Go.. - Sorry.. Excuse me. Sorry.

160
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Can you leave her alone?
Please.. - All right.. Let's go.

161
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,920
Carry on. - Okay, let's go.
- Thank you.

162
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,560
Cool, dude!
You are the only gentleman here.

163
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,000
Can we speak as we walk?
- Oh, even you speak Kannada!

164
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Cool, man.
- Well..

165
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,680
Is no one accompanying you?

166
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,520
Why?

167
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Just like that.
Guys.. You shouldn't come

168
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
alone like this,
without anyone's help.

169
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,800
Why? We are not kids.

170
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,760
By the way, why are you here?
- My parents are buried here.

171
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,240
So I keep coming here every day
to see them.

172
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
Wow! That's cool!

173
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,280
But I have never seen you here.

174
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,360
I guess you're from Karnataka
as you're speaking in Kannada.

175
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,080
Which place are you from?
- Mysore. Heritage city.

176
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
What's your name?
- Tarak.

177
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,920
Are you married?
- No.. - Wait!

178
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,960
My mom would always tell me
to go to her if I wanted anything.

179
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,720
So I came here and found you.
Problem solved.

180
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,160
It seems, a man who loves
his mother a lot

181
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,240
will also love his wife equally.
- Did you mother tell you this?

182
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes. Thank you so much, Mom!

183
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,240
Thank you.. I love you!

184
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,280
Yes.. Hey! What are you doing?
- Actually.. - Oh!

185
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,240
You want money, right?
I know it.

186
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,440
People like you will have clothes
to wear but no food to eat.

187
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,480
Am I right?
- Yes.. Right!

188
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,360
Hello? Is it mental care?
- Hey..

189
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
Whom are you calling?
- I think you need medical help.

190
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,680
Shut up!
What do you think of me?

191
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,680
Are you judging my character
based on my looks?

192
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,320
My mother likes singing.
That's why I was singing.

193
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,200
Today is Flower's Day.
Hence, I'm wearing flowers.

194
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,640
To hell with you and your attire.
There's something wrong.

195
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,920
I was born and brought up here,
but I'm a true Indian.

196
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,880
There will be something Indian
in my western get-up too.

197
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,560
I just love India!

198
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
Anyway, handsome..
Come, let's take a selfie.

199
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,640
What nonsense!
- I've met you in a cemetery.

200
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,200
So I will surely haunt you
like a ghost.

201
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,560
There's no way I can
let go of this hand.

202
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,560
This is too much!

203
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,080
Yes, coming.. Hold on!

204
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,280
Hey! Who are you?
Hey.. What do you want?

205
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,880
Hey.. Stop!

206
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,120
Hey, I'm asking you something.
Where are you going?

207
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,040
Tarak! Where are you?
- Stop there!

208
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,280
Where are you, Tarak?
- Where is Mr. Tarak?

209
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,200
Forget Tarak.
What do you want?

210
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,200
We're here to light the lamp.
- Where is Tarak?

211
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,560
Tarak, where are you?
Please come soon.

212
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,600
Come soon!

213
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,080
Hi, girls.

214
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,120
Hi, Tarak.
- Hi..

215
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,400
Tarak. - Yes?
- Who are these ghosts?

216
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,960
You wanted a girl
to light the lamp, right?

217
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,480
That's why I've called them here.
You can select anyone you want.

218
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,200
Where is the lamp?
- I'll show you where it is.

219
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,080
They haven't come to light the lamp

220
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,840
they have come
to burn this house down. - Oh, no!

221
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,320
Just have a look at their faces!
- Sarasu..

222
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,720
They look like beggars!
- What are you doing? No..

223
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
How dare you! - Has she gone mad?
- Go..

224
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,320
I'll break your legs if I find
you here again. - Sarasu.. Sarasu!

225
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,320
Didn't you find anything else
to beat them up with?

226
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,120
I would've used a broom if we were
in India, but this isn't India

227
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,960
so I used a vacuum cleaner.

228
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,040
Wait.

229
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Why are you so irresponsible?
I asked for a daughter-in-law.

230
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,480
Ms. Sarasamma.

231
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,840
I have you and you have me,
and our life is beautiful.

232
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,920
We don't need anybody else.

233
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,120
Will you be like this forever?
Won't you get married?

234
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,520
No. I don't want to get married

235
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,160
and deal with family tensions.
- What!

236
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,880
Please stop dreaming
about my marriage.

237
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,640
Go on. Only God knows
who can bring you into line.

238
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,680
Help me.

239
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Help me..

240
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,080
It's you? - It's you?
- Yes. Please help me.

241
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,800
They won't spare me.
Take me somewhere far. Please!

242
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,920
Please.. - Who are they?
- I don't know.

243
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,040
Some guys are following me.
I think they will kill me. Please.

244
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,080
Come on, let's see who they are.
- What if something goes wrong?

245
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm a motherless child.
Is it okay if I die?

246
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,600
Please..
- Okay..

247
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,440
What did you say your name is?

248
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,080
Tarak. - Tarak from Mysore.
The heritage city!

249
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,160
Hey, have you tasted Dosa
at Mylari Hotel

250
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,240
and Biryani in Hanumanthu Hotel
in Mysore?

251
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,760
Actually, we are from Mysore,
but it's been a few years

252
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
since my family moved to Bengaluru.

253
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,640
Oh, Bengaluru!

254
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,160
In Bengaluru, you get Masala Dosa
at CTR, 'Chaats' in VV Puram

255
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,640
Biryani in Banashankari,
and in Naidu's Hotel.. - Stop it!

256
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,440
It's been 22 years
since I went to India. - What!

257
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,920
It's mandatory for me
to go to India with my dad

258
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,800
once in six months
and eat all of this.

259
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,240
You've wasted your life, Tarak.

260
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,720
Anyway, where are those guys
who were following you?

261
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,280
Do we need to talk
about them now?

262
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,880
Only the two of us are here.

263
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,880
Let's happily go on a long drive.
Okay? - Oh!

264
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,760
Get down. - No way. I'll go only
if you take a selfie with me.

265
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,600
You won't trouble me again
if I take a selfie with you, right?

266
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,480
No. Never!
- Okay, come.

267
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,160
Come.

268
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,200
Hey, come..

269
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,920
Bye.

270
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,480
Tarak.. Hey!

271
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
Hey, Tarak!

272
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,200
Someone from
Excel Sports Management company

273
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,400
is here to meet you.

274
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
Bobby

275
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,040
you know that I don't meet anyone
from sports agencies, right?

276
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
Say sorry and send them back.

277
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,600
Say it yourself this time.
I don't want to disappoint

278
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,520
such a good-looking,
kannada-speaking girl.

279
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,440
Bobby, just a minute.
- Yes. What is it?

280
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,240
Is she dressed up weirdly
and acting a little crazy?

281
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,440
Not at all.
She looks very decent.

282
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,800
Moreover, she's wearing a sari
in this country.

283
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,880
Okay. Go and bring her here.
- Okay.

284
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,040
Hello.

285
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,280
Please come.

286
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,760
Have a seat, please.

287
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,360
Easy.

288
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,360
Do you have a twin sister?
- No. I'm the same girl.

289
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,040
Out. Please get out.

290
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,600
This is an office
and you're the boss.

291
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,600
I haven't come here
to sing or dance.

292
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,440
I have a proposal for you.
- No. I don't like you.

293
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,440
I didn't ask you to marry me.

294
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,000
You are a fantastic sportsman.

295
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,400
My intention
is to make you famous.

296
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,160
You are a successful
businessman too.

297
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,880
It's a very rare combination.

298
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,480
Sorry, I don't like to do ads
or endorsements.

299
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,840
This is Excel Sports Company.
I've joined this company recently.

300
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,800
And this is my first assignment.

301
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,960
We both hail from the same place.
So, won't you help me?

302
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,200
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,240
It's okay. I won't force you.
Thank you.

304
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
Bye, Bobby.

305
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,440
I wish you were a sports person.
- Same here.

306
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,800
So unbelievable.

307
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,520
She never agrees this easily.

308
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,520
Very bad, Tarak!
You hurt a pretty girl. - Just go.

309
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,760
Hey!

310
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,760
Bobby, didn't I tell you?

311
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,600
Bobby!

312
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,120
How dare you?
Won't you listen to me?

313
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,800
I won't spare you!

314
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,920
Hey, ghost. Speak in Kannada.

315
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,360
I won't spare you!

316
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,720
I won't spare you!
I won't.

317
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,840
Hey!

318
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,720
Okay, bye.

319
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,560
"T-Tarak."

320
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,400
"T-Tarak."

321
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,360
"I'll follow you wherever you go."

322
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,440
"I'll crave for you
wherever you go."

323
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,640
"I'll follow you everywhere
until you accept me."

324
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,600
"T-Tarak."

325
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,520
"T-Tarak."

326
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,680
"Hey, lady, I'm going to sing
what you say."

327
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,320
"My beats are going to take you
to another world."

328
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
"Tap your feet,
oh, dance like a bird."

329
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,360
"Swing and sway.
Do cha-cha-cha.."

330
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,320
"I'm here for your consent,
please reciprocate to it."

331
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,560
"Don't reject me
and hurt my feelings."

332
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,920
"You are very stubborn
and I am just like you."

333
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,920
"You are my Lord,
please grant me my wish."

334
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,080
"Isn't it wrong to not give me
what I wish for?"

335
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,680
"T-Tarak."

336
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,840
"T-Tarak."

337
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,440
"Everybody,
it's time to party now."

338
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,160
"Move your body,
come on, show me how."

339
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,200
"Show me how.."

340
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,080
"A woman can mesmerise anyone."

341
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,240
"Don't forget how Sage Vishwamitra
lost his heart to Menaka."

342
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,520
"Please look at me once,
I need your love."

343
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,440
"Look at my youth,
it's craving for your love."

344
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,440
"Why are you so prim?"

345
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,320
"T-Tarak."

346
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,360
"Swing and sway."

347
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,240
"I know everything about you.
- My beats.."

348
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,440
"I'll follow you wherever you go."

349
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,520
"I'll crave for you
wherever you go."

350
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,760
"I'll follow you everywhere
until you accept me."

351
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,960
"T-Tarak."

352
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,920
I'm helping you only because both
of us hail from the same place.

353
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,920
Don't lie.

354
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,760
You did it
because I pestered you to help me.

355
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,000
Get out.

356
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,960
Thank you, Tarak!

357
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,080
And yes, I'm shooting
for a pilot ad tomorrow.

358
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,680
Why don't you come
instead of using a body double?

359
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,240
Smile. Say cheese!

360
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,400
Perfect! Capture it.

361
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,280
The actual shoot will be way better
than this one.

362
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,400
Whatever. - Superb!
- Was it troublesome? - A lot.

363
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,920
Okay, bye.

364
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,480
It was awesome.
- I'll send you the photo.

365
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,920
Hi, Tarak.
- Hi.

366
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,880
Hi!
- Hi!

367
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,720
She has already sent the pictures
of the photo-shoot.

368
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,880
Let me see it.

369
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,720
This is your first photo-shoot,
so we need to watch it

370
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,080
on a big screen.
- Hey. Listen to me.

371
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,040
Let's play it.

372
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,520
What's all this?

373
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,080
'Hi, Tarak.'

374
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,080
'I just asked you for one selfie
and you didn't give it to me.'

375
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,760
'Now look at the number of pictures
I have with you.'

376
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,120
'Come on, guys.'

377
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,200
Disgusting! - Tarak.
- Very cheap mentality!

378
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,680
I made a huge mistake
by helping her out.

379
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
Whom did you help?

380
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,160
Some girl, Ms. Sarasamma.
She said she was from our native.

381
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,040
Don't scold her.
It's very rare to find people

382
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,920
from our native here.
Sometimes, mistakes do happen.

383
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,520
And, not everyone is bad.
There are nice people too.

384
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,880
I see! Where did you meet
such a nice person?

385
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
In the supermarket.
She's a girl who knows Kannada.

386
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,400
She was so beautiful
and well-behaved.

387
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,240
Didn't you feel like
inviting her home?

388
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,840
You guessed it right.
- The tea is ready!

389
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,520
I knew it! I knew that it'd be you.
Ms. Sarasamma, you don't know her.

390
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,720
She's here, right?
I'll get to know her.

391
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Oh, God! - First have some tea.
It's Three Roses.

392
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,760
You fooled me first and now,
you fooled her too. - Tarak.

393
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Keep it down.
I said, keep it down!

394
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,640
Get out. - Hey.. - Don't..
- You don't get it, Ms. Sarasamma.

395
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,960
Why hasn't the lamp been lit yet?

396
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Just look, Tarak.

397
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Is this fine, Mother-in-law?

398
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,320
She's calling me mother-in-law..
- I'm dead now! Hey!

399
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,120
What did you tell her when you
met her at the supermarket?

400
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,440
What did I tell her?

401
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,000
Won't your son get married
just because you aren't married?

402
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,320
That's what he says.
But even I am being adamant.

403
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,600
I've told him that I need
a beautiful daughter-in-law

404
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,640
to light the lamp of our house.

405
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,840
The idea you gave there
has followed us till here.

406
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,320
Leave. - Mother-in- law.
- Shut up, leave. - Mother-in law.

407
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,400
Leave. - Let go of my hand.
- Sorry. Leave.

408
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,880
Hey.. What are you doing?

409
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,080
I love you!

410
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
I love you so much!

411
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,080
Are you insane? It's not
even a week since you saw me.

412
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
What's with this new drama?
- No. I'm telling you the truth.

413
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
It requires only a fraction
of a second to fall in love.

414
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,640
And I have my own reasons too.

415
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,600
Just like you said, you go to visit
your parents every single day.

416
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,280
That shows love and respect.

417
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
And as a sportsperson

418
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,520
I've seen your spirit
of fighting till the end.

419
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,240
That shows commitment.

420
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,040
These qualities are sufficient
for me to fall in love with you.

421
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,160
Excuse me!

422
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,840
I have laid a few boundaries
in my life.

423
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,680
And I'm happy with it.

424
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,360
I have one last request.
- No.

425
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,520
Please, don't say no.

426
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,080
Just date me once, Mr. Tarak Ram.

427
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,160
How do you know this name?
- Both your grandpa's name

428
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,360
and your full name are the same.
It's Tarak Ram. It's really nice.

429
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,200
Won't your fiancee find out about
your family and social background?

430
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,600
Ms. Sarasamma!

431
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,680
Just one date.

432
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,200
It you don't feel anything for me
after that, I won't trouble you.

433
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,520
No. Impossible!
- Why?

434
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,560
Are you afraid that you'll be
enchanted by my beauty?

435
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,400
I'm a man.
- That's the reason I asked you.

436
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
Agree to it if you have the guts.

437
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,640
What's the guarantee that you won't
trouble me after the date?

438
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
I swear on my mother.

439
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,480
What?

440
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,320
This car is very special to me.
This is my mom's car.

441
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,200
Nice car.

442
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,080
Anyway, what do you
want to do in life?

443
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,200
My dad's a rich doctor.
I'm spending all his money

444
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,680
and enjoying life to the fullest.

445
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,680
Where are we going on our date?
- It's my date and my day.

446
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,920
Also, the decision and the
destination are also of my choice.

447
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,480
Do you have any problem?
- No.

448
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,720
Why did you bring me here?
- This is an old age home.

449
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,000
I keep coming here.

450
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,480
One minute.
- Hey.. - Wait.

451
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,840
What is this for?

452
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,760
This is for the special couple
sitting there.

453
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,800
Come with me.

454
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,000
Tarak, come.

455
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
Happy anniversary!

456
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,560
Happy anniversary, guys.
You've been together for 50 years.

457
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,080
We're not in the right state
of mind. - Why aren't you happy?

458
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,440
We can't celebrate.

459
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,200
Dominic is not here.
- Dominic? I'll bring Dominic.

460
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,560
Don't be sad. It's your 50th
wedding anniversary.

461
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,760
No. Don't force us.
- But, I.. - Don't force us.

462
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,040
Please go, Meera.

463
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,280
Today is their
50th wedding anniversary.

464
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,040
How many people
get this opportunity?

465
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,520
None of their children is alive.

466
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,160
They only have a grandson.

467
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,920
And he's into drugs
and drug peddling.

468
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,760
But these people have
nobody other than him.

469
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,720
This is where I saw him
the last time.

470
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,320
'Smoking kills.'

471
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,560
What are you doing here?

472
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,760
I'm looking for this boy.

473
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,400
Sorry, boss, you can't make it.

474
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
I'll make it possible.

475
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,160
Here, trespassers will be
punished or finished.

476
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,600
Hey!

477
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,080
Tarak..

478
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,640
Where's that boy?

479
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,160
Dominic.

480
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,680
Your grandparents are waiting.
Come with me.

481
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,040
No.

482
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,040
You better come with me.
- I'm not coming.

483
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,600
I'm telling you..
- Just leave me alone.

484
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,000
Don't stop me.
Hey, who are you? Go away.

485
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,240
Hey!

486
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,080
Come.. Here's Dominic.

487
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,480
Oh, Dominic, you're here!

488
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,800
Come here.

489
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,480
Come.

490
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,080
Thank you so much.

491
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,200
Thank you, my boy.

492
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,960
Tarak.
- Yes.

493
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,120
How was the date?

494
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,640
You don't have to answer now.

495
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,880
You can think about it
and let me know tomorrow. - Okay.

496
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,000
And one more thing.
- What?

497
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,440
It's not necessary

498
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,920
that only childless couples
should adopt children

499
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,960
even children with no parents

500
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,320
can adopt old people
from such old age homes.

501
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,160
Bye.

502
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,120
Tarak.
- Tell me, Darling Sarasu.

503
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,000
You went out on a date with Meera.
How was it?

504
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,760
I don't know much about her
but I'm already thinking about her.

505
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,680
I will see you later. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

506
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,880
Hi.

507
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,480
Hi, Tarak.
Happy Independence Day.

508
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,120
Happy Independence Day.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

509
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,120
The Indian association was
celebrating the Independence Day.

510
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,880
That's why I'm a bit late.
- Yes.

511
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
'Drinking alcohol
is injurious to health.'

512
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,440
This application is for government
school. It gives free education.

513
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,800
This is for one of the best
private schools.

514
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,440
It costs 7000 euros per year.

515
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,440
This one is for an even better
private school.

516
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,280
It costs 14,000 euros per year.

517
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,640
And, if we have a boy,
he will be interested in sports.

518
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,280
If it's a girl

519
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,600
then obviously, she will be
interested in music like me.

520
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,360
So, which school do you prefer?

521
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,840
Why are you worried
about all these things?

522
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,520
Well, you know that I love you.

523
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,920
Since we are on a second date,
it means that you love me too.

524
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,520
So now, all we need to do is,
get married

525
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,000
and plan
our future together, right?

526
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,520
I have told you this once before.

527
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,240
I don't believe in love. It's hard
to be even friends with you.

528
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,520
But still, I can manage.

529
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,440
But love and marriage..
I'm extremely sorry, Meera.

530
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,240
I've come here
to put an end to all of this.

531
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,040
If you still force me to love you

532
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,920
then it's going to be a waste
of your time and energy.

533
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,600
I am not

534
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,920
that person.

535
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,480
I got it.

536
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,200
There's no place for love
in your life.

537
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,200
Because you don't know its value.

538
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,800
And you don't have the mindset
to understand it either.

539
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,920
Meera!
- Did I tick you off?

540
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,720
The people who hang around with you
won't tell you this.

541
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,240
Because they all have some
limitations or obligations.

542
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,240
This is too much..
- Don't raise your voice.

543
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,240
Your heart is as rough
as the sport that you like.

544
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,080
And your life is black and white
just like your company logo.

545
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,760
There is no room for other colours
in your life.

546
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,840
You know what?
Today is the Independence Day.

547
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,440
The day everyone got their freedom.

548
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,880
But you will never be free of your
self-imposed constraints.

549
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,840
According to me,
you are just an animal.

550
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,560
The only difference is
you wear clothes!

551
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,640
It wasn't me.

552
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,040
It's just that our clothes
are identical.

553
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,680
She was with me in the
Independence Day celebration.

554
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,520
I don't want to lose you, Meera.

555
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Is that all?

556
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,240
I love you, Meera.
I love you.

557
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,120
"Talk to me."

558
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:12,920
"I want to know all about"

559
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,520
"how your heart feels for me."

560
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,680
"Talk to me."

561
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,680
"Just say something to me."

562
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,920
"It's by your skill that you
made me fall in love with you"

563
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,760
"while you stayed far away."

564
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,360
"I can't hide my love
for you anymore."

565
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,280
"How did this happen?"

566
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:21,760
"I can see all your dreams
in your sparkling eyes."

567
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,120
"Talk to me the way"

568
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,360
"flowers speak with gusts of wind."

569
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,800
"Talk to me."

570
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:42,080
"Talk to me, anyhow."

571
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,000
"Just staring won't help."

572
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,080
"Trick me into talking to you."

573
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,360
"Silence is endearing in love."

574
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,600
"Stop listening to your mind now."

575
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:39,920
"Every breath I take whispers
to me something about you."

576
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,840
"Talk to me the way"

577
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,360
"waves converse with
the river banks during sunset."

578
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,960
"Talk to me."

579
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,560
"Talk to me at least now."

580
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:09,600
"I want to know all about"

581
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,320
"how your heart feels for me."

582
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,600
"Talk to me."

583
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:26,040
"Just say something to me."

584
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,280
'The number you are trying
to reach is switched off.'

585
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,920
Sarasu, had Meera called up?
- No, she hadn't.

586
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,960
I have been trying to contact her
but her phone is switched off.

587
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,440
There was a man named Tarak
in our house.

588
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,000
He strongly opposed love
and marriage.

589
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
I haven't seen him for a while now.

590
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,600
Did you see him anywhere?

591
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,040
Come on, now..
- I was joking.

592
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,120
Did you have your breakfast?
- I'll have it outside. - Okay.

593
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,640
'Hi, I'm not here to take the call.
Please leave a message.'

594
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,120
Have you people seen Meera?

595
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,440
Meera?
- Meera has not come today.

596
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,160
Hi, Tarak.

597
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,920
Tarak. Tarak, listen..

598
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,800
Tarak.. Tarak, listen to me, please.

599
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,680
Tarak, listen to me.

600
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,200
All these days,
he was struggling to meet you.

601
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,600
What's wrong with you?

602
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,600
She has no common sense at all!

603
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,360
Doesn't she know that she should
inform me where she is?

604
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,240
That's why I came here.
Here's the wedding card.

605
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,000
Hey, why did you hit her?

606
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,040
Why did you hit me?

607
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,720
After claiming to love me,
if you give me your wedding card

608
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,200
what else will I do?

609
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,960
Did you care to see the names
on the card?

610
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,800
Your name is not on it.

611
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,000
You are always in a hurry.
You are always angry.

612
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,960
Look, I'm in a very confused
state right now.

613
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,920
Please tell me what it's all about.

614
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,240
Okay. I am going to narrate
a short and sweet story.

615
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,520
My dad's name is Dr. Chandra Mohan.

616
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,400
You know my mother, Lakshmi.

617
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,840
They fell in love with each other.
But their castes were different.

618
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,280
They got married.

619
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,480
They lived an exemplary life.

620
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,120
Their love always reminded me
of the Taj Mahal.

621
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,000
My lost my mother to cancer
six months ago.

622
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,920
I was worried how my dad
would lead his life without her.

623
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,160
But my dad visited me
a fortnight ago.

624
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,840
He said he's feeling lonely

625
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,400
and that even I'll leave him
after marrying you.

626
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,120
Hence he mentioned about my mom's
close friend, Sharada.

627
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,400
He highlighted the fact
that she's a widow.

628
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,000
He said that
he has decided to marry her.

629
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,760
That's when I realised the saying,
'Out of sight is out of mind'.

630
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,640
It's easy to forget someone
whom you don't see for a while.

631
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,360
They were married for 25 years.

632
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,520
But he forgot all about her
in a matter of months and moved on.

633
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,920
Memories fade away, don't they?

634
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,720
Meera, not all men
are like your dad.

635
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,960
I don't know anything about that.

636
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,360
I believe in what I see
and what I experience.

637
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,440
Stop it, Meera.

638
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,360
What are you trying to tell me?

639
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,800
I will love you till my death.
I will love you forever.

640
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,840
It's a preposterous statement.

641
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,120
You talked about love, heart
and feelings back then.

642
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,960
You made tall claims.

643
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,400
Yes, I did. But I don't
believe in it anymore.

644
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,080
Love and trust are tricky feelings.

645
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,200
They are like a mirage,
you can't catch hold of them.

646
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,400
So go back to your good old self.
I won't disturb you.

647
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,120
I am getting late. Goodbye.

648
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,640
Do you think it's a game?

649
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,760
Meera,
how do I prove my love to you?

650
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,560
Not necessary. You might forget me
just like my dad forgot my mom.

651
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,600
It's impossible, Meera.
- You can.

652
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,720
Ms. Sarasamma, please talk
some sense into her.

653
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,440
Please.. - I don't like anybody
influencing our decisions.

654
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,280
You very well know
how adamant I can be, don't you?

655
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,760
I don't change my decisions.

656
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,800
All right.

657
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,560
What is it that I can do
to win your trust?

658
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,120
Stay away from me for a few days.

659
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,840
For how many days? 10,
20 or 30 days?

660
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,080
60 days.

661
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,760
Stay away from me for 60 days.

662
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,840
Give me your mobile.

663
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,400
You should get rid of everything
that reminds you of me.

664
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,360
You should not discuss
about me with anybody.

665
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,600
Promise me.
- Why?

666
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,880
Because no sensible girl would
fall for you, in that case.

667
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,240
You deleted your memories
from my phone.

668
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,480
What about my heart?
- That's the challenge.

669
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,800
Even after 60 days, if you are
still in love with me

670
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,200
I will do as you say.

671
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,400
But I know, that will never happen.
- Why won't it?

672
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,600
You are capable of forgetting
anybody, Tarak.

673
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,400
Your grandpa loves you so much.

674
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,600
But you've severed all ties
with him for the last 22 years.

675
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,440
How can you not forget me, the one
whom you met only a month ago?

676
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,720
Very funny.

677
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,160
'You are capable of forgetting
anybody, Tarak.'

678
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,760
'Your grandpa loves you very much.'

679
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,160
'But you've severed all ties
with him for the last 22 years.'

680
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,720
'How can you not forget me, the one
whom you met only a month ago?'

681
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,280
'Very funny.'

682
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,680
Hello.
- Grandpa, it's me.

683
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,240
I know it's you, Tarak.

684
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,920
I'm glad you called up.
I just can't believe it.

685
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,000
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

686
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,840
I'm fine, Grandpa. I-I..

687
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,440
I am coming to Bangalore.

688
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,960
What! You are coming home..

689
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,280
Tarak is coming home.

690
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,200
Thank you, God.

691
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,000
Can we wait for him
on the landing strip?

692
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,360
Very few people in this country
have such a privilege.

693
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,600
Sir, greetings to you.

694
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,360
Ms. Sarasamma, how have you been?

695
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,400
Where is Tarak?
- He's here.

696
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,560
Where is he? - You'll have
to identify your grandson.

697
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,960
He's my blood and I will
identify him for sure.

698
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,760
He's my blood.

699
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,200
Tarak.
- Yes, Grandpa.

700
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,640
How have you been?
- I am good.

701
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,240
Grandpa, wait.

702
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,920
Let's go.

703
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,560
He's my grandson, Tarak.

704
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,000
Just a minute.
Please wait right there.

705
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,640
One's behaviour should
reflect affection

706
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,120
and manners, not disregard.

707
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,960
Similarly, this holy flame reflects
sanctity and a customary welcome.

708
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,000
Euros?
I don't know where to exchange it.

709
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,760
Well, you are coming home
after several years.

710
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,000
Please step inside
with your right foot.

711
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,840
Hey..

712
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,840
Sir, look at that.

713
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,960
We clicked that photo
at the airport, a while ago.

714
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,480
How is it even possible?
- What say?

715
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,960
Sir, that's the power
of technology.

716
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,280
That photo was clicked
when you were eight years old.

717
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,600
Tarak, I was so delighted
upon seeing you

718
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,760
that I forgot to introduce him
to you.

719
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,920
His name is Ravindra.

720
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,400
He's like my son,
he takes care of all my businesses.

721
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,000
He takes care of this house, too.

722
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,760
Welcome, home.
- Hello, sir.

723
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,720
She's my niece.
Your dad was supposed to marry..

724
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,320
Her name is Lakshmi.
Now she's my daughter-in-law.

725
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,120
Greetings. Excuse me, please.

726
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,160
Continuing.. He's Mr. Nagendra.

727
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,840
Mr. Ravindra's brother.

728
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,200
She's Mr. Nagendra's wife.
The queen of the kitchen.

729
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,240
She cooks delicious food.
- Greetings.

730
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,480
With right ingredients even
a monkey can cook delicious meals.

731
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,640
Don't be modest.

732
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,720
It's really hard to cook like you.

733
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,480
His name is Sharath.
He's Mr. Ravindra's son.

734
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,840
She loves him.
She's his wife, Shruthi.

735
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,800
The next generation.
Prateek and Pratiksha.

736
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,880
The loving parents
and their lovely children.

737
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,480
Go greet him.

738
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,120
Hi..
- Hi.

739
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,880
You are very tall.
And it's not easy to look at you.

740
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,840
How about now?

741
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,400
Are we done with the introduction?

742
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,560
An eye can see the whole world

743
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
except its own lids.

744
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,000
What does it mean?
- My introduction?

745
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,200
Oh, sorry, tell me.

746
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,840
My name is Sneha. My dad Ramanna
works at sir's farm.

747
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,920
I am not a blood relative..
- It doesn't matter.

748
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,000
You know, in an emergency, the ties
of blood may not of any help

749
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,120
and we need others' help
to survive.

750
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,000
Don't you think it's important?

751
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,320
Her entire family works for me.

752
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,280
In order to take care of me,
she discontinued her studies.

753
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,280
Great.

754
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,800
She has a nickname.

755
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,520
People call her the proverb lady.

756
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,400
She begins every conversation
with a proverb.

757
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,000
It is her nature.

758
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,600
Tarak, you know what?

759
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,040
This completes our family photo.

760
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,920
There's one person missing though.

761
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,400
Charming eyes.

762
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,640
A mesmerising face.

763
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,960
A huge midriff.

764
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,560
What does that mean?
- Waist. - You're a wasteful man.

765
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,520
Boss, it means waist.
A huge waist.

766
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,640
Will she fall for me?

767
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,320
Of course, she will.
After all it's my idea.

768
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,840
Didn't I pay you Rs. 5000
for the idea?

769
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,520
The plan won't work you if you
don't give your best.

770
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,600
Only hard work yields results.

771
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,560
What if your plan fails?

772
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,520
I'll refund the money.
- No.. - Go.

773
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,680
A huge waist.

774
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,000
"Dear, take your
hands off of my waist."

775
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,920
"What if it breaks?"

776
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,200
Hey, is it a pot to break?

777
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,320
No, that was a song.

778
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,080
Does that mean you like me?

779
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,920
Of course, I like you.
Otherwise I would have slapped you.

780
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,880
Give me your phone number,
I want to be in touch with you.

781
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,360
Eventually, we will end up
in the bedroom, right?

782
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,640
Let's go there right away.

783
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,000
Hey, are you a call girl?

784
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,280
I am your wife.
- Wife?

785
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,320
Who's he then?
- He's our son, Abhishek.

786
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,120
Abhi!
- Mom!

787
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,760
How many minutes of the video
did your father watch today?

788
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,760
Only till the scene he enters
your house as a suitor.

789
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,040
But he didn't see you, Mom.

790
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,160
'He's Tarak Ram's distant relative.
His name is Uttara.'

791
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,440
'But every morning he wakes up with
a million questions in his head.'

792
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,440
'He lost his family
in a car accident.'

793
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,000
'He doesn't remember anything
post that incident.'

794
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,680
'I hope I'm looking good.'

795
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,280
'Damn it. He needs a video
camera all the time.'

796
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,800
'Life isn't complete
without a marriage.'

797
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,800
'That's why he got married.'

798
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,680
'The event was shot
on a video camera.'

799
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,160
'Oh, God, bless me.'

800
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,840
'Who is this woman?'

801
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,080
'Hello, ma'am, who are you?'

802
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,400
'How dare you enter
a bachelor's room and sleep over?'

803
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,200
'I am your wife
and you are not a bachelor.'

804
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,960
'It was our consummation night.'

805
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,160
'And there will be a new member
in our family soon.'

806
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,040
'A new member?'

807
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,560
'Dear, whatever happened
between us can't be recorded.'

808
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,360
'And they have a son.
His name is Abhishek!'

809
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,640
'Where am I?'

810
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,280
'Hey! Who are you? - Dad..
- Why are you sleeping here?'

811
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,360
'Dad, please be quiet
for a minute.'

812
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,720
'Watch the TV.'

813
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,440
'How will that help?'

814
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,920
'Well, he has to be reminded
of his past every morning.'

815
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,920
'And this video reminds him
of everything.'

816
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,160
Oh, my dear son..

817
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,280
You're great to be still
married to him.

818
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,920
Well, let me be frank with you.

819
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,720
A husband with a sharp memory

820
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,120
would quarrel over trivial things
that happened in the past.

821
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,480
But my husband becomes
a clean slate every morning.

822
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,640
I'm the one who writes
on that clean slate.

823
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,520
My father believes whatever I say.

824
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,920
By the way, who's that man?

825
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,000
He's sir's grandson.
- Oh.

826
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,520
But I didn't see him in the video.

827
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,600
He's in it, I'll show it
to you tomorrow.

828
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,800
Tarak.
- Grandpa, I'm good.

829
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,720
Go ahead.

830
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,360
I am tired after such
a long journey. I need to rest.

831
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,840
I think you all will go back
to your respective homes.

832
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,960
Hello, we live here.
This is our home.

833
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,680
You are the guest, not us.
- Good.

834
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,360
This is how a happy family looks.

835
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,920
This is a joint family.
- Sorry, I'm not familiar with it.

836
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,360
How could've you been familiar?

837
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,920
You only said, 'Yes, Grandpa',
'No, Grandpa' over the phone

838
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,840
whenever I called you up.

839
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,280
Not a problem. You will learn
everything about it now.

840
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,960
Good night.
- Good night..

841
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,240
You have taken very good care
of my grandson.

842
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,760
I owe you for a lifetime.

843
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,560
Sir, you have been helping
so many people in your life.

844
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,320
You don't have to thank me.

845
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,080
I had a very different life
in the past.

846
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,000
Now it seems very strange to me.

847
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,240
You entered my life

848
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,240
and changed its course altogether.

849
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,320
I miss you, Meera.

850
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,240
Good morning, sir. Welcome.

851
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,320
Tarak. - Sir, please.
- Thank you.

852
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,720
Greetings, sir. These samples
are ready for production

853
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,160
will you please check them?

854
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,720
There is a shortage of curry leaves
powder in the chutney powder.

855
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,120
Fix it before sending it
to the production. - Okay, sir.

856
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,800
A snack should tantalize
your taste buds.

857
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,640
It should make you feel good.

858
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,080
It's a basic quality.
Sir is an expert at formulating it.

859
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,440
I can't take any credit for it.

860
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,560
I learnt it from my father.

861
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,640
He started this company
100 years ago with a sum of Rs. 180.

862
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,840
My son was not interested
in running the company.

863
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,880
But this team is working towards
growing the business.

864
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,320
We should do our job
with love and utter sincerity.

865
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,920
He taught us to uphold the
customers' trust in us, right, sir?

866
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,760
A teacher can't achieve anything
without good students.

867
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,680
Today is an important
day in my life.

868
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,160
My grandson has returned home.

869
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,160
My blood.

870
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,720
My heir.

871
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,200
Hereafter, he will shoulder
all my responsibilities.

872
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,000
The support which you people
gave me over all these years

873
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,640
I want you all to support him
in a similar manner.

874
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,640
I want to see this company
grow under his leadership.

875
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,720
And then I'll retire.

876
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,760
That means less work for us.

877
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,920
We can pass on our responsibilities
to the younger generation

878
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,240
and start spending more time
with our families.

879
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,800
Ravindra had replaced the void
left by my son.

880
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,400
My grandson will take care
of my business, hereafter.

881
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,160
Tarak..

882
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Tarak!

883
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,560
Why, dear? What happened?

884
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,600
Grandpa, please.

885
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,400
Don't have any expectations from me.

886
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,760
What happened now?
- I'm your heir.

887
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,920
But, Grandpa, saying that I'll run
the company

888
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,720
because I am your heir,
would be a lie.

889
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,400
How can you assume things?

890
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,240
You should ask me about
my opinion, right?

891
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,200
The same mistake happened
when it came to my dad, too.

892
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,840
When we take care of our children
and bring them up, it's their duty

893
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,560
to listen to their parents.
- Parents may want their children

894
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,800
to become something, but their
children may have other dreams.

895
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,560
Grandpa..

896
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,640
I've come here to spend time
with you for two months.

897
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:37,960
And then..

898
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,240
I'll be going back.

899
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,400
But, Tarak..
What do you have there?

900
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,440
I'm here.. My whole family
is here.. Ms. Sarasamma is here..

901
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,000
Our company is here.

902
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,840
Will you leave all of this
and go back?

903
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,080
Yes.

904
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,200
What do you have there?
- Dad, Mom..

905
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,600
Everyone I want and everything
that is important to me, is there.

906
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,360
Are you missing him?

907
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,160
I'm missing him like crazy.

908
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,120
You were the one who fought
with him in the first place, right?

909
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,120
He wouldn't have gone to his grandpa
if I hadn't fought with him.

910
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,080
Crazy girl.

911
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,120
I was so happy that I got back
everything that I'd lost.

912
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,000
But.. - It's not even been
three days since he arrived.

913
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,000
He hasn't got adjusted to this
place, yet.

914
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,080
How will he be able to shoulder
responsibilities so soon?

915
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,200
Sir..
- Yes?

916
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,720
Tarak is your heir.

917
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,560
You don't worry about anything.

918
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,640
It's our responsibility to make sure
he's happy with you hereafter.

919
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,640
One minute.

920
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,800
All of you are old, but you
have no brains at all.

921
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,960
You won't know who are you until
you watch the video in the morning.

922
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,480
Shut up.
- You shut up.

923
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,320
I'll talk to him..

924
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,000
Tell me what it is.

925
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,720
Tarak was born and brought
up in a foreign country.

926
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,880
So he's used to that lifestyle.

927
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,080
So why don't we create
that lifestyle here?

928
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,880
Of course. One bad apple can
spoil the whole bunch.

929
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,080
I'm referring to you.

930
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,720
Thank God, the witch left.

931
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,760
Even if the witch
leaves from the door

932
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,160
she'll come back through
the bathroom window.

933
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,480
Really?
- Yes.

934
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,080
Now tell me, what do I have to do?

935
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,080
Presenting to you Mr. Tarak Ram.

936
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,160
The new model.

937
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,640
Super, Grandpa!

938
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,280
How is it?

939
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,320
What's all this, Grandpa?

940
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,680
All this is just to look your age.

941
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,640
He means to say.. Like the youth!
This is my idea.

942
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,720
Sir, is this really you? - Why?
I'm still 28.

943
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,680
But with 50 years of experience.

944
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,720
Excuse me, sir. Your order, please?

945
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,400
Tarak..

946
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,720
You drink, right?
- Yes, Grandpa, but..

947
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,760
Then have some.. - Grandpa..
- In your presence?

948
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,640
If Ms. Sarasamma gets to know
about this..

949
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,680
She won't beat me up with
a vacuum cleaner, but a broom.

950
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,800
'Good, Ms. Sarasamma. You've
taken good care of him.'

951
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,520
Give all of them a fruit punch.
- F-Fruit punch? For you, ma'am?

952
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,080
Give her 'Ramanavami Panaka'.

953
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,760
I don't want anything.
- Okay.

954
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,880
Did she really order fruit punch?
Let me do something about this.

955
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,280
Just a minute.

956
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,600
Stop.
- Sir..

957
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,360
What are doing, sir?
- You have to add some whiskey

958
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,760
to this fruit punch.
- Hello, do you know what's going

959
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,040
to happen if they find out?
- A person who is used to it

960
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,800
will never figure out.
- No. - Add it. - I can't do it.

961
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,880
Do it, sir. - I can't, sir.
- Really? - Yes.

962
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,880
Who said it can't be done?

963
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,240
Such a corrupt man.

964
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,160
It tastes different, right?
- It tastes good.

965
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,280
The fruits you get abroad
are different from the ones

966
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,560
you get here. That's why
it tastes a little weird. - Oh.

967
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,360
It's good. Sneha,
order another. - Sir..

968
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,000
Super, Grandpa. I'll order it.
- Okay. - Waiter, repeat!

969
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,560
"Come on, my friend."

970
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,320
"Tell me what your brand is."

971
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,800
"Let's drink together
with our gang."

972
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,760
"It relieves all the tension."

973
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,320
"Everyone's nice before
getting high."

974
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,160
"Drink.."

975
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,480
"Take this shot."

976
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,720
"Drink.."

977
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,200
"Take this shot."

978
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,360
"Come on, my friend."

979
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,240
"Tell me what your brand is."

980
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,680
"Let's drink together
with our gang."

981
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,720
"It relieves all the tension."

982
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,080
"Everyone's nice
before getting high."

983
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,000
"Drink.."

984
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,280
"Take this shot."

985
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,320
"Drink!"

986
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,200
"Drink!"

987
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,000
"Sleep!"

988
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,640
"Enjoy!"

989
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,320
"Everybody move it.. Shake it,
rock it and groove it."

990
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,000
"Everybody move it.. Shake it,
rock it and groove it."

991
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,960
"Whenever you're frustrated,
this rum helps you out."

992
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,280
"Nothing in life other than
friendship is fostering."

993
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,520
"We hesitate to drink
in the presence of elders."

994
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,640
"Grandpa, why did you give me
this freedom?"

995
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:55,720
"There's no age limit when it comes
to drinking, everyone is the same."

996
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,400
"The one who helps you when you're
in trouble is a true gentleman."

997
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,760
"Don't bother about the brand when
you're drinking at night."

998
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,840
"Drink.."

999
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,920
"Doesn't matter if you spend
all your money."

1000
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,640
"Take this shot."

1001
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,320
"Why worry about your wife?"

1002
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,400
"Drink.."

1003
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,440
"Doesn't matter if you spend
all your money."

1004
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,120
"Take this shot."

1005
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,240
"Why worry about your wife?"

1006
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,000
"You never can mess with me, baby."

1007
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,320
"We got to wait.."

1008
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,000
"You got to play now."

1009
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,200
"Everybody play it now."

1010
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,440
"That's right!"

1011
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,160
"Say what!"

1012
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,760
"There's no tension of suffering
a heart attack if you drink beer."

1013
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,920
"Brandy is the only medicine
when you catch a cold."

1014
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,320
"Mind your age before drinking."

1015
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,560
"Your life will end if you
drink without any limit."

1016
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,400
"Why bother when even the Lord
has started drinking?"

1017
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,120
"I believe that liquor
is the only truth."

1018
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,520
"Grandpa's youth has returned
this night."

1019
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,560
"Drink.."

1020
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,640
"Take this shot."

1021
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,240
"Drink.."

1022
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,080
"Take this shot."

1023
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,720
"Come on, my friend."

1024
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,640
"Tell me what your brand is."

1025
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,080
"Let's drink together
with our gang."

1026
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,960
"It relieves all the tension."

1027
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,320
"Everyone's nice before
getting high."

1028
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,440
"Drink.."

1029
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,680
"Doesn't matter if you spend
all your money."

1030
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,400
"Take this shot."

1031
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,120
"Why worry about your wife?"

1032
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,960
"Drink.."

1033
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,120
"Doesn't matter if you spend
all your money."

1034
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,680
"Take this shot."

1035
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,040
"Why worry about your wife?"

1036
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,120
Happy!
- Hey..

1037
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,240
Talk softly.

1038
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,280
Madam, the person who beats me
shouldn't find out about this.

1039
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,760
What? - I mean, Ms. Sarasamma
shouldn't find out about this.

1040
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,360
Okay. I'll go sleep now. Goodnight.
- Hey.. My pill?

1041
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,800
Your friend will give you
your pill today. Goodnight.

1042
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,720
I want to be just like you.

1043
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,880
I want to be you friend.

1044
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,680
I want to know everything
about you. - About me?

1045
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:45,800
'People around you will be waiting
to know you and love you.'

1046
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,360
'And you should be willing
to accept their love.'

1047
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,040
Okay, Grandpa.

1048
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,760
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1049
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,440
Friends? - Yes, friends!

1050
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,920
Dad. - Yes?
What's going on there, Dad?

1051
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,160
That coloured water is strengthening
the relationship

1052
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,880
between a man and his grandson.

1053
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,320
Won't it strengthen a father-son
relationship?

1054
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,320
It strengthens all financial, social

1055
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,240
and illicit relationships.

1056
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,160
It's very painful, dear.

1057
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,440
It's like I'm in the
middle of an ocean.

1058
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,320
But there's not a single drop
to drink when I'm thirsty.

1059
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,120
Your dad was the apple of my eyes.

1060
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,120
But he never understood it.

1061
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:54,480
Grandpa, do you want to know me
or curse my dad?

1062
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,080
Okay, forget it.
- Hey..

1063
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,160
What have you studied? - After
completing my engineering studies

1064
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,840
I did a course
in business management.

1065
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,560
Actually.. How do you speak such
fluent Kannada despite being

1066
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,400
born and brought up abroad?

1067
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,720
Grandpa, no matter where I reside

1068
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,120
Kannada will dwell in my soul?
- Wow! Well said..

1069
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,720
Son.. I want some more, dear.

1070
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,320
Dad.. Wait for a while.

1071
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,720
What's your company's name?
- A&A Gaming Solution.

1072
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,600
What does A&A stand for?
- It denotes my parents' names.

1073
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,760
Why?

1074
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,080
Didn't you remember me?

1075
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,080
Grandpa, dad named me Tarak Ram
which is your name as well.

1076
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,480
Yes.

1077
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:52,760
He found a way to
correct his mistake.

1078
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,040
Not again.
- Hey.. No..

1079
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,760
How many employees do
you've in your company?

1080
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,120
There are about 70-75 people.
- Oh, it's a huge one then.

1081
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,240
Yes.

1082
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,240
What about girls?

1083
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,960
Why?

1084
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,080
Do you love anyone?

1085
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,920
So this is the point.
- Hey..

1086
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,240
We both are friends, aren't we?

1087
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,640
'You shouldn't tell anyone
about our love. Promise me.'

1088
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,080
No, Grandpa.

1089
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,080
I don't love anyone.

1090
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,320
Hey.. - You'll get married, right?
- Yes. Definitely, Grandpa.

1091
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,160
What kind of a girl do you like?

1092
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,600
She should be an Indian.
And especially, she should

1093
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,600
be from Karnataka.

1094
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,800
Really?
- Yes.

1095
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,240
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1096
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:49,000
You're telling the truth, right?
- Definitely, Grandpa!

1097
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,920
Grandpa!

1098
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,160
Oh, God! All the rooms have
been locked.

1099
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,760
Now where do I take a piss?

1100
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,000
Let me do it here.

1101
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,200
What a relief!

1102
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,680
I'm so lucky today.

1103
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,240
There was liquor in the pub.
There was liquor at home.

1104
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,160
There's liquor everywhere.
It's raining liquor.

1105
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,480
But it's a little salty.

1106
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,040
Oh, it stopped raining.

1107
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,080
He is the Lord we worship.

1108
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,240
Lord Ranganathaswamy.

1109
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,640
This temple was built
in the 12th century.

1110
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,640
Your dad's naming ceremony
took place here.

1111
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,280
My desire to bring you here
has been fulfilled today.

1112
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,200
Hey. I found him..
- Who?

1113
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,600
Do you remember grandpa's
brother who was lost in the fair

1114
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,880
when he was a kid?
- Yes.

1115
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,240
He's sitting and cleaning sandals.
- Oh, God!

1116
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,720
Just a minute. Come with me..
- He's sitting right there.

1117
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,760
Ms. Sarasamma. - Yes?
- What is grandpa doing?

1118
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,800
He is fulfilling the vow
he had taken up for your sake.

1119
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,960
After your parents passed away..

1120
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:31,240
He used to call me several times
a day to enquire about your health.

1121
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,760
He's a great man.

1122
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,520
After my graduation,
grandpa called me over to talk

1123
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,480
about my higher studies.

1124
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,760
Back then, his health was
in a very bad condition.

1125
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,840
When he was talking to me

1126
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,120
he said, 'Please get me
a glass of water, dear'.

1127
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,440
I'm like his granddaughter.

1128
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,280
But still he spoke to me
with so much respect.

1129
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:52,920
That very moment, I decided
to discontinue my studies.

1130
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,640
Make way.. Move aside..
Make way..

1131
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,360
Make way..
- Get aside.

1132
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,680
Hey! Are you blind?

1133
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:42,280
I am not. So what now?
- Hey, he's the MLA of this area.

1134
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,040
He's just an MLA.
He isn't God, right?

1135
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:47,520
I am God. I'm considered as God
by 2.5 lakh people.

1136
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,200
That's why they call me
their leader.

1137
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,120
So what?
- Hey! What did you say?

1138
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,120
Hey.. It's okay..
You please go..

1139
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,960
Sir..
- Hey, Priest..

1140
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,720
Attend to us first.
Serve them later.

1141
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,680
I'm observing this every month.

1142
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,320
Are you prioritizing them just
because they've come from the city?

1143
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,960
You know who I am, don't you?

1144
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,200
Priest. - Yes, sir?
- Please attend to them first.

1145
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,200
This is what happens when goons
become MLAs. - Sneha..

1146
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,480
Here..

1147
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:53,360
Tarak, although there are five sense
organs, the one that signifies life

1148
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,440
is breath.

1149
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,480
You are your grandfather's life.

1150
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,480
We'll take your leave.
- God bless you.

1151
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,440
Sneha. - Yes?
- Where's Tarak?

1152
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,560
I think he's immersed
in God's devotion.

1153
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:08,960
That's why he hasn't come yet.

1154
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,320
Oh, God!

1155
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,520
I've never asked You for anything
until now.

1156
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,160
But my grandpa is doing
so much for my sake.

1157
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,400
Just keep him safe and happy.

1158
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,160
This is all I ask for.

1159
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,960
Hey, what did you say back then?

1160
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,880
You said we are goons, right?

1161
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,000
Seena, get her.

1162
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,760
Let me see who stops us.

1163
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,960
"Hit them.."

1164
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,720
"Hit them hard.."

1165
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,960
"Hit them.."

1166
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
"Hit them hard.."

1167
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,480
Don't go.

1168
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,640
"Hit them.."

1169
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,800
"Hit them hard.."

1170
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,520
"Hit them.."

1171
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,760
"Hit them hard.."

1172
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,680
"Hit them.."

1173
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,320
"Hit them hard.."

1174
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,560
"Hit them.."

1175
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,440
"Hit them hard.."

1176
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,680
Grandpa..

1177
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,880
Brother-in-law..
- Sir! - Hey..

1178
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,680
Hey.. Hey..

1179
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:43,440
Who tried to kill grandpa who is
already so old and about to die?

1180
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,240
Hello?

1181
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:49,880
Why did you let them go without
interrogating them properly?

1182
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,520
I'll talk to the DCP.
- Let go of it.

1183
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,240
Why do you all worry so much?
Nothing has happened to me.

1184
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,960
Sir, keep quiet.
You won't understand this.

1185
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,720
Come on. Let him take rest. Come.

1186
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,120
Greetings, sir..

1187
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,560
Sir..

1188
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,000
Sir, I checked it. I feel that
the Rasam powder is a little salty.

1189
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:21,840
Yes. You are right. Check it before
sending it for production.

1190
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,800
Okay, sir.

1191
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,760
Why do you fight so fiercely?

1192
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,880
Sir.. - Yes? - This is the unknown
side of his character.

1193
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,560
Hey, stop it now.

1194
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,720
Okay..

1195
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,360
And, Tarak..

1196
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:41,880
Did you see the way Ravindra
snubbed the cops?

1197
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,320
He can't tolerate it if
any harm comes to me.

1198
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:49,240
Even my own son wouldn't
have taken such good care of me.

1199
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,120
Tarak..

1200
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,800
Do you know? Sir,
let's tell him your secret.

1201
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:00,280
Grandpa brings new clothes for you
on your birthday every year.

1202
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,960
Have a look.

1203
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,360
What's this, Grandpa?

1204
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,200
I had expected a baby girl.

1205
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,600
Look at this.

1206
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,400
And this one's for this year.
Try it on.

1207
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,200
What's this, Grandpa?
It's so huge.

1208
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,640
I thought Ms. Sarasamma would've
fed you well, so I expected you

1209
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,680
to be chubby as you're the only
person she needs to take care of.

1210
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,880
In that case..

1211
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,840
How did you recognize me
at the airport?

1212
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,120
The outer appearance doesn't matter.
It's the bond that matters.

1213
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,880
My son didn't fulfil my dreams..

1214
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,520
At least you shoulder this
responsibility. - Stop it, Grandpa.

1215
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,880
Sometimes you say, strangers who
donate you blood and save your life

1216
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,080
are more important
than the ties of blood.

1217
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,520
But when you need someone
to be your heir

1218
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,880
you say you need somebody
who is family.

1219
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,000
That's not the case, dear.
- Look, Grandpa.

1220
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,880
Our country will also
be a better place if we

1221
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,760
change this idea of inheritance.

1222
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,440
As soon as she found the fault
in the Rasam powder

1223
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,120
just like you do,
I took a decision.

1224
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,640
Sneha is the right person to be
the next MD of your company.

1225
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:41,920
Not me.

1226
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,160
Congratulation, Ms. Sneha!

1227
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,320
And all the best!

1228
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,520
You take rest, Grandpa.
I'll see you later.

1229
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,960
Sir, you don't worry.

1230
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,960
I'll convince Tarak. Okay.

1231
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,160
What do you think
about my grandson?

1232
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,640
What will I think?

1233
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,640
He is a daring fighter.

1234
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,000
He's so smart and dynamic.

1235
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,040
He respects elders.

1236
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,800
Collectively, he's a complete man.

1237
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:14,240
We should get him married
to a nice girl.

1238
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:18,280
That's not a problem, sir.
Many girls

1239
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,320
will line up to marry him.
Any girl will agree to marry him.

1240
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,160
And what about you?
- What?

1241
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,000
What about you?
- Stop it, sir.

1242
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,480
I've been observing him
ever since he's here.

1243
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,080
He opens up and talks candidly
only with you.

1244
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,880
He mingles a lot only with you.

1245
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:46,080
In order to avoid all that happened
during his father wedding

1246
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,800
I asked him for his opinion.

1247
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,440
He said he doesn't like any girl

1248
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:55,120
and moreover, he expressed his
desire to marry a Kannadiga girl.

1249
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,760
And there is no better
girl than you, right?

1250
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,720
Stop it, sir.
- I'm asking you.

1251
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,680
Won't you answer my question?

1252
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,960
Sir..

1253
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,920
Why would I not be overwhelmed

1254
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,560
when you are giving me
something more

1255
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,560
than what I actually deserve?

1256
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,760
One second.

1257
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:37,240
You handle the situation really
well before it gets out of hand.

1258
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,920
Every family will have its share of
problems and tension.

1259
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,080
We need to manage everything
and move on.

1260
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,000
By the way, all this
happens in our country.

1261
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,760
My happiness lies in
everybody's happiness.

1262
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,760
One second.

1263
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,560
"I'll fall head over heels
in love with you"

1264
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,760
"if I keep gazing at you."

1265
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,880
"You mesmerise me"

1266
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,600
"with your cool swag"

1267
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,800
"and your disarming charm."

1268
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:39,560
"I swear on everybody,
I love you!"

1269
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,280
"I want no riches or jewels."

1270
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,520
"I don't need anybody."

1271
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,960
"I only want you."

1272
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,840
"My beloved! My darling!"

1273
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,480
"Oh, my sweetheart!"

1274
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,320
"I'll wait for you"

1275
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,600
"until you give me a kiss."

1276
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,160
"I'm drawn towards you"

1277
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,640
"all the time."

1278
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:08,960
"I'll fall head over heels
in love with you"

1279
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:14,280
"if I keep gazing at you."

1280
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:06,920
"You're the one in my heart."

1281
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,800
"You are the queen
who rules over me."

1282
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:16,040
"From dawn till dusk"

1283
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,800
"I only dream about you."

1284
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,560
"You are my life."

1285
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,600
"I like you!"

1286
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:24,880
"I love you!"

1287
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,480
"I will fulfil any vows
to gain your love."

1288
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:32,840
"I'll fall head over heels
in love with you"

1289
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:38,920
"if I keep gazing at you."

1290
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,720
Who's this boy? Why is he sitting
in front of our house and crying?

1291
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,120
Hey, who are you, dear?
Why are you crying?

1292
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,960
What is all this?

1293
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,600
I scored less marks in my
midterm exam. - Oh, sad.

1294
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:18,400
My dad didn't sign this
report card.

1295
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,600
That's so sad.
- That's why my teacher hit me.

1296
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,880
What?
- What!

1297
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,560
Did they hit the students?
This is a hideous crime.

1298
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,160
Come on, let's go to your school.
- Sir!

1299
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,360
Come in.

1300
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,680
It's good that you dropped in.
Please have a seat.

1301
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,280
Am I your student
to sit in front of you

1302
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,200
or am I your husband
to sit next to you? - What?

1303
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,080
Or I am you child
to sit on your lap?

1304
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:39,280
Talk with some respect, mister.

1305
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,560
Whom should I respect?

1306
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,000
It's a crime even if parents
themselves beat their children.

1307
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:48,440
But you're harassing
and torturing them mentally.

1308
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:49,960
Sir..

1309
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,560
Please get me one coffee, sir.
- Okay. - Get me one boost.

1310
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:55,440
Okay.. - Hey, where are you going?
Just stand here quietly.

1311
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,240
Look, I'm not taking any action
as you are my student's dad.

1312
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:02,120
To whom am I a dad?
To you or to him? - What?

1313
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,280
God knows to whom his
mom is married to.

1314
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,480
You all are torturing
this innocent kid.

1315
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,480
Now, face my wrath!
- Oh, God!

1316
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,640
We didn't raise our hand
on the student.

1317
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,720
You may ask him.

1318
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,120
Till where did you show
the video to your dad?

1319
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,840
To get the report card signed..
- Tell me.

1320
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,680
I showed him the video
till the wedding.. - Yes.

1321
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,840
And stopped the video.
Oh, God!

1322
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,320
Please forgive us.

1323
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,000
Thank God.
He didn't beat up the principal.

1324
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,840
Don't judge by looking
at my front appearance, sir.

1325
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,560
One minute.

1326
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,160
What did I tell you to do
and what are you doing?

1327
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,160
I don't feel this is right.

1328
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,040
Brother, will you please be quiet?

1329
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,560
We've been serving that old man
for the past 20 years.

1330
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:01,520
And now that somebody else is here,
he wants him to be his successor.

1331
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,280
What if Tarak changes his mind?

1332
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,320
The candy crush game

1333
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:10,760
is so addictive.

1334
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,960
You were so boastful
of your experience.

1335
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,240
You couldn't complete
the task given.

1336
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:24,240
Bow your head down
and tone down your voice.

1337
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,280
If not, you'll be taken to task.

1338
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,240
He's the sharpshooter who
has come here from Mumbai.

1339
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,800
Our plan got spoilt because
of the local MLA's nuisance.

1340
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:40,000
I've accepted the deal
and I will complete the work.

1341
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:44,200
But if you play around with me
like you do with that old man

1342
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,640
then I'll kill you all. Be careful!
- I'll do that job.

1343
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,000
He said he won't
let me in at all.

1344
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,720
Hey, who are you?

1345
01:42:59,000 --> 01:42:59,880
Tarak Ram.

1346
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,120
With love,
everyone address me as Tarak.

1347
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:09,000
I suspected you when there was
a firing at the temple that day.

1348
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:13,320
You pretend to be family
in front of grandpa.

1349
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,960
Where did you get this idea from?

1350
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,720
Did you get it by self

1351
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,400
or did these shameless person
influence you? - What!

1352
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,240
Our work will be done

1353
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,560
if either the grandpa
or the grandson die, right?

1354
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:29,560
Yes. We are shameless people.
So what?

1355
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,120
Hey! What are you doing?

1356
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,440
I'm still talking and you already
started beating him up.

1357
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,120
No discussions. Only actions!

1358
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,400
"Tarak.."

1359
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,520
"Tarak.."

1360
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,600
"Tarak.."

1361
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,200
"Tarak.."

1362
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,200
Hey, stop him.

1363
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,920
My dad always told me..

1364
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:40,240
A person's hunger
can be easily satisfied

1365
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,600
but not his greed for money,
property and power.

1366
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,320
I always believed that one can
survive without education and money

1367
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,520
and not without trust.

1368
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,640
And you broke my trust.

1369
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,640
Today, the value of this company
and all the property

1370
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,720
is Rs. 392 crores.

1371
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,720
This house is worth Rs. 12 crores.

1372
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,280
Office is worth Rs. 12 crores.

1373
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,960
The approximate worth
of the factory is Rs. 126 crores.

1374
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:23,320
The value of products
and the godown is Rs. 28 crore.

1375
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:26,400
The money that is supposed to come
from the market is Rs. 45.5 crore.

1376
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,760
The property I've made
in all of your names

1377
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,800
is worth Rs. 153 crore.

1378
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:37,160
The jewels are worth
Rs. 9.56 crore.

1379
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,800
And the vehicles we have
are worth Rs. 6.82 crore.

1380
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,000
All the details are in this file.

1381
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,480
Take it.

1382
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:57,840
Please forgive me, Mr. Tarak.

1383
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:01,520
I got influenced by him

1384
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,080
to do this job.

1385
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,040
I'm so sorry.

1386
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,680
You always told us

1387
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,680
that we all worked together
and developed this company.

1388
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,640
That's what we
believed in, Mr. Tarak.

1389
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:20,440
But as soon as your
grandson came home

1390
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,720
you said he would
be your successor.

1391
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,080
That scared us a lot, Mr. Tarak.

1392
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
We did this as we were scared

1393
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,200
that we would be on the streets.
- Shut your mouth!

1394
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:34,720
Please forgive us..
- That's not possible.

1395
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:39,280
Now, I have realised that you
are staying with me for money.

1396
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:41,520
Go..

1397
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,920
Mr. Tarak, please let us..
- Please go away!

1398
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:47,240
Mr. Tarak!

1399
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,640
Please forgive them
for what they have done.

1400
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,600
Mr. Tarak!

1401
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:57,200
I will make sure they don't
repeat this again.

1402
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:58,280
Uncle!

1403
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:02,760
We really had no clue that they
had such bad intensions.

1404
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:08,680
Why are you punishing us
for their mistakes, Uncle?

1405
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,920
I know that it isn't your fault.

1406
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:12,800
But what do I do?

1407
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,720
Your husbands are bad, right?

1408
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,720
You should go
wherever they go.

1409
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:20,160
Go..
- Uncle..

1410
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,720
Mr. Tarak..
- Please go.

1411
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:25,000
There's no place for any of you
in this house. Please go..

1412
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,120
Prathiksha..
- Mr. Tarak..

1413
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,240
Mr. Tarak, where do we go now?

1414
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:50,240
Mr. Tarak,
this is our house, right?

1415
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:03,760
This is your house, dear..

1416
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,280
You don't have to go anywhere.

1417
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,320
Nobody needs to go anywhere.

1418
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:19,800
All of you go to your
respective rooms.

1419
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,200
Just go!

1420
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,280
I would forget everything
and live in peace

1421
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,440
if God had given me the memory
loss disease instead of you.

1422
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,640
Tarak..

1423
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,800
What I did was right, wasn't it?

1424
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,360
I didn't know what to say
when the kids questioned me.

1425
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,520
It hurt me a lot.

1426
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:03,760
They are our family no matter
what mistake they make, right?

1427
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:06,360
What you did was right, Grandpa!

1428
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:12,440
Why didn't you have this
generosity with my parents?

1429
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,240
That's because I had made
a promise to my sister.

1430
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,400
That was your promise, Grandpa!

1431
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,400
When dad fell in love with mom

1432
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:24,400
the first person to whom
he told about that was her.

1433
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,240
I don't know about that.

1434
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,320
What he did was a wrong.

1435
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:36,720
If he changed and forgot the rules,
principles

1436
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:39,960
and ideals of this house,
can I do the same?

1437
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,640
I haven't even changed my
wrist watch in all these years.

1438
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,560
Why?

1439
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:48,600
That day you wore a suit
and took me to a pub

1440
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,200
just to make me stay
and win my heart.

1441
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,920
Do you know one thing, Grandpa?

1442
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,680
You change only if you want to.

1443
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,920
If you weren't adamant on that day

1444
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,200
then I could've stood here
with my parents today.

1445
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,160
So, do you mean that I'm the reason
for your parents death?

1446
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,440
It's definitely you, Grandpa.

1447
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,800
Tarak, what are you saying?

1448
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,400
Don't stop me, Ms. Sarasamma.

1449
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:21,120
Let me express my pain today.

1450
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:23,960
That was an accident.
- Yes, it was.

1451
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,400
But, Grandpa,
who was the reason

1452
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,840
behind them leaving the house
in distress?

1453
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,000
It's your words.

1454
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:37,360
I don't receive your call
on my birthday every year.

1455
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,920
Do you know why?

1456
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,840
That day I'll be performing the
rituals of their death anniversary.

1457
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:48,480
My parents died on the day
of my birthday.

1458
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,160
You are so angry with my dad

1459
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,120
that instead of hanging
his picture on the wall

1460
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,920
you hid it in your wardrobe.
- What!

1461
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,960
And coming to my mother.

1462
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,600
You never accepted her at all.

1463
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,000
Grandpa, you always showed me
this photo and told me

1464
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:11,800
that this is your family.
Perfect!

1465
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,840
This is your family.

1466
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,760
There's no way that dad,
mom or I can stay here.

1467
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:33,600
Sir..

1468
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:38,800
Mr. Tarak!

1469
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:18,080
I need to talk to you.

1470
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:23,200
Since childhood, everyone kept
telling me that he's my husband

1471
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,400
and the same resided
in my mind, too.

1472
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:35,560
I didn't tell your grandpa
about your dad's relationship.

1473
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,360
I thought uncle would
anyhow get me married to him

1474
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:44,080
and everything would be all right.

1475
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:57,280
But things didn't go that way.
That's all happened.

1476
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,080
Mr. Tarak!

1477
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,800
Mr. Tarak isn't saying anything.

1478
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:08,880
Uncle!

1479
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:12,040
Grandpa..

1480
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,760
What happened?
- Grandpa!

1481
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:26,560
Put him on aspirin for now.
- Okay, Doctor!

1482
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,920
You've been giving him
all the medicines, right?

1483
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,480
Yes, Doctor.
- Then..

1484
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,000
Why did this happen?

1485
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:34,640
Doctor, there was some
discussion at home.

1486
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:37,640
Probably because of that..
- It's a massive heart attack.

1487
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,720
We can't perform any
operation at this age.

1488
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,320
He has a maximum
of 10 to 12 days left.

1489
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:54,600
Take him home
and keep him happy.

1490
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:57,880
So, can't we save Mr. Tarak?

1491
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:59,960
As a doctor, I'm being very frank.

1492
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,200
But as a well-wisher

1493
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:04,840
even I feel very sad.

1494
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,040
Take care of him.

1495
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:19,480
You continuously blamed
your grandpa

1496
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,200
for your parents death.?

1497
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:25,520
What did you do now?

1498
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:39,080
Tarak.

1499
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:43,080
Your grandpa wants
to talk to you.

1500
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,840
Tarak..

1501
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,240
Forgive me, dear.

1502
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,680
For your parents death..
- Sorry, Grandpa!

1503
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,680
I said everything out of anger.

1504
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:13,960
I don't know how to fulfil vows
like you do.

1505
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:17,880
What do I have to do
to make you happy?

1506
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:22,280
Did the doctor say that I won't
be alive for long?

1507
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,080
Hey, nothing like that, Grandpa.

1508
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:26,720
Shall I take care
of your business?

1509
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:29,120
Sneha is there for that.

1510
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:30,680
Now tell me what I have to do.

1511
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:34,560
Will you take care of Sneha?

1512
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:42,640
Sneha.. - I've already
spoken to her about it.

1513
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,800
She has also agreed to it.

1514
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:49,120
Even you told me that you
are not in love with anyone.

1515
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:54,360
I couldn't see your dad's wedding.

1516
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,520
At least, your wedding..

1517
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:01,640
I won't force you.

1518
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:07,400
Will you be happy
if I get married to Sneha?

1519
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,840
Listen.. Don't get excited.

1520
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,480
I'm happy, dear.
- Okay.

1521
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:16,960
You relax now.

1522
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,200
I love Meera.

1523
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,240
Meera?
- Yes.

1524
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,240
She was the reason
I came here.

1525
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,320
I revealed you the truth
in spite of promising her.

1526
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,160
Just because grandpa told this

1527
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:20,440
don't dream
about this relationship.

1528
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:26,360
For grandpa's happiness and
satisfaction, I accepted to this.

1529
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:28,760
Now..

1530
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,800
We need to pretend.
That's it, right?

1531
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:37,440
Mr. Tarak is as important to me
as he is to you.

1532
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,280
I am with you in this.

1533
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:42,240
Thank you, Meera..
Sorry! Sneha.

1534
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,520
Thanks a lot!

1535
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:20,560
We are selecting a wedding card
for your wedding.

1536
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,520
You are perfectly all right
due to God's grace.

1537
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:05,840
Your grandpa seems quite happy.
- Thank you, Doctor.

1538
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,920
Didn't you tell me
his days were numbered?

1539
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:13,840
Well, don't you want to see
your grandpa alive?

1540
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:14,720
Doctor, what I meant was..

1541
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:18,280
Listen, he is quite excited about
your engagement and wedding.

1542
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:20,240
That is what is keeping
him alive.

1543
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:23,240
He wants to live, he doesn't
want to die, you know.

1544
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:25,800
I can tell you something
as a doctor though.

1545
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:28,840
Medically, he's gone.

1546
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,680
Looks like something's
on your mind.

1547
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,040
You know what my dad
used to tell me.

1548
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:47,600
It's hard to deal with love
and family.

1549
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,200
Well, looks like you are
in trouble now, aren't you?

1550
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,680
Not exactly.

1551
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Meera taught me all about love.

1552
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:59,280
And after spending
time with you all

1553
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,320
I learnt a great deal about family.

1554
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,880
I'm still coming to terms with it.
But I'm happy.

1555
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,760
Why do you look dull then?

1556
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,240
I thought I could
postpone the wedding.

1557
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:12,840
That's why I got engaged
to you in the first place.

1558
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:17,360
But grandpa is already making
arrangements for the wedding.

1559
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:20,960
My meeting with Meera
is due next week.

1560
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:23,920
I must go.

1561
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:25,840
No problem.

1562
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:29,200
Your grandpa's days are numbered.

1563
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,720
Now, one day at a time.

1564
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:36,280
Grandpa, I need to go to Europe.

1565
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:42,840
Why?

1566
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,520
I need to take care
of my business, you know.

1567
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,920
We have already locked
the wedding date.

1568
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,120
Oh..

1569
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:53,400
Are you scared that he's going
to marry somebody else?

1570
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,960
Mr. Tarak, he doesn't stand a
chance because I'll go with him.

1571
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,960
Are you going with him?

1572
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,360
Of course,
I should be with him, right?

1573
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,320
Okay! You can go.
May God bless you.

1574
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:06,880
Why did you tell him that you're
accompanying me?

1575
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:11,600
Because I wish to meet the Meera
who mesmerised you.

1576
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:13,960
Okay.

1577
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,280
Tarak..

1578
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:44,360
Happy?
- Very happy.

1579
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:04,720
Tarak! - Where is Meera?
- She's upstairs.

1580
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:14,920
It affects your legs first,
and then your hands.

1581
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,800
My head is the only part
that isn't affected.

1582
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,120
Like a doll,
I can just move my head.

1583
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:24,800
And I don't know when my head
will get affected. - Don't worry.

1584
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,120
You will be all right.

1585
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:05,320
Why did you come here?

1586
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:07,960
You shouldn't have come here.

1587
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,840
I wanted you to stay happily
with your grandpa.

1588
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:16,240
I planned it so meticulously.

1589
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,920
But I had no idea

1590
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:23,160
that God had even bigger
plans for me.

1591
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,800
Meera, you should've told me
about your condition.

1592
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:55,840
I would have stayed back with you.

1593
02:07:56,120 --> 02:08:00,720
If I ruined your mental
peace with love

1594
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:05,560
and die later

1595
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:08,760
then you would hate your life.

1596
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,000
That's why I didn't let you
know about my health condition.

1597
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:15,720
To hide

1598
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,000
my ugly face

1599
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,280
I can't move my hands as well.

1600
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:46,760
Motor neuron disease.

1601
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,360
It's a very dangerous disease.

1602
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:52,960
It kills the nervous system
in stages.

1603
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:57,360
Due to this one loses control
over their body parts.

1604
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:01,920
Finally, it affects lungs,
brain, and heart.

1605
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:06,440
If anyone of them is affected,
patient dies.

1606
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:15,440
Why didn't you tell me
about it before?

1607
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,120
You know how adamant
she is, don't you?

1608
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:21,600
Doctor told us she might live
for 60 days at the max.

1609
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:25,400
She insisted on me marrying Sharada
fearing I would become alone.

1610
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:29,120
She tricked you into going
to your grandpa's place.

1611
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:34,960
She wants to see everybody happy.

1612
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,120
I had practically lost
everything in life.

1613
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:41,760
But Meera gave me a status
of my best friend.

1614
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,720
Is it possible to save her?

1615
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Her situation is very critical.

1616
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
We can't save her.

1617
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,200
She might die today
or tomorrow or the day after..

1618
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:58,920
It could be anytime.

1619
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:39,960
She's Sneha.
A good friend of mine.

1620
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,880
Grandpa is very close to her.

1621
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:47,920
She wanted to meet you.
That's why I brought her with me.

1622
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:56,600
You figured out the question
I had in my mind.

1623
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:57,600
That's love.

1624
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:01,760
You taught me how to love,
didn't you?

1625
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:17,880
"A lamp is saying something
to the windstorm."

1626
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:25,560
"It is requesting the windstorm
to protect her."

1627
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:33,960
"You lived your life
by spreading love everywhere."

1628
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:41,520
"You are a magician.
Please talk to me."

1629
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:49,840
"A lamp is saying something
to the windstorm."

1630
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:57,240
"It is requesting the windstorm
to protect her."

1631
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,120
Do you love Tarak?

1632
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:04,680
No, we are just good friends.

1633
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:06,800
Your eyes tells me
that you love him.

1634
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:11,920
If I were to be healthy,
I would have blinded you.

1635
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:16,440
You love singing, right?

1636
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:18,240
Why don't you sing for your mom?

1637
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:19,760
I can't.

1638
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,720
I'm planning to perform live
when I meet her.

1639
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:33,080
"Your face is photogenic.
Your smile is picturesque."

1640
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:41,520
"Your heart is like a flower.
I know you inside out, my dear."

1641
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:49,840
"Though I'm with you,
you don't seem to be here at all."

1642
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:57,800
"Your sweet voice is echoing
everywhere."

1643
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:02,680
"You made all this happen."

1644
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:07,200
"Talk to me."

1645
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:53,320
"I don't have to sleep
because you are my sweet dream."

1646
02:13:53,880 --> 02:14:01,360
"Keeping you alive is my
only goal and dream."

1647
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:09,760
"Let me be a song on your lips."

1648
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:14,080
"Give me all your sorrows."

1649
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:18,000
"Please no more tears."

1650
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:22,760
"You are source of my energy."

1651
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:26,480
Meera, what happened?
Meera..

1652
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:28,400
Tarak. - Meera.
- Hug me.

1653
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:34,680
Hug me tight.

1654
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:40,720
Hug me tight..

1655
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,360
Mom!

1656
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:45,800
Mom.

1657
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:00,560
Meera..

1658
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:54,840
Please stop worrying.

1659
02:15:58,800 --> 02:15:59,760
Sarasamma.
- Yes.

1660
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:02,840
My son left home
in the same way

1661
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:04,960
and he never returned.

1662
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:08,640
I couldn't even see his face
for one last time.

1663
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:12,080
What if something untoward
happens again?

1664
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:13,840
That's why I'm nervous.

1665
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:17,000
Grandpa.

1666
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:19,000
They are home.

1667
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:20,720
Grandpa, pull yourself together.

1668
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:23,040
Didn't you live without me
for so many years?

1669
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:29,280
I am kind of used to living
with you now.

1670
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:32,840
I just can't live without you.

1671
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:34,120
Come on, Grandpa.

1672
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:41,160
Meera.

1673
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:49,680
She was lying all along, Sarasamma.

1674
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:51,600
She was a big liar.

1675
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:57,000
She didn't give us any clue
about her health condition.

1676
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:00,200
She deserted me, Sarasamma.

1677
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:02,320
She abandoned me.

1678
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:08,880
I held her in my arms.
She died in my arms.

1679
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:15,600
I couldn't save her.

1680
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:21,120
And grandpa's condition
is critical, too.

1681
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:23,880
I can't tell him all these thing.

1682
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:29,600
His situation doesn't look good.
He can't stomach it.

1683
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:32,840
But..

1684
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:36,640
I can't afford to lose him.

1685
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:47,480
The wedding day
is just 4 days away.

1686
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:51,280
Sarasamma,
can the wedding be cancelled?

1687
02:17:56,560 --> 02:18:00,320
If the wedding is cancelled,
your grandpa will lose his hopes.

1688
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:04,440
And he might even..
- We are not Gods to save him.

1689
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:09,280
At least let's make him happy.

1690
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,640
We are talking about the wedding
not the engagement.

1691
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:15,360
I don't care about it.
Why are you worried about it?

1692
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:16,360
Sneha.
- Yes.

1693
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:20,480
Do you know that your life
is at stake here?

1694
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,360
Didn't you tell him that you won't
mind dying for him?

1695
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:27,200
I promised my life to him,
not yours.

1696
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:29,760
Dad.
- I know that we owe him a lot.

1697
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:33,080
But it's not wise to sacrifice
your life for that.

1698
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,480
Not everybody gets an opportunity
to payback their debts.

1699
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:37,240
We are the lucky ones, Mom.

1700
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:39,800
I don't approve it.

1701
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,280
You don't have to tie
me a nuptial chain.

1702
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:46,000
Just bring the nuptial chain
around my neck

1703
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,560
my mom will do the rest.

1704
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:55,480
And let's act like we are a couple
as long as he is alive.

1705
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:59,320
I promise I won't trouble
you in any way.

1706
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:03,120
Don't you trust me?
- Sneha, it's not about trust..

1707
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:16,200
Please don't let him know
what happened here.

1708
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:19,600
I beg you to not tell him.

1709
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,280
They have taken a very
bold step.

1710
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:26,280
We will definitely support them.

1711
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:29,320
I am seeking redemption
for my sins.

1712
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:31,720
I will definitely help you.

1713
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:38,160
Don't worry about me.

1714
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:40,960
Nothing happened here as far
as I am concerned.

1715
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:48,040
'We should have memories
of our loved ones who are no more.'

1716
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:53,200
'But it's our duty to make our
loved ones happy who are alive.'

1717
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:57,560
Meera.

1718
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:00,160
Meera.

1719
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,040
Meera.

1720
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:04,280
M..

1721
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:09,560
Dad, what are you doing?

1722
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:12,320
We are playing hide and seek,
aren't we?

1723
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:15,880
Don't scream. It scares me.

1724
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,880
And I can't hide anymore, you know.

1725
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:25,240
This is cheating, right, Mom?
- Of course, it's cheating.

1726
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:28,120
Come here.
- Come.

1727
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:32,360
Dear, he doesn't just miss you.

1728
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:36,120
Your name is something
which he misses a lot.

1729
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:41,000
Thanks.
- Why?

1730
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:44,000
You are a understanding wife
and a good friend.

1731
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:46,120
Friend? That's my name.

1732
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:49,560
Let's go.

1733
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:02,760
It's a video call.
- Is it?

1734
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,080
Say hi.

1735
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,320
Look, everybody's over here.

1736
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:11,800
Hi..

1737
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:13,280
Hi..
- Hi.

1738
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:17,040
Why didn't you call me?

1739
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:19,600
It's hardly been two days
and you're already stressed out.

1740
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,320
I can't help it.
I am senile old man.

1741
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:24,840
I might die any moment.

1742
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:29,520
By the way,
our family doctor

1743
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:31,360
died yesterday.

1744
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:32,560
Oh, so sad.

1745
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:34,720
But he used to constantly
talk about others dying.

1746
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:36,200
That's why I'm frightened.

1747
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:39,280
I have one last wish.

1748
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:44,600
I want to attend Meera's wedding.

1749
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,680
Grandpa, you will for sure.

1750
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:49,120
Take my word for it.

1751
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:50,400
Bye..

1752
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,240
Say 'bye'.
- Bye, Grandpa.
