1
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:04,998
If you jump from there,

2
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:05,731
only your bones will break.

3
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,967
You won't die. Come down slowly.

4
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,140
Hello boss.

5
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:12,007
Jump or come down.

6
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,683
We are getting baked in hot sun.
Don't we've any other work?

7
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:16,381
Hello sir.

8
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,178
Please come down.

9
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,821
I'm here to help you.

10
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:21,354
Police is your friend.

11
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,251
JESUS, save my SOD.

12
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:41,901
<i>When I decided to commit suicide,</i>

13
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,013
<i>...it was 4 last evening.</i>

14
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,440
<i>I was walking on Pondy bazaar road.</i>

15
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,510
<i>Writing a letter to someone before
killing yourself is a ritual.</i>

16
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,820
<i>Writing a letter to someone before
killing yourself is a ritual.</i>

17
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:57,550
<i>But to whom should! write?</i>

18
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,690
<i>Anandhi, you are the only one
whom I know on this earth.</i>

19
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,100
<i>But, I've a problem
in writing to you.</i>

20
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:08,263
<i>I don't know your whereabouts.</i>

21
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,768
<i>Though I may write a letter,
I can't post it to you.</i>

22
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,766
<i>But is it necessary to post any letter?</i>

23
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,736
One needs a name to write a letter.

24
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:19,013
<i>I can't find a better name
than yours Anandhi.</i>

25
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,147
<i>You are divine piece of God.</i>

26
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:24,751
<i>So, I must tell you the reason
why I'm committing suicide.</i>

27
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:30,089
<i>You'll sneer on hearing the reason.
The reason is very simple.</i>

28
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:37,157
How can a Tamil graduate
survive in Tamil Nadu?

29
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,401
This doesn't look like a reason, does it?

30
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,070
Even I felt like that.

31
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:53,411
Not until I met Murugan last month
in Tambaram-Chengelpet local train.

32
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:55,176
Move aside, madam.

33
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:57,615
<i>Gents kerchief, sir.
Kerchief sir.</i>

34
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,288
<i>1 for Rs. 5. 2 for Rs. 10.</i>

35
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,287
<i>- Murugan...
- Kerchief with Star Vijay's photo</i>

36
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:05,117
<i>- Hey kerchief..
- You want kerchief sir?</i>

37
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,352
Coming sir...1 for Rs. 5. 2 for Rs. 10.

38
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,391
You're Murugan, right?

39
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,562
Do you want kerchief sir?

40
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:09,996
You're Murugan, right?

41
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,292
I'm Raja not Murugan.

42
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,471
Buy kerchief if you want.
Don't disturb my work.

43
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,976
Kerchief, sir...madam...

44
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:29,809
Hey Muruga...

45
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,148
You've the scar which you got
while playing a Kabaddi game.

46
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:34,982
You are Murugan, right?

47
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,988
Yes, I am Murugan.
So what?

48
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,994
Then why do you act like a stranger?

49
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,561
We both studied Tamil in college
for 3 years. I don't deny that.

50
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,664
You scored 65%.
I scored 66%.

51
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,833
So what?

52
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,233
What happened?

53
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,700
Back home my parents think that
I'm working as a teacher here.

54
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:53,533
But I am selling hankies here.

55
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:55,267
I'm not like you.

56
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:56,877
Don't remind me the past.

57
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:58,444
- Hey Muruga...
- Leave me.

58
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:03,348
- I don't want to see you.
- Muruga..

59
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:10,154
<i>3 out of my 30 batch mates got
a job under minority quota.</i>

60
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:16,629
<i>And the rest 26 are doing unspecified work
in different places under fictitious names.</i>

61
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,090
<i>I was bit lucky.</i>

62
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,561
<i>I too got a job.</i>

63
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,193
What is honor?

64
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,063
Sit down.

65
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,436
Falling from one's own grace.

66
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,569
What do you mean by that?

67
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,174
It means..Sit down.

68
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,943
What if your father beats you?

69
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,107
What <i>if</i> your headmaster makes you
kneel down in the prayer hall?

70
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:38,981
What if the police kick
your bottom in public?

71
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:41,281
- You'll lose your honor.
- What if we lose honor?

72
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:42,458
Sit down.

73
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,950
Thiruvalluvar says"

74
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:49,495
...that as long as we have hair,
we apply oil & shampoo it.

75
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,633
But when it falls down,
it is waste hair.

76
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,960
We put it in a dust bin.

77
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,202
He is talking bad.

78
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:58,003
Hair isn't a bad word.

79
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,533
It is a chaste Tamil word.

80
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,670
Thiruvalluvar says...
"Die rather than live with disgrace".

81
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:24,361
Honorable souls die when disgraced
rather than live with it.

82
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,771
Thank you sir.

83
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,201
Okay, write this 10 times.

84
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,767
Nair, a tea please.

85
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,699
A cigarette, sister.

86
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,277
What's this new habit?

87
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,443
Give me one.

88
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,952
<i>Sexy siren!</i>

89
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,786
You bastard!

90
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,519
He touched her.

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,524
Stop the jeep-

92
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:54,720
Sir...

93
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,061
Yeah.

94
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,295
Inspector is calling you.

95
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:01,003
Don't put off the cigarette.

96
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,166
Come with it.

97
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:05,868
Come.

98
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,101
Can't you put down the cigarette?

99
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:09,369
He told me not to...

100
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,275
Where was your sense?

101
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,145
Get into the jeep.

102
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:16,476
Why sir?

103
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,345
Aren't you educated?

104
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,680
Don't you know smoke in public
is banned? Get in.

105
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,352
Sorry sir.

106
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,553
Get in.

107
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,721
I'm working as a teacher
in this school.

108
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:28,321
The school is itself running without license.

109
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,362
Do you want me to salute you?
Get in.

110
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,959
Sir...

111
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,995
What are you watching, man?
Drag him into the jeep.

112
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:38,663
- Get in.
- Sir, please listen to me.

113
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,534
Bloody crook!

114
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:43,906
- Sir, I was smoking inside the shop.
- Get in.

115
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:52,652
<i>If police beats you in public,
it means you lose your honor.</i>

116
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:58,018
- Your name...?- Prabhakar.

117
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,751
Your name is itself troublesome.

118
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:00,994
And your address?

119
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,696
No. 33, Pauls Mansion, West Mambalam.

120
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:06,298
Pay Rs. 250.

121
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:08,467
I don't have money sir.

122
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,468
You say you're a teacher.
Don't you have money?

123
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,475
Low paid teacher.

124
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:14,932
Moreover month end.

125
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:18,545
Don't trust the teacher.

126
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,545
My son is studying in class 1.

127
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,578
I pay Rs. 500 for his tuitions.

128
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:26,388
Nowadays, they earn more than us.

129
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,919
Students join only Maths tuitions.

130
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:31,616
Nobody joins Tamil tuitions.

131
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:33,818
Writer, he's a Tamil teacher.

132
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:41,032
Then why did you smoke like
a foreigner on the road.

133
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,603
As a <i>Tamil</i> teacher,
you must have smoked a beedi.

134
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,240
Pay Rs. 250 & leave.

135
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,739
Even I am educated.

136
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,740
I know rules.

137
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,573
I didn't smoke in public place.
Show me the G.0.

138
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,078
If that comes under a public place,

139
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,279
...I will pay the fine.

140
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,984
Though you don't have a penny in pocket,
you talk about rules very well.

141
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:58,983
Stand here.

142
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:00,846
You wanted to see Government Order.

143
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,086
<i>And I will show you.</i>

144
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,589
Wait...

145
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,663
Why are you staring at me?

146
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:20,699
That's how I look.

147
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,469
She was smiling at you, right?
Look down.

148
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,043
What did you say?

149
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,582
Actually...

150
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,341
Look down I say.

151
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,614
Tell me.

152
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,051
In public place...

153
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:35,883
What did you tell the head constable?

154
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,355
- I was smoking inside the tea shop..
- ls the tea shop your home?

155
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:42,997
Or is his wife your concubine?

156
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,598
- Don't talk bad about girls?
- Hey...

157
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:47,569
If we beat you,

158
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,829
you will lodge a complaint
for beating a teacher.

159
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,404
Make him sit with criminals with
only his underwear on.

160
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:56,574
Only then he will reform.

161
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:08,317
<i>Honorable souls die when disgraced
rather than live with it.</i>

162
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,784
<i>I was sitting there as a piece of shit.</i>

163
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,824
<i>How can I live after this humiliation?</i>

164
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,563
<i>So, Thiruvalluvar is also a reason
for me to commit suicide.</i>

165
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,162
<i>That's not all.
There's a lot more.</i>

166
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,861
<i>But everything mean the same.</i>

167
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:26,898
<i>Does a Tamil graduate need
a reason to die in Tamil Nadu?</i>

168
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:33,404
<i>I</i> wrote all the reasons in a letter
to Anandhi...and leaped down.

169
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,319
<i>But I am a fool.</i>

170
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,925
<i>Before jumping down,
I should've checked if there's power.</i>

171
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:48,426
<i>I</i> would've attained salvation.

172
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:52,198
But destiny brought me to
the same police station.

173
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,993
<i>Couldn't you find a better place to die?</i>

174
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,366
<i>Showing tricks from the
roof during peak hour?</i>

175
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,938
<i>Traffic got jammed for
an hour because of you.</i>

176
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,666
- Look at your bloody face.
- Sorry sir.

177
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:02,842
I am really sorry.

178
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:09,349
Sir...sir..

179
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:11,611
Leave me sir.

180
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:18,849
- How was the feast?
- Not much just fourth.

181
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,924
- Take it.
- No sir.

182
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,496
Come on smoke.

183
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:30,397
I was beaten & fined
for smoking in public.

184
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,540
When you smoke outside,
we will file a case against you.

185
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:34,709
But not when you smoke inside.
C'mon smoke.

186
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:38,870
Thank you sir.

187
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:41,273
Not now. I will smoke later.

188
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,016
Inspector is so generous that he
will put you in jail for 5 years.

189
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,780
For the crime of committing suicide,
you can only remand me.

190
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,987
Don't scare me by saying 5 years jail.

191
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:55,220
When you smuggle marijuana
worth half million,

192
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,955
...5 year jail term is too little.

193
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,327
Did I smuggle?
Just a minute.

194
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,343
All that I have is only Rs. 2.
Just a minute.

195
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:14,448
Who will believe you if you say that
I smuggled drugs worth half million?

196
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:15,545
Forget about me.

197
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:20,381
Will you earn salary plus bribe
around Rs. 20000 a month?

198
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,919
Where will you get half a million?

199
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,789
- Making fun of me?
- Sir...

200
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,121
Wait for me. I will come.

201
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,756
Friendly to socialize
and honest in duty.

202
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,798
Greetings sir...you carry on, sir.

203
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:47,081
We can file drug smuggling case for
half million to 5 millions.

204
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,795
We've reached the court.
Come in the evening.

205
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:05,529
<i>Missed it?</i>

206
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:16,706
Get up sir. He has escaped.
Get up sir.

207
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:25,044
- Catch him...
- This is 303.

208
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:26,915
Suicide attempt case has escaped.
Over sir.

209
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,513
<i>If I stay here, police will torture me.</i>

210
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,444
<i>I've a friend named Kanaga
in Tambaram.</i>

211
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,842
<i>He can get me a room boy's job
in some hotel.</i>

212
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:58,852
<i>But I am a big fool.</i>

213
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,948
<i>I didn't know then I could
travel ticket less in trains.</i>

214
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:03,555
<i>To go to Tambaram,
I need to buy a ticket.</i>

215
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,158
<i>To buy ticket, I need Rs. 5.</i>

216
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,622
<i>I remembered that I had Rs. 5
in my shirt pocket.</i>

217
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,124
<i>I was looking for that.</i>

218
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,391
Sir, give me a ticket to Tambaram.

219
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,001
This isn't valid.
Give me another note.

220
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,470
Sir, all 5 rupee notes are
in this condition only.

221
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:19,766
Sir, please give me ticket.

222
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,772
I too know that..

223
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:22,773
But all stick and present it.

224
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,002
Get it sticked & present it.

225
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,873
If I've to stick it I need to
go to Tambaram, sir.

226
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,572
I need to buy a ticket for that.

227
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,479
I've only this five rupee note
to buy a ticket.

228
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:31,981
- Hello.
- Sir, all five rupee notes are torn...

229
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:33,313
Sir, please give me a ticket.

230
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:34,489
Bloody pain in ass!

231
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,617
Want to buy or give me way?

232
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,190
Wait, man...I'm buying ticket.

233
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:58,564
<i>The world turned me into nothing,</i>

234
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,942
<i>but this one drop of blood
turned me into God.</i>

235
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,972
Sir, didn't I tell you that
I don't know anyone?

236
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,977
For the past 2 hours, you are...

237
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:07,910
Move man..

238
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,949
Where is Prabhakar?

239
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,710
- Sir, I know only one Prabhakar.
- I'm asking about him only.

240
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,912
He is in Sri Lanka.
Oh my God!

241
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,486
Sir, I hurt my head twice for him,

242
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:21,128
Doctor warned me that
I'll the third time.

243
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,529
Sir, I got hurt again.

244
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,665
I'll tell you the truth, sir..

245
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:28,428
He beat me and
took away my train ticket, sir.

246
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:32,266
Charminar Express sir,
to Hyderabad, S4 coach.

247
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,413
Who is it at this odd hour?

248
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,085
<i>Generally they say smoking
is injurious to health.</i>

249
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:58,630
But that day I found it's danger
to another person.

250
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,302
Very good man!

251
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,577
Sleep well, dear.

252
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,009
Hello, you shouldn't smoke
inside the train.

253
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,653
Don't you know it?

254
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:21,079
I didn't get you.

255
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:23,587
You speak Telugu or Tamil?

256
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:24,683
Tamil.

257
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:26,390
- Oh! Madras?
- Yes.

258
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,324
You shouldn't smoke inside the train.
Rs 200 fine..

259
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:30,997
I'll leave you, if you pay Rs 100.

260
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:32,229
I don't have money, sir.

261
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,095
What? Don't you have money?

262
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,995
You're traveling in reserved compartment.
Don't you have money?

263
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:40,506
Do you have ticket or not?

264
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,343
- Yes sir.
- Show me.

265
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:43,802
Show me..

266
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,207
Show me your ticket..

267
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,417
Okay.

268
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,450
Give me Rs 100 and
take back your ticket.

269
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:56,714
- Sir, I don't have money.
- Give me Rs 100.

270
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:02,762
- Please sir...
- Hey...bloody f...

271
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,269
For an every action, there is an <i>equal</i>
and opposite reaction.

272
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,803
<i>How can Newton's 3rd law not work?</i>

273
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,333
<i>Driver, stop the vehicle.</i>

274
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,344
<i>Go back..</i>

275
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,748
<i>- Greetings,sir.
- Who is it?</i>

276
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:03,153
Who are you?

277
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,488
Show me your face.

278
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,329
<i>You scoundrel! Don't run away!
Stop! I'll fire at you...</i>

279
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,367
<i>Stop man!</i>

280
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,948
<i>One more night...</i>

281
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:33,011
<i>One more moon...</i>

282
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,122
<i>One more memory...</i>

283
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:42,025
<i>Look, a fear is fast approaching
from the opposite side...</i>

284
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:48,565
<i>A little more distance...</i>

285
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:52,629
<i>A few more burdens...</i>

286
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:55,066
<i>A little more...</i>

287
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:02,140
<i>...fast approaching me
from the opposite side...</i>

288
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,048
<i>No one to visit...</i>

289
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,919
<i>No one to visit me...</i>

290
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:19,623
Travelers cross the road up <i>&</i> down
but the road remains there forever...

291
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:27,774
The pleasant moments we spent together
will never fade away <i>from</i> my eyes...

292
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:50,263
<i>I slept on garbage till
the break of new dawn...</i>

293
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:57,961
<i>I don't remember
when did I last smile...</i>

294
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:05,678
<i>Trees don't shed tears
for withered leaves...</i>

295
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:13,353
<i>It'll not feel the pain
till the root catches fire...</i>

296
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:20,595
<i>Pain tells me that
I'm still alive...</i>

297
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:29,030
<i>I realise I'm not with you only
when I wake from sleep...</i>

298
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,203
<i>Look Anandhi, what I'm having
is marijuana.</i>

299
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:40,847
<i>Don't get angry...
I'm helpless..</i>

300
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,010
It's otherwise known as 'Sivabanam'.

301
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,550
<i>Since I'm Lord Siva,
I have to have it.</i>

302
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:47,653
<i>Do you know why I've become Lord Siva?</i>

303
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:53,055
<i>Because I've the authority of births
and deaths, so I'm Lord Siva.</i>

304
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:58,221
<i>so you're my consort Parvathi
though presently not with me.</i>

305
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,492
<i>So come, we will go and have a dance.</i>

306
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,024
<i>Yesterday in a city...</i>

307
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,921
<i>Inside a glass jar...</i>

308
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,098
<i>I saw a diamond...</i>

309
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,935
<i>I saw a diamond...</i>

310
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:16,209
<i>I</i> remembered her eyes...

311
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,005
<i>I don't have money to buy diamond...</i>

312
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:23,784
<i>Still I'm not worried...</i>

313
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,680
<i>I killed the shop owner...</i>

314
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,991
<i>And stole the diamond...</i>

315
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:39,324
<i>Once while on a travel,
during night time...</i>

316
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:46,497
<i>I saw a golden silk sari...</i>

317
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:54,638
<i>I remembered your slim body...</i>

318
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:58,410
<i>I didn't have money to buy sari...</i>

319
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:02,245
<i>I didn't bother much...</i>

320
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:09,995
<i>I killed the clothier...
Stole the girl...</i>

321
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:17,761
<i>Once you fall in love,
you don't need money...</i>

322
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:26,003
<i>Once you become God,
killing is not a crime...</i>

323
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,634
<i>After that, 2 years passed since
I'm in Madras.</i>

324
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:58,675
<i>There's no street or lane I didn't loiter.</i>

325
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:04,978
<i>In these 2 years, I killed 22 people.</i>

326
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:11,220
<i>- You... 22...murders...
- Hey stop it.</i>

327
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,890
Why are you laughing now?

328
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:17,263
Like slaughtering goats in mutton shop...
Like stuffing passengers in share auto.

329
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,365
Your list of murders
is stretching long.

330
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,535
I make fools of others.

331
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:24,227
You're trying to fool me?
Get lost, man.

332
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,130
I thought you'll pay Rs 10000,

333
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,332
that I can pay for my bike's due.

334
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,510
If the listener is fool,
you'll lie that elephants will fly.

335
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:36,373
Brother, first cut your hair,
then you can hack men.

336
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:37,346
Wait man...

337
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,980
Please hold on, man..

338
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:40,721
What happened now?

339
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,480
Till now didn't I listen to you patiently?

340
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:45,854
Won't you listen me for a while?
Why are you getting tensed?

341
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:48,085
Put it down...
it may go off by mistake.

342
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,325
I've come back...
Put down the gun.

343
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:56,237
You've given a chair
to be a pot in fear.

344
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:57,336
Thank you very much.

345
00:25:58,173 --> 00:25:58,969
Okay.

346
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:06,876
Why are you lighting
a lamp in day time?

347
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,080
Last match stick.

348
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:09,911
<i>I can't go out for another match box.</i>

349
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:11,180
You're right, sir.

350
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:13,750
I'm on diet, sir.

351
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:16,522
Fire is identity of wisdom.

352
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:20,193
Only wise can smoke.

353
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:21,724
He has started!

354
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,622
Have you ever faced death in life?

355
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,559
I'm 30 years old.
How can I not face it?

356
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:27,562
How many?

357
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:28,631
Two, sir.

358
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:30,862
Two? When?

359
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:32,471
2 years ago, sir.

360
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:33,571
Who?

361
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:35,708
My grandpa, sir. Very good Grandpa.

362
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,672
How did he die?

363
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,103
He went to sleep but never got up.

364
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:39,939
Next?

365
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,979
- Last year...
- Who?

366
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,344
My father. Very good father.

367
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:45,280
How?

368
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,955
He went to sleep but never got up.

369
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:52,388
Why are you repeating the same dialogue,
he went to sleep but never got up.

370
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:54,925
Am I asking you about peaceful deaths?

371
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:56,186
Gory death, man!

372
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:57,831
With blood spill and flesh...

373
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:00,863
They cut my mother's throat and
blood gushed out like a fountain...

374
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:01,899
Have you seen it?

375
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:04,566
I saw it.

376
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:08,573
I saw my grandpa's head
breaking into pieces.

377
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,902
I've seen it.

378
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,437
Just hold on...

379
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,655
I witnessed my first death
in the age of 10.

380
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:27,726
I was having this geometric
box with me then.

381
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:29,492
It was with me...

382
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:34,932
<i>It was with me...</i>

383
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:45,475
It had 2 erasers, 2 crayons, <i>3</i> hen
feathers and many more things..

384
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:46,881
<i>Above all,</i>

385
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:51,583
<i>Anandhi, who gave me
all that was with me.</i>

386
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,194
Where are you taking me
into the forest?

387
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:06,163
Wait... you come, I'll tell you.
Come on...

388
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,037
Hey, we have reached very far.
Tell me the matter.

389
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:14,265
I've a friend here.
I want to introduce him to you.

390
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,740
Do you have a friend in this forest?
Who is it?

391
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,912
Mr. Tiger.

392
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:21,206
How can a beast like tiger
be your friend?

393
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,043
- Isn't a cat your friend?
- Yes.

394
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:24,548
Like your cat,
tiger is my friend.

395
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:26,219
Cats are girls' friend,
and tigers are boys' friend.

396
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:28,651
Tiger is nothing but a big cat.

397
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,484
Really saying this?

398
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,786
Come, I'll introduce you to him.

399
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:39,566
<i>If you come across a girl using
the word 'Really' frequently,</i>

400
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,098
<i>It's Anandhi, sir.</i>

401
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,135
<i>She can't hold herself
from uttering this word.</i>

402
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,278
- Where is your friend?
- Wait, I'll go and fetch him.

403
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,281
Mr. Tiger...

404
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,313
Where are you?

405
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:05,255
I'm Prabhakar calling you.

406
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,951
Come fast...

407
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:14,101
I've called him.
He will come now..

408
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,361
It's getting late...
When will he come?

409
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:20,507
- Oh my God! I forgot!
- What did you forget?

410
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,573
Yesterday he told me that
he is going to sleep...

411
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:24,108
So what? Wake him up
and call him here...

412
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:25,802
He will be in his dreams now.

413
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,878
What will he dream about?

414
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:29,845
It's a big dream about a desert.

415
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:32,383
It will take long hours
to come to an end.

416
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:34,452
When it's over, he will come here.

417
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:38,092
- I'll introduce him to you then, okay?
- Really saying this?

418
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,826
Shall we play in the
railway bridge down?

419
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:02,076
<i>I used to walk holding her
hand thinking about her.</i>

420
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:06,847
<i>She used to walk with me holding my hand
thinking about the non existent tiger.</i>

421
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:12,689
<i>That non existent tiger always dreamed
about the non existent desert.</i>

422
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:14,888
That's our relationship.

423
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:18,231
Have you understood anything?

424
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,334
<i>Very good question, man.</i>

425
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:25,265
Looks like I got it..
But not really.

426
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:26,872
- Didn't get it?
- Yes sir.

427
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,600
- Don't mind if you don't get it.
- Why did you ask me then?

428
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:32,878
<i>I can understand it.</i>

429
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,548
- Hey wait..
- What?

430
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:38,575
Lift the lamp...

431
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:46,120
<i>Generally happy moments of our lives
pass away without our knowledge.</i>

432
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,021
<i>But! was fortunate
to observe it that day.</i>

433
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:54,224
<i>I was relishing that
happy moment joyfully.</i>

434
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:05,143
<i>There was a girl who was
tall and thin and fair.</i>

435
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:11,148
Her hair was a color of ginger.

436
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:15,650
<i>There was a girl who was
tall and thin and fair.</i>

437
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:23,821
<i>Her hair was a color of ginger.</i>

438
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:29,533
Tony, come... come...

439
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:43,080
Hey, train is coming...

440
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:45,076
Hey, Tony is going...

441
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:52,950
- Tony, wait...
- Tony, stay... wait...

442
00:31:53,161 --> 00:32:00,090
Hey, train is coming. Move away..

443
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:09,334
Train is coming... move away...

444
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:19,585
Leave me, uncle...

445
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:29,255
<i>In this tunnel I met my first gory death.</i>

446
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,501
<i>MY 409, Tony!</i>

447
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:39,332
You would know if you'd a pet dog.

448
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,470
<i>You would know the impact of it's death,
like losing a child.</i>

449
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:57,251
<i>- My father...
- Come on, dear..</i>

450
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,125
<i>He was an army man.</i>

451
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,728
Nobody knew when he comes
and when he goes away.

452
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:07,193
<i>The only game he knew was
spinning round carrying me.</i>

453
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,332
<i>Without bothering to ask
whether I like it or not,</i>

454
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:11,698
<i>he kept on spinning.</i>

455
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:17,710
<i>To make him happy I never
told him I hated this game.</i>

456
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,742
Aunty, I'm going out
with my father in car.

457
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,284
Can you please send Anandhi with me?

458
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,419
She isn't well, dear.
You please carry on.

459
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:30,921
I'll take care of her, aunty.

460
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:33,056
She is taking rest.
Not feeling well also..

461
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,354
You can take her tomorrow,
you carry on..

462
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:37,622
Okay, auntv-

463
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,872
Hey. keep quiet..

464
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:49,042
- Hey, can't you keep quiet?
- Why are you beating him?

465
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,105
Hey Prabha, don't play...

466
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,777
- I won't buy ball for you...
- Yes, don't buy it..

467
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:59,043
Teeth less grandma, keep quiet...

468
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,483
- You shut up, naughty boy..
- Keep quiet. Don't tease grandma.

469
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,121
Father, stop the car...

470
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,734
I want to piss... stop the car..
- We are above to reach the place...Wait..

471
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:19,338
<i>Father, if you don't stop now,
I'll piss inside the car...Stop it, father...</i>

472
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,776
- Wait..
- Hey, don't run...

473
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,001
You sit. I'll take care.

474
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,340
- Make it fast..
- I'm trying, don't disturb me.

475
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,901
Mother... mother...

476
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:57,336
Grandpa...

477
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,945
Father, look at the grandpa...

478
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:04,512
Mother...

479
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:12,326
Mother... mother..

480
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,623
A part of my mother's flesh...is here.

481
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,498
Even now, I can smell it.

482
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,504
I still smell...

483
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,569
<i>Usually parents send their children
to school on the opening day.</i>

484
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:05,371
But my father took me to the school
on the last working day.

485
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:09,014
<i>Because he had to
return to his duty.</i>

486
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:10,313
<i>You don't worry.</i>

487
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,422
I'm Kanagasabapathy.

488
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:21,025
I'm Prabhakar.

489
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,609
Oh my God!

490
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:59,498
Sorry Prabha...no, Prabha...
leave me...

491
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,328
Hey, leave him...

492
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:08,636
Wait...hey, why are you beating him?

493
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:09,938
My ball, sir.

494
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:12,536
Will you beat him for a ball?

495
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,782
Hey, calm down...

496
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:17,751
Stop crying... didn't I tell you?

497
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:19,149
Why are you staring at me?

498
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,378
If I give you a slap...

499
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,127
<i>He beat me...</i>

500
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:31,059
Hey get Up, dear...

501
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:32,764
Are you sleeping?

502
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,327
Look what is in my hand...

503
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,697
Hey, are you pretending like sleeping?

504
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,506
You beat him for this ball?

505
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:44,769
Sleep..

506
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,810
With great difficulty I mended your football.

507
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,744
But you're taking it coolly.

508
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:51,349
You're very stubborn!

509
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,466
- Sir...
- What?

510
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:12,903
Ball sir..

511
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:14,036
Yes I know..

512
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:15,473
Thanks sir.

513
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:17,107
No mention.

514
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:27,081
Hey, what are you doing there?

515
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:29,187
Rm Playing, sir.

516
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,482
How come you play alone?

517
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:31,953
You chased away your
one and only friend also.

518
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:34,753
- Come on, let's play..
- Sir, how can I play with you?

519
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:35,519
Why?

520
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,662
Because you're a Tamil teacher.

521
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:38,764
So what? Can't I play?

522
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,661
This is English game.
You don't know.

523
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:42,768
What great English?
Come on tell me...

524
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,996
There was a girl
who was tall, thin and fair.

525
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:49,973
Her hair... her hair was
the color of ginger.

526
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:51,641
<i>Am I right?</i>

527
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,681
Stupid English!
Come here, boy..

528
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:57,880
Come here, boy...

529
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,688
<i>Oh ﬂying butterﬂy...</i>

530
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:08,691
<i>When I touched,
it gave me many colours...</i>

531
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,763
<i>This is a new game of hide and seek...</i>

532
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:14,261
<i>That changed the mindset...</i>

533
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:20,373
<i>Heart is craving for a consoling
hand to wipe the tears...</i>

534
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:26,740
<i>A leaf ﬂoating on water has
become a lifeboat to the ant...</i>

535
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,711
<i>Oh ﬂying butterﬂy...</i>

536
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,680
<i>When I touched,
it gave me many colours...</i>

537
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,786
<i>This is a new game of hide and seek...</i>

538
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:38,583
<i>That changed the mindset...</i>

539
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:08,585
Happiness and sorrows
are two <i>sides</i> of a life...

540
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:14,625
Heart says with love no one
is alone in this world...

541
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:20,198
<i>A feeling like chillness of
a shadow in hot sun...</i>

542
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:26,533
<i>A</i> mind is getting chiseled into a statue
with the lashing of sea waves...

543
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:35,148
<i>The golden days of the childhood
is making a come back...</i>

544
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:46,653
Hey, what are you doing there?

545
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:50,662
Who is she?
Is she your daughter?

546
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:53,124
Yes.. go and sleep..

547
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:54,931
Okay sir.

548
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,539
To Gayathri of 7th std D section..

549
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:03,537
Dear, how are you?

550
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,072
Here, I've got a naughty student.

551
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:07,907
He is just like me.

552
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:09,281
Mischievous boy.

553
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:14,149
- Mother... mother..
- Hey, what happened?

554
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:19,481
- What happened, dear?
- Mother... mother...

555
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:20,421
It's nothing..

556
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:24,661
It's nothing...

557
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,935
<i>May Lord Muruga bless you...</i>

558
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,567
<i>May all your fears vanish...</i>

559
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:36,004
<i>The man who relieved all the pain and
sorrow from my life is my Tamil teacher.</i>

560
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:38,707
<i>I was waiting for the summer vacation.</i>

561
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,576
<i>Because in summer vacation,
the school will be empty.</i>

562
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,952
<i>My Tamil teacher spent all his time
for me and with me only.</i>

563
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:51,290
<i>I</i> never ever wished to spend
my vacation with my father.

564
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:54,256
<i>To be frank, I had even
forgotten my father.</i>

565
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:59,793
<i>Oh ﬂying butterﬂy...</i>

566
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:02,967
<i>When I touched,
it gave me many colours...</i>

567
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,934
<i>This is a new game of hide and seek...</i>

568
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,800
<i>That changed the mindset...</i>

569
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:14,040
Hey, wait...

570
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,313
Nothing, sir..

571
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:31,353
Hey, what?
Leaving so soon?

572
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:32,754
Leaving by evening train.

573
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,465
All the best, friend.

574
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:36,829
- When are you leaving?
- Okay.

575
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:49,446
- Tamil teacher...
- What?

576
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,247
I'll stay here for this vacation also.

577
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:53,818
I've to apply for college also.

578
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:55,784
Hey, stop telling lies..

579
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,756
I know where to get you admitted.

580
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:00,021
Your father is longing
to meet for 6 years.

581
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:01,091
Go and meet him.

582
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:03,285
Didn't he carry you all these days?

583
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,964
Now you go and carry him.

584
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:14,467
- Where are we going?
- I'll tell you, come.

585
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:18,940
An old student Shankarlingam
of mine is getting married.

586
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:19,779
Love marriage.

587
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,607
He called me sign as witness.
I'm going there.

588
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,212
I may come late, dear.

589
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,116
- Your father is in Calcutta, right?
- Yes.

590
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,549
- As soon as you reach,
ask your dad to phone me.- Okay..

591
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:30,952
I'll discuss with him about
your further studies. Got it?

592
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,102
The bus in which our warden was
traveling fell into the river.

593
00:43:58,285 --> 00:44:00,082
- What?
- Sir...my Tamil teacher...

594
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:01,254
60 dead bodies are lying inside.

595
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:02,854
It'll take 2 days for postmortem
and other formalities.

596
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,117
Has come to claim body?
Get lost, man!

597
00:44:09,763 --> 00:44:13,927
From morning they are torturing me.

598
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:31,009
Anandhi's mother...

599
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:35,483
Anandhi..

600
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:40,420
Prabha...

601
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:43,524
<i>Who are you?</i>

602
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:46,126
I was your neighbour.

603
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:56,707
<i>I</i> always relate to my mother's tragic death
to make them remember me.

604
00:44:58,312 --> 00:45:01,008
<i>Death has been
my visiting card till date.</i>

605
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,583
How come you are here?

606
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,183
Her father died in bus accident.

607
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:18,926
You can go inside and see him, can't you?

608
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,432
They are not allowing us.

609
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,160
Who? That watchman?

610
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:37,079
First wife's relatives.

611
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:41,646
A prostitute has come to fight
for her rights on this man.

612
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:45,120
Shameless woman has come
with her daughter in tow!

613
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:51,030
<i>Don't know how many families
she had ruined.</i>

614
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:56,330
I didn't see my father.

615
00:45:58,138 --> 00:45:59,969
I couldn't see my father, Prabha.

616
00:46:00,874 --> 00:46:02,364
Please take me over there.

617
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,702
- They may abuse you.
- Shut up, mother.

618
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:15,720
Prabha, will you take me there?

619
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:21,316
Get up...

620
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,434
<i>- Look she's coming. He's bringing her..
- Though crying she's beautiful.</i>

621
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,343
Why are you going with him?

622
00:46:41,014 --> 00:46:42,845
If you tell me the rate,
I'll also join him.

623
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:01,228
Beat him!

624
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,799
Beat him...don't leave him.

625
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:18,711
<i>Beat him... don't spare him.</i>

626
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,854
Leave him, don't beat him...

627
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:26,016
<i>Don't leave him...beat him...</i>

628
00:47:26,226 --> 00:47:29,821
<i>Wretched woman!
You ruined my family.</i>

629
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:50,344
I'll open...

630
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:55,082
Please go inside, sir.

631
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:07,758
My hubby"-

632
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:29,050
Father...

633
00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:00,480
<i>After leaving Anandhi in her place,</i>

634
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:02,544
<i>Without knowing where to go...</i>

635
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,586
<i>I came back to
my Tamil teacher's room.</i>

636
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,697
The entire room was <i>filled</i> with
his fragrance and his voice.

637
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,639
The cruel death which was away from
my life returned with vengeance.

638
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:24,109
A life chased by death!

639
00:49:25,278 --> 00:49:29,044
I left to see Anandhi with the
address she gave me.

640
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,262
<i>Where is lady tailor house?</i>

641
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:54,267
Come son... sit down.

642
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,307
- Finished school?
- Yes, it's over.

643
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:02,079
He passed away leaving Rs 150!

644
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:05,217
My daughter hasn't touched
water too for 2 days.

645
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,148
She isn't listening to me.

646
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:09,012
At least you advise her.

647
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,048
- Where is she?
- She is inside.

648
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:17,855
Anandhi...

649
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:40,252
Anandhi, look at me..

650
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:44,021
Am I not here...

651
00:50:44,591 --> 00:50:47,685
I lost my mother,
grandparents in my childhood.

652
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:49,751
What can we do?

653
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:52,957
I'm telling you, ain't I?

654
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:56,062
Please eat food.

655
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:04,467
All are deriding me
an illegitimate daughter.

656
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,204
It's paining me.

657
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:10,043
Leave that...

658
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,411
You knew about my mother now only.

659
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,079
What would you've thought about me?

660
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:21,288
Shit! You fool!

661
00:51:22,462 --> 00:51:26,865
You're always my little Anandhi
who presented me feathers.

662
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:34,131
Really?

663
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:47,276
Hey, have food.

664
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:49,555
- I'll have it later.
- Have it now..

665
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:51,355
I'll have it later.

666
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:55,625
<i>I'm living for you only...</i>

667
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,821
<i>My shoulder is for you
to rest only...</i>

668
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:08,771
<i>There's no stopping for the new dawn...
Let anyone say anything...</i>

669
00:52:08,975 --> 00:52:13,537
<i>My dear! I'll be with you forever...</i>

670
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:18,116
<i>My life turns meaningful
with your one smile...</i>

671
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,516
<i>The second time you smile will
wash away the sins of my life...</i>

672
00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:27,017
<i>I'm living for you only...</i>

673
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:31,254
<i>My shoulder is for you
to rest only...</i>

674
00:52:31,464 --> 00:52:40,133
<i>There's no stopping for the new dawn...
Let anyone say anything...</i>

675
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:45,368
<i>My dear! I'll be with you forever...</i>

676
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,572
<i>My life turns meaningful
with your one smile...</i>

677
00:52:49,783 --> 00:52:53,947
<i>The second time you smile will
wash away the sins of my life...</i>

678
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,348
Why did you come at this time?

679
00:52:58,158 --> 00:52:59,318
I missed the last bus.

680
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,828
Where will you stay tonight?

681
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:13,002
It's okay. I'll stay in the lodge.

682
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,603
This is small place...
That's why I'm telling you..

683
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:17,868
Please don't mistake me.

684
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:21,479
It's okay. I'll get a room outside.

685
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:28,045
- Sorry...
- It's okay..

686
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:39,257
<i>Even rain fed lands don't
perish awaiting rains...</i>

687
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:47,635
<i>Images may disappear, but mirror
won't forget those images...</i>

688
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:56,815
<i>When ever I smell the fragrance of rain,</i>
<i>it brings the memory of your sweat...</i>

689
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:05,190
<i>Even death is a boon to me...</i>

690
00:54:05,392 --> 00:54:09,385
<i>My life turns meaningful
with your one smile...</i>

691
00:54:09,596 --> 00:54:13,555
<i>The second time you smile will
wash away the sins of my life...</i>

692
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:17,464
You took loan happily, didn't you?

693
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,002
Is it paining to pay interest?

694
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:24,099
You waited so long, my brother
promised to send money in a month..

695
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,675
I'll pay you as soon as I get it.

696
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:27,437
You promise to pay in a month.

697
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:29,410
Anyway I'll take that bike.

698
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:31,140
You pay money and
take back your bike.

699
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,750
I can't take flak from my boss.

700
00:54:32,952 --> 00:54:35,045
Anandhi, get bike keys.

701
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:36,320
What's this mother?

702
00:54:37,057 --> 00:54:38,183
This is Prabha's bike.

703
00:54:38,892 --> 00:54:40,860
No mother, it's not fair.

704
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:43,858
Prabha won't mistake me.
You get the keys.

705
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,796
I won't..

706
00:54:48,468 --> 00:54:49,093
Anandhi...

707
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,270
Someone has left his <i>bike</i> here.
You push it nicely...

708
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:04,708
Okay, I'll talk to you later...

709
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:06,444
Come, dear...

710
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:09,953
Mother, you tell me...

711
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,754
You tell...

712
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,787
<i>How can I tell him?</i>

713
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,626
Mother, you tell him...

714
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,526
<i>What's it?</i>

715
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,829
I got my results, I passed.

716
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:29,566
Won't you congratulate me?

717
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:32,206
- Congrats.
- What's that?

718
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,735
Take sweets, mother.

719
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:35,870
You tell him..

720
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:37,043
Mother...

721
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:41,651
What are you going to study further?

722
00:55:41,855 --> 00:55:42,514
Tamil.

723
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:44,186
<i>Why? Have you scored less marks?</i>

724
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:46,922
- I've scored high marks.
- Why then?

725
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:50,196
Didn't I tell you about my warden sir?

726
00:55:50,396 --> 00:55:52,660
- He gave me this bike...
- Yes...

727
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:54,496
He studied Tamil.

728
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,096
He was a Tamil teacher, lived happily.

729
00:55:57,537 --> 00:56:00,700
That's why if I also study Tamil,
I think I'll have a good life.

730
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:07,578
What happened?

731
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:14,143
Money lender took away your bike.

732
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,221
It's okay. Nothing to worry about it!

733
00:56:20,426 --> 00:56:23,827
Next month, we will get money.

734
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,496
I'll get back your bike, dear.

735
00:56:26,232 --> 00:56:28,462
It's okay, mother. No problem.

736
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:34,634
Hey, why are you crying like a child?

737
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:35,875
Didn't I tell you not to worry?

738
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,633
Go and get water..

739
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:00,829
Why is he crying?

740
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:02,759
Hey...

741
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:05,163
Hey, what's this?

742
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:11,176
Have it..

743
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:18,215
<i>Though this moment elapses,
memories will last forever...</i>

744
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:26,549
<i>Even if photos disintegrate,
reality will never disintegrate...</i>

745
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:35,834
The pleasentest <i>music I</i> ever heard
is you uttering my name...

746
00:57:36,236 --> 00:57:40,229
<i>You're my life...</i>

747
00:57:40,473 --> 00:57:44,204
<i>I'm nothing without you...</i>

748
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:48,369
<i>My life turns meaningful
with your one smile...</i>

749
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:52,711
<i>The second time you smile will
wash away the sins of my life...</i>

750
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:57,380
<i>I'm living for you only...</i>

751
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:01,458
<i>My shoulder is for you
to rest only...</i>

752
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:07,759
<i>There's no stopping for the new dawn...
Let anyone say anything...</i>

753
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:24,578
<i>My dear! I'll be with you forever...
Let anyone say anything...</i>

754
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:27,010
When will you come back again?

755
00:58:32,025 --> 00:58:33,617
After my first semester.

756
00:58:45,338 --> 00:58:46,032
Have it.

757
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:47,937
Don't you've sense?

758
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:50,200
In hot sun, you're asking me
to drink hot water.

759
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,900
If all that you said is true,

760
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,408
Drink it before my mother comes back.

761
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,278
Do you know why she offered hot water?

762
00:59:03,656 --> 00:59:04,384
No, sir..

763
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,614
Didn't get it?

764
00:59:07,593 --> 00:59:09,185
Is it arranged or love marriage?

765
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:13,663
If I love I'll get a girl,
I'll not get dowry.

766
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,226
What did you get?

767
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:21,896
80 grams gold chain, a bike on
installment, an apartment,

768
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:27,603
all household articles including
the Jockey brief I'm wearing now.

769
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,551
You can get all that but
can you get a glass of hot water?

770
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:36,414
Should I've to drink this?

771
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:39,917
Mother used to cook for you
on your every visit,

772
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:41,616
you never allowed me to
try my culinary skills,

773
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,523
at least in these few minutes
when mother isn't at home,

774
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:47,757
all I could cook for you
is this glass of hot water.

775
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:49,366
Please drink it.

776
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:05,211
When ever I burnt my tongue after that,
I always thought about her only.

777
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:11,381
So, drink hot coffee,
drink hot tea...

778
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:17,892
Burn your lips and
remember the people,

779
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:19,222
who remembers you.

780
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:25,194
So drink hot coffee, drink hot tea.

781
01:00:25,605 --> 01:00:29,598
Burn your lips & remember your
people who remembers you.

782
01:00:43,122 --> 01:00:46,922
- Hello...Dudley Hostel?
- Go straight.

783
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:53,560
Excuse me, I was also
allotted this room.

784
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:54,733
Please come in.

785
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,535
I'm Anantharangan,
Computer Science, you...?

786
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:06,102
Prabhakar, Tamil.

787
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:07,177
Tamil?

788
01:01:07,713 --> 01:01:08,941
Why are you regretting for it?

789
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:11,673
If you're in Maths or English,
I can ask help from you.

790
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:14,612
That's all, nothing else!
You don't mistake me.

791
01:01:16,222 --> 01:01:18,554
- Hey, Ranga.
- Ranjit! When did you come?

792
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,783
- Today morning.
- Where's the toilet?

793
01:01:20,993 --> 01:01:22,187
Go last and turn right.

794
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:22,861
Thank you.

795
01:01:23,062 --> 01:01:26,259
What a fate! I got a fool who can't speak
English as my room mate.

796
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,763
- He's a torture.
- Forget it buddy.

797
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,899
<i>There's a tradition in this college.</i>

798
01:01:31,404 --> 01:01:33,031
<i>One who can speak in
English is Peterox.</i>

799
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:35,730
<i>One who couldn't speak
in English is Munusamy.</i>

800
01:01:36,075 --> 01:01:38,475
<i>Without even bothering to know whether
I can speak in English or not,</i>

801
01:01:38,678 --> 01:01:40,646
<i>they decided! was a Munusamy.</i>

802
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,738
<i>I accepted it grudgingly.</i>

803
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,481
- Your name?
- Murugan sir.

804
01:01:45,084 --> 01:01:46,449
<i>- From?</i>
- Thachchampatti sir.

805
01:01:46,752 --> 01:01:48,743
Thachchampatti?
Why did you choose to study Tamil?

806
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,650
We've an acre of fertile land
in my village,

807
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:51,915
they said I can get loan
if I finish graduation,

808
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,990
so I chose Tamil to finish it easily.
That's why.

809
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:57,720
Studying Tamil for availing loan?
Good intention, please sit down.

810
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,226
Get up. Your name?

811
01:02:03,436 --> 01:02:05,904
- Seorge.
- Say George.

812
01:02:06,105 --> 01:02:08,005
- George.
- Tell me why did you choose Tamil?

813
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:09,606
I didn't get seat in any
other course, so...

814
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,901
How many attempts in 12th class?

815
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,169
- 2 or 3?
- No sir, 4.

816
01:02:13,379 --> 01:02:16,974
<i>4 attempts, chose to study Tamil,
thank you very much, please sit down.</i>

817
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:19,878
White shirt, get up!

818
01:02:20,453 --> 01:02:22,148
- Your name?
- Prabhakar sir.

819
01:02:22,355 --> 01:02:23,720
Why did you choose to study Tamil?

820
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,082
I love Tamil sir.

821
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,521
You love Tamil?
How many attempts to pass 12th class?

822
01:02:27,727 --> 01:02:29,194
- Only one attempt.
- Just one attempt?

823
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,158
- Your total marks?
- 1100, sir.

824
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:33,127
- Third group?
- No sir, first group.

825
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,995
First group? 1100?
Show me your marks list.

826
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:39,569
Show me your marks list.
First group? 1100? Show me.

827
01:02:40,406 --> 01:02:43,432
Show...Maths 197, Physics 190...

828
01:02:43,643 --> 01:02:47,101
You would've got medical or
engineering seat for these marks.

829
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:50,214
I did get sir, but I love Tamil so...

830
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:51,279
This will not work out.

831
01:02:51,484 --> 01:02:53,111
Come with your father and
get TC from here,

832
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:55,150
and join some medical
or engineering college.

833
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:59,514
Is there any law barring students
with 1100 marks to study Tamil?

834
01:02:59,725 --> 01:03:02,489
You give it in writing,
I'll meet the principal.

835
01:03:02,728 --> 01:03:04,389
You'll understand words,

836
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,258
you'll feel pain only when you get hurt,
get yourself ruined.

837
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:09,124
<i>When a good student
chose to study Tamil,</i>

838
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:10,893
<i>the Tamil department
back then derided me,</i>

839
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,800
<i>why did! chose Tamil to study?</i>

840
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,575
College means song, dance and <i>fun.</i>

841
01:03:18,778 --> 01:03:20,678
<i>My heart was filled with Anandhi.</i>

842
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,212
<i>I was waiting for my first
semester holidays.</i>

843
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:28,145
<i>3 months...season change, holidays,
all came together.</i>

844
01:03:30,856 --> 01:03:32,346
They vacated the place.

845
01:03:35,094 --> 01:03:35,924
When?

846
01:03:36,128 --> 01:03:38,653
Their brother took them with him
as living here turned miserable.

847
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:43,033
- Did they leave any address?
- No.

848
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,040
<i>I held her hands and walked
with her thoughts only.</i>

849
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:57,112
<i>She walked along with me holding my hand
hearing about a non-existent tiger.</i>

850
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:05,315
She was dreaming about the
non-existent tiger & non-existent desert.

851
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:08,223
Do you understand me?

852
01:04:13,232 --> 01:04:14,164
What are you thinking?

853
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:18,733
I've been holding it for long time,
I want to pee.

854
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:24,034
Go left side...

855
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,402
ls there a toilet?

856
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:27,376
There is...you go.

857
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:29,343
Good bye!

858
01:04:29,915 --> 01:04:31,314
He has kept in hall
what should be in toilet,

859
01:04:31,517 --> 01:04:33,144
I don't know what will I find there.

860
01:04:57,109 --> 01:05:00,010
- 94440...hello...
- Hello.

861
01:05:00,212 --> 01:05:02,009
I'm Yuvan...hey Kumar.

862
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,116
He cut the line...
it's ringing...

863
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,286
A bearded man kidnapped me
along with my camera.

864
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,716
- Can you hear me?
- Say it clearly.

865
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:12,354
A bearded man kidnapped me
along with my camera, buddy,

866
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:14,583
I'm in T. Nagar only.

867
01:05:14,794 --> 01:05:16,284
Don't get tensed, keep the
mobile phone switched on,

868
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:17,655
<i>- we can find using the tower.
- Okay.</i>

869
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:20,661
- You know the place?
- I don't know the address.

870
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:22,094
<i>- Don't worry...
- Number 30.</i>

871
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:23,131
Number 30.

872
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,667
<i>- Akbar</i> godown.
- Akbar godown.

873
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:26,201
<i>- Akbar?
- Vaidhyaraman street.</i>

874
01:05:26,405 --> 01:05:26,996
Vaidhya...?

875
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:29,797
<i>Hello...Kasi...</i>

876
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,035
Sir, actually 'Ushar makkan' program
is scheduled tomorrow...

877
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:35,645
I get stuck in a room
with door like this.

878
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:41,286
I'm confused how to get away & suddenly
a bearded man like you appears.

879
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:46,220
I'm practicing for TV program,
just the same scene...

880
01:05:46,425 --> 01:05:47,949
He would've pushed you
just like this.

881
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,151
<i>He didn't push just like this sir.</i>

882
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,387
He would've grabbed you
just like this.

883
01:05:51,597 --> 01:05:52,529
He didn't grab me just like this sir.

884
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:54,222
- Come.
- Sir...sir.

885
01:05:54,433 --> 01:05:59,928
<i>Sir...I did it by mistake...sir.</i>

886
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,320
If you've mobile, you need tower,

887
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,147
they will follow you
if there's a tower.

888
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,989
- What's the cost of this mobile?
- Rs.8000 sir.

889
01:06:26,632 --> 01:06:28,361
Rs. 8000? What features does it
have to cost so much?

890
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,192
There's a camera in it sir.

891
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,927
You've a camera worth Rs.150 thousands,
why do you need this?

892
01:06:32,138 --> 01:06:36,165
- Is it to stealthily take girls' photos?
- No sir...no sir.

893
01:06:37,109 --> 01:06:38,201
Your salary?

894
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,309
Rs.10000 sir.

895
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:42,407
You need Rs. 8000 worth mobile
for Rs. 10000 salary.

896
01:06:42,615 --> 01:06:44,412
If I break it, you'll not buy a new one.

897
01:06:48,954 --> 01:06:51,855
Are you trying to escape from me
using this SIM card?

898
01:06:52,057 --> 01:06:53,684
- What SIM?
- Read it.

899
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:55,554
- Hutch.
- Have you seen the ad?

900
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:56,523
I've seen it sir.

901
01:06:56,729 --> 01:06:59,357
A boy walks and a dog follows him.

902
01:06:59,565 --> 01:07:00,759
Wherever you go I follow.

903
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:02,194
Wherever you go I follow.

904
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:05,700
When a dog can follow you,
won't I follow you?

905
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:07,702
Catch it, take your SIM card
when you leave.

906
01:07:08,841 --> 01:07:10,934
Can I open the door little?

907
01:07:11,243 --> 01:07:11,766
Why?

908
01:07:12,178 --> 01:07:15,306
You've very little hair on your face.

909
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,142
Moreover you're using
a very small glass frame.

910
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:22,116
If there's some light,
at least your nose will be visible.

911
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:24,146
Okay...okay.

912
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,163
Sorry sir, I got scared...
otherwise I wouldn't dare do that.

913
01:07:35,434 --> 01:07:36,662
Shall we have a black tea sir?

914
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:39,601
Okay sir...l make good tea sir.

915
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:46,244
You say you've no one,
but you had father and Anandhi.

916
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:50,107
<i>Either you're lying to me
or hiding truth from me.</i>

917
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:51,581
<i>Take it.</i>

918
01:07:51,884 --> 01:07:54,876
<i>Don't lie, Anandhi was in India, right?</i>

919
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,451
<i>If you'd searched,
you could've found her.</i>

920
01:07:57,022 --> 01:07:58,455
Are you talking about searching with me?

921
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,385
Sit down.

922
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:02,084
Did I give him tension?

923
01:08:03,362 --> 01:08:04,852
How many letters did you get in your life?

924
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,256
Many letters sir.

925
01:08:06,465 --> 01:08:08,456
Including unsigned letter
to dismiss me from my job.

926
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,656
You're very lucky.

927
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:19,105
I've got only three letters in my <i>life.</i>

928
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:21,108
<i>Still I</i> remember my first letter.

929
01:08:21,547 --> 01:08:25,506
<i>April 12th, M.A. second year,
final semester.</i>

930
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,375
<i>A letter from my Anandhi.</i>

931
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:30,246
<i>A letter without sender's address.</i>

932
01:08:31,423 --> 01:08:34,324
<i>Prabha, I know you would've
searched for me,</i>

933
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,389
<i>I</i> and my mother are in
Maharashtra with an uncle.

934
01:08:38,597 --> 01:08:42,966
I'll intimate when you need
to write to me or meet me.

935
01:08:43,168 --> 01:08:44,226
<i>Eat at right time.</i>

936
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:46,232
Take bath at least thrice in a week.

937
01:08:46,438 --> 01:08:47,928
<i>Wash the socks and wear it.</i>

938
01:08:48,173 --> 01:08:51,336
<i>Don't bite nails, pray to God, Anandhi.</i>

939
01:09:03,756 --> 01:09:06,850
<i>Where are you my bird?</i>

940
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:10,320
<i>You're inviting me also to ﬂy...</i>

941
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:17,066
<i>I'm coming in search of you, my love...</i>

942
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:21,033
<i>Where are you my bird?</i>

943
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,570
<i>You're inviting me also to ﬂy...</i>

944
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:30,746
<i>I'm coming in search
of you, my love...</i>

945
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:37,719
<i>You're the starting
point of my earth...</i>

946
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:44,852
<i>You're my path and destination...</i>

947
01:09:45,064 --> 01:09:47,225
<i>Whichever direction I see...</i>

948
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:50,798
<i>I see your face only...</i>

949
01:09:51,971 --> 01:09:59,503
Can <i>I</i> see fishes in mirage?
Can eyes lie to me?

950
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:06,140
<i>Your letters are like a sea to me...</i>

951
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:13,256
<i>I'm ﬂoating on it like a boat...</i>

952
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,791
<i>Where are you my bird?</i>

953
01:10:18,163 --> 01:10:21,291
<i>You're inviting me also to ﬂy...</i>

954
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:28,130
<i>I'm coming in search of you, my love...</i>

955
01:11:04,943 --> 01:11:06,376
- How are you?
- Fine.

956
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:09,771
- Uncle wanted money for the tea.
- I'll give.

957
01:11:13,952 --> 01:11:14,646
Bye.

958
01:11:24,963 --> 01:11:25,987
How did you come here?

959
01:11:27,066 --> 01:11:28,897
After traveling 2000 kms,

960
01:11:29,968 --> 01:11:33,369
sleepless for two nights,
in an alien place,

961
01:11:33,806 --> 01:11:38,106
when I found the girl I thought
was impossible to find...

962
01:11:38,811 --> 01:11:41,211
if she asks, how did you come here?
What would be your reaction?

963
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:43,313
I feel like slapping her hard.

964
01:11:43,515 --> 01:11:46,814
Leaving the real lover,
they give life for ditchers.

965
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:48,486
Women are always like this.

966
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:51,949
When I took an enlarged photocopy
of the seal on the letter,

967
01:11:52,157 --> 01:11:55,024
when I found Savargaon,
Sangamner in Maharashtra,

968
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,285
they said there's no train
service to this place.

969
01:11:56,495 --> 01:11:59,987
I got down at Pune, then bus, then tractor,
and walked down to this place.

970
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:02,030
When I came here, they said
there were 12 Savargoans here.

971
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,895
I visited six places and
when I got up from sleep,

972
01:12:04,103 --> 01:12:04,797
I saw you standing before me.

973
01:12:05,003 --> 01:12:08,632
If you hadn't come, I would've settled
here running a Pani poori shop.

974
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:10,806
Really?

975
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:31,390
<i>The path I go along with you...</i>

976
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:38,829
<i>Won't it go on forever like the horizon?</i>

977
01:12:39,371 --> 01:12:45,742
<i>Let's talk our way out...
Flying with the air...</i>

978
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:52,850
<i>Your silence is enough
if there's nothing to talk...</i>

979
01:12:53,051 --> 01:12:59,923
<i>Aren't this grass, plants,
birds and we enough?</i>

980
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:07,327
<i>Won't this world turn
beautiful with this?</i>

981
01:13:08,433 --> 01:13:11,425
<i>First time I feel like I want to live...</i>

982
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:15,032
<i>First time I see some light
in my dark life...</i>

983
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:21,345
<i>First time a broken branch
is ﬂowering...</i>

984
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:25,482
<i>First time the door is open...</i>

985
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:29,087
<i>First time the wind is blowing in...</i>

986
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:35,582
<i>First time my dream is
coming true, my love...</i>

987
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,534
Prabha, that's my house.

988
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:47,571
I'll go first...take this.

989
01:13:55,247 --> 01:13:55,872
Wait.

990
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:04,321
Uncle...uncle...

991
01:14:05,891 --> 01:14:07,188
He came from far away.

992
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,590
- Come in.
- Mother, it's Prabhakar.

993
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:13,990
Come in, please sit down.

994
01:14:14,499 --> 01:14:15,193
Greetings.

995
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:17,899
When did you come?

996
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:21,332
3 days ago.

997
01:14:21,573 --> 01:14:22,540
What brings you here?

998
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:26,333
I've few friends in Ahmednagar,
so I came down here to meet...

999
01:14:31,016 --> 01:14:31,983
When are you leaving?

1000
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:36,619
I'll leave today.

1001
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,320
Prabha, you come in.

1002
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:45,488
Sit here.

1003
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:48,226
- Are you fine?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1004
01:14:49,968 --> 01:14:54,803
I'm very happy that
you've come here to meet us.

1005
01:14:59,044 --> 01:15:03,105
- He's harsh, you don't take
it to the heart.- No...

1006
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:04,976
How's your father doing?

1007
01:15:05,217 --> 01:15:05,876
He's fine.

1008
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:09,451
What are you doing sitting at home?
Come out.

1009
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:11,417
Wait, I'm coming.

1010
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:13,724
Then I understood,

1011
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:17,191
sometimes God sends
angels on cycles,

1012
01:15:17,396 --> 01:15:18,624
makes them speak
in Marathi language,

1013
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:20,297
and take the villains out.

1014
01:15:20,499 --> 01:15:23,559
God is great!
He's a scholar of many languages.

1015
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:27,728
Most probably he would've been tourist guide
in his previous birth if he had one,

1016
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,804
am I right?

1017
01:15:38,016 --> 01:15:38,710
What?

1018
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:42,447
Chocolates for you.

1019
01:15:42,654 --> 01:15:43,313
Keep it there.

1020
01:15:46,425 --> 01:15:47,722
Why don't you take it yourself?

1021
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,055
Can't you see I'm working?

1022
01:15:52,097 --> 01:15:57,797
<i>What would you say to a visitor who visits
you traveling long distance?</i>

1023
01:15:58,704 --> 01:16:00,171
Though I may not like the guest,

1024
01:16:00,372 --> 01:16:03,068
still for courtesy sake, I'll ask the
guest to stay for two days.

1025
01:16:03,275 --> 01:16:05,709
I too asked her with
that hope only.

1026
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:09,011
Okay, I'll take leave now.

1027
01:16:11,383 --> 01:16:12,077
Okay.

1028
01:16:35,574 --> 01:16:37,007
Okay, I'll leave now.

1029
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:38,206
Why?

1030
01:16:38,643 --> 01:16:39,473
No, I'll leave now.

1031
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:44,337
I'll take leave.

1032
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:46,480
What mother?

1033
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,217
He came traveling a long distance,

1034
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,285
take him to the temple
and send him off.

1035
01:16:50,822 --> 01:16:52,813
No mother, uncle will get angry.

1036
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,459
Forget about that drunkard,
I'll manage him,

1037
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,558
you go with him.

1038
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:03,297
Come in.

1039
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:05,800
Uncle gave the keys.
I'm going to the temple.

1040
01:17:06,004 --> 01:17:07,904
- Who is he?
- A friend. Is it?

1041
01:17:10,842 --> 01:17:11,570
What are you looking at?

1042
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,541
I want to buy you a dress.

1043
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:16,304
Find a job first, you can buy
dress for me later.

1044
01:17:16,515 --> 01:17:18,449
I know when to buy you a dress,
you come with me.

1045
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:25,518
You know I don't like blue color.

1046
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:28,425
Okay, select yourself.

1047
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,204
Yuck! This isn't good, is it?

1048
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,607
- Is it a dress?
- It's good.

1049
01:17:50,615 --> 01:17:51,946
What a color!

1050
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:53,276
What an awful taste!

1051
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:54,315
Shut up!

1052
01:17:55,387 --> 01:17:56,649
Rs.230.

1053
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:59,779
Isn't this good?

1054
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:02,320
You can take that one...

1055
01:18:03,061 --> 01:18:05,359
Buy this one or else I don't want.

1056
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:08,391
<i>It's very embarrassing
to love without money.</i>

1057
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,428
<i>But my Anandhi, for my sake
gave up what she liked,</i>

1058
01:18:11,636 --> 01:18:14,400
<i>understanding my condition
says she dislikes it.</i>

1059
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:19,872
<i>I found that day, love of poor people has
many such moments of happiness.</i>

1060
01:18:21,246 --> 01:18:22,736
I've been watching you Anandhi,

1061
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:26,349
you're affectionate sometimes
and harsh sometimes.

1062
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:27,652
Why?

1063
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,714
I'm happy the time I'm
spending with you,

1064
01:18:31,223 --> 01:18:34,556
but do you know how many answers
I've to give my uncle for your visit?

1065
01:18:34,926 --> 01:18:36,325
I shudder to think.

1066
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:38,826
Am I not here?
Why are you so scared?

1067
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:42,488
You've come now,
will you be with me all my life?

1068
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:43,531
No, isn't it?

1069
01:18:43,768 --> 01:18:46,259
I fear I may end up like my mother.

1070
01:18:53,044 --> 01:18:54,238
Why are you still standing there?
Come.

1071
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:01,343
Why is everyone touching
the tree in reverence?

1072
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:03,582
It's a faith, Prabha.

1073
01:19:03,788 --> 01:19:07,952
It seems some 300 years ago
a Saint did penance under this tree,

1074
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,221
people believe touching this tree
will fulfill their wishes.

1075
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:15,189
You too make a wish
and touch the tree.

1076
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,163
- I'm sure you'll get it.
- Okay.

1077
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:35,843
That tree and Anandhi sitting
next to me are same,

1078
01:19:36,555 --> 01:19:42,983
<i>people wish to touch the Saint
by touching this tree,</i>

1079
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:45,429
<i>today</i> she's sitting next to me,

1080
01:19:45,764 --> 01:19:47,994
<i>her shoulder is touching my shoulder,</i>

1081
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:50,800
<i>I can hear her breath.</i>

1082
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,163
<i>I forgot that I'm a man now.</i>

1083
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:56,565
<i>I became a 7 year old boy that day.</i>

1084
01:19:56,942 --> 01:20:01,072
<i>What do you call someone who
turns you into a 7 year old boy?</i>

1085
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,268
God!

1086
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:07,814
What are you looking at?

1087
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,325
Look here Prabha!

1088
01:20:18,196 --> 01:20:22,758
My father bought a similar dress from
co-optex when I was a little girl,

1089
01:20:23,435 --> 01:20:26,370
Just like this, I was yearning to buy
something like this for years.

1090
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:31,270
Same color with flowery designs.
It needed you to buy it for me.

1091
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:34,576
Generally I lie.

1092
01:20:34,779 --> 01:20:36,576
She used to ask if I was
telling truth or lie.

1093
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:41,115
But she's lying now.
A lie that can make me happy.

1094
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:48,452
I felt then if there weren't lies there wouldn't
be beauty or wonders in this world.

1095
01:21:03,141 --> 01:21:17,112
<i>Poor man's love is like a stream
born amidst the mountains...</i>

1096
01:21:17,322 --> 01:21:27,323
<i>Though falling from a height,
without breaking up...</i>

1097
01:21:27,532 --> 01:21:34,631
<i>It runs through the plains
like a river...</i>

1098
01:21:34,839 --> 01:21:41,403
<i>This is enough in my journey,
my dear...</i>

1099
01:21:41,613 --> 01:21:46,016
<i>What else do I need...</i>

1100
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:52,120
<i>Though away from you...I can live with
this moment fresh in my heart...</i>

1101
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:59,196
<i>Won't this moment of life
carry on forever?</i>

1102
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:06,803
<i>Won't my lonely journey
come to end this moment?</i>

1103
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:10,641
<i>First time I feel like I want to live...</i>

1104
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:14,204
<i>First time I see some light
in my dark life...</i>

1105
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:20,914
<i>First time a broken branch
is ﬂowering...</i>

1106
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,712
<i>First time the door is open...</i>

1107
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:28,382
<i>First time the wind is blowing in...</i>

1108
01:22:28,927 --> 01:22:34,229
<i>First time my dream is
coming true, my love...</i>

1109
01:22:39,671 --> 01:22:41,730
I think we've reached the village.
Where to get down?

1110
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:45,737
Here only...I'll get down here.

1111
01:22:46,244 --> 01:22:48,610
Next stop is bus stand,
get down there.

1112
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:51,572
Please stay till I leave.

1113
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:57,684
No, I'm already late,
uncle will scold me. So..

1114
01:23:00,525 --> 01:23:02,493
If you want I'll drop you at home.

1115
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:07,022
Why trouble yourself again
to climb the mountain?

1116
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:08,699
I said I'll go.

1117
01:23:12,103 --> 01:23:13,161
I said I'll come with you.

1118
01:23:15,707 --> 01:23:16,366
Okay.

1119
01:23:19,878 --> 01:23:22,676
Stop. I'll go on my own from here.

1120
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:27,309
I'll drop you a little further.

1121
01:23:27,619 --> 01:23:29,416
No need Prabha.

1122
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:33,082
Uncle will chide me if he
sees with you again.

1123
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,121
Any problem with your uncle?

1124
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:38,955
He's a good man.

1125
01:23:39,164 --> 01:23:42,065
He's been taking care of me and
my mother for the past 4 years.

1126
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:46,530
Just short tempered. That's all.
Shall I go?

1127
01:23:48,406 --> 01:23:50,237
I'll finish my studies in 10 days.

1128
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,138
I'll go to village and talk to my father,

1129
01:23:53,645 --> 01:23:55,977
and take you and your
mother to my home.

1130
01:23:56,414 --> 01:23:57,904
I'll surely find a job.

1131
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:03,348
Are you really saying this?

1132
01:24:10,261 --> 01:24:11,125
Bye.

1133
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:13,326
Take it.

1134
01:24:23,908 --> 01:24:25,000
Bye Prabha.

1135
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:33,374
Your dress.

1136
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:38,150
I'll come.

1137
01:24:42,627 --> 01:24:43,286
Take it.

1138
01:24:47,131 --> 01:24:49,565
I'll come to drop you little further.

1139
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:50,768
No Prabha.

1140
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,595
I'll go my own.

1141
01:24:53,137 --> 01:24:54,832
Okay? Go carefully.

1142
01:24:58,142 --> 01:24:59,131
Bye.

1143
01:25:15,894 --> 01:25:17,589
<i>When I went back to my place,</i>

1144
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:22,326
<i>second letter of my life
was waiting for me.</i>

1145
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:25,199
It delivered the news
of my father's death.

1146
01:25:25,503 --> 01:25:29,735
<i>I went to Madras in search of a job
with a recommendation letter.</i>

1147
01:25:29,974 --> 01:25:43,786
<i>Bharat is like the face beauteous
of Earth clad in wavy seas;</i>

1148
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:51,393
<i>Deccan is her brow crescent-like
on which the fragrant 'Tilak'</i>

1149
01:25:52,697 --> 01:25:59,660
<i>is the blessed Dravidian land.</i>

1150
01:26:00,371 --> 01:26:06,833
<i>Like the fragrance of that 'Tilak'
plunging the world in joy</i>

1151
01:26:08,012 --> 01:26:17,751
<i>supreme reigns Goddess Tamil
with renown spread far and wide.</i>

1152
01:26:18,056 --> 01:26:24,017
<i>Praise unto You, Goddess Tamil,</i>

1153
01:26:24,228 --> 01:26:31,031
<i>whose majestic youthfulness,
inspires awe and ecstasy.</i>

1154
01:26:36,074 --> 01:26:36,904
Whisper...?

1155
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,302
Large or medium?

1156
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:40,041
I don't know.

1157
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:44,207
Some how I got 6 kgs of rice
and 6 kgs of wheat flour,

1158
01:26:44,682 --> 01:26:47,082
bought a whipser packet
without knowing the size,

1159
01:26:47,418 --> 01:26:49,113
I got a Tamil teacher's job.

1160
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:52,449
- Phone for you.
- Coming.

1161
01:26:52,924 --> 01:26:54,789
- It's me Prabha here.
- Tell me.

1162
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:57,152
- I got a job here.
- Superb!

1163
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,259
No need to search a job
for me in Tambaram.

1164
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:01,120
If you get time, please come here.

1165
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:03,965
Time is running out, I'll hang up.

1166
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:05,726
Wait, when will you get your salary?

1167
01:27:06,104 --> 01:27:09,232
- I think it's 5th.
- I'll come on 5th without fail.

1168
01:27:09,674 --> 01:27:12,905
- You'll never reform, I'll cut the line.
- Wait...listen...

1169
01:27:13,945 --> 01:27:14,775
You're new to Madras,

1170
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,844
- feel free to ask any help.
- Definitely sir.

1171
01:27:17,048 --> 01:27:19,482
Mess is on the third floor,
climbing 3 floors is difficult,

1172
01:27:19,684 --> 01:27:21,845
but Chechi's mess is top quality.

1173
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:26,446
- Hi Stella!
- Hi Gopal!

1174
01:27:27,058 --> 01:27:27,854
Who is he?

1175
01:27:28,059 --> 01:27:30,254
- He's Prabhakar, Tamil teacher.
- Greetings.

1176
01:27:30,461 --> 01:27:31,792
New face to our mansion.

1177
01:27:32,196 --> 01:27:34,255
He'll do it poetically.

1178
01:27:38,036 --> 01:27:39,196
Who is she? Your classmate?

1179
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:40,969
Classmate? Stella turn back.

1180
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:45,100
We call girls sporting
plastic flowers as 'Jaari'.

1181
01:27:45,309 --> 01:27:46,276
In Chennai they are known as 'Route'.

1182
01:27:46,477 --> 01:27:48,911
In your chaste Tamil,
it's 'Parathai' (call girl).

1183
01:27:51,549 --> 01:27:53,813
You don't mistake me,
I say openly what I feel.

1184
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:56,452
If you go straight and turn left,
you'll find the mess.

1185
01:27:56,654 --> 01:27:58,645
Just 5 minutes,
I'll have a quickie and come.

1186
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,228
Prabhakar sirmgreetings sir.

1187
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,304
- Greetings.
- Come here sir.

1188
01:28:16,607 --> 01:28:17,403
Come this side.

1189
01:28:17,608 --> 01:28:18,074
You are...?

1190
01:28:18,276 --> 01:28:20,244
I also stay in your mansion,
come here.

1191
01:28:23,948 --> 01:28:24,676
Sit here sir.

1192
01:28:25,349 --> 01:28:25,815
Thanks.

1193
01:28:26,017 --> 01:28:28,577
I'm Suryanarayanan from Tharvoorkarai.

1194
01:28:28,786 --> 01:28:30,651
I heard you're a Tamil teacher.

1195
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:32,789
I'm very happy-

1196
01:28:33,257 --> 01:28:37,489
You're the first man to be happy
that I studied Tamil.

1197
01:28:37,695 --> 01:28:40,892
Matter isn't that sir,
you know Tamil,

1198
01:28:41,099 --> 01:28:44,398
you're good in writing poetry,
essays and songs, aren't you?

1199
01:28:44,602 --> 01:28:45,899
A little bit.

1200
01:28:46,437 --> 01:28:47,335
Please help me sir.

1201
01:28:47,538 --> 01:28:50,666
I tried many times but failed
to write a love letter.

1202
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:52,604
Love letter...? I can't write...

1203
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:56,041
What's this sir? You've studied Tamil,
you wear thickset glasses,

1204
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:57,544
sport a beard,

1205
01:28:57,782 --> 01:28:59,750
you still use fountain pen to write,

1206
01:28:59,951 --> 01:29:01,441
if not you who else can write?

1207
01:29:02,153 --> 01:29:03,347
Please write it for me.

1208
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,422
No problem, I've a pen.

1209
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:13,692
<i>I wrote a letter for him using all the words
I wished to write to Anandhi.</i>

1210
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,865
If the letter succeeds
<i>in</i> winning his love,

1211
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:19,059
<i>I had a bet that my Anandhi
will come back to me.</i>

1212
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:22,004
<i>Buddy...buddy...</i>

1213
01:29:25,076 --> 01:29:25,940
You here...?

1214
01:29:26,144 --> 01:29:28,806
Today is 5th, right?
Have you got your salary?

1215
01:29:29,013 --> 01:29:30,412
Can you escape from me?

1216
01:29:30,681 --> 01:29:31,875
Yes, you're very clever.

1217
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,072
Where are you taking me?

1218
01:29:33,317 --> 01:29:34,249
Where do you want to go?
Come let's go.

1219
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:35,544
Will you take me to Selvi?

1220
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:38,551
- Selvi?
- Napoleon's wife Selvi wines.

1221
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,156
- Come let's go.
- Where? Come I say!

1222
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,886
He brought me to clothes shop
instead of a bar.

1223
01:29:44,862 --> 01:29:47,194
I'll sit there, you finish shopping
and come fast.

1224
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:48,830
- Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay,

1225
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:51,761
<i>Who asked you to come
to this shop?</i>

1226
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:54,728
<i>I got my first salary,
I thought of buying you something.</i>

1227
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:56,964
<i>First do I tell you
with your first salary.</i>

1228
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:58,171
<i>What should I do?</i>

1229
01:29:58,709 --> 01:30:01,610
<i>Trim your big beard.</i>

1230
01:30:04,515 --> 01:30:05,174
Excuse me sir.

1231
01:30:07,451 --> 01:30:08,179
Ready ch u ridars?

1232
01:30:08,386 --> 01:30:09,546
Go last and turn right.

1233
01:30:13,624 --> 01:30:15,091
<i>You know I don't like blue.</i>

1234
01:30:15,293 --> 01:30:16,590
<i>Somebody refused it.</i>

1235
01:30:17,061 --> 01:30:18,619
<i>As if you listen to me.</i>

1236
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:21,930
Sleeveless? Have you gone mad?

1237
01:30:22,133 --> 01:30:23,122
<i>I'm going to kick you.</i>

1238
01:30:27,071 --> 01:30:32,703
<i>I found a similar churidar which you
refused seeing the rate Rs. 1300.</i>

1239
01:30:33,211 --> 01:30:34,007
<i>Price?</i>

1240
01:30:34,378 --> 01:30:36,778
<i>If I tell the price, you'll cite
a new reason to refuse it.</i>

1241
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:38,914
<i>I know what to do, take it.</i>

1242
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:39,809
Go boy!

1243
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:42,911
Have you finished shopping?

1244
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:44,484
How much?

1245
01:30:45,156 --> 01:30:46,783
Hey it's Rs.1800.

1246
01:30:46,991 --> 01:30:48,322
I know it, you bill it.

1247
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,724
- What's your salary?
- Rs. 2000.

1248
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:54,395
- How will you manage for your food bill?
- I know it, shut your gob.

1249
01:30:54,599 --> 01:30:55,293
You pack it.

1250
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,728
<i>- Hey Prabha!</i>
- Hey Ranga!

1251
01:31:00,271 --> 01:31:01,738
How are you Peterox?

1252
01:31:02,406 --> 01:31:03,236
How come you are here?

1253
01:31:03,441 --> 01:31:05,068
I came here a month ago.

1254
01:31:05,343 --> 01:31:06,901
I thought I'll never meet you
again after college.

1255
01:31:07,678 --> 01:31:08,610
I'm surprised.

1256
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,480
That's okay, buddy.
Where were you all these days?

1257
01:31:11,682 --> 01:31:13,582
I was in London, recently
shifted down to Madras.

1258
01:31:13,784 --> 01:31:16,048
You say you were in London
but the vermillion...

1259
01:31:18,122 --> 01:31:20,352
Whatever it is,
can we give up our culture?

1260
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:21,248
Super buddy!

1261
01:31:21,459 --> 01:31:23,757
- Hey Ananth! How is this?
- Fine.- Who is she?

1262
01:31:25,162 --> 01:31:25,992
My would be.

1263
01:31:26,864 --> 01:31:29,059
- Hello.
- This is my visiting card.

1264
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:30,928
Meet me in office in your free time.

1265
01:31:31,602 --> 01:31:32,569
- Okay?
- Sure.

1266
01:31:34,705 --> 01:31:35,637
He studied with me.

1267
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,000
Is your friend a primitive?

1268
01:31:38,209 --> 01:31:39,039
He's staring at me.

1269
01:31:39,543 --> 01:31:42,011
Forget him, he's a Tamil student,
his culture is like that.

1270
01:31:42,813 --> 01:31:43,780
Hey, come to my office.

1271
01:31:44,382 --> 01:31:45,679
Definitely.

1272
01:31:47,285 --> 01:31:49,219
901, near Thukaram Mandir,

1273
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:52,218
Savargaon, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra.

1274
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:55,688
I asked for Bacardi rum and you're
talking about Thukaram mandir,

1275
01:31:55,893 --> 01:31:57,724
You've read it 100 times,
it's perfect, post it.

1276
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,123
Wine shop may close.

1277
01:32:05,069 --> 01:32:06,627
Prabha, a letter.

1278
01:32:07,405 --> 01:32:09,236
Not for me, may be for the next room.

1279
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:11,063
From Anandhi.

1280
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,800
- Hey give it to me.
- Shouldn't I read it?

1281
01:32:14,578 --> 01:32:15,704
- Read...
- Am I not your friend?

1282
01:32:15,913 --> 01:32:16,880
You're my friend but give it to me.

1283
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:18,548
Is there anything hidden
in your life from me?

1284
01:32:18,749 --> 01:32:19,443
What's this? Give me...

1285
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:21,618
Say I'm not your friend,
I'll not read the letter.

1286
01:32:24,188 --> 01:32:26,622
Okay...okay...read it fast.

1287
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,961
We settled in Bombay.

1288
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:37,331
Why are you laughing?

1289
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:40,896
Read it yourself.

1290
01:32:41,872 --> 01:32:44,500
Bloody love letter!

1291
01:32:45,109 --> 01:32:47,543
Prabha, my mother is no more.

1292
01:32:52,783 --> 01:32:55,877
Uncle is going to Bombay for livelihood.

1293
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:57,712
I'm also going with him.

1294
01:32:59,023 --> 01:33:04,188
I'll let you know the address
after reaching there.

1295
01:33:05,129 --> 01:33:08,223
Are you fine? Anandhi.

1296
01:33:11,736 --> 01:33:14,728
<i>Gone? Rs.1800 gone down the drain?</i>

1297
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:19,738
<i>Neither you enjoyed it nor me,
some postman will enjoy it.</i>

1298
01:33:19,977 --> 01:33:24,038
<i>You'll do anything for girls,
did you buy me at least a drink?</i>

1299
01:33:24,248 --> 01:33:24,976
Go man!

1300
01:33:25,516 --> 01:33:30,510
Anandhi...neem tree...
castor oil...bloody shit!

1301
01:33:31,822 --> 01:33:32,618
Leave it buddy!

1302
01:33:33,057 --> 01:33:35,958
Leave it?
Do you know what Bombay means?

1303
01:33:36,427 --> 01:33:37,826
Do you know about men there?

1304
01:33:38,496 --> 01:33:40,191
Do you know what dating means?

1305
01:33:41,098 --> 01:33:44,158
By now someone else would
be dating your Anadhi.

1306
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,495
Don't talk rubbish!

1307
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,968
Who will come to a man who says he
doesn't remember growing a moustache?

1308
01:33:49,173 --> 01:33:51,607
If you'd trapped an aunty,
everything would've gone well.

1309
01:33:52,176 --> 01:33:56,078
No...no...no...

1310
01:34:02,953 --> 01:34:09,256
- Sorry man...it was by mistake...
- Enough of the stick I had from you.

1311
01:34:09,693 --> 01:34:13,925
I beg you, never ever come
into my life again.

1312
01:34:14,198 --> 01:34:17,326
Please, don't come.

1313
01:34:17,535 --> 01:34:21,904
- Don't come. Leave me.
- I did it by mistake.

1314
01:34:22,106 --> 01:34:24,904
- I'll buy you a drink.
- I don't want.

1315
01:34:25,109 --> 01:34:26,838
I don't want...you beat me
for a girl. Go!

1316
01:35:08,919 --> 01:35:09,613
Light tea.

1317
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:20,988
Yeah! How can I help you?

1318
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:24,331
- Take your seat.
- Thank you.

1319
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,939
Mr. Anantharangan, a guest for you.
Yeah.

1320
01:35:38,115 --> 01:35:39,582
I invited for fun,
but he took it serious.

1321
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:41,811
Hey Prabha, come in.

1322
01:35:42,553 --> 01:35:44,885
I didn't expect your office
to be so big...

1323
01:35:45,055 --> 01:35:46,818
- Sorry, I'm wearing yesterday's dress...
- Cool man.

1324
01:35:53,397 --> 01:35:54,193
Have it.

1325
01:36:00,404 --> 01:36:03,703
- Rahul, get me a burger dude.
- Okay dude. -Thanks da!

1326
01:36:05,743 --> 01:36:07,643
Today also again curd rice only.

1327
01:36:08,412 --> 01:36:11,279
- Today also to mess?
- Yes madam.

1328
01:36:17,988 --> 01:36:20,115
Just a minute.
I've to forward a mail, okay?

1329
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:22,890
What are you doing now?

1330
01:36:23,827 --> 01:36:25,522
I'm a Tamil teacher now.

1331
01:36:25,729 --> 01:36:29,392
Oh great! I never believed
you'll get a job.

1332
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,926
I thought how can you
get a job studying Tamil.

1333
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:33,727
But for your caliber, you'll get it.

1334
01:36:35,773 --> 01:36:37,070
- You...?
- Just a minute.

1335
01:36:37,341 --> 01:36:40,071
- Give this to David. Okay?
- Okay.

1336
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,648
- What's your salary?
- Rs.2000. - Good...good.

1337
01:36:44,848 --> 01:36:48,909
- If I finish B.Ed in 2 years,
I'll get Rs. 4000.- Nice...nice.

1338
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:51,044
You...?

1339
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:53,353
I was working with BCS London,

1340
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:54,785
now I shifted to Madras,

1341
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,160
this is a small company
but salary is good.

1342
01:36:58,195 --> 01:36:58,889
How much?

1343
01:36:59,463 --> 01:37:00,259
Just 2!

1344
01:37:01,432 --> 01:37:02,228
2 means...?

1345
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:03,430
200 thousands!

1346
01:37:03,767 --> 01:37:09,137
How could a man like you
get Rs.200 thousands?

1347
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:14,500
That too in Chennai...
I'm not so foolish.

1348
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,005
I know you're lying, for my sake.

1349
01:37:17,214 --> 01:37:18,613
So blatantly lying!

1350
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,649
Can I show you my salary slip?

1351
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:22,780
I don't believe you, one second.

1352
01:37:22,987 --> 01:37:26,445
Sir, one second, we both studied
together for 3 years,

1353
01:37:26,657 --> 01:37:27,521
we were room mates too,

1354
01:37:27,725 --> 01:37:30,285
his English is broken,
Tamil knowledge is zero,

1355
01:37:30,494 --> 01:37:32,462
I taught him English to
attend campus interview,

1356
01:37:32,663 --> 01:37:34,597
Listen...this is office!

1357
01:37:36,233 --> 01:37:37,222
Sorry...sorry...

1358
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,728
I couldn't believe it.
Call your boss...call your MD.

1359
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,567
He's not here, he stays in USA.

1360
01:37:44,808 --> 01:37:48,209
In USA? There's a limit for everything.

1361
01:37:48,412 --> 01:37:52,041
Such a big office, AC...computers...

1362
01:37:52,249 --> 01:37:54,444
Hey one minute...
Prabha, cool down...

1363
01:37:54,652 --> 01:37:57,450
- Hello madam, where's your MD?
- Listen to me, Prabha.

1364
01:37:57,655 --> 01:37:59,589
- Where's your MD?
- America.

1365
01:38:01,325 --> 01:38:05,762
States...? America...?
I can't believe it...

1366
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:07,396
Sir, please carry on your work.

1367
01:38:11,268 --> 01:38:15,534
How is it possible? Such a big office

You're astonished for this, look there!

She's getting Rs.300 thousands salary.

1372

I'm itching to get to her place,

1373
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:27,814
Touch me here if you dare!

1374
01:38:28,018 --> 01:38:30,350
Can we write anything if we
get 300 thousand salary?

1375
01:38:30,554 --> 01:38:32,886
- What's written there?
- Still your English is mediocre!

1376
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:34,455
Look there, read it!

1377
01:38:34,658 --> 01:38:36,751
- Touch me here if you dare!
- Touch me here if you dare!

1378
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:37,984
Do you know the meaning of it?

1379
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:40,763
Can she dare go outwith touch me
here if you dare in Tamil?

1380
01:38:40,964 --> 01:38:43,159
She likes it, she's wearing it,
why are you getting disturbed?

1381
01:38:43,367 --> 01:38:44,925
I'm getting disturbed!

1382
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:51,030
What can I do?
I'm getting disturbed.

1383
01:38:52,142 --> 01:38:53,302
Hi...forward it, okay?

1384
01:38:55,813 --> 01:38:57,280
What is this?

01:38:57,481 --> 01:38:59,608
Touch me here if you dare!

1386
01:39:02,052 --> 01:39:04,111

1387
01:39:06,156 --> 01:39:07,214
I dare!

1388
01:39:15,766 --> 01:39:17,063
- Sorry!
- You rascal!

1389
01:39:17,768 --> 01:39:20,328
I allowed you inside,
I must kick myself!

1390
01:39:23,574 --> 01:39:27,510
- Get lost bloody bastard!
- I did it unwittingly.

1391
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:35,643
What happened to my common sense?

1392
01:39:35,853 --> 01:39:37,081
What ever she may wear?

1393
01:39:37,287 --> 01:39:41,951
My sense...these hands...

1394
01:39:42,626 --> 01:39:44,025
A Tamil student...

1395
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:48,554
...how could he behave so atrociously?

1396
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,271
What's that noise?

1397
01:39:59,209 --> 01:40:00,176
Nothing...

1398
01:40:00,477 --> 01:40:04,413
Suryanarana is waiting with a full bottle
on terrace for you to open it.

1399
01:40:04,615 --> 01:40:05,547
You're still here.

1400
01:40:06,049 --> 01:40:06,743
Come.

1401
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:09,314
- You go, I'll come.
- Come immediately.

1402
01:40:13,891 --> 01:40:15,017
How long you take to come!

1403
01:40:15,225 --> 01:40:18,217
A full bottle of whisky for you,
a mega Pepsi,

1404
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:21,364
plus a full tandoori chicken!

1405
01:40:21,565 --> 01:40:23,362
Wait, a pack of cigarettes!

1406
01:40:23,567 --> 01:40:26,092
Totally I shelled out Rs. <i>788</i> and 50 paise.

1407
01:40:26,303 --> 01:40:27,270
All for you!

1408
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:28,870
But you don't drink.

1409
01:40:29,072 --> 01:40:30,972
- Will you've at least Pepsi?
- Leave him.

1410
01:40:31,175 --> 01:40:33,700
What were you doing behind
the closed door for an hour?

1411
01:40:34,244 --> 01:40:36,872
Has Gopal's habit spread to you also?

1412
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:42,013
Why are you worried about my habits?

1413
01:40:42,186 --> 01:40:43,153
You want me to open
the bottle or break it?

1414
01:40:43,353 --> 01:40:44,285
- Fast...fast.
- Why?

1415
01:40:44,488 --> 01:40:45,580
Wait...wait...

1416
01:40:51,361 --> 01:40:53,488
- Oh God!
- Atrocious!

1417
01:40:55,165 --> 01:40:57,759
- Thenmozhi!
- Why a party now?

1418
01:40:57,968 --> 01:40:59,435
You wrote a love letter for me, right?

1419
01:41:00,204 --> 01:41:02,672
It has worked out well,
Thenmozhi took off.

1420
01:41:03,841 --> 01:41:04,637
What does it mean?

1421
01:41:04,842 --> 01:41:07,367
You don't know, look at him boys!

1422
01:41:07,778 --> 01:41:13,080
In your chaste Tamil,
flying, flight, soar high! Got me?

1423
01:41:13,283 --> 01:41:17,014
- Stop Tamil lessons, open the packet.
- Open it.- I'm opening it.

1424
01:41:18,722 --> 01:41:19,313
Okay...

1425
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,856
<i>- A peg for me too...
- Are you serious, Prabha?</i>

1426
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:29,529
<i>Gopal, make a drink for Prabha first.</i>

1427
01:41:29,733 --> 01:41:33,760
<i>- Very good Prabha, now you're
a real mansion inmate.- Take it.</i>

1428
01:41:33,971 --> 01:41:40,206
<i>The success of my letter lifted my hopes
that Anandhi will come back to me.</i>

1429
01:41:41,979 --> 01:41:43,446
When are you getting married?

1430
01:41:46,416 --> 01:41:50,182
You're talking about marriage drinking
from a use <i>&</i> throw away glass.

1431
01:41:51,655 --> 01:41:55,682
This week one letter,
a Thenmozhi and a party!

1432
01:41:55,893 --> 01:41:59,226
Next week another letter,
you're here to write it for me.

1433
01:41:59,496 --> 01:42:03,159
<i>Write it in more chaste Tamil,
my moon...</i>

1434
01:42:03,433 --> 01:42:06,129
<i>I'll throw a bigger party
than now, got me!</i>

1435
01:42:11,008 --> 01:42:14,205
He has started drinking
raw straight away.

1436
01:42:16,113 --> 01:42:17,774
<i>He's very fast!</i>

1437
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:23,152
<i>You passed the test with
ﬂying colours! Super!</i>

1438
01:42:25,689 --> 01:42:27,520
<i>Where are you going?
He may fall down.</i>

1439
01:42:28,025 --> 01:42:29,549
<i>He may throw up!</i>

1440
01:42:34,698 --> 01:42:39,795
<i>I regretted for writing a letter to someone
what I thought of writing to Anandhi.</i>

1441
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:43,603
<i>Like</i> Kanakasabapathy said
this city has changed.

1442
01:42:44,107 --> 01:42:45,438
<i>If Chennai is like this,</i>

1443
01:42:45,709 --> 01:42:49,338
<i>I felt Anandhi's Bombay
would be much worse.</i>

1444
01:42:49,613 --> 01:42:53,276
<i>I started losing hope of Anandhi
coming back to me.</i>

1445
01:43:11,335 --> 01:43:13,326
<i>What are you doing man?
Are you sick or what?</i>

1446
01:43:13,904 --> 01:43:15,872
<i>Wait man...</i>

1447
01:43:17,908 --> 01:43:20,536
<i>- Come out man...come out!
- What do you want man?</i>

1448
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:24,042
<i>- Just stay away...what's the problem?
- Won't you listen to me?</i>

1449
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:30,712
- Come out man!
- Leave me.

1450
01:43:31,855 --> 01:43:33,117
Are you great if you travel in a car?

1451
01:43:33,924 --> 01:43:34,618
Will you splash slush?

1452
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,259
Will you splash slush on
anyone if you go in a car?

1453
01:43:37,995 --> 01:43:38,757
- No sir...
-What sir?

1454
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:39,951
Can't you see this is slush?

1455
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,691
Isn't this slush to you?

1456
01:43:47,004 --> 01:43:52,169
<i>Sir...look there...I didn't splash
slush on you sir...</i>

1457
01:43:52,509 --> 01:43:53,874
<i>He left the place.</i>

1458
01:43:54,544 --> 01:43:57,570
<i>Sir...it was not my fault sir.</i>

1459
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:14,995
Come here!

1460
01:44:16,533 --> 01:44:18,330
- Come here!
- No sir.

1461
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:20,864
I don't have anyone to talk to.

1462
01:44:21,371 --> 01:44:24,465
Talk to me for 5 minutes
and then go.

1463
01:44:25,642 --> 01:44:30,238
Take this sir, purse, mobile,
Rs. 5000 sir. Rs.5000 sir!

1464
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:34,116
Do I look like a goon?

1465
01:44:34,484 --> 01:44:35,416
Do I look like a goon?

1466
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:37,251
Did I ask you for money?

1467
01:44:37,487 --> 01:44:40,320
- Sir...
- What did I ask you?

1468
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:43,182
I wanted you to talk to me for 5 minutes.

1469
01:44:43,894 --> 01:44:46,727
- Will you?
- Yes sir.

1470
01:44:46,930 --> 01:44:47,658
Sit down.

1471
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:48,796
No. It's alright.

1472
01:44:48,999 --> 01:44:51,297
Since you own a car,
won't you sit on a platform?

1473
01:44:51,768 --> 01:44:54,066
I will Sit.

1474
01:44:56,173 --> 01:44:56,730
Sorry.

1475
01:44:57,441 --> 01:44:58,669
I am going to beat you.

1476
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:04,044
I wanted to talk to you for 5 minutes.

1477
01:45:05,582 --> 01:45:08,380
I got frustrated when you
offered me money.

1478
01:45:09,786 --> 01:45:11,344
- What is your name?
- No, sir.

1479
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:14,183
- Your name?
- Kaushik.

1480
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:17,358
Where are you working?

1481
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:18,755
- BPO.
- What does that mean?

1482
01:45:18,962 --> 01:45:20,327
- Call center, sir.
- What does that mean?

1483
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:21,963
I will get calls from America.

1484
01:45:22,365 --> 01:45:22,888
My job is to answer those calls.

1485
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,125
Why should they call you from America?

1486
01:45:25,368 --> 01:45:26,494
Now that is the trend.

1487
01:45:26,703 --> 01:45:29,331
Americans make calls to
the companies in America.

1488
01:45:29,539 --> 01:45:31,063
Those calls are diverted here.

1489
01:45:31,274 --> 01:45:32,673
<i>I must answer them.</i>

1490
01:45:34,644 --> 01:45:36,544
What will you speak?

1491
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:39,545
- No sir.
- Tell me. What will you speak?

1492
01:45:40,217 --> 01:45:41,514
Thanks for calling Jonix...

1493
01:45:41,718 --> 01:45:42,446
This is Thomas here.

1494
01:45:42,652 --> 01:45:44,347
Could I have first & last name please?

1495
01:45:44,554 --> 01:45:45,782
How can you help you sir?

1496
01:45:46,256 --> 01:45:47,314
It's nice.

1497
01:45:47,557 --> 01:45:48,319
English.

1498
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:51,355
How do you greet them?

1499
01:45:51,561 --> 01:45:52,687
Thanks for calling..

1500
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,329
Thanks for calling Jonix...

1501
01:45:54,564 --> 01:45:55,030
I am Thomas here.

1502
01:45:55,232 --> 01:45:57,632
- What's your name?
- Kaushik, sir.

1503
01:45:57,834 --> 01:45:59,426
Then, who is Thomas?

1504
01:45:59,636 --> 01:46:01,797
Since the calls are from America,

1505
01:46:02,005 --> 01:46:04,064
callers shouldn't know that their calls
are answered from India.

1506
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:07,141
Since we answer them
like Americans,

1507
01:46:07,344 --> 01:46:09,505
they changed my name as Thomas.

1508
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:10,576
What's your salary?

1509
01:46:10,914 --> 01:46:12,074
- Rs. 40000.
- Rs. 40000...?

1510
01:46:12,282 --> 01:46:15,581
Will you change your
name for Rs. 40000?

1511
01:46:16,419 --> 01:46:18,512
Will you change your mother
for Rs. 400 thousands?

1512
01:46:18,955 --> 01:46:19,853
Not like that.

1513
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:22,224
But that is how I work.

1514
01:46:22,425 --> 01:46:23,653
It's good.

1515
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:24,326
How's that...

1516
01:46:24,528 --> 01:46:25,722
Thanks for calling Jonix...

1517
01:46:25,929 --> 01:46:26,486
This is Thomas here.

1518
01:46:26,696 --> 01:46:28,493
Could I have first & last name please?

1519
01:46:28,698 --> 01:46:29,926
How can I help you, sir?

1520
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,166
How was my accent?

1521
01:46:31,368 --> 01:46:33,859
Just like an American.

1522
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:39,006
I repeated what you spoke.

1523
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:42,673
Now you speak what I tell you to speak.

1524
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:45,410
- Will you speak?
- Yes sir.

1525
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,477
- Your mother tongue is Tamil, right?
- Yes sir.

1526
01:48:12,869 --> 01:48:13,392
Repeat this.

1527
01:48:13,703 --> 01:48:16,433
C'mon say it. Say it.

1528
01:48:16,773 --> 01:48:17,671
It sounds like Tamil.

1529
01:48:17,874 --> 01:48:20,775
Does this sound like Tamil?

1530
01:48:21,311 --> 01:48:24,109
You speak in American
accent for Rs. 40000.

1531
01:48:24,314 --> 01:48:26,874
You live here for the last 25 years.

1532
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:29,449
But you don't know Bharathi's song.

1533
01:48:29,653 --> 01:48:31,177
You said you will not beat me.

1534
01:48:31,454 --> 01:48:32,978
Sorry.

1535
01:48:33,723 --> 01:48:35,816
Do you know Anantharangan?

1536
01:48:36,092 --> 01:48:38,026
- I don't know.
- Leave it.

1537
01:48:38,228 --> 01:48:40,287
He is also an idiot like you.

1538
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:43,697
I get paid Rs.2000 for learning
the age old Tamil language.

1539
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,925
But the box which was
invented 25 years ago...

1540
01:48:46,136 --> 01:48:47,899
- Box...?
- I mean the computer.

1541
01:48:48,104 --> 01:48:49,731
He who knows to operate it
earns Rs. 200 thousands a month.

1542
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,237
How is it possible?

1543
01:48:51,841 --> 01:48:56,141
- What can I do about it?
- Did I ask you to say anything?

1544
01:48:56,446 --> 01:49:00,348
I just want to speak with
you for 5 minutes...

1545
01:49:05,422 --> 01:49:08,220
Come. I won't beat you.

1546
01:49:11,261 --> 01:49:12,023
Come.

1547
01:50:01,478 --> 01:50:04,379
Boy...wake up.

1548
01:50:08,752 --> 01:50:10,049
<i>Business today will not be good.</i>

1549
01:50:11,221 --> 01:50:13,121
The first cigarette which <i>I</i> smoke.

1550
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:14,750
<i>A cigarette half burnt.</i>

1551
01:50:15,225 --> 01:50:17,716
Someone <i>might</i> have smoked it.

1552
01:50:20,330 --> 01:50:21,991
<i>I</i> started to smoke more.

1553
01:50:22,265 --> 01:50:23,789
<i>For smoking a cigarette,</i>

1554
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:26,533
<i>I</i> was made to sit with my underwear
in the police station.

1555
01:50:26,736 --> 01:50:27,760
<i>I felt humiliated.</i>

1556
01:50:28,004 --> 01:50:29,801
<i>I was sitting there like
a piece of shit.</i>

1557
01:50:30,273 --> 01:50:31,365
<i>Once I've become a piece of shit,</i>

1558
01:50:31,674 --> 01:50:33,335
<i>I didn't want to live.</i>

1559
01:50:33,676 --> 01:50:35,871
<i>I</i> wrote a letter mentioning
all the reasons for my suicide,

1560
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:41,142
<i>to Anandhi who I know
will never come.</i>

1561
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:44,684
<i>Before jumping, I forgot to
check if there's power,</i>

1562
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,287
<i>so, I didn't die.</i>

1563
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:49,719
<i>Instead I got the job of
giving salvation to others.</i>

1564
01:50:50,093 --> 01:50:51,355
<i>On that day I didn't kill one,</i>

1565
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:52,255
<i>..but a thousand.</i>

1566
01:50:52,462 --> 01:50:55,260
<i>Anantharangan, Suryanarayanan
and many more.</i>

1567
01:50:55,465 --> 01:50:57,729
<i>I didn't mean I got hold of their necks..</i>

1568
01:50:57,934 --> 01:51:01,267
<i>But when the first drop of blood
fell on my hand,</i>

1569
01:51:01,704 --> 01:51:04,605
<i>I</i> realised that I'd changed
into someone else.

1570
01:51:04,874 --> 01:51:06,865
<i>First time I felt like an almighty.</i>

1571
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:11,112
<i>I felt as if the entire world
was under my feet.</i>

1572
01:51:12,215 --> 01:51:14,342
<i>This world turned me
into a piece of shit.</i>

1573
01:51:14,551 --> 01:51:17,645
But the one drop of blood
made me God.

1574
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:26,592
<i>After that,</i>

1575
01:51:26,996 --> 01:51:31,763
<i>I wandered all over India
like a nomad.</i>

1576
01:51:32,302 --> 01:51:33,200
<i>I grew beard.</i>

1577
01:51:33,403 --> 01:51:34,563
Met sages.

1578
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:35,601
<i>Had drugs.</i>

1579
01:51:35,805 --> 01:51:37,670
<i>And came back to Chennai again.</i>

1580
01:51:46,916 --> 01:51:50,317
<i>There is no street which
I've not walked through.</i>

1581
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:53,021
<i>I wonder what had happened to me.</i>

1582
01:51:54,257 --> 01:51:56,691
<i>I killed 22 people.</i>

1583
01:51:56,926 --> 01:51:59,554
What 22 <i>&</i> 23?

1584
01:51:59,762 --> 01:52:01,730
You had a tiff at a Railway counter.

1585
01:52:01,931 --> 01:52:04,024
It was an accident not a murder.

1586
01:52:04,601 --> 01:52:07,229
The one on the train was
running bad patch.

1587
01:52:07,437 --> 01:52:09,632
He was drunk.
So, you are not at fault.

1588
01:52:10,273 --> 01:52:12,833
But you keep on saying the
number of people you killed.

1589
01:52:13,476 --> 01:52:15,239
Don't you need a reason
to kill so many people.

1590
01:52:15,678 --> 01:52:18,340
Only stories need a reason.

1591
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:23,475
There are no logics and
reasons for real life.

1592
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,850
There are no logics and
reasons for real life.

1593
01:52:28,124 --> 01:52:28,749
I will tell you.

1594
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,589
<i>On a fine sunny day...</i>

1595
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:34,424
<i>Beach.</i>

1596
01:52:38,168 --> 01:52:39,601
When did you get married?

1597
01:52:39,802 --> 01:52:40,996
At the age of 23.

1598
01:52:41,204 --> 01:52:42,034
How many children?

1599
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:46,072
2 kids, carrying one now.
I'm king in that. Happy sir.

1600
01:52:46,543 --> 01:52:47,908
Can you guess my age?

1601
01:52:48,311 --> 01:52:50,677
How can I guess when you
are covered with beard?

1602
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,108
I'm 26 years old.

1603
01:52:52,749 --> 01:52:56,776
I never had sex with
any girl till now.

1604
01:52:56,986 --> 01:52:58,544
How long can I masturbate
in bathroom?

1605
01:52:59,255 --> 01:53:00,222
<i>If I go to beach,</i>

1606
01:53:00,490 --> 01:53:02,617
<i>I see people sitting in
the hot sun.</i>

1607
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:18,106
On that day, the temperature
was 2 degree more.

1608
01:53:19,242 --> 01:53:21,142
It was unbearable heat.

1609
01:53:25,548 --> 01:53:27,778
I took the gun & shot them.

1610
01:53:31,254 --> 01:53:33,085
<i>Coconut, mango, cereals.</i>

1611
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:35,182
<i>They are making this beach
into their bedroom.</i>

1612
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:36,688
<i>Coconut, mango, cereals.</i>

1613
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:39,259
<i>Am I responsible for
the hot sun?</i>

1614
01:53:39,562 --> 01:53:41,587
<i>Am I responsible for the hole
in the ozone layer?</i>

1615
01:53:41,931 --> 01:53:44,229
<i>There is no girl in my life.
Am I responsible for that?</i>

1616
01:53:44,534 --> 01:53:46,798
Am I responsible for the
rich to hire prostitutes?

1617
01:53:47,604 --> 01:53:51,267
Am I responsible for Anandhi
to go away from my life?

1618
01:53:52,575 --> 01:53:55,373
Thank God! You didn't go to
the beach last month.

1619
01:53:55,612 --> 01:53:56,476
What did you say?

1620
01:53:57,647 --> 01:54:01,981
Battery charge is too low.
Make it fast.

1621
01:54:02,619 --> 01:54:04,644
You don't need reasons to kill.

1622
01:54:06,289 --> 01:54:08,052
Killing someone is very simple.

1623
01:54:08,391 --> 01:54:09,187
Like an art.

1624
01:54:09,392 --> 01:54:13,021
The beast is boasting with
his English knowledge.

1625
01:54:13,229 --> 01:54:15,129
Highly creative process.

1626
01:54:15,331 --> 01:54:17,265
Something like an intercourse.

1627
01:54:18,801 --> 01:54:19,893
When I kill,

1628
01:54:20,403 --> 01:54:24,203
the gun, my finger & the blood..

1629
01:54:24,841 --> 01:54:26,035
...when it falls on the hand,

1630
01:54:26,409 --> 01:54:29,310
...you experience the ecstasy.

1631
01:54:29,746 --> 01:54:35,378
But when we open our
eyes & see...Shit!

1632
01:54:36,686 --> 01:54:40,747
It's really painful.

1633
01:54:41,424 --> 01:54:45,986
When we fail in our exams,
we decide to pass the next time.

1634
01:54:46,195 --> 01:54:48,493
Similarly, after every murder,

1635
01:54:48,931 --> 01:54:51,161
<i>I decide not to commit
another one.</i>

1636
01:54:51,367 --> 01:54:56,464
But this hand starts to shiver.

1637
01:54:56,773 --> 01:55:00,402
I hear a loud noise in my head.

1638
01:55:00,843 --> 01:55:03,573
These symptoms say that
lam going to do something.

1639
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:11,249
I don't go out during the day.
I stay inside these four walls.

1640
01:55:13,056 --> 01:55:14,648
I go out only at night.

1641
01:55:14,857 --> 01:55:20,454
Last month, I started to shiver.

1642
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:24,031
<i>I heard this loud noise
in my head.</i>

1643
01:55:24,467 --> 01:55:27,664
<i>I felt I will go out and
do something nasty.</i>

1644
01:55:29,472 --> 01:55:30,939
<i>I stayed inside the room.</i>

1645
01:55:31,741 --> 01:55:34,369
<i>I was trying my level best
to stay inside the room.</i>

1646
01:55:36,512 --> 01:55:38,173
<i>My heart told me to go out.</i>

1647
01:55:38,381 --> 01:55:42,442
<i>But I still controlled myself.
I was trying to control it.</i>

1648
01:55:42,985 --> 01:55:48,480
<i>But on that day,
it was beyond my control.</i>

1649
01:55:56,232 --> 01:56:00,032
<i>Then, I went to open the door.</i>

1650
01:56:01,104 --> 01:56:04,369
<i>The noise stopped.</i>

1651
01:56:05,875 --> 01:56:10,335
<i>I feared that it shouldn't
come again.</i>

1652
01:56:22,425 --> 01:56:26,020
<i>I understood that! can
never be controlled.</i>

1653
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:28,891
<i>I will be a danger to the public.</i>

1654
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:31,029
<i>So, I ran to a police station.</i>

1655
01:56:31,267 --> 01:56:32,199
<i>The only police station I knew..</i>

1656
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:35,098
...was the one where <i>I</i> was made
to sit with my underwear.

1657
01:56:35,605 --> 01:56:37,835
<i>On the way I saw him.</i>

1658
01:56:49,252 --> 01:56:51,186
Hey, why did you keep
the phone outside?

1659
01:56:51,387 --> 01:56:52,183
Keep it inside.

1660
01:56:52,388 --> 01:57:01,763
<i>Honorable souls die when disgraced
rather than live with it.</i>

1661
01:57:11,574 --> 01:57:15,772
I realised that he was
responsible for everything.

1662
01:57:17,814 --> 01:57:19,406
I killed many.

1663
01:57:19,982 --> 01:57:22,780
If I had killed him,
everything would've been alright.

1664
01:57:23,286 --> 01:57:24,776
He was the medicine I needed.

1665
01:57:25,588 --> 01:57:28,421
<i>But killing a police Inspector
is not an easy task.</i>

1666
01:57:30,359 --> 01:57:31,348
<i>So, I planned it.</i>

1667
01:57:32,028 --> 01:57:35,054
<i>I followed him for a week.</i>

1668
01:57:35,331 --> 01:57:39,165
<i>Then I found out that after closing
all the bars in the city,</i>

1669
01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:44,429
<i>he opens a bar in Trustpuram
inside his jeep & has fun.</i>

1670
01:58:31,554 --> 01:58:37,515
Honorable souls die when disgraced
rather than live with it.

1671
01:58:42,832 --> 01:58:45,630
<i>I felt as if all my anger is gone.</i>

1672
01:58:45,835 --> 01:58:47,393
<i>I felt very peaceful.</i>

1673
01:58:48,237 --> 01:58:52,071
<i>I thought I will never get
those killing instincts.</i>

1674
01:58:55,411 --> 01:58:59,142
<i>That noise..that cry..
..disturbed me.</i>

1675
01:58:59,749 --> 01:59:00,773
<i>I committed many murders.</i>

1676
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:04,814
<i>But I've done nothing
good for anyone.</i>

1677
01:59:05,888 --> 01:59:09,654
<i>My conscious wanted me to
do good for someone.</i>

1678
01:59:09,859 --> 01:59:11,019
Hey Aadhi, look who is coming in.

1679
01:59:11,227 --> 01:59:12,455
Hey, who are you?

1680
01:59:51,067 --> 01:59:51,897
Hey, who are you?

1681
01:59:52,935 --> 01:59:54,061
Hey, who are you?

1682
01:59:55,104 --> 01:59:55,866
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

1683
01:59:56,405 --> 01:59:57,064
Who are you?

1684
01:59:57,273 --> 01:59:57,830
Hey...

1685
01:59:58,074 --> 01:59:58,540
Why did you beat her?

1686
01:59:58,774 --> 02:00:00,742
I paid Rs 4000. I'll do whatever I wish.
Shut up and get lost!

1687
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:08,209
Don't beat me!

1688
02:00:09,952 --> 02:00:15,185
<i>Sir, won't it be painful if you see
your angel in a whore house?</i>

1689
02:00:36,178 --> 02:00:36,803
...Prabha...

1690
02:00:39,649 --> 02:00:41,879
What are you looking at?
Get out...

1691
02:00:42,451 --> 02:00:44,248
I say get out...

1692
02:00:54,964 --> 02:00:56,591
If you pay Rs 4000, does it mean
you can do any bullshit?

1693
02:00:58,968 --> 02:01:01,198
She will also have the same pain
as you have, won't she?

1694
02:01:02,972 --> 02:01:04,098
Everybody has same
color of blood, right?

1695
02:01:05,841 --> 02:01:07,035
She too has the same flesh, right?

1696
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:16,784
Now watch...

1697
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:40,033
First leave this place..

1698
02:01:56,559 --> 02:01:58,390
You come with me..

1699
02:01:59,962 --> 02:02:01,725
Really saying this?

1700
02:02:04,734 --> 02:02:06,497
Really saying this?

1701
02:02:06,702 --> 02:02:08,169
Really saying this?

1702
02:02:08,871 --> 02:02:10,361
Really saying this?

1703
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:12,165
Really saying this?

1704
02:02:13,576 --> 02:02:24,145
<i>On hearing this the boy Prabha lost in the
mayhem of death has come back again.</i>

1705
02:02:24,587 --> 02:02:28,421
<i>We both decided to settle down
in our favourite place.</i>

1706
02:02:28,657 --> 02:02:33,959
But before leaving the place,
<i>I</i> wanted to repent for my sins.

1707
02:02:34,396 --> 02:02:36,694
<i>Leaving Anandhi in a ladies hostel,</i>

1708
02:02:37,399 --> 02:02:39,230
<i>I was thinking about my next step...</i>

1709
02:02:39,902 --> 02:02:41,233
<i>I saw your media van...</i>

1710
02:02:41,904 --> 02:02:44,168
<i>I offered Rs 10000,
and you accepted it.</i>

1711
02:02:45,274 --> 02:02:46,468
<i>You're recording it now.</i>

1712
02:02:47,276 --> 02:02:48,573
<i>What grievous crime you've committed?</i>

1713
02:02:48,778 --> 02:02:49,574
Recording it.

1714
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:53,078
Even my neighbour makes Rs 30000.
I feel jealous of him.

1715
02:02:53,282 --> 02:02:54,374
He got a new Pulsar bike.

1716
02:02:54,583 --> 02:02:56,915
I dropped 1/2 kg sugar in fuel tank
when nobody is around.

1717
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:58,143
This is what I am!

1718
02:02:58,354 --> 02:02:59,116
Sir, when you don't have money...

1719
02:02:59,321 --> 02:03:02,381
If you find some wearing expensive dresses,
goggles and a beautiful girl in tow,

1720
02:03:02,591 --> 02:03:03,649
One will get angry, sir.

1721
02:03:03,859 --> 02:03:06,487
What can we do for that?
I've a family and children.

1722
02:03:06,695 --> 02:03:07,662
I can't do anything.

1723
02:03:07,863 --> 02:03:09,387
You're alone,
so you killed them.

1724
02:03:09,598 --> 02:03:11,225
Why are you making a big fuss of it?

1725
02:03:11,667 --> 02:03:12,656
Everything is getting right
in your life now.

1726
02:03:12,868 --> 02:03:13,732
You got back your Anandhi.

1727
02:03:13,936 --> 02:03:15,335
What's the use of recording this now?
Let's stop it.

1728
02:03:15,538 --> 02:03:19,201
Hello, I called you to record it
not to advice.

1729
02:03:19,608 --> 02:03:20,336
Record it.

1730
02:03:22,878 --> 02:03:24,675
Sir, I just told as a friend...

1731
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:25,710
Sorry sir.

1732
02:03:26,115 --> 02:03:26,877
As you Say--

1733
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:30,077
Do you know why I'm telling all this?

1734
02:03:30,286 --> 02:03:32,618
I'm not trying to justify myself.

1735
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:34,847
I committed murders
knowingly and unknowingly...

1736
02:03:35,391 --> 02:03:37,689
If I tell police about my murders,
they won't believe me.

1737
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:38,754
Didn't understand?

1738
02:03:38,961 --> 02:03:39,757
Just hold on...

1739
02:03:50,339 --> 02:03:51,431
- Zoom it...
- Okay.

1740
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:53,665
Illicit love affair turns bizarre...

1741
02:03:53,876 --> 02:03:54,706
Do you know them?

1742
02:03:54,910 --> 02:03:56,468
The two people I killed on the beach.

1743
02:03:56,979 --> 02:03:58,606
It seems he's that lady's husband.

1744
02:03:58,814 --> 02:04:00,714
Since the lady had a paramour..

1745
02:04:00,916 --> 02:04:02,349
Her husband hired people
to kill them.

1746
02:04:02,551 --> 02:04:03,483
I killed them...

1747
02:04:03,686 --> 02:04:06,553
But they blamed some fool Balaganesh.

1748
02:04:06,856 --> 02:04:07,948
Wait...

1749
02:04:08,924 --> 02:04:09,948
Do you know him?

1750
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:12,525
Dr K.D.Nandu, a Psychiatrist,
from Ashok Pillar.

1751
02:04:12,728 --> 02:04:14,423
The man whose head I broke,
it's him.

1752
02:04:14,763 --> 02:04:17,459
It seems this man had killed him
in a real estate problem.

1753
02:04:17,666 --> 02:04:21,932
I killed him...
But Dr Kumar, a fool got caught.

1754
02:04:22,838 --> 02:04:25,807
In order to finish the monthly target,
police covered up everything.

1755
02:04:26,742 --> 02:04:29,506
Now if I surrender in police,
they will say I didn't kill them.

1756
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:31,577
If you ask me, I'll say,
I only did it.

1757
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:33,179
Did I kill them or not?

1758
02:04:33,682 --> 02:04:35,741
- Do you understand anything?
- No sir.

1759
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:37,450
I'm also not able to understand anything.

1760
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:40,079
Sir, I don't understand what's
going on in this city!

1761
02:04:40,356 --> 02:04:43,223
10 years ago, minimum salary
was Rs 2000.

1762
02:04:43,525 --> 02:04:45,390
Maximum would be around Rs 20000.

1763
02:04:45,594 --> 02:04:46,561
But now..

1764
02:04:46,762 --> 02:04:48,855
Minimum salary remains the same.

1765
02:04:49,064 --> 02:04:51,760
But maximum salary level has
crossed hundred thousands.

1766
02:04:52,234 --> 02:04:54,828
This city is changing for the high paid.

1767
02:04:55,037 --> 02:04:58,268
Sir, tell me, what's the population of this city?

1768
02:04:58,474 --> 02:05:00,669
Around 6 to 7 millions people.

1769
02:05:01,243 --> 02:05:02,870
Am I asking you census?

1770
02:05:03,112 --> 02:05:05,342
Sir, only 2 categories of people live here.

1771
02:05:05,547 --> 02:05:06,013
Didn't get me?

1772
02:05:06,215 --> 02:05:07,409
One, who is inside spencer's plaza...

1773
02:05:07,616 --> 02:05:08,878
another one who is outside it..

1774
02:05:09,084 --> 02:05:13,851
One inside Sathyam Theater one outside.
One inside a ATM and another outside.

1775
02:05:14,056 --> 02:05:14,954
We belong to second category.

1776
02:05:15,157 --> 02:05:24,122
Selling credit cards and savings schemes
to the rich calling them sir...!

1777
02:05:25,067 --> 02:05:29,367
I'm much better...l can lead my
life as a Tamil teacher!

1778
02:05:29,972 --> 02:05:32,702
But degree holders of History,
Geography, Sociology,

1779
02:05:32,908 --> 02:05:36,867
Psychology, Political science
and Economics are really pitiable.

1780
02:05:37,513 --> 02:05:39,708
They find it difficult to get
even a teacher's job.

1781
02:05:40,416 --> 02:05:41,383
You're right, sir.

1782
02:05:41,583 --> 02:05:50,218
Sir, is there any rule that only MBA, MCA,
Engineering and MBBS students,

1783
02:05:50,426 --> 02:05:51,222
should only lead a luxurious
and happy life?

1784
02:05:51,427 --> 02:05:52,724
Sir, I didn't say that Rs 2000
is insufficient for me.

1785
02:05:52,928 --> 02:05:54,555
Sir, I didn't say that I'm living
below the poverty line.

1786
02:05:54,763 --> 02:05:55,730
Sir, I'm not begging...

1787
02:05:56,098 --> 02:06:00,558
But I'm not able to bear the
atrocious behaviour of white collars.

1788
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:04,571
Poet Bharathi wished for a nation
where no man harms another man.

1789
02:06:04,773 --> 02:06:05,899
But that is only happening here.

1790
02:06:06,608 --> 02:06:10,237
They earn in millions...
They buy houses and cars...

1791
02:06:10,446 --> 02:06:14,246
They buy Rayban glasses..
They use expensive perfumes and shoes...

1792
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:17,078
- Don't you get disturbed or not?
- Will get disturbed, sir.

1793
02:06:17,953 --> 02:06:20,581
"Touch me here, if you dare"!
"Don't look at my face."

1794
02:06:20,789 --> 02:06:22,086
"Unbutton me here."

1795
02:06:22,291 --> 02:06:25,749
If girls' wear tops with such words...
That too on their chest.

1796
02:06:26,128 --> 02:06:31,088
Don't you feel like touching?

1797
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:31,925
Will feel like touching, sir.

1798
02:06:32,801 --> 02:06:38,433
Yes, don't think Tamil students
are saints and innocents.

1799
02:06:38,707 --> 02:06:45,772
Don't think they're fools in loose fit clothes
with bag, thickset glasses reciting poems.

1800
02:06:46,148 --> 02:06:53,953
Tamil not only teaches patience
but also teaches anger.

1801
02:06:54,490 --> 02:06:57,789
Poet Bharathidasan called
youth to learn to kill brutally.

1802
02:06:57,993 --> 02:07:01,622
Yes I did, off course I did
cold blooded murders.

1803
02:07:05,267 --> 02:07:08,464
By saying all these things,
I'm not trying to justify myself.

1804
02:07:08,937 --> 02:07:10,461
I'm not trying to justify myself.

1805
02:07:12,841 --> 02:07:14,308
I hate what all I did...
And I want to get out of it...

1806
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:15,477
As I wished, I escaped.

1807
02:07:15,944 --> 02:07:20,813
Because my Anandhi is back now.

1808
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:24,146
I went back to my childhood days...

1809
02:07:24,353 --> 02:07:28,483
an age that doesn't fear death.
We both are going..

1810
02:07:29,558 --> 02:07:31,389
In search of a happy life...

1811
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:33,327
We will lead a happy life.
We will lead a happy life...

1812
02:07:33,862 --> 02:07:38,162
Because we both are destined
to lead a happy life!

1813
02:07:38,801 --> 02:07:39,995
You will get it sir.

1814
02:07:41,370 --> 02:07:41,995
Thank you.

1815
02:07:43,472 --> 02:07:47,340
I don't know the solution to the
problem I discussed with you.

1816
02:07:48,377 --> 02:07:50,174
If I knew,
I wouldn't have become like this.

1817
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:55,346
I'm not sure if Ministers, CM or PM
knows a solution to this.

1818
02:07:55,818 --> 02:08:00,187
Maybe American President Bush
knows a solution.

1819
02:08:01,056 --> 02:08:04,514
We are so poor that we can't make
an ISD call to him also.

1820
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:07,358
We are helpless!
I've escaped!

1821
02:08:07,796 --> 02:08:15,532
But the city you live is very bad.

1822
02:08:17,072 --> 02:08:21,202
You can get killed for your pizza,
shoes or goggles.

1823
02:08:21,743 --> 02:08:22,539
They are killing people.

1824
02:08:23,745 --> 02:08:24,541
Got it.

1825
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:26,204
Beware of it.

1826
02:08:26,815 --> 02:08:28,043
That's it. Close it.

1827
02:08:29,017 --> 02:08:29,881
One minute.

1828
02:08:32,421 --> 02:08:37,051
The tears of have-nots is an army
that will wipe out haves.

1829
02:08:39,094 --> 02:08:43,326
The army that can destroy the rich

1830
02:08:44,166 --> 02:08:52,005
are the tears of those like me
who suffer & struggle in life. Got it.

1831
02:08:52,374 --> 02:08:53,068
Thank you.

1832
02:08:54,276 --> 02:08:55,243
Close it.

1833
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:10,016
Sir, you promised to pay
me Rs. 10000.

1834
02:09:15,063 --> 02:09:17,088
I don't want it, sir.

1835
02:09:26,875 --> 02:09:27,773
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1836
02:09:28,143 --> 02:09:30,771
Yuvan asked me to give this to Mr. Shocks.

1837
02:09:31,647 --> 02:09:33,274
- And you?
- My name is not important.

1838
02:09:33,649 --> 02:09:35,514
Everything is in the cassette.
Give it to him.

1839
02:09:48,330 --> 02:09:49,126
Prabha..

1840
02:09:53,502 --> 02:09:55,800
Are you worried for
taking me with you?

1841
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,637
Why don't you ask me something?

1842
02:10:02,244 --> 02:10:03,302
What should I ask?

1843
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:06,807
I struggled very hard
for the past 3 years.

1844
02:10:07,282 --> 02:10:11,150
Many things happened.
I want to tell you all that.

1845
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:16,821
Look, in my Anandhi's life,
nothing has happened.

1846
02:10:17,593 --> 02:10:19,823
Why ask or talk about things
which never happened?

1847
02:10:20,696 --> 02:10:23,995
It's been long since I slept at 10 pm.

1848
02:10:25,033 --> 02:10:29,663
Since you are with me,
I'm getting a good sleep.

1849
02:10:30,606 --> 02:10:33,666
You also sleep well. Okay.

1850
02:11:15,183 --> 02:11:15,877
Prabha..

1851
02:11:20,922 --> 02:11:21,547
What?

1852
02:11:21,757 --> 02:11:26,217
A man over there is staring at me.
Don't turn immediately.

1853
02:11:35,937 --> 02:11:36,733
Listen to me.

1854
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:41,068
- Keep quiet. No fight.
- You be quiet. I know what to do.

1855
02:11:46,948 --> 02:11:47,915
Move.

1856
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:49,848
Move I say.

1857
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:56,417
- Don't stare at her.
- Why not?

1858
02:11:58,627 --> 02:12:03,087
- Don't look at her.
- I went to her last week. Rs. 3000.

1859
02:12:03,465 --> 02:12:05,092
How much does it cost
to take her out?

1860
02:12:06,301 --> 02:12:09,429
- She is not like that now.
- Then, what is she now?

1861
02:12:10,972 --> 02:12:11,939
She is married.

1862
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:15,109
Married? When?

1863
02:12:16,478 --> 02:12:17,672
At the age of 7.

1864
02:12:26,388 --> 02:12:27,787
He won't stare at you anymore.
You sleep.

1865
02:12:28,724 --> 02:12:32,125
- What did you say?
- Leave it. You sleep.

1866
02:12:32,828 --> 02:12:34,455
Please tell me.
What did you tell him?

1867
02:12:36,832 --> 02:12:40,563
I said that we got married
at the age of 7. Sleep.

1868
02:12:58,687 --> 02:13:05,490
<i>Testimony of Mr. Prabhakar;</i>
<i>a post-graduate in Tami! literature"</i>

1869
02:13:05,761 --> 02:13:08,321
...which was telecast in our channel yesterday
has sparked many debates in the society.

1870
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:12,159
<i>He is right. I lived here in Vadapalani
2 years back. Rent was Rs. 2000.</i>

1871
02:13:12,367 --> 02:13:15,996
<i>The IT people entered. People working
in software companies earn in millions.</i>

1872
02:13:16,204 --> 02:13:17,933
<i>Rents skyrocketed.</i>

1873
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:20,665
<i>I couldn't afford these rents,
I shifted to outskirt Poonamalle.</i>

1874
02:13:20,876 --> 02:13:22,673
<i>IT companies are cropping up there also.</i>

1875
02:13:22,878 --> 02:13:25,346
<i>I don't know how am I going
to pay the rent & live.</i>

1876
02:13:25,547 --> 02:13:29,347
<i>If poor people don't have place in this city,
this is modern untouchability, what else then?</i>

1877
02:13:29,551 --> 02:13:33,180
<i>They're jealous. 10 years back minimum
salary was Rs. 2000. I accept.</i>

1878
02:13:33,388 --> 02:13:39,293
<i>10 years ago India's foreign exchange was
100 billions, now it is 827.2 billions.</i>

1879
02:13:39,494 --> 02:13:40,688
Just because of IT.

1880
02:13:40,896 --> 02:13:43,023
<i>It's a fie that country has</i>
<i>developed because of IT.</i>

1881
02:13:43,231 --> 02:13:45,859
<i>Very few have prospered.
Entire country hasn't developed.</i>

1882
02:13:46,067 --> 02:13:47,694
<i>Growth in a body must be full.</i>

1883
02:13:47,903 --> 02:13:51,202
<i>If our legs alone grow bigger,
it is Filaria. A disease.</i>

1884
02:13:51,406 --> 02:13:52,634
<i>What's your opinion on the
phrases on the T-shirt?</i>

1885
02:13:52,841 --> 02:13:54,706
<i>This is my T-shirt. It's my wish.
What bothers you?</i>

1886
02:13:54,910 --> 02:13:56,377
<i>People say that they are getting
disturbed by those phrases.</i>

1887
02:13:56,578 --> 02:13:57,704
<i>Won't you look at us if there
are no such words?</i>

1888
02:13:57,913 --> 02:14:00,040
Let there be phrases or not,
people will look at us.

1889
02:14:00,248 --> 02:14:02,375
<i>You are getting provoked by those liners
It's just a male ego.</i>

1890
02:14:02,584 --> 02:14:06,042
<i>Spencer Plaza & Pizza hut can't be
called as a country's growth.</i>

1891
02:14:06,254 --> 02:14:08,222
<i>It's a luxury provided for the rich.</i>

1892
02:14:08,423 --> 02:14:13,884
<i>Testimony given by Prabhakar is false.
He is mentally ill.</i>

1893
02:14:14,262 --> 02:14:18,995
<i>Police's job is to find him and
admit him in a hospital.</i>

1894
02:14:19,201 --> 02:14:21,897
<i>Police also feel pity on him.</i>

1895
02:14:22,604 --> 02:14:24,231
What he says is right.

1896
02:14:24,773 --> 02:14:26,900
Our head constable Sekar's son
is in America,

1897
02:14:27,108 --> 02:14:28,905
studied MCA & is earning
around 200 thousands.

1898
02:14:29,578 --> 02:14:34,015
But we take bribes from
everyone to earn Rs. 20000.

1899
02:14:34,449 --> 02:14:35,245
What next? Tell me.

1900
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:37,247
His birth place is Achchankoil, Kerala.

1901
02:14:37,452 --> 02:14:39,920
Schooling in Ambasamudram.
College in Palayamkotai, Tirunelveli.

1902
02:14:40,121 --> 02:14:40,917
Just a minute.

1903
02:14:41,556 --> 02:14:44,354
A case was filed against him
for an attempt to commit suicide.

1904
02:14:44,793 --> 02:14:47,591
The railway station murder is
still under investigation.

1905
02:14:47,863 --> 02:14:49,262
We got only these 2 cassettes.

1906
02:14:49,464 --> 02:14:52,592
Excuse me. He might have gone
to his native Ambasamudram.

1907
02:14:52,801 --> 02:14:54,928
Yes, he might have gone
there on a picnic.

1908
02:14:56,805 --> 02:14:58,432
He has committed murders.

1909
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:00,264
- Where is your In-law's place?
- Achchankoil.

1910
02:15:00,642 --> 02:15:04,237
Planning to go there in
the name of investigation.

1911
02:15:06,414 --> 02:15:07,608
Yuvan, the compere.

1912
02:15:07,816 --> 02:15:09,283
He has absconded.
We are searching for him.

1913
02:15:09,484 --> 02:15:10,280
What are you doing?

1914
02:15:10,485 --> 02:15:14,546
<i>I want all those who know about
Yuvan & the bearded man in an hour.</i>

1915
02:15:14,756 --> 02:15:16,451
- We should catch him in a day.
- Okay sir.

1916
02:15:16,658 --> 02:15:17,283
Yes sir.

1917
02:15:28,503 --> 02:15:34,135
<i>- No father.
- You coward. Don't cry.</i>

1918
02:15:37,345 --> 02:15:38,403
Why are you laughing?

1919
02:15:39,681 --> 02:15:40,648
Coward.

1920
02:15:55,530 --> 02:15:58,328
Stop--

1921
02:16:00,135 --> 02:16:00,999
Who are you?

1922
02:16:03,138 --> 02:16:04,662
We are from..

1923
02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:07,508
Someone is here.

1924
02:16:14,215 --> 02:16:15,011
What do you want?

1925
02:16:18,053 --> 02:16:20,851
Sir...postman Govindan.

1926
02:16:21,289 --> 02:16:23,416
It's me. And you?

1927
02:16:23,992 --> 02:16:27,359
- I am Prabhakar.
- Prabhakar?

1928
02:16:27,562 --> 02:16:29,530
I lived in this house
when I was young.

1929
02:16:29,731 --> 02:16:35,033
You lived near by her house.
My father...military...car.

1930
02:16:36,571 --> 02:16:40,371
My mother & grandparents
died in a lorry accident.

1931
02:16:40,742 --> 02:16:46,374
After so many years...
Come in, Prabha. Welcome.

1932
02:16:47,749 --> 02:16:49,046
- How are you?
- Very fine.

1933
02:16:51,086 --> 02:16:54,214
He is Prabhakar. He lived in this
house as a kid.

1934
02:16:54,422 --> 02:16:57,050
He is my brother. She is my sister-in-law.
And she is their grand daughter.

1935
02:16:57,258 --> 02:17:04,892
I'm feeling giddy.
Drop me down.

1936
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:07,227
Come inside.

1937
02:17:27,288 --> 02:17:28,255
- Mother...
- What?

1938
02:17:28,690 --> 02:17:31,420
- I'll take rest & then study.
- I will...

1939
02:17:31,626 --> 02:17:33,093
- I will study.
- Then study.

1940
02:17:45,306 --> 02:17:52,769
<i>Funeral of A.C. Mr. Chandrasekar
who was killed by terrorists last night</i>

1941
02:17:52,981 --> 02:17:55,779
<i>will be held today
with all due respect.</i>

1942
02:17:56,317 --> 02:18:04,019
<i>Prabhakar in his testimony aired in our
channel says he had killed him.</i>

1943
02:18:04,325 --> 02:18:07,624
<i>This has confused the police dept.</i>

1944
02:18:08,163 --> 02:18:17,561
<i>Police declared prize money for
giving information about Prabhakar,</i>

1945
02:18:19,607 --> 02:18:20,801
- Commissioner here.
- Good morning sir.

1946
02:18:20,975 --> 02:18:21,566
Good morning.

1947
02:18:21,676 --> 02:18:24,167
- I'm Inspector Rajanagan
from Ambasamudram.- Yes.

1948
02:18:24,345 --> 02:18:26,643
- Prabhakar who appeared
on TV yesterday...- Yes.

1949
02:18:26,848 --> 02:18:29,146
- Our head constable Maris
saw him in the bus.- Good.

1950
02:18:29,684 --> 02:18:32,653
- The last information is that he got down
at Achchankoil with a girl.- Great.

1951
02:18:33,288 --> 02:18:34,721
I will inform the Keral Police right now.

1952
02:18:35,256 --> 02:18:37,588
- We must catch him before media.
- Sure.

1953
02:18:48,636 --> 02:18:52,766
<i>There was a girl“</i>
<i>..who was tall & thin & fat...</i>

1954
02:18:53,041 --> 02:19:00,004
<i>Her hair was a color of ginger.</i>

1955
02:19:38,253 --> 02:19:40,380
Why do you carry this bag always?

1956
02:20:20,962 --> 02:20:28,425
Catch it Anandhi.
Catch it Anandhi.

1957
02:20:29,304 --> 02:20:30,498
Oh no!

1958
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:59,459
- Thanks.
- It may fly away.

1959
02:21:19,954 --> 02:21:24,982
Prabhakar, I am uncle speaking.
Don't get up.

1960
02:21:25,627 --> 02:21:29,085
Police has surrounded you.
They have guns.

1961
02:21:29,597 --> 02:21:33,328
<i>They might gun you down.
I know you are innocent.</i>

1962
02:21:33,701 --> 02:21:35,999
Don't get up. Please.

1963
02:21:43,311 --> 02:21:47,680
- Go away.
- No Prabha. I won't go.

1964
02:21:49,384 --> 02:21:52,785
- Try to understand.
- No.

1965
02:21:56,624 --> 02:21:59,457
Go away, Anandhi.

1966
02:22:04,299 --> 02:22:06,130
Do you really mean that?

1967
02:22:10,805 --> 02:22:12,568
I have no other choice.

1968
02:22:20,581 --> 02:22:26,213
- Go.- No Prabha.
Let anything happen. I'll be here only.

1969
02:22:26,421 --> 02:22:28,321
Stop you nonsense.
They will destroy you.

1970
02:22:28,523 --> 02:22:29,615
I'm already destroyed,
there's nothing to get destroyed.

1971
02:22:37,098 --> 02:22:39,225
- They are coming. Go away.
- I won't go.

1972
02:22:39,434 --> 02:22:42,062
- Don't cry. Go.
- I won't.- Go.

1973
02:22:46,674 --> 02:22:48,904
What is this Anandhi?

1974
02:22:55,283 --> 02:22:56,841
<i>Go Anandhi.</i>

1975
02:23:03,624 --> 02:23:04,591
Look there.

1976
02:23:07,395 --> 02:23:10,762
Our pet dog Tony died that day.
Shall we save our Tony today?

1977
02:24:42,657 --> 02:24:47,287
<i>Two people got crushed under the train,
it has become routine.</i>

1978
02:24:56,671 --> 02:25:01,699
<i>They couldn't save their
pet dog Tony on that day.</i>

1979
02:25:02,410 --> 02:25:05,868
<i>Today none of us could save them.</i>

1980
02:25:06,647 --> 02:25:11,380
<i>Today they have reunited
with their dog Tony.</i>

1981
02:25:12,253 --> 02:25:15,552
<i>If you have time,
come to Achchankoil.</i>

1982
02:25:16,257 --> 02:25:26,223
<i>You can see young Prabhakar & Anandhi with
a lamp along with Tony in the forest.</i>

1983
02:25:27,335 --> 02:25:28,359
<i>Surely, you'll see them.</i>
