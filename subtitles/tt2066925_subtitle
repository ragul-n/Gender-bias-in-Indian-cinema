1
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,484
With Credit Cards on Indian
mothers from films...

2
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,287
"Mothers are a very important
part of Indian Society.

3
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,518
Traditional,
sentimental, sacrificing

4
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,490
With emotional outbursts
every now & then.

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:36,334
But brother times have changed.
Times have changed.

6
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,937
Call it awareness or whatever...

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,940
...but even in far north of India...

8
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,602
In our Punjab...

9
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,740
Indian mother is evolving."

10
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,880
"And evolving how!"

11
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,848
"You too see it!"

12
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,609
Pratap Singh!!

13
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,741
Yes Mummyji!

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,979
Where is my juice?

15
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,342
Why do you cycle so slowly?
Look at us girls.

16
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,674
Come on, silly, fast...
reduce your fat!

17
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,365
Hello, are you from USA
- No, from UK

18
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,798
Oh, great country...

19
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,368
Oh, I think so...

20
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,028
One day I'm going to get a
daughter -In- Law from UK or USA

21
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,363
Oh!! Good Luck.

22
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,975
Thank you, thank you... - Bye-bye...

23
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,840
Welcome to India... Thank you...

24
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,199
Amazing.

25
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,428
You know... I have lost 200 grams.

26
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,867
And when did you check that?

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,995
Early morning...

28
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,432
Then it must be something else...
not your weight,

29
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,370
I tell you,
Chandigarh is a beautiful place.

30
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,735
Open streets, lovely flowers...

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,365
This is the best city to live in

32
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,005
Beautiful here Ah true true...
Chandigarh is the best place

33
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,616
No doubt

34
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,019
East or West,
our Chandigarh is the best

35
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,859
Greetings Mummyji

36
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,596
Greetings. How many have you
delivered? - Three -Good.

37
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,931
He's delivered triplets?

38
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,005
No, the milk packets friend

39
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,307
Everybody has started
called you Mummyji

40
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,604
And that makes you very happy!

41
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,709
Why after my mother-in-law died,

42
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,442
They thought I have inherited
the title...

43
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,915
...along with her bunch of keys.

44
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,617
You know, we had lost our mind.

45
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,615
In India,
everything runs in generations.

46
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,486
Granny to Granny,
Mummyji to Mummyji.

47
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,855
All I can do is say yes when
they call me mother

48
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,461
But everybody seems to forget
your real name- Baby

49
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,957
Not everybody, my dear.

50
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,759
Oye hoye!!

51
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,673
Oh how Slim!!! Good morning Baby...

52
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,210
Good morning, Sandhu Sahab...

53
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,780
Why do you take this trouble
every morning?

54
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,612
Oh my dear, you take the trouble
of calling me Sandhu Sahib.

55
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,379
Baby, don't do this. You're
looking lovely early morning.

56
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,820
Let me carry this,
its too much weight for you.

57
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,323
Oh! Thank you.

58
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,257
You know, since the college days,

59
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,359
I know you and Rajinder,

60
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,896
Just because I don't color my
hair, every week like you,

61
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:07,601
That doesn't mean you call
me Buddha Sandhu sahib!

62
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,636
May your enemies get old, Kanwal.
- You've got style...

63
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,439
What do the girls say these days?
- Yes... you are a stud!

64
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,208
But you know you still haven't
learnt how to tie...

65
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,647
...your turban like Navjot Sidhu...

66
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,749
I didn't have anybody
to tie it for me.

67
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,276
Want tea?

68
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,551
No, I don't want to listen to
lectures about cholesterol

69
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,626
And blood pressure from that
grumpy, old husband of yours.

70
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,820
So do what I do Na -What?

71
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:30,918
Ignore the old man

72
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:35,358
Oh, I wish, I wish.
Such a dream, I wish.

73
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,896
I am going to Sector 17...

74
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,937
...would you like tickets
for the evening show?

75
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,565
I'll ask Bittu and Pinky...

76
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,901
Why not the Captain?

77
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,838
Then who'll take care
of the Sensex?

78
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,510
Ah good! Creative Steps is
really doing well, eh!

79
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,380
For what price you bought it?
- Again your shares!

80
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,922
Babyji! Why don't you take
the boys also forjogging,

81
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,662
Instead of letting them
sleep for so late?

82
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,763
They work hard and sleep well...

83
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,857
Unlike some people who
only sleep on their...

84
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,525
...bank accounts & their dividends.

85
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:10,891
Babyji.

86
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,238
I have given you all freedom
to run the house...

87
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,670
...atleast let me handle my money.

88
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,332
Yes, yes.
It's your money! Why do I care?

89
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,237
Keep the account on
your single name.

90
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,245
I will get the succession
certificate after you...

91
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,378
Anyway... Let it be.

92
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,613
You will never understand me.

93
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,346
By the way, I am going to that
Singh's Bureau today.

94
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,719
How many girls are
you going to see?

95
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,817
Till I get the perfect
daughter-in-law.

96
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,931
You know sweet,
simple girl for my Karan...

97
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,457
And an NRI girl for my
doctor son Arjun.

98
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,799
I want the best of east and west.
- And Simran?

99
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,894
What about Simran?

100
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,735
She's young, only 22, unlike
your sister who's 32.

101
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,300
You are very big!

102
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,738
I mean let her enjoy her life and
fulfil her ambitions first!

103
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,317
Babyji,
no one can argue with you...

104
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,384
Not even God!

105
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,329
Oh Hrithik!

106
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,590
One day I'll come to bollywood
and meet you.

107
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,196
It's my dream

108
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,233
Simran...

109
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm sorry... I just don't have
dates for your films...

110
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,440
Coz I got to cut some ribbons...

111
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,946
She has gone mad!
I'm your mother not Rakesh Roshan!

112
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,681
And I see everyday there is a
new addition on this wall...

113
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,214
Very soon you will reach
bollywood via bhatinda...

114
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,422
And is this what you asked
Chhotu to get for you?

115
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,415
Wow Mom! You are the best mom!

116
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,960
I hope you've taken your
vitamins today.

117
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,751
Oh Mom, I'll have them on Sunday.

118
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,988
Once a week?

119
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,729
But son your skin needs
to glow everyday.

120
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,301
Mom, forget about vitamins...

121
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,699
...you please go search
Karan brother's...

122
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,997
...drawer whenever you can, okay?

123
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,933
Any secret? - Yeah big time!
You will find girls there.

124
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,265
Girls in his drawer?

125
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,671
Yes, yes... First go and check.

126
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,003
Please wait. I will teach
your brothers a lesson...

127
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,576
'What is wrong with you Karan?

128
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,546
Oh ho Mom,
It's just a picture, not the girl!

129
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,382
I am looking for a bride for you

130
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,850
And you are gallivanting
with this girl's photo?

131
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,955
Mom she... - You want to cut
our nose in society?

132
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,697
I mean, doli on the door and...

133
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,855
Girl on the floor!

134
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,728
Look son I have seen the world.

135
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,394
Ya ya, on the internet chatrooms...

136
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,299
Plus 40! - You argue with me?

137
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,704
Lest your doctory makes you forget
that I'm your mother.

138
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,273
Here we go again.

139
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,737
And I carried you boys in my
womb for nine long months

140
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,576
And we are still paying
the rent for it.

141
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,418
Mother... Arjun and I will marry
girls of your choice.

142
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,747
Huh... not me! - Promise?

143
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,924
Promise... - Ok friend!
It's a small price for peace

144
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,493
Karan Arjun... My two gems...

145
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,825
Nobody has such good, obedient
sons like you both! Touch wood.

146
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,862
But son, the World is not what
it was ten years ago.

147
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,308
There are harmonious changes in
youngsters... - Hormonal, Mom...

148
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,398
Oh hee!

149
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,206
Girls are very clever
and sly but boys...

150
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,577
...are simple and innocent
and fool.

151
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,909
Son, I know you two are
not on the wrong path

152
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,620
But one wrong step can
ruin your whole life.

153
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,419
You know, daughter's honor
is parent's honor.

154
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,956
Sons are our dignity you know.

155
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,163
And what about daughters...
they can do anything?

156
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,558
Your Simran,
she's having all the fun...

157
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,963
Don't bring Simran into this.

158
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,863
Girls are much safer than
boys these days.

159
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,471
It's a woman's world after all.

160
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,930
"And that's Mummyji.

161
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,535
Like in most Indian homes...

162
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,974
...there is sex discrimination
even in this one too.

163
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,709
She believes sons and daughters
cannot be treated equally.

164
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,818
Her sons have to be protected from
the big bad world of girls.

165
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,446
And her only daughter?

166
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,680
Oh well! Don't you start with me!

167
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,259
Hi!

168
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,842
Hello... hey!
Are you the new neighbour we have?

169
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,973
No I am his ghost

170
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,942
So you play football for
Chandigarh right?

171
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,682
No I just kick it on my terrace.

172
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,377
Don't you ever give
straight answers?

173
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,954
And do you always ask
silly questions?

174
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,789
Hey, you are so rude.
I don't think we can be friends.

175
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,356
Friends?
- Look I stay away from girls, ok.

176
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,788
I am a bit shy.

177
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,795
And my mom always says girls
bring trouble! So please...

178
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,227
Loser!

179
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,969
Bhalla Sir...

180
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,766
Bhalla Sir...

181
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,406
Welcome to All Age Marriage
Fixers. I am Rajeev Bhalla.

182
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,804
Baby Arora.

183
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,645
Sit... Sit down...

184
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,515
What is the matter?

185
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,789
Sleeping in this marriage
season Bhalla Sir.

186
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,393
Oh what do I say.
With people finding,

187
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,323
You know,
partners on the internet,

188
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,624
Our business has gone to dust...

189
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,833
Infact it has gone so bad,

190
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,294
That even I'm finding problem
to find a bride for myself.

191
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,996
What are you saying Bhalla Sir...

192
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,865
With your looks and personality?

193
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,242
Forget me, you come first...

194
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,307
I have come to you Bhallasaab,
for good marriage proposals.

195
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,646
But it's very strange ji,
with your kind of personality,

196
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,880
Even you are facing problem in
finding the right proposal.

197
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,753
What to say, Bhalla Sahab!

198
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,516
You know it is so important
to find the...

199
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,597
...right partner to
have a good life.

200
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,632
And you know, these days in the
World people are so smart.

201
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,835
Why do you think I am
still a bachelor!

202
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,567
Oh! You are a bachelor?
But you look so happy.

203
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,503
Simple... I am a bachelor.

204
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,478
Good one... good one...

205
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,612
I must tell you one
thing that you...

206
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,412
...Iook beautiful when you laugh.

207
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,979
Your smile is worth
million dollars!

208
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,283
Bhallasaab,

209
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,659
Can you show us the best
that you have...

210
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,293
Strange...

211
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,626
...best I have when the
best is in front...

212
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,733
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me...

213
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,768

My pleasure...
- Oho! What took you two so long?

215
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,504
We were locking the car.

216
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,437
It doesn't take two people
to lock one car!

217
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,735
Hi, I'm karan -Bhalla -Arjun...

218
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,938
Bhalla,

Bhalla Sir, these two young,
handsome men are my sons.

221
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,255
And I've come to you for marriage
proposals for them.

222
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,516
Story has taken a turn.

223
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,818
But babyji,
you look like their sister.

224
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,762
You are paying me a compliment?

225
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,764
Bhalla Sir, you could we see my
could -Be daughters -In -Law.

226
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,770
Ok ji... Oh sorry...

227
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,808
You are going out? Wait please...

228
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,276
Ok,
let me show you, See this girl.

229
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,643
And look at this girl,
who is lying down on the chair.

230
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,545
She belongs to the
family of doctors.

231
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,751
Looks like she belongs
to family of actors.

232
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,513
Because she's lying down.

233
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,554
Actually her uncle is
a Canadian immigrant.

234
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,851
She will also go soon yes.

235
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,588
Oye hoye, she is too good mom.

236
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,753
Why are you saying good?
Everyone is very good,

237
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,262
Which one do you want to marry?

238
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,959
Ma, we can say yes to just
about anyone you find now.

239
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,902
Even a cow will do friend.
- Oh ho Arjun! Behave yourself!

240
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,737
Oh ho! Girls are many but
for men not for boys.

241
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,863
What do you mean?

242
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,434
Let the children go.

243
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,841
I know your choice
is the final one...

244
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,842
Thank you
- Bhalla-bhalla -Thank you

245
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,247
Thank you, please wait outside.

You can say yes to anybody Mother.

247
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,383
Just say yes to anybody!
Uncle ji, please yes...

248
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,922
Rajeev Bhalla, not uncle.

249
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,553
You know my sons,
they are very obedient boys.

250
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,557
They will go by my
choice Bhallasaab.

251
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,255
I am sure, I am sure.

252
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,759
You don't worry,
I will find you the right partner.

253
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,426
What do you mean?

254
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,540
I mean, for your sons.

255
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,404
Look, latest candidate,

256
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,437
Jeena is totally... totally NRI.

257
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,274
Born,
brought up and jobbed in America!

258
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,678
No other heirs also.

259
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,912
Other Virus?
Which virus does she have?

260
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,585
Babyji, Not Virus...
Waa-ris (heir).

261
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,689
I mean the only child.

262
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,893
Three stores in California and
two gas station in New Jersey.

263
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,796
You know what that means...

264
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,291
Dollar!

265
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,597
And what does the girl do?

266
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,230
She is a Doctor...

267
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,504
It's a miracle! You know my son
Arjun, he is also a doctor,

268
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,839
And these days,
doctor boys are in great demand.

269
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,211
And my other son, Karan...

270
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,309
He runs a restaurant,
two crores turnover per year.

271
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,352
In all of chandigarh...

272
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,855
...all the decent families,
they come to the restaurant.

273
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,724
Its called Million Dollar...

274
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,493
Bhalla sir, slept again?

275
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,562
No, I was just dreaming.
Thank you.

276
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,192
I have been wanting to
ask you a question.

277
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,199
Ask and you shall receive!

278
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,438
Have you been trying to flirt
with me Rajeev Bhalla?

279
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,738
I have heard honesty pays...

280
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,343
Yes I have!

281
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,910
Even your slap is a Million
Dollar Baby!

282
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,640
We are lucky to have good sons...

283
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,572
I really wish Baby...

284
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,740
...you'd keep an eye
on your daughter...

285
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,613
...as much as you do on your sons.

286
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,717
Oh!
Simran can take care of herself...

287
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,314
You don't know what is going
on in this world these days.

288
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,479
Didn't see TV?

289
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,754
Boys are being teased,
molested, and raped all the time.

290
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,892
The world is in a bad state.

291
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,522
Watch the news, you will get
all the vital statistics.

292
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,968
Babyji? - Yes?

293
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,793
Do you have to speak in English?

294
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,205
I have to move with the world.

295
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,404
I must share a secret with you.

296
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,470
I see Mrs. Bhatia's
daughter very...

297
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,238
...often on the terrace these days,

298
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,978
And I am afraid that very
soon Arjun will start...

299
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,216
...drying his towel on
the terrace also.

300
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,778
You know times might have
changed but hale wee,

301
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,420
This is still Love Chandigarh
style. - Babyji...

302
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,320
Terrace is where it all begins...
- Who gives all these stories?

303
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,716
You are late again Muniya!

304
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,026
Very good Mummyji,

305
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,656
How do you know that I have come
without even looking at me.

306
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,598
From that strong perfume you use
from Mrs. Gupta's table...

307
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,033
Here, cut it...
- Flaunts her goggle!

308
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,004
Here, I was gossiping.

309
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,639
You know poor Mrs. Gupta...

310
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,546
You know Gupta sir is giving
her sleepless nights. - What?

311
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,585
Sleepless nights.
- Why don't you leave him?

312
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,813
She should leave that good for
nothing husband of hers!

313
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,820
Entire chandigarh
seems to be here.

314
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,216
Here, that is the problem
with us women no.

315
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,591
A husband can tell you on your
face that he doesn't like you,

316
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,524
He likes his mother's food...

317
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,603
...he likes another
woman's bed better

318
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,703
And you don't have the guts to
say anything. Tell me why?

319
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,829
Why?

320
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,532
Because we all like to be
called Mrs. Something.

321
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,337
This is all Mrs. Da's ruse.

322
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,738
Its tasty!

323
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,921
I found it!

324
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,483
Love Story! Must be Simran's!!

325
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,020
I leave it... That's mine...

326
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,262
Yes, Secret diary?

327
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,337
It's good,
at least you can write...

328
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,598
I can't even do that.

329
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,866
C'mon, forget it.

330
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,442
Good. I thought that Mrs. Gupta
has her own boutique,

331
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,509
Then why does she need
her husband's name...

332
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,772
Because the money is
in his account.

333
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,749
Look at yourself,
if sir says anything to you, ok?

334
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,983
Will you be able to shout back?
Right?

335
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,780
Because he controls the money

336
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,688
How do you know all this?

337
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,694
Here. Muniya who used to
know the news of the...

338
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,493
...entire house is living
with eyes closed?

339
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,989
You know Mummyji,

340
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,428
I know everything that's
happening...

341
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,505
...in every house in chandigarh.

342
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,576
Oh my God, I don't understand this

343
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,505
Why this insistence?

344
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,643
I have said it! Make your bank
accounts joint with me now.

345
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,580
For the last 30 years
you haven't asked...

346
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,016
...me to make the accounts joint,

347
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,780
So why now?

348
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,822
You don't care about
my social security?

349
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,382
Social security?

350
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,016
She means her security
in the society.

351
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,351
Right Baby?

352
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,258
Some fruits for you...
- Yes look Kanwal...

353
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,424
Suppose tomorrow he leaves me
for another woman, then!

354
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,557
Are you crazy?

355
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,631
For the last 30 years,
I've tolerated you,

356
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,831
Another 20 wont do
much harm to me.

357
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,271
Last 30 years I've known you...
I wonder who is tolerating who.

358
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,742
At least someone takes my side!

359
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,849
Actually, he's also not sure
who is tolerating who.

360
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,775
That's what he means.
- You have no values for me... right?

361
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,342
No values for you?

362
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,384
You are the one who goes on
the date sites all night,

363
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,249
Not me! - Oh yes... that Simran
has taught me to keep...

364
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,657
...myself busy while
you are snoring,

365
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,229
So that I don't get disturbed.

366
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,956
Babyji?

367
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,729
Yes?
- Who do you think you are fooling?

368
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:23,957
You, what?

369
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,603
Funny I call her Baby and
you call her Babyji.

370
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:35,441
Well, because you admired her
in college and I married her.

371
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,009
Well,
I hope there are no regrets...

372
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,582
Coz she's really lovely...

373
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,676
She is...

374
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,423
And, by the way, I have some
good news for you...

375
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,485
Sensex has gone up, eh!

376
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,254
That's the only thing he knows...

377
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,619
Sin & Sex!

378
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,631
I can also joke, you know!

379
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,868
But Kanwal, explain.

380
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,231
Why does he control his money
department so much?

381
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,600
That's the only control
he hasn't given you!

382
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,602
Whose side are you on?
His or mine?

383
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,347
Baby... - You really want to know?

384
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,946
This fellow's still jealous
because you married me.

385
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,985
Too bad he missed the
train but now...

386
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,550
...he must get back on the tracks

387
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,883
And help us find good girls
for Karan Arjun.

388
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,417
And Simran?
- Oho!!! - What about her?

389
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,551
No, Simran has to stand on
her own two feet first.

390
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,491
Career comes first for girls.

391
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,322
Hey look... that's Sid...

392
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,293
You better look at the road...

393
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,601
Ok, let me see what fun.

394
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:34,930
All right.

395
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,572
Hi Sid! Hey...

396
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,510
Do you want to go for a film?

397
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,008
I got better things to do babe.

398
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,442
Better than wasting my time with
a girl like you! - What!!!

399
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,484
What do you think of yourself?

400
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,453
Shut up, what do you think
some drama is going on?

401
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,522
Yes... A girl flirting with a boy

402
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,647
Forget it...

403
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,590
Listen,
you should not do the treadmill...

404
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,890
...for more than 20 minutes.
- It can affect your heart.

405
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,491
Arjun doctor,
how do I explain you,

406
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,600
I need to be slim. I need to fit
into my old suits, you know.

407
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,795
What's the urgency?

408
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,271
I'm looking for a boy for my
daughter, Arjun doctor.

409
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,272
Then what's the problem?

410
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,870
Let me explain,
If the mother is fat...

411
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,913
...they'll think daughter also has
a tendency to put on weight.

412
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,346
So I need to have the future
image of my daughter,

413
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,475
To be slim forever. - You know
hereditary problem and all that.

414
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,679
I hope you understand... - How old...

415
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,187
I'm 40 plus.

416
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,448
Not you, your daughter?

417
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:31,585
My daughter is Twenty Six.
Very sweet,

418
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,390
Very simple girl.
You know domestic type.

419
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,501
Are you married? - No...

420
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,793
You're not married?

421
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,835
Can I have your parents' number?

422
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,308
You know, if your family,
my family join hands,

423
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,874
We're going to have a blast...

424
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,872
My daughter is going to
make your family proud.

425
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,439
Trust me on that...

426
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,783
Parents' number...
- This is my mom's number.

427
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,784
Her name is Babyji but everybody
calls her Mummyji.

428
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,581
She'll be glad to meet you
because she is also...

429
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,019
...Iooking for a simple
and a sweet girl.

430
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,690
Like my daughter... of course yes
- Hope to see you soon...

431
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,656
Thank you so much.

432

And Arjun doctor, till then you
take care of yourself okay...

433
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,159
Take Care... Control, control...
- Bye... Bye... Thank you...

434
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,231
Mummyji... Babyji!

435

Eat snacks.
Give snacks to this fatso.

00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,787

446
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,240
Who do you think called her?

447
00:26:58,917 --> 00:26:59,941

Greetings.

449
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,186
My son Karan.

450
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,921
Not this one. I was talking
about Mr. Arjun Arora,

451
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,953
To be precise. - Arjun?
Who told you I was looking for...

452
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,858
...a sweet and simple girl for him.

453
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,867
I am only looking for
a Canadian or...

454
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,766
...American citizen for him Sister.

455
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:20,893
Nothing less.

456
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,307
You mean you're going to market
Mr. Arjun for NRI girls yes?

457
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,275
What do you mean market?

458
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,903
We are a very patartic family

459
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,413
We all love India very much.

460
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,216
Anyway, what do you do Karan?

461
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,717

463
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,321
Ok, ok, ok Million Dollars,

Yes, Million Dollars

466
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,529

00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,672
Renu...

471
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,472
Renu...

472
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:07,678
Please come fast,
- Somebody's come to see you.

473
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,546
Hello...

474
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,455
What's your name son?

475
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,593
She's Renu... Renu.

476
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,721
Preeti.

477
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,401
Mama, Aunt's brought offering
from Amritsar...

478
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,934
I will have the offering later...

479
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,470
...I want you to go
inside right now.

480
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,437
Give her a chance,
it's her chance.

481
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,271
We like your daughter Sister.
So unlike you.

482
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,809
But I am looking for a match for
my elder daughter, Renu...

483
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,740
Not for her because,
she is very small,

484
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,647
Not ready for marriage. Go inside.

485
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,381
Oh, leave it sister, you still
believe in those old thoughts?

486
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,725
You know, my son, he's a very
simple, home-Ioving boy,

487
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,297
That's why for him I'm looking
for a sweet and simple girl.

488
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,965
Somebody who is traditional,
wears lots of clothes

489
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,290
Who, you know...

490
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,962
...is going to be at home most
of the times to take rest,

491
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,400
So that when my son comes back
from work, she's at her best...

492
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,972
To do his service.

493
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,603
My thoughts are old?

494
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,210
But wow, you have very
new thoughts, sister!

495
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,347
So alliance is fixed?
- Karan, let mother take it.

496
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,653
Ok sister,

Look after yourself my son.

00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,616
Oh and what about your
woolen clothes?

00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,356
But its warm there ma!

503
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,788
Yes ma, yes ma -And your pajamas?
Put shorts in suitcase?

504
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,364
Mother... - And karan brother,

505
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,489
You... Shut up

We'll miss you Ma
- Miss you son, miss you.

507
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,195
Karan -This fellow's a very
good friend of mine.

508
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,331
Give him a call if you
have any problem, ok?

509
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:10,311
Thanks Dad. - You guys have a great
time, enjoy yourself. - Bye

Bye Bye...

512
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,831
Babyji, they are only going
on their honeymoon...

513
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,298
...why are you crying?

514
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,626
Today our son is estranged.

515
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,931
Ma, boys belong to others.
Haven't you heard...

516
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,503
I know, son is a son till
he gets a wife?

517
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,773
How do I look? Today thermal
facial Husband's day.

518
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,316
Beautiful... ready to be misused.

519
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,279
You only talk!

520
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,323
I am going on the internet...

521
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,922
Aah! The UK dating site.

522
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,222
What difference does
it make to you?

523
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,189
If Somebody in California...

524
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,735
...London or Australia tells
me I am very smart,

525
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,303
Beautiful and intelligent...

526
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,871
Then why do you feel jealous?

527
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,837
I am notjealous Babyji...

528
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,504
They haven't lived with you...

529
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,635
...so they don't know what
they are getting into.

530
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,379
You will never appreciate the
fact that I married you,

531
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,381
Even when all the other
boys in Chandigarh...

532
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,975
...were chasing me on
their motorbikes.

533
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:23,878
Oh... I know that!

534
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,545
And so was Kanwal, by the way...

535
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,452
He's a kid, but I got stuck...

536
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,689
He remained a Bloody Bachelor!

537
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,862
But a sensible decision!

538
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,570
Oh sister! Your mixer is done ji.

539
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,372
What will you have for lunch?
What to cook?

540
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,342
Anything darling.
You know I am not that fussy.

541
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,970
Yeah, except for that loud woman,

542
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,010
Who you've been serving
all your life...

543
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,341
And did you say Baby...

544
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,610
She's more of an aunty...

545
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,276
You don't like Baby do you?

546
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,019
Billu,

547
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,481
I don't like the fact
that because...

548
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,957
...of her you're still not married,

549
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,326
That you are still alone...
- And she's much older than you...

550
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,591
Age and love... what's
the connection...

551
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,257
Keeps buying vegetables.

552
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,767
Newspapers & milk packets...
What else?

553
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,531
Life is not about marriage
and kids,

554
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,367
I feel some kind of spiritual
connection with Baby...

555
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,578
Spiritual... Oh shut up billu.

556
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,346
Even at this age no love affair...

557
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,351
Let me tell you one thing,
that woman is all wrong.

558
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,589
She treats her sons like
daughters and her daughter, oh god.

559
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,950
I never saw such a topsy-turvy
old lady.

560
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,991
You know, that girl Muniya,
the one who works for her,

561
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,896
You know what she was telling me?

562
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,932
She was telling me that
even at this age she...

563
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,831
...Iooks at men's photos
on the computer.

564
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:45,958
That girl!

565
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,961
She's the biggest gossip
in Chandigarh!

566
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,363
Don't believe her

567
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,712
It's hurting me.

568
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,577
C'mon tell us then.

569
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,579
Oh that Kohli Sir's daughter no...

570
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,277
...ran away with the
security guard.

571
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,445
Oh!
Look at the security guard's guts!

572
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,485
Nice security!
Stole her for himself!

573
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,489
Mummyji, don't mind...

574
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,161
But our Simran sister also...

575
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,732
No what I mean to say was,

576
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,732
She has grown to become
very beautiful.

577
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,932
Why don't you find a boy for her...

578
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:23,862
You do your work.

579
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,170
I do half of your work.

580
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,777
And send kid with the
coffee outside,

581
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,970
I am in the garden.

582
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,312
Hey, kid.

583
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,681
When it comes to her family,

584
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,517
Then she goes to the garden!

585
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,354
Flower valley.

586
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,526
Hey, open the door.
See who has come.

587
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,312
Wow, Nice house.

588
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,682
Are we in the right house? I...

589
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,456
Oh darling you are so confused

590
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,787
Sorry to bother you maam

591
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,558
Listen... are you from abroad?

592
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,533
United States of America -Oh then
you are in the right house.

593
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,796
Bhalla Sir has sent you.

594
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,338
He called me! Come in, come in...
Please come in...

595
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:32,831
Hello...

596
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,823
Whats your name son?

597
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,250
Jeena.

598
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,724
Babyji, but we don't know
anything about the family.

599
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,767
Oh ho... Stop being so suspicious.
- I'm not being suspicious...

600
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,336
Good evening

601
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,864
What happened?
Dad is being suspicious again?

602
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,441
Yes. It's old habit. Old habits
die hard you know.

603
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,699
Give him a sweet

604
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,869
Have this wedding sweet.
Only then will you realize it.

605
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,844
What will I realize?
Why are you speaking like this?

606
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,745
Why don't you speak
in Punjabi like me?

607
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,510
I don't speak in Punjabi babyji,

608
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,846
Because I don't want to sound as...

609
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,547
...if I am fighting all the time.
- Try Telugu then,

610
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,554
You will sound as if
you've gone to war...

611
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,587
Oh Mom, what happened?

612
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,390
Dad seems to be in a grumpy mood...

613
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,325
Has the sensex dropped again?

614
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,530
He's always in a grumpy mood.

615
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,693
You know,
in college he was always laughing.

616
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,805
But I don't know,
he hasn't smiled since when...

617
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,429
Since I married you.

618
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,372
I think, he has got a pause...
- Pause?

619
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,910
Yes oh hey, men's pause

620
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,477
Men... Menopause!

621
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,678
Mom... - Dad, mom is very funny.

622
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,341
Next she'll ask me to get
hysterectomy done boy!

623
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,510
Too good, too good!

624
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,354
Stop being so hysterical.

625
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,450
You must listen to what your
mother's done! - What?

626
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,722
I found a wonderful doctor girl
for you from California.

627
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,561
See what I mean! - Mom!

628
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,968
What if the degree is fake
or the father is a cabbie?

629
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,500
My choice can never be wrong.

630
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,601
Besides that Singh's
marriage bureau...

631
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,004
...has a wonderful reputation.

632
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,776
He's also showing me some lovely
boys for Simran, you know!

633
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,900
What!

634
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,878
God help your sister boy.

635
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,304
What about me!!

636
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,644
Shh Shh... - Sid... hello... Sid...

637
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,321
Bravo!!! The girl gave a flower!

638
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,395
If the boy smiles,
it means he's wooed!!!

639
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,354
Come up, come up.

640
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,492
Hi! - Hi!

641
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,563
Simran, I need to speak to you.
- Me? Really? - Yes

642
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,660
Not bad!

643
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,672
Look Simarn,
You are distracting me.

644
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,506
The only passion in
life that I have...

645
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,373
...is football and my
love is guitar.

646
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,746
And there is no room for
anything else in it.

647
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,348
So please stop trying so hard.

648
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,045
That's what you want Sid?

649
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,943
I think you should listen
to your heart?

650
00:40:56,353 --> 00:41:00,585
Sometime happens.

651
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,624
What is that? Did you hear that?

652
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,784
No I didn't.

653
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,228
Sid sometimes you should
let your emotions flow.

654
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,524
After all, it's your life.

655
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,427
Exactly Simran, and that's what
I want to make. My life.

656
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,760
I want to play for
the Arsenal team.

657
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,297
I want to be famous.

658
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,671
Simran, you are a very
nice girl, you know.

659
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,209
You can get anybody you want,

660
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,937
But I've got something
else on my mind and...

661
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,776
...I don't have time for
all this nonsense.

662
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,909
You are not gay are you?

663
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,945
Just because you're proposing
me and I am not game for it?

664
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,215
Well, That's a new one!
- I hope you didn't mind that.

665
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,417
Not at all you know.

666
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,528
Nowadays you can expect anything
out girls and most of them...

667
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,620
...they just don't take
no for an answer!

668
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,260
Ok Sid. But at least,
we can be platonic friends?

669
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,532
Of course, why not? - So friends?

670
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,625
Sure.

671
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,603
Junior, bring water.

672
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,047
Bless you, son.

673
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,512
As a triff. - Come son.

674
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,848
Will make tea for
you myself today.

675
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,521
You look tired. - No I am fine...

676
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,955
Mummyji where's the kitchen?

677
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,725
I will make tea for all of us.

678
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,897
Didn't I tell you, she's domestic.

679
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,399
No, son. You can't enter the
kitchen just like that.

680
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,463
Tomorrow we will have a ceremony...

681
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,004
...and then you can cook regularly.

682
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,503
You must all tell me your
favourite dishes.

683
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,008
I would love to make special
food for each one of you.

684
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,438
Oh! My perfect!

685
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,542
Simran take your sister
in law to her room.

686
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:34,875
Come sister-in-law

687
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,213
Go, brother...

688
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:38,744
Listen.

689
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,321
You can be innocent
with your mother...

690
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,017
...but with a wife you
got to be a man!

691
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,225
Remember that. - Babyji

692
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,318
Yes?

693
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,488
Now let it...

694
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,997
I mean,
let the boy lead his own life now.

695
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,564
Haven't you heard that saying...

696
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,570
It takes a mother 20 years
to make a man out of a boy

697
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,534
But it takes a wife 20 minutes
to make a fool out of him...

698
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,734
I don't want to give her
those 20 minutes.

699
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,810
When will you ever learn Babyji?

700
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,804
Or,
some things never change do they?

701
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,814
Just like some bank accounts,
right?

702
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,610
Let me look after my wealth...

703
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,950
My Karan Arjun and you enjoy
your daughter-in-law's...

704
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,248
...cooking along with
your new kurums!

705
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,992
Oh yes! I will, I will.

706
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,687
So, Mr. William, how are the
markets doing in America?

707
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,492
The commodities are up I guess.

708
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,659
Honey watch your calories please.

709
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,634
Saw... It's true love.

710
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,700
So Mummyji...

711
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,638
You can call me Babyji please
- Alright, alright.

712
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,008
So do you also cook as delicious
food as your daughter-in-law?

713
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,912
Oh yeah! She's an excellent cook.

714
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,813
In fact, you must make some
mustard vegetable...

715
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,749
...and corn bread for your kurum!

716
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,582
Yes, what about his calories!

717
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,283
Never mind...

718
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,947
...but I know what kurum is.

719
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,320
You know!!

720
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:50,882
But aunty...

721
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,019
Oh son, you can call me Mummyji,

722
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,661
My doctor...

723
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,431
Actually, I just wanted
to say that I can't...

724
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,559
...cook at all and Preeti
is so good at it

725
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,365
Son you are a doctor,
you have to operate not cook.

726
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,640
And you are international,
my Preeti is domestic.

727
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,247
Karan son,
I'm really at peace now.

728
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,243
You know, your wife is just
the girl that I wanted.

729
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:15,779
And her great cooking?

730
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,784
Now, that's a bonus for us.

731
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,277
Hmm, Preeti is...

732
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,445
Preeti is a bonus.

733
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,420
Wonderful, right? Wonderful!

734
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,559
Lets go Simran.
- Hi sister-in-law!!

735
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,530
Mummyji would be waiting for
us at the jewellery shop.

736
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,533
"Big buns..."

737
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,832
She is so sweet.

738
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:35,961
Ya sure

739
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,469
Sister-in-law your lipstick
is very dark.

740
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,968
So is yours Simran.

741
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,310
Mum says it suits me.

742
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,377
So does she have different
set of rules...

743
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,006
...for different members
of the family?

744
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:48,940
Sister-in-law?

745
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,546
I was just saying that...

746
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,279
We both have the same
likes and dislikes.

747
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,748
But you are the daughter-in-law
of the house, right.

748
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,389
Does that word 'In-law'
make such a...

749
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,894
...big difference in a girl's life?

750
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,823
I am just as young as
you are Simran...

751
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,695
Oh... lets go.

752
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,249
Greetings, sister.

753
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,511
Greetings.

754
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,386
We have fixed Arjun's marriage.

755
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,917
This is for you. Do come.

756
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,995
But I've never been to your house.

757
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,291
Oh! What an expensive card.

758
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,291
I'm sure you're taking a big,
fat dowry.

759
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,863
No dear... no dowry...

760
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,736
I am god fearing. Yes, sister.

761
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,431
I mean,
My children are my wealth...

762
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,838
...what else can anyone give me?

763
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:47,910
They are very nice Americans.

764
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,443
All they want is a
simple marriage.

765
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,737
Good.

766
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,015
I hear your son Preet
is coming soon.

767
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,541
Yes, he's coming...

768
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,752
Save your daughter.

769
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,887
So don't try any alliance, okay?

770
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:02,447
Jeeji,

771
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,954
What have I done to make
you hate me so much?

772
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,224
I wish yours parents
had not traveled...

773
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,696
...with my parents from Pakistan,

774
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,860
And we hadn't lived in
the same neighborhood,

775
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,735
Then my Billu would have
never known you.

776
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,796
But it's not my fault.

777
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,501
Why do you hold his affection
for me against me?

778
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,207
Affection?

779
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,443
My billoo's never got
married because he...

780
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,744
...thinks there is no other
woman like you.

781
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,313
Then maybe he knows me better
than the rest of the world.

782
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,824
We have played together
as children.

783
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,222
He's like family to me,
and you too.

784
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:43,299
But what he feels for me
personally is not my faultjeeji.

785
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:47,192
I mean my whole family is so
fond of Kanwal, notjust me.

786
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,301
Ok, let it be.
Don't get so emotional.

787
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,736
I am not getting emotional.

788
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,243
I can't afford to get emotional...

789
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,943
Life teaches us not to.

790
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,676
Hi! Baby?

791
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,387
How are you here? You look upset.
- Did Rajinder scold you?

792
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,356
No, dear, but you are so concerned

793
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,820
It is Arjun's wedding.

794
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,451
And both of you must come.

795
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,491
You are my family after all...

796
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,393
Greetings...

797
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:25,533
You know Jeeji,
she's still got that child in her.

798
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,500
That Baby I have known for years.

799
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,505
Please don't scold her.

800
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,603
Jhalla!

801
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,175
Hai, Jhalla!!

802
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,521
Wait.

803
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,862
Sing and dance! Celebrate!

804
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,794
Sing a sweet song! - Come on.

805
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,389
Hey, lets start with Mummyji...

806
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,608
Mummyji tell daughter-in-law
to cover the head.

807
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,845
Daughter-in-law is a foreigner.

808
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,575
She does not know all this, yes.

809
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,159
Preeti son you also dance.

810
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,363
No... - C'mon... Why are you so shy?

811
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,235
No Mummyji... I'm fine... You go...

812
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:05,839
Come... - No Mummyji... please...

813
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,265
She's mad!!!

814
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,210
Preeti is very simple and child...

815
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,180
...I told him to dance with
me but she said no.

816
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,366
Hi sister-in-law,
you were darn good last night.

817
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,802
Are you a professional dancer?

818
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,001
Then you must've partied a lot
before marriage? Right?

819
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,903
No never.
My mother was very strict.

820
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,537
Okay then I must take
you out one night.

821
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,478
Come with me...
but don't tell anyone.

822
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,980
Thorn pricked.

823
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,647
Oh it hit -Come on -Go there

824
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:00,882
I really enjoyed it...

825
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:02,548
What dance it was...

826
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:03,681
One second

827
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:08,722
Very good dancing...
- But you know what...

828
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,630
...your dance steps gave Mummyji
high blood pressure.

829
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,526
Wait a minute, Simran Sister,

830
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,695
Before you go all ready
and gallivanting,

831
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,897
Give this to mummyji

832
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,338
Ever since I came, she's sighing...

833
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,702
Whatever... - What a song!

834
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,574
I said, it was amazing.

835
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:29,280
I tried to say sorry to her last
night, but she was sleeping...

836
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,377
From childhood...

837
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,386
I love dancing,
when I hear good music,

838
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,392
Cannot control.
Something happens in my body.

839
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,495
Great! Something happens
in my body. Really?

840
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,858
I said,
You opened Mummyji's eyes...

841
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,825
She was stunned.

842
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,731
God knows what that American
is going to do...

843
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,937
Thorn pricked...

844
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,338
Here or there,

845
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,739
Wonder where it pricked...

846
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,845
But I enjoyed it a lot...

847
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,551
What is she doing?

848
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,627
It is called Paani Vaarna.

849
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,266
She's taking all your
troubles on herself...

850
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,628
Oh! You are more than welcome!

851
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,379
Babyji...

852
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,325
So, writing secrets?

853
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,556
About the old boyfriends or
the new ones on the net?

854
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:49,889
You are too much...

855
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,435
But seriously babyji...

856
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,868
What do you keep pouring in
this diary day and night?

857
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,500
Some things are better
written and not said.

858
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,968
I'm going to miss you so much,
and you keep uh...

859
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,853
Arre... Bless you son, Bless you.

860
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,490
Now you two must get together
soon, eh? - I know, son...

861
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,389
...it is not good to leave your
husband alone without a leech...

862
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,690
A Leech? - Just, ignore your
mother-in-law's English,

863
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,558
As she would put Oxford dictionary
to shame! - Ok...

864
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,760
You just take care of yourself...
hmmm...

865
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,735
Yes Dad, Bye everybody.

866
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,336
Junior., you served me well.

867
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,265
I had a wonderful time.

868
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,634
It was really nice
knowing you all...

869
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,570
Bye.

870
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,779
What... - Yes... - This girl is
saying? - What did she say?

871
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:42,874
What did she mean,

872
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,681
I had a wonderful time,
it was nice knowing you? '

873
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,581
I mean,
you only say that when you...

874
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,022
...are never going to meet again.

875
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,426
No,
Babyji, She didn't mean that...

876
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:52,853
You just misunderstood!

877
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,763
But be careful of that
Bittu and Pinky.

878
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,267
They are very jealous of me.
They jinx others.

879
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,399
Ward off evil eyes.
You look great, Babyji.

880
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,405
Come on...
If not money at least you've...

881
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:06,770
...paid me a compliment today.

882
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,435
Oh my god, there you go again,
money money money!!

883
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,811
I am not a fool to risk my hard
earned money in your hands.

884
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,176
And, may I ask...

885
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,185
...where are you going all dressed
up like a Christmas tree?

886
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,216
It's Karvachauth (festival).
I am going to pray for you, yes!

887
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,350
When will he learn
to drive slowly?

888
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,792
This boy drives very fast.

889
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,726
Don't worry I'm there...

890
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,292
I love you too Jeena

891
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,424
Jeena?

892
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,606
Give it to me, oh give it friend

893
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,441
Hi Jeena...
- Yes main mummy speaking...

894
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,874
...son, when are you calling
Arjun to America?

895
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,912
Mom, I've spoken to her.
- Be quiet!

896
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,812
Jeena... You are behind us
in time so Karvachauth...

897
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,508
...must've just started for you.

898
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,251
Did you keep the fast son?

899
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,612
For Heaven's sake!

900
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,785
Why do I have to do that?

901
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,413
It seems she's eating something.

902
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,590
Jeena son, if one day, you don't
eat pizzas and burgers,

903
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:02,926
It wont kill you but my son
will live a long life...

904
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,860
And you are going to pray
for my long life!

905
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,302
For your son's long life,
I need to stay hungry?

906
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,234
Now where does that come from?

907
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,703
I mean I don't get it.

908
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:14,867
Jeena, relax friend.

909
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,342
Take America's taste

910
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,670
She's very stubborn.

911
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,339
She says it's a stupid belief
that by her staying...

912
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,350
...hungry my son will
have a long life.

913
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,247
Fine, why do I care?

914
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,679
This is of my wife.

915
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,520
C'mon son... We'll leave... Ok...

916
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,984
Hen-pecked husband

917
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,399
Let's admit it.

918
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,534
Your mom's right.
It's a woman's world eh!

919
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Joker!

920
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,613
Baby, has Arjun got his visa?

921
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,646
Jeena is sending the papers.

922
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,775
We've been hearing this
for last seven months.

923
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,944
Here...

924
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,883
What a time!

925
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,859
Girls come from abroad,
marry our boys,

926
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,919
Have lovely honeymoon and
go back having fun...

927
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,790
...money and all our Jewellery.

928
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,491
Shut up Bittu, stop this nonsense.

929
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,726
My Jeena loves Arjun and
wants him with her soon.

930
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:16,767
How Soon? - When your son
becomes a mendicant?

931
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,665
Or when her daughter-in-law
finds a Mexican!!

932
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,210
Arjun, Call Jeena.

933
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,979
Mom, She must be at work.

934
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,779
Now!
Call on her mobile phone -But mom

935
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,583
I think we should make a move.
Come Pinky.

936
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,320
That side auntyji, that side...

937
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,358
Take care, Baby

938
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,696
I am telling you. Call Jeena,

939
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,559
And ask her when she is
sending the papers.

940
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:46,597
I am fed up. All the neighbors,
my friends, they keep asking

941
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,964
Your son has got his visa?

942
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,569
When is your daughter-in-law
calling your son to America'?

943
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,572
It's a matter of my pride,
you know.

944
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,734
I thought this only happened
to girls in India!

945
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,312
You give Jeena an ultimatum!
Call her now!

946
00:56:57,447 --> 00:57:00,007
Mom, I did.
It says number does not exist.

947
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,579
Uhh, then call her house
numbers or her father...

948
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,517
...William or her mother's office.

949
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,715
I have already tried all the
numbers. - All have the same answer.

950
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,416
Number does not exist anymore.

951
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,856
Send email, Jeena

952
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,792
I did... three weeks back...
no reply what-so-ever.

953
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,219
What?

954
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,466
My daughter-in-law
disappears and...

955
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,467
...you are telling me this today...

956
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:29,308
Whatever happened with you
wasn't right. Right?

957
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,810
Such a nice family and his
is what they do to you?

958
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,717
You know what, you should
contact their relatives?

959
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,350
They have no relatives.

960
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,981
They wanted a simple marriage.
Now I know why they said that...

961
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,389
So that only our people
would be there.

962
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:44,955
She took everything from us...

963
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,757
Even the gold set that my
mother-in-law gave me.

964
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,762
I am ruined, Muniya.

965
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,829
You know, Agarwal madam, she was
feeling very bad for you.

966
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,606
She said this is what happens
when you get greedy.

967
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,402
You are very bad, don't discuss
my family with others.

968
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,870
And when was I greedy?

969
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,777
Lo, you were the one know...

970
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,509
...who wanted to make your
doctor son's future?

971
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:08,940
Future?

972
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,918
Feature... Future.

973
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,316
Muniya your English
is better than me.

974
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,623
Oh no, I have worked with
a foreigner know.

975
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,921
He wanted to marry me and
take me to Dubai...

976
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,492
And now, this Italian! Enough.

977
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,793
C'mon, be quiet. It's so hot.

978
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,462
I wonder what the electricity
people are doing.

979
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,364
May they be doomed!

980
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,404
Umm, Mummyji, give double money.

981
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:35,772
What's the joyous occasion?

982
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:39,279
Oh, I gave you sympathy,
sympathy costs money...

983
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,983
Ten rupees for gossip,
ten rupees for advice.

984
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,616
Total is 30 rupees.

985
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,946
Very sly.
What advice you can give me?

986
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:48,952
I tell you,
get your son married again.

987
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,426
That American daughter-in-law
of yours is lost!

988
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:52,650
30 rupees!

989
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:09,303
I say, your daughter-in-law
gets up very early, right?

990
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:10,707
Just in time for lunch!

991
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,481
I say, good morning!

992
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,881
Muniya I am not a neighbour that
you can gossip about me!

993
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,816
What happened to you?
Where is your hair?

994
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,221
And where are you going
in this fancy dress?

995
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,458
Karan wants me to help him
in the restaurant...

996
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,292
...instead of sitting at
home all day long.

997
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,592
Karan doesn't know anything.

998
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,662
Mummyji,
don't underestimate your son.

999
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:40,704
Babyji, babyji. - In response to
your matrimonial advertisements,

1000
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,403
Lots of letters have come for
Simran. - Looking at Preeti...

1001
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,777
...I hope we get a better
son-in-law than daughters-in-law!

1002
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,711
Hello... Oh Preeti!

1003
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,249
Hmm, you look fine! I mean...
- Lovely.

1004
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:53,477
Thanks Dad!

1005
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,984
Oh,
I'll just check the letters, eh!

1006
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:02,259
Best of Luck for the third
marriage in the family Mummyji.

1007
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,387
Don't talk rubbish!

1008
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,668
Burning turning...

1009
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,896
My heart is burning

1010
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:18,470
Simran... - Jeans? And black
T-shirt... What is this nonsense!

1011
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,584
Mom this is how I normally dress.
- Today is not a normal day!

1012
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,618
Your could-be in-laws will
be here any minute.

1013
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,914
You should be grateful that
I'm even meeting them...

1014
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,614
And this is the fourth guy
you are making me meet!

1015
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:28,588
Thank you very much.

1016
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,852
And don't tell them you wanted
to join Bollywood.

1017
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,484
Last time you spoiled your chance.

1018
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,688
You know, people don't like
glamorous girls son.

1019
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,662
They think the girl is
of loose character.

1020
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,995
But if they ask what I
wanted to do, then?

1021
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,792
Tell them you wanted
to join the IAS.

1022
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,971
You know they will
be most impressed.

1023
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:44,630
They'll think our daughter
gave up...

1024
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,299
...such a great career
for their son.

1025
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,603
IAS girls are in great
demand in Punjab.

1026
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,379
If you were used to
traditional dress...

1027
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,278
...this wouldn't have happened.
Here.

1028
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,354
So difficult for you to cover
your legs now huh?

1029
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,218
I wish you had told me
this 3 years back Mom.

1030
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,986
Don't talk too much and
just answer in short.

1031
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,618
Answer in yes or no.

1032
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,726
Why don't you tell them
your daughter...

1033
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,728
...is deaf and dumb for a day?

1034
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,890
Quiet!
I just might have to do that!

1035
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,992
And if they ask if there were
any boys in your group...

1036
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,328
...say no, only girls.

1037
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,901
Bas only your mother will
understand that Son

1038
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,744
That you have been given values

1039
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,317
And you will never
betray my trust.

1040
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:33,611
Mom

1041
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,423
Do you know why the divorce rate
is getting so high in India?

1042
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,515
Why son?

1043
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,662
Because most of the mothers
tell their daughters...

1044
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,525
...how to lie in such matrimonial
meetings.

1045
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,832
Well it's not easy finding
good boys...

1046
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,764
...like your brothers these days...

1047
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:49,462
Try finding one for yourself!
Then you will realize!

1048
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,741
Babyji, I think Simran is right!

1049
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,273
But you know how difficult
it is to find good boys?

1050
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,974
She will. Like you did.

1051
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,244
Don't add petrol to my fire.

1052
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,882
I am already furious.
Preeti has become so bold.

1053
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,984
She does what she wants. Karan has
given her too much freedom.

1054
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,790
The other one has vanished
and Simran doesn't...

1055
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,590
...like any of the boys that come.

1056
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,731
I mean how much more can I take?

1057
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,663
I don't have any importance
any longer!

1058
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,268
No, it is not so.

1059
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,996
Junior, see who has come.

1060
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,845
First congratulate me.

1061
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:31,969
Congratulations...

1062
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:33,671
Kanwal?

1063
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,352
Kanwal and Amrita enter frame.

1064
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,021
Greetings

1065
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,584
Here,
has a simple court marriage...

1066
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:45,853
Amrita... who gurdaspur...

1067
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,896
You know how Jeeji was
after my life...

1068
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,463
So we went to Gurdaspur and...

1069
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:50,998
She is from Gurdaspur, you know.

1070
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,256
Cheat, huh?

1071
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,560
Congratulations.
Congratulations -I am so happy...

1072
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:58,398
You finally took the step that
you should have taken long ago

1073
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,736
Welcome.

1074
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,440
But he said he could never
find somebody like you.

1075
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,582
Oh, he is mad!
He has found a better one.

1076
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,448
Thank you
- By the way, I have been cheated.

1077
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,623
Why? - Now I will have to
pick up milk packets...

1078
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,886
...vegetables and cinema
tickets for my wife?

1079
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,428
You will go. - Oh, so do it.

1080
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,419
Sit, sit.

1081
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,261
I will be back.

1082
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,291
Sit.

1083
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,497
What will you have... Buttermilk?

1084
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,334
Oh kid, bring Buttermilk.

1085
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,756
So Kanwal, you've decided to
stay in gurdaspur, is it?

1086
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,017
Ya, less pollution.
The redness of cheeks will remain.

1087
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,554
You know, the pink cheeks.

1088
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:56,424
Kanwal's mother gave
these to my Granny

1089
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,394
When she came from Pakistan,
to sell them.

1090
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,761
Granny left them with me,
so that I could return them.

1091
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:08,300
I thought I would give them to
Simran when she married Preet,

1092
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,576
This boy just won't get married.

1093
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:12,673
But I'm so glad...

1094
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,411
...I finally gave them to the
one who deserves them.

1095
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,411
Thank you very much.

1096
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,380
Sit.

1097
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:28,886
You know baby,

1098
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,425
You should take Baby
as inspiration,

1099
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,271
You will really learn a lot.

1100
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,337
What are you saying? - Why?

1101
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,910
He'll do the same.

1102
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,639
Be quiet! Insulating me in
front of the new bride!

1103
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:47,571
Oye, Arjun... ready?

1104
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:57,581
Mummyji,

1105
01:04:58,427 --> 01:04:59,416
Why are you crying?

1106
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,453
He is just going to Ludhiana
to do his MD!

1107
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,793
He would have gone to America
if that wretched...

1108
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,459
...had not done a fake marriage.

1109
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,631
I thought only Indian
girls were fake...

1110
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,530
But NRIs wee...

1111
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,272
You don't worry, Arjun son

1112
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,271
You work hard and I will find
another NRI wife for you.

1113
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,412
This time a doctor from UK.

1114
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,915
Don't do that Mummyji... Please...

1115
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,985
Jeena? What are you doing here?

1116
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,253
I'm back mummyji.

1117
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:37,298
You are back?
What have you come for now?

1118
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,991
To return our Jewellery and gifts?

1119
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:40,992
You conscience pricked you!

1120
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,701
I have nothing to return
Mummyji because...

1121
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,398
...William and Tina duped me.

1122
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,703
Your parents duped you?

1123
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:51,210
Yes, right, now you have another
story to tell, isn't it?

1124
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,444
No she isn't.

1125
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,274
She's speaking the truth.

1126
01:05:57,053 --> 01:06:01,456
Thanks Dad. If it wasn't for you
I would have lost everything

1127
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,348
Wait. What are you saying?

1128
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,791
Involving my husband in your
fake marriage racket?

1129
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:10,695
I admit I was playing a game
with William and Tina.

1130
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,535
We run a travel agency and
we thought of this plan.

1131
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,339
But when I went back I started
missing Arjun...

1132
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,833
And you all.

1133
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,446
Then I confessed to my parents
and they threw...

1134
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,208
...me out of the house
for a few weeks.

1135
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,307
But then my Dad took me back
because I fell ill.

1136
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,253
And who do you think planned
it all babyji?

1137
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:33,978
Your Bhalla sir...

1138
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,855
The man from the marriage bureau!

1139
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,585
How do we know she is
telling the truth?

1140
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,991
Look, when her father called me
to find the boy his uncle...

1141
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,730
You know her father?
- Yes, he's an old friend of mine.

1142
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,733
Ravi is a surgeon and has
a clinic in New York.

1143
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,902
At least it's a family of doctors.

1144
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,238
I am not one Mummyji,
but please forgive me...

1145
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:54,002
I will live as your humble
servant, Mummyji

1146
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,902
Move aside!
You will make me a maid.

1147
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:59,481
Babyji, she takes after
you... melodramatic!

1148
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,648
Mom, your problem is English,
hers is Hindi

1149
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,877
Don't take her side.

1150
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:08,423
Babyji, now let's forgive
and forget Babyji.

1151
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,790
Tries to be Indian!

1152
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,727
Learn to wear veil...

1153
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,892
C'mon, I hope we live like
one big happy family, huh?

1154
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,236
But I've got Arjun's papers and
we can fly back any time.

1155
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:26,202
Aini door?

1156
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:28,367
Mom...
you only wanted me to go to USA.

1157
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,537
And I'll make your dream
come true, Mummyji.

1158
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:45,951
Come

1159
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,352
Wait, wait, wait

1160
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:50,821
What?

1161
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,862
Oh my God! I forgot the keys,

1162
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:59,273
And Mom and everybody else is at
sister-in-law's mom's place...

1163
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,307
I'm sorry.

1164
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:01,633
It's ok...

1165
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,679
What the heck...

1166
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,148
It's just that,
It's so quiet here.

1167
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,213
Let me add some music to it.

1168
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,333
Babyji,

1169
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,236
You are still upset
about last night?

1170
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,437
Yes, and it is not because
of your snoring!

1171
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,975
Can you imagine,
our son and daughter

1172
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,648
In -Law dancing in the drive...

1173
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,308
That too in Chandigarh!

1174
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,853
I know... Kids...

1175
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:56,781
I... I did speak with Arjun and
he's very apologetic about it.

1176
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,887
First that 'Thorn' song
and now this 'Kohl'.

1177
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,293
Bollywood has spread this
commotion. - That Simran...

1178
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:03,865
...she always says chandigarh
girls...

1179
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,433
...make it very big in bollywood.

1180
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,660
She's out of her mind!

1181
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,498
Babyji,
you could have made it very...

1182
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,630
...big in bollywood yourself...

1183
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:15,335
Let it be... - Drink tea...

1184
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:20,604
Really...

1185
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,813
Let it be.

1186
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,590
You know girls get into
trouble chatting...

1187
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,592
...on the net and so will
Mummyji one day...

1188
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,855
Yes... I've heard she chats
with hunks online?

1189
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:38,024
This portal is not for crazy chat
sister-in-law. - It's serious.

1190
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,894
And this one seems
just right for me.

1191
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,599
Know each other very well,
and he will be coming next month...

1192
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,833
But you know nothing
about him Simran.

1193
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,603
Yes... its so risky.

1194
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,269
Chill girls. We have done
enough of soul searching,

1195
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,815
All that remains is just
one look to decide...

1196
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,645
...whether we can stay
together or not.

1197
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,416
Okay! - Cheers!!!

1198
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:03,749
Mummy ji, I have heard she is
a find husband on computer...

1199
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,756
Shut up, its a gossip.

1200
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,394
Look Mummyji, really!

1201
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,397
I have seen Simran with so many...

1202
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,330
...boys' pictures on the computer,

1203
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:13,594
Staring at them.

1204
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,465
Muniya,
stop gossiping about me to Mum.

1205
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:16,593
Look, I don't care.

1206
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:20,241
You come here, you talk to me
first! - You have lost your mind?

1207
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:21,866
You will try and find
your own husband?

1208
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:25,778
I mean internet is okay for chats,
but to find real husband?

1209
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,282
Mom, I know exactly what
I am looking for and I...

1210
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,249
...am sure you will be very
happy with my choice.

1211
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,786
Son, there could be fakes also.

1212
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,889
Mom, so many of my friends, they
got married through net only

1213
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,993
And they are so happily settled!

1214
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,589
C'mon. So go...

1215
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,225
Internet...

1216
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,293
It was a good idea
to come to rock...

1217
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:48,631
...garden for a change. - Lovely

1218
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,604
But baby, I tell you, our life
has also become like rock!

1219
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:55,776
Lo! - In life no fun.
Same routine everyday, I tell you.

1220
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:56,900
Oh, got bored?

1221
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,480
You want something new? - Yes!!

1222
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:03,651
C'mon, lets rock and have
a girls' night out

1223
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,284
I know of a real hot disco!

1224
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,221
Oh ho... Bouncer will be hot?

1225
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,585
And they did not even
come back with me

1226
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,487
Here they are. Must be them

1227
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,652
Oh! Sorry mom, mom

1228
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:12,731
Sorry...

1229
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,731
Mummyji please let us all explain.

1230
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,771
What is there for you
all to explain?

1231
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,731
I'm not against anyone having
a good time once in a while.

1232
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:24,334
I myself had a blast.
That's what you say, blast.

1233
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,477
But turning our respectable
family...

1234
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,413
...restaurant into
a disco at night?

1235
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:29,642
We'll lose our respect!

1236
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,343
People will say they
run nightclub...

1237
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,551
But Babyji, what were you
doing there at this time?

1238
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:35,588
You be quiet!

1239
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:38,660
I don't understand, why such a
big deal of going to a disco?

1240
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,853
Oh ho sweetheart,
the problem is, we run the disc.

1241
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,931
And this American influence...
spoiling my son's character now!

1242
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,427
We'll leave.
We can see this shame later.

1243
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:47,865
Mom, just chill!

1244
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,698
You will be chilled.
Wear yourjacket.

1245
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,567
Ma just running a simple
restaurant is...

1246
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:52,970
...not going to get us
enough business.

1247
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,572
And that is important
for my husband.

1248
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,906
Oh ho, husband...
And your husband...

1249
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:00,014
He was my son before he became
your husband... husband...

1250
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,148
Mom and Dad also agrees

1251
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,175
You know about this?

1252
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,512
Wow!

1253
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,391
You will enter territory
but you will...

1254
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,688
...not make bank account
joint with me.

1255
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,790
You have ditched me... - You are a

1256
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,263
Tray... tray... trr... trrr...

1257
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,960
babyji I'm not a traitor.

1258
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,564
And kids, they are just trying
to earn a little more money,

1259
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,707
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

1260
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,640
I told you not to wear
such clothes... C'mon

1261
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:33,739
She's the limit!

1262
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,917
Jeena has more liberty than me

1263
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,482
And why doesn't she do anything
about that daughter of hers?

1264
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:42,716
Sweetie! Calm down. With time
you will adjust to Mummyji.

1265
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:44,957
You know she doesn't
mean any harm.

1266
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,928
Look you three men can
adjust with her.

1267
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,595
I am not going to take it anymore!

1268
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:51,964
I have heard you saying the same...

1269
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,599
...thing to your mom so many times.

1270
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,735
But you took it for 23 years,
right?

1271
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,732
Now just because Mummyji
is not your own mom,

1272
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,670
You can't take it anymore.

1273
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:03,604
You may have a point there

1274
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,941
But, did you see the way she was
dancing and taking shots.

1275
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,479
She was scandalized by my dance...

1276
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,783
My dance was nothing compared
to what she was doing.

1277
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,183
She's my mom.

1278
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:22,923
He dad siting hear.

1279
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,891
Hi dad! - Hi...

1280
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:32,971
You guys are early today. Huh?

1281
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,936
Yes, we decided not to
go to Anil's place.

1282
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:36,705
Sunna it's a boring affair.

1283
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,836
Dad, you seem to be having fun.
Beer sheer and all?

1284
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:41,304
Mom is not at home?

1285
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:42,708
You guessed right boy!

1286
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,679
She's gone with those
two irritating...

1287
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,413
...friends of hers to
some exhibition.

1288
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,244
Beer?

1289
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:50,982
No dad. - Dad,
you know no... Last night, mom...

1290
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,318
I know, I know friend.
She was a bit harsh on you guys.

1291
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:55,953
But then you know,
she's just concerned about you.

1292
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,323
Ya dad, but we are grown ups now.

1293
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,333
I know, but she doesn't even
think that I have grown up.

1294
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,199
I mean, she does 'Be Quiet' to
every thing I have to say!

1295
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:06,139
But, she embarrasses us in front
of our wives too dad.

1296
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:07,536
This is nothing, Jeena,

1297
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,841
She thinks that both of
us are in nappies and...

1298
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,404
Simran is in a sari!

1299
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,146
But seriously son...

1300
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:18,183
Your mother really wants
to protect you from...

1301
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,844
...you know,
anything doing you harm.

1302
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,350
But the problem is she doesn't
realize which is more harmful.

1303
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:28,262
I mean fussing over you or letting
you lead your own lives.

1304
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:31,592
This is so typical of all
the punjabi mother.

1305
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:35,394
Even my mom,
Granny, she fussed over me.

1306
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:37,669
But I thought once I'm married...

1307
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,604
...I will be able to
lead my own life...

1308
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,730
But no sir!!!

1309
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,844
Then came along your mom,
and she fussed over me even more.

1310
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,504
You see...

1311
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,249
Much as women crib about
their lives with men...

1312
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,382
There is no escape for men either.

1313
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,553
We'll miss you

1314
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:58,258
We'll miss you too

1315
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,185
Come soon to meet us...

1316
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:03,326
Remember, Chandigarh is your home.

1317
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,534
Junior, see who has come.

1318
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:20,712
Ah! Hello

1319
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:22,672
Hello?

1320
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:24,975
Hello... - Can I help you?

1321
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,549
Uh, Sir... Baby

1322
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:28,355
Oh! Courier?

1323
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,952
Uh, no, no, I'm not a courier
guy. - In fact I want to meet Baby.

1324
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,721
She's completely changed
my life sir.

1325
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,287
I found her IP address and
then traced this address,

1326
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,999
Just to meet her once!
Just this once. Where is she?

1327
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:41,332
Ah...
did you meet her on a dating site?

1328
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:45,906
Ya. Actually I did. You
must be her dad, right?

1329
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:47,363
No I am not.

1330
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,402
Has she called you home? - She
said I could drop in here anytime.

1331
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,707
She's a wonderful girl Sir,
wonderful, wonderful.

1332
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:55,745
Lighted up and delighted
up my life!

1333
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:57,942
How can Babyji dare to do this!

1334
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,615
And they even speak
the same English!

1335
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,814
Sir, I just couldn't control
myself... I had to meet her,

1336
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,449
Just this once. Please call her...

1337
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,549
Who has come?

1338
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:07,787
Well... uhhh...

1339
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,786
Who is he? - My wife.

1340
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,831
Oh! Hello Aunty -Hello.

1341
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,560
I am actually here to see Baby.

1342
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,230
I'm Baby, what do you want?

1343
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:19,234
You... you... you? You are Baby?

1344
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,276
Of course you must be. You look
as delightful as you write.

1345
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:24,840
So happy and full of energy!

1346
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,680
I am Salman, Salman Khan?

1347
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,841
Oh! From the Bollywooddates. Com?

1348
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,311
Oh I see. Sit, sit, sit.

1349
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:35,283
Thank you,
thank you so much aunty...

1350
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,251
Will you stop calling me aunty!

1351
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,459
Oh! I'm sorry... - These are for you

1352
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,550
Thank you.

1353
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:42,755
Thank you so much for everything
you've done for me.

1354
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:45,264
You've changed my entire life.
- You saved my life...

1355
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,460
...my home, my unborn children
from becoming orphans.

1356
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,770
I am so glad. Suicide is a
very bad thing you know.

1357
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,464
I told you she would... - Excuse me!

1358
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,533
Can you explain what's going on?

1359
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,274
Uh, let me explain sir...

1360
01:21:56,745 --> 01:22:00,306
Rahul, Rahul Sharma.
Salman Khan is just my chat name.

1361
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,776
You know sir, people who come
on these online dating chats,

1362
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:03,976
Most of them are Ionely...

1363
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,914
...like me and then, every now
and then, Maam comes online,

1364
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,923
She helps us, reasons with us.
- She makes a difference Sir...

1365
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,652
...she makes a difference
to our lives.

1366
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:16,327
You know,
my wife, lovely as she is,

1367
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,557
She was nagging me to death sir.

1368
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,759
I wanted to kill myselfjust
because of her harassment...

1369
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,267
Sounds very familiar...

1370
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:26,399
Right?
Bas then maam came into my life.

1371
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,366
I met her online and she
made me see the truth.

1372
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:32,608
Like she says Happiness
is a state of mind...

1373
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,406
So true ma'am...
so true! - Moreover, Sir...

1374
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,449
...another friend of mine...

1375
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,018
...he was having a problem
with his job.

1376
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,254
You know his colleagues and all,
in fighting.

1377
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:41,787
Maam actually found
him anotherjob.

1378
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,587
Now he's happy.
You are so wonderful.

1379
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:46,455
You are great, aunty... uh...

1380
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,797
Baby...
uhh... sorry, ma'am! - And Babyji...

1381
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:52,867
...all this while I thought you
were chatting with young men...

1382
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:54,625
What are you saying!

1383
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,330
Do you thing at this age
can I be so naughty?

1384
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,235
But you are naughty babyji...

1385
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:01,733
Be quiet.

1386
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,438
What will you have?
Tea, coffee or sweets?

1387
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,673
Uh, as much as I'd love it,
not this time ma'am.

1388
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:10,281
Actually my lovely wife
is waiting for me.

1389
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,780
I'm taking her out on a date.

1390
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,444
Now your wife has become lovely!

1391
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,283
You know,
she's wondering how come...

1392
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,755
...I love her so much nowadays...

1393
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,222
But I haven't told her my
secret & I haven't...

1394
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,794
...told her about my
secret net friend.

1395
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:24,265
Ma'am, continue going online,
continue helping people.

1396
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,193
Nowadays who has the
time to listen...

1397
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:27,598
...to other people's problems.

1398
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:28,794
Ok young man,

1399
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:30,464
Our regards to your wife.

1400
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,666
Certainly.
And if your wife nags you a lot,

1401
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:38,207
Come online, I'll help you...
- Thanks so much.

1402
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,016
Babyji? - Yes?

1403
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,350
Proud of you. - Thank you

1404
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:50,282
What is the matter, brother!
Pizza, cake. What's the occasion?

1405
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:51,881
You tell them.

1406
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,392
What is the matter, son?

1407
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,656
If it's about money,
ask your father!

1408
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:01,263
Mum... Dad, we have some news.

1409
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,163
What?

1410
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,532
You're going to be
grandparents soon

1411
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:10,741
Really... Oh! That's great.
- Wonderful! I am so happy.

1412
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:12,504
Come here son.

1413
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:17,984
Thank you son. Its going to be
a beautiful child I am sure.

1414
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:19,776
I can see it in your face.

1415
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,513
There is something else... - Twins?

1416
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,351
Ah Mummyji, dad...

1417
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:29,887
Arjun have been online
for past few weeks

1418
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:31,857
And it seems Karan can
make a lot of money...

1419
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:33,661
...in USA if he starts
a restaurant there.

1420
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,267
Arjun's father-in-law
has promised to help.

1421
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,402
Are you trying to say that you
want to migrate to U. S?

1422
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:44,242
Yes dad and we found a buyer
for Million Dollars too.

1423
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,542
You want to leave us?

1424
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,509
Nobody is leaving anybody, Ma.

1425
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,781
We are just trying to make
our lives better.

1426
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,885
I don't want my children to grow
in this small town when...

1427
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:57,253
...my brother's children go
to Harvard and Wharton.

1428
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,451
There will be so many cultural
differences Pa.

1429
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:20,970
Okay, son.

1430
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,551
You are big now.
Make your own lives.

1431
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:27,783
When do you want to go?

1432
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,864
Don't worry Mummyji,
we'll go after Simran's marriage.

1433
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,559
Thank you son.

1434
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,238
Some more pizza, mom?

1435
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:49,004
No, son. I am full.

1436
01:25:59,154 --> 01:25:59,620
Dad.

1437
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:13,367
Medicine

1438
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,242
Don't take it to heart Mummyji.

1439
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,649
All sons have to go away someday.

1440
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:39,255
And I thought only daughters
left their parents' homes.

1441
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,592
My Karan Arjun will
be so far away.

1442
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:48,835
Wherever the children may be,

1443
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:53,301
What is important is that
they should love you.

1444
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:56,769
There should be love.

1445
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,879
That is all that matters.

1446
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,942
What is the use of staying
under the same roof

1447
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:06,913
If the children are
indifferent and...

1448
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:08,815
...they keep fighting with you.

1449
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,317
You are luckier than most
parents Mummyji.

1450
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:16,793
Your children love you.

1451
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,429
Muniya! You are very sensitive.

1452
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,263
I have seen the insides
of many homes Mummyji...

1453
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:27,800
Except for mine.

1454
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,944
Never got to love my parents.

1455
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,611
Don't even know who they are

1456
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:41,447
Bring it.

1457
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,598
Someone's with her.

1458
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,562
Are you nervous? - No I'm not!

1459
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:22,685
Sure?

1460
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:24,220
I'm sure.

1461
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:26,531
And I'm sure that mom's
going to love you.

1462
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:28,427
And what about Dad?

1463
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:30,731
Don't worry sweetheart!
He's darn cool... Come...

1464
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:31,861
Hope So!

1465
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,776
Hi Mum... Hi dad

1466
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:39,876
Greetings ji. - Greetings
- Greetings son... - Sit, sit

1467
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:40,970
Sit.

1468
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:45,651
You didn't introduce.

1469
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:47,414
I'm Vikramjeet Singh.

1470
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,353
Classmate ho?

1471
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,982
Actually, Simran and I met
on the net few months ago.

1472
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:54,617
Net?

1473
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:58,557
Internet.
First we didn't get along.

1474
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:01,292
But then we became
very good friends.

1475
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,133
I thought,
basically, she's a spoilt brat

1476
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,769
But later I came to know that she
is a beautiful human being.

1477
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:12,238
Oh she is... - She needs to mature
a lot but I must say that

1478
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:14,440
She's the one for me.

1479
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,777
Well, If you feel you two
are good for each other...

1480
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:18,645
Then what can we say?

1481
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,488
My parents asked me to take
permission from you.

1482
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:23,517
That's what they say...

1483
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:25,751
You have to do it...

1484
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:29,262
Where do your parents live?

1485
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:31,762
United States of America.

1486
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,560
Oh no, not Simran also...

1487
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:38,565
What? - Nothing son, nothing.
So son, what do you do?

1488
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,305
I am a software engineer...

1489
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:44,440
He's handsome.
Do you like the boy?

1490
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:54,220
Son, if Simran is happy,
we are happy too.

1491
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,715
I think you will be good
for our daughter.

1492
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:58,826
When can your parents
come for the wedding?

1493
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:02,418
Whenever you say.

1494
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,458
Tell me.

1495
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:42,432
Arjun and Jeena should
be here any moment.

1496
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:44,300
But they'll stay over here,
only for a week.

1497
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:45,804
Never mind. But they have come.

1498
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:49,242
Baby you will be free after
Simran's marriage

1499
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,504
But both your betas and
your daughters in law.

1500
01:30:51,646 --> 01:30:54,308
And Simran will also go far away.

1501
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:57,274
Yes and that makes
you happy for me?

1502
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:59,549
We three are such good
friends but we keep...

1503
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:00,985
...taunting each other
all the time.

1504
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,258
And to say our friendship
is all that we have.

1505
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:07,759
You know, I am just not used to
staying without my Simran...

1506
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:09,394
Oh baby...

1507
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:31,800
babyji,

1508
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:33,971
Please don't cry.

1509
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:36,806
It's an auspicious occasion.

1510
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:38,810
I know...

1511
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:41,583
But, isn't it strange

1512
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:44,951
That when you are parting
from your only daughter...

1513
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:47,254
...they call it an auspicious
occasion?

1514
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:50,422
Dad...

1515
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,531
Mom, I've just realized that

1516
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:58,932
I was the one who was
to get estranged...

1517
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:00,965
I have to go...

1518
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:13,580
Babyji, what are you thinking?

1519
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:18,290
I hate to see these
packed suitcases.

1520
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:22,894
It's such a stark reminder
of reality!

1521
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,760
The day has finally come...

1522
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:29,696
Our children are going...

1523
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:33,405
Such is life...

1524
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:35,931
There...

1525
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:45,249
I wish Vikram had stayed
a couple of days.

1526
01:33:45,386 --> 01:33:46,683
I know dad.

1527
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:50,885
And I suppose you won't be coming
back for your delivery?

1528
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:53,623
The child would be a
natural citizen...

1529
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:55,025
...if he is born in US, Mummyji.

1530
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:57,361
Yes? - Ya, that's true.

1531
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,457
So when do we get
to see you again?

1532
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:02,725
Christmas?

1533
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:07,338
Or when your children want
to know who their...

1534
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:09,500
...grandparents are and
what they look like?

1535
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:19,319
I think, we'd better start
for the airport now.

1536
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,543
Come on.

1537
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:24,514
Come on... come my girl

1538
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,550
Junior, bring Samaan along...

1539
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:39,233
I've got some ice cream
for the children.

1540
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,371
It must be very hot for them here.

1541
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,942
Keep in fridge.

1542
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:47,873
You know I enjoy cooking
but I miss Muniya.

1543
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:51,710
Nice girl.
I'm glad she got married...

1544
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:53,008
Made her life.

1545
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:56,017
Yeah! After creating havoc
in other people's lives.

1546
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:00,392
Yes, if carrot pudding is ready,

1547
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,826
Can the Grandfather have some?

1548
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:05,456
You are very excited right?

1549
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:07,533
So are you babyji...

1550
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,804
You must be dying to tell all
your stories to the children.

1551
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:14,201
But don't make fun of my English
in front of them, okay?

1552
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,336
Ok -Promise?

1553
01:35:16,677 --> 01:35:17,666
Promise?

1554
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:30,223
You just wait.
- What happened? Come here.

1555
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:32,292
He has ruined my house.

1556
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:34,584
They have turned the whole
house upside down.

1557
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:37,490
They have broken the crystal,
they've dirtied the sofas.

1558
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:38,997
These daughters in law
have not taught...

1559
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:41,325
...these children any manners.
- And that Simran?

1560
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:43,300
She's too busy meeting
her friends.

1561
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,235
Left her 6 months
old baby with me.

1562
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:47,566
I had to clean all the nappies.
Wow!

1563
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:51,303
She couldn't even buy medicine for
loose motions for the baby.

1564
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:52,742
Everyone takes advantage of me.

1565
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,643
Bas Mummyji has to do everything.

1566
01:35:55,716 --> 01:35:56,705
But Babyji,

1567
01:35:57,551 --> 01:35:59,348
You're going to miss them
once they are gone.

1568
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:01,853
No I won't. I want some peace.

1569
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:05,456
And don't play cricket on the
lawns. You will spoil my grass.

1570
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:07,956
Do you understand? I will beat you

1571
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,656
Okay Granny!

1572
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:11,862
Granny! Granny can't say this

1573
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,696
Go, go to your mothers...

1574
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:16,834
Come on.
You have got on my nerves!

1575
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:26,437
Junior, let it be.

1576
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:28,805
There is still time
for them to go.

1577
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,613
It feels good to know that
we have a large family.

1578
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,322
The house looks full.

1579
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,755
Wonder when we will
see them again.

1580
01:36:43,998 --> 01:36:47,798
Ya babyji, and we are not
getting any younger...

1581
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,767
We'll make a move, dad.

1582
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:56,840
Enough, son, it's time...

1583
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:58,410
I will bring it outside.

1584
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,675
We are a go-give it to me.

1585
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:02,404
He mom. Don't cry.

1586
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:05,685
Junior, bring the bags

1587
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,820
Let's go. We will be going home.

1588
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:15,188
Bye Ma, Dad...

1589
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:17,691
That's a good shoot. Thanks

1590
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:20,823
Take care.

1591
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:05,310
Will you have some tea?

1592
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:07,839
No, Babyji. Thank you.

1593
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:09,399
Who do you want to
chat with babyji?

1594
01:39:10,844 --> 01:39:12,903
The children haven't even reached
the airport as yet...

1595
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:18,215
Let me see if anybody else in
this world is feeling Ionely.

1596
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:21,418
I can give them company.

1597
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,516
I am Ionely today...

1598
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:28,325
You can give me company...

1599
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:31,920
Come

1600
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:10,416
Children must have come for,
the funeral.

1601
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:15,518
They could not get the tickets.

1602
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,220
It's tourists' season.

1603
01:47:19,499 --> 01:47:22,559
And these days tickets
are also expensive.

1604
01:47:24,004 --> 01:47:28,338
And then the doctor said not to
keep the body for very long.

1605
01:47:33,747 --> 01:47:34,736
Baby,

1606
01:47:35,482 --> 01:47:37,450
Why don't you come and stay
with us for a few days...

1607
01:47:37,551 --> 01:47:38,540
...in Gurdaspur

1608
01:47:38,885 --> 01:47:40,876
I can't leave the house Jeeji.

1609
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:44,218
Junior has gone to his village.
His mother was not well.

1610
01:47:44,991 --> 01:47:47,789
And you know Muniya,
She got married and went away.

1611
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:50,763
Now, even my diary is finished.

1612
01:47:51,631 --> 01:47:53,223
Nothing to write anymore.

1613
01:47:54,835 --> 01:47:57,201
You can always stay with Karan
and Arjun sometimes.

1614
01:47:58,338 --> 01:47:59,965
They should have some time.

1615
01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:02,202
Busy.

1616
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:04,900
They are all working people.

1617
01:48:05,612 --> 01:48:08,410
I don't want to disturb
their life jeeji.

1618
01:48:09,683 --> 01:48:12,709
The kids love you.

1619
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:28,331
Hello. I am Gulati. - Hello...

1620
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:30,300
I'm here to meet Mrs. Arora.

1621
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,206
Greetings. - Greetings

1622
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:37,332
I'm Gulati.

1623
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:38,535
Sit.

1624
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:44,847
I am sorry to hear about Rajinder.

1625
01:48:48,688 --> 01:48:50,849
He had his account in our bank
for the last 30 years...

1626
01:48:52,993 --> 01:48:54,221
What a wonderful man.

1627
01:48:56,997 --> 01:49:00,125
Is there... is there anything
I can do for you ma'am?

1628
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:05,394
Thank you for your concern.

1629
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:10,502
I hate to say this but Baby,

1630
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:13,135
Do you have the succession
certificate?

1631
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:17,514
I mean how do, we transfer
the accounts in her name.

1632
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:19,541
In her name?

1633
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,245
But the accounts always
were in joint names

1634
01:49:22,522 --> 01:49:25,423
And she being the survivor
can operate them anytime.

1635
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:41,632
This Rajinder...

1636
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:44,240
God bless your soul...

1637
01:49:44,878 --> 01:49:45,970
I miss you...

1638
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:47,435
Miss you old man.

1639
01:49:54,354 --> 01:49:56,822
Have transferred twenty thousand
dollars to your account.

1640
01:49:57,424 --> 01:49:59,255
If there is anything else
please let me know.

1641
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:01,521
Preeti is cooking all
the dishes from...

1642
01:50:01,628 --> 01:50:02,993
...the recipe book you gave her.

1643
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:04,661
And she getting better.

1644
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:08,291
Now they bought this beautiful
house by the river-side

1645
01:50:08,868 --> 01:50:10,631
And we are having a barbeque
this week-end.

1646
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:13,463
Karan and Sylvania is coming
with the kids as well

1647
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,400
Wish you could be with us.

1648
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:19,000
Now Dipen has got a new job.

1649
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:21,342
And Seque has started
his pre-school.

1650
01:50:21,715 --> 01:50:23,205
And he really misses his grandma

1651
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:25,240
Yesterday I was thinking of Daddy

1652
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:26,677
I miss him a lot.

1653
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:28,981
We will surely come next winter.

1654
01:50:34,728 --> 01:50:35,854
Babyji...

1655
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:44,359
babyji...

1656
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:02,210
babyji...

1657
01:51:04,224 --> 01:51:06,988
You? You have come back from Hell?

1658
01:51:09,562 --> 01:51:12,190
Heaven babyji, not Hell.

1659
01:51:12,766 --> 01:51:14,256
What difference does it make?

1660
01:51:14,934 --> 01:51:16,697
I am left alone.

1661
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:22,469
The children are so far away and
busy with their own lives.

1662
01:51:23,877 --> 01:51:26,311
I am not happy anymore.

1663
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:30,581
Babyji,
Happiness is the state of mind.

1664
01:51:31,618 --> 01:51:32,607
Your words.

1665
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,789
I miss you... Please come back.

1666
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:39,017
I am always with you babyji.

1667
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,019
But what is this,

1668
01:51:41,728 --> 01:51:43,628
Why have you stopped
colouring your hair?

1669
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:47,595
And I don't like these white,
dull clothes on you.

1670
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:50,833
Babyji, vibrant colours suit you...

1671
01:51:50,937 --> 01:51:53,565
...like,
yellow, blue, green, orange.

1672
01:51:54,574 --> 01:51:56,633
These are the colours
that really suit you.

1673
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:00,640
No, without you, I must
wear only white ji...

1674
01:52:01,815 --> 01:52:04,545
But you have become colorful now...

1675
01:52:05,452 --> 01:52:06,817
You have become very colorful.

1676
01:52:07,287 --> 01:52:09,380
When there are no colors
left in my life.

1677
01:52:10,457 --> 01:52:12,288
But you have to move with
the world, right?

1678
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:15,753
But I feel very Ionely and old.

1679
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:18,296
Yes,
I don't feel like doing anything.

1680
01:52:18,431 --> 01:52:19,898
C'mon Babyji...

1681
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:23,468
Heart should be young!
Forget the age!

1682
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,540
You have started speaking
good Punjabi.

1683
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:29,433
Who have you been meeting
up there...

1684
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:31,009
...that you speak such
good Punjabi now?

1685
01:52:34,447 --> 01:52:35,641
Oh, get up, dear...

1686
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:38,744
Life doesn't stop for
people who are alone.

1687
01:52:39,686 --> 01:52:41,711
Health is wealth.

1688
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:43,881
You are right.

1689
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:46,719
And I have to move with the world,
right...

1690
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:49,620
Then get up my girl and move!

1691
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:56,024
My colorful,
delightful, wonderful Mummyji.

1692
01:52:58,071 --> 01:52:59,402
Listen.

1693
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:03,173
You are looking great.

1694
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:46,714
Pratap Singh you are very slow.
Give me my juice!

1695
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:03,430
And who do you love the more
- Mummyji.
