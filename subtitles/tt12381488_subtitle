1
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,129
'Hi Sandeep, what are you
deep in thought about?'

2
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:36,489
When we are in love
it is just the 2 of us

3
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,829
But our future
if we get married...

4
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,169
...our families play an important role

5
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,729
I was able to give you
everything as a lover but-

6
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:46,689
As your husband, to give you
the safety net of a family

7
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,079
I don't have anyone

8
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,726
Listen, Sandeep

9
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:52,904
The love you shower
on me as a single man

10
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,729
...no big family can substitute

11
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:57,794
I'm always there for you
Don't ever say you don't have anyone

12
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,649
From now on, it isn't you and me

13
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:01,849
It is us, 'we'

14
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:05,184
We are 'family'

15
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:07,064
We don't need anyone else

16
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:08,704
I am happy with
just you in my life

17
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,089
Let us get married

18
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,809
Cheers!
I love you

19
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,089
I love you too

20
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,184
"Thanks to you and only you"

21
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,249
"I am alive, my love so true"

22
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:57,759
"Won't you come to me, dear?
My heart is yours forever sincere"

23
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,639
"My dear soul, stay with me, here"

24
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:07,333
"Every moment in time
I spend with you sublime"

25
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:12,373
"Belongs to me when you are mine"

26
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,093
"This bond with you like this"

27
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:21,478
"You and I all these days in bliss"

28
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,798
"My eyes consider it a blessing
to see you again and again, darling"

29
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:31,318
"I can't be without you, never
You are my equal half forever"

30
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:36,358
"My mind knows that is totally true
My thoughts will never go beyond you"

31
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:41,438
"Each and every memory treasured
Swirls only around you, rest assured"

32
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:18,512
Sunil

33
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:20,897
Sunil, pass me the auto sys file

34
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:22,745
Thanks

35
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:51,402
Sunil, backup of the auto sys files
and extension files are on my desktop

36
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:55,090
Dude, this is your presentation
at the meeting, why give it to me now?

37
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:58,115
- I've got a lunch date I can't miss
- Lunch date, huh?

38
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:00,434
- With Vandana?
- No, bro

39
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:01,569
With Shruthi

40
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:06,274
We know you love your wife very much
but why miss this important meeting?

41
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,019
Today is our wedding anniversary

42
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,844
- Congrats, man
- Thank you

43
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,029
But I forgot about it this morning

44
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:15,291
You can be punished in any which way!

45
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:18,116
She didn't punish me
Just wanted a lunch date

46
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:21,421
- If I don't go now, imagine my fate then?
- Don't say another word

47
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,618
A date is a lesser punishment
than a divorce, bro

48
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,483
- Go, I'll take care
- Thanks

49
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,516
And by the way convey my wishes to Shruthi

50
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,181
- Sure
- Enjoy your lunch, bro

51
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:38,998
Not picking my call

52
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,305
- Drive faster
- Yes, sir

53
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,130
'From office she has
gone to the restaurant'

54
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,420
Cha! I am late

55
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:49,082
How are you, sir?

56
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:50,915
- Has Shruthi come?
- Not yet

57
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,776
You can take
your regular table

58
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,529
- I'll send the server over
- Yeah, thanks

59
00:04:58,362 --> 00:04:59,802
- Good morning, sir
- Hi

60
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,549
- Hello, sir
- Hi

61
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:13,994
- Greetings, sir
- Hi

62
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,939
Madam will join you I believe

63
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:18,044
Shall I order madam's favorite dish?

64
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,749
- Go ahead
- Okay, sir

65
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:28,882
'Excuse me'

66
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,610
'Sandeep Reddy is here?'

67
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:42,104
Hi Sandeep

68
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:43,211
I'm Rosy

69
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,729
Hi, er-

70
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:47,378
You are?

71
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:48,963
I am Shruthi's colleague

72
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:52,083
Shruthi hasn't come with you?

73
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:53,561
No

74
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,111
She hasn't come?

75
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:58,065
She's busy at work

76
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:04,578
She asked me
to give you this letter

77
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:10,066
Bye

78
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,490
[mobile rings]

79
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,665
Tell me, aunty

80
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:31,056
'Sandeep, where are you?
Come home at once'

81
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:32,641
Why, aunty?
Why do you sound flustered?

82
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,842
'Shruthi is dead'

83
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:47,562
Sir, he is Sandeep

84
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,505
Sandeep, stop right here

85
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:09,074
We haven't finished our investigation

86
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,579
Please try to understand

87
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,316
Sandeep, control yourself

88
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:19,027
- Sandeep
- Shruthi...!

89
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,212
Control yourself

90
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:21,997
- Listen to me
- Sandeep, stop

91
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,507
Sandeep!

92
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,532
Sandeep

93
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:28,447
Control...control

94
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,841
Shruthi...my daughter

95
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,867
Wait

96
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,649
This isn't a natural death

97
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,834
Kindly cooperate
till we complete our investigation

98
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:52,179
Blood is still wet, sir

99
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,364
Approximately 4 hours
since she was murdered

100
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,234
And when she was killed
victim has struggled a lot

101
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,395
Yes, sir

102
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:00,137
Assailant was really strong

103
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:02,042
So you are sure it is a murder?

104
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,501
Of course it's a murder

105
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,229
What was the need for Shruthi
to commit suicide now, aunty?

106
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,605
How do you know it was a suicide?

107
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,949
How can you be so sure
this is a suicide, Sandeep?

108
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,517
Actually today is our
wedding anniversary, sir

109
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:39,973
We wanted to have lunch together

110
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:44,957
Shruthi said she would meet me
directly in the restaurant, sir

111
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:50,228
Maybe she left office early today?

112
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,557
Or maybe she didn't even go to her office?

113
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:55,182
No, sir, she went

114
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:58,047
No, sir, Shruthi madam
didn't go to work today

115
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
She herself told me

116
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,785
I'm not going to work
I've taken off

117
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,550
Take your time
Come in the afternoon

118
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:04,695
Okay, madam

119
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,430
No, sir, look at this proof

120
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,895
She went to work for sure

121
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:16,384
She sent this letter
through her friend for me, sir

122
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,802
Can't stay with you anymore

123
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:22,384
Good

124
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:25,024
So you are in possession
of your wife's suicide note too!

125
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:27,144
It isn't that easy

126
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,475
For her to have slit
her own throat like that

127
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,460
Confirmed, this is murder

128
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:35,002
You didn't commit
this murder, did you?

129
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,757
Is this Shruthi's handwriting?

130
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,984
Yes, it is Shruthi's

131
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:45,864
If the wife dies, automatically
you suspect only the spouse?

132
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:47,824
Why would I murder my Shruthi?

133
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,544
Sir...sir, come with me
just once to the restaurant

134
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,104
Everyone saw that lady
You'll know if you come with me

135
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,584
Come, sir
Please come with me

136
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:04,304
By the way, after all this
why hasn't Sandeep's family come?

137
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:06,861
Sandeep's family is as good as
not being there, sir

138
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:11,406
- That means?
- His dad is a business tycoon in Vizag

139
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,639
Sandeep is very fond of fine arts

140
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,879
Painting, drawing, etc

141
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,786
His dad isn't too keen on art

142
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:21,731
'So he drove Sandeep
out of the house as a kid, sir'

143
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:25,256
As Shruthi's mother I can vouch for him

144
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,689
Sandeep can't be the murderer

145
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:31,481
He can't bear Shruthi being hurt
Even the slightest scratch on her

146
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,119
He would have never done this

147
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:37,569
This is the manager
You can ask him

148
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:40,514
- Manager, was he here today for lunch?
- Of course

149
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,739
- What happened, sir?
- Then a lady in a red dress came

150
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,564
Remember you pointed to me
and sent her over?

151
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:46,985
A lady in a red dress?
Sorry, sir

152
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:48,879
I didn't see anyone like that

153
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,500
Sir, someone has murdered Shruthi

154
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,725
And trying to frame it on me

155
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,799
- Excuse me, sir
- Chintu

156
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:06,904
- Chintu?
- Sir

157
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,969
Remember you ordered a special dish
when I came here for lunch today?

158
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:10,994
Yes, I do, sir

159
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,579
Remember a lady in a red dress
spoke to me after that

160
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,719
Red dress...no, sir
I didn't see anyone

161
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,097
Chintu

162
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,153
Go and attend to your work

163
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:31,304
Something is wrong with you, Mr Sandeep

164
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,201
You seem very disturbed

165
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,786
I know you came here

166
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:36,494
But I didn't see any lady-

167
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,079
What are you saying, sir?

168
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,212
You needn't vouch for me
CCTV is fixed here

169
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:44,397
Sir, check that footage
You'll find out for yourself

170
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,922
Sorry, sir
CC camera isn't working

171
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:48,947
Past 2 weeks we have a technical issue

172
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:52,212
CC camera isn't working?
Lady in a red dress didn't come here?

173
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:56,757
Do you know what a terrible plight I am in
trying to prove I didn't kill my wife?

174
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,782
Sir, please tell them the truth

175
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,799
Why are you protecting
that lady in a red dress?

176
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Is there any link between you
and Shruthi's death?

177
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:09,025
Sandeep!

178
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:12,663
Reason you brought us here is different
from whatever you are saying now

179
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:13,928
You better stop it

180
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:15,438
Listen, Sandeep

181
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:17,703
You can't cast aspersions
on someone like this

182
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:20,008
You are unable to prove your story

183
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:23,177
I'm beginning to suspect you now

184
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,119
If the CC camera was working
you could have seen for yourself, sir

185
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:31,024
Everything seems to
be against me, sir

186
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,369
The victim is my wife, sir

187
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:34,514
Please help me, sir

188
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:35,859
Sorry, Mr Venkat

189
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,564
We seem to have troubled you

190
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,116
Let's move

191
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,274
Sandeep, it would have been ideal
if that lady in red was not fiction

192
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,779
My constables and I are fed up
of running behind criminals

193
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,363
Sandeep, whatever you said
has been proved false

194
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,448
Will you come to the point now?

195
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:57,246
Or you want us to
treat you in our style?

196
00:12:57,271 --> 00:13:00,031
Sir, please believe me
A lady in a red dress met me here

197
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,174
Better to question you in our station

198
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,460
That lady in red claimed
she was Shruthi's colleague, sir

199
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,039
Let's go to Shruthi's office

200
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,399
Trust me, please

201
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:10,264
No way Sandeep would have killed Shruthi

202
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,009
Because he isn't the kind
to fight with anyone

203
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,634
'In fact he is quite reserved'

204
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,367
'He is very kind hearted'

205
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:19,592
If you ask me

206
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:21,817
...he is the best husband
I have ever seen, sir

207
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,842
Sorry, sub inspector sir
I don't agree with her

208
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,536
'As far as I have observed'

209
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:30,728
I can't credit Sandeep
to be 'best husband'

210
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,739
Because I have never seen
such a clumsy husband, never in control

211
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:38,004
I don't understand you

212
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,829
Shruthi is very attractive

213
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:43,134
And she enjoyed all the males
falling all over her

214
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,065
Knowing all this, if Sandeep
was least bit possessive

215
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,810
A man unable to control
his wife or reprimand her

216
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,104
How can he be soft hearted, sir?

217
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,769
He must be either weak or careless

218
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:59,670
So what do you think?
Who could have killed her?

219
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,697
I don't know that
but Sandeep didn't kill her

220
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:04,457
Why do you say so?

221
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,035
Because he's a scaredy-cat

222
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,550
Sir, you don't understand

223
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,459
Sandeep is very naive

224
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:12,558
More sensitive than women

225
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,387
Hello, where is Rosy?

226
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,999
Rosy

227
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,439
Excuse me...hello!

228
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,089
Rosy

229
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,136
'Sandeep, behave yourself
This is office'

230
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,353
Sir, that lady came here-

231
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:30,938
Hello, what's going on?

232
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,320
What's happening here?

233
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,511
- I am the branch manager
- Sir, I am Shruthi's husband

234
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:37,336
- Doesn't a lady by name Rosy work here?
- Yes, she does

235
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,761
Didn't I tell you, she gave me
a letter this morning?

236
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,226
Letter?
Where?

237
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,891
Restaurant, a while ago at lunch

238
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:46,096
She is busy with client meeting
right from this morning

239
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,440
What are you saying, sir?
I met her personally

240
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:49,785
Please call her here

241
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,930
Okay, first relax

242
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:52,235
Relax...relax

243
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,460
- Hello, call Rosy
- Okay, sir

244
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,107
'Mr Sandeep
Rosy here'

245
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,039
Sir, this lady isn't Rosy

246
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,479
I didn't meet this lady

247
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,999
See, Mr Sandeep
She's only Rosy

248
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,759
You can check her ID, man

249
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:15,673
Sir, you have another Rosy working here?

250
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:18,327
- Call her, sir
- Only one Rosy works here

251
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:23,369
- He is lying, sir
- Enough, Sandeep

252
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,589
What is the need for all of them to lie?

253
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:27,014
You are the one lying to us

254
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,079
And trying to prove it's true, right?

255
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,199
Sir, why should I lie?
My wife is the one who has been killed

256
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,574
- Sir, please call Rosy
- See, Mr Sandeep

257
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,639
My entire staff is here
Please check for yourself

258
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:41,944
Mr Sandeep, noticing how flustered you are

259
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:43,809
...I'm getting even more
suspicious of you

260
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,074
As far as I know
Shruthi didn't come to work today

261
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:47,419
She's on leave

262
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,304
- Leave?
- Yes

263
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:52,049
She mailed yesterday
saying she is taking off today

264
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:53,514
'Yes, bro'

265
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,840
Shruthi didn't come to the office today

266
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:59,984
When I spoke to her, she said she was
meeting Aneendra in the morning

267
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,849
And she had planned to have lunch with you

268
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:04,793
Aneendra

269
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:06,546
We are meeting for lunch today

270
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:09,131
Couples usually plan to go out
for dinner on their anniversary

271
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:11,116
My mom has invited us for dinner

272
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:12,232
That's why lunch

273
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,817
I may not be able to make it, baby

274
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,082
I have a client meeting
Please try to understand

275
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,648
Every time you come up with
an excuse like this and skip it

276
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,759
You never spend time with me

277
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:27,698
Okay, we'll have lunch together

278
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:29,643
That too, in your favorite restaurant

279
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,560
'# you have called is switched off'

280
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:53,416
Mr Kamal, I need some
information about Shruthi

281
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,046
Her behavior, timings

282
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,599
'Her reaction to the police
Will you tell us the details?'

283
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,479
Hello, Sandeep
Where are you?

284
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,178
- Everything is okay, right?
- Not okay

285
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,901
Someone has murdered Shruthi
and is trying to frame me

286
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,733
Is that so?
How do you know?

287
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,504
I have my doubts on these police officers
Bharath and Shankar Reddy

288
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:15,698
They seem over familiar with the managers
in Shruthi's office and the restaurant

289
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,493
Calling them by their first names

290
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,039
- I am very suspicious
- What? Are you sure?

291
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:23,279
Sandeep didn't attend office today?

292
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,439
Hey! I'll call you back

293
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,079
- Sir
- Hello-

294
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,359
You've been lying all along
and wasted our precious time

295
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,759
Sir, I'm not lying, someone has
given you wrong information

296
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,679
Please come with me to my office
I swear I went to work today, sir

297
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,999
Please come and you'll know

298
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,444
- Be alert
- Ravi

299
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:48,849
- Sir
- Any information?

300
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,234
Yes, sir, we have
unlocked Shruthi's phone

301
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:54,764
Sandeep has called her 5 times
after she was dead, sir

302
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:57,364
But what is more interesting is...

303
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,298
...Shruthi has called Aneendra
18 times before her death, sir

304
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:07,062
Who is this Aneendra?

305
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,317
Sandeep's friend, sir

306
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:10,069
'I need all the information
about him also'

307
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:13,764
Oh hello! Move your butt
What are you thinking about now?

308
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,340
Hatching another plan?

309
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,680
Move it

310
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,904
Sir, this is his mail
applying for leave today

311
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,404
He didn't come in
to work today, sir

312
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:23,324
I didn't come?!
Call Sunil

313
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:25,204
Is anyone by name Sunil
present here at least?

314
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:28,179
I met him this morning and
even gave him my presentation, sir

315
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:30,044
He is lying, sir
Come with me, sir

316
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:31,724
Sir, Sunil is here

317
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:33,924
Sunil...didn't I come this morning?

318
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:36,124
I gave you my laptop
before going out for lunch?

319
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,844
- Tell them
- Cool, dude, calm down

320
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,524
Are you high on dope or what?

321
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:41,212
You didn't even come here today

322
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:45,444
What are you saying?!

323
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,604
You said you had some urgent work to do

324
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:50,615
I even typed out
your leave application

325
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,520
Sir, he is lying through his teeth

326
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,730
- Return my laptop
- Which laptop?

327
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,282
Hey! My lap-

328
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:09,257
Look how he is over reacting, sir

329
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,471
He has my password, sir

330
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:15,787
Enough, Sandeep
Stop your melodrama

331
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:18,066
We've given a patient hearing
to all your lies and drama

332
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,313
Come to the station

333
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,618
Get into our car

334
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,587
You are a clever manipulator
pretending to be innocent

335
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:26,731
You know when to act naive
and get sympathy accordingly

336
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,058
'Now it's clear'

337
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,818
That you are the murderer!

338
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:30,898
Sir?

339
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:34,978
Go now

340
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:36,632
Come

341
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:37,897
Move

342
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,138
Move your butt

343
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:42,578
Come on-

344
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:48,858
Hey Sandeep, don't repeat
the same mistake here

345
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:51,418
- Let her go
- Sandeep, no

346
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:54,698
Listen to me
Don't do this

347
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:56,618
Sandeep...no

348
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:00,658
- Sandeep, listen
- Let her go

349
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:04,378
Stop!

350
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,458
Hey Sandeep!

351
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:14,827
Stop, Sandeep

352
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:22,722
Sandeep, sit
Hurry up

353
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,978
[siren wailing]

354
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:42,658
Actually who are you?

355
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:44,738
Asking you
Who are you?

356
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:51,361
I took all the trouble of
stealing this bike and saving you

357
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,338
Instead of thanking me
why all these questions?

358
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,218
Khaleel, you always save me
when I am in trouble

359
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:58,147
Khaleel, police!
Let's go

360
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:52,098
Search thoroughly
We shouldn't miss him

361
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:03,547
Sir, his bike is here

362
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,898
Yes, this is his bike

363
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:09,043
- He must be inside
- Let's go and check

364
00:22:11,658 --> 00:22:12,978
Search...search

365
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,298
- We missed him, sir
- He is very smart

366
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,498
He has parked his bike here
just to mislead us

367
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:23,938
Come on, let's move

368
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:25,978
Under no circumstances
should we miss him

369
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:39,978
Why did you throw the phone out?
I was trying to reach Aneendra

370
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:42,178
Enough of messing up
from this morning

371
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:44,458
- Don't talk like a lunatic now
- What's wrong?

372
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:48,258
Don't you know the police can easily
track your calls if you switch it on?

373
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:51,786
Wonder where he escaped

374
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:53,851
- One of his friends must be in the loop
- Yes, sir

375
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,353
He would've helped him

376
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:57,058
- We have to catch him
- Yes, sir

377
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:17,593
What happened?
Why did you stop?

378
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:19,418
No one will come here

379
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:21,289
This is my den, come in

380
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,938
Hey Sandeep

381
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:29,338
Come on, man

382
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,978
Trust me, no one will come
looking for us here

383
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:33,762
Come on in

384
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:42,098
Come in, this is my secret hideout

385
00:23:42,818 --> 00:23:44,938
You can relax here with no worries

386
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,883
No one will dare touch you here

387
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:48,538
'Come'

388
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:52,799
Yes...relax

389
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:54,858
I'll handle everything from now on

390
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:56,578
Care for a drink, huh?

391
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:58,944
Let's both have a shot

392
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,372
'Imported vodka'

393
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:04,738
'For special occasions like this'

394
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,018
Khaleel, cops may follow me here

395
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,930
Hey! That's dangerous

396
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:13,875
I love to play with danger

397
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:26,138
I'm so happy today

398
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:28,946
I'm so happy you killed that bitch

399
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:32,461
How dare you!

400
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:33,966
Calling my wife a bitch?

401
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:53,858
You are the one who killed her

402
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:55,298
You killed that bitch

403
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,378
I didn't kill her

404
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:57,618
I love my wife

405
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,298
She was your wife

406
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:04,578
'Was' as in past tense

407
00:25:05,218 --> 00:25:06,978
You have killed her

408
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:09,418
No, I didn't kill her

409
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,978
Who else would have
other than you?

410
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,231
You mean to say I killed her?

411
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,440
If you raise your voice
everyone will hear, that's it

412
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,423
But no one will believe you

413
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:46,218
You are the murderer
till you prove you are innocent

414
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,058
Only the man who kills
will be on the run

415
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:52,498
You are totally screwed up

416
00:25:57,524 --> 00:26:00,004
Sir, there's no necessity
for Sandeep to kill his wife

417
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:01,949
You are suspecting him
without any reason

418
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,174
Stop it, Ranjani

419
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:06,739
How can I not defend Sandeep?

420
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:08,538
Stop it now

421
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:10,658
Sir, if you don't mind

422
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:12,658
- I need to talk to her personally
- Sure

423
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:13,698
'Okay'

424
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,898
Come in for a minute

425
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:17,218
He's always like this
Forever suspicious!

426
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:18,698
So annoying

427
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:24,513
Why are you talking like a lunatic?

428
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:26,658
The police will figure out
about Sandeep's involvement

429
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:28,843
Stop showing your soft corner
for him, got it?

430
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:30,818
You are the one behaving
like a lunatic

431
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:32,138
Sandeep is your friend

432
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:35,538
Instead of being concerned for him
you are misunderstanding me

433
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:39,418
Your behavior gives wrong signals
as if Shruthi's death is to your advantage

434
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:42,858
If Sandeep had died
isn't it to your advantage?

435
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:46,698
You and your big mouth!

436
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,298
Disgusting fellow!

437
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:53,578
Sir, actually there has been some minor
disturbances between Sandeep and Shruthi

438
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:54,858
'Sir'

439
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:58,418
It is quite common for
any couple to have minor tiffs

440
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,378
But it isn't right to make it
sound like major rifts

441
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:02,403
They were always-

442
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:03,748
Harini madam, wait

443
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:05,298
What is the rift?

444
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:08,178
Sir, I know a person who can be
of great help in this case

445
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:10,858
He can provide you
with maximum information

446
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:14,458
In this entire case

447
00:27:15,498 --> 00:27:17,578
One man has been elusive

448
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:19,298
Aneendra

449
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:25,938
Being his friend if he hasn't turned up
after all this has happened

450
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:29,258
Something is wrong

451
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:32,468
I need to go to Aneendra's house right now

452
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,778
Something is happening
without my knowledge

453
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:36,498
Relax for the night
You can go tomorrow

454
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:37,858
No, I have to go now

455
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:39,818
Sandeep...wait

456
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:04,673
Hey! Who are you?

457
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:06,498
How did you get Shruthi's note?

458
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,953
Hey! I am asking you

459
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:17,978
Why is everyone trying
to keep you hidden from me?

460
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:19,338
Tell me

461
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,388
Don't trust that guy

462
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:25,938
What?!

463
00:28:25,978 --> 00:28:27,058
Don't trust him

464
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:28,618
He will let you down

465
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:38,578
Hey! Stop

466
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,538
Bloody bitch!
Stop the car

467
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,018
Fucking female!

468
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:49,898
Bloody bitch!

469
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,593
Who is she?

470
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:53,658
Who?

471
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:56,578
Rosy...the lady who gave me the letter

472
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:57,738
Letter, huh?

473
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,738
What did she tell you?

474
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:03,378
What did she tell you about me?

475
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,258
She told me not to trust you

476
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:08,658
That's why I told you
All girls are bitches

477
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:10,218
All women with no exceptions

478
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:11,658
That's why I hate women

479
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:14,738
Come on

480
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,378
Is Baba there?

481
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:37,978
Sandeep?

482
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:41,898
How are you, my dear?
Ages since I saw you

483
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,258
What's up?

484
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,938
You look troubled?

485
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:49,138
I am okay
Can you give my room key?

486
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:50,778
I'll open it for you, wait

487
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,618
Khaleel?

488
00:29:57,978 --> 00:29:59,578
- Khaleel?
- Khaleel, huh?

489
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,618
He came with me

490
00:30:02,658 --> 00:30:05,658
He will come of his own accord
Let's go to your room

491
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:09,058
Forever fiddling with your mobile!
Why can't you study?

492
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:19,418
Come, sit down

493
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:29,018
What happened to you, son?

494
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,178
What is bothering you?

495
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,427
Why are you so perturbed?

496
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:36,378
Please tell me

497
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:39,794
Someone killed Shruthi, Baba

498
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:43,418
And wants to frame me

499
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:45,023
[sniffles]

500
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:48,153
A lady gave me a note from Shruthi

501
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:50,071
Now they are saying
there's no such lady

502
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:52,920
Claiming the CCTV footage didn't work
they are trying to frame me, Baba

503
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:54,548
I don't understand any of this

504
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,693
Don't worry
Lie down now

505
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,452
We will tackle this tomorrow

506
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:00,427
Rest up

507
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:11,938
'I can't stay with you anymore'

508
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,822
[thumping on door]

509
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,142
[thumping continues]

510
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:13,138
Son of a gun!

511
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:17,858
Did you think you could
escape from my clutches?

512
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,261
I won't spare you

513
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:24,138
You can't escape from me now

514
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:25,618
You deserve this encounter

515
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:27,549
- Run, son
- Let me go

516
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:30,294
I'll handle him
Get away from here

517
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,559
- Let go of me
- Escape, son, go

518
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:36,058
Sandeep, stop

519
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,058
Hey Sandeep

520
00:32:41,098 --> 00:32:42,338
Stop

521
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:44,898
Come on, fast
Start the car

522
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,618
Follow his car

523
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:57,978
Sandeep...Sandeep

524
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,178
Stop

525
00:32:59,218 --> 00:33:01,418
Sandeep, get into my car

526
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:02,498
Listen to me

527
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,923
Sandeep, get onto my bike

528
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,588
Don't listen to him
Get into my car

529
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:06,893
You just shut up

530
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,118
Shut up, bloody female
Don't listen to her

531
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:10,903
- Get on to my bike
- 'Get into my car'

532
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,374
Go fast

533
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:14,389
Don't listen to her
All women are bitches

534
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:15,814
You come with me

535
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:18,117
Sandeep, wait

536
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,698
Shruthi?

537
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:03,858
Why did you do this?

538
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:05,458
You always share
everything with me

539
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:06,818
Why did you commit suicide now?

540
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:08,978
- Tell me
- He killed me!

541
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:13,578
He didn't like us living
under the same roof, Sandy

542
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:15,032
Who?

543
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,178
Khaleel

544
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:35,898
My dear boy
Drink this coffee

545
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,366
Did Khaleel come here?

546
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:38,818
He came after you had slept

547
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:42,098
He created such a ruckus asking me
to wake you up, I refused point blank

548
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:44,578
He is a bit weird

549
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:46,778
You be on your guard with him

550
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:01,698
Saw this, Ravi?
His house # is 302

551
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:02,738
Yes, sir

552
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:04,618
Section 302 murder case

553
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:06,298
Come on, let's search

554
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,178
- Don't miss the details
- Yeah

555
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:35,018
- Ravi?
- Sir

556
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:36,858
See this

557
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,498
Aunty, I need to talk to you

558
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:57,418
- Sandeep
- Open the door, aunty

559
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,338
Let me come in
I want to talk to you

560
00:35:59,378 --> 00:36:01,818
Come to the swimming pool
I'll meet you there

561
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:07,018
She meant the world to me, aunty
Now she has left this world and me

562
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:09,938
I have no one now, aunty

563
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:12,578
Sandeep, we are all there for you

564
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:14,858
Don't ever think you are all alone, okay?

565
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:21,818
Aunty, did Shruthi tell you
anything about Aneendra?

566
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:24,018
No, she has never
discussed him with me

567
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,138
[mobile ringing]

568
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:29,498
- Hello?
- Aunty, I'm Aneendra speaking

569
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:31,546
Aneendra

570
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:34,818
Turn on 'speaker' mode

571
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:38,738
- Tell me
- Sorry, aunty

572
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:39,938
Very sorry

573
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:45,098
Why didn't you attend the funeral
and at least see Shruthi one last time?

574
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:48,538
I had some urgent work and
I had to rush to Vizag yesterday

575
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:50,018
'That's why I couldn't come'

576
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:52,098
Aunty, I need to tell you something

577
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:53,389
Tell me

578
00:36:53,538 --> 00:36:56,938
I don't know if Shruthi has
shared this with you or not

579
00:36:56,978 --> 00:36:59,258
Both you and the police need to know this

580
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,498
Police?

581
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:04,978
What is this information?

582
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:07,698
You mean Shruthi didn't
tell you anything, huh?

583
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,778
Regarding Sandeep

584
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,258
No, what is it?

585
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:17,058
I'll tell you in person, aunty

586
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:18,938
Ask him to tell you now

587
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:21,418
- Tell me
- No, aunty

588
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,538
I'll tell you in person

589
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:23,858
Insist on knowing now

590
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:27,138
Tell me right now, Aneendra

591
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:30,636
Aunty, is someone with you?

592
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,938
No, go ahead, tell me

593
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:34,738
Sandeep is with you, right?

594
00:37:34,826 --> 00:37:35,906
Shit!

595
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:42,858
Why are you so eager to know
what he has to say?

596
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:46,375
Shruthi has called Aneendra
18 times yesterday before she died

597
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:47,418
Whaaat?

598
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:50,418
The police found out
when they checked Shruthi's phone

599
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:51,898
Sister, are you in there?

600
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:55,378
Police officers are here to talk to you

601
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:58,698
They have come here
looking for me, aunty

602
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,378
Go this way and escape

603
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:30,298
What is the matter, sir?

604
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:32,898
We came to confirm
a piece of news with you

605
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:36,138
- Tell me
- Were they planning to have a baby?

606
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:37,881
- Do you know anything?
- Whaaat?!

607
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:39,076
Why are you so shocked?

608
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:41,181
We found a pregnancy kit in her bathroom

609
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:42,446
Impossible!

610
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,889
Why is it impossible?

611
00:38:45,218 --> 00:38:47,258
This is a natural outcome after marriage

612
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:50,360
Sir, no chance of Shruthi being pregnant

613
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:52,345
She doesn't have uterus!

614
00:38:55,642 --> 00:38:58,002
Aiyo amma!
Are you sitting here?

615
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:00,107
I've been looking for you
all over the house

616
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:05,051
What has happened now?
Why are you so upset?

617
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,083
You won't understand
even if I tell you

618
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:09,667
Amma, I know everything

619
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:11,691
Take this also in a positive way

620
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,636
No uterus means no tumor

621
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:14,971
And no periods

622
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:18,596
Don't you know how much I suffer
with cramps during my periods?

623
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:19,891
Now I can be carefree

624
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:23,076
I was brooding over the fact
how I can find a suitable groom for you

625
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:27,061
Aiyo! Amma, there must be a man out there
who'll understand my health issue and me

626
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,366
To fall in love is
to understand each other

627
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:32,724
No one would have been
more understanding than Sandeep

628
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:36,538
Even I couldn't have found
a better match for my daughter

629
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:40,906
In fact we met a groom earlier on

630
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:43,236
But when he knew
about her health issue

631
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,621
...he rejected her

632
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:49,562
After this rejection
Sandeep walked into Shruthi's life

633
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,179
'I love Shruthi very much, aunty'

634
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:55,044
I just want her to share my life
I don't want anything else

635
00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:59,083
You don't understand, Sandeep
She can never conceive

636
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:01,834
You won't be blessed with
a baby who will call you 'dad'

637
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:04,578
But won't I share
a lifetime with her, aunty?

638
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:07,389
Please, ma, accept his proposal

639
00:40:07,414 --> 00:40:11,174
- Shruthi
- We can always adopt if we want a baby

640
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:16,986
Shruthi won't be just my wife, aunty

641
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:19,778
I'll cherish her as my breath!

642
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,978
Shruthi may have found out
Sandeep is having an affair

643
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:29,244
Not wanting that matter to leak out
Sandeep may have killed Shruthi

644
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:34,698
It's very clear

645
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,018
Did you kill Shruthi?

646
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:43,987
Is this your own doubt?

647
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:45,812
Or did someone create this idea?

648
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:47,877
Shruthi told me in my dream last night

649
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:52,769
You ended up confused to such an extent
you are believing even your dream

650
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:56,314
If you tell this to anyone
they will brand you a lunatic!

651
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,780
Do you know why you dreamt like that?

652
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:00,876
That wasn't 'just a dream'

653
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:02,554
Shruthi featured in it

654
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:04,418
She speaks only the truth to me

655
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:06,323
Dreams don't come true

656
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:09,243
You are mentally disturbed
because of your wife's demise

657
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:11,418
You've been thinking
of only that all the time

658
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,138
Remember this, Sandeep

659
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:15,976
Whatever troubles us in reality

660
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,761
...will feature in our sleep

661
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:21,138
At that same time
bloody bitch Rosy

662
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,258
She has the gall to warn you
not to trust me!

663
00:41:23,298 --> 00:41:25,858
So your brain is working overtime
and going viral now

664
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:28,018
But you dislike Shruthi, right?

665
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:29,898
I dislike all women!

666
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:32,298
But I can't go around
killing all the females, right?

667
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:37,665
What are you deep in thought about?
Take that phone from the dashboard

668
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:44,658
Do you know Aneendra's #?

669
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,972
[mobile ringing]

670
00:41:50,018 --> 00:41:52,458
- Hello?
- Aneendra, I am Sandeep

671
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:53,978
I need to talk to you urgently

672
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:55,058
Regarding what?

673
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,098
You wanted to tell
Shruthi's mother something

674
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:58,858
Tell me about it
Please, what is it?

675
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:00,578
I'll tell the police

676
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:03,348
Aneendra, please
You are hiding something from me

677
00:42:03,373 --> 00:42:05,363
She has called you 18 times
before she passed away

678
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:07,428
What was the matter?
Aneendra, tell me

679
00:42:07,453 --> 00:42:09,373
Did you and Shruthi have an affair?

680
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:10,798
You've really gone bonkers

681
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,103
Yes, I have lost it

682
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,858
If you were in my shoes
you would react the same way

683
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:17,795
Please, Aneendra, tell me

684
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,075
Sandeep, you are really sick

685
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,820
Whatever I say now
will go above your head

686
00:42:21,845 --> 00:42:24,245
I must go to the police now
I'll talk to you later

687
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:26,138
Hello...Aneendra

688
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:27,898
Aneendra!

689
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,738
Hello...Aneendra

690
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:44,498
If you are so soft and naive
no one will give you any answers

691
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:47,723
If you change your style of interrogation
you will automatically get your answers

692
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:48,788
Means what?

693
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:56,098
How do you know Aneendra's house?

694
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,978
That is not important now

695
00:42:58,138 --> 00:43:01,178
You go and find out the truth
before he goes to the police

696
00:43:01,218 --> 00:43:02,298
Get down, go in

697
00:43:21,236 --> 00:43:22,818
- Hello
- Hello Aneendra

698
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:24,778
I am sub inspector Ravi Varma speaking

699
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:27,298
- Are you in your house?
- Yes, sir, I was coming to meet you

700
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:28,483
No...no
You don't come

701
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:30,348
Stay right there
I am coming over now

702
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:31,773
Okay, sir
Come soon

703
00:43:31,805 --> 00:43:32,798
'Aneendra?'

704
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:33,863
Sandeep?

705
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:35,902
Sandeep?!

706
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:37,567
Hello...Aneendra

707
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:39,858
Aneendra, is Sandeep at your place?

708
00:43:40,252 --> 00:43:41,858
Sandeep?
Where are you?

709
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:43,658
Hello, Aneendra
Are you there?

710
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:44,778
Hello

711
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:46,138
Sandeep

712
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:48,195
'Aneendra'

713
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:50,218
Sandeep

714
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,791
I know you are here

715
00:43:56,528 --> 00:43:57,648
Sandeep

716
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:01,098
I know you are right here
You had better show your face

717
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,258
Aneendra

718
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:07,818
Come on...come on
Fast...move

719
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:15,818
Bharath sir, come immediately
to Aneendra's house

720
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:17,058
Sandeep

721
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:18,658
Sandeep

722
00:44:30,178 --> 00:44:32,298
Aneendra...Aneendra

723
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:33,978
Who did this to you?

724
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:36,218
I'll take care of you
Don't be scared

725
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:37,683
Sandeep!

726
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:40,019
I'll take you to the hospital
I'm here for you

727
00:44:40,538 --> 00:44:42,098
Aneendra

728
00:44:44,378 --> 00:44:46,098
[siren wailing]

729
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:52,058
Shit!

730
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,338
Sandeep

731
00:45:17,058 --> 00:45:18,338
Oh my God!

732
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:21,543
Sandeep must be here
Search thoroughly

733
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:22,808
Come on...fast

734
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:29,818
Khaleel!

735
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:33,218
Sir

736
00:45:37,658 --> 00:45:38,898
Sir...!

737
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:39,963
Khaleel?

738
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:42,978
Sandeep, hurry up
Get into the car

739
00:45:43,003 --> 00:45:44,233
What are you doing here?

740
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:45,778
Cops will catch you
Get into the car

741
00:45:45,818 --> 00:45:47,018
We can talk later

742
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:48,098
You first get down

743
00:45:48,138 --> 00:45:50,237
- The police will nab you
- You get down now

744
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:52,378
Get in fast
The cops are here

745
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:02,058
Sir, Sandeep escaped

746
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:04,218
Sir, look at this
Sandeep!

747
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,250
This is proof Sandeep has murdered Aneendra

748
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:09,723
Speed up

749
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,559
I told you to get down
Why did you come here?

750
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:13,533
If you wander around
in this blood stained shirt

751
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:15,798
...the police will nab you easily
First change your shirt

752
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:18,106
- Even I took off my shirt
- Why did you take it off?

753
00:46:18,131 --> 00:46:19,412
I killed someone

754
00:46:20,298 --> 00:46:22,538
What? You killed someone?
Whom did you kill?

755
00:46:22,563 --> 00:46:24,720
Why get into that now?
Focus on the road and drive

756
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:27,031
- Tell me
- My friend's father

757
00:46:27,056 --> 00:46:29,289
His father was hitting him with
a bat and I lost my cool

758
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:31,438
I grabbed the wicket
and banged his forehead

759
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:33,703
I kept hitting him
till he bled to death

760
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:37,258
- Get out of the car
- I'll get down but you take this

761
00:46:37,283 --> 00:46:40,290
Cover yourself with this, or else
you'll get caught by the police easily

762
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:44,134
Hey! Get down

763
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:17,098
Radhakrishna
6th Avenue

764
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:18,578
King George street

765
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:19,996
Do you recognize this address?

766
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:22,141
No, I have no idea

767
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:32,178
Do you know where Sandeep lived
before he married your daughter?

768
00:47:32,298 --> 00:47:33,738
That was-

769
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,258
- Ravi...?
- Sir?

770
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:36,843
We got the information

771
00:47:36,868 --> 00:47:37,988
Old City

772
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:39,498
Laad Bazaar

773
00:47:39,696 --> 00:47:40,936
Baba Hostel

774
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,680
Go and enquire there

775
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:46,018
[mobile ringing]

776
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,058
- Hello
- Sandeep

777
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:49,763
Baba, I'm busy now
I'll talk to you later

778
00:47:49,788 --> 00:47:51,114
'Please listen to me'

779
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:52,533
You can lead a happy life

780
00:47:52,558 --> 00:47:54,852
That Aneendra who was troubling you

781
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:56,117
I finished him off

782
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:58,338
You're the one who killed Aneendra?

783
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,938
Why are you troubling Sandeep?

784
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,218
You shouldn't be alive
You have to die now

785
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:15,862
- Be happy now
- Where are you?

786
00:48:15,887 --> 00:48:16,927
'Hostel'

787
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:25,618
No, please don't harm me

788
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:27,738
Baba, you good for nothing lout!

789
00:48:27,778 --> 00:48:30,138
Why did you murder Aneendra, huh?

790
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:31,443
Baba...!

791
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:34,504
Baba...?

792
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:36,538
Where is Baba?

793
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:44,380
I won't spare you today

794
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:45,509
Baba...!

795
00:48:45,534 --> 00:48:47,525
Otherwise I'll kill you right now

796
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,486
Tell me, why did you kill Aneendra?

797
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:50,658
Why did you do it?

798
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:51,816
Sandeep, move

799
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:53,241
Why did you kill him?

800
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,738
I won't let anyone hassle you

801
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:57,658
Whatever I do
is only for your good

802
00:48:57,698 --> 00:48:59,898
Will you kill anyone and everyone?

803
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,258
He's such a troublemaker!

804
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:03,803
He brews trouble wherever he comes
Should we stay or leave?

805
00:49:03,828 --> 00:49:06,868
Does it mean you killed Shruthi?
Did you kill my wife?

806
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:08,713
Tell me, did you kill Shruthi?

807
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,898
Aren't you the one who killed Shruthi?

808
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:12,938
- Sandeep, let him go
- Tell me the truth

809
00:49:12,978 --> 00:49:14,458
Hello, police station?

810
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:17,779
I am calling from
Baba Hostel, Laad Bazaar

811
00:49:18,178 --> 00:49:20,058
There's disturbance in our hostel

812
00:49:20,098 --> 00:49:22,418
Send your policemen over immediately

813
00:49:23,403 --> 00:49:25,483
Hey! Did you murder my Shruthi?

814
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:27,433
- Did you kill her?
- Listen to me, son

815
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,258
Sandeep, he'll die
Don't strangle him

816
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:31,218
Sandeep, he will die
Let go of him

817
00:49:31,243 --> 00:49:33,483
Are you out of your mind?
Let go of him

818
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:34,788
You killed Aneendra?

819
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:36,373
Sandeep, let go

820
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,960
Mad or what?
Have you lost your mind?

821
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:57,233
Do you know what you are doing?

822
00:49:57,258 --> 00:49:59,098
In order to prove
you haven't killed 1 person

823
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:00,883
...you're becoming a serial killer!

824
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:06,232
'In the end you killed Baba who raised you
like his own son from when you were a kid'

825
00:50:07,113 --> 00:50:08,633
Finally you are becoming a murderer

826
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,553
'How many more people will you kill?'

827
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:12,473
'How many times can I save you?'

828
00:50:13,669 --> 00:50:15,309
Initially you said I killed Shruthi

829
00:50:15,334 --> 00:50:16,334
Now it is Baba

830
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,479
In the middle you suspected Aneendra

831
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:20,473
Remember this, Sandeep

832
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:22,738
Suspicion is more dangerous than truth

833
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:26,833
Why would Baba kill Shruthi? Tell me

834
00:50:26,953 --> 00:50:29,193
That means Baba didn't kill Shruthi?

835
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:30,233
NO

836
00:50:30,913 --> 00:50:33,193
But we must find out who killed her

837
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:51,633
I don't know what I am doing
because of my love for Shruthi

838
00:50:53,673 --> 00:50:57,113
Right from my childhood he always
understood my pain even if I didn't open up

839
00:50:57,153 --> 00:51:00,913
But when you were about to say something
I paid no attention and killed you, Baba

840
00:51:01,473 --> 00:51:03,953
I don't understand
what I'm doing, Baba

841
00:51:07,553 --> 00:51:08,913
Control, Sandeep

842
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:10,753
This wasn't a deliberate act

843
00:51:10,793 --> 00:51:12,473
It was an impulsive emotional reaction

844
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,873
We must escape from here
Hurry up, Sandeep

845
00:51:15,913 --> 00:51:16,993
'Leave this place'

846
00:51:17,793 --> 00:51:20,239
- Sandeep, open the door
- Someone has come

847
00:51:20,264 --> 00:51:22,104
I know you are inside

848
00:51:22,873 --> 00:51:24,233
You can't escape from me

849
00:51:24,273 --> 00:51:25,633
Sandeep, the police is here

850
00:51:25,673 --> 00:51:28,048
Get up...let's go, come

851
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:29,353
Sandeep

852
00:51:29,393 --> 00:51:31,553
We got a complaint
about some fight here

853
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:33,113
But everything looks normal

854
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:34,713
They were yelling till now, sir

855
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:36,393
They just quietened down

856
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:37,793
How many are there?

857
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,033
No idea, sir

858
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:41,953
But he yelled out 'Baba'
as he went up the stairs

859
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:44,393
- Go
- Please come, sir

860
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,311
Sandeep

861
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,160
Sandeep

862
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:49,593
Open the door

863
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,926
Hey, stop the car

864
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:10,471
Sandeep, let's go

865
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:13,113
Get in
Let's move

866
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:22,753
Unnecessarily I killed Baba

867
00:52:22,793 --> 00:52:24,233
Shhh...don't talk here

868
00:52:34,633 --> 00:52:36,553
[mobile ringing]

869
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,113
- Hello...?
- Hello

870
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:39,953
Hello Ranjani, this is Sandeep

871
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:42,113
Sandeep?
Where are you?

872
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:44,011
Do you know what is happening here?

873
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:45,473
Aneendra is dead!

874
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,007
I know, it was Baba who killed Aneendra

875
00:52:49,923 --> 00:52:51,523
Baba? Who is this Baba?

876
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:53,908
He took care of me in the hostel
when I was a kid

877
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:55,673
He is very fond of me

878
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,122
He did it for me

879
00:52:57,147 --> 00:53:00,707
Sandeep, do you know anyone
by name Radhakrishna?

880
00:53:01,953 --> 00:53:03,353
Radhakrishna?

881
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,353
Doesn't ring a bell, why?

882
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:07,193
- 'Not that'
- Give it to me

883
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,610
Hello madam, Sandeep is in danger

884
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:13,092
'He is getting himself into
a bigger mess by the hour'

885
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,968
'He needs a safe place immediately'

886
00:53:14,993 --> 00:53:17,513
- Can you arrange any shelter for him?
- 'Who are you?'

887
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,915
Please, Ranjani
I need a place to stay

888
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,100
At least for tonight

889
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,513
Yeah, okay...okay

890
00:53:24,553 --> 00:53:26,593
My mother has gone to Tirupati

891
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:28,553
You come to my mother's house

892
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:29,756
Okay, Ranjani

893
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:31,393
- Thank you
- Okay, see you

894
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:37,139
- Hello
- Rahul

895
00:53:37,491 --> 00:53:40,251
I have to go for a party
I'll be home late tonight

896
00:53:40,323 --> 00:53:41,403
Party?

897
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:42,835
Why party at this time?

898
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,940
I am feeling low

899
00:53:43,965 --> 00:53:45,605
So my friends called
and I'm going

900
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,230
'Let's try to be normal'

901
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:50,797
Rahul, it's very annoying if you keep
suspecting me for everything everyday

902
00:53:50,985 --> 00:53:54,345
Whatever I say will annoy you
but I shouldn't be bugged with you, right?

903
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:56,841
I don't want to argue
and spoil my mood further

904
00:53:56,921 --> 00:53:58,572
'If it gets late
I'll stay there tonight'

905
00:53:58,597 --> 00:54:00,339
Order your dinner through Swiggy

906
00:54:00,364 --> 00:54:01,526
Okay? Bye

907
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:05,682
Wily-nily female!
Lying through her teeth

908
00:54:07,803 --> 00:54:08,923
Come on, Sandeep

909
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:13,571
- Thank you, Ranjani
- It's okay

910
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:15,088
By the way, who was with you?

911
00:54:15,113 --> 00:54:16,353
My friend Khaleel

912
00:54:16,513 --> 00:54:18,383
He had some work
So he got down on the way

913
00:54:18,408 --> 00:54:20,568
He saved me from the police

914
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:22,528
He has been saving me

915
00:54:22,553 --> 00:54:23,753
Okay, come

916
00:54:26,113 --> 00:54:27,604
Sandeep, you freshen up

917
00:54:27,629 --> 00:54:29,469
I'll dish up some dinner by then

918
00:54:30,378 --> 00:54:31,418
Thanks

919
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:42,146
Khaleel will be calling me, I'll keep it

920
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:46,921
Verifying the address you gave me

921
00:54:46,946 --> 00:54:49,586
Radhakrishna Kakarlamudi
a psychiatrist lives there

922
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:50,698
Sir

923
00:54:52,058 --> 00:54:53,138
Ravi

924
00:54:53,163 --> 00:54:54,723
Radhakrishna Kakarlamudi

925
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:55,868
He's a psychiatrist

926
00:54:56,633 --> 00:54:58,193
Psychiatrist?

927
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,269
Get an appointment for tomorrow morning

928
00:55:01,294 --> 00:55:03,037
- We will meet the doctor
- Okay, sir

929
00:55:54,114 --> 00:55:56,114
We need to go to the doctor today

930
00:55:57,507 --> 00:55:59,707
Please, Sandeep, you have to come

931
00:56:34,106 --> 00:56:35,146
'Hello'

932
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:40,195
He is fast asleep

933
00:56:40,556 --> 00:56:42,636
If you come now
we can get him

934
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:45,148
Otherwise he'll leave in the morning

935
00:56:45,173 --> 00:56:46,213
Come fast

936
00:56:46,523 --> 00:56:48,763
We can take him to
Dr Radhakrishnan

937
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:50,316
Okay

938
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,098
What is the connection
between Kamal and Ranjani?

939
00:57:28,673 --> 00:57:30,313
Excuse me...hello?

940
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:34,473
Hello...hi-

941
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:38,513
Sandeep, get in
Don't waste time thinking

942
00:57:38,553 --> 00:57:40,033
Kamal will come anytime

943
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:41,113
Come on

944
00:58:00,553 --> 00:58:02,239
Hey! Why did you bring me here?

945
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:05,319
- Why did Shruthi give you the letter?
- Why are you asking me?

946
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:06,685
Don't you know?

947
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:08,217
[mobile ringing]

948
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:29,475
- Aren't you Sandeep?
- Yes

949
00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:30,611
And you?

950
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:33,076
Hi, I am Dr Radhakrishna Kakarlamudi

951
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:34,336
Psychiatrist

952
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:35,911
Psychiatrist

953
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:37,772
Don't be worried

954
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:39,292
We have never met

955
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:42,572
- I've seen your photo in Shruthi's mobile
- Okay

956
00:58:42,597 --> 00:58:44,717
She said she would
bring you over to meet me

957
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:46,862
Why would she want me to meet you?

958
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:48,527
To make you realize
you have a problem

959
00:58:48,557 --> 00:58:50,357
I have no problem
You are lying

960
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:51,732
Sandeep, relax

961
00:58:51,772 --> 00:58:53,132
I was about to say the same

962
00:58:53,172 --> 00:58:54,892
You have absolutely no problem

963
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:56,492
Problem is with Shruthi

964
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:00,012
What is her problem?

965
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:02,252
- What are you saying?
- She has schizophrenia

966
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,652
You mean to say my Shruthi is mad?

967
00:59:04,677 --> 00:59:06,917
Sandeep, try to understand the situation

968
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:09,342
- And start a new life
- What new life?

969
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,235
What do you mean 'new life'?
There's no life without Shruthi

970
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,380
Life without her is no life!

971
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:16,652
I'll tell the police
about Shruthi's problem

972
00:59:16,692 --> 00:59:17,859
You will be safe

973
00:59:17,884 --> 00:59:19,404
'Go somewhere and be happy'

974
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:21,309
'Believe me
Don't trust anyone'

975
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:23,245
'I will save you'

976
00:59:24,756 --> 00:59:27,356
By the way, do you know anyone
by name Radhakrishna?

977
00:59:27,514 --> 00:59:29,634
You mean Dr Radhakrishna Kakarlamudi?

978
00:59:29,674 --> 00:59:32,794
Yes, I do, I was the one
who introduced her to Shruthi

979
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,699
Really? We must go there immediately, come

980
00:59:35,855 --> 00:59:37,095
Let's go

981
00:59:37,394 --> 00:59:39,754
Khaleel, I must meet
Dr Radhakrishna urgently

982
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:40,914
Why there?

983
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,154
She claims my Shruthi is mad
I need to have a clear picture

984
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:45,954
Sandeep, you relax
I'll take care

985
00:59:45,994 --> 00:59:47,074
Khaleel, don't-

986
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:49,915
'Dr Radhakrishnan'

987
00:59:52,394 --> 00:59:55,474
- What happened?
- Someone attacked the doctor

988
00:59:55,514 --> 00:59:58,274
'He has been badly injured
and rushed to the hospital'

989
00:59:58,314 --> 01:00:00,554
- Sandeep
- Khaleel, what are you doing here?

990
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:02,154
I'll tell you
Come with me

991
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:04,754
Hey listen!

992
01:00:05,356 --> 01:00:08,036
Khaleel, stop
Talking to you

993
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,794
Khaleel

994
01:00:14,674 --> 01:00:16,274
Hey, this is for you

995
01:00:16,314 --> 01:00:18,834
Shruthi has proved you are
a lunatic in this document

996
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:27,034
So you killed the doctor
for this document?

997
01:00:27,074 --> 01:00:28,714
I was so enraged
I wanted to kill her

998
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:30,394
But I didn't have to kill her

999
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,299
Rosy warned me not to believe you

1000
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:34,044
You are a dangerous fellow!

1001
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:35,588
Why am I dangerous?

1002
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:36,813
You murdered Baba

1003
01:00:36,859 --> 01:00:38,394
You are the dangerous fellow

1004
01:00:38,419 --> 01:00:39,859
No, you are not my friend

1005
01:00:39,884 --> 01:00:41,569
I get into more trouble because of you

1006
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:43,434
- Fuck you!
- Get lost!

1007
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:02,681
- 'Constable
- Sir?'

1008
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,530
Urgent, take him to the hospital

1009
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:06,474
- Come, sir
- Please go

1010
01:01:19,434 --> 01:01:21,554
Kamal, be on your guard

1011
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:23,514
We shouldn't forget anything

1012
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:25,954
All of you should be alert

1013
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,074
Kamal, let's scoot from here

1014
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:29,594
Whatever I say-

1015
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:31,394
Ranjani

1016
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:40,114
- What are you both doing here?
- We have an appointment, sir

1017
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,834
For both of you?

1018
01:01:44,554 --> 01:01:47,354
Seeing you both together
I'm getting really suspicious

1019
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:51,554
Come, before the doctor gets
First Aid treatment and returns

1020
01:01:51,594 --> 01:01:53,314
...I need some clarity

1021
01:01:53,354 --> 01:01:56,474
Looking at you both,
there's something fishy!

1022
01:01:56,514 --> 01:01:57,514
Come

1023
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:02,434
Don't worry, let's go

1024
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:08,554
Hey! Who are you?

1025
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:10,702
You did the right thing
by throwing away the file

1026
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,607
Now no one can identify you

1027
01:02:12,634 --> 01:02:14,114
But who are you?

1028
01:02:14,154 --> 01:02:16,274
You belong to Khaleel's gang?
Or Ranjani's gang?

1029
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:17,994
Aneendra's or Kamal's gang?

1030
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,089
Why are you framing me
for my wife's murder?

1031
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:22,834
- Who are you all?
- Sandeep, I'm trying to help you

1032
01:02:22,895 --> 01:02:25,231
Indeed, all of us are trying to help you

1033
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:27,016
I don't need any of your help

1034
01:02:35,803 --> 01:02:36,834
Tell me now

1035
01:02:36,874 --> 01:02:38,994
How are you both connected?

1036
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:43,434
Why did you come here?

1037
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:46,114
For Sandeep's sake, sir

1038
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:47,474
Kamal...!

1039
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,474
We don't gain anything
by hiding facts any longer

1040
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:51,714
Hiding won't get you any solution

1041
01:02:53,794 --> 01:02:55,674
'Someone should tell the truth'

1042
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:58,834
Otherwise only suspicions will increase
and nothing will be solved

1043
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:03,200
I will have to blurt out
the whole truth then

1044
01:03:03,225 --> 01:03:04,665
That's better for you too

1045
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:07,314
But can't confess everything, can we?

1046
01:03:07,339 --> 01:03:09,259
Think twice before you speak

1047
01:03:09,314 --> 01:03:10,394
Stop it

1048
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:14,243
First tell me everything you know

1049
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:16,428
Otherwise I will extract it
in my own police style

1050
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,210
Let me call your husband Rahul

1051
01:03:20,235 --> 01:03:23,075
Sir, Sandeep needs help

1052
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,844
Can you be more specific?

1053
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:29,469
Sir, actually yesterday
when Sandeep called me

1054
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:32,939
I felt someone else grabbed the phone
from him and spoke to me

1055
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:34,124
'Give it to me'

1056
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:37,674
'Hello, madam
Sandeep is in danger'

1057
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:39,794
But the voice resembled Sandeep

1058
01:03:39,834 --> 01:03:41,914
I was a little suspicious right then

1059
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:43,939
'He needs a safe place immediately'

1060
01:03:43,964 --> 01:03:45,564
'Can you arrange
any shelter for him?'

1061
01:03:45,603 --> 01:03:49,963
After that when Sandeep came over
wanting to clear my doubt...

1062
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:52,874
I asked him about the person
who spoke to me over the phone

1063
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:55,874
- 'By the way, who was with you?
- Khaleel, my friend'

1064
01:03:55,914 --> 01:03:57,514
'He had some work
Got down on the way'

1065
01:03:57,554 --> 01:04:00,554
Then he took his mobile
and called up Khaleel

1066
01:04:00,594 --> 01:04:02,194
I became suspicious again

1067
01:04:02,234 --> 01:04:04,354
I checked the number
in Sandeep's mobile

1068
01:04:07,074 --> 01:04:10,994
Sir, this is the present #
Sandeep is using

1069
01:04:11,834 --> 01:04:13,794
The number Sandeep called me from

1070
01:04:13,834 --> 01:04:15,954
'The number he called Khaleel'

1071
01:04:15,994 --> 01:04:17,194
Both are same

1072
01:04:17,714 --> 01:04:19,234
What are you implying now?

1073
01:04:19,274 --> 01:04:22,394
What I understand after noting all this

1074
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:28,074
In reality Khaleel doesn't exist at all

1075
01:04:28,234 --> 01:04:29,994
Sandeep is Khaleel

1076
01:04:31,754 --> 01:04:34,154
Sandeep, stop

1077
01:04:34,365 --> 01:04:36,525
Sandeep, I need to talk to you

1078
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:38,914
Wait for me, Sandeep

1079
01:04:38,954 --> 01:04:40,314
Start the car

1080
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:42,794
- Hurry up
- Wait-

1081
01:04:43,514 --> 01:04:45,754
Speed up
Don't stop

1082
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:47,739
Do you realize what you're saying?

1083
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:51,284
You said he called up some # and
then you say there is no such person

1084
01:04:51,735 --> 01:04:53,775
Do you both want to
make a fool out of me?

1085
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,280
Sir, listen fully to what I'm saying

1086
01:04:56,305 --> 01:04:58,665
Then the pieces will fit
properly into your puzzle

1087
01:04:59,307 --> 01:05:01,467
Actually he said the person
who killed Aneendra

1088
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:03,692
...was Baba who lived
in the same hostel with Sandeep

1089
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:05,317
'It was Baba who killed Aneendra'

1090
01:05:05,342 --> 01:05:06,582
'Who is this Baba?'

1091
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:09,271
'He took care of me in the hostel
when I was a kid'

1092
01:05:09,354 --> 01:05:10,874
'He is very fond of me'

1093
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,914
Sir, before we came here

1094
01:05:14,175 --> 01:05:17,735
...we got the hostel address from
Shruthi's mother and we went there

1095
01:05:18,634 --> 01:05:22,594
When we went and enquired
we found there's no one by name Baba

1096
01:05:27,394 --> 01:05:29,594
- Tell me, my dear boy
- Baba?!

1097
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:33,274
I know you have a soft corner for Sandeep

1098
01:05:33,394 --> 01:05:37,211
I think you want to let him escape
by spinning yarns like this to me

1099
01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:39,034
But I won't leave him

1100
01:05:39,114 --> 01:05:41,674
You can come up with any story
But I won't believe you

1101
01:05:41,714 --> 01:05:43,034
'You have to believe!'

1102
01:05:45,143 --> 01:05:46,623
What they told you is true

1103
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,994
Hey...you-
Stop the car

1104
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:50,994
Where do you want to go?
I'll drop you

1105
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:52,914
Stop, I want to get down

1106
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:55,074
To explain Sandeep's situation

1107
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:57,234
Shruthi came and met me

1108
01:05:57,274 --> 01:06:00,954
She told me how perturbed she was
by Sandeep's behavior

1109
01:06:09,874 --> 01:06:12,834
So often I just don't
understand Sandeep one bit

1110
01:06:12,874 --> 01:06:15,274
'Sometimes he takes good care of me'

1111
01:06:15,314 --> 01:06:17,834
'Sometimes he behaves
as if he hates the sight of me'

1112
01:06:17,859 --> 01:06:19,899
Am I unable to understand him?

1113
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:22,644
Or isn't he able to understand me?

1114
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,647
I really don't know

1115
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:27,079
I feel so lost sometimes

1116
01:06:27,474 --> 01:06:28,834
I get scared

1117
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:32,179
I don't know why I'm even alive

1118
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:36,234
Sandeep is a case of
multiple personality disorder

1119
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:37,674
DID

1120
01:06:37,714 --> 01:06:41,154
We call it Dissociative Identity Disorder

1121
01:06:41,274 --> 01:06:44,274
It's accrued in a state of schizophrenia

1122
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:47,554
'In certain occasions he will step
into another person's shoe'

1123
01:06:59,554 --> 01:07:01,354
Yes, even I have observed that

1124
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,754
- Actually
- Kamal

1125
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:04,154
Let me speak

1126
01:07:04,634 --> 01:07:08,274
When Sandeep came
to drop Shruthi at work

1127
01:07:08,414 --> 01:07:10,294
Kamal got introduced to Sandeep

1128
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:14,034
From then on, they developed
interest towards each other

1129
01:07:14,634 --> 01:07:18,154
That's how a relationship
blossomed between them

1130
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:22,165
How did you know so clearly
about his multiple personalities?

1131
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,510
Sir, actually we are very close

1132
01:07:24,954 --> 01:07:27,274
He will keep mentioning a name

1133
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:31,262
What the hell, you bloody bastard?

1134
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:33,807
What business do you have with Sandeep?

1135
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:36,354
Don't try to act smart with Khaleel

1136
01:07:36,464 --> 01:07:38,029
Each day a different name

1137
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,054
He will behave according to that name

1138
01:07:41,954 --> 01:07:44,274
You are still thinking about him, baby

1139
01:07:44,509 --> 01:07:46,329
About that Khaleel, huh?

1140
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,674
Forget him

1141
01:07:48,394 --> 01:07:49,834
I'm there for you

1142
01:07:49,874 --> 01:07:52,394
Who are you now?

1143
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:55,914
Your darling Rosy

1144
01:07:56,874 --> 01:07:59,754
'I thought it was some kind of
role play game of his'

1145
01:07:59,794 --> 01:08:01,554
But gradually...one day

1146
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:02,794
Where is that bastard?

1147
01:08:02,834 --> 01:08:03,874
Who are you today?

1148
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,954
Just answer only my question

1149
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:07,929
Whom are you asking about now?

1150
01:08:07,954 --> 01:08:10,150
Where is that bastard Sandeep?

1151
01:08:10,175 --> 01:08:12,234
Was he searching for his own self?

1152
01:08:12,274 --> 01:08:13,994
Yes, sir
Exactly

1153
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:15,994
Which personality was he on that day?

1154
01:08:16,114 --> 01:08:19,034
That day alone he claimed he was
police officer Shankar Reddy

1155
01:08:19,074 --> 01:08:20,394
Shankar Reddy, huh?

1156
01:08:20,874 --> 01:08:23,674
- Do you know him?
- Sandeep mentioned him once to me

1157
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:25,859
- When?
- He called me

1158
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:28,685
He said Shankar Reddy is
investigating Shruthi's murder case

1159
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:31,274
And Mr Reddy is deliberately
framing him to be the murderer

1160
01:08:31,314 --> 01:08:34,754
'I have my doubts on these police officers
Bharath and Shankar Reddy'

1161
01:08:34,794 --> 01:08:39,874
'They seem over familiar with the managers
in Shruthi's office and the restaurant'

1162
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:41,874
- No chance
- Why, sir?

1163
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:44,954
No one by name Shankar Reddy
is handling this case

1164
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:47,514
'What are you thinking about now?'

1165
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:49,594
Sandeep

1166
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:54,754
This case is being handled only by me
and sub inspector Ravi Varma

1167
01:08:54,794 --> 01:08:56,725
We must somehow nab him this time

1168
01:08:59,655 --> 01:09:00,895
SANDEEP!

1169
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,594
Hey! Start the car

1170
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:09,061
- Sir
- Yes, Ravi

1171
01:09:09,086 --> 01:09:10,646
- Any information?
- Yes, sir

1172
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:13,831
I got the address of Sandeep's family
in Vizag from that paper, sir

1173
01:09:13,861 --> 01:09:15,901
- Sandeep's house address?
- Yes, sir

1174
01:09:15,988 --> 01:09:17,948
When I enquired about him
to his neighbors

1175
01:09:17,973 --> 01:09:20,213
I learnt his father passed away
when Sandeep was a kid

1176
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,958
- When he was a kid?
- Yes, sir

1177
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:25,423
The latest information I got,
the killer was not a stranger

1178
01:09:25,599 --> 01:09:27,279
- Sandeep himself
- Whaaat?!

1179
01:09:27,901 --> 01:09:30,383
Yes, sir, he hit his father with
a cricket stump and killed him

1180
01:09:30,408 --> 01:09:32,101
Then he escaped from Vizag

1181
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,966
Actually why has he created
so many characters, doctor?

1182
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:38,271
Whenever he thought
he has a problem

1183
01:09:38,296 --> 01:09:40,619
...to save himself from that mess

1184
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,684
...he will create a new character

1185
01:09:47,236 --> 01:09:48,616
To be imprecise

1186
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:51,361
'When his father used to hit him
when he was a kid'

1187
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:54,066
'...he made up his mind
he has to retaliate in the same way'

1188
01:09:54,091 --> 01:09:55,611
'But he was unable to'

1189
01:09:55,636 --> 01:09:57,436
- Father, don't hit me
- Listen

1190
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:59,150
- No, dad
- My dear, don't

1191
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:00,748
- Will you kill him?
- Shut up!

1192
01:10:00,773 --> 01:10:02,793
- You've spoilt him
- Is this how you punish?

1193
01:10:02,818 --> 01:10:04,204
Be kind and loving

1194
01:10:06,784 --> 01:10:07,894
Gawd!

1195
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,005
Oh my dear!

1196
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:15,765
That little boy is a figment of
his imagination of his own childhood

1197
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,437
After he escaped and landed here

1198
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:25,245
He felt he had no one
to shower love and care on him

1199
01:10:25,285 --> 01:10:28,925
'But how will you feel if you had
someone to love you unconditionally?'

1200
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,710
'From that thought
emerged the character of'

1201
01:10:31,757 --> 01:10:32,797
'Baba'

1202
01:10:32,821 --> 01:10:37,741
Baba was always by his side and
attending to every single need of his

1203
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,736
That's how he created that character

1204
01:10:39,761 --> 01:10:40,841
Right...right

1205
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,986
Even that hostel owner
mentioned Baba to us

1206
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:46,451
To delve deep into uncontrollable
rage, anger and suspicion

1207
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:50,555
And flush these strong emotions out
he needed an assertive character

1208
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:56,220
So...to exhibit that anger and
fury he fashioned out Khaleel

1209
01:10:59,657 --> 01:11:02,440
Whenever he needed to be
rescued from a royal mess

1210
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:04,465
...Khaleel will appear from nowhere

1211
01:11:05,113 --> 01:11:07,148
Sandeep was very fond of children

1212
01:11:07,173 --> 01:11:10,013
But knowing he can never have
babies through Shruthi

1213
01:11:10,038 --> 01:11:12,478
...he imagined himself to be a woman

1214
01:11:12,503 --> 01:11:16,943
...through whom he can have babies
and be a happy family and loving father

1215
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:19,248
That's how Rosy came to life in his mind

1216
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,368
Looks complicated

1217
01:11:22,393 --> 01:11:24,006
But seems to be true

1218
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:27,791
We deciphered, the pregnancy kit we found
in his house had traces of male urine

1219
01:11:28,707 --> 01:11:32,017
And next is officer Shankar Reddy

1220
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:37,082
He created all the fears he had
within himself in Shankar Reddy's character

1221
01:11:37,524 --> 01:11:40,524
'He fled as far away as possible
from him in order not to get caught'

1222
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:43,029
When Shruthi figured out
his mental afflictions

1223
01:11:43,054 --> 01:11:45,014
...she decided to take him
to a psychiatrist

1224
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:47,119
'She said she would
bring you over to meet me'

1225
01:11:47,144 --> 01:11:51,104
To ascertain he has no problem whatsoever
he created an imaginary doctor

1226
01:11:51,129 --> 01:11:52,329
'Sandeep, relax'

1227
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:53,959
'I was about to say the same'

1228
01:11:53,984 --> 01:11:55,784
'You have absolutely no problem'

1229
01:11:55,809 --> 01:11:57,369
'Problem is with Shruthi'

1230
01:11:57,394 --> 01:12:00,074
When he knew he was getting
headlong into a problem like this

1231
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:03,339
...to save himself from the mess
he has created these 6 characters

1232
01:12:03,364 --> 01:12:04,886
Sandeep, don't trust anyone

1233
01:12:04,911 --> 01:12:06,911
I'm there for you
Stop the car

1234
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:10,968
Sandeep, my son, listen to me
Please don't trust him

1235
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,753
'Stop the car
Baba, stop!'

1236
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,559
Sandeep, stop

1237
01:12:17,263 --> 01:12:19,543
Sandeep...please stop

1238
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,738
Sandeep, you must forget everything

1239
01:12:21,763 --> 01:12:23,323
Forget everything about Shruthi

1240
01:12:23,363 --> 01:12:25,841
'She tried to brand you a lunatic
I was the one who saved you'

1241
01:12:25,866 --> 01:12:28,426
Hey Sandeep
Son of a gun, I'll kill you

1242
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:30,291
No one can save you, Sandeep

1243
01:12:30,316 --> 01:12:33,076
No one can harm you
I'm there for you

1244
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,511
Please listen to me

1245
01:12:35,536 --> 01:12:37,094
'Stop, Sandeep'

1246
01:12:39,453 --> 01:12:41,853
Though none of them are
intertwined with each other

1247
01:12:41,878 --> 01:12:45,438
...these 6 characters are figment
of his imagination in Sandeep's mind

1248
01:12:45,463 --> 01:12:48,383
Doctor, out of these 6 characters
who killed Shruthi?

1249
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:51,443
- Sandeep, wait
- Sandeep, stop

1250
01:12:51,923 --> 01:12:53,843
'Sandeep, stop'

1251
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:56,483
'Sandeep, listen to me'

1252
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:05,727
[overlap of imaginary voices]

1253
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:35,806
Sandeep, wait

1254
01:13:36,774 --> 01:13:39,174
Sandeep, wait

1255
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:42,324
- Sandeep, wait
- Please stop

1256
01:13:42,349 --> 01:13:44,029
Sandeep, stop

1257
01:13:44,054 --> 01:13:45,414
Sandeep, wait

1258
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,320
Please wait
Listen to me

1259
01:13:47,345 --> 01:13:49,145
Sandeep, stop

1260
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,719
Wait, listen to me

1261
01:13:50,744 --> 01:13:53,464
Sandeep, come out
Son of a gun!

1262
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:55,889
Open the door
Otherwise I'll kill you

1263
01:13:55,991 --> 01:13:58,231
- Open the door
- I raised you like my own son

1264
01:13:58,256 --> 01:13:59,856
I'm there for you, son

1265
01:14:02,135 --> 01:14:03,375
Yes

1266
01:14:03,545 --> 01:14:04,470
Superb!

1267
01:14:04,495 --> 01:14:07,255
Send your force immediately
We will also leave right now

1268
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,360
Did they find out Sandeep's hideout?
You ordered a team to be dispatched

1269
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:12,990
Using the # Ranjani gave
we were able to track him

1270
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,430
- Chapter closed
- Let's go

1271
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:17,830
Come out
Don't be scared

1272
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,790
- I am there for you
- Go away

1273
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,480
- Come out
- Get lost, I don't want anyone

1274
01:14:21,505 --> 01:14:23,276
'Don't trust any of them, son'

1275
01:14:23,301 --> 01:14:25,701
Come out, better open the door

1276
01:14:25,726 --> 01:14:27,045
I am talking only to you!

1277
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,510
'We are trying to save him
What are you doing, Khaleel?'

1278
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:31,230
- Don't trust anyone
- Please shut up!

1279
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,630
You shut up
Saving him?

1280
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,550
- Yes
- You are the cause of his problems

1281
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,550
You should have been killed long ago

1282
01:14:36,575 --> 01:14:38,335
'Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?'

1283
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,190
Are you really friends?

1284
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,110
'He's a good man
Such an innocent soul'

1285
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,990
You've ganged up, made him a murderer

1286
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:45,870
- Blaming us?
- It was all your fault

1287
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,590
You killed Aneendra and
framed Sandeep for that murder

1288
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:53,576
If you truly love Sandeep
where were you when his father hit him?

1289
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:55,881
What the fuck are you doing, huh?

1290
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,710
'Sandeep, open the door'

1291
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,110
Listen to me, Sandeep

1292
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:05,399
- Go away
- Listen only to me, Sandeep

1293
01:15:05,463 --> 01:15:07,063
I don't want any of you

1294
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:11,079
Sandeep, forget about Shruthi completely

1295
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,590
Just remember you did nothing wrong

1296
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:19,230
The fact Shruthi is dead
and even how she died

1297
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,070
Forget everything

1298
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,640
- 'Step out'
- Sandeep, please

1299
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,430
'Listen to me'

1300
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:35,510
'Shruthi won't be just my wife, aunty'

1301
01:15:36,421 --> 01:15:38,124
'I will cherish her as my breath!'

1302
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:39,509
Please come out

1303
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,289
Come out
For my sake

1304
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,830
Sandeep, relax

1305
01:15:56,579 --> 01:15:58,059
Forget everything

1306
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:00,330
Forget EVERYTHING!

1307
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,070
How can I forget something I don't know?

1308
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,470
You know everything

1309
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:09,590
It is all locked in your mind
safe and sound

1310
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,910
Recollect

1311
01:16:11,638 --> 01:16:12,998
Try to rewind

1312
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,110
Please try

1313
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:16,510
When was the last time
you spoke to Shruthi?

1314
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:18,590
Try and recollect that occasion

1315
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:19,950
Think it over calmly

1316
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,630
Try, Sandeep, try

1317
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,619
'We need to go to the doctor today'

1318
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:30,070
'Please, Sandeep, you have to come'

1319
01:16:35,355 --> 01:16:38,355
You must somehow make it today, Sandeep

1320
01:16:39,339 --> 01:16:41,179
You need to know about yourself

1321
01:16:57,536 --> 01:16:59,576
We'll keep it confidential

1322
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:01,325
Please, Sandy

1323
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:03,870
We need to know what is reality
and what is fantasy

1324
01:17:09,267 --> 01:17:11,947
Hey! No, Shruthi
I told you 1000 times

1325
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:13,605
Don't irritate me

1326
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,110
Don't force me again
to consult a doctor

1327
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:18,430
What happened to you, Sandy?

1328
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:21,550
You take care of me so well sometimes
Suddenly you change like this

1329
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,270
I am not able to fathom you

1330
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,910
How can you change so quickly?

1331
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,350
- Tell me, Sandeep
- I have changed

1332
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:28,950
I have changed

1333
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:30,230
Happy, huh?

1334
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,990
How many times have I told you?
Sandeep is innocent and to leave him alone

1335
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,110
You bitches don't listen, right?

1336
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,110
Doctor is right
You're mentally ill, Sandeep

1337
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,630
You are maligning my friend Sandeep

1338
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:45,150
He won't come anywhere

1339
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:50,070
Baby...please listen to me just once

1340
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,750
- Please, baby, please
- Leave me alone

1341
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,430
- Just this once
- LEAVE ME!

1342
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:56,310
Leave me alone
Don't you get it in your thick skull?

1343
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:59,485
Should it always be your way?
Won't you ever listen to my wishes?

1344
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:03,230
One time, you will love me madly, deeply
Then you will behave like a lunatic

1345
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,230
You are mentally ill, Sandeep

1346
01:18:06,499 --> 01:18:07,699
I love you, baby

1347
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:09,164
For my sake, only this time-

1348
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,510
FUCK YOU, BITCH!

1349
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,750
Don't you get it?

1350
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,310
She won't understand!

1351
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,390
I hate women

1352
01:18:48,026 --> 01:18:49,986
Hey! What are you doing?

1353
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,030
Nothing should happen
to my friend Sandeep

1354
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:54,350
Get away from me

1355
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:58,110
Sandeep, if you've really loved me
you must come with me

1356
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,685
Come with me to the clinic

1357
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:02,350
Otherwise I will kill myself right now

1358
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:11,950
You want to die, my love?

1359
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,670
I will let you die

1360
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:58,550
No...no

1361
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:01,150
I didn't kill my wife

1362
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:03,230
I didn't kill Shruthi
No...no...no

1363
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:06,016
That's fine, buddy
You killed that bitch

1364
01:20:06,041 --> 01:20:09,201
- All these bitches
- I didn't kill my wife

1365
01:20:09,226 --> 01:20:11,866
- You are lying
- I will kill you

1366
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:14,971
You are the one who killed everyone

1367
01:20:14,996 --> 01:20:16,150
I tell you

1368
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,310
You are the murderer

1369
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,510
Stop it!

1370
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:21,190
This isn't the time to be arguing

1371
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:24,110
- Just stop it
- Any need to fight now?

1372
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:30,510
[siren wailing]

1373
01:20:30,804 --> 01:20:33,364
Sandeep, don't listen to any of them

1374
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:37,270
- Please trust me
- Hey! Stop it

1375
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,430
I can hear the police car's siren

1376
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,070
Come on, move...move, fast

1377
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,855
Surround the entire area

1378
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:57,030
Go, cover the entire area

1379
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:18,390
Sandeep, time to surrender

1380
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:22,950
Sandeep, escape now

1381
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:25,190
- Sandeep, open the door
- Come with me, son

1382
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:27,070
- Come with me
- Surrender!

1383
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,350
- Sandeep, come
- Escape, my son

1384
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,590
Run, Sandeep

1385
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,190
Baba

1386
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,470
- Sandeep
- Sandeep, he is dead

1387
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:43,910
The cops are here, run

1388
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:45,950
Run, Sandeep
Listen to me

1389
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,350
Shit!

1390
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,710
The cops are here, Sandeep

1391
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,870
- Run for your life
- Hey! Sandeep

1392
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:58,710
Just shut up! Enough of torturing him
You've been doing it all his life

1393
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,550
- Hey Sandeep
- Not listening to me

1394
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:07,470
You run, Sandeep

1395
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:32,510
Sandeep, stop

1396
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,670
Sandeep...go

1397
01:22:34,988 --> 01:22:37,108
Get away from here

1398
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:47,470
SANDEEEEP!

1399
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,030
Khaleel

1400
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:53,150
Khaleel

1401
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,230
Sandeep

1402
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,630
Go now

1403
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:57,790
Escape

1404
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:00,390
Surrender, Sandeep

1405
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:02,390
Get away from here, Sandeep

1406
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:03,670
Khaleel

1407
01:24:05,826 --> 01:24:07,386
- No
- He is the bloody murderer

1408
01:24:07,411 --> 01:24:08,811
'I don't want any of you'

1409
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,950
Khaleel

1410
01:24:24,532 --> 01:24:25,812
Khaleel!

1411
01:24:25,925 --> 01:24:27,005
Sandeep

1412
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:29,350
'Did you think I was dead?'

1413
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:34,030
'Khaleel will always be with you'

1414
01:24:34,516 --> 01:24:36,516
'Always a part of you'

1415
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:38,196
'Keep this in mind always'

1416
01:24:38,221 --> 01:24:41,781
'Don't trust these bitches!'

1417
01:24:53,371 --> 01:24:55,691
[police siren wailing]
