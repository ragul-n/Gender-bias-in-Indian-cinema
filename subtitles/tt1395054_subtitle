00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:32,432
Crossfire in pydhonie
and dockyard road.

3
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:34,933
Report urgently.

4
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:36,666
Crossfire in dongri.

5
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:38,769
All mobile units report quickly.

6
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,738
Crossfire in pydhonie
and dockyard road.

7
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:43,711
Report urgently.

8
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:45,812
Inspector chauhan,
please come in.

9
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:49,613
Inspector chauhan,
please come in.

10
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:52,653
Please come in, headquarters
calling.

11
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:53,825
Why don't you answer it?

12
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:55,287
It's been buzzing all day.

13
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:56,420
Let mumbai burn.

14
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,190
I'm not moving from here.

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,464
What do you think?

16
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:02,358
Who could've done this?

17
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,863
Only agnel sir can answer that.

18
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:06,968
Sir. - What happened?

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,200
Agnel sir has regained
consciousness.

20
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:08,966
Come on.

21
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:14,804
Sir.

22
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,482
What happened?

23
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:19,409
Who was it?

24
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:20,951
Who did this?

25
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,115
Just give me his name.

26
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:27,893
He'll rot in jail for
the rest of his life.

27
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,620
Tell me, sir. Who was it?

28
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,122
Agnel wilson.

29
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:35,193
What?

30
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,868
I've already investigated.

31
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,602
Nobody's behind it.

32
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:42,338
What do you mean? - I mean he
tried to commit suicide.

33
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:45,509
What nonsense... - chauhan,
there's no dent on the car...

34
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,607
...nor any damage.

35
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,548
I inquired with the villagers.

36
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:50,614
There was no accident
or brake failure.

37
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,581
They saw him drive the
car into the gorge.

38
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:00,988
You will have to tell me, agnel.

39
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,325
Why did you take
such a big step?

40
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,527
Why did you try to
commit suicide?

41
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:12,263
You're giving up at a time
when i need you the most.

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,007
Were you trying to
evade your duty...

43
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:16,741
...or were you scared?

44
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:23,414
No sir... i was trying
to evade myself.

45
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:33,484
But i won't die so easily after
the trouble i've put this city into.

46
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,859
You're not responsible for
what's going on in the city, agnel.

47
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,125
Mumbai is dormant in the
sound of explosions.

48
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:47,535
And the reason behind it... is me.

49
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,573
I tried to lock horns
with one man.

50
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:59,117
But today... the entire city
is paying the price.

51
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:00,316
Which man?

52
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,151
Who are you talking about?

53
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,222
Sultan mirza.

54
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,025
Sultan mirza?

55
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,621
This story began with
sultan mirza.

56
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,896
Few years after the
independence...

57
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,964
...madras was graced with floods.

58
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,800
After losing everything...

59
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,674
...that small boy came to mumbai.

60
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,210
If it wasn't for the floods...

61
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:38,585
...then sultan and mumbai
might've never met.

62
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,427
He got a job at the docks.

63
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:52,365
I heard that he was paid
only 25 paise...

64
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,869
...after working all
day in the furnace.

65
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:10,189
Even at that juvenile age...

66
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,987
...sultan knew how to
conquer hearts.

67
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:24,334
If you give me this money
then what about you?

68
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:27,229
Blessings. I'll thrive
on your blessings.

69
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,097
You're an elder person.

70
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,335
And with your blessings someday
i'll make it big.

71
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:34,871
You don't have a penny...

72
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,672
...but talk like a 'sultan'
(emperor).

73
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:42,177
That day he got a name.

74
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,913
'Sultan'.

75
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,363
His juvenile age and
innocence aided him.

76
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:09,676
The journey to be the
master had begun.

77
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,979
No one knew that one day...

78
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:20,590
...a stowaway would
rule the seas.

79
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,524
But it was reality.

80
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:30,097
Because he had only
one principle.

81
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:34,769
Sultan, we shouldn't
help pathan.

82
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:36,739
He's our enemy.

83
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,868
Patrick, when we
can be friends...

84
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:43,906
...then why take up enmity.

85
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:48,516
The truck is loaded with
gold worth 600,000.

86
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,523
The police know this gold will
be smuggled in the city.

87
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,959
That's why there's strict
security on every road.

88
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,100
The goods will be delivered.

89
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:05,931
But how will it be possible?
- Just like you were.

90
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:11,376
With the grace of god, hard
work and lot of dedication.

91
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,174
The job will be done.

92
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:21,077
We need to check.

93
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,618
Check properly. - Yes, sir.

94
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,133
What's inside this?

95
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:20,028
Why aren't you raising
the barricade...

96
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,697
...we're getting late.

97
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,301
We'll miss the train.

98
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,144
Sultan.

99
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:22,601
Sultan!

100
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:29,900
Get away, sultan!

101
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:31,709
Move!

102
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,976
You're brave and compassionate.

103
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,977
You'll be respected by all.

104
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:33,263
Sultan was in love with mumbai.

105
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:37,974
He didn't want mumbai to
be gripped with terror.

106
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,908
That's why he had a meeting...

107
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,609
...with pathan, vishnu,
wardhan and varghese.

108
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:48,652
Each has cunning men.

109
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:50,988
They're strong.

110
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:56,192
If we fight amongst ourselves
we'll be at loss.

111
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:00,456
Think about it.

112
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:02,827
Do you want to end it all...

113
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:05,832
...or make a new beginning?

114
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,976
What... do you want
to say, sultan?

115
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,212
Which station do you have the
most influence, wardhan?

116
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,408
Dharavi. - Fine.

117
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,577
From dharavi to parel station...

118
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,249
...none of us will interfere
in your work.

119
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:29,590
Sultan, what if we don't
agree to this division?

120
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:38,101
I wanted all of us to prosper
in our business.

121
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,101
There.

122
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:46,475
Kill each other.

123
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,308
If we fight each other it'll
make the police's job easier.

124
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:50,716
And not for us.

125
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,855
Pathan, when we can be friends...

126
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,524
...then why take up enmity?

127
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:09,228
From dongri to sion station
is your area.

128
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:16,674
Varghese, from colaba to
tardeo is your area.

129
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,670
I've heard that you speak
fluent english.

130
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,471
It'll be useful.

131
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,717
Vishnu, from bandra to versova.

132
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:30,219
You're dividing the city as per
the police stations, sultan.

133
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,320
They might be police stations...

134
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,154
...but we're the commissioners
of the city.

135
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,599
Sultan, you've divided the
entire city amongst us.

136
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,398
What about you?

137
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:48,798
To be precise, entire
mumbai belongs to me.

138
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,234
And i don't need a piece of
land for doing business.

139
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,178
I have the sea.

140
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,312
The sea unites india from
the rest of the country.

141
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:08,858
If we control the sea our
ships will never sink.

142
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,323
Those who had the strength
to change circumstances...

143
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,866
...were the ones that were alive.

144
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:23,669
They began smuggling everything
that we banned.

145
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:29,411
They used the law to climb
the ladder of success.

146
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,879
Mr. Dagger. Owns six mills.

147
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,350
Had a quarrel with his brother.

148
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,013
It's the police's job.

149
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,185
I will have to pay them as well.

150
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,347
I don't do everything for money.

151
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,155
Sultan, don't disappoint me.

152
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,358
Hail a taxi for mr. Daggar.

153
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,766
Why would i take a taxi?

154
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:57,042
I've a car... - as i said, i don't
do everything for money.

155
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,922
Please spare me something, son.

156
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,526
Feed him well.

157
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,058
And pray for me.

158
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,466
I'm not scared of the
law, get that.

159
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,374
As soon as i'm released...

160
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:33,002
...l'll throw you out
of the house.

161
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,410
Hey, quiet.

162
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,812
Come on.

163
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,081
Who are you?

164
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:49,725
I hate those who don't
respect their mother.

165
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,019
Remember the name.

166
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,065
Sultan mirza.

167
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,376
Sultan was with everyone.

168
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,905
Sultan extended a helping hand...

169
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:13,943
...to everyone that the
government failed to.

170
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:19,614
The old fables had
only one king.

171
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,124
But there are two in this one.

172
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,194
One became the king
with his courage.

173
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,729
And the other was obstinate
about becoming one.

174
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,355
Hurry up, quickly. - Yes.

175
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,393
Hurry up. - Yes.

176
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,460
Stealing.

177
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:05,263
What's your name? - Shoaib khan.

178
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:07,138
And you? - Javed.

179
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,742
You haven't started wearing
pants yet and are already stealing.

180
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,237
It's easier to run in knickers.

181
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:14,574
Back answering.

182
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:15,938
Come to the police station.

183
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:19,016
You won't get a medal for
getting me arrested.

184
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,010
Keep half the coins,
slap me few times...

185
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,313
...and end this matter
right here.

186
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,152
Petty thief, what
are you saying?

187
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:27,592
You're speaking as if
you're sultan mirza.

188
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,788
Who is your father?

189
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:29,787
What is his name?

190
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:31,391
I'll call him to the police
station as well.

191
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:32,658
There's no need to call him.

192
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:33,956
You'll find him right there.

193
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,392
He's a police officer.

194
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,425
Sub-inspector khan. - What?

195
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:39,029
Forget it, sir.

196
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,233
Father will beat. - You'll
learn your lesson then.

197
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:43,935
Come to the police
station, come on.

198
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,136
You're bigger and also stronger.

199
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:50,940
But remember, as i grow
up you will grow older.

200
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,949
As i grow stronger you'll
grow weaker.

201
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:55,983
Then i'll deal with you.

202
00:17:56,288 --> 00:18:00,782
I'll settle the score with
you then, with interest.

203
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:02,159
Old man.

204
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,634
Why are your needs growing
out of control, shoaib?

205
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:10,435
Tell me.

206
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:11,994
Tell me.

207
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,504
You've no shame or apology.

208
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:17,866
Look down!

209
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,338
Look down!

210
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:31,445
I will teach you a lesson
today, shoaib.

211
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:38,228
Khan, what are you doing?

212
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:40,689
You've slapped him five times.

213
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,335
Let him go.

214
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:44,970
He's only a child

215
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,798
five slaps, that makes
six with interest.

216
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:55,207
Every child had the desire
to be like sultan.

217
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,247
But sultan had only one desire.

218
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,115
Rihana.

219
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:05,120
The most beautiful and important
link of this story.

220
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:08,657
Rihana.

221
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,137
Congratulations, rihana ma'am.

222
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:29,913
You were terrific.

223
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:30,572
Congratulations.

224
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,173
Give me a chance
as well, please.

225
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,519
Sign my film as well. - Rihana.

226
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,414
Thank you very much for
attending our magazine's party.

227
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,184
My pleasure.

228
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:39,948
You acted as a child as well...

229
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,758
...and even today you're
a successful star.

230
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,120
Such a long innings, rihana.

231
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,158
How do you feel?

232
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,257
Whenever i would
act as i child...

233
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:48,355
...it would seem like a game.

234
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,998
And now i work because...

235
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,434
...l'm no longer of
the age to play.

236
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,208
This time you've won the
best actress award.

237
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,713
But don't feel too proud.

238
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:05,373
Four of my upcoming films
are with kaka.

239
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,716
Do you know what
people call him?

240
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,418
Actually, superstar... - ma'am,
one last question.

241
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,382
You're everyone's dream girl.

242
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,086
But who is your dream man?

243
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:19,229
It's neither a superstar
nor a jubilee star.

244
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,360
My dream man will be the one...

245
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,765
...that wins my heart
in seven seconds.

246
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:28,405
Is everything set?

247
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,141
Chandru, stop the car.

248
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:34,801
Rihana ma'am is here.

249
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,481
Just a minute, brother.

250
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,111
It's your first meeting.

251
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:41,575
Don't go empty-handed.

252
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:56,594
25 paise, sir.

253
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:02,634
This is bigger, it
must be expensive.

254
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:03,999
Sir, pick anyone you like.

255
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:05,234
They all cost 25 paise.

256
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,278
Consider that this is the
last guava on the planet.

257
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,513
You won't find anymore guavas.

258
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,281
How much does it cost
now? - Four rupees.

259
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:22,293
Consider that mumtaz has
grown it herself.

260
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,988
Salim would carry this guava
and not a flower.

261
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,294
How much does it cost
now? - Forty rupees.

262
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:32,863
Consider that adam ate this
guava and not the apple.

263
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:36,271
How much does it cost now?
- Four hundred rupees.

264
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:37,699
Yes.

265
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:39,739
Four hundred rupees.

266
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,477
Get me a chair.

267
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:48,683
Why don't you rest here
until he gets a chair?

268
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:52,214
Women can't rest until men like
you are on this planet.

269
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:54,988
Don't pretend to be too decent.

270
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,619
You're an open book.

271
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:59,027
It won't make a difference
if i read a few pages.

272
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,660
It'll benefit you, get it.

273
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,434
Better learn some decency.

274
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,436
It's much more important
for you.

275
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,604
A small gift for you.

276
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,509
Please accept it.

277
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:14,943
Who are you?

278
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,115
I bought it for four
hundred rupees.

279
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,276
I couldn't find anything
expensive...

280
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,185
...so i bought it for
a high price.

281
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:25,523
Take a look everyone.

282
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,455
Rihana's admirer has
bought a guava...

283
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,858
...worth four hundred
rupees for her.

284
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:32,159
You've given it, now get lost.

285
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:34,225
Would you like to have dinner
tonight with me?

286
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,991
Silly man, have you lost it?

287
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:41,068
Does rihana have dinner with
ordinary people like you?

288
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:43,602
Those who have the
same destination...

289
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:45,743
...meet on the path.

290
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,981
Hey poet, stop reading
your sonnets.

291
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:52,707
Or i'll knock your lights out.

292
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:54,617
What is this?

293
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:55,885
What are you doing?

294
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:57,546
I'm trying to express my
feelings and you're butting in.

295
00:22:58,023 --> 00:22:58,853
Have you lost your mind?

296
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:00,118
Do you know who you're
talking to?

297
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,557
I've seen some of your films.

298
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:03,651
You laugh just like
a dog panting.

299
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:05,191
I'll have you thrown
out right now.

300
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:07,665
Laugh. - What is your name?

301
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:08,495
Laugh. Laugh.

302
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,464
What is your name?

303
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:10,498
Laugh.

304
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,094
Come here, boy.

305
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:15,168
Tell him my name.

306
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:16,466
Sultan mirza.

307
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:21,304
Sultan... sultan... l'm
terribly sorry.

308
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,875
I really don't know how to
act, sultan... - quiet.

309
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:29,044
Tonight at eight, i'll
wait for you.

310
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:32,018
At your favourite spot.

311
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:36,692
Sultan. Sultan.

312
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:38,621
Rihana. - Quiet.

313
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:48,435
Sir, menu. - Potatoes
and cauliflower.

314
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,370
Okay, sir.

315
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,274
Potatoes and cauliflower
today as well?

316
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:57,740
Right sir.

317
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:01,646
Sir, your favourite potatoes
and cauliflower

318
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:27,708
i don't believe it...

319
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,678
...but i knew that you'd
surely come.

320
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,548
Sultan mirza, right.

321
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:33,280
What are you doing here?

322
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:37,080
Didn't i say, i'll be waiting
for you at your favourite spot?

323
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,648
So i'm doing just that.

324
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,423
You still remember that.

325
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:48,222
It's been 15-20 days since
that incident. - 18.

326
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,392
I've been waiting for
the past 18 days...

327
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:52,027
...and eating potatoes and
cauliflower everyday.

328
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:53,696
Why potatoes and cauliflower?

329
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,631
I heard that it's
your favourite.

330
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,406
Shall i order it for you?

331
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,337
You'll have to eat alone
today as well.

332
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,972
I'm not here to see you...

333
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:04,709
...but for hearing the
story of a film.

334
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,054
And order bitter gourd today.

335
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,621
I like that as well.

336
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,218
Ismail. - Yes, sir.

337
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,195
Bitter gourd. - Okay, sir.

338
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,644
Are you here to listen
to a story...

339
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:42,413
...or will our story
finally move ahead?

340
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,689
A restless man ends up
burning his tongue...

341
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,622
...and can't savour
the food either.

342
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:51,685
Can i say something?

343
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:58,665
Whenever any hero touches
you on screen...

344
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:02,565
i close my eyes.

345
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,397
Why is that?

346
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:07,971
I don't know.

347
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:12,545
Whenever you're on the screen...

348
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:15,576
...l'm seated on the seat.

349
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:17,483
Why is that?

350
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:20,055
I don't know.

351
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:26,064
That film 'unpade bhav'.

352
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,391
When you tell the hero...

353
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,759
...that i'm pregnant
with your child.

354
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:36,504
I swear, you weren't
looking pregnant...

355
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,203
...and i even decided
a name for the baby.

356
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:49,712
Can i... touch you once?
- Why is that?

357
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:53,748
I always bought a ticket
to see you.

358
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:56,754
Today when you're before me...

359
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:00,562
...i want to see whether it's
a dream or reality.

360
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:05,899
Who are you? - Sultan mirza.

361
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:10,341
I know your name and have
seen its effect.

362
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:15,612
But who is sultan mirza.
- I don't know.

363
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:20,642
Don't ask why is that.

364
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,257
Happy birthday.

365
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,256
Do you have a dictionary...

366
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:38,268
...which makes it easy for
you to understand?

367
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:40,264
Why is that?

368
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,232
You said that it's your
birthday celebration.

369
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,274
But it's just the two of us.

370
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,409
I heard that two people
can make up a world.

371
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:51,145
Can't we at least celebrate?

372
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:54,010
And anyway i'm celebrating
for the first time.

373
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:55,218
Why is that?

374
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:56,777
I never came across anyone...

375
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:58,852
...who was happy to see me alive.

376
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,956
I never enjoyed celebrating
my birthday either.

377
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:05,956
Many people would arrive
with lots of gifts...

378
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:08,896
...and i had to pay the price.

379
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:12,067
And that was not agreeable.

380
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:16,536
Even today those moments
give me a nightmare.

381
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:22,402
I've brought three
gifts for you.

382
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:25,477
There's a riddle
with every gift.

383
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:27,946
If you solve it, the
gift will be yours.

384
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:32,153
The first gift.

385
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:37,356
Since childhood you've been
in and out of this thing.

386
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:41,423
One such thing.

387
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:44,830
Jail. - No.

388
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:46,431
Handcuffs.

389
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:50,541
White shirt. Just
as you like it.

390
00:28:55,147 --> 00:29:00,244
Don't you like colours? - No.

391
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,746
I love black. - The reason
for this liking.

392
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,219
I spent my childhood
in dark nights...

393
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:09,184
...and my youth doing dark deeds.

394
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:11,652
I used to work at the docks.

395
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,428
I would fill coal in the crates.

396
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,865
And that darkness became
a part of me.

397
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,470
To be precise, i would
shed black tears...

398
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,010
...and see black dreams.

399
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:29,176
Since then these eyes
haven't rested.

400
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:34,379
My second gift.

401
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:40,651
It contains something that
you've kept away from your neck.

402
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:44,488
That law.

403
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:47,196
It's a tie

404
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:52,032
have you ever seen
me wearing a tie?

405
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:54,605
Have you seen me eating a guava?

406
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:56,564
But you did bring it for me.

407
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:58,233
You can forget about
the third riddle.

408
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:00,810
It's a watch.

409
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:02,673
Take a look how it is.

410
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:13,083
What happened? Didn't
you like it?

411
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:16,453
But it isn't working.

412
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,923
Mr. Mirza, it doesn't
function on its own.

413
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:22,231
Wear it on your wrist.

414
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,598
It will work according
to your heartbeat.

415
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,666
I hope the heartbeat
controls this thing.

416
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,838
This shouldn't control
my heartbeats.

417
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,770
Because if it stops
then i might...

418
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:40,045
i finally found you.

419
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:41,414
God brought me closer to you.

420
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:42,851
I chanted only you.

421
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:44,182
I sung only about you.

422
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:45,587
I finally found you.

423
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,215
I hid you from everyone.

424
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,589
You were my only dream.

425
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,252
I dreamed only about you.

426
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:54,924
You entered my life and
made it complete.

427
00:30:56,201 --> 00:31:00,331
Love became my religion
and my creed.

428
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:02,970
I finally found you.

429
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,201
God brought me closer to you.

430
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,675
I chanted only you.

431
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,176
I sung only about you.

432
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:08,576
I finally found you.

433
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:10,046
I hid you from everyone.

434
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:11,445
You were my only dream.

435
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,881
I dreamed only about you.

436
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:17,853
You entered my life and
made it complete.

437
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:24,557
I dream only about your love.

438
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:31,899
Now my days and nights are
filled with glitters.

439
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:38,871
You entered my life and
made it complete.

440
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:56,191
I finally found you.

441
00:31:56,261 --> 00:32:01,995
God brought me closer to you.

442
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:10,470
I chanted only you.

443
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:16,040
I sung only about you.

444
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:21,718
I finally found you.

445
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:32,589
You have made my life.

446
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:34,426
You were my only dream.

447
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:35,659
I dreamed only about you.

448
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,064
The distance isn't romantic.

449
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:38,396
Let me hide you in my arms.

450
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,798
You are on top of my
list of my desires.

451
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:41,299
Everyday i wish to meet you.

452
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,567
I won in love but
lost my heart.

453
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:43,801
You entered my life and
made it complete.

454
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:48,302
This is the time when i
was posted in mumbai.

455
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,614
Mumbai is always gripped
with darkness.

456
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:59,279
And this darkness also houses...

457
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:02,485
...some dangerous people.

458
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,566
Shoaib.

459
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:22,311
Where are you going?

460
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:25,706
Where are you posted
today? - Bandra.

461
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,690
For the first time you're
headed the right way.

462
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,150
I'm going that way as well.

463
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:37,420
Take a look.

464
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:40,625
You hit this one.

465
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:48,897
Father. - What?

466
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,275
See you.

467
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:04,181
Father's been posted
here tonight.

468
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:06,217
Should we postpone
it for tomorrow?

469
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:08,687
If i postpone it for tomorrow...

470
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:09,987
...then today day will feel bad.

471
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:11,462
Come on.

472
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:15,897
What's the job?

473
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:35,444
What are you doing?

474
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:00,408
What do you want?

475
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:01,978
What do you want?

476
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,446
Look, you've been
badly thrashed.

477
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:06,475
You can't go home in
this condition.

478
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,646
Do you see that house? - Yes.

479
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:12,857
Go there, ring the bell
call the doctor...

480
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:14,490
...and keep the door open.

481
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:16,093
Come on.

482
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:20,758
Save me. Save me.

483
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,764
Who is it at this late
hour? Take a look.

484
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:26,234
Who are you? What happened?

485
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:29,706
They're beating me, save
me. - Who is he?

486
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:37,478
Save me.

487
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:39,049
It's paining.

488
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:40,812
They both thrashed me.

489
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:14,348
This is expensive.

490
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,514
How is it, ma'am?

491
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,419
Show me that one.

492
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,118
This.

493
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:26,926
This is the latest design.

494
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:31,831
They're nice, but i can't
make up my mind.

495
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:35,302
Shoaib.

496
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:36,839
You can't understand
which one to buy...

497
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:37,966
...and i don't understand you.

498
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:42,878
Get lost. - What?

499
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:45,440
Get lost.

500
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,847
Shoaib, what are you doing?

501
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:48,448
Wait, ma'am.

502
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:50,310
If you don't leave...

503
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:53,023
...l'll strip of the jewellery
that you're wearing.

504
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:53,853
Shoaib, what are you doing?

505
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,289
What is this insolence?
- No, ma'am.

506
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,891
Please sit, take a look... - i
don't want to be slandered.

507
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:00,589
Ma'am. Ma'am.

508
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,927
She's aged yet she wants
buy jewellery.

509
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:04,590
Ma'am. Ma'am...

510
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,762
you'll never reform.

511
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,240
This is the age to be spoilt.

512
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:12,801
Don't spoil yourself
so much that later...

513
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:15,108
...you won't be able to reform.
- I haven't even...

514
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,612
...spoiled myself completely yet.

515
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,214
And you're trying to reform me.

516
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:22,442
Just tell me why you're here.

517
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,194
Do you want to sell it?
- I want to adorn it.

518
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,631
Who? - Her.

519
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:42,932
You.

520
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:45,876
Who did you steal it from?

521
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:50,980
What did you say?

522
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:52,976
You think i'm a thief!

523
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,077
I cut people's throat.

524
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,620
Fine, i don't want
to give it to you.

525
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:01,187
Shoaib.

526
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:02,920
Fine, don't get angry.

527
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:05,593
Leave my hand.

528
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:07,728
Where else will you
go if i leave you?

529
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:12,730
Sho... shoaib, what are you doing?

530
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,436
Spoiling myself.

531
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,231
Shoaib. - You can reform me.

532
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,437
Couldn't you wait until evening?

533
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:22,042
If i had waited until evening
this morning would've felt bad.

534
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:32,681
Shoaib.

535
00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:36,652
Shoaib, leave.

536
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,906
Agnel, you've to eradicate crime
and not just stop it.

537
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:55,242
The mafia's in bombay
and they're growing.

538
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:57,309
If they aren't stopped...

539
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:59,239
...then no one will be
able to do anything.

540
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:05,281
Just five men who aren't evenly
formally educated...

541
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:08,985
...yet they control
the entire city.

542
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:12,485
Their reach is better than
national television.

543
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,224
Any personal enmities?
- There could've been.

544
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:18,093
But sultan never let
there be any.

545
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:21,261
He divided them to
bring them closer.

546
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:25,541
You do know her, don't you?

547
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:27,310
Everyone knows her.

548
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,273
Famous film-star rihana.

549
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,248
What's more popular is...

550
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:36,615
...these days she's getting too
personal with sultan mirza.

551
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:40,253
Everyone else keeps
a low profile.

552
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:44,987
But sultan's in the
news everyday.

553
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,832
Think about it.

554
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:54,030
The youth today that have
to move mountains...

555
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:55,902
...for a small job.

556
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,475
For them sultan is god.

557
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:01,538
Follow his path...

558
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:04,513
...and bungalow, car, film-star
will follow.

559
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:07,310
The crime world might be filled
with comforts, sir...

560
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:09,979
...but they all lead to the jail.

561
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,713
It's not easy to put
him behind bars.

562
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:19,960
The task can be difficult, sir
but it's never impossible.

563
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:25,260
You leave it to me, sir.

564
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:26,835
Good luck.

565
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:32,075
Ramu. Moti.

566
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:35,543
Where is everyone?

567
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:37,847
Why isn't there any light
in the house? - Cut.

568
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:41,674
Who said cut?

569
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:43,175
Full lights.

570
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:47,290
Who said cut when i'm present?

571
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:48,449
Take the camera.

572
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:49,884
Seal everything.

573
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,391
Get everyone in the
line, come on.

574
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:53,289
What's all this?

575
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:54,896
Who are you?

576
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,363
First you say cut now you're
giving out directions...

577
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:58,799
...who are you?

578
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:01,228
This isn't a movie scene
but a governmental raid.

579
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:04,868
And the government has appointed
me to direct it.

580
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:09,908
Acp agnel wilson. Bombay police.

581
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:11,940
Stop everything, come on.

582
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:14,014
Sir, madam is refusing
to stand in the queue.

583
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:17,815
She's no ordinary person,
murli, but the boss.

584
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:21,682
Sultan mirza's favourite.

585
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,953
So she's bound to be egoistic.

586
00:41:26,697 --> 00:41:28,426
There's no point in showing
attitude to me.

587
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:31,697
I'll believe it only if you do
the same before sultan mirza.

588
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:37,140
I'm sure sultan mirza
will hear...

589
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:42,242
...about my attitude
and my message.

590
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:47,146
We've strong evidence
to prove that...

591
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:52,245
...rihana's lover sultan mirza is
investing in all her films.

592
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,719
Sultan hasn't earned this money
through right means.

593
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,396
So a movie made from illegal
money is illegal as well.

594
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:04,491
Stop everything. - No,
please don't do this.

595
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:06,633
I'll suffer losses
worth millions.

596
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,032
If you want to restart shooting
your film... - yes.

597
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,641
Then next time cast a star...

598
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:16,874
...that doesn't have any contacts
with smugglers.

599
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,286
Even better if he hates them.

600
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:25,421
Otherwise, your films
will begin...

601
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,356
...but i won't let them end.

602
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:30,820
Come on, stop everything.

603
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:41,070
Madam, we still haven't
received permission...

604
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:43,038
...so the shooting has
been cancelled today.

605
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:46,670
Its either the location or
scripts not finalised

606
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:49,072
and sometimes the hero
doesn't give dates.

607
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:51,474
So the shooting's cancelled
today as well.

608
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:53,684
Fine.

609
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:25,447
For me this is just like
betraying the country for you.

610
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:30,709
It's better to be disloyal
than betray the country.

611
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:35,319
Love means more then
me than being loyal.

612
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:39,061
Then what are you doing here?

613
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,428
Staying alive is much
more important.

614
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:46,229
A person's weakness is far
greater than his strength.

615
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,097
You're sultan's weakness.

616
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:51,841
And your weakness is acting.

617
00:43:52,443 --> 00:43:54,468
You had me sacked
from two films.

618
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:57,077
You won.

619
00:43:57,515 --> 00:43:58,948
Have you got the evidence?

620
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:02,482
What other motive can
i have to meet you?

621
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:09,424
Here.

622
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:11,395
What's inside?

623
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:14,529
Lts sultan darkest secrets.

624
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,127
Quickly take a peek inside...

625
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:19,762
...before someone sees
me with you.

626
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:29,339
Please. Please, don't print
this photograph...

627
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,039
...otherwise everyone will know...

628
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:33,811
...this inspector has accepted
bribe to leave me alone.

629
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:36,451
That's front page news, madam.
It'll be published.

630
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:39,052
Oh, god. Please move.

631
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:41,088
Move. Let me go.

632
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,685
At least tell us the reason for
bribing the acp. - Let me go.

633
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:03,038
Jai hind, sir.

634
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:22,929
Aunt.

635
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,364
You always bring me good luck.

636
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:28,536
How is your son?

637
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:31,271
He's growing up just like
the inflation is.

638
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:34,004
Think about your son and
not the inflation.

639
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:35,979
Get him educated.

640
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,806
I'm there.

641
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:42,509
You do so much for me.

642
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:45,420
Just pray for me.

643
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:51,525
Sultan. He turned out
to be very cunning.

644
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,955
Agnel sir never realised
what hit him.

645
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,527
A cheap newspaper tarnished
his honour.

646
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:09,068
What will you do now, sir?

647
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,972
Transfer or resign?

648
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,617
Who are you? - What, sir?

649
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:15,849
Who are you?

650
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,179
Sohail khan.

651
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:19,020
Your rank.

652
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:23,125
Inspector sohail khan, bombay
police. Crime branch.

653
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:25,288
Do you have a wife?

654
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:29,899
Do you sleep with prostitutes?

655
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:31,358
With my wife?

656
00:46:32,903 --> 00:46:36,430
You work for the police.

657
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:39,268
Sir, no one can blame
me for that.

658
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,368
Do you misbehave with
your parents?

659
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:42,974
Do you mistreat them?

660
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,576
What are you saying?

661
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:46,710
I don't want to rot in hell.

662
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:50,479
When you don't do
anything wrong...

663
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:53,957
...inspector sohail khan, mumbai
police, crime branch...

664
00:46:55,259 --> 00:46:57,352
...then why are you praising
a goon's deed.

665
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,400
If now your blood doesn't boil
hearing sultan mirza's name...

666
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,502
...then i'll not spare
any of you.

667
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:12,901
No transfer, no resign.

668
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:15,078
I'll kick you out.

669
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:47,100
Your trick worked, sultan.

670
00:47:49,113 --> 00:47:51,513
But the war is far from over.

671
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,716
I just need one clue,
an opportunity...

672
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:01,489
...a pawn to finish you.

673
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:16,272
You'd be facing trial
and rotting in jail

674
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,134
if it wasn't for me.

675
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,379
That boy saw you but i... i
turned the case.

676
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:27,642
I said my son can never
do such a thing.

677
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:33,183
Don't stare.

678
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,358
Rot in prison for today.

679
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:50,134
That's the consequence
for such deeds. Sit.

680
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:54,439
Father.

681
00:48:55,379 --> 00:48:56,437
So, you finally learnt
your lesson.

682
00:48:57,881 --> 00:48:59,246
No, you're so stupid.

683
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:01,883
You didn't lock the door.

684
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:06,079
Why you...

685
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:06,884
khan.

686
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:23,432
It's good to be hot-blooded.

687
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:27,266
But it can ruin you if it
steers out of control.

688
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:30,246
There's no point in being calm.

689
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:35,208
Others take advantage
and then dispose off.

690
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:38,714
The law is made to calm such
hot-blooded people.

691
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:41,185
I feel the law is just
like my father.

692
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:48,363
Weak, helpless... poor. - Quiet

693
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:56,763
is that your law?

694
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,568
One slap, some preaching.

695
00:50:02,012 --> 00:50:03,001
One night in the cell.

696
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:13,446
An advice.

697
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,226
When you're addicted
to something...

698
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:20,956
...it becomes your identity.

699
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,296
I want to create an
identity, sir.

700
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:26,927
What else is there to
do in this city?

701
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:31,164
Even if the path's twisted.

702
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:33,234
If i think about the path...

703
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:36,843
...my destination will
turn its back on me.

704
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,287
Hello, sultan.

705
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:21,390
Which horse have you bet on?

706
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:27,495
Six. But you are not
here for that.

707
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:29,028
Get to the point.

708
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:32,827
We'll talk once the race ends.

709
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:37,038
What will i do here once
the race's over? Say it.

710
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:43,677
It's personal.

711
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:46,882
My son's getting out of control.

712
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:48,841
I locked him up yesterday
myself.

713
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:51,683
He doesn't listen to me.
He's getting spoiled.

714
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:52,517
If you...

715
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:56,417
i thought if you can
do something...

716
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:02,596
get him to serve the country
and the police like you.

717
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,232
Its not his cup of tea.

718
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:08,596
He's hot-blooded, doesn't
listen to anyone.

719
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:11,764
That's why i've come to you.

720
00:52:12,142 --> 00:52:16,442
All my life i never asked
anyone for anything.

721
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:18,142
Just this once.

722
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:21,616
If you can help me...

723
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:25,787
you've many legal business...

724
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:28,047
...which are not under the
scrutiny of the police.

725
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:30,684
Please appoint him.

726
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:33,126
He'll be reformed.

727
00:52:49,346 --> 00:52:50,574
Come on.

728
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,715
Brother sultan is here.

729
00:52:58,355 --> 00:52:59,720
Brother sultan is here.

730
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:03,924
Hello, brother sultan.

731
00:53:04,027 --> 00:53:05,358
Hello, brother sultan.

732
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:07,793
Your father never
accepted a bribe.

733
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:09,726
So this is a debt, work
hard and repay it.

734
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,358
And make your father proud.

735
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:14,126
I don't want to hear
another complain.

736
00:53:15,372 --> 00:53:16,396
I will try.

737
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,840
To at least keep you happy.

738
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,510
Thank you for helping shoaib.

739
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:26,515
We're in love.

740
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:30,846
Thank you.

741
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,834
You've made contacts with the
right kind of people, shoaib.

742
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:49,866
You'll certainly reach
your destination now.

743
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:55,571
So, khan.

744
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:00,110
In the last 18 years you
never bowed down.

745
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:03,013
But now you've changed
your master.

746
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:13,788
Shoaib, take a picture
of us together...

747
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:15,092
...and hang it in your shop.

748
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:20,263
Pick one of us whenever needed.

749
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:40,390
What are you doing here?

750
00:54:40,757 --> 00:54:41,849
Did you run away from the shop?

751
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:44,519
I didn't run away.

752
00:54:46,663 --> 00:54:48,130
I made my first sale.

753
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:54,598
I also brought a gift for
you. - Then give it.

754
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:55,962
Here, in public?

755
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,767
Come on, to the corner.

756
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:02,773
Come on.

757
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:15,290
Don't you know which shops
sell gifts for women?

758
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:16,392
Why? What's wrong with this?

759
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:24,127
I also have snacks.

760
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:26,829
Couldn't you bring
cakes or pastries?

761
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:28,833
That's for birthdays.

762
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:31,235
I made my first sale,
it's not my birthday.

763
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,637
One mumtaz gets the taj mahal...

764
00:55:35,045 --> 00:55:36,171
...and the other gets this.

765
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:38,008
You don't value my love.

766
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:40,612
Do you know how happy my friends
are to see this bottle?

767
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:42,948
Then go to them and celebrate
with them.

768
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,317
Why are you being so considerate
about me?

769
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:58,633
I never celebrated with
a girl before.

770
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,333
You drenched the cheeks
i wanted to kiss.

771
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,674
Come on, hit me. Hit me.

772
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:13,340
Don't cry, hit me.

773
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:15,617
Hit me. Hit me.

774
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:22,751
Hit me on the other cheek.

775
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,357
You hit so softly.

776
00:56:32,335 --> 00:56:34,394
Hit me harder.

777
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:37,967
You're always looking for an
opportunity, aren't you?

778
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:45,038
A real man... never let's
go of an opportunity.

779
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:29,351
Let me take away your sorrows.

780
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:35,293
Let me hold your hand
and take you away.

781
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:41,065
It's the season of
falling in love.

782
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,702
With you love's beautiful.

783
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:46,765
With you there's intoxication.

784
00:57:47,177 --> 00:57:49,873
With you i feel at peace.

785
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:59,480
With you i feel restless.

786
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:06,726
You're my fate, my destiny.

787
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:21,472
You're my fate, my destiny.

788
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:26,640
Why shouldn't i
lose my senses?

789
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:32,420
You're cuddled in my arms.

790
00:58:33,423 --> 00:58:38,122
You're like a river.

791
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:43,899
Seeking for the ocean
that dwells in me.

792
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:49,730
Let me take away your sorrows.

793
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:55,375
Let me hold your hand
and take you away.

794
00:58:55,846 --> 00:59:01,079
It's the season of
falling in love.

795
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:04,146
With you love's beautiful.

796
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:06,845
With you there's intoxication.

797
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,852
With you i feel at peace.

798
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:12,560
With you i feel restless.

799
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:39,785
When i come see you
in the evening.

800
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:45,050
The morning gets upset with me.

801
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:51,025
Every moment, every hour,
every instant...

802
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:56,668
...your memories torment me.

803
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,737
Let me take away your sorrows.

804
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:08,449
Let me hold your hand
and take you away.

805
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:13,984
It's the season of
falling in love.

806
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:16,824
With you love's beautiful.

807
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:19,718
With you there's intoxication.

808
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:22,757
With you i feel at peace.

809
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:25,261
With you i feel restless.

810
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:28,166
With you love's beautiful.

811
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:31,267
With you there's intoxication.

812
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:34,372
With you i feel at peace.

813
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:37,277
With you i feel restless.

814
01:01:05,976 --> 01:01:08,069
Dongri is like a volcano.

815
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:09,911
Always fuming.

816
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:13,106
It won't be right for
you to go there.

817
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:16,050
I didn't travel to mumbai
from delhi to hear that...

818
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:18,913
...i can't roam freely
in my own area.

819
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:20,348
I'm sorry to say, sir...

820
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:23,857
...but this situation would've
never arisen...

821
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:25,555
...if you politicians had thought
about this earlier.

822
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:27,391
Those people haven't prospered...

823
01:01:27,464 --> 01:01:29,364
...or developed since
independence.

824
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:35,570
They're only reclining, due
to the poverty, helpless.

825
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:38,936
Their anger has turned
into a fierce storm.

826
01:01:39,576 --> 01:01:41,203
What are the police for?

827
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:43,837
There're not enough policemen
to cover each lane.

828
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:48,974
If anyone hurls a
slipper at you...

829
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:53,720
we cannot guarantee your safety.

830
01:01:55,425 --> 01:02:00,055
If the police can't guarantee
my safety then who will.

831
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,824
Sir, there's one man.

832
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:07,163
Who is he? - Sultan mirza.

833
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:20,443
Look, the minister's here.

834
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:21,578
Move.

835
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:31,025
Clear them.

836
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:33,127
Move, move.

837
01:02:35,231 --> 01:02:36,129
Move, please.

838
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:58,784
Look, if you have
any complaints...

839
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:01,549
...then tell me about it.

840
01:03:04,394 --> 01:03:06,658
I've come here for you.

841
01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:18,070
No one's saying anything.

842
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,104
Everyone's just staring.

843
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:30,943
All hail... - sultan mirza.

844
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,114
All hail... - sultan mirza.

845
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:37,354
All hail... - sultan mirza.

846
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:42,524
All hail... - sultan mirza.

847
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:50,665
All hail... - sultan mirza.

848
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,819
All hail... - sultan mirza.

849
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:13,428
The government has come to you.

850
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:15,591
Listen to what it has to say.

851
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:19,867
Speak, sir, everyone's
listening.

852
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:24,231
Join politics, you'll
win for sure.

853
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:29,143
If my cabinet gets elected...

854
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,307
...then you'll have no
where left to go.

855
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:41,823
Smugglers live the real life.

856
01:04:42,992 --> 01:04:44,550
The entire world's
at your feet...

857
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,663
...and you can walk over it.

858
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:56,027
That's true.

859
01:04:57,173 --> 01:05:00,370
But not everyone has the
guts to be a smuggler.

860
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:03,635
A new employee always
praises his bosses.

861
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,572
Just because a sultan
gave you work...

862
01:05:05,648 --> 01:05:07,741
...you think whatever
he does is right.

863
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:10,081
Even the government couldn't
give me what sultan did.

864
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,178
Means of living.

865
01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:15,090
So tell me, who's greater?

866
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:17,053
The government or sultan.

867
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:23,397
The man you're praising
is a sinner.

868
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:25,997
We cannot judge what's
wrong and what's not.

869
01:05:27,937 --> 01:05:29,564
If he steals from one he
distributes it in others.

870
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:32,167
If he's a killer, he's also
a benefactor to others.

871
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,135
I don't want to be his
master or his slave.

872
01:05:37,213 --> 01:05:38,339
All i say is that...

873
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:40,575
...there's a reason behind
his every action.

874
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:43,616
There's a reason, money.

875
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:44,675
Of course.

876
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:48,690
And he's in a hurry to
earn money as well.

877
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:51,087
It's not about money.

878
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:55,963
The power involved is unlike
anything ever experienced.

879
01:05:57,033 --> 01:05:59,160
Concentrate on your
shop, shoaib.

880
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:01,967
If it was me...

881
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:07,134
...i would've restrained any
further relations with them

882
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,769
i don't want be friends either.

883
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:13,080
I just want to make it big.

884
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:21,153
After that the world
will be at my feet...

885
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:23,750
...and i'll walk over it.

886
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:34,635
They're no match for my
jewellery which was stolen.

887
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:36,603
And what're you smiling at?

888
01:06:36,873 --> 01:06:38,363
Will you show us some
more jewellery?

889
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:40,935
If you really cared
for my jewellery...

890
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:42,467
...you would've been in
the police station.

891
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:43,978
I've called them umpteen
times. - Madam.

892
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,547
Madam, can i show
you a necklace?

893
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:46,979
Look.

894
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:48,279
First take this one off.

895
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:49,415
The one you're wearing.
- No, ma'am.

896
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:50,944
It's not for sale.

897
01:06:51,621 --> 01:06:52,918
Rascal, thief.

898
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:55,389
Take it off. - What?

899
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,616
Take it off! - What
are you saying?

900
01:06:57,694 --> 01:06:58,854
Look, raman, this
is my necklace.

901
01:06:59,162 --> 01:07:01,130
It bears my symbol.

902
01:07:01,264 --> 01:07:02,231
Take it off. - You thief, wretch.

903
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:03,959
Madam, you're crossing
your limits.

904
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,466
I'm not retaliating and you're
calling me a thief.

905
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:07,969
Fine, you might've
not stolen it.

906
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:10,938
But you must have bought
it from a thief.

907
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:12,799
What's wrong, madam? - She's
wearing my necklace.

908
01:07:13,142 --> 01:07:14,268
It was stolen from my home.

909
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:15,368
Ask her where she got it from?

910
01:07:15,478 --> 01:07:16,638
Sir, i'm not a thief.

911
01:07:16,713 --> 01:07:18,146
Shoaib gave me this necklace.

912
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:20,172
Shoaib? Where can
we find shoaib?

913
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:29,815
That's him.

914
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,491
Look, he's the one.

915
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:33,562
Didn't i tell you?

916
01:07:33,629 --> 01:07:34,823
Thief. - Yes.

917
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:35,920
He gave you a stolen
necklace. - Yes.

918
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:36,987
He's the one that broke
into our house. - Yes.

919
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:38,395
He tied us up and stole
everything. - Yes.

920
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:39,492
Mumtaz.

921
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:41,463
What yes?

922
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:42,469
Take a look inside whether
our stuff's inside...

923
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:44,437
...or has he sold it?

924
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,633
He can't sell our stuff,
he absolutely can't.

925
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:48,336
Hey. Where is our stuff?

926
01:07:48,544 --> 01:07:50,478
Our radio, our television.

927
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:52,571
See, everyone, this man
broke into our home...

928
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:54,479
...tied us up and stole
everything.

929
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:57,342
Shikha, there are two
of my watches.

930
01:07:58,454 --> 01:07:59,512
Are you listening?

931
01:07:59,622 --> 01:08:01,021
Are you listening?

932
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:03,021
Shoaib. - Raman.

933
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:04,353
Shoaib. - Raman.

934
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:05,086
What are you doing? Do
you want to kill him?

935
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:06,025
Leave him.

936
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:07,720
Don't hit him. Raman.

937
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:09,429
Shoaib.

938
01:08:09,532 --> 01:08:11,227
Call the police quickly.

939
01:08:12,468 --> 01:08:14,402
Or he'll kill him.

940
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:16,036
Raman, call the police.

941
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:18,436
Someone please call the police.

942
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:20,008
What are you all staring at?
Someone call the police.

943
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:21,100
Also call the doctor.

944
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:28,782
Sultan sir.

945
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:37,859
How did you bet on a loser?

946
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:40,690
He ruined everything.

947
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:43,689
What else can you expect if you
put a man in wrong profession?

948
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:45,097
Forget about being grateful
to brother...

949
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:47,634
what attitude.

950
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,597
He did a favour to my
father and not me.

951
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,798
Give me a chance to
work with you.

952
01:08:54,877 --> 01:08:57,004
You'll profit double the
amount that you lost.

953
01:08:59,382 --> 01:09:02,283
You think this business
is a child's play...

954
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:04,716
...where anyone can
do as they please.

955
01:09:05,154 --> 01:09:07,054
There's nothing that can't
be conquered with courage.

956
01:09:22,305 --> 01:09:23,863
Courage is not something
to be spoken about...

957
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,699
...it's best displayed.

958
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:10,576
Stop them, sultan.

959
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:11,677
Or else they'll kill him.

960
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:24,628
No pain... no gain.

961
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:28,688
You said... that i should
choose one master.

962
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:31,598
So i did.

963
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:38,033
Now... do you have the ability
to choose the right man?

964
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:41,400
What did you say?

965
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:46,611
Nothing.

966
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:53,082
From now you'll say only
what i want to hear.

967
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:57,650
Chandru. - Yes.

968
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,652
Teach him the trade.

969
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:02,925
Get up.

970
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:04,564
Come on.

971
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:09,335
Sultan, i think he isn't
the right choice.

972
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:13,303
We don't have jobs for
the right ones.

973
01:12:15,978 --> 01:12:17,536
He'll surely do something big.

974
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:18,973
Why?

975
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:26,483
Because... he values his victory.

976
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:34,324
Sir... i made a big mistake.

977
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:39,727
Shoaib has joined sultan
in his illegal business.

978
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:43,161
I don't know what to do, sir.

979
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:48,902
No matter how dark the
night is, khan...

980
01:12:50,112 --> 01:12:51,773
...the dawn always brings light.

981
01:12:56,452 --> 01:12:59,853
Shoaib is blinded by the glitter
of sultan's world.

982
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,584
The day he takes off
the blindfold...

983
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:05,789
...he'll come back to reality.

984
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:09,091
And one of us is there.

985
01:13:10,266 --> 01:13:11,597
We won't let anything
happen to him.

986
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:14,626
Don't worry.

987
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:17,632
I'll handle everything.

988
01:13:23,345 --> 01:13:26,178
Some people take
up a fast pace...

989
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:29,247
...to leave their past behind.

990
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:33,019
Shoaib was one of them.

991
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:35,748
His name appeared in every
complaint, every file...

992
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:39,121
...and every report.

993
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:43,527
Then i felt that after
all he's khan's son.

994
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:46,101
So shoaib can be used
to take down...

995
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:50,002
...sultan, wardhan, pathan,
vishnu and varghese.

996
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,972
But that was the biggest
mistake of my life.

997
01:13:57,913 --> 01:14:01,781
I tried to play with fire.

998
01:14:04,553 --> 01:14:06,145
And the fire broke out.

999
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:12,907
That's a steel lock and not a
cloth that you can... - wait.

1000
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,344
I doubt it.

1001
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:18,209
No one can open this lock in
a minute without the key.

1002
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:19,652
Stop your nonsense.

1003
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:21,684
And pass me that
wire. - This one?

1004
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:22,884
Give me that wire.

1005
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,431
Shoaib, what's that?

1006
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:30,855
What is that?

1007
01:14:31,101 --> 01:14:32,466
That belongs to the police...

1008
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:33,661
...where did you steal it from?

1009
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:35,136
I suggest that you
throw it away.

1010
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:37,139
We don't require it,
throw it away.

1011
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:38,630
This is a gun.

1012
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,278
It makes everyone bow.

1013
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:49,748
Whoever controls it... controls
power.

1014
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:57,524
Either the game changes
or the player.

1015
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:02,494
Shoaib.

1016
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:03,861
What are you doing?

1017
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,191
Leave him. - Move it.

1018
01:15:05,302 --> 01:15:06,530
Javed, explain him.

1019
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:09,268
I just need to move my finger...

1020
01:15:11,408 --> 01:15:12,568
...and that'll be the end of you.

1021
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:15,669
Leave it, shoaib.

1022
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:16,709
Let him go.

1023
01:15:22,853 --> 01:15:25,253
When we'll together stand
for sultan mirza...

1024
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,125
...it'll double his power.

1025
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:34,923
Double.

1026
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:55,043
A person normally gets romantic
after drinking.

1027
01:15:55,485 --> 01:15:57,180
Talks about the moons
and the stars.

1028
01:15:57,254 --> 01:15:59,347
But you slip into flashback.

1029
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:03,053
When you run from your past...

1030
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:05,885
...you can never win in life.

1031
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,357
I've been sharing a drink with
you for the past two years.

1032
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:12,397
You drink everyday
and become poetic.

1033
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:14,766
A person should change
with time.

1034
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:18,304
Time never changes... it
only passes away.

1035
01:16:19,109 --> 01:16:21,100
What would you've changed?

1036
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:24,875
Everything except for you.

1037
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:27,550
Excuse me, ma'am.

1038
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:30,677
Autograph please.

1039
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:34,246
Thank you.

1040
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:36,121
I'll always keep it
close to my heart.

1041
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,193
So i don't mistakenly spend it.

1042
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,421
Thank you so much.

1043
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:44,727
That's how india is divided
in two parts.

1044
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:47,432
The rich tore a 1000
rupees note...

1045
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,004
...which didn't make a
difference to him.

1046
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:52,337
And the poor have never seen
a 1000 rupees note yet.

1047
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:54,136
I've an idea.

1048
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:56,175
Someone should make
a film on you.

1049
01:16:56,947 --> 01:16:58,414
It'll be a success before
it's released.

1050
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:01,445
So will you make me act now?

1051
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,342
I can make someone else act.

1052
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:04,981
That new boy, amit.

1053
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:06,344
The new superstar.

1054
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:07,981
He'll suit perfectly.

1055
01:17:08,258 --> 01:17:09,520
His eyes are similar to yours.

1056
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:11,458
Very expressive.

1057
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:13,222
Shall we order food?

1058
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:15,386
Yes.

1059
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,696
How is the food? - Hot. Like you.

1060
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:24,236
I mean how does it taste?

1061
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:26,400
Tangy and spicy like you.

1062
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:28,469
You're just...

1063
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:29,840
i never understand whether
you're speaking the truth...

1064
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:32,272
...or fooling me.

1065
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,347
That's one habit about girls.

1066
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:38,310
When we speak the truth they
say we're fooling them.

1067
01:17:40,457 --> 01:17:43,585
And when we fool them
they believe it.

1068
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:51,192
Can i ask you something?

1069
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:54,092
Will you be honest? - Yes.

1070
01:17:55,605 --> 01:17:57,766
I hope that necklace incident
is not repeated again?

1071
01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:08,810
Don't ever... talk about
that necklace...

1072
01:18:09,853 --> 01:18:11,582
...or my failure again.

1073
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,387
I just want to succeed.

1074
01:18:15,959 --> 01:18:17,654
Move ahead.

1075
01:18:18,094 --> 01:18:19,994
I've forsaken those petty ways...

1076
01:18:20,497 --> 01:18:21,725
...which held me back.

1077
01:18:28,605 --> 01:18:29,697
At least finish the food.

1078
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:35,771
I bought a new house...

1079
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:38,307
...so you don't have to
live in that crowd.

1080
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:42,547
Look at me.

1081
01:18:42,953 --> 01:18:45,012
This... is a nylon silk shirt.

1082
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:46,947
Do you know how expensive it is?

1083
01:18:48,525 --> 01:18:50,117
There's a two-in-one, phone.

1084
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,091
How many have them?

1085
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:52,890
What is all this?

1086
01:18:52,963 --> 01:18:54,123
Progress.

1087
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:56,490
I work for sultan mirza.

1088
01:18:56,967 --> 01:18:58,764
Do you know what that
means? - Yes, i do.

1089
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:01,297
And i know how dangerous
the job is.

1090
01:19:10,347 --> 01:19:11,109
Yes.

1091
01:19:13,984 --> 01:19:15,246
Yes, i'm on my way.

1092
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:20,047
Sultan, rag picker manya
at teen batti...

1093
01:19:20,557 --> 01:19:21,751
...has sent a message.

1094
01:19:22,492 --> 01:19:24,187
Agnel knows about our plan.

1095
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,561
Manya is two-faced.

1096
01:19:27,197 --> 01:19:28,789
He must have given this
information to agnel.

1097
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:31,295
Now that agnel knows...

1098
01:19:31,568 --> 01:19:33,331
...he must have blocked
all roads.

1099
01:19:34,371 --> 01:19:36,100
He won't let our vehicles
through.

1100
01:19:36,206 --> 01:19:37,036
What should we do?

1101
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,607
Return wardhan's money?

1102
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:40,603
Our respect will ruined, sultan.

1103
01:19:41,111 --> 01:19:42,339
Those who bow before us...

1104
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:44,608
...will steer clear
of us in future.

1105
01:19:44,714 --> 01:19:46,443
What should we do?

1106
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:49,017
It's easy to say such things,
but not to do this job.

1107
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:49,780
There's nothing to worry.

1108
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:51,915
We'll break through
the barricades.

1109
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,683
Hey, have you lost it.

1110
01:19:55,225 --> 01:19:56,624
Let me plan something.

1111
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:15,874
Let me first take care of
the job you've promised.

1112
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,211
Then i'll get rid of
our loop holes.

1113
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:25,649
And i can execute both the jobs.

1114
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,233
All the influential people of
mumbai are present here.

1115
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:40,765
Builders, cricketers,
actors and actresses.

1116
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,068
The mayor's present as
well. Having a drink.

1117
01:20:44,374 --> 01:20:45,739
Shoaib, let's go back.

1118
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:48,604
I feel strange amongst
these people.

1119
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:50,202
Sultan has called me.

1120
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,975
He invited me especially.
It's his party.

1121
01:20:52,282 --> 01:20:53,840
He said there won't be
any party without you.

1122
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,381
Come on, come quietly.

1123
01:20:57,687 --> 01:20:58,654
Meet my wife. - Hello.

1124
01:20:58,755 --> 01:20:59,551
Thank you.

1125
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:04,887
Celebrating before
the job's done.

1126
01:21:06,129 --> 01:21:08,495
I'm slightly crazy
since childhood.

1127
01:21:09,132 --> 01:21:11,293
I know how to fix you if you
don't get the job done.

1128
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:15,670
Brother, normally in
birthday parties...

1129
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:18,330
...children don't leave
without a return gift.

1130
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:20,472
Today these people won't either.

1131
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:30,683
So, what's going on? - Nothing.

1132
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,381
We were just chatting.

1133
01:21:32,789 --> 01:21:34,154
You'll get bored standing here.

1134
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:35,384
Let's go have a drink.

1135
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,948
Do you want to get us fired?

1136
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:40,393
Don't worry, we'll drink what
they're drinking inside.

1137
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:41,293
Come on then. - Fine.

1138
01:22:01,718 --> 01:22:03,151
Get hold of a posh tailor.

1139
01:22:04,854 --> 01:22:06,321
I want you to stitch clothes
like sister-in-law, rihana.

1140
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:09,685
You've an awesome figure.

1141
01:22:09,826 --> 01:22:11,088
It should show.

1142
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:12,755
What are you saying?

1143
01:22:12,862 --> 01:22:14,955
Are you too drunk?

1144
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:16,096
You're uttering nonsense again.

1145
01:22:18,768 --> 01:22:22,295
I'm not the caterer to drink
after everyone leaves.

1146
01:22:34,384 --> 01:22:35,351
Shoaib.

1147
01:22:38,188 --> 01:22:39,519
I needed your help.

1148
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,857
But i don't know how to say it.

1149
01:22:44,494 --> 01:22:45,392
Say it.

1150
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,331
I need your photographer.

1151
01:22:53,002 --> 01:22:54,993
Photographer? For what?

1152
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:59,206
Actually my photos are
being published...

1153
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:01,368
...in the newspapers
these days as well.

1154
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,172
But it's horrible.

1155
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:05,609
I was thinking of getting
a nice photo clicked...

1156
01:23:05,682 --> 01:23:06,876
...and have it sent to them.

1157
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,649
No matter what i do...

1158
01:23:08,751 --> 01:23:10,184
...but the picture
should look nice.

1159
01:23:10,954 --> 01:23:12,649
You want to be like
sultan, don't you?

1160
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:16,889
A bit, i like his style.

1161
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:22,687
Our party is better than the
one inside, isn't it?

1162
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,130
Drink away, the night is young.

1163
01:23:57,267 --> 01:23:58,427
Shoaib is doing good work.

1164
01:23:59,302 --> 01:24:00,360
Get married.

1165
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:01,933
It's difficult.

1166
01:24:04,173 --> 01:24:06,471
These days he tries
to imitate you.

1167
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:08,810
You didn't get married... so he
won't attempt it either.

1168
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:12,872
But before that... maybe... - she
never talks any sense.

1169
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:15,248
Don't even try to make sense.

1170
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:18,217
Is the job done? - Its
partly taken care of.

1171
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:21,322
It'll be done once
the party is over.

1172
01:24:22,525 --> 01:24:23,685
So the party's over. - Suddenly?

1173
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:27,422
I invited them.

1174
01:24:28,865 --> 01:24:30,457
So they'll leave on my order.

1175
01:24:35,038 --> 01:24:36,198
That's the mayor's car.

1176
01:24:36,272 --> 01:24:38,832
Who can stop him?

1177
01:24:38,975 --> 01:24:40,374
We'll check sultan and
his cars. - Fine.

1178
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:41,769
Open the gate. - Open it.

1179
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,842
Open it quickly.

1180
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:12,797
It's the mayor's car.

1181
01:25:14,077 --> 01:25:15,704
I want to check the car
and not the mayor.

1182
01:25:16,346 --> 01:25:17,108
Open the boot.

1183
01:25:17,347 --> 01:25:18,712
What is this insolence?

1184
01:25:21,918 --> 01:25:24,284
Being the mayor, you're
returning from smuggler's party.

1185
01:25:25,054 --> 01:25:26,112
And calling me insolent.

1186
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,352
Let me do my duty.

1187
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:30,357
Open the boot.

1188
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:33,551
Check it.

1189
01:25:36,199 --> 01:25:37,632
Open the bonnet.

1190
01:25:44,741 --> 01:25:45,673
What's wrong, officer?

1191
01:25:45,742 --> 01:25:47,232
It's a checking. Open the boot.

1192
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:49,700
Hurry up.

1193
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:56,276
Firstly the monsoon and
now this checking.

1194
01:25:56,953 --> 01:25:58,545
Sakharam, open the boot quickly.

1195
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:03,689
That car as well.

1196
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:05,225
Leave.

1197
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:16,100
Check properly. There's still
much left to load.

1198
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:17,935
That was fun. - Hurry up.

1199
01:26:19,776 --> 01:26:23,075
Shoaib, you were terrific as
a police officer today.

1200
01:26:24,714 --> 01:26:26,579
For the first time father's
uniform has come in handy.

1201
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:34,022
Careful. It contains watches
and transistors.

1202
01:26:34,123 --> 01:26:36,148
Why are you being so hasty?

1203
01:26:36,459 --> 01:26:37,517
I'll slap you...

1204
01:26:37,593 --> 01:26:38,355
is anything broken?

1205
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:47,364
No, shoaib, it doesn't contain
anything that can be broken.

1206
01:26:48,971 --> 01:26:51,769
And sultan is not going
to like this.

1207
01:27:02,919 --> 01:27:03,783
Hello.

1208
01:27:08,825 --> 01:27:10,986
There's no match to the
cheetah's speed...

1209
01:27:11,027 --> 01:27:13,723
...the grip of a python and
the cunningness of sultan.

1210
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:22,834
This boy has done this job.

1211
01:27:27,176 --> 01:27:31,943
I wouldn't have ever brought
the goods here.

1212
01:27:32,515 --> 01:27:36,007
Sultan, i can never believe...

1213
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:39,420
...you don't fail to do a
job that you undertake.

1214
01:27:40,056 --> 01:27:41,853
Will you believe that
today's my birthday?

1215
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:45,289
Come, lets cut the cake.

1216
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:47,488
Sultan, you should've
informed me earlier.

1217
01:27:47,964 --> 01:27:49,795
I would've got a nice
gift for you.

1218
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:51,262
Tell me, what do you want?

1219
01:27:51,534 --> 01:27:52,933
Tell me.

1220
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:57,635
Do you have a match?
- Matches. Here.

1221
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,773
Sultan, what have you done?

1222
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:08,545
Have you gone crazy?

1223
01:28:09,919 --> 01:28:11,546
Do you want more profit?

1224
01:28:12,555 --> 01:28:15,046
Do you want a larger share?
Then i will do so.

1225
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:19,827
But... - wardhan. I only
smuggle things...

1226
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,457
...which the government
doesn't permit.

1227
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,797
And not things which my
conscience doesn't permit me.

1228
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,510
Shoaib didn't stop
after that job.

1229
01:28:42,852 --> 01:28:47,448
His new ideas, thinking, helped
him progress in the business.

1230
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:51,149
He started smuggling
goods in ambulances.

1231
01:28:55,097 --> 01:28:57,327
People were terrified by him.

1232
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:04,362
But i had turned a blind eye...

1233
01:29:04,473 --> 01:29:06,338
...because shoaib was getting
closer to sultan.

1234
01:29:12,782 --> 01:29:16,980
Shoaib was... searching for a man.

1235
01:29:19,055 --> 01:29:23,822
My informer... who was
deceiving them.

1236
01:29:53,489 --> 01:29:59,951
In this world... people
are... often... duped.

1237
01:30:00,696 --> 01:30:07,226
Just a gaze... steals
their heart.

1238
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:14,036
In this world... people
are... often... duped.

1239
01:30:15,344 --> 01:30:21,840
Just a gaze... steals
their heart.

1240
01:30:22,118 --> 01:30:25,383
Two young hearts.

1241
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:28,588
The eyes speak.

1242
01:30:29,225 --> 01:30:36,393
Let no one come between them.

1243
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:40,158
These mysteries.

1244
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:43,602
Why be so mysterious?

1245
01:30:44,407 --> 01:30:48,104
These mysteries.

1246
01:30:48,177 --> 01:30:50,771
Why be so mysterious?

1247
01:30:51,681 --> 01:30:56,983
Monica, oh my darling.

1248
01:30:58,654 --> 01:31:01,521
Monica...

1249
01:31:02,058 --> 01:31:05,289
oh my darling.

1250
01:31:39,028 --> 01:31:45,900
My lovers deceitful and
passionate as well.

1251
01:31:46,235 --> 01:31:51,730
Why wonder what he wants when
i am in love with him.

1252
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:09,322
Where should i seek love?

1253
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:12,859
The entire world's my enemy.

1254
01:32:13,162 --> 01:32:16,620
The one you trust.

1255
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:19,964
Walk up to him and say...

1256
01:32:20,903 --> 01:32:22,837
these mysteries.

1257
01:32:22,905 --> 01:32:23,963
Why be so mysterious?

1258
01:32:24,073 --> 01:32:26,940
I broke his leg. But he fled.

1259
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:28,803
You know what to do...

1260
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:33,612
...when the horse starts to limp.

1261
01:32:37,253 --> 01:32:38,220
Sultan has sent a message.

1262
01:32:41,157 --> 01:32:42,124
Bet on the limping horse today.

1263
01:32:43,793 --> 01:32:44,782
Tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock.

1264
01:32:45,861 --> 01:32:47,726
The ship's name is al marina.

1265
01:32:50,366 --> 01:32:51,264
He's here.

1266
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:54,196
Look, he's here.

1267
01:33:22,798 --> 01:33:26,359
There's restlessness growing
every moment.

1268
01:33:26,402 --> 01:33:29,929
Youth is anxious.

1269
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:33,531
I am restless, you're
restless.

1270
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:37,568
That's the saga of this
ruthless heart.

1271
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:41,241
There's restlessness growing
every moment.

1272
01:33:41,317 --> 01:33:44,411
Youth is anxious.

1273
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:48,215
I am restless, you're
restless.

1274
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:51,555
That's the saga of this
ruthless heart.

1275
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,892
The heart's smouldering.

1276
01:33:54,964 --> 01:33:58,058
My heart's your abode.

1277
01:33:58,567 --> 01:34:02,128
Come dwell in my heart.

1278
01:34:02,371 --> 01:34:05,306
Where else can you go?

1279
01:34:06,408 --> 01:34:09,536
These mysteries.

1280
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:12,614
Why be so mysterious?

1281
01:34:13,682 --> 01:34:16,879
These mysteries.

1282
01:34:17,553 --> 01:34:20,113
Why be so mysterious?

1283
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:27,159
Monica, oh my darling.

1284
01:34:40,576 --> 01:34:41,372
Rihana.

1285
01:34:45,581 --> 01:34:47,310
Sultan, what's happening to me?

1286
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:49,044
You'll be fine, hold on.

1287
01:34:49,718 --> 01:34:50,309
Patrick, hurry up.

1288
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,080
Don't let me die.

1289
01:34:53,589 --> 01:34:54,419
Patrick, hurry up.

1290
01:34:58,127 --> 01:34:59,594
Sir... - wait.

1291
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:05,432
There's a patient in the
car, we're in a hurry.

1292
01:35:05,467 --> 01:35:06,832
We need to go to the
hospital. Let us go.

1293
01:35:06,936 --> 01:35:07,595
Come out.

1294
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,961
Didn't you hear? Go away.

1295
01:35:10,339 --> 01:35:11,636
I think you didn't hear.

1296
01:35:12,074 --> 01:35:14,634
Rascals, you smuggle gold
in an ambulance...

1297
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:15,608
...and patients in the car.

1298
01:35:15,844 --> 01:35:17,869
Do you think the police
are fools? Come out.

1299
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,414
Driver, open the luggage
boot and let me check.

1300
01:35:20,482 --> 01:35:21,346
Hey, officer...

1301
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:25,252
you want to check the
car, don't you?

1302
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,712
I'll show you each and every
corner of the car.

1303
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:29,815
Leave me. Leave me. - Look.

1304
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:30,391
Look.

1305
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:32,622
Take a look.

1306
01:35:35,664 --> 01:35:36,426
Did you find anything?

1307
01:35:36,532 --> 01:35:37,123
Is there any gold?

1308
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:39,028
Let's check the luggage
boot now.

1309
01:35:40,703 --> 01:35:42,261
I'll show you the entire
car, come on.

1310
01:35:42,771 --> 01:35:43,465
Take a look.

1311
01:35:43,772 --> 01:35:44,704
Is there anything.

1312
01:35:45,808 --> 01:35:46,638
Look.

1313
01:35:47,443 --> 01:35:48,068
Sultan.

1314
01:36:00,656 --> 01:36:02,817
She's suffering from congenital
heart disease.

1315
01:36:04,727 --> 01:36:05,352
Meaning? I didn't understand.

1316
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:07,526
I mean there's a hole
in her heart.

1317
01:36:08,998 --> 01:36:11,523
Often infants contract this
disease in the womb.

1318
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:13,666
It is detected at
childhood itself.

1319
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:15,561
So now?

1320
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:19,070
There's no cure to this disease.

1321
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:21,373
A few more years.

1322
01:36:23,412 --> 01:36:24,743
I'm sorry, i'm really
very sorry.

1323
01:36:25,547 --> 01:36:27,447
Look after her as
much as you can.

1324
01:36:28,517 --> 01:36:29,745
You come with me

1325
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,409
will you marry me?

1326
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:32,480
You're the heart of mumbai.

1327
01:37:34,216 --> 01:37:35,615
And mumbai is very dear to me.

1328
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:39,183
I've learnt much from you.

1329
01:37:42,091 --> 01:37:44,616
I always marched forward like
your waves, untainted.

1330
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:50,055
I never heeded or bowed
before anyone.

1331
01:37:53,635 --> 01:37:55,034
But the only mistake
i made was...

1332
01:37:56,572 --> 01:37:58,335
...that my love was divided.

1333
01:38:00,309 --> 01:38:04,439
Now you tell me who
i should listen to.

1334
01:38:08,951 --> 01:38:10,816
Are you thinking about
leaving this business?

1335
01:38:15,557 --> 01:38:20,051
I can leave everything mumbai
has given me for rihana.

1336
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:22,619
No worries.

1337
01:38:24,199 --> 01:38:25,598
The only thing i'm
worried about...

1338
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:29,562
...is that mumbai
has a big-heart.

1339
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,603
I'm scared that someone
might shatter it.

1340
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:39,737
Everyone's keeping quiet only
because of our business.

1341
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:42,050
If we leave the business...

1342
01:38:42,618 --> 01:38:43,642
...everyone will find
their voice.

1343
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,115
What i am today is not because
of my business...

1344
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:53,189
...but my decisions.

1345
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:57,530
This city has always heeded
my decisions till date...

1346
01:38:59,034 --> 01:39:00,296
...and it will do so
in future as well.

1347
01:39:00,903 --> 01:39:01,835
No, sultan.

1348
01:39:03,071 --> 01:39:04,436
If we leave our business...

1349
01:39:05,374 --> 01:39:10,107
...we'll give our enemies a
chance to stand against us.

1350
01:39:11,547 --> 01:39:14,914
After that as the fear is over,
so will be our lives.

1351
01:39:16,251 --> 01:39:17,309
And the law will be after us.

1352
01:39:17,886 --> 01:39:22,585
You need brains and not business
to keep them in control.

1353
01:39:25,928 --> 01:39:30,922
I'm only changing my way of
living and not my attitude.

1354
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:35,660
He's after me today.

1355
01:39:35,737 --> 01:39:36,396
He's...

1356
01:39:36,972 --> 01:39:37,939
brother.

1357
01:39:38,574 --> 01:39:40,235
Hello. Hello.

1358
01:39:41,743 --> 01:39:45,338
It wouldn't have swayed so
much when it was full.

1359
01:39:48,817 --> 01:39:50,284
So why now?

1360
01:39:51,086 --> 01:39:53,953
We were just playing. - So play.

1361
01:39:57,392 --> 01:40:01,055
I would've been ruined... if
not for you.

1362
01:40:01,897 --> 01:40:03,626
Till a horse is not beautified...

1363
01:40:05,767 --> 01:40:07,200
...he looks like a donkey.

1364
01:40:07,603 --> 01:40:11,596
As long as you're behind me
i'll never tire or stop.

1365
01:40:13,242 --> 01:40:16,109
Then use your mind.

1366
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:22,608
I'm going to delhi.

1367
01:40:24,086 --> 01:40:25,485
I'll be gone for a long time.

1368
01:40:27,122 --> 01:40:34,324
Until then... you will handle
the business here.

1369
01:40:37,332 --> 01:40:44,329
And remember, this isn't your
property or a donation.

1370
01:40:46,475 --> 01:40:49,342
I will try not to let
you down this time.

1371
01:40:58,487 --> 01:40:59,647
You won't get a chance either.

1372
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:30,543
Sultan has divided this
city into five parts.

1373
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:36,182
Just like druapadi. - You utter
nonsense after drinking.

1374
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:38,226
I'm not joking, javed.

1375
01:41:39,828 --> 01:41:41,591
Only two people are adequate
to run this city.

1376
01:41:42,464 --> 01:41:43,431
Sultan and me.

1377
01:41:45,367 --> 01:41:46,800
The rest are pushovers.

1378
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:49,562
What do you want to do?

1379
01:41:53,075 --> 01:41:57,068
I want to kiss it, hug
it and play with it.

1380
01:41:57,846 --> 01:42:00,007
Do everything that'll take me
to new heights of success.

1381
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:02,709
Higher than sultan.

1382
01:42:04,353 --> 01:42:05,820
I don't want to be
any lesser either.

1383
01:42:07,322 --> 01:42:09,051
People call him smuggler.

1384
01:42:10,192 --> 01:42:11,659
Sultan will call me don.

1385
01:42:13,028 --> 01:42:14,359
He'll give me a hug.

1386
01:42:20,035 --> 01:42:21,366
Try to see from my point
of view, javed.

1387
01:42:26,341 --> 01:42:29,174
It feels like we've trapped
someone's darling.

1388
01:42:30,879 --> 01:42:31,504
If we lose this opportunity...

1389
01:42:33,715 --> 01:42:35,114
...she'll slip out of our hands.

1390
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:41,280
I'll destroy her but not
let her slip away.

1391
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:49,697
How much longer?

1392
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:52,391
The minister's slightly busy.

1393
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:53,929
He will see you.

1394
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:55,693
But you will have to
wait for a while.

1395
01:43:01,143 --> 01:43:04,237
Shoaib, there's a job which
only you can do.

1396
01:43:05,013 --> 01:43:07,174
I want to bump off my brother.

1397
01:43:24,166 --> 01:43:25,656
After the job's done...

1398
01:43:27,302 --> 01:43:28,963
...my man will give you
this piece of catechu.

1399
01:43:29,438 --> 01:43:33,169
Match them and handover
the money.

1400
01:43:33,942 --> 01:43:34,909
Will the job be done?

1401
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,138
I won't deceive you.

1402
01:44:13,448 --> 01:44:14,608
This is just the first
success, javed.

1403
01:44:16,351 --> 01:44:18,012
Just watch how i turn
this 500,000...

1404
01:44:18,153 --> 01:44:19,780
...into five million before
sultan returns.

1405
01:44:20,889 --> 01:44:24,882
Sir, sultan sir comes
everyday to meet you.

1406
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,492
What should i say?

1407
01:44:26,795 --> 01:44:27,921
Who am i?

1408
01:44:28,897 --> 01:44:29,795
The home minister.

1409
01:44:31,366 --> 01:44:36,030
And him. A petty goon of mumbai.

1410
01:44:36,805 --> 01:44:39,365
Does he think i have the
time to spare for him?

1411
01:44:40,108 --> 01:44:41,006
Let him wait.

1412
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,875
There's no special trick
to sell alcohol...

1413
01:44:50,385 --> 01:44:51,647
...which only wardhan knows.

1414
01:44:55,357 --> 01:44:57,382
Its so easy even chandru
can do it.

1415
01:45:01,763 --> 01:45:03,094
Now we'll have our own brewery.

1416
01:45:04,299 --> 01:45:05,027
The profit will be ours.

1417
01:45:07,936 --> 01:45:08,561
Call kaalia.

1418
01:45:09,037 --> 01:45:10,971
Sultan will kill all of us.

1419
01:45:11,973 --> 01:45:14,134
You know how much he
detests kaalia.

1420
01:45:15,277 --> 01:45:17,302
He doesn't trust kaalia at all.

1421
01:45:17,946 --> 01:45:19,140
He trusts me.

1422
01:45:20,448 --> 01:45:21,972
That's why he handed
his post to me.

1423
01:45:24,252 --> 01:45:25,276
Just do as i said.

1424
01:45:26,054 --> 01:45:27,316
Don't try to rack your brains
if you don't have one.

1425
01:45:29,558 --> 01:45:33,392
I've heard entire mumabi
is scared of sultan mirza.

1426
01:45:34,563 --> 01:45:36,428
But he's sitting
here so timidly.

1427
01:45:37,766 --> 01:45:41,725
The truth is when he'll
show his true colour...

1428
01:45:42,504 --> 01:45:46,565
...the person sitting
inside... will run for cover.

1429
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:48,604
What are you saying? He's
a dangerous man.

1430
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,371
Don't be fooled, stay quiet.

1431
01:45:50,812 --> 01:45:55,078
It's easy to fire the gun. But
just as difficult to keep it safe.

1432
01:45:56,117 --> 01:45:58,745
None of us has ever used
it in our business.

1433
01:45:59,054 --> 01:46:00,248
Times are changing.

1434
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,255
If you want to do business
peacefully...

1435
01:46:03,325 --> 01:46:04,451
...then we'll have to
start using it.

1436
01:46:05,327 --> 01:46:08,319
Fine, wait until sultan returns.

1437
01:46:09,164 --> 01:46:11,155
If i wait i'll be left behind.

1438
01:46:12,367 --> 01:46:14,198
Wardhan and pathan will win.

1439
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:16,461
They aren't our enemies, shoaib.

1440
01:46:16,571 --> 01:46:18,334
There are no friends in
business, patrick.

1441
01:46:19,507 --> 01:46:21,839
What we want doesn't
make a difference?

1442
01:46:22,444 --> 01:46:24,002
What sultan wants is
more important.

1443
01:46:24,346 --> 01:46:28,077
But sultan isn't here at
the moment, it's me.

1444
01:46:47,135 --> 01:46:49,103
You snore just like you lecture.

1445
01:46:50,372 --> 01:46:51,896
Long and boring. - You?

1446
01:46:53,475 --> 01:46:54,305
How did you come here?

1447
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:58,868
Minister, i haven't become
so ordinary...

1448
01:46:59,981 --> 01:47:01,812
...that anyone can stop me
from going anywhere.

1449
01:47:02,217 --> 01:47:03,479
What is this insolence?

1450
01:47:05,687 --> 01:47:08,520
I mean... what do you want?

1451
01:47:11,126 --> 01:47:12,024
Ministerial post.

1452
01:47:13,461 --> 01:47:14,257
Name your price.

1453
01:47:16,364 --> 01:47:17,388
That's not possible.

1454
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,992
These days the government...

1455
01:47:20,068 --> 01:47:21,399
...is giving permission
to form new parties.

1456
01:47:23,638 --> 01:47:24,935
Since i grew sensible...

1457
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:30,609
...i did everything which the
government doesn't permit.

1458
01:47:32,614 --> 01:47:37,381
What will the government get
if you get the permission?

1459
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:40,015
Sultan mirza is all you need.

1460
01:47:41,723 --> 01:47:43,748
The opposition won't
stand a chance.

1461
01:47:47,462 --> 01:47:50,397
I want every bottle that's being
made in shoaib's brewery.

1462
01:47:51,066 --> 01:47:52,556
And throw all the alcohol
in the gutters.

1463
01:47:54,002 --> 01:47:56,630
No one should know that the
police is behind this.

1464
01:47:56,738 --> 01:47:57,534
Understand.

1465
01:47:57,939 --> 01:47:59,372
You want to erase all
evidence, sir.

1466
01:47:59,808 --> 01:48:01,469
That will only encourage,
shoaib.

1467
01:48:01,776 --> 01:48:03,038
Kaalia has given his statement.

1468
01:48:03,278 --> 01:48:04,939
12 people died after drinking
his alcohol.

1469
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:06,574
We can't we arrest shoaib?

1470
01:48:07,449 --> 01:48:08,177
What good will that do?

1471
01:48:09,284 --> 01:48:10,308
Didn't sultan kill dara?

1472
01:48:10,852 --> 01:48:11,682
What happened?

1473
01:48:12,087 --> 01:48:13,384
He was bailed out in 10 minutes.

1474
01:48:14,022 --> 01:48:14,886
He will get bail as well.

1475
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:17,653
We're merely their publicity
agents now.

1476
01:48:18,293 --> 01:48:20,386
We arrest them and
they get bail.

1477
01:48:20,462 --> 01:48:23,522
You mean we should try
to cover their acts.

1478
01:48:24,332 --> 01:48:25,959
I'll shatter their unity
in such a way...

1479
01:48:26,034 --> 01:48:27,228
...that they'll never think about
coming together again.

1480
01:48:27,969 --> 01:48:29,596
Their strength lies
in their unity.

1481
01:48:30,305 --> 01:48:31,567
Once that's broken...

1482
01:48:32,006 --> 01:48:33,473
...everyone will be in our fist.

1483
01:48:34,642 --> 01:48:35,870
But who will shatter
their unity?

1484
01:48:36,311 --> 01:48:38,802
The same shoaib whose acts
we're covering up.

1485
01:48:39,147 --> 01:48:40,512
But he's close to sultan.

1486
01:48:41,249 --> 01:48:42,409
He isn't close to anyone.

1487
01:48:43,318 --> 01:48:44,808
But why will he go
against sultan.

1488
01:48:45,587 --> 01:48:47,885
He has already gone
against sultan.

1489
01:48:48,957 --> 01:48:50,049
I didn't understand.

1490
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:53,486
Sultan might be involved
in wrong deeds...

1491
01:48:53,595 --> 01:48:55,119
...but he never polluted
the city.

1492
01:48:56,598 --> 01:48:57,724
He ruled the seas...

1493
01:48:57,799 --> 01:48:59,630
...that's why people are still
safe on the streets.

1494
01:49:01,503 --> 01:49:05,564
But shoaib chucked all his
principles in the sea.

1495
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:10,135
So when two people with
different morality confront...

1496
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:12,304
...there's bound to be collision.

1497
01:49:12,881 --> 01:49:15,008
But the one that's moving slower
and has older values...

1498
01:49:15,116 --> 01:49:16,310
...will suffer more loss.

1499
01:49:17,619 --> 01:49:18,950
I don't care about those two.

1500
01:49:19,921 --> 01:49:21,218
I just want the city unpolluted.

1501
01:49:22,924 --> 01:49:26,155
But shoaib is... khan's son.

1502
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,493
Someone will have to
make a sacrifice.

1503
01:49:56,191 --> 01:50:00,287
This mammoth city... is in
the palm of my hand.

1504
01:50:00,395 --> 01:50:03,057
It's a known fact.

1505
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:09,167
The guns are blazing.

1506
01:50:09,237 --> 01:50:12,263
We march ahead with
a bold heart.

1507
01:50:13,675 --> 01:50:14,972
This is our time.

1508
01:50:15,076 --> 01:50:17,067
It's a cocktail of
cash and comfort.

1509
01:50:17,946 --> 01:50:19,379
We're underground.

1510
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:21,278
But everything's
available here.

1511
01:50:21,783 --> 01:50:23,351
Baburao's having a ball.

1512
01:50:23,351 --> 01:50:30,553
He's having a ball.

1513
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:35,187
Baburao's having a ball.

1514
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:40,199
He's having a ball.

1515
01:50:48,843 --> 01:50:50,743
We didn't have a penny
in our pockets.

1516
01:50:50,845 --> 01:50:56,010
Now there's a sea of
wealth before us.

1517
01:50:58,152 --> 01:51:04,887
We're the uncrowned king
of the underworld.

1518
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:09,195
If anyones stops us...

1519
01:51:09,297 --> 01:51:11,458
...we kill him

1520
01:51:11,566 --> 01:51:15,024
...and bury him.

1521
01:51:15,103 --> 01:51:19,699
Everthing is adjusted.

1522
01:51:20,108 --> 01:51:23,100
But everything's
available here.

1523
01:51:24,078 --> 01:51:28,447
Baburao's having a ball.

1524
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:32,883
He's having a ball.

1525
01:51:34,422 --> 01:51:38,825
Sultan, i've arranged for a
rally in your area next week.

1526
01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:43,422
We'll announce that you've
joined our party.

1527
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:45,957
Prepare yourself.

1528
01:51:46,267 --> 01:51:47,962
There'll be poster all over.

1529
01:51:48,336 --> 01:51:51,794
For votes and not wanted.

1530
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:56,770
The world's a selfish place.

1531
01:51:56,844 --> 01:51:59,244
It's a thankless world.

1532
01:51:59,314 --> 01:52:01,782
No one feels compassionate
for you.

1533
01:52:04,018 --> 01:52:08,387
We snatch whatever we like.

1534
01:52:08,423 --> 01:52:10,482
We rule this place.

1535
01:52:11,859 --> 01:52:17,161
The entire system is right
under our feet.

1536
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:19,893
Live carefree.

1537
01:52:21,569 --> 01:52:23,867
The guns are blazing.

1538
01:52:23,938 --> 01:52:26,099
We march ahead with
a bold heart.

1539
01:52:26,174 --> 01:52:32,511
Everyone standing
back in the line.

1540
01:52:32,647 --> 01:52:34,308
But we're first.

1541
01:52:34,882 --> 01:52:36,281
We're underground.

1542
01:52:36,351 --> 01:52:38,842
But everything's
available here.

1543
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,649
Baburao's having a ball.

1544
01:52:40,688 --> 01:52:42,178
He's having a ball.

1545
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:43,917
He's having a ball.

1546
01:52:43,992 --> 01:52:45,755
Baburao's having a ball.

1547
01:52:45,827 --> 01:52:47,419
He's having a ball.

1548
01:52:57,105 --> 01:52:59,505
Those who make promises on
the bed often forget.

1549
01:53:01,743 --> 01:53:02,607
I'm different.

1550
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:07,138
You're dance as good
as you love.

1551
01:53:12,887 --> 01:53:13,717
Stay close.

1552
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:17,048
I'll make you an actress.

1553
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:27,300
You took so long to return.

1554
01:53:27,835 --> 01:53:29,097
You know how the government
functions.

1555
01:53:30,338 --> 01:53:32,272
The minister has organised
a rally in our area.

1556
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:38,638
Just watch, soon my car will
have flashing red-light as well.

1557
01:53:47,255 --> 01:53:48,119
You're a murderer!

1558
01:53:48,156 --> 01:53:49,384
Return me my son!

1559
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:52,323
He died after drinking
your poisonous liquor.

1560
01:53:52,393 --> 01:53:53,360
He's dead.

1561
01:53:53,828 --> 01:53:55,728
You killed him, you did!

1562
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:57,588
You will never live peacefully.

1563
01:53:57,732 --> 01:53:59,222
You'll rot. - Shoaib.

1564
01:53:59,333 --> 01:53:59,958
Murderer.

1565
01:54:00,068 --> 01:54:01,433
You will rot in hell.

1566
01:54:10,144 --> 01:54:12,044
Singhania has been
waiting outside.

1567
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:18,409
A man makes big when
people wait for him.

1568
01:54:22,056 --> 01:54:23,284
Go and send him after a while.

1569
01:54:40,141 --> 01:54:44,373
Close down all your business
before i kill you.

1570
01:54:50,318 --> 01:54:53,151
You can dress up like me...

1571
01:54:54,622 --> 01:54:55,919
...but you can never be me.

1572
01:54:58,659 --> 01:55:00,684
Patrick, i want the city clean.

1573
01:55:27,155 --> 01:55:29,919
Stop it, shoaib, don't
drink anymore.

1574
01:55:32,693 --> 01:55:33,887
He shouldn't have slapped me.

1575
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:39,524
When i was a child...

1576
01:55:41,736 --> 01:55:44,170
...father compelled me to go
against him when he slapped me.

1577
01:55:47,742 --> 01:55:51,143
I'm no longer a child
nor is he my father.

1578
01:55:54,048 --> 01:55:56,141
I thought he respects me
more than his father.

1579
01:55:57,785 --> 01:55:59,412
That's why i entrusted
the business to him.

1580
01:56:00,388 --> 01:56:01,912
But deceit is his nature.

1581
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,724
He deceived his father,
he deceived me...

1582
01:56:04,792 --> 01:56:06,089
...he'll deceive mumtaz...

1583
01:56:07,328 --> 01:56:08,761
one day he'll deceive this city.

1584
01:56:09,997 --> 01:56:10,986
It was my fault.

1585
01:56:12,066 --> 01:56:14,432
I thought we'll rule together.

1586
01:56:17,438 --> 01:56:18,905
But there can be only one king.

1587
01:56:20,274 --> 01:56:21,866
I made him my soldier...

1588
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:24,471
...but he's out to be the
king of the city.

1589
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:26,946
Sultan doesn't own the city...

1590
01:56:27,014 --> 01:56:28,311
...that everyone has to
follow his orders.

1591
01:56:30,251 --> 01:56:31,809
Wardhan wanted to do something,
he stopped him.

1592
01:56:32,353 --> 01:56:33,786
I wanted to do something,
he stopped me.

1593
01:56:35,923 --> 01:56:36,981
He's been bitten by
the political bug.

1594
01:56:38,359 --> 01:56:39,348
Wants to be a minister.

1595
01:56:41,963 --> 01:56:43,328
This business will only be
controlled by the bullet...

1596
01:56:43,364 --> 01:56:44,558
...and not lectures.

1597
01:56:45,499 --> 01:56:47,330
He committed murders for money.

1598
01:56:49,103 --> 01:56:50,661
It's difficult to
control people...

1599
01:56:51,739 --> 01:56:53,434
...that are addicted
to bloodshed.

1600
01:56:55,243 --> 01:56:58,610
That means it's impossible
to stop shoaib now.

1601
01:57:00,948 --> 01:57:03,041
Shoaib, think before
moving ahead.

1602
01:57:03,484 --> 01:57:04,746
Could this be the wrong path?

1603
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:06,615
This is my path, my decision...

1604
01:57:06,721 --> 01:57:07,915
...and this city will
be mine as well.

1605
01:57:08,522 --> 01:57:09,489
Get that.

1606
01:57:10,358 --> 01:57:11,620
What's wrong with you, shoaib?

1607
01:57:13,361 --> 01:57:14,350
I'm scared of you.

1608
01:57:14,829 --> 01:57:16,296
What are you saying?

1609
01:57:17,331 --> 01:57:19,196
I thought you're different.

1610
01:57:20,635 --> 01:57:22,535
But now i feel i don't
know you at all.

1611
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:24,603
Who are you, shoaib?

1612
01:57:27,875 --> 01:57:29,536
If i answer this question...

1613
01:57:32,513 --> 01:57:34,310
...then your question
will feel bad.

1614
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:40,014
Enough of question and answers.

1615
01:57:42,356 --> 01:57:43,789
Now i want to see...

1616
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:48,351
...whether he confronts
me or backstabs me.

1617
01:58:01,842 --> 01:58:03,571
Bad thoughts crop up in
the mind at night.

1618
01:58:04,812 --> 01:58:06,575
Go and sleep. - Stay awake.

1619
01:58:08,849 --> 01:58:10,908
I'll come back if i can't sleep.

1620
01:58:30,938 --> 01:58:31,996
Where are you going, sultan?

1621
01:58:32,673 --> 01:58:33,799
We'll come along.

1622
01:58:48,589 --> 01:58:53,151
'You can dress up like sultan
mirza but can't be one.'

1623
01:59:12,747 --> 01:59:13,611
Come in.

1624
01:59:14,882 --> 01:59:16,213
You're the enemy.

1625
01:59:16,951 --> 01:59:18,646
Your friend has raised
his hand on you...

1626
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,182
...and i'm extending mine.

1627
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:23,889
Don't think, take a seat.

1628
01:59:46,347 --> 01:59:48,872
Sultan is scared of
your progress.

1629
01:59:50,284 --> 01:59:53,276
He knows you'll pave
your own way.

1630
01:59:54,789 --> 01:59:57,690
That's why he wants
to suppress you...

1631
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:00,887
...instead of encouraging you.

1632
02:00:03,164 --> 02:00:04,654
He's afraid of changes.

1633
02:00:05,533 --> 02:00:08,434
But... if we've to move ahead...

1634
02:00:10,104 --> 02:00:12,504
...we'll have to get sultan
out of the way.

1635
02:00:14,275 --> 02:00:15,537
The decision is yours.

1636
02:00:17,011 --> 02:00:21,175
Remember... those who don't
keep pace with time...

1637
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:27,012
...lose the opportunity.

1638
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:41,996
Sultan's death will
be just as grand.

1639
02:00:46,173 --> 02:00:47,037
Tomorrow's his rally.

1640
02:00:48,509 --> 02:00:49,635
But there won't be
any commotion...

1641
02:00:51,278 --> 02:00:52,438
...just mourning silence.

1642
02:00:57,051 --> 02:01:02,990
But remember... if sultan
survives we'll be dead.

1643
02:01:22,358 --> 02:01:23,416
What's wrong, dear?

1644
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:25,994
He's gone to kill sultan.

1645
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:29,228
Do something, stop
him. I'm scared.

1646
02:01:29,899 --> 02:01:31,958
Go home, i'll do something.

1647
02:01:51,688 --> 02:01:53,713
The government also indulged
in illegal activities...

1648
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:56,418
...when you thought of
entering politics.

1649
02:01:56,993 --> 02:01:58,483
By letting you enter.

1650
02:01:59,996 --> 02:02:02,191
Agnel sir, when we
can be friends...

1651
02:02:03,633 --> 02:02:04,930
...then why take up enmity.

1652
02:02:06,202 --> 02:02:07,999
Now i've befriended the
government as well.

1653
02:02:09,539 --> 02:02:11,131
If you don't stop your
illegal activities...

1654
02:02:11,808 --> 02:02:13,571
...then your new friend will
make you pay dearly.

1655
02:02:15,178 --> 02:02:17,476
A man doesn't do bad deeds...

1656
02:02:18,615 --> 02:02:20,139
...to make the situations worse,
but to make it better.

1657
02:02:20,517 --> 02:02:24,510
And you will certainly notice a
change in your circumstances.

1658
02:02:25,388 --> 02:02:27,322
There will be water for everyone
and food to eat.

1659
02:02:27,390 --> 02:02:29,950
You mean everyone should resort
to illegal means...

1660
02:02:30,326 --> 02:02:31,384
...to make his condition better?

1661
02:02:31,494 --> 02:02:32,051
Sir...

1662
02:02:35,365 --> 02:02:36,923
someone has to become
sultan mirza...

1663
02:02:38,201 --> 02:02:40,999
...so that not everyone resorts
to illegal means.

1664
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:45,335
By helping some people you think
you've become a messiah.

1665
02:02:45,942 --> 02:02:50,106
Our party has chosen one
of your sympathisers.

1666
02:02:50,613 --> 02:02:53,377
And he is... sultan mirza.

1667
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:56,050
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1668
02:02:56,152 --> 02:03:01,954
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1669
02:03:02,025 --> 02:03:07,361
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1670
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:10,296
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1671
02:03:10,366 --> 02:03:16,236
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1672
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:18,536
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1673
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:35,480
As a child whenever i would
hear such addresses...

1674
02:03:36,326 --> 02:03:38,487
...i would feel like pelting
stones at the minister.

1675
02:03:39,529 --> 02:03:47,061
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1676
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:53,432
The rich never gathered hearing
these loudspeakers.

1677
02:03:55,278 --> 02:03:57,007
It draws only the poor.

1678
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:01,611
Thinking that today someone will
say something of their interest.

1679
02:04:02,352 --> 02:04:03,683
But nothing happened
until today.

1680
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:06,012
People kept silent after
finishing their speeches...

1681
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,718
...and we kept screaming.

1682
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,454
Agnel sir.

1683
02:04:15,298 --> 02:04:17,425
They're going to kill
sultan. - What?

1684
02:04:19,802 --> 02:04:20,996
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1685
02:04:21,070 --> 02:04:23,732
Who? - Shoaib.

1686
02:04:25,575 --> 02:04:27,941
Sultan won't step down we
will have to stop shoaib.

1687
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:31,472
Shoaib, stand near the desk
and keep your eyes open.

1688
02:04:31,814 --> 02:04:33,145
Take your men and
come from behind.

1689
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,415
Independence was only
for the rich.

1690
02:04:37,587 --> 02:04:39,020
The rest are still slaves.

1691
02:04:39,756 --> 02:04:43,692
Earlier it was the british... and
now its poverty.

1692
02:04:44,327 --> 02:04:46,625
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1693
02:04:47,463 --> 02:04:53,493
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1694
02:04:53,803 --> 02:04:57,967
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1695
02:04:59,442 --> 02:05:00,704
Leave me.

1696
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:05,773
Not every book makes
it to the library.

1697
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:09,714
Some are found at the old-paper
mart as well.

1698
02:05:11,187 --> 02:05:14,520
We're like those books.

1699
02:05:18,428 --> 02:05:19,759
Who else is with you?

1700
02:05:19,862 --> 02:05:21,523
Tell me. - There's one more.

1701
02:05:22,231 --> 02:05:22,993
Come on.

1702
02:05:23,099 --> 02:05:25,624
Till today you came up to me...

1703
02:05:26,002 --> 02:05:27,333
...when everyone turned you down.

1704
02:05:28,404 --> 02:05:30,304
Neither the police nor
the government.

1705
02:05:31,374 --> 02:05:33,069
And then approached me.

1706
02:05:33,743 --> 02:05:38,612
But now... you can approach
me first.

1707
02:05:41,718 --> 02:05:44,551
Mother, i want a pistol.
- There's one at home.

1708
02:05:44,654 --> 02:05:45,882
Mother, i want that one.

1709
02:05:48,358 --> 02:05:50,622
I'm only changing my way
of tackling things...

1710
02:05:52,195 --> 02:05:53,127
...but not my attitude.

1711
02:05:54,430 --> 02:06:06,501
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1712
02:06:16,853 --> 02:06:18,184
Seal the place.

1713
02:06:19,722 --> 02:06:20,984
Who is with you?

1714
02:06:22,225 --> 02:06:26,389
We found the two. Now it is
safe. Not until shoaib is there,

1715
02:06:28,798 --> 02:06:32,700
both are caught. Plan failed.

1716
02:07:02,565 --> 02:07:04,624
I came here for myself...

1717
02:07:06,469 --> 02:07:12,772
...but now i won't rest until
your dreams aren't fulfilled.

1718
02:07:14,744 --> 02:07:23,584
Glory to... - sultan mirza!

1719
02:07:24,854 --> 02:07:28,654
I'll take your leave.

1720
02:07:30,827 --> 02:07:32,260
Not like this, sultan.

1721
02:07:32,328 --> 02:07:34,660
Call rihana upstage. - Yes.

1722
02:07:35,131 --> 02:07:43,971
Rihana.

1723
02:07:44,106 --> 02:07:50,841
Rihana.

1724
02:08:46,202 --> 02:08:47,760
Ambulance.

1725
02:08:47,937 --> 02:08:49,336
Ambulance.

1726
02:08:49,438 --> 02:08:51,804
Please, someone call
the ambulance.

1727
02:08:52,041 --> 02:08:53,099
Call the ambulance.

1728
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:55,440
Call...

1729
02:09:25,374 --> 02:09:27,308
today mumbai is ruined.

1730
02:09:29,478 --> 02:09:31,912
The same mumbai that was
sultan's darling...

1731
02:09:33,316 --> 02:09:36,012
...which shoaib wanted
to control...

1732
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:38,951
...and i... wanted to protect.

1733
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:43,723
It's easy to choose between
the wrong and the right.

1734
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:48,258
But equally difficult
to choose...

1735
02:09:49,732 --> 02:09:50,892
...between two wrong people.

1736
02:09:54,604 --> 02:09:55,935
And that's where i lost.

1737
02:09:58,808 --> 02:10:00,400
The mafia alone isn't
responsible...

1738
02:10:00,509 --> 02:10:01,476
...for making shoaib.

1739
02:10:05,414 --> 02:10:07,006
The police is equally at fault.

1740
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:10,881
And 18 years later...

1741
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:15,748
...it's difficult to lay
a hand on him anymore.

1742
02:10:18,227 --> 02:10:20,195
Though he's no longer in india...

1743
02:10:20,963 --> 02:10:22,624
...but he rules mumbai.
