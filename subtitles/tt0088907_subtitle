1
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:41,969
Yes, Muniya. What is it?

2
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,334
It is my wedding.

3
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,515
Really?

4
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:47,595
You are lucky.

5
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:51,255
Master, I need your help.

6
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,895
Sure. Anything.

7
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:00,515
I need money.

8
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,156
Sure. No problem.

9
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:05,555
How much do you need?

10
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,575
Let me make an estimate.

11
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:10,455
You don't have an estimate?

12
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:13,375
Where is the bride from?

13
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:14,915
She is from my village.

14
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:17,495
Is she your relative?
Yes, my sister's daughter.

15
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,317
Why are you here?

16
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:31,955
Sir, It is my marriage.

17
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:33,955
Hurry up. Get back home.

18
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,614
Muniya, is this adulterated?

19
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,095
Master, that.

20
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,535
Leave it.

21
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,466
Get some glasses from inside.

22
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,337
Here.

23
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:02,215
No, thank you.

24
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:07,675
We are all equal before alcohol.

25
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:14,755
Here is to the health of your wife.

26
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,374
Master, this is unnecessary.

27
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:20,711
Never mind. Drink.

28
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:45,935
Soon to be married.

29
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,335
Don't be formal hereafter.

30
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:55,555
Hello

31
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,244
Come on, have a drink.

32
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,353
No.

33
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:02,535
I don't drink with such menials around.

34
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:04,675
In future, he may disrespect.

35
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:05,799
Why are you here?

36
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,755
Munian is getting married.

37
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:20,235
I know.

38
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:23,135
It is ridiculous.

39
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,175
<i>Muniyan singing.</i>

40
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:27,327
Muniya.

41
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:40,555
Muniya.

42
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:42,155
Muniya.

43
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:48,655
<i>Continue singing.</i>

44
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Muniya.

45
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,475
Muniya, Muniya.

46
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,017
Stop

47
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:13,142
Get up.

48
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:15,796
Get up. Stop singing.

49
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:18,859
Get up.

50
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,375
Still feeding?

51
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:21,855
How long are you on holidays?

52
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:23,795
Fifteen days, Sir

53
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:24,905
That is impossible.

54
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,835
Get back here right after the wedding.

55
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,395
It is a busy season

56
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,015
Hey! Brother.

57
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,175
Where is this place Chunnambukara theru?

58
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,475
Further more from here.

59
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,835
Do you know a Mr. Kunjitamanam there?

60
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:42,190
No Sir.

61
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:01,175
<i>Chanting in the background.</i>

62
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:11,715
<i>Chanting continues.</i>

63
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:31,402
Once more.

64
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
One more time

65
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,138
Ready?

66
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,935
Driver, please stop.

67
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:36,735
Driver, please stop

68
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:46,330
Don't sleep.

69
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,440
Get out here.

70
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:50,870
Come on.

71
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:00,075
Get in. Get in.

72
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,665
Get in.

73
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:05,535
Right. Right.

74
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:17,335
Muniyandi, did I scare your wife?

75
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:19,669
Come inside.

76
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:28,920
Don't be scared. He is a friend.

77
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:57,615
Shankaran Sir, did you know?

78
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:00,015
A movie is being made of this novel.

79
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,315
The readers can nominate the
actors for each character.

80
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:08,155
Do you have any suggestions?

81
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:11,855
I have been thinking but I have no clue.

82
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:15,055
I wonder who will play Gracykutty.

83
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:22,015
Muniyandi is here with his wife.

84
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,556
They are a good match.

85
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:43,835
This is all about luck.

86
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,553
Marriages are made in heaven.

87
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:48,435
Those days are gone, Sir.

88
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:49,912
Now it is all about money.

89
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,735
It is the cow. Don't be scared. Come on.

90
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:52,999
Look there.

91
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:54,915
That is our home.

92
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,084
Enter with your right foot first.

93
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:22,745
Muniyandi.

94
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:25,695
MUNIYANDI.

95
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:31,210
Your holiday end yesterday, isn't it?

96
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:33,135
What are you doing here?

97
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:36,173
I need one more day, Sir.

98
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:39,635
Join the morning shift tomorrow.

99
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:42,427
Where is your wife?

100
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:43,889
Call her, let me see.

101
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:51,175
What is your name?

102
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,288
Shivakami.

103
00:25:57,734 --> 00:25:59,024
Let her speak.

104
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,335
Tell him your name.

105
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:09,015
Hurry up.

106
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:11,900
Shivakami.

107
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:14,795
Live here decently.

108
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:29,675
Miniyandi. Superintendent needs you.

109
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:41,035
Elephants were spotted on the
grazing area near the dam.

110
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:44,075
We need to repair the electric fence.

111
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:46,075
This year,

112
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:48,498
no more expenditure, Mr. Jacob.

113
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:50,835
Audit objection.

114
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:54,847
What about the tender called for
to construct the guest house?

115
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,035
This is the constituency of
the revenue minister.

116
00:27:58,572 --> 00:27:59,604
So?

117
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:03,737
Mr. Jacob.

118
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:05,814
You don't know my position.

119
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:09,075
You have only a few months to retire.

120
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,297
Throw this job away.
It is better than licking their boots.

121
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,477
Why are you here?

122
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:29,251
Shanker Sir called for me.

123
00:28:59,463 --> 00:29:00,674
Come inside.

124
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,901
Here.

125
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,689
Whose picture is that?

126
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:20,449
It is his pictures.

127
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,214
Did you think these are
the pictures of film stars?

128
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:26,815
Had been lucky,
we would also be film stars.

129
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:28,476
Isn't it right, Muniya?

130
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,635
Really good, Sir.

131
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,567
This is my Grandpa.

132
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:48,107
This is my uncle.

133
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,719
This is my dear brother.

134
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,135
He is with a movie company in the city.

135
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,336
Who is this?

136
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:43,702
Pity! He is so scared.

137
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:47,495
He is about to retire.
Still he lick the boot of the minister.

138
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:50,455
He may have a reason, Mr. Jacob.

139
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:52,885
There is no reason here.

140
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:56,074
I will make an issue.
This is not my personal matter.

141
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,481
Leave it Jacob. It is not worth it.

142
00:31:00,716 --> 00:31:03,185
You are worse than him.

143
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:06,412
You are single.
What are you scared at?

144
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,127
I am not scared.

145
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,330
Then?

146
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:16,475
If you leave this job for a spiritual
path, you have to answer none.

147
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,496
Pathetic.

148
00:32:17,431 --> 00:32:19,755
Wait for a moment. I will be back.

149
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:28,211
Were you scared?

150
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:30,032
My God!

151
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:31,938
Any idea how scared I am?

152
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:34,402
Those are just cattle.

153
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,032
They are very domesticated.

154
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:37,963
You will get used to it.

155
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:40,327
No more work today.

156
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,010
Shall we go home? - Yes.

157
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,655
Did you cook?

158
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:47,372
I cooked your favorite dishes.

159
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,302
Who are you?

160
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,748
WHO ARE YOU?

161
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:46,875
Stop there.

162
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:58,877
Stop there.

163
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:20,722
How is the picture?

164
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,065
Here.

165
00:39:28,337 --> 00:39:29,431
Dear,

166
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,994
Dear,

167
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:33,861
Dear,

168
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,995
What a big garden.

169
00:39:37,156 --> 00:39:40,094
Oh my God! The flowers are huge.

170
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:43,395
So big. Yellow rose, Red rose.

171
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:45,957
Without leaves, so huge.

172
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,981
A lot of flowers.

173
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:49,154
Lovely.

174
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:51,795
I forbid you to go there.

175
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:53,302
It is wrong to go there.

176
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,515
Sir,

177
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,375
Yes.

178
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:01,715
That,

179
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,270
Could you write this for me?

180
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:18,150
Go on.

181
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,618
Kunchidapadam.

182
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,815
Who is that?

183
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,095
My father.

184
00:43:31,606 --> 00:43:33,106
Limestone merchant street.

185
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:35,175
Limestone merchant street.

186
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:38,795
Yes, 'Street' means 'theru'.

187
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,895
Ammapetai (Post).

188
00:43:50,124 --> 00:43:51,804
PO Ammapetai.

189
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:57,355
Through Chidambaram.

190
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,005
Via Chidambaram.

191
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:03,110
What next?

192
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:04,641
District.

193
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:07,135
Thennarkot.

194
00:44:07,426 --> 00:44:08,555
South.

195
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,832
Go on.

196
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:14,235
What next?

197
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,086
Here.

198
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:26,179
Do you want to learn English?

199
00:44:28,452 --> 00:44:31,015
In exchange, teach me Tamil.

200
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,804
Stand still.

201
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:38,035
There.

202
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,655
I will be back. Just a minute.

203
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:17,715
Sir

204
00:47:18,154 --> 00:47:19,275
Sir

205
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:20,935
Shankaran Sir.

206
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:22,224
I am here.

207
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,026
Greetings!

208
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:26,705
Come inside.

209
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,294
Nedumudi Sir and Innocent
Sir are in the car.

210
00:47:29,395 --> 00:47:31,911
They came to attend the
meeting of our trade union.

211
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,997
We just dropped-in.

212
00:47:34,192 --> 00:47:36,342
Yesterday, my bro-in-law
arrived from Dubai.

213
00:47:36,443 --> 00:47:37,955
The room is a mess.

214
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:39,295
I will come there.

215
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:40,455
One minute.

216
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:46,341
You know Venu sir, don't you?

217
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:47,474
Yes, I do.

218
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:48,875
That is Mr. Innocent.

219
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:03,755
Yesterday..

220
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:09,971
If you didn't come to the meeting,
we would be in trouble.

221
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:11,715
True.

222
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,479
When is the function?

223
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:14,715
Tomorrow.

224
00:48:14,816 --> 00:48:16,975
Be there. We have to
shoot the climax.

225
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:20,635
Tomorrow is the climax.
- Sir one more drink?

226
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:24,070
Drink. Have a drink.

227
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:31,715
I rarely drink with movie stars.

228
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:38,565
Is this color or Black and White?

229
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:44,195
It is all color.

230
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:48,135
Shall we drink one more round?
What you say?

231
00:48:54,355 --> 00:48:55,515
One more drink.

232
00:48:58,175 --> 00:49:01,535
I bought this from Paris.
For my wife and kids.

233
00:49:01,988 --> 00:49:03,207
It is good.

234
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:06,299
Is it available here? - No.

235
00:49:09,395 --> 00:49:11,435
Finish it. I will pour
one more drink.

236
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:14,295
It is costly.

237
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:16,815
Jacob.

238
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:22,795
Join us.

239
00:49:23,435 --> 00:49:24,435
Come.

240
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:27,494
He is a friend.
He work in this farm.

241
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:29,714
I hope he drink - Yes, he do.

242
00:49:29,815 --> 00:49:32,065
Is he a bad company? - No he is not.

243
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:34,624
I rarely get a chance like this.

244
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:38,795
Some people are..
No problem here.

245
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:41,655
It is OK, you are here.

246
00:49:47,575 --> 00:49:50,235
Hurry up, Jacob. See who are all here.

247
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:54,775
<i>Group passing judgment on Mr. Jacob</i>

248
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:56,595
Come on.

249
00:49:56,901 --> 00:49:58,095
Mr. Nedumudi Venu.

250
00:49:58,409 --> 00:49:59,655
I am Jacob

251
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,554
This is Mr. Innocent.

252
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:03,655
We are here for the movie shooting.

253
00:50:04,453 --> 00:50:07,258
We droped-in here
on the way to the meeting.

254
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:08,935
What about a drink?

255
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:10,078
Sure.

256
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:12,255
Do you need one, Sir?

257
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,570
Don't mix water.

258
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,851
You follow the old habits.

259
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:22,974
No, No.

260
00:50:23,492 --> 00:50:25,075
Don't mix water.

261
00:50:42,155 --> 00:50:44,115
Focus, focus the camera.

262
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,855
Is everyone in the frame?

263
00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:57,135
Come closer, closer.

264
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:04,685
Take a picture.

265
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:08,965
Now, you sit. I will take a picture.

266
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:13,155
Here, sit here.

267
00:51:14,206 --> 00:51:16,195
Upto the knees. Not the ground.

268
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:20,555
Cut the ground out from the frame.

269
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:26,314
Is everybody in the frame? - I will try.

270
00:51:27,703 --> 00:51:29,609
Smile. Smile.

271
00:51:32,075 --> 00:51:35,818
Smile. - A Closeup picture.

272
00:51:36,397 --> 00:51:38,812
Closer. Ready?

273
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:42,483
Now, everybody together.

274
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:49,495
Take care. Don't step on the glasses.

275
00:51:51,015 --> 00:51:52,075
I will sit down.

276
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:57,195
More towards right. A little bit more.
- Is this OK?

277
00:51:58,475 --> 00:51:59,568
Ready?

278
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:03,775
Who is she?

279
00:52:05,515 --> 00:52:09,295
We didn't see her before.
- Keep it down.

280
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,555
Do you have an eye on her?

281
00:52:12,702 --> 00:52:14,249
She is not that type of lady.

282
00:52:14,606 --> 00:52:15,975
Come on, Mate.

283
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:18,245
Shall we place a bet?

284
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:19,895
What bet?

285
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,905
Mind your words.
- Calm down. Relax. Cool down.

286
00:52:27,135 --> 00:52:30,755
This is really boring.
- Stop this. Cool down.

287
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,115
This is not civil. - Keep it down.

288
00:52:36,493 --> 00:52:37,715
It was not civil.

289
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:41,545
We can't do anything.

290
00:52:41,715 --> 00:52:43,095
Please forgive.

291
00:52:43,255 --> 00:52:45,015
It was a mistake. - Let us go.

292
00:52:46,905 --> 00:52:48,015
See you.

293
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:53,935
It was a mistake.

294
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:00,735
Is he always like this?
- No, not like this.

295
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:02,815
Shanker is short tempered.

296
00:53:04,635 --> 00:53:05,935
He cool down really soon.

297
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:08,745
Tomorrow, they will be friends.

298
00:53:18,353 --> 00:53:19,495
He is drunk.

299
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,835
He work here.

300
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:35,015
It should not be a problem.

301
00:53:36,165 --> 00:53:37,196
I feel terrible.

302
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,895
<i>Illegible conversations</i>

303
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,635
Get in. Get in here.

304
00:57:25,895 --> 00:57:27,035
Sir, Are you OK?

305
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,528
Are you ill?

306
00:57:28,935 --> 00:57:30,235
I have a headache.

307
00:58:00,595 --> 00:58:02,595
These crows are troublesome.

308
00:58:03,877 --> 00:58:05,035
I am sorry Jacob.

309
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:08,095
Never mind. I forgot it all.

310
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:10,875
Did you know,

311
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:13,215
how that fight with the
officer developed?

312
00:58:13,316 --> 00:58:14,323
No.

313
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:16,315
I am getting transferred.

314
00:58:17,504 --> 00:58:18,574
Anyway,

315
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:20,754
come let us have some fun.

316
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:25,755
By the by, why are you
close to that lady?

317
00:58:25,815 --> 00:58:27,355
Just human nature.

318
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:30,255
Come on, I have seen this a lot.

319
00:58:32,188 --> 00:58:34,695
Jacob, can you help her get a job?

320
00:58:34,895 --> 00:58:37,095
May be as a casual worker.

321
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:40,975
But make her husband work hard.

322
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:44,167
These days he is very lazy.

323
00:58:45,835 --> 00:58:50,415
Well, you are single. No
point saying this to you.

324
01:00:41,089 --> 01:00:42,455
What is it, darling?

325
01:00:46,155 --> 01:00:49,555
I wish, I had a job.

326
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:54,295
No. Never.

327
01:00:55,741 --> 01:00:57,665
You are Goddess Laxmi of this house.

328
01:00:58,101 --> 01:00:59,975
Like the leading light of the family,

329
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:01,415
you should always shine.

330
01:01:03,135 --> 01:01:04,135
No.

331
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:07,715
Don't trouble yourself with a job.

332
01:01:08,402 --> 01:01:10,115
If I cannot protect you,

333
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:13,465
there is no meaning to my life.

334
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,490
I have arranged a job for your wife.

335
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:33,850
Tomorrow, let her go to
the hay making unit.

336
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:40,050
No Sir, my wife don't need a job.

337
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:43,210
I had to try hard with
the management for this.

338
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:44,910
Don't be so arrogant.

339
01:02:45,876 --> 01:02:48,165
Tomorrow onwards you are
in the night shift.

340
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:50,626
Let me see if I can get a hold on you.

341
01:04:47,629 --> 01:04:49,925
Shivakami. Shivakami.

342
01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:51,545
SHIVAKAMI.

343
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,925
Oh my God!

344
01:06:34,527 --> 01:06:38,285
Don't know, hurry up.
- No idea - Come along.

345
01:06:45,245 --> 01:06:48,200
Who is that? - I don't know.
- Alive? - I don't know.

346
01:08:43,524 --> 01:08:46,164
I knew this in the morning
from the milkman.

347
01:08:46,265 --> 01:08:48,195
I heard he hacked this wife to death.

348
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:52,550
Really terrible.

349
01:13:17,547 --> 01:13:18,625
Shankaran Sir.

350
01:13:20,391 --> 01:13:21,505
What happened, Sir?

351
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,280
What happened, Sir?

352
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,163
Hold him.

353
01:13:31,785 --> 01:13:34,745
What happened, Sir? - Sir, Sir.

354
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:44,025
What happened, Sir? - Sir, Sir.

355
01:13:47,618 --> 01:13:48,774
Shankaran Sir.

356
01:15:05,409 --> 01:15:06,769
He is in deep sleep.

357
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,135
What shall we do?

358
01:15:08,269 --> 01:15:09,761
It is time for us to leave.

359
01:15:10,638 --> 01:15:13,385
Before we go, shall we
lock the back door?

360
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:16,365
That is a good idea. Let
us not disturb him.

361
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,185
Milk.

362
01:16:47,176 --> 01:16:48,285
Good morning.

363
01:16:49,161 --> 01:16:50,705
May I come in, Sir?

364
01:16:51,864 --> 01:16:53,365
I am an insurance agent.

365
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:58,185
We have a new policy to cover
all the risks in your life.

366
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:47,225
Don't do it, Sir.

367
01:17:47,685 --> 01:17:48,685
It is wrong.

368
01:17:49,725 --> 01:17:50,725
It is wrong.

369
01:18:02,793 --> 01:18:04,305
Poor guy, Muniyandi.

370
01:18:05,878 --> 01:18:06,965
Poor guy.

371
01:18:08,445 --> 01:18:12,965
He had his vengeance at
the cost of this life.

372
01:18:20,085 --> 01:18:24,265
To whom do I beg for my absolution.

373
01:18:31,485 --> 01:18:37,805
My fate may be to wander aimlessly
by carrying my own dead body.

374
01:19:14,425 --> 01:19:17,245
My friends helped me find this job.

375
01:19:28,005 --> 01:19:29,005
But,

376
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:35,325
I realize with fear, I lost my
concentration and ability to work.

377
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:42,365
Guilt.

378
01:19:43,342 --> 01:19:44,465
Fear.

379
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,545
One day,

380
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:49,525
I moved out of town without
letting anybody know.

381
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:52,144
He may not be far.

382
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:54,144
He may be near the jetty.

383
01:19:54,245 --> 01:19:55,824
Let us have a look there.

384
01:20:08,511 --> 01:20:09,565
How much?

385
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:10,725
Two.

386
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:23,205
Soda? - Yes.

387
01:21:49,856 --> 01:21:51,209
Excuse me.

388
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,505
Today morning,

389
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:07,665
I help you stand up and walk out.
Don't you remember?

390
01:22:07,766 --> 01:22:09,065
Two drinks - Hold on.

391
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:11,144
Do you remember what you said?

392
01:22:23,985 --> 01:22:27,505
You agreed not to drink again.

393
01:22:31,745 --> 01:22:34,325
You agreed not to drink again.

394
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:38,205
You should not stay any
longer after this drink.

395
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:30,505
Thank you.

396
01:23:40,776 --> 01:23:43,505
Once, he was in a good position abroad.

397
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:47,930
A lady he met there, made him an addict.

398
01:23:48,685 --> 01:23:51,665
Once you fall for these
ladies, there is no way out.

399
01:24:02,685 --> 01:24:06,245
Why cant you buy food with
this money you got begging?

400
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:08,139
Do you have to drink this poison?

401
01:24:08,287 --> 01:24:09,325
Go away.

402
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,262
How are you now?

403
01:27:04,441 --> 01:27:06,765
Do you know the condition of your liver?

404
01:27:07,364 --> 01:27:08,845
Really alarming.

405
01:27:18,644 --> 01:27:21,165
Once, I use to be a drunk.

406
01:27:22,465 --> 01:27:25,565
Rather, I had all the major vices.

407
01:27:27,137 --> 01:27:29,365
Do you know how I got rid of those?

408
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,625
I became religious.

409
01:27:34,355 --> 01:27:37,425
When I feel tempted,
I read Bagavat Gita.

410
01:27:38,402 --> 01:27:40,125
It will work wonders.

411
01:28:04,283 --> 01:28:05,345
Hello.

412
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:07,185
Yes, it is.

413
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:10,557
No, no.

414
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,845
We don't stock fiction.

415
01:28:15,376 --> 01:28:17,945
We deal science and religious books.

416
01:28:18,314 --> 01:28:19,384
Sorry.

417
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,645
Yes, yes. Welcome.

418
01:28:58,608 --> 01:29:02,345
The doctor's advice had no effect.

419
01:29:07,825 --> 01:29:11,605
Words and sentences
didn't come to rescue.

420
01:29:27,976 --> 01:29:33,445
If possible, you should stay
away from this surroundings.

421
01:29:35,487 --> 01:29:37,265
It is good to travel.

422
01:29:38,566 --> 01:29:40,985
Preferably to religious places.

423
01:30:05,393 --> 01:30:06,885
That I how I begin,

424
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,105
this journey.

425
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,193
Mother.

426
01:34:46,045 --> 01:34:47,185
Shivakami.
