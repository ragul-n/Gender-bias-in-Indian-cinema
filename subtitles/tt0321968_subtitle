1
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,120
'Debashish went off today.
He won't be able to forget me ever.'

2
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,160
'But, no one could make out that..'

3
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,640
'..I was pretending a smile
on my face and thus, bid good bye.'

4
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,440
'I said with a smile
on my face that..'

5
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,560
'..I am a nurse and giving
a new life to different people..'

6
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,360
'..by lighting a lamps
in their life is my duty.'

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,240
Number 12.

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Go, go fast.

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,840
Number 13. Number 14.

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Number 14, where is he? Do fast.

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Number 15.
- Sister.

12
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,760
Amar Babu..
- This time, I shall be..

13
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,360
Won't you go home?
Wait for a little while.

14
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,160
She is calling you.

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,120
Why should I go? You go.

16
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Go fast or else, you will
have to listen to her scolding.

17
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,640
Where were you? Come soon.

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Number 17.

19
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Sister.. the guy is not able
to eat even today. - Number 18.

20
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,400
Who told you that
he is not able to eat?

21
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,320
I went personally and fed him.

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
Did he have his food?
Isn't he coughing?

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,760
No.. no. You are being called.

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,720
Me? Oh!

25
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Number nineteen.. number nineteen.

26
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,800
Sister, this cheques had..

27
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,360
It got bounced, Keep it with you.

28
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,920
Number nineteen.. number nineteen.

29
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,280
What happened? Aren't you
getting any kind of pain today?

30
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Number twenty..
number twenty.. number twenty.

31
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,520
We have received around
one fifty number of applications..

32
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,160
.. till now for bed number 24.

33
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,440
After taking interviews we have seen.

34
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,400
We have cases of General
Paralysis of the insight.

35
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,520
Paranoia, Cyzophenia,
Hysteria, Manicure reactions..

36
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
..Cause unknown.
Acute mania, post epileptic..

37
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,760
Just hold on.
You said Acute maniac. Didn't you?

38
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,760
Well.. I am very much more interested
in such cases than otherwise.

39
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,920
As a matter of fact I would prefer to
have a particular case of this type.

40
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,120
You admit one person
from such kind of cases.

41
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,880
But, I have studied that case.

42
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,720
Yes.. yes, I know. I know.

43
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,880
And hence, I want to take
up such a case once again.

44
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,360
There is a special motive behind that.

45
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,800
I want to prove that
in mentally imbalance state..

46
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,280
..if one can create
a perfect rapport..

47
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,680
Just give me.

48
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
Thank you.

49
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,360
If one can create a perfect
rapport in a mentally imbalance..

50
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,920
..patient, then, we can avoid
every other kind of treatment..

51
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,200
..like operation and shock treatment.

52
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,280
The mental fixation of a mentally
imbalanced patient would become easier.

53
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,440
We have already
experienced that it works.

54
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,280
Exactly. And, that is why I wish
to take up such kind of a case again.

55
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Because who knows..
the case of Debashish..

56
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,080
..was just by chance successful or so.

57
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
So, if we can cure few
more cases of such types..

58
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,840
..then in that case, we can follow
this procedure regularly as a law.

59
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,080
Would we able to give more
4-5 beds to such cases, then?

60
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,960
Yes. And, there is not just
one Radha sister for this job.

61
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,960
Every nurse will have
to handle such cases.

62
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,080
Did you listen? You had better
asked your nurses trained that way.

63
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,400
Whose case is the worst of all?

64
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,080
Tapas Choudhury..
a gentleman called Tapas Choudhury.

65
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,640
Tapas Choudhury.
All right. Take him up.

66
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Tapas.. Tapas.. look,
how beautifully that girl is dancing.

67
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,000
You didn't say anything.

68
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,720
I have already told you, Tapas.
Learn to walk on sand.

69
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,040
Be practical.

70
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,280
Look.. I didn't come here
to listen to your advices.

71
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
I want to know from these many days..

72
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,120
If you haven't understood
anything for these many days..

73
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,520
..there is no use of
you knowing it now also.

74
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,080
First understand that
life is not just a novel.

75
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,200
Then, we shall discuss further.

76
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,520
Can I know how you discovered
that life is not only a novel..

77
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,760
..after such a long time?

78
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,080
Honestly,
there is no use talking to you.

79
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,400
Exactly on the front page..
news of bloodshed.

80
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,560
If you can't understand in this way..

81
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,400
..you will understand
in some other manner, Tapas.

82
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,960
Mitroda..
is this girl, a relative of Sulekha?

83
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,680
Sulekha again.

84
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,240
Mitroda..
I will meet this girl personally.

85
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,920
Get up, get up that's enough.
We have to leave.

86
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,400
Get up.

87
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,360
Tell me where shall I take you
so that you will sit with a cool mind?

88
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,920
Sit here..
sit here. Sit.. sit. Sit here.

89
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,480
Don't go anywhere before I come back.

90
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,720
I am going to call a taxi.
Did you understand?

91
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,720
Can you understand?

92
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,360
Don't go anywhere before I come back.

93
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,360
I am going to call a taxi.
Sit here with a cool mind.

94
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,880
Yes.. I will take care
of everything. Listen.

95
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,560
Who? Who are you?
Whom do you want to see?

96
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,360
Aren't you Sulekha's friend?

97
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,720
Sulekha.. who is Sulekha?

98
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
Don't you know her?

99
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,320
Are you trying to act
smart as you are her friend.

100
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
This time..
I will really scream and make noise.

101
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,520
Do make.

102
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Come on, tell me. You didn't tell me.

103
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,480
See.. this person..

104
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,480
Go.. get out.

105
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,280
Who is that?

106
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,720
What is he saying now...

107
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,040
He is telling that
Sulekha wants to kill him.

108
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,520
Not Sulekha.. not Sulekha.

109
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,280
He must be thinking
of Sulekha's mother-in-law.

110
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,000
It has been already 26 days
of this month we are in this lodge.

111
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,240
Like a gentleman he can ask me,
that Mitroda.

112
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,680
What should I do I am in love,
should I fall in love?

113
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,200
Bullshit!

114
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,920
No.. no.

115
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,720
Everything is in a mess.

116
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,480
Hey, Shatru..
what do I do now, tell me?

117
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,320
I will have to go to Delhi
tomorrow by the 2'o' clock train.

118
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't you know your sister-in-law?

119
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
You don't worry about
all those things.

120
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,840
I shall manage everything, Mitroda.

121
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,880
I will come back in ten days.

122
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,720
Ten days?

123
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,240
I was thinking of going
to Ghashi with your sister-in-law.

124
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,200
Her father and elder brother
also stays there itself.

125
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,920
Do one thing. If you want to admit him
in the hospital meanwhile do admit him.

126
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,640
If you want me to make
any more arrangements..

127
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
..I shall do so.

128
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,840
I feel like.. as if I will go mad.

129
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,440
Mad again..
what is there to become mad in it?

130
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,280
Who is that? Who is that?

131
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,440
We shall become mad.

132
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,560
Come.

133
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,840
Hello.. hello..
good morning, Mr. Choudhury.

134
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,400
How do you feel?
How did you like this place?

135
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,400
Who are you?
- Me? I have just come to see you.

136
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,120
To see what?

137
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,560
Why? Because,
you have come to a totally new place..

138
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,600
..shouldn't I see whether
you are comfortable or not?

139
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,560
What is this? Is this a hospital?

140
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,840
Who is she?

141
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,240
I am..

142
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,000
She is one of us, working here.

143
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,600
Why do women come to my room?

144
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,680
Why do women come?

145
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,760
Ask her to go away.

146
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,880
Nurse.. hasn't Radha come as yet?

147
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,720
We have informed her.
- Okay.. very good.

148
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,120
Okay, Dr. Banerjee.. have you noticed?

149
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,040
This case of Tapas.. seems to be..

150
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
..it is an acute excitement
of schizophrenia..

151
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,240
But I didn't notice any
confusion in his thoughts.

152
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,560
Come, Radha.. please come.. come.
We have all been waiting for you.

153
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,720
Here's something for you.

154
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,880
Look and understand as to
what extent we have all praised you.

155
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,080
We are all very proud of you..
very proud.

156
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,120
Have you seen our new patient,
Tapas Choudhury?

157
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,320
No, sir.

158
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,800
At least, you might have definitely
gone through his case history.

159
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,480
No.

160
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,640
This is very unlike you.
I didn't expect this from you.

161
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Well, this is his case history.

162
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,040
Whenever you have time read this well.

163
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,640
This case is the same as Debashish.

164
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,640
Acute mania. And, the treatment
also would go on in that same line.

165
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,400
Also, this guy writes
dramas and novels.

166
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,800
So, you will have to be extra alert.

167
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,440
Because, such kind of people
become neurotic in their behavior.

168
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,200
But, sir.
Please spare me for this time.

169
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,560
I can't take up this case.
- You can't?

170
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,480
May I know the reason for it?

171
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,280
I have certain problems.
- Do you have problems?

172
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
What problem do you have?

173
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,320
Now, tell me..
what problem do you have?

174
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,440
Don't you wish to work anymore?

175
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,360
I don't wish to pretend any more.

176
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,720
No.. no.. no.

177
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,960
This is not acting,
this is not acting.

178
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,480
This is the way of our treatment,
our treatment.

179
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,200
It is a most essential
factor of my treatment.

180
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,960
You had cured Debashish
with the same kind of treatment.

181
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,000
And, Tapas Choudhury
is in the same state.

182
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,000
Can't you understand that if this attempt
of mine also becomes successful..

183
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,800
..what a big achievement it would be?

184
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,440
This wonder has happened
just because of this acting.

185
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
You can do it alone.

186
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,040
Even, I can't do it.
I am.. truly, seriously in..

187
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,320
I see.

188
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,880
But, the way you had shown your
courage in the case of Debashish..

189
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,840
..I had taken up this
case trusting on you.

190
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,640
Now, everything is
solely relying on you.

191
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,840
And, now you are saying
that you can't handle it.

192
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,120
Is this reason of yours, the truth..

193
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,040
..or is there any other
hurdle in your mind?

194
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,440
Okay, you may go now.

195
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,760
'Debashish went off today.'

196
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,040
'While leaving, he said to me,
'you are my true friend.'

197
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,280
'I will never be able
to forget you ever in my life.'

198
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,080
'But, no one knows that
I could really act very well.'

199
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,040
'I have bid him good
be with a smiling face.'

200
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,120
'I said to myself with a smiling face,
I am just a nurse.'

201
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,200
'It is my duty to light a
new lamp in the lives of those..'

202
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,560
'..come here sick and disturbed.'

203
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,240
May I come in, sir?
- Come in.

204
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,800
Sit.

205
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,480
I had heard that you had watched
the case of Debashish very minutely.

206
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
I am very glad.
I am very glad, indeed.

207
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,440
Our new patient, Tapas Choudhury
he has the same illness too.

208
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
And, the treatment would
be in the same line too.

209
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,680
You already know that in the case
of Debashish, Radha was a miracle.

210
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,320
The way Radha had treated
him and cured him..

211
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,240
..I wish that in the same
manner you also treat and cure Tapas.

212
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,200
Me? Me?

213
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,800
Why? Don't you trust yourself?

214
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,600
No. That is not the issue.

215
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,720
While behaving with this patient..

216
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,920
..you must always keep in mind..

217
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,320
..one thing that he has been cheated
by some girl whom he loved a lot.

218
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,680
She has given him a very big shock.

219
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,320
She has insulted him.
She has poisoned his entire mind.

220
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,240
And, that has slowly and gradually made
this kind of an impression in his mind.

221
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,520
A tragic expression,
that tragic impression..

222
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,040
..that insult, that hatred
with your love and affection..

223
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,440
..you will have to
wipe it off entirely.

224
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,200
You will have to pretend
to be such kind of a woman..

225
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,360
..in whom he should see his
mother or the reflection of her.

226
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,280
His mother?
- Yes.

227
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,080
When a man in his infancy sees
something new for the very first time..

228
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,000
..then, he moves his hands and
legs and crawl towards it on his own.

229
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,520
And, that is called
the Auto Erotic Stage.

230
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,720
And, after that, when man
looks at a face and starts smiling..

231
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,240
..then, for the first time..
love is born within his heart.

232
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,720
And, that is the love
towards himself.. Self love.

233
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,400
And, which we call
as Anesthetic Stage.

234
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,200
After that, man starts
loving his mother and father.

235
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Most often, girls love their
father more and boys, their mother.

236
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,040
This is called Oedipus
and Electra complex.

237
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,560
And most of the times neurosis
problem starts in this stage.

238
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,120
Loving one's mother is a work
against the society's principles.

239
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,440
The man who is able
to understand this..

240
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
..then, he wishes to eradicate
the thoughts of his mother..

241
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,720
..from his sub conscious mind.

242
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,240
But, he doesn't become successful.

243
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,360
This results in a depression.

244
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Then, his focus is
diverted to the real world.

245
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,600
The real, material world of facts.

246
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,000
He tries to find the behaviors and
reflection of his mother in someone else.

247
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,360
And, in the one,
whom he finds all that..

248
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
..he starts developing
a feeling of liking for her.

249
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,160
But, during this process
of searching and finding love..

250
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,120
..if there turns out
to be any disappointments..

251
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,760
..or any differences..

252
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,600
..then.. he again becomes like
a child and starts behaving like one.

253
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,680
Today, Tapas Choudhury
is at the same stage.

254
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,680
Now, you will have to create such
a picture of yours in front of him..

255
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,960
..which would be a combination
of his mother and lover as well.

256
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,480
This is what we call as creating
a perfect rapport balance.

257
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,360
It means creating an
emotional close relation.

258
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,800
Take this, drink this.

259
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,320
Where..? Have this juice.

260
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,360
Who are you?

261
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,320
Me? I am a nurse.

262
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,080
The doctor in charge of here..

263
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,520
..has sent me to take care of you.

264
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,320
He thinks that I don't know anything.

265
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
He thought that I was mad.

266
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,640
I know that Sulekha has sent you.

267
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,840
Tell your doctor that I
won't be able to live like this.

268
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,017
Why? Tell me, what has happened?

269
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:21,537
Get me some papers.
- Paper?

270
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:29,057
Here is the paper.

271
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:37,737
Could something be written
or painted on this paper?

272
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:39,257
I can understand everything.

273
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,257
Tell Sulekha that I
can understand everything.

274
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:47,897
But, why are you at this hour?

275
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:50,697
So then, tell me what do I do?

276
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:54,017
I didn't get time.
Moreover you sir called me.

277
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,977
You'll know everything
after you read this.

278
00:30:58,697 --> 00:31:02,337
Sister.. have you posted my letter?

279
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:06,217
Okay, you may go.

280
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,217
Not like that. Like this.

281
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:18,297
Salute.

282
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:24,417
Why are you in such a hurry?

283
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:27,457
How many days had I given you time?

284
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:29,737
In such work, nothing will
happen if you are in a haste.

285
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:38,937
Take this.. you may present
this cheques at the bank.

286
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:42,177
Did you get it?
Every time, just money.. money.

287
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:43,617
I just don't like this anymore.

288
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:03,257
Can you give me one cigarette?

289
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:05,097
Cigarette?
- Yes.

290
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,337
Do you know.. because of that mad man,
not a single cigarette is spared.

291
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:11,377
What is going on?

292
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:14,617
What were you doing?

293
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:16,297
He asked me for a cigarette.

294
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:18,337
Oh! So, he asked for
a cigarette and you..

295
00:32:21,217 --> 00:32:22,577
Who are you?

296
00:32:24,657 --> 00:32:27,497
That new patient..
- Oh! A new patient.

297
00:32:28,377 --> 00:32:30,657
Give all the things that
are there inside your pocket.

298
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:33,577
Nurse..

299
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:38,297
Take all these things..

300
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:40,537
..and see to it that he is not
able to get such things inside again.

301
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:41,817
Okay.. okay.

302
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:48,297
Come on. There is nothing to fear.
You come with me.

303
00:32:58,457 --> 00:32:59,537
Please sit.

304
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,857
Why did you go down at this hour?

305
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:18,737
Where did I go down?
I couldn't even come up as yet.

306
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:27,617
Okay.. tell me where
do you have a problem?

307
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,537
What are you seeing?
- Seeing you.

308
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:36,097
..Okay, do you treat
everyone as the same here?

309
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:39,257
Hello.. hello. Good morning, Dipten.

310
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,017
This is..?

311
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:46,697
I mean.. my name is
Mrityunjay Bandopadhyay.

312
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:48,697
The senior doctor of here has sent me.

313
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,097
Oh! Yes..
yes.. yes.. yes. Now, I remember.

314
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:52,897
Good that I met you. Please sit.. sit.

315
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,777
This Tapas Babu used
to stay with you, isn't it?

316
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:55,897
Oh! Yes.

317
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:58,057
Now, I understood.
Good that you have come.

318
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:01,097
Dipten.. where are those
queries regarding Tapas Babu?

319
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:02,297
Here.

320
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,617
Look Mrityunjay Babu..
- Yes, sir.

321
00:34:05,817 --> 00:34:08,617
There are many queries
written in these papers.

322
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:12,497
Please fill them up after
thinking and understanding well..

323
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:15,737
..with their answers
and do return it to me.

324
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:17,337
Okay, sir.. fine.

325
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:18,737
These questions are very important.

326
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:20,697
I understand.
I wanted to ask you something?

327
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:21,897
Yes, please do.

328
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,337
What about the expenses of Tapas?

329
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:26,297
You need not worry about
any of Tapas' expenses.

330
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:28,617
We would pay for all his expense.

331
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:31,457
Because that bed is a research bed.

332
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,337
Here.. you may now
take all your belongings.

333
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,497
What are all these?

334
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:47,577
Why do you keep coming to me always?

335
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,497
Don't come until I call you.

336
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:58,177
Well..

337
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:02,617
..what do I do if
you don't call me at all?

338
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:08,337
I won't call you..
I won't call you ever.

339
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,457
Okay, don't call me.

340
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:14,937
But, have your food. Will you spoil
your health by not eating anything?

341
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:22,497
What are you seeing?

342
00:35:25,817 --> 00:35:26,977
This is the knife used
for just spreading butter.

343
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:31,017
Let me see.

344
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:39,337
What are you doing?
Leave it.. leave it, Tapas Babu.

345
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:51,497
Now.. what will you do now? Go.

346
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:59,577
Go and tell Sulekha.. Go.. go.

347
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:03,377
Get out.. Get out.

348
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:06,697
Tapas Babu.. Tapas Babu.

349
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:09,297
Tapas Babu.

350
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:12,337
I don't want anything.
I won't eat anything.

351
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:16,297
Go.. go.. go.

352
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,777
Sir, this is going out of control now.

353
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:25,297
You repeat that earlier injection.

354
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:26,737
But, how do we give him at this stage?

355
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,257
You will have to..
- Who is that? Who?

356
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:31,217
You will have to
give him the injection.

357
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:32,977
We'll have to do this.

358
00:36:38,937 --> 00:36:41,097
Okay, fine. Let me see.

359
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:44,537
Good morning, sir.

360
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:46,057
Good morning.

361
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:51,017
I will have to go out this evening.

362
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:54,057
I won't be able to come back
before day after tomorrow evening.

363
00:36:54,937 --> 00:36:57,057
Tomorrow evening, at six 'o' clock..

364
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:59,537
..Debashish will come
here for his monthly check-up.

365
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:03,817
You.. Would you be able
to attend to this case?

366
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:06,577
Yes.. yes. Yes, sir.. I shall do it.

367
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,137
Thank you.

368
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:28,537
Hello..

369
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:34,937
With me?

370
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:39,257
Oh! Yes.

371
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:41,897
I am going right away.. right now.

372
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:46,777
'Debashish.'

373
00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:27,297
Greetings! Are you.. Radha?

374
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:31,577
Oh! I have come from Debashish babu.

375
00:38:33,297 --> 00:38:34,937
He has gone out for a few days.

376
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:38,377
Hence, aunty means his mother..

377
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:41,817
..has sent you message that
there are no much complications now.

378
00:38:41,897 --> 00:38:43,217
He is absolutely fine.

379
00:38:44,897 --> 00:38:48,537
He.. has he gone out for some work?

380
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:52,297
Yes.. some work regarding
his business.. he has gone for that.

381
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:53,857
Has he gone alone?

382
00:38:54,257 --> 00:38:56,697
Yes. It is a good thing.

383
00:38:57,137 --> 00:39:00,857
Aunty wanted to know when
you are going to their house.

384
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:05,017
House. I will go one day.

385
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:08,297
Okay. Then, I take your leave. Bye.

386
00:39:08,657 --> 00:39:09,817
Bye.

387
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:39,897
You see that the..
oh! Beena.. listen.. listen.

388
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:46,057
How is he?
How is Tapas Babu doing now?

389
00:39:46,857 --> 00:39:51,777
No, sir. I am not able to
influence him. It's impossible.

390
00:39:51,937 --> 00:39:54,817
Don't say impossible. Impossible.

391
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:57,617
I.. I am sorry, sir.

392
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:00,337
How is his behavior?

393
00:40:00,937 --> 00:40:03,737
Hostile.. he has no hunger at all.

394
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:06,297
Temperature?
- 99.

395
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:08,937
Counts?

396
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:12,737
110.. volume very weak and low.

397
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:18,537
The biggest difficulty is that..
he never cools down at all.

398
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:22,337
Well.

399
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:32,737
You must hold on to this position.

400
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:35,937
Lift your legs towards the ceiling.

401
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:38,297
Now stay like this.

402
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:41,737
Keep these.

403
00:40:41,977 --> 00:40:45,017
Sister.. shall I tell you one thing?

404
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:46,697
What is it?

405
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:51,337
Today, I won't let you
drink at all at any cost.

406
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,977
Why are you so stubborn about this?

407
00:40:54,297 --> 00:40:55,937
Sister..
are you the one, telling this.

408
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:58,457
I never misbehave in inebriated
state after drinking alcohol.

409
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:00,777
I get inebriated and
then I drink alcohol.

410
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:05,017
Please sister.. give me only
very little. I won't have any more.

411
00:41:05,097 --> 00:41:06,937
Won't you have ever after?
- I won't have it ever again.

412
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:08,177
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.

413
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,217
Sure?
- Yes.

414
00:41:41,337 --> 00:41:42,937
Hey.. here, take it.

415
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:47,697
Do you remember..?
You won't drink ever again..?

416
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:48,617
Never again, sister.

417
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,057
Sister, thank you.. thank you.

418
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:54,017
Thank you, sister. You are very good.

419
00:42:01,337 --> 00:42:02,937
What happened again?
Why are you laughing so much?

420
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:04,697
How are you?
- At last, have you come?

421
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:07,697
From when I have been waiting for you.
- Leave me.. leave me, I said.

422
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,777
No.. no, I won't leave you.
I won't leave you at any cost.

423
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:14,657
Listen.. you write one more letter.

424
00:42:14,897 --> 00:42:16,457
This time, he would definitely come.

425
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:32,137
"Who else could be
such a good friend..?"

426
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:36,497
"Just like you, Mister?"

427
00:42:37,577 --> 00:42:44,537
"At times she's my darling, at times
she's my wife, at times she's sister."

428
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:46,457
"Sister?"

429
00:42:54,897 --> 00:43:02,017
"Who else could be such a
good friend.. just like you, Sister?"

430
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:06,577
"She went away. Let her go."

431
00:43:08,697 --> 00:43:15,857
"A heartbroken person
suffers like Devdas.."

432
00:43:16,577 --> 00:43:23,377
" There was a lady in his
life called Parvati, mister."

433
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:29,577
"Just one peg makes
him forget this fact."

434
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:37,137
"Who else could be such a
good friend.. just like you, Mister?"

435
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:44,977
"At times she's my darling, at times
she's my wife, at times she's sister."

436
00:43:53,337 --> 00:43:56,977
"I won't love anyone
as much as I love you."

437
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:00,057
"These days girlfriends don't say that
they love us. All they ask for is money."

438
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,737
"Give me some money."

439
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:10,017
"Treat your glass as your girlfriend
and talk to as much as you want to."

440
00:44:10,257 --> 00:44:13,937
"It won't cost you money, O mister."

441
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:21,457
"Who else could be such a
good friend.. just like you, mister?"

442
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:29,297
"At times she's my darling, at times
she's my wife, at times she's sister."

443
00:44:37,697 --> 00:44:44,497
"The child cries due to lack of food.
There is no end to the sufferings."

444
00:44:49,257 --> 00:44:57,417
"Immerse yourself in the bottle
and you will forget all your sorrows."

445
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:05,617
"Who else could be
such a good friend?"

446
00:45:07,697 --> 00:45:12,657
I think that this case is
complicated for our experiment.

447
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:17,017
The whole difficulty is..

448
00:45:17,697 --> 00:45:21,817
..that the patient is running
at the risk of death. So exhaustion.

449
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:23,977
He could die.

450
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:27,337
Do you know what
the matter is, Dipten?

451
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:35,737
If this case of ours fail.. I won't
be able to establish this theory.

452
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:40,657
We can see for another
three four days more.

453
00:45:41,017 --> 00:45:45,057
After that, I feel.. that it would be
better that we start some other treatment.

454
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:46,857
I am afraid you are right.

455
00:45:48,177 --> 00:45:51,897
May be, I shall have to
take records for shock therapy.

456
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:55,097
Okay, how is Tapas Babu today?

457
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:56,537
He is the same as he was.

458
00:45:56,817 --> 00:45:59,857
What is your opinion about Beena?

459
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,697
How is she handling
the case of Tapas Babu?

460
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,297
She is trying her level best.

461
00:46:05,857 --> 00:46:08,457
But, it would have been
better if it was Radha.

462
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:14,217
What can be done?
She is not ready for it in any way.

463
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:16,417
That's the entire trouble.

464
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:50,457
The coming Thursday is my wedding.

465
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,377
I thought a lot whether
I should write to you or not.

466
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,737
Should I try to contact
you again or not?

467
00:46:56,217 --> 00:46:58,097
But, there is no other option.

468
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:01,257
My parents were saying that
they would go to invite you too.

469
00:47:02,577 --> 00:47:03,777
They think that..

470
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:07,937
..I need to take your
best wishes for this.

471
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:13,617
Their opinion is not wrong,
but I am feeling guilty to do this.

472
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:18,177
I've always taken from others, I never
thought of giving anything in return.

473
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:22,697
I don't know why the same thing
is coming to my mind again and again.

474
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:26,097
My parents wish that
I go personally to inform you.

475
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:28,377
But, I am scared to do this mistake.

476
00:47:28,937 --> 00:47:32,897
And, the reason behind it..
who knows that better than you?

477
00:47:33,657 --> 00:47:37,377
I feel that you will
definitely come to my wedding.

478
00:47:38,617 --> 00:47:43,577
Radha, there was no mistake
from your side. You must come.

479
00:47:45,177 --> 00:47:46,297
Debashish.

480
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:56,977
I got your letter.

481
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:14,697
Dear Debashish Babu.. your letter..

482
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:17,577
Your letter.

483
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,697
Respected sir.

484
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:40,537
I got your letter.
May your new life be good.

485
00:48:41,817 --> 00:48:44,817
How do I come though I wish to?

486
00:48:45,577 --> 00:48:49,257
Please trust me.. this coming
Thursday.. is quite impossible.

487
00:48:50,897 --> 00:48:55,937
I shall pray for your
well being and happiness.

488
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:10,817
Radha.. Radha Sister.

489
00:51:50,137 --> 00:51:52,577
Now, won't you tell me,
what is the matter?

490
00:51:53,857 --> 00:51:55,337
After that, you will tell me..

491
00:51:56,057 --> 00:52:00,177
'God.. you are blushing so much.'

492
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:07,177
After that, 'are you going
to give away everything and go?'

493
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:11,217
Then you will say,
'tell me, sister Radha?'

494
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:18,457
And, I will just say.. The day when
I'll have to give away all my savings.

495
00:52:18,897 --> 00:52:22,457
Let that day come.
I will hold 'Sanchayita'..

496
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:25,177
..tight to my chest and without
telling a single word will fly away.

497
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:28,057
Hey, Radha..
Muktan da has called you immediately.

498
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:35,537
Don't you even know what a great task
is writing a book like Sanchayita.

499
00:52:47,857 --> 00:52:51,537
Here, she is.. please come.
You are going away so soon?

500
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:54,649
Yes, he has some work.
- Oh!

501
00:52:55,497 --> 00:52:58,617
Look, we cannot resist
to see this girl.

502
00:53:01,897 --> 00:53:06,457
Debashish told me today
that I gave birth to him..

503
00:53:07,057 --> 00:53:08,817
..but Radha has given him a new life.

504
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:11,817
He is right.

505
00:53:12,377 --> 00:53:14,457
Hurry up, I'm getting late.

506
00:53:15,457 --> 00:53:17,937
Debashish would have
said this matter to you.

507
00:53:18,897 --> 00:53:21,737
But, I can't just resist
from saying this to you, myself.

508
00:53:23,337 --> 00:53:24,257
What is it, mother?

509
00:53:24,977 --> 00:53:26,657
The girl, for whom he cried so much..

510
00:53:26,977 --> 00:53:29,137
..our Debashish's wedding
has been fixed with her itself.

511
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:33,497
Wedding.. of Debashish?

512
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:37,417
Yes.  They no longer have
the objections that they had earlier.

513
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:40,377
Are you done?
I won't be able to wait any more.

514
00:53:41,457 --> 00:53:42,977
Ok. Bye, daughter.

515
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:42,737
"This night is yours and mine.."

516
00:54:42,937 --> 00:54:47,857
"Let it become yours and mine.."

517
00:54:48,177 --> 00:54:57,817
"Just the both of us..
let this song beautify this night.."

518
00:54:58,817 --> 00:55:08,377
"..and spread all over..
and, become an epic."

519
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:13,537
"This night is yours and mine.."

520
00:55:24,857 --> 00:55:29,817
"You and I are on different banks.."

521
00:55:30,057 --> 00:55:34,657
"I want to reach out to you anyhow.."

522
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:41,497
"I want to reach out to you anyhow.."

523
00:55:42,057 --> 00:55:46,537
"Just the both of us alone.."

524
00:55:47,337 --> 00:55:52,617
"This night is yours and mine.."

525
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:57,657
"Let it become yours and mine.."

526
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:01,977
"Just the both of us alone.."

527
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:38,297
Aparna Di.. shall I ask you something?

528
00:56:38,657 --> 00:56:39,977
Yes, tell me.

529
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:44,017
I wanted a holiday in the
evening today.. for a special cause.

530
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:47,297
You will go for your special work..

531
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:49,977
..and, who will do
the work of managing here?

532
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,097
I will go only after
finishing all my work.

533
00:56:52,657 --> 00:56:55,217
If there is any need even after that,
I shall instruct Uma and go.

534
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:58,937
You are doing just whatever
is there in your mind now days.

535
00:56:59,577 --> 00:57:01,497
Then, why are you
asking me about this?

536
00:57:01,737 --> 00:57:03,417
Do whatever you feel is right.

537
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:18,377
The case of Tapas Choudhury
is heading towards the worst side.

538
00:57:19,097 --> 00:57:20,657
Hope you might have heard about it.

539
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,897
It seems that the guy
won't survive any much further.

540
00:57:29,817 --> 00:57:31,577
When you had been abroad
during the last time..

541
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:34,977
..you had told me before going that..

542
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:38,257
..your only duty would
be service to mankind.

543
00:57:41,017 --> 00:57:44,177
There was something special
in those words of yours on that day..

544
00:57:45,817 --> 00:57:47,817
..that I couldn't
forget them even today.

545
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:56,857
Would this fellow come
to an end just like...

546
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:59,017
..this itself after having come to us?

547
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:03,377
Sir.. you don't embarrass
me by talking about this topic again.

548
00:58:05,297 --> 00:58:10,017
I never thought of
telling no to any work.

549
00:58:12,057 --> 00:58:17,137
But.. please forgive me for today.

550
00:58:29,097 --> 00:58:33,777
Do you know, Radha..
during the war on those days..

551
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:46,857
The condition at the Off...
field hospital was worse.

552
00:58:47,177 --> 00:58:49,297
No medicines.. no first aids..

553
00:58:49,857 --> 00:58:52,577
..no space also.. and,
to add to the despair, no convoys too.

554
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:58,857
Outside the camp, I could
hear the screams of my own people.

555
00:58:59,817 --> 00:59:04,537
Then, I saw another man lying
unconscious and badly injured.

556
00:59:05,577 --> 00:59:10,337
And, a nurse..
somewhat of your age only..

557
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:13,937
..removed all the clothes
of her own body and covered him.

558
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:17,737
And kept lying holding
him tight to her...

559
00:59:17,817 --> 00:59:19,897
..self in this shivering cold night.

560
00:59:20,697 --> 00:59:24,497
On seeing me, she just asked,
'can you give me a blanket?'

561
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:27,777
I thought what could
be worse than this.

562
00:59:36,057 --> 00:59:37,497
The next day, he died.

563
00:59:42,177 --> 00:59:47,697
I went to that sister and asked her
whether he was any relative of hers.

564
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:49,617
'Any relation of yours?'

565
00:59:51,897 --> 00:59:54,337
'He was just one of our boys.'

566
01:00:03,657 --> 01:00:05,577
He was just one of us.

567
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,697
Today also,
those words echo in my ears.

568
01:00:11,657 --> 01:00:16,017
Since then I always believe that..

569
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:23,417
..no one will leave this
world with complaint against women.

570
01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:31,242
Sister.. whose duty is
it at the female ward now?

571
01:00:31,922 --> 01:00:34,922
At the female ward.. Renu Di.

572
01:00:35,282 --> 01:00:38,082
Renu Di... Ask Renu di to go
there and look at the condition there.

573
01:00:38,362 --> 01:00:39,562
Go soon.

574
01:00:44,082 --> 01:00:45,242
I won't spare you today.

575
01:00:45,522 --> 01:00:46,730
I won't leave you.

576
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,482
What are you doing?
Leave me.. leave me.

577
01:01:19,202 --> 01:01:22,282
Look.. what have you done?

578
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:27,602
Do you like to beat some one?

579
01:01:29,762 --> 01:01:30,762
Hit me.

580
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:34,402
Hit me.

581
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:37,802
Hit me..

582
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:44,682
Not you..
not you. She was sent by Sulekha.

583
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,482
They can't come here.

584
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:49,962
I won't let anyone come here.

585
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:55,082
None of them will come here.

586
01:01:58,522 --> 01:02:02,162
I won't let anyone come here.

587
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:16,122
Sir.
- Yes.

588
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:22,442
What happened? Come.. come.. now.

589
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:25,202
Whatever you have to say, say it fast.
I don't have time.

590
01:02:29,482 --> 01:02:34,202
Would you..
give me the case of Tapas Babu?

591
01:02:34,762 --> 01:02:36,162
Radha..

592
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,042
Please proceed.

593
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,322
Listen..
- Me?

594
01:03:22,202 --> 01:03:25,442
Is Mitro Babu there?
- Mitro.. Mitro da..

595
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:29,002
Shall I go?
- Yes.

596
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:40,842
You?

597
01:03:40,922 --> 01:03:44,082
I am coming from the hospital.
My name is Radha Sister.

598
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:49,042
Oh! Please come.. sit.. sit.

599
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:53,202
Please come.. sit.. sit.

600
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:55,922
How is Tapas Babu?

601
01:03:56,082 --> 01:04:00,002
Good. I have come to you to enquire
certain things about Tapas Babu.

602
01:04:00,082 --> 01:04:02,882
Well.. well, good.
Please sit.. sit.. sit.

603
01:04:10,122 --> 01:04:14,802
Look at this. All these
letters are of that girl. Look.

604
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:19,482
It seems as if it is an ocean of love.

605
01:04:19,962 --> 01:04:22,282
Even after writing these
kinds of letters, if any girl can..

606
01:04:22,482 --> 01:04:25,202
Okay.. if you don't
have any objection..

607
01:04:25,282 --> 01:04:26,562
..I am taking away all these letters.

608
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:30,002
Yes.. yes, you may take them.
What will I do with them?

609
01:04:30,082 --> 01:04:33,762
I used to write to my wife,
copying some good words..

610
01:04:33,962 --> 01:04:35,682
..from those letters.

611
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:38,802
I don't know anything.

612
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,282
Anyway, I don't need it any more.

613
01:04:40,362 --> 01:04:41,842
Doesn't Tapas babu have any relatives?

614
01:04:42,362 --> 01:04:44,482
His parents are no more.
Rest everyone is there.

615
01:04:45,522 --> 01:04:47,762
They are financially very good too.
A very huge house.

616
01:04:48,602 --> 01:04:50,602
But, no one enquires about him.

617
01:04:50,882 --> 01:04:53,762
Tapas.. used to write
poems and novels.

618
01:04:54,202 --> 01:04:55,682
He used to write pretty well.

619
01:04:55,842 --> 01:04:57,562
Their brothers didn't like it.

620
01:04:57,882 --> 01:05:00,682
He had a fight with his
brothers regarding this matter..

621
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:04,122
..and he just came off here taking
just those letters from his properties.

622
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:06,482
After that..?

623
01:05:06,562 --> 01:05:08,082
What else after that?

624
01:05:08,162 --> 01:05:10,522
Whatever was remaining
that girl destroyed it all.

625
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:13,922
Seeing Tapas at such
a worse condition..

626
01:05:14,362 --> 01:05:17,082
..ocean of her love got
dried up once and for all.

627
01:05:17,442 --> 01:05:20,282
She insulted him and
threw him out of her house.

628
01:05:20,602 --> 01:05:23,202
He behaved very rudely that night.

629
01:05:23,522 --> 01:05:26,482
As soon as he entered, he started
with the topic of that record.

630
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:28,402
Record?

631
01:05:28,602 --> 01:05:31,722
Don't ask me..
that girl used to sing and all.

632
01:05:32,122 --> 01:05:35,562
If you want to sing, then do.. but...
she recorded a song written by Tapas.

633
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:40,842
Then, after that..
with that song.. day and night..

634
01:05:40,922 --> 01:05:46,242
..dawn and evening.. he used
to just play them and tear my eardrum.

635
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:49,882
Then, he used to come
and whisper into my ears..

636
01:05:50,082 --> 01:05:53,602
Sulekha is this..
Sulekha is that.. Sulekha is such.

637
01:05:53,722 --> 01:05:55,602
Now, tell me.. how is Sulekha?

638
01:05:56,082 --> 01:06:01,162
That.. here.. look at this.

639
01:06:02,882 --> 01:06:05,722
What is the condition of this record.

640
01:06:08,202 --> 01:06:09,682
Do you know which song was it?

641
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:16,442
The song was like... no more
emotions.. something like that.

642
01:06:20,082 --> 01:06:23,682
Ok.. tell me do you know
anything about Tapas' mother?

643
01:06:23,922 --> 01:06:26,282
About his mother.
Means.. though I have not seen her...

644
01:06:26,522 --> 01:06:29,522
.. he used to tell a lot about
his mother, he used to like her a lot.

645
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:32,882
One day he and myself,
were going somewhere..

646
01:06:33,442 --> 01:06:36,682
.. suddenly after seeing
one lady he stood there and said ..

647
01:06:36,762 --> 01:06:41,362
.. see how beautiful that lady is,
she is looking like my mother..

648
01:06:41,802 --> 01:06:45,082
.. my mother also used
to wear sari with a red border.

649
01:07:36,442 --> 01:07:37,562
Do you know to sing?

650
01:07:38,762 --> 01:07:39,722
No.

651
01:07:41,962 --> 01:07:43,642
So, do you mean to say,
you don't know to sing?

652
01:07:46,002 --> 01:07:47,802
No, but I love to listen songs.

653
01:07:49,642 --> 01:07:50,642
Everyone loves them.

654
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:02,762
But not all the songs..

655
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:10,962
..perhaps two three songs have left..

656
01:08:13,162 --> 01:08:14,842
..an impression on my heart.

657
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:23,762
One of the song I
listen very regularly.

658
01:08:25,922 --> 01:08:30,642
I won't be able to forget
that song ever in my life.

659
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:37,762
'Today, there are no more emotions.'

660
01:08:47,482 --> 01:08:51,322
'My heart got lost
somewhere for some reason.'

661
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:57,922
'I know that.. I won't get
it back even if I try to find it.'

662
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,482
Where have you listened to this song?

663
01:09:02,762 --> 01:09:04,882
Why? In one of the records.

664
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:07,682
Do you know whose song is this?

665
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:09,282
Yours.

666
01:09:11,922 --> 01:09:14,882
That is why I keep thinking
looking at your face..

667
01:09:15,322 --> 01:09:17,242
..as to how you write such good songs.

668
01:09:18,642 --> 01:09:19,962
Did you like it?

669
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:29,962
If at all I get such thoughts
and good things in mind..

670
01:09:30,522 --> 01:09:32,802
..even I could write such good songs.

671
01:09:34,522 --> 01:09:36,682
Do you remember the words after that?

672
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:38,242
After which?

673
01:09:38,522 --> 01:09:43,642
That one..
'I don't know.. I don't know that..'

674
01:09:44,562 --> 01:09:45,722
Those words.

675
01:09:46,722 --> 01:09:48,162
In the far distance..

676
01:09:50,442 --> 01:09:52,042
In the far distance..

677
01:09:53,202 --> 01:09:57,042
In the far distance..
- "The birds call me."

678
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:05,402
"The birds call me."

679
01:10:09,642 --> 01:10:14,042
"There was so much pain in the heart."

680
01:10:14,762 --> 01:10:19,242
"I am missing it so much."

681
01:10:19,602 --> 01:10:24,442
"There was so much pain in the heart."

682
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:28,482
"I am missing it so much."

683
01:10:29,562 --> 01:10:33,602
"Why don't you sing that song again?"

684
01:10:33,802 --> 01:10:39,202
"I want to hear your
melodious voice again."

685
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:44,282
"I won't have any other pain.."

686
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:49,282
"..if my heart gets lost
somewhere without any reason.."

687
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:54,162
"I don't know if I
will get see you again.."

688
01:10:54,362 --> 01:10:59,402
"I don't want anything else."

689
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:04,882
That's it.

690
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:10,882
Do you know..
I have just got a plot in my mind.

691
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:15,562
Plot?
- Can you give me some papers and a pen?

692
01:11:17,522 --> 01:11:20,402
I.. I will write another novel.

693
01:11:21,802 --> 01:11:25,762
Would.. you write it.. really? I shall
get you papers and a pen right away.

694
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,282
If you..

695
01:11:30,562 --> 01:11:33,082
Why? What happened?

696
01:11:33,442 --> 01:11:35,282
No..no. I can't.

697
01:11:35,562 --> 01:11:36,642
Why?

698
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:41,162
Why can't you?

699
01:11:45,082 --> 01:11:47,842
I know the beginning of the story...

700
01:11:51,162 --> 01:11:52,642
But, I don't know the ending.

701
01:11:54,642 --> 01:12:01,002
Tapas Babu.. I know the end. You just
start and I shall tell the ending.

702
01:12:02,202 --> 01:12:03,962
Wait. I will get everything.

703
01:12:30,122 --> 01:12:31,522
God..

704
01:12:32,922 --> 01:12:34,442
..what have you scribbled?

705
01:12:38,322 --> 01:12:41,362
What is this? What happened?

706
01:12:50,362 --> 01:12:51,642
Nothing.

707
01:12:51,842 --> 01:12:53,522
I can see it very clearly
that there is something wrong.

708
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,202
And, you are saying, 'nothing'.

709
01:12:59,282 --> 01:13:01,802
Nothing can be done with me now.

710
01:13:03,242 --> 01:13:04,682
Everything is over now.

711
01:13:04,762 --> 01:13:08,122
Is it? Who told you?

712
01:13:14,282 --> 01:13:19,802
'You were about to give me
all credits, but did you ever know..'

713
01:13:21,162 --> 01:13:23,362
'..that there are many
things incomplete in me too.'

714
01:13:24,802 --> 01:13:26,242
'There are a lot of things left.'

715
01:13:28,162 --> 01:13:30,642
Okay, now tell me..
who had written this?

716
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,082
Myself.
- Come on!

717
01:13:38,282 --> 01:13:41,682
I am in no way able to write anything.

718
01:13:44,682 --> 01:13:48,522
People who can.. are in a sorrow
that they aren't able to write...

719
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:50,762
In a struggle to write even better.

720
01:13:51,362 --> 01:13:54,402
But, how will it
do if you don't write?

721
01:13:54,482 --> 01:13:55,522
You will have to write.. at any cost.

722
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:59,922
You will have to.
Or else, yourself and myself..

723
01:14:00,162 --> 01:14:02,482
..won't we look small
in comparison with Sulekha?

724
01:14:35,482 --> 01:14:39,282
Remove your clothes and throw them.
Can't you listen if I say just once?

725
01:14:43,682 --> 01:14:46,002
What is this? Why did you stop?

726
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:48,402
I am telling you to.. remove them.

727
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:13,442
Look.. what a picture,
the entire women have.

728
01:15:28,762 --> 01:15:31,362
Don't look at me. Look somewhere else.

729
01:15:36,402 --> 01:15:38,242
I am telling you..
look somewhere else.

730
01:15:47,762 --> 01:15:50,442
Staring at me like this..
you won't be able to cheat me anymore.

731
01:15:53,202 --> 01:15:56,642
Why don't you understand that..
I just hate you.

732
01:15:57,682 --> 01:15:59,762
Not you.. but, me.

733
01:15:59,962 --> 01:16:02,922
Yes, I shall catch hold of
you and throw you out this time.

734
01:16:04,642 --> 01:16:07,322
I know that Sulekha will come one day.

735
01:16:08,482 --> 01:16:10,362
She will have to come for sure.

736
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:14,642
And, that day.. that day..

737
01:16:21,362 --> 01:16:24,682
..in this manner..
in this manner.. I will kill you.

738
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,682
Come.. please come to have your food.

739
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:39,242
Who is that..?

740
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,682
Where is she?

741
01:16:48,842 --> 01:16:49,962
Who? Radha Sister.

742
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:51,602
Yes.. yes.

743
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:55,282
She has gone to
Sulekha sister's house.

744
01:17:36,762 --> 01:17:41,442
"Today, there are no more emotions.."

745
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:46,842
"My heart got lost
somewhere for some reason."

746
01:17:46,922 --> 01:17:51,842
"I know that.. I won't get
it back even if I try to find it."

747
01:17:52,082 --> 01:17:56,802
"Today, there are no more emotions.."

748
01:17:57,002 --> 01:18:01,962
"My heart got lost
somewhere for some reason."

749
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:06,962
"I know that.. I won't get
it back even if I try to find it."

750
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:11,602
"Today, there are no more emotions."

751
01:18:17,082 --> 01:18:21,362
"The black-bees will hum the music."

752
01:18:22,242 --> 01:18:26,682
"..in that music..
my heart will forget everything."

753
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:31,842
"The black-bees will hum the music."

754
01:18:32,282 --> 01:18:36,442
"..in that music..
my heart will forget everything."

755
01:18:37,242 --> 01:18:46,922
"But, I still won't go away..
leaving your world."

756
01:18:47,162 --> 01:18:51,482
"Today, there are no more emotions.."

757
01:18:52,002 --> 01:18:57,002
"My heart got lost
somewhere for some reason."

758
01:18:57,202 --> 01:19:01,962
"I know that.. I won't get
it back even if I try to find it."

759
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:06,522
"Today, there are no more emotions.."

760
01:19:06,922 --> 01:19:11,162
"I don't know anything."

761
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:21,122
"I don't know..
I just don't know that."

762
01:19:21,482 --> 01:19:28,962
"I don't know when
you called me last time."

763
01:19:34,522 --> 01:19:39,162
"Do you know how many
stories arouse in my soul?"

764
01:19:39,522 --> 01:19:43,922
"How much did you like them?"

765
01:19:44,482 --> 01:19:49,202
"Do you know how many
stories arouse in my soul?"

766
01:19:49,522 --> 01:19:53,682
"How much did you like them?"

767
01:19:54,282 --> 01:19:58,442
"There are some dreams in my eyes."

768
01:19:58,722 --> 01:20:04,002
"I won't let this moment pass by."

769
01:20:04,322 --> 01:20:08,842
"Today, there are no more emotions.."

770
01:20:09,202 --> 01:20:14,122
"My heart got lost
somewhere for some reason."

771
01:20:14,322 --> 01:20:18,882
"I know that.. I won't get
it back even if I try to find it."

772
01:20:18,962 --> 01:20:23,882
"Today, there are no more emotions.."

773
01:20:29,522 --> 01:20:30,642
You?

774
01:20:31,082 --> 01:20:34,122
Greetings! My name is Radha.

775
01:20:34,802 --> 01:20:36,202
I am a nurse.

776
01:20:36,522 --> 01:20:39,042
I came to meet you with
regard to a special reason.

777
01:20:39,242 --> 01:20:42,002
No.. meet me..?

778
01:20:45,682 --> 01:20:47,242
Tell me.. what is it regarding?

779
01:20:48,202 --> 01:20:52,682
Nothing as such. I just wanted
your co-operation regarding a patient.

780
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:54,402
I can't get you.

781
01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:58,122
Do you know Tapas Choudhury?

782
01:21:00,162 --> 01:21:01,962
He is suffering from mental illness.

783
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:04,122
He has been at our hospital
for a few days now.

784
01:21:04,602 --> 01:21:09,082
I can't understand.. what is
the meaning of telling all this to me?

785
01:21:09,242 --> 01:21:13,842
Means.. you can help us a lot in
treating him so that he can be cured.

786
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:18,642
And, you will have to do this.

787
01:21:18,722 --> 01:21:19,882
How is that?

788
01:21:20,762 --> 01:21:24,042
You will have to come
with me to the hospital once.

789
01:21:24,802 --> 01:21:26,042
Me?
- Yes.

790
01:21:26,282 --> 01:21:27,482
What's the reason?

791
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:33,442
The reason? The reason
is that Tapas Babu thinks that..

792
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:36,162
..you had thrown
him out of your house.

793
01:21:37,082 --> 01:21:39,282
He got frustrated because of that.

794
01:21:40,282 --> 01:21:43,002
If you go.. he will scream
at you and abuse you, a lot.

795
01:21:43,082 --> 01:21:47,282
He will throw you out from there
thinking that the hospital is his house.

796
01:21:48,722 --> 01:21:50,602
You will have to bear
that and come back calmly.

797
01:21:51,802 --> 01:21:55,322
Today.. you will have
to do this much favor.

798
01:21:56,402 --> 01:21:58,682
I am surprised to hear all this.

799
01:21:58,922 --> 01:22:00,682
Do you know at whose house
are you sitting and saying all this?

800
01:22:00,762 --> 01:22:03,762
Yes, I know.
Rai Bahadur N.C. Banerjee's house.

801
01:22:04,682 --> 01:22:07,442
I am forcing you to go with me..
just because I know that.

802
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:12,722
Now, you may leave. And,
don't dare to come here ever again.

803
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:17,442
I won't come here in the future..
only if you come with me.

804
01:22:17,522 --> 01:22:21,882
No.. no.. no.. I won't go. Please,
for heaven's sake, you go from here.

805
01:22:22,762 --> 01:22:25,842
Listen.. I am not asking you
to do this for the sake of Tapas Babu.

806
01:22:27,522 --> 01:22:29,282
But, it is for your welfare itself.

807
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:30,762
For my welfare?

808
01:22:31,882 --> 01:22:36,122
Do you know these letters?
These are written by you.

809
01:22:39,602 --> 01:22:45,882
'Tapas.. wherever you may go and stay..
you will always find me near you.'

810
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:49,042
You have written..

811
01:22:49,642 --> 01:22:51,962
'Why do you repeatedly question me?

812
01:22:52,242 --> 01:22:55,682
'Don't you know that if I don't get you,
my life would become meaningless.'

813
01:22:57,882 --> 01:22:59,402
You have written even more.

814
01:23:00,202 --> 01:23:05,842
'I am feeling scared.. I feel
as if a star would fall from the sky.'

815
01:23:07,522 --> 01:23:11,002
'An auspicious day.. no one would be
at home in the afternoon. Come once.'

816
01:23:11,082 --> 01:23:13,442
Have you come here to blackmail me?

817
01:23:15,562 --> 01:23:18,882
I am requesting you. You come.

818
01:23:20,002 --> 01:23:21,962
I shall reach you
back after eight hours.

819
01:23:49,882 --> 01:23:51,322
Who?

820
01:23:55,122 --> 01:23:56,122
Who is that?

821
01:23:58,802 --> 01:24:00,322
Who is that?

822
01:24:11,482 --> 01:24:12,402
Who are you?

823
01:24:12,762 --> 01:24:14,562
Why? Don't you recognize me?

824
01:24:16,922 --> 01:24:18,242
Has Sulekha sent you?

825
01:24:18,522 --> 01:24:20,882
No. I am Sulekha myself.

826
01:24:30,002 --> 01:24:34,602
Nurse.. leave me..
leave me.. leave me.

827
01:24:35,122 --> 01:24:36,202
What are you doing? Move.. move.

828
01:24:36,282 --> 01:24:37,762
I will kill her.. I will kill her.

829
01:24:37,842 --> 01:24:41,042
Yes.. now, just sleep. Sleep.
- No.. no.

830
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:42,282
Tapas babu..

831
01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:49,522
Just go to sleep.

832
01:24:53,442 --> 01:24:54,802
Can I use the phone, please?

833
01:25:05,282 --> 01:25:07,362
Who is that?
Hari? Yes, this is Sulekha calling.

834
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,962
You come here soon.
I am in a very big trouble.

835
01:25:10,442 --> 01:25:13,682
Yes.. yes I'm at the mental asylum.

836
01:25:14,082 --> 01:25:15,282
Please come here immediately.

837
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:24,402
Get up.

838
01:26:15,122 --> 01:26:16,442
Who are these people?

839
01:26:16,762 --> 01:26:17,962
Is she that nurse?

840
01:26:18,762 --> 01:26:20,802
Do you know that we can
hand over you to the police too?

841
01:26:25,002 --> 01:26:28,882
Hold this.
I shall dial the number for you.

842
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:43,362
Sulekha Devi couldn't trust
anyone among the three of you.

843
01:26:44,082 --> 01:26:48,122
She has given this news
of conspiracy to three people.

844
01:26:50,162 --> 01:26:57,082
But everyone knows
people like Sulekha Devi.

845
01:26:59,442 --> 01:27:03,042
One man is there..
in cabin number 24..

846
01:27:04,562 --> 01:27:06,802
We'll have to extend
that bed very soon.

847
01:27:08,602 --> 01:27:12,522
If you want space over there,
do give an application earlier itself.

848
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:16,362
Because, we have taken the
responsibility of rising him..

849
01:27:16,602 --> 01:27:21,242
..from that stage
of madness to your level.

850
01:27:21,602 --> 01:27:23,602
Then, what more do
you have to worry about?

851
01:27:23,962 --> 01:27:28,642
Giving some one poison
and poisoning some one's mind..

852
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:31,282
..is the same crime.

853
01:27:32,202 --> 01:27:35,482
You took away all the
happiness of a person..

854
01:27:35,562 --> 01:27:38,042
..and threw him in that gutter.

855
01:27:40,002 --> 01:27:43,762
And, that we will give him. Why?

856
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:51,202
Your letters.

857
01:27:55,162 --> 01:27:58,842
I will be grateful to you..
for having come today.

858
01:28:03,042 --> 01:28:04,362
Bye.

859
01:28:49,882 --> 01:28:52,882
Radha Di..
doctor has called you immediately.

860
01:28:53,242 --> 01:28:55,802
Why? - They are taking Tapas Babu
for giving him shock treatment.

861
01:28:56,962 --> 01:28:58,482
Shock treatment for Tapas Babu?

862
01:28:58,562 --> 01:29:00,602
He is creating chaos over there.

863
01:29:03,602 --> 01:29:06,442
Impossible.
- No.. no.

864
01:29:06,882 --> 01:29:08,162
No.

865
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:22,242
Please.. stop it..

866
01:29:26,682 --> 01:29:27,522
Remove this.

867
01:29:27,882 --> 01:29:30,682
Please save me..
please save me. I will die.

868
01:29:30,842 --> 01:29:34,482
I am really sorry, doctor. I shall
give this responsibility to you, later

869
01:29:38,202 --> 01:29:40,842
Get up.. get up.

870
01:29:43,722 --> 01:29:46,162
Now, there is nothing to worry.
Come on.

871
01:29:47,722 --> 01:29:49,882
Come, let's go home. Get up.

872
01:29:54,042 --> 01:29:55,042
Come.

873
01:29:55,122 --> 01:29:59,082
But, I heard that Sulekha
went in a half dead state from here.

874
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:04,522
Well.. our responsibility
is to cure a sick person.

875
01:30:06,042 --> 01:30:08,642
And, I have tried to do only that.

876
01:30:08,722 --> 01:30:13,322
But, you can't risk a healthy
person's life for that sake.

877
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:15,402
Don't you have any
social responsibilities?

878
01:30:16,242 --> 01:30:18,162
You don't have any
complaint against them..

879
01:30:19,682 --> 01:30:21,402
..who are damaging the society itself.

880
01:30:22,402 --> 01:30:24,602
Because you are into practice.

881
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:29,082
You need sick people.
But we don't want that.

882
01:30:29,522 --> 01:30:30,842
We have some responsibilities.

883
01:30:31,082 --> 01:30:35,202
Our complaint is against
them who spread this disease.

884
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:39,451
They will spread the disease
and we will have to pay for that?

885
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:43,811
I am sorry.

886
01:30:49,411 --> 01:30:50,971
You had only said this, sir..

887
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:55,371
..that we'll have to wipe off the image
of that girl from the patient's mind.

888
01:30:56,091 --> 01:31:00,251
Day by day, whatever I could
understand on observing Tapas Babu..

889
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:05,531
..his desire to meet that girl.
I did just what he desired.

890
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:11,411
But.. I heard that you insulted Dr.
Ghosh regarding the matter..

891
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:14,651
..of giving him electric shock.

892
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:17,451
He has mistook it for an insult.

893
01:31:18,531 --> 01:31:21,491
In your absence,
there was no other option, sir.

894
01:31:21,971 --> 01:31:23,091
I see.

895
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:28,331
But, you could have even made
him understood in a softer manner.

896
01:31:29,011 --> 01:31:30,571
There was no time for that.

897
01:31:31,891 --> 01:31:35,371
Besides that, a fruit had just grown.

898
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:39,571
Tapas Babu's trust on
me was much more important.

899
01:31:41,491 --> 01:31:43,531
I can give you a word today..

900
01:31:44,531 --> 01:31:46,971
..that this experiment of
yours also would be successful.

901
01:31:47,811 --> 01:31:50,811
I knew that, Radha.. I knew that.

902
01:31:58,811 --> 01:32:00,611
Now.. try to go to sleep.

903
01:32:00,691 --> 01:32:02,211
It is very late in the night.

904
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:04,491
Or else, you will fall ill again.

905
01:32:13,371 --> 01:32:17,451
Good night!
- Radha.. you don't go away.

906
01:32:19,051 --> 01:32:21,131
Great.. shouldn't I sleep?

907
01:32:21,211 --> 01:32:24,131
No.. no. If you go away,
they will take me again.

908
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:30,291
Okay. You sleep and I am here itself.

909
01:33:39,891 --> 01:33:43,731
'Debashish.. hey, Debashish.'

910
01:33:46,891 --> 01:33:48,291
'Shall I go now?'

911
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:55,891
'Why? You sleep like a good boy
now and I shall also go and sleep.'

912
01:33:55,971 --> 01:33:58,171
'No.. no, Radha.'

913
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:00,811
I feel very scared.

914
01:34:01,131 --> 01:34:03,091
'You don't go leaving me alone.'

915
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:08,531
'No.. no.. Debashish. I won't
go leaving you alone ever after.'

916
01:34:08,611 --> 01:34:10,451
'I won't go anywhere.. Debashish.'

917
01:34:11,691 --> 01:34:12,691
'Debashish.'

918
01:34:14,331 --> 01:34:15,691
'Debashish.'

919
01:34:19,091 --> 01:34:21,971
Debashish.. Deba..

920
01:35:01,651 --> 01:35:02,731
How is that?

921
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:06,451
Good. It has turned
out to be very good indeed.

922
01:35:07,051 --> 01:35:09,171
Okay.. tell me what do
I do with this heroine now?

923
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:11,611
Should I tell you everything or what?

924
01:35:11,851 --> 01:35:14,571
Didn't you tell me that
you will tell me the end?

925
01:35:15,011 --> 01:35:17,571
Oh! Had I said that?

926
01:35:18,411 --> 01:35:21,611
The heroine.. what is her name?

927
01:35:21,691 --> 01:35:23,051
Reena.
- Reena.

928
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:26,611
Reena.. Reena will fall in love?

929
01:35:27,051 --> 01:35:29,891
Will start loving.
I don't want that ending.

930
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:33,891
Will the union take place if you wish?

931
01:35:34,851 --> 01:35:36,011
What do you mean?

932
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:37,971
I want to say that..

933
01:35:40,411 --> 01:35:42,091
..the lovers won't unite again.

934
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:49,291
Because.. no one will
come to know of her love story.

935
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:55,891
What more..
not even the person whom she loved.

936
01:35:56,531 --> 01:35:58,411
If she loved, then..
why would he not know of it?

937
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:03,011
Why wouldn't he know if she loved him?

938
01:36:07,891 --> 01:36:12,611
He wouldn't know that she loved him..
because..

939
01:36:15,011 --> 01:36:17,611
..Radha will never
let him know any day.

940
01:36:18,691 --> 01:36:20,171
Radha!

941
01:36:20,491 --> 01:36:28,491
No..no. Reena..
Reena. You.. I shall come soon.

942
01:36:42,211 --> 01:36:43,291
Radha!

943
01:36:46,731 --> 01:36:48,931
You said it right, doctor..
you said it right.

944
01:36:49,931 --> 01:36:52,011
Tapas Choudhury is
recovering very speedily.

945
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:55,731
What? His pulse is normal
and we have taken all other tests.

946
01:36:55,811 --> 01:36:57,691
Yes.. Radha once again.

947
01:36:58,171 --> 01:36:59,851
Yes. She's the real heroine.

948
01:37:13,011 --> 01:37:16,091
"This night is yours and mine.."

949
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:26,571
"This moon is yours and mine.."

950
01:37:26,651 --> 01:37:29,051
"Just the both of us.."

951
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:40,491
"This night is just for that song."

952
01:37:47,651 --> 01:37:51,371
"This song..
this will take away my life."

953
01:37:51,851 --> 01:38:02,131
"Just the both of us..
this night is yours and mine."

954
01:38:19,131 --> 01:38:20,331
Greetings.
- Greetings.

955
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:24,331
How come you are here at this hour?

956
01:38:24,411 --> 01:38:27,051
I am like this only..
I come at this time only.

957
01:38:27,331 --> 01:38:29,131
But.. this is not the visiting hour.

958
01:38:29,411 --> 01:38:32,091
But, I come at any time..
isn't your doctor there?

959
01:38:32,171 --> 01:38:36,851
The senior doctor..? He had told me that
I can come at any time to meet Tapas.

960
01:38:37,971 --> 01:38:39,291
Then, what?

961
01:38:39,371 --> 01:38:41,251
You just need to come
here once and go away.

962
01:38:41,851 --> 01:38:42,851
You heard it.

963
01:38:45,811 --> 01:38:51,091
Then it's sufficient to meet you.

964
01:38:51,891 --> 01:38:53,891
Bye.. bye.

965
01:39:01,011 --> 01:39:02,891
Here.. Pradip Keshto.

966
01:39:03,131 --> 01:39:08,771
Mitroda.. come.. come. Please sit.

967
01:39:09,891 --> 01:39:11,571
How are you?
- Fine.

968
01:39:11,851 --> 01:39:13,251
Are you really fine?
- Yes, really fine.

969
01:39:13,451 --> 01:39:15,171
How are you? I am fine too.

970
01:39:15,411 --> 01:39:19,211
You seem to have become absolutely
all right. I am very glad.

971
01:39:19,571 --> 01:39:23,051
But, beware..

972
01:39:23,331 --> 01:39:25,891
..don't ever dare to fall
into this love matter and all again.

973
01:39:26,051 --> 01:39:29,851
No.. no.. no. No laughing.. and all.

974
01:39:30,251 --> 01:39:31,771
Is that a man's job?

975
01:39:32,371 --> 01:39:39,931
First of all work hard and after
you settle down you can marry someone.

976
01:39:40,011 --> 01:39:42,251
Mitroda.. someone will listen.

977
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:45,451
Then, won't people listen
the sound of your laughter?

978
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:46,891
Someone will hear if I laugh?

979
01:39:47,171 --> 01:39:51,171
The way you made every one cry..
don't they know anything?

980
01:39:52,891 --> 01:39:54,851
I am very happy to see you like this.

981
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:57,131
Okay.. let me take your leave now.

982
01:39:57,211 --> 01:39:59,091
Mitroda.
- Who is that?

983
01:39:59,371 --> 01:40:00,691
Come.. come.. come.

984
01:40:00,891 --> 01:40:02,331
Today, as it is Saturday..
I was going home so..

985
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:04,211
..I just thought of
meeting him before I go.

986
01:40:06,491 --> 01:40:08,411
You have done a very good thing.

987
01:40:09,531 --> 01:40:11,451
Okay, Tapas.. let me take your leave.

988
01:40:16,691 --> 01:40:18,211
Have your medicine.

989
01:40:20,451 --> 01:40:22,971
What happened? Take your medicine.

990
01:40:28,091 --> 01:40:29,451
Are you angry or what?

991
01:40:30,811 --> 01:40:31,931
No.

992
01:40:33,011 --> 01:40:34,971
Then, why aren't
you taking the medicine?

993
01:40:35,451 --> 01:40:38,891
My wish.
- Your wish?

994
01:40:40,131 --> 01:40:41,571
Where were you till now?

995
01:40:43,131 --> 01:40:45,691
Don't I have any other patients?

996
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:49,211
Okay, then.. just keep it there.

997
01:40:50,771 --> 01:40:52,651
Good lord!
- Wait.

998
01:40:53,331 --> 01:40:54,411
I am telling you to keep it.

999
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:07,651
You spoiled the entire
mood by getting angry.

1000
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:13,491
I had thought of giving you good news.
Not anymore.

1001
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:14,771
Good news..?

1002
01:41:20,891 --> 01:41:22,491
What good news?

1003
01:41:36,891 --> 01:41:39,851
Colonel has said that we
can go out from tomorrow onwards.

1004
01:41:44,211 --> 01:41:45,451
Really?

1005
01:41:46,651 --> 01:41:51,051
Radha.. where shall we go out, Radha?

1006
01:41:53,811 --> 01:41:57,811
Radha.. What happened, Radha?

1007
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:03,291
Radha.. tell me where shall we go?

1008
01:42:05,331 --> 01:42:09,611
Today.. should I give
the answer for that too?

1009
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:08,211
'Radha.. Radha..
hey, what are you thinking about?'

1010
01:44:10,571 --> 01:44:12,051
'Nothing.'

1011
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:17,011
'Do you know Radha.'

1012
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:28,691
I will never leave you.
I will always be there with you.

1013
01:44:29,171 --> 01:44:34,891
'Debashish..
please, Debashish.. don't say that.'

1014
01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:40,931
Tapas Babu.

1015
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:58,531
It is too late. Go to sleep.

1016
01:45:00,131 --> 01:45:01,691
I don't feel like sleeping.

1017
01:45:04,651 --> 01:45:07,931
You sit here, I'll go to sleep.

1018
01:45:08,171 --> 01:45:11,971
I feel that..
the time I shall spend sleeping..

1019
01:45:12,371 --> 01:45:14,051
..will be wasted.

1020
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,531
Even if you don't sleep
your time will be wasted.

1021
01:45:20,971 --> 01:45:22,491
Sleep now.

1022
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:23,971
Okay, Radha.

1023
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:24,891
What happened, now?

1024
01:45:24,971 --> 01:45:27,811
Why do you talk to me
addressing me as a stranger?

1025
01:45:31,211 --> 01:45:32,491
Oh! That.

1026
01:45:34,291 --> 01:45:37,811
I never thought of it.

1027
01:45:41,611 --> 01:45:46,011
You never asked me to address
you with your name any day.

1028
01:45:46,971 --> 01:45:48,811
Should I have said that?

1029
01:45:51,451 --> 01:45:53,611
Did you tell that to me?

1030
01:45:54,371 --> 01:45:57,211
As if you don't need
to be taught about anything.

1031
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:00,371
You are going away
after a few more days.

1032
01:46:02,251 --> 01:46:04,131
What will you do after
going out from here?

1033
01:46:08,731 --> 01:46:10,411
Tell me.

1034
01:46:19,051 --> 01:46:20,571
Tell me.

1035
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:34,811
I have asked Mitroda to
look out a small house for me.

1036
01:46:36,611 --> 01:46:39,451
And, my solicitor has made
all the arrangements regarding the..

1037
01:46:39,531 --> 01:46:41,731
..partition of the property also.

1038
01:46:42,851 --> 01:46:45,851
I can see that you have
grown quite intelligent.

1039
01:46:47,611 --> 01:46:49,171
Won't I become?

1040
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:59,531
It is said that the goddess
of wealth should be handled carefully.

1041
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:04,051
Tell me something.

1042
01:47:09,251 --> 01:47:11,251
Tell something.

1043
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:17,611
Will you listen to what I say?

1044
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:23,731
Of course, I will. Tell me.

1045
01:47:27,931 --> 01:47:29,571
Go to sleep.

1046
01:47:37,611 --> 01:47:39,211
Okay.

1047
01:48:02,011 --> 01:48:04,051
Good night, Radha.

1048
01:48:04,731 --> 01:48:06,331
Good night.

1049
01:48:31,651 --> 01:48:35,291
I want to see you tomorrow morning.

1050
01:49:31,171 --> 01:49:35,891
Yes! Radha..
come.. come, my dear.. come.. come.

1051
01:49:36,131 --> 01:49:38,131
I was just thinking of calling you.

1052
01:49:38,411 --> 01:49:41,251
Look.. what a news is lying here?

1053
01:49:41,451 --> 01:49:45,851
A telegram..
he has mentioned your name specially..

1054
01:49:48,451 --> 01:49:49,731
What happened?

1055
01:49:49,811 --> 01:49:52,691
You seem to be too much exhausted.

1056
01:49:53,731 --> 01:49:55,531
Nothing.

1057
01:49:56,291 --> 01:49:59,411
No.. no..
no. You are looking definitely tired.

1058
01:49:59,491 --> 01:50:01,531
Your mind also seems to be tired.

1059
01:50:02,091 --> 01:50:06,531
Do one thing. You take a leave of few
days and go for an outing somewhere.

1060
01:50:06,771 --> 01:50:08,011
Go wherever you feel like going.

1061
01:50:08,091 --> 01:50:09,811
Just inform wherever
you would like to go.

1062
01:50:09,891 --> 01:50:13,251
I will make the required
arrangements. You go.

1063
01:50:13,971 --> 01:50:16,371
I had a request, sir.

1064
01:50:16,451 --> 01:50:20,091
Request? You just give me the order.

1065
01:50:20,851 --> 01:50:21,811
Tell me, what do you want?

1066
01:50:21,891 --> 01:50:26,691
Tapas babu.. would be discharged
within two three days itself, isn't it?

1067
01:50:28,451 --> 01:50:35,411
I don't want to meet him.
Not even before he leaves.

1068
01:50:38,251 --> 01:50:42,251
If anyone else would have said this,
I would have asked why.

1069
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:44,851
But, I won't ask you that question.

1070
01:50:45,091 --> 01:50:48,411
It is fine. Now, I shall give
the finishing touch myself and..

1071
01:50:48,651 --> 01:50:50,851
..take all the credit for myself.
What do you say?

1072
01:50:57,891 --> 01:50:59,411
God Bless her!

1073
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:02,051
No.. no.. I am telling
you not to clean my room.

1074
01:51:02,371 --> 01:51:04,891
Why isn't Radha coming here?
Go, find out and come.

1075
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:06,931
Go.

1076
01:51:12,051 --> 01:51:15,251
Nurse, can you tell me
where Radha sister has gone?

1077
01:51:15,571 --> 01:51:19,051
She has gone out.
Colonel has sent her out.

1078
01:51:19,131 --> 01:51:21,131
Colonel has sent her out?

1079
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,211
Radha went away without informing me.

1080
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:34,211
Are you sure?
- Why not?

1081
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:36,171
We..

1082
01:51:39,851 --> 01:51:41,691
Where is Colonel?
- Who is that?

1083
01:51:42,451 --> 01:51:45,771
Oh! Tapas Babu.. come on.. come on.

1084
01:51:46,171 --> 01:51:48,931
You are looking very healthy..
in the pink of health.

1085
01:51:49,011 --> 01:51:50,611
Thank you.
- I am very glad to see.

1086
01:51:50,691 --> 01:51:52,931
What else?
Hope you don't have any inconvenience.

1087
01:51:53,011 --> 01:51:55,091
You are hundred percent fit?
- Absolutely, sir.

1088
01:51:55,331 --> 01:51:57,251
That is very good news, indeed.

1089
01:51:57,931 --> 01:51:59,411
Excuse me.

1090
01:52:01,811 --> 01:52:04,291
Okay.. am I going tomorrow itself?

1091
01:52:04,571 --> 01:52:06,451
Yes. Why?

1092
01:52:06,971 --> 01:52:12,251
Where is Radha? I have not
been seeing her from a few days.

1093
01:52:14,691 --> 01:52:16,891
She has gone on a special mission.

1094
01:52:19,451 --> 01:52:23,371
Okay.. it is none of my concern.
I was here for these many days.

1095
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:29,411
She has some important work.

1096
01:52:30,931 --> 01:52:33,091
She may come after 8-10 days.

1097
01:52:33,691 --> 01:52:35,731
Ok. I'm in no hurry.

1098
01:52:36,091 --> 01:52:38,771
I was here for a long time.
It's a matter of just 8-10 days.

1099
01:52:39,651 --> 01:52:42,451
Besides that,
I liked this place a lot.

1100
01:52:42,931 --> 01:52:44,251
Then, I take your leave.

1101
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:46,771
Listen.

1102
01:52:53,011 --> 01:52:55,531
I had thought that I
won't tell this matter to you.

1103
01:52:56,531 --> 01:52:58,811
But, I now feel that
I should tell you.

1104
01:53:00,451 --> 01:53:01,931
Radha is here itself.

1105
01:53:02,531 --> 01:53:06,171
She hasn't gone anywhere.
But, due to some special reason..

1106
01:53:06,811 --> 01:53:09,291
..she doesn't wish
to meet you anymore.

1107
01:53:11,731 --> 01:53:13,011
Radha is here itself.

1108
01:53:15,811 --> 01:53:17,211
And, she doesn't wish to meet me?

1109
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:18,411
No.

1110
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:25,971
Tapas Babu..
I certainly owe you, an explanation.

1111
01:53:27,811 --> 01:53:32,971
Whatever relation you
had with Radha till now..

1112
01:53:34,171 --> 01:53:39,691
..that was just an important
part of our treatment.

1113
01:53:41,011 --> 01:53:45,811
And, thank god.. through this medium,
you have become fit too.

1114
01:53:50,131 --> 01:53:52,771
You might have mistaken it as love.

1115
01:53:53,531 --> 01:53:57,971
And, I wanted the same too.
But, this wasn't love.

1116
01:53:59,731 --> 01:54:02,531
That was..
in our language.. play acting.

1117
01:54:03,251 --> 01:54:04,371
Just acting.

1118
01:54:04,451 --> 01:54:06,931
Acting? Impossible.

1119
01:54:07,171 --> 01:54:10,531
If it was impossible, then, you
wouldn't have been recovered today.

1120
01:54:14,531 --> 01:54:16,491
But, she was just acting with me..

1121
01:54:17,611 --> 01:54:18,811
..I can't believe this.

1122
01:54:19,211 --> 01:54:20,491
You just call her once.

1123
01:54:21,211 --> 01:54:24,571
I want to hear once from
her itself that it was all acting.

1124
01:54:25,771 --> 01:54:28,811
Let her say that looking into my eyes.

1125
01:54:29,011 --> 01:54:31,011
That is not possible, Tapas Babu.

1126
01:54:32,411 --> 01:54:34,171
You are sad hearing about
this matter of play acting.

1127
01:54:34,251 --> 01:54:35,851
I can understand that.

1128
01:54:36,691 --> 01:54:40,131
But, you will forget that
sorrow just after two days itself.

1129
01:54:40,851 --> 01:54:43,371
But, the service mentality
of the girls here..

1130
01:54:44,251 --> 01:54:47,891
..the discipline and concentration..

1131
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:50,411
..will certainly remain in your mind.

1132
01:54:52,171 --> 01:54:56,411
If you go and meet her now,
she will get disturbed.

1133
01:54:57,851 --> 01:54:59,771
Whatever favor she has done to you..

1134
01:55:00,491 --> 01:55:03,251
..that was certainly not a sin.

1135
01:55:03,531 --> 01:55:04,531
Where is Radha?

1136
01:55:04,611 --> 01:55:06,131
Definitely, at her home.

1137
01:55:06,731 --> 01:55:08,091
Stop him. Don't allow him.

1138
01:55:08,331 --> 01:55:10,011
Tapas Babu.. Tapas Babu.

1139
01:55:11,651 --> 01:55:13,771
Tapas Babu.. Tapas Babu.

1140
01:55:18,251 --> 01:55:22,331
Radha.. Radha..
open the door.. just once.

1141
01:55:22,411 --> 01:55:25,531
You look at me once and say that you
were acting with me for so many days.

1142
01:55:25,691 --> 01:55:28,411
Radha.. Radha.. I won't be
able to forget you forever in my life.

1143
01:55:28,491 --> 01:55:30,011
Radha.. look at my
face and tell me just once.

1144
01:55:30,091 --> 01:55:33,531
Radha.. I promise you..
that I won't disappoint you any day.

1145
01:55:33,611 --> 01:55:34,571
Tapas babu..

1146
01:55:35,091 --> 01:55:36,971
Radha.. at least,
let me meet you once before I leave.

1147
01:55:37,051 --> 01:55:41,251
Radha.. meet me, Radha.
I promise you that I won't leave you.

1148
01:55:41,571 --> 01:55:44,091
Radha, listen.. Radha.

1149
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:46,731
I won't disappoint you.

1150
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:19,931
Dipten..
how did I do such a big mistake?

1151
01:56:21,451 --> 01:56:25,211
For these many days..
I treated Radha just as a Nurse.

1152
01:56:26,451 --> 01:56:31,491
I didn't see the girl in her..
not even once.

1153
01:56:31,731 --> 01:56:33,051
Twenty two..

1154
01:56:40,011 --> 01:56:41,411
Number..

1155
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,171
Twenty three.

1156
01:56:53,291 --> 01:56:54,411
Number.

1157
01:58:20,171 --> 01:58:21,331
Radha!

1158
01:58:48,971 --> 01:58:50,451
You trust me..

1159
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:54,171
I.. I wasn't just really acting.

1160
01:58:55,131 --> 01:58:57,691
I.. I was never acting..
even for a single day.

1161
01:58:58,571 --> 01:59:03,171
I.. I can't do acting..

1162
01:59:03,411 --> 01:59:06,651
Just can't act.. just can't act.

1163
01:59:08,571 --> 01:59:10,211
Radha!

1164
01:59:13,411 --> 01:59:14,651
Radha!

1165
01:59:18,011 --> 01:59:19,171
Radha!

1166
01:59:26,771 --> 01:59:27,851
Radha!

1167
01:59:29,771 --> 01:59:31,091
Radha!

1168
01:59:59,451 --> 02:00:00,291
Radha!
