1
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,833
Bhasha.

2
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,958
You've received a great compliment!

3
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:48,833
Kalyan.

4
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,458
Today's income is 152,000 rupees.

5
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,791
That's... the highest so far, Uncle.

6
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,708
Yes.

7
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,375
Our entire staff gets ten percent bonus.

8
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,333
It's a burden to employ them.

9
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,833
And then you announce a bonus.

10
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,166
-Uncle!
-Why stick to ten percent?

11
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,125
Give them the whole share. Go ahead.

12
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,791
Do you know Abraham Lincoln?

13
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,083
Of course.
He's the protagonist in Avatar.

14
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,333
He has a tail as well.

15
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,833
You know everything, Uncle.

16
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,416
What did Abraham Lincoln say?

17
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,333
What did he say?

18
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,083
Did he ask you to announce
a bonus for everyone?

19
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,541
No, Uncle.

20
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,500
"Success is not about individual growth.

21
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,333
It's about the collective growth
of people around us."

22
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,625
He's a Hollywood hero after all.
He must be right.

23
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,208
It's okay. Let's give a bonus.
Take a bonus, guys. Enjoy!

24
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,833
-Thanks, Uncle!
-Thanks, Uncle!

25
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,708
Having the unhygienic food
at your restaurant...

26
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,916
many customers have been falling sick.
We've received a complaint.

27
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,958
So, I'm here to seize your restaurant.

28
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,000
It's true that the restaurant stinks.

29
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,708
But, I think it's your perfume.

30
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,416
You must've bought it in Koti secretively.

31
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
Stop being dramatic and sit, Anu.

32
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,083
Jhansi, is it?

33
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,375
Idiot! You caught me once again.

34
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,000
You shouldn't just change your voice.

35
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,208
You should change your stinking
perfume as well.

36
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,750
You've written an article on me
in your magazine, didn't you?

37
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,375
How did you know?

38
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,875
You made me sit the other day
and asked silly questions.

39
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,000
I knew it back then.

40
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,916
God, you're out of this world!

41
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,708
Do you know the content as well?

42
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,291
I do. But, you must've put in
a lot of effort into it.

43
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,083
Read it for me. I'll listen for you.

44
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,875
Let me read.

45
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,291
Put that magazine aside.
I'll read it in detail later.

46
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,208
Are you promoting me because
I'm your best friend?

47
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,250
Or because I'm the best cook out there?

48
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,583
I'm promoting you because my
best friend is the best cook.

49
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,916
Kalyan.

50
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,625
-Uncle.
-Take the keys.

51
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,541
So, shall we go?

52
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,875
Anu!

53
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,791
-Oh, yes.
-You enjoy these, don't you?

54
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,166
I forgot. Okay, then.
I'll leave.

55
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,958
One more peg.

56
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,916
Hey!
No more pegs, sweetheart.

57
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,666
If I drink every day,
my liver will give up.

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,583
Come on! Don't talk
when you don't know the facts.

59
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,833
What's the brand you drink?
Golden Touch.

60
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,083
-So, what?
-18 years old Single Malt.

61
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,083
It'll not affect your liver.

62
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,666
-It will not? Fine.
-No.

63
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,666
-Just have your drink.
-Sure, I will.

64
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,750
I did it.

65
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,875
If your dad is awake, send him here.

66
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,916
-He'll have a peg and go.
-Go to heaven, you mean.

67
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,083
-I'll tell him, Aunty. Good night.
-Good night, dear.

68
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,041
Dear, what do you think about Anu?

69
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,875
I think she shouldn't be drinking.

70
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,958
-I didn't mean that.
-Then?

71
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,458
Wouldn't it be great if Anu became
our daughter-in-law?

72
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:43,500
Why would any parent get their
daughter married to a blind man?

73
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,833
Stop it! My son is precious.

74
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,166
He's a gem.

75
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,583
Let's talk to her father once.

76
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,583
Hibili will be here by tomorrow anyways.

77
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,708
Who's that?

78
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,083
Your research!

79
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,375
I don't think it would be nice to talk
to him while we're drunk.

80
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,208
If we ask him casually, he'll act coy.

81
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,958
He'll open up after few pegs.

82
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,458
Invite him over.

83
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,000
You're the first lady who
executes plans using alcohol.

84
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,708
You're being too sweet, Siva.

85
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,625
<span style="style.default_1">Twenty.</span>

86
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,833
Twenty one.

87
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,625
Twenty two.

88
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,666
Twenty three.

89
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,583
Thank God! I finished it.

90
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,708
What?

91
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,958
Not dry fruits, push-ups.

92
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,375
Dad.

93
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,333
-Stop showing off and start exercising.
-You found out?

94
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,791
You can fool me but not my son.

95
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,000
Take it.

96
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,125
What?

97
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,958
Ask him.

98
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,541
-You ask him.
-Dad.

99
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,000
Mom is sighing at you.
Look what it is.

100
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,958
I don't want to sigh anymore.
I'll directly come to the point.

101
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,708
-It's about your marriage.
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes.</span>

102
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,708
-I'm ready to get married, Mom.
-Thank God!

103
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,000
He finally agreed.

104
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,750
I heard Alia Bhatt recently
broke up with Ranbir.

105
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,041
You and dad go to Mumbai
right away and talk to her.

106
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,416
I'll marry her blindly.

107
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,416
Blindly.

108
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,250
We were thinking of Anu and
he is talking about Alia Bhatt.

109
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,875
He wants Alia Bhatt today.

110
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,791
He would want Pooja Bhatt tomorrow.

111
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,250
Mahesh Bhatt will come to us soon
and smack the both of us.

112
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,625
How are the vitals?

113
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,375
Okay. Talk to the anesthesiologist
about the PSC clearance.

114
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,541
-What's for breakfast?
<span style="style.default_1">-Dosa.</span>

115
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,125
<span style="style.default_1">Dosa.</span>

116
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,291
Are you writing another article
about Kalyan?

117
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,791
No. I'm writing his biography.

118
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,708
Do you have a problem?

119
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,125
You're not kids anymore
to behave like this.

120
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,875
You better stay in your limits.

121
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,250
I'll marry only him.

122
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,416
-Are you forgetting that he is blind?
-He might not be able to see.

123
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,500
But, I'm confident that
he'll take good care of me.

124
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,625
Dad...

125
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,250
will you talk to his parents
about our marriage...

126
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,291
or shall I proceed?

127
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,166
Why don't you say something?

128
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,708
Proud? For what?

129
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,958
We've known Kalyan since he was a kid.

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,208
He might be blind but he stood up
for himself,

131
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,375
running a successful restaurant.

132
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,000
Most importantly, Anu loves Kalyan.

133
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,500
What else can we ask for?

134
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,208
Hidimbi is amazing, man.

135
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,791
It's not Hidimbi. It's Hibili.

136
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,500
Hibili?

137
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,625
No more for me.
I've got a surgery tomorrow. Please.

138
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,000
Surgeries are an everyday thing.
Have one more peg.

139
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,791
We have something important
to talk to you about.

140
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
Is it? Tell me, dear.

141
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,791
Tell him!

142
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,500
We were thinking of Kalyan's marriage.

143
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,791
Yeah. My son has appeared in all
the papers and magazines recently.

144
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,583
We've been receiving way too many
alliances for him. Tell him, dear.

145
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,625
Come on! I get him drunk so that
he tells the truth.

146
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,041
But, he's been lying.

147
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,125
Listen, we aren't looking for any
alliances for my son.

148
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,958
You two have been friends for long.

149
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,916
Anu and Kalyan also have been
childhood buddies.

150
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,166
-We think we should get them married.
-It's our opinion.

151
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,291
Only if you don't have any objection.

152
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,166
I was hesitating to...

153
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,125
ask you about this.

154
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,333
You have only approached me.

155
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:04,708
Anu had already told me that
she'll marry Kalyan only.

156
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,666
Thank God!

157
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:11,750
I have no objection
for this marriage, dear.

158
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,041
On this special occasion,
you have to drink Hibili.

159
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,333
Go ahead.

160
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,375
Have one more peg of Hibili. Come on.

161
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,458
-Cheers! Hibili!
-Cheers! Hibili!

162
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,625
Actually, the food isn't for me.

163
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,958
An old man on the footpath
was really hungry.

164
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,666
I promised to get food for him.

165
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,583
All the restaurants are closed.

166
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,375
I came here hoping to find some food.

167
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,750
Just a minute.

168
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:06,875
Please have a seat.

169
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:42,000
Sorry for troubling you.
I didn't know you were blind.

170
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,625
I'm also sorry.

171
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,083
-What for?
-I mean...

172
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,125
I didn't know you were a girl.

173
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,291
Why are you sorry for me being a girl?

174
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,291
Why are you sorry for me being blind?

175
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,458
Sorry for being sorry.

176
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,708
The old man will be happy
if you give him the food.

177
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,750
I'll close the restaurant and come.

178
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,708
Here.

179
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,375
Give it.

180
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,166
Here you go, Grandpa.

181
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,375
He made it freshly for you.

182
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,791
God bless you, son!

183
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,666
Bye, Grandpa.

184
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,625
Bye, son.

185
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,291
That's my cue to leave.

186
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,458
Thank you.

187
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,958
I should thank you.

188
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't know the joy of
giving until now.

189
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,541
I realized it the first time I gave
something to someone.

190
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,458
I'm working as a salesgirl
at the nearby mall.

191
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,291
I know.

192
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,750
Did you... put your hand forward?

193
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,791
Vennela.

194
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,833
Kalyan.

195
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,375
Do you want me to
drop you somewhere?

196
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,250
No, thanks. I know this
area down to an inch.

197
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,750
<span style="style.default_1">This road is closed.</span>

198
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:47,833
Yes, Sir.

199
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,208
Sir, you're Chef Kalyan,
am I right?

200
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,583
Yes, I am.

201
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,833
I've seen your photo in
a magazine recently.

202
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,833
If you don't mind, can we click
a selfie with you? Please.

203
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,291
Hey, guys. Come.

204
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,500
Come fast, man!

205
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,208
Thanks, bro.

206
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,041
Just a minute.

207
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,541
Can you give us your bag?

208
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,583
You posed when we asked for a selfie.

209
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,375
Why are you shocked when
we asked for your bag?

210
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,875
We've blocked this road for you.

211
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,166
You better give us the bag and get lost.

212
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,708
It's the money 20 men
have toiled in a day for.

213
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,125
Why should I give it to you, brother?

214
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,500
There's ten of us.

215
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,750
If we beat you,
you'll be dead in ten minutes.

216
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,708
What's so funny?

217
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,750
No. There's only seven of you.

218
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,333
Hey! Take his bag.

219
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,083
Hey! Take his bag! Take it!

220
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,458
Brother, he's not blind.

221
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,125
He's got eyes all over his body, brother.

222
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,458
Brother, he can see everything.
Let's run.

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,958
You should've just given them
the bag, Kalyan.

224
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,291
Did you have to fight them?
You know you're...

225
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,125
Hey! Why didn't you file a
police complaint on them?

226
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,666
As it's useless to call the cops,
he called for an ambulance directly.

227
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,750
Yeah, right. As if your son is a hero.

228
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,583
Yes. My son is a hero indeed.

229
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,500
Why should he give them the bag?

230
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,125
If he does that, he'd have to keep
giving things every day.

231
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,958
You're at fault as well.

232
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,750
Why did you hit them and call
for an ambulance?

233
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,208
You should've killed them
and sent them to a mortuary.

234
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,916
She's like Arjun Reddy's sister.

235
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,083
You are defending him now
because he's safe.

236
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,166
How did you know it was me?

237
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,166
Sorry.

238
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,291
What for?

239
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,583
I forgot to pay you yesterday.

240
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,208
I'm here to clear the bill.

241
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,208
You're really selfish.

242
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,500
-Why do you say that?
-You know.

243
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,208
You want to grab all the luck
for the good deed.

244
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,708
Why don't you give me some as well?

245
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,541
Nothing like that.

246
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,416
Will we find people who would take
these food packets?

247
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,416
Here, we need to go looking for luck.
Not for hunger.

248
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,208
Grandpa, take it.

249
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,000
Partners in good deeds, I mean.

250
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,333
Did you think it was a
partnership in my restaurant?

251
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,166
<span style="style.default_1">Vennela</span>

252
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,041
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, Vennela</span>

253
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,750
<span style="style.default_1">You've accompanied me like my shadow</span>

254
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,666
<span style="style.default_1">I was never like this before</span>

255
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:08,375
<span style="style.default_1">I see a new side of me now</span>

256
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,541
<span style="style.default_1">Your tone moves my soul</span>

257
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,541
<span style="style.default_1">Your friendship is my boon</span>

258
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,166
<span style="style.default_1">Your presence is just magic</span>

259
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,625
<span style="style.default_1">Vennela</span>

260
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,541
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, Vennela</span>

261
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:32,416
<span style="style.default_1">You've accompanied me like my shadow</span>

262
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,458
<span style="style.default_1">I was never like this before</span>

263
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:42,125
<span style="style.default_1">I see a new side of me now</span>

264
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,666
I spoke to uncle.

265
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,333
They've agreed to your wedding.

266
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,625
A marriage can happen due
to any reason.

267
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,291
But, not out of sympathy.

268
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,291
Anu only has sympathy for me.

269
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,416
Mom.

270
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,875
Aren't you done with your
social service yet?

271
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,666
Come on, Dad!

272
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,500
My dad. His name is Tilak.

273
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,500
-He's a proof reader in a printing press.
-Greetings, Sir.

274
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,750
Hello, son.

275
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,458
-Listen.
-Sir.

276
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,791
Did she rub her madness on you?

277
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,708
If everyone had the same madness,
no one in the world would starve.

278
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,958
That's expected. Okay.

279
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,708
I'm going to the press. Bye.

280
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,333
Dear, take care.

281
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:32,500
<span style="style.default_1">Melting away the coyness</span>

282
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:37,458
<span style="style.default_1">A sweet bond has bind us</span>

283
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">It's unfamiliar and unasked for</span>

284
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:47,083
<span style="style.default_1">This feeling is a celebration of love</span>

285
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:51,916
<span style="style.default_1">In our imaginations,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I've looked for our origin</span>

286
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:56,666
<span style="style.default_1">As you appear,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The silence in me loses expression</span>

287
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,291
Please watch your step.

288
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,541
<span style="style.default_1">Vennela</span>

289
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,458
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, Vennela</span>

290
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:10,166
<span style="style.default_1">You've accompanied me like my shadow</span>

291
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,208
What the hell!
Your house is always locked.

292
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,041
Your dad doesn't answer my calls.

293
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,541
Don't you know about madam?

294
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,125
-If you don't pay up in two days--
-What will you do?

295
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,625
-Hey!
-Hey!

296
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,708
-Is that a threat?
-Calm down, Kalyan.

297
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,166
We'll pay you back.
Please leave.

298
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,083
-Who are they, Vennela?
-I'll get back to you.

299
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,875
Who is this ma'am?

300
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,916
They came for my dad. Let's go.

301
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,750
I'm out of gas. Leave!

302
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:47,333
<span style="style.default_1">The truth you are untold of</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let the world witness it now</span>

303
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,375
<span style="style.default_1">Let go of all the inhibitions</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let this magic fill our hearts</span>

304
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:57,250
<span style="style.default_1">Let our happiness stream</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let me claim your heart</span>

305
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,916
<span style="style.default_1">No matter where I am, I see myself in you</span>

306
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,666
<span style="style.default_1">I erase the thoughts of your absence</span>

307
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:16,750
<span style="style.default_1">Even in the deepest trials of darkness</span>

308
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:21,458
<span style="style.default_1">Your arrival brings luster to my path</span>

309
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:26,083
<span style="style.default_1">A second with you feels like a millennium</span>

310
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:32,541
<span style="style.default_1">Our tale is a mirror to beauty and joy</span>

311
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,791
<span style="style.default_1">Vennela</span>

312
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,583
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, Vennela</span>

313
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:44,500
<span style="style.default_1">You've accompanied me like my shadow</span>

314
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:49,125
<span style="style.default_1">Your tone moves my soul</span>

315
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:54,333
<span style="style.default_1">Your friendship is my boon</span>

316
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,291
<span style="style.default_1">Your presence is just magic</span>

317
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,125
<span style="style.default_1">Vennela</span>

318
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:11,750
Vennela...

319
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:13,958
I have to...

320
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,916
I have something to tell you.

321
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,583
Tell me.

322
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:28,125
Shall we meet at the
restaurant tomorrow?

323
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:28,083
I don't know how to tell you this.

324
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,708
I don't even know if I
should be telling you this.

325
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,916
But when you're by my side...

326
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,791
I forget that I'm flawed.

327
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,041
In fact...

328
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:42,875
every second you're with me,
my life is so colorful.

329
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:55,000
I feel life's great with
you in it, Vennela.

330
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,625
Only if you feel the same.

331
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:03,833
Vennela.

332
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,458
Have I said something wrong?

333
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:15,208
If you don't like me,
we can just be friends.

334
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,416
Kalyan, actually...

335
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm here to bid farewell to you.

336
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,916
We're leaving the city today.

337
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,166
Why, Vennela?

338
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:41,666
What happened?

339
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,666
I'll tell you.

340
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,291
We borrowed two million for
my dad's heart surgery.

341
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,541
We've been working hard for two years now

342
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:59,333
to clear the debt.

343
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,875
But we couldn't even afford
to pay the interest.

344
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,666
It's a call-money gang.

345
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,916
They've threatened us
quite a few times.

346
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,333
If we don't pay by tomorrow...

347
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,958
they said they'll take me away.

348
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,166
We have only two options right now.

349
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,750
One... commit suicide.

350
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,958
Two... flee from the city.

351
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,458
I had to let you know.

352
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,125
That is why I came.

353
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,750
You don't have to go anywhere, Vennela.

354
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,833
I'll give you the money.

355
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:16,875
Do you know when am I the happiest?

356
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,166
The time I spend with you.

357
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,375
I don't want you to get involved in this.

358
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:33,333
Not only in good deeds.
We can share our problems as well.

359
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,916
Vennela, consider it a loan.

360
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,750
Pay me back when you
have the money.

361
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,458
Allow me to do this for you.

362
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:17,041
Ask dad not to be worried.
Let's pay the money tomorrow.

363
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,083
There have been multiple fractures.
We performed surgery.

364
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,916
During the initial testing, we saw
Kalyan's retina respond to light.

365
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:45,583
Eye surgeon says there are 50-50 chances

366
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:48,458
of bringing his sight back.

367
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,458
If we are okay with it,
I think we should take a chance, man.

368
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,958
What more can we ask for if he were
to get his sight back?

369
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:56,708
What say, dear?

370
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:07,375
<span style="style.default_1">Due to deep sedation, it will take time</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for Kalyan to be conscious.</span>

371
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,916
<span style="style.default_1">We have only</span>
<span style="style.default_1">two options right now.</span>

372
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,125
<span style="style.default_1">One... commit suicide.</span>

373
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:43,333
<span style="style.default_1">Two... flee from the city.</span>

374
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,083
You'll be fine, Vennela.

375
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,125
Kalyan.

376
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,666
-Kalyan.
-You'll be fine, Vennela.

377
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,000
He's trying to say something.

378
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,000
Please wait outside for
two minutes, Ma'am.

379
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:10,916
Nurse.

380
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:30,958
Come, Ma'am.

381
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,291
-Kalyan.
-Mom.

382
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,041
How are you, dear?

383
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,958
What happened to me, Mom?

384
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:39,375
You've been in an accident.
They performed surgery on you later.

385
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,791
-Accident?
-Yes.

386
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,375
How long has it been, Mom?

387
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,791
Three weeks, son.

388
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,791
-Three weeks?
-Yes.

389
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,041
Mom, call uncle and ask him to come.

390
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,541
-I'm right here.
-He is here.

391
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,083
Uncle...

392
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,666
has anyone named Vennela
come for me?

393
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,375
Vennela?

394
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,583
-No one with that name came for you.
-Who's Vennela?

395
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,416
I promised to help her, Dad.

396
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,666
Vennela.

397
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,041
Uncle... has an old man
come asking for me?

398
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,458
No one came asking for you, dear.

399
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,166
Mom, where's my phone?

400
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,125
-Dad.
-Dear.

401
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,125
-Give me my phone.
-Stop panicking.

402
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:15,208
They'll be taking your
bandage off today.

403
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,166
They're prepping the operation theater.

404
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,708
It'll hurt a bit.

405
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,458
Slowly.

406
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,208
It's okay.

407
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,500
-It's too bright, doctor.
-That's normal.

408
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:14,666
Mom.

409
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,208
Dear.

410
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,708
Kalyan.

411
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,291
-It's hurting a lot, Dad.
-You'll be fine, son.

412
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,250
This is Anu.

413
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,416
Anu.

414
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:35,625
Kalyan...

415
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:36,958
I'm your uncle.

416
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,666
Uncle.

417
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,375
You need to be really careful
a few weeks from now.

418
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,875
Use dark glasses under bright light
or when outdoors.

419
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:48,750
Careful.

420
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,625
Slowly.

421
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:56,666
This is our home.

422
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,166
<span style="style.default_1">The number you're trying to</span>
<span style="style.default_1">reach is out of service.</span>

423
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,041
Thanks, Uncle.

424
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:16,625
Come on, son.

425
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:18,958
Careful.

426
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,416
Take rest.

427
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,458
Grandpa...

428
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,125
how are you?

429
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:30,375
I'm good, son.

430
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,458
-A girl would come with me, remember?
-Yeah.

431
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,666
-Did she come here again?
-I haven't seen her, son.

432
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">I wonder where you are</span>

433
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:48,208
<span style="style.default_1">My soul is waiting for you</span>

434
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,708
<span style="style.default_1">I'm working as a salesgirl</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in a nearby mall.</span>

435
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,458
Is anyone named Vennela working here?

436
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,041
Vennela? There's nobody here
with that name.

437
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:59,541
<span style="style.default_1">I wonder where you are</span>

438
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:07,166
<span style="style.default_1">Your silence cloaks your words</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart is still paying heed</span>

439
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,708
<span style="style.default_1">Never have I made a mistake</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me what went wrong with us</span>

440
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,625
<span style="style.default_1">Is it fair of you to leave me behind?</span>

441
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,125
<span style="style.default_1">You lit the flames of love in my heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your glances make my eye go ablaze</span>

442
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:25,083
<span style="style.default_1">Death seems to take a toll on me</span>

443
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,166
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, beloved</span>

444
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,583
<span style="style.default_1">My dad. His name is Tilak.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He's a proof reader in a printing press.</span>

445
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,458
No one here goes by that name, Sir.

446
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,416
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, beloved</span>

447
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,291
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, beloved</span>

448
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,000
<span style="style.default_1">You've shattered all my hopes</span>

449
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,041
-You remember this photo?
-You ate half the cake for this birthday.

450
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,666
And you ate the rest.

451
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,750
<span style="style.default_1">Failing to endure the torture of debt,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a father and daughter commit suicide.</span>

452
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,125
<span style="style.default_1">Baburao from Nalgonda district and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">his nine year old daughter Swathi...</span>

453
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,541
<span style="style.default_1">consumed pesticides and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">committed suicide.</span>

454
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,958
<span style="style.default_1">I've asked God and all directions</span>

455
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,125
Why do you look so lost, son?
Eat your food.

456
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,041
Mom, please leave me alone.

457
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:11,666
<span style="style.default_1">I strolled the streets and groped the city</span>

458
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,416
<span style="style.default_1">There seem to be no traces of you</span>

459
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:22,125
<span style="style.default_1">I was blessed to be your shadow</span>

460
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,750
Anu! When did you come?

461
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,041
Been quite some time.

462
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,583
I didn't notice.

463
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,333
Shall we go?
Mom must be waiting for you.

464
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:35,958
<span style="style.default_1">When I don't get to see you</span>

465
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,333
<span style="style.default_1">This dreamy vision is worthless</span>

466
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,583
Sir, is there a salesgirl
named Vennela here?

467
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:44,708
Vennela.

468
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,291
Yes, Sir.

469
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,458
I'm Vennela.
You are?

470
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:57,458
I wonder where you are

471
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:01,583
<span style="style.default_1">My soul is waiting for you</span>

472
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,541
<span style="style.default_1">Your image is imbibed in my heart</span>

473
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:10,541
<span style="style.default_1">Never have I made a mistake</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me what went wrong with us</span>

474
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:14,458
<span style="style.default_1">Is it fair of you to leave me behind?</span>

475
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:19,000
<span style="style.default_1">You lit the flames of love in my heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your glances make my eye go ablaze</span>

476
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,750
<span style="style.default_1">Death seems to take a toll on me</span>

477
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,541
Where were you all night?

478
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,791
-Do you remember that--
-I fell asleep at the restaurant, Dad.

479
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,583
I was a bit tired.

480
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,750
You didn't answer any of our calls.

481
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,833
Do you know how worried we were?

482
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,250
She hasn't eaten anything all night.
She was crying for you.

483
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,250
Mom.

484
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,000
Mom.

485
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,000
Why are you crying, Mom?

486
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,791
Do you understand what you're doing?

487
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,250
You are ignoring your parents...

488
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:16,500
and searching for a girl like a madman.

489
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,250
How long will this go on?

490
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,916
How long do we have to weep like this?

491
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:25,708
Mom.

492
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:28,791
Don't cry.
Please, Mom.

493
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:31,458
What do you want me to do?

494
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,916
You have to marry Anu.

495
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Yes.

496
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,625
She wanted to marry you
when you were blind.

497
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:48,083
Did you ever think about her?

498
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:54,083
If you really want to see us happy...

499
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:58,250
you will have to marry Anu.

500
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,083
Say yes.

501
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,166
Okay, Mom.

502
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,666
Stop crying.

503
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,583
I'll marry her.

504
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,583
I knew you would.
You're my sweetheart.

505
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,875
I knew you would listen to me.
I'll tell your dad and come.

506
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,000
Dear.

507
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,166
Because your parents compelled you
or that I would feel bad...

508
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,958
don't say yes to this marriage.

509
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,958
I want to be your choice.

510
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,208
But not an obligation.

511
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:43,541
Anu.

512
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:21,625
<span style="style.default_1">What's happening to my heart?</span>

513
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:27,333
<span style="style.default_1">It's afloat like the</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Blue clouds in the sky</span>

514
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:32,916
<span style="style.default_1">What's happening to my soul?</span>

515
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:38,666
<span style="style.default_1">It sways like a honeybee</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In the floral showers</span>

516
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,708
<span style="style.default_1">I feel both anxious and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Tense at the same time</span>

517
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:50,166
<span style="style.default_1">As your glances caress me from across</span>

518
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:56,375
<span style="style.default_1">The cool breeze pokes me like a thorn</span>

519
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:00,000
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, girl</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't be so coy</span>

520
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:03,041
<span style="style.default_1">Behind your blushing cheeks</span>

521
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:08,625
<span style="style.default_1">There's a war in play</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your dreams manifest this moment</span>

522
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:11,625
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, girl</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't be so coy</span>

523
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:14,541
<span style="style.default_1">Behind your blushing cheeks</span>

524
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,416
<span style="style.default_1">There's a war in play</span>

525
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:20,500
<span style="style.default_1">Your dreams manifest this moment</span>

526
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:31,000
<span style="style.default_1">He is not a new friend to my heart</span>

527
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:42,500
<span style="style.default_1">But my heart plays a new melody</span>

528
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:48,416
<span style="style.default_1">I'm drowning in joy unaware of</span>

529
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:54,083
<span style="style.default_1">I flutter like a bee crazily in love</span>

530
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:58,833
<span style="style.default_1">As you join footsteps with me</span>

531
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,666
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, girl</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't be so coy</span>

532
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:06,541
<span style="style.default_1">Behind your blushing cheeks</span>

533
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,458
<span style="style.default_1">There's a war in play</span>

534
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,500
<span style="style.default_1">Your dreams manifest this moment</span>

535
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:22,958
<span style="style.default_1">What's happening to my heart?</span>

536
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:28,833
<span style="style.default_1">It's afloat like the</span>

537
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:34,541
<span style="style.default_1">What's happening to my soul?</span>

538
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:40,541
<span style="style.default_1">It sways like a honeybee</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In the floral showers</span>

539
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:47,291
<span style="style.default_1">I feel both anxious and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Tense at the same time</span>

540
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:52,083
<span style="style.default_1">As your glances caress me from across</span>

541
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,250
<span style="style.default_1">The cool breeze pokes me like a thorn</span>

542
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,666
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, girl</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't be so coy</span>

543
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:04,541
<span style="style.default_1">Behind your blushing cheeks</span>

544
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,375
<span style="style.default_1">There's a war in play</span>

545
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,541
<span style="style.default_1">Your dreams manifest this moment</span>

546
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,250
<span style="style.default_1">Let's all meet at Kalyan's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">engagement tomorrow.</span>

547
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,333
<span style="style.default_1">Okay. Done, Uncle.</span>

548
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:29,875
Good night, Uncle.

549
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,708
Lunch will be arranged there.

550
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,625
Dear.

551
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,125
Can you see now?

552
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,416
-Who are you?
-I'm Vennela's father.

553
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:00,166
Where were you?
Where's Vennela?

554
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:01,833
How is she?

555
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,500
We waited for you that day.

556
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,666
As you didn't turn up...

557
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:09,708
we were scared the call-money
gang would hurt us.

558
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,875
So we fled from the city.

559
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,541
We've escaped them for a month.

560
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,333
They caught us in Tirupati
few days ago.

561
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,375
They hurt me badly...

562
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,000
and took Vennela away.

563
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,458
If I don't pay 2.5 million by tomorrow...

564
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:28,833
they will kill my daughter.

565
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,000
They will kill my daughter.

566
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:35,333
You have to save my daughter somehow.

567
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,333
Don't worry.
Vennela will be fine.

568
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:39,500
Trust me, Uncle.

569
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,208
How will you do it?

570
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,666
I'll give the money.

571
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,833
Let's give them the money
and get Vennela back.

572
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,333
Come to Andhra Bank in
Filmnagar tomorrow.

573
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:50,833
Be there, Uncle.

574
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,291
Oh, God!

575
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,166
Where are you going?

576
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,208
Mom, something important has come up.
I'll be right back.

577
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,583
-Engagement is at 12. You remember, right?
-I know, Mom. I'll be there.

578
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,125
-Okay.
-Where is he going now?

579
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,416
He'll be back soon.

580
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,541
Uncle, did you call them?

581
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,041
-Yes, son.
-Come with me.

582
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:43,000
Tell them we're coming.

583
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,416
We're getting the money.
Where do we have to come?

584
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:01,208
Uncle, don't worry.

585
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:02,708
Vennela will be fine.

586
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,750
Drive faster, please.

587
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:13,166
We're here. We were
caught up at the bank.

588
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:15,958
Come, Uncle.

589
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,041
Vennela.

590
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,666
Don't hurt my daughter.

591
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,250
Old man! Stop right there.

592
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,958
-Did you bring the money?
-We did.

593
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,625
-Who is he?
-He only helped us with the money.

594
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,583
Hey! I'll shoot you if you move. Sit!

595
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,833
Here... I brought the money you asked for.

596
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,250
Don't hurt her.

597
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:00,875
Hey! Check the money.

598
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:07,666
Okay, brother.

599
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,583
You wouldn't bring the money unless
the gun is at point blank, right?

600
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,791
Hey, look!

601
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,833
Brother, the police are here.

602
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
-Bastard! You brought the police along?
-We didn't call them.

603
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,458
-Who else would call them?
-We didn't inform them. Believe us.

604
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,708
Don't try to fool us.

605
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,333
Uncle.

606
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:50,625
Hey, come!

607
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,500
Hey! If you tell the cops,
I'll shoot her.

608
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,166
I'll chop her up into pieces and
send you the parcel. Go!

609
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,708
Police are on the other side.
We'll go this way.

610
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:00,041
Come!

611
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,000
<span style="style.default_1">They've taken Vennela.</span>

612
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,791
Vennela!

613
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Vennela!

614
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:32,333
Where did you go?
Are you out of your mind?

615
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,666
No, Dad. Vennela's dad came to the
restaurant yesterday...

616
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,416
You've fooled your mom.

617
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,166
It's not his fault, Aunty.

618
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,541
It's entirely my fault.

619
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,833
Soon after opening your eyes
at the hospital...

620
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,083
when you asked about Vennela,
I should have understood.

621
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,208
It's completely my fault.

622
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:12,333
I'm just an obligation to you,

623
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,708
not a choice.
You have proved it.

624
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:52,666
<span style="style.default_1">The sensational Vijayawada call-money</span>
<span style="style.default_1">case is yet to reach a conclusion.</span>

625
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,041
Mom.

626
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,666
If you tell the cops, I'll shoot her.

627
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,833
They say there's too
much salt in it, boss.

628
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,083
Are you teaching me how to cook?

629
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:33,375
Who complained?

630
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,083
Ask them to get lost.

631
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,833
I don't need them.
I don't need you as well.

632
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
What are you talking about?

633
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:06,166
How can you shut the restaurant down?

634
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:07,583
I get it, Uncle.

635
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:09,791
I can't do it anymore.

636
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:13,625
I don't want to ruin all your lives.

637
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,916
You'll have your salaries
deposited in a week.

638
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:21,666
Listen to me.

639
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,541
Everything will be sorted
in a few days.

640
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,875
Try to understand, Uncle.

641
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:30,458
Please get going.

642
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:10,666
<span style="style.default_1">Due to an unidentified vehicle crash</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on Vizag Bheemili Road...</span>

649
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:33,291
Wait here for two minutes.

650
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:42,958
Hey, where are you going?

651
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:45,000
Dad, I'm going to Vizag
for some urgent work.

652
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:46,541
What's so urgent?
Won't you tell mom?

653
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:48,500
-I'll tell her later.
-Hey, Kalyan... Tulasi!

654
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:51,041
Hey, Kalyan!

655
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,250
Move.

656
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:54,583
Why are you shouting, dear?

657
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:55,958
He's going to Vizag it seems.

658
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,666
Why is he going to Vizag?

659
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,083
<span style="style.default_1">I saw him dying two weeks ago.</span>

660

661
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,625
<span style="style.default_1">Where is Vennela?</span>

662
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,375
-Let the bag be.
-Okay, Sir.

663
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,625
Sir, where's the emergency ward?

664
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,416
Go straight and turn right.

665
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:43,625
Tell me.

666
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,041
-Where's the emergency ward?
-No idea, Sir.

667
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,166
Sir, where is the emergency ward?

668
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:52,500
Go straight and take a right.

669
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,250
The old man who's been in an
accident on the Bheemili Road...

670
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:56,458
Do you know him?

671
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,375
-Yes, Sir.
-Come on.

672
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,416
He passed away around two last night.

673
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,125
Get a letter from the police station
and take his body.

674
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:40,791
They said they will kill my daughter.

675
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:17,916
<span style="style.default_1">Vennela’s father passed away.</span>

676
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:21,250
<span style="style.default_1">She has no one other than me.</span>

677
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,416
<span style="style.default_1">I should save her from</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the call-money gang.</span>

678
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,291
<span style="style.default_1">No matter what I've to do.</span>

679
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:37,916
Sir, can I meet the Inspector?

680
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,791
Sir is busy. Come tomorrow.

681
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:42,250
It is about a girl’s life.
Can I meet the Inspector?

682
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:44,416
I already told you that sir is busy.
You may leave.

683
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:48,208
Mr. Prasad! You are not
allowing the media as well.

684
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,208
Sir, are you from the media?

685
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:53,250
-You didn’t say that earlier.
-I am telling you, Mr. Prasad.

686
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:54,541
Come, brother.

687
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:56,041
Listen, brother.

688
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,875
Media can go anywhere.

689
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,041
The Inspector’s room is to the left.

690
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,291
Go and finish your work.

691
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,208
Thanks, brother.

692
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:05,500
Yeah. Tell me.

693
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,541
-The land beside the beach?
-Sir.

694
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,125
How much for a cent?

695
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:11,666
20?

696
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:15,416
Tell them I am a cop and
settle it for ten. Okay?

697
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:18,291
-Sir.
-The land is opposite to R.K. beach.

698
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:19,916
No sensible guy would lose it.

699
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:21,583
Who are you, by the way?

700
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,375
Sir! My name is Kalyan.

701
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:24,333
So what?

702
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:26,041
Recently, near Bheemili beach road…

703
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,333
How many acres do you have?

704
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,333
That’s not the thing. An elderly
man died in the hit-and-run case.

705
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:31,208
-How many acres does he have there?
-That’s not the matter, Sir.

706
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,333
Listen to me.

707
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,291
Yeah. Tell me.

708
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:34,916
That’s not an accident, Sir.
It's a murder.

709
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,583
Call-money gang is responsible
for this incident.

710
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,083
The dead man's daughter
is with them now.

711
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,708
You have to somehow
investigate this case...

712
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:42,041
and capture that gang.

713
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:43,791
Shall I tell you something?

714
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:46,791
I invest but I don’t investigate.

715
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:47,916
Understood?

716
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:52,333
Many people come to the police station
with such useless cases.

717
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:53,416
Sir, listen to me.

718
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,291
-You will know if you start investigating.
-Do you have any witness?

719
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:57,208
No.

720
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,833
Why are you wasting time?

721
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,041
Come to me with a land dispute case.

722
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:02,500
Both of us can get settled.

723
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:03,708
-That’s not the matter, Sir.
-Leave.

724
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:04,625
Let's go.

725
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,208
Sir, tea or coffee?

726
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:21,958
Tea.

727
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:02,666
Release my horse, Sir.

728
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:04,666
Release my horse, Sir.

729
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:07,833
Haven’t you seen the no-parking sign?

730
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,291
This is not a vehicle, Sir.

731
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:12,375
How did Kings ride back in the day?

732
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,375
They ride on horses.
But, that was back then.

733
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:17,791
Is it? What about hero Prabhas
in Baahubali movie?

734
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,291
-He rode a horse, Sir.
-So, isn't it a vehicle?

735
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:21,291
Pay a fine of 2000 rupees.

736
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:22,875
Sir, I don't have so much money.

737
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:26,583
You charged the inspector’s son 200 rupees
for a ride on your horse.

738
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:28,416
Sir, it was a mistake.
I will never charge you.

739
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,916
In case you charge me again,

740
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I will put a drunk and drive case
on you and put you behind bars.

741
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,250
-Take it away.
-Okay, Sir.

742
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,458
Bloody fool!

743
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:39,333
Hey, Chokka Rao! Inspector asked
about you earlier.

744
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:41,083
Convey my greetings. Go.

745
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,583
Damn life!

746
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:46,083
My mother won’t come out of
coma unless the Inspector dies.

747
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,500
-Give me tea.
-Okay, sir.

748
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,791
What’s the connection between Inspector
and your mother’s healing?

749
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,458
There’s a huge connection.

750
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,208
My mom wants me to become an Inspector.

751
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,458
I got a job as a constable.

752
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,208
I didn’t want her to get hurt.

753
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,541
So I lied about being an Inspector.

754
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,958
My mother found out the truth one day.

755
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,750
She got angry.

756
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:11,083
That’s when she slipped into coma.

757
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,166
She won’t get well unless I become SI.

758
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,833
That’s what the doctor told me.

759
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,750
Just one case.

760
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,708
One good case will get me promoted.

761
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,791
But, Inspector will never allow me
to handle any case. What to do?

762
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,416
See! It's that fool again.

763
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,458
Ma'am has asked for you.
Go to my house immediately.

764
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,375
Sir! I am not that kind. Please.

765
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:43,291
Idiot! Ma'am isn’t that kind as well.
Go home urgently.

766
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,041
-Why should I go without any purpose, Sir?
-Do what I say.

767
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,916
This tea is on the Inspector.

768
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:53,958
-My name is Kalyan.
-So what?

769
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,208
I came from Hyderabad.

770
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,375
Did you visit from Hyderabad
to tell your name?

771
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:00,166
People of Hyderabad are strange.

772
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:02,833
Okay. You came this far.
Have a cup of tea and go. It's on me.

773
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:04,083
That’s not the thing.

774
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,625
I have to discuss an important case.

775
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:06,625
Listen!

776
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:10,750
Ma'am is waiting for me.

777
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:11,916
See you.

778
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,583
Good morning, Ma'am.
You asked me to come immediately.

779
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:21,916
Did you have a shower?

780
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:23,458
I had breakfast as well.

781
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,541
-Did you bring your gun?
-They don’t give me a gun, Ma'am.

782
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:28,166
I have a stick. It's quite big.

783
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,375
That doesn’t work. I need a gun.

784
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:34,208
Sir has a gun.
I can operate that.

785
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,500
Why will I ask you if I have it?

786
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:37,791
Yeah, right.

787
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,375
Okay. Go up.

788
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,916
-Is there any emergency up there?
-Yes.

789
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,416
I will freshen up and join you.

790
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:46,791
I didn’t expect this, Ma'am.

791
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:54,250
You'll lose your job if you don't
keep an eye on those fryer.

792
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,416
I didn’t expect this, Ma'am.

793
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:59,041
There are no crows here.

794
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,083
Go away!

795
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,000
You better be scared of a cop.

796
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:25,500
Hey! You're so dead!

797
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:29,291
I wish the government passes a rule
that the crows can be eaten.

798
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:44,708
Shit!

799
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:49,833
Take it, Sir.

800
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:54,125
What’s your job and what
are you doing, Sir?

801
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,583
-You are a cop, Sir.
-Yes.

802
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:03,625
Good name.

803
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:04,916
Yes.

804
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,791
If you successfully solve a case...

805
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,250
will you get a promotion?

806
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:12,416
My mom will come out of
coma with my promotion.

807
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,625
I am waiting for such a case.

808
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,125
-Do you have something?
-I do, Sir.

809
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,166
An old man died in an
accident on Bheemili Road.

810
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:21,208
That useless guy? No one
came to claim his dead body.

811
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,916
Why should we worry about him?
What was the case?

812
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,000
That wasn’t an accident, Sir.

813
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:24,916
-Then?
-It’s a murder.

814
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,750
-A gang is responsible for that.
-Al Qaeda?

815
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,791
No, Sir.

816
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,250
-ISI?
-No.

817
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,541
-ICICI?
-Listen to me.

818
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:31,500
I got it.

819
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,708
-They’re all Pakistani terrorists.
-Oh, no!

820
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,458
This guy is an ISRO scientist in disguise.

821
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:39,083
To get the information of nuclear missile

822
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:43,875
Donald Trump and the North Korean
President, Kim, planned to kill him.

823
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,166
Sir, forget about his identity.

824
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,375
The case will be solved
if you try your best.

825
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:49,291
You will get a promotion.

826
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:53,333
Let it be anyone. I will bash them up
and get my promotion.

827
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:55,291
My mom will get well for sure.

828
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,208
-Who are you, by the way?
-I'm...

829
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,041
I am from the media, Sir.

830
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:02,041
-Media?
-Hey, Chokka Rao!

831
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:04,083
Are you giving an interview already?

832
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:06,583
Yes. I will give.
Why do you want that? Go.

833
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:07,875
He is jealous.

834
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,125
-Are you from the media?
-Yes, Sir.

835
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:13,916
Will you publish my picture
if the case gets solved?

836
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,666
It will be sensational news automatically
if you solve the case.

837
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:18,583
I should get clicked then.

838
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:19,875
-Do you know something?
-What?

839
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,625
I can meet Ivanka as well.

840
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,250
Sir... shall we leave?

841
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,666
You don't have that
sense of humor.

842
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,083
Let's go.

843
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,250
Anu! What is this?

844
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,375
What happened to you?

845
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:50,791
How can you enjoy when your
engagement is called off?

846
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,125
My life isn’t over just because
my engagement was called off.

847
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:56,208
So what? I don’t care
if Kalyan is gone.

848
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:16,125
Okay. Do you want me
to get married or not?

849
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,125
Find someone for me.

850
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,375
There are details of the dead person
but not of the accused.

851
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:57,000
Where will you start?

852
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,708
The one who got murdered
isn’t from this place.

853
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,583
How do you know?

854
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:04,125
Someone would’ve collected the
dead body if it was this city.

855
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,041
No one came.

856
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:06,958
He doesn’t belong to this place.

857
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,916
So, he must have stayed
in a hotel or a lodge.

858
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:11,166
He must have had food as well.

859
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:13,583
We might get a clue if we
inquire at those places.

860
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:16,708
What happened, Sir?

861
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:19,708
I had the same thought. Same idea.

862
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:21,125
Same pinch!

863
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,458
Start the vehicle.

864
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,000
Don’t you know Telugu?

865
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,000
I cannot drive, Sir.

866
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,500
Didn’t you ever drive?

867
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:30,750
I did drive once.

868
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,166
-The man at the back...
-The man at the back?

869
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,208
He’s gone forever, Sir.

870
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,583
Give me the keys.

871
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:37,750
You sit in the back now.

872
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,458
I’ll show you how it's done.

873
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,000
Did this person stay in your lodge?

874
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,916
Ignore the bandage.

875
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:50,875
No, Sir.

876
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,041
Take a proper look.

877
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:53,666
No, he didn’t stay.

878
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:54,958
Let's go, Sir.

879
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:57,333
Did you see him?

880
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,583
No, Sir.

881
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:09,791
I cannot forget faces for 17 years.

882
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:12,083
17 years? Will you die in the 18th?

883
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,583
Give me the key to room number 220.

884
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:15,708
220 room keys?
Why should I give you?

885
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,625
This person is staying here
from yesterday.

886
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,125
You cannot identify him.

887
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,000
Will you identify someone after 17 years?
You and your stupid logic!

888
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,583
Did you ever see this
person in this hotel?

889
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,375
-No, Sir. I didn’t see.
-Are you sure, Ma'am?

890
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,666
Did this person stay in this lodge?

891
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:49,916
Look at him clearly.

892
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:52,666
He didn’t stay in this lodge.

893
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,041
-Come.
-Sir...

894
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,708
he is lying.

895
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:59,541
Did this person stay in this lodge?
Look at him clearly.

896
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,458
He didn’t stay in this lodge.

897
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,000
Hey!

898
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:12,125
Will you tell the truth here
or in the station?

899
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:13,708
I will tell you, Sir.

900
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:16,166
That man stayed here.

901
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,875
Was there anyone along with him?

902
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:22,583
Two guys came along with him, Sir.

903
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:24,541
Three of them went out that day.

904
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:25,791
They didn’t come back all night.

905
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:27,750
Two guys came the next day...

906
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,583
and vacated the room in a hurry.

907
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:33,041
I watched the news that
the elderly man died.

908
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,083
My owner asked to lie to avoid
any police case.

909
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:38,375
-Do you have their details?
-Yes, Sir.

910
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:40,000
Exactly! Show us their details.

911
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:43,583
Here, Sir.

912
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:46,541
Take a picture.

913
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:52,791
Sorry. Say the number.

914
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:09,791
Hello, doctor, I have a question for you.

915
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:12,916
My mother won’t come
out of coma anyways.

916
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,166
What is the procedure to
send me to coma, doctor?

917
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,291
Looks like he went into coma.

918
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,583
Too many incoming calls
and very few outgoing calls.

919
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:25,875
Nice.

920
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:27,833
What did you just say?

921
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:31,125
Too many incoming calls
and very few outgoing calls.

922
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:33,916
We should check the call log.

923
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:34,916
Mine?

924
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,458
Mr. Chokka! We took this 999-number
from the lodge.

925
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:38,833
Janaganamana.

926
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,333
Janaganamana Jagadheesh!

927
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,125
He quit studies in his third grade...

928
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:49,791
and worked at mobile stores
and offices as a peon.

929
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:52,791
He focused on technology
and became the king of hacking.

930
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:57,708
Don’t worry.

931
01:12:57,875 --> 01:13:00,166
Where is your wife?
How is she? What’s her position?

932
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,791
Does she exist or not? Is she
down or up there? Dead or alive?

933
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:04,875
I will trace this number
and tell you everything.

934
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,125
Don’t worry. Go.

935

937
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:14,291
Just a while, Mr. Chokka Rao.

938
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:16,750
-Tell me, sister.
-We are VIP.

939
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:19,375
My husband goes camping every week.

940
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,000
I suspect him.

941
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,458
Please check his location.

942
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:25,875
Men will obviously go camping
when they have a wife like you.

943
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,375
Give me the number.

944
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,416
-Sister.
-Yeah.

945
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,416
Your husband is with some other
woman in Srikanya lodge.

946
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,208
-He is at Gajuwaka.
-Yes, correct! Go and kill him.

947
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,125
He’s dead.

948
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,958
-Hail India! Go and kill him.
-Hail India, brother.

949
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,416
Go to the police station with
his seared head.

951
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,666
-Jagadheesh, what about us?
-Just a while, Mr. Chokka Rao.

952
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,875
Give a break to your affairs.
Go away!

953
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,458
Mr. Chokka Rao! You can come in.

Who’s this?
He looks like Bhagat Singh.

956
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,833
He’s someone like him.
Crime reporter Kalyan.

-For?

959
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,416
-No. To the country.
-What happened to my country?

960
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,166
Pakistani terrorists targeted ship yard
and steel plant because of Donald Trump.

961
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:09,291
We should find out about their plans.

<span style="style.default_1">Vande matram.</span>

963
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,041
I don’t even like to hear that name.

964
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:16,541
I will save the country by
finding out their plan.

965
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,791
-There’s no time, my friend.
-You are the gem of all.

966
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,708
Mr. Chokka, cool down and
give me that number.

967
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,375
-Okay, my friend.
-Jagadheesh...

968
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:24,958
I want the data of
this phone number.

969
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,416
I will tell all the affairs
related to this number.

970
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:37,708
What’s this?

971
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:39,625
He got many calls from one number.

972
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:42,791
This number has repeated calls
from a number.

973
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:45,708
-He is definitely a Pakistani terrorist.
-Yeah, true.

974
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,625
-Can you give us that number?
-Sure.

01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,333
Hey, Chokka!

978
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:01,958
Chokka! We're running out of time.

979
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,583
Say the number, Sir.

980
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,375
My dear, mom!

981
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:25,166
Mom!

982
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,958
CI’s wife is calling.
I’ll go, Sir.

983
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:36,333
I am taking the clothes off.

984
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:38,375
Come fast.

985
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,750
Ma'am, you shouldn’t call
me when clothes are off.

986
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,625
Call CI. I don’t want to risk my job.
Please.

987
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,708
It’s not that. I have to
give clothes to laundry.

988
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,833
You're worried about everything.
Come fast.

989
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
CI’s wife is torturing me.

990
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:57,166
Hey!

991
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:00,208
You saved me, Sir.

992
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:02,750
Mr. Chokka! We should
get those car details.

993
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,833
Not just find the car. I will
arrest him under hit-and-run case.

994
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:07,541
-Not the details of this car.
-Then?

995
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:10,583
-The car the old man was hit with.
-What?

996
01:16:14,625 --> 01:16:16,708
<span style="style.default_1">According to the analysis of</span>
<span style="style.default_1">crime scene recreation...</span>

997
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:19,791
<span style="style.default_1">a car crashed and the front windshield</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of the car was broken.</span>

998
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,958
This is the location of the accident.

999
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:27,416
Bheemili check post six
kilometers away from there.

1000
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,625
Gajuwaka check post is
eight kilometers away.

1001
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,208
It is a hit-and-run case.

1002
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:35,916
So, they can’t cross the location
where CCTV is equipped.

1003
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,208
That keeps him in the city for sure.

1004
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,583
If he wants to escape...

1005
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:46,500
he can't go to the service station
to change the broken windshield.

1006
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:54,250
So, according to the marked radius...

1007
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:58,333
they must have gone to
a garage to change it.

1008
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:01,875
Same pinch!

1009
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Did anyone get their windshield
changed since the seventh of this month?

1010
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,583
We just got one number out of five cars.

1011
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:29,625
<span style="style.default_1">It's a small accident, Sir.</span>

1012
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:31,833
<span style="style.default_1">He claimed the insurance.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There is FIR copy as well.</span>

1013
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
<span style="style.default_1">Do you want the number?</span>

1014
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:34,708
No need.

1015
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:35,708
Cut the call.

1016
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,541
We should get the addresses
of the car owners.

1017
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:43,583
It must be one of them.

1018
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:50,791
Why are you feeling shy, Sir?

1019
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,250
Finding their address
is an easy task for me.

1020
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,208
Mr. Chokka, he is here.

1021
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,833
He looks like Wasim Akram’s brother.

1022
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:11,750
He is definitely a Pakistani terrorist.

1023
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,083
-Tell me.
-You should be the one talking.

1024
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,458
-About what?
-Where are your gang members?

1025
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,666
Snipers! Are they on the terrace?

1026
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:21,500
Are you in touch with Trump?

1027
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:22,791
What’s the commitment to Kim?

1028
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:24,916
What are you talking about?

1029
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:27,541
You hit the scientist with your car
and killed him.

1030
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:29,625
Do you think I can’t find out
if you change the glass?

1031
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:30,958
Chokka. Chokka Rao here.

1032
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,291
-Did I kill the scientist?
-You say it’s a scientist.

1033
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,416
Hey, Chokka!

1034
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:35,833
-Chokka?
-Sir... Chokka sir.

1035
01:18:35,916 --> 01:18:36,750
Right.

1036
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:40,291
How did your car window break?

1037
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,958
Got him.

1038
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:49,333
A coconut fell on the
window and broke down.

1039
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,333
There’s the tree.

1040
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:58,541
Coconut?

1041
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:01,916
It's better...

1042
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:09,208
-See you, Sir.
-Goodbye.

1043
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:12,625
Someone threw a bottle, Sir.
It broke.

1044
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,458
I filed a case at Poorna market station.

1045
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,458
You did?

1046
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:20,166
-We filed the FIR, Sir. That’s it.
-Frame it.

1047
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,625
This is the last address, Sir.

1048
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:28,750
Mr. Chokka...

1049
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:33,791
Same number?

1050
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:55,875
Yes, who’s this?

1051
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,583
Can't you get that from my uniform?

1052
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,291
Are you in a coma
just like my mom?

1053
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,083
He is blind, Mr. Chokka Rao.

1054
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:09,041
What is it?

1055
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:10,250
Who are you?

1056
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:13,291
My name is Chokka Rao.
Constable at Three town police station.

1057
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,708
I came here for investigation.
Can I come in?

1058
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:20,250
Come in.

1059
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:22,416
Be careful! There’s a chair.

1060
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,583
You work on clay?

1061
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,250
That is clay art, Sir.

1062
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,000
Whatever it is.
It is all about working with clay.

1063
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,541
You changed your car windshield
recently, right?

1064
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,583
Yes.

1065
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,666
-How did it happen?
-How did it break?

1066
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,791
My driver drinks alcohol.

1067
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,625
I asked him to give up but
he doesn’t listen.

1068
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:49,000
He had alcohol and hit a pole last week.

1069
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:53,250
-So, the windshield broke.
-Can you please call your driver?

1070
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,000
Call your driver.

1071
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,458
I fired him after that accident.

1072
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:00,833
Why are you asking
all that now, Sir?

1073
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:03,583
-To get Ivanka to India.
-Chokka!

1074
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:07,375
We are investigating a hit-and-run case.
This is about that.

1075
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:10,375
No more secrets, right?

1076
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,791
-That’s it, Sir.
-I knew it. Let's go.

1077
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:15,666
Can you give me your driver’s contact?

1078
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:19,541
I deleted his contact after I fired him.

1079
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,083
Format your phone as well.

1080
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,125
It is done, Sir.

1081
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,333
Everything is over.

1082
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,541
The case is over.

1083
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:35,541
I will go and take my CI’s son
for a horse-ride.

1084
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,916
I will go and do work at their house.

1085
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:40,000
I will remain to live like that.

1086
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,041
My life... Where is he?

1087
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,083
Don’t you care about my emotions?

1088
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,916
Driver Simhachalam's address
and phone number.

1089
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:55,625
Who is Simhachalam?

1090
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:57,083
Vamsi’s driver.

1091
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,583
I am driver Simhachalam, Sir.

1092
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:01,041
-Let's go to the police station.
-Why, Sir?

1093
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,083
You hit a person and killed him
on the Bheemili road last week.

1094
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,625
Did you think we cannot find
you if the car is fixed?

1095
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:08,416
Vamsi sir told us everything. Come.

1096
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:09,875
What are you talking about?

1097
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,500
I left the job two months ago.

1098
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:15,583
I don't have the habit of drinking.

1099
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,458
Who hit that person then?

1100
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,750
-Sir, that is…
-Hey! Tell me!

1101
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:24,041
Quite a few times, I saw Vamsi sir ride
beside a lady who drives the car.

1102
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,583
Who’s that lady?
Do you know her?

1103
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,125
-No, Sir.
-That's Ivanka for sure.

1104
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,750
-Do you have Vamsi’s number?
-Yes.

1105
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:29,708
Give me.

1106
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,083
He’s from that Pakistani gang.

1107
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:45,458
He has repeated incoming and
outgoing calls to the same number.

1108
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:46,833
Tell me the number.

1109
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,083
Mr. Chokka!

1110
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:05,333
Vamsi and that old man got
repeated calls from the same number.

1111
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:06,958
So what?

1112
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:12,541
The old man, Vamsi
and this number...

1113
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,125
has some common link.

1114
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:21,500
-Anu.
<span style="style.default_1">-Aunty.</span>

1115
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:24,458
I heard you're in Vizag.
Your mom told me.

1116
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,125
Yes, Aunty. I joined TV5.

1117
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:28,791
Tell me.

1118
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:30,958
Kalyan went to Vizag a week ago.

1119
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,125
He doesn’t even answer my calls.

1120
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,333
Aunty, I have gotten over Kalyan.

1121
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:37,958
<span style="style.default_1">Please don't call me about him.</span>

1122
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:49,500
-Who’s this?
-Sir, it is me. Driver Simhachalam.

1123
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,291
Yeah, Simhachalam. Tell me.

1124
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,291
Sir! Was there any
accident with our car?

1125
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:54,791
No. Why?

1126
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:58,291
Cops came to my house and said
I hit someone with our car.

1127
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:00,125
They were threatening me
to confess the crime.

1128
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:01,833
What did you say?

1129
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:04,291
I told them that I saw you with ma'am.

1130
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:07,041
Hey! Are you crazy?
Why did you say that?

1131
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,333
Because you didn’t tell the truth.

1132
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,583
-Who is it?
-We are...

1133
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:16,375
We are the cops who came yesterday.

1134
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,125
Why did you come again, Sir?

1135
01:24:18,375 --> 01:24:19,916
Why did you lie about the driver?

1136
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:23,000
Are you trying to escape from the crime?

1137
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:25,333
What are you saying, Sir?
How can I drive?

1138
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,833
Your girlfriend can drive.

1139
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:30,833
"Girlfriend? Me?"

1140
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:34,041
Don't try to act smart.
I will bash you up. Tell me.

1141
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:36,958
Vamsi!

1142
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:39,250
-Vamsi, I'm talking to you.
-Hey!

1143
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,291
-Hey.
-Vamsi.

1144
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:45,250
How can he shut the door?
I will smash him.

1145
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:47,875
Wait. Vamsi! I am talking to you.
Open the door.

1146
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,583
-What? Are you trying to escape?
-Vamsi.

1147
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:54,875
-Where are you going?
-I will screw you.

1148
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:56,333
Let’s go to the police station.

1149
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:58,666
Why go to the police station?
Hello?

1150
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,208
I am the constable. You can tell me.

1151
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:01,708
I don’t have to tell you.

1152
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:04,250
I will tell everything to CI Prabhakar.

1153
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:07,041
We’re dead! It's over.

1154
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,708
CI will kill me if he finds it out.
He will suspend me.

1155
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:11,791
I will stop him.
Start the car.

1156
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:14,125
Brother! I cannot drive.

1157
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:16,791
You want a piggyback ride? Just come!

1158
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:28,000
Hey... catch it.

1159
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:29,208
I’m dead.

1160
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,291
Hey, stop!

1161
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,416
Mr. Prabhakar.

1162
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,125
-Mr. Prabhakar.
-Tell me.

1163
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:37,708
Is CI Prabhakar available?
I have to talk to him.

1164
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:39,791
I am Prabhakar. Tell me.

1165
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:43,125
No. I should talk with
Circle inspector Prabhakar.

1166
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,958
-Please call him.
-I am CI Prabhakar. Tell me.

1167
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,291
This is not the voice of CI Prabhakar.

1168
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:50,750
I know him really well.

1169
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:53,291
Please call him.
I need to talk to him.

1170
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,500
Are you crazy?

1171
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:57,208
You came to my room and now you're saying
I am not the one you're looking for.

1172
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,541
-Hey, Chokka!
-Sir!

1173
01:25:58,958 --> 01:26:00,583
-Take him away.
-What is he talking?

1174
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:01,875
-Take him away.
-Come on.

1175
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,458
He is saying that I am not the CI.

1176
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:04,750
Is it true?

1177
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:08,291
-Hey! He is none other than Prabhakar.
-I'm not lying. He's not CI Prabhakar.

1178
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:11,000
-Come here.
-Listen, Sir.

1179
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,416
Hey! He is CI Prabhakar.
Stop irritating me now.

1180
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:14,541
Something is happening here.

1181
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:17,375
What happened?

1182
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,208
He is not CI Prabhakar.

1183
01:26:29,791 --> 01:26:30,625
Vamsi...

1184
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:32,375
I understand that you’re in a problem.

1185
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,500
Your car is involved in the accident
but someone else drove it.

1186
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:39,500
There’s nothing wrong in trying
to help them but someone has died.

1187
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:42,750
Don’t be scared, Vamsi.

1188
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:44,625
We are not dealing this case officially.

1189
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:48,875
We can’t help you unless you
tell us what happened.

1190
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,541
Her name is Jyothsna.
She lives in Chicago.

1191
01:26:56,916 --> 01:27:00,791
We met in my art
exhibition two months ago.

1192
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,166
She's a big fan of my clay art.

1193
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,916
She approached me to start clay art
exhibition in the US.

1194
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:11,125
We became friends and
then we fell in love.

1195
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:15,083
In fact, we planned to marry
after going to the US.

1196
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,791
The day before her flight to the US...

1197
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:21,000
we went for a long drive.

1198
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:29,666
<span style="style.default_1">Suddenly, Jyothsna hit someone</span>
<span style="style.default_1">who blocked our way.</span>

1199
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,666
-Jyothsna!
-Vamsi.

1200
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,916
-Jyothsna! What is this? What happened?
-Vamsi.

1201
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:40,916
Jyothsna!

1202
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,041
<span style="style.default_1">He died on the spot.</span>

1203
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:47,083
<span style="style.default_1">She was scared that her life will be</span>
<span style="style.default_1">spoiled if the cops find out.</span>

1204
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:52,250
<span style="style.default_1">She locked the door and cried</span>
<span style="style.default_1">all night in her room.</span>

1205
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,041
Who is it at this hour?

1206
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:59,041
CI Prabhakar, Three town police station.

1207
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:00,958
Please. Try to understand, Sir.

1208
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,916
<span style="style.default_1">I paid money to CI Prabhakar.</span>

1209
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,916
<span style="style.default_1">Now I understood that the person who</span>
<span style="style.default_1">took my money wasn’t CI Prabhakar.</span>

1210
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:10,916
Jyothsna went back to America.

1211
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:13,208
I imagined a beautiful life with her.

1212
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,375
One night.

1213
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,291
It has made my life dark.

1214
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:21,916
Did you talk to Jyothsna after that?

1215
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:24,750
I tried calling her many times.

1216
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,000
Her number was not in service.

1217
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,041
Poor girl, couldn't recover
from the incident.

1218
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:34,583
Vamsi got calls repeatedly from
the same number.

1219
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
That old man, Vamsi and...

1220
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:45,750
this number have some common link.

1221
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:48,875
<span style="style.default_1">Your dad doesn't pick calls.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't you know about the lady?</span>

1222
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:57,166
Is it Jyothsna’s contact number?

1223
01:28:58,666 --> 01:28:59,500
Yes.

1224
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:06,125
Do you have her pictures or videos?

1225
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:09,458
I have them.

1226
01:29:09,583 --> 01:29:11,333
Great! Problem solved!

1227
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:13,666
-I knew it. Show us.
-Her phone has those pictures.

1228
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:15,750
-Problem not solved then.
-Vamsi.

1229
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:19,958
Did you guys go out together?
I mean a restaurant or a theater?

1230
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,333
She really likes long drives.

1231
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:28,250
So you two hung out
at deserted places then.

1232
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:29,208
Chokka.

1233
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,000
Try to recall.

1234
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:37,791
She took me to a restaurant
on my birthday.

1235
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:41,500
Which restaurant?

1236
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,083
Which date?

1237
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:49,791
Can you play the clip around lunch time?

1238
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,583
Play cam two.

1239
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:02,000
Zoom it.

1240
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,291
I can't see her face.

1241
01:30:12,791 --> 01:30:14,666
Shit! Check the other cam.

1242
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:18,750
Just missed it, Sir.

1243
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:21,750
Why are they hitting a waiter?

1244
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:25,041
It happened on the same
day at the same time.

1245
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:27,875
What’s that issue?

1246
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,666
-It's quite common in a restaurant, Sir.
-Why did it happen?

1247
01:30:30,916 --> 01:30:33,583
-It is not related to you, Sir.
-Tell me. What was that issue?

1248
01:30:33,916 --> 01:30:35,875
I'll bash you behind the bars.
Tell me!

1249
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:39,083
There was a waiter named Satish.

1250
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:42,375
He captured pictures and videos of girls
who visited the restaurant.

1251
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:45,625
A customer saw him taking
pictures that day.

1252
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:48,041
There was a big fight.
We fired him immediately.

1253
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:49,791
Do you have Satish’s
address and phone number?

1254
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:51,416
-Yes, Sir.
<span style="style.default_1">-Give it.</span>

1255
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,000
-Where is door number seven?
-Go straight.

1256
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,916
Brother... is it Satish’s house?

1257
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:08,750
-Yes, that’s the one.
-Why is it locked?

1258
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,291
He always roams around
with his friends.

1259
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:12,791
Give me your phone.
It's him, right?

1260
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:14,208
Yes, it's him.

1261
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:16,458
Where could he be at this time?

1262
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,291
I don’t know. He is a wanderer.

1263
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:26,083
Let us have tea.

1264
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:29,916
Throw!

1265
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:32,666
Give me two cups of tea.

1266
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:38,666
Why are you playing on the road?

1267
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:40,833
Collect it from the police station.

1268
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:43,083
-Hey, Satish.
-Yeah?

1269
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:45,041
The cops came looking for you.

1270
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:47,791
It's them.

1271
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:54,291
Satish!

1272
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:03,500
-Stop!
-Are you blind?

1273
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:04,416
You'll die.

1274
01:32:04,583 --> 01:32:06,041
Why are you running away from us?

1275
01:32:06,166 --> 01:32:07,000
Kalyan.

1276
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:10,666
Satish!

1277
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:21,125
Stop!

1278
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:23,416
Satish!

1279
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,125
Oh, no! The rickshaw had
to come in between.

1280
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:33,416
Wait, Satish!

1281
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,083
Brother Srinu!

1282
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:37,208
Brother Suri!

1283
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:38,958
Stop!

1284
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:46,083
What? What do you want?

1285
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,125
Let’s not fight.
I just want his phone.

1286
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:55,541
Satish...

1287
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:57,083
give me your phone.

1288
01:32:57,666 --> 01:32:59,541
Take it.
Hey! Give him your phone.

1289
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:01,583
Phone? Take it, brother.

1290
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:06,958
No. They are dangerous people.

1291
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,583
Why are you hitting him?

1292
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:22,625
Take it.

1293
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:41,000
Give me your phone.

1294
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:45,250
Give me your phone.

1295
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:02,583
-Don’t mess with Chokka Rao.
-Give me your phone.

1296
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,541
This is Chokka Rao.

1297
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:06,250
Powerful Chokka Rao!

1298
01:35:06,916 --> 01:35:07,791
Go away!

1299
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,291
Tell me which area you're going to.
I will not come there.

1300
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:15,125
-Hey! What's the password?
-Papa.

1301
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:16,083
What kind of password is that?

1302
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:17,166
"Papa", is the password.

1303
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:24,833
Check photos taken on April 14th, Sir.

1304
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,250
Sir, that's Vamsi.
Picture is very blurred.

1305
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,541
-Jyothsna!
-How could he impress her?

1306
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:42,708
Anu.

1307
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:44,708
Hello... I'm talking to you.

1308
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:46,125
Anu.

1309
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,041
-What are you doing here?
-Anu?

1310
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,083
Is this why you came to Vizag?

1311
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:52,625
You found your girlfriend.

1312
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:55,875
What are you saying?

1313
01:35:58,541 --> 01:36:00,333
Who’s Vennela? Her name is Jyothsna.

1314
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:02,000
She is Vamsi’s girlfriend.

1315
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,250
Since when did you start lying?

1316
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:06,125
She is Vennela.

1317
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:07,958
Her name is Jyothsna. I know it, Anu.

1318
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:09,666
No! She is Vennela.

1319
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:11,458
It must be Vennela Kishore.

1320
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:13,583
How do you know?

1321
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:18,750
<span style="style.default_1">You didn’t answer my call</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on Valentine’s Day.</span>

1322
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:21,125
<span style="style.default_1">So, I came to meet you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at the restaurant.</span>

1323
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:23,666
<span style="style.default_1">That is when I saw your</span>
<span style="style.default_1">girlfriend, Vennela.</span>

1324
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:48,500
What's happening?

1325
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,750
What is actually happening?

1326
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:54,125
Shit!

1327
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:06,291
Trump, Ivanka and Kim.

1328
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:09,250
You fooled me emotionally
in the name of promotion.

1329
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:15,458
I really thought that he's a reporter
and supported him to save my mom.

1330
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,500
Goodbye forever.

1331
01:37:23,666 --> 01:37:25,791
-Give me a chance.
-Yes. You got it. Tell me.

1332
01:37:26,166 --> 01:37:28,125
-Tell me.
-I'm TV5's Creative Head.

1333
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,666
I am the head of Discovery Wildlife.

1334
01:37:31,916 --> 01:37:33,625
You are from the media and
he is from the media.

1335
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,083
You have ID cards?

1336
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:40,250
I should've asked for his
ID in the beginning.

1337
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,958
Help us with this case.

1338
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:44,166
Our lives got distraught
because of this girl.

1339
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:49,208
You'll be on TV headlines
if you help us.

1340
01:37:58,333 --> 01:37:59,875
Can I trust you?

1341
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,666
I don't have any other option.

1342
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:05,000
I'm going to trust you again.

1343
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:06,583
Tell me what to do.

1344
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:26,000
She conned Kalyan saying that
she’s Vennela...

1345
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:29,583
and then conned you saying that
she is Jyothsna.

1346
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,875
It's the same girl.

1347
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:35,458
Vamsi...

1348
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,500
don't cry.

1349
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:40,041
Not just us.

1350
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,083
She must have conned many others.

1351
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,208
She is unbelievable.

1352
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:26,500
<span style="style.default_1">You came like a rising tide</span>

1353
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:31,416
<span style="style.default_1">And shook me up</span>

1354
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:34,958
<span style="style.default_1">You came like a sparkling dream</span>

1355
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:40,041
<span style="style.default_1">And fooled me</span>

1356
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:44,541
<span style="style.default_1">You devil</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You beautiful devil</span>

1357
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:48,458
<span style="style.default_1">Love is not a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my love</span>

1358
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:57,208
<span style="style.default_1">When a guy is chasing after you</span>

1359
01:39:57,375 --> 01:40:01,458
<span style="style.default_1">He's greeting danger from up close</span>

1360
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:05,708
<span style="style.default_1">When a guy trusts you and falls for you</span>

1361
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:09,833
<span style="style.default_1">He's welcoming death to conquer him</span>

1362
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,208
<span style="style.default_1">You amused me like a lusting fire fly</span>

1363
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:18,083
<span style="style.default_1">You're the flame that sets</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart on fire</span>

1364
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:22,416
<span style="style.default_1">You devil</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You beautiful devil</span>

1365
01:40:22,666 --> 01:40:26,500
<span style="style.default_1">Love is not a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my love</span>

1366
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:30,958
She must be busy conning
someone else right now.

1367
01:40:31,916 --> 01:40:36,083
Vamsi... the common thing between us
is that we are blind.

1368
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:39,083
We were in a position to give her
the money she wanted.

1369
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:42,583
Are there any other common factors?

1370
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:47,958
What happened?

1371
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:49,541
The idol broke.

1372
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:51,166
Careful.

1373
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:06,666
Anu.

1374
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:13,166
You got this award last year, right?

1375
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:16,000
Yes.

1376
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:28,458
They started giving this award to
talented disabled people in 2014.

1377
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:33,041
This is the list of people from different
categories who took the award.

1378
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:35,458
Check if their contacts are available.

1379
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,833
Yeah. Contacts are mentioned.

1380
01:41:37,916 --> 01:41:39,833
Separate all the blind people.

1381
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:41,541
This is the list.

1382
01:41:45,166 --> 01:41:49,291
There are 11 more people
other than me and Vamsi.

1383
01:41:50,875 --> 01:41:52,666
If she is following this list...

1384
01:41:53,666 --> 01:41:56,125
someone from this list definitely
would be her next target.

1385
01:41:56,291 --> 01:42:00,458
<span style="style.default_1">Anyone who believes in you</span>

1386
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:04,583
<span style="style.default_1">Will be screwed</span>

1387
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:08,916
<span style="style.default_1">There won’t be happiness</span>

1388
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,125
<span style="style.default_1">In his life after loving you</span>

1389
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:17,541
<span style="style.default_1">You are a sparkle that mesmerizes me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And disturbs me</span>

1390
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:21,333
<span style="style.default_1">You're the flame that sets</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart on fire</span>

1391
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:34,875
Let's call those 11 people and talk.
We can catch her and close the case.

1392
01:42:34,958 --> 01:42:37,625
No! What if she is beside
them when we call?

1393
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,416
We won't ever be able to find her.

1394
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,500
She shouldn’t know that
we are looking for her.

1395
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:46,166
Those 11 people will be in
11 different cities.

1396
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:49,333
It will take so long to find them all.

1397
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,375
Let's take this list
and report the same

1398
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:53,208
to the higher authorities
at the police station.

1399
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:57,083
What will you complain about?
There is no proof that she conned us.

1400
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,625
We don’t know her name or her location.

1401
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:00,541
What to do now?

1402
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:04,250
I have an option. Our student
reporters are in different cities.

1403
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:06,083
Let us send them these details.

1404
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:09,125
They’ll secretly inquire and
give us the information.

1405
01:43:09,208 --> 01:43:10,041
Are you sure?

1406
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,833
Have it.

1407
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,125
Kalyan.

1408
01:44:12,916 --> 01:44:13,791
Kalyan.

1409
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:15,916
What happened Anu?

1410
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,291
Check this out.

1411
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:41,833
His name is Somasekhar.

1412
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:43,666
He is a classical singer from Vijayawada.

1413
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:46,291
Vennela joined his team as Kathyayani.

1414
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,958
We got her phone number which
she is using in Vijayawada.

1415
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:50,000
I am ready.

1416
01:44:50,166 --> 01:44:51,875
I am ready to do anything
to seize her.

1417
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:52,875
This is just Vijayawada.

1418
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:58,458
No one should suffer like us.

1419
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:00,833
I won’t let that happen.

1420
01:45:02,166 --> 01:45:03,958
I'll put an end to her game.

1421
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:27,000
<span style="style.default_1">Both the numbers are</span>
<span style="style.default_1">tracked in the same hotel.</span>

1422
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:28,708
-Thank you, Jagadheesh.
<span style="style.default_1">-Hail India.</span>

1423
01:45:29,666 --> 01:45:31,375
Let's go, Sir.
Let's find her.

1424
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:33,708
Let us not be hasty.

1425
01:45:34,541 --> 01:45:36,916
We need evidence to prove
that she is a fraud.

1426
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:39,708
We cannot get the evidence
if we do not make a move.

1427
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:42,041
Anu.

1428
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:49,750
-Anu.
-Stay on the line.

1429
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:02,541
It is already late.
If we do not react immediately...

1430
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:04,333
we will regret later.

1431
01:46:04,541 --> 01:46:06,916
It is my responsibility to tell you
as a doctor.

1432
01:46:07,166 --> 01:46:09,041
I told Kathyayani many times.

1433
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:11,583
I asked her to tell you
if she cannot do it.

1434
01:46:11,916 --> 01:46:15,166
But, she didn’t listen to me.
The condition is very critical now.

1435
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:17,583
If we don't do the kidney
transplant immediately...

1436
01:46:17,791 --> 01:46:19,708
it's hard for her brother to survive.

1437
01:46:23,166 --> 01:46:24,625
What is this, Kathyayani?

1438
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,750
We planned to live happily together.

1439
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:29,333
Right?

1440
01:46:31,416 --> 01:46:32,291
Yes.

1441
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:35,208
Your problems are my problems.

1442
01:46:35,916 --> 01:46:37,333
You think your brother
is nothing to me?

1443
01:46:37,416 --> 01:46:39,791
-He’s nothing to her.
-That’s not the thing, Sekhar.

1444
01:46:40,375 --> 01:46:43,583
I wanted to be the
symphony of your music.

1445
01:46:45,166 --> 01:46:47,125
I didn't want to create any issues.

1446
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:52,041
Symphony of his music?
She is such a ridiculous actor.

1447
01:46:52,166 --> 01:46:54,708
How can I ask you for the money, Sekhar?

1448
01:46:54,833 --> 01:46:57,875
<span style="style.default_1">You shouldn’t worry</span>
<span style="style.default_1">about the money now.</span>

1449
01:46:58,416 --> 01:46:59,875
<span style="style.default_1">Think about your brother's life.</span>

1450
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,625
Nothing is more important than that.

1451
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:05,083
Doctor, I will give 2.5 million.

1452
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:07,000
Don’t think about anything else.

1453
01:47:07,375 --> 01:47:09,458
Make arrangements for
the operation tomorrow.

1454
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:19,291
Brother, the dialogues are the same!
But, the victims are different.

1455
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:28,916
Sekhar.

1456
01:47:29,541 --> 01:47:33,041
I don’t want to take money from you.

1457
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:34,833
Oh, my dear!

1458
01:47:37,166 --> 01:47:38,583
That’s an insult.

1459
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:40,041
I belong to you.

1460
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:41,750
-He’s such a fool!
<span style="style.default_1">-Tell me, Kathyayani.</span>

1461
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:43,833
You aren’t my dear one.

1462
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:45,375
You are my savior.

1463
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,000
How many saviors do you have?

1464
01:47:56,041 --> 01:47:56,875
Shall we go?

1465
01:47:58,916 --> 01:47:59,958
Careful.

1466
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:04,041
<span style="style.default_1">Hello... did you hear what all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Vennela said?</span>

1467
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,833
They’re coming out.

1468
01:48:12,583 --> 01:48:16,791
<span style="style.default_1">Your words and smile</span>

1469
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:20,666
<span style="style.default_1">Make up a lovely story</span>

1470
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:23,958
<span style="style.default_1">You take me up high and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Make me fly with your memories</span>

1471
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:27,333
She's amazing, brother.
I'm easily impressed.

1472
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,333
It is justified that you fell for her.

1473
01:48:29,416 --> 01:48:33,791
<span style="style.default_1">You devil</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You beautiful devil</span>

1474
01:48:33,916 --> 01:48:37,625
<span style="style.default_1">Love is not a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my love</span>

1475
01:48:38,083 --> 01:48:40,291
-Sir, she is leaving.
-Start the car.

1476
01:48:40,916 --> 01:48:41,750
Anu.

1477
01:49:32,166 --> 01:49:33,250
Hey, Rutherford!

1478
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:34,791
Move your vehicle.

1479
01:49:35,125 --> 01:49:36,666
Can't you wait?

1480
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:39,083
Move ahead.

1481
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,583
Okay. I will leave then.

1482
01:49:43,708 --> 01:49:46,250
Don’t worry about anything.
Call me if you need anything.

1483
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:55,208
<span style="style.default_1">-Hello, Honey. Where are you?</span>
-I'll be at the guest house in ten. Bye.

1484
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,250
Call Jagadheesh.

1485
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:02,708
Look in the front.

1486
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:07,458
-Hello, Jagadheesh!
-Mr. Chokka. Tell me.

1487
01:50:07,583 --> 01:50:08,833
Did you find those terrorists?

1488
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:10,500
No. It is about those two numbers.

1489
01:50:17,791 --> 01:50:21,375
<span style="style.default_1">My country is in trouble and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my phone is not with me.</span>

1490
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:23,375
Shit!

1491
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:33,291
What?

1492
01:50:36,916 --> 01:50:38,333
Why so many calls?

1493
01:50:38,958 --> 01:50:41,250
Can’t you wait?
What if he suspects?

1494
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:42,875
Kalyan is here and he is looking for us.

1495
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:44,291
Which Kalyan?

1496
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:45,666
That chef from Hyderabad.

1497
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:49,250
He has been following you
from the hotel.

1498
01:50:49,583 --> 01:50:50,833
I diverted him.

1499
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,083
He definitely has a plan.

1500
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,541
Let us go from here.

1501
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:56,916
Hey! Pack up.

1502
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:03,916
This is all because of you.

1503
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:06,333
He came here because of you.

1504
01:51:25,041 --> 01:51:26,958
Is it really from Tirupati?

1505
01:51:27,125 --> 01:51:28,083
Yes, Honey.

1506
01:51:31,958 --> 01:51:33,875
Why did you become so devotional?

1507
01:51:34,208 --> 01:51:36,208
I had planned to go there.

1508
01:51:36,416 --> 01:51:39,000
You are busy here with Vamsi.

1509
01:51:58,625 --> 01:52:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">What did you pray to God?</span>

1510
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:02,375
I asked him to keep you safe, Honey.

1511
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:03,958
Is it?

1512
01:52:04,791 --> 01:52:06,250
Didn’t you pray for yourself?

1513
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:08,333
There's nothing to pray for myself.

1514
01:52:11,208 --> 01:52:13,708
My handbag is in the back seat.
Take it.

1515
01:52:19,166 --> 01:52:20,416
There’s a pencil in it.
Take it out.

1516
01:52:28,375 --> 01:52:29,250
So...

1517
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:32,583
God's gifting gold chains recently?

1518
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:35,875
My girlfriend gifted me.

1519
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:39,416
Yes.

1520
01:52:49,416 --> 01:52:52,000
Tell me!

1521
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:54,208
I will tell you.

1522
01:52:54,666 --> 01:52:55,750
I'll tell you, Honey.

1523
01:52:57,541 --> 01:52:58,750
Bloody life!

1524
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,875
It is just 10000 rupees.

1525
01:53:02,791 --> 01:53:04,583
She refused to give 10000 rupees.

1526
01:53:04,666 --> 01:53:05,916
Bloody life!

1527
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,125
She takes 90 percent of what we get...

1528
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:11,833
and gives us just ten percent.

1529
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:14,833
What can we do?
It is her plan. She takes the risk.

1530
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:15,958
Aren't we?

1531
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:17,791
Aren't we at risk?

1532
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:20,375
-We’ll be screwed if we get caught.
-What are you trying to say?

1533
01:53:20,708 --> 01:53:22,958
I say that we should start earning.

1534
01:53:23,208 --> 01:53:24,500
How can we earn?

1535
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:27,333
That Hyderabadi chef got his sight back.

1536
01:53:28,583 --> 01:53:30,958
Yeah. He’s looking for her.

1537
01:53:31,166 --> 01:53:33,625
Let's go and get those 25 lakhs.

1538
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,958
-What if she knows?
-No chance.

1539
01:53:36,041 --> 01:53:38,833
-I will make a perfect plan.
-Dear.

1540
01:53:40,291 --> 01:53:42,875
-You have to save my daughter at any cost.
-Uncle.

1541
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,041
Trust me.

1542
01:53:47,416 --> 01:53:48,416
Uncle.

1543
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:09,333
I am not giving you money because
you will spend it on alcohol.

1544
01:54:10,666 --> 01:54:12,458
But you cheated me.

1545
01:54:13,666 --> 01:54:14,916
It is my mistake, Honey.

1546
01:54:15,083 --> 01:54:16,833
That old man enraged me.

1547
01:54:17,083 --> 01:54:18,916
That old man should not live.

1548
01:54:19,958 --> 01:54:22,041
Even his dead body shouldn't be found.

1549
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:28,000
This is the spot.
This tree is the landmark.

1550
01:54:28,541 --> 01:54:30,333
<span style="style.default_1">I will get Vamsi along in the car.</span>

1551
01:54:30,791 --> 01:54:32,541
<span style="style.default_1">I will give you a call</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when I come closer.</span>

1552
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,166
<span style="style.default_1">Get that doll on the road.</span>

1553
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:37,250
I will hit that.

1554
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,708
I will act as if I hit a real person.

1555
01:54:40,333 --> 01:54:43,375
Take that doll away and
act like a dead person.

1556
01:54:44,125 --> 01:54:45,416
He will get scared.

1557
01:54:45,791 --> 01:54:48,083
You all clear the spot and leave.

1558
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:50,333
I will take care of the rest.

1559
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:52,041
That’s a good plan.

1560
01:55:11,166 --> 01:55:12,125
Jyothsna!

1561
01:55:12,541 --> 01:55:14,250
Jyothsna… what happened?

1562
01:55:14,583 --> 01:55:16,375
Jyothsna, where are you going?
What happened?

1563
01:55:18,625 --> 01:55:19,458
Jyothsna!

1564
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:23,666
-Vamsi.
-What happened?

1565
01:55:23,791 --> 01:55:24,875
I hit someone.

1566
01:55:25,666 --> 01:55:26,833
-He is dead.
-Dead?

1567
01:55:29,166 --> 01:55:30,833
I don’t know what to do, Vamsi.

1568
01:55:31,166 --> 01:55:33,125
Jyothsna... don’t panic.

1569
01:55:33,833 --> 01:55:36,250
Nothing will happen to you.
I will take care. Let’s go.

1570
01:55:37,375 --> 01:55:38,291
Let's go.

1571
01:55:41,083 --> 01:55:42,166
Take the chain and wallet.

1572
01:55:43,875 --> 01:55:44,708
Let's go.

1573
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:47,208
-What about him?
-We will be doomed if we get caught.

1574
01:55:47,333 --> 01:55:48,166
Let's go.

1575
01:55:49,916 --> 01:55:51,291
Jyothsna, please don’t cry.

1576
01:55:51,416 --> 01:55:52,250
I will take care of it.

1577
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:57,166
My life is ruined.

1578
01:55:57,333 --> 01:55:58,625
Jyothsna! Nothing will happen to you.

1579
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:01,916
Jyothsna… Jyothsna!

1580
01:56:06,833 --> 01:56:08,833
The cops will find out, Vamsi.

1581
01:56:09,208 --> 01:56:10,916
They will definitely arrest me.

1582
01:56:12,041 --> 01:56:13,250
I will take care of it.

1583
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:24,250
-Who’s that?
-CI Prabhakar, Three town police station.

1584
01:56:24,375 --> 01:56:25,833
What are you doing here
at this hour?

1585
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:29,291
Do you think that we cannot
find out if you hit and run?

1586
01:56:29,666 --> 01:56:31,000
Call that woman out.

1587
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:33,833
Sir… she didn’t do it intentionally.

1588
01:56:34,208 --> 01:56:36,000
Her life will be ruined.

1589
01:56:36,416 --> 01:56:38,458
Please try to understand, Sir.

1590
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:40,750
I will give whatever you want.

1591
01:56:41,916 --> 01:56:43,125
I want three million.

1592
01:56:43,333 --> 01:56:44,416
Three million?

1593
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:47,625
I'll need 2.5 million to
manage the victim's family.

1594
01:56:47,916 --> 01:56:48,833
What say?

1595
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:56,250
Here you go, Sir.

1596
01:57:04,958 --> 01:57:08,333
Your art exhibition and our wedding
shall be at Chicago in next month.

1597
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,375
I will call you after
talking to my parents.

1598
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:20,500
I will wait for your call.

1599
01:57:29,333 --> 01:57:33,250
<span style="style.default_1">You devil</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You beautiful devil</span>

1600
01:57:33,583 --> 01:57:37,583
<span style="style.default_1">Love is not a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my love</span>

1601
01:57:49,041 --> 01:57:51,958
He would’ve brought cops
if he had evidence.

1602
01:57:53,291 --> 01:57:54,708
He wouldn't follow me.

1603
01:57:56,458 --> 01:57:59,041
There is no need to run away from him.

1604
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:06,958
But he shouldn’t meet Sekhar until
we collect the cash from him.

1605
01:58:08,125 --> 01:58:09,666
-Do you get it?
-Yeah.

1606
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:13,875
Check your phone.

1607
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:16,208
Where are you, man?

1608
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:18,083
Sir! Don’t talk without knowing
what happened.

1609
01:58:18,166 --> 01:58:20,166
-What happened?
-My phone fell in the toilet.

1610
01:58:20,375 --> 01:58:23,541
I took it out and let it dry.
It dried just now and I called you.

1611
01:58:24,791 --> 01:58:25,791
Jagadheesh.

1612
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:27,083
Where are they?

1613
01:58:27,958 --> 01:58:31,333
I made all the arrangements
for the operation. Don't worry.

1614
01:58:33,666 --> 01:58:36,000
<span style="style.default_1">They’re in the building next to you, Sir.</span>

1615
01:58:37,333 --> 01:58:38,333
We’re watching them.

1616
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:40,500
Good things will happen to good people.

1617
01:58:41,666 --> 01:58:43,666
Guys are really innocent, brother.

1618
01:58:44,625 --> 01:58:47,375
Blind or not! They get cheated.

1619
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,375
All girls are not the same.

1620
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:53,125
Anyway! What’s next?

1621
01:58:54,958 --> 01:58:56,291
We should wait until dawn.

1622
01:59:01,625 --> 01:59:02,666
Let's go.

1623
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:17,875
Anu.

1624
01:59:18,333 --> 01:59:19,166
She is here.

1625
01:59:23,583 --> 01:59:24,500
-Mr. Chokka!
-I didn’t sleep, Sir.

1626
01:59:24,583 --> 01:59:26,416
-Start the car.
-Yes, Sir.

1627
01:59:26,958 --> 01:59:28,250
Driver... go.

1628
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:46,000
Looks like she swept everything.

1629
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,666
Brother, she figured.
What do we do?

1630
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:11,250
She knows everything.

1631
02:00:12,166 --> 02:00:13,000
Move.

1632
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:17,250
-Son!
-Hey!

1633
02:00:17,875 --> 02:00:21,500
Sir, I beg you.
Please take him to the hospital.

1634
02:00:22,416 --> 02:00:23,958
Ma'am, you drive.

1635
02:00:25,583 --> 02:00:27,041
Okay. Tell me the way to the hospital.

1636
02:00:27,125 --> 02:00:28,250
Go straight, ma'am.

1637
02:00:29,375 --> 02:00:30,375
-Mr. Chokka!
-Sir.

1638
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,541
Call Jagadheesh and ask him
to track their number.

1639
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:36,375
-Drive fast. He is losing blood.
-Anu, go fast.

1640
02:00:36,625 --> 02:00:38,416
-Tell me, Mr. Chokka.
-Which way are they going?

1641
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:42,416
Sir, they’re ahead of you.

1642
02:00:42,666 --> 02:00:43,666
They are ahead of us.

1643
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:47,250
-Ma'am, drive faster.
-Don't worry. He'll be fine.

1644
02:00:51,125 --> 02:00:53,375
Sir, they turned left.
<span style="style.default_1">Turn to your left.</span>

1645
02:00:53,458 --> 02:00:55,291
-Left?
-Anu, take a left turn.

1646
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:57,375
Kalyan!

1647
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:58,416
Go straight.

1648
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,375
Go.

1649
02:01:00,625 --> 02:01:02,583
They took left.
Why are you heading straight?

1650
02:01:03,166 --> 02:01:04,458
Mr.Chokka?

1651
02:01:05,416 --> 02:01:06,583
Who are you guys?

1652
02:01:07,333 --> 02:01:09,541
Sekhar, do you have network
on your mobile?

1653
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:10,625
Check it.

1654
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:19,125
Playing with me, woman?

1655
02:01:22,458 --> 02:01:25,166
After he withdraws the amount
from the bank...

1656
02:01:26,416 --> 02:01:27,916
divert the car...

1657
02:01:28,416 --> 02:01:29,958
towards Krishna barrage.

1658
02:01:30,666 --> 02:01:33,583
I will make a scene that
you took a wrong route.

1659
02:01:34,541 --> 02:01:36,125
Threaten me with a knife.

1660
02:01:36,708 --> 02:01:39,250
I will act as if I got scared and
gave you the money.

1661
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:43,541
This drama will end tomorrow.

1662
02:01:47,458 --> 02:01:49,083
Driver, where are you going?

1663
02:01:49,166 --> 02:01:50,583
-What happened, Kathyayani?
-I don't know.

1664
02:01:50,666 --> 02:01:52,666
The driver took a wrong route.

1665
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:55,958
-Hey, driver. Where are you taking us?
-Hey! Shut up and sit.

1666
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:57,750
-Hey! Why are you talking like that?
-Shut up and sit.

1667
02:01:57,833 --> 02:01:58,750
Where are we going?

1668
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:02,625
Don't answer.

1669
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:05,333
Pick up the phone!

1670
02:02:23,125 --> 02:02:24,291
Anu, turn the car.

1671
02:02:24,625 --> 02:02:25,625
Turn.

1672
02:02:25,833 --> 02:02:27,583
Mr. Chokka.
Call Jagadheesh.

1673
02:02:28,708 --> 02:02:29,583
Call Jagadheesh.

1674
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:31,833
Mr. Chokka!

1675
02:02:36,708 --> 02:02:37,541
Anu, stop the car!

1676
02:02:40,541 --> 02:02:41,666
Sir, I'll take your phone.

1677
02:02:41,916 --> 02:02:43,333
Anu, take him to the hospital.

1678
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:44,291
What about you?

1679
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,000
Do what I say. We’ll miss her
forever if we lose her now.

1680
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:53,583
Sir... why didn't you pick up my calls?

1681
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:55,458
Jagadheesh, this is Kalyan speaking.

1682
02:02:55,666 --> 02:02:58,500
Track those two numbers.
Those two numbers are turned off.

1683
02:02:58,916 --> 02:02:59,875
I cannot trace them.

1684
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:01,708
Track my number.

1685
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,541
Why track your number?

1686
02:03:16,708 --> 02:03:18,291
You are awesome!

1687
02:03:18,416 --> 02:03:21,583
Your number is traced.
You are really a fighter.

1688
02:03:22,416 --> 02:03:23,875
Where are they? Check!

1689
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,875
Sir, they are near Krishna barrage.

1690
02:03:30,916 --> 02:03:32,750
Hey, who are you?

1691
02:03:32,875 --> 02:03:34,041
Where did you bring us?

1692
02:03:34,375 --> 02:03:36,375
Hey! Who are you?
What do you want?

1693
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:38,166
Hey, driver! Stop!

1694
02:03:39,625 --> 02:03:41,166
Hey… who are you?

1695
02:03:41,291 --> 02:03:43,000
-Give me the bag.
-Leave the bag.

1696
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:45,500
-Who are you?
-Give me the bag.

1697
02:03:58,125 --> 02:03:59,833
-Leave!
-Kathyayani, escape!

1698
02:04:04,708 --> 02:04:06,000
Hey, get me a rock.

1699
02:04:25,666 --> 02:04:26,500
Hey.

1700
02:04:27,083 --> 02:04:28,083
You came.

1701
02:04:30,958 --> 02:04:32,125
Vennela.

1702
02:04:35,291 --> 02:04:37,333
Sruthi, Jyothsna, and now...

1703
02:04:38,583 --> 02:04:39,875
Kathyayani!

1704
02:04:41,333 --> 02:04:43,166
How many people will you con?

1705
02:04:47,333 --> 02:04:48,833
How many people will you love?

1706
02:04:53,666 --> 02:04:55,750
How many people will you trick?

1707
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:01,083
Enough!

1708
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,458
Surrender yourself.

1709
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:08,833
Okay.

1710
02:05:09,375 --> 02:05:13,166
You want me to surrender myself,
apologise to everyone, go to jail...

1711
02:05:14,208 --> 02:05:16,250
and pen my biography?

1712
02:05:17,458 --> 02:05:19,750
Can you get out of this place alive?

1713
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,125
<span style="style.default_1">You came like a rising tide</span>

1714
02:05:34,208 --> 02:05:39,000
<span style="style.default_1">And shook me up</span>

1715
02:05:39,333 --> 02:05:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">You came like a sparkling dream</span>

1716
02:05:42,708 --> 02:05:47,416
<span style="style.default_1">And fooled me</span>

1717
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,958
<span style="style.default_1">Your words and smile</span>

1718
02:05:52,041 --> 02:05:56,125
<span style="style.default_1">Make up a lovely story</span>

1719
02:05:56,333 --> 02:06:00,333
<span style="style.default_1">You devil</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You beautiful devil</span>

1720
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:04,416
<span style="style.default_1">Love is not a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my love</span>

1721
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:12,833
No, Kalyan!

1722
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:15,125
I conned all of them for money.

1723
02:06:15,541 --> 02:06:17,083
I didn’t cheat you...

1724
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:19,625
because I loved you.

1725
02:06:50,333 --> 02:06:51,791
Guys will never change.

1726
02:06:56,416 --> 02:06:58,958
You get emotional when you
hear about love.

1727
02:07:00,541 --> 02:07:02,541
That’s your weakness and my strength.

1728
02:08:05,583 --> 02:08:06,916
Come on!

1729
02:08:14,416 --> 02:08:17,000
True lovers will know the value of love.

1730
02:08:18,125 --> 02:08:20,166
You will not understand that!

1731
02:08:28,375 --> 02:08:29,958
You bitch!

1732
02:08:43,458 --> 02:08:46,750
<span style="style.default_1">Kalavathi alias Vennela</span>
<span style="style.default_1">belongs to Guntur.</span>

1733
02:08:46,875 --> 02:08:51,000

<span style="style.default_1">by her step-father...</span>

1734
02:08:51,208 --> 02:08:53,791
<span style="style.default_1">she left that place in</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a helpless situation.</span>

1735
02:08:53,916 --> 02:08:57,291
<span style="style.default_1">She repents that she conned</span>
<span style="style.default_1">people to earn a living.</span>

1736

1741
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:23,041
<span style="style.default_1">due to mental illness.</span>

1742
02:09:31,041 --> 02:09:34,208
Whatever you suffered in your childhood
should never happen to anyone.

1743
02:09:34,666 --> 02:09:38,375
You will be released soon
if your conduct is good.

1744
02:09:38,875 --> 02:09:39,875
Don’t worry.

1745
02:10:10,625 --> 02:10:11,541
Look here.

1746
02:10:16,875 --> 02:10:18,333
I couldn't understand.

1747
02:10:37,875 --> 02:10:38,833
TOWN POLICE STATION,
VISAKHAPATNAM CITY.

1748
02:10:38,916 --> 02:10:42,208
Right or wrong.
Justice or injustice.

1749
02:10:42,625 --> 02:10:44,333
Good or evil.

1750
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:48,500
Trump or Kim. State or real-estate.
In a war between these...

1751
02:10:49,333 --> 02:10:50,375
finally...

1752
02:10:52,625 --> 02:10:54,166
my mom has won it all.
