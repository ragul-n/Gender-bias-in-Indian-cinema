1
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,322
KHU_SHI
(Happ
ness)

2
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,942
It'll be all right

3
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,794
Welcome, sir...
- Has the midwife arrived, Sitaram?

4
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,323
Greetings

5
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,464
Don't be afraid...
it'll all be okay in a little while

6
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't be afraid... be brave.
Give me that towel

7
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,005
Give me some water

8
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,021
Congratulations!
God has given you a baby-girl

9
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,795
Praise the Lord!
- Come on in, sir

10
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,059
She's so lovable

11
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,864
Well? My whiskers prick?

12
00:03:54,534 --> 00:04:00,416
This is the world in which every man
lives for just one reason

13
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,611
That they find love in
everyone's heart

14
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,082
Love manifests itself in many ways.
Between mother and son...

15
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
between brothers and sisters,
friends...

16
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,088
but there's a love far removed
from all these kinds of love...

17
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:19,266
a love that is born in young hearts.
A love that brings joy to the heart

18
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,437
Born in the eastern part
of India, in Kolkata...

19
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,106
is Karan

20
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,717
Born in Chamoli village of
Uttaranchal state...

21
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,530
is Virbhadra's daughter, Khushi

22
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,537
Theirs is a marriage
God decided in His heavens

23
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,134
Despite being born in
different castes and regions...

24
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,140
they have one thing in common...

25
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,312
love

26
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,154
These are the two children who
are going to fall in love

27
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,149
When will they fall in love?
When will they unite?

28
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,650
That's what this story is all about

29
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:24,158
Despite the distance between them,
when will these two young hearts...

30
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,659
get to know each other
and accept each other?

31
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,436
Let's witness the miracle
of nature

32
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:43,183
This is the biggest sari-store
in Mumbai

33
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,745
You'll find every kind of sari here

34
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,591
What do you think of this one?
- Nice

35
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,524
That yellow one. Show me that

36
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,306
Why's she so late? She should
have been here by now

37
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,301
Who...? Ram Singh?
- No. Lali!

38
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,305
You start ranting the moment
your daughter's a bit late

39
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,650
Mind your own business.
And don't say I'm ranting

40
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,755
Here comes Lali!
Lali...

41
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,989
Ram Singh, hasn't Lali come?
- No

42
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,594
Moron! You must have
missed her in the crowds

43
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,329
What crowds, sir? There's just a
single railway line and a hut

44
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,004
If anyone ever gets off the train,
it's only to have some water

45
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,344
So what crowds will there be?
- Strange

46
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,676
She told me that she'd be coming

47
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,350
What could have happened?

48
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,360
My Lali has arrived!

49
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,424
Like the flying clouds...

50
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,427
is the kohl in my eyes

51
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,759
Like fragrant winds...

52
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,832
is my disposition

53
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,765
On my lips,
plays a smile

54
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,436
Here comes Khushi (happiness)

55
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,053
I bring khushi

56
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,455
From me flows every cheer

57
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,731
Without me,
they're all fake

58
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,260
I bring the mischief
of Spring

59
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,644
Khushi

60
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,852
The rains come down
in a patter...

61
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,521
it wins our hearts

62
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,262
I wish I could sway

63
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,529
I wish I could kiss
the skies

64
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,532
I tread a new path
towards a new goal

65
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,713
Water, I could turn into a spark

66
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,217
Even a spark would go berserk
at my touch

67
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,818
With my beauty,
I cast a spell

68
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,892
Even the stars
talk about me

69
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,569
Like a fairy in Spring...

70
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,968
here comes Khushi

71
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,927
O little girl...

72
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,397
at your feet
lies the world

73
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,600
I wonder,
so does everybody...

74
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,033
what is it about you?

75
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:52,072
When you smile,
it ushers in a new dawn...

76
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,609
when you cry,
it plunges us into darkness

77
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,829
I'm a carefree soul

78
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,906
I do as I please

79
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,983
Shade and the dazzling Sun...

80
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,184
it's all about my
stunning beauty

81
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,056
I'm the talk of the town

82
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,674
My bangles tinkle,
my anklets chime

83
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,672
Like a crazy beauty,
I sway in my gait

84
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,109
I'm a bit mischievous,
and a bit shy...

85
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,680
nobody can guess
what it is about me

86
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,852
Like a fairy in Spring...

87
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,163
here comes Khushi

88
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,106
I bring khushi

89
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,892
La
i! My child!

90
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,507
Welcome, sir. Greetings

91
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,742
Madam Lali says they're here
in the village to help us

92
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,418
I've made all the arrangements
they wanted

93
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,749
Where is my daughter donating blood?
- Over there

94
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:14,947
Moron!

95
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,103
Bloody doctor! How dare you
draw blood from my daughter?

96
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,769
How dare you...?
Put that blood back in her! Go on!

97
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:38,376
Hurry! Get that syringe out
which is drawing her blood

98
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,111
Listen to me...
- Use a syringe to put in the blood

99
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:46,249
How dare you draw blood from her?
- Donating blood isn't a bad thing

100
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,058
Blood is blood! It isn't water.
- Come on, Papa

101
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,304
Karan...

102
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,269
It'll give me strength

103
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,191
I'll find a girl
who wears short skirts

104
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,863
Love blossoms in my heart...

105
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,205
I see the stars and the Moon
at daytime

106
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,270
I'm about to fall in love...

107
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,879
I'm about to lose my heart

108
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,438
To Tollygunge,
I will get...

109
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,906
how are you?
I'll ask

110
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,510
The girl will ask,
what happened?

111
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,050
Come with me, I'll say

112
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,519
Samosas and rossogollas...

113
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,920
sweet yogurt,
we'll feast on

114
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,116
Life is short

115
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,394
I will find a girl
as a crazy as I am

116
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,397
And then will begin...

117
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,001
our love-story

118
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,010
In the boat, we sail...

119
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,414
across the vast Ganges,
we sail

120
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,696
Whichever girl prefers
Rabindra-sangeet...

121
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,036
will be mate for life

122
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,903
Mother Goddess... please don't
send my son faraway from me

123
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,110
Don't pray like this for me.
- Why're you angry with your mother?

124
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,537
Ma's asking for just the opposite
of what I'm asking of God

125
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,778
God must himself be confused.
Will He heed my prayers or Ma's ?

126
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,278
What you've prayed for and
what your Ma prayed for...?

127
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,115
I prayed so I can go away to Canada
and she prays that I don't go away

128
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,721
It isn't just a prayer,
she's been meditating

129
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,119
Dad, do you mind?
- Not at all

130
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,857
If my son studies in Canada,
what would be better than that?

131
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,796
How true!
- If it was only for 5 months...

132
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,469
I wouldn't have said anything,
but 5 years...?

133
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,138
Just 5 years, Ma!
They'll pass in a jiffy

134
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,734
What haven't I done to
get an admission?

135
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,139
I ran around for the passport
and visa

136
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,814
When I can stay away for 5 years,
can't you do it too, Ma?

137
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,752
She's always crying, daddy!
- Obviously, my son. She's your mother

138
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,461
What? You want to study further?
- Yes

139
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,702
Oh no

140
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,975
We have very few educated boys
in our community anyway

141
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,570
And you want to study further?
Where will I find a suitor for you?

142
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,975
A suitor... ? What for?
- To play Cricket with you

143
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,985
Why're you talking about
marriage right now, Papa?

144
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,654
I want to complete my M Sc.
I've filled in the application form

145
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,592
Sign it

146
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,193
Sign it, Papa

147
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,591
I'll pull you by your plaits!

148
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,728
Who do you think you are?

149
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,196
You're always doing as you wish

150
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,200
There are just four boys
who've done BSc...

151
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,369
in our village and the
neighbouring villages

152
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,771
Two of them belong
to our community

153
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,210
One of them is leaving for America.
What for, God alone knows

154
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,553
That leaves Ranvir Chaudhary's son

155
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,955
I've begged him and got him to agree
to live with us after your marriage

156
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,392
I've called them over tomorrow
for your engagement

157
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,724
Called them over?
With whose permission?

158
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,060
Whose permission do I need to take?
- I don't want all this

159
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,570
I want to study

160
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,244
My child, listen to me

161
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,591
After 10 years of prayers,
God blessed us with a child

162
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:43,662
A baby-girl. If I get you
married in another town...

163
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,666
I'll keep thinking
and worrying about you

164
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,437
Tell me, will I be able to live
if you're far away from me?

165
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,270
Who's marrying and going far away?
- If you study any further...

166
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,075
that's just what is going to happen!
So I've called them for an engagement

167
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,944
So ask them not to come. I want to
study further. Please sign this

168
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,957
You tore up my application form?

169
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,898
That's chap coming to meet
me tomorrow, isn't he?

170
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,797
Just you see!
I'll drive him away!

171
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,905
Just you watch!

172
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,519
Come to bed.
- I'm not sleepy. You go on

173
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,494
It's 2 in the morning. Come...
- I'm not sleepy. You go to sleep!

174
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,113
Lord Hanuman...

175
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,875
please make my daughter
agree to the wedding...

176
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,651
please make my daughter
agree to the wedding...

177
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:58,396
God has heard your prayers.
- What...? Really?

178
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,133
You may call them over.
I agree to the wedding

179
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,398
Praise You, Lord Hanuman!

180
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,973
This is my daughter, Khushi.
I call her Lali lovingly

181
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:19,788
After the marriage, you can
call her either Khushi or Lali

182
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,087
You can even give her a new name.
It's your choice

183
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,442
Do you like the boy?

184
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,781
I'm so happy that you've
agreed to the wedding

185
00:26:54,245 --> 00:27:00,127
But if you don't like the boy,
tell me. I'll find other boys

186
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,857
Now tell me...
do you approve of this chap?

187
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,028
That's chap coming to meet
me tomorrow, isn't he?

188
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,471
Just you see!
I'll drive him away!

189
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,367
Just you watch!

190
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,838
Wow! So you approve of him!

191
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,078
The wedding of Virbhadra Singh's
daughter Khushi...

192
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,655
has been fixed with Ranvir Singh's
son Mahendra

193
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,301
My glasses...

194
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:46,499
I haven't done anything.
- So who is it?

195
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,309
I'm flying to Canada?

196
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,054
Why're you laughing?
- I'm the one who's going

197
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,920
' My paSPOrFsLOUm?
Kay mY ViSa's ' okay

198
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,856
Go away to Canada.
I'm going to rot here

199
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,202
God... how could this happen?

200
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:27,344
Why're you crying?
What happened, Ma?

201
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,413
I don't know...

202
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,886
the groom's sister was crying
after she read this letter

203
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,550
Dear Khushi, forgive me.
I'm in love with someone

204
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,553
Had I told my father,
he'd have killed me

205
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,561
I know, it's terrible to tell
the girl a day before the wedding...

206
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,901
What happened, Lali?
What happened...?

207
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,581
Daddy, look at her.
She always sports a long face

208
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,052
Look at dad, Mom. He's so happy
to see me off

209
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:18,195
But all you know is to shed tears!
- Let me see you off at the airport

210
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,864
You...? At the airport?

211
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,603
I want to see smiling faces
before I leave. Not crying faces

212
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,972
My darling Ma!
- Look after yourself

213
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,880
I'll return soon. I promise

214
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,294
Take a careful look at the
guy wearing glasses in that crowd

215
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,228
This man has nothing to do
with our story

216
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,632
But he's the one who's going
to give the story a new twist

217
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,011
Watch out... step on the brakes!

218
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,290
You know whose blood this is?
Yes, it's Khushi's

219
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,426
The blood she donated in Chamoli
has journeyed far to reach here

220
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,203
For Karan

221
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,709
La
i! My child!

222
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,714
Lali, just don't worry

223
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,718
I've told the priest to find
another suitor for you

224
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,494
You're going to be married
next week

225
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,065
Keep quiet, Papa.
- Why, my child?

226
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,732
How can you take such decisions
without even thinking?

227
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,733
Do you know what I've been through?
A groom has just walked out on me

228
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,735
And you're already thinking
of another marriage?

229
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,910
And I want to study further.
But you...

230
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:53,115
Yes, you wanted to study further.
But I stood in your way

231
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:01,561
Papa, may I study further?
May I complete my MSc ?

232
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:07,130
How will you study further?
I tore up your application form

233
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,999
You tore up the form
of Pune University

234
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,368
But I've also applied
to the Mumbai University

235
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,440
They've even called me for an interview.
With your permission...

236
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,774
I'll leave for further studies.
- Bombay University?

237
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,450
How about my signature?

238
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,388
Big deal! It's just Virbhadra Singh

239
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,789
Just a fowl-scratch.
I've done it already

240
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,794
Thief!

241
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,135
What's happening?

242
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:57,218
I saw hands and legs
in plaster...

243
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,814
but not on a whole face!

244
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,417
Moron! Wear your glasses.
That isn't my face

245
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,558
It's over here

246
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,343
Bastard, you're laughing at me
instead of feeling sorry?

247
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,178
You said you were going to Canada

248
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,851
You can't leave me
and go away anywhere

249
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,357
Karan! My son!
- Greetings

250
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,062
Mother Goddess!
What's happened to my son?

251
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,870
Mother Goddess...

252
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,233
Why're you angry? She's crying
because you've met with an accident

253
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,868
This accident took place
because she cried

254
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,675
She cried before I got into the car,
so the accident happened

255
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,881
Thank God she didn't come
to the airport

256
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,145
Had she come there, maybe
the plane would've crashed

257
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,382
Send me to Canada
some way or the other

258
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,391
Rascal! Why're you laughing?
I haven't cracked a joke

259
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,298
It is a joke indeed.
When I broke a little toe...

260
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:23,231
I was laid up for a week. And you...
you're laid down for 2 months at least

261
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,909
Forget Canada, you can't even
go to the loo for two months

262
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,909
Why must he shut up?
He's right

263
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,906
The doctor says you need bed rest
for at least two months

264
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,307
Dad, what happens of my studies?

265
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,580
You so badly wanted
to go to Canada...

266
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,517
that you didn't apply
to any college here

267
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,258
There's just one way now

268
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,591
The Vice Chancellor at Mumbai
University is a friend of mine

269
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:53,264
If you wish, I can have a word with
him and have a seat blocked for you

270
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,927
Will you go to Mumbai then?

271
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,301
What difference does it make
when I can't go to Canada anyway?

272
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,342
Be it Calcutta or Mumbai

273
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,997
Looks like you're a huge fan
of Ricky Martin

274
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,744
I follow a rule. I fit in
with whoever's a big hit

275
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,016
Whether it's Ricky Martin
or a rusty tin

276
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,475
Whenever I visit a temple...
I find a lot of peace of mind

277
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,075
I used to visit the temple in the
village every clay. I liked going there

278
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,481
Look at the politician. It looks
as if he's asking God for votes

279
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,252
What did you say...?
- I was only kidding

280
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,685
I've seen you somewhere

281
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,199
No, that wasn't what
I was getting at. Please

282
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:25,197
But it's true that boys use this
line when they want to befriend a girl

283
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,631
But that wasn't I was getting at

284
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,473
But I'm speaking the truth.
I've seen you somewhere

285
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,373
I get that feeling too

286
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,953
This is the first time we've met,
but somehow I feel...

287
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:45,559
as if I've known you for 20 years.
- True. That's how I feel too

288
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,837
You do look happy

289
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,976
You're here to...?

290
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,255
Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, in our college

291
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,658
In our class?
- No, in the maths section

292
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,600
What's her name?
- Priya

293
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,267
What hankypanky have you been up to?
- I've been up to no hankypanky

294
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,678
It's the same old status problem.
She's the daughter of a rich man

295
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:43,008
And I was brought up in an orphanage.
- Why do we always have...

296
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,278
this angle in every love-story?
It's very sad!

297
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,956
So now?
- Somehow or the other...

298
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:59,030
I want to reach this letter to her.
- You plan on killing us, do you?

299
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,559
Madan, please.
- Give it to me

300
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,725
Listen, make him see reason

301
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,862
If he doesn't understand, finish him.
- Sure

302
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:37,031
You've had it, Vicky. Did you have to
fall in love with this guy's daughter?

303
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,141
Khushi, my dear. How are you?
- I'm all right

304
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,944
How's your friend doing at studies?
- Very well

305
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,357
What are you doing here?

306
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,034
What's that in your hand?

307
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,711
Yes. How did you know?
- It's all over your face

308
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:25,553
Don't you have any manners on
how to behave with a girl in public?

309
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,047
Don't you realise what people
on the streets will think?

310
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,590
You dress so well but you
behave like a cheapskate...?

311
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,095
You're talking any nonsense.
- My mouth, my tongue...

312
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,066
I will say what I want to.
- But my ears can't listen to all this

313
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,933
You're hurting my feelings.
- Feelings, I see!

314
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,675
You get friendly at the first meeting
and pass love-letters the next moment!

315
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,671
What feelings are those?
So cheap!

316
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,016
Madam, I haven't written
this love-letter to you

317
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,756
My friend Vicky wrote it
for your friend Priya

318
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:07,021
He said that she has a strict father
who won't let her take his calls...

319
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,921
and asked me if I could deliver
this letter to Priya

320
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,027
When I arrived here with the letter,
I found the watchman at the gate

321
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,769
I was wondering what I could do
when these cars arrived

322
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,437
There were these deadly thugs
with Priya's father

323
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,441
I was so shocked to see them,
I didn't know what to do

324
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,768
That's when I saw you
walking out with Priya

325
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:28,440
Khushi! She's the girl I met
at the temple

326
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,242
I thought my friend's work was done.
I'd send the letter to her through you

327
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,648
But you, you tell me that I don't
have any sense, any manners...

328
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,554
who do you think you are?

329
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,786
Maybe you have a tongue.
But you also brains to think

330
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,288
We've been studying in the same college
and yet we didn't know each other

331
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,720
That's strange, isn't it?

332
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:16,491
Strange also that we're here together.
- For love

333
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,901
For love?
- Yes. Priya and Vicky's love

334
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,673
What did you think?
- Nothing at all

335
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,107
May I ask something?
Have you ever fallen in love?

336
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,914
You?

337
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,844
Why not?
' Why not...?

338
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,115
What will I say...?
Why didn't you fall in love?

339
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,217
I don't know.
- You don't know how to fall in love?

340
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,322
So you do?

341
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,537
Shall we leave, Vicky?

342
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,910
What for?
- For dropping me home

343
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,571
You say thanks when a stranger
drops you home

344
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,382
We're not strangers anymore.
So why be so formal?

345
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,580
But I've already said thanks.
What do we do?

346
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,925
You must withdraw the words

347
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:18,019
Students, the cultural programme
at the college begins very soon!

348
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,718
What happened?
- It's open

349
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:02,113
The way you reacted over such
a trivial thing, I got really scared

350
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,729
This is how friends should be.
Your friend showed trust in you...

351
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:15,059
and gave you an open personal letter.
He must have so much of faith in you

352
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,899
That's not such a big thing.
You may read it, if you wish to

353
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,734
Your friend gave it to you,
because he trusted you

354
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,936
You gave it to me,
because you trust me

355
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:30,345
And my friend has faith in me.
We must never betray someone's faith

356
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,423
What's the big deal?
The letter says, Dear Priya...

357
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,353
I can't take you
to the movies this Friday

358
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,096
I've got to go to Nashik for 2 days,
so please don't be angry with me

359
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,762
I don't know what I will do
without you these 2 days

360
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:49,762
There's so much I will miss.
You, your voice, your lovely eyes...

361
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,439
your cheeks, beautiful lips,
the ones I kiss...

362
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:59,237
your lap, in which I rest my head.
I will keep saying...

363
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,277
Must you read someone's letter?

364
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,958
It's a love-letter!
Full of personal emotions

365
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,130
You've let your friend down.
You have betrayed his trust

366
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,302
You're a dirty man...

367
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,345
Are you through?
May I speak now?

368
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:37,809
Vicky hurt his thumb, not me.
It was bleeding

369
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,820
Can someone write when
he has a hurt thumb?

370
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:46,090
No...? So he dictated letter to me
and I wrote it for him. Get it?

371
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,821
You need more explanation?
You just need an opportunity...

372
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,567
to fly off the handle
and you won't stop

373
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,434
And you even say sorry.
Know what...?

374
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,504
Record I'm sorry on a cassette
a thousand times...

375
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,837
because you use those words
often and often. Okay?

376
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,663
What happened?
- The fan-belt seems to have snapped

377
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,876
I had one fixed just yesterday

378
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,545
What do we do now?
- We'll lock it up and walk

379
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,209
The mechanic will take it away
in the morning

380
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,884
Khushi, what are you thinking about?
- Nothing

381
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,286
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing

382
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,624
Khushi, if I ask you a question
will you answer me?

383
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,295
Whom do you like most?

384
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,905
The most... ? My Papa
- Of course

385
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,906
Everyone of us loves his Papa.
He's the one who brings us up

386
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,655
Apart from Papa,
who else do you like?

387
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:29,660
Apart from Papa... my Mummy.
- Who can forget Mummy

388
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,927
Mummy is great. At her feet
lie the heavens

389
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:38,936
Look outside the house. Whom do
you like, apart from your folks?

390
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,748
Who doesn't like him?

391
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:05,559
Look away from the film industry.
There must be someone else?

392
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,634
There is...
- There is...?

393
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,506
Who?
- Sachin Tendulkar

394
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:33,792
Khushi, fathers, mothers, actors
and cricketers are all so common

395
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:40,992
Everyone likes them. But whom do you
like specially and personally?

396
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,000
Khushi... wait

397
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,348
What happened?
- Tell me the name

398
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,754
And I'll say that I like him.
But please don't bother me like this

399
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,014
So what's the name?

400
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,520
Never mind

401
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,442
I was supposed to come, but...

402
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,911
Have you seen Karan around?

403
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,778
ls it your birthday?
- No

404
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,781
Something special at home?
- No. Why?

405
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,886
Your new dress and the sparkle...?

406
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:48,521
Nothing of the sort. Where's Karan?
- He's there in the corridor

407
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,288
He wasn't there.
That's where I came from

408
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,124
Maybe, but he's in
the telephone booth

409
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,294
In the telephone booth...?

410
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,941
Please try to understand me

411
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,476
I couldn't come because my friends
asked me to stay back

412
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,141
Hello... Madhu

413
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,953
We have two or three days off
again next month

414
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,322
Yes, I promise

415
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,828
There's still a week, right?
So let me make up for it

416
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,174
Were you waiting for me?

417
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:50,181
Well? You aren't looking nice today.
- Oh yes, that's what you will say

418
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,856
Oh no, you're really
looking very beautiful

419
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,196
I spoke just the opposite.
- That's how you've always been

420
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,998
I was only kidding.
Why're you taking it seriously?

421
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,460
Khushi's looking for you

422
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:11,868
Were you looking for me?
- Yes

423
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:15,545
What for?
- It was something important

424
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,941
But I've forgotten what it was

425
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,458
Who...?
- Who and who?

426
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,631
On the phone.
- Madhu

427
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,963
Madhu who?
- My Ma

428
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,828
Ma?
- Yes

429
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,640
But you were uttering her name

430
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,235
That's my mother's name and
I address my mother by her name

431
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,380
Yes, Ma

432
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,060
Yes, Ma

433
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,937
Get cracking. The show begins in
two hours. I don't have time to waste

434
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,076
Remember your step...?

435
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,081
You always teach me the same step.
- Because that's all I know

436
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:27,045
What...? Can you show me
something else?

437
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,305
For the last 10 years, I've been
in this college like a milestone

438
00:57:55,305 --> 00:58:00,653
My juniors have turned professors.
But my friends, my cronies, I...

439
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,012
Enough. I get it

440
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,352
Meaning?

441
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,158
Meaning... she's a friend

442
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:53,424
If not you...

443
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:59,436
if not you...

444
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:11,046
if not you... life's tough

445
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:17,454
If not with you,
my love...

446
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:22,455
I can't even die

447
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:48,021
I get no sleep

448
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,482
If not you

449
01:00:54,584 --> 01:01:01,832
If not you... life's restless

450
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,541
Pining...

451
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,146
overwhelms me...

452
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:59,887
every moment, I swear

453
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,152
Last night...

454
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,033
in my dreams...

455
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:10,902
I have seen you, my love

456
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:15,108
Laughter...

457
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:20,571
sounds like a wail
if it isn't you

458
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,576
Finding...

459
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:32,189
is like losing...
if I can't find you

460
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:23,644
In memories, I was lost...

461
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,980
all night.
I could not go to sleep

462
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,642
Loneliness...

463
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,444
gnaws...

464
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:40,652
I have no one but you

465
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,259
Rose-gardens...

466
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:50,670
appear to be barren,
if not with you

467
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,332
This moment...

468
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:01,939
seems frozen,
if not with you

469
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,551
Were you scared?
- No

470
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,522
What's this?
- A gift

471
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,320
For me?

472
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,427
What's the hurry...?
Open it later

473
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,773
Necessary for smokers

474
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,084
Where did you buy it?
- Akbarallys

475
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,587
For how much?
- 5000

476
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:52,982
5000...?

477
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,118
An ashtray...? For 5000 ?

478
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,132
It's no ordinary ashtray.
It's made from French crystal glass

479
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,027
It's expensive because of
its intricate art-work

480
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,796
It's very nice indeed

481
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:11,333
But you could have given me
another gift instead of this

482
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,812
It's such an expensive
and beautiful ashtray...

483
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:23,814
I'd hate to drop ash in it
when I smoke

484
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,819
That's exactly why I got
this ashtray

485
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:32,289
Because whenever you drop ash,
you must remember me

486
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,564
And you mus_t feel that
you're dropp
ng ash...

487
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,827
not in the ashtray, but on me

488
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:42,835
So you must give up smoking

489
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,506
Karan quits smoking...?

490
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,578
Ask me for anything else, and I'll
do it. But give up smoking? No way

491
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,293
If you...

492
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,860
respect me...

493
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,859
you will give up smoking

494
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,168
Happy?

495
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,769
For the exams.
I'm studying

496
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,546
That's not nice.
- What?

497
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,113
That which you're doing

498
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,914
Reading a book is a nice thing.

499
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:26,787
In any case, it isn't porn.
It's a college book

500
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,457
I'm not talking about
what you're reading

501
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:32,128
I'm talking about the thing
you've been staring at

502
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,804
Yes, I've been taking a good look

503
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,673
Don't switch the topic.
You...

504
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,568
you were staring at my waist

505
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,879
Don't pretend! You were watching it!
- I didn't

506
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,142
You did too!
- I didn't, I say

507
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:57,147
And I say you did. You did!
I caught you staring at it!

508
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:08,160
Well, maybe my eyes wandered
when I was turning a page

509
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,896
But I didn't have any intentions

510
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,172
You haven't been here a minute,
nor have you read a page...

511
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,167
but you looked at it a dozen times!
- Now look, Khushi...

512
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:22,777
you're mistaking me.
- What... ? I'm making a mistake...

513
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:24,642
or was it you?

514
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,181
Remember all those things! When
I gave you Vicky's open letter...

515
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,927
when I told you about its contents,
what did you say...?

516
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,185
One must never look at
other's private affairs

517
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:41,700
You called me so many names!
Didn't you?

518
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:46,571
When I told you that he had hurt
his thumb and that I had written...

519
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,001
the letter for him,
you said sorry to me

520
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,609
Didn't you?

521
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,111
Never mind that.
Let's talk about our first meeting

522
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,945
When I gave you that letter
Vicky wanted delivered to Priya...

523
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,208
what conclusion did you jump to?
That I was giving you the letter

524
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,377
You yelled so much at me

525
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,790
Didn't you yell at me?
But when you got to know the truth...

526
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:17,233
you said sorry. Didn't you?
I know what you want

527
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,230
You want everyone to praise your
beauty, to be crazy about you...

528
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,735
and say I love you to you.
And when someone does that...

529
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,842
you get worked up,
you kick up a fuss...

530
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:28,972
you start accusing him and say that
he's after girls. Isn't that right?

531
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,046
Talk about me...
not about other girls

532
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:37,254
What do you know about
glrls' psychology? What?

533
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,059
We don't pretend! I don't pretend!
But you do!

534
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,525
You do!

535
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:46,989
What did you do at the restaurant
the other day?

536
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:52,601
You deliberately dropped your spoon,
so you could use my spoon to eat!

537
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:56,607
You did put on an act then.
What were you hiding on?

538
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,871
The other day, you said your car had
broken down and that we'd have to walk

539
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:06,276
And what did you ask me...?
Whom did you like most?

540
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,450
You bored me to death!

541
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,291
And when your daddy come to the
college, you introduced everyone...

542
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,098
Why didn't you say it freely?

543
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,761
Why did you hestitate then?
What feelings were you hiding?

544
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,299
Oh sure, despite
knowing everything...

545
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,043
why've you been acting as
if you didn't know anything?

546
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,110
What will I take that for?

547
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,043
Despite knowing everything,
you gifted me an ashtray

548
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,318
Okay, you gave that to me
as a friend

549
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,919
But when I was talking to my Ma
the other day...

550
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,646
when I was showering kisses on her...

551
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:46,225
why did you badly
want to know the truth?

552
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:50,055
You calmed down only after you
got to know that Madhu's my Ma

553
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:54,891
You presented me an ashtray.
All right, maybe that's friendship

554
01:14:55,324 --> 01:15:00,034
But the restlessness you showed
when you wanted to know about my Ma...

555
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,775
the streak of possessiveness you
showed, what do I take that for?

556
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,347
Let's not stray from the point.
Didn't you stare at my waist?

557
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,356
Haven't you loved me?

558
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,717
No.
- I didn't stare either

559
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:32,362
I happen to talk to a girl
and she finds faults with me!

560
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,706
I can't ever be friends
with an egoistic girl like her!

561
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,933
Even if we are friends,
it's never going to lead to love

562
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,102
Even if we fall in love,
we'll never marry

563
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,237
And even if we somehow
make it to the marriage altar...

564
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:46,786
I'll say that I can't marry a girl
like her and run away from there!

565
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,585
What a girl!

566
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:04,737
You have no right to
talk about my character

567
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:10,403
I'll forget that I ever
met someone called Karan

568
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,406
You and I have nothing
to do with each other

569
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,682
She looks like a twin-sister
of our master

570
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,955
Excuse me, you're not
our master's twin, are you...?

571
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:08,358
Oh no. There are only
sisters in our family

572
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:12,696
It's the master himself.
What disguise is this, Master?

573
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:17,977
What? People go to great lengths
to have an album released

574
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,973
I've only changed my name.
From Madan to Badan Bhosle

575
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:25,250
So what's wrong?
- Name an album of yours, Master

576
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:28,448
Don't be stubborn, my love
- How about humming the tune?

577
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:31,515
The tune...? It's fantastic

578
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:35,991
I've really worked hard on this song.
When it's released...

579
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:40,164
it's going to kick up a storm.
Want me to sing it for you?

580
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:46,235
The bud of the night,
blossoms by day

581
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:50,336
She's mischievous...
she wanders everywhere

582
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,607
What else will I say...?

583
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,348
don't be stubborn, my love

584
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:10,361
That's a number from Asha Bhos
e's
hit album Jaanam Samjha Karo

585
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,194
What nonsense!
That's the title of a movie!

586
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,834
The album of the same name was a hit,
but the film was shit

587
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:24,709
What's between you and me?
- That's for you to decide, sir

588
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,708
I'll decide later. Now tell me
what do you mean to me?

589
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,905
Your secretary, sir.
- And what's a secretary's job?

590
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:33,714
You must go out in the market and
find out which album is doing well...

591
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:37,220
and what the get up is...
so that they don't clash with ours

592
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,720
What sorry?

593
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:44,063
Well, sir...
- No wells! That's it

594
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,824
Want me to sing another song?
- Sure. Go ahead

595
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:52,562
What would I do,
if not die...?

596
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:56,466
you're the chosen one
in thousands...

597
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,742
my love

598
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:39,118
Do not be mistaken.
I haven't come here for a compromise

599
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,346
Why? ls that wrong?

600
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,522
I don't want to...

601
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:49,920
with you...

602
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:57,130
I don't want any argument.
I have something important to say

603
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,866
During the summer vacations
when we were not around...

604
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:05,143
a lot of things have taken place.
Vicky went to meet Priya at her place

605
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,878
He mistook her father for her
and awakened him

606
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,942
He was caught

607
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:15,151
Priya's father is holding her
captive in the house

608
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,147
Did Vicky attend class?
- No

609
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:22,823
The love affair we promoted
is now facing problems

610
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:27,165
I'm talking about Vicky
and Priya's love affair

611
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,862
Did you meet Priya?

612
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:37,644
I mean, have you...?
- Yes

613
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,175
I've come from her house right now.
She was crying

614
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:51,584
I told her not to worry. To unite her
with Vicky is my duty, I promised her

615
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:56,527
And you have promised your friend
to unite the two of them

616
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:02,197
So, to honour the promise
I've made to my friend...

617
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:06,198
and for you to honour the promise
you've made to your friend, we must...

618
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:09,699
We must...?

619
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,875
We must get together
and unite them

620
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:26,216
We must... what I'm saying is that
...l want to make it clear

621
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:34,229
In uniting them, the relationship
we are going to share...

622
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,899
is what I'll decide right now

623
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:45,242
It will not be love, no friendship
and no relationship at all

624
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:54,253
Our relationship will last as long
as they are united

625
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,589
I hope you will do that

626
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:09,635
That you will do it,
I am convinced

627
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:16,002
What can I say now?
You've said what I wanted to

628
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,611
Shall we go to meet Vicky?

629
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:43,632
You're the limit! You couldn't
wait for two months

630
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:51,836
All I want to know is what you told
Priya's old man when you woke him up

631
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,169
Priya darling, here I am ?
Or was it...

632
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,112
Sorry, Uncle. Wrong number ?

633
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:02,118
This is exactly why I tell you
not to fall in love!

634
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:06,119
Look at me. I'm such a happy man!
And why...?

635
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:11,656
Because I'm not in love with someone!
And I don't have any problems like you

636
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:15,932
Look at your face. You look like
the perfect jilted-lover

637
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:30,011
To hide your pain and fake a laughter
is nothing but stupidity

638
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:33,679
What?
- I'm talking about Vicky's pain

639
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,254
The one you're feeling too

640
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:41,351
Will it solve the problem by
feeling the pain and crying? No

641
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:48,364
Just concentrate on your studies,
Vicky. As for your love...

642
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:52,364
leave it to us. To unite you
with Priya is our responsibility

643
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:58,537
Can't you trust my words?
All right

644
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:03,646
But you do trust your love,
don't you? If your love is true...

645
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:07,181
it'll surely unite the two of you.
Am I right?

646
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:12,985
If our love is true,
it'll surely unite us

647
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:21,063
Yes.
- Yes, yes indeed

648
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:44,218
Where's the need to walk?
I'll drop you home

649
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:53,093
You needn't necessarily be my
girlfriend for me to drop you home

650
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:57,431
It doesn't need a relationship at all.
You could say...

651
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,035
you've taken a ride
in a stranger's car

652
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:03,772
And I'll think I gave a ride
to a girl who was a stranger

653
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:11,443
If you still want to walk,
it's up to you

654
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,648
What can I do about it?

655
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:17,851
I live in the hostel now.
Not in that flat

656
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:23,123
To distance myself from some one,
I had to stay at the hostel

657
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:29,932
I'll drop you at the hostel then

658
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:30,524
Two strangers,
where are they headed...?

659
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:33,426
where are they going?

660
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:43,937
Angry with each other...

661
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:48,877
they appear to be,
even as they drive on

662
01:26:59,915 --> 01:27:06,560
Two strangers...
where are they headed?

663
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,161
Where are they going?

664
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:19,572
Angry with each other...

665
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:24,578
they appear to be,
even as they drive on

666
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,964
Awake...

667
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,427
asleep...

668
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,961
lost...?

669
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,305
ask them

670
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:38,216
Stop faking anger...
be friends again

671
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:43,653
Do not break each other's hearts,
that isn't a nice thing to do

672
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,660
From a distance...

673
01:28:51,927 --> 01:28:53,929
up close...

674
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:59,337
they torment each other,
they go together

675
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:46,089
Desire, hatred...

676
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:50,720
what exactly do they
want in love?

677
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:04,410
Yes and no...

678
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:07,278
is all they say

679
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:12,085
What's in their hearts?
No one knows

680
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:22,753
Longing in their eyes,
to see each other...

681
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:28,030
they're afraid,
they go together

682
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:45,184
Two strangers...
where are they headed?

683
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,116
Where are they going?

684
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:58,461
Angry with each other...

685
01:30:59,254 --> 01:31:03,566
they appear to be,
even as they drive on

686
01:31:35,924 --> 01:31:39,167
I have't clone anything this time.
It has stalled on its own

687
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,841
The wire of the spark-plug
has come off

688
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:34,156
God! I haven't seen anything
- What?

689
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:37,886
Nothing

690
01:32:49,164 --> 01:32:53,306
When a stranger drops me home,
I always thank him

691
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:56,908
That's a habit of mine.
- Nice habit too

692
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:13,657
Because of my native tongue, you got
to know that I'm from the villages!

693
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:15,927
You want to rob me?
- No, sir

694
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:19,938
Thief! I asked you to take me
to Mumbai University and...

695
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,672
you've been taking me around Mumbai!

696
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:25,541
You've been driving
around the same place!

697
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:28,210
Forget it, sir.
It's human to err

698
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:30,713
Looks like you're
hand in glove with him

699
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,616
Please let him go, Uncle

700
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:41,257
Come with me.
I'll give you a ride

701
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:46,297
You don't appear to be a cabbie.
Why will you give me a ride?

702
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,623
He's the one who'll take me there.
You go on

703
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:53,769
Until you leave, no one else
will be able to move from here

704
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,434
The traffic's come to a standstill
because of you

705
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:01,504
I study at the Bombay University too.
Come with me, I'll take you there

706
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,783
You take me to be an idiot...?

707
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:12,788
The moron!

708
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:18,991
Son, how do you live in this city?

709
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:23,334
Everyone here appears to be
a fraud to me

710
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,904
But you're a nice boy

711
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,673
Guess what I like most about you?

712
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,007
Your smile

713
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:40,680
Do you know my daughter?
- Who?

714
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:49,427
How would you know her? There must
be so many girls in the college

715
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:56,435
There's this hostel near the college.
- Which hostel...?

716
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:02,039
Now what is the name...?
Mary...

717
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:10,044
Right, St Mary's Girls Hostel!

718
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,782
Do you know where the hostel is?
- Know?

719
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:20,282
I can't ever forget that hostel.
- Why?

720
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:23,861
There's this girl I know
who stays there

721
01:35:24,419 --> 01:35:28,424
She's no ordinary girl, mind you.
She has a massive ego

722
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:31,399
What?
- Ego

723
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:36,067
Meaning...?
- Ego meaning...

724
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,576
she thinks she's the last word

725
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:48,543
Even when she knows she's wrong,
she'll never say sorry

726
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,582
This damn ego...

727
01:35:55,583 --> 01:36:01,090
how will I explain it?
This girl...

728
01:36:01,823 --> 01:36:05,270
she's stubborn, a bit eccentric...

729
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:14,513
I get it. That daughter
of an ass is arrogant

730
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,514
Yes, arrogant!

731
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:26,115
I wanted to tell you about the girl,
but you've spoken about her family!

732
01:36:34,389 --> 01:36:41,136
She's just a girl, you know.
If she can be so arrogant...

733
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:44,135
am I any less?
- Oh yes

734
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,144
Oh yes!

735
01:36:52,607 --> 01:36:53,608
Oh yes!

736
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:02,754
That's the block.
- Thank you very much

737
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:09,332
I live in Chamoli, son. If you ever
visit the place, do meet me

738
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,399
See you

739
01:37:14,896 --> 01:37:16,705
La
i! My child!

740
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:21,179
How are you?
- I'm fine

741
01:37:21,636 --> 01:37:24,173
Why're you so late?
- What will I tell you?

742
01:37:24,706 --> 01:37:27,516
On my way, I got into
a fight with a cabbie

743
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:31,684
It was a terrible fight and
this nice boy really helped me

744
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:34,993
He... one moment!

745
01:37:36,918 --> 01:37:39,194
Hello son... hello!

746
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:41,464
Come here

747
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,392
<i>La“, come here</i>

748
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:05,214
As I was telling you, I got into
a fight with a crazy cabbie

749
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:08,953
And a decent boy came along
and helped me. He's the one

750
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:11,560
This is my daughter, Lali

751
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:28,510
Have some coffee before you leave.
- Thanks, but I've got to go

752
01:38:28,936 --> 01:38:32,941
Oh no. Back in the village, we don't
let a guest go away without...

753
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:36,518
extending our hospitality. If you
leave without having coffee...

754
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:39,588
I'm going to feel bad.
Tell him to stay, clear

755
01:38:43,451 --> 01:38:45,453
Please have some coffee

756
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:53,672
I'll go and lock my car.
- All right. Let's go

757
01:38:56,464 --> 01:38:59,035
I don't want to get married.
- Why not?

758
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:02,273
When you wanted to study further,
I agreed with you

759
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:05,607
And now that I want you to get
married, you must listen to me

760
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:09,551
Come, son.
Have some coffee

761
01:39:10,077 --> 01:39:12,683
I just don't agree!
- Why not?

762
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,492
Look at her, son.
She's not listening to me

763
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:24,626
You must listen to Papa, mustn't you?
- Do you know what he's saying?

764
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:28,297
And this is between the two of us.
You aren't interfering

765
01:39:28,763 --> 01:39:31,972
You'll get a slap, Lali.
He's a guest...

766
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:36,806
is that how you talk to a guest?
What wrong have I said, son?

767
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:40,047
I'm looking for a groom for her
and she's refusing me

768
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:50,052
When a girl keeps refusing to get
married, what does it mean?

769
01:39:50,685 --> 01:39:54,326
It means there is someone else
she loves

770
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:59,667
I'm not against that. All I want
is for you to have a nice wedding

771
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:06,140
But how should the suitor be?
He must be just like this boy

772
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:13,149
Clean-hearted, innocent eyes...
a handsome young man

773
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:19,681
If there is someone you love,
tell me about it

774
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,626
I'm not in love with anyone

775
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:28,766
If you really don't love anyone,
you must obey your Papa

776
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:35,364
Papa, I'm willing to get married.
- Wow!

777
01:40:37,465 --> 01:40:39,172
This is amazing!

778
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:42,109
I've been trying for so long
and she just wouldn't agree

779
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,715
You spoke to her just once
and viola! She agreed!

780
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:49,385
Looks like we share the
same birth-sign, son

781
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:53,382
I had a problem with the cabbie
and you solved

782
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:57,386
And this problem of her marriage
you have solved too

783
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:02,630
I'm happy to have achieved
what I set out to do

784
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:06,570
Lali, I'm leaving by this
evening's train

785
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:08,940
Do look after yourself, okay?

786
01:41:09,263 --> 01:41:12,210
Come on... drop me on the way

787
01:41:16,504 --> 01:41:20,418
Lali, I forgot to tell you
something very important

788
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:24,151
There's a girl he knows
who stays here

789
01:41:25,947 --> 01:41:28,894
They have a fight going
between themselves

790
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:34,093
Never mind, Uncle. Please...
- Now wait a moment

791
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:37,232
Won't I do anything for all the help
you've extended to me?

792
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:39,162
What will people say?

793
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:46,436
She's a very arrogant girl, Lali.
As he said, she's very stubborn too

794
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:49,871
Not just stubborn, she's...

795
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,785
a bit mental, eko...
what word did you use?

796
01:41:56,444 --> 01:42:00,893
Never mind, Uncle. Forget it...
- Give me the word! What was it?

797
01:42:04,652 --> 01:42:09,863
Yes! Ego!
She's possessed by ego!

798
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:14,065
Like spirits taking possession
of people's bodies...

799
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:17,170
this girl is possessed with ego!

800
01:42:18,933 --> 01:42:23,473
Ask the girl not to
fight with him, dear

801
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:27,876
He's a very nice boy. Even my Papa
believes he's a very nice boy

802
01:42:28,376 --> 01:42:30,378
Bring the two of them together.
Okay?

803
01:42:32,747 --> 01:42:36,889
Will that be enough or do you want me
to stay over for your help, son?

804
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:39,491
No thank you, Uncle.
You've done so much!

805
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:42,493
That's all right...
See you

806
01:42:43,024 --> 01:42:48,098
She's a fool to get into a fight
with a nice boy like you

807
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:51,837
It isn't her fault. It must be
her father who

808
01:42:52,233 --> 01:42:55,908
has really pampered
the arrogant girl

809
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:02,181
What has come to be?
And why...?

810
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:08,756
Don't think about it...

811
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:19,028
Think, how could that girl blow such
a little thing out of proportion?

812
01:43:21,762 --> 01:43:27,542
I can't get this. This little part
of the female anatomy...

813
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:34,543
Don't remind me, please!
- Everyone gets to look at it

814
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:42,153
What went wrong if you looked at it?
In Mumbai, girls expose their legs

815
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,552
This is just what
I can't understand!

816
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:53,563
Your friend Shibu has come all the
way from Kolkata to solve your problem

817
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:56,564
And I'll solve it too

818
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:05,012
Look at this. Once this goes in,
your woes will vanish

819
01:44:06,941 --> 01:44:11,583
No thanks. I don't drink.
I don't want it

820
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:17,592
Drink it up... listen to me.
Just a little... come on

821
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:25,935
Fun?

822
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:33,341
I'll now sing a hit song for you

823
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,946
You'll find happiness

824
01:44:57,057 --> 01:45:02,131
Shut up! You make me sadder!

825
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:06,976
Drink some more. The more you drink,
the more your problems will vanish

826
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:12,644
You didn't approve of the
Bengali song, did you?

827
01:45:13,207 --> 01:45:15,448
I'll sing a song from Mumbai
for you

828
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:22,992
Everyone wants a slender waist

829
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:42,673
If only your heart
could win over the waist

830
01:45:57,685 --> 01:45:59,687
Fun, wasn't it?

831
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:05,435
The song's over, so is the booze

832
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:13,701
You have a smoke...

833
01:46:18,339 --> 01:46:20,512
I'll get lots of booze

834
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:39,729
When you drop ash in this ashtray
you must know it's not the ashtray...

835
01:46:41,128 --> 01:46:43,540
but me it's falling on.
- Oh yes!

836
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:03,752
What are you staring at?
This way

837
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:09,761
This way... look here

838
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,569
What...?

839
01:47:16,063 --> 01:47:20,569
what are you staring at
with your big...

840
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:29,183
no, with your two small eyes.
What are you looking at?

841
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:54,812
All I did was to look
at this little waist

842
01:47:56,303 --> 01:48:00,809
Who do you think you are?
You're very beautiful?

843
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:07,153
Your face is like a chameleon's,
a pencil-thin nose...

844
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:12,830
and your body...?
It's all right

845
01:48:14,388 --> 01:48:17,835
Your waist is the only thing
one can look at

846
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:20,327
This little waist

847
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:27,836
Draped in a black sari,
that little area...

848
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:34,378
is like a lemon.
No, lemons are yellow

849
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:41,520
In reds and yellows, if it's shown up
in a romantic light...

850
01:48:41,749 --> 01:48:44,855
naturally, I will look at it.
If you mind...

851
01:48:45,052 --> 01:48:47,396
you mustn't show it at all

852
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:53,466
Just as your face is a part
of your body, so is your waist

853
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:57,673
I look at your face, you don't mind.
I see the waist, you mind. What for?

854
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:00,610
Tell me, darling. Speak

855
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:06,478
Not just your body, I'm going to
take a look at your whole body now

856
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:15,451
You have no right to
stand there before me!

857
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:19,279
You have no right to touch it!

858
01:50:35,095 --> 01:50:37,439
I came here to discuss
something important with you

859
01:50:37,865 --> 01:50:40,971
But neither are you in the mood to
listen, nor am I in the mood to tell

860
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:54,554
Khushi, I've done nothing.
It's my Bengali friend

861
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,984
He forced me to drink

862
01:50:59,086 --> 01:51:02,795
If people smoke and drink,
why must I care?

863
01:51:03,457 --> 01:51:07,337
It isn't necessary for me
to know why you had liquor

864
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:29,358
Want some...?

865
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:35,531
I came here because I thought
you were a nice human being

866
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:38,833
But you're worse than
I could ever imagine

867
01:51:44,031 --> 01:51:45,704
If you'd listen...

868
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:35,591
You're a performer...

869
01:52:36,283 --> 01:52:39,093
you can't make me dance

870
01:52:40,187 --> 01:52:43,600
When it's your turn...

871
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:46,765
you'll beat a hasty retreat

872
01:52:50,197 --> 01:52:54,771
Master, that's Altaf Raja's tune.
- Altaf Raja? A foreigner?

873
01:52:55,102 --> 01:52:59,107
He's a famous qawwal. This is
a tune from his famous album

874
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,442
How's that possible?
- It is

875
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:06,114
You must've heard the tune
and pinched it

876
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:11,458
But this is a three-year old tune.
- What a thief!

877
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:16,795
I composed the tune three days ago,
and he stole it three years back!

878
01:53:17,524 --> 01:53:19,401
No more qawwali for me!

879
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:34,883
How did you know it's Priya
without even looking at her?

880
01:53:35,409 --> 01:53:40,552
The fragrance! I can tell every
beautiful girl from her fragrance

881
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:44,493
Where's this stink coming from...?
Lay off!

882
01:53:51,224 --> 01:53:53,966
You like my wig, don't you?
Here you are

883
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:08,184
Remember, the cultural programme at
the college is fast approaching?

884
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:12,783
Join Karan immediately
and start your rehearsals

885
01:54:13,647 --> 01:54:15,320
No, Master.
- Why?

886
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:18,789
I can't participate in this function.
- Why not?

887
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:21,658
I've told you. I'm not participating

888
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:33,804
Mukesh, make a team of Karan and Roma
and send them on the stage

889
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:36,010
You have my blessings!

890
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:47,215
Who's Roma?
- You don't know Roma? Roma!

891
01:54:47,614 --> 01:54:51,619
A new student in the first year!
She's kicked up a storm in the college

892
01:54:52,085 --> 01:54:56,625
The students are crazy about her
and go around her like blind men

893
01:54:57,023 --> 01:54:57,933
What for?

894
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:29,931
Could you help me cross the road?
- What for?

895
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,669
A blind man needs help

896
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,294
You've crossed the road.
- Small road

897
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:06,297
What...?
- You've helped a blind man

898
01:56:06,693 --> 01:56:09,299
Thank you so much.
You are large-hearted

899
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,710
Slipped out of my hands! Damn it!

900
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:30,124
What is the matter?
- Priya has sent a letter

901
01:56:30,817 --> 01:56:32,819
You can give it to Vicky.
- It's not for him

902
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:34,329
ls it for me?
- No

903
01:56:34,488 --> 01:56:35,899
It must be for you then.
- No

904
01:56:36,056 --> 01:56:38,332
If not for me, you nor Vicky...
- It's for the two of us!

905
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,672
You read it

906
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:03,957
I love Vicky so dearly...

907
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:07,161
I don't think anyone in
the world loves anyone as much

908
01:57:07,954 --> 01:57:12,699
You must think why every lover
in the world says that

909
01:57:13,727 --> 01:57:16,173
It's because they have
true love for each other

910
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:20,968
And the suffering of separation
those truly in love go through...

911
01:57:21,368 --> 01:57:23,177
only I know about

912
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:28,382
I'm pining to meet Vicky.
Please bring us together

913
01:57:30,443 --> 01:57:32,184
Yours, Priya

914
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,984
What are we to do now?

915
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:39,762
Priya has a friend called
Shehnaz, right?

916
01:57:46,393 --> 01:57:48,168
How are you, Rukhsana?
- I'm fine

917
01:57:49,396 --> 01:57:50,932
Be careful, Vicky

918
01:57:55,402 --> 01:57:57,814
The two of you chat,
I'm going to bed

919
01:58:07,147 --> 01:58:09,149
Who's this girl?

920
01:58:09,416 --> 01:58:11,418
It's Shabana.
Shehnaz's friend

921
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,773
ls she coming here
for the first time?

922
01:58:25,832 --> 01:58:26,833
Yes

923
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:32,448
I see. Go ahead and
chat with Rukhsana...

924
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:35,446
I'll take Shabana around the house

925
01:58:35,909 --> 01:58:37,911
Come on, Shabana.
- Run away, Vicky!

926
01:59:06,906 --> 01:59:09,477
Car number 906.
ls it yours?

927
01:59:09,909 --> 01:59:11,479
Yes.
- Karan?

928
02:01:57,644 --> 02:01:59,646
Let me do it

929
02:02:55,702 --> 02:02:58,706
How are you related to the girl?
- I...

930
02:03:00,173 --> 02:03:03,450
Help me with the injection.
- All right

931
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:18,733
In the waist

932
02:03:22,729 --> 02:03:25,733
Give it to her in the arm.
- This is meant for the waist

933
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:28,539
No, give it to her in the arm.
- The one for the arm...

934
02:03:28,801 --> 02:03:32,408
is given in the arm, the one
for the waist is given in the waist

935
02:03:35,308 --> 02:03:38,312
You don't know anything
about this waist, doctor

936
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:43,089
This waist has caused
a very big problem already

937
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:47,493
If I go into details,
it'll take at least 2 hours

938
02:03:47,954 --> 02:03:50,560
Your duty hours will be over
and when the next doctor comes...

939
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:54,428
I'll have to explain to him!
Have mercy on me...

940
02:03:54,761 --> 02:03:56,763
and give it to her in the arm

941
02:04:02,769 --> 02:04:06,512
That's all right!
You can give it wherever you wish

942
02:04:07,006 --> 02:04:10,453
Give it to anyone. To her,
the nurse or yourself...

943
02:04:11,177 --> 02:04:13,589
I've seen nothing,
I will see nothing

944
02:04:15,248 --> 02:04:18,127
God, why did You make
this waist? Why?

945
02:04:46,245 --> 02:04:49,249
My heart, my love...

946
02:04:51,384 --> 02:04:54,160
I've given to you

947
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:58,826
My love...

948
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:03,841
what have you done?

949
02:05:04,931 --> 02:05:08,845
When our gaze met,
I realised...

950
02:05:09,535 --> 02:05:13,847
I'm crazy about you

951
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:18,388
It's something my heart knows

952
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:23,252
You're the one
I've taken for my beloved

953
02:06:35,922 --> 02:06:39,529
On your lips, is a smile.
Your eyes hold an intoxication

954
02:06:39,959 --> 02:06:43,930
The sight of you
makes my heart sway

955
02:06:45,231 --> 02:06:49,611
I love you all day and night.
I find peace only after meeting you

956
02:06:50,803 --> 02:06:58,745
Your dark tressses
lend a fragrance to my being

957
02:06:59,846 --> 02:07:04,295
All I wish to say is that
it's your arms I must stay in

958
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:09,229
Don't ever forget
this promise

959
02:07:09,822 --> 02:07:13,964
Don't make me cry,
now that you make me smile

960
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:18,574
Don't make excuses...

961
02:07:19,765 --> 02:07:23,645
don't ever hide
anything from me

962
02:07:30,576 --> 02:07:33,648
My heart, my love...

963
02:07:35,882 --> 02:07:38,658
I've given to you

964
02:08:28,834 --> 02:08:32,646
My dream, my desire...

965
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:37,044
is to adorn your arms
with bridal bangles

966
02:08:38,044 --> 02:08:42,618
These lovely meetings,
I love the way you talk...

967
02:08:43,216 --> 02:08:47,221
Should you consent, my love...

968
02:08:47,553 --> 02:08:51,399
I'd bring the bridal palanquin
to your house

969
02:08:52,725 --> 02:08:57,333
I spend my nights pining.
I dream of marriage

970
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:02,078
My world of love,
you must embellish...

971
02:09:02,735 --> 02:09:06,410
never leave me ever

972
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:11,581
Keep your promises

973
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:16,583
Always hold me in your arms

974
02:09:22,989 --> 02:09:26,493
My heart, my love...

975
02:09:28,494 --> 02:09:31,100
I've given to you

976
02:09:33,366 --> 02:09:36,108
My love...

977
02:09:38,104 --> 02:09:41,108
what have you done?

978
02:09:55,521 --> 02:09:57,125
What is it? What?

979
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:59,793
I tried several times to
meet you at your office

980
02:10:00,126 --> 02:10:02,800
But you staff wouldn't let me.
So...

981
02:10:04,664 --> 02:10:06,666
My name is Karan

982
02:10:08,134 --> 02:10:11,138
Vicky's my friend, sir.
His past is nothing...

983
02:10:11,871 --> 02:10:14,943
at present, he's a student
and he has a very bright future

984
02:10:15,308 --> 02:10:17,151
You don't know that,
but I do

985
02:10:17,476 --> 02:10:20,650
At my age, my father was
even worse off than Vicky is

986
02:10:22,148 --> 02:10:25,152
At this age, even you...
don't take offense

987
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:28,495
You used to be a small-time thug

988
02:10:29,221 --> 02:10:31,565
But I tell you, at your age...

989
02:10:31,724 --> 02:10:35,171
Vicky will be far ahead of you,
me and even my father

990
02:10:37,263 --> 02:10:40,176
Apart from all this,
he has a very kind heart

991
02:10:43,169 --> 02:10:46,173
When a boy falls in love
with a girl...

992
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:50,186
and he finds the girl
without any problem...

993
02:10:52,178 --> 02:10:56,923
imagine how happy it'll make him.
Please don't separate them

994
02:10:57,583 --> 02:10:59,790
Please unite them

995
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:10,936
Your two minutes are up.
Let's go, Gotya

996
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,877
Did he have nothing to say?

997
02:11:17,203 --> 02:11:19,615
Your two minutes are up, he said.
And left

998
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:26,816
All right.
Even if he said nothing...

999
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:30,490
couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

1000
02:11:30,816 --> 02:11:34,229
What?
- I ask...

1001
02:11:34,487 --> 02:11:37,229
couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

1002
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:43,232
If one knew what's on everyone's mind,
there wouldn't be any problem at all

1003
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:45,970
We have these problems
because we don't know

1004
02:11:46,232 --> 02:11:49,236
What do you mean by these problems?
- These problems. Period

1005
02:11:53,239 --> 02:11:55,583
All right. I must leave now

1006
02:12:10,389 --> 02:12:12,266
Did you call ?

1007
02:12:13,526 --> 02:12:14,698
Yes

1008
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:16,270
What for?

1009
02:12:18,631 --> 02:12:21,612
To talk.
- That's what we've been doing

1010
02:12:23,335 --> 02:12:25,815
No, there's something else
I want to talk about

1011
02:12:31,677 --> 02:12:33,953
What is it about?

1012
02:12:36,449 --> 02:12:41,296
She knows... why must she
ask what it's about

1013
02:12:42,421 --> 02:12:44,094
The arrogant one!

1014
02:12:48,694 --> 02:12:51,641
It's about what you think

1015
02:12:54,366 --> 02:12:57,779
I'm thinking about nothing.
You wanted to talk to me

1016
02:12:58,037 --> 02:13:00,039
So tell me what you want to

1017
02:13:19,625 --> 02:13:22,333
ls that what you called me to say?
- Yes

1018
02:14:36,402 --> 02:14:38,939
Your intoxicating eyes...

1019
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,081
your lips...

1020
02:14:49,848 --> 02:14:52,852
there's a huge list
I have of you

1021
02:15:00,793 --> 02:15:04,639
Roma, can you fall in love with me?

1022
02:15:07,433 --> 02:15:09,435
Can you really like me?

1023
02:15:10,703 --> 02:15:12,444
However...

1024
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:20,015
the possibility of me
falling in love with you...

1025
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:27,461
does exist.
- Thanks

1026
02:15:36,462 --> 02:15:41,138
I don't you well, you see.
Let's see each other for a few days...

1027
02:15:41,467 --> 02:15:44,471
and then I'll decide about it.
It'll take a bit of time, okay?

1028
02:15:45,804 --> 02:15:50,480
What's a bit... take all the time.
All my time is now yours

1029
02:15:56,281 --> 02:15:59,819
I feel as if something is
stirred in my heart for you

1030
02:16:01,487 --> 02:16:03,296
Your lovely tresses...

1031
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:06,792
your rose-like lips...

1032
02:16:13,899 --> 02:16:15,901
and this lovely neck and...

1033
02:16:26,512 --> 02:16:31,689
I'm not calling you because
you have a girl in your arms

1034
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:38,093
Neither have I called you because
you're drawing pictures on her body

1035
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:41,535
I haven't called out
to disturb you

1036
02:16:43,529 --> 02:16:47,534
We've got to be at Priya's place
at 7:30. You remember that?

1037
02:16:48,534 --> 02:16:56,214
Karan, who's she? A friend?
- A friend? Oh no, no chance at all

1038
02:16:57,342 --> 02:17:00,880
ls she a lover then?
- Lover...? How disgusting!

1039
02:17:02,347 --> 02:17:06,557
To be my lover,
a girl needs extra qualities

1040
02:17:08,387 --> 02:17:10,298
So who's she?

1041
02:17:14,359 --> 02:17:19,570
She's Khushi. There's nothing else
I know about her

1042
02:17:20,566 --> 02:17:25,174
Karan, just 15 minutes to go
for 7:30. May we leave now?

1043
02:17:31,977 --> 02:17:34,321
When will you meet me again?
- Again...?

1044
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:43,263
At lunch?
- Not lunch. At dinner

1045
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:50,939
At night. Candle-light.
Sunday 10, at my place

1046
02:18:04,710 --> 02:18:06,053
Shall we?

1047
02:18:18,123 --> 02:18:21,002
Today's Sunday.
80...?

1048
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:57,004
It was you who said it...

1049
02:18:57,663 --> 02:18:59,939
Yes, I did, but...

1050
02:20:12,738 --> 02:20:15,344
Whoever you are with,
why must I care?

1051
02:20:30,756 --> 02:20:32,758
Sorry, I'm late

1052
02:20:42,768 --> 02:20:47,547
What happened?
- Last night... nothing

1053
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:55,589
What did Priya have to say?
- She says forget it

1054
02:20:56,615 --> 02:20:58,595
Forget what?
- Love

1055
02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:02,388
Whose love?
- The love Vicky had for Priya

1056
02:21:02,854 --> 02:21:04,800
Priya asks to forget it

1057
02:21:08,794 --> 02:21:10,603
And what did you tell her?

1058
02:21:10,796 --> 02:21:13,402
When she herself isn't interested,
what can I do?

1059
02:21:13,832 --> 02:21:18,178
What is it with girls? Flirt when you
want to, dump the guy when you wish

1060
02:21:19,037 --> 02:21:23,349
Have you girls ever considered
what it does to us guys?

1061
02:21:23,809 --> 02:21:25,618
You're acting like
a very decent guy?

1062
02:21:25,811 --> 02:21:28,223
Do you think I don't know
the truth about you?

1063
02:21:28,613 --> 02:21:31,617
Were you breathing heavily
last night, or weren't you?

1064
02:21:32,317 --> 02:21:33,091
What?

1065
02:21:33,852 --> 02:21:36,093
Were you breathing last night,
or weren't you?

1066
02:21:36,254 --> 02:21:41,169
Breathing? I was breathing last night
and the night before that too

1067
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:45,440
And I breathe every day...
and well at that

1068
02:21:45,831 --> 02:21:48,505
It's good for the health.
ls it bad to breathe?

1069
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:51,838
Maybe it's bad to look at this...
but why's it bad to breathe?

1070
02:21:52,371 --> 02:21:54,578
How will man live
if he doesn't breathe?

1071
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:57,844
Am I the only one who breathes?
Everyone does. Every single day

1072
02:21:58,243 --> 02:22:01,247
Your parents do, so do mine.
Because they breathe...

1073
02:22:01,513 --> 02:22:05,188
you are here, I am here...
so's the dog

1074
02:22:05,851 --> 02:22:09,594
He breathes every day.
Nicely at that. Right puppy?

1075
02:22:10,856 --> 02:22:13,393
See? If you call that bad,
what can I do?

1076
02:22:14,326 --> 02:22:16,863
The breathing I spoke about is
different from the one you allude to

1077
02:22:17,262 --> 02:22:20,675
It's all the same. If breathing
is wrong, everything is wrong

1078
02:22:21,199 --> 02:22:22,803
I'll leave if you talk like this

1079
02:22:27,873 --> 02:22:30,683
I know the suffering of one
truly in love

1080
02:22:31,043 --> 02:22:34,547
Priya's words, weren't they?
So how can she ask us to forget it?

1081
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:37,554
What does it mean?
We have to talk

1082
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:52,436
Today's the last day at college.
It's time to separate

1083
02:22:52,898 --> 02:22:55,242
So come forth and take my blessings

1084
02:23:11,917 --> 02:23:13,590
You been in a crowded train?

1085
02:23:18,490 --> 02:23:21,528
So many of them have
gone into coma for you

1086
02:23:21,927 --> 02:23:26,740
I'm in a coma too. Embrace me
and revive me from the coma, Roma

1087
02:23:33,271 --> 02:23:35,751
Priya's wedding has been fixed

1088
02:23:46,952 --> 02:23:48,954
What are we to do?

1089
02:23:55,427 --> 02:23:56,428
Greetings

1090
02:23:59,297 --> 02:24:01,299
Mr Zorawar Singh... over here

1091
02:24:07,472 --> 02:24:09,975
Where are you going?
To fetch your daughter?

1092
02:24:10,976 --> 02:24:17,257
She's with us right now.
She's marrying the man she loves

1093
02:24:47,679 --> 02:24:50,683
From the look of it, it appears
as if you want to give me a thrashing

1094
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:56,822
Don't even think of it.
Pray to God...

1095
02:24:57,622 --> 02:25:00,626
that I come to no harm.
If something happens to me...

1096
02:25:01,193 --> 02:25:04,436
you'll be the guilty one
in the eyes of the law

1097
02:25:05,163 --> 02:25:07,643
I've made arrangements, you know

1098
02:25:10,101 --> 02:25:13,048
You're picking up something
to throw at me

1099
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:21,719
Forget me...
you can't even touch my image

1100
02:25:28,386 --> 02:25:31,458
Spend a month in Mahabaleshwar
before you return to Calcutta

1101
02:25:32,224 --> 02:25:35,728
Dad has found a job for you
over there. Okay?

1102
02:25:37,062 --> 02:25:39,474
Spend your lives together.
Be happy

1103
02:26:02,287 --> 02:26:07,498
There are problems between
you and Khushi, isn't it?

1104
02:26:10,595 --> 02:26:18,514
You know why man faces problems?
Because he hides his feelings

1105
02:26:19,904 --> 02:26:22,908
If you speak your heart,
you face no problems

1106
02:26:23,108 --> 02:26:25,110
But I don't know why man
doesn't understand that

1107
02:26:25,744 --> 02:26:28,520
He loves someone,
but he pretends to hate her

1108
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:31,522
He hates someone and he pretends
to love her. What for?

1109
02:26:32,784 --> 02:26:38,530
Poor heart. Why do we burden
it with a thousand worries...

1110
02:26:39,124 --> 02:26:44,472
and make life unbearable for it?
If you love her...

1111
02:26:44,629 --> 02:26:47,473
tell her that you love her,
or tell her that you don't

1112
02:26:50,135 --> 02:26:53,139
God has given you eyes to see,
ears to hear...

1113
02:26:54,472 --> 02:26:57,817
and a heart to love

1114
02:26:59,811 --> 02:27:03,554
So forget about egoes
and fall in love

1115
02:27:04,149 --> 02:27:05,560
Love each other

1116
02:27:07,218 --> 02:27:10,825
I've told you how I feel

1117
02:27:35,814 --> 02:27:39,455
You've been a great help in uniting
my friend with his beloved

1118
02:27:47,692 --> 02:27:53,870
Thanks to you too. In uniting
my friend with her beloved...

1119
02:27:57,202 --> 02:28:01,617
you've been a great help.
Thank you

1120
02:30:53,378 --> 02:30:54,789
This is Seema here

1121
02:30:58,182 --> 02:31:00,389
I'm leaving today
- Okay

1122
02:31:00,885 --> 02:31:05,391
I'm leaving and you're just...
- I have another tension, Seema

1123
02:31:28,413 --> 02:31:30,757
Sir, the taxi has arrived

1124
02:31:52,437 --> 02:31:55,850
Karan...?
- He has left for VT Station

1125
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:58,250
Which train is it?
- Howrah Mail at 7:15

1126
02:32:04,849 --> 02:32:06,556
ls Khushi there?
- She has left

1127
02:32:06,618 --> 02:32:08,461
Where to?
- Bombay Central

1128
02:32:09,454 --> 02:32:12,458
Which train?
- Golden Temple Express at 7:10

1129
02:32:44,989 --> 02:32:47,299
Karan...?
- No one has arrived yet

1130
02:33:33,538 --> 02:33:35,950
Was there a girl called Khushi here?
- There's no one

1131
02:34:10,208 --> 02:34:12,586
Maybe he has gone to
Mumbai Central to meet me

1132
02:34:13,578 --> 02:34:16,218
Maybe she has gone to
VT Station to meet me

1133
02:34:16,347 --> 02:34:17,587
And what if he hasn't?

1134
02:34:17,982 --> 02:34:18,983
Now...?

1135
02:34:29,927 --> 02:34:35,001
A girl called Khushi will come here.
Please give her this letter

1136
02:34:37,602 --> 02:34:41,277
A boy called Karan will come here.
Please give him this

1137
02:36:26,344 --> 02:36:28,119
Karan?
- Yes?

1138
02:36:32,049 --> 02:36:36,122
I've been wanting to tell you
something for a very long time

1139
02:36:36,888 --> 02:36:40,131
You know?
I love you, Khushi

1140
02:36:42,827 --> 02:36:45,740
When we were together,
this is what I wanted to say...

1141
02:36:45,963 --> 02:36:49,536
but I never could,
I don't know why

1142
02:36:49,901 --> 02:36:53,405
And now that I want to speak,
you are not with me

1143
02:36:53,604 --> 02:36:56,551
We said so much to each other
when we fought...

1144
02:36:56,741 --> 02:37:02,157
but we couldn't say one single word
to get together. I'm sorry, Khushi

1145
02:37:04,548 --> 02:37:08,155
When I freed my hand from yours
after thanking you...

1146
02:37:08,252 --> 02:37:10,755
I felt something strange
stir in my heart

1147
02:37:10,988 --> 02:37:14,094
I don't know what it was.
But I need you, Karan

1148
02:37:15,927 --> 02:37:21,934
I now realise that the fights
we had was all part of our love

1149
02:37:23,768 --> 02:37:30,185
I need you, Khushi.
To love me, to fight with me

1150
02:37:38,382 --> 02:37:41,420
You're a lucky girl to have
found a father like yours

1151
02:37:41,585 --> 02:37:43,531
Ever since you agreed
to the wedding...

1152
02:37:43,587 --> 02:37:45,794
all he has done is to
look out for suitors

1153
02:37:45,890 --> 02:37:50,202
He decided to have Lali married
the day she returned from the city

1154
02:37:50,294 --> 02:37:53,138
Everything is ready.
The bridegroom, the garland...

1155
02:37:53,297 --> 02:37:56,210
step forward and be garlanded

1156
02:38:07,812 --> 02:38:09,814
La
i! My child!

1157
02:38:10,815 --> 02:38:13,227
You're back! Welcome!

1158
02:38:13,417 --> 02:38:15,988
Go and get ready quickly.
- But Papa...

1159
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:20,225
Just don't worry, my little girl.
The boy I've chosen this time...

1160
02:38:20,825 --> 02:38:23,829
is neither running away
nor leaving behind letters...

1161
02:38:24,061 --> 02:38:26,837
and he's not in love with
another girl either

1162
02:38:27,965 --> 02:38:30,844
Why're you chanting Papa...?
Go and get dressed quickly

1163
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:32,841
Coming!

1164
02:38:45,516 --> 02:38:47,860
Lali, take a look
at your bridegroom

1165
02:38:49,487 --> 02:38:50,864
Take a look at him

1166
02:39:09,874 --> 02:39:12,286
You left this note for him
in the train...

1167
02:39:12,877 --> 02:39:14,879
and he turned out to be
faster than you

1168
02:39:15,179 --> 02:39:19,889
He halted the train and
took a flight to get here

1169
02:39:20,151 --> 02:39:21,892
He has told me everything

1170
02:39:22,053 --> 02:39:25,899
Karan's parents will also be
coming here for the wedding

1171
02:39:26,023 --> 02:39:27,559
Are you happy now?

1172
02:40:40,464 --> 02:40:46,380
This is how two hearts met
and accepted each other

1173
02:40:47,471 --> 02:40:51,385
They're celebrating their
ninth anniversary...

1174
02:40:51,976 --> 02:40:55,389
and they're still fighting
What is surprising is that...

1175
02:40:55,479 --> 02:41:00,394
they haven't one or two kids,
they have 17 children in 8 years

1176
02:41:01,285 --> 02:41:04,994
Twins every year.
But how does it still add up to 17 ?

1177
02:41:05,489 --> 02:41:08,993
Confusing, isn't it?
They didn't fight for a year...

1178
02:41:09,126 --> 02:41:11,003
and they had triplets

1179
02:41:13,230 --> 02:41:18,805
Khushi's expecting again.
Twins or triplets... I don't know

1180
02:41:19,236 --> 02:41:22,410
I'm just looking on
and praying for them

1181
02:41:24,508 --> 02:41:28,422
May Karan keep giving Khushi
this happiness all her life
