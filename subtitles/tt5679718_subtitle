00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,894
IN 1990 - ONE NIGHT

3
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,383
Please cover!

4
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,412
No.10 - Kesavan!

5
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,587
Your wife delivered a baby!

6
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,759
A baby boy!

7
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,424
- Let it dawn. I shall take you there. - Ok, sir.

8
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,476
Go inside and see.

9
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,448
Sign this.

10
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,918
A blessing in disguise... Govt met the expenses
here!

11
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,455
If outside, you'd have had to bear huge
expenses!

12
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,686
Poor fellow! He became a victim!

13
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,327
We would've also done the same thing
if we were in his place.

14
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,655
What will you do if4 - 5 men
try to assault you in the midnight?

15
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,497
He hacked them to defend his life.

16
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,728
Two of them died.

17
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,901
And when others attempted to kill him,

18
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,428
His wife finished off one.

19
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,902
The Court also didn't show any mercy as
they have a revolutionary background.

20
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,717
- Is that your wife?-Hmm.

21
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:56,589
"In the bough of night, the poor female bird
Weaved a nest with pain"

22
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:03,838
"In the nest, the breeze which came
to give company to the young one, rained heat."

23
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:11,574
"Lullabies are sung by someone
for my dear one today."

24
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:18,787
"The male bird which wanders,
will come this way to see you."

25
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,926
"In the bough of night, the poor female bird"

26
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,594
"Weaved a nest with pain"

27
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:32,931
"In the nest, the breeze which came
to give company to the young one, rained heat."

28
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,649
"In his hands, which cradle you with love,"

29
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:31,917
"You must go far away in the sky,"

30
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:39,226
"In a diamond bed given by dream,
to see the shore where love blooms."

31
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,937
"When this song is pressed down, sobbing,

32
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:53,708
in the ears of earth, tell someone my nameless
grief."

33
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,586
I called you here to tell a bad news.

34
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,527
We can't change the law, right?

35
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,826
Our law allows a child to stay with its mother
in Jail only till 5 years.

36
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,836
As you have no kith and Kin
to take over your child,

37
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,170
we are forced to move the child to an
orphanage!

38
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,946
I won't go. I won't go leaving mother.

39
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,048
Don't be adamant, child!

40
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,186
O mother!

41
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,317
I won't go, leaving you, mother.

42
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,321
Come child! Let's go.

43
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,630
Leave m e.

44
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,964
Come child! Come!

45
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,709
- Leave me. - Stop!

46
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,983
Son!
MBRHDRG

47
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,964
Mother! Tell them not to take me.

48
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,163
Oh Janaki!

49
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,975
"On the bosom which it first embraced,

50
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:02,168
and in the smile, the eyes searched first,"

51
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:09,616
"The little koel's heart longs

52
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:16,893
"The gift given by time,
someone stole stealthily"

53
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:23,963
"When the door to the affection
was shut in front,"

54
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:31,335
"The lamp which was kept alight
with prayer by mother, went out"

55
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,605
"In the bough of night, the poor female bird"

56
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,042
"Weaved a nest with pain"

57
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:45,615
"In the nest, the breeze which came
to give company to the young one, rained heat."

58
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:53,261
"Lullabies are sung by someone
for my dear one today."

59
00:10:53,986 --> 00:11:00,904
"The male bird which wanders,
will come this way to see you."

60
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,338
YEARS LATER!

61
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:52,080
Hail God! Please forgive all my sins.
Protect me O Lord!

62
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,485
With an intention that YOU should be
with me always, O God,

63
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,453
I took you away from each and every Sanctum!

64
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,331
As our law, call it as theft, I put an end to it.

65
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,463
I'm again back to Jail after my 7 days parole,

66
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,875
As there are no other idol thieves in this area,

67
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
YOU stay in Peace, O Lord!

68
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,310
Nobody will rob YOU away, O Lord!

69
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,913
All other Lords, please protect this Lord

70
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:20,917
Bless O Lord!

71
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,980
- Greetings! - Greetings!

72
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,490
We are temple committee authorities

73
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,488
If you've finished worship, please come to the
office.

74
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,988
I'm sorry, please!

75
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,719
I can't accept your felicitation now
as I'm running out of time.

76
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,789
Oh! From which Ashram are you coming,
Swamiji?

77
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,894
Viyyur(Jail) is the Origin!

78
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:42,864
Now I am living here
seeing God in each and everything!

79
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,175
If you wish, we can arrange for your stay here.

80
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,401
I stay in a government shelter home.
That is my habit.

81
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,008
If I don't go, they will take me and go

82
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,511
They will take me with beats and drums!

83
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,186
Before I give a chance for that, I need to go.

84
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:57,516
Okay!

85
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:58,517
See you!

86
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,383
Protect us O Lord!

87
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,153
- What a radiance in his face! - Obviously!

88
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,189
CENTRAL JAIL

89
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,829
Stop..Stop.. stop I say.

90
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,560
Will you drop me inside the Cell?

91
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,330
Reached the Sanctum Sanctorum at last!

92
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,195
Come quickly! Let me fasten it.

93
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,497
Has the Idol-thief Saint reached?

94
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,397
Don't turn the Jail day into
your death day? Mind you.

95
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,838
Go and fasten it.

96
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,470
You get lost!

97
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,010
WELCOME TO CENTRAL JAIL!

98
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,778
Welcoming to an Apt Place!

99
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,309
Has he gone into trance while standing?

100
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,213
May I come in, sir?

101
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,313
Let me step in with my right foot.

102
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,781
I stoop my head only here and in Lord's
Sanctum

103
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:35,851
Protect me, O Lord!

104
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,021
Is your obsession with saffron
attire still not changed?

105
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,829
Indulging in any such crimes again?

106
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,166
Now my aim is only Salvation and not
S(te)alvation!

107
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,996
Let me change my dress and go immediately.
I've given my name for running competition.

108
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,929
Kind attention! Those who given
their names for long jump,

109
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,402
please come and collect your
chest numbers as soon as possible.

110
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,016
Next is opening the lock contest!

111
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,421
It's a special contest conducted only for
robbers!

112
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,993
With the help of the iron wire in front of you,

113
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,389
the person who opens the lock first,
will get a prize from me!

114
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,930
- Is it clear to all of you? - Yeah.

115
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,291
All of you take the lock and
the iron wire in your hand!

116
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,230
Take it!

117
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,596
Ready! Ready! Start!

118
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,507
Only the person who opens first
will win the prize.

119
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,608
Up!...Up!

120
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,611
Don't annoy us!
We may lose our concentration.

121
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,017
Come on try to open.

122
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,845
First person who opens it will win a grand
prize.

123
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,382
Sir, I opened it.

124
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,989
- Really? - Here it is!

125
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,620
Let me see! Well done!

126
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:44,556
Really smart!

127
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,987
Now I shall tell you a truth!

128
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,666
This was a part of my investigation to find out
who broke-open the store room lock last week,

129
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,669
although it is not a contest,
I'm going to give him a trophy.

130
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,674
- Come here!-I am coming

131
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,170
Oh my God!

132
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,110
How is the trophy?

133
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,444
This is the most painful ever rolling trophy!

134
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:15,219
You will have to load all
these sacks in the vehicle after sometime.

135
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,218
These are the seeds of tubers for farming

136
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,094
Get inside quickly.

137
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,332
You only have to carry this sack

138
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,266
- Why?-Or else they will find out
that a person is inside.

139
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,506
Come on fast

140
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,672
As promised, reach the cash at my home.

141
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,206
Rs.2000 Cash, one bottle of brandy
and nose stuff to give your father, isn't it?

142
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,206
I already agreed

143
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,537
That is the reason I'm helping you.

144
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,939
Bend yourself. Come on fast

145
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,216
Let me put all this!

146
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:44,953
Hey. Stir it properly!

147
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,390
Hey you! Come here.

148
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,328
- Put those sacks down.-Shucks! Cherian sir!

149
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:55,691
Keep everything there.

150
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,199
It's too heavy!

151
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,502
Your duty is not over here, right?

152
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,694
Then, why are you hanging around here?

153
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,542
You asked me to load all these
sacks in the vehicle outside.

154
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,107
Inside this tank is organic manure,
mixture of cow dung and cow's urine!

155
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,403
Immerse all those sacks in it for a day
and load them tomorrow.

156
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,050
Put all the sacks into this.

157
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,217
Tell him the seed has already sprouted!

158
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,211
He will nip your bud now.

159
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,249
Slowly!

160
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,758
Put that also inside.

161
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,083
No...that's..

162
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,157
What's this, man? Move away.

163
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,197
Put that also into it.

164
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,761
O Lord! Please help this soul!

165
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:35,668
Oh God!

166
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,236
What is this?

167
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,048
O Lord! May there be enough oxygen in the
water!

168
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,784
Looks like some chemical reaction

169
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,514
Not a Chemical reaction! It's Raghavan's
reactionl!

170
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,347
Rag havan?!

171
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,251
If he is not untied immediately, he will die, sir.

172
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,618
- Hey you rascal! - Oh no! it's Organic manure!

173
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,349
Go and rescue him.

174
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,552
- I don't know swimming, sir.
- Oh is this an Arabian sea.

175
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:00,693
Go and help him.

176
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,622
I also don't know swimming.

177
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,426
Unfortunately it is knotted

178
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:10,631
Where am I now?

179
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,439
Turn back and see.

180
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,341
Trying to escape you rascal!

181
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,648
Has anybody else planned to escape? Tell me.

182
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,516
Sugunan also planned to escape.

183
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,776
Don't let him escape.

184
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,053
Sir, he may die.

185
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,447
As it's organic manure, let his hair grow well!

186
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,554
Next is Chest number 66, Sugunan.

187
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,046
Sir! Looks like he's scaling the wall!

188
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,553
Good bye fools!

189
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:04,655
Who are you QUVS?

190
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,126
Bro! Good catch!

191
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,263
Rightly said, bro! Good catch!

192
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:12,663
Roll him up!

193
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,496
Is this called "Police spreading net"?

194
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,668
You want to break the jail!

195
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,406
Don't kill me, sir

196
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,309
I will break your legs!

197
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,272
Will you ever try to abscond?

198
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,349
Severe pain, is it? Any need for it!

199
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,251
- What happened?- Went to act in a video film.

200
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,321
Hit and broke the bridge of his nose!

201
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,360
Taking him to the Jail hospital to reconstruct!

202
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,858
Who broke this bridge?

203
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,457
Superintendent Unnikuttan!

204
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,360
It's like monkey getting a flower garland!

205
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,802
This will happen if a mentally ill person
becomes a Superintendent

206
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,233
Are you trying to shine
when I'm the superintendent here?

207
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,806
Have you come across Police band?

208
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,645
Slowly!

209
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,383
Oh no! Ouch!

210
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,899
L-ley...Stop.

211
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,260
Cut...Cut..

212
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,669
Take him to the doctor.

213
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,666
Didn't I ask you to hit slowly?

214
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,536
I don't know to hit slowly!

215
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,274
Oh no! I know!! I forgot. It's paining.

216
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,908
Oh, is it paining for you

217
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,373
Won't it pain for others also?

218
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,381
This is the 3rd person taken
to hospital because of you!

219
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,473
It was not deliberate, Gopietta.

220
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,383
I'm sorry, sir.

221
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,644
I'm not able to stop beating if I wear this
uniform.

222
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,290
What a thrill!

223
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,457
°h my Gopi sir!

224
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,685
Didn't you find any other person
than this donkey to make a Superintendent?

225
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,384
Hear it

226
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,361
As he was raised up in jail, you
are giving him too much consideration.

227
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,660
It's the result what we see here

228
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,463
Cherian sir always wishes to bully me!

229
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,368
I got this role after pleading so much

230
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,631
I can become a police only like this.

231
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,637
You don't take it to heart

232
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,735
Turn a deaf ear to bad words!

233
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,811
No...Henceforth <i>I will</i> beat him slowly.

234
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,278
We'll start again.

235
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,643
Who will be ready to come
to get beaten up by you?

236
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,676
- Sir, if you bend a little..
- I will give you a punch.

237
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,914
Ramesh, please come buddy.

238
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,451
You come and hit me.

239
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,025
If he comes, I will start hitting him.

240
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,691
Please come, Ramesh

241
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,831
Get Lost! I already have a difficult in passing
urine

242
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,369
Thorappa! Please come.

243
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,362
<i>- I'll</i> serve you Fish head for lunch. - Eh!

244
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,431
Didn't you hear?
He will give you fish head for lunch!

245
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,440
Fish head?! My head is enough for me.

246
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,503
Fearing you, nobody will come now.

247
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,907
Your hit is so hard!

248
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,373
Let's do onething.
We'll take the fight scene later.

249
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,516
Let's take the dialogue portion now.

250
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,684
- I will rock that-Bring that script

251
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,386
- Did you write the dialogues? - Yes.

252
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:22,883
Don't feel offended!

253
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,894
There is not enough punch in your dialogues.

254
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:32,492
Like some films after wearing khakhi
attire some hero delivers dialogues like...shit!

255
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,697
In films, stupid persons will write any
nonsensel.

256
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:36,564
That's right.

257
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,706
You won't get me for that. Do as I say

258
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,576
Not that...for example

259
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,914
"You won't feel the pain
if you touch a khaki-dressed man"

260
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,749
Weren't you shaken up on hearing this
dialogue!

261
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,281
Similarly everyone should be shaken!

262
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,679
Sir, you come up with such dialogues!

263
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,581
You already messed the fight sequence.

264
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,821
Don't poke into this at least

265
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,450
I am not able to do anything
after getting a chance like this

266
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,722
- Shall I do it?-No

267
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,690
Sir, this is going to botch up

268
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,897
Gopinathan, why are you in prisoner attire?

269
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,097
Sir, I'm always in a Police uniform

270
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,406
I wanted a change!

271
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:11,731
Sir, I am a superintendent in this

272
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:12,839
Stop talking

273
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,410
I have given the sanction as you told
this is for prisoners' awareness

274
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,684
It should betelecasted
only after it is shown to me!

275
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,415
What's the name of this telefilm?

276
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:25,580
Jail flowers

277
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,448
What?

278
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:27,919
Jail flowers

279
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,759
Will the name Flowers be apt for such people?

280
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,118
Sir I suggested another name.

281
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:34,623
Iron bars of Prison

282
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,923
But this Gopi sir didn't allow it.

283
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,559
He thinks people may interrupt
in wrong way, right Sir?

284
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:39,935
Hey stop and move away

285
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,596
Come on, let him talk

286
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,099
- Come on say-Nothing to say.

287
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,101
If I tell more then there won't be anything to
say!

288
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,945
Sir, but the freedom to express
is a little less here

289
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:52,706
Does he know all this?

290
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,847
Of course! He was sent to jail
for keeping hidden camera in the bathroom,

291
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,579
<i>Best cameraman'.!</i>

292
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,121
Only one problem, however, he keeps the
Camera, it'll be below the neck only!

293
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,927
That's why we are acting upside down.

294
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,722
You should not be here in such cases again

295
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,490
What will you do if your
wife or sister face similar situation?

296
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,402
Sir, he first kept hidden camera
in his wife's bathroom!

297
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,497
Unfortunately his grandma came for bathing

298
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,139
Ganapathy got what was kept for the crow.

299
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,603
Sir, Crow got what was kept for Ganapathy or
vice versa.

300
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,608
First to whom, sir?

301
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,144
First to you! Shut up!

302
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,948
Well, you guys carry on with your work.

303
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,145
Shall we begin?

304
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,785
Someone please come

305
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,179
Sir, bell is ringing.

306
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,784
We'll have lunch and then continue.

307
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,792
In the pretext of shooting, are they doing
a Muslim dance here forming a circle?

308
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,455
When is my argument? I feel hot in this dress

309
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,600
Let the take get over.

310
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,595
Have lunch and come. Don't change your
costumes.

311
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,598
Yes, you are right!
Do I need to change it, Gopietta..Sir?

312
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,140
Can't I keep wearing it for my life time?

313
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,000
And You continue in this dress!

314
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,940
Giving too much freedom to him!
Let him take undue advantage.

315
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,512
Kitchen duty for you, isn't it?
Go and get the food.

316
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,775
And give it to female block.

317
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,975
You Advocate and Superintendent...get going.

318
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,785
At least this way I can be called
Superintendent!

319
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,616
Shall we cut him saying male goat?

320
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,751
He thinks he is going to be M.T (famous writer)

321
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,856
Take the food to be tested!

322
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,499
Oh!! Is your shooting over?

323
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,032
Not yet! Will resume after the Interval.

324
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,501
However, this costume suits you well!

325
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,501
You're right!

326
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,735
Can't you continue this forever?

327
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,737
If you ask, officers will agree that also,

328
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,443
They have great concern for you.

329
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,511
He requested, but officials disagreed.

330
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,207
Shut up! If I had asked seriously,
they would've agreed.

331
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,212
Am I not the scion ofjail?

332
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,052
Honestly speaking, this is my ancestral home.

333
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,850
Only when I come here,
I feel my parents' presence and smell!

334
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,024
Frankly,
female prison is like my maternal home!

335
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,528
Distributing food in female prison is as good
a feel as giving free food in ancestral temple.

336
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,221
- So any other offering? - Move, man!

337
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,031
If you offer anything else,I will kill you

338
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,202
No wonder he takes up the
others' case on himself to come here.

339
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,201
- He gets good sleep only if he sleeps here!
- Really?

340
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,505
Here is the test food!

341
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,702
Sorry, tasteful food!

342
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,516
Salt is less in this!

343
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,719
It's added in the sam bar (curry)

344
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,053
Anyway we mix everything and eat, don't we?
So please adjust.

345
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,225
In that case, I'll have to mix up things!

346
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,024
See! Salt is perfect in curry, isn't it?

347
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,501
Sir, please test it quickly.
If you are alive, I can distribute to them, right?

348
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,203
Come again!

349
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,869
If you say ok, then I can distribute it to them,
right?

350
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,198
Shooting is not yet over!

351
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,503
Okay, supply the food.

352
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,869
Walk fast! Crows may peck me.

353
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,735
Won't Sun go for any job in the day time?
It flares up!

354
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:38,510
Too hot, isn't it sir!

355
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,737
I will make the rain pour!

356
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,718
Not necessary! To hit me and
make me pass urine, isn't it?

357
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,046
Isn't this disease cured yet?

358
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:45,884
Go and have lunch, dude!

359
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,215
Oh sir, you!

360
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,724
Hey, stand there.

361
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,024
- Hey You! - Sorry, sir. I thought it was Baskaran.

362
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,025
Will not happen again!

363
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,189
Thank heavens! Else another year in Jail!

364
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,032
I'm in big tension, dude! Lengthy dialogue for
me.

365
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,892
You concise it and tell!

366
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,031
I will give you a blow!

367
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,037
Hell with his Video-shoot and acting!

368
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,870
Right from top to bottom,
you have too much of influence.

369
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,046
If I had been the Superintendent here,

370
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,340
I would've put an end to all your tricks in one
shofl

371
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,043
Why are you so angry with me?

372
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,881
I hate all this, your stupid comedy and excess
freedom!

373
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,851
It's not College Campus...
But Jail...Central Jail!

374
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,618
Name itself sounds a TERROR!

375
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,021
You know how thrilling it was before.

376
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,697
Everywhere there was third degree torture

377
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,330
You turned it into a play school! Move!

378
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:33,695
Hey you!

379
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,034
Why playing in water'? Get in.

380
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:36,864
I'm washing.

381
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,338
I will wash you away! Get in I say.

382
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,041
I'm washing my clothes. Or you wash it for me!

383
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,213
Does he know that I wash clothes at home?

384
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:46,348
Hey You!

385
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,885
We need to play atrickon him, dude!

386
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,348
Yes! I will give.

387
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,217
Why walk like nursery kids when I ask you to
go?

388
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:53,052
Move!

389
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,356
Is living in harmony and affection here, wrong?

390
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,192
I got more experience than you in this jail.

391
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,632
That's why higher officials
have soft corner for me.

392
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,367
Or else will they discuss about
your promotion with me?

393
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,796
Did Superintendent sir tell you a word
about my promotion?

394
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,031
Yes! As it's a very confidential official matter,
he asked me not to disclose it.

395
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,869
- Will you disclose? - No..No..tell me.

396
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:15,874
- Sure? - I promise.

397
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,876
The fact is..Oh no! My belt loosened

398
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,047
<i>I will</i> put it for you.

399
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,215
Don't sit this way! People may mistake you.

400
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,214
You hold this. <i>I will</i> put on my belt.

401
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,221
Sir, the matter is..

402
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,720
- Unable to buckle it.
- Do that later, tell me this.

403
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,061
While I was working in Superintendent sifs
room last day,

404
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,355
He asked me what is my opinion about you!

405
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:35,060
And what did you say?

406
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,358
I said, "Although he shouts at me all the time,

407
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,793
he is very devoted to work"

408
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,903
Sir also asked me whether
Cherian takes bribes from prisoners relatives?

409
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,073
Do you take bribes, sir'?

410
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,072
No! I've not taken any bribes.

411
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,074
Who the hell complains about me!

412
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,077
You go and have lunch!
Don't waste your life being too diligent.

413
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,374
Come to this matter.

414
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:57,385
Did you take any bribe from the relatives
of that liquor contractor?

415
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,312
When they came up with an offer
I told them not from here!

416
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,049
I meant, I told them right on their face,
that I don't want anything from here.

417
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,285
But here there is a gossip
that you've taken bribe!

418
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,464
Only because of that, your promotion
hangs in the air - give or not, give or not...!! ..

419
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,455
Please fix it

420
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,901
Let me first fix this. Will you help?

421
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:13,901
Thank you!

422
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:14,467
Then, what happened?

423
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:18,066
What else to happen? Ultimately they
decided not to give you Promotion.

424
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,072
- Oh! Thank you! - It's okay.

425
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,244
What are you up to, sir?

426
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:28,077
Oh my goodness! If you do my work,
then don't I have to do your job?

427
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,911
Please move, <i>I will</i> carry

428
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,485
You are very selfish!
Want to do everything alone!

429
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,249
Won't you be coming there after distributing
here..

430
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,823
I'll serve you stomach full
of what you are destined!

431
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,094
Move, Rascal!

432
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,228
A big mess!

433
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:44,290
Shall we fill your stomach?

434
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,060
I meant, Food has come...Fill your stomach

435
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,463
Oh...my! For the time being,
let me put my hands in pocket and adjust.

436
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:50,372
Get in.

437
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,366
Dude! Beating is for sure.

438
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,903
We'll suffer if he has work here.

439
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,374
We'll have to screw him well!

440
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,919
If you eat like this, then you will not be there
to serve your life sentence.

441
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,386
If this continues, Jail will run at a loss then!

442
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,889
- Come here! -What is all this?

443
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,722
I was about to salute you! Any Fancy dress?

444
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,891
- How is this? - Splendid!

445
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,063
Gopi sifs video film!

446
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,361
- Com petitons are over?
- Yes Kayika(Sports) are over.

447
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,328
KAAI KARI (VEG ETABLES)Competitions?

448
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,062
Nonsense! Sports competition!

449
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,367
Unni kutta, I won 1st prize
in the Paddy pot contest!

450
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,903
You have a good aim.

451
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,079
Didn't you break your husband's
forehead with a shot by a Pestle?

452
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,372
That too in the dark!

453
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,077
Look at her pride!

454
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,908
I'm 1st in APPAM(Pancake)eating contest.

455
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,379
Is there APPAM(FATHER)Biting contest also?

456
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,378
- Pancake eating! - I see!

457
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,255
Play with your age people

458
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,559
Well, who has occupied my mother's cell now?

459
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,057
It's that lady.

460
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,565
- My mother also will not forgive you. - Why?

461
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,328
Don't occupy such persons in her cell.

462
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,900
Tell the Superintendent!

463
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:53,899
To get thrashings?

464
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,901
- Can't he do it, knowing one's mind?
- Yes, Yes.

465
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,074
I'm getting released next week.

466
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:03,076
What is the use? You'll be back soon
taking up someone else's case!

467
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,839
As if! I will not take over all stupid cases!

468
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,515
It's for the boy who pursued to become a
Doctor.

469
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,918
Someone trapped him.

470
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,088
That is why I confessed
I kept the Ganja in his bike.

471
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,348
Had I not taken up this case,
this world would have lost a doctor!

472
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,354
Yes Yes!

473
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,254
Enough..Enough.

474
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,392
Trying to get into good books
of all the officers here.

475
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,231
Don't trust him.

476
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,501
If we stoop a little,
he will fire crackers even on our butt!

477
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,063
Being the son of criminals,
it's no wonder if he's a criminal too.

478
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,067
What's this sir.

479
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,398
Is it enough if we stand like this,
shouldn't we see?

480
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,073
What do you mean?

481
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,900
During free time, don't we have
to see with our families!

482
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,405
My wife is a good cook

483
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,908
Are you fine?

484
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,512
Misbehaving and asking whether I'm fine?

485
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,075
- Anything wrong? - What happened?

486
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,913
He touched my back!

487
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,248
Shame!

488
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,079
You lass! Don't talk nonsense.

489
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,277
So you can do dirty things, is it?

490
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,258
Back means exactly at which portion..

491
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,390
Don't you understand that it was on her butt!

492
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,597
So incident happened on her butt

493
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,092
Hey, Jokes apart! This is a serious matter.

494
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,098
O my girl! Where did I touch you?

495
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,101
Madam, please listen...
you also listen..All of you listen.

496
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,399
Dear, turn that side.

497
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,271
While stretching my hand,
I might've accidentally touched her like this.

498
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,108
Or the tip of the finger might've
accidentally touched her this way.

499
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,408
And not with any purpose Itouched her like
this.

500
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,947
He is touching her again and again
continuously.

501
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,950
Is this, his only business?Still...

502
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,089
Oh my God! Superintendent sir is coming.

503
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,419
Don't tell all this to sir!
This poor sir will lose his job.

504
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,257
Really? Wait, I will show you!

505
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,598
Please tell her...O my girl! Don't complain!

506
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,932
Is this, your only business?
Why are you misbehaving with ladies?

507
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,262
If that girl com plains about me to
Superintendent, I will lose my job.

508
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,404
Sir, why are you scared? Are we not
standing beside witnessing everything?

509
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,403
Then, okay.

510
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,405
- You guys noticed me doing anything? - Oh no!

511
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,945
- So you did it without our notice, is it? -Hmm!

512
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:48,412
Come!

513
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,685
Oh my God! He is coming...coming

514
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,281
Please tell him.

515
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,286
Let me ask him.

516
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,127
Is there any truth in her complaint?

517
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,262
Certainly, sir! We saw"

518
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,260
...him catching hold of it!

519
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,928
- You!! - True, is it?

520
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,259
You are suspended.

654
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,177
Your son has come to see you.

655
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,587
Mother's leg pain is not yet cured.

656
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,692
Arthritis! But she says, doesn't matter.

657
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,192

660
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,505
Proposals gets rejected
when they come to know her father is in jail.

661
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,870
I became the victim for the misrepresentation
caused by my fellow workers in the Bank.

662
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,507
I'm innocent.

663
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,213
It's not necessary that they should know.

664
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,046
Ultimately a proposal got clicked
after offering prayers to God!

665
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,879
Groom is in Muscat! Only has 1 month's leave.

666
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,188
Will take her along with him after marriage.

667
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,852
Without even discussing with you, I fixed it.

668
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,854
Good! What is there to discuss with me?

669
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,026
Coming 25th is the marriage.

670
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,859
Thank heavens! Ultimately her marriage got
fixed.

671
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,260
I had too many dreams of her marriage.

672
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,868
As it is my daughter's marriage,
I would definitely get 7 days parole at least.

673
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,700
I shall forward the request today itself.

674
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,703
Please don't feel offended.

675
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,511
You don't come, father!

676
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,518
The reason is, I told the groom's people, my
father"

677
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:57,222
...my father is dead!

678
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,493
I'm sorry, father.

679
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,865
With the intention of giving her a good life,
I was forced to tell this.

680
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,506
Don't worry, my dear son.
You told the truth, isn't it?

681
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,870
Your father died year ago, right?

682
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:22,707
Doesn't matter! Standing in my place,
you perform her wedding in a grand manner.

683
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:28,053
I will pray to God for the wedding to get on
well!

684
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,025

689
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,710
But I'm not attending.

690
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,207
My son compelled me a lot!
No, It won't work out.

691
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,713
When I go there,

692
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,354
each and everybody would start
asking my life in jail,

693
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,853
Why be a black sheep there?

694
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,026
Don't talk like that! You must attend it.

695
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,323
No need!

696
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,194
- You are getting released tomorrow,
aren't you? - Hmm!

697
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,030
You must attend my daughtefs wedding.

698
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:20,334
And when you come the next time,
tell me everything in detail.

699
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,213
That is enough for me! More than enough for
me!

700
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:28,345
Poor man!

701
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,220
His son would've told him not to come!

702
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,050
- Hold it! - Throw!

703
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,226
Hold this also. Come on.

704
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,190
Hail my Central Goddess! Hail my Jail Lord!
May I come back soon,

705
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,870
With decent cases!

706
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:49,867
See you bro!

707
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:51,035
See that you don't be back!

708
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,037
Don't say anything with your evil tongue.

709
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,703
What's this, Unnikutta?

710
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,705
Don't you know there will not be
any thrill in your absence?

711
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,647
Won't I be back immediately?

712
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,646
Like the way we hang around out
when we get bored of sitting at home,

713
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:04,647
Assume it that way.

714
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:08,048
When you come the next time,
try to come with life sentence!

715
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,350
In that case, you don't have
to walk out now and then.

716
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,058
No Chance! I will never
take up cases like Rape and Murder.

717
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,627
- Aren't you interested?-No.

718
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:15,225
Smart boy!

719
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,730
If you wish, I will do the rape,
just take the blame.

720
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,226
If so, I shall also join you.

721
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:20,230
Get lost!

722
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:24,093
What is wrong with you people? Let him
breathe in fresh air at least for some days.

723
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,368
As if there is something wrong with the air
here.

724
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:26,366
Is it not the best air here?

725
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,742
Best hydrogen!

726
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,905
Stop talking and unload the things.
I shall also help you.

727
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:31,909
Say something good like that.

728
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,911
Don't mess up in the Kitchen in my absence.

729
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,913
Prepare everything well.

730
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,912
Don't forget what I said!

731
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,448
Your mothers medicine, right? I remember.

732
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:41,446
It should reach her hands safely, right?

733
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,391
Not that! It seems old hag
received her pension amount.

734
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,055
Get it while coming.

735
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,726
Such bunches are seen only while loading.

736
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,899
Till now, we haven't got even
a single banana roast!

737
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,728
Who knows to whose Fort it is going!

738
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:55,463
Let officers don't hear it!

739
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,234
Had we got the talent of finding this,
we will also become Police!

740
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,374
Both of you load all the sacks inside.

741
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,375
- Yes right! - Yes.

742
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,076
Pass the banana bunch here.
I need to go and come back immediately.

743
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,247
Take it.

744
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:09,079
Pass it here.

745
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,911
Don't forget to attend my daughtefs wedding.

746
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,247
Forget? No way I!

747
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,257
I'm also presenting her a gift on your behalf.

748
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:17,924
May the Lord protect you!

749
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,293
Very pleasant like rocking the baby's cradle!

750
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,226
Pass it here.

751
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:26,727
Yes, sir!

752
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,071
Thank you very much! My suspension is
withdrawn.

753
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,068
Here I'm joining my duty prosperously

754
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,237
Okay then. <i>I will</i> come and see you. Okay.

755
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,073
Keep aside the pumpkins.

756
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,742
<i>I will</i> set him right today

757
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:42,383
Catch!

758
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:44,248
Hey you!

759
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,256
Oh no!

760
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:51,322
Sir fell!

761
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,051
Oh, the big pumpkin fell!

762
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,230
Looks like he kicked the bucket!

763
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,724
- Air comes out from his nose. - Lift him.

764
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,500
Don't gape! Carry him.

765
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,492
Damn heavy!

766
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,733
- Now it's clear to which fort BANANA goes!
- Yes Yes

767
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,900
Will they give us a holiday in case he's dead?

768
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,508
Go quickly! Othenlvise, you will have
to pay for the vegetables.

769
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,071
Poor fellow! After Suspension,
it is SICK Leave now!

770
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,079
Shucks! People here are roaming around
without doing any work

771
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,346
Can't they come to the jail at least?

772
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,148
- Forwhat?- To be in high spirits!

773
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,551
Greetings-Oh you reached?

774
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,117
How many days will you be here?

775
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,226
Not yet decided.
I will go back if get bored.

776
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:29,897
Key.

777
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,798
Did you forget to take the key
from Ramani's house like last time?

778
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,896
The shop will be filled with dust and cobweb!

779
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,231
- You could've cleaned it, right?
- Oh, is that my work?

780
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,370
I can sleep only after cleaning the entire dust.

781
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,344
Can't you stay in that house after renovating it?

782
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,479
Where do I have money for that?

783
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,584
My fathefs shop is there
for short visits, right?

784
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,515
- It's better to stay in Jail
-I really like that

785
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:55,355
Take it

786
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,192
Oh God, my dad and mom,
are getting eaten by termites.

787
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,557
Fortunately, head still there!

788
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,404
Please laminate this photo in some studio.

789
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,900
Otherwise termites will eat again.

790
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,971
What wrong have I done towards these
termites?

791
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,504
If you keep going to jail for others' sake,

792
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,844
everything here will be damaged by termites!

793
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,308
Try to do some business
in this shop and live here

794
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,315
Please advise him like that.

795
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,351
- Everyone says he is mad - That's right.

796
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,390
From childhood, Central Jail had began
to grow his mind!

797
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,620
He will reform only if this goes out of his mind.

798
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,227
Whenever I feel I've nobody here,
I go to the place where my parents lived!

799
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,592
Shall I call you dad from today?

800
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,400
Oh, no...No need! Even othenlvise
my wife has doubts on me!

801
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,104
You married her when she came here
for taking measurement.

802
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,399
So that doubt will always be there

803
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,605
To get rid of the thought
of not going to the jail

804
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,637
I'll tell you a trick

805
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,845
You have to find a girl who loves
you and whom you love, immediately!

806
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,847
Then, you have to marry her.

807
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,214
You will never feel that you don't have anyone.

808
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:03,083
You are right!

809
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,588
How it is possible?
Did they think about such things?

810
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:11,257
Without finding a bride for their son
who's crossed marriageable age,

811
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,263
they both have gone and become a picture!

812
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:17,598
Can't they find out an idiotic bride from
abode of gods or from underground?

813
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:18,500
So you want an idiotic girl?

814
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,270
Then no need! Let her be an auspicious girl!

815
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,934
Wow...You showed me the girl as soon as I
asked!

816
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,333
What are you blabbering alone?

817
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:48,936
Have you really gone crazy?

818
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:53,941
If now, I can take him to hospital by walking!

819
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:55,943
Oh God What happened?

820
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,114
Brother

821
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,647
- Brother!-Oh God

822
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,187
Kid's head has gone

823
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,353
Only in the photo, right?

824
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,519
Please restore this photo and laminate it

825
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,492
Then this one, enlarge this
picture and laminate

826
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,103
Any advance needed?

827
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,204
What you told?

828
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,339
Any advance needed?

829
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,373
Not that, what should I do with these photos?

830
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,936
You don't have memory even though
your Studio's name is ORMA (Memory)

831
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,144
These photos need to be laminated

832
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,382
So don't you want to take photo, son?

833
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,715
Oh...ok! As I've come anyway, let me take a
photo!

834
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,511
Come

835
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,753
Since this is an old building,
there is leakage I suppose!

836
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,224
So I have to hold this while
taking photograph, right?

837
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,229
Hey, what are you doing? You keep it there

838
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:49,487
- That's for lights-Oh sorry

839
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,528
- So you kept this so that light won't get wet!
- You sit there

840
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:05,779
Are you not taking picture?

841
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,373
I don't take nowadays due to bad sight!

842
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:09,416
I'll call the owner

843
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,377
So, he has both poor eyesight as well as poor
memory!

844
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,686
Does he charge less for this?

845
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:33,202
Oh...Oops

846
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,297
Whom are you looking for?

847
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,132
Are you the owner of this studio

848
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:02,632
Why?

849
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,640
I never expected you here

850
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,473
While you were going in a 2-wheeler,
I was wondering who you were?

851
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,236
We couldn't get acquainted!

852
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,502
I know you well

853
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,307
How do you know me?

854
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,040
I used to see you in newspapers and TV.

855
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,041
Oh

856
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,378
When there's a case, the Manorama
and Mathrubhoomi papers publish my photo!

857
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,249
But I keep a distance with English Newspapers.

858
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,788
They always talk English only
I'm learning English through postal!

859
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:25,683
So what do you want?

860
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:26,627
Half or full?

861
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:27,855
Oh I don't take drinks

862
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,626
I mean photo

863
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,198
You can take as your wish

864
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,525
- Your name?-Radhika

865
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:34,529
Radhika, you can take picture as you like

866
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,420
- This button...-I will unbutton it soon

867
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,526
- You told me to unbutton it right?
-Button your shirt

868
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:05,791
Oh is that what you meant?

869
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,632
If I button this I will surely die

870
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,207
It's okay...it's okay. Just sit

871
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,792
Shall I come here frequently and take snaps

872
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,386
If you don't like then I won't

873
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,427
Then I will come here frequently
and take the copy of this

874
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,230
I'd already informed him to laminate this photo.

875
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,804
I guess he has a bad memory. Is he your
father?

876
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,301
- He is my father's- Father's Yam a?

877
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,139
Joseph brother has been here from the time
when my father was here!

878
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,572
This is my dad and mom.

879
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,147
I feel sad that I couldn't take a snap with them!

880
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,818
What to do! Not lucky!

881
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:01,948
Then come next week

882
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,923
Oh God, Kaderikka's daughter's marriage

883
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:24,642
Dear, this is Unnikuttan

884
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,443
This is a gift from your dad!

885
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,755
He asked me to tell you
that this gift contains love of a lifetime!

886
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:29,537
"Why does the lovely bird in my heart flutter its
wings"

887
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,838
"Weaving a nest with leaves in the dreams,
why this swinging?"

888
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,913
"A sparkling in the eyes?"

889
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:41,045
"Dancing on my tender lips,
did honey tell a love story?"

890
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:46,885
"Why is the breeze showering fragrance here?"

891
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:52,523
"Why is the breeze showering fragrance here?"

892
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,835
"Spring season has come to my door again"

893
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,699
"Cool breeze is wafting here"

894
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:29,835
"Jasmine, don't wither in rain, sun or grief"

895
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:33,040
"My shadow is your shelter"

896
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,737
"I am your lovely umbrella"

897
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:41,573
"Didn't you save my desire from withering
by the shade of your umbrella?"

898
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:47,483
"Always your beauty is your heart
which is like fresh, tender sprouts"

899
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:53,122
"Forgetting to sleep I sat remembering you"

900
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:58,125
"Why does the lovely bird in my heart
flutter its wings"

901
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,992
"Weaving a nest with leaves in the dreams,
why this swinging?"

902
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,100
"A sparkling in the eyes?"

903
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:09,568
"Dancing on my tender lips,
did honey tell a love story?"

904
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:14,843
"Cool breeze is wafting here"

905
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:32,830
"Unknowingly you filled my heart"

906
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:38,832
"With desires, I waited aeons to see you"

907
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:44,144
"Didn't I search for colours
in the days, nights and twilights?"

908
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:50,474
"I drew your portraits on stone-walls
and the wall of my heart"

909
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:55,850
"I will caress you every day,
sealing your lips with mine"

910
00:56:56,179 --> 00:57:00,650
"Why does the lovely bird in my heart
flutter its wings"

911
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,088
"Weaving a nest with leaves in the dreams,
why this swinging?"

912
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,491
"A sparkling in the eyes?"

913
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:12,435
"Dancing on my tender lips,
did honey tell a love story?"

914
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:18,835
"Why is the breeze showering fragrance here?"

915
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,481
"Cool breeze is wafting here."

916
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:36,727
I'm here. -Oh!

917
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:42,729
Have a look!

918
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,201
Splendid!

919
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:51,872
- How is this?-Whoa!

920
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,441
Now such things are possible!

921
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:01,587
Hasn't your depression of not taking
a snap with your parents, gone now?

922
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:05,192
Thank you!

923
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,859
She is indeed the girl showed
to me by my parents!

924
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,867
She falls into my sight wherever I go.

925
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,861
- One thing I decided. - What?

926
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:16,697
I am sure, she is my girl.

927
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,269
Is it enough if you alone tell this?
Know what is in her mind also.

928
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,874
Moreover if you go to jail frequently
girls may not like it.

929
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,104
But I don't go there doing crimes, do I?

930
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:32,048
I go to Jail only for the sake of poor people
who get hooked into case accidentally!

931
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:36,482
Can't say, maybe this can also turn out
to be your plus point.

932
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,621
These days, girls love even goondas!

933
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,123
Any bastard or scoundrel will find a girl!

934
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,490
Even my father found one, then why won't you?

935
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:45,491
<i>That's ck'.!</i>

936
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,696
- She is also like me, dude!
- How?Does she have a moustache like you?

937
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,000
I didn't mean that.

938
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,773
She doesn't have father and mother!

939
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,700
Lives in her uncle's home.

940
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,704
Her only earnings, is the Studio
which her father had run.

941
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,046
So there is no chance of showing any pride.

942
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,884
Even if I get a slap,
I will open my heart to her tomorrow.

943
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,890
Are you going to OPEN or BREAK?

944
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:10,850
"Famous film actor Guiness Pakru is going to
inaugurate the ice-cream parlour"

945
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,762
I started my business as an icecream seller
at age of 15,

946
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,166
In Commemoration of that I started this.

947
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,994
Running an Ice cream parlour
has been my 25 years' dream!

948
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:25,202
That's why named it Swapnam (Dream)!
Understood?

949
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,034
Hi friend, what's up?

950
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,169
Your grandma delivered a baby.

951
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,710
Buffalo delivered at my home.

952
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:32,739
Hen has got breast!

953
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,706
What else do you like to know? Get lost, rascal!

954
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,078
This will also vanish like ice cream!

955
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,786
O God! May it not be an evil tongue!

956
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,616
Please protect me, O Lord!

957
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:45,188
Hi Unnikutta

958
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,285
Have an ice cream!

959
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,129
Artist Guinness Pakru is going to inaugurate

960
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,263
Inauguration is at 10.30, right?

961
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,860
I will reach here like a hurricane
at the right time!

962
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:52,759
I must go now.

963
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,865
Don't forget to come! We need to rock!

964
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:55,796
Definitely!

965
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:32,304
Where did she disappear'?

966
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,636
Told that she'd come here with the camera

967
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,344
Did she came to take snaps of monkeys
in the forest?

968
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,145
Instead why can't she take my photo?

969
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:41,938
See, she is running away with shyness!

970
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,046
Who is that?

971
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:27,724
Radhika, run away! Fast

972
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:52,079
Give way! The person whom you were longing
to see, has reached.

973
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,454
Did you plan to invite Mr.Suresh Gop
I for the inauguration?

974
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,295
Why do you ask?

975
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,797
I asked as the ribbon is tied so high

976
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,363
Everything will be set right on time!

977
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,811
You invited me here to cut the plants?

978
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:20,376
Why?

979
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,077
Didn't you get a bigger one than this?

980
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:27,752
I normally use tiny moustache
trimming scissors for inauguration.

981
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,284
Is it? I will arrange it right now!

982
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:30,891
Hurry up! Hurry "P!

983
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,730
Up! Chair up! Thank you

984
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,463
This is my first business

985
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,103
Don't worry! Whatever I touched so far,

986
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:51,902
has not gone up in smoke till now.

987
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,909
Thank heavens! Please protect me O Goddess!

988
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,084
I'm going to cut

989
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,059
Oh my Wis!

990
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,162
Who the hell is that?

991
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:20,371
O my God! Who is this?

992
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:29,373
Oh God! My dream shattered!
How will I bear it?

993
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,811
Someone help me.

994
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:36,821
O my nose!

995
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:38,824
Oh God! Blood!

996
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,489
Please help me

997
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:46,366
Why the hell are you hitting him?

998
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,394
Oh my shop!

999
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:52,906
<i>Don“: throw.</i>

1000
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,336
Enough! Now bring me down.

1001
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:03,508
Oh my God! My shop!

1002
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:19,399
O Unnikutta! With what difficulty...

1003
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,110
Are you hitting us after inviting?

1004
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:39,510
You hit me?

1005
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,584
Come for the inauguration! Get out.

1006
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,389
Get lost you elf!

1007
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:52,625
Let my head not get hurt

1008
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,270
My Shop is gone!

1009
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:58,996
At least let me save the commemoration.

1010
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:20,926
Why is it so crowded here?

1011
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:22,593
I need to get down, please.

1012
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,495
Oh God! I was invited for the
shop inauguration at 10.30 am

1013
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,664
Shivanchettan!
Why are you seated on the roof top?

1014
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,169
Shouldn't we inaugurate at 10.30?

1015
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,103
Where to inaugurate?
I will take you to task today.

1016
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,614
Sir, I have reached.

1017
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,286
Greetings sir! Why did you call me sir'?

1018
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:47,352
Oh, he's come!

1019
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,390
Sir, did you recover the body of the person
who drowned in the river last day.

1020
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,351
That is your...!!

1021
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:52,582
I've never come across such a person.

1022
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,520
Oh no! Shivaettan! What is around your neck?

1023
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:56,521
SNAKE!

1024
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,359
When he promised to reach at the right time,

1025
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,092
I never thought it was for destroying my shop.

1026
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,397
My 25 yrs' dream, Hand, Neck..and

1027
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,943
in front of girls, my age - all ruined by him, Sir!

1028
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,605
Some evil eyes had cast on my Shop's name.

1029
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,943
Again it turned into a DREAM!

1030
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,115
Still for a case, destroying a shop
at the time of inauguration was a big deceit!

1031
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,682
No sir, it's not for a legal case!

1032
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:25,348
It happened when I tried to nab a fellow
who attempted to kill a girl.

1033
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,590
However I'm going to charge
a Case based on his complaint.

1034
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:31,128
Please don't do it, sir!
It's risky if I go to jail now.

1035
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,594
That poor girl's life will be in danger.

1036
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,634
So please don't register any case.

1037
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:35,666
How is that possible!

1038
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,362
I will give whatever he needs

1039
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:37,765
Again?

1040
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,663
I mean <i>I will</i> rebuild your shop.
I'll pay you the full compensation

1041
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:44,107
- If you can do it, it's fine!
-I will! Please don't charge any case.

1042
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,507
Surprisingl! Is that you, who voluntarily ask
for cases, saying this?

1043
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,146
In this situation, I must be present here.

1044
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:52,215
Besides, you must also give her police
protection.

1045
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,555
But that girl has not even
lodged any complaint here.

1046
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,782
I'll make her give.

1047
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,158
What do you say, then?

1048
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,261
If the case goes to the Court,
Compensation amount will be delayed

1049
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,226
I only want my shop to be rebuilt!

1050
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,401
Then, for my next inauguration
I must not see you in this town.

1051
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,500
Igive my word!

1052
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,499
But until I'm here, you
shouldn't host any inauguration.

1053
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,271
Sacred bell hits me back!

1054
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,638
Being violent you are hung like this

1055
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:21,679
Who are you? What do you want?

1056
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,017
- Is this Radhika's house?-Yes

1057
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,114
I am Radhika's friend.
Can you call her'?

1058
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:30,115
She is not here now

1059
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:31,287
Where has she gone?

1060
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,525
- I want to see her urgently
.-She might have boarded the train.

1061
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,295
She got a job in Delhi.

1062
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,532
Oh Goddess, slipped off from my hand!

1063
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,461
What?

1064
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,533
Any contact number?

1065
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,137
Tell me the matter,
I will convey when she calls

1066
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,304
That won't work out if you tell!

1067
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,541
- My Aél love you' has gone! - Who is he?

1068
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,643
Forget it. If not her, someone else!

1069
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,316
Don't become sentimental thinking over it!

1070
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,843
There is something fishy!

1071
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,122
Who came to kill her?

1072
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,293
Why did he try to kill her?

1073
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,525
Don't keep asking questions like in TV serials?

1074
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,753
You leave this topic!

1075
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,856
You can say so!

1076
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,666
She is my first love

1077
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,667
It's paining to know that she left!

1078
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,665
Why should I be here?
I am going back to my ancestral home

1079
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:22,308
Which ancestral home?

1080
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:23,771
- Jail-Jail?

1081
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,810
I've seen heights of madness! But like this...

1082
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,317
Oh Jesus, What if I throw him to this stream?

1083
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,581
- The searched creeper is on my feet
- Which creeper?

1084
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:33,820
See

1085
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,152
Original police!

1086
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:37,683
- Stop-Stop the vehicle

1087
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:39,689
Greetings sir

1088
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,692
- What happened?
- Sir, I want to tell you something

1089
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,696
Do you think it's a transport bus
to wave hands and stop?

1090
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,529
Please arrest me again
for the case of destroying that shop

1091
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:50,701
I don't feel peaceful here

1092
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:53,874
I am not here to dance to your tunes. Get lost

1093
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,311
Sir, please, you can even say in channels
that you overpowered me with great effort

1094
01:08:58,334 --> 01:08:59,312
Sir, you will be famous then

1095
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,478
You get lost, don't provoke me
otherwise I will put you into the jeep!

1096
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,150
That's what I want, Sir!

1097
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,315
Please lift me, Sir!

1098
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,552
Sir, can you somehow put me in central jail.

1099
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,849
You'll get good deeds, please sir!

1100
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:11,884
Will you go?

1101
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,259
Trying to make me lose my job! You swine!

1102
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,587
- Take the vehicle -Are you leaving me like this?

1103
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,232
- No sportsman spirit! -What happened?

1104
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,532
Policemen have become Saints!

1105
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:27,534
- You know to write a petition?
- Hmm, written many against my father!

1106
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,405
Can you give a petition against me?

1107
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:30,235
Why dude?

1108
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,541
- For beating and hospitalising you!
- But I'm not in hospital now

1109
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,179
You are going to be hospitalized!

1110
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:36,372
Don't do such idiotic things.

1111
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,318
I need a reason, dude

1112
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,380
<i>I will</i> go mad if I remain here!

1113
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,579
He's really gone mad!

1114
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:44,880
What should I do to go back to jail?

1115
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,299
See there!

1116
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:57,634
Hit him. He is a gentleman.
He will give case against you.

1117
01:09:58,761 --> 01:09:59,296
See how you are getting cases?

1118
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:02,968
Oh no, he is a disabled person!

1119
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,307
This will make the case stronger!

1120
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,668
Two cases against you.

1121
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,747
For assaulting a person for no reason
and second, hitting a disabled one.

1122
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,449
To come out of the case, you need to beg him!

1123
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:13,785
You're correct!

1124
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,917
See God appears in many forms!

1125
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,326
- You be a witness! - Of Course!

1126
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:23,959
Hey, you hang around without doing work, ah?

1127
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,298
I am going for work.

1128
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:26,659
He'll go at times!

1129
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:29,961
Oh, I see! When we are hanging around without
work,

1130
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:31,527
you are going for work!

1131
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,611
Rip his bones!

1132
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,642
Why you are beating me unnecessarily?

1133
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:45,818
Charge a case against me for assaulting you

1134
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:47,484
- Oh So that's the reason-Yes

1135
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:48,913
I will finish off this case right now

1136
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:50,318
Dad

1137
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,827
Come here

1138
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:55,851
I am a sick person

1139
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:58,798
Are you a sick person?

1140
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:05,667
You come here

1141
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,673
- Want a case? Give a complaint
- Oh I have no complaint

1142
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,344
- Give a complaint against me
-I have no complaints

1143
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,346
You dog, take my slippers!

1144
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,739
I have two! I'll wear this also.

1145
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,981
- What is your line of job?
- I am a martial art teacher

1146
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:26,326
Oh God!

1147
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:27,884
Thank god, I didn't interfere in this.

1148
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:31,558
Hey panji...

1149
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,994
- Are you mocking at me, you swine - Oh
no...no!

1150
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,735
- My leg got hurt! - Let me finish him today.

1151
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:39,865
Brother you alone limp and go. You go bro!

1152
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:41,397
Didn't you tell he is a very decent fellow?

1153
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:45,004
Yeah, he is!
Othenivise he might have killed you.

1154
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,746
Neither a document nor a helmet.

1155
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:54,854
You come.

1156
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,358
Brother is it a real banana?

1157
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,327
No, I made this in the morning.

1158
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,887
- I asked if it was organic - What?

1159
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:06,799
After eating this, will my organ fail?

1160
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,892
That I don't know. I have stolen this.

1161
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:10,726
You thief!

1162
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:12,803
- What you want? - Nothing, you dog!

1163
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,333
Your documents are not correct. Pay money

1164
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:22,348
- Thank you sir-Okay

1165
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:24,612
- Today collection is very bad! -How much?

1166
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,583
Hail God AyyaPPa!

1167
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,014
What is special in ancestral home?

1168
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,755
No news! Where are you now?

1169
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,122
- In hometown -Are you not coming?

1170
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,920
So boring without you.

1171
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,725
I'm trying hard for a case!

1172
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:39,833
Where are you now?

1173
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:40,993
In town.

1174
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:42,998
What are the things
happening in the surrounding!

1175
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,861
- Here a guy is making Dosa - No, leave that

1176
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:46,931
What else?

1177
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,343
A traffic Inspector is taking bribe.

1178
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,341
Give a sharp blow on his face,

1179
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,611
and see the rest in jail. I am here.

1180
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,010
Okay.

1181
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,930
How much is the bribe for drink and drive?

1182
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:16,828
What!

1183
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,938
How much is the bribe for drink and drive?

1184
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,175
- You dog! - Calling me dog?

1185
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,686
Gave a single blow to the policeman!

1186
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,159
Three of them hospitalized
and also burned down a fireworks shop

1187
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,165
As I slapped a policeman,
the case is much stronger now.

1188
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:54,163
Two years of imprisonment!
After pleading, I somehow reached Central jail.

1189
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,107
Hats off to you. You are so daring!

1190
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,168
- But I am so happy about one thing
-What's it?

1191
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,671
This is the first time I am
getting dad's jail number 10.

1192
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:05,579
You know what, Maradona, Sachin, Messi
all are number 10.

1193
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:06,183
Now I too got number 10!

1194
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:07,850
Are they all prisoners?

1195
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,087
They are players.

1196
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:14,084
Don't talk about people who don't have
any other work than playing.

1197
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,097
Which world is he from?
Haven't you seen any world cup still?

1198
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:20,828
I have seen only Lockup!

1199
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,197
You don't know that story?

1200
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:27,036
His night duty starts when people
engross on TV watching World cup.

1201
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:30,573
If police didn't nab,
it's World cup, otherwise Lockup!

1202
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:31,938
That's right.

1203
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,206
- Unnikuttan, Sadashivan is released - Oh
really?

1204
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,651
Kaderkka, don't you like to know
about your daughter's marriage occasion?

1205
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:40,750
Yes I came to know everything.

1206
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:44,914
After the wedding, my daughter
told everything to her hubby that night itself!

1207
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,591
He is a nice guy.

1208
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,549
Before going, he came to see me.

1209
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,552
That's good.
So you don't have to worry about that

1210
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:52,865
Swami don't be upset. Please come here

1211
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:55,734
Any new admission in our block?

1212
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:56,595
Couple of new admissions came.

1213
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,929
This is the only place you can't send
them away displaying "HOUSEFULL" board!

1214
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,268
- Shibu, a new admission-Any brawl case

1215
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,870
No brawl, he groped a girl in the bus

1216
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,769
That too, a policewoman in mufti!

1217
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,044
Did he receive his welcome-beating?

1218
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,846
That's finished. There was
some other offering from 5th block prisoners.

1219
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,914
Come here, let him see

1220
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,723
What is this? Looks like underwear

1221
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:18,748
This blooms from my imagination

1222
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,021
Mind always thinks of Undenlvearl!

1223
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,758
I hate people torturing women or children

1224
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,028
You shouldn't be seen in a mess
or in the bus hereafter.

1225
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:30,759
- Get lost-Understand?

1226
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,002
Swami, don't try to get anything from him

1227
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:37,869
That's Simon

1228
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:41,907
What's the case?

1229
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:42,874
He is famous!

1230
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,608
While studying in college, nipped his bud.
Campus political murder!

1231
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:48,218
Court sentenced him a life imprisonment.

1232
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,321
Really lucky fellow!

1233
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,850
He can live happily here for 14 years.

1234
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,789
You really need a luck for that.

1235
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,931
Yes, if we get multiple life imprisonment,
then we can live happily here.

1236
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:03,294
Only he can talk like this.

1237
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,205
If you play with me, I'll blow you to death!

1238
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,973
Attention, newcomers! You can survive here
if give respect to your seniors

1239
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,207
Othenlvise I am a bad person.

1240
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:13,539
- Did you understand? Who?

1241
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:14,977
He only.

1242
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,215
We all!

1243
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,843
Why do you need a knife for removing
the stalk from chilly?

1244
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,179
Don't you pluck it with your hands?

1245
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,013
Please put the knife down,
I'm your father telling.

1246
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:25,325
- Who is playing Kireedam?
- Just asked a knife to cut mustards!

1247
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,751
Yes,I got it

1248
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,662
Oh God protect me

1249
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:33,324
May, You bless me with a happy life.

1250
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,867
You go to temple everyday?

1251
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,041
I always pray in the morning!

1252
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,880
Be it happy, or sad

1253
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,378
Simon, if you need, Church is here only!

1254
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,212
Are you going to college for taking class?

1255
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,147
No, I took books from the library!

1256
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:54,887
Oh bookworm!!

1257
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:56,983
Don't you read anything

1258
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,986
I have good reading habit!

1259
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:00,353
I read almost all the boards

1260
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,788
"No Parking" "No smoking" "No Entry"
"Pull" "Push' like such.

1261
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,791
Shall I ask you something?

1262
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,671
Someone may die amid a brawl accidently,

1263
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,206
or in the attempt of self defence,
a person may die,

1264
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:16,165
these things are understandable!

1265
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:20,370
But how can you kill a person in the name of
politics?

1266
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:27,783
Did I ask for trouble?

1267
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,355
Will this man kill me while I am asleep?

1268
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,757
Let Swami sleep where I sleep and vice versa!

1269
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,091
But, if his actual plan is to kill Swamy then?

1270
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,901
I lost my sleep. Let me pray once more

1271
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:49,242
A scoundrel has occupied the 7th block.

1272
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,646
In spite of raping a poor girl,
he also inserted an iron rod, bastard!

1273
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,677
Sir, why feed such criminals
in government expenses?

1274
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:00,448
While apprehending him,
emasculate and give it to dogs.

1275
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,746
Hang him to death tying both his hands behind.

1276
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:04,883
You are right!

1277
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:10,657
In the food he eats here,
there is the poor victim's family's tax money.

1278
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,228
Suppose I were the judge,

1279
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,799
How's that? Will anyone give a stick
to one who is expert in hurling?

1280
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,771
If it's in gulf countries, no matter who they are,
he will be beheaded immediately.

1281
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:22,931
Such laws should be implemented here.

1282
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:27,247
Then, only girls can live peacefully here.

1283
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:30,416
But here, there are people talking human rights
for these hardcore criminals

1284
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:31,876
Please open the tap.

1285
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:35,914
After bypass, I removed the block!

1286
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:37,984
See this, Okay?

1287
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:45,487
I don't want to stay here if you
are going to fill the jail with such dirty criminals.

1288
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,229
<i>I will</i> live peacefully outside.

1289
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:50,232
- Okay, go Doctor! - I am not a doctor, plumber!

1290
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:56,806
Ponnama sir, no guests in my maternal home!

1291
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,240
- Where is that lady? - Got released!

1292
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,505
Sir, my mothefs soul will still be confined in it!

1293
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,978
There is a new admission!

1294
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,416
One drug case!

1295
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,503
Playing dice game?

1296
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,109
No! Hooking!

1297
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,249
That's right, as you hooked your neighbour
army man's wife, you are here

1298
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:44,576
Get off from here

1299
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,517
Firing in boundary, neighbour caught

1300
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,014
I'll kill him, Kaderikka.

1301
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,052
You play, man.

1302
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,315
Spread the net! Sorry Play your game!

1303
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,326
Which is this new Statue?!

1304
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:07,396
What happened? Why are you looking
at a distance as an actor in award film

1305
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,939
New inmate! May be he didn't like the climate
here!

1306
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:11,606
Bro, do you have a wife of your own?

1307
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,340
Hmm! And also 8 children.

1308
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,346
Is he a children-making machine?

1309
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,645
However it's good you came here!

1310
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,920
Othenlvise, you would've formed an IPL Team.

1311
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:21,416
I PLATE?!

1312
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:22,978
I mean Cricket... IPL!

1313
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:24,418
You're here because your wife gave a case, is
it?

1314
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,651
No! In a fit of rage, I slapped my friend.

1315
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:28,594
And he died.

1316
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,257
Something else was to happen

1317
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,363
Anyway bygones are bygones! Don't worry.

1318
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,431
Henceforth you can live here without any
commitments!

1319
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,192
You don't have to pay for Milk and Paper.

1320
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:37,598
Neither Phone bill nor Current bill!

1321
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:39,400
Free from the creditors and fund collectors.

1322
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:40,936
And no complaints from wife.

1323
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,467
Here, even the morning newspapers are free!

1324
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:47,276
Apart from that, our food is also checked if it's
been poisoned!

1325
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:50,279
Only American President Obama and we, have
this type of security.

1326
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,349
We don't have to fear anyone.

1327
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,646
Police are around guarding us night and day.

1328
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:58,524
We've great value here.

1329
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,393
One has to take an appointment
and wait outside to meet us.

1330
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,062
If we say no, they can't see us!

1331
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,193
What value do we have outside?

1332
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,332
Everyone chase and thrash us!

1333
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,230
You can stay here happily, bro.

1334
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,605
Look at me! How happily I'm living here!

1335
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:15,607
You alone will be like you in this World!

1336
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:19,377
All the others somehow want to get out from
here!

1337
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:21,504
For him, happiness is bound to increase!

1338
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,449
His lover is on the other side.

1339
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:26,384
Is it true?

1340
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:29,621
I thought I missed her in the home town.

1341
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,183
Seeing my worries, my mother herself
put her into mothers cell.

1342
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,519
Like me, she too got a 2-yr sentence!

1343
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,095
Both of us can go out together, can't we?

1344
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,663
Until then she will be in my custody.

1345
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:42,664
If here, there's no fear
that someone will take her away!

1346
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:47,603
Even if it's after 2 years,
we wish to see you leading a happy life!

1347
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:51,368
Yes! Instead of coming to jail in the name of
your parents, think something like this.

1348
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:52,408
Yes, that is right.

1349
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:57,613
Try to profess your love at least here.

1350
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:03,354
Sunday here also a holiday.

1351
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,221
All cleaning and washing will be done on that
day.

1352
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:08,355
Rest of the days, you need to do
some job or the other.

1353
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:13,222
For the first two months you will be
paid minimum wages of Rs.55 daily.

1354
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:15,495
Even though she earned Rs.500 daily in
hometown,

1355
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,228
Out of greed, she stole money from a
contractofs bag and landed up in jail!

1356
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,772
Are you here because of winning the Gold
medal in the Olympics!

1357
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,371
Oh no! Both started! Shut up for a while.

1358
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,508
That girl may think, we fight here
also like in the assembly.

1359
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:30,373
What's there about what she thinks!

1360
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:33,781
Ever since she came here,
she didn't even speak a word to us.

1361
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:35,780
She will speak to us. Poor girl!

1362
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:37,122
Can't you make out from her face!

1363
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,753
I don't think so.

1364
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,527
I doubt she is in ecstasy after taking drugs!

1365
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,524
Will you please shut up! Too bad!

1366
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:55,373
Some have the habit
of harassing new entries this way.

1367
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,242
Don't take it seriously.

1368
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:59,672
Forget your past and live happily!

1369
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:02,774
This afternoon, there is a film on 'l'.V - Idukki
Gold!

1370
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:06,344
On seeing the Ganja plantation,
you will feel happy. Go.

1371
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:13,258
Poor girl! Sad about not getting the stuff!

1372
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:17,129
Rice and Fish curry!

1373
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,132
Who is your girl in this?

1374
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:28,534
Look there.

1375
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:32,509
The lady washing vessel, right? Good match!

1376
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,306
Not her! Fair one standing behind her!

1377
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:39,240
- Really? But the other one is your perfect
match.

1378
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,283
- Does she have any sisters? - No!

1379
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:42,454
At least a m other?

1380
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,518
She has a 90 yr old grandma! Want to take?

1381
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:46,292
You can take her when she dies.

1382
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:47,623
Serve!

1383
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,321
Can I talk to the person who belongs to my
hometown?

1384
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:53,461
What?

1385
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:57,201
Is anything wrong in asking
that fair girl about her well being?

1386
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:00,633
It's out of the rule...Still, try asking Ponnamma
madam!

1387
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:02,431
Thank you, Gopiettan!

1388
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:06,239
Sorry! As I see you in my brother's place
...l tend to..

1389
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:12,876
You look very pretty today! Did any facial
treatment?

1390
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:14,820
- No, not at all! - Don't lie!

1391
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,586
Anyway, your face is shinning

1392
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:19,450
Has your mother-in-law gone to hometown?

1393
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:23,853
- I'm drinking Badam milk since two days-Oh
really!

1394
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:25,162
May be that is the reason.

1395
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,631
Even otherwise, madam you look glamorous!
Couldn't you act in films?

1396
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:32,168
- Get off! - I won't!

1397
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,804
Gopi sir, heard what he said?
Asking me to act in films?

1398
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,237
Even after becoming a police woman,
she has no brains!

1399
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:44,416
What is your opinion, Gopi sir'? Should I?

1400
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,648
Yes!

1401
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:49,246
- Definitely! You've good expression! - Really?

1402
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,218
- Gopi Sir, you always used to say..- What?

1403
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:52,686
While Ponnamma madam walks,

1404
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,620
Not only on her face, even on her back,
there is a good expression!

1405
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:59,391
Don't you gesture with your face
while Ponnamma madam walks"

1406
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:00,793
...like...

1407
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,696
You are too mean, sir!

1408
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,934
Talking such rubbish to these persons?

1409
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,673
Oh no! Hereafter I can't walk freely also.

1410
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:13,537
Too bad!

1411
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,810
How am I going to face her now?

1412
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:17,649
When did you look at her face, sir?

1413
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,250
Anyway Ponnamma madam has left the place!

1414
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:22,953
Now I can talk with my hometown girl without
fear!

1415
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,258
Even while you walk there is such problem

1416
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:29,393
- Ponnam ma madam told this.
- Get lost you crook!

1417
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:34,957
When Iwalk, is it like that?

1418
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:39,529
Are you not having lunch?

1419
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,799
I was waiting for the queue to be cleared!

1420
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,367
I'm the supervisor in the Kitchen!

1421
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,478
We give best food here!

1422
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,945
You can tell your suggestion after having food

1423
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:57,718
Let me know your favorite dish
I will hide it in the food and give you.

1424
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:02,453
Like big marriages, here also buffet system.

1425
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,797
Only if you go there and show your plate, you
will get food.

1426
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:06,623
Come or do I need to get it for you?

1427
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:13,795
I went to your house one day. There I came to
know that you left to Delhi for a job!

1428
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,275
Only now I understood what sort ofjob it is!

1429
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,708
Well, who attempted to kill you the other day?

1430
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,871
Anyone from your drug mafia group?

1431
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,653
Don't take it seriously! Forget the past!

1432
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:33,314
You stepped into my birth place with your right
feet!

1433
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,824
2 years time will fly like the blink of an eye!

1434
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:39,031
Needn't worry for anything! I will be in the next
com pound.

1435
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,266
If there is any need, just call Unnikutta
I will hear your call in the Cell!

1436
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:46,564
After releasing from jail, quit that business.

1437
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:47,570
I mean Drugs!

1438
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:52,276
Please wait!

1439
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,607
Shall I tell you something important?
Think and tell me.

1440
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:01,478
After finishing the prison term
can we begin a new life together happily?

1441
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:07,485
Hurry up! Will be closed now.

1442
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:14,459
Has she agreed? What does she find in him to
love?

1443
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:19,836
- Excuse me... - Get lost!

1444
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,541
It's not that. I've told her something!

1445
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:25,868
In my sistefs place, please ask her the reply!

1446
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,579
It's a matter of my life. Please don't hesitate!

1447
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:28,973
Get going!

1448
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:34,513
I'm giving this to Gopi sir!
Get lost!

1449
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:41,823
What happened?

1450
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,556
My poor mother,

1451
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:45,560
No matter however much late it is,

1452
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,391
Waits for me with the food!

1453
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:48,899
Now that mother

1454
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,501
Was your mother so loving to you?

1455
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,399
Yes! I also loved my mother.

1456
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:54,737
What a pity!

1457
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:58,669
Don't cry.

1458
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:01,847
Shut up and take your food and
leave the place, you dog!

1459
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,747
He just told about his mother

1460
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:06,414
He is here for beating his mother to death.

1461
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,484
It was not deliberate!

1462
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,378
I lost my memory using Ganja.

1463
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,416
When I saw a cat eating food from my plate,

1464
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:14,888
I took a Coconut scraper and hit on the head.

1465
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:19,730
Actually it was my mother in the place of Cat.

1466
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,766
Kith and Kin accused me!

1467
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,394
But my father hugged me and appreciated

1468
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:28,972
Now he married my aunt and is living
peacefully, bloody dog!

1469
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:30,938
If you are sad, don't eat. I shall have it.

1470
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:32,839
No need! When I'm sad, I am more hungry.

1471
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,672
You've been bending like this for long!
Which letter are you searching for?

1472
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:37,480
- Ah?!-There are lots ofA in this book!

1473
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:41,813
Where did you get these books?

1474
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:43,111
I already told, it's from Library.

1475
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:45,921
That sir has too much Pride!

1476
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:49,118
When Iwent to Library, he chased me out
and said I should never come again!

1477
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:49,985
Why?

1478
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:57,827
As I've fallen in love, I went there
to read love stories!

1479
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,835
I asked sir "ls there any love story books for
reading?"

1480
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:02,167
He told me Chemmeen (Prawn) is there!

1481
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:04,443
I told him not for eating, but reading!

1482
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:06,402
<i>Then, he said “Kaya? {Rope} is there.</i>

1483
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:08,444
And I asked him, you want me to hang to
death?

1484
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:10,446
He gave me a push..

1485
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:14,513
Still I asked him politely, "Sir is
Thakazhi's Poovam bazham"(Banana) there?

1486
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,751
Sirjumped up and took off his pant.

1487
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:18,682
What nonsense is this!

1488
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,887
In fact he took the belt from the pant
and came to hit me!

1489
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,495
- I actually meant that.- Only this much?

1490
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:25,462
But I expected much!

1491
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:26,723
Puvam pazham is not written by Thakazhi.

1492
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:28,895
Both Basheer and Karur have written this

1493
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,033
They are prominent writers of Malayalam

1494
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:32,504
Who wrote Ethapazham (Banana)?

1495
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:35,602
Who will write with banana, it's to eat, right?

1496
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:38,109
Oh God! Will you let me read?"

1497
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:39,603
Let me eat this.

1498
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:42,746
For writing exams, he has applied for special
sanction.

1499
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:44,015
M.A Politics!

1500
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:45,675
We are illiterate!

1501
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,576
Being so highly educated, why did you involve
in such crimes?

1502
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:48,683
May be for a time pass!

1503
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:49,851
Don't utter a word!

1504
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:53,024
You, who stole idols, have no right to advise
anyone.

1505
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:54,591
Don't use the word STOLE

1506
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:57,089
When I had become a little poor, I sought God

1507
01:30:57,218 --> 01:30:59,494
I told HIM, YOU wish to come along with me to
Coimbatore?

1508
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:03,232
As GOD is bored of daily worships and prayers,

1509
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:05,162
He came along with me immediately.

1510
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,871
Police nabbed us only when we both
were standing in the railway station,

1511
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:14,511
Even when Police thrashed me, I called God
only!

1512
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:15,645
That is my devotion.

1513
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:17,238
My foot!

1514
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:18,949
Remember you are playing with God!

1515
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:22,755
God needs my help to travel around!

1516
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:24,022
And ultimately the blame is on my head.

1517
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:26,019
Not allowing even to help God?

1518
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,026
Are you going to sleep so soon?

1519
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:31,857
How can I sleep?

1520
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,726
- Until I know her mind?
- She will definitely like you.

1521
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:38,263
Who will not like a good-hearted person like
you?

1522
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:40,902
How many would've liked you?

1523
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,506
- You finished reading this?
- What for? To read?

1524
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,147
No, to keep it under my head! Oh no!

1525
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:54,210
What happened?

1526
01:31:57,078 --> 01:31:58,614
This book is so heavy!

1527
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:01,249
That's why its reader has head-weight!

1528
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:06,690
I feel Chicken needs to be cooked a little more.

1529
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:07,863
- Not necessary! - Needs to!

1530
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:09,866
- You heard? - What?

1531
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,195
Women Laughing!

1532
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,133
Oh God! Swami said there are many pretty girls
here

1533
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:19,005
If we were able to go that side,
we could've loved someone.

1534
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,873
Like the way Unni did!

1535
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:22,604
- It's not necessary that you should go there. -
Then?

1536
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:24,305
Have you read Basheer's "Mathilukal"(Walls)?

1537
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,948
I have read "Don't Urinate here"
written on Basheer's Mathil(Walls)

1538
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:29,210
Not that Basheer I meant!

1539
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:31,618
I referred about Vaikom Muhammad Basheer!

1540
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:33,319
When he was in the jail,

1541
01:32:33,781 --> 01:32:35,317
he loved a woman Narayani on the other side of
the wall.

1542
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:39,687
Although they didn't meet, they loved each
other only through their voices!

1543
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:41,294
That is divine love.

1544
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:42,862
- Is it? - Yeah!

1545
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,297
- Can such things happen? -Why not?

1546
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:52,873
- Who is that on the other side?
- Your mother! Get lost!

1547
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:57,144
I don't think Basheer's case will work out for
me.

1548
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:59,944
- Why don't we move then?
-She is not Narayani but Nariyani (filth)!

1549
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:06,847
Till now, you never gave a reply!

1550
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:10,294
What should I tell Unnikuttan?

1551
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:16,599
The thought of a marriage life will
never be in my mind henceforth!

1552
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:21,298
So, please tell him not to see me that way.

1553
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:30,171
Don't worry! May be because of her present
plight, she would've said so.

1554
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:36,149
If not her, won't you get a better girl?

1555
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:43,857
Forget her! Close this topic. Forget everything

1556
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:01,042
To bury whom, are you digging this?

1557
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:03,138
Dig slowly!

1558
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:06,714
Is this enough?

1559
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:08,886
You mind your business!

1560
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:10,720
Don't try to advise a supervisor!

1561
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:12,887
- Any ghost possessed you?
-Get lost you demon!

1562
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,354
Why did you move away from Kitchen duty?

1563
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:16,922
I can't cook for any strange women!

1564
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:20,262
Oh my Gopietta! Sorry, sir!

1565
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:22,627
Isn't it better to make food
for women in the female block itself?

1566
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:25,164
For that, Kitchen work in the female block
has to be com pleted!

1567
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:26,895
By that time, I will be finished.

1568
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:28,433
To tell the truth, I'm totally fed up.

1569
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,640
I need to get away from the jail <i>at</i> any cost.

1570
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:31,775
It's like a jail here

1571
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:33,909
- What?-Still it's too hot here I said

1572
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:35,380
Now you think that way!

1573
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,750
You used to say your parents' souls rest here.

1574
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:39,641
Souls will come outdoor also.

1575
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:41,781
Can I always keep sitting
here embracing these souls?

1576
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:44,283
If a need arises to go out,
<i>I will</i> offer incantations and drive them out.

1577
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,788
Hey fatso! What happened? Come here.

1578
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,061
My Goodness! Bengalis occupied our Jail also!

1579
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:51,226
They will begin like this!

1580
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:53,058
Assembly is the only place where Bengalis
haven't come!

1581
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:54,790
These people are there in the Bengal Assembly

1582
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:57,201
<i>I will</i> kill you! Mind you.

1583
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:01,031
Counting stars with a sickle?
I will beat you with a hammer!

1584
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:02,363
Hold this.

1585
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:05,206
I lost mood for digging. I will cut the grasses!

1586
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:05,810
You go!

1587
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:08,247
Your leg! I will cut it now. Mad!

1588
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:12,282
What is wrong with him?
I have not seen him like this before.

1589
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,080
As that girl rejected his love, he is frustrated.

1590
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:16,986
Is it true, Unnikutta?

1591
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:18,755
Did that girl reject your love?

1592
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,020
Hey, you! What a fool you are!

1593
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:26,899
Doesn't matter. Girls don't like ugly guys like
us!

1594
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,328
They all belong to a new generation.

1595
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:41,140
What happened, Unnikutta?

1596
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:42,346
Cut his hand.

1597
01:35:42,536 --> 01:35:43,105
What happened?

1598
01:35:44,205 --> 01:35:45,809
Did you lose your sight? Blood !

1599
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:47,745
Oh I'm going

1600
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:53,715
Teacher! Good morning!

1601
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:57,786
My Suguna! So You too landed here?
My student only!

1602
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,296
So all your students are in a good position,
aren't they?

1603
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,332
She is my 7th class teacher.

1604
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:05,470
Really? May be for teaching you
she is undergoing this punishment!

1605
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:08,907
Poor teacher! She hacked her husband
and threw her 2 children into well.

1606
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:11,739
Well, where is Unnikuttan?

1607
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:13,339
His vein got cut and is in the hospital.

1608
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:17,909
Any suicide attempt?

1609
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:20,476
People do such things when their mind is
upset

1610
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:21,886
He took the sickle and cut.

1611
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:24,555
Some say it was done deliberately!

1612
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:29,057
What is the reason?

1613
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,786
Ask her the reason.

1614
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:37,901
Come on serve food, Bhavani!

1615
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,195
I'll give you! Don't die!

1616
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:40,803
Next!

1617
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,568
Here everybody has big concern for Unnikutta.

1618
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,908
He is the only one who is not a Criminal here.

1619
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:48,204
A good hearted soul!

1620
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:51,041
I know Unnikutta better than others.

1621
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:54,050
It was he who rescued me once!

1622
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:56,084
Still why don't you...

1623
01:36:56,944 --> 01:36:58,252
I averted him deliberately

1624
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,323
That's what I don't understand.

1625
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:02,152
Tell me the reason clearly

1626
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:04,294
Afterl go out serving my sentence,

1627
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:06,398
I'm not sure whether I will be alive.

1628
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:12,165
People who wish for my death
are anxiously waiting for me.

1629
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:17,075
In such a condition, why give him hopes
unnecessarily?

1630
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:21,074
And it is not that I don't like him.

1631
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:23,247
Oh! So this is the reason.

1632
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:27,215
Is it possible to say who'll die when?

1633
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:31,586
In such a dire situation, is it not good
to have the companionship of a male?

1634
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:34,916
If he is beside you, nobody can touch you.

1635
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,394
I'm sure about it!

1636
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:39,932
Poor boy is in a great disappointment now!

1637
01:37:40,454 --> 01:37:43,594
I'm going to tell him that you like him..Ok?

1638
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:27,344
- Beautiful girl...- Oh God what happened?

1639
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,946
Will I get some water?

1640
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:31,646
Here.

1641
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:37,114
Thank you!

1642
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:38,149
I love you!

1643
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:39,615
Eh! I LA Varuthu(MACKREL FISH FRY)

1644
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:41,518
I love you!

1645
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:50,099
"From the time I saw you,
my eyes are sparkling"

1646
01:38:50,291 --> 01:38:53,397
"Today I saw that sparkle in my mirror"

1647
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:57,507
"From the time I liked you,\there was a
throbbing in my heart"

1648
01:38:57,698 --> 01:39:00,508
"A rhythm which only you and I can hear"

1649
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:08,681
"From the time I saw you, though I wished
to tell you everything many times,"

1650
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:11,918
"When I came near, I could not speak out"

1651
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:13,656
"To offer you when I lean on your chest"

1652
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:19,221
"I have kept a present in my heart,
its loveliness without fading a bit"

1653
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:25,063
"Beautiful girl"

1654
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:56,098
"when the breeze sees me or you,
why does it hum a tune?"

1655
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:59,766
"if summer comes, or the clouds rain"

1656
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:03,403
"if you are there, the flowering season will not
fade out"

1657
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:10,775
"Grape, won't you come with honey, my dear
parrot?"

1658
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:18,247
"When my heart flies to some shore in
my dream , that day is our wedding"

1659
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:23,758
"Beautiful girl,"

1660
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:31,228
"from the time I saw you,
I saw that sparkle in my mirror today"

1661
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:34,500
"In my heart which loves you,"

1662
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:38,368
"There is a rhythm which only you and I can
hear"

1663
01:40:46,473 --> 01:40:49,454
"When you touch me or I touch you,"

1664
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:53,316
"ls there a tinkling of an unseen pearl
necklace?"

1665
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:57,091
"May be from the sky or may be from a dream,"

1666
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:00,632
"There is a pile of stars in my palm"

1667
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:08,399
"In the jasmine grove which blooms
in the milky way of midnight,"

1668
01:41:08,829 --> 01:41:15,371
"We'll camp in the tent of heart,
embracing and kissing, filled with desire"

1669
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:20,785
"Beautiful girl",

1670
01:41:21,175 --> 01:41:25,282
" from the time I saw you, though
I wished to tell you everything many times,"

1671
01:41:25,446 --> 01:41:28,427
"When I came near, I could not speak out"

1672
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:32,423
"From the time I liked you,there was a
throbbing in my heart,"

1673
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:35,496
"A rhythm which only you and I can hear"

1674
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:41,468
"Beautiful girl!"

1675
01:41:41,528 --> 01:41:44,805
Stop it! Is this Jail or Dance club?

1676
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:46,310
Have you gone mad?

1677
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:50,372
No I got fits! Carry me quickly.

1678
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:51,845
Or else Superintendent Sir will kick me to a
pulp.

1679
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:54,417
Run...Don't put me down..please

1680
01:42:10,324 --> 01:42:13,134
- Jabbar bai...-Sir, one minute!

1681
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:14,468
Come back soon!

1682
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:19,804
- What is the Case?
- Burning down a Car on Hartal day!

1683
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,372
But one person was inside the Car.

1684
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:23,477
Not an issue! I will be here for some days.

1685
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:24,581
Hey, you!

1686
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:37,120
Don't remove the skin, pesticides will go off!

1687
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:38,729
Who is that?

1688
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:40,664
Don't leave him.

1689
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:52,875
Hit him! Don't spare him.

1690
01:43:11,985 --> 01:43:14,295
Tell me the truth, or else I will
burn you down to ashes.

1691
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:16,467
Why did you attempt to kill that girl?

1692
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:17,393
Speak out!

1693
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:19,834
No, please.

1694
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,471
This side! Ok!

1695
01:43:41,481 --> 01:43:44,291
Died? Throw him into the lake

1696
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:52,393
Sir, some girl is capturing video

1697
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:56,997
What a hell! Shucks!

1698
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:01,973
Although I got the visual in my camera,

1699
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,476
I didn't disclose this to anyone in fear.

1700
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:10,478
But when they continued to attack me,
I moved to my aunty's house.

1701
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:14,287
May be during that time,
you came home looking for me.

1702
01:44:14,514 --> 01:44:20,692
Only for my safety, my uncle
lied that I got a job in Delhi.

1703
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:26,493
When I was in my aunty's house,
I happened to see that news!

1704
01:44:26,693 --> 01:44:31,506
The killer of the Karunan murder case which
created politics turbulence was finally caught.

1705
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:35,574
Simon, who is active in student politics was
arrested.

1706
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:44,046
Police told that the accused wished
to marry Karunan's daughter,

1707
01:44:44,878 --> 01:44:49,486
Kodanand Viswam, central minister told the
murder was a very brutal and devilish act,

1708
01:44:49,716 --> 01:44:51,718
and this is really shameful for this literate state.

1709
01:44:51,918 --> 01:44:55,491
Karunan's death not only afflicted the Party,
but also put me down totally.

1710
01:44:56,523 --> 01:44:56,864
Please.

1711
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:00,805
Hence I thought of reacting against it

1712
01:45:01,028 --> 01:45:03,975
I decided to hand over that visual to DYSP
Baburaj!

1713
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:21,053
I'm allergic to dust! So I don't touch old files.

1714
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:24,989
I took many treatments!
Still, I couldn't get rid of this sneeze!

1715
01:45:26,019 --> 01:45:27,794
Do you have any copy of this?

1716
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:29,329
It is in my computer, sir.

1717
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:32,102
Good! For the time being, let it be a secret!

1718
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:35,127
As he is a Minister, we follow some protocol!

1719
01:45:35,128 --> 01:45:35,970
You can leave.

1720
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:40,875
What happened, sir?

1721
01:45:41,735 --> 01:45:43,112
Nothing, I just sneezed.

1722
01:45:43,904 --> 01:45:45,713
Immediate action will be taken. You can go.

1723
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:51,322
What he said was true!

1724
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:53,490
Immediate action was taken.

1725
01:45:54,915 --> 01:45:58,590
They recovered drugs which they themselves
brought from my bag.

1726
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:02,932
In the pretext of that raid,
from my studio and home,

1727
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:05,503
They searched and took whatever they needed!

1728
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:09,769
Now there is hardly any evidence
for that murder!

1729
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:15,345
But still, they are afraid about my being alive.

1730
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:18,010
So, if I come out,

1731
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:21,419
I may die of some accident,

1732
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,488
or they will finish me.

1733
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:33,052
Aviyal (mixed Veg dish) has become like
Sam bar(Veg Curry)!

1734
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,157
Shucks! What is this?

1735
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:35,758
Move away your closet!

1736
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:37,492
Closet?! That is his coffer!

1737
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:39,795
You know how many gold biscuits
he smuggled evading the customs sight!

1738
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,798
Now there is also a name given in Facebook.

1739
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:42,870
<i>Maladwar Gold!</i>

1740
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:44,838
How can this gold be worn on the neck?

1741
01:46:45,132 --> 01:46:45,872
I received 450 "Like" too

1742
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:48,012
When people find it difficult
to pass even normal motion,

1743
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:49,772
How is it possible for you alone?

1744
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:51,615
Is there so much of space for that?

1745
01:46:51,805 --> 01:46:52,681
What nonsense is that, man?

1746
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:54,011
That is not an ordinary one!

1747
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:56,114
But a royal one.. made of Gold1

1748
01:46:56,743 --> 01:46:58,882
Don't make fun of me!
I'll come there and slap you

1749
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,149
Come if you dare.

1750
01:47:00,881 --> 01:47:03,862
Before indulging in stealing,
I was a tiger in goondaism!

1751
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:04,858
Just ask him.

1752
01:47:05,519 --> 01:47:06,429
Yes !

1753
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,599
When people started to sit on
the tiger like Lord Ayyappan,

1754
01:47:09,856 --> 01:47:11,494
This tiger stopped goondaism. Am I right,
tiger?

1755
01:47:11,725 --> 01:47:12,169
I only asked you to support me.

1756
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:13,898
Never told you to milk a tigress.

1757
01:47:14,127 --> 01:47:15,697
Why does he look worried?

1758
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:19,173
Aren't you aware? His wife delivered a baby
girl.

1759
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:21,178
What if its girl or a boy?

1760
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:22,712
That is not the problem.

1761
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:24,849
It's 3 years, since he had gone out from here.

1762
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:25,915
Is it a Karu nya(Mercy) lottery?

1763
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:27,517
Eswaran(Lord) bestows him generously!

1764
01:47:27,741 --> 01:47:30,847
That's right! He's Eswaran Kartha, my
neighbour!

1765
01:47:31,044 --> 01:47:33,024
When I'm let free, I'll kill that swine!

1766
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:34,184
Don't worry!

1767
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:37,888
Some rascals have the habit of hitting
a goal in goalie-less goal post.

1768
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:39,758
They will suffer

1769
01:47:41,555 --> 01:47:43,694
Some people are like that only. Giving only
despair!

1770
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:46,201
When I had a baby,
my brothers-in-law chased and hit me.

1771
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:48,706
He had a child from a servant maid of the next
house.

1772
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:50,533
What is wrong? Isn't that also a baby?

1773
01:47:51,064 --> 01:47:52,441
I wonder with whom she lives now!

1774
01:47:54,067 --> 01:47:55,876
-It's already washed! -Wash it once again.

1775
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:57,207
To wash again and again, is it a butt?

1776
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:01,676
A highly educated person doing a slave labour
here!

1777
01:48:02,542 --> 01:48:05,853
Though you're branded as a murderer,
why didn't you disclose the truth?

1778
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:07,852
Even the Court didn't believe when I disclosed.

1779
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:18,900
Why cleaning the tank?
To make it dirty from tomorrow.

1780
01:48:19,059 --> 01:48:20,902
No, it's for us to bathe

1781
01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:23,905
Why a sudden parole?

1782
01:48:24,564 --> 01:48:26,942
After one month, both of us will be freed

1783
01:48:27,734 --> 01:48:28,906
It's emergency parole!

1784
01:48:29,102 --> 01:48:31,776
The ancestral home where my parents lived
is totally damaged!

1785
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:34,213
I discussed with Superintendent regarding it's
renovation

1786
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:39,119
Superintendent can permit 10 days parole
if a house is destroyed in a natural calamity.

1787
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:40,048
That is how I got this.

1788
01:48:41,047 --> 01:48:43,926
After marriage, we can't live on the streets,
right?

1789
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:47,529
I need to discuss about our marriage to
your uncle and finalise it.

1790
01:48:50,056 --> 01:48:52,536
You came here on the very second day I came

1791
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:54,132
It was me who was supposed to go out first.

1792
01:48:55,295 --> 01:48:57,036
Now taking 10-days parole into consideration,

1793
01:48:57,564 --> 01:48:58,770
It will be you who will be going first.

1794
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:02,205
8 days later I will also follow you.

1795
01:49:02,936 --> 01:49:06,611
If that is the case, we will perform
our marriage in May.

1796
01:49:08,575 --> 01:49:09,952
Hey you! Enough...

1797
01:49:10,944 --> 01:49:14,153
If Superintendent sees you romancing
instead of repairing the light,

1798
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:15,788
Then, the shock will be for me only.

1799
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:19,152
<i>I will</i> go now and come back with some other
reason.

1800
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:22,534
Don't expose yourself in sunlight too much.
You will turn into a black raisin!

1801
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:25,628
Shall we move?

1802
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,038
Go and check the next block also

1803
01:49:29,763 --> 01:49:31,800
If this continues, before the sentence is served,

1804
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:34,000
I guess Unni will elope with Radhika from jail.

1805
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:37,014
Why don't we also follow them, Bhavani?

1806
01:49:37,203 --> 01:49:40,275
Will anyone deliberately fall into a dung-pit
Baskaran?

1807
01:49:40,774 --> 01:49:46,122
If this dung is put to the plaintain,
it will grow rapidly!

1808
01:49:46,313 --> 01:49:48,020
Get lost you filth!

1809
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:54,360
Finish up the work quickly!

1810
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:56,756
As you know, I can't take too much leave.

1811
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:57,365
Are you in Dubai?

1812
01:49:59,392 --> 01:50:06,071
Not proper Dubai! Just 14ft towards west, there
is a place called Czechslovakia! In that Centre!

1813
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:06,800
Do you know anybody there?

1814
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:09,940
- Go and deliver soon!- It's gas!

1815
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:12,845
Concealed it there! May be to sell it in black
market

1816
01:50:13,406 --> 01:50:14,146
Here comes Sekarettan!

1817
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:16,151
What happened?

1818
01:50:16,876 --> 01:50:21,848
I discussed everything with the girl's family.

1819
01:50:21,982 --> 01:50:23,188
They gave their full consent.

1820
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:25,160
Therefore, don't delay it any more.

1821
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:27,899
When you come out, perform the marriage
immediately

1822
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:31,892
We'll take care of the arrangements here.

1823
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:34,365
Just prepare the list of invitees and give me.

1824
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:36,134
I don't have a big list.

1825
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:38,034
But we have to invite the close ones

1826
01:50:38,398 --> 01:50:42,642
Thief Kumaran, Pickpocket Rajappan, Bus
stand Janaki...

1827
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:45,305
Shucks! We can't invite such people.

1828
01:50:45,772 --> 01:50:47,945
Remember this is your marriage!
Not anything else!

1829
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:50,718
Whatever it may be,
I've a good relationship with them.

1830
01:50:50,944 --> 01:50:53,220
If so, then why are you getting married?

1831
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,384
Can't you live with these people?

1832
01:50:55,782 --> 01:50:56,385
If I give a smack...

1833
01:50:56,783 --> 01:50:58,763
I meant to say I was on good terms
with these people in jail!

1834
01:50:58,952 --> 01:51:00,295
If I don't invite them, then they
will start badmouthing!

1835
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,390
Even, if I invite them, they will not come.

1836
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:04,790
Because they all will be in sound sleep during
daytime.

1837
01:51:04,791 --> 01:51:06,395
<i>Suppose they attend,</i>

1838
01:51:09,796 --> 01:51:11,298
In that case, you must handle.

1839
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:12,868
At this old age?

1840
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:16,071
- Just say they are his mother and sisters!
- No way!

1841
01:51:16,269 --> 01:51:18,249
Bus stand Janu and Jallikattu Mary, my mother
and sisters?

1842
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:19,944
Introduce them as Shekarettan's children.

1843
01:51:20,407 --> 01:51:21,886
Am I running anything else here?

1844
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:25,923
Don't fight. I'll handle it.

1845
01:51:27,414 --> 01:51:31,385
Or will introduce as your driving teachers
or your tuition teacher?

1846
01:51:31,785 --> 01:51:32,229
Don't take my life away.

1847
01:51:33,086 --> 01:51:34,759
- Have Janu and Ammini reached so early?
-Who is that?

1848
01:51:35,422 --> 01:51:38,403
It's been a very long time since we met!

1849
01:51:39,192 --> 01:51:40,967
I need to discuss something urgent with you.

1850
01:51:41,428 --> 01:51:44,170
Let them not listen. We'll stand there and talk.

1851
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:44,933
Really?

1852
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:47,906
You need to take over a case!

1853
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:50,081
Oh I'm in Parole now.

1854
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:51,305
Besides, my marriage is also fixed.

1855
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:52,883
So, I don't take up new cases!

1856
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:59,413
You will get cash of 25 Iakhs ready cash

1857
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,218
25 Iakhs?

1858
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:04,393
So, section 302? Murder?

1859
01:52:04,784 --> 01:52:06,229
Exactly!

1860
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:09,865
I guessed it from the amount.
You already killed someone?

1861
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,070
No! We are just planning.

1862
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:13,301
Who is the person?

1863
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,762
If you agree, I will give you the details.

1864
01:52:15,962 --> 01:52:17,908
He is a bloody scoundrel! DYSP Baburaj!

1865
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:18,337
Everything Collapsed!

1866
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:20,209
If this is a problem, then
I will change the name and say.

1867
01:52:20,433 --> 01:52:21,810
<i>Babura}, DY SP'.!</i>

1868
01:52:29,008 --> 01:52:29,952
What do you think?

1869
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:32,788
He has to die!

1870
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:36,223
A betrayer who fab ricates stories
and send innocents to jail!

1871
01:52:36,816 --> 01:52:37,988
Heard what he said!

1872
01:52:38,218 --> 01:52:40,198
Unable to bear his torture...

1873
01:52:40,887 --> 01:52:42,924
He even blackmails the Minister!

1874
01:52:43,256 --> 01:52:46,169
In spite of giving him loads of money,
his greed never stops!

1875
01:52:46,426 --> 01:52:50,397
Threatens that he holds the evidences of
Karunan's murder.

1876
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:52,337
That too with us!

1877
01:52:53,133 --> 01:52:55,340
- Don't blabber unnecessarly!
-What is the need of concealing

1878
01:52:55,802 --> 01:52:57,338
Cat will be out of the bag one day, right?

1879
01:52:57,437 --> 01:53:00,316
I asked you to sit in the Car.

1880
01:53:03,076 --> 01:53:04,316
After taking too much of drink...

1881
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:06,389
Don't utter a word! <i>I will</i> talk to him.

1882
01:53:07,147 --> 01:53:08,217
You tell the rest!

1883
01:53:08,848 --> 01:53:13,194
As you know everything,
it is better that you take up this case.

1884
01:53:13,419 --> 01:53:14,762
You don't have any risk in this

1885
01:53:14,954 --> 01:53:16,058
Other boys will execute the task.

1886
01:53:16,422 --> 01:53:18,231
Then our party will take care of the case

1887
01:53:19,425 --> 01:53:21,928
I normally don't take up cases like murder and
rape.

1888
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:23,799
But I'll take up this.

1889
01:53:24,097 --> 01:53:26,407
It's for the Party, isn't it? I don't need any cash!

1890
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,873
<i>Such a big sacrifice to the Party').!</i>

1891
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:30,873
I will die for the Party!

1892
01:53:32,872 --> 01:53:35,409
You will be the secretary of Youth
after you come out from jail

1893
01:53:35,909 --> 01:53:36,853
Youth?

1894
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:41,058
Youth wing secretary! Take my word!

1895
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:44,891
I got some work to do!

1896
01:53:45,185 --> 01:53:46,994
Only after my command, finish the person.

1897
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:48,330
Okay.

1898
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:51,931
Don't ask for unnecessary trouble!

1899
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:54,401
Anyway, your girl's punishment is almost over.

1900
01:53:55,094 --> 01:53:56,903
What is the use of proving her innocence now?

1901
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:00,501
Don't I need to prove my girl
has no connection with drugs?

1902
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:05,348
Othenuise after marriage, even if smoke comes out,
from our kitchen, people will start doubting.

1903
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,250
Would we able to go to Idukki for a tour?

1904
01:54:08,608 --> 01:54:10,610
Won't freak boys come home asking for stuff?

1905
01:54:10,977 --> 01:54:12,979
"Hai bro, Hai dude, Hai buddy"

1906
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:15,226
I will take a stickmand a big scene follows!

1907
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:17,962
I must prove her innocence.

1908
01:54:18,985 --> 01:54:22,091
Should somehow snatch the CD from that
DySP!

1909
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:26,099
You are not clashing with an ordinary person!
But Central Ministerl!

1910
01:54:26,459 --> 01:54:28,166
They will destroy you!

1911
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:30,441
Whatever happens, I must bring their crime to
limelight.

1912
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:34,937
Not only Radhika's matter,
that Poor Simon is also in the jail.

1913
01:54:35,134 --> 01:54:38,115
That's right! But till today, you've not even
stolen a pin.

1914
01:54:38,338 --> 01:54:39,942
How will you get into DySP's house?

1915
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:43,546
Wasn't I staying with thieves and criminals
for these many years?

1916
01:54:43,943 --> 01:54:45,320
That experience is more than enough for me.

1917
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:47,249
- Let your experience will not fail urine! - Eh!

1918
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,591
Let your experience not end in failure!

1919
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:52,054
There is a big dog in DySP's house.

1920
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:53,260
Oh really?

1921
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:56,433
There is nothing in this

1922
01:54:57,023 --> 01:55:00,061
Got an easy way of barging into a house
at night where dog is set free!

1923
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:03,998
Whether to shake the assembly
or to break the Sage's penance,

1924
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:05,436
A woman can do it.

1925
01:55:05,999 --> 01:55:08,138
Even for animals, female is the weakness.

1926
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:14,110
Don't keep barking here.

1927
01:55:14,674 --> 01:55:18,451
If you get into any trouble, being a stray dog,
you will have many to support you

1928
01:55:18,678 --> 01:55:20,316
But to rescue me, not even a dog will come.

1929
01:55:23,149 --> 01:55:24,253
Where did the dog in this house disappear'?

1930
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:29,100
Keep standing here and charm the dog
till I come back.

1931
01:55:40,466 --> 01:55:44,209
Dog is coming! You handle him!

1932
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:45,949
Come on, lure him!

1933
01:55:46,472 --> 01:55:46,973
Charm him!

1934
01:55:48,207 --> 01:55:49,083
Not me! Charm that dog.

1935
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:50,345
Give two kisses and raise his mood.

1936
01:55:56,683 --> 01:55:58,424
Any other moral dogs should not come now

1937
01:56:02,455 --> 01:56:03,525
Wall has no height!

1938
01:56:19,772 --> 01:56:22,082
Oh my dude! I don't keep any tools with me

1939
01:56:22,275 --> 01:56:26,087
Tools for opening the door will be
found behind the house. So simple.

1940
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:05,120
Hey maid! Maid!

1941
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:06,118
Who is that?

1942
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:08,189
<i>I'm DY SP Babura}! House Owner'.!</i>

1943
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:09,359
Sir, please go.

1944
01:58:09,482 --> 01:58:12,361
I shall increase your pay, take you to Lulu
mall...

1945
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:13,823
I will do anything you wish.

1946
01:58:14,153 --> 01:58:14,858
If madam comes to know this

1947
01:58:15,221 --> 01:58:16,097
That buffalo is in a sound sleep there.

1948
01:58:16,289 --> 01:58:17,233
We shall sleep here.

1949
01:58:17,857 --> 01:58:20,235
- You came here for sleeping?
- Stop your jokes!

1950
01:58:41,314 --> 01:58:46,229
If there are members at home, then the
cupboard key will be in its surroundings.

1951
01:58:46,486 --> 01:58:47,226
Damn sure!

1952
01:58:55,495 --> 01:58:57,771
Sleeping posture of the housewife
may provoke your desire.

1953
01:58:58,131 --> 01:59:00,202
Don't do anything. That is decency!

1954
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:05,816
If she had moved and slept here...

1955
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:09,147
What else is the way?

1956
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:17,389
O Lord Krishna! You are my saviour now.

1957
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:18,458
Please forgive me.

1958
01:59:39,505 --> 01:59:40,449
Whoa! O Lord! My Almighty!

1959
01:59:41,474 --> 01:59:44,387
Please protect me, O Lord!

1960
01:59:44,877 --> 01:59:48,256
O my Devotee! Where did (husband)Valsan
sleeping along with you vanish?

1961
01:59:49,982 --> 01:59:50,722
Who knows?

1962
01:59:50,917 --> 01:59:54,763
He is stealing butter in the Kitchen with the
maid.

1963
01:59:55,721 --> 01:59:58,964
Let the maid not deliver the heir of this clan

1964
01:59:59,392 --> 02:00:02,396
<i>Oh my God! Go fast and dance kaliaya
mardhana,</i>

1965
02:00:02,662 --> 02:00:03,902
on your husband's chest!

1966
02:00:05,865 --> 02:00:06,969
I'll put an end to everything today!

1967
02:00:07,934 --> 02:00:08,969
Hello sis! Don't kill him, please!

1968
02:00:09,402 --> 02:00:10,904
Ever since she came in, I doubted.

1969
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:13,407
Oh my Lord! You protected me.

1970
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:15,481
' So: <i>m</i>

1971
02:00:16,742 --> 02:00:17,948
Oh no! What am I seeing here?

1972
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:21,816
I never thought you were such a filthy person

1973
02:00:22,014 --> 02:00:23,550
I actually came to drink water.

1974
02:00:23,816 --> 02:00:25,557
Oh, you drink water after taking off your shirt
and lying on the ground.

1975
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:28,721
Clear the place when it dawns.

1976
02:00:28,988 --> 02:00:31,400
Madam, I'm innocent! Sir only..

1977
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:32,965
Didn't I say I came to drink water'?

1978
02:00:33,492 --> 02:00:34,800
You too misunderstood me?

1979
02:00:34,927 --> 02:00:35,962
I understood everything.

1980
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:38,969
Lord Krishna appeared before me
and revealed everything.

1981
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:42,274
I put an end to our relationship now!

1982
02:00:47,873 --> 02:00:49,580
The ball is in my court now!

1983
02:00:55,514 --> 02:00:58,495
O Lord Krishna! Were you Lord Vishnu?

1984
02:01:00,019 --> 02:01:00,997
O Lord Vaikunta!

1985
02:01:05,558 --> 02:01:08,698
Unnikuttan reveals some surprising
facts in Karunan's murder case!

1986
02:01:09,028 --> 02:01:12,373
Unnikuttan handed over the visuals to the
media

1987
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:14,545
which subtantiate the real culprit
is the central minister Viswanathan.

1988
02:01:18,571 --> 02:01:23,543
Radhika, a innocent photographer who handed
over these visuals to DYSP Baburaj

1989
02:01:23,743 --> 02:01:28,385
She was trapped in a forged drug case
and cruelly put in a prison

1990
02:01:28,581 --> 02:01:29,719
It's too cruel!

1991
02:01:33,052 --> 02:01:36,966
Now real culprits in Karunan murder case
is known to public

1992
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:39,961
Unnikuttan requested the government
to take immediate action

1993
02:01:40,393 --> 02:01:44,535
to set him free as Simon being innocent in this
case

1994
02:01:44,730 --> 02:01:45,367
<i>I will</i> put forth more request!

1995
02:01:45,564 --> 02:01:47,805
With Unnikuttan's brilliant move,

1996
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,880
real culprit will be nabbed soon believes
Karunan's Kiths and Kins!

1997
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:05,728
He is there!

1998
02:02:06,419 --> 02:02:07,022
Who?

1999
02:02:08,754 --> 02:02:10,392
Come boys! Let us thrash & kill him !

2000
02:02:10,756 --> 02:02:11,564
Me?

2001
02:02:12,758 --> 02:02:15,568
If there are too many opponents
and we are unable to tackle,

2002
02:02:15,761 --> 02:02:18,571
We should not show our martial arts

2003
02:02:18,764 --> 02:02:20,744
Suddenly we need to transform into PT Usha!

2004
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:21,410
Must run!

2005
02:02:31,577 --> 02:02:32,715
Close the gate!

2006
02:02:33,746 --> 02:02:35,384
Open the door.

2007
02:02:35,581 --> 02:02:36,559
Open the door I say! Oh Opened!

2008
02:02:37,583 --> 02:02:40,393
Why stopping there?
If you have the courage, come inside.

2009
02:02:40,586 --> 02:02:42,053
Nobody can dare touch me!

2010
02:02:42,054 --> 02:02:44,864
I have full security here. Get away from my
house!

2011
02:02:45,591 --> 02:02:47,798
Get in if you wish to live! These party
people are daring enough to do anything.

2012
02:02:47,993 --> 02:02:49,028
Get off!

2013
02:02:49,762 --> 02:02:51,742
Don't try to threaten Policemen!

2014
02:02:52,598 --> 02:02:54,737
Hell with his party people!

2015
02:02:57,436 --> 02:02:57,470
Thank heavens! lam saved.

2016
02:02:57,603 --> 02:02:58,809
What was the commotion outside?

2017
02:02:59,004 --> 02:03:02,417
What to say, sir? Criminals are more outside
than in Jail!

2018
02:03:02,608 --> 02:03:03,985
It is their fortune that my parole is over.

2019
02:03:04,443 --> 02:03:06,423
Othenlvise, they would have
also come here killing me!

2020
02:03:06,612 --> 02:03:07,989
You become a great star now!

2021
02:03:08,447 --> 02:03:09,425
Minister Viswam resigned!

2022
02:03:09,615 --> 02:03:10,719
Will be arrested today itself.

2023
02:03:10,983 --> 02:03:12,724
If remanded, he will be surely brought here
only!

2024
02:03:13,586 --> 02:03:15,566
And A Class prison room will also be occupied.

2025
02:03:16,589 --> 02:03:19,035
Anyhow things came out more than I expected!

2026
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:20,866
Only after they come inside,

2027
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:23,563
Myself and Radhika can go out and lead a
peaceful life.

2028
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:29,876
- Unnikutta, you rocked the show!

2029
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:31,412
Yes, if you play with me I will rock.

2030
02:03:43,749 --> 02:03:46,389
Are you happy? Verdict has to come!

2031
02:03:46,585 --> 02:03:47,859
Then, release!

2032
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:51,731
What, dude?

2033
02:03:52,057 --> 02:03:54,401
When you see me outside anywhere,
get me a cup of tea and puffed rice balls!

2034
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:05,047
Sir!

2035
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:08,575
Take them to U2 block

2036
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:41,882
Welcome! Welcome!

2037
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:51,557
If he gets into Politics,
he will surely become the next C.M!

2038
02:04:55,754 --> 02:04:59,224
Although you served your punishment,
the world knows that you are innocent.

2039
02:04:59,592 --> 02:05:00,730
You are lucky that way!

2040
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:03,903
As your enemies are inside,
you will not have any more trouble!

2041
02:05:04,096 --> 02:05:05,734
That DySP is in suspension now.

2042
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:09,245
You will be released after 2 days!

2043
02:05:11,103 --> 02:05:14,573
The sacred chain for your marriage will be the
gift from the staff here, ok?!

2044
02:05:15,107 --> 02:05:17,747
Did you know, our Superintendent sir is
transferred!

2045
02:05:18,043 --> 02:05:20,819
New Superintendent is the arrested Minister's
man!

2046
02:05:21,013 --> 02:05:24,051
I heard he is a troublesome fellow!

2047
02:05:24,617 --> 02:05:25,755
Neerkoli is his nickname (Grass Snake)

2048
02:05:50,943 --> 02:05:52,581
Hey, get UP!

2049
02:05:57,283 --> 02:05:59,092
Don't you know to stand up on seeing an
officer?

2050
02:06:07,927 --> 02:06:13,070
- Bloody rascal! - Please don't harm me, sir.

2051
02:06:21,307 --> 02:06:22,012
<i>Not Cake Ravi, but KokuflfiraneRavi'.!</i>

2052
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:23,286
That is what I'm writing.

2053
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:25,788
What are you guys doing?

2054
02:06:28,314 --> 02:06:29,884
Apart from the vessel for drinking and eating,

2055
02:06:30,082 --> 02:06:31,584
I shouldn't see anything around.

2056
02:06:31,784 --> 02:06:33,084
Throw away everything.

2057
02:06:33,085 --> 02:06:33,256
Move aside!

2058
02:06:33,619 --> 02:06:35,895
No entertainments are allowed here.

2059
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,894
<i>I will</i> show you how the real Jail would be!

2060
02:06:43,629 --> 02:06:44,073
What is that?

2061
02:06:44,797 --> 02:06:45,605
Bring that here.

2062
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,603
My wedding invitation!
Will be released in a week's time.

2063
02:06:53,639 --> 02:06:55,778
Oh! So you are Unnikuttan!

2064
02:06:58,110 --> 02:07:00,021
Don't you know you can't keep
all these things in the prison?

2065
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,054
His bloody invitation!

2066
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:05,023
What is your case?

2067
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:08,598
Don't you have a tongue?

2068
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:11,034
A case of attempted murder- of Traffic S.l!

2069
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:13,065
That's why you're silent, right?

2070
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:16,903
Laying hand on a Policeman! You rascal!

2071
02:07:19,798 --> 02:07:21,277
Be quiet <i>&</i> disciplined here !!

2072
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:25,771
If you act smart,
I will rip off all your bones! Got it?

2073
02:07:29,308 --> 02:07:31,754
What is the need of hitting you
for the 2 yr old case?

2074
02:07:33,045 --> 02:07:34,023
He has started his move!

2075
02:07:34,279 --> 02:07:36,259
Everyone will be in trouble. Be careful !

2076
02:07:40,786 --> 02:07:43,266
Sir, she is Unnikuttan's fiance!

2077
02:07:50,462 --> 02:07:51,065
Sir!

2078
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:53,065
Releasing today!

2079
02:07:56,101 --> 02:07:59,913
Before I could get to know her well,
her punishment period got over?!!

2080
02:08:02,474 --> 02:08:04,454
Didn't I tell you I need a person
for cooking in my quarters.

2081
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:06,282
My wife has gone to native.

2082
02:08:06,945 --> 02:08:09,084
Anyway, let her stay there for sometime.

2083
02:08:12,284 --> 02:08:14,764
Sir, her marriage is fixed.

2084
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:17,259
With Unnikuttan, right? That will not happen.

2085
02:08:19,792 --> 02:08:22,773
Here take your 2 years's income...Mere sum!

2086
02:08:26,799 --> 02:08:27,038
Take!

2087
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:28,437
If you come there and stay for some time,

2088
02:08:28,801 --> 02:08:30,940
you can earn 4 times this. What do you say ??

2089
02:08:31,136 --> 02:08:34,447
Sorry sir. I have no experience in that job.

2090
02:08:34,807 --> 02:08:38,118
Forthe time being, I feel you can keep your
wife herself, who is well experienced in this!

2091
02:08:39,478 --> 02:08:40,081
Thank you, sir!

2092
02:08:50,122 --> 02:08:52,466
- Madam, you must surely come for
the marriage. - Definitely!

2093
02:08:53,325 --> 02:08:53,928
See you!

2094
02:08:57,129 --> 02:09:00,303
Whatever it is, I feel sorry
to see you in this condition,

2095
02:09:01,834 --> 02:09:05,304
Just a 14-days remand, isn't it? That's not a
problem. I will be granted bail immediately!

2096
02:09:06,138 --> 02:09:09,483
Jail-term is a feather to a politician's cap!

2097
02:09:10,476 --> 02:09:12,956
One who put me in this plight is here, isn't he?

2098
02:09:13,812 --> 02:09:15,189
Just keep an eye on him.

2099
02:09:15,481 --> 02:09:16,960
Hereafter, he will not go out from here.

2100
02:09:17,316 --> 02:09:19,796
We've a new admission tomorrow! Our man!

2101
02:09:20,819 --> 02:09:22,799
A death occurred amid the clash
between two groups of prisoners...

2102
02:09:23,322 --> 02:09:24,198
That will be the report!

2103
02:09:24,823 --> 02:09:26,928
Othewvise, Media will unnecessarily trigger
problems!

2104
02:09:59,324 --> 02:10:01,463
How tall he is! Like gazing at a coconut tree !!

2105
02:10:03,829 --> 02:10:06,036
O the new comer has arrived!

2106
02:10:06,331 --> 02:10:07,935
Is this a BSNL Towel'?

2107
02:10:11,503 --> 02:10:13,210
- Get up! -What?

2108
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:16,945
Move away from under the fan!

2109
02:10:17,142 --> 02:10:18,314
Are you playing don here

2110
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:21,047
Go and lie down in some corner in a mat!

2111
02:10:21,313 --> 02:10:22,053
See that you don't wet the mat!

2112
02:10:22,314 --> 02:10:25,454
Can't you hear? Move away.

2113
02:10:26,318 --> 02:10:27,456
Are you Amitabh Bachan?

2114
02:10:27,953 --> 02:10:30,934
We're supposed to rag the new comers.
Are you ragging us?

2115
02:10:31,123 --> 02:10:31,794
Get lost!

2116
02:10:32,124 --> 02:10:35,799
- You rascal! - What the hell are you doing?

2117
02:10:39,331 --> 02:10:41,811
Don't kick him.

2118
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:44,940
Oh God! Who is this devil?

2119
02:10:47,339 --> 02:10:50,946
I invited all here with the intention
that nobody will attend

2120
02:10:51,143 --> 02:10:54,283
Now I came to know many are
being released and coming on parole!

2121
02:10:54,479 --> 02:10:56,117
Around 50 people will be there.

2122
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:02,621
What is happening here?

2123
02:11:08,327 --> 02:11:08,930
Hey, leave him

2124
02:11:09,127 --> 02:11:13,473
No Unni! Don't interfere!
You are about to get released.

2125
02:11:14,333 --> 02:11:15,107
What happened?

2126
02:11:15,968 --> 02:11:16,946
What are you looking?

2127
02:11:17,336 --> 02:11:17,939
Come!

2128
02:11:19,137 --> 02:11:21,947
Come my b0)”

2129
02:11:23,342 --> 02:11:24,320
Got afraid?

2130
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:27,956
- What? - Hey, no!

2131
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:29,951
Hey, move away you oldie!

2132
02:11:30,315 --> 02:11:32,955
Come I say!

2133
02:11:37,322 --> 02:11:37,629
Sir!

2134
02:11:38,156 --> 02:11:39,635
One fellow is creating a scene there!

2135
02:11:40,092 --> 02:11:41,969
Go and tell your complaints to Superintendent.

2136
02:11:43,095 --> 02:11:45,132
Nobody is permitted to leave the block is the
new order.

2137
02:11:46,498 --> 02:11:47,476
Where is Gopi sir?

2138
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:48,978
He is on leave.

2139
02:12:00,679 --> 02:12:01,487
What nuisance are you doing?

2140
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,489
Jumping into the water and bathing, You nasty
fellow!

2141
02:12:06,151 --> 02:12:07,323
What madness are you showing? Leave him

2142
02:12:07,519 --> 02:12:08,122
Leave him I say.

2143
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,659
Leave him! I told you to leave him.

2144
02:12:11,523 --> 02:12:12,661
Take off your hand from him!

2145
02:12:13,358 --> 02:12:14,666
Isn't there anyone to rescue him? Leave him.

2146
02:12:15,527 --> 02:12:16,505
He will die!

2147
02:12:25,537 --> 02:12:26,675
Leave him I say.

2148
02:15:40,565 --> 02:15:44,377
If you dare touch any of us,
we will roll you down into the mat,

2149
02:15:44,569 --> 02:15:45,843
as a corpse! You dog!

2150
02:15:49,574 --> 02:15:49,847
Give way!

2151
02:15:52,377 --> 02:15:53,185
Stand aside!

2152
02:15:54,546 --> 02:15:56,526
- Sir, he.. - Bring him.

2153
02:15:56,948 --> 02:15:58,518
Sir, not me. Him only!

2154
02:15:59,384 --> 02:15:59,828
Take him to the hospital.

2155
02:16:00,185 --> 02:16:02,825
Sir, it's him! Please listen to me.

2156
02:16:21,406 --> 02:16:22,783
Sir, not me..Him only!

2157
02:16:22,974 --> 02:16:24,385
I know!

2158
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:40,169
Hang him!

2159
02:16:46,198 --> 02:16:48,269
No sir! Please don't harm me.

2160
02:17:23,735 --> 02:17:27,376
Sending a Minister to Jail and are you going
to get married and lead a happy life?

2161
02:17:27,572 --> 02:17:29,381
Let me see how you enjoy!

2162
02:17:32,377 --> 02:17:34,687
Now did you realize how the real Jail is?

2163
02:17:42,387 --> 02:17:42,831
Move away!

2164
02:17:57,402 --> 02:18:00,849
Gopi sir! l...!

2165
02:18:02,574 --> 02:18:04,815
Sir...this is too brutal!

2166
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:06,717
Then, do I need to kiss him?

2167
02:18:07,412 --> 02:18:09,949
Charge a case against him for assaulting his
inmate!

2168
02:18:10,382 --> 02:18:11,952
Let him be behind bars for 6 more years.

2169
02:18:12,384 --> 02:18:14,955
That is not his fault. That Hindi fellow assaulted
them!

2170
02:18:15,387 --> 02:18:17,799
Is that why he is in a serious condition in Jail
hospital?

2171
02:18:17,989 --> 02:18:19,366
Do what I say!

2172
02:18:19,557 --> 02:18:22,538
I can't! Not to dance to the tunes of Senior
officer,

2173
02:18:22,727 --> 02:18:23,865
I'm being paid here.

2174
02:18:24,062 --> 02:18:24,540
You!

2175
02:18:24,729 --> 02:18:25,969
Don't shout, sir!

2176
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:28,810
Entire 5th block prisoners have witnessed the
incident.

2177
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,536
They will lodge a complaint to Human rights
commission!

2178
02:18:30,735 --> 02:18:32,976
During the investigation, I will
also give statement favouring them!

2179
02:18:33,405 --> 02:18:35,715
Then, Your cap will be thrown on the roof!

2180
02:18:36,007 --> 02:18:36,542
Hey you! I will..

2181
02:18:36,741 --> 02:18:38,880
You can't do anything to me, sir!

2182
02:18:39,077 --> 02:18:40,385
The power was misused in olden days

2183
02:18:40,745 --> 02:18:44,386
Now, even the Ministers are in jail! Be careful!

2184
02:18:46,051 --> 02:18:46,859
Release him.

2185
02:19:04,436 --> 02:19:05,744
- O my God! - Take the mat.

2186
02:19:06,604 --> 02:19:07,048
Hold him!

2187
02:19:08,773 --> 02:19:10,548
Make him seated! Slowly.

2188
02:19:17,749 --> 02:19:18,056
<i>I will</i> be good for nothing, Kaderikka!

2189
02:19:23,755 --> 02:19:26,031
I will never ever come back to this jail.

2190
02:19:27,425 --> 02:19:28,870
I don't wish to come.

2191
02:19:36,434 --> 02:19:37,742
Don't do anything foolish!

2192
02:19:38,436 --> 02:19:41,576
It's not a big punishment
to the one staying permanently in Jail!

2193
02:19:42,774 --> 02:19:44,583
I've decided his punishment.

2194
02:19:45,443 --> 02:19:48,583
That girl, who is waiting for him...
who cornered me,

2195
02:19:49,614 --> 02:19:50,854
will be killed tonight.

2196
02:19:57,055 --> 02:19:57,556
When he is released from jail tommonlv,
he will see,

2197
02:19:57,889 --> 02:20:01,029
only her dead body! That is his punishment.

2198
02:20:50,542 --> 02:20:52,715
Won't you invite me for your wedding?

2199
02:20:57,048 --> 02:20:59,187
Why are you staring?
What you got is not enough?

2200
02:22:02,213 --> 02:22:03,123
What is all this?

2201
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:17,540
To defend my life, I was forced to kill a person!

2202
02:22:33,978 --> 02:22:34,854
Come... Come...

2203
02:22:47,759 --> 02:22:50,740
If the Court rejects my bail,
I will have to come back here only.

2204
02:22:51,229 --> 02:22:52,867
That won't happen. Go hopefully.

2205
02:23:01,039 --> 02:23:03,747
Did you see the plight of yourfianc\/©?

2206
02:23:04,042 --> 02:23:06,750
Even if you marry him, he will not be of any
use.

2207
02:23:11,215 --> 02:23:14,196
Good! You are back so soon!

2208
02:23:15,353 --> 02:23:16,024
Take her.

2209
02:23:23,394 --> 02:23:25,374
Yourfianc\/©e is really a Tiger.

2210
02:23:25,997 --> 02:23:29,035
Here she goes inside after killing whom I
missed to kill!

2211
02:23:30,234 --> 02:23:32,043
My 5 Iakhs has gone waste!

2212
02:23:33,237 --> 02:23:34,978
Still, look at his destiny,

2213
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:38,743
When he walks out for his marriage,
his fiance comes back in again.

2214
02:23:40,044 --> 02:23:42,786
Also see to it that his fianc\/©e
doesn't lack anything here.

2215
02:23:42,981 --> 02:23:45,723
Don't you know? He is very much dear to me.

2216
02:23:47,986 --> 02:23:50,159
I already have a bad name in that matter!

2217
02:23:50,755 --> 02:23:55,204
Don't worry! I shall take good care of your girl!

2218
02:23:55,893 --> 02:23:58,203
When myself and other policemen get bored of
her,

2219
02:23:58,396 --> 02:23:59,204
then suicide.

2220
02:23:59,397 --> 02:24:01,741
Then, you come and collect her body, ok?

2221
02:24:25,423 --> 02:24:28,233
Leave him...Leave him I say.

2222
02:25:01,793 --> 02:25:03,238

Today is Radhika and Unnikuttan's wedding
day, for which all of us were invited.!!

2227
02:26:57,108 --> 02:26:59,088
Auspicious time is also not over!

Ok then, we shall relish the marriage feast, isn't
it?

2237
02:27:45,022 --> 02:27:45,932
Here, Take it.

2238
02:27:47,458 --> 02:27:49,995
Assume it as grand feast
with 2 types of sweet puddings and have it !.

2239
02:27:50,294 --> 02:27:51,272
But, please don't throw the plates thinking it is
Plaintain leaf!

2240
02:27:51,462 --> 02:27:52,600
We will need it tomorrow.

2241
02:27:53,130 --> 02:27:54,006
Are you not having?

2242
02:27:54,298 --> 02:27:56,278
- I will have Biriyani. - Is there Biriyani?

2243
02:27:56,467 --> 02:27:59,448
When you take it as a marriage feast,
I'll take it as Biriyani!

2244
02:28:02,106 --> 02:28:02,914
Just a minute.

2245
02:28:05,109 --> 02:28:06,986
Gopietta! Lot of gratitude to you!!

2246
02:28:07,278 --> 02:28:10,418
In place of a father,
you perform ed our marriage beautifully.

2247
02:28:11,115 --> 02:28:13,925
Will our 1st night be in this Cell or in our Cell
there ?

2248
02:28:14,452 --> 02:28:18,264
First, you called me brother, then Father
and now, Uncle(Pimp) too?

2249
02:28:18,456 --> 02:28:19,992
1st night only at the time of your Parole!

2250
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:21,929
Enough! Won't I get it today itself?

2251
02:28:22,126 --> 02:28:23,264
At least before 6 p.m?

2252
02:28:23,661 --> 02:28:24,639
Go and have your food.

2253
02:28:25,463 --> 02:28:26,942
Only Feast ahl!

2254
02:28:29,033 --> 02:28:29,943
Why are you laughing?

2255
02:28:30,301 --> 02:28:33,942
I laughed imagining our baby also
will be born in this Jail like me.

2256
02:28:35,473 --> 02:28:38,943
When your child grows big,

2257
02:28:39,143 --> 02:28:41,919
let him not show up here
saying his parents were living here.

2258
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:44,419
I hope you now realized what a real jail is !!

2259
02:28:44,649 --> 02:28:46,424
My God! I very well understood!

2260
02:28:47,118 --> 02:28:49,098
My prayer is that nobody should come here.

2261
02:28:49,453 --> 02:28:51,990
However, We and our children
will never come back here!

2262
02:28:52,290 --> 02:28:53,894
Bye Bye Central Jail!

2263
02:28:57,128 --> 02:29:03,204
"Bye bye bye bye Central jail"

2264
02:29:07,305 --> 02:29:09,012
"Walking around with theft and crookedness,"

2265
02:29:09,307 --> 02:29:11,412
"Ploys failing in the end hand-cuffed"

2266

"Covered by the shawl of darkness,"

2269

"Bored of counting the prison bars day and
night,"

2270
02:29:18,449 --> 02:29:21,259
"Knowing the true colours of the stone
chambers,"

2271
02:29:21,452 --> 02:29:23,625
"Opening the iron gate and at last flying away
from the house,"

2272
02:29:23,955 --> 02:29:24,933
"The hearts say repeatedly, "Go!"."

2273
02:29:25,122 --> 02:29:27,432
"Bye bye bye bye bye Central Jail"

2274

"Bye bye bye bye bye Central Jail"

2276
02:29:37,134 --> 02:29:43,244
"PAROLE PERIOD FOR A NEWLY WEDDED
COUPLE"

2277
02:30:08,299 --> 02:30:12,645
"The space of world shrinking to the knees,"

2278
02:30:13,070 --> 02:30:16,244
"Haughtiness will cease."

2279
02:30:17,074 --> 02:30:21,079
"if trapped once, you will decide certainly"

2280
02:30:21,645 --> 02:30:24,626
"That hereafter no more playfulness"

2281
02:30:26,050 --> 02:30:30,021
"Searching for light, the heart which had lost all
hopes"

2282
02:30:30,287 --> 02:30:33,029
"Will gear up with excitement."

2283
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:34,268
My god! Will the Englishman take her away?

2284
02:30:34,658 --> 02:30:36,433
Let me not waste my parole period.

2285
02:30:37,128 --> 02:30:38,630
"Let the new life in the stone fort,"

2286
02:30:38,796 --> 02:30:43,267
"Not knowing the place, come to an end."

2287
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:47,276
"Central Jail"

2288
02:30:47,471 --> 02:30:50,281
"Bye bye bye Central Jail"

2289
02:30:50,474 --> 02:30:51,452
