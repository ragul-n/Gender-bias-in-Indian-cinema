1
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,541
<span style="style.default_1">Extinct!</span>

2
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,125
<span style="style.default_1">Extinct!</span>

3
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,291
<span style="style.default_1">Take me in your arms!</span>

4
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,250
<span style="style.default_1">Your soul is drunk</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And full of charms</span>

5
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:31,000
<span style="style.default_1">There's tumult everywhere</span>

6
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,916
<span style="style.default_1">You breathe, but don't dare</span>

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,416
<span style="style.default_1">I'm your shadow</span>

8
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,416
<span style="style.default_1">I'm always with you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Just so you know</span>

9
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,541
<span style="style.default_1">You're under a wrong impression</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For ages</span>

10
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:53,625
<span style="style.default_1">That I'm extinct!</span>

11
00:01:54,208 --> 00:02:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a ghost!</span>

12
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,541
<span style="style.default_1">You'll cry with pain and sputter</span>

13
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,208
<span style="style.default_1">Your soul will shudder</span>

14
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:37,291
<span style="style.default_1">I am on a killing spree</span>

15
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,541
<span style="style.default_1">Now you just can't stop me</span>

16
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:46,666
<span style="style.default_1">You're under a wrong impression</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For ages</span>

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,166
<span style="style.default_1">That I'm extinct!</span>

18
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,375
<span style="style.default_1">Everyone will die</span>

19
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a ghost!</span>

20
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,708
<span style="style.default_1">Extinct!</span>

21
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,791
As you know

22
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,125
we have brought the majority of the shares
of Technocrat Company.

23
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,500
That's very good news, sir.

24
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,041
This merger will bring us
a tax benefit.

25
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,375
Our real estate sector is doing
good business.

26
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,541
Mr. Mehta?

27
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,958
Would you like to say anything?

28
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,791
Sir, the competition is very tough but...

29
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,750
I don't want to give my competitors
a chance.

30
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:24,958
Tyagi?

31
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,333
Tapan, touch up her makeup.

32
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,833
Why are you looking at me like that?

33
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,958
-Tanu.
-Yes?

34
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,625
Sam?

35
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,166
What happened, baby?

36
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,291
You won't mend your ways, will you?

37
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,500
This is not right, Sam.

38
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,250
Your dad is always upset with you
because of your mischief.

39
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,708
Nobody in the family appreciates my talent

40
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,708
that's why I am going to the US.

41
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,833
I'll be gone in two months
and won't be back for four years.

42
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,291
Thank God you are going.

43
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:02,916
That's enough mischief for the day.

44
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,125
Good night, Tanu.

45
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,625
Get lost!

46
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,083
Okay, sorry.

47
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,750
She gets angry at the drop of a hat.

48
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,625
Coward!

49
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,333
What have you decided
about the vacation, Harsh?

50
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,875
Tell me where you want to go.

51
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,416
All of us will go together.

52
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,166
I don't have time for these stupid things.

53
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,958
As of now, business is my priority.

54
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,083
Sometimes you should prioritize
your family too, Harsh.

55
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,000
Harsh, this vacation isn't just for me,

56
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,750
but it's important for Tanu and Sam too.

57
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,083
Don't you think we should
spend some time with them?

58
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,708
Then you spend time with them.
Who is stopping you?

59
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,291
Here.

60
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,333
Dad, did you see my new tattoo?

61
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,625
Make a tattoo on your face.

62
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,375
I'm sure there will be nothing prominent
than it.

63
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,166
Bye, darling.

64
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,500
Stop the car!

65
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,541
What happened, sir?

66
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,916
Nothing. Let's go.

67
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,375
Sunil, don't drive towards the office.

68
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,708
-Take me to Gomati Nagar.
-Okay, sir.

69
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,500
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes I see people,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but they are not there.</span>

70
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,208
Harsh, going by what you are saying,
you're a case of chronic insomnia.

71
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,500
Chronic insomnia.

72
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,125
If having sleepless nights is a disease,
then I've been ill for years.

73
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,125
I am aware of that.

74
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:14,166
Some people see things that others don't.

75
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,833
But this could become serious.

76
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,083
I don't have the time
to take a break.

77
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,875
You have to make time, Harsh.

78
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,166
The coffee is good.

79
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,416
I know you are very ambitious.

80
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,416
All the psychiatrists in the world say,

81
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,500
I am not just a psychiatrist.

82
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,458
No harm will come to you.

83
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,791
You know Sam is a prankster.

84
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,500
You and Mom have spoiled him.

85
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,458
That reminds me.

86
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,416
Mom was asking about you.

87
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,041
Mom always asks about me.

88
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,708
Has he ever asked about me?

89
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,458
He never even greeted me.

90
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,416
Is he upset with me?

91
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,500
Why do you think that?

92
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,208
Did he ever say that?

93
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,625
That's the problem.

94
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,583
He never says anything...
yet he speaks a lot.

95
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,083
He gives me a look,
and I understand that he's saying,

96
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,833
Brief the HODs of Kumar Construction
about our work culture.

97
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:08,916
Sure, sir.

98
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,583
-Inform Bakshi.
-Sure.

99
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,083
And listen...

100
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,541
-Huh?
-You were saying something.

101
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,458
Um...

102
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,041
Golf city project papers.

103
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,750
Bring the papers, and I'll sign them.

104
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey, Vidya.

105
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,250
Um.

106
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,875
Are you sure I'll be fine
if I take a break?

107
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,750
Are you still thinking?

108
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,125
No, uh...

109
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,166
Well, actually...

110
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,958
<span style="style.default_1">I'm going on a vacation</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with my family today.</span>

111
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,250
Good. Finally, you gave in.

112
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,875
How could I have not?

113
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,958
<span style="style.default_1">Apart from being a doctor,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you're also my friend.</span>

114
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,500
Our manager,

115
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,625
Raghav met with an accident on the site.

116
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,250
Tyagi, give compensation to his family.

117
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,916
You will personally monitor
all the departments till I am back

118
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,083
and update me.

119
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,416
Yes.

120
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,791
So you've achieved everything.

121
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,833
You are greedy for success, aren't you?

122
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes, I am.

123
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,916
And every ambitious person should be.

124
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,791
And I want to see

125
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,125
where your ambition takes you.

126
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,583
Look at yourself, Satish.

127
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,375
You haven't moved up in life.

128
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,666
I don't care for progress.

129
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,500
Although I haven't moved up in life,

130
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,791
my conscience is still alive.

131
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,541
Conscience.

132
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,958
That's good.

133
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,125
Good luck to you.

134
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,125
I've been calling you, Harsh.

135
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,500
Are you going to upset the kids
this time too?

136
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,583
Sam, did you see my charger?

137
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,250
Yes, I have.

138
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,750
It's white in color.

139
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,333
You are just impossible!

140
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,666
-Did you take your inhaler?
-Yes, Mom.

141
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,083
-Please bring my bag downstairs.
-Sure.

142
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,125
-Yes, Tanu.
-Rahul, where are you?

143
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,750
I'm in the office.

144
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,958
<span style="style.default_1">Sorry. I have to forward some pictures</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to the client and it's very urgent.</span>

145
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,458
Did you really have to do this today?

146
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,750
It's a moment of crisis, Tanu.

147
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,750
Please get here as soon as possible. Bye.

148
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,250
-Hey, listen.
-<span style="style.default_1">Yes, tell me.</span>

149
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,958
Is it important for me to come along
on this vacation?

150
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,750
Are you kidding me?

151
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,500
Do you know how difficult it was for Mom
to convince Dad?

152
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,708
Since you are insisting, I'll come.

153
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,000
You kept your promise.

154
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,250
Look at him.

155
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,000
Mom, I'll get something to eat.

156
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,458
Come on, Tanu.

157
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,458
Um, shall I tell you a joke?

158
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,750
I'll tell you anyway.

159
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,416
The joke is about a father and his son.

160
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,625
So, Father.

161
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,958
A father asks his son,

162
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,708
"Have you ever done anything

163
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,416
so that I could hold my head high?"

164
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:45,833
What do you think the son says?

165
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,208
His son says,

166
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,583
"Yes,

167
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,041
once...

168
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,541
I tucked a pillow under your head.

169
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,708
Did you forget that?"

170
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,541
It's funny.

171
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,083
That's how he held his head high.

172
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,166
What happened, Dad?

173
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,291
Did you not get the joke?

174
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,000
Not a problem. I have one more joke.

175
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,541
This one is world class.

176
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,916
It's about an ant.

177
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,250
Once an ant--

178
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,166
Dad, he won't keep quiet.

179
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,375
Mom, please switch on the radio.

180
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,791
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved has gone to Rangoon</span>

181
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,958
<span style="style.default_1">And he called me to say</span>

182
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,125
<span style="style.default_1">That he misses me</span>

183
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,333
<span style="style.default_1">That he misses me</span>

184
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,875
<span style="style.default_1">And it's killing him</span>

185
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,208
Dad, can you please switch on
the Bluetooth?

186
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,625
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

187
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:51,000
<span style="style.default_1">My darling, I'll bite your lip</span>

188
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,666
<span style="style.default_1">Why are you going away from me?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let me love you</span>

189
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,666
<span style="style.default_1">Don't be scared of the world</span>

190
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,958
<span style="style.default_1">Jump into the bed</span>

191
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,666
<span style="style.default_1">Jump into the bed</span>

192
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,041
<span style="style.default_1">Come on the bed</span>

193
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,416
He's going to get a good beating.

194
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,791
<span style="style.default_1">Jump into the bed</span>

195
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,208
Hey, listen.

196
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,791
Why isn't the traffic moving?

197
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,041
A major accident took place.

198
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,166
It will take around two hours
for the traffic to clear up.

199
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,541
-Two hours?
-Yes.

200
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,750
Where are you going?

201
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,333
It's a long break, Tanu.
I'm going for a walk.

202
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,458
Are we going back?

203
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,541
Will you shut up now?

204
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,541
Harsh, what's the matter?

205
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,291
I know another route.

206
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,958
Let's take that.

207
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,083
Which route is this, Harsh?

208
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,541
There are neither lights nor signboards.

209
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,041
Are we heading in the right direction?

210
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,625
Yes.

211
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,583
Mom, don't you trust Dad?

212
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,000
Harsh, let's pull over and ask him.

213
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,541
You may ask him if you want.

214
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:01,833
Excuse me.

215
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,125
Where does this road lead to?

216
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,083
It doesn't matter
where this road leads to.

217
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,166
Where do you want to go?

218
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,416
-Dad, let's move.
-I will leave.

219
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,250
What's the hurry?

220
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,958
What's your problem?

221
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,750
-Mine?
-Yes.

222
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,916
I don't have a problem.

223
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,583
My car does.

224
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,625
It heats up.

225
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,458
It heats up at regular intervals.

226
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,541
By the way, you didn't tell me

227
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,333
where you are headed.

228
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,666
-Well...
-I'll tell you.

229
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,583
Um...

230
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,041
Would you please come here?

231
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,500
Where is the graveyard?

232
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:31,041
It can be anywhere.

233
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,125
Maybe it's right at this spot.

234
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,791
I want to get rid of a dead body
that's in my trunk.

235
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:54,541
Yes.

236
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,125
What a weird guy!

237
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,458
Quite an interesting man.

238
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:22,333
You need to confirm
everything with dad, don't you?

239
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:23,833
He is my old man!

240
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:29,916
Why are you laughing?

241
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Just like that.

242
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,208
I think that stroller fell out of a car.

243
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,291
Dad, let me check.

244
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,583
Hello.

245
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,416
Sam, what's wrong?

246
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,583
Get up, dear!

247
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,583
It's the limit!

248
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,166
He's always cracking jokes.

249
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,208
Do you think I'm joking?

250
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,750
-Yes...
-Move it!

251
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,500
Get in.

252
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,666
Why do you do such things?

253
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,500
Rahul, who would keep a stroller...

254
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,375
There's no cell reception here.

255
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:14,375
<span style="style.default_1">Everyone will die.</span>

256
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,958
Mom, I think he's still upset.

257
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,250
He'll be fine.

258
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,416
I know him.

259
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,125
What will we do now?

260
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,291
We've been waiting here for quite a while.

261
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,250
And I don't see any cars
driving by.

262
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,416
No cell reception.

263
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,750
Looking for the graveyard?

264
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,125
Actually, our car broke down.

265
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,416
Many cars break down along this path.

266
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,500
Mine also broke down.

267
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,916
I asked for your help.

268
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,583
-Good.
-What?

269
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,083
It's good to say sorry.

270
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:16,750
I've been trying to make a call,
but the cell phone reception is terrible.

271
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,000
You won't get it.

272
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,375
No reception.

273
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,333
Is there a garage nearby?

274
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,416
It's just me here.

275
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,916
I have a cottage.

276
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,291
It's nearby.

277
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,791
It's quite desolated...

278
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,541
while I am away.

279
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,250
Now that I'm here...

280
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,333
If you wish...

281
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,708
you can spend the night there.

282
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,291
Excuse me?

283
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,333
Only if you wish...

284
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,833
Some animal must have had fun
on the swing.

285
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,291
They come here quite often.

286
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:45,291
Why are you still standing?
Please, have a seat.

287
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,833
Thank you, mister.
You did so much for us.

288
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,375
I haven't done anything yet.

289
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:56,958
No, I mean...

290
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,250
My son played a prank on you.

291
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:03,166
-I am sorry for that.
-That's the bedroom.

292
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,541
-Mom, I'll get the bags.
-Hmm.

293
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,875
You didn't tell me where you were going.

294
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:24,000
I guess you'll spend the better part
of your vacation here.

295
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,416
The cell phone reception here is terrible.

296
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,750
Do you have any suggestions?

297
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,291
If someone could help me fix my car?

298
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:32,541
There's no help nearby.

299
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,000
That's the problem here.

300
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,083
Your cottage is located
in such a deserted area.

301
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,250
-Do you live alone here?
-They don't let me.

302
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,916
-Who?
-The people.

303
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:57,291
-Oh.
-Different types of people.

304
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,791
The animals are frequent visitors
these days.

305
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:05,458
Hmm.

306
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,166
So the bird fled.

307
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,875
It had to flee someday.

308
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,333
Are you sleeping well?

309
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,750
What?

310
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,416
Hmm.

311
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,166
You shouldn't have scolded him.

312
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,458
Let's wait until morning
before taking a decision.

313
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:31,958
What are you doing, Sam?

314
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,458
Tanu, the doll...

315
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:45,375
There was blood on...

316
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,541
my fingers...

317
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,916
The doll was bleeding.

318
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,000
You got a tight slap from Dad.
Still, you didn't mend your ways.

319
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,041
Tanu, I'm telling you--

320
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:01,916
Look, the doll...

321
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:20,333
Sam won't mend his ways.

322
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,250
-What happened?
-He says that a doll was bleeding.

323
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,083
It's all a buildup, Tanu.

324
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,458
He's definitely up to something.

325
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,166
Dad is also upset with him.

326
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,083
He's a kid.

327
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:43,166
He likes to entertain people.

328
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:48,458
When we're staying
in someone else's cottage!

329
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,416
Who will knock some sense into him?

330
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,541
I am also pissed now.

331
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,375
You look beautiful when you are pissed.

332
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,833
Sam? What are you doing, Sam?

333
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,666
Sam, what are you doing?

334
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:35,375
Everyone will die!

335
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,125
"Everyone will die!"

336
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,000
"There's a dead body in the trunk."

337
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,083
"Where's the graveyard?"

338
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,041
What do you do?

339
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:49,291
Look, I am not in the mood to talk.

340
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,541
What you did just now...

341
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,166
I didn't like it.

342
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:06,041
I told you, I am not in the mood to talk.

343
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,750
I don't want to talk to you.

344
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:15,166
-How old are you?
-I don't want to talk to you!

345
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:17,125
Don't you get it?

346
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:33,833
I am talking to you, Sam!

347
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:42,541
Sam, wait.

348
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,625
Will it make any difference?

349
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:03,833
Please, forgive him. He is a kid.

350
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,291
Wait.

351
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,083
Why are you doing this?

352
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:34,125
You started pissing everyone off
just because you got slapped.

353
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,583
I am not doing anything.

354
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,166
I don't know what's going on here.

355
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:43,083
Don't you think
you're pushing things too far?

356
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,458
Believe me.

357
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,583
Something is wrong with this place.

358
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:51,833
I don't know how the stroller ended up
in the middle of the road.

359
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:57,000
I saw a doll at the cottage.
It was bleeding.

360
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,375
There was blood on my fingers too.

361
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,458
But it disappeared all of a sudden.

362
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,166
I told Tanu about it,

363
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,125
but she thought I was fooling around.

364
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,250
Rahul, believe me.

365
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:16,125
I don't want to be here or go on vacation.

366
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,458
That's a nice story.

367
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,375
Tell me, what are you up to?

368
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,458
I'm not fooling around. Please!

369
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,000
I know. You don't fool around.

370
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,250
You are a serious person.

371
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,916
Listen to me. Please.

372
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,166
The car is working.

373
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,250
The car is working.

374
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,416
Did Sam come back?

375
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,000
No, but Rahul went out to find him.

376
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:53,833
He must be around.

377
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,208
Let me check.

378
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,208
Where's Dev?

379
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,416
We need to leave immediately.

380
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:00,083
But Sam is missing.

381
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:02,125
Dad, I am scared.

382
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,583
What happened, my son?

383
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,958
What happened, my son?

384
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,250
What's wrong, dear?

385
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:12,916
Please, dear!

386
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:18,208
Please call an ambulance.

387
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,583
You'll be fine, dear, please!

388
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:28,625
<span style="style.default_1">-Help! Sam! My son.</span>
-Hello!

389
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:31,291
-Wha... Hello?
-Sam!

390
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:34,208
The woman says her child...

391
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,541
-No cell phone reception!
-Sam!

392
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,916
Tanu!

393
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,125
It's okay, son.

394
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:50,666
Tanu, control yourself, please!

395
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,416
Tanu, dear, it's okay. Tanu...

396
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:00,666
Here.

397
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,166
What happened, son?

398
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:03,333
Who did this to you?

399
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,041
Sam, dear.

400
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,375
-A girl...
-Yes.

401
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:14,625
Which... which girl, son?

402
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:19,958
No, no, son!

403
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,916
You'll be fine.

404
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,250
You'll be fine!

405
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,750
Sam, what's happening?

406
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,916
Sam! My child!

407
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,208
-Yes?
-Tell me!

408
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,083
My son!

409
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:37,166
What's happening?

410
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,000
What's happening, Sam?

411
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,416
Please forgive me.

412
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:43,250
Wake up, son.

413
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,208
Sam, don't bluff. It's not funny.

414
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,541
You won't scold Sam again, right?

415
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,166
See, I've told him.

416
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,833
He won't scold you again.

417
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,041
Wake up now, Sam.

418
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,666
Dev killed Sam.

419
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:54,625
He'll pay for this.

420
01:07:56,583 --> 01:08:00,166
Right now, we need to move Shalini
and Tanu out of here.

421
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:13,791
We don't have any other choice.

422
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:26,250
Okay but... Shalini must not know that...

423
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,916
Sam's in the trunk.

424
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:44,875
I'm so sorry, son.

425
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:52,291
<span style="style.default_1">What is it that follows us?</span>

426
01:08:54,916 --> 01:09:00,291
<span style="style.default_1">A cloud of gloom</span>
<span style="style.default_1">A shadow of doom</span>

427
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:10,666
<span style="style.default_1">What is it that follows us?</span>

428
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,125
<span style="style.default_1">A cloud of gloom</span>
<span style="style.default_1">A shadow of doom</span>

429
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:21,458
<span style="style.default_1">Every moment feels like the last</span>

430
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:26,916
<span style="style.default_1">Every route we take leaves us in the dark</span>

431
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:32,166
<span style="style.default_1">Is there any light</span>
<span style="style.default_1">At the end of the tunnel?</span>

432
01:09:32,666 --> 01:09:39,125
<span style="style.default_1">Or are we cursed to lose our way forever?</span>

433
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:45,750
<span style="style.default_1">The whispers in the dark</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Are getting louder</span>

434
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:51,458
<span style="style.default_1">They deafen our screams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">As danger shines brighter</span>

435
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:56,750
<span style="style.default_1">The whispers in the dark</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Are getting louder</span>

436
01:09:56,833 --> 01:10:03,375
<span style="style.default_1">They deafen our screams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">As danger shines brighter</span>

437
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:12,750
Where's Sam?

438
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,500
Where's Sam?

439
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:34,833
Why are you quiet?

440
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:48,583
Tell me, Tanu.

441
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,041
Where's Sam?

442
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:16,625
Don't cry.

443
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,458
He'll come back.

444
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,291
Dear?

445
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:21,750
It's okay, dear.

446
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:32,166
Give me the gun, Shalini.

447
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:37,875
Where's Sam, Harsh?

448
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:42,458
He'll come back.

449
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:46,625
You're lying.

450
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:51,416
You're lying as always, Harsh.

451
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:56,708
The gun, Shalini?

452
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,958
Why did you slap Sam?

453
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:02,583
Okay... it was a mistake.

454
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:04,458
A mistake.

455
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:07,916
A mistake?

456
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,500
It was a grave mistake.

457
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:16,666
You thought...

458
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:20,166
you could just pay your kids
and be a good father?

459
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,000
You treated your family
like your business, Harsh.

460
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,625
No feelings.

461
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:31,750
No emotions.

462
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,458
You were always selfish.

463
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,791
Always.

464
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,583
<span style="style.default_1">Your</span> business.

465
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,416
<span style="style.default_1">Your</span> wealth.

466
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:45,916
<span style="style.default_1">Your</span> fame.

467
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,791
It was always about <span style="style.default_1">you.</span>

468
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,541
Never about the family.

469
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,416
Did you ever think about us?

470
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:03,541
You couldn't become a good husband...

471
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,125
or a good father.

472
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:11,708
Please give me the gun.

473
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:14,666
-Where's Sam?
-He'll come back, okay?

474
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,666
-Get me Sam, Harsh.
-I will.

475
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:18,875
Get me Sam, Harsh...

476
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,000
-Drop the gun!
-... or I'll shoot myself.

477
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:25,208
Drop the gun, Shalini.

478
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,416
Where are you going, Shalini?

479
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,791
Stop, Sam!

480
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:33,000
Aunty, wake up.

481
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:38,666
Wake up, Shalini!

482
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,291
Dad? What happened?

483
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,083
Nothing.

484
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:35,208
<span style="style.default_1">Mom!</span>

485
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:07,750
Did you hear it?

486
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:41,375
You've put Sam in the trunk.

487
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:53,875
Harsh, get him out of there.

488
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,291
Aunty, there's nobody in the trunk.

489
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:04,250
He wants to get out, Harsh.

490
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,416
He's suffocating in there.

491
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:14,458
Stop the car, Harsh.

492
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,833
Mom, please stop it.

493
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:21,666
Stop.

494
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:26,000
Or else I'll jump out.

495
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,500
Stop... the car.

496
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:43,666
Stop it or else I'll jump out.

497
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,125
Shalini, why are you behaving like this?

498
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:49,166
Mom, please control yourself.

499
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:52,541
-Stop the car, Harsh.
-Enough, Shalini!

500
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,541
-Mom!
-Shalini!

501
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:46,500
All of you...

502
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:49,166
-will die.
-What?

503
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:03,708
No, Shalini. No, no.

504
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:57,000
<span style="style.default_1">Who watches us from dark corners?</span>

505
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:04,916
<span style="style.default_1">Their silence drops on us like terror</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It makes us gasp with horror</span>

506
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:14,791
<span style="style.default_1">Who watches us from dark corners?</span>

507
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:20,166
<span style="style.default_1">Their silence drops on us like terror</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It makes us gasp with horror</span>

508
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:25,583
<span style="style.default_1">How do we escape their pursuit?</span>

509
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:31,750
<span style="style.default_1">They come after us with a blanket of death</span>

510
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:38,791
<span style="style.default_1">We run in the open scared</span>
<span style="style.default_1">With no end in sight</span>

511
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:45,250
<span style="style.default_1">Perhaps our surrender will bring an end</span>
<span style="style.default_1">To this fight</span>

512
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:52,333
<span style="style.default_1">Is there any light</span>
<span style="style.default_1">At the end of the tunnel?</span>

513
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:57,958
<span style="style.default_1">Or are we cursed to lose our way forever?</span>

514
01:23:58,041 --> 01:24:03,041
<span style="style.default_1">The whispers in the dark</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Are getting louder</span>

515
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:08,666
<span style="style.default_1">They deafen our screams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">As danger shines brighter</span>

516
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:14,000
<span style="style.default_1">The whispers in the dark</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Are getting louder</span>

517
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:20,666
<span style="style.default_1">They deafen our screams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">As danger shines brighter</span>

518
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,166
Stop... stop the car.

519
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,333
-What happened, sir?
-Reverse.

520
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:07,000
How can this be?

521
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,125
What happened, Dad?

522
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:15,333
We've been driving for so long...

523
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,708
and Lucknow is still 145 miles away.

524
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,666
Go back a little.

525
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:45,708
The cottage again?

526
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:55,125
We've driven almost 60 miles...

527
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,583
and we didn't take any turn either.

528
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,625
Many cars break down along this path.

529
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:10,666
<span style="style.default_1">I have a cottage too.</span>

530
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:12,625
I haven't done anything yet.

531
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,125
<span style="style.default_1">There's no help nearby.</span>

532
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:43,250
Dad... what are you doing?

533
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,416
Drive to the cottage.

534
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,458
Have you lost it?

535
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:26,708
Who are you?

536
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,791
The pictures of the murdered people
in your room.

537
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,791
And the murder instruments...

538
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:40,916
-What are they all about?
-You went inside my room?

539
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,708
You didn't answer my question.

540
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,833
Those pictures were a part of my research.

541
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:56,000
You can verify them if you want.

542
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:35,791
He's telling the truth.

543
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,750
Ghosts, spirits, phantoms...

544
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:47,291
I don't believe in them.

545
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:50,458
My next book is about denying
their existence.

546
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:57,458
Is there any turn in the road ahead
that could bring us back here?

547
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,750
No.

548
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:02,416
There's no turn ahead
that would bring you back here.

549
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,000
You left your baggage behind?

550
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:13,375
Where are your... wife and son?

551
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,916
How did it happen?

552
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:46,833
Sam had told me...

553
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,958
this was a bad place.

554
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,333
Something's wrong here.

555
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,125
Yes.

556
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:01,291
Sam and mom tried to
tell us something.

557
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:06,916
Sam saw a doll and a little girl here.

558
01:31:09,666 --> 01:31:11,666
He did mention a stroller.

559
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,708
There was an accident on this road
two years ago.

560
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:24,291
An entire family died in that accident.

561
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,416
Including a little girl.

562
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,333
A stroller...

563
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:37,500
A doll.

564
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:43,166
It was in the papers for so many days
and... then it died down.

565
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:53,416
Shalini and Sam died...

566
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:55,958
because of me.

567
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:05,625
What are you saying?

568
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:17,750
It happened two years ago.

569
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:23,625
Vinod Kumar was my biggest competitor.

570
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,166
That night...

571
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:29,833
he attended...

572
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:32,416
a corporate party.

573
01:32:33,541 --> 01:32:34,875
What's caught your attention?

574
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,500
Nothing.

575
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:39,083
I'm just watching.

576
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:43,291
I see. Kumar.

577
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:47,166
He bags the best entrepreneur award
again this year.

578
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:51,291
You're stressed for no reason.

579
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:53,083
Come on, this is a party.

580
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:10,666
The newspapers are praising you
to the sky these days.

581
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:14,333
You've achieved so much
in such a short time.

582
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:16,250
What's the secret to your success?

583
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:20,916
Life doesn't offer you
too many chances to succeed.

584
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,166
So I believe...

585
01:33:23,916 --> 01:33:27,125
you have to utilize your time prudently.

586
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:34,958
Geeta.

587
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,750
Uncle, it's my birthday tomorrow.

588
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,208
You all are invited.

589
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:11,583
I don't miss a trick
when it comes to business.

590
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:17,041
But Kumar is
always a step ahead of me.

591
01:34:19,916 --> 01:34:23,750
I need the Brian Constructions contract
and I need it bad.

592
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:32,333
Kumar is also bidding for the same.

593
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:57,916
Papa, when will we reach home?

594
01:34:59,375 --> 01:35:00,708
Very soon, darling.

595
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:03,291
I'll make preparations for my birthday

596
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:06,541
and I'll also invite all my friends.

597
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:09,625
Yes. Riya will invite all her friends
to her birthday.

598
01:35:17,416 --> 01:35:20,416
Harsh, you're drunk.
Don't step on the gas.

599
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:22,166
Relax, pal.

600
01:35:24,541 --> 01:35:27,583
Mom, you promised me

601
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:30,458
you'd gift me a big teddy bear.

602
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,750
Yes, Riya.
Mom remembers everything.

603
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:38,291
I'll get you a huge teddy bear
first thing in the morning.

604
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:54,000
Is that Kumar?

605
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:42,250
Dear.

606
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:48,666
Dear.

607
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:50,416
Can you hear me, darling?

608
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:03,583
Help!

609
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:23,166
My daughter...

610
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,625
You said...

611
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:44,458
So?

612
01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:46,750
Kumar's dead.

613
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:49,208
And so is the competition.

614
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:51,208
-Don't talk rubbish, Harsh.
-Help...

615
01:38:12,166 --> 01:38:13,250
Now listen to me.

616
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:14,916
You should come along.

617
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:48,958
Help!

618
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:29,916
I left a family to die
in the middle of the road

619
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,583
because I was a selfish man.

620
01:39:35,583 --> 01:39:40,708
My family paid a brutal price
for my misdeeds.

621
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:23,833
Riya?

622
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:34,875
No one's there.

623
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:36,125
I just saw her.

624
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:38,208
She is somewhere around.

625
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:40,875
She's to be blamed for this.

626
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:44,416
What are you trying to say?

627
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:46,666
Are you saying...

628
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:48,875
that a spirit is doing this?

629
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:50,916
You're imagining things.

630
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:54,208
Ghosts, spirits, ghouls.

631
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,708
These are only stories.

632
01:40:57,333 --> 01:40:58,333
They are just not true.

633
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:09,208
You okay, dear?

634
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:39,833
What's wrong, dear?

635
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:08,666
Dear, breathe.

636
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:14,250
Dear.

637
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,416
Just take a deep breath, dear.

638
01:42:46,833 --> 01:42:47,791
Geeta?

639
01:42:56,541 --> 01:42:59,541
Harsh, now you know how it feels
to lose your loved ones.

640
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:05,000
You took away what we loved the most.

641
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:19,833
I saw my wife and son dying
right before my eyes.

642
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,958
Please spare my daughter.

643
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,541
-Kill me instead.
-I won't spare you so easily.

644
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:32,333
You still have to witness
your daughter's death.

645
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:33,333
No...

646
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,416
I want to see you writhe in pain.

647
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:38,166
No...

648
01:43:38,541 --> 01:43:39,500
No...

649
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,291
I made a mistake.

650
01:43:48,083 --> 01:43:50,000
I made a big mistake.

651
01:43:51,375 --> 01:43:53,041
Please spare my daughter.

652
01:43:58,541 --> 01:44:00,666
My daughter was dying.

653
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:04,416
And I asked for your help.

654
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,041
-You know what you've done.
-I made a mistake.

655
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:16,916
Please spare my daughter.

656
01:44:58,916 --> 01:45:00,083
No!

657
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:07,625
Dear.

658
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:09,000
No, dear.

659
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:11,000
You'll be okay, dear.

660
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:03,541
You want me to agonize
over my daughter's death.

661
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,583
What if I die?

662
01:47:56,791 --> 01:48:00,083
<span style="style.default_1">I've always known and believed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in only two inevitable truths.</span>

663
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:01,541
<span style="style.default_1">Life and death.</span>

664
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:05,666
<span style="style.default_1">But this whole episode brought me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">face-to-face with one more ugly truth.</span>

665
01:48:06,083 --> 01:48:08,583
<span style="style.default_1">The existence of spirits and ghosts.</span>

666
01:48:08,958 --> 01:48:12,666
<span style="style.default_1">We're caught in this endless</span>
<span style="style.default_1">cycle of life and death.</span>

667
01:48:12,916 --> 01:48:14,166
<span style="style.default_1">Except spirits.</span>

668
01:48:14,875 --> 01:48:16,375
<span style="style.default_1">Because spirits do exist.</span>

669
01:48:16,666 --> 01:48:18,583
<span style="style.default_1">They are around us.</span>

670
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:19,875
Dev Shukla

671
01:48:24,416 --> 01:48:26,208
Extinct
