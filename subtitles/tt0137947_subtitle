1
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:21,561
"The sky calls out to the earth."

2
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:28,427
"Come to your beloved."

3
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:33,372
"You will have to come!"

4
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:41,710
"You will have to leave this world."

5
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:48,549
"You will have to break
all these illusionary ties."

6
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,765
"You will have to go!"

7
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:15,888
Here are your belongings.
Hope they are okay.

8
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:20,888
Mohan, you are going
back to the outside world...

9
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:25,608
...which considers you a murderer,
criminal & antisocial.

10
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:29,008
Don't try to come back to jail.

11
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,408
Else, you won't be in
a position to go out again.

12
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:36,408
Go, you are free now.

13
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:43,438
"This journey..."

14
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:47,448
"...of life."

15
00:02:55,843 --> 00:03:00,910
"This journey of life."

16
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,937
"This journey of life..."

17
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:08,817
"...will always continue."

18
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,316
"But alas! We won't be there..."

19
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:14,072
"...will always continue."

20
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,667
"But alas! We won't be there."

21
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:22,302
"This journey of life."

22
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:32,488
"We have to go someday,
Nor time or the world."

23
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:38,491
"We have to go someday,
Nor time or the world."

24
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:49,612
"No one can help you,
you have to leave everything behind."

25
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:56,004
"No one can help you,
you have to leave everything behind."

26
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:04,112
"We will have to go alone."

27
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,721
"This journey of life..."

28
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:09,437
"...will always continue."

29
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:12,045
"But alas! We won't be there."

30
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:17,193
"This journey of life."

31
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,409
"This journey of life."

32
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,732
The same life,
the same journey and the same path.

33
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,394
But we never reached the...

34
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:55,556
...destination together.
Where have those days gone?

35
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,408
- Greetings, teacher.
- Greetings.

36
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:32,461
- You smoke!
- No, sir.

37
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,839
- No? Then where is it coming from?
- I just ate hot 'Khichidi'.

38
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:40,848
You ate at home and vapour
coming out in the school!

39
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:42,407
Get lost.

40
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,648
What's all this!

41
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:59,340
You people are always
doing something. Stupid!

42
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,042
- Is everyone present?
- Yes, master.

43
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,812
Yesterday's lesson...

44
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,008
You tell me where do
we get plenty of water from?

45
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,448
From my grandma's eyes.

46
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,156
Nonsense, it comes from the skies.

47
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:28,208
Mohan, you tell me...

48
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,448
...what is the best
thing to do in the world?

49
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:34,728
Love.

50
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:45,113
It shows you will
definitely prosper in life.

51
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:48,953
- What are you hiding behind?
- Nothing.

52
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,793
Nothing? Let me see.

53
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,113
I know why you always
have soar throat.

54
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:00,753
Best thing in the world is love and...

55
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:03,193
...the worst thing is guava.

56
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,148
Who is the nicest person in the world?

57
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,026
You tell us.

58
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:10,833
My father.

59
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:15,147
Sit down. You won't study.

60
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:20,153
I wonder why parents
produce children like you.

61
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:26,033
Manju, who is the nicest
person in the world?

62
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:29,833
It's Mohan.

63
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,308
Of course,
who can be more lovable than...

64
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,457
...flute playing Krishna!

65
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:39,971
But he is God not human.

66
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:45,353
Father, you said God
takes birth as human too.

67
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:48,403
He used to.

68
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:55,322
These days even he
is afraid of humans.

69
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:58,273
What's this, teacher?

70
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:10,795
Walk straight. You can never do that.

71
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:17,943
You rascal you haven't
spared master too.

72
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:21,335
Get lost.

73
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:30,930
Where are you rushing to? Come here.

74
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,192
Father, Manju and
me are going to play.

75
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:37,593
There is no end to your playing.

76
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,498
You starve yourself unnecessarily.

77
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:44,593
- Sit here and eat this.
- We will share it.

78
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:49,913
Wear shoes.
Else you may get hurt and cry.

79
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:57,553
God only knows when my son
will be an educated young man!

80
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:02,953
When will I prosper
and set up a store.

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,951
Mohan is an idiot.

82
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:12,130
He eats food raw.
He is a kitten.

83
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,525
Mohan is an idiot.
He eats raw food.

84
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:16,984
He's a kitten.

85
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:25,153
Don't bring more mud.
The house is ready.

86
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:31,953
- House is ready, but...
- But, what?

87
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:34,273
I'm afraid of a storm.

88
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,999
A storm cannot ruin them.

89
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,377
I've built it on a height.

90
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:50,513
Those fall apart first.
This is after all a mud house.

91
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,066
It is as good as steel.

92
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:57,993
No storm or cyclone can destroy it.

93
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:00,793
Okay, let us set it up.

94
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:06,553
- It's me the lady of the house.
- It's me, man of the house.

95
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:13,553
House and we are ready but...

96
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:18,433
- But what?
- We are alone in our respective houses.

97
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:20,313
What if someone kidnaps you?

98
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:24,313
I'm afraid too. Let's close the doors.

99
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,833
Where is my house?

100
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,833
- Why did you destroy my house?
- Why did you hide it from me?

101
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:47,433
- I'll break your head.
- I'll break you jaw.

102
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:51,833
Never mind, Mohan.
We will build another one.

103
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:06,258
He is always in a hurry.

104
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,541
Mohan is an idiot.
He eats raw food. He is a kitten.

105
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,393
The house and memories
behind it are alive.

106
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,793
And the innocent childhood.

107
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:31,873
That was the life we
are used to play with these.

108
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:35,873
We used to play with toys then and...

109
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:38,825
...now...

110
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:43,233
...with some other toy.

111
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:51,153
My day doesn't begin until I see you.

112
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:58,014
Strange!
I feel the same way about you.

113
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,913
You are the sun and I'm the dawn.

114
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,433
Hope we will never be separated.

115
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:06,953
- Not when we are still alive.
- Then tell about tomorrow.

116
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:09,713
I'll tell you tomorrow.

117
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,635
I don't like postponing.
You have to tell me now.

118
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:20,793
Listen. I forget about
the world when I meet you.

119
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:26,593
You are very good looking, handsome.

120
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:29,296
You are so romantic.

121
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:35,393
I wish... to marry you.

122
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,052
Really!

123
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,993
Then the prince replied
holding the sword...

124
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:49,953
I won't marry you like this.
I'll win your hand.

125
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,513
I'll fight Rana Pratap. Get killed...

126
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,353
...for your love.

127
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:58,753
Stop this drama.

128
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:04,233
Angry! I knew it.

129
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:08,233
You have no brains.

130
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,753
You can never get what I mean.

131
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,673
I was saying this for you.

132
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:23,147
- Really? Look at you!
- I'll hit you. - Let me see.

133
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:49,945
"The sky beckons to the earth."

134
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:56,688
"Come, Oh my love."

135
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:02,270
"You will have to come!"

136
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:09,433
"Leaving this world..."

137
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:17,432
"...breaking all the relationships..."

138
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:22,743
"You will have to go!"

139
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:29,633
I'll disappear with wind.

140
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,553
- I'll come as a bird.
- Still you cannot reach me.

141
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,873
I'll catch you.

142
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:59,153
"It's string time."

143
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:04,153
"Love blossoms in my heart,
whenever I think about you."

144
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:10,297
"Come home, O' beloved."

145
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,148
"It's string time."

146
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:19,202
"Love blossoms in my heart,
whenever I think about you."

147
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:24,999
"Come home, O' beloved."

148
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:34,648
"Look at lush greenery around."

149
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:40,729
"Look at lush greenery around."

150
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:47,405
"I miss you so much."

151
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:53,499
"I miss you so much."

152
00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:01,324
"Come home, O' beloved."

153
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,121
"It's string time."

154
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:10,053
"Love blossoms in my heart,
whenever I think about you."

155
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,013
"Come home."

156
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:27,852
"I can't rest in peace without you."

157
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:34,028
"I can't rest in peace without you."

158
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,753
"My heart makes me restless."

159
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,028
"My heart makes me restless."

160
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:46,663
"The cool breeze creates
a flutter in my heart."

161
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:50,649
"The cool breeze creates
a flutter in my heart."

162
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,743
"The moment for union has come."

163
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,176
"The moment for union has come."

164
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,919
"Come home, O' beloved."

165
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,811
"It's string time."

166
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:14,811
"Love blossoms in my heart,
whenever I think about you."

167
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,717
"Come home."

168
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:35,073
"Coming to the mountain
from the fields..."

169
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,793
"Coming to the mountain
from the fields..."

170
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:41,866
"...grant me a new life."

171
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:45,833
"Life is a short,
with different experiences."

172
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,758
"Life is a short,
with different experiences."

173
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:57,596
"Come home, O' beloved."

174
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,096
"It's string time."

175
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:05,839
"Love blossoms in my heart,
whenever I think about you."

176
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,974
"Come home."

177
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,153
Are you angry with me?

178
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,081
I thought you had gone on pilgrimage.

179
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:25,068
My pilgrimage is here.
What do I do in Kashi?

180
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,365
Then where were you?

181
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:31,673
Father sent me to town in the morning.
I'm returning now.

182
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,217
You are expert in giving excuses.

183
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:39,433
I'm a fool to come to meet you.

184
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:43,193
A fair is going on.
We have a stall in the center.

185
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:46,793
Come, I'll serve you hot 'jilebis'.

186
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,153
You eat half today and
keep the rest for tomorrow.

187
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:54,960
- I'm not coming to the fair.
- You have to come.

188
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:58,953
I won't come.

189
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:00,568
I will come.

190
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:11,473
Come to the fair.
I'll keep hot jilebis for you.

191
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:16,233
Want to feed me jilebis! I won't go.

192
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:20,418
I won't go. I'll go.

193
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:24,175
Basanti! Come in.

194
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:32,067
You are not dressed up yet.
Everyone has come.

195
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:36,175
- Who all have come?
- Gopi, Sheela and Champa.

196
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,499
- My mother might hear.
- I'll arrange, don't worry.

197
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,958
Where are you going, Manju?

198
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:03,713
You are always naughty.

199
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,953
I too was young once
but never behaved like you.

200
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,229
Aunty..
- Shut up!

201
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,753
She and me...

202
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,877
Mother.

203
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:17,445
Don't butter me up.
No doubt I'm your stepmother.

204
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,953
Yet your mother. Tell me
where are you going dressed up?

205
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:26,175
Why are you being harsh?

206
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:30,073
She is stepdaughter
but a daughter after all.

207
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,418
You never treat her like a mother.

208
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:38,039
You have spoiled
her by your pampering.

209
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:41,729
Look at her make up.

210
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:46,793
You do it yourself even now.

211
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:48,353
You have no control over
yourself even at this age.

212
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:54,273
Want to control her at her age!
Foolish woman!

213
00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:00,473
Father may I go to fair.
My friends are going.

214
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:05,353
Okay. Give her some money.

215
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,953
Oh you have a treasure at home!

216
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:18,851
- Take this 4 paise and
eat what you want. - Give me. Let's go.

217
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,193
Lend me your hand.

218
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:05,353
May I go to see the cattle
brought in the village.

219
00:22:05,664 --> 00:22:10,673
- I'm sure it's a cow.
- May I go. - Okay, go.

220
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,473
She will get angry if I stop you.

221
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:20,366
Put on slippers.
Else you may get hurt.

222
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:28,204
"This journey of life.."

223
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:30,713
"...will always continue."

224
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:33,300
"We won't be there."

225
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:38,542
"This journey of life."

226
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:48,473
"The life is like an ocean,
a drop has no existence."

227
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:54,326
"The life is like an ocean,
a drop has no existence."

228
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:04,825
"The end is inevitable,
we can't deny it."

229
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:11,028
"The end is inevitable,
we can't deny it."

230
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:18,839
"Relax a for sometime."

231
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,231
"This journey of life..."

232
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,960
"...will always continue."

233
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,568
"We won't be there."

234
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:31,513
"This journey of life."

235
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:36,797
"This journey of life."

236
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:46,744
"Things will be the same,
the memories of love will remain."

237
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:52,109
"Things will be the same,
the memories of love will remain."

238
00:23:56,947 --> 00:24:03,150
"There will be changes,
but the world will be the same."

239
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:11,527
"There will be changes,
but the world will be the same."

240
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:17,189
"The problems would be the same."

241
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,595
"This journey of life..."

242
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:22,311
"...will always continue."

243
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:24,838
"We won't be there."

244
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,796
"This journey of life."

245
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:35,553
"This journey of life."

246
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,633
Let's go, Basanti.

247
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:43,526
- Where are you going?
- You come now!

248
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:48,134
I came out with great difficulty
Let me show you around.

249
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:53,066
Don't bother. We will manage.
You look after yourself.

250
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:59,433
Don't be alone.
You might get lost in the fair.

251
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:03,873
Many meet and many
get lost in the fair.

252
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:09,053
- Let's eat 'jilebis'. - I've no money.
I spent what father gave.

253
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,729
I've 50 paise with me.

254
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,673
I'll spend it on you.
I'm so happy to see you here.

255
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:18,202
Oh God!

256
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:23,913
- Let's go. Mohan has 50 paise.
- Don't bother her.

257
00:25:23,994 --> 00:25:27,054
She might get giddy in a giant wheel.

258
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:30,473
- Don't worry. I won't faint.
- You will now.

259
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:37,713
- Listen to Baba's discourses.
- No. I will go with you.

260
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,013
- Okay. God bless you.
- What are you mumbling?

261
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:45,865
I'm blessing you. Come on.

262
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,233
Here comes my father. Save me.

263
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,136
Mohan.

264
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,190
Have you seen my daughter Basanti?

265
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:57,953
- She..
- Oh she is hiding here!

266
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,473
Let's go home.

267
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:47,124
"You are my love,
don't forget these days."

268
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,690
"Youth never comes again."

269
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:56,110
"My heart sings at your tune."

270
00:26:56,191 --> 00:27:01,529
"Tell me some cure,
I don't like anything without you."

271
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:17,164
"You are the sun..."

272
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,408
"You are the sun..."

273
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,935
"...I'm the light."

274
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:27,732
"You are the sun..."

275
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,976
"...I'm the light."

276
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:33,502
"Now we will be together forever."

277
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,557
"Now we will be together forever."

278
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:40,300
"Love is no joke."

279
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:43,948
"Love is no joke."

280
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,679
"This life..."

281
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:59,435
"This life is dear to me."

282
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:05,720
"This life is dear to me."

283
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:09,246
"I will endure all the sorrows."

284
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:12,949
"I will endure all the sorrows."

285
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,793
"I play with fire."

286
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:22,313
"We are in love,
there are blossoms all around."

287
00:28:22,394 --> 00:28:25,673
"The world should not harass us."

288
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:32,840
"You are my love,
don't forget these days."

289
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:36,421
"Youth never comes again."

290
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,692
"You are mine."

291
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:57,556
"You are mine, I am yours."

292
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:03,921
"You are mine."

293
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:07,299
"Beloved, we are made for each other."

294
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:10,867
"Beloved, we are made for each other."

295
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:14,381
"I chant your name all the time."

296
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,962
"I chant your name all the time."

297
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,934
"I am yours."

298
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:31,380
"I am yours."

299
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:33,691
"You are mine."

300
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:39,827
"I am yours, you are mine."

301
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:43,394
"We will always be together."

302
00:29:43,475 --> 00:29:47,098
"We will always be together."

303
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:51,219
"We have nothing to do with the world."

304
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:56,139
"This world is cruel,
let's go far away..."

305
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,665
"...where there is no sorrow."

306
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:07,030
"You are my love,
don't forget these days."

307
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:10,584
"Youth never comes again."

308
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:16,044
"My heart sings at your tune."

309
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:21,476
"Tell me some cure,
I don't like anything without you."

310
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:30,873
Father is coming. I'll go.

311
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:34,422
- When will you meet again?
- Tomorrow at the same place.

312
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:43,833
- Mohan! - Uncle!
- Haven't you seen Manju in the fair?

313
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:47,517
- No.
- Who got down from the cart now?

314
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:48,354
Who?

315
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,073
Must be a fox got on
to the cart on the way.

316
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:55,963
Bye, uncle.

317
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:02,747
I have 50 paise.
I'll spend it on you.

318
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,327
Do you know...

319
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:11,113
...how happy I feel when I meet you?

320
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:16,313
Basanti, Mohan has 50 paise.

321
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:22,473
So, she went out
with Mohan last night.

322
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,953
Do you know where your
daughter went last night?

323
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:33,873
To the fair. She took my permission.

324
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:36,247
You just smoke
the pipe all your life.

325
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:39,234
No. She went out with Mohan.

326
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,558
One can live amongst jackals
but not with a stepmother.

327
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:50,473
If not for her,
care for your reputation.

328
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,382
Remember you are her mother.

329
00:31:53,721 --> 00:32:00,153
You never find a fault in her.
Mohan has mesmerized her.

330
00:32:00,478 --> 00:32:04,247
- She even dreams of him.
- What?

331
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:09,598
- You are too much.
- Come and see for yourself.

332
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,953
Let's go.

333
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:20,713
You want to kill me? To get rid of me?

334
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:27,553
She wants to kill me?
Don't talk bad about my mother.

335
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:31,558
I worship her as long as I live.

336
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,993
A cat.

337
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:50,990
A cat.

338
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:53,753
What happened, dear?

339
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,593
It was a dream, father.

340
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:15,935
To hell with you.
May you rot in hell.

341
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:19,124
- Kalva!
- Brother, wait.

342
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:30,124
- Court Marshal. - It's not in my court.
- It's her. - What are you saying?

343
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:34,435
You spoiled my suit.

344
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:36,759
I will court marshal you. Come along.

345
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:38,407
Leave me.
- What?

346
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:39,786
Mohan.
- Who Mohan?

347
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:42,245
- Court Marshal.
- Save me.

348
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:44,273
Left, right, left, right.

349
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:46,113
- Let us take her.
- Who are you?

350
00:33:46,313 --> 00:33:49,164
I'm a soldier.

351
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:52,988
- Let her go.
- No. She spoiled my suit.

352
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:55,339
Let her go.

353
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,313
Kalva, help, help!

354
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:01,988
Uncle... save me...

355
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:07,353
Thank God.

356
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:14,055
Uncle... it's me.

357
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:18,947
Mahku! Didn't you recognize him?
It's Mahku.

358
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:21,798
He studied with you in the school.

359
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:26,041
Thank God,
you saved a fight between us.

360
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:30,405
Fight. A war. Who is that lady?

361
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:36,337
She is Basanti,
daughter of Bajarang the wrestler.

362
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,676
Oh, good!

363
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:40,392
Her garment looks like a parachute.

364
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:44,690
You came after a long time.
Drink water and go home.

365
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:49,838
No need. She poured
the whole pot on my head.

366
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:57,432
- Uncle has a sweetmeat shop too.
- I see. Let's go.

367
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:04,153
Where were you all these years?

368
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,824
I left the school and ran away.

369
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:13,757
Did various jobs but
joined the army subsequently.

370
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,418
It is better to die
than die here starving.

371
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,566
Well done. Are you thrown out of it?

372
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:28,473
I'm not thrown out.
People are sacked after the war ended.

373
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:35,716
I wanted to come here for a picnic.

374
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,702
Picnic. I'll leave now.

375
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,673
Bye, uncle.

376
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:45,188
See you.

377
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:52,472
- What does 'Chirio' mean?
- Must be name of some herb.

378
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:06,233
- Kalva. - Yes?
- She seems to be strong.

379
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:11,203
She struck me hard.

380
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:26,913
- I'm going to meet Choudhary.
- Okay, father.

381
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:30,825
Don't go away after
that girl when I leave.

382
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:34,833
No. I'll be here till you come back.

383
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:05,769
Where are you going out?

384
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:12,634
Where are you going?
Apply oil on my head.

385
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,945
Manju!

386
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:20,986
Manju!

387
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:36,228
You poured kerosene on my head!
Put it on fire too.

388
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:42,282
Let it dry. I'll apply scented oil.

389
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:54,498
Where are you going?
Make some buttermilk for your father.

390
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:06,931
"The sky beckons to the earth."

391
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:15,525
"Come, O my beloved."

392
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:19,728
"You will have to come."

393
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:28,404
"Leaving this world..."

394
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:36,175
"...breaking all the relationships..."

395
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,673
"...we have to go."

396
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,865
- Where were you for so long?
- What do I say?

397
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,986
Mother is very unkind.

398
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:10,473
She is an obstacle
when it's time to meet.

399
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:16,033
No one can stop the river
from meeting the ocean.

400
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:21,113
Where are you saying
this dialogue from?

401
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:25,473
- From a book.
- What is it's name?

402
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:28,753
Heart.

403
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:38,073
That's a dangerous book!
One can fall sick by reading it.

404
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:44,073
For those who have support
of beloved won't be affected.

405
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:47,753
Who is that beloved?

406
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:52,273
- I won't tell.
- You talk of disease but won't tell me?

407
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,513
- Which disease?
- I won't tell.

408
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:56,675
Please tell me.

409
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,190
Look at the bird
flying in the distance.

410
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:08,113
- Know where it's going?
- Who knows?

411
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:14,793
I have wings like that bird.

412
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:20,793
Feel like flying,
to a distant place...

413
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:25,793
...where no one can reach me.

414
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:28,553
But our foundation lies on the ground.

415
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:32,793
Respecting family values,
parents' honour, village etc.

416
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:36,833
Those leave all this
behind cannot reach the sky.

417
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:42,093
You are at it again?
You better visit a doctor.

418
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,433
No doctor can cure me.
Only you can do it.

419
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:51,782
I see! Come to my house.
My concoction will cure you quickly.

420
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:57,229
- Hold my hand once...
- It's getting dark.

421
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:01,593
- I'll leave now.
- When will you meet me again?

422
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:07,593
Tomorrow is Dasera festival.
I'll come. You come too.

423
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:14,471
Well done!

424
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:22,301
Wait.

425
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:30,833
You are too strong.
You made my joints go loose. Stupid!

426
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:37,953
I'm a villager remember?
You are from army isn't it?

427
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:45,364
I think after I left,
Mohan became a hero in this village.

428
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:48,594
Having affair with Basanti.

429
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:54,513
No. It's with Manju.

430
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:59,322
Basanti is a close friend of Manju.

431
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:04,309
You cannot flirt with
girls in this village.

432
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:10,079
Shut up and bring water.
Let's have both and go out.

433
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,362
- I won't.
- Why?

434
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:16,073
You get things done
for free like police.

435
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:22,187
Make me do so many things
but won't even show me photographs.

436
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:26,033
I brought many things for you.
They are coming by goods train.

437
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:30,983
- Really!
- Yes. Arrange for bath. Get up.

438
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:39,728
- What are you doing?
- Applying soap.

439
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:45,916
Jaggu's mother said your
clothes stink like a rotten goat.

440
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:49,713
Shut up! Pour water, fast.

441
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:53,456
Hurry up!
- Ok.

442
00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:56,672
Here.

443
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:02,821
You had bath and dressed up too.
Now, show me those photographs.

444
00:43:02,902 --> 00:43:10,673
Yes. Tell me,
will my angel come to the fair?

445
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:15,353
Hope the pains I took in bathing etc.
Won't go waste.

446
00:43:15,474 --> 00:43:19,484
- Which angel?
- Basanti.

447
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:23,903
That one. I'll bring
her if she doesn't turn up.

448
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:28,970
Atleast now show me those photographs.

449
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,105
- I'll show you. Be ready.
- I'm.

450
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:41,159
I'm taking it out.
Sit down comfortably.

451
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,713
- This is the angel.
- Where are the wings?

452
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,073
They fly higher than real
angels even without wings.

453
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:55,687
But do we stand a chance?

454
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,833
As it is I'm quite presentable today.

455
00:43:57,914 --> 00:44:01,713
One has to woo them in English.

456
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:04,065
English? What's it in English?

457
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:11,267
You don't know. I know.
Say 'I love you', they are yours.

458
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:16,712
- What to say if you love deeply?
- Say 'I love you so much'.

459
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:23,456
What? - So much means
I love you very much.

460
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:26,375
I'm bewitched by you.

461
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:37,658
- What a hit.
- Be happy that you are alive.

462
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:39,903
She is dangerous.

463
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:44,876
In Europe men say one
thing at times like this.

464
00:44:44,957 --> 00:44:48,233
- What is that?
- 'Sorry'.

465
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:53,113
- Saree. When do they say 'dhoti'.
- In a more difficult situation.

466
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,473
Fair will get over.

467
00:44:56,268 --> 00:44:59,268
Let's go.

468
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:14,153
Stand up straight, you fool.

469
00:48:56,997 --> 00:49:00,779
Boss, dance got over.

470
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,820
Whenever I see my beloved...

471
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:09,794
...my heart beats like
shunting of railway engine.

472
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,145
- Look at the girls.
- Where?

473
00:49:14,226 --> 00:49:16,415
You'll have to muster
courage today and do something.

474
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:24,777
- I'm waiting here to catch her
when she passes this way. - Okay.

475
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,399
Let go off my hand.
You cannot tease me on the road.

476
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,601
Mohan! Mohan!
- What are you doing?

477
00:49:38,264 --> 00:49:42,088
- Kalva, save me.
- Say sorry.

478
00:49:42,169 --> 00:49:44,736
Say something,
atleast you'll be spared.

479
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:49,155
Enough. Let me breath.
What happened?

480
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:57,393
Girls are honour of the village.

481
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:00,513
I'll not spare you
if you tease them again.

482
00:50:04,683 --> 00:50:06,020
You may go.

483
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:08,924
Sister!

484
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:12,991
Sister!

485
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:17,640
Sister!

486
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:22,897
- Mahku!
- I'm leaving the village.

487
00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:26,923
I came to seek your blessings.
They might be useful.

488
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:30,490
What's the matter?
Why are you leaving the village?

489
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:36,989
A daughter is a daughter
for entire village.

490
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,098
I just can't bear this any longer.

491
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:41,513
Why don't you speak straight.

492
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:43,735
If I speak straight,
I'll get trashed.

493
00:50:43,816 --> 00:50:46,993
All I say is control your daughter.

494
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:53,071
Mohan is a rogue.
I saw him playing polo with Basanti.

495
00:50:53,152 --> 00:50:59,043
Romancing with blacksmith's daughter.

496
00:50:59,394 --> 00:51:04,369
And with your daughter...
Oh I cannot tell you.

497
00:51:04,878 --> 00:51:11,017
- Why not? - You are in danger.

498
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:15,793
I don't understand your
language but I know what you mean.

499
00:51:15,914 --> 00:51:17,903
I'll take care of Manju.

500
00:51:19,385 --> 00:51:21,741
Do something about me too.

501
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:23,708
I'm hurt.

502
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:29,513
Basanti is too cruel.
Doesn't even look at me.

503
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,393
Okay. But what is the
need to leave the village?

504
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:37,390
I'll take care no one
says anything about you.

505
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:42,245
Very good. O my sister, you
should have been colonel in the army.

506
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:44,833
Don't let Manju go to him.

507
00:51:46,077 --> 00:51:47,315
I have to leave.

508
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:52,790
- Sit down.
- No. I've to go.

509
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:54,796
Sit down.

510
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:59,433
- I've to go. Bye.
- Okay, go.

511
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:19,513
A small pebble can
disturb a calm lake.

512
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:24,281
I hope Mahku won't create
trouble in our lives.

513
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,433
They are part of the life.

514
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:36,153
Life without sorrow
is no less than death.

515
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,073
Why don't you think of future?

516
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:44,713
I just hope that things
don't go against us.

517
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:50,593
Don't worry.
They might be helpful too.

518
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:54,313
We have crossed
childhood entered youth.

519
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:57,301
No one can understand
the hidden love in the heart.

520
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:03,309
Just the two of us
can understand this.

521
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:07,957
One more person knows about it.
That's God.

522
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:11,655
- One more person too. Me.
- Mahku.

523
00:53:12,705 --> 00:53:15,558
Yes, my name Manku.

524
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:19,833
Go away from here.

525
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:22,401
I'll go.

526
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:29,060
But listen. Yesterday you told
me village girls are it's honour.

527
00:53:29,394 --> 00:53:32,725
And you are going to ruin it?

528
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:37,039
It's not your mistake
but your youth's.

529
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:40,704
Let me also be a partner
if you don't mind.

530
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:53,255
You hit me. It's physical.
I'll assault you emotionally.

531
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,547
Let's go.

532
00:54:02,143 --> 00:54:05,301
- Father...
- Come here? - Yes.

533
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,612
Coming.

534
00:54:11,554 --> 00:54:15,353
- Eat food. Where did you go?
- Out.

535
00:54:15,434 --> 00:54:19,881
Attended Satyanarayana puja.

536
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:24,713
I see. And here I was
busy preparing the food...

537
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:27,079
You eat your food,
I'll get the prasad.

538
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,433
Don't go.
You cannot take the mountain route.

539
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,700
If you get hurt, you'll have
to keep your shop closed for 2 days.

540
00:54:33,263 --> 00:54:38,433
You are right.
I cannot do household chores anymore.

541
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:43,890
I want to get you married.
She's a nice girl.

542
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:48,673
She's pretty too.

543
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,241
What if she is a washerman's daughter?

544
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:58,257
What's your opinion about
teacher's daughter Manju?

545
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:04,884
- But heard that she is naughty.
- No. She's a docile girl.

546
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:10,753
O yes. She goes to the fair with you.

547
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:12,515
Come on, father.

548
00:55:12,596 --> 00:55:16,473
No need to blush.
I'll talk today itself.

549
00:55:16,786 --> 00:55:19,225
Teacher will surely
approve this alliance.

550
00:55:19,306 --> 00:55:22,793
I don't approve this alliance.
She's your daughter.

551
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:26,833
You can give her anywhere.
But I'll be blamed.

552
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:32,513
We won't get a better boy.
They grew up together.

553
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:38,073
Mustn't break up their love.
I've promised to his father.

554
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:40,970
I never broke my promise till date.

555
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:44,134
I don't like that boy.

556
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:48,753
It is Manju's marriage not ours.

557
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:51,111
You are just blabbering.

558
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:55,868
They will be married. With Mohan.
It's my final decision.

559
00:55:57,295 --> 00:55:58,029
Idiot!

560
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:08,182
"Only the lantern is burning."

561
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:12,063
Will you do some work or only singing?

562
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:14,957
Look after work. You've to go to town.

563
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:18,508
I went yesterday.
Please you go.

564
00:56:19,925 --> 00:56:21,313
I've a stomach ache.

565
00:56:21,763 --> 00:56:24,519
I can go but...

566
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:29,837
I don't know her choice in jewels.

567
00:56:31,373 --> 00:56:33,305
Jewels! What's the matter?

568
00:56:34,108 --> 00:56:40,313
- What's it, father?
- Today is Monday.

569
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:45,924
Six more days are
left for the wedding.

570
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:49,033
We have to buy gold.

571
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:53,220
Teacher will be pleased
about the alliance.

572
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:58,734
- Shall I get the cart ready?
- No. You have a stomachache.

573
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:02,033
- I'll go.
- Father.

574
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:08,233
You have to close the shop
if you over tire yourself. I'll go.

575
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:14,474
I know you care about me.
Leave in the evening.

576
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:20,516
- Will you press my legs?
- I'll.

577
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:05,113
"The sky beckons the earth."

578
00:58:05,923 --> 00:58:14,581
"Come to me, my beloved."

579
00:58:15,436 --> 00:58:19,713
"You'll have to come."

580
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:33,122
"Bid adieu to this world."

581
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:42,776
"Liberate yourself
from all the false bonds."

582
00:58:42,857 --> 00:58:46,690
"We'll have to leave this place."

583
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:59,753
- Why are you angry?
- It's my wish.

584
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:03,353
It cannot be without my permission.

585
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:07,473
- Got it? Better forget it else...
- What will happen?

586
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:11,513
I'll have to handcuff
you today it self.

587
00:59:11,723 --> 00:59:15,913
- Handcuffs!?
- I won't tell you.

588
00:59:17,765 --> 00:59:22,753
- But what's the reason?
- Now it's my wish.

589
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:28,233
Don't tell me.
I came to tell you something.

590
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:32,393
You will be overjoyed to hear it.

591
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:40,073
- What is it?
- First tell me who will handcuff me.

592
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:45,645
- Me. - You.
- Yes. Today is Monday.

593
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:51,113
Only six more days are left.

594
00:59:51,194 --> 00:59:55,833
Then I'll handcuff you

595
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:03,233
I came to tell you the same.

596
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,959
I'm going to city to buy gold.
Cart is ready.

597
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:16,593
- What will you bring?
- Whatever you say.

598
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:20,305
Bring me gold which
I can wear forever.

599
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,953
- That is love.
- I already have it.

600
01:00:25,982 --> 01:00:30,099
Doors to our lives opened for us.

601
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:34,305
Let's open the doors
of our toy houses too.

602
01:00:48,198 --> 01:00:52,473
I'll take care of the girl
you take care of the boy from today.

603
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,899
Consider we are holding
each others lives in their form.

604
01:00:57,592 --> 01:01:02,993
I feel as if you are going abroad.

605
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:07,913
Why? - Our village is our
country everything else is abroad.

606
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:10,913
I have to go. Else I'll
be delayed in return journey.

607
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:35,202
"O beloved,
tell me when will you return?"

608
01:01:35,283 --> 01:01:44,921
"O beloved,
tell me when will you return?"

609
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:54,997
"O beloved,
tell me when will you return?"

610
01:01:55,078 --> 01:02:04,564
"O beloved,
tell me when will you return?"

611
01:02:16,457 --> 01:02:21,977
"The dark clouds will bring along..."

612
01:02:22,058 --> 01:02:27,559
"...the message of monsoon."

613
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:34,928
"Then your memories will torment me."

614
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:38,808
"When you don't find me beside you."

615
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:42,233
"Tears will well up in your eyes."

616
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:51,894
"Tell me my love, when will you come."

617
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:08,701
"Whenever the cuckoo
sings melodiously."

618
01:03:08,782 --> 01:03:14,046
"My heart flutters with joy."

619
01:03:16,144 --> 01:03:21,289
"Your beloved will
cry in your absence."

620
01:03:21,582 --> 01:03:25,041
"If you ever hurt me..."

621
01:03:25,247 --> 01:03:28,966
"...you'll surely regret it."

622
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:38,144
"O beloved,
tell me when will you return?"

623
01:03:49,399 --> 01:03:54,907
"As the cool breeze blows..."

624
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:00,306
"...all the blossoms dance with joy."

625
01:04:02,286 --> 01:04:07,686
"The young will be ebullient."

626
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:11,204
"My eyes will search for you."

627
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:15,161
"And your memories will torment me."

628
01:04:15,242 --> 01:04:24,674
"O beloved,
tell me when will you return?"

629
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:32,473
You keep on moaning.

630
01:04:33,064 --> 01:04:37,707
You don't tell me anything.
How are you feeling now?

631
01:04:37,788 --> 01:04:39,713
Why not eat some dry ginger?

632
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:44,273
It won't help. I'm sweating,

633
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:47,922
In great pain.

634
01:04:48,003 --> 01:04:53,153
- What happened to you?
- I'm in love with Basanti.

635
01:04:53,452 --> 01:04:58,713
- Only she can cure me.
- No use of chanting her name.

636
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,543
You have to spend money.

637
01:05:00,912 --> 01:05:05,739
Spend money.
Go with sweets. Your job will be done.

638
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:10,792
- I can but her father...
- The wrestler?

639
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:16,273
Yes. The way he glares at me...

640
01:05:16,354 --> 01:05:19,393
...I feel I'm facing German tankers.

641
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:23,193
He is not at home today.

642
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:31,354
- She is alone at home today
- No. - I swear.

643
01:05:31,435 --> 01:05:35,857
- Is she really alone?
- Absolutely.

644
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:39,245
God is great. Shall we go?

645
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:41,386
Okay.
- Let's go.

646
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,986
Home sweet home.

647
01:05:46,554 --> 01:05:49,689
Wake her up.

648
01:05:52,771 --> 01:05:56,803
- Who is it?
- It's her father.

649
01:05:57,356 --> 01:06:01,210
- Find out what's the matter.
- Come inside. - Let's go.

650
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:06,977
Where did you get me trapped? Idiot,
come along. - Wrestler is calling.

651
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:16,473
- Who are you?
- We are your children.

652
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:18,833
- How did you barge in?
- Get up.

653
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:24,609
We wish to become your students.

654
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:26,522
We've brought sweets for you too.

655
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:34,832
- Look at his body.
- I know. Careful.

656
01:06:34,913 --> 01:06:37,833
No one can compete with him.

657
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,305
We are nowhere compared to you.

658
01:06:42,234 --> 01:06:47,313
- Get ready.
- I'll begin from tomorrow.

659
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:48,313
I've stomachache.

660
01:06:48,716 --> 01:06:52,986
Wear loin cloth and start exercise.
You will be cured.

661
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,965
Pick it up!

662
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,909
- Oh God.
- 202..

663
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,061
- Oh brother..
- Kalva.

664
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:03,633
- I'm dead.
- 203..

665
01:07:04,748 --> 01:07:07,100
- What happened?
- 204..

666
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:08,639
Enough of it.

667
01:07:09,073 --> 01:07:11,699
205..

668
01:07:33,409 --> 01:07:36,046
Your stars today are bad.

669
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:43,593
- What has he done to us?
- God, reach us home.

670
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:04,593
This is your house
now you have to live here.

671
01:08:06,737 --> 01:08:09,557
Which jewellery will
village girls like?

672
01:08:09,638 --> 01:08:18,273
Bangles,
waistband, ear rings, and Tika.

673
01:08:19,277 --> 01:08:24,097
Then pack them.
They have to meet her approval.

674
01:08:24,444 --> 01:08:26,962
You can bring it back
if she doesn't like them.

675
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,392
Don't go there. You will fall.

676
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:14,433
A storm is going to hit.
Remove the blind.

677
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,073
Let's go home, fast.

678
01:10:22,099 --> 01:10:25,353
- Found his name and address?
- No.

679
01:10:30,488 --> 01:10:32,753
- Uncle.
- Yes, dear.

680
01:10:34,574 --> 01:10:37,741
Any news about Mohan?

681
01:10:38,099 --> 01:10:41,793
Don't know where he is gone.

682
01:10:41,914 --> 01:10:48,000
Where can he go?
I told you he is a rogue.

683
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:54,673
He kept a woman in the town.
She must have taken him away.

684
01:10:54,974 --> 01:10:58,811
- A woman.
- Don't underestimate today's women.

685
01:10:59,309 --> 01:11:03,309
They know to seduce men. Thank god.
Wedding didn't take place yet.

686
01:11:03,785 --> 01:11:07,439
Mohan said he will
poison the old lady first.

687
01:11:09,148 --> 01:11:10,223
Sorry.

688
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:12,713
What are you saying?
He will poison me!

689
01:11:12,953 --> 01:11:18,023
Daughter's life is
our first priority now.

690
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:22,193
I can handle it.
I know a contractor from war times.

691
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:24,909
He is a rich man.

692
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,153
But wedding is fixed with Mohan.

693
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,477
What will the villagers
and the village rules say?

694
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:38,043
You call them for a meeting.
I'll clear all problems.

695
01:11:38,124 --> 01:11:41,546
- Wife...
- Bye, sister.

696
01:11:46,941 --> 01:11:50,473
Look at the stain.

697
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:55,221
Think of the stain you are
going to get on your reputation.

698
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:58,153
You said Mohan is the best boy.

699
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:01,037
That sinner ran away
with some other girl.

700
01:12:01,341 --> 01:12:03,869
- What?
- What is there to say?

701
01:12:25,234 --> 01:12:27,113
Don't cry.

702
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:32,153
What is happening? Why?

703
01:12:32,737 --> 01:12:37,953
It's all Mahku's mischief.
He ruined your life.

704
01:12:38,413 --> 01:12:43,255
I cannot even wait for him.

705
01:12:44,748 --> 01:12:48,531
Convey my regards to him if he comes.

706
01:12:48,921 --> 01:12:53,993
Stop crying else it
will create suspicion.

707
01:12:54,218 --> 01:12:57,883
I'm paying for the past with my tears.

708
01:12:58,868 --> 01:13:02,953
This is the only way
to pay for that happiness.

709
01:13:06,619 --> 01:13:11,113
- Stop crying.
- Let me cry, Basanti.

710
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:16,575
Girls grow up in this country to cry.

711
01:13:19,334 --> 01:13:24,976
I didn't know your son will ruin me.

712
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:32,353
My Mohan isn't a bad boy.
Give me little more time.

713
01:13:32,566 --> 01:13:35,633
How can I get you time?

714
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:39,033
Village court will decide for us now.

715
01:13:39,154 --> 01:13:43,073
You will go to court with
a family matter! Aren't you ashamed?

716
01:13:43,518 --> 01:13:47,793
I've to save my name
and my daughter's life.

717
01:13:48,783 --> 01:13:51,713
I'm a father of a daughter.

718
01:13:52,264 --> 01:13:56,753
Won't you care for our
friendship since childhood?

719
01:13:57,324 --> 01:14:01,033
I'm helpless, Choudhary.

720
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:04,815
My duty as a father compels me to...

721
01:14:05,595 --> 01:14:08,193
...call for the village
panchayat. (court).

722
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:13,757
- I have to call for a meeting.
- Oh no, teacher.

723
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:20,222
Listen to the decision
about our teacher's case.

724
01:14:20,407 --> 01:14:24,860
Our Mahku will announce it.

725
01:14:25,234 --> 01:14:29,753
Explain the matter and
clear the misunderstandings.

726
01:14:30,418 --> 01:14:35,303
Get up. It's the matter
of village's honour.

727
01:14:36,212 --> 01:14:38,153
Be careful!

728
01:14:40,763 --> 01:14:42,673
Hope you are not hurt.

729
01:14:47,303 --> 01:14:49,800
Ladies and gentleman.

730
01:14:50,212 --> 01:14:53,941
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H..

731
01:14:54,201 --> 01:14:57,713
No one cared when I've
been saying this earlier.

732
01:14:57,921 --> 01:14:59,228
E, M, T, R, Y...

733
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:02,201
Choudhary's son Mohan is...

734
01:15:02,385 --> 01:15:07,001
L, P, R,
Q, W, X, Y, Z, L, M, N, P, Q...

735
01:15:07,953 --> 01:15:11,073
He ruined Manju's life.

736
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:15,507
And F, R, Y, N, T, W. Out!

737
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:19,356
He ran away with an other woman.
Now he...

738
01:15:19,574 --> 01:15:21,789
H, O, N, O, R, I, F, A, C...

739
01:15:22,428 --> 01:15:29,541
- Explain what it means.
- He will never come back here.

740
01:15:29,622 --> 01:15:34,719
U, T, C, T, D, B and C, I, G,
I, P, B, M, T, B, M, W.

741
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:42,351
Now, how do we deal with this rogue.

742
01:15:42,432 --> 01:15:44,092
That's what I mean. But..

743
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:51,509
He explains so well in English!

744
01:15:51,802 --> 01:15:55,287
- Like a mother feeds a child.
- Wow.

745
01:15:55,368 --> 01:15:58,393
- Silence. Shut your mouth.
- It means, silence.

746
01:15:58,474 --> 01:16:01,357
Don't you hear, brother is
telling you in English to stay quiet?

747
01:16:01,888 --> 01:16:04,244
Waiting for Mohan is...

748
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:08,915
...ruining Manju's life.

749
01:16:08,996 --> 01:16:09,745
Means

750
01:16:11,445 --> 01:16:14,515
L, A, X, Y, M, I, M, A, H, R, O, D..

751
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:17,099
We have to find another groom, fast.

752
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:21,873
Else, we will repent it for life.

753
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:26,428
Okay. Let's find a groom for the girl.

754
01:16:26,509 --> 01:16:29,597
Thank you. Thank you.

755
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:35,513
What can be done in
such a short time left.

756
01:16:35,813 --> 01:16:39,084
Wedding time has approached.

757
01:16:39,165 --> 01:16:45,250
Wedding will take place at
the same time with a different groom.

758
01:16:45,331 --> 01:16:50,193
Mahku is a learned man.
What he says is right.

759
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:54,970
You do something.
I'm totally confused.

760
01:16:55,051 --> 01:16:59,633
To go and come 8 coins
and for the groom 21 coins.

761
01:16:59,714 --> 01:17:00,652
How much is it?

762
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:08,008
It's 29. - 29 is not a good number.
Round it off to 30. It's done.

763
01:17:15,317 --> 01:17:17,913
What decision have you taken?

764
01:17:18,658 --> 01:17:22,273
It will ruin my son's life.

765
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:25,593
It will ruin his life.

766
01:17:25,714 --> 01:17:30,593
If you don't care for Mohan.
Atleast care for his father's tears.

767
01:17:30,863 --> 01:17:33,993
I beg of you don't ruin my son's life.

768
01:17:34,236 --> 01:17:36,953
Don't ruin his life.

769
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:40,441
Don't ruin his life.

770
01:17:43,555 --> 01:17:51,878
"The miseries of the unfortunate."

771
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:56,267
"Who listens to the..."

772
01:17:56,625 --> 01:18:03,295
"...the laments of the miserable."

773
01:18:03,469 --> 01:18:07,511
"Who listens to the..."

774
01:18:07,977 --> 01:18:12,953
"Whom will I tell the
miseries of my heart?"

775
01:18:13,034 --> 01:18:17,824
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

776
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:25,068
"Whom should I tell my plight to?"

777
01:18:25,149 --> 01:18:29,825
"Whom should I tell my plight to?"

778
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:32,862
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

779
01:18:44,613 --> 01:18:53,888
"May god be with you,
O, the one who is tormenting me."

780
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:59,099
"May god be with you,
O, the one who is tormenting me."

781
01:19:01,467 --> 01:19:06,039
"I pray for your well being."

782
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:10,634
"I pray for your well being."

783
01:19:10,715 --> 01:19:15,368
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

784
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:18,622
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

785
01:19:32,137 --> 01:19:36,796
"Destiny mocks at me...
so says the world."

786
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:41,379
"Destiny mocks at me..."

787
01:19:41,575 --> 01:19:46,276
"Destiny mocks at me...
so says the world."

788
01:19:48,558 --> 01:19:52,957
"The lovers couldn't meet."

789
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:57,552
"The lovers couldn't meet."

790
01:19:57,633 --> 01:20:02,180
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

791
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:05,942
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

792
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:23,379
"O my love, please come soon."

793
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:29,887
"O my love, please come soon."

794
01:20:32,277 --> 01:20:36,698
"Don't let these moments
pass just like that."

795
01:20:36,872 --> 01:20:41,120
"Don't let these moments
pass just like that."

796
01:20:41,201 --> 01:20:46,287
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

797
01:20:48,138 --> 01:20:52,525
"Whom should I tell my plight to?"

798
01:20:52,606 --> 01:20:55,984
"Whom will tell my sorrows?"

799
01:21:00,991 --> 01:21:02,017
Wait!

800
01:21:02,721 --> 01:21:04,873
Mr contractor...

801
01:21:06,808 --> 01:21:08,623
...contractor...

802
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:10,297
...are you at home?

803
01:21:10,786 --> 01:21:14,273
Mahku, what brings you here today?

804
01:21:14,505 --> 01:21:17,163
Come in.

805
01:21:18,591 --> 01:21:21,237
- Come Mahku.
- Go.

806
01:21:21,318 --> 01:21:23,118
Aunt, wear this garland.

807
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:27,953
- I came to give you a good news.
- What's it?

808
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:29,680
Come with me.

809
01:21:29,854 --> 01:21:31,129
Okay.

810
01:21:32,795 --> 01:21:35,433
Tell me, what's the good news?

811
01:21:35,514 --> 01:21:39,627
Sister, forget about hardwork at home.

812
01:21:40,006 --> 01:21:43,692
Sit like a queen in this chair.

813
01:21:44,428 --> 01:21:47,292
I've found a bride for the contractor.

814
01:21:47,628 --> 01:21:53,119
I'm on medication for
You look after the arrangements.

815
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:58,993
Then 8 anas for conveyance
21 for the groom.

816
01:21:59,531 --> 01:22:04,353
- How much is it?
- 29 anas. Odd figure is bad.

817
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:08,070
Give me 30 anas and consider
the alliance is fixed.

818
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:12,880
See that the girl is healthy.

819
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:19,583
I've brought a hard working
girl like a machine...

820
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:23,953
Wait. I'll bring money.
- Okay.

821
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:33,506
Keep it back. Stealing is a bad.

822
01:22:43,971 --> 01:22:47,804
You will take everything
or keep something for me too?

823
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:51,353
You can't digest this.
Stand up straight.

824
01:22:54,491 --> 01:22:55,917
Count them.

825
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:57,971
Wait. Give me.

826
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,674
Okay, I'll leave.

827
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:13,313
He has aged but not improved.

828
01:23:13,394 --> 01:23:18,073
He steals wherever he goes.
Take it back.

829
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:20,804
Sister... sister.

830
01:23:21,713 --> 01:23:22,966
You are here.

831
01:23:24,005 --> 01:23:29,113
I found such a groom
that you will be pleased.

832
01:23:29,194 --> 01:23:32,523
I've paid the money I took.

833
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:38,873
Now, get me married
to Basanti if you find time.

834
01:23:38,994 --> 01:23:43,778
- I'll set up your home too.
- I'm giving you trouble.

835
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:46,353
I'll go now, bye.

836
01:23:51,347 --> 01:23:54,989
O my, dear... You are so beautiful...

837
01:23:55,185 --> 01:24:00,153
...why not you ask me
once what am I waiting for.

838
01:24:00,839 --> 01:24:04,914
Father went out today.
I'm alone at home.

839
01:24:04,995 --> 01:24:10,287
May I come home? Can we sit and talk?

840
01:24:11,736 --> 01:24:13,368
You killed this poor man.

841
01:24:15,585 --> 01:24:17,292
Home sweet home.

842
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:23,293
Don't you have a mat to sit?
I'm tired.

843
01:24:23,564 --> 01:24:28,514
Open the door. - Oh God, spare the king.
Your father is it at home!

844
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:33,433
Yes. He is ruthless.
He will kill you if are found here.

845
01:24:33,514 --> 01:24:38,871
He will kill me? Ruthless! Won't
leave me alive? What do I do now?

846
01:24:43,424 --> 01:24:47,801
- Where are you hiding?
- What to do?

847
01:24:48,019 --> 01:24:50,991
Hide in the empty gunny bag of potatoes.
- No! No!

848
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,364
- Gunny bag?
- Yes.

849
01:24:53,575 --> 01:24:54,731
Open the door.

850
01:24:55,532 --> 01:24:59,563
- Where is the bag?
- Here. Hide in it.

851
01:24:59,759 --> 01:25:00,882
I'm hiding.

852
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:03,163
- Fast.
- I'm doing fast.

853
01:25:03,445 --> 01:25:06,115
Home sweet home.

854
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:09,633
Coming, father.

855
01:25:16,839 --> 01:25:19,757
- Load the goods.
- Come on, guys.

856
01:25:23,011 --> 01:25:24,859
Quickly, be careful.

857
01:25:27,346 --> 01:25:29,540
Fast. Pick it up.

858
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:33,953
Quickly.

859
01:25:37,878 --> 01:25:38,839
Fast.

860
01:25:47,467 --> 01:25:49,732
Please! Please, leave me.

861
01:25:49,813 --> 01:25:51,186
Why did you come in, you rascal.

862
01:25:51,267 --> 01:25:53,651
- Help, help. I'll not come now.
- Idiot.

863
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:56,310
- Get lost!
- I will not come from now on.

864
01:25:57,435 --> 01:26:01,780
- How is he?
- He uttered 'father'.

865
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,597
He will survive.

866
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:04,516
Yes, doctor.

867
01:26:24,516 --> 01:26:29,100
"The melody of your flute..."

868
01:26:32,419 --> 01:26:36,548
"...brings back your memories."

869
01:26:38,635 --> 01:26:43,229
"The melody of your flute..."

870
01:26:46,959 --> 01:26:51,347
"...brings back your memories."

871
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:01,959
"Somewhere someone sings..."

872
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:05,530
"...the songs of love."

873
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:10,113
"O beloved,
I spend sleepless nights..."

874
01:27:10,194 --> 01:27:13,393
"...thinking about you."

875
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:18,200
"When the world sleeps peacefully."

876
01:27:22,191 --> 01:27:25,873
"I keep pining for you."

877
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:32,536
"The melody of your flute..."

878
01:27:36,071 --> 01:27:40,265
"...brings back your memories."

879
01:27:46,763 --> 01:27:54,553
"The night wants to impress
the earth with the moon's brilliance."

880
01:27:54,945 --> 01:28:02,111
"I yearn for my beloved."

881
01:28:02,556 --> 01:28:06,620
"O my beloved!"

882
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:15,031
"I just yearn for your love."

883
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:20,987
"The melody of your flute..."

884
01:28:24,685 --> 01:28:29,008
"...brings back your memories."

885
01:28:35,129 --> 01:28:42,966
"All my dreams are shattered."

886
01:28:43,183 --> 01:28:50,458
"Things are no longer the
same since the day he left me."

887
01:28:50,739 --> 01:28:55,042
"The dark clouds of separation."

888
01:28:58,718 --> 01:29:02,912
"There's just obscure
darkness all around."

889
01:29:04,513 --> 01:29:08,825
"The melody of your flute..."

890
01:29:12,578 --> 01:29:16,706
"...brings back your memories."

891
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:19,593
Can you see what is happening,
Basanti?

892
01:29:20,437 --> 01:29:22,908
I cannot wait for him anymore.

893
01:29:22,989 --> 01:29:27,073
Don't cry.
Things will only become worse.

894
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:37,637
- Doctor, which day is it?
- Saturday.

895
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:43,151
O God! Doctor I've to leave.

896
01:29:43,422 --> 01:29:47,692
Where will you go?
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

897
01:29:47,773 --> 01:29:48,487
No, doctor.

898
01:29:48,568 --> 01:29:49,983
You have to stay for few more days.

899
01:29:50,064 --> 01:29:51,793
I cannot stay even for a moment more.

900
01:29:52,074 --> 01:29:56,373
I have to go.
Someone is waiting for me there.

901
01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:00,070
Today is my wedding day. Yes.

902
01:30:00,633 --> 01:30:01,897
Today is my wedding day.

903
01:31:10,437 --> 01:31:14,094
Look what happened, Basanti.

904
01:31:15,202 --> 01:31:20,564
No one can change the fate.

905
01:31:30,964 --> 01:31:34,196
Proceed before the
auspicious time is over.

906
01:32:06,184 --> 01:32:12,020
"Sing songs of union."

907
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:15,609
"I have to go to my beloved's home."

908
01:32:16,572 --> 01:32:21,663
"Sing songs of union."

909
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:25,803
"I have to go to my beloved's home."

910
01:32:28,798 --> 01:32:37,240
"Why do my eyes shed tears."

911
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:41,845
"Without you,
your beloved's home is lifeless."

912
01:32:41,926 --> 01:32:45,293
"O wanderer, let's go home."

913
01:32:45,565 --> 01:32:51,251
"The stars there
are desperate to see me."

914
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:55,153
"I have to go..."

915
01:33:02,657 --> 01:33:08,213
"Sing songs of union."

916
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:12,388
"I have to go to my beloved's home."

917
01:33:15,232 --> 01:33:19,847
"Life may just pass by."

918
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:24,023
"That's what I fear."

919
01:33:24,248 --> 01:33:28,604
"I am alone against the big bad world."

920
01:33:28,685 --> 01:33:31,901
"We may be separated."

921
01:33:32,455 --> 01:33:38,010
"May our good destiny
not change for the bad."

922
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:42,085
"I have to go to my beloved's home."

923
01:33:49,697 --> 01:33:55,091
"Sing songs of union."

924
01:33:55,438 --> 01:33:59,307
"I have to go to my beloved's home."

925
01:34:02,551 --> 01:34:07,166
"My eyes lookout
for my beloved's home."

926
01:34:07,495 --> 01:34:11,058
"They are desperate to see her."

927
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:15,912
"Your beloved calls out to you."

928
01:34:15,993 --> 01:34:19,934
"The one I miss, listen."

929
01:34:20,015 --> 01:34:25,491
"Childhood sweethearts will meet,
their hearts will fill with joy."

930
01:34:25,676 --> 01:34:29,708
"I have to go to my beloved's home."

931
01:34:37,299 --> 01:34:43,190
"Sing songs of union."

932
01:34:43,271 --> 01:34:46,800
"I have to go to my beloved's home."

933
01:34:50,121 --> 01:34:56,877
"The sky calls out to the earth."

934
01:34:57,159 --> 01:35:05,579
"Come to your beloved."

935
01:35:05,861 --> 01:35:10,131
"You will have to come!"

936
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:17,014
Basanti, you! Where is Manju?

937
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:24,392
Why do you need her now.
Go back to where you were hiding...

938
01:35:25,175 --> 01:35:29,419
- ...to your angel.
- Which angel?

939
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:34,534
Which angel?

940
01:35:35,213 --> 01:35:40,207
Who kept you tied up with her.

941
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:47,925
A true lover never looks
at any other girl than his beloved.

942
01:35:48,615 --> 01:35:50,574
I met with an accident in town.

943
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:53,574
I was lying unconscious
for 5 days in the hospital.

944
01:35:54,023 --> 01:35:56,574
I got discharged today.
I come running.

945
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:59,574
You are late.

946
01:36:00,055 --> 01:36:03,524
Villagers have ruined your life.

947
01:36:05,211 --> 01:36:11,772
What happened, Basanti?
Hope Manju is fine.

948
01:36:12,584 --> 01:36:15,545
What is the use of her welfare to you.

949
01:36:16,249 --> 01:36:20,777
She is married now.
Left for husband home today.

950
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:25,599
What happened?

951
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:32,475
Our dreams from childhood
to youth are shattered.

952
01:36:32,941 --> 01:36:34,614
Manju is gone.

953
01:36:36,303 --> 01:36:38,626
Her home is no more here.

954
01:36:39,697 --> 01:36:45,469
Then why is it remaining?
Let me destroy it too.

955
01:36:50,929 --> 01:36:53,254
What do you gain by breaking it?

956
01:36:53,469 --> 01:36:57,296
Break the neck of those
who ruined your dreams.

957
01:36:57,589 --> 01:37:00,906
Mahku did it.

958
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:12,820
Tell me.
- King for two cents.

959
01:37:12,901 --> 01:37:14,377
King will surely come out.

960
01:37:14,458 --> 01:37:16,723
Deal the cards till
the Queen is shown.

961
01:37:20,692 --> 01:37:22,659
- Leave.
- Brother.

962
01:37:23,049 --> 01:37:24,778
Brother Mohan.

963
01:37:38,844 --> 01:37:42,767
I'm happy to see you. Where were you?

964
01:37:42,848 --> 01:37:44,799
I missed you a lot.

965
01:37:45,449 --> 01:37:50,330
Yes. Everyone was sad since you left.

966
01:37:50,627 --> 01:37:53,294
It's lively today again.

967
01:37:53,503 --> 01:37:57,804
We tried our best to stop the wedding.

968
01:37:57,885 --> 01:38:03,566
Master got greedy
and ruined your life.

969
01:38:04,031 --> 01:38:05,555
Control yourself.
- Kalva.

970
01:38:05,826 --> 01:38:07,339
He is scared.

971
01:38:08,775 --> 01:38:11,334
I warned you about it.

972
01:38:12,594 --> 01:38:14,734
Now, it's time for you to die.

973
01:38:19,242 --> 01:38:22,679
Brother.. dagger.
Such a long dagger.

974
01:38:22,907 --> 01:38:24,202
Stop, my dear.

975
01:38:24,283 --> 01:38:26,667
It's not good to use weapons.

976
01:38:30,939 --> 01:38:34,354
Help! Help! Help!

977
01:38:34,853 --> 01:38:37,998
Help! Help!

978
01:38:38,409 --> 01:38:41,046
Spare me.

979
01:38:42,463 --> 01:38:45,598
Please forgive me.

980
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:48,474
You begged for your life.

981
01:38:50,485 --> 01:38:52,971
No one in this village
raises hand on a such a man.

982
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:58,128
Brother Mohan, go away from here.
Why did you come here?

983
01:38:58,302 --> 01:39:02,809
Go, go. Don't harbor
hard feelings. Go.

984
01:39:07,913 --> 01:39:11,774
- Has he gone?
- He has gone.

985
01:39:14,518 --> 01:39:18,030
He came to fight with a soldier!

986
01:39:24,755 --> 01:39:27,576
Mohan, you have come!

987
01:39:30,637 --> 01:39:32,755
Father...

988
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:47,482
Father, what is all this?

989
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:52,171
What is all this?

990
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:57,854
I tried my best to stop.
No one heeded.

991
01:39:58,745 --> 01:40:02,482
You are crying? What's the use?

992
01:40:04,659 --> 01:40:06,485
Let us laugh together...

993
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:12,020
...which can fill this house.

994
01:40:12,454 --> 01:40:18,496
Where can I find such a laugh, father?

995
01:40:18,865 --> 01:40:22,713
One has to be brave.

996
01:40:23,266 --> 01:40:27,894
Else no one endure
the hardships of life.

997
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:32,054
Please, smile once
for your father's sake.

998
01:40:32,747 --> 01:40:33,838
Please.

999
01:40:35,017 --> 01:40:42,972
I'm smiling, for your sake, father.

1000
01:40:48,725 --> 01:40:54,022
I'm happy now. Keep smiling, my son.

1001
01:40:54,629 --> 01:40:59,438
- Keep smiling, my dear.
- Father...

1002
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:04,713
Don't fear. I'm fine.

1003
01:41:05,975 --> 01:41:10,373
Let me hear the song
you used to sing about...

1004
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:16,021
...beloved, life and death.

1005
01:41:16,509 --> 01:41:20,594
Want to hear the song, father?

1006
01:41:23,071 --> 01:41:30,724
"The sky calls out to the earth."

1007
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:38,421
"Come to your beloved."

1008
01:41:40,898 --> 01:41:45,026
"You will have to come."

1009
01:41:46,703 --> 01:41:54,453
"You will have to leave this world."

1010
01:41:54,714 --> 01:42:02,865
"You will have to break
all these illusionary ties."

1011
01:42:04,542 --> 01:42:08,414
"You will have to leave."

1012
01:43:16,792 --> 01:43:19,288
What am I seeing?

1013
01:43:19,668 --> 01:43:23,699
A husband looking at his wife.

1014
01:43:24,068 --> 01:43:25,137
Wife?

1015
01:43:25,535 --> 01:43:31,828
No, no. I never said a young girl...

1016
01:43:32,327 --> 01:43:34,326
...should be my wife.

1017
01:43:34,532 --> 01:43:38,174
No. This is injustice.

1018
01:43:38,694 --> 01:43:43,125
But it is ages old.

1019
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:49,677
My sister has deceived me badly.

1020
01:43:50,262 --> 01:43:52,791
That is immaterial now.

1021
01:43:53,289 --> 01:43:57,871
Society has bound as together...

1022
01:43:58,554 --> 01:44:01,134
...to live together till death.

1023
01:44:01,894 --> 01:44:07,439
Now, neither you nor
your sister can break it.

1024
01:44:07,851 --> 01:44:09,796
I'm innocent.

1025
01:44:10,326 --> 01:44:13,839
I've married for the sake
of my children, not for me.

1026
01:44:14,424 --> 01:44:21,174
God has snatched away
mother's affection from them.

1027
01:44:21,506 --> 01:44:26,132
- Greetings, father.
- Look. - Greetings, mother.

1028
01:44:26,306 --> 01:44:27,656
Greetings, mother.

1029
01:44:27,938 --> 01:44:29,656
Greetings, mother.

1030
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:32,499
These children of the future are...

1031
01:44:33,084 --> 01:44:40,196
...turning rogues without
affection and guidance.

1032
01:44:40,543 --> 01:44:45,504
Be their mother.

1033
01:44:45,786 --> 01:44:52,304
Be their mother.
Accept them as your children.

1034
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:55,214
This is my last wish.

1035
01:44:56,706 --> 01:44:59,214
Be their mother. Come on.

1036
01:45:09,442 --> 01:45:12,254
Mother, he got heart attack again.

1037
01:45:12,934 --> 01:45:16,614
Open your eyes.

1038
01:45:18,426 --> 01:45:21,581
I have to see the
world through them now.

1039
01:45:21,755 --> 01:45:25,895
By taking my head on your lap...

1040
01:45:26,782 --> 01:45:31,019
...you have taken these
children into your protection.

1041
01:45:31,637 --> 01:45:35,095
Don't desert them.
They are the children of the nation.

1042
01:45:35,695 --> 01:45:38,608
I hand them over to you.

1043
01:45:39,355 --> 01:45:40,614
O God!

1044
01:45:40,695 --> 01:45:45,754
I know too are too young.
Yet, have motherly affection.

1045
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:50,576
Where do I get such affection?

1046
01:45:50,923 --> 01:45:53,841
I'll do anything to obtain it.

1047
01:45:54,145 --> 01:46:00,673
It cannot be bought. It's priceless.

1048
01:46:00,847 --> 01:46:07,744
If it is not bought,
or got even by begging...

1049
01:46:07,825 --> 01:46:12,133
...tell me where do I get it from?

1050
01:46:12,393 --> 01:46:15,694
Only your parents can answer it.

1051
01:46:15,993 --> 01:46:20,100
I can't answer, but can only request
you on behalf of all women.

1052
01:46:21,344 --> 01:46:23,614
On behalf of...

1053
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:27,334
...the thing that you like
the most in the world.

1054
01:46:28,631 --> 01:46:32,544
Accept them.

1055
01:46:33,907 --> 01:46:35,734
This is my only wish.

1056
01:46:35,815 --> 01:46:40,544
You came as my wife,
fulfill your duty of a wife.

1057
01:46:41,756 --> 01:46:47,570
These children are yours. Accept them.

1058
01:46:48,955 --> 01:46:50,641
Accept them.

1059
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:54,370
You have to become their mother.

1060
01:47:42,686 --> 01:47:44,814
How nice you are, mother.

1061
01:47:51,658 --> 01:47:56,889
This is how the children get spoiled.
No value for my words.

1062
01:47:58,523 --> 01:48:03,441
Children need affection.
Can be molded with affection.

1063
01:48:03,841 --> 01:48:09,094
Epitome of love. If they do such
things now, what will they do in future?

1064
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:13,235
You're very lenient to them.
All of them are spoiled.

1065
01:48:14,457 --> 01:48:16,814
If this is spoiling...

1066
01:48:17,386 --> 01:48:21,277
...I wish all the children
of the nation are spoiled.

1067
01:48:21,548 --> 01:48:24,618
You have become henpecked.

1068
01:48:28,068 --> 01:48:32,283
What you have done
for me and my children...

1069
01:48:33,014 --> 01:48:35,482
...isn't done by even angels.

1070
01:48:36,521 --> 01:48:38,045
Don't say so.

1071
01:48:39,592 --> 01:48:44,553
You are my life according to society.

1072
01:48:47,602 --> 01:48:49,721
Your father has taken...

1073
01:48:49,802 --> 01:48:55,234
...loan of 800 rupees
for your wedding.

1074
01:48:56,165 --> 01:48:57,894
Here is the receipt.

1075
01:48:58,251 --> 01:49:00,894
No need of receipt.

1076
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:06,024
Give me 2 days time.
You will get your money.

1077
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:23,893
I'm going to doctor.

1078
01:49:24,078 --> 01:49:29,934
Sure. I get upset when
you get heart attack.

1079
01:49:32,651 --> 01:49:36,575
Father, we want to come.

1080
01:49:37,819 --> 01:49:40,759
I'm going to doctor.

1081
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:45,895
Take them too.
Chunu coughs the whole night.

1082
01:49:46,675 --> 01:49:50,306
And he has stomach ache.
Show them to doctor.

1083
01:49:54,632 --> 01:49:55,842
Come.

1084
01:50:03,226 --> 01:50:07,096
- Sir, take back these ornaments.
- Why, didn't the bride like them?

1085
01:50:09,821 --> 01:50:14,374
Ornaments are good.
But, I'm not approved.

1086
01:50:18,416 --> 01:50:20,069
Do you still play with dolls?

1087
01:50:25,454 --> 01:50:30,826
Play got over. Dolls remained.

1088
01:51:28,318 --> 01:51:31,019
I take your leave now.

1089
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:32,680
Bye.

1090
01:51:32,761 --> 01:51:35,388
Please come in.

1091
01:51:42,253 --> 01:51:43,494
I'll go now.

1092
01:51:45,117 --> 01:51:48,054
You have saved a woman
from becoming a widow.

1093
01:51:48,135 --> 01:51:52,155
I won't leave you without a treat.
Sit down.

1094
01:51:54,664 --> 01:51:58,263
I'll go. I've to go far.

1095
01:51:58,344 --> 01:52:01,614
You are God in human form.

1096
01:52:02,231 --> 01:52:06,998
Have a glass of milk
atleast for my sake. Sit down.

1097
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:08,880
I'll be back.

1098
01:52:15,032 --> 01:52:16,173
Devi.

1099
01:52:18,978 --> 01:52:21,134
- Devi.
- You are back!

1100
01:52:22,178 --> 01:52:26,620
- I was afraid for you.
- God came as...

1101
01:52:27,053 --> 01:52:28,574
...a man and saved me today.

1102
01:52:28,967 --> 01:52:33,269
Else, you would have been a
widow by now. I had an attack again.

1103
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:38,263
He is God for me too. Where is he?

1104
01:52:38,615 --> 01:52:42,869
Bring a glass of milk fast.
God doesn't stay in one place.

1105
01:52:43,345 --> 01:52:45,574
I'll come with milk.

1106
01:53:18,785 --> 01:53:22,686
- Take.
- Take it back. God has left.

1107
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:37,086
Mother! - Hey!
- I will not give the doll.

1108
01:53:37,303 --> 01:53:42,480
Why are you making noise?
What's this in your hand?

1109
01:53:45,935 --> 01:53:51,400
- Idol? Where did you get it?
- We found it in the guest's bag.

1110
01:53:53,498 --> 01:53:54,502
How does he look like?

1111
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,805
Nice man. Brought us home in his cart.

1112
01:54:01,695 --> 01:54:06,254
- Was his hair untidy.
- Yes. Untidy.

1113
01:54:08,677 --> 01:54:11,325
It must be him.

1114
01:54:13,542 --> 01:54:16,632
Go and play. Down stairs.

1115
01:54:18,114 --> 01:54:21,659
Go. Go and play. Down stairs.

1116
01:54:27,649 --> 01:54:34,318
"I'm waiting for my beloved."

1117
01:54:35,606 --> 01:54:39,550
"My heart bleeds for him."

1118
01:54:43,897 --> 01:54:50,988
"He is probably
avoiding me and leaving."

1119
01:54:51,335 --> 01:54:56,901
"He is probably avoiding me."

1120
01:54:57,551 --> 01:55:03,615
"He is probably avoiding me."

1121
01:55:03,811 --> 01:55:09,216
"He is probably
avoiding me and leaving."

1122
01:55:10,914 --> 01:55:14,946
"How was I to know..."

1123
01:55:19,639 --> 01:55:22,957
"...my heart would
have to endure even this."

1124
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:33,898
"That he will come,
but leave without meeting me."

1125
01:55:34,224 --> 01:55:39,671
"But leave without meeting me."

1126
01:55:40,288 --> 01:55:45,704
"But leave without meeting me."

1127
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:51,379
"That he will come,
but leave without meeting me."

1128
01:55:53,824 --> 01:55:56,814
"He must be aware..."

1129
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:05,119
"He must be aware..."

1130
01:56:05,531 --> 01:56:10,287
"...of my helplessness."

1131
01:56:12,855 --> 01:56:19,778
"The one who I look at longingly."

1132
01:56:20,298 --> 01:56:25,497
"I look at longingly."

1133
01:56:26,071 --> 01:56:32,070
"I look at longingly."

1134
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:37,291
"The one who I look at longingly."

1135
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:43,302
"I have been distanced from him now."

1136
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:50,632
"I have nothing to do with him now."

1137
01:56:54,611 --> 01:57:01,702
"Someone tell him not to come here."

1138
01:57:01,984 --> 01:57:07,507
"Not to come here."

1139
01:57:08,146 --> 01:57:13,637
"Not to come here."

1140
01:57:14,168 --> 01:57:20,361
"Someone tell him not to come here."

1141
01:57:24,492 --> 01:57:27,420
Mahku! Mahku!

1142
01:57:28,975 --> 01:57:32,534
Get lost...
Don't stop me when going out.

1143
01:57:33,973 --> 01:57:37,894
- What is it?
- You look handsome.

1144
01:57:39,108 --> 01:57:44,339
- Father isn't at home.
- Make fool of a village jerk.

1145
01:57:44,513 --> 01:57:47,604
- I'm not going to be fooled.
- Listen.

1146
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,690
Don't try to hide me
in the gunny bag again.

1147
01:57:49,907 --> 01:57:50,901
Listen.

1148
01:57:59,442 --> 01:58:03,095
- Where did you go?
- To sell the ornaments.

1149
01:58:05,215 --> 01:58:07,974
What do I do with them?
Where Manju is gone?

1150
01:58:08,523 --> 01:58:10,974
You gave up on her memories too.

1151
01:58:12,533 --> 01:58:16,197
I only sold ornaments not Manju.

1152
01:58:18,015 --> 01:58:23,247
Her memories will be
with me always. Always.

1153
01:58:24,707 --> 01:58:26,901
I'll show you.

1154
01:58:32,123 --> 01:58:34,424
- What happened?
- I lost my doll.

1155
01:58:36,468 --> 01:58:38,240
I lost my doll.

1156
01:59:01,982 --> 01:59:06,003
Excuse me. I left behind my doll here.

1157
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:14,154
Be seated. What sort of doll?
I'll find it. Sit down.

1158
01:59:14,588 --> 01:59:18,101
No, I've no time to sit.

1159
01:59:20,286 --> 01:59:22,454
That doll was the
last token of my love.

1160
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:26,454
I'll lose everything if I lose it.

1161
01:59:27,843 --> 01:59:30,965
My life is attached to that doll.

1162
01:59:32,545 --> 01:59:35,054
Please tell me if it's here.

1163
01:59:35,323 --> 01:59:38,544
You look very upset. Let me find out.

1164
02:00:27,442 --> 02:00:32,057
The man who saved my life
that day lost something precious.

1165
02:00:32,426 --> 02:00:34,134
Is that here by any chance?

1166
02:00:34,458 --> 02:00:40,576
Children kept his bag.
Ask him if it's belongs to him.

1167
02:00:57,776 --> 02:01:00,574
- Is this the one?
- Yes.

1168
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:06,774
Thank you very much.
You gave back my lost life.

1169
02:01:07,057 --> 02:01:09,596
Please check. Is it okay?

1170
02:01:26,679 --> 02:01:28,214
This broken doll!

1171
02:01:35,954 --> 02:01:38,148
Toys are made to be broken.

1172
02:01:40,938 --> 02:01:45,867
I'm grateful to madam
for keeping it safe.

1173
02:01:48,928 --> 02:01:53,024
Tell her that the mad
man who plays with dolls...

1174
02:01:54,712 --> 02:01:56,654
...conveyed his greetings.

1175
02:01:58,745 --> 02:02:00,344
Mohan!

1176
02:02:04,377 --> 02:02:05,793
Mohan!

1177
02:02:10,756 --> 02:02:11,847
Mohan!

1178
02:02:13,491 --> 02:02:14,712
Mohan!

1179
02:02:20,843 --> 02:02:26,734
"You, who broke my heart."

1180
02:02:26,962 --> 02:02:32,654
"Accept my best wishes."

1181
02:02:32,897 --> 02:02:38,539
"After having ruined my life."

1182
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:44,294
"Begin your life anew."

1183
02:02:50,271 --> 02:02:55,818
"You have the promise of our love."

1184
02:02:55,899 --> 02:03:01,734
"Erase all your memories of love."

1185
02:03:01,815 --> 02:03:07,480
"Whenever you miss me."

1186
02:03:07,561 --> 02:03:13,413
"Just shed a few tears."

1187
02:03:24,725 --> 02:03:30,603
"I don't know..."

1188
02:03:30,793 --> 02:03:35,563
"...how to shun my loyalty."

1189
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:39,157
"I don't know..."

1190
02:03:39,361 --> 02:03:45,049
"...how to shun my loyalty."

1191
02:03:45,130 --> 02:03:50,398
"...how to shun my loyalty."

1192
02:03:50,968 --> 02:03:56,658
"I have loved only you."

1193
02:03:56,739 --> 02:04:02,305
"You can test me any time."

1194
02:04:02,562 --> 02:04:08,088
"You, who broke my heart."

1195
02:04:08,332 --> 02:04:13,926
"Accept my best wishes."

1196
02:04:25,710 --> 02:04:31,402
"Sorrow is another name of love."

1197
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:37,168
"Accept it without complain."

1198
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:43,047
"Sorrow is another name of love."

1199
02:04:43,128 --> 02:04:48,844
"Accept it without complain."

1200
02:04:48,925 --> 02:04:54,574
"Accept it without complain."

1201
02:04:54,655 --> 02:05:00,236
"If you still don't find peace."

1202
02:05:00,481 --> 02:05:05,854
"Shed a few tears and sing a little."

1203
02:05:06,143 --> 02:05:11,750
"After having ruined my life..."

1204
02:05:11,831 --> 02:05:17,669
"Begin your life anew."

1205
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:23,412
"Whenever you miss me."

1206
02:05:23,493 --> 02:05:28,966
"Just shed a few tears."

1207
02:05:54,589 --> 02:05:56,886
Have you married me for this?

1208
02:06:06,670 --> 02:06:08,859
You have ruined my daughter.

1209
02:06:10,375 --> 02:06:14,143
You intentionally
got married to her...

1210
02:06:15,374 --> 02:06:18,974
...to a man who was about to die.

1211
02:06:19,793 --> 02:06:22,143
God won't forgive you.

1212
02:06:22,671 --> 02:06:27,170
How can I guarantee for his life?
His time came and he died.

1213
02:06:27,942 --> 02:06:33,373
Not only him but Manju's
youth also has ended.

1214
02:06:34,347 --> 02:06:36,049
Her world came to an end.

1215
02:06:36,428 --> 02:06:39,974
And it tortured a father's heart.

1216
02:06:41,036 --> 02:06:43,075
Are you satisfied now, aunty?

1217
02:06:43,306 --> 02:06:45,994
Was I her enemy?

1218
02:06:46,253 --> 02:06:49,887
You evil,
you have swallowed my brother.

1219
02:06:49,968 --> 02:06:51,671
What are you waiting for?

1220
02:06:51,752 --> 02:06:54,401
Get out from here. I won't
let you live here for a minute.

1221
02:06:54,672 --> 02:06:59,117
I'll complain to father if
you throw her out. He is lying down.

1222
02:06:59,198 --> 02:07:02,086
Sit here. Stay away from here.

1223
02:07:02,167 --> 02:07:05,374
She will finish all of you
if she lives here. She's a jinx.

1224
02:07:06,834 --> 02:07:10,414
Enough. There is a limit to endurance.

1225
02:07:11,267 --> 02:07:15,712
This misfortunate
won't live here. Bye.

1226
02:07:21,686 --> 02:07:24,834
Come here! Got lost. Go.

1227
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:38,254
They are the children of the nation.

1228
02:07:38,755 --> 02:07:41,956
By taking my head on your lap...

1229
02:07:42,201 --> 02:07:45,024
...you have taken these
children into your protection.

1230
02:07:45,309 --> 02:07:48,591
You have to become their mother.

1231
02:07:48,889 --> 02:07:52,038
This is my last wish.

1232
02:07:52,255 --> 02:07:55,767
This is my last wish.

1233
02:08:00,377 --> 02:08:05,054
Sister-in-law,
don't force me to leave.

1234
02:08:05,796 --> 02:08:08,494
I've yet to do lot for these children.

1235
02:08:08,850 --> 02:08:13,494
- A lot.
- You come back again!

1236
02:08:13,783 --> 02:08:16,903
Get out else I'll
throw you out insulted.

1237
02:08:17,621 --> 02:08:22,494
- No one can throw her out.
- I'll throw her out.

1238
02:08:22,796 --> 02:08:25,903
Beat aunt!

1239
02:08:27,743 --> 02:08:29,512
Mohan!

1240
02:08:31,472 --> 02:08:32,809
Mohan!

1241
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:34,850
Mohan!
- Who?

1242
02:08:39,891 --> 02:08:44,092
- Get up. I brought food.
- Take it back. I won't eat.

1243
02:08:45,161 --> 02:08:47,534
How long will you suffer?

1244
02:08:48,539 --> 02:08:50,534
As much as is written in my fate.

1245
02:08:53,499 --> 02:08:58,678
Her old husband didn't keep
her happy and he dead.

1246
02:08:58,975 --> 02:09:00,494
I'll bring her today itself.

1247
02:09:00,741 --> 02:09:04,659
Don't bring her here.
Her husband died not her name.

1248
02:09:05,295 --> 02:09:10,388
Her reputation will be spoiled.
I'll lose my face too.

1249
02:09:10,592 --> 02:09:12,469
Don't you love her anymore?

1250
02:09:12,876 --> 02:09:17,928
I still love her but
cannot see her humiliated.

1251
02:09:19,537 --> 02:09:23,292
Moon is far away in the sky yet,
is in the lap of river too.

1252
02:09:24,834 --> 02:09:31,711
O my beloved don't think you are away.

1253
02:09:32,523 --> 02:09:37,860
You are alive, burning
in my heart like a forest fire.

1254
02:09:38,064 --> 02:09:44,174
Wood becomes coal when
burnt and then turns into ashes.

1255
02:09:46,171 --> 02:09:52,214
My heart is burning but I cannot
turn into neither coal nor ash.

1256
02:10:10,266 --> 02:10:13,414
Basanti, come in.

1257
02:10:15,536 --> 02:10:18,214
You still remember Basanti!

1258
02:10:18,495 --> 02:10:22,062
You never looked at the
village since you have come.

1259
02:10:22,428 --> 02:10:25,562
You cannot remain
like lifeless forever.

1260
02:10:25,806 --> 02:10:31,845
I left as a married woman.
How can I show my face as a widow?

1261
02:10:33,874 --> 02:10:41,254
Father comes to meet me here.
And mother doesn't matter.

1262
02:10:44,319 --> 02:10:47,007
Anyway, who is there
for me in this village?

1263
02:10:47,345 --> 02:10:51,480
Many. How can you forget Mohan?

1264
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:52,871
Basanti!

1265
02:10:53,735 --> 02:10:55,694
I am not just a girl now.

1266
02:10:56,129 --> 02:11:01,694
I am a woman,
a mother and a widow now.

1267
02:11:02,278 --> 02:11:05,694
Do you want to stain
the reputation of the family?

1268
02:11:05,967 --> 02:11:12,493
Go away. I cannot hear anyone's name.

1269
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:15,694
I have nothing to do with anyone now.

1270
02:11:16,277 --> 02:11:22,235
If you have no attachment, listen...

1271
02:11:23,195 --> 02:11:27,032
...my engagement with
Mohan is going to take place.

1272
02:11:27,276 --> 02:11:29,334
I came to invite you.

1273
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:33,734
Come positively.
There won't be any fun without you.

1274
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,505
Food is going to spill.

1275
02:11:47,965 --> 02:11:54,451
- You burnt your fingers.
- I'm not burnt because of that.

1276
02:11:54,857 --> 02:12:00,099
- Then, with what? - Your words.

1277
02:12:01,695 --> 02:12:04,207
Is it because I'm snatching
away Mohan from you?

1278
02:12:05,276 --> 02:12:07,748
Or is it because of
my engagement with him?

1279
02:12:08,424 --> 02:12:14,032
You ruined him and want
no one should revive him.

1280
02:12:15,168 --> 02:12:18,964
You have shattered the
nicest person in the village?

1281
02:12:19,452 --> 02:12:21,910
Want no one else bring him alive?

1282
02:12:22,398 --> 02:12:27,369
You have set up your home
but cannot see others do it.

1283
02:12:27,695 --> 02:12:28,977
Basanti!

1284
02:12:34,276 --> 02:12:36,814
What have I done!

1285
02:12:38,222 --> 02:12:39,814
What have I done!

1286
02:12:42,586 --> 02:12:45,747
What have I done!

1287
02:12:46,181 --> 02:12:49,504
You haven't done it but
your love did it, you fool.

1288
02:12:50,357 --> 02:12:55,059
It flares up like a tiny
ember when the ashes are turned.

1289
02:12:55,895 --> 02:12:59,992
The body disappears
but the soul remains.

1290
02:13:00,696 --> 02:13:05,464
Who will congratulate
me if you don't come?

1291
02:13:07,627 --> 02:13:08,854
I'm going.

1292
02:13:29,302 --> 02:13:35,005
"My destiny was made,
but was ruined again."

1293
02:13:35,086 --> 02:13:40,909
"The world ruined us."

1294
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:46,666
"My destiny was made,
but was ruined again."

1295
02:13:46,747 --> 02:13:52,477
"The world ruined us."

1296
02:13:52,558 --> 02:13:58,166
"Despite being overwhelmed by sorrow."

1297
02:13:58,247 --> 02:14:03,882
"This heart only thinks of you."

1298
02:14:03,963 --> 02:14:09,341
"Despite being overwhelmed by sorrow."

1299
02:14:09,422 --> 02:14:15,071
"This heart only thinks of you."

1300
02:14:15,152 --> 02:14:18,706
"My destiny was made.."

1301
02:14:25,910 --> 02:14:34,126
"What is the point in
crying over my lost love now."

1302
02:14:34,884 --> 02:14:42,465
"Love has broken many a heart."

1303
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:53,181
"O broken hearted lovers, tell me..."

1304
02:14:53,399 --> 02:14:58,897
"...who has destiny ever let flourish."

1305
02:14:59,128 --> 02:15:04,492
"O broken hearted lovers, tell me..."

1306
02:15:04,573 --> 02:15:10,019
"...who has destiny ever let flourish."

1307
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:13,398
"My destiny was made..."

1308
02:15:20,371 --> 02:15:28,414
"It is difficult
to live a confined life"

1309
02:15:29,129 --> 02:15:36,574
"O death, I am waiting for you."

1310
02:15:42,021 --> 02:15:48,014
"Come and softly tell me..."

1311
02:15:48,095 --> 02:15:53,263
"...I am releasing you."

1312
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:58,723
"Come and softly tell me..."

1313
02:15:58,804 --> 02:16:04,169
"...I am releasing you."

1314
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:09,614
"My destiny was made,
but was ruined again"

1315
02:16:09,695 --> 02:16:15,006
"The world ruined us."

1316
02:16:15,196 --> 02:16:17,520
"My destiny was made."

1317
02:16:23,737 --> 02:16:25,763
My engagement with
Mohan is taking place.

1318
02:16:26,899 --> 02:16:29,939
I came to invite you. Come positively.

1319
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:32,494
There is no fun without you.

1320
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:39,870
Is it because I'm snatching
away Mohan from you?

1321
02:16:40,451 --> 02:16:43,126
Or, I'm getting engaged to him?

1322
02:16:43,358 --> 02:16:46,478
You crushed down a nicest person.

1323
02:16:46,816 --> 02:16:49,437
Don't want others revive him.

1324
02:16:49,708 --> 02:16:54,680
You set up your home.
Why cannot you see others do it?

1325
02:17:32,215 --> 02:17:34,574
Mother, where are you going?

1326
02:17:36,451 --> 02:17:40,173
Sleep dear. I'm not going anywhere.

1327
02:17:41,628 --> 02:17:44,843
Going no where. Sleep, dear.

1328
02:17:46,343 --> 02:17:48,207
Sleep! Sleep, dear.

1329
02:17:49,195 --> 02:17:52,180
Sleep, dear.

1330
02:17:53,465 --> 02:17:54,748
Sleep, dear.

1331
02:17:57,857 --> 02:17:59,214
The rope broke!

1332
02:18:01,385 --> 02:18:09,060
"The sky calls out to the earth."

1333
02:18:09,371 --> 02:18:17,397
"Come to your beloved."

1334
02:18:19,466 --> 02:18:23,330
"You will have to come."

1335
02:19:35,897 --> 02:19:41,625
Brother Mahku... Brother Mahku..
Brother Mahku...

1336
02:19:42,897 --> 02:19:44,472
Get up.

1337
02:19:44,554 --> 02:19:48,627
- Get up.
- What's the matter?

1338
02:19:48,817 --> 02:19:49,897
Listen.

1339
02:19:52,412 --> 02:19:55,334
Really? - I saw it myself.
- Bring me my coat.

1340
02:20:00,641 --> 02:20:02,334
Fast.

1341
02:20:03,384 --> 02:20:06,334
God, I wish this gets joined again.

1342
02:20:10,357 --> 02:20:17,964
"The sky calls out to the earth."

1343
02:20:18,965 --> 02:20:28,033
"Come to your beloved."

1344
02:20:29,115 --> 02:20:32,774
"You will have to come!"

1345
02:20:47,426 --> 02:20:50,965
Manju! Here!

1346
02:20:51,953 --> 02:20:57,817
I came to congratulate
you for your engagement.

1347
02:20:58,385 --> 02:21:00,817
Engagement is done
for people who are alive.

1348
02:21:03,169 --> 02:21:06,708
I died the day you
left the village, married.

1349
02:21:09,006 --> 02:21:11,814
You said we will never separate.

1350
02:21:13,277 --> 02:21:15,814
But you separated yourself from me.

1351
02:21:17,290 --> 02:21:20,398
Why did you do it, Manju?

1352
02:21:22,872 --> 02:21:26,814
Why did you do it?

1353
02:21:28,589 --> 02:21:30,482
My life was for you.

1354
02:21:31,913 --> 02:21:33,854
You couldn't take care of it.

1355
02:21:34,576 --> 02:21:36,854
My body belongs to someone.

1356
02:21:37,536 --> 02:21:38,854
Soul belongs to you.

1357
02:21:40,752 --> 02:21:42,886
Souls can unite...

1358
02:21:43,833 --> 02:21:46,183
...when the body ceases to be alive.

1359
02:21:46,264 --> 02:21:47,278
Manju!

1360
02:21:51,603 --> 02:21:54,792
Look, the storm is going to hit.

1361
02:21:56,293 --> 02:21:57,894
I should go back.

1362
02:21:59,563 --> 02:22:03,657
I've to go back. I've to go back.

1363
02:22:09,361 --> 02:22:10,894
Are you going away?

1364
02:22:13,401 --> 02:22:18,238
Yes. I've to go. I've to go.

1365
02:22:20,104 --> 02:22:22,792
Our union isn't
acceptable to the society.

1366
02:22:24,955 --> 02:22:25,900
No.

1367
02:22:30,455 --> 02:22:35,657
- Don't go, Manju.
- No. Our path are different now.

1368
02:22:35,738 --> 02:22:38,780
We have to go in two
different directions.

1369
02:23:19,144 --> 02:23:20,481
Manju!

1370
02:23:30,725 --> 02:23:37,305
Life has ended. But not the love.

1371
02:23:39,887 --> 02:23:46,014
You are dead for the
world but alive for me.

1372
02:23:47,225 --> 02:23:49,414
You will be alive for me forever.

1373
02:23:51,157 --> 02:23:54,014
No one else can possess you now.

1374
02:23:55,158 --> 02:23:59,414
You are mine from today. Mine only.

1375
02:24:00,874 --> 02:24:03,014
You will be mine forever, Manju.

1376
02:24:10,361 --> 02:24:16,184
You, Sinner.
What did I do to deserve your revenge?

1377
02:24:16,415 --> 02:24:17,697
Speak up.

1378
02:24:17,778 --> 02:24:20,954
What can he say.
Call police before he escapes.

1379
02:24:21,035 --> 02:24:22,048
We will fight the case.

1380
02:24:22,129 --> 02:24:25,845
- Beat him!
- Order! Order!

1381
02:24:26,090 --> 02:24:27,616
Order! Order!

1382
02:24:28,752 --> 02:24:33,054
The accused doesn't want to
say anything against the evidence.

1383
02:24:33,334 --> 02:24:37,806
All the evidence shows
he committed the murder.

1384
02:24:38,091 --> 02:24:42,536
So, the court awards
him 20 years imprisonment.

1385
02:24:52,158 --> 02:24:59,657
"The sky calls out to the earth."

1386
02:25:00,117 --> 02:25:07,792
"Come to your beloved."

1387
02:25:10,104 --> 02:25:13,400
"You will have to come!"

1388
02:25:13,698 --> 02:25:16,914
Manju! I'm coming.

1389
02:25:31,347 --> 02:25:38,859
"You will have to leave this world."

1390
02:25:39,468 --> 02:25:47,156
"You will have to break
all these illusionary ties."

1391
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:53,129
"And leave."

1392
02:25:55,387 --> 02:25:57,859
Manju wait. I'm coming.

1393
02:26:14,076 --> 02:26:19,199
"This journey of life."

1394
02:26:19,384 --> 02:26:24,247
"This journey of life..."

1395
02:26:24,551 --> 02:26:27,274
"...will always continue."

1396
02:26:27,794 --> 02:26:29,739
"But alas! We won't be there.."

1397
02:26:29,820 --> 02:26:32,388
"...will always continue."

1398
02:26:32,469 --> 02:26:34,982
"But alas! We won't be there."

1399
02:26:35,063 --> 02:26:39,739
"This journey of life."
