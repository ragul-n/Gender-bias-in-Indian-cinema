00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,580
Eh..

00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,184
5 YEARS LATER

4
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,414
5 YEARS LATER

5
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,225
Sir,

6
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,904
Are you to the mental hospital for sure?

7
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,741
What job do you have there?

8
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,402
Or.. Is it for some treatment?

9
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,478
Is it so, Sir?

10
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,341
Eh..

11
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,675
How does it look like?

12
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:39,616
That...

13
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,220
From the looks you don't seem
to have any problems

14
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,918
To ask whether you are a doctor“

15
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,818
There is nothing of that kind there..

16
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,320
M!
ms

17
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,430
It is not a great place..

18
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,563
That is a Devil's fort

19
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,028
Oh My Saint Anthony! What a terrible cold.

20
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,360
That Toad is not to be seen either

21
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,066
Lord Bless..

22
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,980
His old ramshackle vehicle and Him...

E
a

24
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,416
Do you know the value of time?

25
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,088
Been standing there, I started to freeze

26
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,980
Doesn't this vehicle need travel that far!

27
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:50,823
What is there so much to move..

28
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,286
Isn't it the vehicle that is moving..
Not you, Right?

29
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,425
Ails m”
a

30
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,617
Usually it is five days, isn't it?

31
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,987
If it is five, so be it..

32
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:56,591
Who is there to read..

33
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,854
Here have your puff and leave...

35
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,031
Leave fast"

36
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,731
Othen/vise everything will go stale.

37
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,766
Oh.. There..

38
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,467
Sir.. Sir..

39
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:11,944
The destination is reached..

40
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,446
Get down here..

41
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:14,643
Look..

42
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,874
That Avarachan is to that place..

43
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,809
Go along with him...

44
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,946
I am going this way..

45
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,350
Ya..

46
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,519
Sir. Go ahead..

47
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,708
Who knows what would be his fate?

48
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:55,816
Eh..

49
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,930
"If the thoughts are right"

50
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,502
"Then it is said to be Time.."

51
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,536
"For no reason..."

52
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,437
"You do not put me in the
middle of this sorrow“

53
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,840
"As the net was flung on the shores..."

54
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,979
Eh...

55
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:21,806
Who is this Westerner?

56
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,379
Don't vehicles go this way?

57
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,983
This way?

58
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,710
This is a deserted corner“.

59
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,149
Who is there to come!

60
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,559
All that is here, is a Mental Hospital..

61
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,860
Vehicles do reach that place

62
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,493
But its quite a round about.

63
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,024
This is a short-cut.

64
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,857
On the way there is a river..

65
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:39,898
Ya..

66
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,435
Oh My Lord..

67
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,468
Come on..

68
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,642
After the river is crossed

69
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,935
there is one hill

70
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,971
Once you cross that

71
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,982
there is a second hill

72
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,206
Reached..

73
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,413
Come ..Come..

74
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,846
The only difficulty is in reaching there..

75
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,746
Once you reach, then that is the end..

76
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,124
Even if you die no one will know..

77
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,757
Got scared?

78
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:16,898
Need not be afraid..
Just come along..

79
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,506
All this you see here
belonged to some old king..

80
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,712
That fraud Doctor got
it all done in his name

81
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,509
Is he that bad?

82
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,449
Is it!

83
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,517
They are all the representatives
of netherworld!

84
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,716
To take care of them,
there is a Goan Doctor

85
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:38,958
And his accomplice

86
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,524
A perfect b...

87
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,250
Vamp...

88
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,469
I am the only one
who gets to see the outside world

89
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,942
And that too once in a week,

90
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,811
Wandering through lands
buying all these stuff

91
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,884
And feeding those people is my job...!

92
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,520
My fate..

93
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,625
So then the salary must be quite good..

94
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,291
Of course...a good salary

95
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,993
First rate kicks and stabs"

96
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,023
Oh My NM-

97
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,897
And topped with that
is that swindler Doctor's,

98
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,662
Ear shaming vulgar abuses..

99
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,901
And since all that is in English
I don't get to understand any

100
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:39,979
Come..

101
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,021
Be careful not to slip..

102
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,890
I forgot to ask you something

103
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,615
Where are you going this way, Sir?

104
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,988
A
a

105
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,064
To the hospital?

106
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,124
I am from the Medical College

107
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,663
After knowing the developments here

108
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,097
The Government has send me to find out..

109
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,838
What you said your name is?

110
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,640
Av. . Av. .

111
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,602
Anthony...

112
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,340
Holy Mary..

A
a

114
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,584
What do you say about
the treatment methods there?

115
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,181
The treatment methods are really nice..

116
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,054
Ya..

117
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,627
That's why patients often
commit suicide there

118
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,355
and skeletons turn up in the nearby farms..

119
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,067
Anyway it's good that
I met you before reaching there

120
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,899
I will need your help..

tune of swaying flowers"

Darling..

146
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,502
Come close to me...

147
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,879
How long has it been since I saw you?

148
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,075
Listen..Last night I dreamt about you

149
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,220
Why are you locked up in this cell?

150
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,855
Whom did you kill?

151
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:34,539
Tell..

152
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,222
Do you know
I've to evade many eyes to reach here

153
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,457
Come closer, dear..

154
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,092
Shall I apply this..

155
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,355
Who is it?

156
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,222
Dr. M K Nair

Psychiatry Dept, Trivandrum Medical College

159
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,579
I've been asked to inspect this place..

160
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,648
Under instructions from the Government

161
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,684
Oh! Don't need all this.

162
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,520
I do know you very well, Sir.

163
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,655
How, When and Where?

164
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,152
Who does not know you in this field?

165
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,053
Why do you speak this way, Sir?

166
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,361
I did not get you!..

167
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,701

Everywhere there is a person like this..

171
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,406
Where is the doctor?

172
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,546
Please come..be seated in the office..

173
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,178

Sorry..A patient.

Please allow me to handle this..

181
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:38,696
Shouldn't I be introduced?

182
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:39,690
Is he new?

183
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,498
- Who is it?

You didn't tell me..
Is he with me?

185
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,194
Why don't you say if a new person comes?

186
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,667
I must know who it is!

187
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,723
What do outsiders have to do here?

188
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,090
Leave today itself..

189
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,490
If not..

190
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:11,822
Will kill you..

191
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,697
Kill and bury you..

192
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,700
Make a note of this

193
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,040
Just three days..

194
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,535
Won't go beyond that.

195
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,812
I saw the sacrificial souls at the altar

196
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,481
Sun had darkened core black..

197
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,686
Moon turned like blood red..

198
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,488
Stars from sky will fall on the earth

199
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,262
Sorry Doctor"

200
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:46,564
Please com e..

201
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,172
Jesus..

202
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,771
A Palatial house
but with one and half inch pathway!

203
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:58,769
(Spits)

204
00:17:59,211 --> 00:17:59,769
Hell..

205
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,108
Like on every Friday
chickens getting restless"

206
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,215
ls my situation now

207
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,343
There... it is kept open..

208
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,452
Ah.. It is me who opened it..

209
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,417
By the way what I don't understand is

210
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,684
What is there so much to investigate?

211
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,526
Many came...Many left

212
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,422
Ha..ha..

213
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,394
Whoever comes, there is one benefit..

214
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,893
Will wallow the Goan Englishman's liquor

215
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,895
and eat sumptuous food and leave

216
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,203
There.. the door is left open

217
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,242
That too is done by me..

218
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,474
4-5 months later, another one will come

219
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,271
There see one has come now..

220
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,914
From Trivandrum Medical College..

221
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,114
Now what is he going to investigate

222
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,149
Only God knows..

223
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,386
There..

224
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,246
One to be kept open is closed

225
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,151
And one to be kept closed is open.

226
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,224
Who is it who made me!

227
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,259
Let me leave the umbrella here..

228
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:02,297
By the way is he really a nuisance?

229
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,245
From his looks he doesn't appear straight

230
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:13,376
His sunken nose, crooked eyes..

231
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,915
That sly look like a thief

232
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,915
There is something off, really..

233
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,486
By the looks he seems to be a trouble

234
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,923
Oh.. Is he harmful?

235
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,693
If so, shouldn'tl inform madam

236
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:30,391
Oh...oh...Madam.. Madam“.

237
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,169
Where will she listen..

238
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,305
She must be flirting with
that white chap!

239
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,237
Madam..Madam..

240
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,467
Oh..Madam..

241
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,678
Where were you all the while?

242
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,472
What is point of me going anywhere!

243
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,705
A bloke from Trivandrum
Medical College has landed,

244
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,417
to evaluate us.

245
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,677
What is the point of me speaking silently"

246
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,252
That guy will land anytime"

247
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,445
Jesus..

248
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,353
Our boarding and lodging
here will end today"

249
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,551
He has come to close this lock,
stock and barrel.

250
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,724
He is inside..

251
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,692
- Who...
- That man is inside..

252
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,595
His newspaper!

253
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,535
Took the rig ht path

254
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,742
Jesus..Back stabbed

255
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,774
Let my tongue be cursed

256
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,693
Don't get misguided
by seeing all that, Doctor..

257
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,961
Those are not what we do here..

258
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,799
Benjamin Diaz..

259
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,942
Don't you give shock treatment here?

260
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,947
Actually I am not against ECT

261
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,622
But..l don't do that

262
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,854
My methods... are different

263
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,591
What are your methods?

264
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:12,837
Dr. Nair..

265
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,835
On facing some hard realities in life

266
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,277
People who have lost their mental balance

267
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,704
Are the inmates here

268
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,610
As the relatives being ashamed
of keeping them at home

269
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,786
They bring them and hand over to me

270
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,319
Of course they are filthy rich

271
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,020
They dump money on them

272
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,657
And...

273
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,889
I build this

274
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,963
A Home for the Mind

275
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,057
Didn't get you!

276
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,968
Only an insane mind
can understand another insane mind..

277
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:44,928
Isn't it?

278
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:46,703
The inmate here

279
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,101
...are not patients

280
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,835
They are my family

281
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,500
Some aspects that cannot be removed
from their minds

282
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,612
are the main reason for their conditions.

283
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,680
If those aspects could be erased

284
00:21:58,884 --> 00:21:59,851
Then the matter become easier

285
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,714
Sol erase the past!

286
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,024
Tell something probable..

287
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,960
Erase the past!

288
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,032
It works, Doctor..

289
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,434
Through hypno-therapy that can be done

290
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,809
Doctor, a 16th century illusionary
art started by Mesmer

291
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,042
was written off as unscientific then itself

292
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,553
A person by your name is the one
who put Mesmer into the dustbin

293
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,854
Benjamin..

294
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:40,817
Franklin

295
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:41,822
Yes I know

296
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:48,425
But in the 70s that was the most
acceptable method

297
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,534
Where Suggestibility
exists, hypnotism works

298
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,829
You can never hypnotize a person like me

299
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,138
I am someone who doesn't
even listen to his own father..

300
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,180
Are you attempting to hypnotizing me?

301
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,054
One...

302
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:22,663
Two. .

303
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,704
Three..

304
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,189
I dozed off, didn't I?

305
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:19,752
Sorry"

306
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,694
I tried to prove you that it really works

307
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,995
lam not believing in
the methodology still..

308
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,466
- For you seeing would be believing.
-Yes..

309
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,134
That is why I cam e..

310
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,510
Don't think that I will fall
for these gimmicks“.

311
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,973
I got it right when I stepped in

312
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,912
Nothing is ok here.

313
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,776
Now the onus of that being othenwise

314
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,675
ls yours..

315
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:50,849
Sure..

316
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,949
First take some rest...

317
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,691
I didn't come here to eat and take rest

318
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,158
Got to take a look at everything rig ht away

319
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,827
So... Any issues!

320
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:02,662
No problem...

321
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:03,630
Renuka

322
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:06,200
Yes, Doctor"

323
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,869
Please show him around..

324
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:09,265
Please come, Sir..

325
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:10,637
Thank you..

326
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:12,938
Doctor"

327
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,238
If anything odd shows up,
I will report

328
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,939
One patient.

329
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,207
Just one patient.

330
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,808
Just one sentence

331
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:22,981
is enough

332
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,647
That will end

333
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,050
Sir, May I hold the bag?

334
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:48,939
Morning, Professor..

335
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,205
Come in, come in..

336
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,843
How was sleep?

337
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,042
Did you sleep well?

338
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,815
What do I say“.

339
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:56,949
See..

340
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,157
To meet my son and daughter

341
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,725
I started from New York to Chicago.

342
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,794
I had to wait three hours in JFK

343
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,123
Flight was late..

344
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,126
Then the journey..

345
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,857
Five and Half hours.

346
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:09,296
O0ff..

347
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,293
How do I sleep?

348
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:11,965
Did not sleep a bit!

349
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,703
Who the hell are you?

350
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,049
I am P.Subramaniyam lyer..

351
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,312
I am so glad to meet you, Man..

352
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,087
Do you have any difficulties here, Sir?

353
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:33,752
Ya..

354
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,257
Schaden Freude

355
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,961
Schaden Freude

356
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,926
Please tell me the meaning of that..

357
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,329
Doctor, shall we..

358
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,168
You..

359
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,804
By looks it appears you know

360
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:47,938
You don't know..

361
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,038
Schaden Freude

362
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,676
Listen"

363
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,311
At least tell me

364
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,336
And where are you going?

365
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,648
If he doesn't know, he doesn't know

366
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,084
Schaden Freude

367
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,719
Why did you tear off?

368
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,320
He writes letters to home

369
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,717
ls there any law that says
no writing letters to home?

370
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,226
There is no body in Professor's home..

371
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,762
Wife and children died in a car
accident in Chicago

372
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,058
Years ago

373
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,032
This is Hussain Bala..

374
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,066
A painter

375
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,201
You saw me coming, isn't it?

376
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,034
I didn't meet you on the way.
Were you hiding somewhere?

377
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,172
Hussain doesn't speak with anyone.

378
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,813
Though he has been here for 4 years

379
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,243
He has never stepped outside

380
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,808
He has that special power ..

381
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,820
Sometimes draws events that are
yet to take place

382
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,350
This is what he drew yesterday"

383
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,506
Sir, shall we..

384
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,383
Now, Sir, did you get

385
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,853
Unlike what is being spoken outside,
there is no issues here

386
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:51,723
Please com e..

387
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:53,758
When you see the rest too,

388
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,730
hope you will be convinced completely.

389
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,040
Sir, where in Thiruvanathapuram
are you from?

390
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,967
My mother's home is in Thiruvananthapuram..

391
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,268
If I tell you about them, you may know..

392
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,070
If you've come to guide me..

393
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,541
Then do that.

394
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:10,505
Sorry..

395
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:24,295
This way..

396
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,290
What is the noise there?

397
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:29,996
Where?

398
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,395
I didn't hear anything"

399
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,029
You must have felt so..

400
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,905
This is a mansion build by the Britishers..

401
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,934
Even though it has been
about 6 years since I came

402
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,238
I have not seen everything here

403
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,242
Please come...

404
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,975
Where are the rest of the patients?

405
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,577
I will have them assemble in the hall

406
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,264
Don't repeat the show
that you put up downstairs

407
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:04,364
Stay quiet

408
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,037
Whatever is asked

409
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,261
Just stay silent

410
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,116
If you are facing any problem,

411
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:27,858
You can speak to me openly..

412
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,426
Anna Maria

413
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,191
I am fine here

414
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,066
Nothing is lacking here

415
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,065
This place is better than paradise

416
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,606
Vadakeddath Kamala Laxmi

417
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,944
Sir, if you face any problem here

418
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,371
Let me know

419
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,920
What happened on your forehead?

420
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,182
Five patients are being treated
is what you said..

421
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:26,542
Ya..

422
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:27,908
If I were to say there is a sixth person

423
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,110
Would you be able to deny that?

424
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,114
It is not that way, Doctor"

425
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,117
The sixth person is not a patient

426
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:37,890
She is my daughter

427
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,358
Nitya

428
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,191
Whoever it be, I got to meet her

429
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,060
And right now..

430
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,629
So... Any issues!

431
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,632
Not at all

432
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,137
Please

433
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,615
She is autistic

434
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,315
Who said Autism is an illness?

435
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,280
It is a developmental disorder..

436
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,683
Is that why the girl is locked up?

437
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,186
It is complicated

438
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:06,914
I shall explain

439
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,058
It ain't necessary..

440
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,105
Open..

441
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,211
Is that needed, Doctor?

442
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,136
I won't suggest that.

443
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:30,673
Open it UP"

444
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,213
a
a

445
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,109
He woke up... Ah..

446
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,742
I will support.

447
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:14,711
Slowly..

448
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,653
When she knocked you out,
it was day

449
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,618
Now it is night

450
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:19,813
That is the only difference

451
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,387
Sir, she is a martial an expert

452
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,652
She has killed 4 people and is here

453
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,755
Sir, you haven't lost any part
of your body"

454
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,292
FonunatenAnyway nothing to be afraid of..

455
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,265
Hot rice porridge is here

456
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,732
Have it and go to bed

457
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,663
Car will come early morning

458
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,308
And you may leave straight
to Thiruvananthapuram

459
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:38,871
it is very cold and raining outside

460
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,644
So I will be here to pep you up.

461
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,746
For what?

462
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,215
...to give a company for you..

463
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,579
No.. that is not needed

464
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,151
By the way is it because you think I mind

465
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,453
What to do!

466
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:58,628
0k.. if it is not needed, so be it..

467
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:02,464
Well then learn the hard way

468
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,632
Day One

469
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,675
From the moment I stepped in here

470
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,304
Somethings odd have caught my attention

471
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,141
Quiet mysterious are the things here

472
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:58,382
Quiet ancient and unscientific
are the treatment practices here

473
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,184
While getting acquainted today

474
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,459
Benjamin attempted at hypnotizing me

475
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,930
Without giving an inkling of
what is happening, I dozed off

476
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,530
Benjamin..

477
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,796
Is very strong

478
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,496
and dangerous too..

479
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:22,307
Why did he lie about
Nithya being his daughter?

480
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,427
Is anyone here?

481
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,714
Doctor

482
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,223
This is the first time
a doctor has come here

483
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,858
Did anyone see you coming here?

484
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,644
I am Lakshmi

485
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,607
I have been locked up here

486
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:24,942
Someone is coming..

487
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,078
Leave"

488
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,486
Nitya...

489
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,123
She needs to be rescued from here
at the earliest

490
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,988
Othen/vise" Benjamin..

491
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,756
She was not like this

492
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,733
After coming over here,

493
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,004
Something has happened to her

494
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,901
That he only knows..

495
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,105
You...

496
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,677
You need to discover that

497
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,039
How did Nitya reach here?

498
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,277
Come...

499
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,466
Open it..

500
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:51,598
But Sir...

501
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:53,208
Is that needed!

502
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:54,971
Eh..

503
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:57,144
May I ask Benjamin Sir's permission?

504
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:58,247
Open, Man..

505
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,216
Sir, I will lose my job..

506
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,451
Whether you open or not,
you will lose your job..

507
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:05,919
Then isn't it better to open

508
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,087
See..

509
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,226
How lovely you look!

510
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,602
Why did I cry?

511
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:36,106
Look, don't believe anyone here..

512
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:37,981
If you need anything...

513
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,273
Let me know

514
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,580
I have got some thing"

515
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,284
Shall I get that.

516
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,592
I will be back soon

517
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,198
Shall get that thing..Now..

518
00:48:58,636 --> 00:48:59,467
Oh!

519
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,532
Come...

520
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,504
a
a

521
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,504
- Take a look - Where?

522
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,337
See.

523
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,208
Sir,

524
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,575
Dr. Kanan Nair

525
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,320
Nitya..

526
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:45,012
Doctor, notice the brightness
on Nitya's face..

527
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:47,309
This will not harm

528
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,609
Rather it is good for her

529
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,754
So long the problem was the Father's
method of Treatment!

530
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:55,548
Now thatl am here

531
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,396
Sister" Need not

532
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,064
There are others who need the medicine

533
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,103
If you didn't understand,
then just ask him..

534
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,354
Doctor, did you fall for his performance?

535
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,390
It isn't difficult to establish
who Nitya is..

536
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:38,261
And that is his motive too..

537
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,135
Five years..

538
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,101
It took me five years

539
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,174
In five years..

540
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,835
I erased Nitya's memories..

541
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,617
Now whoever tries it will not come back

542
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,689
This confidence is good

543
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:03,253
But he is smart

544
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:06,463
Unlike the doctors who came before him

545
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,098
There is something different in his eyes

546
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,229
If his report goes negative

547
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,273
Not just Nitya

548
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,669
Everything will go off our hands

549
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,101
For someone who came from somewhere

550
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,540
What is his business here?

551
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,278
I am not saying this to worry you

552
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,117
Be wary of him

553
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:57,709
Darling..

554
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,826
Do you recall Jayanaryana Varma
of Nadakkal Kovillakath? (a lineage)

555
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,490
That is my elder brother"

556
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,935
This is Nitya..

557
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:20,632
My elder brother's only daughter

558
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,262
Oh s.. Thampuran (Noble)

559
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:23,836
Yes, we have met once..

560
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:27,573
He had come to discuss
his daughter's condition

561
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,801
He was very upset"

562
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:34,417
I told him that skills like martial arts
will be of great help to these kids

563
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:36,776
Autism is not a disability

564
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:39,781
It is a..

565
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:40,949
Different ability

566
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,321
Don't underestimate them..

567
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,754
My brother has left us..

568
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:50,334
There is no one in the house..

569
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,304
If anything happens to him,

570
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,670
To leave Nitya here

571
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,910
ls what my brother had told me
before his death

572
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,910
My brother's notings about Nitya is in this

573
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,686
These are the documents of the
property assigned in Nitya's name

574
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,187
Including this Bungalow in the High Range.

575
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,327
You can use it for Nitya's treatment

576
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,264
To trust and handover
her in this condition,

577
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:26,630
I do not know anyone else, other than you

578
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:34,644
Doctor, you must bring her up
like your daughter.

579
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:15,542
Nitya.. Nitya..

580
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,020
It is on my asking
that you have been brought here

581
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:26,893
The thing you gave me when you had left

582
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:30,028
I have kept it safe..

583
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,027
Now when will you give, what I had asked

584
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:05,601
I have felt that it is him who has
understood my daughter more than I have

585
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:10,372
The deficiencies others found
in them were their similarities

586
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,338
Nadakkal Nobles lorded over the
land called Edanad..

587
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,340
As a continuation of that lineage came

588
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,551
Elder brother Balarama Verma,
younger brother Sekharan,

589
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,744
Younger sister Lakshmi and me

590
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,857
Elder brother who's being
disabled by birth...

591
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,323
...and Sekharan who was
not blessed with kids,

592
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,087
The opposition to me for being
the custodian was natural

593
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,959
But my daughter who lost her
mother at birth

594
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,359
Was stamped mentally retarded

595
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:43,403
And was demanded to be abandoned

596
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:45,666
By elder brother and Sekharan

597
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,740
Opposing them, I brought her up

598
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,609
Standing by me, were younger sister Lakshmi

599
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,874
And her only son Vinayan, that's all..

600
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,350
The time I spent for
Nitya turned into years

601
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,517
As time passed with the realization
of my efforts going in vain

602
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,851
I discovered it

603
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,453
Gathering back the confidence
that was ebbing

604
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:35,456
I wore the martial dress for my daughter

605
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,633
The changes in her surprised everyone..

606
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,496
The Nadakkal ground get prepared

607
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,170
for Kanhika Thirunal Nitya Lakshmi

608
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:13,781
Eh

609
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,909
We have been watching Elder
brother's expertise over the years

610
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,110
It is not to see this
they are all assembled here

611
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,219
Isn't it been some time

612
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:21,614
That a sick girl is being trained
in to this an

613
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:22,792
Let her come

614
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:23,792
The Master...

615
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,723
What all has he trained his daughter into

616
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,294
Let the world know

617
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:28,687
Call her

618
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,127
Princess Nitya

619
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:33,801
Ones who are mentally sick
are not to be pampered and spoilt

620
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,096
Rather got to be chained

621
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:36,973
Principles and Techniques..

622
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,972
Martial arts is for men..

623
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:39,870
Isn't it?

624
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:38,352
Eh..

625
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:42,431
Steps been learnt

626
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:43,789
Grace is also mastered

627
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:47,498
Common man will applaud for any gimmicks!

628
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,805
Isn't that their habit!

629
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,470
On the compact arena, techniques
are to be known

630
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,280
Got to fig ht

631
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:02,746
can you?

632
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:30,972
In Nadakkal Martial training there is no
room for mischief..

633
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:51,452
"Dear, sleep"

634
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,255
"My sweet, sleep"

635
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,488
"My prosperity, sleep"

636
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,597
"Dear, sleep"

637
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,539
"Dear, sleep"

638
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,375
"My sweet, sleep"

639
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,600
"My prosperity, sleep"

640
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:11,003
"Dear, sleep"

641
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:21,622
"Sweety, swinging in the cradle"

642
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,460
"Like the pearl in the oyster"

643
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:27,255
"My dear baby"

644
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:32,867
"I will always adorn you and fondle you"

645
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:38,371
<i>"I'll</i> put a bindi on
your beautiful forehead"

646
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,135
"Seeing your smiles"

647
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:44,039
"ls very lovely"

648
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,912
"if you cry, it is darkness in my heart"

649
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,455
"In the throbbing kettledrum of my heart"

650
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,058
"There is no rhythm"

651
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:02,697
"There is not enough tune
to put you to sleep"

652
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:08,197
"O small bud, growing on my flower tree"

653
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:14,572
"Bloom slowly, the spring is waiting"

654
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,661
I am stepping into more hazards

655
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,462
Today's murder attempt

656
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:56,128
is a warning

657
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:58,632
One thing is certain

658
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,470
They have started getting scared of me

659
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,297
Kanhika Thirunal Nitya Lakshmi

660
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,336
Do you remember anyone in that picture?

661
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,779
What happened in that house that day?

662
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,653
You know who did it, Nithya!

663
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:42,510
Excuse me..

664
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:43,905
Ah..Lily

665
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:44,803
Nitya is here

666
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,209
Take her to the room

667
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:54,713
Hmm.. Come on..

668
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:55,857
Leave"

669
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,587
Sorry Sir, it is bed time

670
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:03,332
Here punctuality in sleeping
and rising is mandatory.

671
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,304
Why are you looking unwell?

672
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:12,473
Are you sick?

673
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:14,441
No..

674
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:15,611
Temperature isn't there!

675
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,403
These are just stress..

676
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,215
A little relaxation is enough

677
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,577
Are you always like this?

678
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:25,786
Serious!

679
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:27,888
Don't you laugh a bit?

680
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:37,729
Benjamin Sir has specifically asked me to
take care of all of Doctor's needs

681
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,767
Just consider you are on a vacation here..

682
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:51,506
For any of your needs..
I am available

683
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,453
By the time you leave here Sir,

684
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,462
All your misgivings about us
would have been altered

685
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,966
Thereafter you will be writing
a good report

686
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,062
lam sure

687
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,270
Then why those files

688
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:18,663
Hand them over..

689
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:25,910
Renuka...

690
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:30,717
You are dealing with a wrong person

691
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:43,088
People with greater guts have come here

692
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,362
They have not returned

693
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,063
Record that too..

694
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,070
Listen carefully to what I am saying

695
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,977
That person who has come,
must not be seen here tomorrow

696
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,034
That is it

697
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:41,423
Oh..My...Electricity has gone

698
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,488
Oh...The wind and rain
of yesterday had me feel

699
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,858
that electricity will go today"

700
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:38,608
Oh. Jesus..

701
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:39,747
You are so compassionate

702
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:40,882
Bless.. Bless..

703
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:42,484
What to Bless..

704
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:45,086
Elm

705
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,182
A mansion bigger than a central jail!

706
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,991
Must have been born to some beggar,
a dirty guy...!

707
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:52,058
Jesus... Protect me!

708
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:43,750
Good morning, Sir..

709
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:47,250
Yesterday that guard

710
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,015
Carried you like a rice
sack and dropped you here

711
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,818
The way he carried and left you,
I thought you were dead

712
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:00,028
Are you looking for the file?

713
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:01,899
Move a bit..

714
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,404
That file has goddamn nothing in it

715
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,103
After being tortured,

716
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:09,174
"I was tortured", Would
anyone note in a file?

717
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:11,812
This is really silly, Sir

718
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,912
If you intend to walk out from here,

719
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:17,051
Decently shake hands and must leave

720
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,085
Wasn't that how the doctors
who came earlier did!

721
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:20,517
Why needlessly seek...

722
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:24,558
Was there a visit to the Police station
with the file yesterday?

723
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:26,995
Come with me, Sir

724
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:31,822
Isn't that Police station a branch office
of this mental asylum?

725
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:35,197
The policemen there live on the Crumbs
offered by Benjamin Sir

726
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:37,132
Don't show stupidity...

727
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:38,199
Further,

728
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:41,171
You being a Government employee,
nobody will do any harm

729
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,502
That guard scared you with an unloaded gun

730
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,142
He is one of the Patients here

731
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:46,107
Oh my Jesus!

732
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:48,908
I bluffed and ruined my livelihood

733
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:52,577
So Sir, neither have I told you
anything nor have you heard anything

734
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:53,786
Please come

735
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,086
2nd Murder Attem pt

736
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,354
This time,

737
01:19:57,893 --> 01:19:59,224
the intention was definitely to kill

738
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:02,854
Nithya's Medical records are also lost

739
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:10,394
I can't leave Nithya to Benjamin's cruelty

740
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:14,074
Aworld beyond these walls

741
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:15,835
She got to know exists

742
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,006
Through me, she must know!

743
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,946
That mark hasn't still gone!

744
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,347
Do you remember how it got caused?

745
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:12,927
How many beatings I got, that day

746
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,028
It is to remember me

747
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:22,067
Until this mark fades,
you will never forget me

748
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,204
Attention Deficit Disorder

749
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,207
Doesn't allow attention on anything,

750
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,639
But will be hyperactive

751
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,445
That is Jeevan

752
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,946
Once he decides to get something

753
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,251
He will go to any extremes!

754
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:49,722
They both are good friends

755
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:52,361
A long period of closeness!

756
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,066
Nithya is his life

757
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:58,229
For her too

758
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:00,072
Doctor

759
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,236
Hussain is ready for the treatment

760
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:04,777
Yeah coming

761
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:09,076
Oh

762
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:10,775
lam

763
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,546
Almost forgot

764
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:15,214
Didn't get hurt much!

765
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:19,260
Dogs can't know that you are a doctor!

766
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:22,758
Please join me in the
evening if you are free

767
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:28,361
Don't tell anyone

768
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,696
...Tell only me... Okay

769
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:32,404
Only me...

770
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:37,135
Sir, changes taking place are good

771
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:41,076
But be wary about few guys

772
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:42,673
By the way.

773
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:47,422
When I walk like this,
I see Heaven and Hell

774
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,292
Am I in Heaven or Hell now?

775
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:58,260
You are at the end of both

776
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,667
Don't doubt

777
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,402
Sister, take Nithya to the room

778
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:43,711
Come

779
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:39,866
Hello

780
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,668
She is my girl

781
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:08,923
You think I am all wrong, isn't it?

782
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:11,893
No Doctor,

783
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:14,291
Nothing like that

784
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:16,868
Handle carefully

785
01:26:26,448 --> 01:26:29,975
lam someone who took
pan in the '62 China War

786
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:36,716
A battalion burning down totally,
I had to stand watching

787
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:40,285
That day even I was to die

788
01:26:40,462 --> 01:26:45,229
But got rescued by an Assamese Sepoy

789
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:46,759
He is still with me

790
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,233
He is my guard now

791
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,499
Combat Neurosis

792
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:55,908
It's also called Shell shock

793
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:59,637
Many who have fought in a
War are affected by this!

794
01:27:00,015 --> 01:27:03,883
Something that can never
be erased from the mind!

795
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:06,016
A Mental Shock

796
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:09,789
Slowly it turns into Neurosis

797
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,624
Unwanted thoughts got to
be taken out from the mind

798
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:19,757
It was on this Guard, my first Experiment!

799
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:22,733
And it was a success

800
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:24,969
He is my living proof

801
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,540
That man is ready to do
anything for me now!

802
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:34,475
Even a Murder

803
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,745
Without any guilt

804
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:43,257
What actually happened to Nithya?

805
01:27:47,329 --> 01:27:49,423
Its

806
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:53,864
Do you believe she did that?

807
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,574
I don't know anything about the killings

808
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:04,443
Then why have you been, all these while

809
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:07,081
torturing Nithya under the
pretext of treatment?

810
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:18,085
I have an uninvited guest

811
01:28:19,361 --> 01:28:20,055
A Fox

812
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,323
I hate uninvited guest, Doctor

813
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:26,633
Can I also join?

814
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:34,967
Sheep don't hunt

815
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,343
They are to be hunted

816
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,612
You finish, your poison

817
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,551
Come on Jack

818
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:39,534
Hussain,

819
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,771
You left this in my room!

820
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,879
You don't speak, isn't it?

821
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:15,535
"Like the seventh colour of yonder rainbow“

822
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:20,908
"A magical beauty on your soft cheeks"

823
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:26,512
"Today in my path, your tender footsteps"

824
01:31:26,715 --> 01:31:31,778
"In your musical notes,
this silence is eloquent"

825
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:37,050
"The earth and the sky
echo the twilight tunes"

826
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:42,923
"And the witnessing black
clouds give blessings"

827
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:53,073
"0 coral rain, will you shower"

828
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,537
"Will you veil her today"

829
01:31:55,744 --> 01:32:00,773
"She is a white full moon
in her beautiful flower-like rays"

830
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:06,182
"I stood waiting to see
the stars scattered by my dreams"

831
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:11,784
"Like the seventh colour of yonder rainbow“

832
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:17,056
"A magical beauty on your soft cheeks"

833
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:48,990
"Searching for your soul,
unsearched by anyone"

834
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:54,200
"Embracing desires unseen by anyone"

835
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:59,999
<i>"I'll</i> come as a shadow wherever you go"

836
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:04,645
"We'll spread our wings
and go searching for shores"

837
01:33:04,846 --> 01:33:09,977
"Will you give consent with a sweet smile"

838
01:33:10,185 --> 01:33:15,680
"Will you come as my mate,
removing the railings of your heart"

839
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:21,054
"When we join together
today in the boat of time"

840
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:26,961
"A thousand enchantments
spread their wings allover me"

841
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:44,676
"She is a white full moon
in her beautiful flower-like rays"

842
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:50,086
"I stood waiting to see
the stars scattered by my dreams"

843
01:34:14,883 --> 01:34:16,317
This is all your fault

844
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:18,309
You should have finished him then

845
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,354
Are you scared of him?

846
01:34:23,091 --> 01:34:24,081
What a shame!

847
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:26,160
How dare he hit me!

848
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:28,886
Can you do anything or not?

849
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,228
Yes

850
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:50,815
"The brighter the light,
The darker the shadow“

851
01:35:00,762 --> 01:35:03,026
21

852
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:04,763
21?

853
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:16,169
What is this 21?

854
01:36:02,357 --> 01:36:05,918
Dad..Dad..

855
01:36:08,563 --> 01:36:10,031
Who else do you remember?

856
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:20,435
Achu Aunty..Achu Aunty

857
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:27,414
Who is Achu Aunty?

858
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:35,787
Vinayan..

859
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:37,887
Who?

860
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:43,057
Vinayan

861
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:45,956
Haven't I told you several times..

862
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,430
Not to fight like this

863
01:36:48,036 --> 01:36:51,165
What was the need to pull her hair?

864
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:54,364
I am fed up convincing people

865
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:55,098
This guy..

866
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:56,844
Should not be spoken to...

867
01:36:57,045 --> 01:36:57,910
Lock him in doors

868
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,943
Wayward !

869
01:36:59,180 --> 01:36:59,908
Move

870
01:37:00,114 --> 01:37:02,139
Move you, Useless!

871
01:37:02,884 --> 01:37:03,407
<i>Wham!</i>

872
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:07,445
Showing the same behaviour as his dead dad!

873
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:08,850
Lousy!

874
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:25,504
Girl, leave me

875
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:26,339
Leave!

876
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:29,601
Leave me

877
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:40,885
Come on...

878
01:37:45,126 --> 01:37:45,957
Stay there

879
01:37:58,573 --> 01:37:59,472
Where is dad?

880
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,199
As many as the dreams and desires we have,

881
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:27,628
That many are the eyelashes we have..

882
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:32,169
So when you intensely desire something

883
01:38:32,974 --> 01:38:34,464
An eyelash just falls

884
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:37,042
Then what you do, dear?

885
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:41,673
You take that eyelash, hide it in your palm

886
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:44,017
Without exposing the sky

887
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:45,242
Come straight to dad

888
01:38:46,154 --> 01:38:47,451
Then dad will take it from you

889
01:38:47,989 --> 01:38:50,253
And fulfil your desire!

890
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:32,084
Now release him

891
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:35,760
Let the credit of killing Thamburan be his

892
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,285
NithyauNithya

893
01:41:29,317 --> 01:41:29,806
Come

894
01:41:40,628 --> 01:41:43,188
Everything you see around
you is all fake, Nithya

895
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:47,832
Benjamin is not your dad

896
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:50,493
He is no one to you

897
01:41:53,374 --> 01:41:55,706
Many truths have been hidden from you

898
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:02,579
This ain't the place for you to live

899
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:15,725
I will take you from here

900
01:43:10,317 --> 01:43:11,307
Just forget that

901
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:13,653
Didn't you attempt that once?

902
01:43:13,988 --> 01:43:15,649
She needs her Papa

903
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:16,913
Papa!

904
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:20,754
Listen carefully to what I say

905
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:23,490
I will take Nithya

906
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:27,928
Now

907
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:30,265
Listen carefully to what I say

908
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:33,966
Never make promises

909
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:36,269
that you cannot keep

910
01:43:37,778 --> 01:43:38,506
Got it!

911
01:43:39,613 --> 01:43:41,775
Doctor, Please come upstairs quickly

912
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:51,390
Jeevan, leave her

913
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:52,786
Don't come closer

914
01:43:53,027 --> 01:43:53,755
- Don't come close.
- I say leave her

915
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:54,586
I Will kill her

916
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:56,388
No one will do anything to you, Jeevan

917
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:58,623
Son, don't do any blunders!

918
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:01,564
Is it for this you took the knife from me?

919
01:44:01,769 --> 01:44:03,032
Don't come closer, I will kill her

920
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:03,802
Kill, Would you?

921
01:44:04,038 --> 01:44:04,834
If you can, go ahead. Do it!

922
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:05,470
Kill her

923
01:44:05,706 --> 01:44:06,468
Renuka...

924
01:44:08,509 --> 01:44:09,806
Out..out..

925
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:13,740
Don't come closer...Don't

926
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:14,573
Sir...

927
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:18,475
Didn't I say, don't come close?

928
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,016
Don't come closer...

929
01:44:25,326 --> 01:44:26,987
What do you need? I will give you

930
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:28,260
I want her

931
01:44:28,529 --> 01:44:29,519
She is mine

932
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:31,021
...mine only

933

I cannot leave her any more

934
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:34,328
You...

935
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:38,369
If she doesn't want you...

936
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:52,280
You..Don't you ever..ever do this

937
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:55,385
What are you doing?
He is a Patient and You are a Doctor

938
01:44:55,723 --> 01:44:56,656
Will you stop?

939
01:44:57,324 --> 01:44:59,816
- Nithya..is mine..
- Take him away

940
01:45:00,094 --> 01:45:02,688
Benjamin, don't give her away

941
01:45:02,897 --> 01:45:03,989
I will not let go of her...l won't

942
01:45:04,365 --> 01:45:04,957
Shut up

943
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:07,294
I will not let go her

944
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:08,627
She is mine only

945
01:45:08,836 --> 01:45:10,326
Shall not let go her

946
01:45:10,538 --> 01:45:11,505
Shall not let go..

947
01:45:11,739 --> 01:45:12,638
She is mine

948
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,864
Only mine

949
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:15,542
I won't.

950
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:17,844
Hey, This...

951
01:45:18,746 --> 01:45:20,714
...is my Hospital

952
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:22,047
And that.

953
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,709
...Is my patient

954
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:27,909
Can we leave?

955
01:47:22,002 --> 01:47:22,696
Nithya..

956
01:47:28,676 --> 01:47:29,507
Nithya..

957
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:20,049
Doctor

958
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,557
Did you see Nithya?

959
01:48:22,029 --> 01:48:23,258
She is not around

960
01:48:24,031 --> 01:48:25,499
Do you know where she is?

961
01:48:26,834 --> 01:48:28,302
So you know where she is

962
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:29,632
Where is she, Doctor?

963
01:48:30,571 --> 01:48:31,060
Nithya..

964
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:37,199
Doctor"

965
01:49:19,686 --> 01:49:20,346
Where is Nithya?

966
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:23,790
I am asking you, where is Nithya?

967
01:49:24,825 --> 01:49:25,986
She is not around

968
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:29,853
Didn't I tell you to rescue her from here?

969
01:49:30,097 --> 01:49:31,030
Didn't I?

970
01:50:06,934 --> 01:50:07,696
Renuka..

971
01:50:12,406 --> 01:50:13,202
Where is Nithya?

972
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:16,641
Doctor, if you are done here, you may leave

973
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:18,640
Here there are only 5 Patients

974
01:50:18,846 --> 01:50:19,278
And among them Nithya...

975
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,647
Where is Nithya?

976
01:50:49,076 --> 01:50:49,770
Sir

977
01:50:50,444 --> 01:50:51,240
Its ready

978
01:51:11,732 --> 01:51:15,168
"Schadenfreude - the emotion
of pleasure in other's misfortune"

979
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:43,985
Doctor

980
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:47,488
Didn't I tell you to leave this place?

981
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:51,757
Those people shut up in that box

982
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:54,026
Have not seen the outside world!

983
01:52:55,302 --> 01:52:58,203
Death is certain

984
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:03,102
Ours is some unwanted lives,

985
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,537
The feeling of belonging came up

986
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:07,402
Only after seeing Nithya,

987
01:53:08,248 --> 01:53:10,182
There is nobody to come enquiring about us

988
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:14,380
But Nithya dear, shouldn't face that plight

989
01:53:15,255 --> 01:53:17,587
Doctor, somehow got to trace her

990
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:20,188
Lord, free me from the hands of my enemies

991
01:53:20,394 --> 01:53:23,022
Lord, take me back from
the hands of savages

992
01:53:24,164 --> 01:53:26,292
Oh Jesus, protect us

993
01:53:35,542 --> 01:53:36,373
Doctor

994
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:39,805
Come

995
01:54:16,516 --> 01:54:17,347
Hey Man

996
01:54:18,885 --> 01:54:19,852
Not that way

997
01:54:21,254 --> 01:54:22,187
I am here

998
01:54:22,556 --> 01:54:23,284
Come on

999
01:54:24,124 --> 01:54:24,522
Come

1000
01:54:35,302 --> 01:54:35,928
Mad am,

1001
01:54:36,269 --> 01:54:37,930
Are you going to put down Nithya?

1002
01:54:38,605 --> 01:54:39,868
Burn all these

1003
01:54:40,107 --> 01:54:40,437
Rig ht away

1004
01:54:45,445 --> 01:54:47,277
Oh!! What is this!

1005
01:54:49,116 --> 01:54:50,515
Do what is told to you..

1006
01:55:03,597 --> 01:55:04,257
What?

1007
01:55:05,465 --> 01:55:06,125
Kamala!

1008
01:55:08,168 --> 01:55:09,135
No..No

1009
01:55:09,336 --> 01:55:10,895
Kamala, don't lock

1010
01:55:11,171 --> 01:55:11,899
Kamala..

1011
01:55:13,106 --> 01:55:13,538
You!

1012
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,105
What the hell are you doing?

1013
01:55:15,609 --> 01:55:17,976
Kamala..Open

1014
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:22,242
Come Doctor, up

1015
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:30,083
Hey"

1016
01:55:31,191 --> 01:55:32,681
Trust the Shadow

1017
01:55:34,161 --> 01:55:35,560
Only the Shadow

1018
01:55:36,463 --> 01:55:39,057
Look into your shadow

1019
01:55:40,567 --> 01:55:42,194
"Schadenfreude"

1020
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:44,536
Go

1021
01:57:17,531 --> 01:57:18,498
Wake up, Doctor

1022
01:57:20,867 --> 01:57:22,562
It was all your fault

1023
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:24,637
You had a choice

1024
01:57:25,272 --> 01:57:26,239
To leave the place

1025
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:29,371
But you..

1026
01:57:35,348 --> 01:57:37,817
There are other patients too here

1027
01:57:39,252 --> 01:57:40,742
Why only Nithya?

1028
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:43,851
She is my treasure

1029
01:57:45,292 --> 01:57:46,157


1030
01:57:47,827 --> 01:57:49,795
Little Princess!

1031
01:57:55,468 --> 01:57:59,098
If it had not been her you wanted"

1032
01:57:59,339 --> 01:58:00,272
I would've given you

1033
01:58:01,308 --> 01:58:02,275
Happily

1034
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:05,674
You are not listening to me, Doctor

1035
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:12,846
She is gone..

1036
01:58:14,688 --> 01:58:15,280
Gone

1037
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:21,784
I built all this for her

1038
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:29,602
You think that I am Insane, don't you?

1039
01:58:31,838 --> 01:58:33,328
No

1040
01:58:34,641 --> 01:58:35,574
I am different

1041
01:58:36,509 --> 01:58:40,810
Insanity is my favourite sin

1042
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:45,851
I shall free you from
the burden of memories

1043
01:58:48,688 --> 01:58:52,852
It's a Wonderful experience

1044
01:58:56,162 --> 01:58:56,628
One

1045
01:59:03,336 --> 01:59:03,928

1048
02:02:01,114 --> 02:02:01,876
Where is the doctor?

1049
02:02:03,583 --> 02:02:06,348

Head of Psychiatry, Medical

This is the last time I
am going to tell you

1068
02:03:14,187 --> 02:03:14,915
Put it in this

1069
02:03:17,857 --> 02:03:19,621
One man impersonating me came here

1070
02:03:19,926 --> 02:03:22,588
and took away the girl
named Nithya, isn't it?

1071
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:23,855
Crazy!

1072
02:03:25,164 --> 02:03:26,029
Now tell me

1073
02:03:26,532 --> 02:03:27,863
If you know the person who had come...

1074
02:03:28,067 --> 02:03:30,399
Do you have any id or photo?

1075
02:03:30,603 --> 02:03:31,434
Anything--

1076
02:03:31,704 --> 02:03:32,796
Some clue

1077
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:38,538
Sir, can you come with me?

1078
02:03:39,245 --> 02:03:39,837
Sure

1079
02:04:32,865 --> 02:04:33,855
Why did you bring me here?

1080
02:04:34,233 --> 02:04:34,961
Sir...

1081
02:05:26,219 --> 02:05:26,319
Vinayan?

1082
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:27,252
Vinayan?

1083
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:28,651
Vinayan

1084
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:34,151
5 days back, he escaped from
Medical College Psychiatry Cell Ward.

1085
02:05:34,327 --> 02:05:35,260
Patient

1086
02:05:37,997 --> 02:05:41,023
To say it in local parlance,
Nithya's cousin and fiance

1087
02:05:41,734 --> 02:05:42,701
That is...

1088
02:05:42,902 --> 02:05:47,169
Nithya's Dad Jayanarayana Varma's
Sister Lakshmi's son

1089
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:50,039
Is this Vinayan!

1090
02:05:51,344 --> 02:05:52,038
Sir

1091
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:55,237
Here is his box, his Hat, his Coat

1092
02:05:55,615 --> 02:05:56,878
His recorder too

1093
02:05:57,083 --> 02:05:58,710
I suspected him then itself

1094
02:05:58,918 --> 02:05:59,544
That he is up to mischief!

1095
02:05:59,952 --> 02:06:01,147
These are mine

1096
02:06:01,821 --> 02:06:03,346
Don't you guys have the habit of
reading newspaper here?

1097
02:06:04,057 --> 02:06:06,822
It had appeared in all the
newspaper in big fonts!

1098
02:06:11,898 --> 02:06:13,798
"NADAKKAL MURDER CASE ACCUSED
ESCAPES FROM MENTAL HOSPITAL..."

1099
02:06:14,767 --> 02:06:16,235
Come on guys, give me a break

1100
02:06:17,336 --> 02:06:19,168
He had delusions

1101
02:06:22,075 --> 02:06:23,133
Hallucinations

1102
02:06:30,216 --> 02:06:31,240
Paranoia

1103
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:34,144
Agitation

1104
02:06:39,926 --> 02:06:41,121
Seeing things that did not exist

1105
02:06:42,228 --> 02:06:45,027
Huns himself, creates wounds on ownself

1106
02:06:45,198 --> 02:06:46,063
Why all that...

1107
02:06:46,899 --> 02:06:50,096
His dead mother Lakshmi speaking with her

1108
02:06:50,403 --> 02:06:51,700
Oh no!

1109
02:06:58,444 --> 02:07:01,778
It was a clear case of Schizophrenia

1110
02:07:06,419 --> 02:07:09,116
And you, being a Doctor

1111
02:07:09,355 --> 02:07:11,881
After seeing a person with so many symptoms

1112
02:07:12,091 --> 02:07:14,822
You failed to diagnose that he was mad!

1113
02:07:17,163 --> 02:07:18,824
A London Degree from the white man's land

1114
02:07:19,098 --> 02:07:20,224
Army Medal

1115
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:22,299
As if that is not enough,
Grandma's Hypnotism!

1116
02:07:24,103 --> 02:07:25,867
But Sir, that man seemed to be quite normal

1117
02:07:26,072 --> 02:07:26,971
He mastered it

1118
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,733
While under treatment too,

1119
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:31,706
He seemed really normal to many

1120
02:07:36,849 --> 02:07:40,149
Excuse me Mr. Kannan Nair,

1121
02:07:41,154 --> 02:07:43,816
Patient is a Doctor's responsibility

1122
02:07:44,924 --> 02:07:46,790
Your irresponsibility

1123
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:49,091
Don't place it on my head

1124
02:07:49,262 --> 02:07:50,093
Hello

1125
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:53,729
In case if anything
happens to that Princess

1126
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,262
You can neither claim her guardianship

1127
02:07:56,936 --> 02:07:59,371
Nor any right over the properties
of the Kovilakkom

1128
02:07:59,839 --> 02:08:03,173
This Palace which you are enjoying
living in now, 500 acres of land,

1129
02:08:03,376 --> 02:08:05,105
Movable and immovable properties,

1130
02:08:05,311 --> 02:08:07,780
Your Pets and including your Wheel chair,

1131
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:09,277
You will have to surrender all
this to the Government

1132
02:08:09,749 --> 02:08:11,148
And move back to Goa

1133
02:08:11,984 --> 02:08:13,281
<i>Hope you understand the seriousness</i>
of <i>this case!</i>

1134
02:08:13,753 --> 02:08:15,414
Nithya is gone along with a murderer

1135
02:08:16,923 --> 02:08:17,913
Murderer?

1136
02:08:18,291 --> 02:08:19,087
Not one...

1137
02:08:19,258 --> 02:08:20,054
But four!

1138
02:08:20,293 --> 02:08:22,227
All the heirs to the Kovilakam properties

1139
02:08:22,762 --> 02:08:23,820
Without letting a drop of blood spill

1140
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:25,088
He is dangerous

1141
02:08:26,032 --> 02:08:28,091
Not allowing anyone to come between
Nitya and him.

1142
02:08:43,015 --> 02:08:46,280
Let him have the credit
of killing Thamburan!

1143
02:09:11,877 --> 02:09:13,242
Hey get away!

1144
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:37,981
Dead end! Haven't got any clue!

1145
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:40,386
We will... We will definitely get

1146
02:11:42,495 --> 02:11:46,022
No one knows him better than me

1147
02:12:14,627 --> 02:12:16,652
He wasn't meant to be limited
in that name

1148
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:19,689
To be a partner in loneliness...

1149
02:12:23,202 --> 02:12:25,000
To add hues to memories

1150
02:12:29,642 --> 02:12:31,406
to share imaginations

1151
02:12:39,218 --> 02:12:41,448
...to be the never ending love

1152
02:12:57,703 --> 02:13:00,001
...to be the word - MINE

1153
02:13:00,739 --> 02:13:02,468
The him she got as a boon

1154
02:13:03,008 --> 02:13:04,169
With what name to address?

1155
02:13:18,657 --> 02:13:20,250
For her...someone who is everything

1156
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:27,428
He... Athiran (Limitless)

1157
02:13:37,643 --> 02:13:39,805
Vinaya..You keep running

1158
02:13:40,646 --> 02:13:43,138
Whatever limits you keep crossing
