1
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:16,331
Lord, You have bestowed infinite
mercy upon our family

2
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,862
I am honoured and respected
in the whole of Punjab

3
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:27,243
You have given me immense wealth.
I thank you a million times

4
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:34,819
Despite having everything, just
one shortcoming eats me up

5
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,291
It's been ten years. These walls..

6
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,918
have been pining to hear
my grandson prattle

7
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,826
Have I been short in my prayers..?

8
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:53,939
For, You have left my
daughter-in-law barren

9
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:59,837
Dad, may your sons live long. You
have two more sons. Deep and Jehli

10
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,107
Avtar!

11
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,245
Don't you mention Jehli!
He's dead for me

12
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:11,390
All my hopes are now pinned
on my youngest son

13
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:17,793
The moment he flies down from
London, I shall get him married..

14
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,990
and bring his bride home

15
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:26,300
Those who are dead for me..
do not mention them again

16
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,471
Daddy, please don't
say that about Jehli

17
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,237
You have already thrown him out

18
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,881
Please don't kill him

19
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,114
He ought to be shot

20
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:47,151
He snubbed my principles and
tried to stand up against me

21
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,397
He cares for others
more than his father

22
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:56,056
He has disgraced me

23
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:03,970
Hello?
- Sat Sri Akal, daddy

24
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:06,005
Who..? Deep?

25
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:09,478
Bless you. Are you calling
from London?

26
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,175
No dad, I have reached Delhi

27
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:15,048
Really? Reached Delhi? When
are you coming to Chandigarh?

28
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,883
In two hours, dad

29
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,492
All right, son.
- Okay dad. My respects

30
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:24,463
Lord has answered my prayers.
Deep is coming

31
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,397
I'll get him married. And
I'll never let him go away

32
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,955
I've travelled all over the world

33
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:56,963
I've travelled all over the world

34
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,430
But there's no land
as amusing as Punjab

35
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,536
I've travelled all over the world

36
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,229
But there's no land
as amusing as Punjab

37
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,896
I wish for youth to pass merrily,

38
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,239
I desire a lover as pure as wine

39
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,903
I wish for youth to pass merrily,

40
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,644
I desire a lover as pure as wine

41
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,977
I've travelled all over the world

42
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:56,519
Her eyes are a weighty
proposition,

43
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,559
as she sways her alluring
waist to rock the world..

44
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:03,027
with the honour of many
men on her shoulders

45
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,666
God, what's a corn field for?

46
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,532
To date a girl just out
of her innocence..

47
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,979
To date a girl just out
of her innocence..

48
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:23,381
there's no safe place like
the tall sugarcane fields

49
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:25,986
I wish for youth to pass merrily,

50
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:29,421
I desire a lover as pure as wine

51
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:33,085
I wish for youth to pass merrily,

52
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,595
I desire a lover as pure as wine

53
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:39,030
I've travelled all over the world

54
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:08,456
Warriors revel in their
daily exercise,

55
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:11,692
even today the lassies of
Punjab are modest as ever..

56
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,669
and people take the name
of God to begin their day

57
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:21,102
With joined hands they
seek for everyone

58
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,708
Even today swings adorn
the tress in the open

59
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:32,522
Even today swings adorn
the tress in the open

60
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:35,386
The attitude of the Jats
is royal even today

61
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:38,586
I wish for youth to pass merrily,

62
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:41,291
I desire a lover as pure as wine

63
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:44,197
I wish for youth to pass merrily,

64
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,671
I desire a lover as pure as wine

65
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:50,741
I've travelled all over the world

66
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:57,145
I've travelled all over the world

67
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:12,721
Ass, you are as stubborn as grease

68
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,090
I've told you! It's not
worth adding two tins

69
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:19,136
of water to a drum of oil

70
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:22,206
It's hard to digest, sonny.
- For you? Or for the people?

71
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:24,434
People can't digest it!
- Why not?

72
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:29,708
People die consuming pure liquor.
If we sell pure oil,

73
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:32,580
the vehicles will run fast and
accidents will happen every day

74
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:36,176
The quality control guys are
idiots.. they keep raiding us

75
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:37,813
When in fact we control speed

76
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:46,160
Damn you! Blind bat

77
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,494
You scrapped my bones

78
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:54,303
So strangely out of context!

79
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:59,606
Damn you, ass! Pick your boss up.
I'm down and you are raving

80
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,408

'

 help

81
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:07,213
You are picking up a man,
not a log of wood

82
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:11,685
Who's the driver who just
played blind man's buff?

83
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:14,726
Forgive me. My car stopped
six feet away from you,

84
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,194
it didn't even hit you

85
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,457
No, but what if it had hit me?
-We'd have had it

86
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,193
I'd have paid compensation

87
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:24,234
Compensation, what else?
- Come again

88
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,430
I'd have paid compensation.
- Why don't you pay then?

89
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:34,306
What's the loss, bro?
- What loss? Two drums hit me,

90
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,246
you scattered my stuff.. do you
want the details in writing?

91
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:39,580
His bones broke too.
- That's extra

92
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:42,656
The drum was full of water
and that's old furniture

93
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:48,228
What do you mean, old furniture?
It's antique, understand?

94
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,195
Damn, I'm trapped! Fine,
forgive me

95
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:53,235
and tell me the extent of the loss

96
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,234
We won't charge you more

97
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:58,265
975 bucks.
- 30..!

98
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,569
30,975 bucks!

99
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,239
30,975 !

100
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:06,279
Just pay up, else the amount
will rise to 130,975 bucks

101
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:10,278
Look, I've just come from England,
I don't have Indian currency

102
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:13,285
Never mind, I'll add up
the pounds. Out with it

103
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:15,285
I don't even have
the pounds. Yes..

104
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,414
how about Visa card?

105
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:19,450
Bomb..
- Yes?

106
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:23,530
Get the car keys.
- Your wish is my command, boss

107
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,359
How will I go home then? - I'll
organise a cab. Pay me later

108
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:31,304
You've broken my bones. It's
an accident, no jokes

109
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:33,839
A cab?
- You can pay me later

110
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:39,338
Bring the money, take the car

111
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,957
Daddy, have something. You
haven't eaten since morning

112
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,622
I'm hungry to see my son

113
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,964
Until he arrives, I
won't have anything

114
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:59,729
Greetings, sir. Mr Deep is here

115
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:03,566
Deep is here!
- Allow me, sir

116
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:08,268
Sat Sri Akal.
- Wait. Get the holy platter

117
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:10,504
Yes, ma'am.
- Quick

118
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:18,349
Why do you have to do all this?
- I'm giving you a welcome

119
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:20,317
I'm warding off the
evil eye, foreigner

120
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:23,288
You are like my mother. Touching
your feet is enough

121
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,725
to ward off the evil eye

122
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:27,522
You have to touch my feet,

123
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm your elder sister-in-law
after all. C'mon

124
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:32,660
Be happy

125
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,834
Brother!
- My kid brother

126
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:41,965
Sat Sri Akal, daddy.
- Bless you, son

127
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,371
Son, I won't let you go
back to London again

128
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:52,610
We have a vast business
here, take care of it

129
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,415
Get married and make a family

130
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,390
Give me a grandson

131
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:03,388
I'm pining to see him

132
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,396
I'm not alone in this house, dad.

133
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,830
There's Avtar, his
wife and Jehli..

134
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:12,405
Enough! Don't you mention
Jehli again, Deep

135
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:18,409
And don't try to meet him either

136
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:23,474
But dad..
- Deep, listen to me

137
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,676
But..

138
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:28,887
Come here.
- What's the matter, sis-in-law?

139
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,958
Deep, don't talk about
Jehli before daddy

140
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:37,430
It makes him lose his temper.
You'd rather not talk about Jehli

141
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:39,590
What's the matter? Why don't
I see brother Jehli around?

142
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:43,697
He doesn't live here anymore.
- Doesn't live here?

143
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:46,602
Then where is he?
- No idea

144
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:51,437
He walked out of the house.
- Walked out of the house?

145
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,476
But what had happened?

146
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:58,583
Forget it. Go and talk
to daddy. Go on

147
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:02,082
I'm sorry, I had no idea, dad

148
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:06,494
I'm also sorry, son. You
have come after years..

149
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:09,756
and took up the ominous chap's
name.. - Let's talk about it later

150
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:13,592
Okay. Tell me, how
was your journey?

151
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:18,098
You came home in a taxi? Didn't
Billa come to receive you?

152
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:20,873
He did. I sent him
away on some work

153
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,408
Then the car broke
down on the way,

154
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,571
and I left the car
at a scrap dealer

155
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:29,884
What are you saying? Get the car
at once. Scrap dealers are thieves

156
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,420
He might sell it off cheaply.
- All right,

157
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:33,717
I'll get it right now, dad

158
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,024
Sat Sri Akal.
- Sat Sri Akal

159
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:39,859
I haven't even dialed the number
yet.. - Over here. Sat Sri Akal

160
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:43,432
That's fine. If you want
adulterated petrol,

161
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,490
go to the next gas station

162
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,899
We sell pure stuff.
- I don't want petrol

163
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:51,768
Then? Potatoes?
- Give me my car keys

164
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:55,503
Car? What car are you talking
about? I don't even know you

165
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,443
Black Gypsy, four tyres, open top

166
00:13:57,513 --> 00:14:00,505
.. give me the keys.
I have no time

167
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,610
Black Gypsy, open top..? Oh yes

168
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:12,524
The car that had destroyed
all the stuff.. that car?

169
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:15,598
Money makes a mayor
out of a barber

170
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,527
Here you are. At least
now give me the keys

171
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:22,663
Take the keys tomorrow

172
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:26,004
Not tomorrow, right now

173
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:29,534
You can't get the car today.
I have no car

174
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:35,774
Where's my car?
- A girl was besotted by your car

175
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,547
The girl went to college and
she took the car along

176
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:41,556
The girl and car are studying
now. - Which means..

177
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:44,057
the girl took my car to college?
- Yes

178
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:48,564
My boss' daughter.
She took the car

179
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,157
What's the name?
- Name?

180
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:56,004
The name is Bomb.
They call me Bomb

181
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:59,574
Not your name, her name.
- Her name?

182
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,945
My boss' daughter.
Her name is Gulabo

183
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,173
Pinky in English

184
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,063
Looks like my car

185
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,896
Yes, it's mine. Come on

186
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:36,007
Excuse me, sir.. what
are you doing here?

187
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:41,015
Trying to start my car, what
else? - You are trying to steal it

188
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:43,047
Stop raving

189
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:47,757
Pinky.. look. Someone's
trying to steal your car

190
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:53,625
Look.. that's the owner of
the car. The Pinky Gang..

191
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:58,566
is the biggest gang in
Punjab. Last week..

192
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:00,763
it ripped apart a car thief

193
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,265
They really look deadly

194
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:13,874
Move it

195
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:18,143
Thief! Where to..?

196
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:20,084
Got away

197
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:25,590
You thought it's England.

198
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:27,893
Do you now realise how tough
Punjabi girls are?

199
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:31,660
Really bhabhi (Sister-in-law),
I ran for my life

200
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:36,672
Had I not run off, they'd
have smashed my bones

201
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,004
Tell me, why did you run off?

202
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:42,672
Had you stayed, the girl
might've fallen for you

203
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:46,716
Oh no, bhabhi. -Why? Is my
brother-in-law any less?

204
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:48,717
He's one in a million.
- Thank you

205
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:50,746
Yes daddy?

206
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:52,915
Yes, daddy

207
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,694
When you go to Fun
Republic tomorrow,

208
00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,697
give this file to
my lawyer Mr Saini

209
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:00,958
Yes, daddy.

210
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,665
It's wonderful.
- Isn't it fun?

211
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:07,901
Let's have a burger at McDonaIds.
- Bad choice, as usual

212
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,169
Let's have coins

213
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,676
Ever tasted coins?

214
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:14,745
A glass of coins please

215
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:17,943
Only one?

216
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,878
Hold it

217
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:25,258
Can I get a spoon?
- Here you are

218
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,825
Pinky, isn't that the guy who
tried to steal your car?

219
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,863
Hello, daddy? Mr Saini
is absent today

220
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:40,736
Come home. Mr Saini will come
and collect the document

221
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,001
Okay dad. Bye

222
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:45,142
It's him. Let's check him out

223
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,044
Quick

224
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,013
Police.. excuse me

225
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:57,750
Yes ma'am? - That guy has
stolen someone's car

226
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,885
Hurry

227
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,723
Sit down.

228
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:10,362
Don't you spare him

229
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,772
I won't

230
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,810
How does he know about Punjab?

231
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,941
I'll get him.
- Don't you try that stunt!

232
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:25,912
Stop!

233
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:40,198
So it's you! - Mr Car Thief,
that's an expensive car

234
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:44,897
How about talking to me?
- I haven't stolen any car, okay?

235
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,305
Be polite with me. -Will you
teach a cop how to behave?

236
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,345
Come with me to the police
station. - One second

237
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,108
Here's my licence

238
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:02,356
And the documents. Check
it. It's my car

239
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:08,018
It does look like yours.
- What are you doing?

240
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:12,792
It's a habit, I'm a cop.
It's truly his car

241
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,893
No, it's not his car. You
have no idea, he's a thief

242
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,801
Am I a thief? - He tried to
steal my jeep yesterday

243
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,836
So you are the Gypsy
girl. Back off

244
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:38,826
Documents. Check them out

245
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,858
This too is my jeep. Yesterday
I went to pick it up..

246
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:45,957
and a girl came to thrash
me with her gang

247
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,868
I had to run for my life

248
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,874
She dented my car. Pay
the compensation

249
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,004
How can I?

250
00:19:57,147 --> 00:20:00,116
What's going on? Let me see

251
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:01,843
Back off

252
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:05,149
It's Pinky.
- What are you doing here?

253
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,381
What's the matter? Don't
worry, I'm here

254
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:11,886
It's you! - Brother, he
says I dented his car

255
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:14,395
Don't worry. Whose car it is?
- Mine

256
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:16,467
Whose car rammed into it?
- Mine

257
00:20:16,568 --> 00:20:20,368
Then how did she dent your car?
Aren't you ashamed to accuse a girl?

258
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:23,201
What's your intention?
Constable, ask him

259
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,443
You are right, gentleman

260
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,913
When the cars rammed into each
other, why should she pay up?

261
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:34,509
Because she was driving
the Gypsy. - That's right

262
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:39,916
Why didn't I think of it before?
Well girl, it's an offence

263
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:42,188
Constable, give it a good thought.

264
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:46,530
We'll also think about
it. Come with me

265
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:52,970
Where did they go?
- Well done. You are useless

266
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,168
Pinky, let's go for a movie.
- No

267
00:20:57,545 --> 00:20:59,569
Let's go there

268
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:03,014
Let's check things out here

269
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:08,150
Look, this is beautiful.
- Crap

270
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:12,456
This one?
- No. Find something good

271
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:16,119
This is nice

272
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:23,370
What have you done?
- Sorry

273
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,301
What sorry? It was an antique
piece? Out with 10,000 bucks

274
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:31,100
I didn't do it deliberately.
-You might have

275
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:34,975
Whether you did it deliberately
or not, out with 10,000

276
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,507
Where do I get it from?
Please forgive me, sir

277
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:41,382
You don't have the money?
Call up the police

278
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:47,525
Here's your money. Why are
you frightening the girls?

279
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:50,062
I'm not frightening them. I've
got the money, it's fine

280
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,999
Would you take money to
scoot now? Go! - Okay

281
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,543
I'm sorry. I'm ashamed,
please forgive me

282
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,412
What for?
- I was wrong about you

283
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:10,015
In fact, it was a misunderstanding

284
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:14,449
Sometimes, misunderstandings
forge unbreakable relationships

285
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:20,490
Please tell me you have forgiven
me. It's a load on my chest

286
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:24,029
You are forcing yourself
into my heart

287
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:27,965
If not for you, I wouldn't have
been able to pay him off.

288
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,091
I'm a poor girl

289
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:31,068
Not poor, you are very rich

290
00:22:31,303 --> 00:22:33,567
How come?
- Your eyes are worth millions

291
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,002
Your heart is worth billions.

292
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,100
Anyone would give up his
life for your smile

293
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:59,053
Hey lad..

294
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:10,407
Hey lad..

295
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:19,084
Hey lad..

296
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,085
Hey lad..

297
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:24,089
let me pour out my feelings today

298
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:28,252
Youth is tormenting,
take me in your arms

299
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:33,232
Youth is tormenting,
take me in your arms

300
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,238
Hey lassie..

301
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:56,121
Hey lassie..

302
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,591
Hey lassie..

303
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,320
give in to me

304
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:04,555
The entire village is revelling,
you will be honoured

305
00:24:04,732 --> 00:24:10,136
The entire village is revelling,
you will be honoured

306
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:55,307
Listen to me lad..

307
00:24:55,383 --> 00:24:58,181
Listen to me lad..

308
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,316
Listen to me lad..

309
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:09,194
Listen to me lad..

310
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,198
my heart's pining.. don't eye..

311
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,562
my alluring waist

312
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,330
don't eye..

313
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:20,440
my alluring waist

314
00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:30,246
Look! It's so beautiful

315
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:33,686
Deep!

316
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,482
Help!

317
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:39,792
Somebody help!

318
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:41,487
Help!

319
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:42,687
Somebody help!

320
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:35,405
Are you all right?

321
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:43,280
Brother Jehli, I've been waiting
for you. Let's go home

322
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:57,299
Who was that man?
- My elder brother. Jehli

323
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:02,296
Why did he go away?
- That's what I want to find out

324
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:06,739
Deep, where are you
taking me? Tell me

325
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:09,872
What is it, Deep?

326
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:16,318
Please.. promise me, bhabhi

327
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:19,318
What is it, Deep?
- Bhabhi,

328
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:24,828
every time I asked you about
Jehli, you've avoided me

329
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:30,301
Now, before God, tell me why
is Jehli upset with us?

330
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,437
Deep, you are like my kid brother

331
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:38,936
Don't ask me, don't compel me

332
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:43,338
What's the constraint, bhabhi?
- I..

333
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:48,680
I have promised your brother.
I can't tell you

334
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,784
You call me your kid brother

335
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,826
Then again, you hide such
an important matter from me

336
00:27:58,863 --> 00:27:59,955
Bhabhi,

337
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,734
I implore you in the name of God

338
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:16,505
Lord,

339
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,340
in Your court,

340
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:26,379
how can I hide the truth
from my kid brother?

341
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:33,891
I have to break my promise

342
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,796
It happened..

343
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:44,633
when there was a fair in our mill

344
00:28:56,654 --> 00:29:01,990
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

345
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:07,827
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

346
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:11,366
Swaying, your braid swirls
around your hips..

347
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:13,959
I can't take that attitude

348
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:19,542
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

349
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:25,671
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

350
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,461
You are a serpent's venom

351
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:52,539
You are a raging noon of summer

352
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:57,742
You are a serpent's venom

353
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:01,978
You are a raging noon of summer

354
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:09,451
Your beauty is so deadly, lassie,
no one dare touch you

355
00:30:09,594 --> 00:30:15,499
Your beauty is so deadly, lassie,
no one dare touch you

356
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:18,431
Swaying, your braid swirls
around your hips..

357
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:21,097
I can't take that attitude

358
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:27,001
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

359
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:32,883
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

360
00:30:56,543 --> 00:30:59,171
I have a crush! I want to say..

361
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:05,146
I want to meet you, baby,
alone some day

362
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:10,719
I have a crush! I want to say..

363
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:15,693
I want to meet you, baby,
alone some day

364
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:20,055
My heart has fallen for you,

365
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,533
My heart has fallen for you,

366
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,605
My heart has fallen for you,

367
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,607
I'm dying

368
00:31:29,177 --> 00:31:31,577
My heart has fallen for you,

369
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:34,580
I'm dying

370
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:38,516
Swaying, your braid swirls
around your hips..

371
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:40,554
I can't take that attitude

372
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:45,956
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

373
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:51,760
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

374
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:57,664
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

375
00:31:57,873 --> 00:31:59,636
I'll sing the rhymes,..

376
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:02,604
I'll sing the rhymes,..

377
00:32:03,812 --> 00:32:09,614
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

378
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:16,256
I'll sing the rhymes,
you dance for me

379
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:23,894
Today you disgraced me
in front of everyone

380
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:26,995
Didn't you even spare a thought?

381
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,972
Others were also dancing, daddy.
So what if I danced?

382
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:36,635
So what? I was embarrassed
to death

383
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:39,610
I'm just a driver in the mill

384
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:45,019
When you were dancing, people
were laughing at me..

385
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:49,785
I felt knives cutting through
me. What'd you know?

386
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:54,593
When the daughter's veil
slips off her head..

387
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:56,996
it's her father who
loses his honour

388
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,764
Who can explain you that? You
don't even have your mother

389
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,201
Don't say that, daddy

390
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:09,006
I understand that, but I
didn't dance deliberately

391
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,045
It was the music,

392
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,653
the magic of Jehli's song..

393
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,751
I didn't even realise when
my legs started moving

394
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,828
I had no ill intentions, father.
I'm your daughter

395
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,224
You trust me, don't you?

396
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:36,736
I do. I trust you as I trust God

397
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:38,932
As I trust God

398
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,763
Jehli.. at this hour? Is
everything all right?

399
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:41,734
I couldn't sleep..

400
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:46,772
What's wrong?
- I think it's happened to him

401
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,071
The thing that happens
at this age. - Meaning?

402
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,180
Love.
- Love?

403
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,179
In love, one doesn't stand on the
roof at this hour of the night

404
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,249
I see. Have you forgotten
those days

405
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,786
when you hovered around my house?

406
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:02,119
We were engaged then. He's in love

407
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:07,726
He needs a doctor. - Only the
lady doctor can cure him..

408
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:09,765
who has given him this ailment

409
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:13,770
Avtar..
- Yes dad?

410
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:16,032
Have we received payment
from Mumbai? - Yes dad

411
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:21,036
Jehli..

412
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:25,406
Jehli!
- Yes dad?

413
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,819
Of late, your mind is
wandering, I guess

414
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:31,853
Nothing of that sort, dad.
- Concentrate on your work, son

415
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,082
Sure

416
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:40,321
I'm going out on some work.
Mr Sharma will be coming here

417
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:44,832
Take 200,000 from him. Count
the money properly

418
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:47,802
The punk is repaying after
five years. - Okay dad

419
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:58,812
Sat Sri Akal, Jehli

420
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,775
Sharma?
- Yes

421
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:01,907
Sit

422
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:06,087
God! Dad left some money for you

423
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:08,854
Hang on

424
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,828
Count it. 200,000

425
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,398
Jehli, did dad tell you to take
the money or give it to him?

426
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:23,061
It's the money that
was almost lost

427
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:26,865
Sharma, you should be
ashamed of doing this

428
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,944
He didn't ask for the money, or
I'd have given it. Here's your money

429
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,877
Jehli, your bhabhi was right

430
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:41,888
Only that girl can cure
you of your madness

431
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:47,018
Unless she comes into your
life, you won't change

432
00:37:23,098 --> 00:37:25,122
Bhabhi!

433
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:28,195
Please do something for me.
- Why are you panting?

434
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:31,102
Please do this for me..
- Help me meet that girl

435
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,934
That's what I came to tell you

436
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,867
Come, let me take you there,

437
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:37,933
where everyone's wish
is granted. Hop in

438
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:43,911
Bingo! Let's go

439
00:37:56,963 --> 00:38:01,161
Jehli, the tenth Guru, Guru
Gobind Singh had visited this place

440
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:07,536
He said, God answers the prayers
of those who pray with faith

441
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,070
God, help me meet my Beeba

442
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,983
Take care, sir.
- May God grant you your wish, son

443
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,997
Bhabhi, I saw Beeba.
I've got my wish

444
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:47,144
I'll go and meet her. I'm off.
- Come on. God granted your wish

445
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:51,215
Won't you thank him? Come and
offer your prayers. C'mon

446
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:59,488
God is the only Truth

447
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,021
Lord, whoever seeks
of You, is given

448
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:07,064
I have seen it with
my own eyes today

449
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:12,130
You are the Maker, nothing
is in the hands of man

450
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:25,012
Shop will be closed for a week..?

451
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:40,030
Beeba's Flowers

452
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:03,282
Sir, it's amazing. You nabbed
the vandal easily

453
00:40:03,422 --> 00:40:04,582
Shut up!

454
00:40:05,557 --> 00:40:10,085
Bloody ass! You are maligning
the Punjab Police

455
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:13,456
Have we ever nabbed a criminal
easily? - Never

456
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,133
You are supposed to
tell everyone that

457
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:18,033
the criminal first
broke the glass..

458
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:19,627
and climbed the wall
up to the roof

459
00:40:20,305 --> 00:40:24,105
and then jumped straight
into the well

460
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:27,345
And we thrashed him
out of the well!

461
00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:30,138
- Sir, here's the
owner of the shop

462
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:34,379
The guy who vandalised your
shop has been arrested, lady

463
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:39,155
He tried to escape, but you
know the Punjab police

464
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:42,286
Get the criminal here.
- Right away

465
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:48,696
You..?

466
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:51,727
Two eyewitnesses have
confirmed that he's

467
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:53,735
the one who vandalised your shop

468
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:57,136
Tell us what you hold against her

469
00:40:57,273 --> 00:41:00,106
He has nothing against me.
Let him go, officer

470
00:41:00,243 --> 00:41:05,146
You are kidding. Arrest
him, release him!

471
00:41:05,282 --> 00:41:08,445
If we start letting criminals go,
what happens to the police force?

472
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:12,112
I withdraw my complaint.
He's a gentleman

473
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:15,190
Officer, he is a good singer

474
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:17,225
Really? He sings too?

475
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:20,252
How about singing
a few lines for us?

476
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:25,164
Amuse us. Get the guitar

477
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:26,429
Here it is

478
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:34,176
Few lines? I'm willing
to sing an entire song

479
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:36,335
But only if she'd understand

480
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:38,208
I'm pining to hear you

481
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:43,574
I'll understand. Just sing

482
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:51,192
When someone invaded my breath,

483
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,227
when the serpent of love stung me,

484
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,196
When someone invaded my breath,

485
00:42:03,472 --> 00:42:07,203
when the serpent of love stung me,

486
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:11,235
when the venom entered my bones,

487
00:42:11,814 --> 00:42:19,220
when my heart challenged
the world,

488
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:24,217
I never realised..

489
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,489
when I fell in love..

490
00:42:27,397 --> 00:42:31,230
I never realised..

491
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:34,700
..when I fell in love..

492
00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:36,705
when I fell in love..

493
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:46,608
Jehli, these are important
documents of our mill

494
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:50,844
Go to Delhi and hand them
over to Ramsharan

495
00:42:50,921 --> 00:42:54,254
Son, be careful. They are
very important documents

496
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:55,553
Okay dad. No problem

497
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:49,594
When someone invaded my breath..

498
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:55,930
when the serpent of love stung me..

499
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:58,940
When someone invaded my breath,

500
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:01,910
when the serpent of love stung me,

501
00:46:02,046 --> 00:46:05,447
when the venom entered my bones,

502
00:46:07,784 --> 00:46:14,519
when my heart challenged
the world,

503
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:19,384
I never realised..

504
00:46:19,463 --> 00:46:22,432
when I fell in love

505
00:46:22,732 --> 00:46:25,394
I never realised..

506
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:28,734
when I fell in love

507
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:31,535
when I fell in love

508
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:17,519
Who plays this hide-n-seek
with me?

509
00:47:19,956 --> 00:47:23,517
Oh, her alluring tresses,

510
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:28,992
Who plays this hide-n-seek
with me?

511
00:47:29,132 --> 00:47:32,067
Oh, her alluring tresses,

512
00:47:32,202 --> 00:47:35,103
like a dense forest

513
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:44,541
For me, my sweetheart
has risen over God

514
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:49,473
I never realised..

515
00:47:49,552 --> 00:47:52,544
when I fell in love

516
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:55,482
I never realised..

517
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:58,822
when He" in love

518
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:01,657
when I fell in love

519
00:48:49,913 --> 00:48:53,610
The gifts of love..

520
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:59,618
unceasing romance,

521
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,857
The gifts of love..

522
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:07,894
unceasing romance,

523
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:11,023
unending nights

524
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:20,633
By God, this lonely life,
I can't take anymore

525
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:25,574
I never realised..

526
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:28,242
when I fell in love

527
00:49:28,918 --> 00:49:31,580
I never realised..

528
00:49:31,655 --> 00:49:34,647
when I fell in love

529
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:37,693
when I fell in love

530
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:46,994
What are you saying, Ramsharan?
How is it possible?

531
00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:50,039
You didn't get the documents
of the mills? What..?

532
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:55,713
Jehli didn't reach Delhi?
All right, I'll find out

533
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:59,050
Balkit, get the car

534
00:50:34,186 --> 00:50:36,347
What happened? You
were happy just now

535
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:40,082
What makes you glum? What
are you thinking of?

536
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:48,159
Jehli, in love, we've
crossed all the limits

537
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:53,192
Now what?
- What else? Marriage, ritually

538
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:57,304
Else, registered marriage.
- It's not that easy, Jehli

539
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:02,977
Our families are poles apart

540
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:11,050
You are the son of a mill owner,
while I'm a driver's daughter

541
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:12,914
That's all?

542
00:51:14,193 --> 00:51:18,687
I'll either pick your dad up and
seat him by my father's side,

543
00:51:18,764 --> 00:51:22,894
or I'll kick the luxury
and be with you

544
00:51:24,302 --> 00:51:29,365
No sword can split water,
no one can set us apart

545
00:51:33,944 --> 00:51:35,002
Stop

546
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:40,782
Balkit, who's that girl?

547
00:51:41,953 --> 00:51:43,249
Sir..

548
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:47,856
Who's that girl?
- My daughter

549
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:12,107
Who is it?

550
00:52:12,817 --> 00:52:13,943
Who is it?

551
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:15,077
Leave me.

552
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:17,785
Help!

553
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:19,948
Leave me.

554
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:21,786
They are kidnapping Beeba!

555
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:26,829
Brother.. - What is it?
Why do you look scared?

556
00:52:27,998 --> 00:52:30,899
Some guys from the mill
took Beeba away

557
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,830
Took away Beeba?

558
00:52:35,438 --> 00:52:36,871
Sardar saheb..?

559
00:52:37,874 --> 00:52:38,932
Let me go

560
00:52:39,008 --> 00:52:40,100
Let me go!

561
00:52:42,011 --> 00:52:43,171
Let go!

562
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:44,837
Don't!

563
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:47,105
No!

564
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:51,841
Let me go! No!

565
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:59,017
Let me go! No!

566
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:04,823
Let me go! For God's sake

567
00:53:07,032 --> 00:53:08,192
Hold it

568
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:16,099
So it's you!

569
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:19,200
My chauffeur's daughter..

570
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:23,007
who has mesmerised my son

571
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:27,940
I give my car to your
father to drive

572
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,517
And you think of driving
my household?

573
00:53:33,892 --> 00:53:35,916
How could you stoop
so low to think..

574
00:53:36,328 --> 00:53:40,856
that I'd marry my son off
to my servant's daughter?

575
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:44,963
Must commend your scheme

576
00:53:45,504 --> 00:53:46,868
Everyone is greedy for money

577
00:53:47,572 --> 00:53:52,908
But, to rid yourself of poverty
did you find only my family, wretch?

578
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:56,138
Didn't you find another
to play with?

579
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:57,373
Enough, Sardar-ji

580
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:01,144
Please do not abuse
my true love anymore

581
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:07,927
God knows that, your son's
music made home within me

582
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:12,965
And I made the mistake of
falling in love with him

583
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:20,128
But if you think I fell in love
with him for your money..

584
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:25,237
then let me give you a
suggestion. Hack me into pieces

585
00:54:26,113 --> 00:54:29,946
Don't spare me.
- Yes, I won't spare you

586
00:54:30,216 --> 00:54:34,277
You have ruined my son's
lofty thoughts

587
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,151
I won't spare you! You
forgot your own status,

588
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:41,953
poisoned my son with your
love and drove him insane

589
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:46,999
Wretched woman! Your death
will hurt my soul,

590
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:49,967
but I'll bear the pain

591
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:56,574
But you.. your life is a sword
dangling over my honour

592
00:54:57,144 --> 00:54:59,544
I must kill you

593
00:55:01,148 --> 00:55:02,206
Yes sir?

594
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:07,181
What are you waiting for? Throw
her into the boiler. Take her away

595
00:55:07,255 --> 00:55:10,190
Why are you play acting?

596
00:55:14,162 --> 00:55:15,288
Beeba

597
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:18,933
Sardar, spare my daughter

598
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:20,060
Please spare her

599
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:26,002
Forgive my daughter, sir.
Please forgive her

600
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:31,012
I've got to know her mistake

601
00:55:32,448 --> 00:55:35,212
The poor have always
begged of the rich

602
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:39,378
It's her mistake, she dared
to desire your son

603
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:44,017
She is my only reason to live, sir

604
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:48,959
For your late wife's sake..

605
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:54,468
please forgive my daughter's
first mistake. It'll be her last

606
00:55:54,636 --> 00:56:02,042
You must bury this
wretch into hell

607
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:05,044
Tell me. Will you?

608
00:56:06,215 --> 00:56:09,309
I'll take her far away, sir

609
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,050
Get this loud and clear, girl

610
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:22,085
Sardar Vichitra Singh is
a man of self-esteem.

611
00:56:22,164 --> 00:56:24,530
Also a dangerous father

612
00:56:25,234 --> 00:56:28,294
If you even come before
my son by mistake,

613
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:33,033
I'll hack him to pieces,
right before you

614
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:36,509
No, sir.. please don't

615
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:41,082
I can't see that. I
can give up my life..

616
00:56:41,217 --> 00:56:44,482
but I can't see my beloved
being killed

617
00:56:46,188 --> 00:56:49,282
Please don't tell Jehli
anything about this

618
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:52,087
I'll walk out of his life

619
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:58,394
I'll go away, far away
than you can imagine

620
00:56:59,534 --> 00:57:03,095
For God's sake, please
don't tell him anything

621
00:57:03,238 --> 00:57:04,671
Tell him nothing

622
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:11,269
My child..

623
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:12,404
Father!

624
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,156
Dad!

625
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:37,129
Where did you hide Beeba
and her father?

626
00:57:37,272 --> 00:57:39,172
The labourers have
told me everything

627
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:43,175
No need to lie! - Listen,
if you have the courage..

628
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:48,148
to bear the truth. The vermin
wanted to reach the skies

629
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:53,449
I showed the wretch where
she belongs, I buried her

630
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:59,518
It's in your best of interests
to forget her

631
00:57:59,664 --> 00:58:02,155
Who are you to decide
about my love?

632
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:05,100
As for setting me and Beeba apart,

633
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,105
you can't separate
sugar from milk.

634
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:10,642
Or, you'd be successful
in your evil ploys

635
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:12,574
Watch your tongue, Jehli

636
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:18,443
Or, I might stop counting
you amongst my children

637
00:58:19,353 --> 00:58:20,513
Whatever I've done,

638
00:58:20,587 --> 00:58:24,182
I did it to uphold the honour,
status and reputation of this family

639
00:58:24,257 --> 00:58:25,315
No dad, no

640
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:29,451
You did nothing but stifle
your son's desires

641
00:58:31,198 --> 00:58:34,326
A father who ruins his son's
happiness can't be granted a grandson

642
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:37,130
My bhabhi is barren, not her fault

643
00:58:37,205 --> 00:58:41,198
It's your lowly mind
that is at fault

644
00:58:42,276 --> 00:58:44,141
Like the walls of this house,

645
00:58:44,211 --> 00:58:47,203
it has never heard the
cries of my heart

646
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,712
Why did you drop the sword?

647
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:25,374
Come on, strike me. Why
don't you kill me?

648
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,182
I'm helpless! The
Guru has forbidden

649
00:59:28,257 --> 00:59:30,225
us from killing an unarmed enemy

650
00:59:31,426 --> 00:59:32,484
Enemy?

651
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,252
Yes, enemy!

652
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:39,265
No better name for my father!
I disown you

653
00:59:39,335 --> 00:59:41,565
We're dead for each other

654
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,273
Jehli, stop

655
00:59:49,277 --> 00:59:50,437
Don't you dare

656
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,276
From now on, I have
no relations with him

657
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:06,758
And Jehli walked out of the house

658
01:00:08,562 --> 01:00:12,498
I tried my best to stop
him, but he refused

659
01:00:13,501 --> 01:00:16,629
He's wandering, looking for Beeba

660
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,533
We looked for her everywhere

661
01:00:22,711 --> 01:00:27,273
But we never found Beeba,
nor did Jehli find peace

662
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,320
No knowing where he is
suffering right now

663
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:12,357
As for me,

664
01:01:14,529 --> 01:01:16,793
As for me,

665
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:25,636
As for me, my days just pass..

666
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:31,537
As for me, my days just pass

667
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:37,878
like chaff being separated

668
01:01:38,053 --> 01:01:43,719
As for me, my days just pass

669
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:49,453
As for me, my days just pass

670
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:20,850
You loved me as my mother would

671
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:27,433
My love, I have lost
sleep for good

672
01:02:33,441 --> 01:02:39,402
You loved me as my mother would

673
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:45,952
My love, I have lost
sleep for good

674
01:02:46,021 --> 01:02:47,681
We are sharing the sufferings..

675
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:57,731
We are sharing the sufferings
the world has given us

676
01:02:57,865 --> 01:03:03,929
My days just pass..

677
01:03:04,138 --> 01:03:10,475
like chaff being separated

678
01:03:10,611 --> 01:03:15,514
My days pass in agony

679
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:22,488
My days pass in agony

680
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:17,805
For all the help I took from
astrologers, my love..

681
01:04:17,946 --> 01:04:23,680
the amulets and talismans
never worked a bit

682
01:04:30,759 --> 01:04:36,561
For all the help I took from
astrologers, my love..

683
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:42,535
the amulets and talismans
never worked a bit

684
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:44,572
All those attempts..

685
01:04:45,743 --> 01:04:47,870
All those attempts..

686
01:04:49,247 --> 01:04:54,742
All those attempts
don't seem to work

687
01:04:54,952 --> 01:05:00,618
As for me, my days just pass..

688
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:07,597
like chaff being separated

689
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:13,202
As for me, my days just pass..

690
01:05:13,272 --> 01:05:19,177
As for me, my days just pass..

691
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,248
Brother Jehli, how are you?

692
01:05:34,692 --> 01:05:37,627
How are you?
- Brother,

693
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:41,696
I got to know much later
about what you endured

694
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,631
Bhabhi told me. It hurt me a lot

695
01:05:47,238 --> 01:05:50,696
You and your sweetheart
were set apart

696
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:57,576
I looked for her everywhere.

697
01:05:57,649 --> 01:06:00,641
No knowing where the hell
she's been hidden

698
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:04,981
But by God, I'll certainly
find her

699
01:06:06,826 --> 01:06:09,659
Sadly my father has turned my foe

700
01:06:10,263 --> 01:06:12,731
Every thing in this
world seems useless

701
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:17,001
Death doesn't come,
and life is miserable

702
01:06:17,938 --> 01:06:21,271
I'm just smoking my desires

703
01:06:24,845 --> 01:06:26,745
Do not lose hope

704
01:06:27,114 --> 01:06:30,049
Everything will be all
right. I'm with you

705
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:33,280
Forget it. Who was that girl?

706
01:06:34,288 --> 01:06:38,691
I've finished my studies in
London, I'm not going back

707
01:06:38,826 --> 01:06:40,726
I'll stay in my country,
in my Punjab

708
01:06:41,128 --> 01:06:44,655
But nothing amuses me in
the house without you

709
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:48,166
Come off it. Who was that girl?

710
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:51,698
Pinky. My friend

711
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,671
Friend? Or..?

712
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:56,809
To tell you frankly,
she loves me dearly

713
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,843
And you?
- I can't live without her

714
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:00,975
I see

715
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:05,311
My thinking is, he is rich
whose heart is full of love

716
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:10,326
But little one, the world
thinks othenwise

717
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:14,323
Is she from a rich family?
- Brother,

718
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:19,731
compared to daddy, they
are really nothing

719
01:07:21,169 --> 01:07:22,761
Pinky's brother is a scrap dealer

720
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:27,965
What?

721
01:07:29,009 --> 01:07:33,139
You've stuck your neck out. You
know your father, don't you?

722
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:36,977
You also know what
happened with me

723
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:40,744
I don't want my kid brother
to go through the same

724
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:44,754
Brother, I know you
will always help me

725
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:49,989
I have thought up something. I
won't become a rebel like you

726
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:53,692
But I will win my love..

727
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:57,298
my own way

728
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:02,835
Sardar saheb, thanks for coming

729
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:07,611
You are a friend. I can't
miss my friend's party

730
01:08:07,886 --> 01:08:10,616
Let me introduce you to someone.
- Okay

731
01:08:11,624 --> 01:08:15,958
Grewal, meet Sardar Vichitra
Singh. I work for his mill

732
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:20,623
Sat Sri Akal. I'm blessed
to have met you

733
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,630
Come, my child. This
is my daughter

734
01:08:24,237 --> 01:08:26,637
Pay your respects, dear.
- My respects, uncle

735
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:30,004
Bless you. What are you studying?
- I'm doing MBA

736
01:08:30,243 --> 01:08:31,607
Papa always talks about you

737
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:35,037
He's being grateful

738
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:38,240
Excuse me, uncle. Papa, I'll
go and meet aunt Sheila

739
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:40,752
Okay, go on.
- Sat Sri Akal

740
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:42,288
God bless you. Have a good time

741
01:08:43,658 --> 01:08:46,650
Mr Grewal, your daughter
is very sweet

742
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:51,297
God is merciful. Please
be seated. - Please

743
01:08:53,802 --> 01:08:58,000
Sardar saheb, time really flies

744
01:08:58,273 --> 01:09:01,037
She was so little when
her mother passed away

745
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:04,670
As her father, I'm only worried..

746
01:09:04,813 --> 01:09:08,078
about her marriage. I'd
be in peace after that

747
01:09:08,216 --> 01:09:10,980
My son Deep has just come after
finishing his studies in London

748
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:13,914
We're looking for a girl for him

749
01:09:14,055 --> 01:09:16,285
It's regarding that
I wanted to meet you

750
01:09:16,858 --> 01:09:20,294
Mr Brar spoke so much about you

751
01:09:20,796 --> 01:09:22,627
I thought God willing..

752
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:27,693
my daughter and your son..
would make a pair

753
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:32,638
Mr Grewal, I'm a businessman. And
a smart businessman is someone..

754
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,975
who understands the gravity
of the situation

755
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:38,081
Just give me the orders, sir

756
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:42,879
I'll have pearls and diamonds
embedded in gold bars

757
01:09:43,386 --> 01:09:49,723
Well, my daughter is the sole
heir to all the jungles in Himachal

758
01:09:50,727 --> 01:09:54,891
God has been merciful. I get
contracts worth millions

759
01:09:55,331 --> 01:09:58,095
Millions and millions
become billions

760
01:09:58,234 --> 01:10:00,293
Toast to the relationship

761
01:10:02,839 --> 01:10:04,329
Cheers

762
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:11,743
You poor wretched people! These
drivers are a community of thieves

763
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:16,749
How dare you betray the
hands that feed you!

764
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:18,182
Get out of here

765
01:10:20,355 --> 01:10:24,758
Daddy, you were right. I now know
where these servants belong

766
01:10:25,026 --> 01:10:29,190
You should've thrown
Jehli out the day..

767
01:10:30,165 --> 01:10:33,134
he danced with the
driver's daughter

768
01:10:34,369 --> 01:10:38,999
These lowly people are nothing
compared to my daddy

769
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:41,732
You are my real son

770
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:44,901
Embrace me, son

771
01:10:46,946 --> 01:10:48,379
I'm so glad

772
01:10:49,848 --> 01:10:54,785
Son, you will be happy to know
that I have fixed your marriage

773
01:10:54,853 --> 01:10:55,911
Marriage?

774
01:10:56,054 --> 01:10:57,714
Son, I have fixed
your wedding with

775
01:10:57,789 --> 01:10:59,120
the princess of the
Himachal jungles

776
01:10:59,257 --> 01:11:02,784
It's a wealthy family.
She's Grewal's daughter

777
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:05,828
But they own liquor
bars and cinema halls

778
01:11:06,997 --> 01:11:09,192
He didn't tell me that

779
01:11:11,235 --> 01:11:14,796
Never mind. It'll all be yours

780
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:16,770
Dad, you worry so much for me

781
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:22,803
I worry about Jehli too,
but that fool..

782
01:11:23,815 --> 01:11:25,908
One second, dad. Sorry

783
01:11:26,084 --> 01:11:28,985
Hello? Yes, K.B Singh, Sat
Sri Akal. How are you?

784
01:11:29,488 --> 01:11:33,822
I can't marry your sister.
Dad just fixed my wedding

785
01:11:33,959 --> 01:11:40,865
I know you own twenty mills, Big
Ben, Hilton Hotel and everything

786
01:11:41,099 --> 01:11:42,759
But I can't help it, dad
has fixed my wedding.

787
01:11:42,834 --> 01:11:43,960
It can't be called off

788
01:11:45,436 --> 01:11:49,839
Call me tomorrow. But I don't
think dad will agree

789
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:52,810
I'm sorry. Bye

790
01:11:56,013 --> 01:11:57,105
Who was it?

791
01:11:57,449 --> 01:12:00,111
K.B Singh. He owns half of London

792
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:05,152
Actually dad, he wants to
bequeath all his businesses to me

793
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,927
But there's a problem.
- Problem? What problem, son?

794
01:12:10,129 --> 01:12:13,098
The problem is, I must
marry his sister

795
01:12:14,298 --> 01:12:17,131
Deep, you should've agreed

796
01:12:17,268 --> 01:12:22,399
You needn't ask me. Such
alliances don't come again and again

797
01:12:23,474 --> 01:12:25,101
We'll own all of London

798
01:12:26,043 --> 01:12:28,876
What happens to Grewal then?

799
01:12:28,946 --> 01:12:30,140
Grewal?

800
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:36,210
Deep, we are businessmen

801
01:12:37,054 --> 01:12:40,251
Deals are struck and broken

802
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:42,459
We must see our own gains

803
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:49,026
Besides, one who has K.B Singh
has nothing to do with Grewal

804
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,297
Son, call K.B Singh over next week

805
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,202
Brother..

806
01:13:33,044 --> 01:13:34,306
Sat Sri Akal

807
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,213
Hi Deep. How are you?
- I'm fine. What about you?

808
01:13:39,952 --> 01:13:42,887
Actually, I wanted to come
by chartered plane..

809
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:45,389
but no one wants to fly down here

810
01:13:45,558 --> 01:13:47,958
We're trying, soon we'll
have a helipad

811
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:50,927
That's great. Next time I'll
get my helicopter over

812
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:53,928
By the way, who is he?

813
01:13:54,067 --> 01:13:56,001
My father. Sardar Vichitra Singh

814
01:13:57,137 --> 01:14:00,004
Sat Sri Akal. - Sat Sri Akal.
You got a nice father

815
01:14:00,074 --> 01:14:01,268
Good looking dad

816
01:14:03,178 --> 01:14:05,475
By the way, she is my sis. Pinky

817
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,979
Bless you, dear. Mr K.B Singh,

818
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,914
despite living in London,

819
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:13,977
you have given your sister
a decent upbringing

820
01:14:14,255 --> 01:14:18,954
You know, I believe in mixing
Indian and foreign culture

821
01:14:19,094 --> 01:14:21,062
Like churning butter
using western churner

822
01:14:21,129 --> 01:14:22,187
Churner

823
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:30,160
Come here.. he is my secretary,
personal secretary. Bomb

824
01:14:31,105 --> 01:14:32,231
Hello

825
01:14:50,024 --> 01:14:52,083
What are you up to?
- It'd fetch a good deal

826
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:56,190
You'll be exposed.
- You are strange

827
01:14:56,330 --> 01:15:02,166
If we polish it, there are lots
of crazy rich men waiting to buy

828
01:15:02,303 --> 01:15:03,361
It'd fetch us good

829
01:15:06,642 --> 01:15:10,237
Mr K.B Singh, any problem?
- No. I was just taking a look

830
01:15:10,379 --> 01:15:13,610
Your choice is damn good. You've
got a great collection

831
01:15:13,716 --> 01:15:19,052
Actually, he likes to
buy antique pieces

832
01:15:19,188 --> 01:15:20,985
Exactly. Last time when
I went to America,

833
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:25,050
I bought NASA's old rockets.
- What?

834
01:15:25,194 --> 01:15:27,218
Yes, rockets. I've given
them out for painting

835
01:15:27,362 --> 01:15:28,454
Oh really?

836
01:15:28,596 --> 01:15:31,656
Come on in.
- Let's go

837
01:15:37,138 --> 01:15:38,196
Take some more, Mr K.B Singh.

838
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:41,308
- Oh no, thank you so
much. I'm stuffed

839
01:15:41,508 --> 01:15:45,069
I had dinner with the queen the
other day, she too had me stuffed

840
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:48,072
Queen?
- Queen Elizabeth

841
01:15:48,681 --> 01:15:51,149
Queen Elizabeth

842
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:54,053
Well, Bush is far better

843
01:15:54,354 --> 01:15:58,154
He knows what I like and how
much, so he doesn't force me

844
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:01,089
He knows that I like bell-plant

845
01:16:01,696 --> 01:16:08,101
The moment I fly, he asks
his chef to cook it for me

846
01:16:17,545 --> 01:16:21,106
It can be polished to
look new. Actually..

847
01:16:21,383 --> 01:16:25,183
Mr K.B Singh, you move around
with great people..

848
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:30,054
It's nothing. At Deep
and Pinky's wedding,

849
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,755
I'll have Sania Mirza dance

850
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:37,166
Mita will be there to welcome you

851
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:40,431
Mita?
- Amitabh Bachchan

852
01:16:41,738 --> 01:16:45,606
He'll serve cold drinks to the
guests. The tall chap is family

853
01:16:46,343 --> 01:16:48,777
I'll warn Sallu..

854
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:52,240
Sallu? Who is Sallu?

855
01:16:52,383 --> 01:16:54,111
Salman Khan

856
01:16:56,119 --> 01:16:57,279
Salman Khan

857
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:01,516
I'll warn him to put his shirt
on. He's always roaming nude

858
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:06,353
Sir, Mr Grewal is here

859
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:09,556
Mr Grewal.

860
01:17:09,765 --> 01:17:11,789
Excuse me. I'll be back

861
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:15,165
All right. No problem.
- Please be seated

862
01:17:23,778 --> 01:17:26,178
Sat Sri Akal, Mr Vichitra Singh

863
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:31,476
Mr Grewal, these fruits..
it's a big surprise

864
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:36,181
Nothing was decided anyway.
- We had fixed the alliance

865
01:17:36,325 --> 01:17:40,523
So I thought I'd give you a token
of approval and surprise you

866
01:17:40,663 --> 01:17:42,153
Token of approval?
- Yes

867
01:17:42,298 --> 01:17:45,323
Mr Grewal, we had only spoken
about the alliance

868
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,335
If you remember, I told you,

869
01:17:49,204 --> 01:17:52,139
a smart businessman is
someone who understands

870
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:53,606
the gravity of the situation

871
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:57,208
Many situations arise and
disappear in business

872
01:17:57,478 --> 01:18:02,211
Business? What business?
I don't understand

873
01:18:02,317 --> 01:18:05,775
Please be explicit

874
01:18:06,288 --> 01:18:11,282
To be frank, I have fixed
my son's wedding

875
01:18:11,493 --> 01:18:14,690
Wedding? With someone else?

876
01:18:14,897 --> 01:18:19,231
Yes. You can't even
get closer to them

877
01:18:20,436 --> 01:18:22,802
Deep's father-in-law
owns half of London

878
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,368
He moves around with famous
people of the world

879
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:28,410
By forging relations with you,

880
01:18:28,613 --> 01:18:31,776
we don't want to collect
firewood in the jungles

881
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,908
Vichitra Singh!

882
01:18:34,386 --> 01:18:36,320
It wasn't a wise thing to do

883
01:18:36,455 --> 01:18:38,855
This enmity will cost you dear

884
01:18:39,259 --> 01:18:40,385
Grewal!

885
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,350
Hush

886
01:18:44,263 --> 01:18:49,223
Just watch. Unless I
destroy this house..

887
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:53,262
I'm no Ranjit Singh Grewal

888
01:19:02,949 --> 01:19:05,076
Sat Sri Akal, brother.
- Sat Sri Akal

889
01:19:05,152 --> 01:19:06,210
What's up?

890
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:11,855
I'm very happy today, brother.
Just congratulate me

891
01:19:11,992 --> 01:19:15,325
I'm breaking the good news
to you. - What news?

892
01:19:15,462 --> 01:19:17,930
You started the war of love

893
01:19:19,266 --> 01:19:22,861
I have made the first killing

894
01:19:24,105 --> 01:19:27,040
Don't talk in riddles. Be explicit

895
01:19:27,175 --> 01:19:29,302
You know, dad fixed my engagement

896
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:32,175
I plotted and had it called off

897
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,212
Now I'm getting engaged to Pinky

898
01:19:35,482 --> 01:19:37,814
I turned Pinky's brother,
a scrap dealer..

899
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:41,981
into a fake millionaire
from London

900
01:19:42,957 --> 01:19:46,358
Daddy is very happy about
owning half of London

901
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:49,120
Congrats

902
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:55,993
Trying times, brother.
To fortify our love,

903
01:19:56,905 --> 01:20:00,500
we are fighting our dear ones.
- To keep love alive

904
01:20:01,443 --> 01:20:05,846
Brother, you always told me, the
greatest of all relationships..

905
01:20:05,914 --> 01:20:10,908
is the relationship
of love, of God

906
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:12,312
Brother,

907
01:20:16,091 --> 01:20:18,150
I have a request.
- Tell me

908
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,059
We're throwing my engagement party

909
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:24,892
My eyes will be looking for you

910
01:21:00,635 --> 01:21:03,570
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding song

911
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:06,972
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding song

912
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:10,044
For, God created this pair

913
01:21:10,246 --> 01:21:12,976
For, God created this pair

914
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:17,078
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding song

915
01:21:17,255 --> 01:21:20,053
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding song

916
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:23,216
For, God created this pair

917
01:21:23,427 --> 01:21:26,020
For, God created this pair

918
01:21:26,996 --> 01:21:29,988
For, God created this pair

919
01:21:30,132 --> 01:21:33,192
For, God created this pair

920
01:21:54,357 --> 01:21:57,588
Pick up a bottle of
liquor and dance

921
01:22:00,564 --> 01:22:04,056
Liquor churns out sweet music

922
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:10,601
Pick up a bottle of
liquor and dance

923
01:22:10,707 --> 01:22:14,040
Liquor churns out sweet music

924
01:22:17,047 --> 01:22:20,278
Happiness has found its way back

925
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:23,045
Happiness has found its way back

926
01:22:23,186 --> 01:22:26,053
For, God created this pair

927
01:22:26,323 --> 01:22:29,087
For, God created this pair

928
01:22:29,594 --> 01:22:32,722
For, God created this pair

929
01:22:33,065 --> 01:22:36,057
For, God created this pair

930
01:22:54,486 --> 01:23:00,083
Who cast an evil eye on my family?

931
01:23:02,427 --> 01:23:05,020
I had to rebel..

932
01:23:05,096 --> 01:23:09,556
against my own father

933
01:23:11,268 --> 01:23:18,731
Lord, rid this world of
castes and religions

934
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:29,076
Oh mother, every moment
I miss your love

935
01:23:32,558 --> 01:23:36,119
The train of events
make me lose my sleep

936
01:23:36,395 --> 01:23:39,125
The train of events
make me lose my sleep

937
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:42,200
God created this pair

938
01:23:42,335 --> 01:23:45,099
God created this pair

939
01:23:45,405 --> 01:23:48,738
God created this pair

940
01:23:48,809 --> 01:23:52,142
God created this pair

941
01:24:13,267 --> 01:24:16,600
Everyone is intoxicated

942
01:24:20,174 --> 01:24:23,166
Sis-in-law, dance with my
brother! Why are you sitting alone?

943
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:29,737
Everyone is intoxicated

944
01:24:29,849 --> 01:24:33,182
Sis-in-law, dance with my
brother! Why are you sitting alone?

945
01:24:36,189 --> 01:24:39,214
Together we'll get to celebrate
the festival next year

946
01:24:39,358 --> 01:24:42,191
Together we'll get to celebrate
the festival next year

947
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:45,195
For, God created this pair

948
01:24:45,465 --> 01:24:48,195
For, God created this pair

949
01:24:48,335 --> 01:24:51,793
For, God created this pair

950
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:54,534
For, God created this pair

951
01:24:55,275 --> 01:24:58,608
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding music

952
01:24:58,812 --> 01:25:01,747
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding music

953
01:25:01,882 --> 01:25:04,783
For, God created this pair

954
01:25:04,885 --> 01:25:08,184
For, God created this pair

955
01:25:08,356 --> 01:25:11,655
For, God created this pair

956
01:25:11,793 --> 01:25:14,785
For, God created this pair

957
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:18,461
For, God created this pair

958
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,398
For, God created this pair

959
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,801
For, God created this pair

960
01:25:24,906 --> 01:25:29,400
For, God created this pair

961
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,547
Finally, you felt the
need for coming here

962
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:39,253
No need, dad. It's my kid
brother's engagement

963
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:42,790
As his elder brother,
it was my duty

964
01:25:43,259 --> 01:25:46,695
But you are ruining money
over ordinary people

965
01:25:48,263 --> 01:25:52,256
I'm not ruining the money, I'm
sacrificing it for my brother

966
01:25:52,534 --> 01:25:55,264
Looks like you've earned so much

967
01:25:55,404 --> 01:25:58,271
that you've lost appreciation
for money

968
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:01,669
One appreciates man, not money

969
01:26:01,878 --> 01:26:05,279
They might be laborers for you.
But they are admirers of my music

970
01:26:05,414 --> 01:26:08,315
I can't drop them for money

971
01:26:09,484 --> 01:26:12,544
No knowing what they
have done to you,

972
01:26:12,688 --> 01:26:14,781
you have forgotten your family

973
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:19,785
How can I forget your, dad? You
have given a new color to my music

974
01:26:19,895 --> 01:26:22,728
I ought to sacrifice
money over you

975
01:26:25,568 --> 01:26:29,504
There can't be a father
like you in this world

976
01:26:40,517 --> 01:26:44,317
Pour the petrol, quick.
- Yes

977
01:26:44,921 --> 01:26:46,513
Set every thing on fire

978
01:26:47,523 --> 01:26:49,286
Boss has ordered to smoke it

979
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:50,758
Hold

980
01:26:51,428 --> 01:26:56,422
Light it. C'mon

981
01:26:57,501 --> 01:26:58,763
Dip it in petrol

982
01:26:59,403 --> 01:27:00,631
Hurry

983
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:03,599
Why isn't it lightning?

984
01:27:04,508 --> 01:27:08,000
I don't know.
- Throw the torch away

985
01:27:08,512 --> 01:27:10,309
Let it go!

986
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:16,352
Come on! Don't let him go

987
01:27:17,521 --> 01:27:21,354
Let me go!

988
01:27:28,631 --> 01:27:35,696
You said it'd go up in clouds of
smoke. But it didn't smoke at all

989
01:27:35,972 --> 01:27:38,532
Sorry sir, the petrol
didn't ignite

990
01:27:38,809 --> 01:27:42,642
Not petrol. Water!
I know everything

991
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:46,676
Such carelessness! You
took adulterated petrol

992
01:27:46,982 --> 01:27:48,540
We thought it was genuine, sir

993
01:27:49,717 --> 01:27:52,379
Really?
- We bought it in the black market

994
01:27:55,991 --> 01:28:00,985
Bastard! Do they ever serve
genuine stuff in the black market?

995
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:07,997
Looks like I must
do something myself

996
01:28:11,507 --> 01:28:14,601
Don't mind this, Sardar-ji

997
01:28:15,011 --> 01:28:17,411
Corruption is rampant in India

998
01:28:18,415 --> 01:28:21,350
Had it been England's
petrol, your..

999
01:28:21,418 --> 01:28:24,410
..mill would've gone
up in smoke. Finished

1000
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:28,456
Well Mr K.B Singh..?
- Glory to corruption, I mean

1001
01:28:28,692 --> 01:28:34,494
You ought to thank that fellow
who sold adulterated petrol

1002
01:28:34,632 --> 01:28:37,430
Genuine stuff mustn't
have saved the mill

1003
01:28:38,436 --> 01:28:42,463
You are right, Mr K.B Singh.
If I find that corrupt man,

1004
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:47,636
I'll certainly reward him. - You
are wrong. Why call him corrupt?

1005
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:52,444
He's not at fault. His
adulteration saved your factory

1006
01:28:55,654 --> 01:29:00,387
Mr Deep, one thing that I like
very much about your factory..

1007
01:29:00,459 --> 01:29:02,723
is the colour of the machinery.
- I see

1008
01:29:02,861 --> 01:29:05,557
The entire machinery is green.
I like the colour green

1009
01:29:06,465 --> 01:29:07,523
Sat Sri Akal

1010
01:29:08,066 --> 01:29:11,502
All these are actually
new machines. Imported

1011
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:14,470
This is a roller,
it juices sugarcane

1012
01:29:14,607 --> 01:29:17,701
These machines are
outdated in the U.K

1013
01:29:18,077 --> 01:29:20,477
Outdated? But this is the latest

1014
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:27,078
I'll give a better machine on
my sister's wedding, in dowry

1015
01:29:27,687 --> 01:29:31,487
Sir, there's an important
message from London for you

1016
01:29:31,557 --> 01:29:35,493
Message.. very, very important.
- Message from London

1017
01:29:37,597 --> 01:29:41,761
Let me drop a bomb on you. - I
hate your sight. Give me good news

1018
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:48,501
I'm trying to make a lasting
impression on them

1019
01:29:48,641 --> 01:29:51,735
Forget it. Worry about yourself.
A bomb is about to fall on you

1020
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:53,107
You are raving

1021
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,979
Not a real bomb, the Mohali
cops are looking for you

1022
01:29:58,117 --> 01:30:00,847
Mohali cops are looking
for me? Stop raving

1023
01:30:00,987 --> 01:30:04,445
I'm not raving, it's the truth.
They have set roadblocks everywhere

1024
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:08,517
Everyone is being asked, "Are
you the scrap dealer K.B ?"

1025
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:11,686
You are raving. Why are the cops
looking for me? What have I done?

1026
01:30:11,764 --> 01:30:16,531
Why are they looking for me? -
Not I, Ranjit Singh sent the cops

1027
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:20,071
He said you are selling
adulterated petrol. I can't help it

1028
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:22,970
Cut the crap. Won't you
ever bring good news?

1029
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:27,540
I say, in Mohali..
-Well Mr K.B Singh,

1030
01:30:28,148 --> 01:30:30,741
do you like my sugar mill?
- Of course

1031
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:35,712
I like it very much. But I
feel a little suffocated

1032
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:39,556
I feel suffocated. Suffocation

1033
01:30:39,826 --> 01:30:42,795
Never mind. Let me show
you around outside

1034
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,531
Mohal..
- Where do we go?

1035
01:30:45,598 --> 01:30:47,566
Mohali.
- Sure, Mohali..

1036
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:50,568
no, not Mohali!
- Come with me

1037
01:30:50,703 --> 01:30:55,572
No, I'm fine here.
- See the plot for our new mill

1038
01:30:55,642 --> 01:30:57,542
No..
- Come with me

1039
01:31:08,189 --> 01:31:10,714
Be seated, I've to go to the bank

1040
01:31:13,695 --> 01:31:14,889
Be seated!

1041
01:31:21,703 --> 01:31:24,194
Move, move

1042
01:31:26,775 --> 01:31:27,901
Stop

1043
01:31:29,777 --> 01:31:30,835
Who is it?

1044
01:31:33,948 --> 01:31:35,643
Please come out, Sardar-ji

1045
01:31:40,789 --> 01:31:41,915
Stop

1046
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:44,588
Listen..

1047
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:47,687
Stop

1048
01:31:50,632 --> 01:31:51,792
Stop

1049
01:32:22,263 --> 01:32:23,923
I love my Punjab

1050
01:32:24,331 --> 01:32:26,663
Color Punjab! I love it

1051
01:32:27,835 --> 01:32:30,668
Move it, kids

1052
01:32:31,272 --> 01:32:32,636
Mr K.B Singh, what is this?

1053
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:35,237
Actually, I'm enjoying
the colourful Punjab

1054
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:39,671
I like romantic Punjab!
- Mr K.B Singh, this is not London

1055
01:32:39,812 --> 01:32:44,112
Kids will come after you.
- No problem. I like Indian kids

1056
01:32:47,286 --> 01:32:49,948
What is it, Inspector?
- Who is this, Sardar-ji?

1057
01:32:50,089 --> 01:32:52,887
He's my son's to-be
brother-in-law. - From the U.K

1058
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:57,125
Indian police? I like it

1059
01:32:57,896 --> 01:32:59,659
Let's go, Mr K.B Singh

1060
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:01,993
Who is this?

1061
01:33:02,135 --> 01:33:03,193
Smart guy

1062
01:33:06,306 --> 01:33:10,072
We've been informed that the cops
have exposed a huge petrol scam

1063
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,974
For a long time adulterated petrol
was being sold in three states

1064
01:33:13,113 --> 01:33:15,980
The accused Tillu Singh, a
scrap dealer, is absconding

1065
01:33:16,116 --> 01:33:21,281
The government has announced
50,000 cash reward for news on him

1066
01:33:22,156 --> 01:33:25,181
Bomb, what blast is this!

1067
01:33:25,324 --> 01:33:27,917
The cops are looking..
for the boss

1068
01:33:28,059 --> 01:33:31,756
I'll also be hauled in

1069
01:33:31,996 --> 01:33:36,057
What are you thinking of?
Go and look for boss

1070
01:33:46,911 --> 01:33:47,969
Boss

1071
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:52,345
Ass! Won't you ever drop in
quietly? You take the life out of me

1072
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:56,743
Speak! Where did you
go leaving me alone?

1073
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:59,981
Don't I bring you news daily?
- News? Ass

1074
01:34:00,124 --> 01:34:03,890
Or are you digging my grave?
Shoot the news

1075
01:34:04,028 --> 01:34:05,723
Very bad news

1076
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:09,733
You bring news as bad as your face

1077
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:13,700
Won't you ever bring good news?
Hurry up and tell me

1078
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:18,940
I've been surviving on juice.
- You'd rather order another glass

1079
01:34:19,143 --> 01:34:20,803
The news might give
you a rude shock

1080
01:34:20,944 --> 01:34:24,345
Shoot, swine!

1081
01:34:24,447 --> 01:34:26,813
We've been exposed.

1082
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:28,747
The cops of three states
are madly looking for you

1083
01:34:29,053 --> 01:34:33,786
Before they take you, just
vanish. - Hold this, sonny

1084
01:34:34,058 --> 01:34:37,926
Swine! You are always
bringing ominous news

1085
01:34:38,128 --> 01:34:41,961
Ever brought good news? Are
you my servant? Or my enemy?

1086
01:34:42,098 --> 01:34:46,091
Enemy! I mean, I bring
your enemy's news

1087
01:34:46,235 --> 01:34:48,897
There's good news too.
- Tell me quickly

1088
01:34:49,004 --> 01:34:52,804
The news is..
- Scheme!

1089
01:34:53,075 --> 01:34:56,806
The scheme is that, scrap is
being auctioned in Kashmir

1090
01:34:56,946 --> 01:35:00,006
Why don't we go there, strike
a deal and set the business?

1091
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:02,812
Once things cool down here,
we'll be back to pavilion

1092
01:35:04,021 --> 01:35:05,989
That's a good.. tell me, swine

1093
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:08,819
Where do I leave Pinky?

1094
01:35:08,893 --> 01:35:11,828
I'm here.
- What do you mean?

1095
01:35:11,963 --> 01:35:15,796
I got an idea. Now that
you are leaving,

1096
01:35:15,933 --> 01:35:18,299
why don't you take Deep
and Pinky along?

1097
01:35:18,436 --> 01:35:22,998
Sardar has a bungalow there.
Free accommodation and free food

1098
01:35:23,141 --> 01:35:25,438
And we'll do business there

1099
01:35:27,011 --> 01:35:28,876
Deep and Pinky are here

1100
01:35:30,848 --> 01:35:32,816
Hi Pinky. How are you?
- I'm fine

1101
01:35:35,018 --> 01:35:39,887
My doll, I'm thinking of going
to Kashmir regarding business

1102
01:35:40,157 --> 01:35:43,456
I want the two of you to
come with me to Kashmir

1103
01:35:43,527 --> 01:35:47,861
What will we do there, brother?
- I'm also going, Pinky

1104
01:35:48,465 --> 01:35:52,959
I mean, boss is planning to
set up business in Kashmir

1105
01:35:53,104 --> 01:35:55,800
He wants you to come along.
We'll do our business,

1106
01:35:55,874 --> 01:35:57,898
you folks do yours

1107
01:36:10,888 --> 01:36:16,417
Hey lad,

1108
01:36:22,334 --> 01:36:24,996
Hey lad,

1109
01:36:25,136 --> 01:36:27,900
you have afflicted me

1110
01:36:28,039 --> 01:36:31,064
Your love has rendered me useless

1111
01:36:31,142 --> 01:36:33,906
you have afflicted me

1112
01:36:34,045 --> 01:36:36,946
Your love has rendered me useless

1113
01:36:44,923 --> 01:36:49,917
Hey lassie..

1114
01:36:55,934 --> 01:36:59,097
Hey lassie..

1115
01:36:59,237 --> 01:37:01,534
Hey lassie..

1116
01:37:01,605 --> 01:37:04,972
you worry too much, why?

1117
01:37:06,109 --> 01:37:08,168
You belong to me

1118
01:37:08,544 --> 01:37:09,977
you worry too much, why?

1119
01:37:10,113 --> 01:37:12,946
You belong to me

1120
01:37:13,016 --> 01:37:14,916
you worry too much, why?

1121
01:37:14,986 --> 01:37:17,010
You belong to me

1122
01:37:17,154 --> 01:37:18,985
you worry too much, why?

1123
01:37:19,123 --> 01:37:22,092
You belong to me

1124
01:37:23,227 --> 01:37:26,526
Pinky, it's an amazing
sight, isn't it?

1125
01:37:27,565 --> 01:37:29,965
That looks like the
Sardar's son Deep

1126
01:37:30,101 --> 01:37:33,434
Wonderful! Romancing in Kashmir

1127
01:37:34,973 --> 01:37:37,533
As long as that girl
is in his life,

1128
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:42,342
my daughter can't marry him.
She must be taken care of

1129
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:44,915
Pick up the girl. Thrash the boy,

1130
01:37:44,983 --> 01:37:47,918
let him know who he
has messed with

1131
01:37:47,986 --> 01:37:49,977
Come on

1132
01:37:52,257 --> 01:37:54,248
Let go.. let go of me

1133
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:56,218
Let go!

1134
01:38:28,193 --> 01:38:29,319
Brother

1135
01:38:33,465 --> 01:38:37,026
Even in his sleep a Jat is deadly.
But you've struck a roaring lion

1136
01:39:29,087 --> 01:39:30,213
Are you all right?

1137
01:39:31,356 --> 01:39:35,087
How come you are here, brother?
- I came for a show

1138
01:39:35,227 --> 01:39:38,252
What brings you here? - I came
here with Pinky for a picnic

1139
01:39:39,097 --> 01:39:41,088
Who were they?
- No idea

1140
01:39:43,268 --> 01:39:46,567
Don't worry. Come

1141
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,348
Be careful, son

1142
01:40:08,293 --> 01:40:09,385
Bittu!

1143
01:40:32,584 --> 01:40:34,449
Bittu, are you all right?

1144
01:40:34,753 --> 01:40:36,084
You drive an expensive car ..

1145
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,680
..with eyes blindfolded.
Can't you even see kids?

1146
01:40:38,758 --> 01:40:40,385
The parents should be careful.

1147
01:40:40,527 --> 01:40:43,462
They leave their kids
to die on the road

1148
01:40:43,763 --> 01:40:46,425
My new car would've been
stained with blood

1149
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,763
Even if someone dies, you
wouldn't want your car to be stained

1150
01:40:49,837 --> 01:40:53,170
You wouldn't care for the kid's
life, but for your car stains

1151
01:40:53,307 --> 01:40:57,175
Vermin like him wander
about everywhere

1152
01:40:57,378 --> 01:41:02,179
Why should I care? Who knows,
he might be a bastard

1153
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,611
A child is God's gift,
not a bastard

1154
01:41:11,459 --> 01:41:15,190
I don't know how to thank you

1155
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,161
The kid is saved,
no need to thank me

1156
01:41:17,299 --> 01:41:20,791
I'll leave now. - How can you
leave without having tea?

1157
01:41:20,869 --> 01:41:24,600
I'll come some other day.
- Not for me, for the kid

1158
01:41:24,806 --> 01:41:28,207
For the sake of the kid.
- For his sake..? All right

1159
01:41:28,342 --> 01:41:30,310
I'll have a glass of water.
-All right.

1160
01:41:32,814 --> 01:41:34,714
Please sit.
- Ok.

1161
01:41:36,385 --> 01:41:38,250
Mummy

1162
01:41:42,658 --> 01:41:45,593
Beeba, take care of him. He
would've lost his life today

1163
01:41:45,827 --> 01:41:48,387
What..?
- He was about to come under a car

1164
01:41:48,463 --> 01:41:49,623
Are you all right?
- Yes

1165
01:41:49,831 --> 01:41:53,232
Thank the man who saved his life

1166
01:41:53,501 --> 01:42:01,670
I forgot. He's sitting outside.
Give him water, I'll make tea

1167
01:42:29,269 --> 01:42:32,261
If you even come before
my son by mistake,

1168
01:42:32,472 --> 01:42:36,841
I'll hack him to pieces,
right before you

1169
01:42:45,285 --> 01:42:49,278
What happened, Beeba? Why did you
come back? Why are you weeping?

1170
01:42:50,557 --> 01:42:54,584
He.. is Jehli. Bittu's father

1171
01:42:55,463 --> 01:42:57,522
He's Bittu's father?

1172
01:42:58,898 --> 01:43:03,335
Then you must certainly meet him.
- No, no

1173
01:43:03,403 --> 01:43:05,667
I can't meet him.
- Why not?

1174
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:12,337
If I meet him, Sardar-ji
will kill Jehli, not me

1175
01:43:12,913 --> 01:43:15,313
That's why I'm bearing this exile

1176
01:43:16,884 --> 01:43:19,250
Beeba, he saved your son.. I mean,

1177
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:23,313
he saved his son by
risking his own

1178
01:43:23,457 --> 01:43:27,325
Won't you even thank him?
Go and give him water

1179
01:43:28,496 --> 01:43:29,554
Go on

1180
01:44:01,629 --> 01:44:04,598
Who was that?
- My friend

1181
01:44:07,535 --> 01:44:10,368
And the kid?
- Her son

1182
01:44:11,572 --> 01:44:14,370
I'll leave now. Sat Sri Akal.
- Sat Sri Akal

1183
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,550
This is not happening

1184
01:44:27,455 --> 01:44:31,755
Your son.. it'll be tough to
raise him without his father

1185
01:44:33,661 --> 01:44:35,424
God will raise him

1186
01:44:36,832 --> 01:44:40,393
Beeba, don't be stubborn.
There's still time

1187
01:44:40,669 --> 01:44:42,397
Go and stop him

1188
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:45,629
I have faith in God

1189
01:44:47,774 --> 01:44:51,870
My son will take care of himself

1190
01:45:25,011 --> 01:45:30,643
I've planted a sapling
in my courtyard

1191
01:45:30,817 --> 01:45:36,414
Sitting at the door,
I watch you play

1192
01:45:36,723 --> 01:45:42,559
I've planted a sapling
in my courtyard

1193
01:45:42,897 --> 01:45:48,767
Sitting at the door,
I watch you play

1194
01:45:48,937 --> 01:45:56,742
I pine for a glimpse of you..

1195
01:45:58,078 --> 01:46:00,410
I pine for a glimpse of you..

1196
01:46:00,481 --> 01:46:03,746
all day, all night

1197
01:46:04,084 --> 01:46:06,416
Come and meet me..

1198
01:46:06,487 --> 01:46:09,547
in the dark of the night, my love

1199
01:46:09,758 --> 01:46:12,420
Come and meet me..

1200
01:46:12,494 --> 01:46:16,021
in the dark of the night, my love

1201
01:46:16,164 --> 01:46:21,500
I planted a sapling of love

1202
01:46:21,937 --> 01:46:27,500
I'm broke, empty handed

1203
01:46:28,778 --> 01:46:33,477
I planted a sapling of love

1204
01:46:33,616 --> 01:46:39,521
I'm broke, empty handed

1205
01:46:39,655 --> 01:46:47,562
Like wet wood on fire..

1206
01:46:48,997 --> 01:46:51,932
Like wet wood on fire..

1207
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,764
my life smokes unceasingly

1208
01:46:54,903 --> 01:47:00,535
You must also be missing
me every now and then

1209
01:47:00,809 --> 01:47:06,577
You must also be missing
me every now and then

1210
01:47:30,906 --> 01:47:36,538
On a tree..

1211
01:47:36,679 --> 01:47:42,743
I've hung a swing. Rock me

1212
01:47:43,185 --> 01:47:48,589
On a tree..

1213
01:47:48,724 --> 01:47:54,629
I've hung a swing. Rock me

1214
01:48:49,251 --> 01:48:54,655
There's nothing without
you in this world

1215
01:48:54,857 --> 01:49:00,693
I still have faith in God, my love

1216
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:05,665
There's nothing without
you in this world

1217
01:49:06,669 --> 01:49:12,665
I still have faith in God, my love

1218
01:49:13,276 --> 01:49:21,081
I seek just one thing..

1219
01:49:21,952 --> 01:49:24,887
I seek just one thing..

1220
01:49:24,955 --> 01:49:27,685
in the morning and at night..

1221
01:49:27,825 --> 01:49:33,695
to meet her just once
in my lifetime

1222
01:49:33,831 --> 01:49:39,736
to meet her just once
in my lifetime

1223
01:49:39,971 --> 01:49:45,910
to meet her just once
in my lifetime

1224
01:49:46,144 --> 01:49:51,707
to meet her just once
in my lifetime

1225
01:49:52,084 --> 01:49:57,716
to meet her just once
in my lifetime

1226
01:50:00,325 --> 01:50:01,758
Sardar saheb!

1227
01:50:03,162 --> 01:50:06,928
Please read this newspaper. K.B
Singh's fraud has been described

1228
01:50:07,099 --> 01:50:10,262
Cops from five states are
after him. Take a look

1229
01:50:15,341 --> 01:50:17,332
Such betrayal!

1230
01:50:24,918 --> 01:50:26,010
Mr Grewal..

1231
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:30,753
Hello? Hi, Prince Charles.
How are you?

1232
01:50:31,925 --> 01:50:33,119
Prince Charles

1233
01:50:33,827 --> 01:50:37,092
So brother, keep in mind, you are
coming on my sister's marriage

1234
01:50:37,765 --> 01:50:38,891
Yep

1235
01:50:39,934 --> 01:50:42,959
I'll talk to the queen
later on. Yep

1236
01:50:43,369 --> 01:50:45,097
Be sure, you are coming

1237
01:50:47,939 --> 01:50:49,804
Okay, I'll talk to Mr Bush

1238
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:52,775
What do you think? Should
I invite him or not?

1239
01:50:53,045 --> 01:50:55,775
Mr George Bush. President, U.S.A

1240
01:50:55,915 --> 01:50:59,043
Should I invite him? Okay,
I'll see to it

1241
01:50:59,385 --> 01:51:01,376
Bye dear. Thank you so much

1242
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:03,847
I'll be there.

1243
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:05,823
Prince Charles

1244
01:51:06,793 --> 01:51:09,956
Oh my goodness! Three missed
calls from Musharraf

1245
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:11,761
Musharraf, President of Pakistan

1246
01:51:11,965 --> 01:51:15,798
Three missed calls.
I'll call him. -Sure

1247
01:51:22,073 --> 01:51:24,303
Hi Mushi uncle. How are you?

1248
01:51:25,877 --> 01:51:29,836
Yes uncle, I'm in India.
My sister is marrying

1249
01:51:30,082 --> 01:51:36,419
Uncle, she is your niece. You
share a great relationship with dad

1250
01:51:36,488 --> 01:51:39,821
As her uncle, you are invited.
Come two days in advance

1251
01:51:39,958 --> 01:51:42,290
We have to take the gifts.
Get some fruits from Lahore

1252
01:51:42,928 --> 01:51:46,830
You know how much I love
halwa from Karachi

1253
01:51:46,966 --> 01:51:48,763
Oh yes. You are coming
two days in advance,

1254
01:51:48,835 --> 01:51:50,325
or I'm not talking to you

1255
01:51:50,837 --> 01:51:53,328
Okay Mushi uncle. Bye

1256
01:51:55,009 --> 01:51:56,874
Musharraf, President of Pakistan

1257
01:51:57,011 --> 01:51:58,069
Oh shit!

1258
01:51:58,446 --> 01:52:01,847
Have you invited your relatives?
- Yes, I have

1259
01:52:04,017 --> 01:52:05,814
Your fraternity?

1260
01:52:11,859 --> 01:52:14,191
Well..? Fraternity?

1261
01:52:19,033 --> 01:52:22,161
Yes. Fraternity

1262
01:52:24,139 --> 01:52:25,867
Fraternity of scrap dealers

1263
01:52:33,147 --> 01:52:36,310
Get up, fraud. Have
more stories to cook?

1264
01:52:37,318 --> 01:52:42,881
So Sardar-ji, for such a chap,
you refused my daughter

1265
01:52:43,491 --> 01:52:45,425
I apologise for it, Mr Grewal

1266
01:52:45,861 --> 01:52:49,888
Bad times. I was out of my mind

1267
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,230
Never mind. Let bygones be bygones

1268
01:52:55,571 --> 01:53:00,941
These punks con many great men
and put them on the wrong path

1269
01:53:03,512 --> 01:53:07,881
Where are you going? Narrate
you story, fool

1270
01:53:08,017 --> 01:53:11,145
What was your scheme?
- I.. scheme..

1271
01:53:12,254 --> 01:53:14,278
Speak!
- Don't hit me

1272
01:53:14,923 --> 01:53:18,518
Your men already thrashed me.
- So speak

1273
01:53:19,094 --> 01:53:23,292
Sardar-ji, my boss is
actually a scrap dealer

1274
01:53:24,199 --> 01:53:26,929
His sister is in love with Deep

1275
01:53:27,069 --> 01:53:30,094
You wanted to marry him
off into a rich family.

1276
01:53:30,539 --> 01:53:32,029
That's why this farce

1277
01:53:32,108 --> 01:53:35,168
Farce!
- First it was Jehli

1278
01:53:36,113 --> 01:53:37,375
Now it's Deep

1279
01:53:38,148 --> 01:53:41,948
Jehli is the one who has
afflicted this family with love

1280
01:53:42,085 --> 01:53:47,148
I say, history repeats itself.
Just go back to your prime..

1281
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,183
Bloody swine!

1282
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:53,191
Sardar-ji, no need to waste
your bullet on vermin

1283
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:55,994
My men will take care of them

1284
01:53:57,402 --> 01:53:59,893
Why don't you start
the preparations

1285
01:53:59,972 --> 01:54:02,440
for Deep and my daughter's
wedding?

1286
01:54:03,409 --> 01:54:06,970
As for Jehli, I'll
take care of him

1287
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:12,208
Help!

1288
01:54:14,052 --> 01:54:15,110
Let me go

1289
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:22,422
Help!

1290
01:54:22,595 --> 01:54:25,996
Let Pinky go. Don't kill her

1291
01:54:26,131 --> 01:54:30,158
Should I let her go?
For her love..

1292
01:54:30,235 --> 01:54:32,328
you snubbed my principles

1293
01:54:32,605 --> 01:54:35,938
You know very well that
I don't want my sons

1294
01:54:36,009 --> 01:54:38,534
to fall in love and marry

1295
01:54:38,612 --> 01:54:43,015
I hate when someone
chooses his own bride

1296
01:54:43,284 --> 01:54:49,052
You want to marry a scrap
dealer's sister and ruin my honour?

1297
01:54:51,226 --> 01:54:53,490
Dad, please let her go

1298
01:55:02,237 --> 01:55:05,297
Let Pinky go!
- Throw the girl into the machine

1299
01:55:10,645 --> 01:55:15,048
Dad, I'll forget Pinky. Please!
I'll do anything you say

1300
01:55:15,184 --> 01:55:16,276
Stop

1301
01:55:19,222 --> 01:55:21,452
He has given in.
- Congratulations, Mr Grewal

1302
01:55:21,658 --> 01:55:24,650
Prepare for the wedding. I'll
come with the entourage

1303
01:55:27,064 --> 01:55:31,057
Deep is marrying? And
I had no idea, dad?

1304
01:55:31,201 --> 01:55:35,103
Now you know, don't you?
He's marrying. Hurry up

1305
01:55:35,339 --> 01:55:37,603
Did you ask Deep?
- What's there to ask?

1306
01:55:38,075 --> 01:55:40,099
Did I ask you before
I married you off?

1307
01:55:40,243 --> 01:55:43,110
I'm your father, the
master of this house

1308
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:46,339
I decide the things that
happen in this house

1309
01:55:46,483 --> 01:55:50,078
I am also a member of
this family, daddy

1310
01:55:50,221 --> 01:55:52,280
No one even asked my suggestion

1311
01:55:52,424 --> 01:55:56,292
What did you say? You'd never
even go against my word

1312
01:55:57,429 --> 01:55:59,260
What's this you are telling me?

1313
01:56:00,099 --> 01:56:04,092
You are certainly under the influence
of that wretched woman. Bitch

1314
01:56:04,637 --> 01:56:06,127
Slut! Barren

1315
01:56:06,705 --> 01:56:08,069
Don't call me barren, daddy

1316
01:56:10,275 --> 01:56:12,470
I respect you a lot

1317
01:56:13,546 --> 01:56:16,037
But ever since I married and
came into this family..

1318
01:56:16,116 --> 01:56:19,608
you have been calling
me slut and barren

1319
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:22,054
It's perhaps the abuses from..

1320
01:56:22,122 --> 01:56:25,147
..your heart that has fallen
on my womb like a curse

1321
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:30,185
I don't have a baby, but I never
considered myself childless

1322
01:56:31,464 --> 01:56:35,195
I've reared Deep like my son.
I consider him my son

1323
01:56:35,402 --> 01:56:39,702
And I have loved Jehli as
I would love my kid brother

1324
01:56:40,241 --> 01:56:41,731
How am I barren?

1325
01:56:42,343 --> 01:56:46,143
I'm not barren, daddy. You are
the one who is childless

1326
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:48,304
Despite having three sons,

1327
01:56:48,381 --> 01:56:51,145
you could never love even
one like a father

1328
01:56:51,418 --> 01:56:55,718
I see. So the dumb have also
started speaking in this house?

1329
01:56:56,157 --> 01:56:59,320
Yes, they will. Even the dead
will rise to speak today

1330
01:57:00,161 --> 01:57:02,185
All limits have been crossed

1331
01:57:03,429 --> 01:57:06,660
You have always bossed over us

1332
01:57:07,366 --> 01:57:10,164
And we have endured it

1333
01:57:11,437 --> 01:57:15,168
You snatched Jehli's love, threw
him out of the house..

1334
01:57:15,241 --> 01:57:16,765
we bore it

1335
01:57:17,443 --> 01:57:21,641
And today, you want to snatch
my son Deep's love?

1336
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:26,183
I'm Deep's father! I'll do
whatever I want. Who are you?

1337
01:57:27,186 --> 01:57:31,179
I? I'm his foster mother

1338
01:57:32,257 --> 01:57:34,554
You have to bow before
my love for him

1339
01:57:35,794 --> 01:57:40,254
This wedding is not happening.
- Will you challenge me?

1340
01:57:50,209 --> 01:57:52,233
What happened?
- Deep met with an accident

1341
01:58:04,389 --> 01:58:05,515
What happened to bhabhi?

1342
01:58:06,823 --> 01:58:08,187
Dad hit her,

1343
01:58:09,225 --> 01:58:10,658
her head banged against a table

1344
01:58:12,396 --> 01:58:14,261
Forgive me, brother

1345
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:19,859
I could neither save
your love nor Deep's

1346
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:23,566
I couldn't even help when
you were being thrown out

1347
01:58:24,675 --> 01:58:26,575
I have raised Deep like my own son

1348
01:58:27,311 --> 01:58:30,336
Today he is being forced to marry

1349
01:58:31,415 --> 01:58:35,374
When I tried to stop it,
I got rewarded

1350
01:58:36,453 --> 01:58:38,387
A mother has lost

1351
01:58:39,423 --> 01:58:41,323
Your bhabhi has lost

1352
01:58:42,259 --> 01:58:45,456
No bhabhi, a mother never loses

1353
01:58:46,463 --> 01:58:49,261
A mother's love is the
greatest truth of life

1354
01:58:49,866 --> 01:58:54,701
I can't let this truth lose. I
won't let the wedding happen

1355
01:58:55,438 --> 01:58:56,496
Never

1356
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:28,630
Stop him

1357
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:41,416
Priest, marriages
are made in heaven

1358
01:59:42,919 --> 01:59:44,910
But you seem to take the
reins in your own hands

1359
01:59:51,495 --> 01:59:52,621
Enough!

1360
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:55,364
I've respected you enough,
I've tolerated you enough

1361
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:59,330
And in doing so, I have
sacrificed a lot of happiness

1362
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:00,834
You think I'm God?

1363
02:00:01,338 --> 02:00:04,330
I can't take your atrocities
lying down

1364
02:00:04,474 --> 02:00:09,935
I'm your father, I sired you.
How dare you rebel against me?

1365
02:00:10,014 --> 02:00:11,481
Yes, I have turned a rebel

1366
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:16,748
You've rebelled against God,
Who creates relationships

1367
02:00:16,888 --> 02:00:20,346
How dare you try to break them?
- Deep is my son

1368
02:00:20,492 --> 02:00:24,622
I have all the rights to his life.
You have walked out of the house

1369
02:00:24,763 --> 02:00:27,596
What's your problem?
- It hurts me a lot..

1370
02:00:27,666 --> 02:00:31,432
when God's plan is obstructed.
Deep is my kid brother

1371
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:36,530
If you try to ruin his happiness,
don't expect me to be in my limits

1372
02:00:36,976 --> 02:00:38,340
Guru Gobind Singh said,

1373
02:00:38,477 --> 02:00:41,002
"When the arrow strikes,
it causes agitation"

1374
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:44,975
What are you waiting for?
Kill the guardian of love

1375
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:56,324
Sardar-ji, look.. as long as the
scrap dealer's sister is alive,

1376
02:00:56,395 --> 02:00:59,420
my daughter can't marry your son

1377
02:00:59,997 --> 02:01:01,862
I tell you, let's kill her

1378
02:01:13,611 --> 02:01:15,442
Stop, Sardar-ji

1379
02:01:17,582 --> 02:01:19,982
You love to kill the
poor, don't you?

1380
02:01:20,419 --> 02:01:24,913
You dislike poor people raising
their heads up to you, right?

1381
02:01:25,858 --> 02:01:30,761
This child is a poor woman's
child. He's of my womb

1382
02:01:31,431 --> 02:01:35,458
Put him also in the fire.
Let it cool your heart

1383
02:01:35,669 --> 02:01:36,727
Kill him

1384
02:01:36,871 --> 02:01:38,463
Put him in the fire

1385
02:01:39,607 --> 02:01:40,733
No, dear

1386
02:01:43,644 --> 02:01:47,444
Wealth has blinded the tyrant.
Why lose your senses?

1387
02:01:47,581 --> 02:01:52,450
No dad, no good living anymore.
I'd rather die

1388
02:01:52,586 --> 02:01:53,882
But what's the kid's fault?

1389
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:57,715
He wants to live. He's
yours and Jehli's son

1390
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:01,684
He's the light of that family

1391
02:02:03,897 --> 02:02:06,661
What are you saying, Malkit?
- It's true, sir

1392
02:02:06,834 --> 02:02:11,464
For a heir, you went seeking
at all the holy places

1393
02:02:12,073 --> 02:02:13,938
But you were never blessed
with a grandson

1394
02:02:14,676 --> 02:02:17,611
He's your grandson. Jehli's son

1395
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:21,640
Save the light of your family.
Save him please

1396
02:02:31,493 --> 02:02:33,654
Let me have him, girl

1397
02:02:33,728 --> 02:02:35,525
Let him go!
- Back off

1398
02:02:37,666 --> 02:02:38,860
Stay put, Sardar

1399
02:02:40,101 --> 02:02:45,505
Remember the day when you refused
alliance with my daughter

1400
02:02:45,941 --> 02:02:50,503
I told you, I'll ruin your family

1401
02:02:50,779 --> 02:02:54,545
Don't be so cruel, brother.
He's my grandson

1402
02:02:55,917 --> 02:02:58,852
My heart says, my blood
runs in his veins

1403
02:02:58,987 --> 02:03:03,014
Really? A great Sardar has
such a feeble heart?

1404
02:03:03,725 --> 02:03:06,523
You ought to be happy

1405
02:03:06,661 --> 02:03:11,530
He's your son's, your enemy's, son

1406
02:03:11,666 --> 02:03:12,724
Don't, Grewal

1407
02:03:13,134 --> 02:03:15,534
He's the only hope of my family

1408
02:03:15,804 --> 02:03:18,602
I beg of you, don't kill him

1409
02:03:18,907 --> 02:03:23,503
All right, Sardar. You will
remember me for this

1410
02:03:23,813 --> 02:03:26,941
Remember, you told me
you are a businessman?

1411
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:28,878
So let's strike a deal

1412
02:03:29,719 --> 02:03:34,554
Firstly, get Deep and
my daughter married

1413
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:37,488
After that, transfer
all your properties..

1414
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:41,018
to my daughter. And
take your grandson

1415
02:03:41,664 --> 02:03:44,827
No Grewal, I don't accept
your conditions

1416
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:52,571
I know, you are a
very avaricious man

1417
02:03:53,175 --> 02:03:56,167
But now I know you are worse

1418
02:03:56,245 --> 02:03:57,735
You are a scoundrel.

1419
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:02,044
For money, you are even willing
to sacrifice you heir

1420
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:08,115
All right then, here
goes your heir

1421
02:04:15,031 --> 02:04:17,124
No, no!

1422
02:04:18,101 --> 02:04:19,966
Sardar-ji, how could this happen?

1423
02:04:42,559 --> 02:04:44,959
Singer, what are you doing here?

1424
02:04:45,229 --> 02:04:48,027
Why don't you go and
perform on the stage?

1425
02:04:48,566 --> 02:04:51,159
After I win the war of life

1426
02:04:51,334 --> 02:04:54,359
I can sing, I can
even beat the drum

1427
02:04:54,437 --> 02:04:55,495
Damn you!

1428
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:06,412
Why did you save me, dear?
You could've left me to die

1429
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:09,514
It's the punishment
for my arrogance.

1430
02:05:10,421 --> 02:05:12,981
I have been cruel to all of you

1431
02:05:13,591 --> 02:05:16,219
I have no right to live.
- No, daddy

1432
02:05:17,195 --> 02:05:19,026
We can't live without you

1433
02:05:21,166 --> 02:05:22,394
My child

1434
02:05:27,004 --> 02:05:28,130
Jehli,

1435
02:05:28,606 --> 02:05:32,167
see that no one escapes!
Clean them

1436
02:06:43,181 --> 02:06:44,375
Arrest him

1437
02:06:45,184 --> 02:06:47,481
We've been keeping an eye on you

1438
02:06:48,086 --> 02:06:52,614
After all those crimes under cover,
we've now caught you redhanded

1439
02:06:53,158 --> 02:06:56,286
You are arrested on charges
of attempted murder

1440
02:06:57,262 --> 02:06:58,320
Who informed the cops?

1441
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:03,092
I did. Unless you are arrested,
my neck would be on the line

1442
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:05,602
Cops from five states
were after me

1443
02:07:06,104 --> 02:07:08,128
Inspector, take him
to the police station

1444
02:07:08,206 --> 02:07:10,230
& churn some curd out of him

1445
02:07:12,309 --> 02:07:15,244
I'll churn curd out
of you! Officer,

1446
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:19,113
he sells adulterated
petrol, you know

1447
02:07:19,381 --> 02:07:22,441
That's exactly why my relatives
saved their factory

1448
02:07:22,585 --> 02:07:24,075
Else, it'd have gone up in smoke.

1449
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:26,120
It's my duty to protect
my relatives

1450
02:07:26,255 --> 02:07:29,247
Officer, take him away!
- How did he become your relative?

1451
02:07:29,325 --> 02:07:32,556
Get out!
- I'll fix you

1452
02:07:32,661 --> 02:07:34,424
Get out!
- Bloody scrap dealer

1453
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:37,126
Beeba, forgive me, dear

1454
02:07:38,299 --> 02:07:43,134
I've wronged you and Pinky
as well as my sons

1455
02:07:44,138 --> 02:07:48,165
Relationships built in
heaven is God's will

1456
02:07:48,743 --> 02:07:50,608
How can I break them?

1457
02:07:52,145 --> 02:07:54,477
Please forgive me, my child.
- Don't say that, daddy

1458
02:07:55,315 --> 02:07:57,078
Parents give life
to their children,

1459
02:07:57,151 --> 02:07:59,175
they have all the right over them

1460
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:06,783
Jehli, my son, I don't even have
the right to apologise to you

1461
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:11,694
Dad, I have no right to forgive.
It's the game of life

1462
02:08:12,599 --> 02:08:17,127
You've accepted the relationships
created by God, it's enough for me

1463
02:08:17,271 --> 02:08:18,567
Come, my son

1464
02:08:23,376 --> 02:08:28,177
What about K.B Singh?
He's family now

1465
02:08:28,314 --> 02:08:32,250
We must forgive his mistake.
- Wise men say that..

1466
02:08:32,318 --> 02:08:34,548
a lie told for the sake
of good, is not a lie

1467
02:08:39,458 --> 02:08:43,224
Hello? Ash, what's up?
Aishwarya Rai

1468
02:08:43,362 --> 02:08:48,197
Hi Ash. No, I can't marry you,

1469
02:08:48,333 --> 02:08:51,200
since you are carrying on
with Abhishek Bachchan

1470
02:08:51,469 --> 02:08:55,200
Amitabh saheb will mind it,
Abhishek too respects me a lot

1471
02:08:56,408 --> 02:08:59,502
Marry Abhishek, I don't mind

1472
02:08:59,645 --> 02:09:04,207
Okay. God bless you. My
blessings are with you

1473
02:09:04,651 --> 02:09:08,712
I'll marry someone else.
Never mind. Love you, Ash

1474
02:09:09,389 --> 02:09:11,186
Aishwarya Rai

1475
02:09:12,491 --> 02:09:15,551
Look, these relationships
were built in heaven

1476
02:09:16,228 --> 02:09:20,631
Now let me find one for me.
Please excuse K.B Singh

1477
02:09:22,435 --> 02:09:25,233
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding song

1478
02:09:25,371 --> 02:09:28,204
Do the bhangra and sing
the wedding song

1479
02:09:28,341 --> 02:09:31,366
For, God created this pair

1480
02:09:31,509 --> 02:09:34,410
For, God created this pair

1481
02:09:34,846 --> 02:09:38,247
For, God created this pair

1482
02:09:38,382 --> 02:09:41,407
For, God created this pair

1483
02:10:02,271 --> 02:10:05,707
Pick up a bottle of
liquor and dance

1484
02:10:08,477 --> 02:10:12,345
Liquor churns out sweet music

1485
02:10:15,550 --> 02:10:18,747
Pick up a bottle of
liquor and dance

1486
02:10:18,887 --> 02:10:22,345
Liquor churns out sweet music
