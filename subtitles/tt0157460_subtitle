1
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,991
Greetings Mr. Chaube.
- Greetings.

2
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:13,997
These are today's letters,
and these are registered.

3
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,005
This is headmaster's letter from
Bombay. You will pass from there.

4
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,604
Yes.
- Deliver it to his home on your way.

5
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:27,010
I heard you went drunk
to Kancha's wedding.

6
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:30,022
And you ate 25 ladoos(sweets)there.
- Mind your own business.

7
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:33,018
You even fell flat there.
- Are you leaving or not?

8
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,035
Greetings Master.
- Greetings.

9
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:51,775
A letter for you.

10
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,974
You should have
given it to me in school.

11
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:59,986
I did go to school. Mr. Chaube said
it's a letter for you from Bombay.

12
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,714
I should deliver it at home.
- Give.

13
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:05,980
You didn't go to school today?
- Let me sit at home sometimes.

14
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:08,982
Good day.

15
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,736
Whose letter is it?
- Meera's.

16
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,410
She has sent a proposal for Geeta.
- Is it? What has she written?

17
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:31,005
'The boy belongs to a good family.
He is related to my sister-in-law'

18
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,408
'He has done his
engineering from Germany'

19
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,420
'He has a good job,
draws a salary Rs.2000'

20
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:40,014
'lt's a good proposal for our Geeta'

21
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:43,417
'lf he likes the girl,
he doesn't want anything else'

22
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,022
'A bridge is being constructed
over the river in Madhupur'

23
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,035
'He is joining there in place
of the current executive engineer'

24
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,371
'He will reach there coming Monday'

25
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,965
'Keep a big and airy bungalow
ready for him'

26
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,374
'There should be a
garden in front of the bungalow'

27
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:02,309
'He loves flowers'

28
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,976
'lf he likes Geeta, we won't
get a better proposal than this'

29
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:12,387
'The boy is modern in outlook.
If he wishes to take Geeta out... '

30
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,392
'tell mother
not to be old fashioned... '

31
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:19,987
'and not to
avoid their meeting alone'

32
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:25,992
'The boy will like to know
Geeta. Their

33
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:30,999
meeting each other will not be wrong'
'Ask Geeta not to be

34
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:42,008
a chatterbox that she is'
'lf we lose this proposal,

35
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,423
we won't get another like him'
'Among us three sisters, Geeta's

36
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:51,417
husband will be the richest and best'
'What more do I write?

37
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,963
You are mature enough'
'Your daughter'

38
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:56,555
What say?
- She has become very mature!

39
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,366
'Tell mother not to be old fashioned'

40
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:04,372
Am I old fashioned, or you?
- Forget about us.

41
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:10,979
The boy seems to be good.
But is our Geeta so lucky?

42
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:14,380
Our Geeta is better than anyone.
She is educated till the 10th grade.

43
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,985
The boy is also an engineer.
He has taken his education aboard.

44
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,386
He will easily get a
graduate, or post-graduate girl.

45
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,321
He is rich too.

46
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:23,983
God willing,
everything will be alright.

47
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,988
I will groom Geeta.

48
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:28,996
She is young and a little immature.

49
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,000
If this proposal clicks...

50
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:34,992
It will.

51
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,403
Mr. Bhure's bungalow is lying vacant,
you ready that for him.

52
00:07:38,006 --> 00:07:42,409
And if the boy likes flowers,
Geeta will give him a bouquet

53
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:48,004
everyday.
Leave!

54
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,407
I won't spare you, I'll catch you.

55
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:53,016
Let me see where you can run away.

56
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:55,946
I will catch you.

57
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:57,355
Her chances of marriage are slim.

58
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:01,951
Caught you!

59
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:46,996
Ganpat, ask if the ticket checker if
the headmaster, Mr. Chaudhary has

60
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:53,002
come.
I want to meet the headmaster,

61
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,341
- Headmaster, someone here for you.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is my boss.

62
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,345
You?
- I have come from Bombay.

63
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,447
Are you Pitambar Chaudhary?
- Yes, come.

64
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:24,375
Is this the river on which
a bridge is to be constructed?

65
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,707
No, this is just a
pond called Neeli Jheel.

66
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,972
Such a huge pond?
This place is really very good.

67
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:34,714
Since how many years are you here?
- I was born here.

68
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:38,388
But our small village is no
comparison to Bombay.

69
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,584
No sir, this place is good.
What is there in Bombay?

70
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,394
I have a friend in Bombay.
He is not getting married.

71
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,397
When I asked him why, he said
where will he live after marriage?

72
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,400
I told him he could
live with his father-in-law.

73
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:54,996
Had said even his father-in-law
was staying with his in-laws.

74
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:56,997
Oh.

75
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:21,694
Is this the bungalow where I'll stay?
- Yes. Why? Isn't it good?

76
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:25,434
Good? I regret why I wasn't born
here.

77
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:28,028
Greetings.
- He is the gardener here.

78
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,372
Please come.
- Why do you say please?

79
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:32,773
You are so much elder to me.

80
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:34,443
And then,
you are also Meera's father.

81
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,038
Come.

82
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:44,044
Keep his luggage inside.

83
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:48,789
Go and freshen up, I'll wait.

84
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,459
Then come home with me and eat
whatever humble food we have made.

85
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:56,997
Don't worry about me. My hunger
got satiated seeing your Madhupur.

86
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,995
And then, my cook has come along.

87
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:05,007
Maharaj listen.
Masterji is inviting me for a meal.

88
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:09,409
No sir, I'll cook right away.
I have everything I need.

89
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:13,005
Ask Masterji also to eat here.
It will be ready in a jiffy.

90
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:16,008
No, I will eat at home.

91
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:19,419
Take rest, you must be tired.
I'll come in the evening.

92
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:27,428
You are a big girl now.
People will come to see you.

93
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,032
You are going to get married.
- What if he doesn't like me?

94
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:35,435
Don't say that. Why will he not?

95
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:39,769
You are educated, you look good.
You can do the house chores.

96
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:44,445
Suppose I don't like him?
- Talking nonsense again?

97
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:47,444
Your sister has written the
boy is very good.

98
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,042
If you marry me,
you will be one lucky girl.

99
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,988
Am I not lucky now?

100
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:58,990
And she has written the boy
has taken his education from abroad.

101
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:02,386
He draws a salary of Rs.2000.
- I don't want to get married.

102
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:06,398
I want to study yet.
However much one can.

103
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:10,403
Then I'll tell father to sit at home.
I will become the school headmaster.

104
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,006
Get glasses made for me.
- Shut-up! Chatter box.

105
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,001
Alright, I won't speak now. Look.

106
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:23,006
Look, be well groomed.
Always keep your hair combed.

107
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,746
Wear kohl in your eyes.
- Four, trim your hair.

108
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,013
Five, don't talk while eating.
Six, keep your eyes lowered.

109
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:34,425
Seven, don't laugh loudly.
- Shut-up! Chatter box!

110
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,020
I wouldn't wish a daughter
like you even to an enemy.

111
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:39,032
And I wish everyone
got a mother like you.

112
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:44,029
And mom, I am not your daughter,
I am your son.

113
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,032
Look, your father has come.

114
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,375
Geeta, get me a glass of water.

115
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,394
The boy is really very good.
He is so warm, so jovial, so sweet.

116
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,396
Who will say he has been
educated abroad?

117
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:14,398
Pride has not touched him.

118
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:15,990
Give.

119
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:19,998
Geeta, take a bouquet of flowers
to Bhure's bungalow today.

120
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:26,000
Did you invite him home?
- I forgot.

121
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,412
You never do anything well.

122
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:34,748
Geeta, you only invite him for tea.
And wear the saree...

123
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,011
I'll send Deepu.
He'll give the bouquet.

124
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:41,015
No dear, one must invite
the guest personally.

125
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:44,427
And wear the saree you had
bought for Divali.

126
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:51,434
Don't be naughty. Behave properly
in the engineer's presence.

127
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:54,369
He has been abroad.
He is very hot headed.

128
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:57,704
Don't climb on the mango trees
that are in the bungalow's garden.

129
00:13:57,977 --> 00:13:58,966
It's wrong.

130
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,376
And wish him good evening
as soon as you see him.

131
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,982
Stand at a distance from him.
If he says something funny...

132
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:11,715
don't show your teeth and guffaw.
- Why? I brush my teeth everyday now.

133
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,983
It's not because of the teeth.
It is improper to laugh near elders.

134
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,655
If he says something funny,
just smile. Like this.

135
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:23,990
Come.

136
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:19,979
Come Deepu. And don't laugh.

137
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,394
Are you the gardener's daughter?

138
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,991
I am headmaster, Pitambar's
youngest daughter.

139
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:37,005
I'm so sorry.
You brought flowers, so I thought...

140
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,405
Come sit... come.

141
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,410
Good evening friend.
You know English too.

142
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:48,006
Will you have tea or something cold?
- Tea.

143
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:50,610
No, we don't want anything.

144
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,353
The answer should be that until tea
is getting made, get something cold.

145
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:55,446
Yes.

146
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,947
No.

147
00:15:58,026 --> 00:16:00,358
Why were you moving your hands
while pacing the floor?

148
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:05,363
I was throwing pebbles at crows
and driving them away.

149
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,959
There are no crows here.
- There are no pebbles here either.

150
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:14,965
I was singing Raga Malkauns.
I like classical music.

151
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:19,970
The art of expressing every mood
of life is hidden in them.

152
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:21,974
Take the Yaman Raga.

153
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:27,387
When the sun sets in the evening and
the sky turns from blue to orange...

154
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:33,393
silence spreads all around,
the birds head back home...

155
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:36,986
man returns home after a
tiring day at work...

156
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,593
the way this Raga captures
the mood of the mind then...

157
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:46,396
A suppressed tone, the fast and
medium

158
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,947
pace like sun and shadow...
You don't like music?

159
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,348
- Your kind of music? No.
Then what music do you like?

160
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,945
Sing the song you had sung
on Champa's wedding.

161
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,951
Shut-up!
- Why are you getting annoyed with

162
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,961
him?
Folk songs are better than

163
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,957
any music.
They have the

164
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,958
essence of the earth in them.
Forget about music.

165
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,964
This place is very beautiful.
I visited the Neeli Jheel today.

166
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,968
The atmosphere was so silent,
with greenery all around.

167
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,370
I felt like all the notes of the
Puria Raga...

168
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,973
What other places
are worth seeing here?

169
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,980
The Shanker temple,
the swings, Jamuna garden and...

170
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,719
That banyan tree.
- Yes, the banyan at Dhauli.

171
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,721
It is a 300 year old tree.
- Is it?

172
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,987
And the gauva orchid.
- That's not a place to visit.

173
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,727
Is he your younger brother?
...Hey, sit down.

174
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,003
He's Deepu, our neighbour.

175
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,596
Which grade are you in, friend?

176
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,531
I have cleared 3rd,
I am in 4th grade now.

177
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,667
Is it? And you?
- I have given my 10th grade exams.

178
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:03,938
Good. Tell me, a dumb man wants
water.

179
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,349
How will he ask for it?
He will do this.

180
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:11,355
She's intelligent. And a blind man
wants scissors. How will he ask for

181
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,952
it?
Why? He is blind, not dumb.

182
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,363
Let's go, Deepu.
- The tea... Ramjanak...

183
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:23,363
We didn't come here to have tea.
I came to give you the flowers.

184
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:28,371
Father asked me to give them to you.
Mother has invited you home for tea.

185
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,367
The flowers are on the chair.
Put them in a vase.

186
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:35,968
Yes.

187
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:42,978
Wait... I didn't ask your name.

188
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:46,379
And my name is
Master Deepak Kumar Agnihotri.

189
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:50,986
Nice name.

190
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:52,985
Let's go.

191
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,927
Wait friend.

192
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:57,332
You didn't tell me
where your house is.

193
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:02,338
Walk straight on the broad road.
Then take a left, it's the first

194
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,940
house.
Okay friend, I'm coming for

195
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:11,937
tea in the evening.
Take, have sweets.

196
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,547
Geeta has made these sweets too.
Like them?

197
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,353
They are good. Very good.

198
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:21,947
Who do you have in your family?
- I am alone.

199
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,960
I lost my parents when young.
- Oh.

200
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,953
You are drinking tea.

201
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:32,357
Let the guest drink first.
Wonder what you teach in school.

202
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:36,370
So what? Please drink your tea.
I drink it cold.

203
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:40,373
No son, you drink first.
Geeta has made this too.

204
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,971
What happened?
Is the sugar less?

205
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,711
Go and get sugar from the kitchen.
- No...

206
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:50,576
She always puts less sugar.

207
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:55,389
I always tell her that if I take less
sugar doesn't mean the whole world

208
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,392
will.
No, the sugar...

209
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:02,987
- She must have given you his cup.
He doesn't take any sugar,

210
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:06,000
the doctor has forbidden.
Geeta, go get sugar.

211
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:09,996
You would have drank
tea with sugar now.

212
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:14,407
You didn't eat the samosas.
Geeta has made these too.

213
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,410
She makes very tasty snacks.

214
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:21,005
He thinks you don't
even know to make tea.

215
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,747
Give him sugar.
- No, I don't want sugar.

216
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,011
Why are you feeling shy? Take it.

217
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:29,420
No, there is already
too much sugar in it.

218
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:38,431
Look. All this has been done by
Geeta.

219
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:42,434
She knows a lot.
- She is very good.

220
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:45,028
She even sews and knits well.

221
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,034
See that picture? That swan.
Geeta has made even that.

222
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:54,981
But Meera had made that one.
- Shut-up, you know nothing.

223
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:59,976
Take, eat paan.
- Geeta must have made even this.

224
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:12,991
But why are you telling me all this?
- What's the harm in seeing?

225
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,995
Geeta has given her 10th grade exams.

226
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,396
Geeta, show him your drawing album.

227
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:24,602
Don't bother now.
Leave some excuse for my next visit.

228
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:28,409
You can come whenever you want.
Consider this your home.

229
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:33,418
Aunt, you have taught Geeta so much,
haven't you taught her to sing?

230
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,617
She can sing too. I have told her
father to buy a harmonium for her.

231
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:41,016
But he never remembers.

232
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:45,022
It's not that.
Actually, I never thought about it.

233
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:49,432
And then, Geeta never has time
to spare from her naughtiness.

234
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:55,370
She is like that.
Who is not naughty in their

235
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:59,375
childhood.
Mom, can I go to bed?

236
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:05,973
Enough now, sir. It's five O'clock.

237
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:16,374
Good evening friend.

238
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:22,382
Nice bouquet. Come in.
- Take this.

239
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:23,982
Oh yes, I forgot.

240
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:30,990
Come. I'll show you something new.

241
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,993
One, two, three.

242
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,342
What do you think?
- About what?

243
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:46,404
Don't you feel like singing
on seeing the harmonium?

244
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:51,009
Cover it up soon.
Hearing it, the crows may start

245
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:53,020
cawing.
Not driving the crows away today?

246
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:54,947
I'll drive them away now.

247
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,951
This crow is called Raga Malkauns.

248
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:10,962
Have mercy on the crows.
Where will the poor souls go?

249
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:16,376
"Maiden, your village is beautiful"

250
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:21,381
"I'm charmed to death
having come here"

251
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:26,645
"Moreover, is your innocent beauty"

252
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:31,391
"Like a crescent moon,
is your half bloomed youth"

253
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:10,954
"I feel like tying
anklets to the peacock's feet.

254
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:20,964
"And gifting the cuckoo flowers"

255
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:28,980
"To build his nest here,
the bird collects twigs"

256
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:15,359
"Colourful flowers have bloomed"

257
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:19,362
"Even the people here are like
flowers"

258
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:28,372
"Once one comes here,
how can he ever leave?

259
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:33,968
"The gushing
waterfalls charm my heart"

260
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,971
"There is no place like this"

261
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:41,384
"Moreover,
is your innocent beauty..."

262
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:25,953
"No one accepts a stranger so warmly"

263
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:35,370
"I have bonded with you like I share
an age old relationship with you"

264
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:39,364
"Lost in their world..."

265
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:43,969
"the people here speak from the
heart"

266
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:48,974
"Maiden, your village is beautiful"

267
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,362
Saved. Look, the two crows
are still sitting there.

268
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,956
Had they flown away,
you would have cursed me.

269
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,695
Will you teach me
to play the harmonium?

270
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,962
Sure, but your turn is second.
I'll first teach Geeta.

271
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,974
No, I don't want to learn.

272
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:50,374
Stay.
Won't you invite me to tea today?

273
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,467
No.

274
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,911
No problem, I'll come
without an invitation.

275
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:56,916
Mom has invited you to dinner.
- And what did your father say?

276
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:59,248
He said we'll go for
a stroll in the evening.

277
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,311
Me and the headmaster?

278
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:02,911
Come Deepu.

279
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,933
Did you write to Meera?
- Oh! I forgot.

280
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:25,342
I'll write to her tomorrow.

281
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:28,937
Who will say it is just
a few days since he came here.

282
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:30,346
He seems like a close relative.

283
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:35,345
Wherever one may be, at home, or a
jungle, whether alone, or with

284
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:39,356
someone...
if he has the knowledge of music,

285
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,951
then the Bhairavi in the morning...
Raga Deepak in the afternoon, & there

286
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:45,964
are many for the evening, like...
Do house chores in the morning,

287
00:29:46,032 --> 00:29:49,365
If in school, then do homework...
cooking and washing in the afternoon,

288
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:51,969
Like picking flowers,
making a bouquet...

289
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:54,973
& coming to the bungalow with Deepu.
- What?

290
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:57,976
Did you like today's song?
- Yes, that one was good.

291
00:29:58,044 --> 00:30:01,980
But when is this sung?
- Such songs have no timing.

292
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:04,710
You can sing them
whenever a Geeta is around you.

293
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:38,007
Okay? Go.

294
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:43,418
Ram Singh, didn't have any problem?
- No sir, only a flat tyre twice.

295
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:45,421
Is it changed now?
- It's perfect now.

296
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:51,620
Sir, senior boss has not come?
- He has gone to Delhi.

297
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,957
Go take rest. Is the tank full?
- No sir.

298
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:58,960
Alright, I'll fill it.

299
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:02,972
I am leaving.
Tell Mr. Raman to manage.

300
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:40,738
Geeta, what's going on?

301
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:43,741
Aunt, that bungalow guy
sings like that.

302
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:46,414
You keep quiet.
Don't you dare tease anyone again.

303
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:49,008
Deepu, go home.

304
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:53,951
Are you crazy? You are teasing
the one you are going to marry?

305
00:31:54,357 --> 00:31:56,951
Deepu asked me
to show him how he sang.

306
00:31:57,027 --> 00:31:58,688
Deepu told you so you did it?
Are you Deepu's age?

307
00:31:58,962 --> 00:32:00,690
What do I do if
I don't like his singing?

308
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:02,954
Don't do anything,
just sit quiet for some time.

309
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:05,364
The girl has an answer to everything.

310
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:10,632
You! Come.
Geeta, go and freshen up and change.

311
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,964
Come. Sit down.

312
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,308
Will you have tea, or something cold?
- Deepu?

313
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:18,972
Until you make the tea,
get something cold.

314
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:22,984
What?
- Don't worry, I don't want anything.

315
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:26,988
Aunt, he has a jeep.
We drove here in that.

316
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:28,580
Go see what Geeta is doing.

317
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:33,325
My jeep has come.
I thought I'll come and visit you.

318
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:36,387
We can even go for a drive.
- Sure.

319
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,398
Uncle has not come home yet?

320
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,400
I met him on the way.
He was honking.

321
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:49,409
I wondered who it was. I turned and
it was the one who drives away crows.

322
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:53,003
And you brought him here.
- I didn't.

323
00:32:57,952 --> 00:33:01,547
What is Deepu doing? Deepu!
- Why? Do you want something?

324
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:03,685
No, I was just...

325
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:07,359
I'll tell him to teach me to drive.

326
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,953
No. If you meet him again,
don't bring him here.

327
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,965
Why?
- What why?

328
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,694
I have to take
flowers for him everyday.

329
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:16,959
If he comes home, I have
freshen up and change for him.

330
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:20,973
So what? I will learn to drive,
and you learn to sing from him.

331
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:25,968
Why is Geeta not coming.
- I'll call her.

332
00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:47,398
Want to hear a song?
- Song? No.

333
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:51,994
Why? That day's song was bad?
- You sang well that day.

334
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,004
Wonder if always...

335
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,939
Even you will learn to sing well
one day. Right Deepu?

336
00:33:56,342 --> 00:33:58,333
When will you teach me to drive?

337
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:11,684
This is Ram Ka Tila. When Ram
had come here during his exile...

338
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:15,950
I'm in exile here. Wonder how
many days I'll have to stay here.

339
00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:19,954
Where will you go from here?
- Wherever destiny takes me.

340
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,966
So destiny brought you here?
- Ofcourse.

341
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:26,630
Or who knew that in such a big India,
whose population is 5.5 million...

342
00:34:26,972 --> 00:34:29,372
there is a
small village called Madhupur.

343
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:32,603
Where Pitambar Chaudhary
is a headmaster...

344
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:35,969
and his third daughter, Geeta,
who is not married yet...

345
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:38,982
a groom is being searched for
her since the last three years.

346
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:40,981
You know a groom
is being searched for me?

347
00:34:41,186 --> 00:34:47,591
No, I don't, but am I wrong?
- Wrong! It's me who has to get

348
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:49,983
married.
Not anyone else.

349
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:51,392
- You mean you won't marry?
No.

350
00:34:51,496 --> 00:34:53,930
- Until when?
Till whenever I wish. I have just

351
00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:56,323
given my 10th grade exam yet.
Wonder what will happen,

352
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:59,335
I am scared.
Why fear? Trust me.

353
00:34:59,537 --> 00:35:01,664
- What will you do?
I'll marry.

354
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,669
- Marry who?
The one who is scared.

355
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:05,933
- Who is scared?
You just said you are scared.

356
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:10,540
I said that about my exams.
My arithmetic paper was bad.

357
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:13,348
Oh. I thought you
are afraid of marriage.

358
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:16,351
I am pleased to know you
are not afraid of marriage.

359
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:27,624
There is an auspicious day in
the month of August.

360
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:31,958
Alright. We have more than a month,
we can make all arrangements.

361
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,962
He just dropped in yesterday.
He got a jeep.

362
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:38,967
I didn't know what to do.

363
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:42,969
And Geeta,
she was up to her old antics.

364
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,371
Her hair was unkept,
she wasn't wearing good clothes.

365
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,581
The boy is really very mixing.

366
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:51,977
We'll fix the wedding for 15th
August.

367
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:54,318
I'll even start writing
to our relatives.

368
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:58,917
Get some sweets for home.
Wonder when he will drop in again.

369
00:35:59,328 --> 00:36:00,920
I have to offer him something.

370
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:05,331
He doesn't come here to eat sweets.
Consider him your son-in-law now.

371
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:09,928
Offer whatever you have at home.
- Indeed!

372
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:13,934
When you were the son-in-law, didn't
you make my family treat you well?

373
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,963
"Come when the lamps are lit"

374
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:50,968
"Come when the evening sets"

375
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:08,588
"Don't forget our promise of meeting"

376
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:13,332
"Don't forget my love"

377
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:57,901
"I'll keep watching
the path you come from"

378
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:02,904
"I'll keep waiting for you"

379
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:23,929
"Come wearing the kohl of
my love in your eyes"

380
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:28,932
"Come when the lamps are lit"

381
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:03,306
"Where we met the first time"

382
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:08,902
"The place we started
walking together from"

383
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:29,925
"Come under the mango tree
near the same river bank"

384
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:34,928
"Come when the lamps are lit"

385
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:14,366
"They meet morning and evening"

386
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:25,386
"They meet morning and evening"

387
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:30,982
"Seeing them, the stars appear"

388
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:52,006
"They meet
and tell each other to come"

389
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:56,943
"Come when the lamps are lit"

390
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:59,935
Deepu, do you know,
I am going to get married.

391
00:42:00,013 --> 00:42:03,346
With whom?
- What whom? With some boy.

392
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,941
Mom and aunt married a girl.

393
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:08,944
But I will marry a boy.

394
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,683
Will we have guests?
- Yes.

395
00:42:10,957 --> 00:42:14,358
Then it will be fun. Will the
groom come on a horse or an elephant?

396
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:16,350
In a jeep.

397
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:25,959
Aunt.

398
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:31,374
Aunt, give me food.
- Take a wash.

399
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:34,969
What has Geeta cooked today?

400
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:38,381
I have cooked everything today.

401
00:42:39,385 --> 00:42:43,719
Deepu, come and eat with us.
- No. What if mom scolds me?

402
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:46,389
She won't scold you.
I'll tell your mother. Come.

403
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:49,392
I won't come at night.
- Why?

404
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:51,986
I have to go to
Janakpur for inspection.

405
00:42:52,064 --> 00:42:54,327
I'll get late returning from there.
- Your lunch has come.

406
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:57,928
Deepu, go wash your hands and come.

407
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:03,666
There is a fair on in Janakpur.

408
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:05,341
Tell me what I should
bring for you from the fair.

409
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:07,934
Don't complain later.
- Why should I complain?

410
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:09,673
You don't need to get anything.

411
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:13,952
You must be wishing I'll take you
along so you can shop yourself.

412
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:17,945
As if you know what I wish for.
I have been to the fair many times.

413
00:43:18,022 --> 00:43:19,284
I don't want to go.

414
00:43:19,357 --> 00:43:21,291
Even I won't get
time to go to the fair.

415
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,296
Though I'll get you Revadi.
Should I get Revadi or sweets?

416
00:43:26,364 --> 00:43:27,353
Sweets.

417
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:30,960
You like Revadi that is
why you want to get it for us.

418
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,370
Eat. Check if the salt is okay.

419
00:43:37,374 --> 00:43:40,366
It's okay.
- I'm talking of salt in the

420
00:43:40,477 --> 00:43:41,466
vegetable.
Check and tell me.

421
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,978
Aunt, when you have cooked,
it must be good.

422
00:43:44,982 --> 00:43:47,974
But do teach your darling
daughter to cook.

423
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:50,376
She has grown up,
she will get married soon now.

424
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:54,321
What will her in-laws's say?
- Mom look, he's after me again.

425
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:57,257
Atleast I taught you to sing.

426
00:43:57,327 --> 00:44:00,524
I thought she must be grateful.
Instead, she is cursing me.

427
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:05,925
Why should I care? When your in-law's
taunt you, you'll realise then.

428
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,936
Greetings. Your letter.

429
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,280
It's from Bombay.
- It must be Meera's.

430
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,944
Sir, there is a letter for you too.
Should I give it to you here?

431
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,954
Yes.
- Take.

432
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,959
Geeta, come over tomorrow evening.

433
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:33,952
Get a nice bouquet.
You bring the same flowers everyday.

434
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:46,365
Go and practice the new tune
on the harmonium in the evening.

435
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,375
You have to learn four lessons yet.

436
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,970
And do you remember anything? The
tiffin is lying there since so many

437
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,306
days
Take it from Ramjanak when you leave.

438
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:00,911
Mom, I'll get the tiffin.
While returning, I'll meet Deepu.

439
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,923
I haven't gone there since many days.
Shall I go?

440
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:03,980
Okay.

441
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:11,330
Aunt, I'll come tomorrow night.
Make the Kheer you made that day.

442
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:27,346
Is everything alright?
How is Meera?

443
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:33,943
Meera is alright, but...
- What is the matter?

444
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,949
What happened?

445
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:52,370
Will you say something?

446
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:59,311
Meera has written the engineer boy
is coming here coming Monday.

447
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:02,905
He had left for Delhi for some work.
- What!!

448
00:46:02,983 --> 00:46:09,319
Sunil, the engineer boy for Geeta,
has not come here.

449
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:11,649
Then who is he?
- I don't know.

450
00:46:12,592 --> 00:46:16,926
She says the company's
overseer must have reached there.

451
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:21,923
What are you saying!
He is not Sunil Kishin?

452
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,332
I don't know.

453
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:27,337
Had you asked him his name?
- No.

454
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:29,334
I am fed up of you!

455
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:32,934
How was I to know he is not the boy?

456
00:46:33,346 --> 00:46:36,338
Wonder who he is and our daughter
is roaming around with him.

457
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,948
Even this boy is good.
If you like, with him only...

458
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:41,543
What are you saying!

459
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:46,356
What are you waiting for now? Go and
get her, she has gone to his

460
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,357
bungalow.
And listen. Don't tell the boy

461
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:55,899
anything. Just bring Geeta home.
Listen! You haven't heard

462
00:46:56,001 --> 00:47:00,301
the whole thing yet.
Don't scold her in the boy's

463
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,906
What are you waiting for now?
Go soon!

464
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:07,310
Alright, I'll sing again.

465
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,658
No... no... I mean,
you have learnt, but...

466
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:29,661
I can't do better than this.
- Why can't you?

467
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:33,335
There was a time when there were
no horses in the world, only asses.

468
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:36,600
Then they were trained.
They were made horses.

469
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:39,341
Nowadays, in big cities,
there are horse races too.

470
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:42,344
Am I an ass? You are
training me to become a horse?

471
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,347
Why should you be an ass?
You are Geeta.

472
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,351
You can sing very well.
And who a boy named Vinod...

473
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:52,946
Why did you fall silent?
- Shall I say it now?

474
00:47:54,225 --> 00:47:55,886
And who a boy named Vinod...

475
00:47:56,894 --> 00:48:01,297
Come in, uncle.
- Geeta come, your mother has called

476
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:04,560
you
I've been asking her to go,

477
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:07,301
but she is not leaving.
She wants to learn to sing now.

478
00:48:07,904 --> 00:48:11,567
- When did I say that?
Here's your tiffin. Go.

479
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:15,901
I want to go to the fair in Janakpur.
That fair is no good. It's just a

480
00:48:21,918 --> 00:48:23,909
market place for cows and buffaloes.
Wait uncle, I'll drop you in my jeep.

481
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,914
It's not necessary,
I have some work on my way.

482
00:48:27,257 --> 00:48:28,246
Come Geeta.

483
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:42,336
Geeta... you don't have
to go to the bungalow at all.

484
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,329
Alright, I won't go.

485
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:47,932
Did that boy...

486
00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:52,675
What is his name?

487
00:48:54,883 --> 00:49:00,287
His name? See how smart he is.
He asked my and Deepu's name.

488
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:03,290
He didn't give his name.
I'll ask him tomorrow and tell you.

489
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:06,292
Don't bother.
You don't have to ask.

490
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:13,891
Geeta, this boy is not that engineer.

491
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:15,903
Okay mom, you go and sleep.

492
00:49:17,906 --> 00:49:20,305
He is not the engineer
who had to come here.

493
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:24,309
Who had to come here?
- About who Meera had written to us.

494
00:49:26,314 --> 00:49:30,307
Then who is he?
- Who knows? Some overseer.

495
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:35,321
Meera sent a letter.
The engineer boy is coming on Monday.

496
00:49:35,423 --> 00:49:36,412
Day after tomorrow.

497
00:49:38,326 --> 00:49:43,320
His name is Sunil Kishin.
Meera wrote to us about him.

498
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:45,931
Your father also has his
hopes pinned on that boy.

499
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:50,335
We want you to get married
into a good home.

500
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:55,341
What is done is done.
Don't go there from tomorrow.

501
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:57,671
I have many singing lessons to
learn from him yet.

502
00:49:57,944 --> 00:50:00,344
What singing?
- He is teaching me to sing.

503
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,436
And also to play the harmonium.

504
00:50:01,548 --> 00:50:02,947
There is no need for
you to learn anything.

505
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:04,950
He teaches very well.

506
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:08,351
You don't have to meet him
even for a day now.

507
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:11,355
Sunil Kishin is coming in two days,
what will he think?

508
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:15,359
What will he think?
- God! Wonder when you'll get mature.

509
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:17,953
Just do what I am telling you.

510
00:51:14,352 --> 00:51:15,944
Hello uncle.
- Hello.

511
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,681
Our engineer is coming by this train.
- Is it?

512
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:19,946
Who have you come to receive?
- I... l...

513
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,709
Did you get my report?
- Yes.

514
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:46,574
It seems the
work is going smooth here.

515
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:47,973
You?

516
00:51:48,052 --> 00:51:50,987
He is uncle, I mean, the headmaster
of the school here, Mr. Chaudhary

517
00:51:51,055 --> 00:51:53,318
We got a lovely bungalow
to stay in with his help.

518
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:55,915
What are you waiting for?
Pick up the luggage.

519
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:58,317
Uncle, I will come in the evening.
Come sir.

520
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:02,330
He has come for me.
He is Meera's father.

521
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:04,332
Oh yes.

522
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:08,327
Uncle, are you alright?

523
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:15,343
Look sir, Ram ka Tila.

524
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:19,347
When Lord Ram was exiled,
he had stayed here.

525
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:26,945
Careful Vinod.

526
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,358
Uncle, where do I drop you?
School, or at home?

527
00:52:32,962 --> 00:52:35,954
You come to our house.
The journey must have tired you.

528
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:39,364
Thank you, uncle. But I have to
visit the project sight today.

529
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:41,960
I will get many more opportunities
to come to your home later.

530
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:46,303
Don't worry about the project, sir.
The work is running smoothly there.

531
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,969
Let us go and have
tea at uncle's place.

532
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:50,978
Vinod, it is not good to
have too much tea.

533
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,035
Why?

534
00:52:52,114 --> 00:52:55,311
Do you know, tea is a kind of
slow poison. It works slowly.

535
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:59,115
Good it works slowly.
Who is in a hurry to die?

536
00:52:59,922 --> 00:53:04,325
Let's go. Aunt not only offers
tea, but also sweets and snacks.

537
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:07,928
Right uncle?
- No Vinod, we'll see the project

538
00:53:07,997 --> 00:53:14,333
today
Okay, we'll do that. But we'll drop

539
00:53:17,939 --> 00:53:20,339
uncle home, & meet aunt for a minute.
Looks like the station is

540
00:53:20,942 --> 00:53:22,534
quite far from the village.
The station should be

541
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:24,935
close to the village.
No sir, the

542
00:53:25,947 --> 00:53:27,539
station is okay where it is.
It should be close to

543
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:37,947
the railway tracks.
Come.

544
00:53:38,026 --> 00:53:39,015
Come sir.

545
00:53:46,968 --> 00:53:47,956
She's Geeta's mother.

546
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:56,308
Sir, she is aunt.
- Your name is Sunil?

547
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,399
Yes.

548
00:53:57,511 --> 00:53:59,502
Our Meera's sister-in-law's...
- Nephew.

549
00:53:59,913 --> 00:54:03,246
Come in.
- Not now, I'll come some other time.

550
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:05,251
Consider it your home.
Come in.

551
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:08,311
See! You won't get an aunt
like her in the world.

552
00:54:08,922 --> 00:54:10,583
Come.
- But...

553
00:54:10,924 --> 00:54:15,327
Aunt, make the sweets, and snacks
which you, I mean, Geeta makes.

554
00:54:15,429 --> 00:54:16,919
Sure. Come in.

555
00:54:18,332 --> 00:54:19,924
Where did Geeta go?

556
00:54:22,936 --> 00:54:25,928
Aunt, ask Geeta to come out.
You have guests at home.

557
00:54:26,006 --> 00:54:27,336
Wonder where she is hiding.

558
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,429
Geeta.

559
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:36,941
Geeta, he is our engineer,
Sunil Kishin. Say hello.

560
00:54:37,283 --> 00:54:38,272
Hello.

561
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:41,351
He has done his engineering
from Germany.

562
00:54:41,954 --> 00:54:45,287
He was in Europe for 4-5 years. He's
been in India for the last three

563
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,293
years.
He's executive engineer,

564
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:50,693
incharge, construction. Though...
Vinod, will you only

565
00:54:50,963 --> 00:54:53,898
praise me, or...
She is Geeta. She has just

566
00:54:53,966 --> 00:54:59,302
given her 10th grade exams.
Her arithmetic paper was bad,

567
00:54:59,905 --> 00:55:01,497
so she fears she may flunk.
She is learning music.

568
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:04,235
She is covering up her shortcoming
of arithmetic with singing...

569
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,301
so that she gets a good groom...
- Is that why I am learning to sing?

570
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:09,311
Look mom...
- Shh!

571
00:55:09,914 --> 00:55:12,906
But even her singing
is like her arithmetic.

572
00:55:12,984 --> 00:55:15,316
Though it's different
if I okay her singing.

573
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,649
Pleased to meet you all.

574
00:55:17,922 --> 00:55:19,651
Though Meera had told me.

575
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:22,916
How does Meera know
my arithmetic paper was bad?

576
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:28,330
Not about your paper, but about here;
about Madhupur, you, your parents.

577
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:31,329
Let's leave now, Vinod.
We will come in the evening.

578
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:34,336
Look, our engineer
has come from abroad.

579
00:55:34,939 --> 00:55:39,342
Aunt, until you don't ask him to
have tea now atleast twice...

580
00:55:39,444 --> 00:55:42,936
he will leave without tea. Coming
in the evening is just an excuse.

581
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,939
It's not like that.
- Stay. Have tea and go.

582
00:55:47,351 --> 00:55:49,945
You didn't even ask him to sit.
- Sit down, sir.

583
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,352
Geeta, you sit here, I'm coming.

584
00:55:57,895 --> 00:56:00,295
Why did you bring Vinod along?
- What could I do? He came on his

585
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:14,571
own.
I'd say the whole family is nice.

586
00:56:14,912 --> 00:56:18,643
And Geeta is just like a kid.
She's the same in and out.

587
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:20,315
If she gets angry, she'll blurt out.

588
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:23,249
If she finds something funny,
she'll giggle like flowing water.

589
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:26,311
And where naughtiness is concerned,
she's worst than Deepu.

590
00:56:26,656 --> 00:56:29,921
She fights even for a
small piece of tamarind.

591
00:56:30,326 --> 00:56:32,920
I found her quiet, silent.

592
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:36,931
Only in your presence, sir.
Because even you are the silent

593
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:40,526
types.
Just wait for a few days.

594
00:56:41,938 --> 00:56:44,338
She will run away with your glasses.
She imitates how I sing.

595
00:56:45,942 --> 00:56:48,934
However she is, I liked her.

596
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:50,935
Me too.

597
00:56:51,948 --> 00:56:53,882
I can't do it.
- Go give him and come.

598
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:56,877
Don't act adamant.
What will Sunil think?

599
00:56:57,286 --> 00:56:59,220
You asked me to make the bouquet,
I made it.

600
00:56:59,288 --> 00:57:01,278
I don't like to go and give
a bouquet everyday.

601
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,890
As if you have gone 10 times
to give him a bouquet.

602
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:06,894
I gave Vinod.
- Vinod and Sunil are not one.

603
00:57:06,962 --> 00:57:08,293
I'm not going.

604
00:57:08,897 --> 00:57:13,630
Alright, Deepu will hold the bouquet,
you just go with him.

605
00:57:13,902 --> 00:57:15,893
Let's go, we'll give
the bouquet to Vinod.

606
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:18,303
Shut-up! Give the bouquet to Sunil.

607
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:20,096
Come Deepu.

608
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:28,315
Invite him to tea. Talk softly.
And don't stand there with a glum

609
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:14,292
face.
There is no one here.

610
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:30,307
Let's go, Deepu.
- Sit down.

611
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:33,902
Where is Vinod?
- Why? Are you friends with him?

612
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,313
He used to teach me to drive.
- Even I'll teach you.

613
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,246
You know to drive?
- Yes.

614
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:42,914
You know to play the harmonium?
- Only Vinod knows that.

615
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,923
Geeta, you learn from Vinod only.

616
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:49,326
Do you like to sing?
Why don't you sit down?

617
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:52,329
No, we have to go.
- Won't you invite him to tea?

618
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:55,866
Come home in the evening for tea.
Mom has invited you.

619
00:58:55,934 --> 00:59:00,871
Bring Vinod along.
- Where will you go? I'll escort you.

620
00:59:00,939 --> 00:59:03,601
We'll go by jeep?
- No, Vinod has taken the jeep.

621
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:04,865
Let's go.

622
00:59:18,891 --> 00:59:21,883
Who made this bouquet?
- Geeta.

623
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,292
These are Dusseldorfs.
They grow in Germany.

624
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:28,890
Big flowers grow there,
and every bouquet...

625
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:31,902
"Come when the lamps are lit"

626
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:37,306
"Come when the evening sets"

627
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:43,904
"Don't forget our promise of meeting"

628
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:48,912
"Don't forget my love"

629
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,331
Why do you bother? We will go.
Come home in the evening.

630
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,338
Vinod is so good.
He even sings.

631
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,942
And he talks so well.
- Even you like Vinod?

632
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,008
Yes.

633
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,364
You are back, Vinod?

634
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,370
Do you need the jeep?
- No.

635
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,972
Ram Singh, park the jeep.
Come tomorrow at 9 am.

636
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:50,308
Come sir. Had Geeta come?
- Yes, but how do you know?

637
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,313
This bouquet is from her garden.

638
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:54,906
Today's work is over?
- Yes sir.

639
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,316
The kiln work is over.
Even the cement allotment

640
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,911
Was Deepu with her?
- Yes. And the labour tender?

641
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:04,323
All tenders have come. I think we
should give the job to Banwarilal.

642
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:05,916
He is an old hand.

643
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,327
And then, he has supplied labour
to 5-6 government projects.

644
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,924
You went to Geeta's home?
- No, I escorted her to the street.

645
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,937
She seemed lost.

646
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:20,669
Her arithmetic paper was bad,
so she is worried she will flunk.

647
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,935
Mr. Mishra from the PWD
was supposed to come.

648
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,940
I did meet him,
but he is against Banwarilal.

649
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,945
He was saying he will supply
100 men, and make a bill of 300 men.

650
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:35,956
From 300, how much will you deduct?
100 at most.

651
01:01:36,024 --> 01:01:37,958
We'll still make a loss of 100.

652
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,953
Geeta must have invited you for tea.
- Yes, she did.

653
01:01:43,031 --> 01:01:45,966
I told you,
they are very warm people.

654
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:50,563
Then we both will go.
And sir, if we stay a little longer

655
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:55,306
...
they will ask us to have dinner too.

656
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:59,905
Aunt can cook better than Ramjanak.
What was Mr. Mishra saying? We should

657
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:02,908
give the contract to someone else?
Yes. He always supports

658
01:02:03,317 --> 01:02:08,913
Mr. Dhajadhari Singh.
Dhajadhari Singh. The name gives

659
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:12,322
But he's a thin, short man.

660
01:02:12,926 --> 01:02:16,919
His clothes are dirty, and so is he.

661
01:02:18,932 --> 01:02:21,332
So should I ask
Ramjanak not to cook dinner?

662
01:02:21,935 --> 01:02:27,931
Vinod, do you really sing well?
- Why? Geeta said so?

663
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,339
Not Geeta, Deepu.

664
01:02:31,945 --> 01:02:33,344
I'll go take a bath.

665
01:02:49,962 --> 01:02:52,954
Mr. Chaudhary gave us a good treat
for celebrating Sunil's arrival.

666
01:02:59,305 --> 01:03:02,297
The food was good.
- We ate a lot today.

667
01:03:03,309 --> 01:03:07,507
Vinod, we had dinner here.
Even we must return the favour.

668
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:11,644
Yes sir, invite them to our home.
Even Ramjanak cooks well.

669
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:14,909
We will do that.
But everyone praises your singing.

670
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:15,976
Why don't you...

671
01:03:16,322 --> 01:03:21,259
Sure... I have an idea.
Geeta, I'll test you today.

672
01:03:21,327 --> 01:03:25,922
Get ready. Sir, we'll call for
the harmonium from the bungalow.

673
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:30,332
Uncle, hear how Geeta sings.
You'll be surprised.

674
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:33,927
We'll keep the harmonium here.
If you could...

675
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:05,892
"With my notes..."

676
01:04:11,909 --> 01:04:16,312
"if you merge your notes,
if you sing along with me..."

677
01:04:16,513 --> 01:04:20,916
"my life will be made"

678
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:23,309
"If my heart's..."

679
01:04:29,326 --> 01:04:33,319
"home you make,
if you give me your heart..."

680
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:38,925
"our union will prove successful"

681
01:05:26,915 --> 01:05:30,316
"In moonlit nights..."

682
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,321
"hand in hand"

683
01:05:46,935 --> 01:05:54,865
"may we be lost in
each other's sweet talks"

684
01:05:56,878 --> 01:05:58,868
"If with me..."

685
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:08,878
"you smile, you sing"

686
01:06:08,956 --> 01:06:13,893
"my life will be made"

687
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:25,886
"Why from the springs..."

688
01:07:26,898 --> 01:07:29,890
"should we beg for happiness?"

689
01:07:41,313 --> 01:07:48,913
"Why should we not together
make our lives"

690
01:07:50,922 --> 01:07:52,913
"If in my path..."

691
01:07:58,863 --> 01:08:02,856
"you light lamps,
there will be brightness..."

692
01:08:03,267 --> 01:08:07,863
"our union will prove successful"

693
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:46,899
Shameless! He walks in anytime.

694
01:08:50,914 --> 01:08:51,903
Come in.

695
01:08:56,853 --> 01:08:58,844
It's you? Please come in.

696
01:08:58,922 --> 01:09:02,858
I just walked in.
- Come in any time.

697
01:09:02,926 --> 01:09:05,861
I'll call Vinod too,
he must have returned from work.

698
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:11,264
Why do you worry? He'll come
if he wants to. Come, sit down.

699
01:09:11,867 --> 01:09:14,859
Eat these snacks.
Geeta has made them.

700
01:09:15,871 --> 01:09:17,463
Mom, I am going to the bazaar.

701
01:09:17,873 --> 01:09:23,277
Sit here. We have a guest at home.
And you want to go out. Go later.

702
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:25,879
Wait for some time, even I have to
leave. I'll drop you to the bazaar.

703
01:09:25,948 --> 01:09:26,937
Okay.

704
01:09:30,886 --> 01:09:33,616
Have you ever gone to Bombay
to Meera's home?

705
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:36,289
No.
- You must be writing to her.

706
01:09:36,892 --> 01:09:38,291
Yes, sometimes.

707
01:09:38,894 --> 01:09:42,887
She asked me to write to her
as soon as I reached Madhupur.

708
01:09:43,499 --> 01:09:46,297
What do I write to her?
- Tell her we are fine.

709
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:50,894
That I will. But I have to write
your consent or refusal too.

710
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:55,298
Are you aware of what Meera
has written about you and me?

711
01:09:58,913 --> 01:10:00,312
What is your reply?

712
01:10:05,586 --> 01:10:07,315
Tell me some other time.

713
01:10:07,922 --> 01:10:12,325
Let's go for a picnic this Sunday.
Tell me over there.

714
01:10:16,931 --> 01:10:18,523
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

715
01:10:18,933 --> 01:10:22,334
I have work, I am going out. Take
Mr. Sunil to the sight when he comes.

716
01:10:22,937 --> 01:10:25,337
If he asks about me, tell him
I'll come there directly. Okay?

717
01:10:32,946 --> 01:10:33,935
Aunt.

718
01:10:36,349 --> 01:10:37,338
You stay here.

719
01:10:40,954 --> 01:10:42,683
Hello aunt.
- What work do you have?

720
01:10:42,956 --> 01:10:44,355
What have you cooked today?

721
01:10:45,959 --> 01:10:48,951
What is the matter,
everything seems silent today.

722
01:10:49,362 --> 01:10:53,560
Where is the headmaster? And where is
Geeta? She's not met me since two

723
01:10:53,633 --> 01:10:56,898
days.
He has gone to school.

724
01:10:57,304 --> 01:10:58,293
And Geeta has gone with him.
I am leaving.

725
01:10:59,906 --> 01:11:03,899
Listen Vinod, I have to tell you
this.

726
01:11:03,977 --> 01:11:06,911
Don't come in the evening,
we are going out.

727
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:10,312
Alright, I'll come at night,
but I am in a hurry right now.

728
01:11:26,332 --> 01:11:27,321
Hello uncle.

729
01:11:30,336 --> 01:11:32,327
I have to go out.
Did you have some work?

730
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,938
Nothing important. Please sit down.

731
01:11:37,943 --> 01:11:39,934
Geeta has not come for singing
lessons since two days.

732
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:41,673
She never takes anything seriously.

733
01:11:41,947 --> 01:11:44,347
Where is she?
- Geeta? She must be home.

734
01:11:44,949 --> 01:11:47,941
But aunt said she has come
with you to school.

735
01:11:48,953 --> 01:11:50,944
She did say she was coming, but...

736
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:55,225
Then I have understood.
- What?

737
01:11:55,293 --> 01:11:56,885
I know.
- What do you know?

738
01:11:56,961 --> 01:11:59,293
Where Geeta will be.
I am going there.

739
01:12:00,898 --> 01:12:02,889
Mr. Chaube, leave.
We will check this tomorrow.

740
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:04,901
I'm going out tomorrow.
- Then we'll check it day after.

741
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:31,579
Friend!

742
01:12:36,997 --> 01:12:39,591
What?
- Where is Geeta?

743
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:41,998
How do I know?
She doesn't even play nowadays.

744
01:12:42,602 --> 01:12:45,935
She used to tie strings to my kite,
now she doesn't even do that.

745
01:12:46,006 --> 01:12:46,995
Why?

746
01:12:47,107 --> 01:12:50,941
She is going to get married.
- Who told you?

747
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:53,605
I know. Aunt told my mom.

748
01:12:54,614 --> 01:13:00,610
She was right. Do me a favour.
I'll write you a letter.

749
01:13:00,687 --> 01:13:03,018
Give it to Geeta.
And don't tell anyone about it.

750
01:13:03,122 --> 01:13:04,111
Okay.

751
01:13:08,627 --> 01:13:12,222
I looked for you all day.
Where were you hiding?

752
01:13:12,631 --> 01:13:16,032
I am going to work now.
Do meet me in the evening.

753
01:13:16,135 --> 01:13:18,228
Even if you don't find Deepu,
make any excuse and come.

754
01:13:18,971 --> 01:13:22,566
We both will go. Our visit
to the river is still pending.

755
01:13:23,575 --> 01:13:26,976
We'll complete the song
left unfinished over there.

756
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,569
Do come.

757
01:13:29,648 --> 01:13:30,979
What has he written, Geeta?

758
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:34,575
He has written the song is
incomplete, we have to complete it.

759
01:13:37,589 --> 01:13:38,988
Keep these clothes.

760
01:13:42,994 --> 01:13:45,986
Deepu, you go, I will go for a bath.
- Okay.

761
01:14:24,568 --> 01:14:29,562
"They meet morning and evening"

762
01:14:29,973 --> 01:14:34,967
"Seeing them, the stars appear"

763
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:43,567
You called me, sir?
- Yes Vinod.

764
01:15:43,645 --> 01:15:44,976
A trip is to be made to Bombay.

765
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,980
There is a meeting in connection
with the bridge on Savitri river.

766
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:52,986
I was thinking of sending you.
- I'll go, sir. When do I have to go?

767
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:55,920
The meeting is on Wednesday, but
you'll have to go 1-2 days earlier...

768
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,981
for briefing.
- I'll go on Monday itself.

769
01:15:58,593 --> 01:16:01,585
Vinod, what is
your opinion about Geeta?

770
01:16:02,597 --> 01:16:06,590
She is a very nice girl.
You come across very few such girls.

771
01:16:07,602 --> 01:16:11,003
Her parents are worried
about her marriage.

772
01:16:11,606 --> 01:16:16,008
Yes, I know.
I think they have even found a boy.

773
01:16:17,611 --> 01:16:22,548
You know the boy?
- Why are you asking me?

774
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,950
Let's go for a picnic this Sunday.
- Okay.

775
01:16:26,553 --> 01:16:30,546
You, me and Geeta.
- Excellent! You are far sighted.

776
01:16:30,624 --> 01:16:32,956
I will cook.
Just watch what I cook.

777
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:37,553
You are an emotional singer.
If you get lost in some song...

778
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:40,566
everything will get burnt.
We'll take Ramjanak and Ganpat along.

779
01:16:40,634 --> 01:16:43,159
The fun of picnic will be lost.

780
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,561
Picnic is fun when we
do everything ourselves.

781
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:24,532
Geeta, sing.
You know to sing now.

782
01:17:25,544 --> 01:17:29,537
I don't know to sing.
- No Vinod, she sings a lot these

783
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:30,938
days.
Sing.

784
01:17:34,552 --> 01:17:35,951
"Before today..."

785
01:17:36,554 --> 01:17:37,953
"more than today..."

786
01:17:44,562 --> 01:17:46,962
"I've never been this happy"

787
01:17:47,565 --> 01:17:48,964
"Such a beautiful..."

788
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:51,967
"such a sweet moment..."

789
01:17:57,575 --> 01:17:59,975
"I have never found before"

790
01:18:44,555 --> 01:18:49,958
"Should we call this a
coincidence, or destiny..."

791
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,552
"this sudden meeting of ours"

792
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,980
"Having found mates of our choice..."

793
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:18,577
"see how our faces glow"

794
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:24,516
"What unites destinies..."

795
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,932
"I have not found that link yet"

796
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:34,934
"Before today..."

797
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,551
Sir, why do you have to drive so
fast?

798
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,961
I have never accepted
defeat in life, Vinod.

799
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,964
That too from a car
doing a wrong overtake?

800
01:20:17,578 --> 01:20:21,514
"May the dream we have seen,
come true"

801
01:20:22,516 --> 01:20:26,509
"That is all I pray for"

802
01:20:43,536 --> 01:20:48,530
"Charmed by these moments
that are passing by..."

803
01:20:48,608 --> 01:20:51,941
"my heart has begun to sing"

804
01:20:53,546 --> 01:20:55,537
"This is the happiness..."

805
01:20:56,549 --> 01:20:57,948
"I was looking for"

806
01:21:03,556 --> 01:21:06,548
"This is what I have not found yet"

807
01:21:06,626 --> 01:21:08,560
"Before today..."

808
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:18,901
Why didn't you sing?

809
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:22,497
If you stay quiet,
you will never be able to sing.

810
01:21:23,509 --> 01:21:24,498
Don't complain then.

811
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:31,916
I forgot to say this.
Congratulations.

812
01:21:32,918 --> 01:21:35,512
Don't pretend.
Like as if you know nothing.

813
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:40,923
I know you girls. You start thinking
of marriage as soon as you are 13-14.

814
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:46,930
Tell me,
when do I take leave for marriage?

815
01:21:48,534 --> 01:21:52,527
Cut your finger?
I said you girls cannot cook.

816
01:21:52,604 --> 01:21:56,870
But you didn't listen. Leave it.
Wants to get married indeed.

817
01:21:56,942 --> 01:21:59,536
It's a small cut.
And I won't get married.

818
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:04,547
Everyone says that.
Alright, I'll take leave in October.

819
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:06,947
With the festival holiday,
I will be able to get 50 days leave.

820
01:22:07,552 --> 01:22:10,953
There are only two months to Dashera.
Even the bridge will be done by then.

821
01:22:11,556 --> 01:22:13,956
Where did Deepu go?
They should have returned by now.

822
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:17,960
Tell me, what do you want
from me for your marriage?

823
01:22:18,563 --> 01:22:21,555
Nothing.
- Don't be so humble.

824
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:23,297
I won't be fooled.

825
01:22:23,568 --> 01:22:25,968
Whether a girl is educated
or illiterate...

826
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,162
she wants clothes
and expensive jewelry.

827
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:35,570
But I am not very rich.
Don't ask for something I cannot

828
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,982
give.
Where is Deepu?

829
01:22:41,585 --> 01:22:45,316
- He is there plucking something.
What were you discussing?

830
01:22:45,589 --> 01:22:48,183
Tell me.
You know Geeta

831
01:22:48,992 --> 01:22:51,984
is going to get married.
I asked her what gift she wants.

832
01:22:53,597 --> 01:22:55,997
- I'll go and get Deepu.
I am noticing Geeta has

833
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,591
begun to feel shy nowadays.
She ran away. Sit down.

834
01:22:58,668 --> 01:23:02,331
Potatoes and lady fingers are
chopped,

835
01:23:02,606 --> 01:23:06,007
tomatoes and cauliflower remain.
Let's have tea.

836
01:23:12,616 --> 01:23:17,019
- Just what I wanted.
Look, aren't they good?

837
01:23:17,953 --> 01:23:19,944
You also eat.
Let's go from here, Deepu.

838
01:23:20,055 --> 01:23:22,546
So soon? The picnic will
end in the evening.

839
01:23:23,559 --> 01:23:26,551
What will we sit so long and do?
I am not enjoying it.

840
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:28,961
Eat tamarind, you will feel good.

841
01:23:29,565 --> 01:23:33,558
Look, four of
them are hanging together.

842
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:36,570
I threw so many stones,
but not a single one hit target.

843
01:23:37,573 --> 01:23:38,972
You try.

844
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,569
Take.

845
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:58,582
Look, two more.

846
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:13,604
Have you met Meera in Bombay?
She is Geeta's elder sister.

847
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:15,006
I did visit her once with you.

848
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:20,547
She has been after me since many
days.

849
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:25,951
She wants me to marry Geeta.
I told her I cannot give

850
01:24:26,554 --> 01:24:30,957
consent without seeing the girl.
It's a question of marriage. That's

851
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,152
why I have come here. To see Geeta.
Vinod, the pulses must be ready.

852
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:40,158
What do you think, Vinod?
Should I marry Geeta?

853
01:24:40,634 --> 01:24:44,161
What do I say?
- I have to decide here at the

854
01:24:44,571 --> 01:24:48,974
picnic.
What is your opinion?

855
01:24:49,576 --> 01:24:50,565
- That's each one's personal choice.
How can I...

856
01:24:50,644 --> 01:24:52,578
What would you do
if you were in my place?

857
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:58,983
Congratulations for the marriage,
sir.

858
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:02,978
Thank you, Vinod. But that's
not the answer to my question.

859
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:05,990
What would you do
if you were in my place?

860
01:25:06,193 --> 01:25:10,596
I would not take anyone's opinion
and hurt someone's love.

861
01:25:10,997 --> 01:25:11,986
I did not...

862
01:25:12,099 --> 01:25:15,590
Why ask anyone's opinion
about a girl like Geeta?

863
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:18,936
If I was in your place,
I'd marry her without hesitation.

864
01:25:19,538 --> 01:25:22,530
Vinod, you have strengthened
my resolve today.

865
01:25:22,942 --> 01:25:25,536
You will be my best man.

866
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:29,540
And you will make all the
wedding arrangements.

867
01:25:44,563 --> 01:25:48,966
You were praising your cooking.
You forgot to put salt in pulses.

868
01:25:49,568 --> 01:25:52,968
There are no tomatoes in the
vegetables. And the toasts aren't

869
01:25:53,171 --> 01:25:55,571
crisp
I'll treat you next time,

870
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:59,576
I messed it today.
Geeta didn't eat anything.

871
01:25:59,644 --> 01:26:02,306
- Let's go, Deepu.
So soon?

872
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,571
We haven't seen anything yet.
Where else do you want to go?

873
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:08,575
That fort, from where we can
see the whole of Madhupur.

874
01:26:08,653 --> 01:26:11,588
And that maze?
There are many trees there.

875
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:15,585
It's fun playing in the maze.
Come on!

876
01:26:16,661 --> 01:26:17,650
I'll catch you, Deepu!

877
01:26:26,538 --> 01:26:28,529
Where will you escape? I'll catch
you.

878
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:44,953
You took me to be
the engineer by mistake?

879
01:26:45,556 --> 01:26:46,545
Yes.

880
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:50,552
Forgive me Geeta, I made a mistake.

881
01:26:50,694 --> 01:26:53,959
What mistake?
- I'll apologise to your parents too.

882
01:26:55,566 --> 01:26:58,296
How were they to know
I am an ordinary overseer.

883
01:26:58,569 --> 01:27:01,561
We were together only for a few days.

884
01:27:01,972 --> 01:27:04,566
A few days misunderstanding
is not important.

885
01:27:04,975 --> 01:27:07,967
We can easily forget everything.

886
01:27:08,978 --> 01:27:10,969
Like we never met.

887
01:27:11,581 --> 01:27:17,577
Believe me Geeta,
I am really very happy...

888
01:27:17,653 --> 01:27:23,922
that you are getting a much better
and nicer life partner than me.

889
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:39,531
Catch me now.
- I'll catch you!

890
01:27:41,544 --> 01:27:44,536
Caught you.
- Enough. Not any more.

891
01:27:51,553 --> 01:27:52,542
Listen.

892
01:27:54,556 --> 01:27:59,960
Tell me what your reply is now.
I know it is yes...

893
01:28:00,562 --> 01:28:02,962
yet I want to hear it from you once.

894
01:28:17,579 --> 01:28:20,514
Looks like you cannot say it.

895
01:28:20,582 --> 01:28:22,914
Your silence means consent.

896
01:28:23,518 --> 01:28:26,509
I'll write a letter
to Meera tonight itself.

897
01:28:27,521 --> 01:28:32,515
Even Vinod wants that. He was saying
I won't get a better girl anywhere.

898
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:47,533
Vinod, sing.
You were singing while going.

899
01:28:49,543 --> 01:28:51,534
Yes Vinod, sing.

900
01:28:54,548 --> 01:28:58,951
"There is a storm raging in my heart,
there are songs on my lips"

901
01:28:59,553 --> 01:29:02,954
"And tears of happiness in my eyes"

902
01:29:19,906 --> 01:29:24,900
"Having reached your dear ones,
you are distanced from them"

903
01:29:25,511 --> 01:29:28,503
"May this never happen to anyone"

904
01:29:29,515 --> 01:29:33,918
"No one tells me whether
destination..."

905
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,516
"I have found or not"

906
01:29:42,928 --> 01:29:44,520
"Before today..."

907
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:46,929
"more than today..."

908
01:29:47,532 --> 01:29:50,524
"I've never been this happy"

909
01:30:11,556 --> 01:30:17,290
I give my consent.
The rest, Meera will handle.

910
01:30:17,562 --> 01:30:20,497
So shall I write to her?
- Why not? Even I will write to her.

911
01:30:20,898 --> 01:30:24,095
We had fixed the marriage date
for 15th...

912
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:25,833
It's okay.
- If it's okay with you...

913
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:27,495
Check that with Meera.

914
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,501
The wedding will be on the 15th.

915
01:30:31,909 --> 01:30:34,901
We'll call the priest and
fix the engagement date.

916
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,913
He will inform you.
Is it okay?

917
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:39,004
As you wish.

918
01:30:48,926 --> 01:30:49,915
Bless you.

919
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:57,933
You are lucky.
Sunil has given consent.

920
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:00,935
Wonder how we'll make all the
arrangements in such few days.

921
01:31:01,137 --> 01:31:03,935
The bouquet... forget it.

922
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:05,530
And this...

923
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:21,980
Whose letter is it?

924
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:24,888
Your aunt's marriage has
been fixed with Sunil.

925
01:31:24,994 --> 01:31:26,689
We will all leave for Madhupur
day after tomorrow.

926
01:31:26,896 --> 01:31:28,488
They are getting engaged.
- Okay.

927
01:31:31,501 --> 01:31:34,902
Are we your enemies
that you feel we are dumping you?

928
01:31:35,505 --> 01:31:38,496
Your other two sisters
didn't get such good proposals.

929
01:31:39,508 --> 01:31:42,500
Don't be stupid. Go get dressed.

930
01:31:42,578 --> 01:31:44,910
There's just an hour to
the engagement ceremony.

931
01:31:45,514 --> 01:31:49,245
No.
- Go dear. Don't be stubborn.

932
01:31:49,518 --> 01:31:51,918
God does everything for our good.

933
01:31:52,121 --> 01:31:54,521
Go change, get dressed.

934
01:32:00,529 --> 01:32:04,932
It's not necessary that you only go.
I can send someone else too.

935
01:32:05,534 --> 01:32:06,523
Raman can go.

936
01:32:06,602 --> 01:32:08,866
No sir, you know
the meeting is important.

937
01:32:08,937 --> 01:32:11,929
And if you are not going,
I must go.

938
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,941
And then, it's just
a matter of one week.

939
01:32:15,043 --> 01:32:18,273
Geeta and me
are getting engaged today.

940
01:32:18,546 --> 01:32:20,537
We'll be very happy if you stay.

941
01:32:21,549 --> 01:32:24,279
And then, are you just my junior,
nothing else?

942
01:32:24,552 --> 01:32:26,952
No sir, it is not that.
You mean everything to me.

943
01:32:27,155 --> 01:32:31,558
You are not only my Chief,
you are my parent, my guardian.

944
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:37,895
Watch what I do for your wedding.
I will make all arrangements.

945
01:32:37,965 --> 01:32:39,956
But please let me go today.

946
01:32:49,577 --> 01:32:50,976
Hello uncle.
- Hello.

947
01:32:51,078 --> 01:32:53,569
Hello Mr. Chaudhary.
- What's up?

948
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:55,572
Vinod is leaving today.

949
01:32:57,584 --> 01:32:58,573
He is leaving?

950
01:33:07,594 --> 01:33:08,583
Come Deepu.

951
01:33:11,598 --> 01:33:13,327
Where are you going?
- Station.

952
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,000
You cannot go anywhere today.
It's your engagement today.

953
01:33:16,603 --> 01:33:18,935
I know mom,
but Vinod is leaving.

954
01:33:19,539 --> 01:33:21,530
Let him leave if he wants to.
Why should we care?

955
01:33:21,608 --> 01:33:24,873
No mom, your daughter will marry
Vinod.

956
01:33:24,945 --> 01:33:27,539
Who said so?
- I have decided.

957
01:33:27,614 --> 01:33:29,946
What!!
- Don't be stupid.

958
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:32,950
Vinod is no comparison to Sunil.
He is an ordinary overseer.

959
01:33:33,052 --> 01:33:36,544
I am no toy that anyone
can play anyhow with me.

960
01:33:36,622 --> 01:33:39,955
It's a question of your marriage.
You may have to regret it all your

961
01:33:40,559 --> 01:33:43,960
life
That is what God willed, or Vinod

962
01:33:44,563 --> 01:33:47,555
would not come here in Sunil's place.
So what?

963
01:33:48,567 --> 01:33:49,966
- What is done is done.
Where is your father?

964
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:54,971
Don't do that, Geeta.
We'll earn a bad name.

965
01:33:55,174 --> 01:33:57,574
What will Sunil think?
- Come Deepu.

966
01:36:19,914 --> 01:36:21,506
Don't cry, Deepu.

967
01:36:26,921 --> 01:36:27,910
Come.

968
01:37:33,519 --> 01:37:34,508
Vinod!

969
01:37:43,529 --> 01:37:46,930
Uncle and Sunil stopped me,
they didn't let me go.

970
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:50,935
Who are we to stop you?
It was God's will.

971
01:37:51,537 --> 01:37:52,526
Right?

972
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:57,532
Even I did not stop you, Vinod.
If anyone has, it is Geeta.

973
01:37:57,944 --> 01:37:59,536
You had accepted defeat.

974
01:38:00,546 --> 01:38:05,949
But Geeta's firmness, her confidence,
and her true love won the battle.

975
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:08,951
You need a life partner like her.

976
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:14,948
Hey don't!

977
01:38:16,561 --> 01:38:20,497
Where is the priest? Priest!
Tell me, what do I have to do?

978
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,901
I am Vinod's Chief,
parent, everything.
