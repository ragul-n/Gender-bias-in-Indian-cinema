1
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,880
Train looted in Amaravati

2
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,300
Drama troupe behind the crime,

3
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,460
escapes with government treasure

4
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,250
Intense hunt launched by the police

5
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,920
Sir, please let me go!

6
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,840
Sir

7
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,460
Sir, I have nothing to do with this

8
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,090
It's these guys who looted the train!

9
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,880
Last night I fell asleep after parking my 
lorry at the railway station

10
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,920
They gagged me and used my lorry to ferry the...

11
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,960
We're not cops bandmaster

12
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,300
We're the Abhiras!

13
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,130
Abhira!

14
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,800
Please let me go; I shall take my...

15
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,710
Bandmaster,

16
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,300
in today's proceedings, you will dance to my tunes

17
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,630
Raise your trumpet!

18
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,920
It must raise a toast to the verdict I will deliver today

19
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,920
Accused No.1 in today's proceedings,

20
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,750
is the ten-headed Ravana

21
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,550
The greatest amongst the demons

22
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,340
Noblest amongst mankind

23
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,800
The verdict must be

24
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,050
fair to both demons and mankind

25
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,380
Bandmaster!

26
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,000
You don't seem to be dancing to my tunes,

27
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:05,840
These heads that have mastered the four Vedas 
can be burnt as per human customs

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,920
These five heads that have mastered warfare can be 
buried as per demonic rites

29
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,340
But, what do we do with this last head of Ravana?

30
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,920
Can you see that throne?

31
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,420
It has a history

32
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,250
If the king who sits on it, eyes a loot, then he must own it

33
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,920
If not, it's an insult to the throne

34
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,750
While I was eyeing this loot, 
wasn't it wrong of you to steal it, Ravana?

35
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,750
You've insulted the throne!

36
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,960
It was a blunder. Please, forgive me, Abhira...

37
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,130
You can forgive a man who has lost his way. 
But not the one who chooses the wrong path!

38
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,420
Hey Koyla! What do we do with the last head of Ravana?

39
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,210
Do we burn it or bury it?

40
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,630
We are as much human as we are demons, Abhira!

41
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,420
Okay then, I'll burn it and you bury it

42
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,800
Fill life into your tune bandmaster, not fear

43
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,920
If not, word will get around that Ram Ram is a tyrant!

44
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,500
Ram Ram's name should be etched in golden letters 
in the annals of Abhira history along with this loot!

45
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,670
Master, there is nothing on the top of the lorry!

46
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,000
They have hidden the loot on the way here, master

47
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,460
Hey, if you die without disclosing the where abouts 
of the loot

48
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,920
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JAARIPA

49
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,750
I will slaughter your family, too!!!

50
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,420
This is Ram Ram's vow!!

51
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,670
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JAARIPA

52
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,960
We are running out of time Abhira. 
Please announce your successor

53
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,960
Ugra is right. You better decide on your successor

54
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,630
None of you are worthy of sitting on that throne

55
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,050
Until the lost loot is found, the throne rather stay empty!

56
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:09,840
The one who restores the lost glory of the throne

57
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,420
will be its true successor

58
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,130
The decision has been made, hasn't it? Leave now!

59
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,670
You have gone crazy cribbing about the lost loot

60
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,550
I am the only successor to the throne

61
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,170
Your sole heir

62
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,670
I have every right to that throne!

63
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,420
Jairam, don't forget that Tukaram is also my son

64
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:02,300
Your illicit relationship with the maid has yielded 
this dog and he can't claim the throne!

65
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,000
Give me your hand, Tukaram

66
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,300
This ring is a symbol of Abhira tradition

67
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,250
And according to the same tradition, 
it's being handed over to one of my sons

68
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,800
Leave!

69
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,250
All these years, you were dispensing justice to the Abhiras 
from that throne

70
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,130
But you were blind to the injustice meted out 
to your own son

71
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,590
I've waited for you to show me some love for so long

72
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:13,590
You held his hand throughout his life, 
but my rise and fall went unnoticed by you

73
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,840
And it left me wounded

74
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:28,590
I thought you'd heal them before your death, 
but you let me down again

75
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:43,340
Who will call out on the injustice that you've done, 
my lord?

76
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:39,380
I never held your hand and helped you walk, 
but with folded hands, I am seeking your promise

77
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:47,420
Never ever harm Tukaram

78
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,300
Promise me!

79
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,090
I promise not to kill him

80
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,550
I have always seen myself in you, Jairam

81
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:10,170
My vow is now your responsibility

82
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,420
Lord of the seven hills, the king of Abhiras is no more!

83
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,170
I, Jairam, the legal son of Ram Ram,

84
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,340
will be the successor to ascend this throne

85
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But, I will not ascend the throne until the lost loot has 
been found and the families of those robbers are destroyed!

86
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,420
This is Jairam's vow!

87
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,750
Until then, king Ram Ram's name shall stay with us!

88
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,550
Long live his name!

89
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,630
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JAARIPA

90
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:51,190
Jairam tried relentlessly. But neither did he find the loot, 
nor the rest of the drama troupe that went missing

91
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,100
15 years passed by in this pursuit

92
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,980
To this day, none can go past that lorry

93
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,940
This is Jairam's line of control!

94
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,800
Dear viewers of Amaravati,

95
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,470
Speculations were rife that the government's treasure that 
was looted 15 years ago,

96
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,390
was hidden in Amaravati itself

97
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,680
Finally, excavations are now on to recover the lost loot

98
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,430
Despite threats from Abhira Jairam, the fearless

99
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,760
world-famous treasure hunter Harishchandra has 
begun the excavation

100
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,720
The visuals you are witnessing currently, is a historic one

101
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:47,350
We wish the braveheart Mr. Harishchandra a long 
and healthy life and wrap this special documentary

102
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,350
Lakshmi! 
- Please contact Lakshmi Studio for all special occasions

103
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
What is it?

104
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,050
I've come on time, mom. You know him right!

105
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,430
Inspector is not in yet!

106
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,140
What else mom?

107
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,140
Who are you?

108
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,220
Hold on, mom

109
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,350
The theft in the neighouring aunty's house.... 
Do you know which great soul did it?

110
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,050
Where's the inspector?

111
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,220
(Iconic scene from Dr. Rajkumar's Bhaktha Prahlada)

112
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,140
You've been screaming out the Lord's name for so long. 
Where is he?

113
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,050
He is everywhere. He is in every cell of 
every being and thing

114
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,050
Is that so?

115
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,350
On this earth? 
- Yes

116
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,430
In the sky? 
- There too!

117
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,850
In the fire? 
- Yes

118
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,850
In the water? 
- Yes

119
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:41,550
In the air? 
- He is everywhere

120
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,470
Everywhere?

121
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,180
Is he in this pillar? 
- Yes

122
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,600
In this one too? Yes

123
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,930
He is here too!

124
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:16,390
(People hailing Lord Narayana's name)

125
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,390
Show!

126
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,760
Everything on the table is now mine, Gadipar. 
Anything else left to lose?

127
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,600
Just old stories. But nobody wants to buy them!

128
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:51,890
I will find the loot and become the king of Abhiras. 
I shall see to you all then!

129
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,850
Where's the queen?

130
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,050
This bar is just a side business

131
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,050
Cattle rearing is his main business

132
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,140
He has travelled all over the world

133
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,890
But he was most impressed by the cowboy culture in America

134
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,890
His name is Cowboy Krishna

135
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,260
He is safeguarding the American culture in Amaravati

136
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,010
Hey! Who the hell let you guys inside?

137
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,220
Looking for me?

138
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,890
I was waiting to finish the cigar

139
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,220
To light another one

140
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,930
Can't you read the board? Cops are not allowed here

141
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:52,970
I know I have everyone's attention. 
So pay attention to what I have to say

142
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
Let me tell you a story

143
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,010
Playing the lead is Johnny

144
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,470
It was the last day of Navaratri

145
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,850
Johnny came on his bike to shoot me

146
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,470
As soon as he saw me, he pulled out his gun

147
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,260
And...Johnny's story ended there

148
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,890
Johnny Johnny...No papa

149
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,640
Bloody outsider!

150
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,140
Hit the last one. You will get five beers

151
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,720
Anything that can fetch me more beers?

152
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,430
Hit that

153
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,050
What if I do?

154
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,800
Lifetime free beer. Nobody's done it so far. Try it

155
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,760
Damn!

156
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,050
These four men?

157
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,680
They are Jairam's men

158
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,430
Get the cop a beer. It's on me

159
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:41,390
Jairam's men!

160
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,140
Jairam's slaves!

161
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,300
Must be the new generation of Jairam's men!

162
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,430
I don't remember seeing anyone of them before

163
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,390
You'll drink all of it alone?

164
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,430
It's enough to start with

165
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,720
Do you know the game?

166
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:30,300
Even we've heard about Johnny's murder. 
But there are umpteen tales about the killer

167
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,050
But, how do we know it's you?

168
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,260
All of you waiting, listen up!

169
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,800
There is nobody who can read his mind

170
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,800
I bet you haven't heard of someone like him

171
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,930
Even if you have, it was probably a legendary tale

172
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,430
The most sought after in this world

173
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,970
A man with a his gun as a companion

174
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,800
His cap adorns his head like a crown

175
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,100
And is stubborn

176
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,970
A leader who chases his goals!

177
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,800
Rumors and legends about him are the talk of the town

178
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,300
Now that we have been introduced to him, 
why don't you meet his sidekick as well?

179
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,890
Hands Up! He is eternal

180
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,350
Hands Up! I'm the one in disguise

181
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,850
Hands Up! This is my philosophy

182
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,220
He is definitely born to create history

183
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,470
The stage is set! So, experience this, 
you curious spectator

184
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,390
Lock your eyes are on me, and there will be no dearth of 
entertainment

185
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,300
There are people living with an illusion of defeating me

186
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,220
It's not their fault, but that is beyond imagination

187
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:42,930
It feels like you're here to write a new era, so let your 
flags soar high

188
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:49,140
When there is war, we need to fight our enemies and not 
read the holy book

189
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,180
He is definitely born to create history

190
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,930
All of you waiting, listen up!

191
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,430
The is nobody who can read his mind

192
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,510
I bet you haven't heard of someone like him

193
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,640
Even if you have, it was probably a legendary tale

194
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,890
The most sought after in this world

195
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,470
A man with a his gun as a companion

196
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,220
His cap adorns his head like a crown

197
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,720
And is stubborn

198
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,050
A leader who chases his goals!

199
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,300
Rumors and legends about him are the talk of the town

200
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,800
Now that we have been introduced to him, why don't you meet 
his sidekick as well?

201
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,100
Hands Up! He is eternal

202
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,720
Hands Up! He's the one in disguise

203
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,100
Hands Up! This is his philosophy

204
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,550
He definitely is born to create history

205
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,220
While I've been waiting at the station to file a complaint, 
you are happily downing drinks at the bar!

206
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,850
Miss Lakshmi, It is better to drink at a bar, isn't it? 
Won't it be an offence to drink at the station?

207
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,220
Gentlemen! Please respect women

208
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,720
What do you want now? Respect?

209
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,930
I mean, you want to file a complaint? Write it down

210
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,180
Tell me, madam

211
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,050
Despite knowing that treasure hunter Harishchandra has 
threats from Jairam,

212
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,180
why didn't you safeguard him?

213
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,050
Threat?

214
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:02,300
Where's the threat Miss Lakshmi? It's already 
been taken care of!

215
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,300
Who are they?

216
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:10,390
Jairam's henchmen. They were set to kidnap the 
treasure hunter. By then, our inspector arrested them

217
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,140
Madam, please revoke your complaint

218
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,720
The treasure hunter has already been kidnapped!

219
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,140
Really? Has he been kidnapped?

220
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,850
Hold on! You must be confused. 
They were set to kidnap him, but then...

221
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,260
It's a lie!

222
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,680
We were following him to provide security. 
We are aides of the bright and promising politician Tukaram

223
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,640
He put us on the job to safeguard Harischandra 
as he doesn't trust the cops

224
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,260
Boys! One minute

225
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:52,600
So you're saying that you were following the 
treasure hunter to provide him with security

226
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:59,140
And you're saying that the treasure hunter has 
already been kidnapped

227
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,050
So,

228
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,720
Show!

229
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,720
If the treasure hunter has been kidnapped while you 
were in my custody, you are not the kidnappers

230
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,850
Congrats!

231
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,260
Thank you Miss Lakshmi

232
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,260
You have saved four innocents from being punished

233
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,180
Just you wait!

234
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,720
Please handover the handcuffs at the station on your way

235
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:37,680
How irresponsible! Tomorrow's newspaper will have your 
entire history. Just you wait!

236
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,180
You're threatening a police officer and according 
to Section 300 and...

237
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,930
...it's a serious offence!

238
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,220
And you all are witness to this. I will take strict action

239
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,390
Action will be taken against you by your department!

240
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,390
Don't forget to read the paper tomorrow!

241
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,050
Which paper? Hi Amaravati? - Yes. 
Ok, I will make a note of that

242
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,470
Anyway, nice meeting you guys

243
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,050
It was an amazing party. Really!

244
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,180
Who will pay the bill?

245
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,850
Our bill is now clear. What about yours?

246
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,430
May I?

247
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,300
Ah! Thank you

248
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,970
By the way, gentlemen,

249
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,050
if in future, if somebody writes your history,

250
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:46,760
It will have two parts

251
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,220
One: before you met him

252
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,300
Two: after you met him

253
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,890
Who is he?

254
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,050
He is Sriman Narayana!

255
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,720
Uh oh!

256
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,260
Looks like it was a rocking party!

257
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,800
Even I have a party

258
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,720
It's called Shanti Priya (Lover of Peace)

259
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:45,640
But until there are bullets in a gun, 
how can there be peace?

260
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,720
Lovers of peace...

261
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,220
Sir, Tukaram sir!

262
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,600
Can I get some water to drink?

263
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,550
Ramchandra!

264
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,720
When a man is gripped by fear,

265
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,890
it is normal for his throat to dry up

266
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,720
Unfortunately, water is scarce in this town

267
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,680
No water

268
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,300
But that doesn't mean there's no water in our town

269
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,100
It's there!

270
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,680
Even our town has a lake

271
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,930
We're not allowed to drink from it

272
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,930
Tell me why?

273
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,640
Sir,

274
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,800
the cap is still on,

275
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:38,930
Smart!

276
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,640
This cap is Jairam's line of control

277
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,350
No one can cross this line to the other side

278
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,800
Oh it's simple! Give it to me

279
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,050
First, request Jairam

280
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,930
"Jairam sir,

281
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,470
If you remove this line of control,

282
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,050
we can easily..."

283
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,600
Sir!

284
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,890
Can't we drink?

285
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,720
Jairam...make your request

286
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,300
Sir?

287
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,640
Make your request!

288
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:35,470
Jairam sir, If you remove this line of control, 
we can easily drink water from this lake

289
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,760
Jairam says, "no"

290
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,390
One minute

291
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,100
Oh!

292
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,890
Jairam says, "there's a hidden loot on the other side...

293
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,050
...until we find the loot, I'll not tolerate anyone 
going near the lake"

294
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,720
Then we have a problem sir

295
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:02,300
And if we find the loot, then you will be free of 
Jairam and his line of control

296
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,600
On the same line, I had roped in a treasure hunter 
to find the loot

297
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,510
And deployed four men for his security

298
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,550
But you...

299
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,010
Sir, that was due to a confusion

300
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,890
Even I have a confusion

301
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,300
Those four men wearing hats inside the bar...

302
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,850
... do you know what their job is?

303
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,890
They are secret contract workers

304
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,800
No one can even find out who gave the contract!

305
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,930
If you write a contract, put in a hundred rupees 
and drop it in the can

306
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,350
it reaches the hands of Cowboy Krishna

307
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,760
He takes it and...

308
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,050
Damn! I seem to have missed something!

309
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,510
One Rupee

310
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,260
Sir,

311
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,800
Not 100. It's actually 101 rupees

312
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,470
And if Cowboy Krishna drops the one rupee in the cow-bank, 
it means the contract is on

313
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,640
The money and the contract chit goes 
to the hands of the hat-wearing men

314
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,010
Whatever be the contract, consider it done

315
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,800
Very good!

316
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,300
I am their old customer!

317
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,010
Ramchandra!

318
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,050
Shall we write?

319
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,600
What?

320
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,430
The contract!

321
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,640
Sir, cap. It's yours. Put it on

322
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:35,720
Treasure hunter Harischandra has been kidnapped 
owing to my irresponsibility

323
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:44,220
If I don't rescue treasure hunter Harishchandra 
from the clutches of Jairam within four days,

324
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,100
Sir, go a little slow

325
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,220
then feel free to...

326
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:56,680
mercilessly... horrendously...

327
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,300
..kill me

328
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:04,260
I assign you this task in complete faith. Yours truly, 
Just put a tiny comma

329
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,050
Below that

330
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,260
Inspector Narayana

331
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,390
Sir,

332
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,470
101 rupees?

333
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,260
Don't worry. It's already in the envelope

334
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,010
Ramchandra,

335
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,930
drop it in the can, will you?

336
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,640
You have only four days. Mind it!

337
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,300
Let's go?

338
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,010
By the way, no cop has ever set foot inside the 
fort of Abhiras

339
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,640
Good luck. Take care!

340
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,050
It'd have been better if you read the letter Tukaram sir!

341
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,350
Printing is almost done. Start loading already

342
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,100
Ok sir

343
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:06,970
Breaking news!

344
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,260
Charmed by Miss Lakshmi, the editor of 'Hi Amaravati' 
Mr. Sudhakar, would've praised me in his newspaper

345
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,100
The news has been printed. But alas! 
The newspaper won't reach anyone

346
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,720
Reason: The delivery van is missing

347
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,430
Sir, can you keep it low!?

348
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
To hell with you!

349
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,300
Sir, it's my mom on the phone

350
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,430
Now, Miss Lakshmi will come here on her Luna 
with Mr Sudhakar to file a complaint

351
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,430
Hi! Amaravati

352
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,510
Please come

353
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,640
So..

354
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,140
The word is that you've written on our sir today. 
But the newspaper hasn't come in yet!

355
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,850
That's why we're here to file a complaint!

356
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,930
The entire lot of papers that were printed this morning is 
missing. And so is the delivery van

357
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,800
I've been trying to reach you since morning, 
but your phone seems to be forever busy!

358
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,300
...I only managed to steal a plate and tumbler this 
time. Sir is using it to have lunch!

359
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,430
Mom, hold on! Everyone's staring at me!

360
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,550
I'll call you later

361
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
Sir, first take our complaint!

362
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,760
You might want to give a complaint Mr Sudhakar. 
Look, we have no problem taking it

363
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,680
Side please!

364
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:27,930
And then, you will keep pestering me to find it. 
But we have no motivation to find it. Do you know why?

365
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,390
You haven't maintained a good relationship with us

366
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,220
Take for example our neighboring aunty, 
she keeps sending us tea and coffee

367
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Sir, tea!

368
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,050
We don't even have to ask for it

369
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,760
She has maintained friendly relations with us

370
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,470
What's aunty doing?

371
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,220
She is taking a shower

372
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,510
Very nice!

373
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,430
There was a theft in aunty's house the other day. 
In 15 minutes we brought him here

374
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,100
Ask him!

375
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,350
Sir, not 15 minutes! I was here in 10. 
You were late. Ask madam. She was here too

376
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:54,970
Madam?

377
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,100
Now what? Will you take my complaint or not?

378
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,050
You still haven't given it Miss Lakshmi. How can I take it?

379
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,720
Ok. Here! Write it down

380
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:03,800
Write

381
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,050
Mom, sorry the call got cut. Like I said...

382
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,640
Oh! This isn't mom!

383
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,850
Oh, you found a van?

384
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,010
Grey colour?

385
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,600
CEZ 306?

386
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,720
Mine mine!

387
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,640
Grey colour!

388
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:19,930
Oh..

389
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,470
See you merely began writing the complaint 
and we already found your van!

390
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,100
Correct, Sir!

391
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,550
Very good, Cobar!

392
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,300
Amma, you should have been here to see my catch!

393
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,600
This is all Narayana's ploy. Don't fall for it, Sudhakar

394
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,430
I won't Lakshmi. No way!

395
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,180
Mr. Sudhakar!

396
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,350
Coming, sir!

397
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,890
One minute Lakshmi!

398
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,680
Sir?

399
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,510
Love is in the air, huh?

400
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,430
No, no sir

401
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,680
Good. It won't work out anyway

402
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:03,180
Nothing like that, sir. There's no problem

403
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,850
What does it say Achyuthanna? Have they praised me a lot?

404
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,970
Not bad. Lot of spelling mistakes though

405
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,430
Isn't it wrong, Sudhakar?

406
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,220
Sir, that...

407
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,050
Come here

408
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,930
Look, don't sway to the charms of Lakshmi 
and cheat on Saraswathi

409
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,510
If you do that, what will happen to our relationship?

410
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,470
It will get spoilt, sir

411
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:25,890
Exactly!

412
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,550
What do you plan to write tomorrow?

413
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,220
Definitely not anything on you sir!

414
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,550
Sir...

415
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,680
You're making the same mistake again

416
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,680
You must write

417
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,930
We found your van even before you filed the complaint

418
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,720
Isn't it a wonderful topic to write on?

419
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,930
Absolutely sir

420
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,220
It's a wonderful topic, indeed. We can write

421
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,350
Is there a problem, Achyuthanna?

422
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,550
Huh? No

423
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,180
Go on then. File a report that the case has been solved

424
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,220
Thank you, sir

425
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,140
It's ok, Sudhakar. What columns does your paper have?

426
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,640
We have...

427
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,260
Is there a sports column?

428
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,890
Yes sir

429
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,850
I play Kho-Kho

430
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,220
Write this

431
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,510
'Narayana displays incredible prowess at Kho-Kho!'

432
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,100
That'll be nice

433
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:21,100
(Struggling noises)

434
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,390
Achyuthanna!

435
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,220
Sir?

436
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,970
Treasure hunter Harishchandra!

437
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,050
What the...

438
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,140
Sir, I've nothing to do with this

439
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,050
Sir,

440
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,010
Sir, this is the only vehicle that goes unchecked 
from this town

441
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,930
This fellow must be conspiring with Jairam 
and attempting to smuggle him out of here

442
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,300
Sir, I swear I've no clue about this

443
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,470
I don't know how he ended up here

444
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,510
Sir?

445
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,890
Do one thing, Achyuthanna

446
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,640
Book Miss Lakshmi's photo studio for one hour

447
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,050
I will break into Jairam's fort and rescue 
treasure hunter Harischandra

448
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,180
But the treasure hunter is right here

449
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:27,890
Where? Where Achyuthanna?

450
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,220
Ah! I get it!

451
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Make way Miss Lakshmi. Please!

452
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,180
I am on my way to break into Jairam's fort

453
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,140
'Amaravati's braveheart Narayana'

454
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,930
- Ready? Miss Lakshmi, smile please!

455
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:48,050
Superhero breaks into the impenetrable fort of Jairam; 
rescues treasure hunter Harishchandra

456
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,180
Ramchandra, why didn't I get to know of this news earlier?

457
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,930
Tukaram wants to know

458
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,940
Ten of Jairam's henchmen on this side

459
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,650
And on the other side, just me!

460
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,730
Sir, what about me?

461
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,350
I had made you promise, isn't it?

462
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,900
That you are old now and you will not fight anymore

463
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,190
So yes. I kept beating them all into pulp

464
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,900
And because he kept pulping, sir got exhausted and collapsed

465
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,440
A man comes running with an acid bottle and 
sir is unable to even move

466
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:39,270
I pleaded, "Sir, please let me break my promise. 
Please let me break my promise"

467
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,230
The acid bottle is drawing closer, but sir isn't 
uttering a word

468
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,150
Sir, "Please let me break my promise. 
Please let me break my promise"

469
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,980
All right! That's enough Achyuthanna!

470
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,270
And he said "All right!"

471
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,650
That's when the hero of the story Achyuth Kumar 
made his entry

472
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:04,310
I grabbed the bottle from his hand, gulped the acid 
and spat it on his face

473
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,190
But if you gulp acid, won't your throat 
get burnt Achyuthanna?

474
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,600
It did sir. A little.

475
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,690
Can't you make out the 
change in my voice?

476
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,730
Yes. I think I sense a slight change now

477
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,350
Narayana

478
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,230
Hello!

479
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,650
The master is calling

480
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,060
Ok go. Who's stopping you?

481
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,350
Sir, promise me that you will not get into a fight today

482
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,810
I will handle them

483
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,480
No Achyuthanna. This isn't as easy as 
downing a bottle of acid

484
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,600
This isn't a request. This is an order

485
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,310
Achyuthanna?

486
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,980
Parota! I am placing an order for parota!

487
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,770
Get a plate of parota and mutton balls for sir

488
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:45,600
Ok sir

489
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:53,730
Hey

490
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,350
Who the hell are you?

491
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,190
Shall I tell you and then beat you up? 
Or beat you up and then tell you?

492
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,020
B@$##$!

493
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,440
Parota and mutton balls!

494
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,810
Sir I take back my promise, you handle this

495
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,520
Hello!

496
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,100
If you don't mind

497
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,230
Sir, bend down

498
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,150
You made me bend all the way for this??

499
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:17,980
Howzzzat!

500
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,770
I feel shy, sir

501
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,900
Where did he go?

502
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,310
Is it very deep?

503
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,600
Oh it is!

504
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,900
If master hears about this

505
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,270
Who the hell is your master?

506
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,100
Jairam!

507
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,650
Checkmate!

508
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,230
The master had summoned the inspector. 
So we brought him here

509
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,270
But it looks like it's he who has brought you here!

510
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,310
Let him in

511
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,600
One minute

512
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:14,270
In the history of Amaravati, we are the first cops to enter 
this fort

513
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:18,980
Sir, it'll be great if we're the first ever 
cops to safely get out of here, too!

514
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,690
Please spare me, master!

515
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:38,480
You can forgive the one who has lost his way, but not the 
one who choses the wrong path!

516
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:45,310
It's Abhira blood that runs in my veins. 
I can never be a traitor

517
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:51,150
Let's check if it's truly the blood of Abhiras that runs 
in your veins

518
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,730
What happened?

519
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,190
Apparently, he who used to leak 
information to Tukaram

520
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,560
Disloyal dog!

521
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,350
Jairam!

522
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Watch your tone when you take my name Vibhasu

523
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,150
Or else, I will have to disregard the loyalty 
you've shown to my father

524
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,060
Ugra, crucify this dog

525
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,150
Bhoppa! Get the cross

526
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:04,400
Achyuthanna, I've been observing the bandmaster. 
He is indifferent to whatever is happening

527
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,690
He has already lost his mind sir. 
So he just minds his own business

528
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,560
Poor fellow. He's lost his marbles off late

529
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,690
So does he not react to anything?

530
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,100
No

531
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,350
We have to ensure the master doesn't find out

532
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,020
If he does, we'll be doomed

533
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,770
Lord of the seven hills

534
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,310
The king of Abhiras

535
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,730
Rama Rama

536
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:26,690
Long live his name!

537
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,560
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA

538
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:42,810
Bandmaster, seems like the proceedings will never begin 
until you blow your trumpet

539
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:56,770
You've been blowing this trumpet for 15 years now. And all 
of them have been rejoicing by hailing the name of my father

540
00:53:58,730 --> 00:53:59,850
Rama Rama

541
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,060
Long live his name!

542
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:09,770
So someone tell me, when will the name of my father 
be liberated from this court?

543
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,100
Sir, you know...

544
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:26,940
The fact that you haven't managed to find a single clue 
shows that you wastrels are habituated to rejoicing

545
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,440
If that b@$^@$ Tukaram has dared to lay a 
finger on my fort...

546
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,940
Bandmaster, I hardly felt it. You should hit a little harder

547
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:55,940
I was just training him on what to do if 
somebody snatches his trumpet

548
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:01,940
Achyuthanna, behave!

549
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:10,190
Sir, I would've come there and shook hands to 
offer you my salutations. But I'm helpless

550
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,600
Circumstances have tied me up

551
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,100
The reason for summoning me here...

552
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:19,770
...is because we bravely foiled your attempt to smuggle 
the treasure hunter out of town

553
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,230
Even the newspapers got carried away 
while singing our praises

554
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,230
You are upset and I can understand your pain, sir

555
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,560
But I speak only the truth as I stand here

556
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,060
I have nothing to do with this

557
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,900
This act of bravery was entirely by our 
constable Achyuthanna

558
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,020
Achyuthanna, please!

559
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:40,650
Excuse me!

560
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,400
He got carried away by his call of duty. Please forgive him

561
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,770
In fact, he has a lot of respect for you

562
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:46,940
Isn't it Achyuthanna?

563
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,730
Yes! Most definitely!

564
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:59,770
These buffoons are claiming to have rescued the 
officer from our clutches

565
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:07,400
So according to you, I was behind the attempt 
of smuggling the officer out of here

566
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,440
Why?

567
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,440
Achyuthanna, he's asking you, why would he do that?

568
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,650
Who do I have to fear in this town?

569
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,650
Exactly! Why would he fear anyone?

570
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:30,310
Ugra, if this inspector continues acting smart, 
pump all the bullets in this room into his chest

571
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:35,650
Now, bear these two things in mind

572
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:42,440
One: If that officer was in my captivity, you would dare 
not come anywhere close, forget rescuing him

573
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:50,560
Two: And had you managed to rescue him from my captivity, 
your corpse would be hanging on the ramparts of my fort

574
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,150
So you didn't kidnap the treasure hunter, sir?

575
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,940
Is your corpse hanging outside my fort?

576
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:06,480
Sir, here's the truth. We didn't make any efforts to rescue 
the treasure hunter. We found him accidentally

577
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,690
And since we found him, we thought we will 
get some fame out of it

578
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,730
Yes sir. It brought fame, but for him

579
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,020
Ugra, they are of no use to us

580
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,440
Sir one minute. We will definitely be of use

581
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,400
Sir, what is it? You want to trace the kidnapper right?

582
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,350
Give us two days. We'll find him. Right Achyuthanna?

583
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,100
Yes!

584
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,900
I don't need your help for it

585
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,980
Oh, you don't need it?

586
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,850
Sir, I'll handover the treasure hunter to you

587
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:39,480
Ugra!

588
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,770
Oh you don't want that too?

589
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,650
Sir!!

590
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,690
If you give me sometime, I'll find the missing loot for you

591
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,100
He seems to be interested!

592
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,150
Don't assume my desire as my weakness, Narayana

593
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:02,730
Sir, you've tried finding that loot for 15 years now, 
but the treasure hunter knows how to find it

594
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,650
Sir, allow the treasure hunter to do his job

595
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:09,230
Claiming that his life is under threat from you, 
I shall closely guard him

596
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,020
As soon as we find the loot, I will hand over it to you

597
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,270
It's the fear of death that's making you talk

598
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:23,060
If you go back on your word, the consequences will be more 
dire than the death that you've managed to escape today

599
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,810
Ok relax! Didn't you hear him say that I've managed to 
to escape from death today?

600
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,980
Gun down!

601
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,480
Keep an eye on him

602
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:37,940
Ok, master

603
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:45,730
I thought the bandmaster was pretending. 
But I'm really disappointed. He's totally lost it

604
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,190
Why are you disappointed sir?

605
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,270
Concern!

606
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,020
The poor thing has been playing the trumpet 
for the Abhiras for the past 15 years

607
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,020
And these Abhiras don't even have half the concern I have

608
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,150
But what can they do?

609
00:58:55,850 --> 00:59:00,850
My father had lost his memory when he received 
a nasty blow on his head

610
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:04,100
But when I hit him correctly on the same spot, 
his memory returned in a flash!

611
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,560
How did you know it was the correct spot?

612
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,020
It was I who hit him the first time, so that's why!

613
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,020
There were five notes in this wallet, isn't it?

614
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,690
We are five of us here, aren't we?

615
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,980
Sir, unlike your father, the bandmaster didn't 
lose his mind due to a blow, right?

616
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:27,980
It's due to a shock

617
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,770
A shock? Of course we can give him that too! 
There are many techniques to do it

618
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,770
Physical, mental and so forth...

619
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:35,770
Can you see him?

620
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,770
That's physical

621
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,440
If you go back on your word to Jairam, 
then you'll meet with a similar fate

622
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,060
Now this is mental shock

623
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:49,190
Despite being police officers, we're rendered helpless. He 
may stay alive for maybe another three days. How sad!

624
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,270
Anything can happen in three days, Achyuthanna

625
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,020
Let's go

626
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,650
Where to?

627
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:58,560
To the arena

628
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,600
Achyuthanna, this game began 15 years ago

629
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,650
It was started by these six drama folk

630
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,730
The ones who came to perform a play, also looted a train

631
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,350
Desirous of the loot, but fearful of the Abhiras

632
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,310
They hide the loot thinking they could smuggle it out once 
things cooled down

633
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,730
and while on their way....

634
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,560
Excuse me!

635
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,310
...and while on their way, comes the first twist to the 
story

636
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,900
The first player enters the arena

637
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,400
Surprise!

638
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,730
Ram Ram tried his best to find the loot. Alas! 
He breathed his last before doing so!

639
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,270
But with conditions applied!

640
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:50,020
This condition gave rise to two more players

641
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,440
Jairam and Tukaram

642
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,020
Jairam has power. He has the support of the Abhiras

643
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,400
The whole town fears him

644
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,440
He will stop at nothing to win this game

645
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:04,940
But, he is impulsive!

646
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,770
Doesn't think before he acts, doesn't 
trust anyone around him

647
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,480
Ah! That will work in our favour!

648
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,270
And there's Tukaram

649
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:17,270
Abhiras will not let him anywhere close to them

650
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:20,270
He wants to eliminate them and rule Amaravati

651
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,400
He has built his own party to gain political strength

652
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,940
He believes politics is the next dacoity

653
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:34,150
But if neither of them has kidnapped the treasure hunter, 
it means a third player has entered the arena

654
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:35,900
Who could that be, sir?

655
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,650
Though the treasure hunter was kidnapped in broad daylight, 
Jairam and Tukaram have no clue about the kidnapper

656
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,560
If both players are oblivious to the presence of 
another player in the arena...

657
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,900
...then he is smart, he is courageous!

658
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,270
Think about it, Achyuthanna

659
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:51,940
The kidnapping of the treasure hunter has been of 
no advantage to anyone

660
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,230
Except for him

661
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,350
Achyuthanna,

662
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,310
If someone writes the history of Amaravati in future, 
it will be divided into two parts

663
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,100
One: before his arrival in Amaravati

664
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,480
Two: after his arrival in Amaravati

665
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,770
Who is he?

666
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,270
He is Sriman Narayana!

667
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,270
Oh, I love that expression!

668
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:10,940
Sir!

669
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:12,770
Sir, sir

670
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,230
How did you manage to kidnap the treasure hunter?

671
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,350
The hat-wearing men who were sitting in 
Cowboy Krishna's bar

672
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:19,850
Oh!

673
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,440
I am their old customer

674
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,150
Sir, now that you have entered the arena, 
how do you plan to find the missing loot?

675
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,900
If you need to find the loot, then we 
need to dig, Achyuthanna

676
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,100
But where, sir?

677
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,730
Tell me where the six drama folk were buried?

678
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:36,650
Right here!

679
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,480
Then let's start from here

680
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:49,440
Sir, if we haven't found the bodies yet, they must've 
decomposed

681
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,770
Then we should've at least found the bones

682
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,690
Looks like someone's found the bodies and made off with them

683
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,600
What do we do now?

684
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,980
Do as I say...get me six dead bodies.

685
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:00,730
Why sir?

686
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,940
Let the departed rest in peace Achyutanna!

687
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,150
Today...

688
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,770
...the programme arranged by our beloved Amaravati Police 
Department...

689
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,650
...to find the remains of the six drama folk who lost their 
lives after stealing the loot

690
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,520
and perform their final rites...

691
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,850
...that is just a small part of my big plan...

692
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,480
Your problems are now my problems

693
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:26,940
I've come here...

694
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:28,730
...only for you.

695
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,810
... only for you...

696
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:37,850
I've relayed the news to the press across six neighbouring 
towns. But only these many have turned up

697
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,480
How many have come is immaterial, Achyuthanna

698
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,480
It is "who" has come and for what, that matters

699
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,560
I'm not a coward and won't be scared by threats

700
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,310
That man there with a towel on his head...

701
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,150
Who's he?

702
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,190
That's our pickpocket Velu, sir

703
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,770
He's just doing his job!

704
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:57,940
My intentions are right

705
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:04,350
Hail Tukaram!

706
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,190
Sir, he seems to have arrived just to ruin our plan

707
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,400
Dear Harry!

708
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:13,480
Inspector Narayana!

709
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:17,270
Heard that you're on a mission to deliver peace 
to the dear departed

710
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,310
And where there's peace, how can I not be there?

711
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,440
Take your seat

712
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:29,650
The almighty himself will descend to protect you

713
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:31,400
...will descend...

714
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,400
On our way here, Ramchandra was telling me a few things....

715
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:39,480
...that it wasn't Jairam who kidnapped the treasure hunter

716
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,190
I reprimanded him

717
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:45,100
"Don't you read the paper?", I said

718
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:52,100
That in fact it's our Narayana who rescued the treasure 
hunter by breaking into Jairam's fort

719
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,400
Achyuthanna, who is that fellow with a monkey cap?

720
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,310
I remember seeing him around here...

721
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,810
Go ask where he's from

722
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,600
Sorry, you were saying something

723
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,940
About how people spread such amusing rumours

724
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:17,690
Oh yeah! Such nonsense actually!

725
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,150
Take for example the rumours at Jairam's fort

726
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,100
They say someone is leaking information to you from there

727
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,980
Of course, I didn't believe it!

728
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:34,730
But you know Jairam. He was interrogating 
someone with a vengeance!

729
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:45,520
If one continues wearing a mask even after one's true 
colours are revealed, it becomes a mere accessory

730
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,060
Let's straight get down to business?

731
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,940
Ah! This is interesting. Let's talk!

732
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:54,600
I only want one thing. Jairam shouldn't lay 
his hands on the missing loot

733
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:00,100
The Abhira clan should perish without a leader

734
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,650
And your political party should take their 
place in Amaravati

735
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:03,770
Very good thought!

736
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:04,810
I know!

737
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:17,150
But according to my sources, somebody has apparently 
promised Jairam that they'll help him find the loot

738
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,100
That's not a very good thought, isn't it?

739
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:27,230
Now, he has to either break his promise

740
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:34,480
Or I have to forego my peaceful ways and break his bones!

741
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,770
Come on, let's burn!

742
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,980
Clap! Come on, clap!

743
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:56,310
Tukaram sir! Despite the culprit being caught, if you're 
getting information from the fort, either you're joking...

744
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,190
...or you still have some of your men there!

745
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:12,100
By the way, thank you for giving me the information

746
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:12,980
oh..

747
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:16,690
Miss Lakshmi, please click a picture of Tukaram and me

748
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,020
Smile please!

749
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:24,600
Sudhakar!

750
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:24,980
Sir

751
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,600
Of course, I'll write about this sir

752
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:41,100
Those four men near the lorry...who are they?

753
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,730
I've never seen them before. No idea who they are

754
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,350
Go find out

755
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,600
I've come here only for you

756
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,730
I'm not a coward to be scared by threats

757
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:56,150
If your intentions are right

758
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,980
I'm sure the almighty will re-incarnate 
to protect you

759
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,650
This time our calculations won't go wrong

760
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,650
This is definitely our Sri Hari who has come to save us

761
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,190
Sri Hari, you're finally here!

762
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:15,810
But we had recovered the bones of those drama folk ages ago

763
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:17,940
Why did he stage that act today?

764
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:21,730
Had he not staged that act, we wouldn't have 
gone to that function, isn't it?

765
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,850
He did that only to pass on the divine 
message that he's here to protect all of us

766
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,810
Oh God! How kind of you to do so!

767
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,190
Perfect timing!

768
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
Tomorrow is a full-moon night

769
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:37,690
Let's hope the divine message reaches us and the 
prophecy comes true

770
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,150
Sri Hari, please protect us always

771
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,440
Please relieve us from this town

772
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,900
Sri Hari, please protect us always

773
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,690
Finally the lord is here!

774
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:11,480
10, 20, 30...

775
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,850
Ready or not, here I come....

776
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,560
Boo!

777
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:23,650
Boo!

778
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:31,020
Nothing can remain hidden from me in this town!

779
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,270
Good morning security!

780
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:40,190
Shall we get down to work?

781
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:48,440
So you will find the missing loot using this pendulum?

782
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,400
Yes!

783
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,480
And what if it fails?

784
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,350
I have one more

785
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,980
What if this doesn't work either?

786
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,400
I have many more

787
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:59,190
I'm sure one of it will work

788
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:01,350
Let's go!

789
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,520
Achyuthanna, what are they both doing here?

790
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,190
I had asked them to follow the four mysterious men

791
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:10,400
And we arrived here by following them, sir

792
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:10,900
Yes sir

793
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,400
Mr Harishchandra, the lorry that has the loot is 
outside the town

794
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,150
What are you doing in this town with the pendulum?

795
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,730
You should ideally begin investigations near the lorry, 
isn't it?

796
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:30,270
No

797
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,480
We have our own plans

798
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,600
We will search for it right here

799
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,350
He says he will search for the loot here

800
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:45,810
For weddings, thread ceremonies, death ceremonies 
and other special occasions, please contact

801
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,150
Lakshmi!

802
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:47,100
What's your problem?

803
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,060
There he is...

804
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:01,190
Sir, why are these guys following the treasure hunter?

805
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:06,400
How can the prophecy comes true if Sri Hari 
continues to escape like this?

806
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:10,400
If Sri Hari doesn't come on his own, 
then we will take him there today

807
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,100
How?

808
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,060
Ashu...

809
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:22,850
ouch!

810
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:38,440
Interesting!

811
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,770
Gather our men...

812
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,230
Put on your masks...

813
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:20,560
With no hope of leaving, we are captured here...

814
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:27,440
This has started to feel like an endless exile...

815
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:34,150
Ah! There comes the full moon in all its glory

816
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:40,560
And has brought with it waves of bliss

817
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,900
Gather our men...

818
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,900
Put on your masks...

819
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:12,190
The troupe that looted the train is still in this town

820
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,310
Yes sir

821
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:18,600
They get together on full moon nights. And the rest of the 
time, despite being amidst us, we didn't even realise it!

822
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,230
But I still have a few doubts, Achyuthanna

823
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,150
I think we should join...

824
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:28,560
Yeah!

825
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:41,730
My dear ones, what is this new celebration?

826
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:47,810
It's just an age old tragedy...

827
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,600
We have lived a life of unfulfilled desires

828
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,690
Give me one clue and I will solve this riddle

829
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:57,770
We are bearing the brunt of someone else's fault

830
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:00,900
Yes, this is absolute injustice

831
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,810
Tell me more...

832
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:06,900
No. Else we will be sinned

833
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,100
We need you to descend, Sri Hari

834
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,350
Once upon a time...

835
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,440
There existed a Sri Hari Drama Company...

836
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,150
...with such prolific actors

837
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,020
Actors so great...

838
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:24,270
...even if woken up from deep sleep...

839
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:30,150
...they recited the dialgoues...even if asked to recite 
frontwards or backwards

840
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,020
And one day...

841
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:40,100
They were summoned by Amaravati to perform 
'Vishnu Purana'

842
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:45,850
They vowed not to leave the town without completing their 
performance

843
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:57,270
Not being able to perform the last part, they stayed 
back...but as convicts...

844
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:04,480
Having lost to the ruthless Abhiras, we are forced to live 
in hiding

845
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:14,060
We have surrendered to this art form...

846
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,020
...with these colourful masks...

847
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:23,400
Protect us, O Sri Hari...you are our only hope...

848
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:34,400
Understood, Achyuthanna?

849
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,150
Yes Sir!

850
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:37,310
Without performing their final play, 
these guys can't leave this town.

851
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,480
Exactly!

852
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,440
Sir, let's see if we can find a clue about the loot

853
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:15,230
He's not one of us!!!

854
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,900
Who the hell are you? Why are you here?Tell me.

855
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,440
Garuda (eagle) is here!

856
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,100
Come here!

857
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,650
Sri Hari!!

858
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,650
Sri Hari!! Please protect us

859
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:51,650
Sri Hari, where did he go?

860
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:54,150
Sri Hari!

861
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,980
Sri Hari, henceforth, you have to protect us from Jairam

862
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,270
Since he divine message arrived, why 
are you still hiding your identity from us, dear one?

863
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,350
We have awaited your arrival for so long. 
Please don't make us wait any longer, Sri Hari

864
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:07,850
Help us perform our final play and leave this town

865
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,850
Shut up Achyuthanna!

866
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:12,980
How did you all come here?

867
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,400
What did you do with the treasure hunter?

868
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,020
Don't worry. He's safe at his home, Sri Hari

869
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,600
We got confused and mistook him to be our Sri Hari

870
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:30,600
Had we known that you are the real Sri Hari, 
we'd have kidnapped you right at the beginning

871
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,190
They have given us the responsibility to 
take you along

872
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:34,400
One minute.

873
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,690
There seems to be some confusion here

874
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,650
There was a confusion yesterday

875
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,900
After the prophecy came true, there is no confusion

876
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,100
What prophecy?

877
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:44,810
The one that came true yesterday!

878
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,850
Sri Sri Guptananda swamiji had predicted a decade ago that 
the divine message would be delivered on a full moon night

879
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:55,230
Yes, I did...Garuda (eagle)

880
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,230
But only a part of my prediction came true

881
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:05,060
The rest of it will be fulfilled by Sri Hari himself!

882
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,940
It is his love alone that can redeem you all 
from your troubles

883
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:15,980
Yes. My predictions can never come tru...damn!

884
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:17,730
My predictions can never go wrong

885
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,900
Are you able to get it Achyuthanna?

886
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,770
I do. But I'm unable to believe it

887
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,060
I know!

888
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:28,350
Actually, I had told the swamiji to not reveal everything

889
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,810
Because some things should be kept secretive

890
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,690
But that idiot has told them everything!

891
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:33,940
It's ok sir, forget it!

892
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,100
Come here boys

893
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:43,190
Dear Sri Hari, please let us perform one last play. 
We'll leave this town after that

894
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:47,310
But before that, the second part of the prophecy has 
to be fulfilled

895
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,400
Don't worry, our sir will do it all

896
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,150
Don't worry at all!

897
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:57,350
By the way, haven't your team mates shared 
the location of the hidden loot?

898
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,400
No sir

899
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,850
I'm merely enquiring, that's all...

900
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:05,020
We get a salary, isn't it? I'm least interested in the loot

901
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:07,400
But curiosity is a trait we all have, isn't it Achyuthanna?

902
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,310
True

903
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,560
Back then, these guys were all just kids Achyuthanna

904
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,100
I don't mean to say it was exactly them

905
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,440
They were others in their troupe, isn't it? 
Wouldn't they have been informed?

906
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,560
Obviously they'd have!

907
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,850
I'm sure they know they know it too

908
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,600
They're just scared that's all, poor fellows!

909
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,980
If they don't disclose it, won't they anger you, sir?

910
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:29,230
I'm just scared that in your anger, 
you might just abandon them and go back

911
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,900
They had made a map to guide them to the hidden loot

912
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,650
That's all we know...

913
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,940
That's a great idea, sir!

914
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:45,560
If they have hidden the loot in an unknown place, they must 
have a map to guide them to that spot, isn't it?

915
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:47,230
So...

916
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,310
...where's the map?

917
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:52,230
We don't know that sir

918
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,850
Really? None of you know it?

919
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,900
No sir

920
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,650
If these guys don't know

921
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:02,310
And these guys are dead

922
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:04,440
There is only one guy!

923
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:08,690
Bandmaster!

924
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:13,440
If there is any information about the map, he must have it

925
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:14,190
But...

926
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:15,520
...he is crazy

927
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:18,560
We can fix him!

928
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,060
Stop, Achyuthanna! Stop testing them

929
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:24,230
Sit! Sit down!

930
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,520
Now what do we do with them?

931
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,440
They don't know anything much, Achyuthanna

932
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,480
We got to know there's a map, find it

933
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,100
In the police station?

934
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,850
What are you searching for, sir?

935
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,150
Ah! Got it!

936
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,690
Achyuthanna, please treat them well

937
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,650
I'm off to shock the daylights out of someone

938
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,520
Who, sir?

939
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:49,850
The bandmaster

940
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,770
You should leave this town!

941
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:55,850
Your life is in danger

942
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,480
Please leave the town right away Narayana

943
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:00,100
I've earned only two things in this town, Miss Lakshmi

944
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:00,940
One is friendship

945
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:01,690
The other is love

946
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,520
If I'm in danger, it's only because of one person

947
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:06,980
Narayana, listen!

948
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:10,060
I know why you staged that act of conducting the final 
rites of those drama folk!

949
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,270
I'm not a fool!

950
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,480
I didn't come there to witness your drama

951
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,270
I've been following the activities of those drama 
folk for many years now

952
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:23,060
Even I'm aware that they still continue to 
live in this town

953
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,850
I'm not sure I follow what you're saying...

954
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,400
You're not the only intelligent one here, 
listen...

955
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:32,770
...they have this superstition that some Sri Hari will 
arrive and rid them of their troubles

956
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:35,520
And for some strange reason, they believe it's you!

957
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,690
Why do you call it superstition, Miss Lakshmi?

958
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:40,270
I mean, it's definitely possible

959
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:43,730
May be. But it's that possibility that has put your 
life at risk

960
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,980
There's another camp amongst that drama troupe. And they 
don't believe in the concept of the lord

961
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,480
In fact, they are dangerous

962
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:53,850
They had different plans. And now you are posing to be a 
threat to those plans by pretending to be Sri Hari

963
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:57,940
I'm overwhelmed by your concern Miss Lakshmi

964
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,270
Really, I swear!

965
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:00,560
But don't worry

966
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:01,850
This gun here, his name is...

967
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:04,100
...hands-up

968
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:07,440
No matter how dangerous they may be, they will have to bow 
down before hands-up

969
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:10,190
So you've decided to risk your life

970
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,060
Alright. You'd rather know the complete truth

971
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,020
You've witnessed only one side of the drama troupe. 
Not the other

972
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,270
Come with me

973
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,020
Where to?

974
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,600
I didn't want anybody to know that I've been following them

975
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,690
But now, you've got involved in this equation

976
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:32,230
It's all God's wish, Miss Lakshmi!

977
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,520
Nothing is in our hands

978
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:39,150
I didn't even know that such a spot existed in this town!

979
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,190
This place has a lot of resemblance to the Abhira fort!

980
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,310
Where does this path lead to?

981
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,150
You'll know soon enough

982
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:55,440
Miss Lakshmi, don't you get scared of undertaking such 
adventures?

983
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,100
Why should I be scared?

984
01:23:57,230 --> 01:24:00,650
I might be there to protect you today. 
But what about when I'm not around?

985
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:05,270
Single girl. Don't you think it's better to have somebody 
with you at all times?

986
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:10,810
Like your father maybe. Doesn't he get worried 
when you set out alone like this?

987
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:13,270
My father left us and went away during my childhood

988
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:14,980
Went with whom?

989
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,310
Because even my father eloped and went away 
with a foreigner a long time ago!

990
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,400
Let's focus on the task at hand now?

991
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,060
Do you miss your father?

992
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,770
I missed him a lot for two months

993
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,940
Then you got used to his absence?

994
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,440
No, then he himself returned home!

995
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:39,810
Funny fellow!

996
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,690
What about your father?

997
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:47,940
He's dead

998
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:50,440
I'm sorry

999
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,150
Was he unwell?

1000
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,810
Looks like you miss him a lot

1001
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,520
No

1002
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,600
He made my family suffer

1003
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:16,440
And he dragged us all down with his death

1004
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:20,940
So yes, I don't miss him

1005
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,940
But if he was in poor health, 
how's it his fault, Miss Lakshmi?

1006
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,600
This way. A little further down

1007
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,150
If the body is afflicted with disease, it can be accepted

1008
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,190
But not the mind

1009
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,940
My father's biggest problem was his desires

1010
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:44,150
But when desire turns to greed, not only does it destroy 
one's own life, but also of your dear ones

1011
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:46,900
What did your father do for a living?

1012
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:49,940
He was part of a drama troupe 
before he got into robbery

1013
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:52,730
What about your family?

1014
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,600
Family doesn't always mean we have to be 
related by blood, Narayana

1015
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,600
I have a family much bigger than that

1016
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:04,020
At one point, everybody would accompany 
my father and perform plays in various towns

1017
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:09,770
My father's mistakes have forced them all to 
give up their identity and go into hiding

1018
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:17,150
Who are you?

1019
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,650
I told you a while ago

1020
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:22,980
Not everybody amongst the drama folk believe 
in that prophecy...

1021
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:26,480
...and your life is in danger because of them

1022
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,690
What was the gun's name, again?

1023
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,520
Why are you standing Miss Lakshmi? Please take a seat

1024
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,230
So can you please tell me who amongst you beat me up?

1025
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:21,690
You b@#$%^d!!! She had a gun, isn't it? Why didn't you just 
tell me that you wanted to tie me up??

1026
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:25,190
So Miss Lakshmi, what's new?

1027
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,520
What do you want?

1028
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:28,310
Tea, coffee...something to drink

1029
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:34,520
Nobody knew of our existence in this village

1030
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:35,810
How did you get to know?

1031
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,230
How did I get to know....

1032
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:44,230
Actually, I was out for a walk. 
That's when I heard songs from the forest

1033
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:47,900
I thought a party was going on and wanted to join them

1034
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,440
Look at the co-incidence!

1035
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:53,520
Your people were rejoicing that the prophecy has come true 
and surrendered to me that I'm their Sri Hari!

1036
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:59,020
Which Sri Hari?? The rest of them may believe that 
rogue swamiji's fake predictions.

1037
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,900
But we are not fools

1038
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:01,940
You please keep quiet

1039
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:04,440
You should've seen that eagle sitting on my shoulder last 
night. It was a sight!

1040
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,400
You missed it Miss Lakshmi!

1041
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,520
Sudhakar!

1042
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,060
Oh oh oh...

1043
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,730
You are also a part of this? Nice!

1044
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:24,100
This eagle, too

1045
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:27,520
We managed to evade the eyes of everyone all this time

1046
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,850
But staying here longer means trouble for us all

1047
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,310
We want to leave without performing the final play, but the 
troupe will do so only if Sri Hari says it

1048
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:39,400
Which is why we wanted the eagle to sit on Sudhakar and make 
it seem like the prophecy has come true

1049
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:44,270
But if you plan amongst yourselves, how will it work out? 
The eagle should've been a part of it, too

1050
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:49,270
Of course he was trained. 
But you hit my head and wore this armlet

1051
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:50,980
So it sat on you instead of Sudhakar

1052
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,650
This can't be a mere co-incidence, Narayana

1053
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:55,770
Oh god! Please believe me Miss Lakshmi

1054
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,350
I swear on God I'm innocent

1055
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,480
I don't believe you!

1056
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:03,900
Ok then. If you don't believe me despite swearing on God, 
then I don't want to be here for a moment longer

1057
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,810
Hey you! Untie me, now!

1058
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:10,600
He will not disclose anything, Lakshmi.

1059
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:12,560
What do we do with him?

1060
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,440
First let's think on how to convince our people

1061
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:18,850
Until then, let him be here

1062
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:21,190
Hey..

1063
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,690
Hey.. What are you doing??

1064
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:23,690
I want you to faint!

1065
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:28,810
I'll deal with this nitiwit later. But before that...

1066
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:29,850
...bandmaster...

1067
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,270
If I have to fix him...

1068
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,270
I need to convince Jairam

1069
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:43,400
Impossible! You can't convince him, but you can fool him. 
You have to play some tricks

1070
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:47,190
Found it!

1071
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:51,730
It's not easy. It's risky. If we get caught...

1072
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:52,900
...this will be your fate, too

1073
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:15,980
Happy married life!

1074
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:39,810
Hey..

1075
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,690
Please take care of the horse till I'm back

1076
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,770
If master finds out, you'll be in trouble, Soma

1077
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:05,440
Take care of the horse. 
If I don't go back on time, a wedding might get called off

1078
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,940
I have to convey an important message to Jairam sir

1079
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:25,900
I'll speak to the master and be back

1080
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,310
What are they both doing with your horse?

1081
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,440
I've gifted it to them

1082
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:43,100
Careful...old memories of my dad

1083
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:46,900
I told you it's old!

1084
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,940
But you're not one to gift people without expecting 
anything in return....

1085
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,270
Oh come on, they're helping me too...

1086
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:57,100
Now please don't ask how are they helping me!

1087
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:00,770
You won't find anything in there today

1088
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,440
I remember what happened the last time!

1089
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,900
Even we remember what happened the last time very well!

1090
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,730
You are looting your master's close friend

1091
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:20,100
If Jairam gets to know....

1092
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,310
Apparently, he's master's close friend!

1093
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,810
This hasn't ended. Remember that!

1094
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,060
Anything left?

1095
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:34,560
Here, take this!

1096
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,350
Leave, Ugra. Hunt them down and drag them here

1097
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:11,650
Until then, I'll introduce these four men to our guest

1098
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,770
Keep an eye on him

1099
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,350
Inspector Narayana!

1100
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:50,270
You've come at the right time!

1101
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,980
Do you know these four men?

1102
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,350
They are the ones who kidnapped the treasure hunter

1103
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:08,400
But they are mere puppets

1104
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,230
If you pay them, they will dance to anybody's tunes

1105
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:22,230
I was trying to get them to disclose the identity 
of their boss and you arrived

1106
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:27,810
Why Narayana? What happened?

1107
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:34,480
There's fear written all over your face. Nervousness, too

1108
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:39,650
That record, sir. It's making me nervous

1109
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,850
And why, may I ask?

1110
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:52,270
That music reminds me of my father

1111
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:59,400
Old memories often haunt us, sir...

1112
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:04,520
So what brings you here?

1113
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:07,400
Ah! I totally forgot!

1114
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:12,600
Tukaram has all the details of you crucifying his men

1115
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:21,020
Which means some of your men are still leaking 
information to him

1116
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:22,560
I was shocked when I got to know of it

1117
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:23,850
So, came over to tell you the same

1118
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:24,770
Ok

1119
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,060
Anything else?

1120
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:29,440
Sir

1121
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:32,270
So you came all the way to tell me just this?

1122
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,810
Anything more?

1123
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,810
Looks like you didn't get along very well with 
your father...

1124
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,060
I just felt that way looking at this picture, that's all

1125
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:51,480
Why did he make you stand behind like an 
outsider instead of making you sit next to him?

1126
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,020
Then we both have something in common now!

1127
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,480
My father was exactly like him

1128
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,810
He loved playing with guns

1129
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:05,060
He'd always keep me as a target while shooting

1130
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:07,940
Funny fellow!

1131
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,480
But how can one trust a gun, sir?

1132
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,310
What if one fires a shot by mistake?

1133
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,350
Even if the intent is right, if one's luck is on the 
wrong side, anything can happen, right?

1134
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,190
One day, the same thing happened in our house

1135
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:22,270
But luckily, the gun was in my hand and I was aiming at him!

1136
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,020
Poor fellow, he died!

1137
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,400
Have you ever regretted it?

1138
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:32,770
Why sir?

1139
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:35,770
Because he died at your hands...

1140
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:38,690
Every now and then, I do think of him

1141
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:40,150
After all, he's my father

1142
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,770
Just like you, memories haunt me too

1143
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:45,850
But don't think of me as a heartless man

1144
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:48,350
He's troubled me a lot

1145
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:51,730
He would always stand behind the door and 
watch my activities

1146
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:53,600
He liked punishing me for my mistakes

1147
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,230
But I was smart, too!

1148
01:36:55,940 --> 01:37:02,980
I'd tip toe to the door, silently open it 
and there he would be!

1149
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:08,060
Hey, you're not my father!

1150
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:09,230
Master!

1151
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:13,520
I was standing guard at the door because 
you can't trust this man

1152
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,730
Were you standing guard or eavesdropping 
on our conversation?

1153
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:19,310
Why would I do that master?

1154
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,810
I don't have to answer that question

1155
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,520
The ring in your pocket will answer that

1156
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:24,350
My pocket?

1157
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:34,400
While I was getting into the fort, I saw him 
playing with this ring

1158
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:37,150
I had seen this on Tukaram's finger

1159
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:43,190
How did this ring come into your possession, Narsi?

1160
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:43,940
Master!

1161
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:52,270
Jairam sir, a couple of stones are missing from his ring. 
Who are your accomplices, Narsi?

1162
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:57,350
We got these from the pockets of those five men

1163
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:07,400
A slave who is overcome by desires, 
will not think twice to loot his master's own friend

1164
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:08,730
He's lying master!

1165
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:13,100
In the same way, they will not think twice 
to bow down before their master's enemy

1166
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,100
Why would we loot him master?

1167
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,480
Don't believe him!

1168
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:19,350
We found these stones when we looted a wedding 
the other day

1169
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:23,850
How did you find the stones from Tukaram's ring 
while looting the wedding party, Mara?

1170
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,310
Tukaram?

1171
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:30,440
You eat at the fort and then lick the remains off 
Tukaram's plate??

1172
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:36,440
Please believe us. These stones were with the inspector. We 
found them while checking his pocket at the fort entrance

1173
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:41,440
A while ago, you said you looted it from the wedding party

1174
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,770
Now you're trying to frame me! That's wrong, isn't it?

1175
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:45,600
Who else was standing guard at the entrance?

1176
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:47,100
Us master

1177
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:57,770
I warned you that it hadn't ended. 
You wanted to know how they were helping me out

1178
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,100
Now you'll know

1179
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:04,060
But master, they weren't even guarding the 
post at that time!

1180
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:07,520
He's lying master! We didn't even move an inch from 
our post! We were there at all times

1181
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,060
Absolute lie!

1182
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:12,600
They promised to help the inspector. 
Please don't believe them master!

1183
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:13,520
Lies again!

1184
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:16,520
They're trying to pass on the blame to save their 
lives master

1185
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:20,270
We didn't see them taking any stones from 
the inspector, master

1186
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:40,100
Bhadra, I'm giving you one last chance to live

1187
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,350
Tell me the truth

1188
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,940
Were they all with you?

1189
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,600
What are your thoughts, bandmaster?

1190
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:00,520
How will Jairam deal with them?

1191
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,940
Master, Bhadra is lying!

1192
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:05,020
Try to recollect bandmaster...

1193
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,690
Master, this looks like a conspiracy

1194
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,900
15 years ago, a similar situation had unfolded

1195
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:13,520
I have never cheated or lied to you master

1196
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:14,730
Please listen to me

1197
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:16,190
That inspector....

1198
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,440
Ok, I'll listen to you

1199
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:25,770
How did Tukaram's ring come into your possession?

1200
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,270
On one side a gun-wielding Ram Ram

1201
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,980
On the other, the six drama folk who were counting 
their final moments

1202
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:35,190
The six of them were heinously murdered

1203
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,730
I've been your faithful servant for so long

1204
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,400
Why would I be disloyal and bow my head before Tukaram?

1205
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:53,310
That's exactly what I'm asking, Narsi. 
Why did you bow your head before that dog?

1206
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:56,100
I know that incident haunts you even today

1207
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:59,730
What if that incident repeats before you again?

1208
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:02,440
My loyalties haven't shifted master

1209
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,310
Please believe me

1210
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:07,100
If your loyalties are with me,

1211
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:13,730
then will you believe me if I say you won't die 
if I fire this gun?

1212
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:54,770
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA

1213
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:05,150
Sir, if you shoot at once, how can it be a punishment? 
It will be liberation, sir

1214
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:08,190
Such traitors should be tortured every day and finally 
killed

1215
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,480
Vibhasu, the inspector is right

1216
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,190
Throw them into the dungeon

1217
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:17,310
Master! Please....

1218
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:20,230
Sir, my work here is done. I'll take your leave now

1219
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:29,650
Narayana, even I was wondering, as said by Narsi, if all 
this was indeed part of a conspiracy hatched by you....

1220
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:32,770
Sir, you think I'd try to deceive you?

1221
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:35,770
Do you know the difference between intelligence and 
foolishness?

1222
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,600
Intelligence has its limits

1223
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:39,560
But foolishness is limitless

1224
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,650
I know you have found the drama troupe that 
I've been in search of for the past 15 years

1225
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,020
They will all come to my fort in a few moments

1226
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:54,230
They will be liberated soon upon their arrival

1227
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,100
But you?

1228
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:02,190
I will not liberate you so soon!

1229
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:08,900
As per your suggestion, I will torture you everyday and kill 
you

1230
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:15,190
B@#$%^d! I should've known when he put his hand 
on my shoulder

1231
01:43:25,230 --> 01:43:26,770
We can't trust that inspector.

1232
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:31,440
What if he's hand in glove with that Tukaram 
and is fooling us?

1233
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:34,690
If that's the case,

1234
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,060
master won't spare us tomorrow!

1235
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:41,560
Shut up! Thank god, master didn't suspect us

1236
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:43,190
Let's take one day at a time

1237
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,400
Hey!

1238
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,600
Look, we may have to live together for a few days

1239
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:53,440
As roommates, why fight amongst ourselves?

1240
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,150
Let's become friends

1241
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:13,560
Ah! Stay right there. We can shake hands from 
wherever we are standing

1242
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:22,060
Catch him!

1243
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:28,400
Once he gets to know they're innocent, 
Jairam will definitely trace the guilty!

1244
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,150
It's dangerous to stay here. 
I will leave right away!

1245
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:36,310
So will you go to Tukaram now?

1246
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:36,850
Yes

1247
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:39,190
This tunnel will lead us to the exit. Come!

1248
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:43,060
One minute

1249
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:43,440
What??

1250
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,770
We found only four of them

1251
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:56,600
We can get them to disclose the whereabouts of the others

1252
01:44:56,690 --> 01:45:00,690
This one here tried to stop us. I've dragged him here

1253
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:14,310
Master....

1254
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:15,310
Oh!

1255
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:17,230
Hello!

1256
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:19,980
Sri Hari!

1257
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,850
Leave master alone. Or else I'll kill him!

1258
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:27,020
oh I don't think you're understanding the situation

1259
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:27,940
Achyuthanna, here!

1260
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:29,900
Apple!

1261
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,190
If any...

1262
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,310
Give me grapes!

1263
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:37,020
Please take some bananas too!

1264
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,230
Wow locally-grown bananas!

1265
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,440
If anything happens to us...your master drops dead

1266
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:42,310
Am I right, sir?

1267
01:45:57,730 --> 01:46:01,150
A gun that has taken aim, doesn't need 
permission to be fired, Ugra

1268
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:02,730
What are you looking at?

1269
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:03,810
Don't act in haste!

1270
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:07,730
Our master's life is at stake. Mind it

1271
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:11,650
I trust you have understood the situation. Let's proceed?

1272
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:36,560
Try all you want, but you will not leave this 
fort alive today

1273
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:37,770
Of course I will!

1274
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:39,730
It's getting a little delayed.

1275
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:42,440
I don't understand why though!

1276
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:47,940
Master!

1277
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:55,150
Any last words, Narayana?

1278
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:56,810
Sir, what's your height?

1279
01:46:58,230 --> 01:46:59,650
About seven feet?

1280
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,480
My dearest half brother!!

1281
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,650
Hello sir! You arrived at the right time!

1282
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:18,900
I was just thinking of you...

1283
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:20,020
Wishing a life of 100 years...

1284
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:22,810
...for myself!

1285
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:24,940
Everyone lower your guns

1286
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:27,940
I won't count till three

1287
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:34,520
I called them here

1288
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:42,020
You have committed a huge blunder by daring 
to step inside the fort again, Tukaram

1289
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:48,730
Despite the old age, your mind is sharp as ever! Good!

1290
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:51,900
My brother, the ever smart man!

1291
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:53,560
Marvelous!

1292
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:59,480
Tukaram sir, both brothers are meeting again after 
a long time. Have a good time. I'll leave now

1293
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:00,400
Achyuthanna...

1294
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:03,690
Narayana!

1295
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,310
I was thinking...

1296
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:09,690
What guarantee do I have that the fire which destroyed my 
brother, won't do the same to me in future?

1297
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:11,100
Isn't it, brother?

1298
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,440
So what if I extinguish the fire itself?

1299
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,270
Just to be safe. 
What do you think?

1300
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:21,270
I think it'd be nice if you look down for a moment

1301
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:36,350
Lovers of peace, please maintain peace!

1302
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:42,900
Achyuthanna

1303
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:43,980
Come!

1304
01:48:58,020 --> 01:48:59,020
Don't be in a hurry

1305
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:03,060
If Jairam shoots Tukaram, all of you shoot Jairam

1306
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:06,480
If Tukaram shoots Jairam, all of you shoot Tukaram

1307
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:10,810
If either of you manages to stay alive, 
please don't forget to inform me!

1308
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:11,850
I'm curious!

1309
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:17,940
One minute

1310
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:21,940
One of the guns doesn't have bullets in it

1311
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:23,190
Which one is it?

1312
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,650
I'm sure you'll find out!

1313
01:49:36,730 --> 01:49:38,520
We don't like being obligated to anyone

1314
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,600
We never forget the ones who have helped us

1315
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:41,850
Sir Come!

1316
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:52,690
I had promised my father that I wouldn't kill you

1317
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:55,020
I never go back on my word, Tukaram

1318
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:03,560
Lovers of peace, congrats!

1319
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,560
The fort is ours!

1320
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:14,600
Achyuthanna, what did we gain by going through all that 
trouble?

1321
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,190
Grapes!

1322
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:16,230
Locally-grown bananas

1323
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:16,650
Apple

1324
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:18,400
Because I was brave enough to bring them along

1325
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,770
So it's finally proved that you are indeed our Sri Hari!

1326
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:26,560
If you hadn't come at the right time, 
that Jairam would've finished us off!

1327
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,230
Ah! God's ways are such!

1328
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:31,690
Now only the prophecy...

1329
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:33,310
Achyuthanna, can you ask them to shut up!!

1330
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:39,310
Another word and I'll shoot you all!

1331
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:47,690
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA

1332
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:03,980
Achyuthanna...

1333
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,150
Coming sir

1334
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:11,560
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA

1335
01:51:13,230 --> 01:51:16,520
Every time he hears a gunshot, 
the bandmaster utters this line, Achyuthanna

1336
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:19,480
Where did he learn this line?

1337
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:25,100
If this line is etched in his memory before going crazy, 
what is its significance?

1338
01:51:25,770 --> 01:51:28,520
Rama Rama is the leader of the Abhiras

1339
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:34,230
Thusu Daksha Vrutha Jaripa...sounds like ancient Kannada, 
sir

1340
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:40,440
(Achyuthanna trying to decode)

1341
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:41,940
Sir,

1342
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,900
tusu means little

1343
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:50,150
Vrutha could mean a circle

1344
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:55,230
THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA. Do you know what it means?

1345
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:57,940
No

1346
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:58,900
Think again

1347
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:01,940
Does this line feature in any of your plays?

1348
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:04,270
I don't think so

1349
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:07,560
Do you really remember the dialogues from all your plays?

1350
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:13,480
Of course we do. Even if you wake us up from sleep, we'll 
recite all our dialogues without missing a line

1351
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:20,900
Even if woken up from deep sleep...

1352
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:29,190
they could recite the dialogues frontwards and backwards

1353
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:35,020
What if you recite it backwards?

1354
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,060
None of us can

1355
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:41,400
But I've heard that some amongst our previous generation 
were experts at reciting these lines backwards, too

1356
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:50,770
Parijatha Vrukshada Suttha Mara Mara 
(The mighty parijatha tree is surounded by many more trees)

1357
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,230
What??

1358
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:54,560
Parijatha Vrukshada Suttha Mara Mara!

1359
01:52:57,850 --> 01:52:59,350
Play: Samudra Mathana (Churning of the Ocean)

1360
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,310
Scene 36

1361
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:07,230
The Parijatha tree which emerges from the churning of the 
ocean is taken by Indra to be planted in his garden

1362
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:12,230
At sunset, the flowers on the Parijatha tree bloom

1363
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:18,230
its radiance pervades everywhere and 
sets aglow even the surrounding trees

1364
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:21,810
We had such a line in one of our plays, Sri Hari

1365
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:25,480
The final play that we want to perform, it's the same one. 
Samudra Mathana

1366
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:31,980
Final act. Final loot

1367
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:37,690
There is a connection between the parijatha tree 
and the loot, Achyuthanna

1368
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:43,100
The six of them haven't drawn a map to describe the 
location of the loot

1369
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,150
They have hidden it within the lines of their final play

1370
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:51,480
Achyuthanna, if we have to find the Parijatha tree....

1371
01:53:51,690 --> 01:53:53,020
...we have to watch their final play

1372
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:56,850
Enough. Enough with this, sir!

1373
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:59,520
How much longer will you trouble them?

1374
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:01,400
Please accept that you are indeed their Sri Hari!

1375
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:03,850
I would have Achyuthanna

1376
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:06,940
But the second part of the prophecy has to be fulfilled, 
isn't it?

1377
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:07,810
Exactly!

1378
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,600
How can I accept without it being fulfilled?

1379
01:54:09,730 --> 01:54:10,270
And what's that?

1380
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:12,600
What is it?

1381
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:18,600
No. Sri Hari is incomplete without Lakshmi

1382
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:25,060
If your troubles have to end with Sri Hari's help, 
then Sri Hari and Lakshmi should unite

1383
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:27,980
Which Lakshmi?

1384
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:33,600
Achyuthanna, we are doomed!

1385
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:35,900
Unless I charm her, we can't watch their final play

1386
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,520
Which Lakshmi, sir?

1387
01:54:42,810 --> 01:54:44,020
Have you given him anything to eat?

1388
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:46,100
He'd have had his fill with what we gave him yesterday!

1389
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,150
Water,

1390
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:57,690
I want water...

1391
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:02,900
We have to go to Sudhakar's press in an hour.. 
I've asked Raghuanna to assemble everyone there

1392
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,980
What about Sudhakar?

1393
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:05,060
He will come there, too

1394
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:10,100
But I doubt our people will accept 
Sudhakar as Sri Hari nstead of Narayana

1395
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:13,690
But how will Narayana become Sri Hari without the 
second half of the prophecy being fulfilled?

1396
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:18,060
I want food...

1397
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:24,730
Is it biryani?

1398
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:28,060
That's what I ate. You'll only get idlis.

1399
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,730
If I lie that I love Sudhakar

1400
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:39,690
and no one else can replace him, 
they'll definitely have to accept him

1401
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:42,690
Mr Shanku, can you please wipe my tears?

1402
01:55:47,150 --> 01:55:47,900
Why are you crying?

1403
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:48,400
Thank you

1404
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:50,520
Nothing,

1405
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:55,810
The affection with which you're feeding me 
reminds me of my father

1406
01:55:56,770 --> 01:56:00,150
He was exactly like this. He'd feed me everyday

1407
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:05,940
So sad. One day, he passed away while feeding me

1408
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:07,520
What happened?

1409
01:56:07,690 --> 01:56:08,770
That's a long story!

1410
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:12,400
He had kidnapped a police officer and was 
hiding him at our house

1411
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,940
You think the police department will take it lightly?

1412
01:56:15,230 --> 01:56:18,900
Two days. That's how they long they took to find him. 
They came home and encountered my father

1413
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:23,940
Somebody seems to be thinking of you...

1414
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:26,940
It must be the officials from my department

1415
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,520
I've been missing since yesterday, right?

1416
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:29,940
So they must have started to look for me

1417
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:34,600
Mr Shanku, idli

1418
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:38,270
oh..

1419
01:56:39,310 --> 01:56:41,230
oh.. You all are going through so much trouble for me

1420
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:45,310
If I were in Sudhakar's position, I could've helped you

1421
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:50,940
Oh god! This chutney is so spicy!

1422
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:57,770
Lakshmi! I think we're making a 
huge mistake keeping him here

1423
01:56:58,270 --> 01:57:01,400
It'll take long to convince our people that 
Sudhakar himself is Sri Hari

1424
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,560
We have no other option, Shanku

1425
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:08,150
If we let him go...I don't trust him one bit!

1426
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:09,940
But if we keep him here, it'll be a nuisance for us, too

1427
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:14,690
Anyway, our people have accepted him as Sri Hari. 
Let's use him for our plan

1428
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,400
We'll be with him anyway...

1429
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:19,440
We'll keep an eye on him until they all leave town

1430
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:23,480
Shanku, no matter how hard you try, I will not agree to this

1431
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:24,480
She must agree

1432
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:27,600
Lakshmi must agree to Narayana for our sake

1433
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:29,190
Garuda (eagle) has delivered the message

1434
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:30,480
So what if the message has been delivered?

1435
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:32,980
Garuda may choose to sit on someone else tomorrow!

1436
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:35,350
But Lakshmi is firm

1437
01:57:35,730 --> 01:57:38,150
She's already in love with someone else

1438
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:39,190
We don't believe it

1439
01:57:39,190 --> 01:57:40,100
You have no choice

1440
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:43,230
In a short while from now, Lakshmi will be 
here with her beloved!

1441
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:45,440
So you will believe only if you see it?

1442
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:46,400
She'll be here soon

1443
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,850
You will be in for a surprise!

1444
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,810
Am I too late?

1445
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,230
You're forgetting yourself, Narayana!

1446
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:24,020
No Miss Lakshmi. I'm in complete control

1447
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:25,400
Don't go back on your word

1448
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:27,900
Ask them to leave the town right away

1449
01:58:28,150 --> 01:58:28,730
Of course!

1450
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:31,980
Oh god! Lakshmi!

1451
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:35,020
Come, come

1452
01:58:35,690 --> 01:58:36,850
Slowly!

1453
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,560
One moment please! Listen up!

1454
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:44,020
Hey you! That's enough

1455
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:49,440
I'm so happy to see the joy on your faces

1456
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:54,230
Which is why as your very own Sri Hari, 
I promise you all that I will never disappoint you all

1457
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,770
Hey, tell them already...

1458
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:07,400
As your own Sri Hari, I hereby declare that you don't have 
to perform a final play to leave this town

1459
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:08,440
You can all leave

1460
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:12,730
Did you feel bad?

1461
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:13,400
Yes

1462
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:16,310
Ok then, finish the play and leave

1463
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:19,150
Hey you! Start the music!

1464
01:59:21,730 --> 01:59:22,440
Narayana!

1465
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:32,810
Drama master, until you finish the play, we'll all live in 
Sudhakar's society like one big family!

1466
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:36,850
Poor Sudhakar has no family of his own. 
Yes, yes. He'll be happy, too

1467
01:59:37,190 --> 01:59:37,850
Right Sudhakar?

1468
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:00,770
Alas he has descended...

1469
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:04,100
...a version of the lord himself

1470
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:10,770
Why do you need a Ray-Ban to adorn you?

1471
02:00:10,770 --> 02:00:12,770
A messiah...

1472
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:14,310
A saviour...

1473
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:18,560
A warrior who has arrived just for us...

1474
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:25,400
Show us your original form already!

1475
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:36,440
Should I?

1476
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:43,310
Narayana Narayana...

1477
02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:47,230
Srimannarayana....Narayana

1478
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:54,190
Narayana...Srimannarayana...Narayana

1479
02:01:08,230 --> 02:01:10,850
Shanka (conch), Chakra (wheel) and Gadhe (mace)...

1480
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:14,940
...where have they been kept?

1481
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:17,650
Shanka (conch), Chakra (wheel) and Gadhe (mace)...

1482
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:22,150
...where have they been kept?

1483
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:25,650
Let us join our palms...

1484
02:01:25,650 --> 02:01:29,190
...why have a doubt, let's just ask him

1485
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:35,310
Why the gun? Where is your mighty bow and arrow?

1486
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:39,600
When the vermilion adorns his forehead...

1487
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:43,230
...looks like a mark of victory...

1488
02:01:43,230 --> 02:01:49,230
A shining star, the apple of our eyes... 
oh,such a charmer you are!

1489
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:51,650
A messiah...

1490
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:57,100
A saviour...the whole world considers you so

1491
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:03,980
There is festivity at every door you enter

1492
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:18,020
Narayana...Srimannarayana...Narayana

1493
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,980
It's all your fault, Lakshmi

1494
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,940
Why are you blaming me?

1495
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:21,310
Shh...he's here

1496
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:23,850
Ah! Such joy...such happiness...

1497
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:30,400
Just take a look...

1498
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,480
Isn't their happiness that you wanted?

1499
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:37,020
They'll stay happy only if they're alive

1500
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:39,270
You've put all our lives at risk

1501
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:40,310
No way, Miss Lakshmi

1502
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:43,150
Jairam is locked up in his own fort

1503
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:45,230
Despite that, if you're still worried about their safety,

1504
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:50,600
Use this as a signal

1505
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:57,650
If ever your people are in trouble,

1506
02:02:57,850 --> 02:02:59,310
help shall be on its way

1507
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:30,060
For the beautiful...

1508
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:32,190
...Lakumi

1509
02:03:32,190 --> 02:03:33,770
She's so cool...

1510
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:39,940
Naryana is so full of love

1511
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:44,480
Wholeheartedly,

1512
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:47,770
the brilliant star...

1513
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:54,020
...is showering them with radiance

1514
02:03:55,020 --> 02:04:01,600
They are now the talk of the town

1515
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:07,900
Let every sound become music

1516
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:14,900
Sir add some more weight

1517
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:15,900
Come on down sir!

1518
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:18,100
A messiah...

1519
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:20,150
A saviour...

1520
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:24,940
Lakumi's better half...

1521
02:04:33,690 --> 02:04:35,310
Sir, please put it on!

1522
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:43,060
Aren't they a match made in heaven?

1523
02:04:43,150 --> 02:04:56,560
Narayana...Srimannarayana...Lakshminarayana

1524
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:13,230
A perfect match!

1525
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,350
Sir the rehearsals have begun, come!

1526
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:19,060
The story is simple, sir...

1527
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:26,650
During the Satya Yuga (Age of Truth), the gods and demons 
churned the ocean to get elixir

1528
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:31,060
Indra, a most precious element called the elixir remains 
hidden in the ocean floor

1529
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:37,100
If you churn the ocean, this elixir will emerge from its 
depths, thus causing tremendous good to the world

1530
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:38,310
How do we do it?

1531
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:42,560
Use Mount Mandara that is to the eastern side of Mount Meru, 
as the churner

1532
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:45,770
Ask the serpent god Vasuki to be the rope

1533
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:46,980
All will be well

1534
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:49,850
Mandara Hill as the churner

1535
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:52,900
Vasuki as the rope

1536
02:05:53,650 --> 02:05:54,150
See, there!

1537
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:58,150
Sri Hari takes on the Kurmavatar (tortoise) and lends his 
support to the churning

1538
02:05:58,520 --> 02:05:59,520
Why delay?

1539
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:03,400
Let the churning of the ocean begin for the 
great good of the world

1540
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:08,480
When the churning began

1541
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,100
Along with the elixir

1542
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:19,690
Kamadhenu, Airavatha, Chandra, Lakshmi... 
14 such gems emerged

1543
02:06:19,690 --> 02:06:23,560
And one such gem was...here, this Parijatha!

1544
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:29,980
So if we find this tree, 
will we find the missing loot?

1545
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:33,270
Maybe...but where do we look?

1546
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:35,560
It's simple. Geographical similarities

1547
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:36,810
What do you seen on stage?

1548
02:06:37,150 --> 02:06:39,480
Ksheera Saagra (The Mighty Ocean)

1549
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,600
There's a lake in Amaravati

1550
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:42,850
Mount Mandara

1551
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:44,650
There are seven hills in Amaravati

1552
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:48,020
Does that mean we have to search all the hills and the lake?

1553
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:48,520
No

1554
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:50,440
The Mandara mountain stands atop the ocean

1555
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:51,770
So...

1556
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,270
Sheshagiri Hill

1557
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:54,020
Exactly!

1558
02:06:56,650 --> 02:06:58,520
The mighty ocean and the Mandara mountain!

1559
02:07:03,230 --> 02:07:09,690
We'll need at least six months to find the Parijatha tree on 
this hill

1560
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:11,940
We don't have to look all over the hill, Achyuthanna

1561
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:14,060
Scene

1562
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:15,230
36

1563
02:07:16,150 --> 02:07:19,350
The parijatha tree that emerged from the churning of 
the ocean

1564
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:22,060
was planted in his royal garden by Indra

1565
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:22,520
That's enough

1566
02:07:23,690 --> 02:07:24,850
Royal garden in this case means the forest

1567
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:25,850
So...

1568
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,020
We just have to look in the forest of this hill

1569
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:30,980
But Sheshagiri Hill has no forest, Sir

1570
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:32,560
There isn't?

1571
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:33,150
No

1572
02:07:33,690 --> 02:07:34,770
Definitely not

1573
02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:38,940
There are forests only on Kalpagiri, Vishwamale and 
Pushpagiri hills only

1574
02:07:40,850 --> 02:07:42,520
We seem to be missing something, Achyuthanna

1575
02:07:43,150 --> 02:07:46,730
Until we crack the clue, we need to keep watching the 
rehearsals

1576
02:07:57,810 --> 02:07:58,100
Oh!

1577
02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:00,270
My dearest half brother!

1578
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:01,230
Please come!

1579
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:02,560
I was waiting for you

1580
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:06,810
I was sad that none from my family 
were here to celebrate my victory

1581
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:09,730
But you're family, too. So I asked them to fetch you

1582
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:12,100
Please sit

1583
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:16,440
By the way, how do I look in this attire?

1584
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:25,600
Remember when my mother and I were unceremoniously thrown 
out from this fort by you?

1585
02:08:27,150 --> 02:08:32,900
But today, you're being held captive by me 
in the very same fort!

1586
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:35,400
I am the supreme leader of this fort

1587
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:37,730
At least now, will you accept that I, too am an Abhira?

1588
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:49,310
A change of attire will not change the filthy blood that 
runs in your veins, Tukaram

1589
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:57,850
You're a wounded soldier, yet the pride is intact!

1590
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:03,310
Don't forget that it's Ram Ram's blood 
that runs in my veins, too!

1591
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:07,060
Ideally, I too should've been living in this fort as an 
Abhira amongst you!

1592
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:09,060
You don't and will never belong to this fort

1593
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:11,400
You snatched everything away from me!

1594
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:14,600
The respect that Abhiras held for me, my father's 
name...everything!

1595
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:17,600
I snatched only what you didn't deserve

1596
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,690
Our father trusted me more than you. 
And you couldn't tolerate that!

1597
02:09:20,690 --> 02:09:21,690
Which is why you....

1598
02:09:21,690 --> 02:09:27,730
What my father had in you wasn't trust. 
It was sympathy

1599
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:33,060
You will face everything that I had to, Jairam!

1600
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:40,730
What you snatched away from my life, 
will be duly snatched from you too!

1601
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:53,350
My father had vowed to wipe out 
the bloodline of the drama troupe

1602
02:09:54,600 --> 02:10:00,020
But just before he breathed his last, he made even that vow 
as my responsibility

1603
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:03,600
Tell me why?

1604
02:10:06,770 --> 02:10:14,440
He knew that you weren't capable of shouldering that 
responsibility

1605
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:32,940
You can never become an Abhira, Tukaram!

1606
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:07,060
Damn! We have to wait until dusk to watch their rehearsals

1607
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:07,560
Sudhakar!

1608
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:07,900
Lakshmi?

1609
02:11:07,980 --> 02:11:08,650
Distribute these to all

1610
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:08,940
Yes!

1611
02:11:09,230 --> 02:11:09,480
Quick!

1612
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:09,900
Yes

1613
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:15,020
Listen up, everyone!

1614
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:16,810
We need to keep an eye on Lakshmi, sir

1615
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:18,650
Yes, you're rigtht

1616
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:20,440
Drama master!

1617
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:20,730
Yes?

1618
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:23,940
Listen to this...

1619
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,400
...as per all your wishes, Lakshmi and I will get married

1620
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:29,520
We can have your show after that

1621
02:11:29,650 --> 02:11:30,480
How's that possible?

1622
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:32,810
It's only after our play is staged...

1623
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,690
...will all your responsibilities be over

1624
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:37,560
Until then, Lakshmi has to wait for you

1625
02:11:37,690 --> 02:11:38,350
Why should she?

1626
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:40,600
How can we keep a girl waiting?

1627
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:40,980
Oh my!

1628
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:44,190
After Goddess Lakshmi emerged from the mighty ocean...

1629
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:47,230
didn't she wait for Lord Vishnu to finish the samudra 
mathana,

1630
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:51,520
while meditating on Meru Mountain?

1631
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:56,600
Are you telling me this Lakshmi has to suffer 
because of the other Lakshmi?

1632
02:11:58,980 --> 02:11:59,310
Poor girl!

1633
02:12:00,190 --> 02:12:02,020
She has to wait for me for so long!

1634
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:06,730
Not that long. 
She seems to be in a hurry to get married to you

1635
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:07,520
Really?

1636
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:07,730
Yes

1637
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:09,480
Listen up!

1638
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:10,730
She seems to be announcing it already

1639
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:11,900
Did you all get the pamphlet?

1640
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:13,150
Yes!

1641
02:12:13,690 --> 02:12:14,690
Yes, everyone has gathered there

1642
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:16,230
[Title of Play: Samudra Manthana (churning of the ocean)]

1643
02:12:16,230 --> 02:12:17,650
Don't you all worry...

1644
02:12:17,850 --> 02:12:18,650
...you people...

1645
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:19,020
Wait!

1646
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:20,310
What is this, Miss Lakshmi?

1647
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:22,060
We are having the final performance in four days?

1648
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:25,690
With the support from our Sri Hari, all your desires...

1649
02:12:25,690 --> 02:12:26,900
...are turning into reality!

1650
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:28,810
Go and start the preparations

1651
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:33,150
Miss Lakshmi, I wanted to watch the rehearsals a few more 
times

1652
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:34,190
Oh God...

1653
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:35,150
What do we do?

1654
02:12:35,270 --> 02:12:37,690
These people are already preparing for the show

1655
02:12:40,770 --> 02:12:44,310
They'll get busy in putting up the set and props

1656
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:45,850
You're making a mistake

1657
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:47,480
Look there...

1658
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,310
...just once...

1659
02:12:51,150 --> 02:12:53,150
Such joy...such happiness

1660
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:55,690
Isn't that what you wanted?

1661
02:12:57,600 --> 02:13:00,270
Wait! Don't get be happy as yet

1662
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,270
I still haven't given my consent for the show

1663
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:03,400
Wait!

1664
02:13:04,150 --> 02:13:06,230
Disappointed? Then I'm sure he'll give us his consent

1665
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:09,190
Your beloved Sri Hari has vowed never to disappoint you

1666
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:19,560
Long live Sri Hari!

1667
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,900
Very good Sudhakar!

1668
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:43,310
Oh! Is my dear brother still asleep?

1669
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:45,060
Don't wake him up!

1670
02:13:45,190 --> 02:13:46,600
Poor fellow, he's in pain

1671
02:13:48,650 --> 02:13:49,520
Let him rest

1672
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:51,900
Ramchandra!

1673
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:59,020
Someone amongst you should be gracious enough to liberate 
him from this pain

1674
02:13:59,730 --> 02:14:03,230
And Tukaram will liberate you from this prison

1675
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:08,520
Gadipar

1676
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:11,850
I need you to do something for me

1677
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:22,190
Bandmaster, do you want to keep the moustache or shave it?

1678
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:25,690
Please tell us

1679
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:26,940
Ask him the right way and he'll tell you

1680
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:30,230
Just clean his ears with a feather and 
he'll answer without missing a beat

1681
02:14:35,810 --> 02:14:37,770
I had such a good impression about Miss Lakshmi

1682
02:14:38,060 --> 02:14:38,770
All gone now!

1683
02:14:39,190 --> 02:14:43,350
Sir, how are we to find the clues without being able to 
watch the rehearsals?

1684
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:44,060
Ouch!

1685
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:48,650
Didn't I tell you he won't miss a beat?

1686
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:56,150
We can' t ignore the similarities between Mount Mandara and 
Sheshagiri Hill

1687
02:14:56,940 --> 02:15:00,520
If there is a Parijatha tree, it has to be in a forest, but 
there is no forest on Sheshagiri Hill

1688
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:01,100
Maybe...

1689
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:04,020
The gem we are looking for isn't the parijatha tree...

1690
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:06,730
it must be one of the other 14 gems.

1691
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:10,770
You look so good! See...

1692
02:15:17,770 --> 02:15:21,480
You were punished all these years for a crime that you 
didn't commit

1693
02:15:22,190 --> 02:15:24,850
We are all responsible for your situation

1694
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:30,440
We can't replace all that you have lost

1695
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:35,690
But for as long as you stay with us, 
we promise to look after you

1696
02:15:40,810 --> 02:15:45,270
From now on, there won't be a single sour note in your life, 
I promise

1697
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:52,400
Please play something for us

1698
02:16:59,810 --> 02:17:04,100
Did you get the trumpet fixed, Miss Lakshmi?

1699
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:34,810
I have nothing to do with this 
It's these guys who looted the train

1700
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:45,270
Bandmaster...

1701
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:54,900
We're all your friends, bandmaster

1702
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:57,310
Don't be scared

1703
02:18:08,770 --> 02:18:09,810
Watch out, you moron!

1704
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:23,310
Lorry! Give the lorry back to me! I'll be on my way

1705
02:18:23,310 --> 02:18:24,520
Of course you can go

1706
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:28,810
But before that, tell me on which hill the loot is hidden

1707
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:29,150
The creeper...

1708
02:18:29,150 --> 02:18:29,560
Don't worry

1709
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:29,770
Creeper..?

1710
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,980
I will trace the loot

1711
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:34,560
Nothing can remain hidden from me

1712
02:18:55,850 --> 02:18:57,520
The guns have been arranged, Ugra

1713
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:01,060
But we don't have sufficient men to rescue our leader

1714
02:19:01,730 --> 02:19:03,480
Arrange for some more men

1715
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:16,690
The bandmaster threw sand in my face and ran away!

1716
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:19,600
Don't worry

1717
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:20,690
We're searching for him

1718
02:19:21,350 --> 02:19:22,600
I am as concerned about him as you

1719
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:26,400
I'm sure. But your concern is for a whole different reason

1720
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,440
Sorry!

1721
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:30,770
We searched your room without your permission

1722
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:33,440
What is this, Narayana?

1723
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:36,690
The sketch seems to have faded

1724
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:38,690
I can't seem to make out what is on it

1725
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:39,150
Lakshmi!

1726
02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:40,310
ohh..

1727
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:42,560
Is this your sketch Miss Lakshmi?

1728
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:43,350
Enough with your drama!!

1729
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:47,310
This is a sketch of the Goddess Lakshmi on the coins that 
are amongst the missing loot

1730
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:50,770
We know that you're doing all this 
only to get your hands on that loot

1731
02:19:50,770 --> 02:19:55,060
You're playing with our emotions for your own selfish 
motives, right?

1732
02:19:56,310 --> 02:19:59,560
I don't think you're the right person to talk about 
playing with emotions, Miss Lakshmi

1733
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:04,060
Didn't you have plans to fool your people into believing 
that Sudhakar himself was Sri Hari?

1734
02:20:04,060 --> 02:20:06,100
But I did that to save their lives

1735
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:07,730
Not for my selfish motives!

1736
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:11,150
You did this to compensate for your father's mistake

1737
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:13,190
Isn't that your selfishness?

1738
02:20:14,650 --> 02:20:18,400
Had the loot been taken out of Amaravati on that day,

1739
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:20,980
your people would've been leading a life of luxury

1740
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:23,520
None of you would have felt it was wrong

1741
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:26,310
Right and wrong are merely perceptions, Miss Lakshmi

1742
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:29,310
It depends on each one's point of view

1743
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:33,310
If you look at it from my perspective, 
my desire isn't wrong, too

1744
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:41,020
There's a Narayana and a Ravana within all of us

1745
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:45,980
My father kept playing Ravana in all his plays 
and finally chose to be one himself

1746
02:20:46,350 --> 02:20:47,850
You are committing the same mistake

1747
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:52,100
When the evil within you is destroyed and the good comes 
out,

1748
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:55,770
you will realise the difference between right and wrong

1749
02:20:58,310 --> 02:20:59,060
Lakshmi!

1750
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:03,900
This is a sketch of the Goddess Lakshmi on the coins that 
are amongst the missing loot

1751
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:25,940
Your game is up, Narayana. Leave

1752
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:29,560
Don't ever show us your face again

1753
02:21:32,770 --> 02:21:37,440
Are we searching for the wrong gem amongst the 14 gems?

1754
02:21:40,810 --> 02:21:43,650
After emerging from the depths of the ocean,

1755
02:21:43,650 --> 02:21:50,810
didn't Lakshmi meditate on Mount Meru awaiting the arrival 
of Sri Hari and Vishnu?

1756
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:54,940
Mount Meru....

1757
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:59,480
Use Mount Mandara that is to the eastern side of Mount Meru, 
as the churner

1758
02:22:01,150 --> 02:22:02,940
To the east of Mount Meru stands Mount Mandara...

1759
02:22:04,190 --> 02:22:05,150
That means...

1760
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:10,690
To the east of Mandara is...Meru

1761
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:19,690
The hills of Kalpagiri, Vishwamale and Pushpagiri 
are the only ones that have forests

1762
02:22:21,150 --> 02:22:25,350
Lakshmi, there's no need to listen to him anymore

1763
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:25,940
You're right

1764
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:29,560
You don't have to listen to me anymore

1765
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:43,770
Cage them all in a room

1766
02:22:44,980 --> 02:22:46,980
Take them away

1767
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:50,730
I'll personally carry Miss Lakshmi

1768
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:11,730
Someone please open the door! Open!

1769
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:14,650
How did you get here!!!

1770
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:16,810
I don't know Lakshmi!

1771
02:23:16,810 --> 02:23:18,060
I only remember going to sleep last night

1772
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:19,650
When we woke up this morning, we were locked in here!

1773
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:20,730
Untie me!

1774
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:23,480
I haven't seen Sri Hari since morning!

1775
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:25,850
It is your Sri Hari himself who has locked us up in here!

1776
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:29,190
Then I'm sure he has plan behind it

1777
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:31,100
Then stay right here

1778
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:33,060
We very well know what your Sri Hari's plan....

1779
02:23:44,190 --> 02:23:45,770
I have something to tell you all....

1780
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:02,440
Where should we find the tree in this forest?

1781
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:04,730
Lakshmi sat in meditation under a tree.

1782
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:06,600
There will be a mark

1783
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:11,520
They haven't any left marks on any tree

1784
02:24:12,270 --> 02:24:14,480
Sir, there are many trees here

1785
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:15,770
How do we single out the tree we want without a single clue?

1786
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:18,560
Which tree would you have selected Achyuthanna?

1787
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:21,190
Probably, the tallest tree, sir

1788
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:23,190
But they all look the same height

1789
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:25,770
Then probably one with the broadest trunk

1790
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:29,350
Basically, you'd have selected a unique tree

1791
02:24:32,650 --> 02:24:37,440
So whichever tree you think is unique should lead us to the 
loot

1792
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:42,850
Creeper...

1793
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:49,400
Rather than mark trees, I think they've planted creepers

1794
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:55,520
This is the only tree with a creeper, I'm digging here...

1795
02:24:57,560 --> 02:25:02,560
Despite your plan, whom did the eagle finally sit on instead 
of Sudhakar?

1796
02:25:02,730 --> 02:25:05,770
On Narayana. Don't you think it's God's will?

1797
02:25:05,980 --> 02:25:06,810
Yes, yes!

1798
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:11,350
If he was indeed the real Sri Hari, he should've 
charmed our Lakshmi by now. He hasn't!

1799
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:19,440
Lakshmi!

1800
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:23,310
I knew he was upto no good!

1801
02:25:23,850 --> 02:25:24,980
Don't worry

1802
02:25:25,690 --> 02:25:28,560
I've made all arrangements for your safety

1803
02:25:34,850 --> 02:25:38,150
Don't worry. The guns are for your protection

1804
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:42,730
Hey! What are you doing!!

1805
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:44,440
Why are you dragging them away?

1806
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:41,230
Don't take unnecessary trouble Narayana. 
The situation is beyond your control now.

1807
02:26:43,310 --> 02:26:44,730
But there's no harm in trying, isn't it Gadipar?

1808
02:26:49,230 --> 02:26:52,150
Hey you! Go and inform Tukaram. Leave now!

1809
02:26:56,770 --> 02:26:59,770
Master, we've dragged the drama folks to the fort

1810
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:05,520
I'm probably the first leader to set his own fort on fire 
on the day of ascending the throne!

1811
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:10,730
Where are you going?

1812
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:12,440
Lakshmi....

1813
02:27:14,310 --> 02:27:15,100
Move it!

1814
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:19,440
Make all the arrangements

1815
02:27:26,270 --> 02:27:27,150
Who is that?

1816
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:30,690
Go check who that is

1817
02:27:30,810 --> 02:27:31,310
Ok sir!

1818
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:34,350
You all carry on

1819
02:27:34,650 --> 02:27:36,190
This fort has to burn in to ashes

1820
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:38,690
When shall we light it up

1821
02:27:38,690 --> 02:27:40,100
let's wait for the orders

1822
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:17,060
It is better to kill one and save ourselves 
than all of us being killed to save one

1823
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:18,560
He is our leader!

1824
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:22,350
Deceiving him is like deceiving the throne!

1825
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:29,270
I was loyal to the throne all these years. 
What did I get in return??

1826
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:38,900
He chose to believe an outsider and was ready to kill us!

1827
02:28:39,060 --> 02:28:40,440
Why should I be loyal to such a man?

1828
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:41,100
Narsi!

1829
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:46,400
Right now we should only focus on escaping from here

1830
02:28:46,770 --> 02:28:48,690
We've traced a way out Vibhasu.

1831
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:55,060
If we bow our heads before Tukaram, 
at least our lives will be spared

1832
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:19,350
Listen up! Don't you dare raise your hand on him again. 
I will not spare you!

1833
02:29:19,350 --> 02:29:23,100
Will you just shut up Achyuthanna! 
Every time you say that, he hits me even more!

1834
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:28,190
I won't spare you guys!

1835
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:32,020
Load the chest to the jeep. Tukaram will be waiting for us

1836
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:37,230
I'm curious, can we take a look inside?

1837
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:44,690
If Tukaram finds out, he will set us on fire along with the 
Abhiras and the drama troupe

1838
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:50,060
Your drama troupe friends are already in Tukaram's captivity

1839
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:53,150
None of them will be alive by dawn

1840
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:02,440
Tukaram will not find out. 
So what's the harm in taking a look at it?

1841
02:30:03,190 --> 02:30:04,560
Whatever it is, hurry up!

1842
02:30:17,730 --> 02:30:22,100
That chest is only filled with stones. 
Where's the loot Narayana?

1843
02:30:27,150 --> 02:30:30,100
Hang the constable from the 
nearest tree and come to the fort!

1844
02:30:30,730 --> 02:30:32,770
I'll go and inform Tukaram

1845
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:34,770
Don't bury him!!

1846
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:38,350
Stop!!!

1847
02:30:38,650 --> 02:30:42,730
Anybody here at all??

1848
02:30:55,650 --> 02:30:56,560
Drink!

1849
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:05,600
I know you're all scared. 
But, there are two paths ahead of you

1850
02:31:08,350 --> 02:31:10,310
One: being loyal to me

1851
02:31:10,690 --> 02:31:15,400
Two: begging Tukaram for your survival

1852
02:31:16,270 --> 02:31:16,980
Drink up!

1853
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,560
Drink up!

1854
02:31:30,730 --> 02:31:32,270
Master!

1855
02:31:58,270 --> 02:32:04,480
My lifelong dream will finally come true tonight, Ramchandra

1856
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:08,940
Henceforth, the Abhira fort will....

1857
02:32:14,480 --> 02:32:17,770
You have promised our father that you won't kill me, Jairam

1858
02:32:17,770 --> 02:32:19,940
Who said I would kill you?

1859
02:32:30,350 --> 02:32:36,690
Meeting you after ages, Gadipar. Excuse our poor hospitality

1860
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:40,100
Master is waiting for you

1861
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:53,350
Gadipar!

1862
02:32:56,600 --> 02:32:59,770
We found the chest master, but it was filled with stones

1863
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:02,980
Bandmaster!

1864
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:12,350
No. I've seen the chest filled with precious loot

1865
02:33:14,900 --> 02:33:25,850
If the loot that was there is missing now, 
then someone must've taken it

1866
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:38,770
It was your drama troupe friends who looted and hid it. 
So, someone amongst you has stolen it. Who is it?

1867
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:52,520
If you don't reveal who that is, I'll skin you alive and 
make buntings out of it and tie it all over Amaravati!

1868
02:33:53,230 --> 02:33:53,980
Where's the loot?

1869
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:54,810
I don't know!

1870
02:34:08,020 --> 02:34:14,770
Damn! Went through so much trouble 
and all I find is an empty chest!

1871
02:34:15,850 --> 02:34:17,350
My poor father must be relentlessly searching for me....

1872
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:19,020
Oh god!

1873
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:23,020
Narayana stop!

1874
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:24,350
Oxygen, oxygen!

1875
02:34:25,020 --> 02:34:26,980
If you struggle too much, there won't be much oxygen left!

1876
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:28,520
Take a deep breath

1877
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:31,350
Not so much!

1878
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:33,020
You need oxygen for later, too!

1879
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,310
What's this fragrance?

1880
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:39,690
Such a lovely smell!

1881
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:44,560
Flower

1882
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:50,230
So sad. Must've bloomed minutes ago. 
But is already returned to dust

1883
02:34:51,270 --> 02:34:54,190
It's life, too has lost meaning. Just like mine

1884
02:34:57,020 --> 02:34:59,150
Oh wait...there is meaning...

1885
02:35:00,770 --> 02:35:01,770
If it has bloomed in the night...

1886
02:35:17,980 --> 02:35:19,520
Parijatha!

1887
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:28,100
RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA

1888
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:44,690
PARIJATHA VRUKSHADA SUTTHA MARA MARA 
(The mighty parijatha tree is surrounded by many more trees)

1889
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:51,810
At sunset, the flowers on the parijatha tree bloom

1890
02:35:51,810 --> 02:35:57,850
and its radiance pervades everywhere and sets aglow even the 
surrounding trees

1891
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:15,230
Where's the loot? Tell me!

1892
02:36:53,730 --> 02:36:57,850
The loot is safe where it was hidden, Jairam

1893
02:36:57,850 --> 02:37:03,440
I'll take you to it. 
But only after my people leave this town

1894
02:37:03,770 --> 02:37:06,350
Narayana, oxygen!!

1895
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:10,650
So near yet so far! Damn this loot! 
I'm dying with an unfulfilled dream

1896
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:12,770
You're thinking of the loot in your last moments?

1897
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:14,600
Achyuthanna is dying because of you

1898
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:16,980
Lakshmi and the drama troupe are dying in the fort

1899
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:19,810
And consumed by greed for the loot, you're dying in here

1900
02:37:19,810 --> 02:37:20,730
You know why?

1901
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:22,230
Tell me!

1902
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:23,850
Due to my greed

1903
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:25,440
Exactly!

1904
02:37:25,850 --> 02:37:28,770
What did Lakshmi tell you about the Ravana and the Narayana 
residing in you?

1905
02:37:29,310 --> 02:37:31,770
Repent at least before you die!

1906
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:33,850
I am

1907
02:37:33,850 --> 02:37:35,520
Awaken the Narayana in you!

1908
02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:36,940
I am

1909
02:37:38,850 --> 02:37:40,270
Narayana oxygen!!

1910
02:37:40,270 --> 02:37:41,230
To hell with oxygen!

1911
02:37:41,230 --> 02:37:42,100
I'll need it only if I stay alive, right?

1912
02:37:42,310 --> 02:37:43,690
Will you just shut up!

1913
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:09,650
I have you the signal a long time ago and you arrive now!

1914
02:38:09,650 --> 02:38:11,850
Sir, please come out. 
- We came a long time ago

1915
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:15,650
We arrived when they were beating you up

1916
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:18,850
Then what were you waiting for? For him to die?

1917
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:22,440
We were only obligated to save his life

1918
02:38:23,350 --> 02:38:26,400
We're even now

1919
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:30,600
Where are you off to?

1920
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:32,190
To Tukaram's fort

1921
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:34,600
Jairam has already reclaimed his fort

1922
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:43,900
Then Jairam sir will be upset if 
I go empty handed to congratulate him

1923
02:38:49,150 --> 02:38:51,440
If you go to the fort in your current state, 
you'll be dead meat!

1924
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:55,020
I have escaped from the jaws of death and emerged alive

1925
02:38:55,770 --> 02:38:57,850
I guess my life's purpose isn't fulfilled yet

1926
02:39:00,810 --> 02:39:01,600
I will not die today

1927
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:08,310
There will be no exceptions...

1928
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:11,730
...when he doesn't wait for an invite to join the war

1929
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:16,650
Only a war cry will be heard

1930
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:20,730
The earth quivers with his entry 
- We don't like being obligated to anyone

1931
02:39:20,940 --> 02:39:24,190
He will show no mercy 
- Jairam's is pending...

1932
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:28,230
When evil soars high in this world

1933
02:39:28,350 --> 02:39:31,690
May the fire in you ignite

1934
02:39:31,850 --> 02:39:38,810
The evils will be vanquished...

1935
02:39:38,810 --> 02:39:44,190
...because he was born to make history

1936
02:39:55,940 --> 02:39:56,850
Let's get started?

1937
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:45,560
A rebirth just for the betterment of this world

1938
02:40:46,100 --> 02:40:49,060
Let only truth triumph

1939
02:40:49,770 --> 02:40:50,650
There is a...

1940
02:40:50,650 --> 02:40:53,350
...battle within...

1941
02:40:53,350 --> 02:41:00,190
The evils will be vanquished...

1942
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:05,480
...because he was born to make history

1943
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:20,480
Narayana...Srimannarayana...

1944
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:45,350
Narayana, please set me free

1945
02:41:46,190 --> 02:41:46,560
Of course!

1946
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:51,770
Narayana?

1947
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:36,310
I had promised my father to destroy your families

1948
02:42:36,980 --> 02:42:41,560
And Abhiras never go back on their word

1949
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:43,730
The ones who looted that train have been long dead

1950
02:42:44,150 --> 02:42:46,940
And none of these people are even remotely 
connected to that loot, Jaiaram

1951
02:42:47,350 --> 02:42:49,350
Do you want that loot or you do you want to keep your word?

1952
02:42:50,190 --> 02:42:51,980
The choice is yours

1953
02:42:53,230 --> 02:42:54,770
And what if I don't want to?

1954
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:59,230
There's no need for all this, Lakshmi. 
As long as we have Sri Hari, he can't lay a finger on us!

1955
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:07,600
Sri Hari! Where is your so called Sri Hari??

1956
02:43:35,020 --> 02:43:37,440
Only I know where the loot is hidden.

1957
02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:41,900
If you even lay a finger on them, you'll have to forget that 
loot forever

1958
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:58,900
Hello brother!

1959
02:43:59,190 --> 02:44:00,810
There's a parcel for you!

1960
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:21,020
Amaravati Police Department has its eye and gun 
trained on you.

1961
02:44:21,020 --> 02:44:23,440
If you stick to your positions, you'll be safe

1962
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:26,980
Even if you budge a little, here's an example 
of what's in store for you

1963
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:40,940
One moment please!

1964
02:44:41,310 --> 02:44:42,980
Please keep your positions

1965
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:50,940
I will be demonstrating what is in store 
if any of you budge from your positions

1966
02:44:57,770 --> 02:44:58,690
Boys!

1967
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:01,560
Please watch your aim while shooting, ok?

1968
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:04,100
Hope you enjoyed our little demonstration!

1969
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:06,560
Now please lower your guns

1970
02:45:08,600 --> 02:45:09,770
I told you

1971
02:45:27,690 --> 02:45:29,190
I have a business proposal

1972
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:33,520
For your dreams that were burried 15years ago

1973
02:45:33,730 --> 02:45:36,310
I put my life at stake and have resurrected

1974
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:36,650
umm...

1975
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:38,940
...just keeping you posted...

1976
02:45:39,400 --> 02:45:40,900
Heard that Miss Lakshmi? I put my life at stake...

1977
02:45:41,350 --> 02:45:42,520
I brought this for all of you...

1978
02:45:43,770 --> 02:45:44,190
So yes...

1979
02:45:45,810 --> 02:45:49,940
If any of you wants to become 
the king of the Abhiras, raise your hand!

1980
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:51,850
And in place of the loot, give me the drama troupe

1981
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:53,270
Give and take

1982
02:45:53,730 --> 02:45:54,730
What do you have to say, huh?

1983
02:45:54,730 --> 02:46:00,190
You may have brought the loot, Narayana. 
But, you are putting your life at stake now

1984
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:01,230
Sir, please keep quiet, will you?

1985
02:46:01,350 --> 02:46:04,060
I know that you will not go back on your word 
and give me these drama folk

1986
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:07,690
But, they have given no such word, isn't it?

1987
02:46:07,690 --> 02:46:09,770
So, yes, the market is open.

1988
02:46:10,150 --> 02:46:12,940
And if there are any interesting candidates, 
please raise your hand!

1989
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:17,020
There!

1990
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:18,770
The first candidate is ready!

1991
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:21,730
Second candidate!

1992
02:46:31,350 --> 02:46:31,650
Good!

1993
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:34,730
You seem like an interesting candidate,

1994
02:46:34,730 --> 02:46:35,350
please come forward

1995
02:46:35,690 --> 02:46:36,350
What's your name?

1996
02:46:49,850 --> 02:46:54,230
Jairam sir, please listen to me

1997
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:04,150
I had told you this a long time ago

1998
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:07,940
When intelligence crosses its limit, 
it turns into foolishness

1999
02:47:18,480 --> 02:47:21,020
You lost because of your intelligence, Narayana

2000
02:47:21,350 --> 02:47:24,310
Now let's test the enormity of your strength

2001
02:47:27,400 --> 02:47:28,440
Oh god, sir!

2002
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:42,480
Oh my!

2003
02:47:46,310 --> 02:47:49,270
I am the man who killed my own father for the throne!

2004
02:47:56,230 --> 02:48:00,350
Now tell me, how many amongst you desire to become the king!

2005
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:08,350
Not one among them dares to even think of it, Narayana

2006
02:48:09,270 --> 02:48:10,190
Ok then

2007
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:20,020
Since none of you are displaying the courage to do so, 
I myself will sit on that throne

2008
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:24,850
I will use their dead bodies as a stairway to the throne

2009
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:28,600
Now call upon your Sri Hari!

2010
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:31,310
Call him!

2011
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:35,400
Lord of the seven hills!

2012
02:48:36,190 --> 02:48:37,560
King of the Abhiras

2013
02:48:37,940 --> 02:48:41,480
I, Jairam, the legitmate heir of Rama Rama

2014
02:48:41,810 --> 02:48:44,100
Will be fulfilling the vow given to my father...

2015
02:48:44,100 --> 02:48:44,940
Sir, there is someone...

2016
02:48:49,400 --> 02:48:53,770
Sir, you mentioned that nobody dared 
to become the king,isn't it...

2017
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:54,810
There is someone

2018
02:48:57,310 --> 02:49:00,850
Gentlemen, if anybody writes the history of the Abhiras, 
it will be divided into two parts

2019
02:49:00,850 --> 02:49:02,480
One: before he became the king of the Abhiras

2020
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:04,270
Two: after he became the king of the Abhiras

2021
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:15,150
Who is he?

2022
02:49:16,940 --> 02:49:18,350
He is Sriman Narayana!

2023
02:49:19,100 --> 02:49:19,690
Narayana!

2024
02:49:21,850 --> 02:49:22,600
Jairam sir, patience please!

2025
02:49:23,810 --> 02:49:26,100
As per the rule laid by you, 
I've ascended the throne only after finding the loot

2026
02:49:27,230 --> 02:49:30,940
Actually, after I become the king of the Abhiras, 
there will not be much to write about the Abhiras

2027
02:49:31,440 --> 02:49:32,150
There will only be a full stop

2028
02:49:32,150 --> 02:49:32,560
Tell me why?

2029
02:49:34,100 --> 02:49:35,650
Because the history of Abhiras ends today

2030
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:38,400
Henceforth, it is not necessary for you 
to follow the Abhira tradition

2031
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:41,560
This is your king Sriman Narayana's first and last order

2032
02:49:48,810 --> 02:49:51,600
Look, your fort is on fire and is getting burnt!

2033
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:54,350
Within minutes, this place will be on fire, too

2034
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:56,940
You all have families, 
so please have some concern about them

2035
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:58,940
Do not disobey your king's orders, leave right now!

2036
02:49:59,270 --> 02:50:03,810
If any of you dares to even budge, you will be dead!

2037
02:50:05,230 --> 02:50:07,810
Remember that some amongst you have already 
expressed a desire to become the king

2038
02:50:09,100 --> 02:50:10,520
Jairam sir is anyway planning to...

2039
02:50:12,770 --> 02:50:13,850
kill you!

2040
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:20,770
Good!

2041
02:50:49,350 --> 02:50:52,940
Come!

2042
02:50:52,940 --> 02:50:54,150
Fast!

2043
02:50:57,650 --> 02:50:59,350
Lakshmi!

2044
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:02,190
Hey!

2045
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:03,690
Lakshmi!

2046
02:51:03,690 --> 02:51:04,150
Come!

2047
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:07,600
Come!

2048
02:51:13,730 --> 02:51:16,350
You won't go back alive from here today

2049
02:51:18,810 --> 02:51:22,310
Can you fight this seven footer? Let's see!

2050
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:05,270
Someone was mentioning about a seven footer... 
I can't see him

2051
02:52:06,770 --> 02:52:08,270
Ah! There you are!

2052
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:17,520
Hurry up! Quick

2053
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:23,850
Move along!

2054
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:29,770
He saved all of us and....

2055
02:58:34,650 --> 02:58:36,440
Not just us, Achyuthanna

2056
02:58:36,730 --> 02:58:38,690
He saved the whole of Amaravati

2057
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:30,770
Why did you save him?

2058
02:59:31,810 --> 02:59:35,560
That's because the Narayana within me has woken up, Lakshmi

2059
02:59:36,060 --> 02:59:38,060
I didn't have the heart to leave him behind

2060
02:59:54,310 --> 02:59:57,020
(Sri Hari Drama Company Presents - Samudra Manthana)

2061
02:59:58,060 --> 03:00:00,270
Lakshmi!

2062
03:00:02,230 --> 03:00:03,190
Narayana!

2063
03:00:04,060 --> 03:00:08,600
Sri Hari, by your grace, the nectar has been obtained by the  
 Gods

2064
03:00:08,850 --> 03:00:13,310
Now, if Lakshmi and Narayana wed, it will do good to the  
 whole world

2065
03:00:19,190 --> 03:00:20,810
What do you think, Sudhakar?

2066
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:22,060
About what?

2067
03:00:22,480 --> 03:00:24,690
About Lakshmi and Narayana's wedding

2068
03:00:25,230 --> 03:00:27,150
No that won't work, Lakshmi!

2069
03:00:28,730 --> 03:00:31,310
Uh...nothing of that sort, there is no problem

2070
03:00:33,150 --> 03:00:33,850
What did she say?

2071
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:36,560
She said there's absolutely no problem

2072
03:00:36,560 --> 03:00:36,810
Ah!

2073
03:00:41,770 --> 03:00:42,600
She's just shy...

2074
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:44,810
Miss Lakshmi....

2075
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:47,440
What plans for the future?

2076
03:03:16,060 --> 03:03:20,810
YES! I got it...

2077
03:03:38,190 --> 03:03:39,230
Where is Narayana?

2078
03:03:40,150 --> 03:03:40,770
Who are you?

2079
03:03:44,980 --> 03:03:45,850
His father!
