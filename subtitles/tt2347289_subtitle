1
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,711
Hurry up.

2
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,804
I am feeling cold.

3
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:07,376
He's no Sooraj Barjatiya...

4
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,283
...that we can't start
the rituals without him.

5
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,980
To hell with your Barjatiya.

6
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:13,547
Does anyone ever start the
rituals without the video guy?

7
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:14,921
It's just a video.

8
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:16,860
We can start from the middle.

9
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,923
Wait for a while, Veeru.

10
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:22,329
Goldie Isn't getting married again.

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,459
You wait for him, I'm leaving.

12
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,937
He arrived late on
Mr. Bhusan's son's marriage.

13
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,809
There's no one like
him in entire Anandpur.

14
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,878
Chojjar uncle changed the
dates on the wedding card.

15
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,481
Because Bittoo wasn't available.

16
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:40,947
Brother, he's a rascal.

17
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:42,610
He barges in
anywhere with his camera.

18
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,383
That's why he
makes such nice videos.

19
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,787
He gave me 25% discount.

20
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,623
Through Cutie Beauty Parlour.

21
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,526
Bittoo!

22
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:59,358
Bittoo, which one should I wear?

23
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,492
This one... or this one.

24
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:05,796
The lighting's great.

25
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:07,666
Wear the pink one.

26
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,904
You'll look sexy in the camera.

27
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,408
Really?

28
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:13,273
Don't you forget.

29
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,839
Make me look like a heroine.

30
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,744
Don't worry.

31
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,405
I will.

32
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:33,455
Now, Chutki will
approach from the other side...

33
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,998
...and apply the paste on
the groom's other cheek.

34
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,590
Okay?
- And, aunt.

35
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,735
You just smear the
turmeric on his nose.

36
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:39,770
Round one.

37
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:40,895
It will look nice.

38
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,068
And, aunt. You're looking beautiful.

39
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:47,875
I suggest that you hold the bowl.

40
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,808
Have fun.

41
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:50,981
Okay.

42
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:55,717
Hey, video guy.

43
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:58,311
Come here.

44
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,021
Don't you hear?

45
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,288
Boss, that uncle...

46
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,797
Look. I am sparing
you because you're new.

47
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,993
Remember your first lesson.

48
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,262
I don't like to be
disturbed when I am working.

49
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,501
So if you talk respectfully...

50
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,271
...then Bittoo
will take a sexy shot.

51
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,810
And if you raise a commotion...

52
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:27,984
...then, thank you, uncle.
Mention not.

53
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:32,513
Looking great.

54
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:33,851
Ready.

55
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:35,855
Act...

56
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:38,918
I haven't said action.

57
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,954
So?

58
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:42,397
Action.

59
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,475
"Oh, this shining bowl..."

60
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:58,413
"Oh, this shining bowl..."

61
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:03,877
"Oh, the cloth that
belongs to birds."

62
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:07,981
"Oh, the charisma of the girls."

63
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,487
"Oh, the cloth that
belongs to girls."

64
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:17,933
"Oh, the charm of the boys."

65
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:30,746
"Oh, this shining bowl..."

66
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:33,782
"Oh, the cloth that
belongs to birds."

67
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,513
"Oh, the cloth that
belongs to girls."

68
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:40,580
"Oh, the charm of the boys."

69
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:01,772
Veeru. Apply the paste.

70
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,756
Look.

71
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,526
Wait.

72
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,445
Bittoo, take good shots.

73
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,512
Boss. Since you came up here...

74
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:49,951
...everything's become so boring.

75
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:55,381
Whether its marriage,
reception or happy birthday...

76
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:59,453
...who is the star?
- Who?

77
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:01,394
Bittoo, take mine.

78
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,833
Fine, take it from up there.

79
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:09,898
There's a 'Katto' in every marriage.

80
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:13,236
'How much longer will
you make me wait, Bittoo? '

81
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,674
Take mine.

82
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:15,803
Bittoo.

83
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,247
Take mine solo. Please.

84
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,614
Bittoo, take ours
while we're dancing.

85
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:22,979
Take mine too.

86
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,322
Bittoo, take a
good photo of my wife.

87
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,817
You're taking everyone's

88
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:30,785
Won't you take mine?

89
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:33,897
You've been taking
the girls. Not me.

90
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:36,489
Photo. What else.

91
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,734
And whose responsibility is
it to turn them into Katrina?

92
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:41,698
Mine.

93
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,701
Ask why?

94
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,910
Why?
- Because Mr. Verma says...

95
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,809
...that she'll be our next customer.

96
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:56,913
Boss, is Mr. Verma someone special?

97
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,284
Very special, and very intelligent.

98
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:06,930
He does the mixing of
all that we're shooting.

99
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:10,467
When my art meets
his intelligence...

100
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:13,068
...that's how Bittoo Video
Shooter's best in the business.

101
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,628
Understand.

102
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,689
"Expensive material
which is gray in color."

103
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:41,990
"Come closer. Come closer."

104
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:45,433
"Don't shy away from me."

105
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:50,633
"Expensive material
which is gray in color."

106
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,967
"Come closer. Come closer."

107
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:57,775
"Don't shy away from me."

108
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:31,678
"I was attending my
friend's marriage."

109
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:34,877
"A bunch of girls
were dancing with me."

110
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,581
"I was attending my
friend's marriage."

111
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,624
"A bunch of girls
were dancing with me."

112
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:46,823
"One of them brushed
her cheek against mine."

113
00:11:46,897 --> 00:11:48,387
"Her eyes..."

114
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:50,092
"Her eyes..."

115
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,667
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

116
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:56,968
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

117
00:11:57,107 --> 00:12:00,508
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

118
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:07,710
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

119
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:23,329
"High heels under her feet."

120
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,799
"Bracelets clinking on her wrist."

121
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,631
"I keep staring at her."

122
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:28,500
"From different angles."

123
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:29,903
"High heels under her feet."

124
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,804
"Bracelets clinking on her wrist."

125
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,467
"I keep staring at her."

126
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:34,804
"From different angles."

127
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:39,906
"She looked better than Lady Gaga."

128
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,645
"Her eyes..."

129
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,379
"Her eyes..."

130
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:46,719
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

131
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,089
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

132
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:53,624
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

133
00:12:53,664 --> 00:13:00,467
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

134
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:17,651
"Dear, don't look at me and smile."

135
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,951
"Dear, don't look at me and smile."

136
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:24,516
"My parents are getting suspicious."

137
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:27,529
"My parents are getting suspicious."

138
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:32,695
"Expensive material
which is gray in color."

139
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,965
"Come closer. Come closer."

140
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:38,671
"Don't shy away from me."

141
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:41,711
"Your eyes are like mirrors."

142
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,345
"Your eyes are like mirrors."

143
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:46,974
"Forsake your anger."

144
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,076
"Your eyes are like mirrors."

145
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:53,750
"My beauty's lethal."

146
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:56,390
"My beauty's lethal."

147
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,327
"I will steal your heart."

148
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:02,695
"My beauty's lethal."

149
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,927
"I am your fan."

150
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:06,765
"Don't wander near my alley."

151
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,532
"Read my love-letter."

152
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:09,936
"What's written in it?"

153
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:15,001
"I've chosen you for me."

154
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,769
"Her eyes..."

155
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:18,508
"Her eyes..."

156
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,982
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

157
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:25,453
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

158
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,822
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

159
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:32,328
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

160
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:35,695
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

161
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:39,327
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

162
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:42,634
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

163
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:45,903
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

164
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:52,448
"Her eyes knocked me of my senses."

165
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,409
Tell me one thing.

166
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,051
What do you think I am shooting?

167
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:35,753
Note. Marriage procession,
the band, horse. Katto.

168
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:37,350
Enough.

169
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,052
And what do they all make
up together? - Marriage.

170
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:43,057
No, it makes up happiness.

171
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,029
And that's exactly
what we've to show.

172
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:47,926
So that 10 years later...

173
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:51,406
...when the hit the play button,
their hearts are refreshed...

174
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,408
...just like the video.

175
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:55,736
Okay.

176
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,877
There's no point in
holding the camera.

177
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,940
You've to capture the motion.

178
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,816
And by God, Laddi.

179
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:07,287
I can do anything to capture motion.

180
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:14,754
Boss. Sometimes I think that...

181
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:24,469
...if I find an innocent girl,
then life will be set.

182
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,644
You've only seen outer happiness.

183
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:31,905
Start seeing the reality.

184
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,784
How do you look at it?

185
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:41,355
I can give you the
guy's clearance...

186
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:44,360
...and the bride's
experience by looking at them.

187
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:47,019
The poor guy's going to
land in a terrible mess.

188
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,397
Why?

189
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:53,994
Where can one find a
shy girl like her?

190
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:57,771
Look carefully, she
isn't shying, she's scared.

191
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:00,374
Her old boyfriend's
attending the marriage.

192
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,919
Sister-in-law. Show me the henna.

193
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,323
Don't be a glutton.

194
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:43,577
Hurry up.

195
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:46,617
What did you put in this?

196
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,987
It tastes awful.

197
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,459
Let me check.

198
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:52,385
I can't eat it.

199
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,691
It's fine.
- No.

200
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,994
Yes, aunt, its fine.

201
00:17:58,568 --> 00:17:59,762
Come on, let's go have some juice.

202
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,497
Let's go.
- Let's go.

203
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:22,915
Take mine.

204
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:27,420
Come on my beauty queen.

205
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:40,342
Boss. Forget it.

206
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:43,703
When you've Katto, Nikki, Sheila,

207
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:45,608
Then why she?

208
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:47,707
She has a loose screw.

209
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:51,351
I am not in my senses either.

210
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:53,686
But what to do?

211
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,486
I've a liking for her.

212
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,690
The earrings are really nice.

213
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,666
Why are you glum, son.

214
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:08,465
He speaks nonsense.

215
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:12,738
She has done an MBA from Chandigarh.

216
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:15,811
But she's still acts childishly.

217
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,795
At least let us eat.
- So go ahead.

218
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:34,888
I am not taking
food from your plate.

219
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,458
It casts a bad omen on the food.

220
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,329
At Jangi Ram's marriage...

221
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:47,706
...I choked on the flat-bread
when the video guy arrived.

222
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:52,711
You had already eaten
four flat-breads, aunt.

223
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:57,481
You're bound to
choke on the fifth one.

224
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:27,481
What a personality.

225
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,315
What personality?

226
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:30,847
He's Babbu's son.

227
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,821
It's all because of his wealth.

228
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,424
But he's a true artist,
and he's a ham.

229
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,311
Thank you, Bittoo.

230
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:08,423
Do you know who I am?

231
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:09,952
Play my CD.

232
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:11,994
But your CD isn't playing.

233
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,691
Really, or you
don't want to play it.

234
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,062
It really isn't playing.

235
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,593
It isn't.

236
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:20,894
Then let me show you.

237
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:22,464
Come out.

238
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,704
Come here.

239
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:27,299
I will show you how to play.

240
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:28,537
The CD isn't playing.

241
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:29,738
The CD isn't playing.

242
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,514
You're beating up the
kid for a small thing.

243
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,645
Come on, say sorry.

244
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,812
What will I do with his sorry?

245
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,558
Rascal, he can't play my CD.

246
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,554
He's just a kid. He's crying.

247
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,565
Calm down, son.

248
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,458
Calm down.
- Scoundrel.

249
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,533
Doesn't play my CD.

250
00:21:56,706 --> 00:22:00,107
Rascal. How dare you touch him?

251
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,902
How dare you touch him?

252
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:03,411
Get lost.

253
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,311
How dare you touch him?

254
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:07,412
Don't cross your limit.
Let go of my collar.

255
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:10,714
I will teach you a lesson today.

256
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,414
Scoundrel.

257
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:18,394
Rupan. Sodhi.

258
00:22:22,532 --> 00:22:23,965
Leave me.

259
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:25,832
Leave me.

260
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,415
My first choice.

261
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,583
Macho Deo.

262
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:57,990
How many more ads have
the channel received?

263
00:22:58,435 --> 00:23:00,460
The channel's...

264
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,435
The channel's in a bad condition.

265
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,372
I've played the Macho Deo and
Kinky Tea ad so many times...

266
00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:06,636
...that I am confused now.

267
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,439
Are you spraying deo
while having tea...

268
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,342
...or are you drinking
tea and spraying the deo?

269
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:13,380
My first choice.

270
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,610
That's fine.

271
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:17,048
Aditya Chawla will handle it.

272
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,552
You handle yourself.

273
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:30,525
You fool.

274
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:36,771
I didn't take 'shilajeet'
(Viagra) before he was born...

275
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,475
...that's why he
always disappointed me.

276
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,343
What mess did you get into at night?

277
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:48,984
My videos weren't watched so
many times on the internet...

278
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,716
...as much the tussle
between you and that DJ.

279
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:56,881
You should have
thought about my honour.

280
00:23:58,328 --> 00:24:01,297
Father, it's that video guy's fault.

281
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:02,592
Be quiet.

282
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,897
Aditya.
- Sir.

283
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,898
What about the Gurdwara's coverage?

284
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:16,841
The channel is in a bad condition.

285
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:20,278
It's your job to raise the TRP's.

286
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:22,849
Concentrate on your singing, sir.

287
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,682
I will handle business.

288
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:27,354
I've made a statiscal report...

289
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:29,414
...based on last
years balance-sheet...

290
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:32,757
...and overturning the
economic imbalance...

291
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,921
...of our company
will be as easy as pie.

292
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:40,458
Pie.

293
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:43,333
Did you hear?

294
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,803
Did you hear?

295
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,002
Yes.

296
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,615
Rascal.

297
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,881
Bittoo. Why don't you learn?

298
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:03,817
Can't you just stand
behind the camera quietly?

299
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:05,960
You get involved in the scene.

300
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,888
I don't do it intentionally.

301
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:09,657
The scene calls for it.

302
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:13,668
As if it's your girlfriend.

303
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:16,995
Mr. Verma, stop
lecturing and tell me...

304
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,271
...how will we pay
for the DJ's mixer.

305
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:21,276
Money? Why will we pay?

306
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:22,641
We're not doing social service.

307
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:24,006
I don't have money.

308
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:27,743
He's a small kid. He's
new to the business.

309
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:30,582
Go ahead. Squander money.

310
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:31,813
Shut up.

311
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:33,446
We're talking about business.

312
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:35,423
You think you're Bill Gates.

313
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,823
You pull off big
jobs with your camera.

314
00:25:37,894 --> 00:25:41,295
No, no. Why don't I become
a truck driver, like you?

315
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:44,556
Not a truck driver,
but a transporter.

316
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:46,429
Take my advice.

317
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:48,493
Take up a decent job.

318
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:50,937
I'll buy a new truck for you.

319
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,876
Look. Let me explain.

320
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,575
These marriages and
parties are no use.

321
00:25:57,914 --> 00:26:01,008
The real money's in the real jobs.

322
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:03,552
We'll do that as well.

323
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,985
But step-by-step.

324
00:26:05,622 --> 00:26:07,920
First we'll shoot Mr. Babbu's video.

325
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,856
Then we'll make films.

326
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,793
Once Mr. Babbu sees my work...

327
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,989
...then everything will fall
in place. - Tell me one thing.

328
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:18,693
You leave a DVD of your
work in his office every week.

329
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,335
Yes.
- You do, don't you?

330
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:21,802
Yes.
- Has anything happened yet?

331
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:23,431
Nothing.

332
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:27,334
Son. The world's
progressing very fast.

333
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:30,703
And we've to enter the fast track
growing industry of the world...

334
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,772
...and be just as fast.

335
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:39,754
You'll never
forsake your dirty ideas.

336
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,052
Forget it.

337
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,688
I will arrange for the money myself.

338
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:44,624
So what if we didn't
make money in this one...

339
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:46,525
...we will in the next one.
- Yes.

340
00:26:46,596 --> 00:26:47,790
And you can squander that too.

341
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:52,427
You should have
business sense along with art.

342
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,330
Look, let me explain.

343
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:58,040
Stop making marriage films.

344
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,800
Shoot what happens after that.

345
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:03,608
We'll make a fortune.

346
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,477
And lot of fun.

347
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:09,446
What a fortune you're
making with a lowly man.

348
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,646
You keep wandering around,
isn't that enough?

349
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:15,350
You can sit idle all
your life along with him.

350
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,825
Why don't you
explain to your father?

351
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:20,994
Strange.

352
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,651
Gurdwara. Early morning.

353
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,060
Hello.

354
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:00,593
Where to?

355
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,803
Go to study, right?

356
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:06,007
Didn't you recognise me?

357
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:07,903
You're speeding ahead...

358
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,310
...as if there's a sale on 'Gol
Gappas' (Snacks) around the corner.

359
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:16,612
Girls start thinking
from where the boys stop.

360
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:20,446
Emotional stunts.

361
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:21,920
Psychological games.

362
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:24,883
And they think they
can win a girl over.

363
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:26,961
Just a minute.

364
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:28,558
Wait.

365
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:33,793
Now do it.

366
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:36,435
You should keep rocking the vehicle.

367
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,030
That way you can fill
the tank completely.

368
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,772
You don't understand
what I say, do you?

369
00:28:41,477 --> 00:28:44,002
We cannot be friends, understand.

370
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,507
But I thought that...
we're friends now.

371
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:50,618
I even brought a gift for you.

372
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:52,980
You must think that "Now
she's talking to me...

373
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:55,981
...so let's give her a
gift and be a hero".

374
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,585
"Then take her number and call her."

375
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:02,521
It's a small gift.

376
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:03,860
I'll like it if you take it.

377
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,801
You can throw it if
you don't like it.

378
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,268
Without telling me.

379
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:10,338
What did you get?

380
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:12,502
Just a minute.

381
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:16,903
Here.

382
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:30,652
What is this?

383
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,251
It's a stepnie-cover.

384
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,885
It's for your scooter.

385
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,440
Stop following me around.

386
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:47,935
You're a nice boy.

387
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:50,509
You're decent looking as well.

388
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,038
Why are you worried?

389
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:58,683
You're good looking as well.

390
00:30:03,993 --> 00:30:05,688
But there are other things
to be taken in considerations.

391
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:08,487
Like job, family, future.

392
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:09,822
Brains.

393
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:11,590
You know about my job.

394
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,498
I am an artist, I spread happiness.

395
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:15,467
Every family makes
me their member...

396
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:16,835
...after seeing my videos.

397
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,933
When you see them,
always observe two things.

398
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:21,873
The smile on everyone's faces.

399
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:24,606
And the inner happiness.

400
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:26,742
Now a person who does
such a bright job...

401
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,784
...is bound to have a
bright future. Right?

402
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,485
That's why
marriages are prospering...

403
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:31,747
...and so is the population.

404
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:34,321
Now as far as my wits are concerned.

405
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:36,616
These days I am learning
to operate the computer...

406
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,057
...to keep up with the times.

407
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:41,521
Now I save the final
video myself on local disk D.

408
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:44,391
On what?
- Local disk D.

409
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:50,428
Illiterate.
- What?

410
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:53,908
Time to go, genius.

411
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,651
I am so cute.
- That's true.

412
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:07,021
But not my type.

413
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:37,446
He's come here as well.

414
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,015
I'll teach him a lesson.

415
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:48,662
Veeru...

416
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:54,494
Are you crazy?

417
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:56,400
Will you come to my house now?

418
00:31:57,607 --> 00:31:59,541
Just because I talked
to you for a week...

419
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:00,903
...you came to my house.

420
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,278
Tomorrow you'll give
blank calls, lewd messages.

421
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:06,445
I thought you're a decent boy.

422
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:10,409
But you're dangerous.
- I am dangerous?

423
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,378
Strange. Now you've
made me dangerous.

424
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,518
I came here for business.

425
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:19,326
With this cheap
perfume and well dressed...

426
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:21,362
...you came here on business?

427
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:24,325
Did you get a shave
for my mother? Tell me.

428
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:26,332
Tell me.

429
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:27,967
What do I say?

430
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:30,902
I did it for you.
- Why?

431
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:32,569
I wanted to meet you.

432
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:35,542
I know that you want to
meet me but you don't say.

433
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:36,805
Why would I?

434
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,404
Did we swear on meeting each other?

435
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:40,707
Did I say "I love you"?

436
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:41,977
That's the problem?

437
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:43,382
You don't say anything...

438
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:45,352
...just say that we're good friends.

439
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:47,785
Dissolve this friendship.

440
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:50,892
If we go beyond friendship,
that's when we'll have a future.

441
00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:54,588
You're thinking of
a future with me?

442
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:56,898
Do you have a future yourself?

443
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,064
Why? What lacks in me?

444
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,564
I have a home, an office,
camera, light.

445
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,504
I see.

446
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:07,906
No marriage starts without Bittoo.

447
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,774
You think you're star.

448
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:14,312
Let me explain you one thing.

449
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:17,919
There's nothing common between us...

450
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:22,653
...to have a future together.
Get that.

451
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:26,953
I thought you're not
like the other boys.

452
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,658
But you're worse, and cheap too.

453
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,925
Now will you leave?

454
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:56,355
Where did he go?
- Who?

455
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:57,786
That video guy.

456
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,918
He gave the DVD but
didn't collect his money.

457
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,919
What's in this DVD?

458
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:04,295
Its Goldie's marriage's DVD.

459
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,364
Your brother had brought him.

460
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,629
He has heard a lot of
praises about his work.

461
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,269
Let's see what's so great about it.

462
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,017
'When you take look,
always observe two things.'

463
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,495
'The smile on everyone's faces.'

464
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:12,995
'And the inner happiness.'

465
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:52,473
Local brand.

466
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:57,642
It's local, but strong.
- Its harsh.

467
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:01,609
It's Sweet.
- Sweet?

468
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:04,580
I am the harsh one.

469
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,449
I am talking about the cigarette.

470
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,355
What's wrong?

471
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:11,918
Something's wrong.

472
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,761
Who does she think I am?

473
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:21,367
I am an artist.

474
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:23,633
I am respected as well.

475
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:25,637
She doesn't see that.

476
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:29,508
Yes, of course
you're Michael Jackson.

477
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:32,638
He's really made my life hell.

478
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:36,643
The only thing this world
wants is money, Mr. Verma.

479
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,422
Bittoo, money commands respect.

480
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,758
Take that website guy for instance.

481
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,657
Kattubaby. Com.

482
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:48,624
His father was a
massager in the gym.

483
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:53,025
Now his son has started
a website worth millions.

484
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:54,326
You know that.

485
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:57,939
The one that show your
sleazy films, right?

486
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,305
What's sleazy about it?

487
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,271
It's all natural.

488
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:07,538
That is a person most naAve motion.

489
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,275
Just press the button on
the camera and leave it on.

490
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:12,581
The financer is ready.

491
00:37:12,755 --> 00:37:16,486
If you capture just
two-three such videos in a month.

492
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:21,562
You'll make a net
profit of at least 200,000.

493
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:29,360
Mr. Verma. I've told you so
many times to forget about it.

494
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:32,533
But you always bring up this topic.

495
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:34,935
You think you're very decent.

496
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,969
You follow girls around
with the camera in marriages.

497
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,777
Isn't that wrong?

498
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:44,409
Mr. Verma.

499
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:51,622
Seeing what you want to and
forgetting it, is different.

500
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:55,591
And showing the entire world
for your illegitimate profits.

501
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:57,058
That's wrong.

502
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,701
And once a person
does something wrong...

503
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,795
...his conscience
pricks him all the time.

504
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,535
What is it?

505
00:38:12,514 --> 00:38:13,708
Hello.

506
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:23,583
Hello.

507
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:25,754
Yes, go ahead.

508
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:28,354
Tomorrow?

509
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:33,962
Normally I am busy,
but I will do it.

510
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:35,594
Done.

511
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:40,007
There's a booking for the
veneration in the morning.

512
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,673
Cancel it.

513
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:10,997
You're just speeding
away on the scooter.

514
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:12,670
Do you know where we're going?

515
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:14,274
What difference does it make?

516
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,410
Of course, "What
difference does it make".

517
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:18,307
The girl's sitting on the scooter.

518
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,538
So just speed away.

519
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:21,907
And keep braking in between.

520
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:26,412
With the cool breeze blowing
she'll certainly fall asleep.

521
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:29,483
You can forsake these ideas
and let's go to Chandigarh.

522
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,392
Chandigarh? Why?

523
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:36,260
You ask too many questions.
- Fine, I won't.

524
00:39:36,598 --> 00:39:38,930
Can I say something?
- Go ahead.

525
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:43,668
Since the day we met
there's something I want to say.

526
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:45,839
But I don't know how to say it.

527
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:48,031
Try it.

528
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:51,006
I won't eat it.

529
00:39:51,947 --> 00:39:55,781
Check your doors and windows...

530
00:39:55,984 --> 00:39:58,612
...when you go in
the room to change.

531
00:39:59,054 --> 00:40:01,614
It was during Goldie's ceremonies.

532
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,715
When you went inside
the room to change...

533
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,792
...I saw you through the window.

534
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,422
And I even shot you.
- You...

535
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:11,466
I just saw a little.

536
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:12,932
From the back.

537
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:14,926
I don't...

538
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:42,589
"Who says the Lord doesn't exist?"

539
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:48,528
"Who says the Lord doesn't exist?"

540
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:54,434
"I am in love with you."

541
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:59,746
"I am in love with you."

542
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:02,846
"I revere you."

543
00:41:03,018 --> 00:41:05,953
"You're my prosperity."

544
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:08,854
"I dwell in your heart."

545
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:12,026
"And you exist in mine."

546
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:17,296
"Beloved, I am grateful."

547
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:24,538
"Beloved, I am grateful."

548
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:30,641
"Who says the Lord doesn't exist?"

549
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:36,478
"I am in love with you."

550
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:42,690
"I am in love with you."

551
00:41:54,069 --> 00:42:02,568
"Since I dreamt about you,
my eyes feel blessed."

552
00:42:02,878 --> 00:42:11,616
"Since I dreamt about you,
my eyes feel blessed."

553
00:42:11,954 --> 00:42:20,521
"Your love is my wealth."

554
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:23,796
"I will protect you."

555
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:27,001
"That's my devotion."

556
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:33,008
"My each breath is indebted to you."

557
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:38,012
"Beloved, I am grateful."

558
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:44,377
"Beloved, I am grateful."

559
00:42:45,721 --> 00:42:52,058
"Keep love alive in your heart."

560
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:58,027
"I have willed my soul to you,
keep that in mind."

561
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:04,266
"Keep love alive in your heart."

562
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:09,869
"I have willed my soul to you,
keep that in mind."

563
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,979
"Keep that in mind."

564
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,278
"I am floored by you."

565
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,046
"This is my devotion for you."

566
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,418
"I've surrendered my
dawn and dusk to you."

567
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,495
"Beloved...
- I am grateful."

568
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:36,466
"Beloved...
- I am grateful."

569
00:43:36,538 --> 00:43:41,532
"Beloved, I am grateful."

570
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:46,974
"Beloved, I am grateful."

571
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:53,511
"Beloved, I am grateful."

572
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:59,460
"Beloved, I am grateful."

573
00:43:59,995 --> 00:44:05,558
"Beloved, I am grateful."

574
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:11,704
"Beloved, I am grateful."

575
00:44:11,974 --> 00:44:13,498
Come on.

576
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:17,672
To Mr. Babbu's office.

577
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,811
Will you introduce me to Mr. Babbu?

578
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:27,355
Just take a look, and
then maybe you can help him.

579
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:30,619
Isn't he the same
cameraman from Goldie's marriage?

580
00:44:32,361 --> 00:44:34,329
You came so far for him?

581
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:37,894
I just thought you're from the
same industry so maybe you help me.

582
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:40,026
Same industry?

583
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:44,297
Mrinalini, it's a different
thing to make marriage videos...

584
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:47,672
...and working professionally in
the industry is quite different.

585
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:48,733
Don't you think?

586
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,677
Mr. Aditya, he's not
like the other boys.

587
00:44:51,747 --> 00:44:54,545
His marriage videos are so unique...

588
00:44:54,616 --> 00:44:55,810
...that you'll recognise his talent.

589
00:44:55,884 --> 00:44:58,444
There's no dearth of
such talent in Punjab.

590
00:44:58,687 --> 00:45:00,348
Then sent dozens of DVD's.

591
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:03,483
They're only good
for keeping teacups.

592
00:45:06,628 --> 00:45:08,721
Just take a look.

593
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,933
What if I see this DVD?

594
00:45:16,271 --> 00:45:17,738
What if it does him good?

595
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:20,002
He can be no one.

596
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,704
He's a lowly cameraman.

597
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:26,279
Look. Honestly, Mrinalini,
I don't have the time...

598
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,873
...to fill my mind with
cheap creative toxins...

599
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,408
...of a self-proclaimed artist.
I mean, come on.

600
00:45:32,954 --> 00:45:34,751
You're an intelligent girl.

601
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:36,814
Why are you wasting your
time with this buffoon?

602
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:37,859
No.

603
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:41,554
No.

604
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,727
Don't you dare touch
this lowly cameraman's DVD.

605
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:51,666
Bittoo. I am talking to him.
- No, you're just listening.

606
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,066
They learn the dialogues from
the English serials on cable...

607
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,601
...and use it on girls
to make an impression.

608
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,606
Look, how he's speaking.

609
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:02,580
It's only because you
came here with this madam.

610
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:05,677
Otherwise a guy like you can
never get this close to this office.

611
00:46:05,954 --> 00:46:09,321
She might be a madam
for you, she's my friend.

612
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:14,961
So you have such cheap friends.

613
00:46:15,363 --> 00:46:16,955
Bittoo, don't humiliate me.

614
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:18,923
I will humiliate him.

615
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:21,360
Give him a camera and
ask him to switch it on.

616
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:23,028
Do it.
- Bittoo, go out.

617
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,963
I am so sorry, Aditya.

618
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,467
Is this nobody
trying to challenge me?

619
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:29,942
I challenge people only
who are of my stature.

620
00:46:30,378 --> 00:46:32,005
Do you see who you are talking to?

621
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,508
I can see.

622
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,708
Do you see?

623
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,286
He works in a media company but
looks worse than a truck driver.

624
00:46:44,926 --> 00:46:46,587
I am so sorry, Aditya.

625
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:48,056
I am so sorry.

626
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,956
Bittoo.

627
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,497
Crap.

628
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,324
I was talking to him.

629
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:55,436
Why did you have to interfere?

630
00:46:55,504 --> 00:46:56,436
I don't know why.

631
00:46:56,638 --> 00:46:57,627
That's how I am.

632
00:46:57,706 --> 00:46:59,537
I was showing him your work.

633
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,974
I don't want to show
my work to such fools.

634
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,433
I don't want to.

635
00:47:03,478 --> 00:47:04,740
Do you know who he is?

636
00:47:04,813 --> 00:47:06,678
He's the head of this channel.

637
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:09,883
I care a damn of such Heads.

638
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:13,252
He's renowned in the industry,
he's respected.

639
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:16,283
He has respect, and I don't.

640
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:18,420
You'll have it
only when you make it.

641
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,352
Making a few families wait
doesn't get respect, Bittoo.

642
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:23,655
Then how does one get respect?

643
00:47:23,832 --> 00:47:24,890
How does one get respect?

644
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:27,764
By pleading before
such lousy people?

645
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,870
It's better to quit then to
ask such people for a job.

646
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:33,407
Then that's what you'll
be doing in a few years.

647
00:47:33,675 --> 00:47:35,540
Don't do a decent job.

648
00:47:37,412 --> 00:47:38,344
Decent job.

649
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:41,674
Who do you think I am?

650
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:43,478
He called me such names.

651
00:47:43,518 --> 00:47:45,577
Cheap cameraman, lousy worker...

652
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,019
...but you just listened to him.

653
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,947
As long as I can hold this camera...

654
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:52,789
...Bittoo isn't going
to listen to anyone.

655
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:54,725
You have to.

656
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:57,488
You have to face such
rebukes if you want to be someone.

657
00:47:57,566 --> 00:48:00,057
Yes, this is why you
brought me here, right?

658
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:02,398
There's no difference...

659
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:03,960
...between yours and that
rascals practical thinking.

660
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:07,470
Just humiliate others to
prove your importance.

661
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:09,442
Just humiliate others.

662
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,840
What?

663
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,241
What did you say?

664
00:48:17,252 --> 00:48:18,310
Look at me.

665
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,649
I brought you here to humiliate you.

666
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,619
Just who are you?

667
00:48:26,995 --> 00:48:29,725
Does anyone know outside your area?

668
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,829
If you make it big after
hearing someone's rebukes...

669
00:48:34,903 --> 00:48:36,837
...then what's wrong in it?

670
00:48:37,672 --> 00:48:39,799
Learn to take
advantage of the situation.

671
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:42,909
I don't want to take advantage.

672
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,538
I don't want to take advantage.

673
00:48:44,613 --> 00:48:47,480
And Bittoo cannot bow
before anyone, let me tell you.

674
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,418
You can bow before
anyone you want...

675
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:52,476
...you can let anyone
humiliate you.

676
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:55,721
I cannot do this.

677
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,818
And this lousy man
doesn't want your advice...

678
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:00,485
...nor your friendship.

679
00:49:03,865 --> 00:49:05,765
Thank God you said it yourself.

680
00:49:06,635 --> 00:49:08,694
Because you are a lousy person.

681
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:10,370
And you will always be.

682
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,307
You can never make it big.

683
00:49:16,278 --> 00:49:17,609
I can never make it big?

684
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,710
How does a person become successful?

685
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:21,346
By making money, right?

686
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,950
If useless people like him
can make money, then so can I.

687
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,878
I can make money.

688
00:49:27,555 --> 00:49:28,817
Then show me.

689
00:49:29,391 --> 00:49:31,951
Don't brag, show me.

690
00:49:32,894 --> 00:49:35,454
If you wander out, see the world...

691
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,624
...then you'll see who is useless.

692
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,037
'AII these rich
people that you see... '

693
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,806
'... have done something
illegal to make it rich.'

694
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,476
'Look, a job's a job.'

695
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:38,517
'You won't become rich...

696
00:50:38,593 --> 00:50:40,823
...even if you shoot
marriages all your life.'

697
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:44,691
'You don't have to force anyone.'

698
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:47,663
'Just publish whatever's going on.'

699
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:52,703
'That's exactly what the
entire world is doing.'

700
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:07,449
'Lf you want to
make a lot of money...

701
00:51:07,622 --> 00:51:10,853
...then you'll have
to take a short-cut.'

702
00:51:15,997 --> 00:51:17,555
Mr. Verma.

703
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,736
Let's do it.

704
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:42,566
'Go to Palika Bazaar in Delhi.'

705
00:51:43,075 --> 00:51:45,908
'Go there and buy the spy cameras.'

706
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:48,013
'And learn how to use them.'

707
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,546
'Spend the advance wisely.'

708
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,777
'You've to keep track of
all the expenses now.'

709
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,577
'Numerous marriages take
place everyday in India.'

710
00:51:56,756 --> 00:51:58,087
'Now, with so many marriages... '

711
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,022
'... there's bound to be
as many honeymoons.'

712
00:52:00,092 --> 00:52:05,553
'Couples flock to hill stations
like Simla, Manali, Nainital.'

713
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:07,030
'Choose one
destination and set out.'

714
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:09,829
'No one's going to find out.'

715
00:52:09,902 --> 00:52:11,199
'But remember.'

716
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,295
'Lf you're caught
then you'll be at risk.'

717
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:23,076
"We wouldn't have
known what love is."

718
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:27,618
"I wouldn't have lived without you."

719
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:33,850
Hello.

720
00:52:34,226 --> 00:52:35,818
Dolly.

721
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,090
Hello.

722
00:52:38,998 --> 00:52:40,659
Where the hell are you?

723
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:42,556
Hello.

724
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:49,502
She's my girlfriend.

725
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:53,671
I swear. I have one in every city.

726
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:57,775
I don't look like one, right.

727
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,911
It's her calling.

728
00:53:00,753 --> 00:53:02,778
Yes, Dolly.

729
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:07,053
What? What? What? Say it again.

730
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:10,923
Just listen.

731
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:18,261
Yes, Dolly.

732
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:23,565
I see.

733
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:25,902
Really?

734
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,714
Who?

735
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:33,046
Akshay Kumar.

736
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:36,886
She's saying I look
like Akshay Kumar.

737
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,017
You're missing me, right.

738
00:53:41,894 --> 00:53:43,725
You're alone.

739
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:45,256
Who else?

740
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,793
Give him the phone.

741
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,001
Pinky.

742
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:55,540
What are you wearing?

743
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,005
Her sister's my girlfriend too.

744
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:04,176
What are you wearing?

745
00:54:06,018 --> 00:54:09,818
What are you wearing below?

746
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,094
Dolly. Dolly.

747
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,726
Listen...

748
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,159
I was talking to you.

749
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:23,701
Why did you give
the phone to Pinky?

750
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,535
Horny?

751
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:28,072
Disconnect the call.

752
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,767
I don't want to talk to you.

753
00:54:31,844 --> 00:54:33,539
Brother.

754
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,577
Elders have said that...

755
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:40,141
...a real man never lets
women become a trouble for him.

756
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:43,687
What a saying.

757
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:47,192
"Who else would I have
called when my heart yearned."

758
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:48,718
Myself Vicky.

759
00:54:48,794 --> 00:54:50,921
"What is love..."

760
00:55:07,613 --> 00:55:16,715
"I've sworn to... make you mine."

761
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,287
Bittoo, where are you?

762
00:55:35,608 --> 00:55:37,200
"You're a pigeon. I am a pigeon."

763
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,943
"The world's a pigeon coop."

764
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:42,742
"Everyone's going to fly
away after pecking their grain."

765
00:55:42,815 --> 00:55:44,612
"You're a pigeon. I am a pigeon."

766
00:55:44,683 --> 00:55:46,048
"The world's a pigeon coop."

767
00:55:46,118 --> 00:55:49,246
"Everyone's going to fly
away after pecking their grain."

768
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,989
"Hold on to this saying."

769
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,819
"Everyone's a passer-by."

770
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,723
"Hold on to this saying."

771
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,557
"Everyone's a passer-by."

772
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:58,221
"Hold on to this saying."

773
00:55:58,497 --> 00:56:00,055
"Everyone's a passer-by."

774
00:56:00,132 --> 00:56:01,827
"Hold on to this saying."

775
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:04,995
"Everyone's a passer-by."

776
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:15,079
"The world's crazy about money."

777
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:18,708
"Everyone's contracted the
disease of making money."

778
00:56:18,784 --> 00:56:22,276
"The world's crazy about money."

779
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:25,854
"Everyone's contracted the
disease of making money."

780
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,985
"The cars and
bungalows will be left behind."

781
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:30,858
"Hold on to this saying."

782
00:56:30,896 --> 00:56:32,625
"Everyone's a passer-by."

783
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,562
"Hold on to this saying."

784
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:36,032
"Everyone's a passer-by."

785
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,898
"Hold on to this saying."

786
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,767
"Everyone's a passer-by."

787
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,534
"Hold on to this saying."

788
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,974
"Everyone's a passer-by."

789
00:56:53,252 --> 00:56:54,514
Yes, Mr. Verma.

790
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,044
Don't ask.

791
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:58,186
We're spending the money.

792
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:00,016
What can I do?

793
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:01,582
There's nothing to do here.

794
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,150
No making shots or
holding the camera.

795
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:05,026
Just sit here and watch live Tv.

796
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:07,191
It's been a week here, Mr. Verma.

797
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:09,601
You...

798
00:57:16,675 --> 00:57:18,108
Brother.

799
00:57:24,283 --> 00:57:25,682
What's wrong?

800
00:57:26,886 --> 00:57:28,547
Do you want a girl?

801
00:57:40,566 --> 00:57:43,660
Boss, take me in your refuge.

802
00:57:44,036 --> 00:57:45,025
Really.

803
00:57:45,104 --> 00:57:48,562
My face has lost all lustre
by driving the taxi around.

804
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:53,037
After today all my resources
are with you, Bittoo boss.

805
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,846
It's a sexy job... but risky.

806
00:58:02,922 --> 00:58:04,753
I am still young.

807
00:58:04,823 --> 00:58:07,792
If I don't take a risk now,
then when will I. Right?

808
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,193
I've told you the entire scheme.

809
00:58:11,797 --> 00:58:14,664
But I haven't got what I wanted.

810
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,067
The root of half...

811
00:58:18,904 --> 00:58:22,271
The root of half of the
population of the world is Simla.

812
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,668
If you don't get it here,
then you won't get it anywhere.

813
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:25,710
Right?

814
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:32,217
"There were thousands like you."

815
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:35,845
"Someday you'll die, only
your eyes will remain open."

816
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:36,910
Boss.

817
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:39,184
There are a few angles.

818
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:42,651
I suggest that we setup
in two different rooms.

819
00:58:42,995 --> 00:58:46,226
"Someday we'll be
amongst the stars."

820
00:58:46,498 --> 00:58:47,829
"Hold on to this saying."

821
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:49,557
"Everyone's a passer-by."

822
00:58:49,702 --> 00:58:51,636
"Hold on to this saying."

823
00:58:51,704 --> 00:58:54,002
"Everyone's a passer-by."

824
00:59:15,661 --> 00:59:16,787
Thank you. - Welcome.

825
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:27,165
Relax.

826
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,936
Boss. They're newly married.

827
00:59:31,643 --> 00:59:33,577
It'll be fun.

828
00:59:36,215 --> 00:59:38,547
Thank God they're a married couple.

829
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:41,718
Wait.

830
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:44,712
First, I need to change.

831
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,554
Yes, go and change.

832
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,029
Raj. Why did you bring
a fake ID proof along?

833
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:54,460
You're very smart.

834
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:57,229
I had almost fainted when
they asked for the ID proof.

835
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:00,668
You're no less of a ham.

836
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:04,004
What is this braclets,
and vermillion?

837
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:09,180
You won't know the value
of this vermillion, Raj.

838
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:13,517
We were allowed because of this.

839
01:00:13,552 --> 01:00:15,986
Otherwise you still look like
a school boy in these clothes.

840
01:00:16,055 --> 01:00:18,990
Oh, God. They're school children.

841
01:00:19,258 --> 01:00:20,190
Yes, boss.

842
01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:21,248
I see.

843
01:00:21,894 --> 01:00:24,158
Go and change. Go on.
- I am leaving.

844
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:43,073
Boss. Now watch, the
things that he gets out.

845
01:00:47,753 --> 01:00:49,118
Candle.

846
01:00:50,722 --> 01:00:52,155
A big one.

847
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,668
Lights. Candle.

848
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,606
All that's left is the action.

849
01:01:12,244 --> 01:01:15,873
Boss, the track of our
first film is ready.

850
01:01:16,815 --> 01:01:20,478
"Step in the darkness."

851
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:26,749
"Commit a sin."

852
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:29,091
What a great body.

853
01:01:30,496 --> 01:01:32,521
You can kill anyone.

854
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:33,928
Cool.

855
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:39,066
Come on.

856
01:01:51,717 --> 01:01:52,945
Raj.

857
01:01:54,153 --> 01:01:56,917
Don't they have
inverter or generators?

858
01:01:58,824 --> 01:02:01,657
I don't know. - What?

859
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:06,664
I don't know.
- What are you saying?

860
01:02:06,899 --> 01:02:08,127
I don't know.

861
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,565
If I had known then
we could've told...

862
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:10,659
...industrialist Deepak Kapoor.

863
01:02:10,736 --> 01:02:11,794
He would've sent it.

864
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:13,929
Why are you dragging papa in this?

865
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,264
I am going. - No, no.

866
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:19,743
Priya. Priya. Priya.
I am sorry, Priya.

867
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,641
Priya. I was just joking.

868
01:02:23,882 --> 01:02:24,906
Sorry.

869
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:26,951
Priya. Sorry.

870
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,677
Priya.

871
01:02:28,854 --> 01:02:29,912
Priya.

872
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:32,952
Can't the sixth
richest man in India...

873
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:37,928
...install a generator or inverter
in this hotel for his daughter.

874
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:41,894
Sorry. - Still no.

875
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:43,899
Why do you drag father in this?

876
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,062
Sorry, I won't. Sorry.

877
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:50,803
You know?

878
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:58,912
Today, we'll become adults.

879
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:00,843
Adults.

880
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:04,046
How does one become an adult, boss?

881
01:03:05,123 --> 01:03:07,023
You don't worry.

882
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:09,219
You must been one from birth.

883
01:03:09,261 --> 01:03:11,092
Let's forget the world, baby.

884
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,755
I don't look like one, don't I?

885
01:03:14,266 --> 01:03:15,665
Love me, know.

886
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,596
Raj.

887
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,064
You love me. - Yes, I love you.

888
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:24,665
Obviously.

889
01:03:26,812 --> 01:03:27,870
Raj.

890
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,075
Raj, phone.

891
01:03:30,616 --> 01:03:31,583
Priya.

892
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:32,942
Raj, phone.

893
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,614
What is it?

894
01:03:39,658 --> 01:03:41,216
What is this misbehaviour?

895
01:03:43,729 --> 01:03:44,718
Hello.

896
01:03:44,896 --> 01:03:45,863
Yes.

897
01:03:46,598 --> 01:03:47,622
No.

898
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:48,925
Wait.

899
01:03:56,975 --> 01:03:58,966
I will if you let me do something.

900
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:01,170
You always call at the wrong time.

901
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,674
Yes, she's here to
lose her virginity.

902
01:04:07,953 --> 01:04:10,649
But she's always
asking me the same question.

903
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,053
"Do you love me. Do you love me."

904
01:04:12,658 --> 01:04:13,920
I already said it.

905
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:15,592
Does she want me to give up my life?

906
01:04:15,661 --> 01:04:17,720
Fine. It will happen soon.

907
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:19,160
I won't let her go.

908
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:20,663
This is wrong.

909
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:22,793
Disconnect the call.

910
01:04:22,868 --> 01:04:25,632
I can mesmerize the
girl over the call.

911
01:04:25,704 --> 01:04:28,138
And I can tell you
the boy's intentions.

912
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:30,835
He looks more
experienced than his age.

913
01:04:35,614 --> 01:04:36,774
Priya.

914
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,813
Sorry, Priya.

915
01:04:40,052 --> 01:04:41,644
Sorry, baby.

916
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:42,981
Raj, listen.

917
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:44,580
Listen.

918
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:47,249
Are we doing the right thing? - Yes.

919
01:04:47,526 --> 01:04:49,551
This is not wrong. It's okay.

920
01:04:49,628 --> 01:04:51,755
Raj. Leave me.

921
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,024
What are you doing?

922
01:04:53,198 --> 01:04:54,756
Leave me.

923
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:56,731
Raj, leave me.

924
01:04:58,603 --> 01:04:59,535
Raj.

925
01:04:59,705 --> 01:05:00,831
What are you doing?

926
01:05:00,972 --> 01:05:02,064
Raj.

927
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:03,608
Raj, please.

928
01:05:04,176 --> 01:05:05,768
Raj, leave me.

929
01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:33,732
Are you Mr. Duggi's son?

930
01:05:36,942 --> 01:05:39,536
304.

931
01:05:41,113 --> 01:05:42,603
You are not Bursheed Khawda?

932
01:05:48,186 --> 01:05:50,814
Yes, I am Bursheed Khawda.

933
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:53,153
Bursheed Khawda's son.

934
01:05:53,225 --> 01:05:55,489
Great.

935
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,822
It's a small world.

936
01:05:56,895 --> 01:05:58,624
It's nice.

937
01:05:58,697 --> 01:05:59,959
My friend...

938
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:05,702
It's a nice room.

939
01:06:11,243 --> 01:06:13,006
You're married.

940
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,702
You didn't tell me.

941
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,678
Marriage.

942
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:18,079
Everything happened so quickly.

943
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:19,174
I didn't get the time to tell you.

944
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:20,183
This is wrong.

945
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:21,947
I will tell uncle right now.

946
01:06:22,087 --> 01:06:24,681
Thankfully I read uncle name
and address at the reception...

947
01:06:24,723 --> 01:06:26,190
...otherwise I wouldn't have known.

948
01:06:26,258 --> 01:06:28,749
Surprising. - No, no,
why are you calling papa?

949
01:06:28,827 --> 01:06:30,522
He must be sleeping.

950
01:06:31,763 --> 01:06:32,855
So soon?

951
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:35,659
He's old now.

952
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:36,826
So he sleeps early.

953
01:06:36,902 --> 01:06:40,736
Yes, of course,
you're the young one.

954
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,940
"Don't call papa."

955
01:06:44,242 --> 01:06:45,937
Don't you worry.

956
01:06:46,011 --> 01:06:48,980
I will ask papa to call you as
soon as we reach Delhi. Sure.

957
01:06:49,681 --> 01:06:50,773
You'll call me?

958
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,739
How?

959
01:06:52,818 --> 01:06:54,046
How?

960
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,677
Do you know who I am?

961
01:06:56,188 --> 01:06:56,847
So?

962
01:06:56,922 --> 01:06:57,820
Great.

963
01:06:57,856 --> 01:06:59,824
Uncle didn't even
invite me to the party.

964
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:00,880
This is wrong.

965
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,022
The party is yet to happen.

966
01:07:03,094 --> 01:07:04,755
The party is pending.

967
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:06,024
The party will happen now.

968
01:07:22,614 --> 01:07:24,241
Will a beer party do?

969
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:52,770
Boss.

970
01:07:55,247 --> 01:07:57,010
We won't get the job done this way?

971
01:07:57,749 --> 01:07:59,774
Look, the girls ready.

972
01:08:00,218 --> 01:08:01,947
But the boy's good for nothing.

973
01:08:03,889 --> 01:08:06,858
This time I will find
the right guy.

974
01:08:07,726 --> 01:08:11,162
Even if I have to go all
the way to Delhi for it.

975
01:08:49,968 --> 01:08:51,458
Please wait by the car.

976
01:08:56,608 --> 01:08:57,700
Papa...

977
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:05,780
You still have the
audacity to look...

978
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,842
...into your papa's
eyes and talk to him.

979
01:09:13,058 --> 01:09:14,958
For the past two days you...

980
01:09:16,661 --> 01:09:19,186
You know what we were
going through?

981
01:09:20,231 --> 01:09:23,598
You have betrayed the freedom,
the trust...

982
01:09:35,747 --> 01:09:39,547
You did what you
had come here to do.

983
01:09:40,085 --> 01:09:41,643
Now leave. - Papa...

984
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,714
Don't. Don't you dare
cry in front of me now.

985
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,223
You have... you are a shame.

986
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:52,223
Cut. Cut. Cut, it's a cut.

987
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,927
What? What's going on?

988
01:09:56,735 --> 01:09:57,895
Excuse me.

989
01:09:58,103 --> 01:10:01,504
I think you have come to
the wrong room. Please leave.

990
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:04,064
Sir, you have come
to the wrong room.

991
01:10:04,142 --> 01:10:05,700
You spoilt the entire scene.

992
01:10:05,777 --> 01:10:07,540
You didn't tell him?

993
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:10,713
Bloody hell. Who are you?

994
01:10:10,782 --> 01:10:13,649
Bittoo. Video shooter.

995
01:10:13,718 --> 01:10:14,878
Video shooter.

996
01:10:14,953 --> 01:10:16,784
We're shooting a film here.

997
01:10:18,523 --> 01:10:21,014
We're shooting a film here.

998
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:24,255
Yes. Look. The
camera is installed here.

999
01:10:26,531 --> 01:10:27,589
See this.

1000
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:28,655
The camera is installed here.

1001
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,068
Yes. See this.

1002
01:10:32,137 --> 01:10:33,604
This is the top angle.

1003
01:10:33,672 --> 01:10:34,832
For a sexy angle.

1004
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:39,472
Here. Move.

1005
01:10:39,811 --> 01:10:41,574
See this.

1006
01:10:42,013 --> 01:10:43,002
This.

1007
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:46,482
Cameras are installed.

1008
01:10:46,918 --> 01:10:48,909
I am shooting a film here.

1009
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:53,048
You are shooting with
these cameras?

1010
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:55,025
Yes. It's the demand of the scene.

1011
01:10:55,527 --> 01:10:58,519
Sir, if you permit,
shall I finish the scene?

1012
01:11:03,034 --> 01:11:06,970
Look. You made my actress cry.

1013
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:09,138
Mollify her lovingly.

1014
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,764
It's a two-minute scene.

1015
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:12,742
You can scold her later. Fine?

1016
01:11:12,911 --> 01:11:14,902
Come on, dear. Wipe your tears.
Come here. Come here.

1017
01:11:15,013 --> 01:11:15,945
Come here.

1018
01:11:17,716 --> 01:11:19,707
Finish your scene with him quietly.

1019
01:11:19,784 --> 01:11:22,184
Your father will watch the
monitor with me in the other room.

1020
01:11:22,253 --> 01:11:22,776
Okay?

1021
01:11:22,854 --> 01:11:24,151
What scene?

1022
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:25,513
That one.

1023
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:30,584
Small things do happen
in big cities. It happens.

1024
01:11:30,862 --> 01:11:32,261
Take it from there.

1025
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:36,232
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1026
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,628
And you, listen.

1027
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:42,202
Capture the emotion properly.
And hear the dialogue properly.

1028
01:11:42,741 --> 01:11:44,003
You fool.

1029
01:11:46,044 --> 01:11:47,068
Sir.

1030
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,510
Come with me. I will show you.

1031
01:11:50,915 --> 01:11:52,940
Sir, come. I will show you.

1032
01:11:55,086 --> 01:11:56,280
Come. Come.

1033
01:11:56,855 --> 01:11:57,549
Come.

1034
01:11:57,789 --> 01:11:58,551
Sir.

1035
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:00,889
Come. I will show you.

1036
01:12:00,959 --> 01:12:02,051
Come. Come.

1037
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,844
Dear, stop crying.

1038
01:12:25,283 --> 01:12:26,113
Action.

1039
01:12:26,184 --> 01:12:27,310
Okay.

1040
01:12:39,164 --> 01:12:40,961
I don't know what to say.

1041
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,828
What do I say?

1042
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:55,201
I don't have any
justification for what I did.

1043
01:13:00,118 --> 01:13:02,780
I had come to liberate myself.

1044
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:09,752
When I came here, I found out
I am trapped in an illusion.

1045
01:13:12,664 --> 01:13:15,656
How can you do this to me?

1046
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,071
No.

1047
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:27,970
How can I do this?

1048
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:35,143
I never wanted to
do anything wrong.

1049
01:13:36,187 --> 01:13:37,950
I really loved you.

1050
01:13:40,058 --> 01:13:41,525
But you.

1051
01:13:45,196 --> 01:13:46,595
You hurt myself.

1052
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,795
And even my father.

1053
01:14:02,947 --> 01:14:05,177
Why did I come here?

1054
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:11,746
I made a mistake.

1055
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:13,120
I...

1056
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:16,260
I don't know what to say.

1057
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:28,296
Don't you dare touch me.

1058
01:14:28,907 --> 01:14:30,932
Don't you dare touch me.

1059
01:14:30,975 --> 01:14:32,169
You get it.

1060
01:14:34,112 --> 01:14:35,704
Stay away from me.

1061
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:48,151
So now?

1062
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:52,052
Now?

1063
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:54,960
You can take your daughter home.

1064
01:15:05,977 --> 01:15:07,638
Tell her that the shoot's over.

1065
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:11,811
Her father's
waiting at the reception.

1066
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:13,641
And me?

1067
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:14,946
You stay right here.

1068
01:15:15,253 --> 01:15:16,811
I still have to
take few shots of you.

1069
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,051
Yes.

1070
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,695
Thank you.

1071
01:15:26,764 --> 01:15:28,129
If only you had
explained her earlier...

1072
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:30,258
Next time she won't come for
a shoot without informing.

1073
01:15:30,535 --> 01:15:32,969
You as well as I
will face a problem.

1074
01:15:33,538 --> 01:15:35,904
They are kids. They make a mistake.

1075
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,676
You think I am a fool.

1076
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:46,482
I admit my daughter
has realised her mistake.

1077
01:15:47,518 --> 01:15:51,045
But how does that
put you in the picture?

1078
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,917
By showing all the hidden cameras...

1079
01:15:55,893 --> 01:16:00,489
...you are trying to assure me
a shooting is going on here.

1080
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:02,588
Why?

1081
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:09,699
Your planning must have gone wrong.

1082
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,969
No. No. I never planned anything.

1083
01:16:12,043 --> 01:16:13,271
That's why I came here.

1084
01:16:14,545 --> 01:16:16,536
You are elder to me.
You are sensible.

1085
01:16:16,814 --> 01:16:17,644
You are right.

1086
01:16:17,749 --> 01:16:20,240
What was going to
happen was not right.

1087
01:16:20,985 --> 01:16:25,012
But what happened, it
was also not wrong. Right?

1088
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,719
Now...

1089
01:16:31,763 --> 01:16:33,754
Sir, whatever happened in the room...

1090
01:16:33,831 --> 01:16:36,197
...has been recorded
in this local disc.

1091
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,460
Take it.

1092
01:17:04,929 --> 01:17:06,157
What do you want?

1093
01:17:06,931 --> 01:17:08,125
What do I want?

1094
01:17:08,933 --> 01:17:10,696
Marriage,
reception, happy birthday...

1095
01:17:10,768 --> 01:17:11,757
...night veneration, party, sir.

1096
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,167
You might forget to call the guests.

1097
01:17:13,604 --> 01:17:15,003
But don't forget
Bittoo video shooter.

1098
01:17:16,107 --> 01:17:17,540
What? - Yes.

1099
01:17:22,814 --> 01:17:24,145
Bittoo video shooter.

1100
01:17:28,052 --> 01:17:30,850
Sir, after watching
the local disc D...

1101
01:17:30,922 --> 01:17:33,652
...if possible
delete it and return it.

1102
01:17:34,459 --> 01:17:35,949
No. Even if you don't
return it, it's fine.

1103
01:17:37,595 --> 01:17:42,089
And if I made any
mistake unintentionally, sorry.

1104
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,197
"Money. Money."

1105
01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:49,235
"Money. Money."

1106
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,708
"Money. Money."

1107
01:17:52,143 --> 01:17:54,611
"Money. Money."

1108
01:18:50,234 --> 01:18:53,533
Boss. Boss, with luck
a fantastic couple...

1109
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:54,901
...has come in room 407.

1110
01:18:54,972 --> 01:18:56,803
You will be delighted
when you will see them.

1111
01:18:56,874 --> 01:19:03,143
A hot girl and a brawny guy.

1112
01:19:03,214 --> 01:19:05,944
Both have come from a village in UP.

1113
01:19:06,017 --> 01:19:08,679
Shakuntala and Chote Lal.

1114
01:19:08,853 --> 01:19:12,482
The boy is a bit shy. He talks less.

1115
01:19:12,823 --> 01:19:16,623
But the girl is very blunt.

1116
01:19:16,694 --> 01:19:20,721
I swear. She will beat the wrestler.

1117
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:24,830
How do I look?

1118
01:19:26,537 --> 01:19:29,700
I look like Kareena in
a black dress. Don't I?

1119
01:19:30,274 --> 01:19:31,605
Yes.

1120
01:19:33,544 --> 01:19:34,636
You have freshened up?

1121
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:35,805
Yes.

1122
01:19:36,781 --> 01:19:40,547
I am fresh since morning.

1123
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:48,086
Go. First go to the toilet.

1124
01:19:49,193 --> 01:19:54,153
I didn't do anything. I moved.
So the sofa made a sound.

1125
01:19:54,232 --> 01:19:55,722
It's okay.

1126
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,197
Look here.

1127
01:20:02,907 --> 01:20:03,805
Yes.

1128
01:20:04,642 --> 01:20:05,870
Look into my eyes.

1129
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:15,143
I was thinking... - What?

1130
01:20:16,153 --> 01:20:19,987
Let's go and see Shimla,
Ms. Shakuntala.

1131
01:20:20,057 --> 01:20:22,651
First stop calling me,
Ms. Shakuntala.

1132
01:20:22,727 --> 01:20:26,823
So what should I call you,
Ms. Shakuntala?

1133
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:30,860
In college everybody
would call me Shaks.

1134
01:20:31,602 --> 01:20:32,864
You also call me that.

1135
01:20:32,937 --> 01:20:33,961
Shaks.

1136
01:20:37,074 --> 01:20:38,132
Sex.

1137
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:42,474
Not sex.

1138
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,079
He is right.

1139
01:20:44,148 --> 01:20:48,016
Shakuntala. Sex. Right?

1140
01:20:50,855 --> 01:20:52,550
Shaks. - I...

1141
01:20:54,025 --> 01:20:55,652
Sex.

1142
01:20:56,093 --> 01:20:57,856
No problem.

1143
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:01,130
It sounds good when
you say it. - Yes.

1144
01:21:03,534 --> 01:21:06,128
'Mrinalini.'

1145
01:21:07,505 --> 01:21:08,733
'Marnalini.'

1146
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,631
'Not Mar, Mri.'

1147
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:14,508
'Mrinalini. Mrinalini.

1148
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:16,742
'My beloved.'

1149
01:21:16,947 --> 01:21:17,936
'Get lost. I won't play.'

1150
01:21:18,115 --> 01:21:20,845
'What's there in a name?
Tell me one thing.'

1151
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,714
'We are friends, aren't we? '

1152
01:21:25,056 --> 01:21:27,024
'Yes.'

1153
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:29,923
'Thank God.'

1154
01:21:30,494 --> 01:21:32,894
'Yes. So I will give
you a different name.'

1155
01:21:32,963 --> 01:21:35,124
'Bittoo's friend. Bitti.'

1156
01:21:35,733 --> 01:21:36,700
'Bitti? '

1157
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:37,927
'Bitti.'

1158
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:59,281
What's the problem?

1159
01:22:00,024 --> 01:22:02,254
I only held your hand on the road.

1160
01:22:03,027 --> 01:22:06,155
You jerked it away as if I
have a contagious disease.

1161
01:22:06,864 --> 01:22:09,731
I admit I am elder to you.

1162
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:12,831
I admit you didn't get time
to say yes for the marriage.

1163
01:22:12,903 --> 01:22:16,100
I admit I was unmarried for years.

1164
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:51,970
What happened?

1165
01:22:52,743 --> 01:22:55,109
What do I do?

1166
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:58,239
What do I do? What do I do?

1167
01:22:59,216 --> 01:23:01,741
Why do you have a problem with me?

1168
01:23:01,819 --> 01:23:05,277
I don't have a problem with you.
I have a problem with myself.

1169
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:07,757
Why?

1170
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,060
Because I am not worthy of you.

1171
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:15,997
Destiny took a turn.

1172
01:23:16,734 --> 01:23:18,827
My brother went crazy.

1173
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,172
He ran away on the
day of his marriage.

1174
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:26,704
Aunt, held my hand and made
me sit on the wedding dais.

1175
01:23:26,777 --> 01:23:30,577
I didn't realise when I
married you and reached here.

1176
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:37,744
Suddenly I realised.

1177
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:42,218
What have you done?

1178
01:23:43,093 --> 01:23:49,191
A modern girl like Shakuntala
is with a villager like you.

1179
01:23:51,802 --> 01:23:53,793
I am not a fairy.

1180
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:55,937
I am from your world.

1181
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:09,579
Your and my life is not different.

1182
01:24:11,789 --> 01:24:13,051
Come on.

1183
01:24:13,691 --> 01:24:18,025
I will cheer you up.

1184
01:24:19,864 --> 01:24:24,062
I was thinking let's see Shimla.

1185
01:24:28,806 --> 01:24:31,297
Will this wrestler do something?

1186
01:24:32,076 --> 01:24:33,976
Both love each other a lot.

1187
01:24:34,845 --> 01:24:36,870
But the wrestler is
not ready to express it.

1188
01:24:37,081 --> 01:24:39,675
How long will the poor
girl endure his misery?

1189
01:24:41,252 --> 01:24:42,981
What will you do?

1190
01:24:49,894 --> 01:24:52,055
I will reunite the
hero and the heroine.

1191
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:53,824
Enough of live TV.

1192
01:24:54,698 --> 01:24:57,861
Now, Bittoo will make a real film.

1193
01:25:12,283 --> 01:25:14,012
"Bittoo boss."

1194
01:25:15,786 --> 01:25:17,185
"Bittoo boss."

1195
01:25:45,482 --> 01:25:46,244
Here you go.

1196
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:47,779
And get some rest.

1197
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:57,925
If your life's devoid of
happiness even after marriage...

1198
01:25:57,995 --> 01:26:05,197
...if its lacking marital bliss,
or if you have lost your mojo.

1199
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:10,172
And if its lacking the endurance...

1200
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,232
...then don't keep it to yourself.

1201
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:17,879
Awaken the man inside you.

1202
01:26:17,948 --> 01:26:22,248
No medication or asana.

1203
01:26:22,519 --> 01:26:25,977
We will awaken your desires.

1204
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,858
Let's begin.

1205
01:26:32,029 --> 01:26:33,291
Careful.

1206
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:36,559
Why did you have to
carry that heavy luggage?

1207
01:26:36,634 --> 01:26:39,501
You hurt yourself in
trying to help others.

1208
01:26:40,938 --> 01:26:43,031
It's just a muscle pull.

1209
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:50,046
With your permission, shall
I soothe your pain? - Yes.

1210
01:26:51,615 --> 01:26:55,016
I wonder what...

1211
01:26:55,052 --> 01:26:56,485
I couldn't switch it off.

1212
01:26:56,553 --> 01:26:58,748
Fine, forget about it.

1213
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:00,849
What...

1214
01:27:04,962 --> 01:27:06,554
What happened?

1215
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:07,862
Take it off.

1216
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,023
I...

1217
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,730
I feel shy.

1218
01:27:13,637 --> 01:27:14,899
I'm only applying the ointment.

1219
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:16,572
Okay. One second.

1220
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,841
Don't worry. I won't bite.

1221
01:27:28,252 --> 01:27:29,276
Take it off.

1222
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:44,498
That's...

1223
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,728
That's...

1224
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,040
He's that video guy.

1225
01:27:58,849 --> 01:28:04,845
"It's a great day, think about it."

1226
01:28:05,189 --> 01:28:10,752
"Look at this craziness."

1227
01:28:11,095 --> 01:28:16,624
"You're alone, so am I,
its great fun."

1228
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,895
"Really."

1229
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:21,761
"Really."

1230
01:28:23,907 --> 01:28:29,868
"Take a close look."

1231
01:28:30,214 --> 01:28:35,117
"We've met by fate."

1232
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:41,549
"Take a close look."

1233
01:28:41,592 --> 01:28:43,651
That's where I got the muscle pull.

1234
01:28:43,727 --> 01:28:48,687
"We've met by fate."

1235
01:28:49,166 --> 01:28:55,162
"We won't find this
moment and destination again."

1236
01:28:55,239 --> 01:29:02,771
"It's a great day, think about it."

1237
01:29:03,113 --> 01:29:08,710
"Look at this craziness."

1238
01:29:08,786 --> 01:29:14,088
"You're alone, so am I,
its great fun."

1239
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:16,718
"Really."

1240
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:29,005
You didn't tell me yet...
whether you love me or not.

1241
01:29:35,612 --> 01:29:36,874
I do.

1242
01:29:38,148 --> 01:29:39,809
I love you a lot.

1243
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:06,933
Yes.

1244
01:30:07,144 --> 01:30:08,634
Yes.

1245
01:30:08,879 --> 01:30:10,073
We've our film.

1246
01:30:10,147 --> 01:30:11,671
We've our film.

1247
01:30:11,748 --> 01:30:12,578
Boss.

1248
01:30:12,649 --> 01:30:14,139
We're doing it, boss.

1249
01:30:14,218 --> 01:30:15,150
Boss.

1250
01:30:15,185 --> 01:30:17,676
You're great, boss.

1251
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:18,810
You're great.

1252
01:30:18,922 --> 01:30:24,155
That guy got sex and
we got our first film.

1253
01:30:24,228 --> 01:30:29,029
Now Chotelal will be
famous in every nook and corner.

1254
01:30:29,099 --> 01:30:32,500
Chotelal's become a star.

1255
01:30:32,569 --> 01:30:35,197
And you, the king of blue-films.

1256
01:30:35,672 --> 01:30:36,661
Boss.

1257
01:30:37,007 --> 01:30:41,103
Don't forget your follower
after you become a millionaire.

1258
01:30:41,178 --> 01:30:42,202
Right.

1259
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,709
They've begun.

1260
01:31:08,872 --> 01:31:09,964
What...

1261
01:31:10,474 --> 01:31:11,600
What are you doing?

1262
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:14,811
What are you doing, boss?

1263
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:16,736
You took the out wire.

1264
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,213
It'll stop recording.

1265
01:31:19,483 --> 01:31:20,142
Boss.

1266
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,248
Boss, reconnect the wire.

1267
01:31:24,922 --> 01:31:26,913
You foiled the first film yourself.

1268
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:29,584
The second time we
finally got lucky...

1269
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,218
...and you're spoiling that too.

1270
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:33,492
Boss.

1271
01:31:33,997 --> 01:31:35,521
Boss, do something.

1272
01:31:37,668 --> 01:31:41,160
Boss. Reconnect the wire.

1273
01:31:42,172 --> 01:31:46,199
I've connected right wire...

1274
01:31:46,276 --> 01:31:49,575
...and disconnected the wrong one.

1275
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:53,138
Why? - I don't know why?

1276
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,144
That's how I am.

1277
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:56,549
But the film.

1278
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,888
We made the film.

1279
01:31:58,956 --> 01:32:01,652
And you saw it's magic as well.

1280
01:32:02,025 --> 01:32:05,017
Boss, make the film
that you should be making.

1281
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:07,722
Vicky.

1282
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:12,658
This... this isn't
what you call a film.

1283
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,966
Mr. Verma had said something...

1284
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:18,269
...and now I
understand what it means.

1285
01:32:19,676 --> 01:32:23,009
This is a humans most
innocent and naAve motion.

1286
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,306
And we can't interfere in it.

1287
01:32:27,117 --> 01:32:31,076
This is a personal
motion between two people.

1288
01:32:32,222 --> 01:32:34,190
We cannot put a cuss on it.

1289
01:32:35,225 --> 01:32:36,852
And why do we want to see them?

1290
01:32:37,561 --> 01:32:38,550
Why?

1291
01:32:38,829 --> 01:32:40,797
Why do we want to
peek in other's lives...

1292
01:32:40,831 --> 01:32:42,799
...and entertain ourselves?

1293
01:32:45,068 --> 01:32:49,004
This isn't just a physical motion.

1294
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:55,873
It's a connection between two souls.

1295
01:32:57,681 --> 01:33:01,708
It's the reason behind our
existence in this world.

1296
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:07,689
Vicky. If we look at it cheaply...

1297
01:33:07,758 --> 01:33:12,855
...then we're looking at
the entire world cheaply.

1298
01:33:14,731 --> 01:33:15,959
And I cannot do that.

1299
01:33:19,069 --> 01:33:21,629
I can be a cheap cameraman...

1300
01:33:22,706 --> 01:33:25,231
...but I cannot be a
cheap human being.

1301
01:33:26,043 --> 01:33:28,170
I cannot be a cheap
human being, Vicky.

1302
01:33:28,879 --> 01:33:32,042
But, boss? Money?

1303
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:34,007
Vicky.

1304
01:33:36,787 --> 01:33:39,756
A father hugging her daughter.

1305
01:33:40,857 --> 01:33:44,020
Chotelal expressing his love.

1306
01:33:44,227 --> 01:33:46,559
Bringing out the inner
feelings of people...

1307
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:49,997
...that's the real earning
of Bittoo video shooter.

1308
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:53,230
That's exactly what I earn.

1309
01:34:12,055 --> 01:34:13,079
Boss.

1310
01:34:15,258 --> 01:34:19,752
After hearing about yours and
sister-in-law Bitti's love story...

1311
01:34:21,098 --> 01:34:23,532
...there's just one
song I can think of.

1312
01:34:24,267 --> 01:34:26,098
Which one?

1313
01:34:26,603 --> 01:34:33,202
"Little, little... twinkle star."

1314
01:34:34,911 --> 01:34:43,182
"How I wonder... what you are."

1315
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:52,886
Vicky. Only He knows that.

1316
01:34:53,763 --> 01:34:58,564
The One who's
sitting amongst the stars...

1317
01:34:58,635 --> 01:35:01,866
...with his camera and lights.

1318
01:35:02,606 --> 01:35:08,511
And when his camera rolls
you have to do your action.

1319
01:35:10,981 --> 01:35:13,916
Then do it.

1320
01:35:15,952 --> 01:35:17,647
What should I do?

1321
01:35:21,858 --> 01:35:23,883
Action.

1322
01:35:26,663 --> 01:35:27,960
Action!

1323
01:35:31,835 --> 01:35:37,501
Vicky, some times you
say such thoughtful things.

1324
01:35:38,141 --> 01:35:39,972
I don't look like one, do I?

1325
01:35:43,513 --> 01:35:44,537
Do it.

1326
01:36:09,105 --> 01:36:11,039
Hello.

1327
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:13,005
Bitti.

1328
01:36:13,710 --> 01:36:15,610
Bittoo speaking.

1329
01:36:16,012 --> 01:36:18,105
I wanted to speak with you.

1330
01:36:42,606 --> 01:36:43,698
You?

1331
01:37:04,127 --> 01:37:05,594
In a month...

1332
01:37:06,162 --> 01:37:10,223
What have you done to yourself?

1333
01:37:15,071 --> 01:37:17,164
Does it take so long to call me?

1334
01:37:18,275 --> 01:37:21,039
If I had known that
I would get a hug...

1335
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:24,603
...then I would've called earlier.

1336
01:37:28,084 --> 01:37:29,244
Can I say something?

1337
01:37:31,187 --> 01:37:36,625
By the way... I
haven't become rich yet.

1338
01:37:37,794 --> 01:37:39,125
But I will become soon.

1339
01:37:39,195 --> 01:37:41,629
It's just a matter of time.

1340
01:37:42,832 --> 01:37:44,026
Can I say something?

1341
01:37:44,668 --> 01:37:45,726
Yes.

1342
01:37:46,102 --> 01:37:51,540
Money, job, earning
is important in life...

1343
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:54,509
...but we cannot
base our life on it.

1344
01:37:55,478 --> 01:38:01,246
Because from now our lives
are based on just one thing.

1345
01:38:03,987 --> 01:38:07,047
What's that? - I won't tell you.

1346
01:38:08,792 --> 01:38:11,852
And anyway, you're no ordinary guy.

1347
01:38:12,095 --> 01:38:13,255
Come back and take a look.

1348
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:15,589
Entire Anandpur's
shaken without you.

1349
01:38:16,666 --> 01:38:17,690
Really?

1350
01:38:23,206 --> 01:38:26,642
Now that you're with me, I
will take over the entire world.

1351
01:38:27,644 --> 01:38:29,544
I will take over the entire world.

1352
01:38:32,982 --> 01:38:34,882
Boss, you're back.

1353
01:38:36,586 --> 01:38:39,885
I had to go to the
bathroom urgently.

1354
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,981
So I came here in my sleep.

1355
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:45,226
Is someone else coming?

1356
01:38:46,496 --> 01:38:47,758
She's my girl.

1357
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:48,995
Bitti.

1358
01:38:49,065 --> 01:38:51,556
He's Vicky.

1359
01:38:52,535 --> 01:38:53,900
Bitti.

1360
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:57,198
Goddess Sita.

1361
01:38:59,576 --> 01:39:02,807
You're escaped from Lanka yourself.

1362
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:15,480
I'll go check the car.

1363
01:39:15,725 --> 01:39:17,784
I haven't driven it for a long time.

1364
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:20,224
So let's see if it starts up or not.

1365
01:39:32,575 --> 01:39:35,772
Camera, monitor... Even in the hotel.

1366
01:39:36,746 --> 01:39:39,806
There was work in
the hotel, that's why.

1367
01:39:39,949 --> 01:39:44,909
Are you making
honeymoon videos instead?

1368
01:39:56,833 --> 01:39:58,130
I was joking.

1369
01:40:13,183 --> 01:40:14,844
Lord.

1370
01:40:15,084 --> 01:40:16,574
Manners.

1371
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,649
You should cover your
mouth while yawning.

1372
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:21,123
What difference does it make?

1373
01:40:21,191 --> 01:40:23,716
No matter where you keep your hand...

1374
01:40:23,793 --> 01:40:26,819
...we're related by our yawns.

1375
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:29,956
What? Insolent.

1376
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,483
Leave me. What are you doing?

1377
01:40:49,686 --> 01:40:52,655
Preeto. Come closer.

1378
01:40:52,889 --> 01:40:54,220
No.

1379
01:40:56,025 --> 01:40:57,822
Leave me.

1380
01:42:09,532 --> 01:42:17,166
"My heart stays awake all night."

1381
01:42:18,575 --> 01:42:26,107
"It refuses to accept
that she was a stranger."

1382
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:35,549
"He's upset with itself."

1383
01:42:36,993 --> 01:42:45,526
"Doesn't know what it wants."

1384
01:42:45,902 --> 01:42:47,199
"Crazy."

1385
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:49,534
"Didn't get what it wanted."

1386
01:42:49,606 --> 01:42:51,938
"Didn't get what it wanted."

1387
01:42:52,008 --> 01:42:56,536
"The one it's running
after is just a shadow."

1388
01:42:56,613 --> 01:42:58,911
"Looked for numerous ways out."

1389
01:42:58,948 --> 01:43:00,882
"Endured so many sorrows."

1390
01:43:00,917 --> 01:43:03,010
"But it's just a shadow after all."

1391
01:43:03,086 --> 01:43:06,078
"It slipped through my hands."

1392
01:43:23,006 --> 01:43:31,744
"Why is life... full of dilemmas?"

1393
01:43:31,814 --> 01:43:41,052
"Why is it in such a state?"

1394
01:43:44,694 --> 01:43:45,820
No way.

1395
01:43:46,195 --> 01:43:48,629
I calculated the entire season,
the entire year...

1396
01:43:48,698 --> 01:43:50,723
...still we don't
have enough money...

1397
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,631
...to repay the clients.

1398
01:43:53,136 --> 01:43:54,899
Has the cat got your tongue?

1399
01:43:54,971 --> 01:43:56,700
Say something.

1400
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,268
If he can give us the money...

1401
01:43:58,541 --> 01:44:00,031
...then he can retrieve it as well.

1402
01:44:00,576 --> 01:44:03,943
You'll certainly die,
and take me with you.

1403
01:44:05,782 --> 01:44:07,545
"I stay confused."

1404
01:44:07,617 --> 01:44:09,949
"Don't hear or say anything."

1405
01:44:10,186 --> 01:44:14,646
"Tears trickle down my eyes."

1406
01:44:14,724 --> 01:44:17,022
"All relations are severed."

1407
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:19,085
"I fail to explain."

1408
01:44:19,162 --> 01:44:23,963
"Lost days and
companions never come back."

1409
01:44:27,003 --> 01:44:36,207
"Never... come back."

1410
01:44:36,779 --> 01:44:41,045
"Never... come back."

1411
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:43,981
"Why this pain?"

1412
01:44:44,053 --> 01:44:46,647
"Why this craving?"

1413
01:44:46,723 --> 01:44:50,955
"Why is my heart so upset?"

1414
01:44:51,027 --> 01:44:53,222
"Why this colour?"

1415
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,259
"Why this search."

1416
01:44:55,531 --> 01:44:58,694
"Tell me."

1417
01:44:58,868 --> 01:45:00,597
"Crazy."

1418
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:02,695
"His sighs have become cold."

1419
01:45:02,772 --> 01:45:05,002
"His life has become Ionely."

1420
01:45:05,074 --> 01:45:09,602
"His heart is still yearning."

1421
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,874
"The illusion..."

1422
01:45:11,948 --> 01:45:13,939
"The youthfulness."

1423
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:18,919
"He's completely shattered."

1424
01:45:32,602 --> 01:45:36,163
"The heart's awake..."

1425
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:42,041
"Awake..."

1426
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:48,644
"The heart's awake..."

1427
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:53,919
"Awake..."

1428
01:45:53,990 --> 01:46:00,259
"Crazy."

1429
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:19,980
Go on, Laddi.

1430
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:23,178
Get the medal from
the priest for Bittoo.

1431
01:46:23,853 --> 01:46:26,788
He's going to shoot a
marriage with his broken heart.

1432
01:46:27,557 --> 01:46:28,854
And without the camera.

1433
01:46:29,225 --> 01:46:32,717
Enlighten me as well.

1434
01:46:32,895 --> 01:46:34,726
Tell me how you'll do it.

1435
01:46:35,131 --> 01:46:37,725
How will you return the money?

1436
01:46:39,001 --> 01:46:41,492
I don't know how?

1437
01:46:41,571 --> 01:46:43,198
But I will shoot this marriage.

1438
01:46:43,472 --> 01:46:46,635
He thinks he's Capola.

1439
01:46:46,876 --> 01:46:49,242
He shoots important marriages.

1440
01:46:49,478 --> 01:46:51,139
Please, father, not today.

1441
01:46:55,551 --> 01:46:59,078
If not today, then never again.

1442
01:47:06,162 --> 01:47:12,158
He's addicted to
shooting other's marriages.

1443
01:47:14,003 --> 01:47:18,702
Your girlfriend's
marrying someone else...

1444
01:47:18,908 --> 01:47:22,105
...and you will shoot it yourself.

1445
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:28,514
I will shoot it, father.

1446
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:39,924
Son. I've seen you sulking today.

1447
01:47:40,096 --> 01:47:44,624
Don't you dare sulk again.

1448
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:47,901
You are my son.

1449
01:47:48,537 --> 01:47:51,700
Whether you drive your
car on the highway...

1450
01:47:51,774 --> 01:47:53,036
...or with the wedding procession.

1451
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:56,840
You should be the star, that's it.

1452
01:48:00,816 --> 01:48:04,183
Go. Get my daughter-in-law.

1453
01:48:07,623 --> 01:48:09,591
Go, get lost.

1454
01:48:25,942 --> 01:48:27,170
Hi.

1455
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:37,610
Hi.

1456
01:48:40,456 --> 01:48:42,014
Cut, cut, cut.

1457
01:48:42,692 --> 01:48:44,023
It's a cut.

1458
01:48:44,794 --> 01:48:45,920
She's your would-be wife.

1459
01:48:45,995 --> 01:48:47,895
Give her a tight hug.

1460
01:48:47,964 --> 01:48:49,192
Tightly.

1461
01:48:49,598 --> 01:48:51,463
You're still as arrogant.

1462
01:48:52,068 --> 01:48:53,831
Who allowed you in here?

1463
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:54,995
I've been booked.

1464
01:48:55,571 --> 01:48:57,937
The video guy never
needs anyone's permission.

1465
01:48:58,007 --> 01:48:58,803
Come on, let's go.

1466
01:48:58,874 --> 01:49:00,239
That's wrong.

1467
01:49:00,776 --> 01:49:02,869
I decorated the hall
with great difficulty.

1468
01:49:03,212 --> 01:49:04,645
It's your engagement.

1469
01:49:04,714 --> 01:49:06,648
Jinda's appointment.

1470
01:49:06,716 --> 01:49:08,047
It's a double celebration.

1471
01:49:08,117 --> 01:49:10,017
You cannot leave
before making a hot video.

1472
01:49:10,086 --> 01:49:11,883
Do you actually think you're smart?

1473
01:49:14,924 --> 01:49:16,983
A lousy cameraman, smart?

1474
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:18,924
Not at all. - Exactly.

1475
01:49:18,995 --> 01:49:20,895
Jinda's the smart one.

1476
01:49:20,963 --> 01:49:23,488
He's closed such a great deal.

1477
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:25,531
What nonsense.

1478
01:49:25,601 --> 01:49:26,693
Nonsense...

1479
01:49:28,971 --> 01:49:30,199
He didn't tell you.

1480
01:49:31,874 --> 01:49:33,535
That's fine. He must have forgotten.

1481
01:49:33,642 --> 01:49:34,506
I will tell you.

1482
01:49:34,577 --> 01:49:35,874
Come on, come with me.

1483
01:49:36,145 --> 01:49:36,907
Come on.

1484
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:39,206
Come, I will tell you.

1485
01:49:40,182 --> 01:49:41,706
Surprising.

1486
01:49:45,521 --> 01:49:47,182
It happened this morning.

1487
01:49:56,198 --> 01:49:58,792
My camera. - Wait.

1488
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:03,901
First tell me where did
you get the camera from?

1489
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:07,500
Forget it, why do you... - Wait.

1490
01:50:09,078 --> 01:50:11,046
Actually, I found a rich party.

1491
01:50:11,113 --> 01:50:13,047
Double the price and
long term business.

1492
01:50:13,115 --> 01:50:13,911
Just great.

1493
01:50:13,983 --> 01:50:16,213
I sold him the films
that I made for you.

1494
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:17,918
Took some advance.

1495
01:50:18,154 --> 01:50:20,122
I just have to make six more films.

1496
01:50:20,189 --> 01:50:24,523
After that I will
buy a nice, big shop.

1497
01:50:26,028 --> 01:50:29,225
Double price. - Yes.

1498
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:30,726
See you.

1499
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,195
Bittoo. - Yes.

1500
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:38,535
I will give you all
the films you want.

1501
01:50:39,208 --> 01:50:40,436
Introduce me to the party.

1502
01:50:43,746 --> 01:50:44,735
Payment terms?

1503
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:47,112
50% advance every week.

1504
01:50:47,183 --> 01:50:49,083
Direct account to account transfer.

1505
01:50:49,151 --> 01:50:51,881
10% commission from you.

1506
01:50:52,455 --> 01:50:54,150
The client's from Mumbai.

1507
01:50:54,223 --> 01:50:57,124
Kattobaby. Com.

1508
01:50:57,493 --> 01:51:00,621
When will you being work? - Begin?

1509
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:02,527
It has already begun.

1510
01:51:02,598 --> 01:51:04,828
Jinda has already
delivered them six films.

1511
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:07,892
And 25 lakhs were directly
transferred to his account.

1512
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:10,900
You mean Jinda and my
joint account. - Yes.

1513
01:51:10,973 --> 01:51:13,134
The account at Sardar
Pillar bank account.

1514
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:14,938
Which fake account is that?

1515
01:51:15,144 --> 01:51:16,771
Fake?

1516
01:51:23,085 --> 01:51:27,522
Sir. Sardar Pillar
Co-operative Bank account no...

1517
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:31,617
...5400471111. Chander Walia.

1518
01:51:33,629 --> 01:51:34,891
Are you done shooting?

1519
01:51:35,097 --> 01:51:37,224
So take your camera and get lost.

1520
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,692
What's wrong?

1521
01:51:38,868 --> 01:51:40,927
We're talking business here.

1522
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:42,601
Yes.

1523
01:51:42,872 --> 01:51:44,533
Big business and big money.

1524
01:51:44,974 --> 01:51:46,271
Private limited.

1525
01:51:46,642 --> 01:51:48,803
Keep your big jobs to yourself.

1526
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,148
How can you work with him?

1527
01:51:54,083 --> 01:51:56,779
Will I have to
take your permission...

1528
01:51:56,852 --> 01:51:59,116
...for who I should work with?

1529
01:52:05,161 --> 01:52:09,962
God's planning and rich people's
thinking is very high level.

1530
01:52:20,075 --> 01:52:21,838
It's great.

1531
01:52:21,911 --> 01:52:23,742
Just a minute.

1532
01:52:24,146 --> 01:52:26,842
How was your life as a bachelor,
brother-in-law?

1533
01:52:28,817 --> 01:52:30,978
Get the camera. - Yes.

1534
01:52:33,189 --> 01:52:34,918
Jinda. I need to talk to you.

1535
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:36,150
Go on.

1536
01:52:36,959 --> 01:52:38,017
There's a problem.

1537
01:52:38,127 --> 01:52:41,528
That Head of yours
found out about our deal.

1538
01:52:42,231 --> 01:52:44,131
I went to take shots
of the would-be bride...

1539
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,259
...but he made me give
him all the details.

1540
01:52:53,709 --> 01:52:57,110
I had told you earlier, let
this partnership continue.

1541
01:52:57,179 --> 01:52:59,943
You got me in trouble with
this new company, new account...

1542
01:53:00,015 --> 01:53:01,949
...and 100% profit.

1543
01:53:02,785 --> 01:53:04,650
He'll take the entire money.

1544
01:53:14,663 --> 01:53:16,563
You're taking part in
an auspicious ceremony...

1545
01:53:16,632 --> 01:53:18,156
...don't fill your
mind with vice thoughts.

1546
01:53:19,134 --> 01:53:21,625
Shall I call Jinda right here?

1547
01:53:39,955 --> 01:53:43,618
Jinda. Remember one thing.

1548
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:46,828
You could've have
never earned the money...

1549
01:53:46,895 --> 01:53:49,261
...I did in the last two years.

1550
01:53:49,498 --> 01:53:52,194
With your father's
flop television channel.

1551
01:53:52,901 --> 01:53:56,894
Concentrate on your engagement...

1552
01:53:57,273 --> 01:54:01,835
...and on the job you're paid for.

1553
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:04,808
Jinda, sir, this is wrong.

1554
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:05,878
What are you doing?

1555
01:54:06,081 --> 01:54:07,207
Everyone's watching.

1556
01:54:10,953 --> 01:54:12,181
Come with me.

1557
01:54:12,621 --> 01:54:13,588
We'll settle everything.

1558
01:54:13,656 --> 01:54:14,645
We'll clear this matter.

1559
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:15,688
Come on.

1560
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:17,889
Come on.

1561
01:54:34,243 --> 01:54:36,541
225.

1562
01:54:37,513 --> 01:54:41,108
225 blue-films. - Yes.

1563
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:44,648
I've invested money
for every film.

1564
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,813
But who sells it. It's me.

1565
01:54:46,889 --> 01:54:48,516
I won't supply the goods.

1566
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:49,750
Go and sell what you can.

1567
01:54:49,825 --> 01:54:50,849
What do you think?

1568
01:54:50,893 --> 01:54:52,952
Are you making missiles here?

1569
01:54:53,195 --> 01:54:56,562
I can make four blue-films
with my wife on the first night.

1570
01:54:57,633 --> 01:54:59,863
Tell him, the money
should be transferred...

1571
01:54:59,935 --> 01:55:01,129
...to our joint account.

1572
01:55:01,236 --> 01:55:02,726
Why should it?

1573
01:55:02,971 --> 01:55:04,233
Are you my wife?

1574
01:55:04,506 --> 01:55:07,202
Jinda, Sir, you two are surprising.

1575
01:55:07,743 --> 01:55:11,679
You two are the
Mario Bros of blue-films.

1576
01:55:11,914 --> 01:55:14,075
If you fight like Tom and Jerry
over a small deal worth millions...

1577
01:55:14,149 --> 01:55:16,174
...then what about me?

1578
01:55:17,186 --> 01:55:20,553
It concerns my 10%
commission as well.

1579
01:55:20,923 --> 01:55:22,857
Jinda, let's forget everything.

1580
01:55:22,925 --> 01:55:23,584
Come with me.

1581
01:55:23,659 --> 01:55:27,151
I suggest, lets make
it a joint venture.

1582
01:55:29,965 --> 01:55:31,933
Fine. - Great.

1583
01:55:33,168 --> 01:55:35,500
So, let's clear
everything right now.

1584
01:55:35,571 --> 01:55:36,560
Now tell me, which
account was the money...

1585
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:37,798
...from the
blue-film transferred to?

1586
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:39,531
Tell me your number.

1587
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:44,770
Bittoo Video Shooter.
- I know, I know.

1588
01:55:47,182 --> 01:55:49,844
Look. It has the account details.

1589
01:55:50,252 --> 01:55:52,584
That's fast technology.

1590
01:55:53,222 --> 01:55:54,211
Dena Bank.

1591
01:55:54,256 --> 01:55:55,746
That's a nice name.

1592
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:57,223
Dena. (Giving)

1593
01:55:57,793 --> 01:55:59,192
The money should be
transferred to this account.

1594
01:55:59,261 --> 01:55:59,955
Get that.

1595
01:56:00,028 --> 01:56:00,995
Fine.

1596
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:02,019
Fine.

1597
01:56:02,798 --> 01:56:03,594
Okay.

1598
01:56:03,799 --> 01:56:06,165
Let's confirm once again.

1599
01:56:06,668 --> 01:56:08,863
The money from all the
blue-films that you make...

1600
01:56:08,937 --> 01:56:11,497
...is transferred to this account.

1601
01:56:11,573 --> 01:56:15,134
Yes. Do you want me
to give it in writing?

1602
01:56:27,656 --> 01:56:28,748
Go.

1603
01:56:55,617 --> 01:56:56,641
Leave me.

1604
01:56:58,754 --> 01:56:59,778
Leave me.

1605
01:57:00,222 --> 01:57:01,883
Let's go.

1606
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:12,166
Bittoo Video Shooter.

1607
01:57:13,669 --> 01:57:14,636
Sir.

1608
01:57:15,003 --> 01:57:15,833
Well done.

1609
01:57:22,144 --> 01:57:24,044
You are a good man.

1610
01:57:28,016 --> 01:57:29,677
This is my consultation fee.

1611
01:57:30,052 --> 01:57:31,110
Fees.

1612
01:57:32,221 --> 01:57:33,518
You came to my office.

1613
01:57:33,989 --> 01:57:35,854
You bored me for two hours.

1614
01:57:36,792 --> 01:57:40,489
You used my money for this mission.

1615
01:57:41,129 --> 01:57:43,893
So... you'll have to pay the fee.

1616
01:57:48,237 --> 01:57:50,068
Come on, Bittoo.

1617
01:57:50,472 --> 01:57:51,564
I am just joking.

1618
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,608
Don't get so serious on me.

1619
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:56,204
Sir.

1620
01:57:57,513 --> 01:58:00,949
You helped me. I helped you.

1621
01:58:02,217 --> 01:58:03,013
