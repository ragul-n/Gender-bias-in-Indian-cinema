2
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,696
Why is it that a father is
never able to tell his son...

3
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,034
howmuch he loves him?

4
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:08,369
He's never able to embrace him
and sayl love you my son'?

5
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,137
Andthe mother?

6
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:14,784
She keeps repeating it, whether
her son listens to it or not.

7
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,287
But that doesn't mean
a father loves his son any less.

8
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,054
No one can fathomthe amount of love
that amother has for her son...

9
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,827
not eventhe mother.

10
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,064
Because there is no measure
for amother's love.

11
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,060
lt's an emotion
that can only be felt...

12
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,059
amother's emotion.

13
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,066
Rahul, my son... my life!

14
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,538
The match between Woodstock
lnternational and Manor House...

15
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,504
is at a very interestingturn.
5runs and one ball...

16
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,539
Can Woodstock lnternational's9-year
victory spell be broken in just aball?

17
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,947
Captain Vivek Singh spreads his field
towards the boundaries...

18
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,443
...andthe two batsmen
take their positions.

19
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,580
The excitement amongthe students
is rising.

20
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,386
The tension is mounting.

21
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,556
Manor House needs five runs
in one ball...Will Rohan do it?

22
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:48,797
lt's up to Rohanto break.

23
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,727
Woodstock lnternational's nine-year
spell of victory... Seems impossible.

24
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:54,798
Nothing is impossible. The entire game
rests on Rohan's shoulders.

25
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,869
Manor House is confident that
Rohan will do it!

26
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,628
lf youwant to be someone in life,
if youwant to achieve something...

27
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,632
if youwant to win,
always listento your heart.

28
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,774
And if your heart
doesn't give you any answers,

29
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:36,045
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

30
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:40,714
Andthen youwill cross
allthe hurdles...

31
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:44,448
allyour problems willvanish...
victory will be yours.

32
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,519
Only yours.

33
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,423
Hey, Mom and Dad...

39
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,396
Lots of Love, Rohan.

40
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,009
P.s., P.s... Before l come home
my two favourite girlfriends.

41
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:27,355
Hardwar?
Who are these girlfriends in Hardwar?

42
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,020
My two grandmothers...
maternal and paternal!

43
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,215
...8 a.m.

44
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,997

45
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,996
Where am l crying?

46
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,995
Of course not...
Where are you crying?

47
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,133
That's one truth andthe other one is
thatyou are very young...

48
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,668
Stop jokingwith me
early inthe morning...

49
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,805
What's the matter, Lajoji?

50
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:24,004
l remember Rahul
very oftenthese days.

51
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,811
Even l remember him.

52
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:28,409
But inthe last few days...

53
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,415
l have been feeling
very restless with his memories.

54
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,814
But why?

55
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:34,750
Listen...
We have lived our full lives.

56
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,618
Speak for yourself... l have
along life ahead... Touchwood!

57
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,360
Yes...
But l have to reach God's abode...

58
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,325
How will l face Himthere?

59
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,833
How will l explainthe reason, why
l couldn't unite my scattered family?

60
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:51,033
That l couldn't bring
my grandson back home?

61
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,704
How will l showmy face to Him?

62
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,208
Don't worry about it.

63
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,605
You are not goingto meet God anyway...
- Why?

64
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,780
Because he doesn't meet anyone
in Hell...

65
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,516
God... again your jokes
early inthe morning...

66
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:07,985
Hey you sweethearts...

67
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,485
Rohan!

68
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,089
Naani.
- My child.

69
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,991
What's the matter, Naani?
You look very sexy.

70
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:20,997
l know. Everyone says the same thing.

71
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,738
May you live long.

72
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,675
You have become very weak my son.

73
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,549
Now everyone can't be
as healthy as you are.

74
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,418
Oh!Just Shut up now.

75
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,821
What's the matter, Naani?
- What happened? ls she crying?

76
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,123
Then it's fine. l getvery worried
when she doesn't weep.

77
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,365
Just see... Rohan!
- Oh now stop ityoutwo...

78
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:03,368
Please stop crying Lajoji...
Please stop.

79
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,716
Your tears will raise alot of
questions in Rohan's mind and...

80
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,052
we won't have any answers
to his questions.

81
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,055
What do l do Kaur?
What do l do?

82
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:17,056
Whenever l see Rohan,
l think of Rahul even more

83
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,793
Don'tyouthink we should
tell him everything?

84
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,067
How can we tell him, Lajoji?
Yash has warned us against it.

85
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,897
Rohan was not even intown
when Rahul left home...

86
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,066
He doesn't know anything.

87
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,476
l think we should
tell him everything.

88
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,341
Where do we begin?
What do we tell him?

89
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:41,073
He doesn't even knowthat Rahulwas
not bornto Yash and Nandini.

90
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,484
He was adopted.

91
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:03,300
Rahulwas two days oldwhen
Yash and Nandini brought him home.

92
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:09,167
His tiny footsteps made aplace
in all our hearts.

93
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:30,727
He became Nandini's lifeline and
Yash's dream was fulfilled.

94
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,371
Nine years later,
when youwere born...

95
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:40,070
we felt that
our family was now complete.

96
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:46,742
l still remember
the astrologer sayingthat...

97
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,618
you fought destiny to be born.

98
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,089
Youwould be our strength.

99
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,622
Did Rahul bhaiyyaknow
that he was...?

100
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,696
Rahulwas eightyears old
when he got to know.

101
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,059
That was when Yash decidedthat...

102
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,731
the matter would never be mentioned
again inthe house...

103
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,060
Never again...

104
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:44,507
Rahulwas our son.
The eldest son of the house.

105
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,070
lt was atruththat could
never be changed.

106
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,076
But the fact was mentioned again...
Suddenly.

107
00:12:55,118 --> 00:13:02,820
Andthat was Rahul's last Diwaliwith
his family... Last Diwali.

108
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,212
Oh Allah! Rohan baba,
you have become so fat...

109
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,851
that nothing fits you anymore.

110
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,619
What's DJ? Say Daijaan.

atyour feet''

122
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,807
''We see you everywhere

00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:49,907
''Our lips chant no name butyours''

124
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:54,715
''Let our hearts be filled
with nothing butyour love''

125

127
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,435
Hey maa... How do you always sense

00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,719

Or was there something else?

Oh Allah...

00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,508
So what? He's a childyet...
He'll learn...

165
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:50,805
But if you don't allowhimto do it
himself, how will he learn? Fatty.

166
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,677
Why didyou come back from London?

What's happening here?

168
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:58,882
Mom you have over fed Rohan and

Yes, yes please laugh at me...
When l go away to...

170
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:05,093
the boarding schoolyouwill all
remember me. Nobody loves me.

171
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,825
By the way Fatty...
Mother loves me more than you.

172
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,733
- DJ...Just look at him.
- Calm down. He's jealous of you.

173
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,766
Mom, l missedyou.
- l missedyoutoo, baby.

174
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:19,803
Youwon't leave me again
and go, willyou?

175
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:23,045
l won't, but promise me, youwill not
feed me the way you, this pumpkin.

176
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,050
Nandini! Nandini!

177
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,216
Yes... Coming.

178
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,488
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

179
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,857
Who will knot this tie?
- Can'tyou do eventhat without me?

180
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:53,064
Here... Now youtruly look like
Mrs. Yashvardhan Raichand.

181
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,037
This's for you my son.

182
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,039
Fromtoday, the Raichand Empire
belongs to you.

183
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,957
Oops, Sorry Dad.
That's your grandfather. Salute him.

184
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:13,010
You know Rahul,
Thirty years ago he said...

185
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:17,748
certainthings to me inthis chamber,
which l will nowrepeat to you.

186
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:23,532
He said life offers you many
paths to choose from.

187
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,029
You must always choose
the one that is right...

188
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:30,602
the one where you don't have to
bend...where you don't fall.

189
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,775
Never take a step in life...

190
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,443
that will bring shame to
your family name or prestige.

191
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:44,043
Anyone can make money but earning
respect is not everyone's cup of tea.

192
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,059
l have not forgotten
his words tilltoday.

193
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,361
Even you should not.

194
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:06,003
Promise me thatyouwill follow
the traditions of the family.

195
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:13,008
Promise me thatyou'll never compromise
withthe self-respect of our family.

196
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:18,877
l promise papa...

197
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,256

the family name flying high.

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,029
l promise youthat l will always
keep you happy... always Papa

199
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,036
We have won.

200
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,413
Pooja, Pooja

201
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:46,544
We have wonthe match.

202
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,046
God, Sachin played so well...
100 runs not out.

203
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,058
Ok nowlisten, take care

204
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,849
Haldiraaam!

205
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,329
What a game!
What a game!What a game!

206
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,125
What a game!! By the way
what game are we playing?

207
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:09,570
lndiahas wonthe match!
- Oh so we have won... Hownice.

208
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,668
lf you didn't know,
what were you dancing for?

209
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,569
l was dancing because
allthe laddoos...

210
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,812
that my wife made
have been sold.

211
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,740
Sold out? How come?

212
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:20,879
There was a customer who told me
he wantedto eat laddoos...

213
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,280
that would drive him crazy.

214
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:26,922
Eating her laddos can cure
people who are insane and...

215
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:30,022
those who are normal become...
- Clean bowled!

216
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,251
lt was just ajoke...
- Stop it now...

217
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,019
Haven't even started ityet...
- Come on...

218
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:37,832
Rukhsar!
- Stop shouting so loudly...

219
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,194
The groom's side has come to
see Rukhsar for marriage.

220
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,404
Sit down. Salute them.

221
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,836
Grandmom...wake up...
the bride has arrived.

222
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,777
Oh! MashaAllah MashaAllah...

223
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,051
Her face is bright like
the full moon.

224
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,714
She is just what l had imagined.

225
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,422
Well... it's not me... its...
This is my daughter, Rukhsar.

226
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:05,651
What? Fever?

227
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,792
Not fever... mother,
She's Rukhsar!

228
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,226
Oh Rukhsar!

229
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,768
What happen?
- We have wonthe match.

230
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,007
My daughter's very
quiet and introverted.

231
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:22,402
We have won.
- Allah!What happened?

232
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:24,202
Quiet and introverted... eh?

233
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:28,016
lncidentally, what is her age?

234
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:30,852

- she's hundredyears old.
- What? Nine years old?

236
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:37,424
She's goingto turntwenty-one soon.
- Well...the blossoming of youth.

237
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,824
Actually we live in Lucknow.
But this is Chandni Chowk,

238
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:46,026
l guess... anyway l forgot to
tellyou, my son's name is Ashfaque.

239
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,200
Sachin!
- Sachin?

240
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,029
Sachin? ln case there's
someone else in her life....

241
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,403
No! No! Please don't say suchthings.

242
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:58,376
lt's.... her uncle Sachin...
her late uncle Sachin.

243
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,109
She was very attachedto him.

244
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,350
She always remembers
him on happy occassions.

245
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:06,310
Sachin...
Poor Sachin...

246
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:14,992
C'mon you girls...
l'llteach you alesson...

247
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:16,996
Oh God, ls everything alright?

248
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,597
Forget about me...
Ask me what she hasn't.

249
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:23,132
A nice wedding proposal
would have slipped out of our hands.

250
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:24,373
What?

251
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,341
180 by 100...
your blood pressure is high.

252
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,173
You mean BP is high-wigh!

253
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,512
Yes, it's high and it's
why' because of you.

254
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,406
l have just increasedthe dosage.
Please get these medicines.

255
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:40,021
Om Bhai, you must take care of yourself.
- This won't do...

256
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,482
Yes, Aunty...he just doesn't
take care of himself.

257
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,826
You just keep quiet...
l don't want to talkto you...

258
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,824
Why?
- Why? What is Sayeeda saying?

259
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:51,891
Oh! l wasn't serious at all.
l was just joking.

260
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:55,600
That's surprising...
You have spoilt my two daughters...

261
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,531
Aren't they like my childrentoo?
Anyway, leave allthis aside.

262
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,805
The good news is that
they likedthis mad girl...

263
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:05,046
they have acceptedthe proposal.
- They have accepted?

264
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,111
Didn't they see you properly?

265
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:10,385
Shut up!

266
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,110
So youwill leave us and go...?

267
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,390
Some day allyou girls have to leave.

268
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,792
No way am l leaving
my father and going anywhere.

269
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,061
Even l'm not going.
- So then should l leave?

270
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,795
Why do you speak like this, father?

271
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,191
Some day you have to get married,
my child.

272
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,069
The only prayer
l have to the Lord is that...

273
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:32,401
the man you marry must
love you even more than l do.

274
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:34,075
C'mon...

275
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,635
l don't think such
aman exists inthis world...

276
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:38,079
Am l not there?

277
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,078
You did not eat, dance or eventalk
to anyone at the party tonight.

278
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,350
You didn't eventell me
howbeautiful l looktonight.

279
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,077
You look very beautiful, Naina.

280
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,084
Really? How sweet!

281
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:51,326
l'm sweet and l also lie very well.

282
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:54,325
Just go...
- No.

283
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,299
Hey Naina, you look very beautiful.

284
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,768
Are you lying or tellingthe truth?
- What do youthink?

285
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:02,430
l think...
- What do youthink?

286
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,296
l think Rahul...
- What do youthink?

287
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:06,233
Rahul, l think you should go now.

288
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:08,773
ln any case l wasn't planningto come
with you. But thanks for the offer.

289
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,448
Bye... l was lyingto you.

290
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,725
What's happening, Mom?

291
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:36,063
Nothing much except planning
for Dad's surprise party.

292
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,970
Nothing stays in
this child's stomach.

293
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:43,074
That's because there's already
so much inthere.

294
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,807
Rahul, How come you are
back so early?

295
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,584
Mom... These society parties are
very boring.

296
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:50,884
Really?

297
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,748
lnthat case you have not taken
after your father inthese matters.

298
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,619
He usedto love such parties...

299
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,824
because there usedto be
alot of girls there...

300
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,198
Nandini

301
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,766
He usedto getvery happy
watchingthose girls.

302
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:10,596
Nandiniji...lf l hadn't
watchedthose beautiful girls...

303
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:13,205
how would l have foundyou?
- What didyou do?

304
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,177
Your father brought
Nandini's proposal...

305
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:21,048
When he sawher for the first time
he was very pleased...

306
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,520
And said, he approved of her.

307
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:28,789
But he saidwe would have
to ask for dowry.

308
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,725
He insistedthat the girl should
bring from her parents' house...

309
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:36,223
lots of love and along,
long ladder.

310
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,062
lt's a great tradition.

311
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,598
The elders of the house choose
their daughter-in-law.

312
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,074
One can't trust these mad children.

313
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,574
No, Mataji... Allthat was then.

314
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:54,883
These days everything has changed.
- Nothing has changed, Nandini.

315
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,752
But these days children make
their choices themselves...

316
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,615
Nothing has changed, Nandini.

317
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,756
What l meant was...
- Nothing has changed.

318
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,023
But...
- l said it... didn't l?

319
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,226
That's it!

320
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:23,042
Your beauty is goingto steal
his sleep inthe nights...

321
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:25,207
Shut up!
- You shut up!

322
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,880
Where is your Ashfaque?

323
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:28,614
l haven't even seen him yet.

324
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,852
lntroduce himto me.
Let me see howhe looks.

325
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,849
He is arriving from
Lucknowtoday and...

326
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:35,056
he will come to meetyou
as soon as he comes.

327
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,219
Tell me whatyouthought of him.

328
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,049
Stop this coy bride act now...

329
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:40,861
By the way,
what does he do in Lucknow?

330
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,791
He is apoet.
- A poet?

331
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,861
Then l'll get
alongvery wellwith him.

332
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,727
Really? Why?

333
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,729
That's because l write
abit of poetry myself.

334
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:53,867
A ha... Ustad Anjali Ali Khan.

499
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:45,056
Bauji always says that no one becomes
small by asking for forgiveness.

500
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,661
Andthe one who forgives
owns abig heart...

They were too many of them Didi...
l couldn't do anything.

518
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,458
Here you roam around like a don.

519
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,658
Oh! Didi.
- Oh! Didi.

520
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:56,930
But what was the need for
her to go into the school?

521
00:55:57,198 --> 00:55:58,859
Lord Almighty!
What are you saying?

522
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,862
She just enteredthe school...
not murdered anyone.

523
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:03,999
What was the need for them
to say allthose things?

524
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:06,173
lf l was there l would have caught
each one of them and bashedthem up.

525
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,339
Yes. They have hurt my sister.

526

530
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:22,585
You don't know, Bauji...

Besides, Someone has told me that...

549
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:24,176
apologising doesn't make
anyone smaller.

550
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:28,017
Andthe one who forgives
owns abig heart.

551
00:57:30,224 --> 00:57:31,521

No one loves me

572
00:58:52,873 --> 00:58:55,034

663
01:07:56,082 --> 01:08:02,988
''The colours of our souls
has melted into one''

664
01:08:05,025 --> 01:08:11,988
''l can't say which of me is you
andwhich of you is me''

665
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:20,997
''O beloved, it's the waves
of the your love that drown me''

666
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:27,002
''before transporting me to the shore''

667
01:08:29,049 --> 01:08:34,009
''lt's the thirst of the ocean,
lt's the dream of the night''

668
01:08:34,988 --> 01:08:40,016
''The hearts of the flames
have been set afire''

669
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:46,321
''l stand still
as the earth moves around me''

670
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,028
''the heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper''

671
01:08:53,406 --> 01:08:57,365
''My love, is it the
call of first love?''

672
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:04,983
''My love, is it
the call of first love?''

673
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:11,655
''The sun dims into twilight,
moon beams simmer brightly''

674
01:10:18,091 --> 01:10:20,855
She's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely mad.

675
01:10:21,795 --> 01:10:25,060
She makes strange faces,
she talks alot.

676
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:29,068
And she has some lovable mannerisms.

677
01:10:30,103 --> 01:10:33,072
Andwherever she goes
she breaks a vase apot

678
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:35,474
Pot?
- That's what she calls them.

679
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:39,403
But whenever l'm next to her,
l don't know what happens to me.

680
01:10:42,849 --> 01:10:45,818
But she's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely...

681
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:47,076
Mad.

682
01:10:50,123 --> 01:10:51,886
What's the name
of this mad hatter?

683
01:10:56,129 --> 01:10:57,596
l wantedto know your opinion.

684
01:10:57,797 --> 01:11:01,233
l'm very happy withthis alliance.
Nainais a very nice girl.

685
01:11:01,801 --> 01:11:03,598
Have you spokento Rahul
about this?

686
01:11:03,803 --> 01:11:06,772
What's the needto speakto Rahul?
He can't take these family decisions.

687
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,040
Naina will be the daughter-in-law
of this house... our house!

688
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:18,447
DJ...Who will do all
this for me there?

689
01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:42,074
Dad, Why can't l stay with
all of you here?

690
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,406
Why are you sending me
to the boarding school?

691
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:48,881
Traditions, my child...
traditions...

692
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,544
Your grandfather went there,
l did, so did bhaiyya.

693
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,354
You can't breakthe traditions
of the house, can you?

694
01:11:55,555 --> 01:11:56,522
No...

695
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:11,036
Always remember
one more thing...

696
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,298
Mom loves me more than
she loves you.

697
01:12:34,994 --> 01:12:37,724
You have given me so much already...
l can't take allthese.

698
01:12:37,997 --> 01:12:41,728
Sayeeda... lf Rahul and Rohan

Kurta from Lucknow or apathani salwar

723
01:15:15,922 --> 01:15:17,685
He who gives away his
heart stands for atrue man...

who knows?'

''These lanes of my childhood,

''You can't hide love in disdain...''

''you can't hide love in disdain....''

743
01:18:00,086 --> 01:18:04,147
''A veiled silence speaks
more than athousandwords''

744
01:18:05,024 --> 01:18:08,983
''Words don't always
do justice, my friend''

745

763
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:21,326
Agreed!

764
01:20:40,346 --> 01:20:42,871
Agreed!
- Even l agree.

765
01:20:47,687 --> 01:20:50,349
You love her don'tyou?
- Yes, Papa.

766
01:20:51,457 --> 01:20:53,084
Didn't l tellyou, Nandini?
What did l tellyou?

767
01:20:56,128 --> 01:20:58,096
l'm very happy,
today Rahul...very happy.

768
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:00,832
Just promise me that
youwill keep her happy too.

769
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:01,895
Youwill keep my daughter-in-law
very happy.

770
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:05,035
Youwill keep Naina very happy.

771
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:31,063
You face has fallen as
if we are already married.

772
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:34,763
By the way this expression appears
only after aman gets married.

773
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:41,071
Eh Rahul, What's the matter?

774
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:44,804
What's her name?

775
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:46,638
Naina!

776
01:21:48,013 --> 01:21:50,811
l wishthat was the name.
But it isn't.

777
01:21:55,454 --> 01:21:57,081
Naina... it's just...
- Rahul!

778
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:02,026
Ever since l can remember
l have lovedyou...

779
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:07,025
lovedyouvery much.
But it isn'tyour fault.

780
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:13,937
Just because l dreamt of marryingyou
doesn't mean you have to marry me.

781
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:18,836
And if you are worried
that l will miserable...

782
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,836
yes l will be.

783
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:22,808
l will feelvery bad...
it will hurt

784
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:27,041
alot too.
But life doesn't stop, does it Rahul?

785
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:33,050
Perhaps a few years from now
l can laugh at the fact that...

786
01:22:33,826 --> 01:22:37,785
l loved a certain Rahul
who could not become mine.

787
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:44,730
Because he was never mine!
And my love story remained incomplete.

788
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,070
But do me a favour Rahul.

789
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:56,081
Please complete your love story.

790
01:22:58,184 --> 01:23:00,675
Youwill, won'tyou Rahul?
For my sake.

791
01:23:05,057 --> 01:23:09,016
Now say something quickly
before l cry more.

792
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:12,360
Even me.

793
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:36,050
Raichand.

794
01:23:40,226 --> 01:23:44,322
The name andthe respect has been
givento us by our ancestors.

795
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:52,401
To honour and respect
them is our foremost duty.

796
01:23:54,974 --> 01:24:00,742
And l will never tolerate
an ordinary girl becoming ahurdle...

797
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,014
in performingthat duty.

798
01:24:06,318 --> 01:24:08,809
You didn't eventhink once...

799
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:16,424
about the background of the girl,
her status... her breeding.

800
01:24:18,998 --> 01:24:21,831
You didn't give athought to whether
the girlwill be able to understand...

801
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:23,694
our culture... our traditions.

802
01:24:25,804 --> 01:24:27,863
Willthe girl ever understand
our rituals... our rites?

803
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,835
Willthe girl understand our
ethics and principles?

804
01:24:33,812 --> 01:24:35,712
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

805
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:37,040
Will she...?

806
01:24:39,451 --> 01:24:43,410
How didyou even dare to think
that she can be apart of our family?

807
01:24:45,424 --> 01:24:48,291
That she can be a
part of my family?

808
01:24:51,263 --> 01:24:53,060
How didyouthink?

809
01:24:56,669 --> 01:25:01,003
Where did l think, Papa?
l didn't think at all.

810
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:09,345
l just loved...love.

811
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:12,276
Love?

812
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:24,359
lt's such apity that. l made
amistake in knowing my own son

813
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:30,035
l thought he knewme.

814
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,639
That he understands
the traditions of this family.

815
01:25:35,074 --> 01:25:37,770
He understands my emotions...
he understands every breath of mine.

816
01:25:43,082 --> 01:25:48,714
l was so wrong... so wrong.

817
01:25:55,828 --> 01:25:57,796
l was really proud of you.

818
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,990
Youwere my self-respect.
Youwere my strength.

819
01:26:05,604 --> 01:26:12,009
You have taken allthat away
from me... everything.

820
01:26:17,616 --> 01:26:19,208
You have hurt me,

821
01:26:24,056 --> 01:26:25,819
You have hurt me.

822
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:00,058
l never wantedto hurtyou.

823
01:27:03,362 --> 01:27:05,330
l only wantedto bringyou happiness.

824
01:27:08,033 --> 01:27:10,001
What have l done?

825
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,674
How could l bringtears to your eyes?

826
01:27:17,843 --> 01:27:19,674
How could l bringtears?

827
01:27:22,715 --> 01:27:24,546
Don't ever forgive me.

828
01:27:27,386 --> 01:27:29,820
Please don't say that
l have hurtyou.

829
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:33,754
Don't forgive me.

Willthe girl understand
our ethics and principles?

837

You have lost the right
to call me that!

844

Made me a stranger in amoment.
Made me a stranger in just amoment.

845
01:32:46,438 --> 01:32:48,736
Does that mean l have no
place inthis house anymore?

846
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:48,399

847

Then let me go... Can l go?

01:34:17,062 --> 01:34:19,758
''Through smiles or throughtears''

''We shall never part,
through smiles nor throughtears''

l don't want himto miss the warmth
of amother's affection.

866
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:29,612

01:37:38,396 --> 01:37:43,026
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

870
01:37:44,803 --> 01:37:51,641
Andthen youwill cross allthe hurdles

Victory will be yours.
Only yours.

Silence! Come here.

921
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,828
Haldiram has lost his marbles.

922
01:43:52,203 --> 01:43:55,172
She has gone to London.
Someday even l will go there.

923
01:44:07,218 --> 01:44:08,981
You have just come back, son.
Andyouwant to go away again?

924
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,778
l feel incomplete here, Dad!

925
01:44:11,155 --> 01:44:15,114
Why don'tyou study for MBA here?
There are alot of universities here.

926
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:20,119
Why do youwant to go to London?
-Traditions, Dad... Traditions.

927
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:24,794
Grandfather went there, you did...

928
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:30,402
so did Bhaiyya... So how can l break
the traditions of this house?

929
01:44:48,593 --> 01:44:50,561
So what shall l bring
back for the mother?

930
01:44:52,196 --> 01:44:53,959
What does amother's heartyearn for?

931
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,159
Mother's heart? lt only yearns
for her son's happiness...

932
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:08,502
no matter where he is... no matter
howhe is...just happiness...

933
01:45:20,391 --> 01:45:26,921
And a son's happiness is in
his mother's laughter... her smile...

934
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:31,465
somethingthat he
isn't able to see.

935
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,472
l promise, mother.
The laughter will return...

936
01:45:42,246 --> 01:45:47,843
that smile will return.
lt's a son's promise.

937
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:55,619
And abrother's!

938
01:46:17,348 --> 01:46:21,614
Your heart aches when your dear ones
go far distances, doesn't it?

939
01:46:31,095 --> 01:46:33,325
Andwhen dear ones create distances
in between, it aches even more.

940
01:50:02,073 --> 01:50:05,338
Has your princess woken up?
-Oh yes... Pooja!

941
01:50:06,177 --> 01:50:09,146
No one knows her by that name. Call
her what she is called by everyone...

942
01:50:09,747 --> 01:50:10,873
Poo!

943
01:51:03,437 --> 01:51:07,396
You have no right to
look so beautiful.

944
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:18,018
She has arrived, the cunningvixen,
to drop her daughter.

945
01:51:19,253 --> 01:51:21,721
After seeingyour face inthe morning
how can l call it alovely day?

946
01:51:27,861 --> 01:51:30,227
Liar! Liar! Come here...

947
01:51:35,669 --> 01:51:38,229
Who is it, Anjali?
-Your future daughter-in-law.

948
01:51:38,973 --> 01:51:40,941
Come, let me serve you
some cornflakes.

949
01:52:01,295 --> 01:52:03,593
Anjali... Anjali l needto talkto you.
-What?

950
01:52:04,431 --> 01:52:06,695
This songthatyou sing every morning.
-So?

951
01:52:08,302 --> 01:52:09,860
lt feels very nice.

952
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:15,675
But the neighbours around
were complaining.

953
01:52:16,043 --> 01:52:19,206
l don't sing for them do l? l sing so
that my son learns about our country.

954
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:22,676
Our Krish has learnt everything.
Say thatyou have!

955
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:25,018
Yes... l have learnt everything.
- He has learnt nothing...

956
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:27,550
he knows nothing about our country.
Our religion, our traditions...

957
01:52:27,921 --> 01:52:30,719
our heritage... Move out of my way.
Our country has...

958
01:52:31,125 --> 01:52:33,025
Oh stop it Mummy!
What country? Country!

959
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:36,229
Eh! The country best inthe world
is our lndia... don't ever forget!

960
01:52:39,967 --> 01:52:43,027
OK... l won't say anything.
He's already half an Englishman...

961
01:52:43,404 --> 01:52:45,634
when he turns a full one
don't complainto me.

962
01:52:48,042 --> 01:52:52,570
Yes... become just like her!
How do they say it? How do they talk?

963
01:53:07,795 --> 01:53:09,922
Wouldn't it have been better
to have lived in Chandni Chowk?

964
01:53:26,246 --> 01:53:28,510
Let me knot it for you, Jeej!
-Aaaah!

965
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:34,709
What happened?
-What kind of clothes have youworn?

966
01:53:35,255 --> 01:53:37,223
lt's become too long hasn't it?

967
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:41,420
What now?

968
01:53:44,998 --> 01:53:46,556
Where's the back?

969
01:53:47,434 --> 01:53:49,368
Didi, don't wait for me.

970
01:53:58,078 --> 01:54:00,410
Anjali, Daijaan, come here.

971
01:54:00,781 --> 01:54:03,909
How do you allow Poojato
go out wearing such little clothes?

972
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:26,302
By the way eventhe two of you

Poo...the whole college
runs after Robbie.

976
01:55:47,054 --> 01:55:48,749
He's not my type!

977
01:55:49,256 --> 01:55:52,225
Who is your type?
Andwhen willyou meet him?

978
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:56,226
He might meet me anywhere... anytime.

979
01:55:59,967 --> 01:56:02,231
He could be right here somewhere.

980
01:56:05,005 --> 01:56:08,031
Oh God!Who is this... disturbing
Poo so early inthe morning!

981
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:43,300
Who is this who hasn't turnedto

982
01:57:34,728 --> 01:57:37,390
''He's so cute, he's so sweet''

983
01:57:39,232 --> 01:57:42,258
''Got to be careful,

984
01:57:48,642 --> 01:57:51,372
''He's so cute, he's so sweet''

998
01:59:30,043 --> 01:59:33,171
''O lord, l don't knowhow?

999
01:59:34,481 --> 01:59:38,178
''My heart is beating faster?''

1000
01:59:39,319 --> 01:59:42,379
''He's so cute, he's so sweet''

1001
01:59:44,024 --> 01:59:46,993
''Got to be careful
of falling in love''

1002
01:59:48,929 --> 01:59:52,763
''lf l make him mine,

''l'd give it all up for one moment''

1009
02:01:08,808 --> 02:01:11,208
''Just one moment with her''

1010
02:01:13,346 --> 02:01:17,339
''For years there has been a face

1011
02:01:18,185 --> 02:01:21,780
''May be even she is waiting for me?''

1012

''lf l make her mine,

1017
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:49,376
''Wonder why l feelthis way?''

1018
02:02:39,399 --> 02:02:41,390
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on amoonlit night in Chandni Chowk...

1019
02:02:41,601 --> 02:02:43,398
in a silver spoon,
some Chatni...

1020
02:02:46,006 --> 02:02:46,973
some chatni.

1021
02:03:04,491 --> 02:03:08,587
Do you know Rohan, Didi always says
that amarriedwoman is the union of...

1022
02:03:08,962 --> 02:03:10,691
a wife and a daughter-in-law.

1023
02:03:11,698 --> 02:03:15,930
She is a goodwife, but she hasn't
managedto be an ideal daughter-in-law

1024
02:03:17,937 --> 02:03:21,202
Andyour brother?
Not a day passes...

1025
02:03:21,975 --> 02:03:24,205
not amoment passes when he
doesn't remember his parents.

1026
02:03:25,412 --> 02:03:29,542
But he never says anything. He has
put up their photograph inthe house.

1027
02:03:30,984 --> 02:03:33,009
But not once has he
turnedtowards it.

1028
02:03:35,255 --> 02:03:38,224
We have made a smallworld for
ourselves here, Rohan.

1029
02:03:39,259 --> 02:03:42,228
lf you look from afar
it's filledwith happiness...

1030
02:03:43,997 --> 02:03:47,524
but the closer you go,
youwill find alot of sorrow.

1031
02:03:51,371 --> 02:03:55,239
Why have you come, Rohan?
Why now?

1032
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:06,713
l had promised bhaiyyathat l will
never ask where he went or why he went

1033
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:14,317
But today l have realisedthat
he doesn't think of us as his own.

1034
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:20,859
That is apain l can't bear...
can't bear.

1035
02:04:22,369 --> 02:04:24,530
l have left some broken
bonds back home, Pooja

1036
02:04:26,706 --> 02:04:29,197
that can only attainthe status
of a family through my elder brother.

1037
02:04:32,245 --> 02:04:38,013
l have come to take my brother back...
take my sister-in-lawback...

1038
02:04:41,254 --> 02:04:43,222
But l can't do this on my own.

1039
02:04:46,059 --> 02:04:47,890
l will needyour support Pooja.

1040
02:04:51,264 --> 02:04:54,233
Willyou support me?

1041
02:05:01,207 --> 02:05:06,577
No... No... never!
-He is Sonia's brother.

1042
02:05:07,013 --> 02:05:09,413
He's not my brother... And l didn't
even knowthat Soniahad abrother.

1043
02:05:09,783 --> 02:05:11,683
So Sonia, when was this
brother of yours born?

1044
02:05:11,918 --> 02:05:13,510

l mean first cousin.
He can't stay with me...

1047
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:36,200
lt's only amatter of few days.
At least meet him once.

1048
02:05:38,978 --> 02:05:40,946
My house isn't a charitable institution
that anyone can stay here.

1049
02:05:41,247 --> 02:05:43,215
Daijaan, please explainto her...

Allthe mad people from Chandni Chowk
have moved in here.

1058
02:06:09,943 --> 02:06:14,403
Didi, Sonia's brother has just

02:06:19,919 --> 02:06:21,978
