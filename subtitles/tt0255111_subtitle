1
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,449
Dev, where are you?.

2
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,060
Okay, so you're hiding somewhere...

3
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,050
All right. If you don't
come out this very instant..

4
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,210
Then l will leave right now.

5
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,949
Anjali, stop!

6
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,039
Don't go.

7
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,990
Don't go.

8
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,440
Why should l stay? Is it decent
to hide and trouble somebody?

9
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,339
No but is it decent to...

10
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,240
make somebody wait for so long?

11
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,349
No. But l could have some problems.

12
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,240
But why would you
understand my problems?

13
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,829
The princess of the
castle has problems?

14
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,450
That's in the fate of men
like me who live in streets.

15
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,950
There you go again!
Always crying on your fate!

16
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,930
Do you know fate cries for the
people who cry on their fate.

17
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,690
My fate can't make me cry.

18
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,729
Your love is with me.

19
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:10,930
That's the only problem.

20
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,779
l mean...

21
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,240
My marriage has been fixed.

22
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,050
What??What are you saying?

23
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,120
My father has fixed my marriage.
They are very wealthy people.

24
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,690
Land, property,wealth..
They have it all.

25
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,630
Papa has found me a real prince.

26
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,729
Then what are you
doing with this beggar?

27
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,269
l came to tell you my decision.

28
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,420
This might be our last meeting.

29
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,420
We can't meet after today.

30
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,990
l'm going.

31
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,990
Where are you going?

32
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:12,849
What's wrong?.

33
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,019
You got scared?
YOU got scared???

34
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,779
You did get scared!

35
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,920
Why are you laughing?

36
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,889
Because l was joking!

37
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,599
l don't like these pranks.

38
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,659
l see. Then what kind
of joke would you prefer?

39
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,360
Play any prank on me but never
fool about us being separated.

40
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:45,599
See...hear my heart beating.

41
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,510
You take everything so seriously.

42
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,089
lf this turns true someday..?

43
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,969
- l'll ruin them!
-Whom? Me..?

44
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,839
No. l won't let you be harmed.

45
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,029
l'll die myself.

46
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,789
You talk of love and death
in the same breath.

47
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,029
Doesn't sound credible.

48
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,560
Who the hell wants to die!

49
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,599
Who the hell wants to die!

50
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,269
And if l do die Anjali..
If l do die, madam...

51
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,300
l will always beat in your heart.

52
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,579
Like your heart beat.

53
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,550
Do you love me so much?

54
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,849
Why are you asking me?
Ask your heartbeat.

55
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,620
And what will every
heartbeat of yours say?

56
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,110
What will it say?

57
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:50,029
''You live in every beat of my heart.''

58
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:59,920
''Yes,you do.''

59
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,019
''You live in every beat of my hearrt.''

60
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:42,749
''You tell every breathe
of mine,yes you do...''

61
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,050
''Come into my arms.''

62
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,969
''Let's get lost in a land of dreams.''

63
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,109
Dev,you say you love me alot.

64
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,280
How much do you love me? Tell me.

65
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:29,790
''l have turned cray forher.
l am so in love with her.''

66
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,770
''She took her time
to come close to me.''

67
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,310
''Silently we are in love.''

68
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,770
''Now we don't have to bar anyone.''

69
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:56,060
''We will live and die together.''

70
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,040
''Don't love me so much.''

71
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:17,270
You will torment and
undergo unnecessary pain.

72
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:21,499
What is special about me?
What is it about me?

73
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,959
''The world has shunned me.''

74
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,200
''But you accepted me''

75
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:48,459
''The heart found peace with you.
The others only tormented me.''

76
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,469
''We have only one dream.''

77
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,869
''Only you should belong to me.''

78
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,829
Will only speak?
Won't you say a word?

79
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,030
Like it? Yes?

80
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:03,119
Really?

81
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,920
''Come into my arms.''

82
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,570
''Take me to the world of dreams.''

83
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,149
That's enough. Now
stop singing my praise.

84
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,229
''You live in my heart. Only you.''

85
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,800
See you at 12 sharp tomorrow.
This time don't make me wait.

86
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,050
Will you send me off
from the door today too?

87
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,609
Won't you introduce me to mother?.

88
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,350
l will...later.

89
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,649
No. l will meet her today itself.

90
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,249
Do you insist?

91
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,779
Absolutely.

92
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,259
Come on.

93
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,540
- Really?
- Come on.

94
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,720
Take a look, madam.
This is my house.

95
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,850
lt is smaller than your car.

96
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,019
How does the size of the house matter?

97
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,560
The heart should have place.

98
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,359
ls that so?

99
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
That's the door.
Go and see her.

100
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:59,739
But where are you going?

101
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:02,600
Go and meet her.

102
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:32,749
''You will stay with me, my son.''

103
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,550
''So that you can see...''

104
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:46,249
''How many be trampled
on this mother's heart.''

105
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,290
''How many daggers
stabbed my eyes and ears.''

106
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,239
''You will stay with me, my baby.''

107
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,499
Mother...

108
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,590
Who..?

109
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:11,109
Mother, l...

110
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:13,739
l...

111
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:20,570
Who are you?

112
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,050
Mother, l... Dev..

113
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,139
Just a minute...okay?
l will tell you.

114
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,979
Why are you standing here?
Come right in.

115
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,800
Come in.

116
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,180
Yes, sit here.

117
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,840
Why are you sitting so far?
Come close to me.

118
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,759
You are so pretty!

119
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,719
Not as pretty as you.

120
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,159
But how did you recognize me so fast?

121
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,500
Wouldn't l recognize you?
l always see you in Dev's eyes.

122
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,629
Has Dev told you everything about me?

123
00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:24,570
He doesn't talk to me.

124
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,699
He hardly talks to anyone but you.

125
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,740
But l am a mother.

126
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,659
l know every heartbeat of my child.

127
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,679
And every beat of this heart
resounds with just one name.

128
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,050
Where has Dev gone?

129
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,149
lsn't he strange?
He sent me alone to meet you.

130
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,169
He is always in a temper.
Why is he always angry?

131
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,240
He is mad at me.

132
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,929
Angry with you?why?

133
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,619
l won't keep anything from you.

134
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,580
And l shouldn't hide
anything from you.

135
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:19,760
Life long relations can't
be based on buried secrets.

136
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:28,000
l'm an unwed mother.

137
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,010
And this stigma of my life...

138
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,600
is a permanent wound for my child.

139
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:41,790
He doesn't say anything.

140
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,080
But this wound is hurting him.

141
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:51,649
l am not ashamed at what l did.

142
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,389
l had only fallen in love.

143
00:18:57,699 --> 00:19:00,980
But what happened was that...
somebody deceived somebody.

144
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,159
And somebody else got punished.

145
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:11,899
Do you know...the world
considers my child illegitimate?

146
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,850
And now his own heart
calls him illegitimate.

147
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,459
How do l explain to him..

148
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,780
Love is never illegitimate.

149
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,419
Maybe you...can explain this to him..

150
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,439
Heal every wound of his.

151
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,000
Erase the stigma.

152
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,439
Give me your word...

153
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,449
You will always stand by him..

154
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,149
Make me a promise..

155
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,250
Promise me...

156
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,100
Yes mother, l promise
to always stand by Dev.

157
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,500
l will never leave him alone.

158
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,909
l promise you.

159
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,139
How do l tell you how
well they looked after me?

160
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,070
l told them l'd eaten
yet they insisted..

161
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:44,330
You're back early from London.

162
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,250
- l even went to Delhi.
- Delhi?

163
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:50,159
Why didn't you call? l'd have
come to the airport to pick you up.

164
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:53,490
As if you have the time.
Where have you been since morning?

165
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,619
Mom doesn't trust her daughter at all.

166
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,510
Whether Mom does or not
Papa trusts you.

167
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,510
Now l want to knowhow
much my daughter trusts me.

168
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,629
- Any doubts?
- No. Not at all.

169
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,510
That is why l took a major decision
for you without your permission.

170
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,550
-What decision?
- Shall l tell..?

171
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:19,359
- Yes,tell her.
- Do you know why l went to Delhi?

172
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,090
-Why?
- To fix your marriage.

173
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,679
- My marriage..?
- Yes.

174
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,419
- Your marriage!
- l am very happy!

175
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,689
- l'm so excited!
- She's being shy.

176
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,689
The boy is terrific!

177
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,350
He's handsome, idealistic
and from a good family.

178
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,260
l can't marry him.

179
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,270
Why not, my dear?

180
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,709
Because l gave my word to somebody.

181
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,409
Who is he?

182
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,189
Who is he?

183
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,540
Why are you laughing like a maniac?

184
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,050
l'm not joking. It's the truth!

185
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,340
l've told Papa everything
and he wants to meet you today!

186
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,679
And do you know what your
Papa will do on meeting me?

187
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,939
-What?
- Kick me out of his palace.

188
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,270
My father is not a brute!

189
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,770
And you don't come
home like a boor!

190
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,570
Wear clean clothes, shave
and don't wear this slipper!

191
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:29,340
And zip up your lips!

192
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:32,780
And then ask Papa for
my hand with humility.

193
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:37,080
Why?Why should l ask
somebody for you?

194
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,109
l can take you away
whenever l want!

195
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,530
l'm not coming anywhere with you.

196
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,490
You will have to come home
and actually ask for my hand.

197
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,409
Now l am getting late.
Be punctual.

198
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:54,399
Be there by. Don't be late.

199
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,919
Or Papa will be very angry.

200
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,359
Papa will be really angry.

201
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,590
Be in time or time
will leave you behind.

202
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,070
The heart desires to risk its' life.

203
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:12,060
Lets see how powerful the enemy is.

204
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,060
Why is everyone standing?
Son,take a seat.

205
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,899
Come...sit here.

206
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,010
You're probably looking at my slipper.

207
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,270
lt has a hole which
you probably can't see.

208
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,740
The poor thing got worn out
because l walk alot.

209
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,830
Anjali wanted me to come
before you in clean clothes.

210
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,280
Clean-shaven zipped up lips.

211
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,040
Or what would you think of me?

212
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,570
What will you think?

213
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:40,330
l am what l am.

214
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,750
By the way,what are you?

215
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:45,459
Nothing special.

216
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,800
An ordinary man.

217
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:51,379
Who madly loves your daughter.

218
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,289
The one whom your daughter loves
doesn't remain ordinary anymore.

219
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:02,340
l have nothing.

220
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:04,580
No wealth or property or family.

221
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,709
l possess only one thing.

222
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,539
...which is presently with you.

223
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:14,789
l come to ask you for it.

224
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,469
And if l don't give it?

225
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,319
l will snatch it away!

226
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,700
When l first set eyes on you,
l thought you were arrogant.

227
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,360
But now l realize you're
not only arrogant...

228
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,190
You're also impudent and illiterate!

229
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,289
Who knows neither his
past nor his future!

230
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,959
This...is this your choice?

231
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,819
A man who can't provide!

232
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,590
Who will look towards your
father to bed you and himself!

233
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,900
This is his status!

234
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,410
And what is your status?

235
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:12,580
You have wealth!

236
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,479
You have affluence so
you raise your status!

237
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,309
Take my advice...

238
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,729
Wealth is accumulated by the
wealth of love that l possess.

239
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,370
Now tell me whose status
is higher. Yours or mine?

240
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:35,620
Who is poor? Me or you?

241
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:41,100
Who is richer? You or me?.

242
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,900
Dev, come on.

243
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,469
What have you done!!

244
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,519
Your father will never accept me.

245
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,590
- Let's elope.
- No!-Why?

246
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,830
l'll come and meet you later.
But at this moment,you must go.

247
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,580
- Promise?
- Yes. But go for now!

248
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:09,190
_ It's a promise?.
-Yes,l will come.

249
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,989
Shocked at seeing this
pistol in my hands?

250
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,789
Don't worry. It's not pointed at you.

251
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,509
lt can never be so.

252
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,390
A gun is extreme..

253
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,049
To date, l've never even
pointed a finger at you.

254
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,809
There might not be parents in the
world wanting to hurt their kids.

255
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,590
But there are innumerable kids...

256
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,319
...who bitterly wound their
parents without batting an eyelid!

257
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,430
Like you want to do today.

258
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,860
Do you know when you were born..

259
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,110
Your mother had some problems.

260
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,979
The doctor told me, Chauhan
you won't have another child.

261
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,759
At that point,this mother
of yours had cried alot.

262
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,160
She was disheartened
because she wanted a son.

263
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,840
Then l talked and convinced her..

264
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:58,380
The love, honor, affection
that a daughter can give..

265
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:01,870
A son can never give that.

266
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,059
But l had forgotten this...

267
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:12,610
The shame and humiliation
a daughter can give...

268
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:16,219
A son never gives that either.

269
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,940
The reputation that we worked
hard for years to build...

270
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,900
...which is dearer to me than life...

271
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,880
lf you wish to crush it afoot
and leave,you may do so.

272
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:41,120
For a momentary dream?.

273
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,249
You believe in that
momentary dream...

274
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,249
But you don't trust the
vision of your parents!

275
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,170
Look, l'm not one of those fathers...

276
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,289
l won't drag you in and
Iock you in this palace!

277
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,940
But if you want to fulfill
this selfish dream of yours...

278
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,739
You will have to go over my dead body!

279
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,600
Do one thing...take this.

280
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,420
Hold this pistol and empty the
bullets in your father's chest!

281
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,670
You will be free. Kill me.

282
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,920
Forgive me, Papa.

283
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,059
l don't want this freedom.

284
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,239
l can't be happy after hurting you.

285
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,660
l will do as you say.

286
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,380
l will mary the man you choose.

287
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:50,549
But don't stop me now.

288
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,170
He is waiting for me.

289
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,410
l promised him that l'd come.

290
00:30:57,749 --> 00:30:59,860
Let me keep this one promise of mine.

291
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,170
Just this one promise..?

292
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,430
Let her go.

293
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:09,489
l have full faith in my daughter.

294
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:14,200
She will not do anything
to bring us shame.

295
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:16,999
Let her go.

296
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,150
l will honor your promise.

297
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,330
l will take you
wherever you want to go.

298
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,170
''Please come by...''

299
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,950
''The world scorned me.''

300
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,839
''Only you accepted me.''

301
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,119
''The heart is so relieved.''

302
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,569
''Everyone hurt me so much.''

303
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,009
''l have but one dream.''

304
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,079
''l want only you.''

305
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,269
l knew you'd come.

306
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,869
l knew you'd leave your
Pop's house and come for me!

307
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,509
l knew you'd come!

308
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,130
You misunderstand..

309
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:54,200
l've come to leave you.
l haven't left my father.

310
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:58,000
Joking again?

311
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,440
l'm not joking.

312
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:04,450
l'm obeying Papa.

313
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,970
l will marry the man he chooses.

314
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,450
What about the promise you made to me?

315
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,339
My parents came into
my life before you.

316
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,309
l made them a promise
much before you.

317
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:36,329
The promise every girl
makes when she's born!

318
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:40,079
l will keep that word.

319
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,220
l will obey them.

320
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,440
Did you ask your parents
before falling in love?

321
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,410
How selfish you are!

322
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,220
Curse me. Say whatever you wish.

323
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,849
But now l will walk on the
path they choose for me.

324
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,150
Even if l have to die on the path!

325
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:09,139
Then you could've strangled yourself!

326
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,280
You shouldn't have been unfaithful.

327
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,159
lf l wasn't aware of
the shame of my parents...

328
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,179
l would have even done that.

329
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,230
But l must live.

330
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,329
l will die yet live!

331
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,039
You will live.

332
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,190
But l will die.

333
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,639
l can't live without you.

334
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,380
l can't live!

335
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,519
Think of what will
happen to me without you!

336
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,349
You can't do this.

337
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,719
You can't!

338
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,340
life doesn't end when
a relationship ends.

339
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:53,130
Proceed ahead and
make a new world.

340
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:56,250
Without you..?

341
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:58,329
Yes. Without me.

342
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,260
Better than me.

343
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,530
So you have made up your mind?

344
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,699
You will ruin me!

345
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:11,130
Then hear me out too!
l won't easily let you leave!

346
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,710
l'll burn down this world!

347
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:15,769
You won't do any such thing!

348
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,710
You won't insult our friendship.

349
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,969
You won't humiliate me or
my parents! Promise me this!

350
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,250
lt would be best if we don't
make any promises to each other.

351
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,309
Yes, Dev. Now it's better
l don't ask for any promise.

352
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,269
Shall l make a move?

353
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,840
l am leaving.

354
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,380
Listen..!

355
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,429
You're breaking the
promise made to me.

356
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,260
But you had made a
promise to my mother.

357
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,619
What should l tell her?

358
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,510
Tell mother,to keep one promise..

359
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,420
l broke a mothers' heart.

360
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,610
She's a mother.
She will understand.

361
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,900
Son, is that you?

362
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,920
You're very late.

363
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,699
lt's all His game.

364
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,760
All because of Him.

365
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,420
l got late today.

366
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,960
You are drunk?

367
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:13,630
Yes, l consumed liquor!

368
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,260
l am drunk!

369
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,469
l am intoxicated.

370
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:30,920
No,your eyes don't seem inebriated.

371
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,989
lt's something else.

372
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:38,869
What is it?

373
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,699
-What's the matter?
- l left her.

374
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,090
l broke her heart.

375
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,099
l'll never meet her again!

376
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,280
l'll never meet her!

377
00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:59,179
l will never meet that Anjali!

378
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:03,300
You are lying.
You can't do this.

379
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,110
You are my son.

380
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,590
You can't break anybody's heart.

381
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
You are Iying, aren't you?.

382
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,340
Yes mother.

383
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:23,159
l am lying.

384
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,010
l am your son.

385
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,610
How can l break somebody's heart?

386
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,019
How can l leave anyone?

387
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,619
She left me.

388
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,650
And when l told her
she had made you a promise..

389
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:52,449
What will l answer mother?

390
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,519
Do you know what the
unfaithful woman said?

391
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,900
Do you know what the
unfaithful woman said?

392
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,619
She said, mother would understand!

393
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,710
You can understand!

394
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,750
Can you understand?

395
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,760
You can understand.

396
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,159
Mother...

397
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:21,530
Mother?

398
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:53,030
''The music of the
wedding band says...''

399
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:01,010
''The auspicious moment
of happiness is here.''

400
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,239
''Adorned in the red garb..''

401
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:09,099
''A radiant bride..''

402
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:18,150
''A fairy has landed on earth.''

403
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:46,480
"A radian bride..."

404
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,030
''The groom looks lovely.''

405
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,389
''The bride looks like
she's falling in love.''

406
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:29,789
''Relations change in a moment.''

407
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,760
''Now everybody feels like a stranger.''

408
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,119
''This bond of all lives to
come tied around the holy fire.''

409
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,409
''God has bound them together in love.''

410
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,889
''New promises to be made and kept,
new traditions and problems.''

411
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,329
''The lips are silent
but the heart cries out.''

412
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:56,780
''The beat of the heart..''

413
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,030
''The beat of my heart.''

414
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,070
''The beat of your heart.''

415
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,519
''The beat of my heart.''

416
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:32,969
''lt's difficult to hide your tears.''

417
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,130
''The bride's heart seems cray.''

418
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,980
''l grew up in your
arms, my father.''

419
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,110
''But now it's time
to leave your home.''

420
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:18,750
''l'm leaving your home, my father.''

421
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,179
''l will miss the beautiful
moments we shared together.''

422
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,510
''l will never ever forget you.''

423
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:37,099
''lt is difficult to tear tear oneself away.''

424
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,799
Funny. Babban still
hasn't come with the car.

425
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:46,040
He's a Nawab and Nawabs
always move at their own pace.

426
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:50,160
l don't understand why you've
pampered a driver so much!

427
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,700
Delhi has no dearth of servants.

428
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,819
Yes,there is no dearth
of servants in this city.

429
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:01,649
But there's a paucity of loyalists.

430
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:06,000
Anyway Babban is a servant of
the house. Part of the family.

431
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:11,529
You are right. Hear that Bobby?
Your brother talks so well.

432
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,989
Live long, son. Daughter-in-law..

433
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:21,069
Babban and his family have
been our servants for generations.

434
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,689
Thank God, he's finally here.

435
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:30,040
Brother!

436
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:34,230
God bless you!

437
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:37,739
The new bride! Hello.

438
00:48:41,879 --> 00:48:43,109
Congratulations.

439
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,060
What English!

440
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:52,939
- His abuses too sounds like pearls!
- Shut up!

441
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,069
- Sorry.
- You talk alot.

442
00:48:58,399 --> 00:48:59,629
Made us wait for so long in this heat.

443
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:02,359
l have to stop at the corner.

444
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:05,799
- Yes mother?- Bring the
bride in this dressed up car.

445
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,549
We'll go in the BMW.

446
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,370
Come along.

447
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,560
Where are you lost? Come along.

448
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:00,939
Brother...

449
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:03,759
Sister-in-law...

450
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:07,200
ln relation we're
brother's step siblings.

451
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,759
But brother loves us
more than real siblings.

452
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,939
- Isn't it?
- l don't just love you...

453
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,270
l worship you.

454
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,100
Mother's command is
akin to God's word.

455
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,250
How obedient my son is!

456
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,140
Son, now that your bride is home..

457
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:31,339
She will rule the house.

458
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:35,960
No, mother. You've run this
house and you will continue.

459
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,560
Come on, bride.
Now you may enter.

460
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,850
Come along sister-in-law.

461
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:54,620
Show sister-in-law her place..
l mean her room.

462
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,549
lt's going to rain. You'll
get wet if you stand here.

463
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,270
Rain or storm, nothing scares me.

464
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:59,580
You said nothing scares you.

465
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,149
The sound of lightning
sometimes frightens me.

466
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,460
What else frightens you?

467
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,020
Tell me. Go ahead.

468
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,339
l said, nothing scares me.

469
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,029
l'm a girl of today.

470
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:20,759
And l'm of the old era.

471
00:52:21,799 --> 00:52:25,960
Now tell me, how will the
19th century meet the 21st?

472
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,890
Take your hand away.

473
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:35,049
Take your hand away.

474
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,520
There's no need to forge relations!

475
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:42,469
l don't want thereto be
any relation between us!

476
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:49,930
ls this how the girls of the 21st
century act on their nuptial nights?

477
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,830
This is not mere talk. Look...

478
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,540
l won't tolerate any coercion!

479
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,460
How did you assume l'd
force you into anything?

480
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:04,890
Just one thing.
You're being so mean to me.

481
00:53:05,879 --> 00:53:07,549
At least tell me
what my fault is.

482
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,299
Do you know l..

483
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:13,149
l didn't want to get married!

484
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:17,029
l see. Then what did you want to do?

485
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,859
l'd do anything else but
not let my dreams be crushed.

486
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,600
l won't let your dreams be crushed.

487
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,350
Look at me.

488
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:35,969
lf not as spouses,we can
at least live like friends.

489
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,500
And the first rule of
friendship is equal rights.

490
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:45,020
l won't do anything in this
house which you don't approve.

491
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,540
Neither should you do
anything that will hurt me.

492
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:52,950
Gradually you will know
me and l'll understand you.

493
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,279
ln this manner,your 21st
century ideas won't be hurt.

494
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,430
And my emotions of the
19th century will be intact.

495
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,419
Right, isn't it?.

496
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,910
As regards tonight or
the coming nights...

497
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:10,680
l could have slept elsewhere.

498
00:54:13,009 --> 00:54:14,680
But that would hurt my family.

499
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:18,390
You will have to trust me.

500
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:20,450
l'll sleep close by.

501
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,529
You too can sleep here.

502
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,890
''Hail Lord of the universe.''

503
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,330
''You wipe away the difficulties
of your devotees in a flash.''

504
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,180
Who is singing?

505
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:29,999
lt's the master. The morning
begins with his prayers.

506
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:39,089
''Erase evil in mankind.
Eliminate sin from the world.''

507
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:51,249
''Proliferate devotion,
propagate sanctity.

508
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,640
''Serve the good.''

509
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:09,780
Why are you standing out? Come in.

510
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,080
No, l'm fine right here.

511
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:20,510
This is the house of God.
One doesn't stand out.

512
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,499
Come in and bow your head.

513
00:56:24,129 --> 00:56:26,089
Come in, Anjali.

514
00:56:36,169 --> 00:56:37,399
Do you believe in Him?

515
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,649
Don't you?.

516
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,729
- No.
- You don't trust God?

517
00:56:48,189 --> 00:56:52,060
No. Human beings are just puppets.

518
00:56:54,189 --> 00:56:58,499
He has the strings.
He can play with us anytime.

519
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,310
And we keep dancing.

520
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:06,330
No, He is our parent.

521
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,080
And parents don't play
games with their children.

522
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,350
Even if the children are ungrateful.

523
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:16,439
God doesn't turn away
from His children.

524
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:21,359
lt would be better if you
wouldn't give me false assurances.

525
00:57:23,249 --> 00:57:24,450
Listen...

526
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,930
You get angry very fast.

527
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,680
Shall l say something?

528
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,839
Do as l say when you get very angry.

529
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,970
Shut your eyes,take a deep breath...

530
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,769
Say OM,thrice.

531
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:47,260
Take the Lord's name.
The anger will evaporate.

532
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,560
And why aren't you wearing vermiIion?

533
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:25,339
Why aren't you ready as yet?

534
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,629
He must be on his way.

535
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:30,700
Whether he comes or goes..

536
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:33,760
l'm not his slave.

537
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,620
Brother,we are his slaves.

538
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:40,260
Don't forget he still owns 75% shares.

539
00:58:41,399 --> 00:58:44,240
And we have a measly 25%

540
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:46,580
A quarter share.

541
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:50,959
Father has been terribly unjust to us.

542
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:54,459
-Again you're criticizing...
- Bob, why aren't you ready?

543
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,769
We must know everything about
the property discussions.

544
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,189
That's fine, dear sis.

545
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,300
But is it essential to lick
Ram's shoes all the time?

546
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:09,930
He is a smart man who
bends with the wind.

547
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:13,459
And can bend the enemy
when the wind changes.

548
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,439
When will our time come?

549
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:18,439
Patience, my darling.

550
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,340
Daughter-in-law.

551
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,570
- Darling bride..
- Yes..?

552
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:28,189
Come here.

553
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,260
Lovely...

554
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,130
l love the wet tresses
of a newly wedded bride.

555
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,050
Her state in the morning
tells of the night she spent.

556
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,189
- Pardon..?
-What a pretty sari!

557
00:59:52,169 --> 00:59:54,189
And the edging is so lovely!

558
00:59:55,169 --> 00:59:57,720
One must appreciate the
taste of your parents.

559
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,200
You've brought so many
saris and ornaments.

560
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,349
Why don't you let
me keep the ornaments?

561
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,849
You can ask me for them when
you need them. l'll give them.

562
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,209
But why should l give you my jewelry?

563
01:00:12,189 --> 01:00:14,150
l know how to look after my things.

564
01:00:15,189 --> 01:00:17,300
You're a bride of the new generation.

565
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:22,249
By the way l run
this house by my rules.

566
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,519
No, l make my own rules.
Nobody else.

567
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,700
She even has a tongue.

568
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:41,269
What?What did you say?

569
01:00:42,249 --> 01:00:43,329
What did you call me?

570
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,400
l said...

571
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,930
what can l say, my dear?

572
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,249
-What can l say?-What?
- l'm just a mother!

573
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,470
And the accusation
that l'm a step mother!

574
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:05,439
l wish l'd died before being
spoken to in that loud voice!

575
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:08,010
What happened mother?

576
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,689
l'm the guard of this house.

577
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,220
l asked your bride to give me
her jewelry for safe keeping.

578
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,869
ln case of some accident
can't trust the servants.

579
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,639
l had just given this advice
that she lost her temper.

580
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,789
My own children never
spoke to me so loudly!

581
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:31,809
Was l speaking loudly or
were both of you abusing me?

582
01:01:33,369 --> 01:01:34,510
Why are you acting?

583
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:37,800
Enough. Apologize to mother.

584
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:41,880
- You don't know anything and..
- l asked you to apologize to her.

585
01:01:56,389 --> 01:01:59,820
l had warned you l won't
tolerate any kind of coercion!

586
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,380
Mother has only asked for the
ornaments. Give them to her.

587
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,939
Never! Why should l give her?
My parents gave them to me!

588
01:02:08,439 --> 01:02:11,840
lt's not an issue of jewelry!
It's of ordering me for no reason!

589
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,910
l'm saying the same thing. It's
not jewelry but respecting elders.

590
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,119
l'll get you many more ornaments.

591
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,760
Mother has given an order.
It should be obeyed.

592
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:25,919
Give them to her.

593
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,169
l won't do any such thing!

594
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:33,010
Right now you're very angry.
When you calm down..

595
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,599
l am confident that you will
do what is true and right.

596
01:02:38,499 --> 01:02:39,990
l have full faith on you.

597
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,470
Look...l won't do any such thing!

598
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:00,070
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

599
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,939
l'm going home!

600
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,260
But this is your home.

601
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,599
- This is not my home!
-What are you saying?

602
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:09,900
You got taken in by them.

603
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,240
They want you to split.

604
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,530
-What?
- Yes, come with me.

605
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:30,260
You deserve the best actress award!

606
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:34,260
How you fooled that Ram!

607
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:40,599
But did you notice the gall of
that girl? Arguing with me!

608
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,630
She's quite something.

609
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,189
She has neither apologized to
you nor brought the ornaments.

610
01:03:48,139 --> 01:03:50,039
The ornaments will come.
You just watch.

611
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,990
Has it ever happened that l give
an order to Ram and he disobeys?

612
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,990
He has no idea of how
much we all hate him!

613
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:06,740
Really, he's such a fool!

614
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,059
How we fooled him!

615
01:04:21,709 --> 01:04:22,939
Let him come!

616
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,389
So you haven't given
the ornaments as yet.

617
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:44,729
Mother's order hasn't been obeyed.

618
01:04:46,729 --> 01:04:47,959
Mother..?

619
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:55,169
Mother, sister, brother...

620
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,300
You love them alot.

621
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,510
You worship them.

622
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,150
You trust them alot.

623
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:11,090
But have you given a thought
to what they think of you?

624
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:15,459
What they have in their heart for you.

625
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,939
What?

626
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,229
Do you have the courage to hear it?

627
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:25,220
Then hear this.

628
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,680
They hate you. Hate.

629
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,800
They laugh behind your back!

630
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,220
They think you're a fool!

631
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:42,280
Do you know this?

632
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:45,079
Yes, l know.

633
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:47,939
l know everything.

634
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:49,999
l know it all.

635
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,169
Yet l love them crazily.

636
01:05:55,569 --> 01:05:56,650
Do you know why?

637
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,150
Because hatred can only
be won over by love.

638
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,020
Only with love.

639
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:08,739
l want to give them all so much love..

640
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,080
So everyone is forced to love me.

641
01:06:15,949 --> 01:06:19,080
These are my principles.
This is my belief.

642
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:23,779
Only goodness can destroy evil.

643
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,819
You can annihilate
evil by righteousness.

644
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:32,630
You can replace the envy
in a heart with peace.

645
01:06:35,069 --> 01:06:36,360
We live with humans.

646
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:40,230
We can only live as humans.
Not as beasts.

647
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:43,350
Do as l say.

648
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,270
Go and give the ornaments to mother.

649
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:51,880
You don't lose honor
by giving respect to her.

650
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:38,350
''My heart calls out to your heart.''

651
01:07:42,139 --> 01:07:44,389
''l have fallen in love with you.''

652
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:02,369
''My heart calls out to your heart.''

653
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,380
''l have fallen in love with you.''

654
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:14,209
''My darling, my beloved.''

655
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:16,770
''Trust me.''

656
01:08:17,879 --> 01:08:22,629
''Make yourself as desirous as l am.''

657
01:08:23,879 --> 01:08:28,190
''Understand my heartbeat and
you too fall in love with me.''

658
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:45,980
''lf you wish, l'll get you
the stars and the moon.''

659
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:51,900
''l'll bring the wind
and the clouds for you.''

660
01:10:11,589 --> 01:10:15,810
''What is this scene in my eyes,
what is this feeling?.''

661
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:19,730
''The sea is close but
the shore is obscure.''

662
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,270
''Yet l thirst for something.''

663
01:10:23,129 --> 01:10:24,799
''Let me lay my world at your feet.''

664
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:27,810
''Look into my eyes.''

665
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:39,280
''You are in my thoughts,
my memories everyday.''

666
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,150
''Why do you torment
me so, my beloved?.''

667
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:56,969
''You are always in my
thoughts, my memories, my dreams.''

668
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:08,660
''l won't leave your arms,
or out of your life.''

669
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:14,690
''l promise to return.''

670
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,020
''l will steal you from the world.''

671
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:20,980
''Wait for a little while.''

672
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:26,660
''Make yourself as desirous as l am.''

673
01:12:58,419 --> 01:13:01,410
''How do I Iook into your eyes?.''

674
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:05,329
''How do I have faith?.''

675
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:12,620
''How do l make myself
as desirous as you?.''

676
01:13:15,139 --> 01:13:17,389
''How can I give you my heart?.''

677
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,910
''How do I faII in Iove with you?.''

678
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,110
Don't you dare touch me!

679
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,240
What gave you the right to touch me?

680
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,829
You have no right over me!

681
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,270
Why do you keep tying
to get close to me?

682
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:24,749
Stay away from me!

683
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,869
Where are you going?

684
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,469
l asked,where are you going?

685
01:15:35,249 --> 01:15:37,650
- l'm going out for some days.
-When will you return?

686
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:39,660
l don't know.

687
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:42,499
- And l'll be here alone?
- Everyone is here.

688
01:15:44,259 --> 01:15:45,929
ln any case,you love to be alone.

689
01:15:47,259 --> 01:15:50,249
- If l need something..?
- You won't.

690
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:53,570
Everyone should know
how to look after themselves.

691
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:27,759
- Yes?
- Something important...

692
01:16:28,829 --> 01:16:31,820
l need your opinion. l'm in
the study. Can you come down?

693
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,539
What is so urgent?

694
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:36,509
First come down.

695
01:17:03,429 --> 01:17:04,570
What is this?

696
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,520
What do you mean?

697
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:20,759
Don't pretend. l know the
relation between you and brother.

698
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,200
Or what it isn't.

699
01:17:28,459 --> 01:17:29,980
There could be alot between us.

700
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:33,629
And nobody will find out.

701
01:17:45,509 --> 01:17:46,969
Brother,we're home.

702
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:52,929
You may go home.

703
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,480
That's the limit of his run.

704
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,200
How dare you say this to me?

705
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,950
Or even think about it!

706
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:12,620
No!

707
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,610
Lies! Absolute lie! Bob can
never do such a shameful deed!

708
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:49,870
She must have instigated my brother!

709
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:51,870
And this is going on
for quite some days!

710
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:56,070
When l asked her what she was doing,
she said there was no harm in it.

711
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,230
Nobody will find out.

712
01:19:01,049 --> 01:19:02,360
Lies! Nothing but lies!

713
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,799
They are all lying.

714
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,679
Believe me. l speak the truth.

715
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,620
- Believe me.
-Why should he believe you?

716
01:19:13,329 --> 01:19:14,999
He will believe me. Isn't it?

717
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,589
Mother...you are lying.

718
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:24,379
-What are you saying?
- That's enough.

719
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:27,940
Enough of the lies.

720
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:31,230
All of you are lying.

721
01:19:33,049 --> 01:19:36,770
God knows for how many days, months
and years you've been lying on and on!

722
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:39,910
And l stoically bore
everything only so that..

723
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:43,839
This futile hatred of yours
will someday turn to love.

724
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,429
But now l can't take it.

725
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:50,459
Anjali is not lying.

726
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:55,320
l'm ready to accept anything
you say but this that...

727
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:57,190
Anjali's character has a blemish!

728
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:02,089
l see. So now you
trust her more than us.

729
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,740
Then why must we live here?

730
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:10,509
We'll go away from here.

731
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,259
We'll stay in the farmhouse.

732
01:20:12,789 --> 01:20:14,459
- Okay?
- As you deem fit.

733
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:19,339
lf you have decided,
it must be correct.

734
01:20:21,799 --> 01:20:23,030
Whatever you prefer.

735
01:20:24,839 --> 01:20:25,889
All right.

736
01:20:26,839 --> 01:20:29,940
Nikki, Bob...come on.

737
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:32,270
Let's leave.

738
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,429
Listen...

739
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,690
l'm ready to accept whatever
you say but this that...

740
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,589
Anjali's character has a blemish!

741
01:21:14,419 --> 01:21:19,749
''Though hesitant,
l finally believe in love.''

742
01:21:28,929 --> 01:21:33,240
''You trusted me implicitly,
l could die for you.''

743
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,669
''The breeze is fragrant,
the weather is lovely.''

744
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,789
''This crazy moment whispers...''

745
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,820
''We're alone,take me in your arms
for new sentiments rise in my heart.''

746
01:23:20,179 --> 01:23:22,730
''Come into my arms.''

747
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:26,520
''l will hide you from the world.''

748
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:29,860
''The beat of my heart says..''

749
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:33,860
''Never to let you go away.''

750
01:23:35,589 --> 01:23:40,280
''Hearing you say this,
my eyes have turned moist.''

751
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,749
''l love you.''

752
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:18,980
''l worship you.''

753
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,950
''The heart always prays..''

754
01:25:23,929 --> 01:25:26,039
''That l die in your arms.''

755
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:47,639
''The earth and the sky say
that you are made for me.''

756
01:25:49,459 --> 01:25:55,230
''Destiny has given us
this light of love.''

757
01:25:57,469 --> 01:26:01,339
''l'm infatuated with you.
l'll be crucified for you.''

758
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:20,370
Friends,today is the third wedding
anniversary of Ram and Anjali.

759
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,320
Third wedding anniversary!

760
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:37,370
Embrace each other on this occasion.

761
01:27:46,379 --> 01:27:47,459
What are you looking at?

762
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:53,389
You're looking beautiful.

763
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,120
lt's the way you look at me.
Otherwise it's nothing special.

764
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:10,039
You've been married for 3 years
yet you're on a honeymoon!

765
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:16,440
You never give up.

766
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:20,740
-Where are the guests from London?
- Looking for them, not yet here.

767
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,450
Leave your wife and
join the friends sometime.

768
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,490
He's quite a sticky guy.

769
01:28:33,789 --> 01:28:36,039
My guests are new to Delhi.

770
01:28:36,789 --> 01:28:39,780
l wanted them to see
the Delhi high society.

771
01:28:41,799 --> 01:28:43,320
Your guests are our guests.

772
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:49,070
There they come!

773
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:20,969
''l won't leave your arms,
your world in a hurry.''

774
01:29:24,579 --> 01:29:30,940
''This is my promise to
you, l will return.''

775
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:07,570
Even if you forbid friends,
they still send gifts.

776
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,289
That's their way of
demonstrating love.

777
01:30:15,629 --> 01:30:18,179
Such an expensive gift?
Who has sent this?

778
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:28,810
Which friend of ours is this?

779
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:35,669
That friend of Mrs. Malhotra...

780
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,719
- The one from London?
- Yes.

781
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,690
Why did he have to give
such an expensive gift?

782
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:43,829
We'll send it back.

783
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:48,999
No...he's given it with love.
We must keep it.

784
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,660
We'll return it in our own way.

785
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,749
- All right.
- l'll check.

786
01:31:05,079 --> 01:31:07,329
Yes.We were just
talking about you.

787
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:12,049
Tomorrow night..?Just a moment.

788
01:31:12,749 --> 01:31:14,709
l'll ask my wife. One second.

789
01:31:16,749 --> 01:31:20,469
Mrs. Malhotra's guest,
Dev is throwing a party.

790
01:31:21,759 --> 01:31:23,719
He insists we attend.
What do you think?

791
01:31:25,759 --> 01:31:27,070
whatever you think is right.

792
01:31:32,799 --> 01:31:34,469
Yes,we'll be there.

793
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,039
lt's done!

794
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,810
Thanks Mrs. Malhotra.
Only you could do this.

795
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,370
This will be one of
the best parties of town.

796
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,539
And do you know who
will make it the best?

797
01:31:59,829 --> 01:32:03,259
My business partner,who is
equal to me in every matter.

798
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:06,009
What partner?

799
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:13,299
Sure. l've come from London
only to stand by you.

800
01:32:14,879 --> 01:32:17,280
SheetaI Varma will be
with you to the last stage.

801
01:32:20,889 --> 01:32:22,560
Partners should be like you.

802
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:25,629
See you at the party tomorrow.

803
01:32:40,339 --> 01:32:43,740
This time has come after very long.

804
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,610
Who could stop your time from coming?

805
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:51,179
How time changes...

806
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:53,620
Till yesterday you were alone.

807
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,179
And the world is with you today.

808
01:32:57,959 --> 01:33:00,509
l am very happy to
see you so happy.

809
01:33:01,959 --> 01:33:03,100
You're very happy, aren't you?.

810
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:07,350
Very happy, very, very happy.

811
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:12,669
So far you'd only heard about her.

812
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:14,480
When you see her...

813
01:33:16,009 --> 01:33:18,030
Then you'll know why
l was so crazy about her.

814
01:33:21,009 --> 01:33:24,200
Why Dev lived even after dying.

815
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:28,570
You will know when you meet her.

816
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,169
l'll meet her.

817
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,339
l will meet her.

818
01:34:08,089 --> 01:34:10,200
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

819
01:34:10,759 --> 01:34:12,719
Do you know Dev? Then..?

820
01:34:14,129 --> 01:34:16,350
Why should we be left out
when all of Delhi is here?

821
01:34:17,539 --> 01:34:18,829
By the way,what does Dev do?

822
01:34:21,139 --> 01:34:25,009
Some say he's a business magnate.
Others say he's a computer wizard.

823
01:34:25,879 --> 01:34:27,780
Some say he's related to a politician.

824
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:33,579
My principle is eat, drink,
be merry and get out.

825
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:36,520
He's the flavor of the month.

826
01:35:00,209 --> 01:35:01,730
l knew you'd definitely
come if l called you.

827
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:17,480
He's been waiting for you for so long!
''Often strangers meet in the world.''

828
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:23,429
''They meet on strange paths
and then wander away.''

829
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,200
''But they always come to mind.''
''They talk through the eyes.''

830
01:37:27,889 --> 01:37:30,079
''The heart beats together.''

831
01:37:32,499 --> 01:37:36,509
''Nobody understands
the words of love.''

832
01:37:52,549 --> 01:37:55,829
''Gradually they fill up the heart.''

833
01:38:02,289 --> 01:38:05,450
''Gently they steal the heart.''

834
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,990
''Till someday they separate.''

835
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:50,219
''This heart only asks for love.''

836
01:38:53,079 --> 01:38:54,829
''lt wants a true lover.''

837
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:01,110
''Who knows where and how
one will find love.''

838
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:21,020
''When cray lovers
meet in such nights..''

839
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:30,610
''Their eyes meet and
the hearts beat.''

840
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:34,919
''And stories are made.''

841
01:41:28,669 --> 01:41:29,719
Come in, please.

842
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,729
Why are you standing?
Take a seat.

843
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:17,380
Why are you sitting down?

844
01:42:21,689 --> 01:42:22,920
That is my place.

845
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,870
How is mother?

846
01:42:35,729 --> 01:42:36,779
Mother...?

847
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:39,479
She died.

848
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:41,880
What?

849
01:42:43,739 --> 01:42:48,050
When you left me, l lived.

850
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:51,830
But mother died.

851
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:55,859
- She passed away?
- Yes.

852
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:58,420
And took her dreams along.

853
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:01,460
But l lived on.

854
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,189
l thought of you every
moment and stayed alive.

855
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,960
Do you know when you left me
l didn't have 50 paise with me?

856
01:43:15,809 --> 01:43:17,920
But today l have 5 billion!

857
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:20,220
5 billion!

858
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:25,029
Do you know how l traveled
from 550 paise to 5 billion?

859
01:43:27,819 --> 01:43:28,960
You can't even begin to imagine.

860
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:31,989
l'd walk everyday.

861
01:43:33,819 --> 01:43:35,489
l would get exhausted walking.

862
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:39,380
l'd fall and get up.

863
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:42,090
l'd wound myself.

864
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:45,620
l would bleed.

865
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:47,950
l'd fall again.

866
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:53,880
But your voice would pierce through
my heart like the sun and call out..

867
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:58,130
One more step, Dev. One more.

868
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:06,029
Then matching steps, l went
from 550 paise to 5 billion.

869
01:44:09,389 --> 01:44:10,620
Shall l say something?

870
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:13,330
None of this has any value.

871
01:44:13,899 --> 01:44:15,420
All this is trash!

872
01:44:18,939 --> 01:44:21,489
Everything is meaningless
when you are not with me.

873
01:44:25,939 --> 01:44:27,899
But l can't be yours.

874
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:32,450
l belong to somebody else.

875
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:36,200
Don't forget you were
forced into the marriage!

876
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,950
Not with a man but with his wealth.

877
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,389
With his luxuries and status!

878
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,550
Today l possess the
same status and wealth.

879
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,670
Doesn't that make you mine?.

880
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:56,470
l don't know whom l
was betrothed to..

881
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:03,989
l only know that the man l married..

882
01:45:07,019 --> 01:45:08,250
l worship him.

883
01:45:10,019 --> 01:45:13,450
He is my husband.
He is my life partner.

884
01:45:16,029 --> 01:45:21,660
Ram lives in every breath
and heartbeat of mine.

885
01:45:27,069 --> 01:45:28,410
You are nowhere.

886
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:33,790
Forget me.

887
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,160
Forget me.

888
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,309
Forget everything.

889
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:48,460
lt's not possible for me to forget you

890
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,200
And l won't let you forget me.

891
01:45:54,099 --> 01:45:55,800
You will be mine in this birth.

892
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:57,859
You too hear me out..

893
01:45:59,139 --> 01:46:02,920
l belong to him not only in
this but the next 7 births!

894
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:05,370
Only his.

895
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,830
25%

896
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:36,180
injustice has been done to you.

897
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:42,060
We never claim that
justice was done to us.

898
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,069
One has to pay a price for relations.

899
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,890
But why are you paying it alone?

900
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:51,600
Why not him?

901
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,250
How is that?

902
01:46:57,529 --> 01:46:59,199
At this moment,you are at one quarter

903
01:47:00,229 --> 01:47:01,960
And he owns three fourths.

904
01:47:03,569 --> 01:47:04,619
Why don't we become equals?

905
01:47:10,579 --> 01:47:13,710
But you are such a business tycoon..

906
01:47:14,579 --> 01:47:16,479
Why are you interested
in our business?

907
01:47:17,579 --> 01:47:20,569
Why are you interested
in our relatives alone?

908
01:47:25,989 --> 01:47:28,479
Competition. He's at the peak...

909
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,270
where only one man can stay.

910
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,680
And that is me.

911
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:38,739
Why not?We're with you.

912
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:41,640
You don't have any financial problems.

913
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:49,949
Take our brother, he's taken loans
against the house and business...

914
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:53,119
For his great new project.

915
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:55,989
But this time too
he will be successful! l.

916
01:47:56,649 --> 01:47:57,789
He will be victorious.

917
01:48:01,659 --> 01:48:05,970
Forget about this birth, he
can't win in the next 7 births!

918
01:48:16,039 --> 01:48:17,270
What is this, Mr. Chopra?

919
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:20,229
l want my loan paid right away.

920
01:48:21,109 --> 01:48:23,949
- But why?
l don't trust your project.

921
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:31,710
What? But this
project is your baby.

922
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,119
l trusted you and invested
all my money in it.

923
01:48:35,989 --> 01:48:37,130
How can you turn away?.

924
01:48:37,729 --> 01:48:39,100
l just want my money.

925
01:48:39,729 --> 01:48:40,810
l don't want arguments!

926
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:45,039
From where can l get
this large sum so soon?

927
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:47,880
You are aware that l've invested
all my money in this project.

928
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:53,000
lf you can't pay me, somebody
is willing to pay me off.

929
01:48:53,779 --> 01:48:55,010
You may talk to him.

930
01:48:59,779 --> 01:49:00,859
Who is he?

931
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,500
Ups and downs are a part of business.

932
01:49:16,829 --> 01:49:18,880
You forget that l helped
you in your bad times.

933
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,090
lsn't it your duty to
help me in my bad time?

934
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,000
Try to understand, Chopra has given
those papers to somebody else.

935
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:32,399
l tried meeting him,
to make contact...

936
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:36,279
He's not taking my calls.

937
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,189
l only know his name.

938
01:49:40,859 --> 01:49:42,170
His name is Dev.

939
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:24,880
What are you doing in my chair?

940
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:32,420
This chair is no longer yours.

941
01:50:33,979 --> 01:50:36,090
Till yesterday you owned
three quarters of the business.

942
01:50:36,979 --> 01:50:38,470
And we had one fourth.

943
01:50:39,319 --> 01:50:41,569
Today we have 50%

944
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:46,340
The one with the remaining 50%
gave me the right to this chair!

945
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:11,720
This is what l expected.

946
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,720
This is just what l
expected from you, my brother.

947
01:51:18,789 --> 01:51:23,979
Now that you're seated on this
chair, learn to respect it.

948
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:28,140
Be happy.

949
01:51:57,130 --> 01:51:59,090
Our partnership has just started.

950
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:01,500
Watch out for the future.

951
01:52:08,569 --> 01:52:10,470
l don't know what
enmity he has with me.

952
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:13,409
What does he want?

953
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:16,609
Why is he after my life?

954
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,890
Everything will work out fine.

955
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:21,550
The bad times will pass.

956
01:52:22,189 --> 01:52:24,359
But what is happening is terrible.

957
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,890
Everyone has left us.

958
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:30,649
But you have to be brave.

959
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:36,130
Now this house too
won't remain ours.

960
01:52:39,239 --> 01:52:41,789
- Home..?
- It will be auctioned tomorrow.

961
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:08,220
-95 million.
-95 million.

962
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,970
- 1OO million.
- 1O0 million.

963
01:53:25,649 --> 01:53:28,779
150 million. Going, going.

964
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:33,750
Stop 200 million.

965
01:54:30,449 --> 01:54:31,529
Give it to me, master.

966
01:54:34,049 --> 01:54:36,160
What are you doing?
l'm no longer the master.

967
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:41,370
What are you saying? You will
be my master as long as l live.

968
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:44,089
God helps those who help themselves.

969
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,020
Trust in God. We are with you.

970
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,029
Why do you want to
endanger your job?

971
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,470
l'd give up hundreds
of such jobs for you!

972
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:56,360
You always helped the needy,
gave homes to the homeless.

973
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:59,480
Taught us that man must help man.

974
01:55:00,209 --> 01:55:02,400
How can l forget your teachings?
Come to my house, brother.

975
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:06,369
-We don't want to trouble you.
- Don't be stubborn.

976
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:11,659
Please don't be formal. That
house was given to me by you.

977
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:14,779
- Please come, bride.
- Yes.

978
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:22,300
Please come in, brother.
Bride madam, come in.

979
01:55:23,869 --> 01:55:26,770
lt's a poorman's home but it's yours.

980
01:55:27,869 --> 01:55:29,039
Consider it your own home.

981
01:55:30,879 --> 01:55:33,190
-Where do l keep him?
- Here...

982
01:55:34,879 --> 01:55:37,869
Come here. Place him here.

983
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:43,440
Temples, mosques and
churches have shared God.

984
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:47,079
They distributed rivers and seas
Could they share human beings?

985
01:55:47,890 --> 01:55:49,029
Place Him here.

986
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:53,329
Good Lord!

987
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:00,339
What..? Don't cry, madam.

988
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:03,779
Trust the Lord. The one
who grabbed your home..

989
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:04,760
He can never be happy!

990
01:56:06,279 --> 01:56:07,419
He will never be at peace!

991
01:56:08,949 --> 01:56:10,909
He will die everyday!
He will burn every night!

992
01:59:21,339 --> 01:59:23,300
Look there, Dev.

993
01:59:26,339 --> 01:59:28,589
You are so dark
while he is so fair.

994
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:32,459
How poor you are
and how rich he is.

995
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:35,310
Today too you are ruined
while he flourishes.

996
02:00:05,419 --> 02:00:07,820
''My heart whispers to your heart.''

997
02:00:11,419 --> 02:00:13,970
''l have fallen in love with you.''

998
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:30,579
''My love, my beloved.''

999
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,999
''Trust me.''

1000
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:39,350
''Make yourself as desirous as l am.''

1001
02:00:40,489 --> 02:00:45,239
''Hear my heartbeats and
fall in love with me.''

1002
02:01:51,619 --> 02:01:55,690
''Your lips on mine kindle
an unquenchable thirst.''

1003
02:01:57,629 --> 02:02:01,640
''Both our minds and bodies
are a flame with desire.''

1004
02:02:21,089 --> 02:02:25,039
''The weather is cold, passions
flow hot,the heart is stormy.''

1005
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:30,850
''Both are eager with
anticipation, dreams in eyes.''

1006
02:02:32,699 --> 02:02:36,570
''My heart wishes you
spend your life with me.''

1007
02:03:58,879 --> 02:04:02,310
''The night is incomplete, so is
our talk and the steps falter.''

1008
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:07,900
''Let's take each other in
our arms and cuddle together.''

1009
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:31,249
''This moment is intoxicating,
l'm losing my senses.''

1010
02:04:32,949 --> 02:04:36,959
''Something tugs at my heart
when you look at me so.''

1011
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:42,900
''All l ask for now is
that you love me forever.''

1012
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:10,840
No! No!

1013
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,779
lt's impossible for me to forget you.

1014
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:28,439
And l won't allow you to forget me.

1015
02:05:30,529 --> 02:05:32,430
Nobody can come between us!

1016
02:05:34,529 --> 02:05:35,670
Nobody.

1017
02:05:38,529 --> 02:05:39,609
Nobody at all.

1018
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:02,670
What?

1019
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:05,260
This is not your place. Get up.

1020
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:11,890
After all we're also partners.

1021
02:06:21,609 --> 02:06:22,750
what did you do?

1022
02:06:25,609 --> 02:06:26,689
Did you enjoy it?

1023
02:06:27,619 --> 02:06:31,430
l enjoyed it so much
that l felt like...

1024
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:42,500
What's the matter baby?Why is
your cheek red? Mosquito bit you?

1025
02:06:44,670 --> 02:06:46,340
Mosquitoes in our office?.

1026
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,079
What's wrong, son?.

1027
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:02,260
- Sounds like a poisonous mosquito.
- A male mosquito.

1028
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:05,600
-What?
- Female mosquito. Sit down.

1029
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:09,479
Mother,take a seat.

1030
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:14,140
How did you come by?

1031
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:18,619
Sheetal, give me a check for 1 million.

1032
02:07:19,729 --> 02:07:22,279
Only last week, you and Bob
took a check of 1.5 million.

1033
02:07:23,739 --> 02:07:26,579
1.5 million? Nikki,you didn't tell me.

1034
02:07:28,739 --> 02:07:30,260
Do we have to take your
permission for everything?

1035
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:35,479
Keep my check ready!

1036
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:50,880
Strange, isn't it?.

1037
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:55,810
Despite living in London,we
never raised our voice with parents.

1038
02:07:57,810 --> 02:08:00,359
And the kids here behave
so impertinently...

1039
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:05,359
That's not right. All
children are not the same.

1040
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:08,560
l have another son.

1041
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:13,250
He never raises his eyes
while talking to me.

1042
02:08:15,859 --> 02:08:17,529
How he trusted me...

1043
02:08:18,859 --> 02:08:20,170
What did you do to him?

1044
02:08:20,859 --> 02:08:22,529
You didn't trust him?Why?

1045
02:08:25,869 --> 02:08:28,119
He was not my son.
He's my stepson.

1046
02:08:31,609 --> 02:08:32,920
What times do you live in?

1047
02:08:34,279 --> 02:08:36,470
Do you believe in these
things in this age?

1048
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:42,479
ln today's world,your own family
stabs you and strangers help.

1049
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:45,590
lt's your upbringing.

1050
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:47,670
Which parents give.

1051
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,220
Good upbringing brings good rewards.

1052
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:53,390
And bad values...

1053
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:57,630
lt's the responsibility of the parents

1054
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,239
Everything lies in their hands.

1055
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:28,520
What are you doing here?

1056
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:32,800
l have found my rightful place.

1057
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,270
This is not your place.

1058
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:38,500
lt belongs to my
daughter and son-in-law.

1059
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:41,210
Where are they?

1060
02:10:41,869 --> 02:10:45,239
Thanks to you, l have
brought them down to the road!

1061
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:47,609
What have you done to them?

1062
02:10:51,149 --> 02:10:53,109
Don't assume l've
stooped down to insolence.

1063
02:10:54,819 --> 02:10:57,659
Carefully look into the image
of my shoe and to recall..

1064
02:10:59,189 --> 02:11:01,470
Why did you shun my true love?

1065
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:04,859
Because my feet weren't
in with expensive shoes?

1066
02:11:05,859 --> 02:11:07,229
But a poor man's slipper!

1067
02:11:08,199 --> 02:11:09,689
Or because expensive clothes
didn't hang on my body?

1068
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:11,569
Or because there was
no cash in my pocket!

1069
02:11:14,199 --> 02:11:16,449
Before l kick you
with this same shoe..

1070
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:39,630
Today l am convinced that my
decision was absolutely right.

1071
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,750
What l chose for my
daughter was right.

1072
02:11:46,670 --> 02:11:47,979
Parents are a form of God.

1073
02:11:48,939 --> 02:11:50,899
And they write the fate of
their children in that form.

1074
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:54,229
This father too has written
his daughter's destiny and...

1075
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:57,829
You were never destined
for her nor will you ever be!

1076
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:01,510
Another thing...

1077
02:12:02,979 --> 02:12:06,699
You were insolent yesterday.
Today too you are insolent.

1078
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,350
My daughter will never be yours!

1079
02:12:12,329 --> 02:12:13,560
She will never be yours!

1080
02:12:18,329 --> 02:12:19,699
Father-in-law...

1081
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:23,359
Do whatever you please...

1082
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:28,619
Someday l will succeed in
making you my father-in-law.

1083
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:39,880
Such a tragedy took place
and you never informed us.

1084
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:42,909
l didn't want you to worry.

1085
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:45,850
You are our only child.

1086
02:12:46,729 --> 02:12:48,100
All that we possess is yours.

1087
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,109
And Ram's.  We'll make
everything new for Ram.

1088
02:12:51,399 --> 02:12:52,770
Don't ever mention this to him!

1089
02:12:54,399 --> 02:12:55,859
lt will hurt his self-esteem.

1090
02:12:57,409 --> 02:12:59,520
Swear by me that you
won't ever say anything!

1091
02:13:02,409 --> 02:13:05,840
- Does Ram know about Dev?
- No.

1092
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:10,119
And l don't ever want him to find out.

1093
02:13:12,449 --> 02:13:14,119
l don't know what will
happen if he finds out.

1094
02:13:15,859 --> 02:13:19,369
Paps, go away. l don't
want him to meet you.

1095
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:23,010
He won't like it if
you saw us in this state.

1096
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:25,699
Please, Papa.

1097
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:28,550
Okay, my dear.

1098
02:13:29,470 --> 02:13:32,689
lf that's what you wish,
we won't interfere in your life.

1099
02:13:35,479 --> 02:13:39,789
But remember the blessings of
this father are always with you.

1100
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:45,409
And the blessings of
parents are never wasted.

1101
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:50,920
This is a bad phase.
It will pass.

1102
02:13:52,529 --> 02:13:53,609
Everything will turn out fine.

1103
02:13:54,529 --> 02:13:55,609
Come on.

1104
02:14:45,609 --> 02:14:48,739
You..?When did you come?

1105
02:14:56,319 --> 02:14:57,399
When did you come?

1106
02:15:00,329 --> 02:15:02,880
Go and have a bath.
l'll serve dinner.

1107
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:04,970
Wait.

1108
02:15:10,669 --> 02:15:15,499
ln our deep relation of trust,
you've hidden some deep secrets.

1109
02:15:17,549 --> 02:15:18,539
Why, Anjali?

1110
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:24,240
Was our relation forced on to you?

1111
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:27,400
No....

1112
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:31,160
Was this marriage against your wishes?

1113
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:36,610
And the fool that l was
l kept thinking, maybe...

1114
02:15:40,039 --> 02:15:43,470
Maybe you are sad because
you are away from your parents.

1115
02:15:45,539 --> 02:15:47,289
You are caught in the
problems of new marriage.

1116
02:15:49,709 --> 02:15:53,720
Not for a moment did l think
it could be anything else.

1117
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,419
Not for a moment did l think you..

1118
02:16:00,089 --> 02:16:01,320
You loved somebody else.

1119
02:16:03,089 --> 02:16:06,279
No, Ram. l don't love him.

1120
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:11,529
l don't know whether
l loved him or not.

1121
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:14,560
l don't know if l had a past.

1122
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:20,260
l only know that l love you.
l only love you.

1123
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:24,660
What is past was my past.

1124
02:16:25,609 --> 02:16:29,480
Believe me, l hid this from you
because l was scared.

1125
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:33,699
l scared about what you'd think.

1126
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:36,300
You won't understand.

1127
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:39,570
Believe me.

1128
02:16:59,179 --> 02:17:00,320
Are you all right?

1129
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:07,890
You are expecting.

1130
02:17:10,230 --> 02:17:11,459
You are pregnant.

1131
02:17:17,629 --> 02:17:19,820
Our new life begins from here.

1132
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:24,970
You were right.

1133
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:27,910
Forget the past.

1134
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:33,150
You must've borne alot
but now you're not alone.

1135
02:17:34,250 --> 02:17:36,209
l am with you. Yes.

1136
02:17:38,289 --> 02:17:41,330
We will face every
difficulty together.

1137
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:50,259
Son,you are not alone.

1138
02:17:52,629 --> 02:17:53,800
l am with you.

1139
02:17:57,310 --> 02:17:58,980
Parents always forgive their kids.

1140
02:18:01,039 --> 02:18:04,410
But it must be rare that a mother
asks her son for forgiveness.

1141
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:07,019
- Forgive me.
- No, mother.

1142
02:18:13,349 --> 02:18:15,019
Forgive me, dear.

1143
02:18:16,359 --> 02:18:20,519
We forget that when we
bring a girl to our home...

1144
02:18:21,699 --> 02:18:23,369
We don't have to scare her..

1145
02:18:24,769 --> 02:18:26,959
We can win her over with love.

1146
02:18:28,369 --> 02:18:29,599
l will fix everything.

1147
02:18:30,769 --> 02:18:34,429
And first of all, l'll will
everything l have to your child.

1148
02:18:38,379 --> 02:18:43,570
Take me to the temple. l want
to ask God to forgive my lapses.

1149
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:49,090
- Love, may l go?
- Yes.

1150
02:18:51,429 --> 02:18:52,660
- Come, mother.
- Okay.

1151
02:18:55,429 --> 02:18:57,539
Now l will see to it that
our family never splits.

1152
02:18:58,429 --> 02:18:59,570
We will live together.

1153
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:51,890
ls Dev there?

1154
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:57,109
-Who is it?
- l'm Anjali.

1155
02:20:15,580 --> 02:20:16,810
There's a call for you.

1156
02:20:27,619 --> 02:20:28,759
Who..?

1157
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:54,530
l want to meet you.

1158
02:20:55,450 --> 02:20:57,149
Where are you?
l'll come there right away.

1159
02:20:58,489 --> 02:21:03,380
No, l'll come to see you. At home.

1160
02:21:05,489 --> 02:21:08,040
This is your house.
Come fast. l'm waiting.

1161
02:21:16,839 --> 02:21:18,100
Anjali is coming home!

1162
02:21:26,509 --> 02:21:29,640
l won! Sheetal, l won!

1163
02:21:31,550 --> 02:21:32,890
l want the house to look different!

1164
02:21:36,559 --> 02:21:37,790
You've got good taste.
What should we do?

1165
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:42,149
My taste..? Should we
light candles, lamps..?

1166
02:21:43,059 --> 02:21:44,290
We'll light lamps.

1167
02:21:48,569 --> 02:21:50,239
-Where are you going?
- One minute...

1168
02:23:21,759 --> 02:23:23,950
-What?
-What are you wearing?

1169
02:23:28,270 --> 02:23:31,700
This is what l am.
This is the real me.

1170
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:38,790
l want Anjali to find
Dev just as she left him.

1171
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:43,009
Dev should have the same
song on his lips...

1172
02:23:47,819 --> 02:23:49,110
that Anjali left in his heartbeat.

1173
02:23:53,829 --> 02:23:56,380
Song...what song?

1174
02:24:57,960 --> 02:25:04,909
''You live in my heartbeat.''

1175
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:20,210
''You whisper in my breath.''

1176
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:31,059
''Come into my arms
and dream on with me.''

1177
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:32,110
''Don't hesitate.
Don't bar the world.''

1178
02:26:33,149 --> 02:26:36,050
''Hear the cries of my heart.''

1179
02:26:46,169 --> 02:26:49,239
''Don't be angry with me, my love.''

1180
02:26:50,169 --> 02:26:53,159
''l can't live this life without you.''

1181
02:26:54,579 --> 02:26:57,950
''My eyes search for you.''

1182
02:26:59,179 --> 02:27:02,169
''Come and meet me.''

1183
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:15,400
l want to say something to you.

1184
02:28:17,060 --> 02:28:19,959
l want to tell you that you..

1185
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:23,609
''Say nothing, keep quiet.''

1186
02:28:25,070 --> 02:28:27,619
''Let the heart beats speak.''

1187
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:40,509
''My beloved has returned.''

1188
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:44,660
Streams of joy flow from my eyes.''

1189
02:28:46,119 --> 02:28:53,070
''Don't ask how l've spent
the days without you.''

1190
02:29:24,189 --> 02:29:25,269
You misunderstand.

1191
02:29:27,199 --> 02:29:28,869
Once again you misunderstand.

1192
02:29:29,529 --> 02:29:30,730
You misunderstand.

1193
02:29:31,529 --> 02:29:32,609
You always misunderstand.

1194
02:29:33,599 --> 02:29:36,090
You still love me and
that is why you've returned!

1195
02:29:36,869 --> 02:29:39,709
No, l haven't returned.

1196
02:29:41,609 --> 02:29:43,359
And now l can never return.

1197
02:29:46,209 --> 02:29:47,580
l've only come to say...

1198
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:53,349
...to the man who once
used to be my dear friend..

1199
02:29:56,259 --> 02:29:57,599
l am expecting a baby.

1200
02:29:59,259 --> 02:30:00,400
Mother...

1201
02:30:11,269 --> 02:30:13,580
At least now try to understand
that l have forgotten you.

1202
02:30:15,279 --> 02:30:16,709
At least now forget me.

1203
02:30:19,279 --> 02:30:20,949
You will always be in my heart.

1204
02:30:22,279 --> 02:30:23,590
But you can't be my life.

1205
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:27,660
Only Ram is my life.

1206
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:31,490
Believe me, l only love him.

1207
02:30:32,830 --> 02:30:34,060
l love him alot.

1208
02:30:37,330 --> 02:30:38,640
Let me live my life.

1209
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:41,830
Go away from my life.

1210
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:44,570
Leave us alone.

1211
02:30:45,340 --> 02:30:46,480
Go away.

1212
02:31:26,410 --> 02:31:27,550
l have lost.

1213
02:31:31,449 --> 02:31:32,679
l have lost?

1214
02:31:35,459 --> 02:31:38,009
How is it possible that
one loves another so much..

1215
02:31:40,129 --> 02:31:42,090
But gets nothing but scorn and pain.

1216
02:31:45,869 --> 02:31:48,500
How can l believe that she
Ioves somebody else not me?

1217
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:53,429
Why did l deceive myself
all these years?

1218
02:31:55,480 --> 02:31:57,150
Why did l pretend to be
ignorant though l knew all?

1219
02:31:58,480 --> 02:32:00,150
Why did l lose though l won?

1220
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:04,849
And he won though he lost.

1221
02:32:32,350 --> 02:32:33,720
Who says you've lost?

1222
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:37,489
Who says l won?

1223
02:32:39,390 --> 02:32:41,940
ls that the only relation
between two human beings?

1224
02:32:43,390 --> 02:32:45,409
Only of vengeance, enmity..?

1225
02:32:46,390 --> 02:32:48,059
Why do you consider me your enemy?

1226
02:32:49,399 --> 02:32:51,360
Why do you consider
yourself my enemy?

1227
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:56,069
Once you met Anjali.

1228
02:32:57,409 --> 02:32:58,550
She met you.

1229
02:32:59,409 --> 02:33:01,079
Two friends came close.

1230
02:33:03,409 --> 02:33:04,839
You saw so many dreams..

1231
02:33:05,409 --> 02:33:06,780
You had hopes for the future..

1232
02:33:08,749 --> 02:33:12,179
And destiny shattered all
the dreams in one stroke.

1233
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:16,630
Showed you no mercy.

1234
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:19,649
Destiny didn't feel sorry for you.

1235
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:23,130
How can l hate you?

1236
02:33:24,470 --> 02:33:25,989
How can l consider you my enemy?

1237
02:33:27,470 --> 02:33:28,610
What is your fault?

1238
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:32,350
Only that you loved somebody?

1239
02:33:33,739 --> 02:33:35,909
You have only fallen in love.

1240
02:33:36,479 --> 02:33:39,030
You didn't kill somebody.
Didn't commit as in.

1241
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:44,020
Shall l tell you something?

1242
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:49,800
There are so many men in the world
All who want to make their destiny.

1243
02:33:51,530 --> 02:33:52,899
But it's not in their hands.

1244
02:33:53,530 --> 02:33:56,960
God decides our destiny, not us.

1245
02:33:58,530 --> 02:34:00,489
This is his decision, his game.

1246
02:34:01,540 --> 02:34:03,649
This is destiny.
This is coincidence.

1247
02:34:15,550 --> 02:34:16,690
Destiny...

1248
02:34:17,589 --> 02:34:18,790
God..?

1249
02:34:20,589 --> 02:34:22,809
l could never believe in destiny.

1250
02:34:24,589 --> 02:34:27,140
l could never believe that God exists.

1251
02:34:29,999 --> 02:34:33,950
l was one of those men
who believe that..

1252
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:38,270
Man's strength is
his greatest strength.

1253
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:44,120
But today l believe in destiny.

1254
02:34:45,610 --> 02:34:46,749
There is a God.

1255
02:34:47,950 --> 02:34:50,059
The amount of love
l have given to Anjali...

1256
02:34:52,319 --> 02:34:53,370
Nobody can love like that.

1257
02:34:55,659 --> 02:34:56,739
Probably not even you.

1258
02:34:58,659 --> 02:35:02,970
But your palm has the
lines that mine don't.

1259
02:35:05,399 --> 02:35:09,940
Your forehead has the
lines that mine doesn't.

1260
02:35:13,669 --> 02:35:14,899
How can I ruin you?.

1261
02:35:17,679 --> 02:35:19,140
How can l destroy you?

1262
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:24,620
l will be devastated in
trying to annihilate you.

1263
02:35:35,729 --> 02:35:37,100
My name is Dev.

1264
02:35:38,729 --> 02:35:40,100
l wanted to live like God.

1265
02:35:41,739 --> 02:35:43,409
l'm not fit fort his earth.

1266
02:35:46,069 --> 02:35:47,210
Your name is Ram.

1267
02:35:47,739 --> 02:35:49,700
You always lived like Ram.

1268
02:35:50,749 --> 02:35:52,999
You lived like a human among humans.

1269
02:35:55,749 --> 02:35:57,419
How can you not win?.

1270
02:35:58,790 --> 02:36:00,130
Why not?

1271
02:36:14,540 --> 02:36:15,559
Kindly pay attention.

You know him.

1283
02:37:05,919 --> 02:37:08,880
- Could it be Dev?
-Who else could it be?

1284
02:37:10,259 --> 02:37:11,159
There can only be Dev for Sheetal.

Else Papa won't like it.

1292

The heart desires to risk everything.
