00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,950
Hello!
Hello!

3
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,360
Sir...
- Hello!

4
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,430
I am here, in front.

5
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,920
Over here!
Here!

6
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,520
Hello!
Over here, sir.

7
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,090
Yes, I saw you.
Come!

8
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,160
And... Sir...

9
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
Four of my people
will come tomorrow.

10
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,460
Don't forget. See you tomorrow.
- Okay!

11
00:03:54,484 --> 00:04:04,484

13
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,170
Come out, you rascal!

14
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,970
Go and check!
Go!

15
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,850
Thrash him!

16
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,020
Come out, you rascal!

17
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,970
I will count to ten!

18
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
One!

19
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Two!

20
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Three!

21
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Four!

22
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,510
Five!

23
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,300
The whole world knows that I am
Superstar Hareendran's driver.

24
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,570
But it's been many years
since I'm being mocked,

25
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,670
... saying that I am good only for
reversing the car and washing it!

26
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,350
It would be nice if you could
let me drive once in a while.

27
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,300
To reach the location...

28
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,090
... we still have a lot of time!

29
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,130
You can go slowly!

30
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,810
Oh God! Allah!
Protect me!

31
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,610
Good Morning, sir.

32
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,170
Hey! The movie should be good.

33
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,430
People should like it.

34
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,880
The producer should make money.

35
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,420
Whether it breaks collection
records or not, is not my concern.

36
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,830
I'll call you.
I've reached the location.

37
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,510
There are amazing reports
about the movie.

38
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,090
When you said you're coming from Palakkad,
we expected you only by 10 AM.

39
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,270
But you drove yourself, is it?

40
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,470
Of course! To drive that car,
he should pay me money!

41
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Is he leaving?

42
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,880
Hey!

43
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,370
Go and tell him!

44
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,040
This one?

45
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,010
This is Rolls Royce
Series 1 Ghost, right?

46
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,270
Why, sir?
Is it bad?

47
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,510
It's not bad.
It's an amazing car.

48
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,710
To travel in the back seat.

49
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,300
Do I need a car to
sit in the back?

50
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,360
If you have any imported sports cars
that are great to drive, bring them.

51
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
I'll see then.
- Sir...

52
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,600
Okay.
- Shall we get ready?

53
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,370
Have you acted in movies?
- No.

54
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Why don't you act?

55
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,460
I'm not interested.
- Why so?

56
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,530
It's like that.
- What's your name?

57
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,720
Ikka, if you move his date from
14th to 13th, I'll be safe.

58
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,880
Please.
I'll call you, okay?

59
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,050
Tell him!
- I will.

60
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,270
I'll tell him.

61
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,810
Sir, shall I read that scene?

62
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,840
The scene in which he comes
out of the hospital, right?

63
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,870
I know it.

64
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,020
No, sir. There is a small
correction in the dialogue.

65
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
What's that?

66
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,930
Is it tight?
- It's okay, sir.

67
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,220
After coming out of the hospital,
Detective Rajan Philip talks to

68
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,590
CI Alex, who's waiting outside.

69
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,800
The surgery is not over yet.

70
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,140
But I know it will be a success.

71
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,470
Because Safalya Hospital is one of the
best in the whole world, in neurosurgery.

72
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,170
The neurology department
of Safalya Hospital...

73
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,490
Stop! Stop!

74
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,180
Why are you going on
saying 'Safalya Hospital'?

75
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,900
Earlier, I was supposed to say the
name of some neurosurgeon, right?

76
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,820
Why did you change it
to the hospital's name?

77
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,840
Well, sir...
In this hospital...

78
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,340
the producers' company
has an investment.

79
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,700
Oh! So it's an advertisement!

80
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,250
Right?

81
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,750
For that, you need to spend
money and shoot a separate ad!

82
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,380
Instead of stuffing
it into the movie!

83
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,660
The movie will have only
what's required for it.

84
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,640
I won't say this dialogue.

85
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,560
Keep scratching his back!

86
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,530
It's not too difficult to say one
dialogue if he wants to, sir.

87
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,600
It's a hospital which people attacked
for tearing up someone's stomach!

88
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,060
World's best, it seems!

89
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Idiot!

90
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,450
I heard that!

91
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,090
I care a damn if you heard it!

92
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Is the shot ready?

93
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,750
Sir, we've kept a close up shot of
the hand turning the car's key on.

94
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,900
I'll shoot it with a dupe.

95
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,610
Why?
When I'm here?

96
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,490
To start the car,
I'll use my own hand!

97
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,710
Sir, just one chance.
She'll do it properly.

98
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,010
Please.

99
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,050
Sir... Sir, please.

100
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,590
Are you the one who taught
her to take the H test?

101
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,160
Yes.
- Do one thing.

102
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,030
Draw an 'H', on the way she goes.
It will be correct then.

103
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,180
For a ticket of 40 Rupees,
I need to pass 400 people? Next!

104
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm not someone who made some
quick money from somewhere,

105
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,290
and came to produce, without
knowing the ABC of cinema!

106
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,250
This is a corporate institution!

107
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm the one who's answerable!

108
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,830
Why aren't you saying anything?

109
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,230
After planning it in a
budget of 15 Crores,

110
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,040
we've already spent 18 Crores!

111
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,260
Here's the guy who planned the budget.
Ask him!

112
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,130
No movie has been completed in
the planned budget so far, sir.

113
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,300
Then why do we need a paper
with the budget on it?

114
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,500
To wipe kids' shit?

115
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,590
A climax in which
everything is on fire!

116
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,850
And we're yet to shoot it.
- Yes.

117
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,440
In between all that, he has a U.S.
trip of one month!

118
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,550
Hari sir had told us in advance
about the trip, right?

119
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,480
His wife has some surgery, right?
- Yes, he had told us, sir.

120
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,230
He told us in advance, it seems!

121
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,580
He gave such a long speech when we asked
him to change one dialogue, right?

122
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,770
If he loves cinema so much,

123
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,100
he should be leaving only after
the entire shoot is over.

124
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,500
Then you tell him directly!

125
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,560
Don't take it out on me!

126
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,450
I'm going there to say that now.

127
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Hello!

128
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,790
I will call you back.

129
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,530
Sir, the area marked in red... All
of it will be constructed as a set.

130
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,760
We'll start the construction
of the set very soon.

131
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,520
So early?
Why?

132
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Just for fun!

133
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,970
What?

134
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,310
Well, let the set construction be over.

135
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,810
If your trip gets cancelled
due to some reason,

136
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,440
we can finish the shooting, right?

137
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,250
To get cancelled, this
is not a vacation!

138
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,120
It's for my wife's treatment!

139
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,340
And it was scheduled 3 months back!

140
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,370
I had told you, right?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,600
Bhama, why are you doing this? Isn't
there anybody else? - it's okay.

142
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Tea.

143
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,520
She's completely fine, right?

144
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,570
It must be a minor surgery, right?

145
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,780
Who told you that
it's a surgery?

146
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,360
When she took some tests,
the doctors had a small doubt.

147
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,310
So we're going there to do
some more advanced tests.

148
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,390
That's all.

149
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,230
After that, we'll decide whether
a surgery is needed or...

150
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,440
I got what you said only now.

151
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,350
If it's a minor surgery,

152
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,530
why am I going all the
way there with her?

153
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,750
Right?
- Yes.

154
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,800
I might be an actor and
a star for you all.

155
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,700
But for her, I am her husband.

156
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Do you know something?

157
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,990
In the past 8 years,

158
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,200
we're going to spend 30
days together only now.

159
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,430
If I can't be with her at least
during this time, when needs my care,

160
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,760
then all these awards and applause
from the people, would be meaningless.

161
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,250
Sorry.

162
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,720
In this matter,
I am an old-fashioned husband.

163
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,850
The shoot will happen correctly,
at the time I promised.

164
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
That's my word!

165
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,110
Tell me if there's anything else.

166
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,190
Sir...

167
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,030
The place we're shooting, right?

168
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a place where the
navy has a lease hold.

169
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,670
Along with giving the application
for the shooting permission,

170
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,120
the licences of the drivers who'll be driving
for the shooting, should be submitted.

171
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,380
So if we could get your licence,
we'll take a copy and send it back.

172
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,670
Well, my licence...

173
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,250
No one asks for it to
people like us, right?

174
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,620
Kunjali...

175
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Bhama!

176
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,210
You bloody dog!

177
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,450
Come out!
- That means?

178
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,780
That means, 'Come out!'

179
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,550
I will count to ten!

180
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,600
That means, he will count to ten.
- Okay.

181
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,390
Then he holds that guy tight...

182
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,470
and keeps him on gun-point,
and says...

183
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
'One'

184
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,190
'Two'

185
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
'Three'

186
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
'Four'
- Here!

187
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,220
Food & gravy are ready!
Eat it!

188
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,650
If you keep narrating this stupid
story, and make the food go cold,

189
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,920
I'll break both your heads!

190
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,950
Get lost!

191
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,660
Don't you have any work in the kitchen?
Just go! Don't disturb us!

192
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
Go! Go! Get going!
- Get lost!

193
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
Disturbing when I'm talking to my child?
- Tell me the rest.

194
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,040
So people all around,
are gaping in wonder.

195
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,950
By the time he counts till ten,

196
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,250
the villain comes out,
from behind that wall.

197
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,850
He walks out, raising
both his hands.

198
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,330
That's where the
real twist happens.

199
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,850
We'd think that he'd ruin it with
the usual over-long dialogues.

200
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,520
But he just takes the gun out and..
BANG! BANG BANG!

201
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,350
He fires three shots,
and then blows into the gun like this...

202
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,770
and then he turns in slow motion!
Oh wow!!

203
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,770
Hit! Hit!
Take me for this movie tomorrow.

204
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Sure!
- Okay.

205
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,450
Bullets, smoke and fire!

206
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,800
Hareendran, it seems!

207
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,330
That's where Bhadran scores!

208
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,880
He is so good in comedy!

209
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Buffoon!

210
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,360
I'll whack you!
Eat it if you want!

211
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,710
Are you crazy to keep watching
the same movie 4-5 times?

212
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,580
Not 5. It's worth
watching even 10 times!

213
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,290
I watch one movie only once!

214
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,870
It's difficult to even watch once!

215
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,910
Bhadran's movies, right?

216
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,190
It goes away from theatres on first
day, and it comes on TV the second day!

217
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,210
Big deal!

218
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,070
Ants have entered inside
his shirt or what?

219
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,780
Oh my God!
What is this? Mamangam?

220
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,810
Chetta, have you come to act?

221
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,880
No! I was called by Bhadran sir.

222
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,470
What's your name?
- Ananthu Panicker.

223
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Okay.
You may go.

224
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,940
When sir is sitting here,
with a tough attitude,

225
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,190
Bhadran sir will make his entry.

226
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,640
As soon as Bhadran sir comes...

227
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,900
Someone stand in his position!

228
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,090
after a look from the Hajiyar,

229
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,980
it will be the dialogue of his wife.

230
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,970
Then, you should say
the next dialogue.

231
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,860
Okay? Won't you say it?
All set?

232
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,070
Ready!
- Ready!

233
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,520
Sir, a rehearsal without artists?
- Who's that?

234
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,100
Move away from the frame!

235
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,640
I came to meet Bhadran sir.

236
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,740
Take him away!
- Sir, Bhadran sir is inside.

237
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,580
It's an emotional scene in which I
see my mother-in-law's dead body.

238
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,200
Why didn't you bring
pants that are colourful?

239
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,250
It's been half an hour since you said you
reached the gate, right? Where did you go?

240
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,750
Well, I thought you were busy, sir.
- Why would I be busy?

241
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Sit down.

242
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
Here you go.

243
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,480
Horoscope of Hareendran...
Kalidinam 186...

244
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,720
Hey! Don't read it.
Explain it in short.

245
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,560
Hareendran is blessed with prosperity
by Venus for the next 5 years.

246
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,590
Bloody Venus!

247
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,000
Is there any way to lock
this Venus for a while.

248
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,460
To lock it, Venus is not a door!

249
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,130
Zaheer, lock that door!

250
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,010
Panicker, his next two movies...

251
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,720
No... Just one movie..
Is there any way to make it flop?

252
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,340
Like that thing
you do with eggs!

253
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,570
I mean, that Voodoo spell
you guys do using eggs?

254
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,900
Something like that?
- Sir, I've already done that.

255
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,050
Moreover, Hareendran will suffer from the
planet Kethu's curse for the next 3 months.

256
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,340
Enough of Kethu.
I've heard a lot about that.

257
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,250
Will you be able to do
anything like I said?

258
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Will his film flop?

259
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,590
It won't flop!

260
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,150
Then what the hell were
you saying so far?

261
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,320
His next film will flop
only if it releases, right?

262
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,870
That movie won't release.
That's for sure!

263
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,070
Hello! Can you write that on
a stamp paper & sign on it?

264
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,260
Zaheer, keep quiet.
- What is this, sir?

265
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,750
You may leave now, Panicker.

266
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
We'll meet later.

267
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,110
Here.

268
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,710
Eggs!
Beware!

269
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,340
Are you crazy or what, sir?

270
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,820
All these shady deals!

271
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,600
Come here.
Come!

272
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,480
Hey Fans Association President!

273
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
It's not because I believe in it.

274
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,750
I should do something
from my side...

275
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,600
... for my peace of mind.
That's all.

276
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,870
Give it.

277
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,930
Let me become fair!

278
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,270
No! The producer
doesn't know anything!

279
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,580
I'm the one who runs everything!

280
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,590
I have to run helter skelter
to get things done.

281
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,820
He has come.
I'll call you later.

282
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,130
Namaste, sir.

283
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,980
I have to bow to
this guy also now!

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,670
Sir., that's Hari sir's driver.

285
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,350
Understood.
That's why I bowed to him!

286
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,510
Should I bow once more?

287
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
Namaste, sir.

288
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,810
What did you want to say?
- Well, I was about to say...

289
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,870
Tell me what it is!

290
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,160
Don't get tensed, sir.
- See!

291
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,620
You already made me tensed!

292
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,380
I'm fed up!

293
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,630
Come.

294
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,520
Tell me what the matter is.

295
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,780
Hari sir's driving
licence is missing!

296
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,630
So? - Sir, we have to submit
Hari sir's new driving licence,

297
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,520
to get the permission for
the location, right?

298
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,090
Hey Production Controller!

299
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,530
Learn to say at least something
without scaring other people!

300
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,810
Look at the matter you found
to make me tensed, in vain!

301
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,570
Where did he lose it, man?

302
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,770
We gave the licence to an
auto-consultant, to get it renewed.

303
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,430
Later when we enquired,
he left to Dubai.

304
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,900
We searched thoroughly
in his house.

305
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,100
We didn't find
anything there.

306
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,100
Give an application for
a duplicate licence!

307
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,500
If they see his name,
it will be done in 2 days!

308
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,530
No, sir.

309
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,570
He took the licence from
Kollam RTO office back then.

310
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,670
Kollam RTO office is
in Pakistan or what?

311
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,490
It's not that, sir.
We went to Kollam RTO office.

312
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,420
But when they
shifted their office,

313
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,200
many files went missing.

314
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,230
So?

315
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,390
So...

316
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,530
He would have to get a new
driving licence, sir.

317
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,420
Then ask him to get
a new one somehow.

318
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,390
Sir, only after getting Hari
sir's new driving licence,

319
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,610
we can apply for the
permission of the location.

320
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,670
We can start out set construction there,
only after getting the permission.

321
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,030
And we can shoot the climax,
only after the set construction is over.

322
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,340
This is the situation.

323
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,910
Why the hell did I have
to take up this movie?

324
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,100
This is why I said initially
that you shouldn't get tensed.

325
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,460
I'll whack...

326
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,070
Sir...

327
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,730
Hari sir has a very close friend.
Johnny Peringodan.

328
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,810
He's the DCC President,
and KPCC member as well.

329
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,220
So? Should I make
him an AICC member?

330
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,890
It's not that, sir.

331
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,900
Peringodan sir is trying.

332
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,600
So we'll definitely get the licence.

333
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,060
Whichever loser it may be,
ask him to get it sorted quickly!

334
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,110
Please!

335
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,470
Now, can you all please leave?

336
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,250
I'll get my dose of
abuses from the top now.

337
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,500
You needn't hear that, right?

338
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,930
Ah! Here comes the call!

339
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,920
Go fast, man!

340
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Sir!

341
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,890
Everything is going fine!

342
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Yeah! Yeah!

343
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,660
You know what the problem of
driving without a licence is?

344
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,670
You won't even get insurance.

345
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,040
Mohanan!
Has Samuel sir come?

346
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,410
Yes, he is in inside.
Well, what about that matter of ours?

347
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,960
Which one?
- Didn't I tell you something that day?

348
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,870
That's why I have come, right?
- Is it?

349
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,660
It's quite crowded here today.
- There's a learner's test today.

350
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,850
Oh okay!

351
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,410
See you then.

352
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,600
What matter was he talking about?

353
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,770
Hello!

354
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,020
You have one, right?
Look into that!

355
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
What's happening?

356
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,970
No way, sir.

357
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,980
It's a short-circuit.
The whole thing is damaged.

358
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,480
Kuruvilla sir!

359
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,240
Samuel sir is calling you.

360
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,070
Hey! Just have an eye on them!

361
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,200
Me? - Yeah, right!
As if this is an IAS exam.

362
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,610
Just keep saying 'Hello' at
regular intervals, like this...

363
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,970
Hello!

364
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,700
Kuruvilla, don't you know?

365
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,490
Johnny Peringodan.
- Oh! Yes, I know him.

366
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,370
Of course!

367
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,900
He was a candidate for this
assembly election, right?

368
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
I had lost.

369
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,340
I had voted for you.

370
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,950
That was wasted, right?

371
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,330
That's okay.
There's still time, right?

372
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,940
He is a great fan...
- Sigh!

373
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
Thank you...
- No! No!

374
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,440
Fan of Hareendran sir!

375
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,230
It's okay.

376
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,400
We've been good friends
since childhood.

377
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,870
Is it?
- Yes.

378
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,530
Hari sir knows me.
- How?

379
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,070
I have his number.

380
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,490
I got it from Vazhoor Jose sir,
who works in the movies.

381
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,500
When his movies release, I watch them on
the first day and SMS my opinions to him.

382
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,490
He has replied to me
a couple of times...

383
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,790
... saying 'Thanks'.

384
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Is it?

385
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,420
Otherwise, I don't disturb him
by calling him. Just SMS.

386
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,880
That's not a problem!

387
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,930
He's just tough on the outside.
He's actually soft.

388
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,640
Call whenever you want to!

389
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,450
Well, I don't want to
disturb him like that.

390
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,200
When you meet him privately,
please ask him...

391
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,560
.. if he knows MVI Kuruvilla.

392
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Why not?

393
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,900
Most of the times,
we meet privately.

394
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,060
So, Kuruvilla...

395
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,020
You should do a
favour for Hareendran.

396
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,750
Me?
For Hareendran sir?

397
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,690
What favour is it, sir?

398
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,740
Hey! Due to an emergency, he...
- Sir...

399
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,250
Hey! I'll call you after ten minutes.
Go now.

400
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,260
Immediately...

401
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,790
you should make a driving
licence for him.

402
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,590
It's for some film
shooting purpose.

403
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,610
His licence went
missing somewhere.

404
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,790
I know we're asking you
to break rules, but...

405
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,380
... he needs it urgently.

406
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,900
Is this such a big deal?

407
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,970
That's okay. Just give me an
application form, with an older date.

408
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,710
I'll feed the details of the learner's
test, H test and the road test,

409
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,220
into the computer,
with an older date,

410
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,910
and arrange the licence within 3-4 days.

411
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Is it?
- Of course.

412
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,930
Well... There won't be
any problem, right sir?

413
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,690
What problem?
He is your God, right? Do it!

414
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,870
Kuruvilla, this is the application.

415
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,640
I haven't written the date.
- I'll write it.

416
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Phew! I'm relieved now.

417
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,380
Look, sir.
He's so stylish!

418
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,510
I clicked this on my mobile, when
he woke up and came, one morning.

419
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
Sir...

420
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,850
I know that I'm asking too much!

421
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,040
Please don't misunderstand me
because I'm asking this.

422
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,440
Don't think that I'm asking this as
a reward for what I'm doing now.

423
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,470
You should ask Hari sir to come to
this office, when he gets free time.

424
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,310
That...?
- Well...

425
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,460
If this becomes a talking point,

426
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,910
I can say that sir had come
here to this office, right?

427
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Moreover...

428
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,380
I want to meet Hari sir alone, without
any crowd or people surrounding him.

429
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,730
And it's been a great desire in life,
to click a photo with him.

430
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,310
I don't think all that's
possible, Kuruvilla.

431
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,970
It's okay if it doesn't happen.

432
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,720
But you just try
telling him, sir.

433
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,480
Ask him to come, man!
All of us can see him, right?

434
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,120
Don't have too
much expectations.

435
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,200
But still, I'll try.

436
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'll try.

437
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,990
That's enough.

438
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,190
Not possible, Johnny!

439
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,830
It's true that he's my fan.

440
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,590
When you told me,
I recognized who he is, too.

441
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,280
I keep seeing his messages.

442
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,450
But, if someone asks why I
went to the RTO office,

443
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
what will we say?

444
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,320
There's no road safety symposium or any
inauguration happening there, right?

445
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,260
Do you have to go there
informing everyone?

446
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,920
A small deviation, on your way to
the dubbing studio. Just 2 minutes.

447
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,800
A lightning visit.
Just click a photo! Done!

448
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,030
120!

449
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,130
Wow! Beautiful shot!

450
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,680
Johnny, don't try to pull my leg!

451
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,100
In usual cases, it takes
at least one month.

452
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,180
Learner's test, 'H', road test...

453
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,690
But now, they feed everything on to
a computer, according to dates...

454
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,060
Moreover, he's making all these
adjustments because he likes you, right?

455
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,840
Did I ask you?

456
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,340
Dude, even if someone asks you...

457
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,660
Superstar Hareendran
went to the RTO office

458
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,660
to meet his dear fan, a
motor vehicles inspector.

459
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,490
It would only make
people like you more!

460
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,610
You politicians can't say
no to anyone, right?

461
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,550
You promised as soon
as you heard it!

462
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,950
130!

463
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,840
I haven't promised, brother.

464
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,870
Only if you can!

465
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,230
This usually needs
so many formalities.

466
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,490
To do it within one day...

467
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,050
Your earlier shot
wasn't so beautiful.

468
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,140
Okay.

469
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,060
Tomorrow morning, sharp 10.30 AM.

470
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,190
You should also be there,
at the RTO office.

471
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,950
Kuruvilla, Hari will reach your
office in the morning tomorrow.

472
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,450
Tomorrow?

473
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Yes. At 10.30 AM.

474
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,610
He's particular about punctuality.
You know, right?

475
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Thank you, sir.

476
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:34,570
'If the golden star I'm searching for,
appears before my eyes'

477
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:40,130
'If he puts his hands over my
shoulder and stands with me'

478
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,060
'My heart starts beating faster'

479
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,180
'My hands and legs are trembling'

480
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,730
'And my body starts sweating
really badly, on its own'

481
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,090
'Has my dream come true?'

482
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,810
'Like a flower that
has blossomed'

483
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:02,110
'Have I been blessed with
everything I wished for?'

484
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,410
'I can be a little pompous now'

485
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,920
'With fireworks and crackers'

486
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,870
'Yes, there is a concern'

487
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,200
'Yet this is such a happy day'

488
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,780
'Oh my God'

489
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,590
'What about the shoot?'

490
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,940
Chettan dances really well.

491
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,610
Do you dance?

492
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,300
Nothing like that.

493
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,300
Then we should check that out.
Master, let's do a rehearsal.

494
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Chetta!

495
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,500
'Has my breath stopped?
Am I in a wonderland?'

496
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:10,480
'I am drifting somewhere like a
doll, that's out of control'

497
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,780
'Have I changed completely?
Has the story taken a new turn?'

498
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,270
'This is proof of good times
coming to my doorstep'

499
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,500
'How come the world has set its eyes'

500
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:33,110
'How come the world has set
its eyes on me today?'

501
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,260
Isn't this the car I
used in the movie 'Six'?

502
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,880
Yes. I bought that!

503
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,420
Awesome, bro!

504
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,860
Thank you, dude.

505
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,340
'Has my dream come true?'

506
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,130
'Like a flower that
has blossomed'

507
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,530
'Have I been blessed with
everything I wished for?'

508
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,750
'I can be a little pompous now'

509
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,310
'With fireworks and crackers'

510
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,390
'Yes, there is a concern'

511
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,840
'Yet this is such a happy day'

512
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:18,400
'If the golden star I'm searching for,
appears before my eyes'

513
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:24,030
'If he puts his hands over my
shoulder and stands by me'

514
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,970
'My heart starts beating faster'

515
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,930
'My hands and legs
are trembling'

516
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,990
'And my body starts sweating
really badly, on its own'

517
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,850
'Has my dream come true?'

518
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,560
'Like a flower that
has blossomed'

519
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,780
'Have I been blessed with
everything I wished for?'

520
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,150
'I can be a little pompous now'

521
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,790
'With fireworks and crackers'

522
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,850
'Yes, there is a concern'

523
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,420
'Yet this is such a happy day'

524
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,610
I've left the guest house.
The minister was here..

525
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,930
I'm coming.
Come on!

526
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,030
Let's go! Let's go!

527
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,180
No, sir. It's dubbing. No one can say
such lengthy dialogues in real life!

528
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,630
You're just jealous.
- Started in the morning itself?

529
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,000
Sir, it's 10.20 AM.

530
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,880
Hari Sir is really sharp when it
comes to timing. - Try calling him.

531
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,010
Don't you like him?

532
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,480
No! I don't like anyone.

533
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,530
Great!

534
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,060
Sir...

535
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,150
Who called the media?

536
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,600
It's a habit of these movie stars to
turn everything into a news item.

537
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,410
You needn't be
tensed about that.

538
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
There's no problem.

539
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,570
Don't say one thing.

540
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,400
If they ask about the licence,
don't speak a word!

541
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,700
Why isn't he picking
up the phone?

542
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,590
Hello! Hari!

543
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,450
I'll reach now, dear!

544
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,710
Go fast!

545
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,990
By the way...

546
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,980
He's coming here because
he doesn't have a licence.

547
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,860
Are you sure?

548
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,410
Did you ask? Did you ask properly?
- Yes. The peon told me!

549
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,880
My dear bro!
Dude, ask them to go live, on air.

550
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,340
We'll rock this, definitely!

551
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,730
It's not just the Government...

552
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,600
But even major celebrities don't give
even a dog's value to the public.

553
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,540
News that proves that
is coming out now.

554
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,060
The movie star Mr. Hareendran,
who's also a driving addict,

555
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,390
was driving his cars till date
without a driving licence.

556
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,260
Our reporter Sahin Antony has
discovered this shocking news.

557
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,500
To Sahin's report...

558
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,300
Not just the movie industry,

559
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,090
even the public is aware of Superstar
Hareendran's driving craze.

560
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,280
But the shocking or scary
fact here is that...

561
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,410
he was driving for
all these years,

562
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,570
without a licence.

563
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,960
As you can see here, he has reached the
RTO office, for the learner's test,

564
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,110
prior to obtaining the licence.

565
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,470
Who called these guys here?

566
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,160
He has reached here for the learners' test,
since he doesn't have a licence.

567
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,030
Where did so many
people come from?

568
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,470
Let's ask him more details.

569
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,820
We can expect him to respond
within a few minutes.

570
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,880
Anyway, he is coming out now.

571
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,650
Sir, just one second.
Sir, just one question!

572
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,780
Who told you that I
don't have a licence?

573
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,180
Then why have you come here
for a learner's test now?

574
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,660
Someone has made you misunderstand.
Please.

575
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,130
Is it a problem?

576
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,000
Who told them about all this?

577
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,710
I have no idea!

578
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,100
Sir, you must respond.
The viewers want to know!

579
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,460
If an actor like you don't have a licence,
viewers need to know about it.

580
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,670
Sir, please respond.

581
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,890
Who is this MVI Kuruvilla?

582
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,190
Sir, well...

583
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,750
Are you happy now?

584
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,310
Did your itchiness get cured,

585
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,420
when you invited me here for
those guys to eat me up?

586
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,190
Sir, I...

587
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,640
He is Kuruvilla.

588
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,240
What's wrong with you?

589
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,160
You can get me a licence only if you
bloody bring me all the way here?

590
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Idiot!

591
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,090
After inviting all the
media and declaring that

592
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,880
I'm coming to take your
damn learner's test,

593
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,920
you're standing here, dressed
up, with a gift box?

594
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Fan, it seems!

595
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,300
Did you tell them?
Did you?

596
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,110
That I was called here to
take the damn learners' test?

597
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,430
This is a disgusting complex that
government officers like you have!

598
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,510
When you get someone who's
renowned in front of you,

599
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,690
you make them go in rounds!

600
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,160
You have meat on your
body to feed ten dogs!

601
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,890
And you don't even have common
sense worth even ten cents!

602
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,630
Such a useless...
Oh God!

603
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Uncle...

604
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,760
You don't have to grant me a damn licence.
I'll get it from somewhere else!

605
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
I'm...

606
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
I'm sorry.

607
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,020
Open it!

608
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,070
Sir, did you pass the learners' test?
Did you pass it?

609
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,800
Sir, what happened inside?

610
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,860
As you can see here, something
major has happened inside...

611
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:01,220
A major argument has happened
between our actor and the MVI.

612
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,520
Anyway, we're trying to bring it
to the viewers in a few moments.

613
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,720
Sir, please talk to us!

614
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,630
Sir, just one question.

615
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,710
Move!

616
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,140
Let me ask him!
Why are you being hasty?

617
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,190
Let me ask!

618
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
Get down!

619
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
What?

620
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,350
Get down, I say!

621
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,410
You can drive hereafter only
after procuring a licence!

622
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,040
Who are you to say that?

623
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,020
Motor Vehicle Inspector.

624
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,070
Then, Inspector...

625
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,280
first you go and wear
your uniform and come.

626
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,060
We'll talk after that!

627
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,520
Hey! Kuruvilla!
Did Hari leave?

628
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,860
Yes.

629
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,090
But he will have to come again.
Here, in front of me.

630
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,270
Licence, right?

631
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,180
Tell him that I've kept 15
of them ready, to give him!

632
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,390
Kuruvilla, come.

633
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,150
In a secret investigation led
by Motor Vehicle Inspector Kuruvilla,

634
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,190
it has been proved that
Superstar Hareendran

635
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,880
was driving without a
licence till date.

636
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,100
The incident happened at Kakkanad
RTO office, by around 10.30 AM.

637
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,120
Jesus!
It got this messed up?

638
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,420
He has ruined it!

639
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,960
Hey Panicker!

640
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,470
Your black magic has worked!

641
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,610
Yes!

642
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,820
We're bringing you the visuals
from superstar Hareendran's house,

643
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,420
through Newsline TV.

644
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,180
Don't make a scene by honking!

645
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,980
Stop!
Stop, man!

646
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,270
That other rascal!

647
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,220
Hello!

648
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,260
All the scoundrels have
come here or what?

649
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,020
Disdain from even the
production manager?

650
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,720
Tea.

651
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,500
You'll be served right.
- Disdain from the servant too?

652
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,930
Here he comes.

653
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,830
Go inside!

654
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,550
Disdain again?

655
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,460
She smiled.
Phew!

656
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,740
Kunjali, where is he?

657
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,670
Is he angry?

658
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,510
Dude, actually I...

659
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,040
Ultimate disdain!

660
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,530
Why have you put it on mute?

661
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,700
Turn up the volume.
Let me hear it.

662
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,870
Hareendran had to procure a
driving licence urgently

663
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,160
for the location permission to shoot
the movie 'The Great Dictator',

664
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,750
of which only the climax
portions are yet to be filmed.

665
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:32,140
Hareendran's arrogance that he must procure
the licence within a day at any cost,

666
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:37,000
without going through the legal procedures
of learner's test, H test and road test,

667
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,220
was what agitated Vehicle
Inspector Kuruvilla.

668
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,360
'This defiant behaviour
from the superstar,

669
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,380
would reduce his popularity
among his fans and viewers'

670
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,620
...some film industry people who do not
wish to disclose their names, opined so.

671
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,470
Laugh!
- No.

672
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,770
Why did you stop?

673
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Laugh, I say!

674
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,200
Look at you standing here after humiliating
me and making me a laughing stock!

675
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,130
Despite having so many connections,
including ministers...

676
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,470
I haven't called anyone for
any of my matters till date,

677
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,400
nor have I asked them
to do anything for me.

678
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,580
You came here and promised
to do this yourself!

679
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,480
You'll sort
it out, it seems!

680
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,890
After going to meet my fan, I've multiplied
my popularity manifold, as you can see!

681
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,090
Donkey!

682
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,400
Who's MVI Kuruvilla? Your aunty's son?
- No! No! Never!

683
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,970
Harietta...

684
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,570
Please.

685
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,900
It's nothing.
You go inside.

686
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,480
Go...
- Please don't go.

687
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,520
And you went to please some
minister, at the exact same time!

688
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Bloody donkey!

689
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,970
Hari, please pay attention.

690
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,320
You don't have to consider
our deep friendship.

691
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,780
Blurt out the rest of the abuses
you have in store for me.

692
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,630
That will be a relief for you, at least.

693
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,180
That's enough for me.

694
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,190
Turn up the volume!
- Turn up the volume!

695
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,880
It's not mentioned anywhere
in the Vehicle Act

696
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,620
that it is not applicable
for superstars.

697
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,590
If he wants to procure
a licence now,

698
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,260
he has to come to this RTO office,

699
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,060
and go through all procedures including
the learner's test, H test & road test.

700
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,040
That means, he will have
to come before you again?

701
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,130
It's not mandatory that he
should appear before me.

702
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,070
If I get transferred because of this
issue now, he might get what he wants.

703
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,100
Otherwise, Hareendran must
definitely appear before me.

704
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,500
Why do we have to watch this?
Turn it off!

705
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,680
I have to go and bow
before him, huh?

706
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,740
Let him dream on!

707
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,240
MVI Kuruvilla!

708
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,700
Check if there's a location
where you get permission

709
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,530
without submitting my
licence or horoscope!

710
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,720
That's the only way to shoot the
climax at the time we fixed.

711
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,370
Since the media has
ruined it so much,

712
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,100
whichever RTO office I go to,

713
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,830
I have to go through all these
complications to get the licence.

714
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,290
That would take at least a month.

715
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
I must go to the U.S.,
day after tomorrow.

716
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,400
If there is any location like that,
you better go and find it.

717
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,810
But it should be within 48 hours.

718
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,640
Before he boards the flight.

719
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,550
Otherwise, he will leave only after getting
a licence and shooting the climax!

720
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,990
Sir, it comes under my duty, right?
I'll handle the rest.

721
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,070
Instead, if you take away his
application from me, overtaking me,

722
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,510
I swear, I'll call a press
conference, and reveal everything!

723
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,540
Not necessary!

724
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,620
What if you are transferred?
- Morning, sir!

725
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,450
What say?

726
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:56,810
Should I?

727
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,580
If you transfer me
because of this issue..

728
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,700
If I transfer you?
- I'll resign from this job.

729
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,100
It's been 18 years, sir.

730
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,790
Apart from the
Government salary,

731
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,900
me or my family have not eaten even a
grain of rice made with dishonest money.

732
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,970
The only asset I have
is some self-respect.

733
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,140
No one needs to mess with that!

734
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,550
Even if it is Guruvayoor Keshavan
(elephant)!

735
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,170
Hey Kuru...

736
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,990
I can understand your feelings.

737
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,240
He said something out
of some misconception.

738
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,120
He said that to you,
and not to the TV channels.

739
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,760
After that, he didn't
speak a word about this,

740
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,660
even though the media tried
their best for his response!

741
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
But what about you?

742
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,600
You jumped in front
of the camera,

743
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,950
unleashed all your fury
and put up a grand show!

744
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,200
With that, all your
grief was over!

745
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,810
Sir, I...
- It must be over.

746
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,960
Samuel...
- Sir.

747
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,900
Initiate the further proceedings of
Hareendran's licence application,

748
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
only after informing me.

749
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,010
Sure, sir.

750
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,050
And we found out through
further investigation that...

751
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,670
Hareendran, who
misused his stardom

752
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,190
to illegally procure a driving licence
urgently, was stopped by MVI Kuruvilla.

753
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,540
And that enmity against him led
Hareendran to have such a major outburst!

754
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:13,650
Please take it.

755
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,670
Take it.

756
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,960
We applaud when he explodes at
ministers & collectors in the movies!

757
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,730
But is this like that?
- This is pure arrogance! What else?

758
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,080
He got it back from Kuruvilla,
for his arrogance, right?

759
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,450
My dear Elsa,

760
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,230
we never knew that Kuruvilla who's
always smiling and joking around,

761
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,860
had such a face to him!

762
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,840
My dear Chechi,
I've seen that face so many times!

763
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,430
And my Chettan never does
anything breaking the law!

764
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,930
For him, even Jesus and the New Testament
would come only after that!

765
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,900
What to do!
I...

766
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,360
Remember what I told you, right?

767
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,100
Don't go there and say anything.

768
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,480
Here comes our hero.

769
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,210
What happened, dear?

770
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,150
What happened?
What happened, son?

771
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,550
What am I seeing?

772
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,890
Great job, Kuruvilla.
This is how you should deal with such guys!

773
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,020
You're all over the TV since morning!

774
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,620
He looks really handsome on TV.

775
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,370
Why? Does he look bad in real life?

776
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,840
TV Channels aren't showing that
Hareendran's face even for a second!

777
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:14,920
Of course!

778
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,790
TV channels understood the truth.
That's what!

779
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:21,010
Let people know that there
are such upright officers!

780
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,090
Recently when an M.P. came...

781
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,330
Right, Chetta?

782
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,720
M.P.?

783
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,760
He was throwing so much attitude, saying
that he needs a licence urgently.

784
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,530
Chettan didn't bother
about anything else!

785
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,800
He held him by his collar,
and threw him outside.

786
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:36,870
Is that so?

787
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,300
Back then, since the
channels didn't know...

788
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,030
no one knew about it luckily.

789
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,500
When Papa told him to drive
only after getting the licence,

790
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,190
that Hareendran was
so embarrassed!

791
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,670
Since Hari sir is a movie star,
it became a news.

792
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,670
For a Government officer who
does his job sincerely,

793
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,500
this is very common.

794
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,680
Hey dear...

795
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,140
Heat some water for him.
He must be really tired.

796
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,060
The resistance of an
honest Government officer,

797
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,970
who fights against powerful people,
who challenge our law and order!

798
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,850
How's that?
How's that?

799
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,530
Hey Kottukappally!

800
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,340
Announce a reward of 5 Lakhs
for that Vehicle Inspector.

801
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,180
I'll give you 2.5 Lakhs, man!

802
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,790
The abuses for the rewards declared
earlier, haven't stopped yet.

803
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,860
You make someone
else declare it!

804
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,510
If you want money,
I will give it!

805
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,850
Money is not the problem, man!

806
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,540
Even Oscar awards won't get as much news
value as your reward announcements.

807
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,490
Hey Kottukappally, this is a golden...
- Sir...

808
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,290
The main theatres have started
calling for our movie!

809
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,770
That's because Hareendran's
film got postponed.

810
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,160
That's what!

811
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,260
When his film releases, they give
all the good theatres for his film.

812
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:42,180
And I get only the ones with
stained screens and no sound!

813
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,210
Zaheer...
- Yes.

814
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,280
Tell them to commit only after keeping
them waiting for some time! - Of course!

815
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:47,310
Then what!

816
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,330
So, the reward of 5 Lakhs.

817
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,120
Don't say anything! It's fixed!
Hold this!

818
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,840
Drink it!
It's fixed!

819
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:03,670
What is it?
- See!

820
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,640
Kottukappally's next reward is for
the Motor Vehicle Inspector...

821
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,660
Oh wow!

822
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,580
Rs. 5 Lakhs!

823
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:11,930
Papa, I want a computer!

824
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,680
Oh my God! Let me make a list!

825
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,750
Hey! Just enquire if Suresh Gopi
and Dileep have driving licences.

826
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,510
What if they don't have?
- Kuruvilla!

827
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,130
You've won a bumper, huh?

828
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,110
I need a treat!

829
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,860
Keep the money for a
Scotch whiskey aside.

830
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,150
My dear Menon Chetta...

831
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,430
Government officers aren't
supposed to accept such rewards.

832
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:33,800
We'll lose our jobs!

833
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,350
Even otherwise,
I don't want this money!

834
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,280
Hey boy!
What are you sitting here for?

835
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,570
Get ready & go to school!

836
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,060
He wants a computer now!

837
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,580
As if we have everything else here.

838
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,800
Why are you asking me about it?

839
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,760
Ask the people who
announced the reward!

840
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,720
He has started his journalism
early in the morning itself!

841
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,450
Hari!

842
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,680
Didn't you see?

843
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,640
A reward of 5 Lakhs for Kuruvilla.

844
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,360
This must be that Bhadran's game!

845
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,750
He's the brand ambassador of
Kottukappally's charity programme, right?

846
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,430
Sir...
- What is it?

847
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:11,560
What if we make someone give you
Rs. 10 Lakhs? How's that?

848
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,970
Get lost!

849
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,460
You and your stupid ideas!

850
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,550
Where are you going? To the gym?
- Yes.

851
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,730
The entire media is out
there with X-ray eyes.

852
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,300
Should we create problems
in between that?

853
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,750
So you needn't drive until
this whole issue dies down.

854
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,840
Damn it!
Why did I even think of...

855
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,700
Kunjali!
- He hasn't reached!

856
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,030
He won't be there
when I need him!

857
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,290
Now...

858
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,030
You drive the car.

859
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,120
It's a punishment for
getting me into this fix!

860
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,090
Start the car, man!

861
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,570
Dude, even though I'm
an awesome driver,

862
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,310
I don't really know how to
drive gear-less cars.

863
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,220
Well, if it had gears,
I would have rocked!

864
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,470
You know, right? Don't you remember
getting scared when I went at 160 kmph?

865
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
Give me that key!

866
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,560
I'm not going to any damn place!
Fine?

867
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,700
Bro, can I also come?
- No!

868
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,490
Bro, please give me a chance!

869
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,110
Come on!

870
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,400
Oh no!

871
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,630
Cut! Cut!

872
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,530
What happened?
- Sir, everything was awesome.

873
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,350
But at the end, the
track's edge was visible.

874
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,650
So let's do one more, please.

875
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,560
If everything is okay,
should we do one more?

876
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,360
Can't you smudge it &
sharpen it in graphics?

877
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,260
Sir, we needn't take a risk. Please.
Let's do one more.

878
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,720
Stop gaping & set up
the goons there, man!

879
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,680
Hey!

880
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,210
Let me finish panting!

881
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,030
It's all right, sir.
You take your own time.

882
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,040
I heard that they're looking
for other locations

883
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,550
to shoot Hareendran's
film's climax.

884
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,450
He will leave to America
with his wife tonight.

885
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,690
But if they find another location,
he won't need the licence.

886
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,300
That Vehicle Inspector scoundrel...

887
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,900
When he refused the reward itself,
the issue died down.

888
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,530
How do we get it back on track?

889
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,360
To get it back on track,
there's only that way I told you.

890
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,710
No one will know anything!

891
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,470
That would be really cheap!

892
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,470
So everything you did till now?
What is that called?

893
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,090
Do whatever you want!

894
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,210
Chetta, we are ready!

895
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,660
Shashi Anna, the Jeep will
come till here, right?

896
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,110
Then why do you want
to make me run?

897
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,230
Chetta, if you run in the shot,
it would have a great impact!

898
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,490
There was no impact when you flew,
and he's talking about running!

899
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,560
Chetta, let's do it!
- Ready!

900
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,590
Saravanan, ready!

901
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,060
Oh my God!

902
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,990
When they were thrown out of this house,
they went to the next house?

903
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,240
They must be saluted!

904
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,090
What happened today?

905
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,470
Rice & buttermilk curry for
dinner, which is quite unusual?

906
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,720
I won't be able to have
it for one month, right?

907
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:44,870
That's why.

908
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,770
For one month, you can see something
rarer than this daily, right?

909
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
What's that?

910
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,220
Me.

911
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,450
Hello! Didn't I tell you not
to keep calling like this?

912
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,330
I've come for an urgent meeting.
You want to talk about BATA at night?

913
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,490
Call me in the morning.
Hang up!

914
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,620
Namaste.

915
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,370
Is he about to leave?

916
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:12,970
His flight is at 11 PM.

917
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,520
He needs to reach the
airport at 10 PM.

918
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,680
He is having dinner.

919
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,820
Just tell him.

920
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,560
So you've decided to tell him?

921
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,630
Yes, I've decided.

922
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,540
Don't you have a conscience?

923
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,820
No.

924
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,600
I've left it at home.

925
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,120
It's 9.30 PM.

926
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,570
Don't you have to get ready?

927
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,870
I just have to wear my jeans.

928
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:40,870
Okay.

929
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,730
Didn't I tell you not
to keep calling?

930
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,810
Sir...

931
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,630
He's calling you.

932
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,600
Why have you both
come at this hour?

933
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,820
Have you found a new location?

934
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:55,860
No.

935
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,310
Then?

936
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,310
Let's sit down and talk.

937
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,080
When we came in here,

938
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,660
he asked me,

939
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,290
whether I don't have a conscience!

940
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:14,960
I told him that...

941
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:16,530
I've left it at home.

942
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,060
While working for corporates,

943
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,270
having a heart and a conscience,
is a burden.

944
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,750
What, man?

945
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:26,410
What's with the emotional track?

946
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,210
He will say it himself, sir.

947
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,600
You're already aware of it, sir.

948
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,110
But still, I'm saying it.

949
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,910
I am the regional
Vice-President of NTV.

950
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,280
A salaried officer.

951
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,430
It was me who committed this film,
on behalf of the company.

952
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,680
After charting it for 90 days,
we've shot for 130 days already.

953
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,270
And the climax is still pending.

954
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,120
The planned budget was 15 Crores.

955
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,500
It became 18 Crores now.

956
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,210
He's making it sound like all
this happened because of me!

957
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,800
In films, there will be
many such contingencies.

958
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,240
It might be contingencies for you.

959
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,650
But before the company,
it is my carelessness.

960
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,580
I must finish shooting
the climax of this film

961
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,740
on the dates we had
already planned.

962
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,670
Shoot it!
Who said no?

963
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,120
You find a location first!

964
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,010
I can't find just another
location, right?

965
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:20,170
I should find a location where the hero's
driving licence is not required, right?

966
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,480
What are you saying?
What do you want now?

967
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:30,360
We were promised from Delhi that we'll
get the permit order within 2 days,

968
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,920
if we submit your licence, sir.

969
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:35,330
Since that Vehicle Inspector
made things so complicated,

970
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,900
we will get the driving licence,
only through normal course.

971
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,410
It will take one month.

972
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,100
Still...

973
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,950
We can finish shooting the film
within the dates we planned.

974
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,600
Sir...

975
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,510
Only if you are here this month.

976
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,050
What if I can't?
- You must!

977
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,810
That is my request!

978
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,880
When I committed this film, did you
tell me that I should have a licence?

979
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:14,230
How will I know that a hero who's crazy
about driving, won't have a licence?

980
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,590
Mind your words!
- Harietta!

981
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,700
Just a second.

982
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
Kunjali...

983
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,770
Take out my bags
alone from the car.

984
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,140
She is going alone.

985
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:55,420
You don't need to lose
sleep standing here.

986
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,640
Go home.

987
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,620
Come.

988
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,990
You leave.
I'll take an Uber.

989
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,730
What you saw now were the
visuals of Jagannatha Varma,

990
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,790
a business tycoon, and the producer
of the film 'The Great Dictator',

991
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,650
leaving from
Hareendran's house now.

992
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,170
When he gets together
with Hareendran,

993
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:32,060
it must be to conspire about schemes
to trap the Vehicle Inspector.

994
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,820
Rice-eating Malayalis, who are known for
their common sense, can easily guess that.

995
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,660
'Those who sprinkled gold in
the sky, to kiss the moon'

996
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,650
'Did you see the red dawn
that can topple your arrogant hats?'

997
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,560
Remembering these lines
of the great poet,

998
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,970
expecting that there
will be a new dawn,

999
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,380
I wish you all a good night!

1000
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,280
Listen...

1001
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,250
It would take a couple of weeks
for my tests to get done.

1002
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,350
And the surgery is required only
if there are complications, right?

1003
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,880
Anyway, Alex, Sophie and
all are there, right?

1004
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,290
Hey!

1005
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,600
Your quota for today is over.

1006
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,540
No more for you!

1007
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:42,970
Or let it be.

1008
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,740
No quotas for today.

1009
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,790
You can break the quota!

1010
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:04,510
He slept.

1011
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,300
He slept!

1012
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,530
Hey!

1013
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,540
I'm thinking about
ending all this!

1014
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,060
Don't talk nonsense!
I'm only 32 years old!

1015
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,380
It's not that.

1016
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,220
Hari sir...

1017
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,940
He is an innocent chap.

1018
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,840
Hari sir, it seems!

1019
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,230
All the time!

1020
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,750
You Vehicle Inspector rascal!
Come out!

1021
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,040
You want to mess with our Hari sir?

1022
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,440
Come out!
- What is it?

1023
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,050
I don't know.
- Come out, if you dare!

1024
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,020
The world should know that there
are real men with Hareendran sir!

1025
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,880
Come on!

1026
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,200
Throw and break his windows!

1027
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,840
Shatter his whole house!

1028
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,500
Son, don't come here!

1029
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,180
He's bleeding!

1030
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,940
Hey! Who's that?
- Dude, escape!

1031
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,070
Stop! Stop there!
- Start the car, man!

1032
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,440
Catch them!

1033
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,640
Dude, open it!

1034
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,710
- You wait here.

1035
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,530
You scoundrel!

1036
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,040
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1037
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,300
Who are they? What happened?
- Kuruvilla!

1038
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,400
What's the matter?

1039
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,030
What happened?
- Cover the wound!

1040
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,240
Open that door.
- Who are those people?

1041
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,610
Who are they?
- It must be that scoundrel's people!

1042
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,760
Whose?
- That Hareendran's!

1043
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,910
Make way!
Open the gate!

1044
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,740
Sonny, don't be tensed.
Don't worry.

1045
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,130
Go! Go! Go!

1046
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,850
Son!
Son!

1047
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,330
He's falling unconscious.

1048
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:45,670
It's Hari sir.

1049
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,080
Did you understand who I am?

1050
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,020
I've understood!

1051
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,030
I understood who you
are, only today.

1052
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,860
You haven't understood
a damn thing!

1053
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,300
I've just started!

1054
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,240
Let's start!

1055
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,510
Let's start from scratch!

1056
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:12,710
You start counting!

1057
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,430
I will count!

1058
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,750
But you are the one who's
going to count stars!

1059
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,640
We'll see!

1060
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,180
We'll see!

1061
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,220
Bloody loser!

1062
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,140
Move.

1063
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:03,610
Blocking my way?
- Buddy, can we meet Hari sir?

1064
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,290
Let me meet him first.
I'll tell you after that.

1065
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,770
We've been waiting
here for so long!

1066
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,090
This is too much!
- What's the matter?

1067
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,130
Why are you pushing?

1068
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,970
Stand properly.
All of you will get the news.

1069
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,920
Neighbours say that the
attackers did this as a protest

1070
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:25,120
against the humiliation
faced by their idol.

1071
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:41,860
alleged Kuruvilla.

1072
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,050
Kunjalikka!

1073
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,070
Kunjalikka!

1074
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,250
Kunjalikka!

1075
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,380
Sir...

1076
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,670
Kuruvilla's son was badly injured.

1077
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,440
Kuruvilla says that Hareendran's fans
association workers were behind the attack.

1078
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,110
Around 11.30 PM in the night, Kakkanad
Vehicle Inspector Kuruvilla and family...

1079
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,790
were attacked by a group of
25 people who came in a car...

1080
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:17,180
Superstar Hareendran and DCC President
Johnny Peringodan are allegedly...

1081
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,780
What is this,
in the morning itself?

1082
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,030
Turn it off!

1083
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,930
Kuruvilla's wife, Elsa told the media.

1084
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,230
Though he hasn't responded yet, police
might interrogate actor Hareendran today.

1085
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:29,870
In the stone pelting, all the windows at
the front of Kuruvilla's rented house,

1086
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:31,310
were completely destroyed.

1087
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,770
Kuruvilla's 8 year old son was
badly injured on his head.

1088
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,440
Kuruvilla said that it was Ernakulam
DCC President Johnny Peringodan,

1089
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,340
who led this attack by Hareendran Fans
Association members, coming with them.

1090
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,270
The response of the Vehicle Inspector
that the licence won't be issued,

1091
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,500
might have led Hareendran
to do such a vengeful act.

1092
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,780
Concerned authorities said that
a major investigation is due,

1093
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:53,290
about such a cruel actor from
a superstar like Hareendran.

1094
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,380
How many of them were there?

1095
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,140
There were a few people.

1096
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,310
By few, you mean?

1097
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,030
Around 20-25 people.

1098
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,170
25 people?

1099
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,680
Didn't you say that
they came in one car?

1100
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,770
25 people in one car?

1101
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,090
We don't know whether there was
another car behind that, right?

1102
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,420
Can we count the number of cars,
while we are being pelted?

1103
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,160
You can count the number
of people, right?

1104
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,470
Was there anyone else whom you
could recognize in that group,

1105
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,290
apart from Johnny Peringodan?

1106
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,670
While they took off in the car,
I saw him like a flash.

1107
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,540
I don't know whether
my husband saw him.

1108
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,080
Hareendran was also there,
on the back seat of the car.

1109
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,430
My dear sister, what
do you want now?

1110
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,320
Do you want to catch
the actual culprit,

1111
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,720
or to humiliate Hareendran?

1112
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,610
If your wish is to catch
the actual culprit,

1113
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,400
file a case against Hareendran,
for attempt to murder.

1114
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:33,120
He had called me last
night at 11.30 PM.

1115
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:36,230
He called me 10 minutes
after the incident.

1116
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:38,020
He has spoken to me for
2 minutes as well.

1117
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,190
To call at midnight
and make small talk,

1118
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,870
I'm not married to
his sister, right?

1119
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,010
You can check the call
details if you want, sir.

1120
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,270
Okay.

1121
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:52,390
What did he tell you?

1122
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,430
He threatened me.

1123
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,180
'Did you understand who I am now?'

1124
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,010
'I will make you count stars!'

1125
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,020
'I'll show you'...
and so on.

1126
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:02,610
Okay, Kuruvilla.

1127
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,490
I'll investigate.
- Okay.

1128
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,780
Are you sleeping?

1129
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,820
No!

1130
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,060
Have you slept?

1131
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,170
Yeah! I have slept!

1132
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,610
Hey!

1133
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,750
What's wrong with you?

1134
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,810
How many times have I told you
not to interfere while I am talking?

1135
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,920
Yeah, right!

1136
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,690
Here.

1137
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,280
If you talk in between ever again...

1138
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,210
Sir, discharge is ready.

1139
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,380
What?
- Pay the bill, man!

1140
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,820
You heard, right?

1141
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,820
Out of the anger that he
couldn't go with his wife,

1142
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,640
he thrashed that MVI.

1143
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:40,690
I'm wondering when I'm
going to be thrashed next.

1144
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:45,080
If he has to get a licence now, he'd
have to go to Gokarna or Kanyakumari!

1145
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,520
Anyway,

1146
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,680
I'm going to Mookambika temple now.

1147
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,870
The Goddess there
is my only solace!

1148
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,660
O dear Goddess!
Please help me!

1149
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,870
What are you charting?
Get lost!

1150
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,450
Go! Escape!
All of you!

1151
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,090
There's no movie happening here!
@$%@%

1152
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,610
You said that you'll only throw a couple
of stones to break his window glass,

1153
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,410
and broke that child's head,
you cruel fellow!

1154
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,190
If Hareendran gets agitated
enough to go behind this,

1155
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,850
Police will catch you easily.

1156
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,160
Why are you speaking
in singular?

1157
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,340
Just me?

1158
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,680
Don't try to scare me!
Got it?

1159
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,660
If you say anything like that,

1160
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,600
I'll dismiss you from the fans'
association, pre-dated by one month.

1161
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:24,970
Fans' association?

1162
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,780
That's a gang of my boys!

1163
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,960
We will decide whom we should
be fans of, from tomorrow.

1164
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,320
I didn't become an actor because you
guys made me grow with your fandom.

1165
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,490
This damn fans'
association came later.

1166
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,090
I'll dissolve it.
Bloody...

1167
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,650
I swear on God.
Those are not our boys. They won't do it.

1168
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,570
I can vouch for the fans
from Ernakulam!

1169
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,380
They are great boys! They won't do
anything that would harm you, sir.

1170
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,400
Then who loves me so much,
to do such a thing?

1171
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,860
Papa, I can get down and walk.

1172
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,630
Sir... Sir...

1173
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,690
We said everything we had
to say, to the Police.

1174
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,020
Are you standing by the allegation
that Hareendran is involved in this?

1175
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,170
It's not an allegation.

1176
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,020
Hareendran's people did
this with his approval!

1177
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,340
A case should be charged against
Hareendran for attempt to murder.

1178
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,370
That's all I have to say.

1179
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,390
Do you think the Police
would be ready to do that?

1180
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,650
They must be!

1181
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,760
In case the Police is not ready?

1182
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,830
If they are not, we have
decided what we should do.

1183
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,130
Sir, what have you decided to do?

1184
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:22,810
Until the case is charged,

1185
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,150
we'll go on a hunger Satyagraha in
front of Hareendran's house.

1186
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,970
Madam, is it a Satyagraha
or a hunger strike?

1187
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:36,750
A Satyagraha!

1188
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:42,900
Yes, Bipin.
Things are clear now.

1189
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,680
MVI Kuruvilla &
family have demanded

1190
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:49,090
that a case should be charged against
Superstar Hareendran for attempt to murder.

1191
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:51,720
If the Police is not ready
to charge such a case,

1192
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:55,130
they have decided to go on a hunger
strike in front of Hareendran's house.

1193
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,420
They are going on a hunger strike?

1194
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,260
Sheesh!

1195
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,710
This guy is going over-board!

1196
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:06,080
Sir, isn't this a deliberate attempt
to defame a superstar like Hareendran?

1197
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,340
Never.

1198
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,400
All these are problems faced by
a Government officer like me,

1199
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:12,340
when I try to enforce the law.

1200
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,200
When such a problem happens, the
first thing that such people do,

1201
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,030
is trying to compromise,
by paying money.

1202
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:22,810
I got many offers, connected
to this incident.

1203
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,390
We didn't accept it.
That's all.

1204
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,830
We want justice, not money.
Right?

1205
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:30,230
Sir, are you sure that you'll get
justice through this strike?

1206
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,610
I'll definitely get justice.

1207
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,800
Let me get down.

1208
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,510
Please!
Please!

1209
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,240
Here comes that scoundrel!

1210
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,130
Actually, has Johnny sir...?

1211
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:52,850
Move!

1212
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,580
When he gets drunk, he goes back
to his old shady behaviour!

1213
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:01,910
Moreover, he feels guilty
about that licence case too.

1214
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:07,940
Move!

1215
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,230
I'll tell you.
I've come to talk, right?

1216
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:13,830
What do you have
to say about that?

1217
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,510
I'll tell you. There's time, right?

1218
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,040
Sir! Sir!
What happened...

1219
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:19,030
Move!
I'll settle this, man!

1220
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,750
Wait! Wait!
- Where are you barging in?

1221
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:23,350
He is also a citizen, right?
He also has rights.

1222
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:25,840
Let him talk. Please talk.
- Okay! Please talk!

1223
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:30,410
If you give me money for a
pint of alcohol plus taxes,

1224
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,540
I'll solve all of
Hareendran's problems now.

1225
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,940
But I need to meet
him in person!

1226
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,140
Face to face!

1227
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,910
Move! Please!

1228
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,340
Please make way.

1229
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,360
I'll come back!

1230
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,340
Hey Hari!

1231
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,650
Don't look at me with those CBI
eyes from that movie of yours!

1232
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,760
It's not me.

1233
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:57,400
I don't love you so much that
I'll attack someone at his house,

1234
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,160
forgetting my public life.

1235
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,810
Then where were you
all this while?

1236
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:02,630
Hey! I was coming from Kollam.

1237
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,980
There was a board meeting of the
cashew-nut corporation there.

1238
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:09,270
You imbecile! Then why didn't you
tell the press when they asked,

1239
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:10,710
about the nuts,
Kollam & the meeting?

1240
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,740
Why?

1241
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,150
We have a lot of time, right?

1242
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:17,220
As proof, we have the hotel bill
and minutes from the meeting.

1243
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:23,540
Before that, let them say 'Johnny Peringodan'
a thousand times on all the channels!

1244
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:24,910
Right?

1245
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,970
Ever since I lost the election,

1246
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,570
I haven't created an issue for
people to remember my name.

1247
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:31,610
You see the irony?

1248
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,110
He's playing his dirty
politics in between all this!

1249
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:40,230
It was only due to the political
backing of Johnny Peringodan,

1250
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,560
that Hareendran dared
to do such a crime...

1251
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:51,080
The police has reached Hareendran's house
to question him regarding the incident.

1252
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:54,650
We can see the visuals of the
team led by DySP Joseph Unnyadan,

1253
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,410
going into Hareendran's house now,
through Days Now channel.

1254
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:01,110
Kalamassery SI Babu Paul has also come
along with DySP Joseph Unnyadan...

1255
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,010
You were here, sir?

1256
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,110
I reached in the morning.

1257
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:08,230
What's happening?

1258
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,850
Sir, I am Joseph Unnyadan.
DySP.

1259
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:13,810
Sir, I just need two minutes.

1260
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,090
Shall we talk privately?

1261
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,910
There are many exaggerations
in his statement.

1262
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,000
But there's one thing, sir.

1263
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:25,760
Did you call Kuruvilla on his phone,
last night at 11.28 PM?

1264
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,720
That means, 10 minutes after the attack.

1265
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,020
Can you tell me why
you called him?

1266
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,770
I was ready to leave to
the U.S., last night.

1267
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,450
For my wife's treatment.

1268
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,350
Since this licence issue
became so complicated,

1269
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:47,390
the producer was adamant that I should
stay here, finish the shoot and go.

1270
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,500
And Kuruvilla was rubbing salt to
the wound, in between all that.

1271
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,670
There's no point
hiding it now, right?

1272
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,200
I had boozed a bit last night.

1273
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,020
It's true that I called him
on the phone, and cursed him.

1274
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,480
But apart from that...

1275
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:06,410
Okay sir.

1276
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,320
What action is the association going
to take against Hareendran, sir?

1277
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,500
Hareendran is not just a colleague for us.

1278
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,450
He is Malayalam cinema's
backbone as well.

1279
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,350
If you try to crucify him
in the name of an allegation...

1280
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,120
not just our association,

1281
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,460
but the entire Malayalam film
industry would oppose it.

1282
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,320
These are allegations, right?

1283
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,170
We have a law and the police here, right?
Let them investigate.

1284
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,460
A.M.M.A. association is speaking only
in favour of Hareendran now, right?

1285
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:36,070
Sir, I have to ask you something.
Can you please stop the car?

1286
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,000
Hari, I had called the DySP.

1287
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,600
It's true that the
MVI was attacked.

1288
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,580
And yeah, the case
against you won't stand.

1289
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,530
In fact, I suspect that it's someone
amongst us who played this game!

1290
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,770
I kept quiet because I didn't
want to say it from my mouth.

1291
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,660
No! No! You needn't
intervene in this, Hari.

1292
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,720
I've told the DySP not to
go behind this for now.

1293
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,870
Even if this gets solved, the shame
would be for us, film industry people.

1294
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,260
Hello!
Yes, I've reached here.

1295
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:05,530
I'll give it to Hari.

1296
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,400
It's Innocent ettan (actor).

1297
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,250
Yes, Innocent Etta...

1298
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,040
Hari, when I stood for the elections,
a scoundrel abused me a lot.

1299
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,700
I want to get back at him!

1300
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:17,870
How much do you want
for this contract?

1301
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:21,430
Tell me! - How are you able
to do this, Innocent Etta?

1302
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:24,200
You're making jokes when
my back is on fire?

1303
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,330
What's the issue now?

1304
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:28,700
licence!
You go and get it, man!

1305
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,040
Are you scared?

1306
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:33,190
Which Rishiraj Singh can
beat you at that?

1307
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,770
Go out and deliver a couple
of dialogues to the press.

1308
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,200
In our Renji Panicker's style!

1309
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,630
Why? Should I call
Joshiy to say 'Action'?

1310
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,900
You hang up, Innocent Etta.

1311
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:55,890
Kunjali...

1312
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,680
Open the gate!

1313
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,910
Hari sir!!

1314
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:01,860
Move away! If I see you here again.
I'll break your knees!

1315
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,330
Get lost, man!

1316
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,620
Hey! It's Hareendran!
Let me have a look!

1317
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,410
Don't make noise.

1318
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:17,740
I'll leave only after
answering your questions.

1319
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,850
I'll leave only after
answering all your questions.

1320
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,340
Behind the uproars that have been happening
connecting Kuruvilla & me,

1321
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:28,630
for the past 2 weeks,

1322
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,200
there's something
that you don't know.

1323
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,520
There is a reason.

1324
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,180
Long back, famous singer
John Lennon was shot dead.

1325
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:38,290
It was his die hard
fan who killed him.

1326
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,110
Canadian comedy star Phil Hartman,

1327
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,250
and American actress Rebecca Schaeffer
were also killed by their fans.

1328
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:49,550
Many such attacks that have happened
against celebrities from their fans,

1329
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:50,900
have been reported.

1330
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:56,240
A kind of urge to intervene in the life
of the celebrity whom they admire.

1331
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:02,230
In psychiatry, it is described as a
mental illness called 'stalking'.

1332
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:03,720
That means?

1333
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,100
Dude, 'madness'.

1334
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,690
Mr. Kuruvilla has already admitted
that he is a die hard of mine.

1335
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,770
The messages which he had sent me in
the past two years, are on my phone.

1336
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,070
Great!

1337
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,270
You can verify it.

1338
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,880
The words used in those messages,

1339
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,030
prove the depth of his
admiration towards me.

1340
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:28,650
It is true that I had called Kuruvilla
for the purpose of the licence,

1341
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,910
since he's a Motor Vehicle
Inspector who's known to me.

1342
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,930
It was Kuruvilla who promised me that he
would arrange the licence within 2 days.

1343
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:40,530
Instead, I never requested him
to avoid me from all the tests.

1344
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,260
He wanted to meet me in person, get
introduced and click a photo with me.

1345
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:50,500
I went to the RTO office that day
to fulfill this request of his.

1346
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:53,630
But, when I reached there....

1347
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,940
I could see this condition called
'Stalking' that I mentioned earlier,

1348
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,050
in Kuruvilla.

1349
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,130
Later, he made many statements and
challenges through all the channels.

1350
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,560
Sympathy towards a
patient who's my fan.

1351
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:14,170
I didn't respond to any of that till date,
only because of that.

1352
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,470
And now, this attack that
happened against him.

1353
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,220
How can I respond about
something I have no clue about?

1354
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:31,690
Let the Police investigate.
- Sir, can I ask you something?

1355
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,520
Sir, I have a question.

1356
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:36,560
Sir, in this situation, have you decided
not to procure the driving licence?

1357
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:39,310
Never. I have no other option other
than procuring the licence, right?

1358
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:41,750
The shooting has to happen, right?
- Which RTO office will you choose next, sir?

1359
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:43,950
I have already selected
the RTO office, right?

1360
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,660
I will appear before MVI Kuruvilla sir
himself, for all the tests.

1361
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:01,300
Appearing for tests before someone
who has a grudge against you...

1362
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,620
Isn't it suicidal, sir?

1363
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,840
I don't know that.

1364
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,380
But I have a request regarding
the learner's test.

1365
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,240
.. that it should be made a
question-answer session like earlier.

1366
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:11,140
People who know about
it say that...

1367
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,890
it can be manipulated, if
it's done through a computer.

1368
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:17,050
I've sent a formal request for that,
to the concerned authorities.

1369
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,690
Will the media be able to see
the tests, sir? - Definitely.

1370
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,090
You must see this test.

1371
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,350
Because, the invigilators of this test...

1372
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:24,720
... are you guys!

1373
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,880
If you don't mind,
please make some way now.

1374
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,250
I have to go for dubbing.

1375
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:32,790
Kunjali, don't take the car.
It's just 1 kilometer from here, right?

1376
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,360
Let's walk.

1377
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,750
Move! Move!
Make way!

1378
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:39,900
Move! Please move!
Make way!

1379
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:40,950
See!

1380
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,020
This is called heroism!

1381
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,780
Hey!

1382
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,160
Shall we also leave then?

1383
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:07,890
What do we do sitting here now?

1384
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,960
It's really hot too.

1385
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,480
Get up and get lost, man!

1386
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,840
Are you Mahatma Gandhi to go
on a hunger strike or what?

1387
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,850
Then go to the beach and
make some salt, man!

1388
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:19,620
Hey! That's Edavela Babu (Actor).

1389
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,680
Get lost!

1390
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,840
Let's go!

1391
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,260
Come!

1392
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,000
Will he fail?
- He will fail in the test.

1393
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,400
Bless you!

1394
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:48,610
Give it.

1395
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,290
Well... This?

1396
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,610
What to do with this?

1397
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,340
That's all right.

1398
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:59,510
It's tallied now, right?

1399
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,510
What is it?

1400
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:18,520
He doesn't know the power
of Hareendran's fans!

1401
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,980
We should show it to him!
Come on!

1402
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,450
Hurray Hariettan!

1403
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,520
Excuse me.
Look, Mr. Hareendran. Question No. 1

1404
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,170
How many wheels are there
in a multi-axle bus?

1405
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:30,570
Tell me! Tell me!

1406
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:32,250
That was awesome.
You'll rock it!

1407
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,280
Action!

1408
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,860
I've sprained my leg.
- It's okay. He gets it regularly.

1409
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,190
Are you okay?
- Okay, Master. One minute.

1410
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:41,020
What's happening?
Did you know anything?

1411
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,000
That Kuruvilla will make the
learner's test really tough.

1412
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:44,920
What's the maximum he can
ask for the learner's test?

1413
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,170
Zaheer, you will be there, right?

1414
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,270
I will be in front of the TV.

1415
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,060
All channels will go live
from 10.30 AM, right?

1416
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,070
I've never been so tensed,
even on release dates of my movies!

1417
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,820
Why are you going there?

1418
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,410
If he sees you, it will spoil
his mood & ruin the test!

1419
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:41,200
Hey! Will there be a result for
these four sleepless nights?

1420
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,650
Will he fail?

1421
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:44,470
It's not an IAS exam, right?

1422
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,740
Let him pass.

1423
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,130
But I'll try my
maximum to make him fail.

1424
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,990
There's a huge crowd outside, sir.

1425
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,550
So many people!

1426
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,290
I think he has arrived.

1427
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,370
Kuruvilla!

1428
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,240
Sir.

1429
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,840
Harietta!
Come on! Yes! Yes!

1430
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:06,370
All the best, Harietta!

1431
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:10,770
This side, sir.

1432
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,950
Please sit down.

1433
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,140
Shall I get you something to drink, sir?
- No.

1434
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,110
Good morning, sir.

1435
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,900
Good morning.

1436
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:13,300
Would we have to use the spy camera?
- No! That's not necessary.

1437
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:16,700
Sir, you will be asked 10 questions.

1438
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,790
To pass, you need to
give 6 right answers.

1439
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,810
There will be 3 options
for the answers.

1440
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:21,940
Okay?

1441
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:23,050
Okay.

1442
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,990
Okay, Kuruvilla.
You may start.

1443
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:32,730
Question No. 1

1444
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,220
A motor car...

1445
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:37,460
Listen to the question properly.

1446
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:41,130
How many wheels does
a motor car have?

1447
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,350
Option A

1448
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,100
3 wheels.

1449
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:50,770
Option B

1450
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,320
4 wheels.

1451
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:54,120
Option C

1452
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:55,790
5 wheels.

1453
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,610
He's really crazy, right?

1454
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:00,810
No! There are 5 tyres,
including the stepney, right?

1455
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,290
Oh! Stepney is a must, right?

1456
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:09,030
Mr. Hareendran, if you don't
know the answer, you can say so.

1457
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:10,150
Option B

1458
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:11,740
4 wheels.

1459
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:15,910
Kuruvilla, isn't there a
confusion in that question?

1460
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,790
No confusions, sir.

1461
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:19,150
Option B...

1462
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:20,900
Right answer!

1463
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,920
Question No. 2

1464
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,120
When you are driving,

1465
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:39,230
and you reach a traffic signal,

1466
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:42,870
seeing which colour signal,
would you stop the vehicle?

1467
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,440
Stop.

1468
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:47,860
Answer after listening
to the options.

1469
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,250
Options for the signal
to stop the vehicle.

1470
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,480
A) Sky Blue.

1471
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:55,650
B)

1472
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,990
Parrot green.

1473
01:26:58,110 --> 01:26:59,420
C) Red.

1474
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,550
Kuruvilla...

1475
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:07,770
Can't you give him straight options
such as 'Blue, Red or Green'?

1476
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,670
Instead, Sky Blue.. Parrot Green...

1477
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:12,880
Why add these
unnecessary decorations?

1478
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,560
If a learner's test can
have so many decorations,

1479
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,790
my options can also
have some decorations.

1480
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,140
Tell me, Mr. Hareendran.

1481
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,160
What's your answer?

1482
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,220
Option C.

1483
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:25,430
Red.

1484
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,170
Correct.
Right answer.

1485
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:31,570
The power has gone!

1486
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,230
Smart guy!

1487
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,020
You've learned everything,
missing out on sleep, is it?

1488
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:47,220
I've sorted it out, sir.

1489
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,320
Question No. 3

1490
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:52,160
When you're driving your vehicle
through a gut road,

1491
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,130
someone is standing in
front of you with a bull.

1492
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:57,610
The animal might go out of control if it
hears the sound of the horn or the vehicle.

1493
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,790
Thus, he requests you
to stop the car there.

1494
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:02,140
In such a scenario,

1495
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,390
what's the maximum time

1496
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:07,090
that you are legally obliged to
stop the car and wait there?

1497
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:09,260
Option A :
Two hours.

1498
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,560
Option B :
Four hours.

1499
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:14,100
Option C :
24 hours.

1500
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:21,990
It's four hours.

1501
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:29,130
There are no lifelines or options to
phone your friend here. Say it quickly!

1502
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:30,970
Option B

1503
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,260
Four hours.

1504
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:34,380
Option B :
Four hours.

1505
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,310
Wrong answer.

1506
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,350
The right answer is Option C.

1507
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:48,250
You have to wait up to 24 hours....
- Which law says so?

1508
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:49,380
Silence!

1509
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,320
See, Mister.

1510
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,880
This is an examination.

1511
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,330
If you interfere in this again,

1512
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:01,110
for interrupting him while
he was on official duty,

1513
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:03,100
Kuruvilla sir can charge
a case against you.

1514
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:04,470
Understood?

1515
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:07,540
Ask me, sir.

1516
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,500
Question No. 4

1517
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:29,680
It looks like 'Who wants
to be a millionaire?'

1518
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:32,240
Then do one thing. Change Kuruvilla
and make Suresh Gopi do it.

1519
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:53,330
Since there is a doubt if Hareendran's
answer for the 8th question is right,

1520
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:58,350
Joint RTO Samuel is examining the related
sections of the motor vehicle law.

1521
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:00,000
God, I hope he answers
2 more correctly.

1522
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:02,900
Brothers...

1523
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,940
This is just a 1..2...3 case!

1524
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:06,470
Only two minutes!

1525
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,420
If you give me just two minutes,

1526
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:12,050
this Augusty will solve
Hareendran's current problem!

1527
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:13,860
But... face to face!

1528
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:16,000
You must make me meet
him face to face.

1529
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:18,970
Get lost, you devil.
Already we are screwed here.

1530
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:20,970
Kuruvilla...

1531
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,600
Hareendran's answer is right.

1532
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:24,960
Yaay!

1533
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:32,220
Hareendran's learner's test for the driving
license, is entering its last stage.

1534
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:36,530
As two questions remain, Hareendran
needs to give one more right answer.

1535
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,340
To the live visuals of the test...

1536
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,350
Kuruvilla, come on!

1537
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:48,470
Question No. 9

1538
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:55,210
You have parked your vehicle at the
allotted parking spot on the stage highway.

1539
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,780
To stop the vehicle from being
towed away by the Police,

1540
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,770
thinking that it's an
abandoned vehicle,

1541
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,670
within how many hours should you move the
vehicle, from the place it was parked at?

1542
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,510
Option A

1543
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:10,290
Two hours.

1544
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,860
Option B

1545
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,240
Six hours.

1546
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:15,020
Option C

1547
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:16,980
Twenty four hours.

1548
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,480
Option B

1549
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:25,700
Six hours.

1550
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,790
Option B

1551
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:36,270
Six hours...

1552
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,330
Right answer.

1553
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,150
Hurray Hariettan!

1554
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:51,070
O dear Goddess!

1555
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:07,240
Okay, Mr. Hareendran.

1556
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:09,370
You have passed the
learner's test.

1557
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,600
From today, you can drive a car,
with an 'L' board.

1558
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:17,290
Sit down.

1559
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,170
What, sir?

1560
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,870
One more question is
remaining, right?

1561
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:24,740
The tenth question.

1562
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,170
Ask me.

1563
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,970
Sir, you gave six
right answers, right?

1564
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:31,730
The next question needn't be asked.

1565
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:35,510
What if I don't want to pass
with just the minimum marks?

1566
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,660
Ask the next question, sir.

1567
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,880
To pass with distinction,

1568
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:43,940
you're not trying for
an MBBS seat, right?

1569
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:46,030
No.
It's for Veterinary science.

1570
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:47,680
To treat you, sir.

1571
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:00,420
Stop blabbering and ask the
next question, Kuruvilla sir.

1572
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:04,440
Kuruvilla, ask some random question.

1573
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:14,500
While you are driving, the
hand signal to turn right....

1574
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,440
Option A

1575
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,100
Option B

1576
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,960
Option C

1577
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:28,390
Say it!

1578
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:48,930
Is this an option...

1579
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:51,020
... Kuruvilla sir?

1580
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:11,410
Take it easy.

1581
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:18,950
Hurray Hariettan!

1582
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,240
Hurray Hariettan!

1583
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:22,050
Hurray Superstar Hariettan!

1584
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,750
Move away!
Make way!

1585
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:25,630
Hurray Hariettan!

1586
01:34:25,650 --> 01:34:27,750
Hurray Hariettan!

1587
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,980
Hurray Hariettan!

1588
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:49,130
Come.

1589
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,460
Do you have any alcohol?

1590
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,300
I started early.

1591
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:58,040
Let me see.

1592
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,160
I can't go stand in the queue in
front of the liquor store now.

1593
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,820
I also became a superstar, right?

1594
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,520
And yeah...
Don't scold him, okay?

1595
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,000
Whom?

1596
01:35:20,190 --> 01:35:21,420
Didn't Elsa tell you anything?

1597
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:22,510
No.

1598
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:25,030
Jinto came back from school
at noon itself.

1599
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:26,760
Alone?

1600
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,170
All the kids there mocked
him and booed at him today.

1601
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:34,390
And the incident was live on
all the channels on TV, right?

1602
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,560
Hey kiddo!

1603
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,750
People will boo at us.

1604
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:54,570
They might boo at us again too.

1605
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,370
To win or lose,

1606
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:03,260
this is not a wrestling
competition, right?

1607
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:06,700
Hey!

1608
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:10,440
Now, didn't you see how many
people booed at your Papa?

1609
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,680
But Papa wasn't sad, right?

1610
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:15,340
We should do what we have to do.

1611
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:19,110
You can't defeat him, Papa.

1612
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:23,340
Give him that license!

1613
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:26,870
Otherwise, admit me
in some other school.

1614
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,450
Now my son will go to
school, only after I win!

1615
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:40,530
Okay?

1616
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,060
Hari...

1617
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,660
Hari...
- Yes.

1618
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,900
It's Alex, from the U.S.

1619
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:03,710
Yes, Alex.

1620
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:10,620
By soon, you mean?

1621
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:14,690
Day after tomorrow?

1622
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,830
No! No!
Don't delay it.

1623
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:23,590
I will reach.

1624
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,360
What happened?

1625
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:30,100
I need a ticket to New
York for tomorrow.

1626
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:32,030
Doesn't matter which airline it is.
- What?

1627
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,010
The test results came.

1628
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:36,710
She...

1629
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,720
She has a minor growth...
- Oh God!

1630
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:42,420
It's the surgery,
day after tomorrow.

1631
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,060
You are safe!

1632
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:00,280
I love you, Meera!

1633
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:01,630
I love you a lot!

1634
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,980
You will realize my love one day.

1635
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:11,190
Isn't it okay?

1636
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,660
Sir, it's okay.

1637
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,990
But your chain's locket was clinking,
and that too got recorded.

1638
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:17,060
Oh! Damn it!

1639
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:18,700
Oh Gods!

1640
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:19,840
I take back my words!

1641
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,200
Ready!
One more!

1642
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,390
Shall we go for a take, sir?

1643
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,060
Or keep it as an 'Okay' take.

1644
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,470
What is it? - Manoj, can you
remove the sound of that chain?

1645
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:33,740
I am at the dubbing theatre.

1646
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:35,170
I miss you badly!

1647
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,040
[kisses]

1648
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,900
I love you!
- I love you too!

1649
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,860
Can't he talk after moving
away from the microphone?

1650
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,550
He doesn't have the
brains to do that!

1651
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:47,110
Anyway, we got three
kisses for free, right?

1652
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,630
I'll call you.
Let me finish dubbing.

1653
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:50,930
I'm waiting, dear.

1654
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:53,120
Okay. Play the next one.

1655
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:56,210
Okay, play.

1656
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:01,380
Ready!
Okay! Take!

1657
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,790
Meera!

1658
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,420
Isn't it okay?
- It's okay, sir.

1659
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,060
But shall we do one more?
- Hey! Hey!

1660
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,600
Don't sit there and
mock me, okay?

1661
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:19,150
If you can, come here and cry.
Then you'll know how hard it is.

1662
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:20,540
Stop, dude.
He'll mess things up.

1663
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:21,650
Ready!

1664
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,190
Here comes the next kiss!

1665
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:26,940
Sir...
- What is it?

1666
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,810
His road test & ground test
are happening tomorrow.

1667
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,110
If he passes,
he'll go to America in the evening.

1668
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,540
If we have to do something,
we should do it now.

1669
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:34,790
That's too risky!

1670
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,540
The earlier one's tension
hasn't gone yet.

1671
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:37,890
Why are you getting scared, sir?

1672
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:40,500
Police has forgotten about the stone
pelting case! You needn't know anything.

1673
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:41,740
We will handle it.

1674
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,290
Just give us cash to do it.

1675
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:44,570
What do you say?

1676
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,710
So it was this scoundrel
who got that done?

1677
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,760
Okay.

1678
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:52,290
Execute this plan only if you
feel that he will pass the test.

1679
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:53,980
Okay.
I'll call you later.

1680
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,240
Shall I set up everything then?

1681
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:57,660
I said I'll call you, right?

1682
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:04,630
Okay, ready.
Shall I cry?

1683
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:07,230
Let's see, sir.
You might have to cry again!

1684
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:13,200
Harietta, the flight is at 7.30 PM, right?

1685
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:15,720
So shouldn't you report
at least by 6 PM?

1686
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,380
Maximum 5 PM.
Office hours are only till then.

1687
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:20,770
Road test and the H test,
would be done by then.

1688
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,550
When you open your eyes after
your sedation, I'll be there.

1689
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:26,090
Will he complicate things, Harietta?

1690
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:27,450
What complication?

1691
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:29,450
This is driving, right?

1692
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:30,860
He will go mad.
That's all!

1693
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:34,260
When it comes to the road test,
he decides the right and wrong.

1694
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,160
Did I ask you?

1695
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:40,890
Kunjalikka...

1696
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,670
He went that side.

1697
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,040
You don't be tensed,
hearing what he said.

1698
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:48,410
I will come.

1699
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,530
Okay.

1700
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:58,560
Who told you all this, Kunjalikka?

1701
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:01,350
Road test will have its own
rules and regulations.

1702
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,560
Have you taught in
a driving school?

1703
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:04,890
Have you?

1704
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:06,710
I have taught... for five years!

1705
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:09,530
Such rascals take out their grudge,
during the road test!

1706
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,930
While stepping on the clutch on a
slope, it went back 2 inches...

1707
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:13,500
While taking reverse,
it went to @%@@^

1708
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,550
If he messes with you tomorrow,

1709
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,210
I swear to God,
I'll thrash him!

1710
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,730
You don't have to drive hereafter.
I will drive.

1711
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,330
Hurray Hariettan!

1712
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,770
Hurray Hariettan!

1713
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:37,220
Hurray Hariettan!

1714
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:41,840
I need to meet Hareendran and talk to him!

1715
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:46,600
Don't lift me up!

1716
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:50,790
Hareendran, if you give me money
for a pint, we can solve this!

1717
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:36,670
Thanks.

1718
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,400
Hello!

1719
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,330
Sir, all the best! Go ahead!
- Thank you.

1720
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:01,840
Morning, sir.
- Morning!

1721
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:06,550
Sir, I don't think we can let
him participate in the test.

1722
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:09,890
Why Kuruvilla?
What's the problem?

1723
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:13,020
He doesn't have the paper of participation
in the road safety awareness class.

1724
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:14,750
Well... that...

1725
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:15,940
That?

1726
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,280
Isn't that necessary?

1727
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,330
What paper are you
talking about, sir?

1728
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,990
Mister, after the learner's test, the 2nd
stage is the road safety awareness class.

1729
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:27,420
A one-hour class conducted
by the department.

1730
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,510
Only if he has the paper proving
his participation in that,

1731
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,790
I can allow him to
take the ground test.

1732
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,790
I had noticed.

1733
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,560
I didn't see you in
the last class, sir.

1734
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:36,650
Last... bloody!!
Sir, he's doing this on purpose!

1735
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,880
It's not purpose, sir.
It's a Government notification.

1736
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,140
Let the referee say otherwise!

1737
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,450
Sir, is it right or wrong?

1738
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,100
Well, that...

1739
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:47,090
according to the
Government notification...

1740
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,120
Kunjali...

1741
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:49,380
Let's go.

1742
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,760
Or let's close our eyes
this one time, right sir?

1743
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:54,630
Though it was without a licence,

1744
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:56,650
he has been driving
a lot, right?

1745
01:43:58,420 --> 01:43:59,420
Okay.
Admitted.

1746
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:00,730
Which is the car?

1747
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:02,450
That one.

1748
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:05,210
Come.
Let me check.

1749
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:16,920
Sit down, sir.

1750
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:21,830
Do all applicants get chairs to sit?
- Well... No!

1751
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:31,900
Step on the accelerator.

1752
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:43,290
Sir, this car can't be used.

1753
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:44,870
Hello!

1754
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:47,880
What's wrong with this car?
- Fog lamp is not allowed. - What?

1755
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,690
Fog lamp is not allowed!

1756
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:56,540
What is this, Kuruvilla?
- Done?

1757
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:57,590
Not done.

1758
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:59,090
This car's sound is high.

1759
01:44:59,110 --> 01:45:00,590
Higher than 80 decibels.

1760
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:01,970
Did you weigh the sound?

1761
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,160
Then you do one thing.

1762
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:06,050
Take the car to a place where its sound
is weighed & bring a paper from there.

1763
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,970
That it's lesser than 80 decibels.
He can take the 'H' test after that.

1764
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:11,970
Kuruvilla, what utter
nonsense are you saying?

1765
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:13,530
This is such a nuisance!

1766
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:16,390
Do you have any other car?

1767
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:17,610
Yes.

1768
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,270
I'll bring it in ten minutes.
- No.

1769
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:20,550
Is that your car?

1770
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,530
Yes.
- Bring that car here.

1771
01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:24,930
Driving school's car is fine.

1772
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:28,110
But I need to see a paper proving that
he attended classes there for 30 days.

1773
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:30,030
Him and his...

1774
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:34,230
I'm buying this car of yours.
You can quote any price. What say?

1775
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:37,490
Okay.

1776
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,030
The car is ready.
Now?

1777
01:45:42,150 --> 01:45:43,150
Okay.
Bring it.

1778
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:47,480
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1779
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:50,150
Is Kuruvilla being nasty?
- He's getting angry for no reason, sir.

1780
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:51,760
He's going to take
the H test now.

1781
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:58,140
Kuruvilla!
- Hari!

1782
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,150
'Not fit for the road
test', it seems!

1783
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:01,870
Sir, didn't I tell you that
he's doing this on purpose?

1784
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:04,140
What was the problem?
Didn't he take the 'H' correctly?

1785
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,560
Kuruvilla!
- Sir...

1786
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:06,710
What is the reason?

1787
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:08,200
I'm also watching everything here.

1788
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:11,890
Sir, reason 1 - when the car moved,
the wheels were not in uniform motion.

1789
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:14,160
Reason 2 - when he
shifted to reverse gear,

1790
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:16,450
his look went to the gear
lever, for a second.

1791
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,410
Reason 3 - After taking the 'H'
test and stopping the car,

1792
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,730
the wheels are not in
straight position. See!

1793
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,050
You check all these always, right?

1794
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:30,510
It is to drive a car,
and not an airplane, right?

1795
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:31,760
Fit for the road test.

1796
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:37,730
Get Samuel on line.

1797
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,640
Samuel on line, sir.

1798
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,980
You should also be there for the road test.
- Roger, sir.

1799
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,460
Move the car.

1800
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:50,960
Next!

1801
01:48:52,430 --> 01:48:53,450
Kuruvilla!

1802
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:56,350
The rest of the ground tests can
wait until his road test is over.

1803
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:58,800
Sir, they have also been
waiting here since morning.

1804
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:01,010
What privilege does he have,
that they don't?

1805
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:03,190
He'll be a superstar on the screen!

1806
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,570
Kuruvilla!
- No!

1807
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:07,080
I don't need any special privilege.

1808
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:08,900
I'll wait.

1809
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:11,740
There he goes...
You...

1810
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,060
Bring it, man! Should I
wait for your convenience?

1811
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:30,460
I thought he would take out his
grudge only during the road test.

1812
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:34,700
If he's like this during the H test,
do you think he'll spare you on the road?

1813
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:38,790
He shouldn't spare me.

1814
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,530
No.
It's not done yet.

1815
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:50,360
Left out to dry!
Bloody coconuts!

1816
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:52,640
Not coconuts!
Me!

1817
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:56,250
Sir, usually only 30 people are
called to the ground for the test.

1818
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:58,520
Today he has called around 58 people.

1819
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,710
So it's sure, right?

1820
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:03,080
He's planning to make Hari sir wait in
the sun till 5 PM, and then send him away!

1821
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:05,830
If he does that, I don't care if you
beat me to death with your Lathi...

1822
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:07,550
I'll leave from here,
only after thrashing him!

1823
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:10,500
Even otherwise, he deserves a couple
of rounds of thrashing! - Yes!

1824
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:14,180
No.

1825
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:20,060
That's not right.
Next.

1826
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:23,370
That's not needed.

1827
01:50:24,450 --> 01:50:25,750
Let's continue after some time.

1828
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:34,240
Break!

1829
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,280
Break?

1830
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:37,530
Shall we have food?
- No.

1831
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:39,750
Shall I bring the
food here then?

1832
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:41,420
Didn't I say no?

1833
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:51,390
Dude, Hari sir has not eaten food.
He also shouldn't eat!

1834
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:53,400
Don't let him go!
Block him!

1835
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:55,230
Block him in front.
Don't let him go!

1836
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:57,470
Move!

1837
01:50:57,490 --> 01:50:59,760
Sir, our Hariettan has not had food.

1838
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:02,040
So this scoundrel also shouldn't
eat until the test is over.

1839
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,580
Eating or not eating,
is each person's choice.

1840
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,190
It may be! But if this rascal comes
out before the test is over,

1841
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,950
we'll beat him to death.
No one should eat!

1842
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:10,180
Hurray Hariettan!

1843
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,630
Make way!

1844
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,340
Hail Hariettan!

1845
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,510
Hail Hariettan!

1846
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:15,960
Hail Hariettan!

1847
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:17,400
Hail Hariettan!

1848
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:18,660
Hail Hariettan!

1849
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,020
Hail Hariettan!

1850
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:21,230
Hail Hariettan!

1851
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,670
Hail Hariettan!

1852
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,410
Hail Hariettan!

1853
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:28,960
Hail Hariettan!

1854
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:31,320
Kuruvilla, people are all turning violent!

1855
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:32,770
Make him pass somehow.

1856
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,500
Or all of them will
thrash us, as well.

1857
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,140
Give me the paper.

1858
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:48,180
You can come day after
tomorrow for the road test.

1859
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:49,490
There won't be time today.

1860
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:52,210
So you didn't hear what I said so far?
- One minute.

1861
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,310
I'm not procuring the
driving licence.

1862
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:20,020
I'm never going to drive again!

1863
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,800
Kunjali...

1864
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:25,600
Start the car!

1865
01:52:45,090 --> 01:52:46,090
Break it, guys!

1866
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:15,460
The issue about my
driving licence...

1867
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,320
... is ending today.

1868
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:18,840
Hereafter,

1869
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,300
it won't be a news for you.

1870
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:25,570
I wasn't driving for all these
years without a licence.

1871
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:27,740
After acting,

1872
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:30,640
the thing that I enjoy the most,
is indeed driving!

1873
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:34,190
When I lost the licence I
had given for renewal,

1874
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:36,220
I applied for a duplicate licence.

1875
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:39,200
Since the RTO office didn't
have the old records,

1876
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:42,080
I was told that they can't
give me a duplicate licence.

1877
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:46,030
The only other option was
to take a new licence.

1878
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:51,010
From the day my application
was filed before Kuruvilla,

1879
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:53,610
till today, until this
ground test got over,

1880
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:55,420
you've seen everything
that has happened.

1881
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:58,890
Now I only have the
road test to clear.

1882
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:03,280
Apparently, due to lack of time...

1883
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,570
my road test has been postponed
to day after tomorrow.

1884
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:11,700
I've heard many people saying
that 'Cinema is my life'.

1885
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:14,760
But my life is not cinema.

1886
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,360
It's my family.

1887
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:17,870
My wife!

1888
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:26,490
Acting and driving are just two things that
I love a lot, and can never get enough of.

1889
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:31,450
It was while I was getting ready to
go abroad for my wife's treatment,

1890
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:34,510
that my producer became adamant
that I should get the licence,

1891
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:35,950
finish the shooting
& then leave.

1892
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:41,590
Tomorrow, my wife is going
to face a very critical operation.

1893
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:44,000
So...

1894
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,060
I must go to the U.S.

1895
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:49,350
Even otherwise,

1896
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,350
after going through all this humiliation,

1897
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,160
another road test?

1898
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:54,450
I don't want that.

1899
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:57,610
One man who uses his
power of authority,

1900
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,360
in the life of another man,

1901
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:00,880
whoever it may be...

1902
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04,160
This is a prime example of
how that man can intervene!

1903
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,990
Anyway, I have decided one thing.

1904
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:11,760
I don't want the driving licence.

1905
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:16,590
I'm letting go of my
love for driving.

1906
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:19,850
Naturally, the shooting
would get stalled.

1907
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:23,190
It's a movie for which Crores
have been spent already.

1908
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:27,020
The money spent,
and its compensation...

1909
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,330
I will pay it back to
the producer myself.

1910
01:55:30,150 --> 01:55:35,480
Now, if there is a case or controversy as
a result of this, in the cinema field,

1911
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:39,560
I will let go of my main
love - acting, as well.

1912
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:45,040
That's all.

1913
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:46,690
Kunjali, start the car.

1914
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,020
After creating all the problems,
what are you looking at?

1915
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:50,570
Escape if you don't
want to get hurt!

1916
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,370
We should finish him today!
- Run!

1917
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,200
Run, sir!
Run through the field!

1918
01:55:54,230 --> 01:55:55,940
Let's break his legs!
Let's kill him!

1919
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,650
This earth doesn't need him!
Move!

1920
01:55:57,670 --> 01:55:58,890
Open it!

1921
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:00,340
Move away!

1922
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:02,960
Move!

1923
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,450
Kunjali, stop the car.

1924
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,560
Policemen are there, right?
They will handle it.

1925
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:25,870
Stop the car, I say!

1926
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:43,270
Move away!

1927
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:54,230
Move! Move!

1928
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:55,550
Move, I say!

1929
01:56:56,010 --> 01:56:57,660
Move! Move!

1930
01:56:57,940 --> 01:56:59,940
Hey! Move!
- Beat him to death!

1931
01:57:00,490 --> 01:57:02,370
Kill him! Finish him!
- Leave him!

1932
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:05,140
Leave him, I say!
Get up! Come!

1933
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,250
We're going to kill him, Harietta.
- Don't touch him.

1934
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:09,900
Move!

1935
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:11,220
Beat him to death!

1936
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:15,280
Harietta, he's a member of our
fans association. Don't hit him.

1937
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:18,330
Have you guys gone crazy?
Don't you dare touch him!

1938
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:19,380
Move!

1939
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:20,990
Move, I say!

1940
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:22,020
No!

1941
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:23,040
Don't touch him!

1942
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:27,370
Please!

1943
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:57,150
Get inside, man!

1944
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,220
Kunjali, speed up!
Let's go!

1945
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:52,130
All this...

1946
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:55,330
I didn't think all
this would happen this way...

1947
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:57,610
while speaking like
that over there.

1948
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:01,170
I was expecting this, ever
since you spoke there.

1949
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:08,380
Do you want to go to a hospital?

1950
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:09,530
No.

1951
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:13,120
Where do you want to get down?

1952
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:15,690
Panangad.
Go to my house.

1953
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:19,010
No!. I'll drop you at the
next junction. Go on your own from there.

1954
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:22,590
Hello!

1955
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:23,780
Hello!

1956
01:59:24,170 --> 01:59:27,840
Hey! Pack some clothes and
come outside the house.

1957
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:30,800
- Where are you now?
- Do what I say.

1958
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,100
Don't forget to take my shoulder bag.
- Okay.

1959
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:35,760
I'll come now.
- Okay.

1960
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:43,080
You saved me and
became a hero, sir.

1961
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:46,120
But who will save them?

1962
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:48,830
Would the people spare them?

1963
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:57,320
Ever since the learner's test got over,
I haven't been able to step outside.

1964
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:01,130
It's been two weeks since
my son went to school, sir.

1965
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:04,710
His hero is not you.
It's me.

1966
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,260
Get down.

1967
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:35,300
Kunjali, go to Panangad.

1968
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:55,690
Don't worry, sir.

1969
02:00:56,270 --> 02:00:58,320
This is not 'Stalking',
like you said.

1970
02:01:00,710 --> 02:01:04,300
I used to admire you so much and
you became my enemy so quickly.

1971
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:12,160
Self-respect is a kind of poison, sir.

1972
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,920
Once it gets to your head,
you're done for.

1973
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,020
We should let it remain
in the heart itself.

1974
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:25,050
Chetta, first left.
Then right.

1975
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:34,470
When you came to the
office for the first time,

1976
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,620
I had a gift box with me, right?

1977
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,440
Inside that...

1978
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:43,700
... it was your licence, sir.

1979
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:13,920
Get in.
- Were you beaten up badly, Chetta?

1980
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,330
Get in through the front door.

1981
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:18,520
Get inside.

1982
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:33,230
Well...

1983
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:34,560
Where to, next?

1984
02:02:35,130 --> 02:02:36,170
Drop me at the junction.

1985
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:37,550
From there,
I'll go to Coimbatore.

1986
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,230
I have an elder brother there.
- Sheesh! Are we going there?

1987
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:44,570
Can you keep quiet, please?

1988
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:49,510
Shall I drop you here?

1989
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:52,280
Chetta, go a little forward and stop.

1990
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:55,240
Stop at an area where there
are not many people.

1991
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:03,670
I don't want to get beaten up
in front of my wife and child.

1992
02:03:13,230 --> 02:03:14,230
Sir...

1993
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:18,310
It's been a long time desire.

1994
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,370
Can I click a photo with you?

1995
02:03:37,170 --> 02:03:38,170
Hey! Click a photo.

1996
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:39,440
I'm also coming.

1997
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:48,900
Sir...

1998
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:51,300
Didn't you say earlier...

1999
02:03:52,190 --> 02:03:53,690
... that you're going
to stop acting?

2000
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,960
I know that it must be because
you're burning inside.

2001
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:00,130
But...

2002
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:04,030
... don't say that even if it's
out of bitterness, sir.

2003
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:09,120
Click!

2004
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:34,730
Yes, Babu.
- It's not Babu.

2005
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:36,120
You heard, right?

2006
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:37,590
DySP had called me.

2007
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:40,850
Kuttetta, I swear..
I have no idea about this.

2008
02:04:41,050 --> 02:04:43,640
It was my fans who did it.
They act according to their own will.

2009
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,470
You being aware of it or not...
Let it be.

2010
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:49,400
If the channels shouldn't know this, you
should reach Hari's house right now.

2011
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:51,010
I'm on my way there.

2012
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:15,720
My dear Hari, what Himalayan
blunder did you say?

2013
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:17,410
That too, to the press?

2014
02:05:17,490 --> 02:05:19,000
You're going to stop acting, huh?

2015
02:05:19,330 --> 02:05:20,680
Can you decide that on your own?

2016
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:22,300
We should also allow that, right?

2017
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:24,710
Hey! I had called that producer.

2018
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,420
Now he's saying that you can
do it whenever you can.

2019
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:28,630
Tea.

2020
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:30,710
Chetta..

2021
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:33,690
No.

2022
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,220
Isn't this that devil's wife?

2023
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:42,980
Yes.

2024
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:53,080
Well, a twist in the climax,
is a weakness for me, right?

2025
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,330
Hari, that DySP had called me.

2026
02:05:58,590 --> 02:06:01,010
He had called me too.
- Police caught your Zaheer, right?

2027
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:03,180
Those unruly rascals did
something on their own.

2028
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:04,850
I swear, I didn't know about it.

2029
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:06,500
Hari, please don't
put me in trouble.

2030
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:08,850
To put you in trouble,
I'm not the complainant, Bhadran.

2031
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:10,070
It's Kuruvilla.

2032
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:12,740
Namaste.

2033
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:16,120
Hari! Bro!
Did you know?

2034
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:19,230
That bloody pig Bhadran's fans were the
ones who attacked Kuruvilla's house.

2035
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:20,260
Is it?
- Yes.

2036
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:24,130
Hello!

2037
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,760
Like that, do you
know something else?

2038
02:06:25,780 --> 02:06:28,990
I entered politics by getting inspired
seeing his movie 'Dirty Minister'.

2039
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:31,860
I still get goosebumps when
I think about that movie.

2040
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:32,960
Let the hair remain there.

2041
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,620
The first day I went
to the RTO office,

2042
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,590
who informed the press?

2043
02:06:37,610 --> 02:06:38,860
That Vehicle rascal!
Kuruvilla!

2044
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:39,910
What?

2045
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:46,620
When did you come?

2046
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:47,660
Are you doing good?

2047
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:48,700
Didn't you say something?

2048
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:49,970
Oh! That?

2049
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:52,540
That was me... but I didn't
tell them about the licence!

2050
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:55,980
And you know that I don't let out
secrets between us friends, right?

2051
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:57,220
That's it!

2052
02:06:58,030 --> 02:06:59,390
Is anyone else coming, bro?

2053
02:06:59,850 --> 02:07:02,390
What is it, Kunjali?
Razak had called from the airport.

2054
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:03,880
Flight has been
delayed by 1.5 hours.

2055
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:04,910
Rain...

2056
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:06,340
It's all right.
Let's leave.

2057
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:09,800
There will be traffic. - That's okay.
I'll go in front with lights on.

2058
02:07:10,490 --> 02:07:12,460
Hareendran sir, we are here.

2059
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:14,340
We are here, Hareendran sir.

2060
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:15,990
Move!
Move!

2061
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:17,770
Chetta, please move!

2062
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:21,880
I have to reach the airport by 6 PM.

2063
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:23,030
But one thing.

2064
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:24,500
I'll tell you one thing.

2065
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:29,990
I know very well that there's no compulsion
that Malayalam cinema needs me.

2066
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:34,500
But whatever it is...

2067
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:36,600
I want Malayalam cinema.

2068
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:40,450
Sir... Sir...

2069
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:42,880
You meant that you'll
continue acting, right?

2070
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:45,810
How can I be more clear in
explaining this, my friend?

2071
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:47,240
I will continue to act!

2072
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:53,280
Sir... Sir...
One more question.

2073
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:56,170
Kuruvilla & family, whom you took
in your car... Where are they now?

2074
02:08:04,150 --> 02:08:07,090
What miracle happened
here within one hour, sir?

2075
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:10,740
Well, countries go to war with each
other for no particular reason, right?

2076
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:12,200
It gets over like that also.

2077
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:15,460
Your fans were ready to beat up
Kuruvilla, out of their love for you.

2078
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:17,730
So won't your new attitude
towards Kuruvilla worry them?

2079
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:19,430
These fans are your strength, right?

2080
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,640
Why do you have so much disdain
while talking about fans?

2081
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:23,830
I am also a fan.

2082
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:27,140
I'm a fan of Mammootty,
Mohanlal and Amitabh Bachchan.

2083
02:08:28,850 --> 02:08:30,530
Whichever actor's fan you may be,

2084
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:33,960
that job is not to earn bread & butter for
the family or to get their sisters married.

2085
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:37,550
I can't maintain this love from them,
by keeping them on my payroll too.

2086
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:42,300
I don't feel any shame in admitting
that, that love is my strength.

2087
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:44,520
They will understand that.

2088
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:49,660
Sir... Johnny Peringodan...

2089
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:52,050
Sir, you are a natural actor
and you've won many awards.

2090
02:08:52,070 --> 02:08:54,760
But now, this situation which
is completely unnatural,

2091
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:56,600
aren't you acting to
make it convincing?

2092
02:08:57,370 --> 02:09:00,120
All the awards I won,
were for my acting in movies.

2093
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:02,870
But I am a bad actor, in real life.

2094
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:06,720
If we could win awards
for acting in real life,

2095
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:09,650
people who should win Oscars,
are amidst us.

2096
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:20,640
Even if my acting is natural or not,

2097
02:09:20,910 --> 02:09:22,900
it isn't part of my nature
to act in real life!

2098
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:24,900
Please make way.

2099
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:26,720
I have to leave now.

2100
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:27,980
Please make way.

2101
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,870
Going to airport is not a small thing.

2102
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:31,730
Are you going to drive
without a licence, sir?

2103
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:33,630
Move!
Please make way!

2104
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:35,920
Sorry! I did it out of a habit.

2105
02:09:36,350 --> 02:09:37,690
Kunjali, start the car.
- Move.

2106
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:39,060
Move!

2107
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:40,550
Move!
- Mr. Hareendran!

2108
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:42,130
Who's that?
Move!

2109
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:43,630
Leave him.
- I have to tell you something.

2110
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:46,330
Mr. Hareendran, you
should drive yourself.

2111
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:47,880
What is your problem?

2112
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:49,610
A licence!

2113
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:51,010
That's all, right?

2114
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:53,410
Here you go.
Keep this.

2115
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:57,280
Mister, how can I drive
with your licence?

2116
02:09:57,310 --> 02:09:59,590
Oh no! Check whose licence it is.

2117
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:00,980
Check!
Look!

2118
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:02,930
Look!
Look!

2119
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:06,860
The auto consultant who took your
licence to get it renewed...

2120
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:07,920
Who is that?

2121
02:10:08,810 --> 02:10:11,160
Moses.
- Yeah! Moses!

2122
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:15,690
The only father of that Moses,
as per my knowledge.

2123
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:16,800
That's me!

2124
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:19,150
I suffered all this shoving
and pushing from the crowd,

2125
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:21,710
to come and give this
to you directly.

2126
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:24,480
And not because I'm a fan of yours!

2127
02:10:24,570 --> 02:10:26,730
What are the new
actors doing now?

2128
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:28,390
[makes mocking noises]

2129
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,300
Natural acting!

2130
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:31,330
New gen, it seems!

2131
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:32,890
Aren't you guys ashamed?
Here. Hold it.

2132
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:36,720
Can you give me a 'Thanks' at least now?
- You should be given a slap!

2133
02:10:39,550 --> 02:10:40,650
Thanks.

2134
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:43,530
So I can drive now, right?

2135
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:45,160
I got it.

2136
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:46,610
My driving licence.
