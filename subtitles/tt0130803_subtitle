00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:38,662
"I am Jhumroo.
I'll roam like an ankle bell."

4
00:00:38,702 --> 00:00:42,644
"I sing the song of love."

5
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:47,378
"I have my eyes on my destination.
I don't care about the world."

6
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:51,668
"I bury the past in dust."

7
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:56,180
"I am Jhumroo.
I'll roam like an ankle bell."

"I bury the past in dust."

11
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:31,182
"I am Jhumroo.
I'll roam like an ankle bell."

12
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:35,425
"I don't have any companion
nor a caravan with me."

13
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:40,011
"I am simple and innocent.
I have a prince's heart."

14
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:44,330
"The land and sky belongs to me."

15
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:08,727
"I am Jhumroo.
I'll roam like an ankle bell."

16
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:13,763

my heart for everyone."

17
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:17,416
"I love every human being. I
sacrifice myself for loving people."

18
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:21,864
"I live for life."

19
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,930

23
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:39,595
Oh!

24
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:48,389
Excuse me.

25
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,625
I've been waiting for you.

26
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:51,314
Sorry?

27
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,691
I mean, not here.

28
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:53,924
- Let's go there.
- Shut up!

29
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:56,347
Anjana.

30
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:57,863
Brother.

31
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:02,781
Did you happen to see a fair,
beautiful and young girl go from here?

32
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,122
Ramesh.

33
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:07,682
Lot of beautiful girls
come and go from here everyday.

34
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:11,532
Look. Every girl
is like a sister to me.

35
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,723
Crap.

36
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,318
I am in trouble.
What will I answer boss?

37
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,833
I don't understand what to do.

38
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:22,283
Yes. She's the one.

39
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:34,258
Turn left.

40
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:36,879
Now turn right.

41
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,534
Left turn. Turn left.

42
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:42,433
What do you mean?

43
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:45,504
Father used to say.
Son, you know a boy from his brains..

44
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:48,039
And a girl from her looks.

45
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,118
You're a strange man.

46
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:49,991
Who the hell are you?

47
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,188
Father's son.

48
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,450
Secretary to my boss.

49
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:53,795
At your service.

50
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:56,464
Mister. Come to the point.

51
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,386
I am sorry.

52
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:59,088
Is this your photograph?

53
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,138
Of course.

54
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,910
Are you Dwarkanath's daughter?

55
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,458
Yes.

56
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,172
- Is your name Anjana?
- Yes.

57
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:07,510
- I am Ramesh. I am here to pick you up.
- Oh!

58
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,129
Porter!

59
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,030
Pick up the luggage.

60
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,169
Let's go, Madame Anjana.

61
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:12,573
Please come.

62
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:13,792
Please come.

63
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,249
Why didn't father come?

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,767
Is he alright?

65
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:20,104
Father? He left long time back.

66
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,634
What? Father!

67
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:23,514
I mean, my father.

68
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,815
Not yours.

69
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:26,675
Oh.

70
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,977
God forbid, nothing should happen.

71
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:30,514
He is doing fine.

72
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,003
He has gone out for
some estate related work.

73
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,729
He sent me to fetch you.

74
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,869
I see.

75
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,284
I am not less either, Madame.

76
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:41,827
I mean. This place
has a pleasant atmosphere.

77
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,451
Specially water.

78
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:45,926
Slim people become heavyweights.

79
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,015
Look at me. You will become too.

80
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,274
Madame Anjana, please come.

81
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:05,485
Come.

82
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:11,758
Ah!

83
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:23,205
What's going on?

84
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,998
Why is he beating that poor man?

85
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:27,561
Just following the orders.

86
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:28,896
Father had said..

87
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,451
Son, you should never
interfere between a master..

88
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,911
And servant.

89
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,699
There's your father.

90
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:37,027
Anju!

91
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:40,751
Hey?

92
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,172
Anju, what happened?

93
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,490
What's happening outside?

94
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,083
That's how things work over here.

95
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,496
You tell me.

96
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:51,509
Hope you had a nice journey.

97
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,244
It was alright till here, but.

98
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,590
No! Stop it!

99
00:06:55,654 --> 00:06:57,445
Father!

100
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,185
Anjana!

101
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:01,310
My child?

102
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,832
Father had said..

103
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,973
Son, a person can heart
attack if he shouts too much.

104
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,183
Ramesh, keep quiet.

105
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,646
Yes. Quiet.

106
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,737
Anju.

107
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,314
You shouldn't let
these things trouble you.

108
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,139
Sir, I followed your orders.

109
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:21,807
Are you human or an animal?

110
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:22,921
Leave that poor person.

111
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:23,884
I was just.

112
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:24,953
Kalu.

113
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,549
You're employed to follow my orders.

114
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Go.

115
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,687
But, father?

116
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,567
I know how to get work
done from these people.

117
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,583
I don't want any
interference in my decision.

118
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:43,668
Anjana.

119
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:45,723
The journey must've tired you.

120
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,451
Go upstairs and take rest.

121
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,169
Come.

122
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:53,302
Let's go.

123
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:58,333
Greetings, commander.

124
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,534
I can't take any more torture.

125
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,329
What happened?

126
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,910
- See for yourself.
- Hey.

127
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:06,299
- Who did this?
- Dwarka.

128
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,814
He called the poor fellow
to his bungalow and..

129
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,267
Whipped him.

130
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:12,041
He has taken birth
to shower atrocities.

131
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,756
Unless we don't raise a voice
against him, this is bound to happen.

132
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,785
No one can harm him.

133
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,441
It's only now that
you've got to know Dwarka.

134
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:24,473
I know him from the time..

135
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:27,216
I was a commander of this tribe.

136
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,318
He used to shower atrocities
even at that time.

137
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:34,274
Even today my back shivers
with the memory of his whip.

138
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,376
I'll distribute sweets
when Dwarka dies.

139
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,416
Shut up!

140
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:38,792
Aren't you ashamed..

141
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,981
Of saying such
things about someone?

142
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,846
I don't know why Jhansi
is always in favor of Dwarka.

143
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,860
Jhansi, I swear by your life.

144
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,930
After becoming a commander,
if I don't straighten Dwarka..

145
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,093
Then, my name is not Banno Singh.

146
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,131
My name is not Banno.

147
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:54,869
Crap.

148
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,657
Is Banno a name?

149
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,726
You talk beyond your capacity.

150
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:00,116
He'll become a commander.

151
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:02,449
No. Your Jhumroo
will become a commander.

152
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,387
Yes, Jhumroo will be the commander.

153
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:07,751
You wouldn't be sitting here and
chatting if you were capable of that.

154
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:33,569
"Cold breeze and
beautiful starry night."

155
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:39,058
"My heart, tell me a story."

156
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:44,948
"Life is a long road."

157
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:50,061
"My heart, tell me a story."

158
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:08,563
"Beautiful scenery.."

159
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:11,675
"Is lost in dreams."

160
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,392
"Resting their heads on the sky.."

161
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,988
"The mountains have
also fallen asleep."

162
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:26,345
"Beautiful scenery.."

163
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:29,806
"Is lost in dreams."

164
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:33,603
"Resting their heads on the sky.."

165
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:37,011
"The mountains have
also fallen asleep."

166
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,782
"My heart, you tell me.."

167
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,403
"One such tale."

168
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:48,078
"After hearing which.."

169
00:11:48,194 --> 00:11:51,978
"I'll be at peace, my love."

170
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,737
"It's an unknown destination.
Cold breeze."

171
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:58,929
"Beautiful starry night."

172
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:04,775
"My heart, tell me a story."

173
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:23,514
"I am walking.."

174
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,975
"In the shade of trees."

175
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:30,541
"Like a star.."

176
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:34,355
"In the village of clouds."

177
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:42,170
"I am walking.."

178
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:45,410
"In the shade of trees."

179
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:49,109
"Like a star.."

180
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:52,582
"In the village of clouds."

181
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:56,376
"My heart, you tell me.."

182
00:12:56,753 --> 00:13:00,128
"One such tale."

183
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:03,806
"After hearing which.."

184
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:07,745
"I'll be at peace, my love."

185
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,780
"It's an unknown destination.
Cold breeze."

186
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,987
"Beautiful starry night."

187
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,887
"My heart, tell me a story."

188
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,704
Such a beautiful song.

189
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,717
Uh.

190
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:42,845
Who's singing?

191
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:43,938
Sorry?

192
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,975
One of the tribesmen from
the settlement down there.

193
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:49,375
What's his name? Jhumroo.

194
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:51,012
Jhumroo?

195
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:51,771
Yes.

196
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,704
Every night when
he is on his way home..

197
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,485
He sings.

198
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,267
Miss. Anjana. I sing better than him.

199
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,920
- Sorry?
- That.

200
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:03,473
My father had said. Son,
when you used to cry as a child..

201
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,269
People used to mistake
that for singing.

202
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:08,444
Miss. Anjana, now when I sing..

203
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,838
People mistake that for crying.

204
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:12,444
Please.

205
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:20,554
Who's that?

206
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,730
Sorry?

207
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:24,757
He? He's uncle Bihari.

208
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,384
Uncle Bihari?

209
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:27,553
Don't you know him?

210
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:28,593
Yes.

211
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:29,965
Now I remember.

212
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,118
I had seen him when I was a kid.

213
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,143
He used to stay with us then.

214
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:35,930
Now?

215
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,405
Miss Anjana, I just know..

216
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:40,455
That his wife passed away.

217
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,107
Kid disappeared.

218
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,477
And now, his happiness..

219
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:47,061
Wife and kids
everything is alcohol.

220
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,296
Sorry.

221
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,289
Father had said.

222
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:53,111
Son, you should never gossip.

223
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,177
I've made a mistake by saying this.

224
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:57,703
I'll go and meet him.

225
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,942
Madame, master has
called you for dinner.

226
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,028
- Dinner?
- Yes.

227
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:10,704
Yes. Father was right.

228
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:15,005
Son, you should not
do any work while eating.

229
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,664
Aunt? Where's Jhumroo?

230
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:24,819
Must be sleeping.

231
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:29,792
It's market day today
and he's still sleeping?

232
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:33,346
Aunt, your love has spoiled him.

233
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:35,638
I am his mother.

234
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:38,063
You're an orphan..

235
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,975
Still you create a ruckus.

236
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:43,474
Aunt, that's why my name is Chamki.

237
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:44,669
Chamki.

238
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:47,367
There are other places to hide.

239
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:48,474
Here.

240
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,884
Hide this also.

241
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,285
There's nobody over here.

242
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,594
You've gone mad.

243
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,849
Look above.

244
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,587
Who's hanging there?

245
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:04,705
Hey?

246
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:05,831
Monkey.

247
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:06,904
Hey?

248
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:09,400
Aunt, the monkey is talking.

249
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,325
Monkey, eat sweets.

250
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,591
Monkey.

251
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:13,595
Monkey?

252
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,557
Fine. I'll show you.

253
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,845
Hey! Hey! Chamki! Hey!

254
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,125
Hey! Hey! Chamki! Hey!

255
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:22,635
Hey!

256
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,116
Huh?

257
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,507
No! Leave me!

258
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:29,551
- So?
- You?

259
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:32,219
- A girl is hanging.
- Leave me.

260
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,251
She's flying like a kite.

261
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:38,226
- Hey!
- No!

262
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,124
Hey..hey..hey.

263
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:42,332
What is this nuisance?

264
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:44,803
Aunt, look what he's done to me.

265
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,830
Jhumroo? What is all this?

266
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,496
Mother, you get aside.
I am flying a kite.

267
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,139
- Is she a kite?
- Yes.

268
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,659
- Hey! Mother!
- Leave her.

269
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:53,801
- I'll leave.
- Come on. Hurry up.

270
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:54,932
I'll leave her.

271
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:56,611
- Here you go.
- Aunt!

272
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,676
Aha! Oho!

273
00:16:58,716 --> 00:16:59,716
Got hurt?

274
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:03,646
- Come on. Get out.
- Going. - Out.

275
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,482
Go. You were giving me attitude.

276
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,878
Come on. Get up.
I have to climb the mountain.

277
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:12,923
Aunt, did you see? You said market..

278
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,521
And he's going
to climb the mountain.

279
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,694
Yes, I'll climb the mountain.

280
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:16,778
Master are coming today.

281
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,965
- No, son. Keep all this.
- Mother?

282
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,591
Jhumroo,
how many times have I told you?

283
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,501
Climbing the mountain
is extremely dangerous.

284
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:25,128
A couple of our men lose
their lives every year in this.

285
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,643
Mother, don't worry.

286
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:29,723
I am your brave son.

287
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,346
I'll make a name for myself..

288
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,003
People will forget Tenzing.

289
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,412
Forget Tenzing.

290
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:37,125
You can't even hold
a rattle properly..

291
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:38,576
And you're aiming for the moon.

292
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:39,782
Stupid.

293
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,780
- You! What did you say?
- Jhumroo!

294
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,569
- Leaving. Leaving.
- Leave her.

295
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:44,635
Come on. Accompany her to the market.

296
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,552
Or I'll slap you. Yes.

297
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:49,231
And you'll not get food
the whole day. I am telling you.

298
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:51,391
They fight all the time.

299
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,971
Jhumroo, come on.

300
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,906
What are you doing?

301
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:00,207
You're lucky that you walk
behind me holding my stole.

302
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:02,793
Otherwise people won't buy
even a penny worth of goods from you.

303
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:03,817
Is it?

304
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,027
Come with me. Let's see..

305
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,710
Whether I hold your stole..

306
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,205
Or you hold mine.

307
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:12,578
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

308
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:30,260
Hey!

309
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,834
Here it is.

310
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,889
Khandwa's drum. Benaras Pellet drum.

311
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,925
Jhumroo is selling
ankle bells from Lucknow.

312
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,501
Chamki.

313
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,235
What is it?

314
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,972
Should I send a couple
of customers to you?

315
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,157
Hey! Forget it.

316
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,127
Customers get attracted towards
me on just one signal from me.

317
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,669
What are you watching?
Signal them to come.

318
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,864
- Is it? - Yes.
- Watch.

319
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:55,596
Yes, show.

320
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,196
"Gentleman. Listen."

321
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:35,271
"She sells costly goods.
Don't get robbed."

322
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,729
"This is his trap.
I know what he is."

323
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,803
"She sells stolen goods.
Don't get fooled."

324
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:46,816
"Gentleman."

325
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:48,783
"Listen."

326
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,618
"Crap."

327
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:51,560
"He sells costly goods."

328
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
"Don't get robbed."

329
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,932
"Girl, apply kohl
and swing like a bride."

330
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,836
"Girl, apply kohl
and swing like a bride."

331
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:34,516
"Boy, wear glasses
and sing Cock-a-doodle-do."

332
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:38,189
"Boy, wear glasses
and sing Cock-a-doodle-do."

333
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,881
"Gentleman, buy this tagger.
Make a sacrifice."

334
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:49,655
"Gentleman, buy this tagger.
Make a sacrifice."

335
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:53,705
"Buy this whip.
Enemy's grandma will run away."

336
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:57,160
"Buy this whip.
Enemy's grandma will run away."

337
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,103
- "Go.
- You go."

338
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:00,855
"Go, wash your face."

339
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:02,145
"Go."

340
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:03,163
"You go."

341
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:05,386
"Go, wash your face."

342
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:08,158
"Hey, gentleman."

343
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,110
"Listen."

344
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,856
"He sells costly goods.
Don't get robbed."

345
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:18,345
"This is her trap.
I know what she is."

346
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,243
"He sells stolen goods.
Don't get fooled."

347
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:44,229
"Buy these wild herbs.
Break rocks after eating this."

348
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,999
"Buy these wild herbs.
Break rocks after eating this."

349
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,822
"This is German spice.
Repair broken utensils."

350
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:55,762
"This is German spice.
Repair broken utensils."

351
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:01,330
"She's a tribal girl."

352
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,691
"She'll bite."

353
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:06,639
"There's some problem
with the boy's brains."

354
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,534
- "Go.
- You go."

355
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:11,340
"Go. Eat grass."

356
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:13,320
"Gentleman."

357
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:15,583
"Listen."

358
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,129
"Listen."

359
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,691
"This is his trap."

360
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,582
"I know what he is."

361
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:26,672
"She sells costly goods.
Don't get robbed."

362
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:57,889
"Boy, don't fight with
me or I'll hurl abuses."

363
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:01,796
"Boy, don't fight with
me or I'll hurl abuses."

364
00:23:01,836 --> 00:23:05,613
"Listen everyone.
Give her a round of applause."

365
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:09,402
"Listen everyone.
Give her a round of applause."

366
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,763
"Wait there. I'll ruin you."

367
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,299
"Go, grind hot spices."

368
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:19,341
"Go."

369
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,450
"You go. Go home and
eat rice and potatoes."

370
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,092
"Gentleman."

371
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:27,167
"Listen."

372
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:31,148
"He sells costly goods.
Don't get robbed."

373
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:35,360
"This is her trap.
I know what she is."

374
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,490
"He sells stolen goods.
Don't get fooled."

375
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,932
- Rani, come.
- I'll fall.

376
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:10,348
The shop is full.
Take whatever you want to.

377
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:15,040
Madame, look how pretty this is.

378
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,429
Show me that necklace.

379
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:18,441
This is made from real Coral.

380
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:20,429
How much is this for?

381
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,522
Don't ask the price. Just take it.

382
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,590
Madame, this is the prettiest of all.

383
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,823
You'll look very pretty.

384
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:33,530
Madame. This one.

385
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:35,309
Enough.

386
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,475
Tell me how much they cost.

387
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:38,294
I can't calculate.

388
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:41,129
I won't overcharge you, Rani.

389
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:42,403
Jhumroo.

390
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:46,203
- Hey!
- Jhumroo.

391
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:47,404
What is it?

392
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:49,011
Calculate it for me.

393
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,276
Go, I won't.

394
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:52,730
You can't do simple calculations
and you want to run a shop.

395
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,027
Don't be so proud.

396
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,675
Don't do if you don't want to.

397
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:58,708
That makes it.

398
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:00,533
Five.

399
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,242
5 rupees and 21 annas.

400
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:03,452
What?

401
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,204
5 rupees and 21 annas.

402
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:07,372
No.

403
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,664
21 rupees and 5 annas.

404
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:11,699
Here you go.

405
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:13,595
It's one and the same thing.

406
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,302
What money?

407
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,171
I just gave you a 100 rupee note.

408
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,093
Oh! 100 rupee note?

409
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:26,708
Go. You own a car and
you mess with a poor girl.

410
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:28,699
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Shut up!

411
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:30,398
First you steal and
then you act smart?

412
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,111
You. I'll finish you
off if you call me a thief.

413
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:35,842
My name is Chamki.

414
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:37,188
Madame, what happened?

415
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:39,197
Ground wouldn't have stolen
the money if you'd paid her.

416
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:40,754
Not the ground,
she wants to swallow it.

417
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:41,479
Thief.

418
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,665
Dare you call me a thief.

419
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,513
Madame.

420
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:45,032
Don't be so proud.

421
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:46,552
You'll find it difficult
to get out of here.

422
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:48,872
All of you are threatening me.
I'll inform the police.

423
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:50,868
The police will be informed later.
First I'll.

424
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:53,017
What is this? Why are you after me?
Leave my clothes.

425
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:54,400
You! Get aside.

426
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:55,998
You get into a fight?
Should I give you one?

427
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,119
Go away.
You'll slap me? First tell her.

428
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,159
What's the matter?

429
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:02,504
I bought some goods from her.

430
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,180
- I gave her a 100 rupee note, but she.
- She's telling lies.

431
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,188
I am very well aquainted with you.

432
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:07,820
Give me the note.

433
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,450
Where will I get it from?
I don't know.

434
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,599
You.

435
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,405
Take out the note.

436
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:13,228
Leave my hand.

437
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,970
Here.

438
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,690
Where did it come from?

439
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:18,617
Shameless.

440
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:19,849
- Keep quiet.
- Leave me.

441
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:21,273
Pick up your stuff.

442
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:23,271
Here's your note.

443
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:24,385
Thank you.

444
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,233
Jhumroo. Wait.

445
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:30,029
I'll pack up my shop
and leave with you.

446
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,092
Go, you fighter.

447
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:39,445
Miss. Anjana, what happened?

448
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:42,105
Nothing. People here are very rude.

449
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:43,310
There was a fight.

450
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:44,844
It's okay.

451
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,867
Fights happen with these people.

452
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:50,793
Sit.

453
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:55,631
Puncture.

454
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:56,906
Hey!

455
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:03,584
Looks like these girls
have played a prank.

456
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,468
Why do these girls puncture
the car's tyre instead of the heart?

457
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:10,121
Ask them.

458
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:15,638
Listen, Madame.

459
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:18,249
Listen.

460
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:20,963
I am sorry your car broke down.

461
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:21,796
Come.

462
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:25,196
No issues. Come,
I'll drop you home on my Timroo.

463
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:27,175
- Timroo?
- Yes, Timroo.

464
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:29,584
- My dearest friend, Timroo.
- Oh!

465
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:31,911
You go with your Timroo. I'll manage.

466
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,774
Then the world will say

467
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:34,592
that the girl was walking
while the boy was riding a horse.

468
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:35,616
What say, Timroo?

469
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:39,541
The world will also say

470
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:41,956
that the girl is riding
the horse while the boy is walking.

471
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:44,598
He says, no.

472
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,608
Do one thing.
Let's ride the horse together.

473
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:50,624
- What?
- I mean, both you and I on the horse.

474
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:53,648
Then the world will
call both of us bad.

475
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:56,027
Is it? Then let's three of us walk.

476
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,855
Girl walks, boy walks..

477
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:59,831
And Timroo walks.
What say, son? Let's go.

478
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,846
You're very interesting.

479
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:04,134
Where do you stay?

480
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:05,443
In the settlement down there.

481
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:06,522
Is it?

482
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:07,674
What's your name?

483
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:08,809
Jhumroo.

484
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,730
Jhumroo?

485
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:14,004
- Are you the Jhumroo who was singing last night?
- Yes.

486
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:15,693
What was the song?

487
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,929
Nice song.

488
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:19,484
Cold breeze.

489
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:21,051
Beautiful starry night.

490
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:25,976
"My heart, tell me a story."

491
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:28,715
It's such a nice song.

492
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:30,280
You sing it so well.

493
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,525
I am nothing.

494
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:33,425
If you hear my mother
sing this song..

495
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:34,651
You'll go crazy.

496
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,542
Is it?

497
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,550
- I'll definitely hear it from her.
- Come home then.

498
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:38,283
Now?

499
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:40,586
It's too late. Some other time.

500
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:42,538
Tata.

501
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:44,691
Tata?

502
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:46,503
English?

503
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,356
Why? What happened?

504
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:58,672
What didn't happen?

505
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:01,034
How're you talking?

506
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,184
Don't ask me.

507
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,666
Ask your dear Jhumroo.

508
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,107
Why? what has he done?

509
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,518
What didn't he do?

510
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:09,780
You girl.

511
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:12,051
Why don't you tell me clearly?

512
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,370
What's the matter?

513
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,739
It's not a normal thing, aunt.

514
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,559
If I didn't care about you..

515
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,512
I would've swallowed him alive.

516
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,045
Who? Jhumroo?

517
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:22,676
Not Jhumroo.

518
00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:25,736
That fair and good looking city girl.

519
00:29:25,854 --> 00:29:28,882
Jhumroo insulted me in front
of the entire market because of her.

520
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:30,214
Yes.

521
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,893
How can you insult
someone who has no honor.

522
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:33,933
Thief.

523
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:36,059
Your new girl must be a thief.

524
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:38,132
What a flirtatious laugh?

525
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,284
Met her?

526
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:40,510
Dropped her home?

527
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:41,420
Yes, I did.

528
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,047
I am not afraid of anybody's father.

529
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:44,952
Tell me something.

530
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,013
Mother, you don't know.

531
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:47,165
Her old habit.

532
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:48,996
She stole a 100 rupee note.

533
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,293
I returned it to her.

534
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,743
Was she your relative?

535
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:56,601
Look, I am telling you.

536
00:29:56,821 --> 00:30:00,607
Keep it in mind.
If I see that witch with you again..

537
00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:03,547
I'll hold her hair and
throw her down the mountain.

538
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:06,034
You'll throw her?

539
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,319
The girl because of
who she's getting so angry..

540
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:13,466
Who's that girl, son?

541
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:15,575
Mother, forget it.
I am fed up of her.

542
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:17,842
She has grown up but
she doesn't stop stealing.

543
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,788
Mind you.
She'll put us in jail one day.

544
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:20,988
- Chamki.
- Give me the plate.

545
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:23,842
Chamki never lies, my son.

546
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:25,077
When did she speak the truth?

547
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:26,419
- But.
- Vegetable.

548
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:28,684
Yes.

549
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:32,524
- But.
- Potato.

550
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,196
But son, who's that girl?

551
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:41,292
Am loving it.

552
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,586
Wow! Am loving it.

553
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:43,435
After meeting the girl?

554
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,273
No, the potatoes.
Delicious potatoes. Wow!

555
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:48,115
- But?
- Let me eat.

556
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,668
- But.
- Let me eat.

557
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:53,602
- But who's that girl?
- Mother, let me eat.

558
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:56,775
Wow!

559
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:57,979
Wow!

560
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:05,349
You've come?

561
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:06,462
- Please come.
- Yes.

562
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:07,558
Yes.

563
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,132
Please come.

564
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:26,528
Mother.

565
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,490
Greetings.

566
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:32,438
God bless, my child.

567
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:34,603
You're so beautiful.

568
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,351
Like a piece of moon.

569
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:38,279
What's your name?

570
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,399
Anju.

571
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:41,363
I mean, miss Anjana.

572
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:42,655
I mean, she came in a car.

573
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,099
I mean, she's come from the city.

574
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:45,201
I mean.

575
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:46,882
Is it?

576
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:49,490
Is she the girl because
of whom you fought with Chamki?

577
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,842
For her? No.

578
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:53,389
I was fighting for potatoes.

579
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:54,461
They were delicious.

580
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:55,753
- Just.
- Keep quiet.

581
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,221
- Come, my child.
- Mother.

582
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:58,921
Do you know what she's here for?

583
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:00,516
I'll ask her.

584
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:02,484
I'll tell you before you ask.

585
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:04,181
She has come to hear you sing.

586
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:06,357
Sing?

587
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,495
I can't sing.

588
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,563
Please sing.

589
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:11,849
I've indeed come to hear you sing.

590
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:14,048
No, my child.

591
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:15,978
I am not in an age where I can sing.

592
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,814
But we are in an age to listen.

593
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:19,159
Oh?

594
00:32:19,257 --> 00:32:21,166
So both of you have planned it.

595
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:22,284
You can say that.

596
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:23,785
Please sing, mother.

597
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:25,766
Please sing.

598
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,390
Mother, sing that song of yours.

599
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:29,541
No, my son.

600
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,301
You know..

601
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:34,843
That I won't be
able to sing that song.

602
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:37,704
Jhumroo, don't force me.

603
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:49,986
Look.

604
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:52,994
Don't think that I called
you here on some pretext.

605
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:54,924
Trust me.

606
00:32:55,195 --> 00:32:57,449
I'll definitely fulfill
my promise one day.

607
00:32:57,716 --> 00:32:58,739
No issues.

608
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:00,154
I'll leave.

609
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:09,449
"Cold breeze and this
beautiful starry night."

610
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:16,425
"My heart, tell me a story."

611
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:23,701
"Life is a long road."

612
00:33:23,964 --> 00:33:30,668
"My heart, tell me a story."

613
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:02,528
Ah!

614
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:06,391
Leave! Leave me!

615
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:10,172
My child.

616
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:12,998
No!

617
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:15,807
My child.

618
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:19,769
My child.

619
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:26,322
Mother?

620
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:27,358
Mother?

621
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:28,450
Uh.

622
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,067
What happened to her?

623
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,893
Whenever mother sings this song.

624
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,689
She suffers an attack.

625
00:34:41,728 --> 00:34:42,750
Hey?

626
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,903
Then I made a big mistake.

627
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:46,673
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

628
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,526
I would've never forced her.

629
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:52,063
Mother.

630
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:53,710
How are you feeling now?

631
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:55,573
Nothing, son.

632
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:56,964
Am fine.

633
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,585
Don't worry.

634
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:00,609
Hey? Where did she go?

635
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:18,697
Kalu?

636
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:21,130
What happened?

637
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,496
Sir, Madame hasn't returned yet.

638
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:24,962
Not returned yet?

639
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:26,017
No, sir.

640
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,125
Go.

641
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:34,694
"Cold breeze and this
beautiful starry night."

642
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:40,535
"My heart, tell me a story."

643
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:46,261
"Life is a long road."

644
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:51,944
"My heart, tell me a story."

645
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,149
Anjana.

646
00:35:54,468 --> 00:35:56,290
Where did you learn this song from?

647
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,550
Like it?

648
00:35:58,095 --> 00:35:59,678
I love it.

649
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:03,632
An old woman from the settlement
down there sings this song very well.

650
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,760
It seems..

651
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:08,025
As if I've heard it earlier.

652
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,037
You went to the settlement?

653
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,646
Yes. That's where I am coming from.

654
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:12,817
The people are so nice.

655
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:14,320
Who's nice and who's bad?

656
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:16,556
It's my responsibility
to think about it.

657
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,210
Anjana, look.

658
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:22,893
They are not equal to us.

659
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:25,963
I don't want you to
visit the settlement again.

660
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,267
Understand?

661
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:33,247
Understand.

662
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,350
One.

663
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,150
Don't interfere in anything.

664
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,713
Two.

665
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,625
Don't visit the settlement.

666
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,835
What is this?

667
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:46,531
I don't understand.

668
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:22,676
Hey? You?

669
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,740
Greetings, Madame.

670
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:27,462
How did you reach here?

671
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:30,435
What to do? I was tired after trying
to look for you in the whole world.

672
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:31,418
So.

673
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,135
But you shouldn't come like this.

674
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:34,813
- Come on. Leave.
- I'll go. ♪

675
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:37,459
I came here to ask why you
left without informing me yesterday.

676
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:39,881
Oh! What do I tell you?

677
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:42,514
Your mother's song had something..

678
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,795
That was making me crazy.

679
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:48,574
What? But this time,
it's me who's going crazy.

680
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,915
See. Neither up nor down.

681
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:52,118
I am hanging in between.

682
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:54,532
Hey? I forgot about it.

683
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:55,817
How did you come up?

684
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,485
This is nothing.

685
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,108
You watch my magic..

686
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:00,806
When I climb the mountain.

687
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:03,433
Oh! You're a climber?

688
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:04,994
Do you also climb mountains?

689
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:10,581
Forget mountains. In some
days I am going to ride the clouds.

690
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:12,961
Even I am fond of mountain climbing.

691
00:38:13,296 --> 00:38:15,819
When I was in college
I used to wonder..

692
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:19,837
How fun it must be to climb to the
top of the mountain and look down.

693
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:21,640
Who needs a mirror to look
at the beauty of an arm band?

694
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:23,777
There's the mountain.
Here's your trainer.

695
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:25,869
And the learner is in front of me.
Let's go.

696
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:27,358
No.

697
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,249
Not now.

698
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,142
You'll land in trouble
if the guard sees you.

699
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,608
- You go.
- Don't worry.

700
00:38:32,648 --> 00:38:36,403
I fed him an intoxicating
pill made from 13 herbs in 12 months.

701
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:38,211
- What?
- Free for 3 hours.

702
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:39,251
My God!

703
00:38:39,893 --> 00:38:41,459
Whatever. You go for now.

704
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:44,144
But you didn't tell me
when and where we'll meet.

705
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:45,830
You want me to return after 2 hours?

706
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,639
No. Don't come here.

707
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,423
I'll meet you in the tea garden.

708
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:51,125
- Tea garden? - Yes.
- Alright.

709
00:38:51,836 --> 00:38:52,954
Promise?

710
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,351
I am sorry, Madame.

711
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:04,396
Wow! Madame.

712
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:05,742
Wow!

713
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:06,727
Wow!

714
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:08,506
Wow!

715
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:11,718
Father.

716
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:16,261
Where are you going in this attire?

717
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:17,534
To climb the mountain.

718
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:18,761
Mountain?

719
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:19,517
Very good.

720
00:39:19,742 --> 00:39:21,585
I am also bored of sitting.
I'll join you.

721
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,471
But, father.

722
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:23,693
No ifs and buts.

723
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,697
You don't know how
to climb a mountain.

724
00:39:26,016 --> 00:39:27,536
Come, I'll teach
you mountain climbing.

725
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:28,643
Uh.

726
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:30,690
Yes. Come with me.

727
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:01,588
Sir.

728
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:02,402
Sir.

729
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,780
Greetings, sir.

730
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,845
I swear sir.

731
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:06,347
I am the oldest Sherpa here, sir.

732
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:08,360
My father used to work
in your tea garden, sir.

733
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:10,612
I'll take you to the
peak for just 10 rupees.

734
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:12,979
Do you get only 10 rupees
to climb to the peak?

735
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,078
Who'll bring them down?

736
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:15,570
Who'll get you down?
Sir, he's talking nonsense.

737
00:40:15,594 --> 00:40:18,497
You won't find a Sherpa like me
in all of Sikkim, Bhutan and Nepal.

738
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:19,752
Sir, I am very cheap.

739
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:20,678
Greetings, sir.

740
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,806
Sir, don't get misled by them.
I'll take you on a first class tour.

741
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,367
Sir, listen to me.
Don't go with him.

742
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:27,246
Fine. Don't make noise.

743
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,079
Come with me.

744
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,229
Here comes a professional Sherpa.

745
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,594
Name, Ranga Singh.
Tel Singh's disciple.

746
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:37,949
Most charming. Played in the
mountains from childhood till youth.

747
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:41,030
See these certificates from
the British if you don't believe me.

748
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:44,936
If you don't believe this,
then ask Lord King Kaul.

749
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:49,043
If you still don't believe it,
talk to my teacher on phone.

750
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,567
He looks intelligent.

751
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:54,363
- Sir, you're wrong.
- What?

752
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,745
Right, sir.
I'll help you climb in such a way..

753
00:40:56,785 --> 00:40:58,663
That in two minutes..

754
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:00,525
- The mountain will be on top of you.
- What?

755
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,837
I meant, you'll be on the
top of the mountain in 2 minutes.

756
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:04,877
Say that.

757
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,876
Slip of tongue, sir.

758
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:06,920
Sir. Sir.

759
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,872
He is a newcomer.

760
00:41:07,972 --> 00:41:08,761
Quiet.

761
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:10,622
- Sir, he is lying.
- Quiet.

762
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:14,524
Won't your daughter climb?

763
00:41:14,643 --> 00:41:15,307
No.

764
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:16,394
Look Anjana.

765
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:18,111
I'll climb the mountain first.

766
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:19,498
If there's no danger..

767
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,041
- I'll call you.
- Yes, daddy. - Huh?

768
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:25,780
Sherpa!

769
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:26,948
Coming, sir.

770
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:45,889
Sherpa.

771
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:47,721
- Sherpa.
- Coming, sir.

772
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:48,974
Before climbing..

773
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:50,418
We need to tie the
waist to the mountain.

774
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,442
What do you mean?

775
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:53,547
I mean, before starting the climb..

776
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:55,092
A rope needs to
be tied around the waist.

777
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:55,683
This side.

778
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Uh.

779
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:01,079
- This is difficult.
- What is difficult?

780
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,252
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

781
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,430
- Now what?
- Now what?

782
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:05,021
- What happened?
- Hey, you?

783
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:07,443
- Ah!
- Careful, sir.

784
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:08,601
Hey?

785
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:10,778
Tell me what's next.

786
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:11,776
No problem, sir.

787
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:12,699
Name, Ranga Singh.

788
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,940
Disciple of Tel Singh.

789
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:14,833
Most charming.

790
00:42:14,873 --> 00:42:16,504
- I'll call up my teacher right away.
- Yes.

791
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:17,917
Wait.

792
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:20,998
- Wait.
- Uh.

793
00:42:23,037 --> 00:42:24,689
Hello. Hello, teacher?

794
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:25,560
We're stuck.

795
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,105
The rope is stuck.

796
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:30,029
- Give me a solution to come out of it.
- Get off, you teacher's disciple.

797
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:32,016
You can't remove a simple rope.
Come on.

798
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,901
Here you go. I am free.

799
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:35,762
- Free. - Wait.
- You're free, sir.

800
00:42:35,835 --> 00:42:36,867
- Am free.
- One minute.

801
00:42:36,907 --> 00:42:38,477
Safe and sound.

802
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,556
Ah!

803
00:42:39,602 --> 00:42:40,499
Now tell me what to do next.

804
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:43,092
- Do one thing. - Yes.
- Climb up slowly.

805
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:44,916
- I've tied the rope tight.
- Alright.

806
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:47,277
In two minutes,
body will be down and soul go up.

807
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:50,660
- What?
- I mean, you'll go up in 2 minutes.

808
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,594
Sir. Come on.

809
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:53,450
Climb, sir.

810
00:42:53,518 --> 00:42:55,173
- Alright.
- Yes.

811
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:56,263
Very good.

812
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,319
Yes.

813
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:03,129
Come on. Sir.

814
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:04,802
Come on, sir.

815
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:05,779
Is it right?

816
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,144
Right. Start.

817
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,261
Up. Go up.

818
00:43:10,873 --> 00:43:12,304
- What?
- Baby, sir.

819
00:43:12,344 --> 00:43:13,631
Be careful.

820
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:14,671
Be careful.

821
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:18,252
Right to the top.

822
00:43:18,506 --> 00:43:20,005
You'll reach the top slowly.

823
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:22,219
Don't be afraid, sir. Keep going.

824
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,970
I kept your father hanging above.

825
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:28,436
What?

826
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:29,587
Nothing to worry.

827
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:31,165
You're disguised in such a way..

828
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,983
I wouldn't have recognised
you if you'd not signaled me.

829
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:33,886
You're strange.

830
00:43:33,926 --> 00:43:35,087
You brought your father along.

831
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:35,870
What could I do?

832
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:36,833
What could I do?

833
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:38,391
Father wanted to come.

834
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:40,031
Fine. Let's go on
a tour of the mountain.

835
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,428
Sir! Sir, careful!

836
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:09,606
Sir fell down.

837
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:12,164
Sir fell down. Sir! Get aside.

838
00:44:12,254 --> 00:44:13,517
Careful, sir. Careful.

839
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,104
Stand up slowly. Slowly.

840
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:16,509
Slowly. Didn't I tell you?

841
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:19,178
Didn't I tell you you'll
slip if you climb the slippery rock?

842
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,048
- You slipped, sir.
- So what?

843
00:44:21,473 --> 00:44:22,344
I went there myself.

844
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:24,327
Yes, sir. Very good. I didn't know.

845
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:25,712
You're an old climber.

846
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:27,402
- Sir. Careful.
- Ah!

847
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:30,598
Sir, careful.
I'll telephone my teacher right away.

848
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,896
Hello. Hello, teacher?
Teacher, ambulance.

849
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:36,047
Ambulance, teacher.
Teacher, ambulance.

850
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,815
Teacher, ambulance.
He's leaving, teacher.

851
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,708
Teacher. Is teacher sleeping?
Let him sleep.

852
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:47,431
- Kalu. - Yes, sir.
- Here on the neck. - Yes, sir.

853
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:50,382
Slowly. What are you doing?

854
00:44:50,493 --> 00:44:53,037
Sir, you should've
thought before climbing.

855
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:54,861
This is the demand of your age.

856
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,256
Have I become old?

857
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:58,560
God knows about your body..

858
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,819
But your heart is
definitely young, sir.

859
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:02,205
Greetings, sir.

860
00:45:04,062 --> 00:45:05,426
Sir, don't worry.

861
00:45:05,466 --> 00:45:06,823
This happens for the first time.

862
00:45:06,863 --> 00:45:08,694
I've brought oil for you.

863
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:10,275
What oil?

864
00:45:10,347 --> 00:45:11,688
Ultimate cure for pain.

865
00:45:11,814 --> 00:45:12,719
5 from Tibet.

866
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:13,671
4 from Nepal.

867
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,914
And 3 from Bhutan.

868
00:45:14,986 --> 00:45:16,757
With 12 herbs..

869
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,768
In 11 months..

870
00:45:17,808 --> 00:45:19,540
I've prepared one that
will be effective for 13 months.

871
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:21,635
- Apply it and finished.
- Who finished?

872
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:23,290
Not you, sir. Your pain.

873
00:45:23,364 --> 00:45:24,905
Come smiling and leave crying.

874
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:25,447
What?

875
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:27,846
I mean. Come crying
and leave smiling.

876
00:45:27,886 --> 00:45:28,801
Apply it once..

877
00:45:28,868 --> 00:45:30,544
And you won't be able
to get up for the next 2 months.

878
00:45:30,568 --> 00:45:33,037
- What nonsense?
- I mean, apply it once..

879
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,518
And get relief
for the next 2 months.

880
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:35,925
Wrestler, hold this. Pour it.

881
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,460
Sir, this is an oil..

882
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,065
There's no match
for it in the whole world.

883
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:43,198
Join the bones..

884
00:45:43,238 --> 00:45:44,719
- Apply oil and it'll separate.
- Huh?

885
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,588
I mean, break the bones.

886
00:45:46,628 --> 00:45:48,830
Apply oil and it will be joined.
Wrestler, get aside.

887
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:52,968
There's no fun here.

888
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,936
I am sorry, sir. Tell me where.

889
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:58,017
- On the nect. ♪
- Yes.

890
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:02,523
Baby?

891
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,727
Where's your master?

892
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:04,447
What?

893
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:06,929
I mean. Sir, where's your baby?

894
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:08,740
Must be upstairs.
You continue with the massage.

895
00:46:08,764 --> 00:46:10,122
That's bad.

896
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:11,865
You're in pain and she's upstairs?

897
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:13,769
Madame.

898
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,516
Who's shouting?

899
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:38,392
Madame, salute.

900
00:46:40,596 --> 00:46:41,596
Father.

901
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:43,070
You called me?

902
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,687
Sir, not baby. I called you.

903
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:49,008
- What nonsense?
- I mean, not sir but I called you.

904
00:46:49,478 --> 00:46:51,938
If the children look after
their parents the pain eases sooner.

905
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:52,876
Come on, help.

906
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:55,152
Wrestler. I am sorry. Pour the oil.

907
00:46:56,419 --> 00:46:57,670
Give me your hand.

908
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:01,276
Baby, you pull from there.

909
00:47:01,316 --> 00:47:02,475
I'll pull from here.

910
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:04,384
No. No need to pull.

911
00:47:05,226 --> 00:47:07,149
Explain everything to the wrestler.

912
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,962
Anjana, you go do your work.

913
00:47:10,004 --> 00:47:10,779
Come on, wrestler.

914
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:11,985
Right, sir.

915
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:15,799
But, father. I was..

916
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:17,526
Going for climbing.

917
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:18,641
No.

918
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:20,132
No need to go.

919
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:22,572
Can't you see my condition?

920
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:24,440
What if you slip and
fall from the mountain?

921
00:47:24,464 --> 00:47:26,218
Why worry if I am there, sir?

922
00:47:26,258 --> 00:47:28,374
Name, Ranga Singh.
Tel Singh's disciple.

923
00:47:28,414 --> 00:47:30,614
Most charming. I'll look
after her in such a way, sir..

924
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:31,772
If she climbs up..

925
00:47:31,812 --> 00:47:33,283
She'll come down safely.

926
00:47:33,323 --> 00:47:35,859
And yes, wrestler.
Massage sir slowly.

927
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:39,710
Do it slowly. After an hour,
give him a warm blanket bath..

928
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,584
- And put him to sleep in water.
- What are you saying?

929
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,608
No, wrestler.

930
00:47:42,661 --> 00:47:44,870
Give father a warm bath
and make him sleep in a blanket.

931
00:47:44,938 --> 00:47:45,616
Yes.

932
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:46,797
Father.

933
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:47,977
Can I go?

934
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:50,394
Alright. If you insist, go.

935
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,067
Wait.

936
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,338
Be careful while
climbing the mountain.

937
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:56,635
Come.

938
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:51,830
Hey. Where are you going?

939
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,677
Where are you going?

940
00:48:53,755 --> 00:48:55,474
Alright. So it's you..

941
00:48:55,514 --> 00:48:57,280
Who steals fruits everyday.

942
00:48:57,598 --> 00:48:58,996
Why do you come here?

943
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:01,787
Why does your daughter
come in our area?

944
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:05,007
I'll get your tongue pulled
out if you talk too much.

945
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,080
Kalu.

946
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:08,529
Take her away.

947
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:11,696
Whip her if she comes here again.

948
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:12,931
Take her away.

949
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:14,801
Come on, get out of here.

950
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,830
- Ramesh.
- Yes, boss.

951
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:27,423
Yes.

952
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:31,881
Anjana should not
visit the settlement.

953
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:33,761
But, sir. She.

954
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:36,582
Your father had also
said that you're a big fool.

955
00:49:36,747 --> 00:49:38,050
Yes, sir.

956
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,976
Do as I say.

957
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:42,421
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

958
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,513
Greetings, miss Anjana.

959
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:07,764
My God!

960
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:08,611
You?

961
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,756
I am sorry.

962
00:50:09,888 --> 00:50:12,095
Just tell me..

963
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,390
Whether you're wearing
chappals or sandals.

964
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:15,654
Sandals? Why?

965
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:17,412
Very good.

966
00:50:17,452 --> 00:50:19,365
Father had said, son.

967
00:50:19,405 --> 00:50:21,843
If you want to express
your feelings to a girl..

968
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:24,490
Check whether she's
wearing sandals or..

969
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:25,596
Chappals.

970
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:27,264
Don't be scared of me.

971
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,945
- Come ahead.
- Very good.

972
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:33,803
Tell me.

973
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,336
What do you want to say?

974
00:50:35,495 --> 00:50:36,535
May I?

975
00:50:36,877 --> 00:50:37,877
Really?

976
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:40,722
Miss. Anjana.

977
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,307
What do you..

978
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,402
Like?

979
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:47,487
I like a lot of things.

980
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:50,205
Radish pickle, jowar flatbread
and potato-cauliflower curry.

981
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:51,601
- Me?
- You?

982
00:50:52,255 --> 00:50:54,008
- You're not nice.
- Uh?

983
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,602
- Very nice.
- Very good.

984
00:50:56,692 --> 00:50:57,394
Very good.

985
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,352
It's an icing on the cake.

986
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:07,087
From the time I saw you..

987
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:08,409
I've gone crazy.

988
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:10,055
I keep reciting your name.

989
00:51:10,185 --> 00:51:11,536
I dream.

990
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:14,025
Bit by bit..

991
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,080
She knows my condition.

992
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:17,489
I don't know..

993
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:18,784
No one knows.

994
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:21,241
She knows my condition.

995
00:51:21,634 --> 00:51:23,574
Hey? You wrote this?

996
00:51:26,535 --> 00:51:27,657
What else could I do?

997
00:51:27,697 --> 00:51:29,361
I was afraid, I'll forget.

998
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:30,317
Miss. Anjana.

999
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:31,964
Henceforth I'll revise it.

1000
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:34,059
Father had said. Son.

1001
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:35,199
My son.

1002
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:37,011
Love is an examination.

1003
00:51:37,165 --> 00:51:39,424
Love is a kind of an exam.

1004
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,134
Is it?

1005
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,490
Pass or fail?

1006
00:51:41,587 --> 00:51:43,250
Means of Love's...

1007
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,184
I've seen a different tradition.

1008
00:51:45,364 --> 00:51:46,686
That's why I failed.

1009
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:48,855
When I taught a lesson.

1010
00:51:49,095 --> 00:51:51,541
Why fear if you've fallen in love?

1011
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:54,499
Why fear if you've fallen in love?

1012
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:56,420
Father had said. Son.

1013
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,336
If you want to express your
feelings to a beautiful girl..

1014
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:01,562
Then find a place where.

1015
00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:05,032
The place where
buds of desires bloom.

1016
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:07,702
Where there's loneliness.

1017
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:10,354
I'll take you there.

1018
00:52:10,552 --> 00:52:11,128
Very good.

1019
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:12,455
Very good.

1020
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:17,434
Wow!

1021
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:19,561
You've chose an excellent place.

1022
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:20,645
Marvellous.

1023
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,250
Excellent, miss Anjana.

1024
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:24,633
Excellent.

1025
00:52:24,865 --> 00:52:27,045
Father had said. Son.

1026
00:52:27,173 --> 00:52:29,604
To express your feelings to a girl..

1027
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:31,166
This is the kind of place you need.

1028
00:52:32,077 --> 00:52:33,077
Very good.

1029
00:52:33,557 --> 00:52:35,046
You look around.

1030
00:52:35,647 --> 00:52:36,647
Am going.

1031
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:38,169
Going?

1032
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:39,964
Going to her lover's place?

1033
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:43,011
Father had said. Son.

1034
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,054
Don't open your mouth
in the matters of love.

1035
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:47,293
You'll land in trouble
if you have to open your mouth.

1036
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,740
Now what?

1037
00:52:51,691 --> 00:52:52,691
Anju.

1038
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:54,385
Hello, Mr. Jhumroo.

1039
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:56,160
Hey? Mr. Ramesh?

1040
00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:57,155
What are you doing here?

1041
00:52:57,195 --> 00:52:59,541
Good. I was waiting for you.

1042
00:52:59,581 --> 00:53:00,873
The thing is.

1043
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:04,185
You people practice
some kind of magic.

1044
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:06,486
- Yes. - Do you know that?
- I am an expert at it.

1045
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:08,188
- You want me to try it on you?
- No.

1046
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,790
My friend.

1047
00:53:09,923 --> 00:53:10,923
The thing is.

1048
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,358
- A girl. - Girl?
- Yes.

1049
00:53:13,629 --> 00:53:16,251
I want to attract her.
Give me an idea.

1050
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,554
That's very easy.

1051
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,119
Hold her hand and pull her.

1052
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:22,198
Hey. Mr.
Jhumroo, you've become serious.

1053
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:25,772
Actually, the thing is.

1054
00:53:25,856 --> 00:53:27,572
Miss. Anjana who's
standing over there.

1055
00:53:27,693 --> 00:53:29,654
- She?
- Yes, she's the one.

1056
00:53:29,694 --> 00:53:33,516
Her heart and my heart is.

1057
00:53:33,556 --> 00:53:34,456
- Is it?
- Yes.

1058
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:35,496
Huh.

1059
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,479
It's very easy.

1060
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:41,584
Can you sing?

1061
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:42,803
Yes. Why not?

1062
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:45,704
Father had said. Son.

1063
00:53:45,794 --> 00:53:47,116
Don't ever try to sing.

1064
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:49,438
- You'll attract the donkeys.
- Fine.

1065
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:50,826
Hey, where are you going?

1066
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:52,990
To my would-be?

1067
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:53,849
Never.

1068
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:56,081
Mister, you have
to teach me the tricks.

1069
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,250
Teach me the trick.

1070
00:53:57,282 --> 00:53:58,026
Understand?

1071
00:53:58,189 --> 00:53:59,770
I am not telling you
if you're going to get angry.

1072
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:00,920
Jhumroo, my brother.

1073
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,915
I got a little angry.
Tell me the trick.

1074
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,726
- Tell me the trick.
- Listen.

1075
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:15,544
- Thank you, Jhumroo. Thank you.
- Hey?

1076
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:17,959
Thank you, Mr. Jhumroo.

1077
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:36,093
"My heart dances."

1078
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:40,147
"My heart dances."

1079
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:43,973
"Slim waist, flirtatious eyes.
You're awesome."

1080
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:47,485
"My heart dances."

1081
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:51,602
"Slim waist, flirtatious eyes.
You're awesome."

1082
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:53,548
"My heart dances."

1083
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:06,358
"Swing and dance in glee."

1084
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:10,221
"The world tells me to stop a bit."

1085
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:14,008
"Swing and dance in glee."

1086
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:17,838
"The world tells me to stop a bit."

1087
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:19,771
"I won't listen."

1088
00:55:19,811 --> 00:55:21,700
- "This is mere talk.
- Go."

1089
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,686
- "I can see.
- What?"

1090
00:55:23,726 --> 00:55:25,193
"Green world."

1091
00:55:28,623 --> 00:55:32,101
"Swing and dance in glee."

1092
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:33,956
"Wow! Madame."

1093
00:55:33,996 --> 00:55:36,293
"Wow! Madame."

1094
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,114
"My lover sings and dances in joy."

1095
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:43,666
"My heart dances."

1096
00:55:43,706 --> 00:55:47,786
"Slim waist, flirtatious eyes.
You're awesome."

1097
00:55:47,826 --> 00:55:49,770
"My heart dances."

1098
00:55:58,713 --> 00:56:02,610
"I don't know what you fear."

1099
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,406
"I feel like laughing."

1100
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,655
"I don't know what you fear."

1101
00:56:09,695 --> 00:56:13,462
"I feel like laughing."

1102
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:15,369
"My love, my affection."

1103
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,305
"Is in trouble."

1104
00:56:17,345 --> 00:56:19,267
"I say, my love."

1105
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:20,852
"You're laughing."

1106
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:38,460
"Run, catch him,
my love will fall down."

1107
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,268
"My heart dances."

1108
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:45,810
"Slim waist. Father had said, son."

1109
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,182
"My heart dances."

1110
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:04,881
"I don't understand anything.
I am still young, my love."

1111
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,795
"Tell me what love is. Swear by me."

1112
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:12,652
"I don't understand anything.
I am still young, my love."

1113
00:57:12,692 --> 00:57:16,446
"Tell me what love is. Swear by me."

1114
00:57:16,509 --> 00:57:20,209
"We'll roam everywhere like crazy."

1115
00:57:20,294 --> 00:57:23,812
"I'll not listen to anyone.
You don't listen to anyone."

1116
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:27,671
"You and I will keep talking,
my love."

1117
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:31,240
"My heart dances."

1118
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,090
"Slim waist, flirtatious eyes.
You're awesome."

1119
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:43,548
Ramesh.

1120
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:45,952
You're back?

1121
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:48,808
Where's Anjana?

1122
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:50,543
She must be on her way, sir.

1123
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:51,741
Sir.

1124
00:57:51,879 --> 00:57:53,915
It was so much fun today, sir.

1125
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:56,561
What happened?

1126
00:57:56,759 --> 00:57:58,936
Sir. Without playing the flute..

1127
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,721
I became the dancing Krishna.

1128
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:04,986
I entered a flock
of girls in no time.

1129
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:07,937
I spoke to them about love.

1130
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:10,831
While I was doing this,
miss Anjana left.

1131
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:13,713
Where did she go?

1132
00:58:13,774 --> 00:58:14,962
That Jhumroo?

1133
00:58:15,002 --> 00:58:16,305
She went with him.

1134
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:17,904
Father was right.

1135
00:58:18,052 --> 00:58:21,588
Son, don't love anyone
because someome has told you.

1136
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:23,412
Keep quiet.

1137
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:24,663
Quiet.

1138
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:26,078
You don't have brains.

1139
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,943
How did she go?

1140
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:29,133
Why did she go?

1141
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:33,986
What are you doing?

1142
00:58:34,435 --> 00:58:38,943
Father had said. Count till 10 if an
elder person is angry. I was counting.

1143
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:40,389
Idiot!

1144
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:41,484
Donkey!

1145
00:58:42,846 --> 00:58:45,205
I don't know which tribal
my daughter has gone with.

1146
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,119
You're standing here
staring at my face.

1147
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:48,670
Aren't you ashamed?

1148
00:58:50,056 --> 00:58:51,305
Idiot.

1149
00:58:58,808 --> 00:58:59,842
Mr. Ramesh.

1150
00:59:00,148 --> 00:59:01,592
I didn't expect this from you.

1151
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,176
Sir. Miss. Anjana is back.

1152
00:59:04,355 --> 00:59:05,408
I can see that.

1153
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:06,996
I have eyes.

1154
00:59:07,334 --> 00:59:08,334
You're so strange.

1155
00:59:08,397 --> 00:59:09,925
You left me in the forest all alone.

1156
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:11,704
And you came in the car.

1157
00:59:12,475 --> 00:59:13,544
How did you come?

1158
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,868
- I came walking, father.
- Hey!

1159
00:59:15,908 --> 00:59:17,366
Father had said.

1160
00:59:17,435 --> 00:59:19,924
Walking makes you healthy.

1161
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:21,513
Keep quiet, father's son.

1162
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:23,975
Anjana.

1163
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,536
You should be careful..

1164
00:59:27,018 --> 00:59:29,427
- That the settlement people.
- Jhumroo?

1165
00:59:29,854 --> 00:59:31,810
Father, if it wasn't for Jhumroo..

1166
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:33,469
I would've lost my way.

1167
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:34,601
It's okay.

1168
00:59:34,786 --> 00:59:36,971
- But you.
- Father, I do remember?

1169
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,900
One. No interfering in your work.

1170
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,948
Two. No meeting settlement people.

1171
00:59:43,064 --> 00:59:44,064
Three.

1172
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:46,017
Don't go out alone.

1173
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,451
Got it. I remember the first rule.

1174
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:49,726
I remember the 2nd rule.

1175
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:50,639
Third?

1176
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:52,536
Don't go out alone.

1177
00:59:56,336 --> 00:59:57,336
Ramesh.

1178
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:00,776
Listen.

1179
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:03,879
If Anjana goes to the
settlement down there..

1180
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:05,618
You'll have it from me.

1181
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,612
Yes, yes, sir.

1182
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:11,267
Strange. I am in trouble
if I listen to the father.

1183
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,307
I land in a difficulty
if I listen to the daughter.

1184
01:00:14,184 --> 01:00:15,979
Father. Father.

1185
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,594
You had said, son.

1186
01:00:17,634 --> 01:00:19,807
One should never interfere
in a daughter's affairs.

1187
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:21,955
Sorry.

1188
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:23,597
You're in heaven, father.

1189
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:24,742
Wrong number.

1190
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:26,909
Listen.

1191
01:00:27,315 --> 01:00:28,442
Everyone pay attention.

1192
01:00:28,769 --> 01:00:30,706
I've called all of you..

1193
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,335
For some urgent work.

1194
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,165
I am growing old.

1195
01:00:34,513 --> 01:00:36,345
So, I thought..

1196
01:00:36,421 --> 01:00:39,048
We should choose a commander
while I am still alive.

1197
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,839
So that I can train him..

1198
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:42,845
Teach him..

1199
01:00:42,885 --> 01:00:45,422
And make him capable
of handling this seat.

1200
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:50,267
Commander is right.

1201
01:00:50,735 --> 01:00:53,297
We have to choose a person..

1202
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:55,084
Who's intelligent.

1203
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:56,628
Brave.

1204
01:00:56,704 --> 01:00:58,639
And loved by everyone.

1205
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,803
Yes, baba's right. Baba's right.

1206
01:01:01,843 --> 01:01:03,112
I would suggest..

1207
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:05,004
Hariya to be made the commander.

1208
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:06,094
Yes! Right.

1209
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:07,582
In the entire tribe..

1210
01:01:07,848 --> 01:01:10,097
If anyone deserves
to be the commander..

1211
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:11,493
It's my Jhumroo.

1212
01:01:11,654 --> 01:01:13,494
Jhumroo and commander?

1213
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:15,434
Aunt.

1214
01:01:15,904 --> 01:01:18,366
It's not easy to be a commander.

1215
01:01:19,002 --> 01:01:21,709
Chasing city girls
is a different thing..

1216
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:23,219
Than being a commander.

1217
01:01:23,259 --> 01:01:24,034
Banno!

1218
01:01:24,282 --> 01:01:28,783
Hey! I'll pull out your tongue
if you say bad things about Jhumroo.

1219
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,290
- Chamki!
- Go away.

1220
01:01:30,466 --> 01:01:33,727
Talking loudly and
showing anger is different

1221
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:35,783
than becoming a commander.

1222
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:39,388
No body is more brave and courageous
than Jhumroo in the entire tribe.

1223
01:01:39,578 --> 01:01:41,409
Still I'll be the commander.

1224
01:01:42,509 --> 01:01:44,650
Everyone knows me very well.

1225
01:01:45,096 --> 01:01:46,964
Still they're building
castles in the wind.

1226
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:50,593
Aunt? Where's your Jhumroo?

1227
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,575
Today he didn't even
come here because of me.

1228
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:54,559
He'll come if he hasn't come yet.

1229
01:01:54,956 --> 01:01:57,307
I have made Jhumroo capable..

1230
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,429
Of being your commander.

1231
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,274
And shoulder the responsibility
of the entire tribe.

1232
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:05,113
That is my joy..

1233
01:02:05,535 --> 01:02:06,839
And my life.

1234
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,164
Fine.

1235
01:02:08,293 --> 01:02:10,515
Everyone has the right
to contest elections.

1236
01:02:10,652 --> 01:02:12,022
The decision will be transparent.

1237
01:02:12,109 --> 01:02:13,932
As per our tribe's rule.

1238
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,228
Whoever wins the elections
will be the chosen.

1239
01:02:16,827 --> 01:02:19,400
You're trying to defame my Jhumroo.

1240
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:23,596
My Jhumroo will never go against me.

1241
01:02:24,227 --> 01:02:25,958
Jhumroo will be the commander.

1242
01:02:25,998 --> 01:02:28,591
He'll marry a girl from this tribe.

1243
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:31,328
Jealous people like you
will fall flat on your face.

1244
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,420
Understand?

1245
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,121
Aunt, you're dreaming.

1246
01:02:37,237 --> 01:02:38,263
Didn't you hear?

1247
01:02:38,512 --> 01:02:40,924
Jhumroo will marry
a girl from this tribe.

1248
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:43,143
But after becoming the commander..

1249
01:02:43,492 --> 01:02:45,146
I am going to hold your hand.

1250
01:02:46,104 --> 01:02:47,714
You'll hold my hand?

1251
01:02:47,804 --> 01:02:50,512
Wash your face in a fistful of water.

1252
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:54,817
You!

1253
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,455
I am not going to leave
this hand all my life.

1254
01:03:11,479 --> 01:03:12,479
Really?

1255
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:14,939
Swear by me. You won't leave
my hand in your entire life.

1256
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:16,701
You? Go away.

1257
01:03:17,242 --> 01:03:19,942
Today you left my hand.
You'll fall at my feet tomorrow.

1258
01:03:20,705 --> 01:03:23,307
Your city girl is not
going to come here today.

1259
01:03:24,078 --> 01:03:25,078
How do you know?

1260
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:26,024
I won't tell you.

1261
01:03:26,134 --> 01:03:28,460
There's a feast at her place.
There's a celebration.

1262
01:03:28,588 --> 01:03:29,638
Fine, don't tell.

1263
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:32,849
Stop. You'll be cheated
if you go there.

1264
01:03:36,864 --> 01:03:39,221
Mr. Irani, how was your hunt?

1265
01:03:39,261 --> 01:03:40,875
How can I go hunting?

1266
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:42,695
Mr. Dwarka, you are a hunter.

1267
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:45,633
Mr. Shapoor sometimes you end up speaking
the truth while casual chatting.

1268
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:46,657
Huh?

1269
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:49,438
Excuse me.

1270
01:03:54,216 --> 01:03:55,216
Come, Anjana.

1271
01:04:03,101 --> 01:04:05,479
He's our retired deputy collector,
Mr. Mathur.

1272
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:06,223
His wife.

1273
01:04:06,435 --> 01:04:07,609
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1274
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:08,958
Come.

1275
01:04:10,617 --> 01:04:12,050
Let me introduce you to STO.

1276
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:14,686
He our STO.

1277
01:04:14,903 --> 01:04:16,124
Mr. Daleep Singh.

1278
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:17,222
His wife.

1279
01:04:17,262 --> 01:04:18,537
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1280
01:04:20,553 --> 01:04:21,553
Thank you.

1281
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:24,110
He is Mr. Shapoor.

1282
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,539
- His wife, Shirin. And Daughter.
- Greetings.

1283
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:27,579
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1284
01:04:27,852 --> 01:04:29,781
Come home some day, miss Anjana.

1285
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:31,380
Sure.

1286
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:32,605
Please come, sir.

1287
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:35,122
Never mind, forgot.

1288
01:04:37,781 --> 01:04:38,781
Sir.

1289
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:39,763
Coming.

1290
01:04:39,803 --> 01:04:42,244
- How do you like this place?
- It's lovely.

1291
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,645
I'll just come.

1292
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,266
Welcome. Miss.

1293
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:49,722
Miss!

1294
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,596
Yes.

1295
01:04:56,755 --> 01:04:58,249
You shouldn't have come here.

1296
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,376
I had to come here because you didn't
come even after making me a promise.

1297
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,946
I couldn't come
because of this party.

1298
01:05:01,986 --> 01:05:03,071
Let's go out.

1299
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,702
Why did you have to come here?

1300
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:08,291
Why wouldn't I come? I was urgent.

1301
01:05:08,357 --> 01:05:09,262
What's so urgent?

1302
01:05:09,354 --> 01:05:10,355
You forgot so soon?

1303
01:05:10,436 --> 01:05:11,256
Our festival.

1304
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,835
- Commander's election.
- I remember all of that.

1305
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:13,544
I'll come.

1306
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:15,940
- Look, just leave from here.
- I won't go.

1307
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:18,017
Greetings, Madame.

1308
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,360
Sir.

1309
01:05:19,455 --> 01:05:20,455
Greetings.

1310
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:21,930
What are you doing over here?

1311
01:05:21,954 --> 01:05:23,637
I got the news of walking..

1312
01:05:23,724 --> 01:05:24,844
And the celebration came.

1313
01:05:25,396 --> 01:05:27,436
I came because I got the
news about the celebration.

1314
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:29,045
Useless.

1315
01:05:29,678 --> 01:05:30,689
It's grand.

1316
01:05:30,729 --> 01:05:32,398
Such a celebration in this region..

1317
01:05:32,438 --> 01:05:33,624
Has never happened in the past.

1318
01:05:33,648 --> 01:05:34,648
I'm just..

1319
01:05:35,143 --> 01:05:36,143
I am just...

1320
01:05:37,127 --> 01:05:38,542
I came uninvited.

1321
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,644
No issues.

1322
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:43,088
But, sir. How are you feeling now?

1323
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:44,156
What?

1324
01:05:44,378 --> 01:05:45,522
How are you feeling?

1325
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:45,966
Better.

1326
01:05:46,086 --> 01:05:47,341
You had to be.

1327
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:49,114
Do you remember? In 12 months..

1328
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,016
The oil prepared
by mixing 13 herbs.

1329
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:52,950
I know.

1330
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:55,801
But, sir. You didn't come to
climb or descend the mountain again.

1331
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:58,854
The road is tired of waiting for you.

1332
01:05:58,976 --> 01:05:59,976
What nonsense?

1333
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,311
The mountain is tired
of waiting for you.

1334
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,425
You would've come,
climbed and then fallen down again.

1335
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:05,679
I would've given you a massage.

1336
01:06:05,703 --> 01:06:08,371
I am not very fond
of mountain climbing.

1337
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:10,373
I went just like that the other day.

1338
01:06:10,564 --> 01:06:11,564
Come, Anju.

1339
01:06:12,813 --> 01:06:14,599
Baby, one more thing. Sir.

1340
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:17,821
I've taught your daughter
to climb and descend a mountain.

1341
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:19,030
But I didn't get baby yet.

1342
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:19,645
What?

1343
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:20,757
I didn't get my reward.

1344
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:21,859
You'll get it.

1345
01:06:21,986 --> 01:06:22,562
Bhairo, get sweets.

1346
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:23,602
I'll eat.

1347
01:06:28,633 --> 01:06:30,041
Sweetmeat. Baby, eat.

1348
01:06:33,508 --> 01:06:34,722
I am sorry.

1349
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,369
Come here.

1350
01:06:46,988 --> 01:06:48,756
Dear friends.

1351
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:52,269
I've given you the
trouble to come here.

1352
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:54,680
There's a reason behind it.

1353
01:06:56,129 --> 01:06:58,679
I want to share a
good news with you all.

1354
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:02,274
As you're aware.

1355
01:07:02,828 --> 01:07:04,876
First let me introduce her.

1356
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,597
She's my daughter, Anjana.

1357
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:09,596
After completing her M.A..

1358
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,321
She has come here
for the first time.

1359
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:15,230
He is my secretary, Mr. Ramesh.

1360
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:18,186
He's a very interesting person.

1361
01:07:19,925 --> 01:07:22,798
On this happy occasion,
in your presence..

1362
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:25,555
I announce their engagement.

1363
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:26,595
Father!

1364
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:32,074
Congratulations, miss. Anjana.

1365
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,871
- Father had said.
- Congratulations, Anjana.

1366
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:36,960
Congratulations, Anjana.

1367
01:07:40,342 --> 01:07:42,318
Congratulations, miss. Anjana.

1368
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:43,958
Be it late..

1369
01:07:44,456 --> 01:07:46,831
But you did a favor by
clearing my misunderstanding.

1370
01:07:46,963 --> 01:07:48,451
What are you saying?

1371
01:07:48,546 --> 01:07:50,080
Jhumroo, don't misunderstand me.

1372
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:51,265
Jhumroo?

1373
01:07:55,194 --> 01:07:56,933
So you are Jhumroo.

1374
01:07:58,048 --> 01:08:00,202
You kept in the dark all this while.

1375
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:01,991
Father!

1376
01:08:03,231 --> 01:08:04,231
Kalu.

1377
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:05,224
Father!

1378
01:08:05,264 --> 01:08:06,322
Father.

1379
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:07,451
Take him away.

1380
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,694
Whip him.

1381
01:08:12,274 --> 01:08:13,881
- Kalu!
- Anju!

1382
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,266
Dwarka, what happened?

1383
01:08:15,306 --> 01:08:16,895
What's the matter? Who was he?

1384
01:08:17,278 --> 01:08:19,578
Nothing important.
He's from the settlement.

1385
01:08:19,618 --> 01:08:21,062
They come asking for alms.

1386
01:08:21,102 --> 01:08:22,435
Don't bother.

1387
01:08:22,544 --> 01:08:23,590
Come, let's have food.

1388
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:24,529
Let's go.

1389
01:08:25,044 --> 01:08:26,044
Please sit.

1390
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:31,550
Let's go.

1391
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:36,121
How she shines, really.

1392
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:37,895
That's it. Ah!

1393
01:08:38,506 --> 01:08:39,571
Come.

1394
01:08:39,725 --> 01:08:42,783
The person you're looking
for is right here.

1395
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:43,868
Where is he?

1396
01:08:44,196 --> 01:08:45,396
At your feet.

1397
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:46,479
See.

1398
01:08:46,837 --> 01:08:48,246
My injured heart.

1399
01:08:48,362 --> 01:08:50,394
Take care of it.

1400
01:08:50,764 --> 01:08:53,212
Jhumroo?
Where were you all this time?

1401
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:58,176
Hey? Hey?

1402
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,676
How did you get hurt?

1403
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,432
When an insect crawling on the ground
tries to touch the moon in the sky,

1404
01:09:04,471 --> 01:09:05,596
this is bound to happen.

1405
01:09:06,094 --> 01:09:07,754
- What say, Hariya?
- Yes, brother.

1406
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:09,692
Whoever walks with his
head held high will falter.

1407
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:12,737
He'll falter in such a way,
he'll come back to his senses.

1408
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,635
Have you never faltered?

1409
01:09:15,746 --> 01:09:17,897
You've broken your hands
and legs so many times.

1410
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,733
Even my heart is broken.

1411
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:23,771
Whose hands and legs
are going to break..

1412
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:26,434
Will come out in
the elections tomorrow.

1413
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:27,866
What will you know tomorrow?

1414
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:29,460
Tomorrow Jhumroo will
become the commander.

1415
01:09:29,484 --> 01:09:32,479
That coward will become
a commander when I am still here?

1416
01:09:32,636 --> 01:09:33,636
Look there.

1417
01:09:33,786 --> 01:09:35,407
He's running away.

1418
01:09:36,596 --> 01:09:37,596
Look Bannu.

1419
01:09:37,783 --> 01:09:39,585
I don't want to be the commander.

1420
01:09:39,626 --> 01:09:41,877
How will you become a commander?

1421
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:44,139
Go, my child.
Go, sleep in your mother's lap.

1422
01:09:44,203 --> 01:09:45,203
Shut up!

1423
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:46,901
Dare you take my mother's name.

1424
01:09:47,321 --> 01:09:48,321
What will happen?

1425
01:09:48,764 --> 01:09:49,764
Huh?

1426
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:51,712
You!

1427
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:54,179
Jhumroo. Thrash him up.

1428
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,817
Jhumroo, make a sauce out of him.

1429
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,080
Tear it.

1430
01:09:59,506 --> 01:10:00,506
Tear it.

1431
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:01,487
Leave it!

1432
01:10:01,717 --> 01:10:02,717
Leave! ♪

1433
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,987
Stop it! What's going on?

1434
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:09,311
Banno. If you're so powerful,
show it in the tomorrow's elections.

1435
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:11,317
Here's your knife.

1436
01:10:11,357 --> 01:10:12,501
Get out of here.

1437
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:14,458
Aunt.

1438
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,807
Don't forget to send your
dear son to the election tomorrow.

1439
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:19,139
Go.

1440
01:10:19,776 --> 01:10:21,429
Mother, I don't want
to become the commander.

1441
01:10:21,453 --> 01:10:22,453
Jhumroo?

1442
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,325
Don't ever say it again.

1443
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:27,339
You have to become the commander.

1444
01:10:27,939 --> 01:10:29,481
Not for yourself, my son.

1445
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:30,384
For me.

1446
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:31,654
For my honor.

1447
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:34,913
Can't you do just
this for your mother?

1448
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:36,993
Say, yes. Say yes, my son.

1449
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:38,884
Jhumroo?

1450
01:10:41,465 --> 01:10:42,868
If this makes you happy..

1451
01:10:43,664 --> 01:10:45,206
I'll try to become the commander.

1452
01:10:45,306 --> 01:10:48,399
Don't try.
You'll definitely become one, my son.

1453
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,583
You surely will.

1454
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:54,739
Brothers.

1455
01:10:55,345 --> 01:10:56,706
The king gets fame.

1456
01:10:57,078 --> 01:10:58,317
Public works hard.

1457
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:00,440
The commander of
this tribe has ordered..

1458
01:11:00,759 --> 01:11:03,341
All of you to gather
at the settlement's crossroads.

1459
01:11:03,594 --> 01:11:06,611
The elections for selecting
the commander is about to begin.

1460
01:12:12,876 --> 01:12:14,732
Yes!

1461
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,733
Wow! Jhumroo!

1462
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:34,669
Hey!

1463
01:12:34,785 --> 01:12:37,348
Jhumroo! Very good, Jhumroo!

1464
01:13:07,358 --> 01:13:11,345
Hey! Wow!

1465
01:13:16,204 --> 01:13:17,235
Listen!

1466
01:13:17,533 --> 01:13:21,198
The last fight between Jhumroo
and Banno is about to begin.

1467
01:14:03,533 --> 01:14:04,764
Is there a brave heart..

1468
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:06,839
Who will stand in
front of Jhumroo's aim?

1469
01:14:38,911 --> 01:14:40,770
Jhumroo!

1470
01:14:40,966 --> 01:14:42,332
Hey!

1471
01:15:07,063 --> 01:15:09,146
Very good, Chamki. Very good.

1472
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:11,158
Long live, commander Jhumroo.

1473
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:12,558
I don't agree.

1474
01:15:13,065 --> 01:15:13,664
Is it?

1475
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,380
This is a game of gypsies.

1476
01:15:15,973 --> 01:15:17,323
Come in front if you're a man.

1477
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:44,052
Tell me. Tell me.

1478
01:16:44,593 --> 01:16:45,814
Tell me who your commander is.

1479
01:16:47,424 --> 01:16:48,834
Jhumroo's the commander.

1480
01:16:49,621 --> 01:16:50,621
Long live.

1481
01:16:51,308 --> 01:16:53,154
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1482
01:16:53,194 --> 01:16:54,749
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1483
01:16:54,789 --> 01:16:56,105
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1484
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:57,875
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1485
01:16:57,915 --> 01:16:59,326
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1486
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:00,927
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1487
01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:02,616
Brothers.

1488
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:05,626
With his bravery and
courage Jhumroo has proved..

1489
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:07,980
That Jhumroo deserves
to be the commander.

1490
01:17:08,113 --> 01:17:09,560
I announce..

1491
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,509
That after me..

1492
01:17:10,549 --> 01:17:12,179
Jhumroo will be the
commander of this tribe.

1493
01:17:12,203 --> 01:17:13,875
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1494
01:17:13,915 --> 01:17:16,122
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1495
01:17:17,153 --> 01:17:18,196
Mother!

1496
01:17:18,332 --> 01:17:19,492
Jhumroo! My son.

1497
01:17:19,827 --> 01:17:20,827
Jhumroo.

1498
01:17:21,457 --> 01:17:22,457
Jhumroo.

1499
01:17:22,945 --> 01:17:24,523
You saved my honor today.

1500
01:17:24,945 --> 01:17:27,813
You've fulfilled all my dreams today.

1501
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:29,110
Now in this tribe..

1502
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:30,804
I can hold my head high with pride.

1503
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:37,079
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1504
01:17:38,142 --> 01:17:40,301
Long live commander Jhumroo!

1505
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:42,389
As per our tribe's tradition..

1506
01:17:42,516 --> 01:17:44,437
The song and dance ceremony
of choosing one's husband will begin.

1507
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:45,738
At the end of the song..

1508
01:17:45,885 --> 01:17:48,569
Whichever girl
garlands Jhumroo first..

1509
01:17:48,653 --> 01:17:50,341
Will marry him.

1510
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:52,983
Wow!

1511
01:17:53,389 --> 01:17:55,098
She's so happy.

1512
01:17:56,086 --> 01:17:57,563
You'll become mere spectators.

1513
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:00,635
I will get married.

1514
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:02,422
To Jhumroo.

1515
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:50,273
- "Come here.
- No."

1516
01:18:50,613 --> 01:18:51,613
"Go."

1517
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:02,475
- "World of love.
- Where are you coming?"

1518
01:19:02,515 --> 01:19:04,875
- "World of love.
- Where are you coming?"

1519
01:19:04,915 --> 01:19:07,354
- "To persuade my bride.
- Go away, you madman."

1520
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:10,088
- "To persuade my bride.
- Go away, you madman."

1521
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:14,877
"I won't leave your doorstep, girl."

1522
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,293
"I'll die if I can't live, girl."

1523
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:19,704
"I want to achieve something
before leaving, girl."

1524
01:19:22,298 --> 01:19:26,788
- "Come here.
- No."

1525
01:19:27,133 --> 01:19:31,907
- "Go.
- Never."

1526
01:19:31,947 --> 01:19:36,406
- "Come here.
- No."

1527
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:41,518
- "Go.
- Never."

1528
01:19:41,558 --> 01:19:43,673
"Come here."

1529
01:20:15,826 --> 01:20:18,234
- "Stop your heart.
- Heart doesn't listen."

1530
01:20:18,274 --> 01:20:20,655
- "Stop your heart.
- Heart doesn't listen."

1531
01:20:20,695 --> 01:20:23,086
- "It's a lie, my dear.
- Swear by love."

1532
01:20:23,126 --> 01:20:25,527
- "It's a lie, my dear.
- Swear by love."

1533
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,749
"People have always
lost their senses in love."

1534
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:33,173
"They lift an amber
mistaking it for a flower."

1535
01:20:33,213 --> 01:20:35,683
"He who plays with fire will burn."

1536
01:20:38,302 --> 01:20:42,851
- "Come here.
- No."

1537
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:48,003
- "Go.
- Never."

1538
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:52,800
- "Come here.
- No."

1539
01:20:52,884 --> 01:20:57,725
- "Go.
- Never."

1540
01:20:57,796 --> 01:21:00,053
"Come here."

1541
01:22:14,611 --> 01:22:16,499
This is the biggest
failure of my life..

1542
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:18,553
I had to come with you, Chamki.

1543
01:22:19,207 --> 01:22:20,333
At last, you won.

1544
01:22:20,968 --> 01:22:22,059
Your wish is fulfilled.

1545
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:23,687
But remember.

1546
01:22:24,596 --> 01:22:26,220
You will never get my love.

1547
01:22:27,391 --> 01:22:29,911
Even if I become the commander
of the tribe's honor is at stake.

1548
01:22:30,553 --> 01:22:32,496
The person I loved once..

1549
01:22:32,992 --> 01:22:34,379
I will never forget her.

1550
01:22:35,976 --> 01:22:36,976
Who?

1551
01:22:37,337 --> 01:22:39,552
I don't have any
right to say her name.

1552
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:47,978
You have the right.

1553
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:51,123
Anju? You?

1554
01:22:51,946 --> 01:22:52,946
Yes, Jhumroo.

1555
01:22:53,513 --> 01:22:55,164
Because of that day's
misunderstanding..

1556
01:22:55,523 --> 01:22:56,728
Don't misunderstand me.

1557
01:22:57,332 --> 01:23:00,061
I had to bend in front
of my father's adamancy.

1558
01:23:01,174 --> 01:23:02,174
Do you remember?

1559
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:03,777
I had promised you.

1560
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:05,988
When you'll become
the tribe's commander..

1561
01:23:06,278 --> 01:23:07,382
I'll definitely come.

1562
01:23:08,007 --> 01:23:09,070
I've come.

1563
01:23:09,492 --> 01:23:10,492
But?

1564
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:12,445
Your marriage was announced that day.

1565
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,750
That was wrong.

1566
01:23:14,029 --> 01:23:16,315
Anyone can be forced.

1567
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:17,950
The tribe stopped you..

1568
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:19,158
And father stopped me.

1569
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:21,467
But the storm of love..

1570
01:23:21,536 --> 01:23:22,776
Cannot be stopped by anyone.

1571
01:23:23,146 --> 01:23:24,146
Anju.

1572
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:25,788
You still don't believe?

1573
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:21,974
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1574
01:24:22,304 --> 01:24:27,931
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1575
01:24:28,498 --> 01:24:34,030
"My love, my steps are not on track.
Something is wrong with me."

1576
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:40,691
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1577
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:11,237
"The weather is pleasant.
My eyes are silent."

1578
01:25:11,472 --> 01:25:14,327
"I forgot everything."

1579
01:25:14,559 --> 01:25:17,422
"You say something."

1580
01:25:17,649 --> 01:25:20,510
- "The weather is pleasant.
- Pleasant."

1581
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:23,817
- "My eyes are silent.
- Silent."

1582
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:26,929
"I forgot everything."

1583
01:25:26,969 --> 01:25:30,064
"You say something."

1584
01:25:30,104 --> 01:25:33,109
"You left."

1585
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:36,225
"Came back."

1586
01:25:36,294 --> 01:25:39,052
"You're shy."

1587
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:43,070
"It's like a fable."

1588
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:48,903
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1589
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:55,275
"My love, my steps are not on track.
Something is wrong with me."

1590
01:25:55,315 --> 01:26:01,228
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1591
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:31,499
"Why are you anxious?
Why has your kohl become dull?"

1592
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:37,706
"Why do clouds fly
on the moon's face?"

1593
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:40,790
- "Why are you anxious?
- Anxious."

1594
01:26:40,978 --> 01:26:44,015
- "Why has your kohl become dull?
- Dull."

1595
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:46,876
"On moon's face."

1596
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:49,932
"Why do clouds fly?"

1597
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:53,096
"Magician.."

1598
01:26:53,236 --> 01:26:56,126
"Your eyes."

1599
01:26:56,321 --> 01:26:59,240
"After getting lost in love.."

1600
01:26:59,343 --> 01:27:03,053
"My heart is going crazy."

1601
01:27:03,506 --> 01:27:09,220
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1602
01:27:09,663 --> 01:27:15,171
"My love, my steps are not on track.
Something is wrong with me."

1603
01:27:15,211 --> 01:27:21,072
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1604
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:48,320
"In love.."

1605
01:27:48,589 --> 01:27:51,400
"After I found my love."

1606
01:27:51,663 --> 01:27:54,432
"I am not in my senses."

1607
01:27:54,696 --> 01:27:57,531
"What's wrong with you?"

1608
01:27:57,615 --> 01:28:00,624
- "In love..
- Yes."

1609
01:28:00,885 --> 01:28:03,665
- "..After I found my love.
- What happened?"

1610
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,763
- "I am not in my senses.
- Alright."

1611
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,883
"What's wrong with you?"

1612
01:28:10,078 --> 01:28:12,903
"When I met you.."

1613
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:16,145
"I was pleased."

1614
01:28:16,185 --> 01:28:18,970
"My heart was pleased."

1615
01:28:19,215 --> 01:28:22,905
"I've become crazy."

1616
01:28:22,945 --> 01:28:28,905
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1617
01:28:29,074 --> 01:28:35,007
"My love, my steps are not on track.
Something is wrong with me."

1618
01:28:35,191 --> 01:28:38,285
"My love,
my innocent heart is lost somewhere."

1619
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:00,946
Where's Anjana?

1620
01:29:03,258 --> 01:29:04,258
Here she is.

1621
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:06,483
But we won't let her go.

1622
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,333
She tried to destroy us.

1623
01:29:08,679 --> 01:29:10,529
She made fun of our tradition.

1624
01:29:11,209 --> 01:29:12,979
She'll be punished for it.

1625
01:29:13,228 --> 01:29:14,454
Stop your nonsense.

1626
01:29:14,701 --> 01:29:16,891
Sir, why are you staring at us?

1627
01:29:16,988 --> 01:29:18,108
We're not at fault.

1628
01:29:18,184 --> 01:29:19,258
Your daughter is.

1629
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,614
Whatever she's done..

1630
01:29:20,654 --> 01:29:22,268
She should be punished for it.

1631
01:29:22,444 --> 01:29:23,444
Shut up.

1632
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:24,910
Stay in your limits.

1633
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:28,148
I can crush you if I want.

1634
01:29:28,716 --> 01:29:29,963
I can ruin you.

1635
01:29:30,381 --> 01:29:32,798
Sir, a person is
responsible for his honor.

1636
01:29:33,065 --> 01:29:34,394
You too are a human being.

1637
01:29:34,506 --> 01:29:35,512
Not God.

1638
01:29:35,586 --> 01:29:36,586
Amar!

1639
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,403
Kalu.

1640
01:29:39,527 --> 01:29:40,527
Father!

1641
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:43,711
Get into the car.

1642
01:29:46,033 --> 01:29:47,501
You can't take Anjana.

1643
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:50,677
As per the tribe's tradition,
Ajana will get married to me.

1644
01:29:50,884 --> 01:29:53,027
If you take even a step towards me..

1645
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,301
I'll shoot you.

1646
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,685
Drop the gun.

1647
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:05,598
Hand over Anjana to me.

1648
01:30:10,594 --> 01:30:11,623
If that's the case..

1649
01:30:11,975 --> 01:30:13,496
Then shoot me first.

1650
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:15,220
Jhumroo!

1651
01:30:16,321 --> 01:30:17,648
Sir, take your daughter.

1652
01:30:17,783 --> 01:30:19,046
Lock her in your house.

1653
01:30:19,112 --> 01:30:20,112
No.

1654
01:30:21,368 --> 01:30:22,033
Leave me!

1655
01:30:22,235 --> 01:30:23,330
Jhumroo! Wake up!

1656
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:27,370
Saw your son's act?

1657
01:30:28,067 --> 01:30:29,067
Keep quiet.

1658
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:35,663
Anjana.

1659
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,199
Anjana.

1660
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:41,221
Mother, you don't understand.

1661
01:30:41,584 --> 01:30:44,021
I just won't let Dwarkanath
continue with his atrocities.

1662
01:30:44,097 --> 01:30:44,665
Keep quiet.

1663
01:30:45,063 --> 01:30:46,316
Answer me.

1664
01:30:47,855 --> 01:30:49,416
Is Anjana his daughter?

1665
01:30:50,182 --> 01:30:51,182
Yes, she's his daughter.

1666
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,745
You love her?

1667
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,083
More than my life.

1668
01:30:56,745 --> 01:30:57,420
What about her?

1669
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:58,354
She too.

1670
01:30:58,628 --> 01:30:59,628
Once.

1671
01:30:59,797 --> 01:31:01,217
Take me to her, son.

1672
01:31:01,257 --> 01:31:02,068
Really, mother?

1673
01:31:02,222 --> 01:31:03,222
Come with me.

1674
01:31:03,735 --> 01:31:06,036
Stupid. Do one thing. Bring her here.

1675
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,888
- Alright.
- Listen.

1676
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,369
No one should come to know of this.

1677
01:31:16,467 --> 01:31:17,467
Jhumroo.

1678
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:20,383
Jhumroo.

1679
01:31:20,612 --> 01:31:21,831
Why have you come here?

1680
01:31:21,955 --> 01:31:23,881
Father is still angry
about yesterday's incident.

1681
01:31:24,186 --> 01:31:25,522
I shouldn't meet you.

1682
01:31:25,562 --> 01:31:26,895
I shouldn't come to you.

1683
01:31:26,935 --> 01:31:28,585
He has imprisoned me here.

1684
01:31:29,536 --> 01:31:30,639
You go away.

1685
01:31:30,726 --> 01:31:32,197
They'll kill you.

1686
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:33,237
- Jhumroo.
- No, Anju.

1687
01:31:33,388 --> 01:31:34,428
I don't care about anyone.

1688
01:31:34,668 --> 01:31:36,468
I've come to fetch you.
I'll take you with me.

1689
01:31:36,548 --> 01:31:38,159
Thief! Thief!

1690
01:31:38,308 --> 01:31:39,308
Come with me.

1691
01:31:50,762 --> 01:31:52,083
Looks like your father's car.

1692
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,493
- Now what?
- Don't be afraid. Come with me.

1693
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:27,713
I fear..

1694
01:32:27,929 --> 01:32:29,400
Dad won't get us together.

1695
01:32:29,743 --> 01:32:30,834
They will kill you.

1696
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:32,404
No body can separate me from you.

1697
01:32:32,726 --> 01:32:34,858
- Not even your father?
- How's that possible?

1698
01:32:34,898 --> 01:32:36,068
I'll elope with you.

1699
01:32:36,164 --> 01:32:37,881
Your father will
become a mere spectator.

1700
01:32:37,967 --> 01:32:38,643
Really Jhumroo?

1701
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:40,185
You love me so much?

1702
01:32:40,426 --> 01:32:41,626
Yes, Anju. More than my life.

1703
01:32:42,018 --> 01:32:43,018
Really?

1704
01:32:44,878 --> 01:32:46,048
Jhumroo.

1705
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,501
Jhumroo.

1706
01:32:49,174 --> 01:32:50,436
Jhumroo. Come to me.

1707
01:32:55,664 --> 01:32:58,083
Jhumroo.

1708
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:06,795
- What is it?
- Tell us where our Madame baby is.

1709
01:33:06,939 --> 01:33:07,770
Who Madame baby?

1710
01:33:07,908 --> 01:33:10,172
Who Madame baby?
Whom were you talking to?

1711
01:33:10,212 --> 01:33:11,461
I was talking to myself.

1712
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:13,433
Talking to myself?
You're telling lies?

1713
01:33:13,473 --> 01:33:14,877
Look around if I am lying.

1714
01:33:15,519 --> 01:33:17,170
I'll see. I'll definitely see.

1715
01:33:17,665 --> 01:33:19,366
Nandu. Go there.

1716
01:33:19,455 --> 01:33:20,484
I'll check here.

1717
01:33:20,737 --> 01:33:22,102
He's trying to act smart with us.

1718
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:31,077
- Anjana!
- Not Anjana, Chamki.

1719
01:33:31,281 --> 01:33:33,315
That witch meets you here secretly?

1720
01:33:33,355 --> 01:33:35,381
I'll correct her right away.

1721
01:33:36,212 --> 01:33:39,096
Batwoman.
Don't you sleep at night? Go home.

1722
01:33:39,264 --> 01:33:43,356
Go home? I'll go to sir right away and
expose you in front of the village court.

1723
01:33:43,396 --> 01:33:44,396
Chamki!

1724
01:33:44,553 --> 01:33:45,553
- Chamki!
- Sir.

1725
01:34:08,072 --> 01:34:12,516
"Forget it. Go."

1726
01:34:13,156 --> 01:34:15,068
"Forget it. Go."

1727
01:34:20,255 --> 01:34:22,597
"Go."

1728
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,954
"Go."

1729
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:28,453
"Forget it."

1730
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,824
"I am not less either."

1731
01:35:13,412 --> 01:35:15,727
"I'll slap you."

1732
01:35:16,096 --> 01:35:18,037
"I am not less either."

1733
01:35:18,749 --> 01:35:20,341
"I'll slap you."

1734
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:28,797
"You're dancing."

1735
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:31,460
"I'll make you forget
all your sorrows."

1736
01:35:32,179 --> 01:35:33,980
"You're dancing."

1737
01:35:34,858 --> 01:35:36,446
"I'll make you forget
all your sorrows."

1738
01:35:37,327 --> 01:35:39,729
"Sa..re..ga..ma..ma..re..ga."

1739
01:35:47,406 --> 01:35:49,826
"Ma..ma..ma..ma..re..ga."

1740
01:35:50,019 --> 01:35:52,405
"Ma..ma..ma..ma..re..ga."

1741
01:35:52,572 --> 01:35:54,862
"Pa..pa..ni..pani."

1742
01:35:55,113 --> 01:35:57,312
"Pa..pa..ni..pani."

1743
01:35:57,429 --> 01:35:58,681
"Pa..pa..ni..ni."

1744
01:35:59,935 --> 01:36:00,935
"Forget it."

1745
01:36:21,926 --> 01:36:24,289
"I'll expose you."

1746
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:26,891
"You're going to die."

1747
01:36:27,265 --> 01:36:29,689
"I'll break your skull."

1748
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,485
"You're going to die."

1749
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:32,577
"Die."

1750
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,493
"Let me eat."

1751
01:37:31,216 --> 01:37:32,216
Who's there?

1752
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,170
Who's there?

1753
01:37:40,544 --> 01:37:41,544
Where had you been?

1754
01:37:43,912 --> 01:37:44,912
You know it.

1755
01:37:44,964 --> 01:37:45,964
Why did you go?

1756
01:37:47,244 --> 01:37:49,082
You don't have any
choice in this house.

1757
01:37:51,218 --> 01:37:53,615
No matter what,
I won't let your foolishness.."

1758
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,283
"Harm my honor."

1759
01:37:56,856 --> 01:37:58,005
Because of your adamancy..

1760
01:37:58,435 --> 01:38:00,257
I won't let my
dignity be humiliated.

1761
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,975
Love may not have any
importance in your eyes.

1762
01:38:04,652 --> 01:38:06,039
But this false honor..

1763
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:09,582
I can refuse respect, wealth and
everything in this world for love.

1764
01:38:09,737 --> 01:38:10,737
Shut up!

1765
01:38:13,474 --> 01:38:15,154
Your decision will
not work in this house..

1766
01:38:15,351 --> 01:38:16,612
Only mine will.

1767
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,239
Don't touch.

1768
01:38:32,803 --> 01:38:34,290
You slapped me today.

1769
01:38:35,244 --> 01:38:36,463
Just because you're a father?

1770
01:38:37,384 --> 01:38:38,384
Had..

1771
01:38:41,273 --> 01:38:42,728
My mother been here.

1772
01:38:46,567 --> 01:38:47,640
Anjana, my child.

1773
01:38:49,369 --> 01:38:50,374
Uncle Bihari?

1774
01:38:51,436 --> 01:38:51,911
You?

1775
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:53,367
You're here?

1776
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:55,956
So many years have passed
since I visited this place.

1777
01:38:56,323 --> 01:38:57,483
I wouldn't have come today.

1778
01:38:58,327 --> 01:38:59,943
But I had to come for you.

1779
01:39:00,803 --> 01:39:02,382
Since the day you came here..

1780
01:39:03,236 --> 01:39:06,421
Not even once
did Dwarka treat you..

1781
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:09,485
Like a father treats his child.

1782
01:39:13,179 --> 01:39:14,179
Today.

1783
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:17,327
- Father.
- Slapped you.

1784
01:39:19,028 --> 01:39:22,211
That cruel man can do anything
in the pride of fake honor.

1785
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:24,804
Your mother became
a victim of his cruelty..

1786
01:39:24,844 --> 01:39:26,324
And she'll shedding tears even today.

1787
01:39:27,942 --> 01:39:28,942
Mother?

1788
01:39:30,887 --> 01:39:31,960
My mother's alive?

1789
01:39:32,825 --> 01:39:33,948
Uncle Bihari?

1790
01:39:34,217 --> 01:39:35,512
Where's my mother?

1791
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,220
I beg of you. I fall at your feet.

1792
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:39,414
Where's my mother?

1793
01:39:39,454 --> 01:39:41,318
Tell me quickly. Where's my mother?

1794
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:42,636
I came here to tell you that.

1795
01:39:44,343 --> 01:39:46,571
This storm will not calm
down if I don't tell you.

1796
01:39:48,534 --> 01:39:50,100
Your mother..

1797
01:39:50,675 --> 01:39:52,329
Was a poor labourer.

1798
01:39:53,278 --> 01:39:55,706
But she was very
innocent and beautiful.

1799
01:39:57,077 --> 01:39:58,822
Dwarka saw her..

1800
01:40:00,712 --> 01:40:03,056
They fell in love with each other.

1801
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:04,594
They went ahead.

1802
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,170
You were born.

1803
01:40:08,074 --> 01:40:10,049
But in spite of repeated requests..

1804
01:40:10,914 --> 01:40:13,345
The proud man
refused to get married.

1805
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:17,619
Poor girl was heartbroken.

1806
01:40:19,047 --> 01:40:21,855
But your smile wiped her tears.

1807
01:40:23,164 --> 01:40:25,052
She went to the settlement with you.

1808
01:40:26,618 --> 01:40:29,424
Dwarka was not sorry
that your mother left him.

1809
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:32,893
But even a monster loves his child.

1810
01:40:33,793 --> 01:40:36,491
In a fit of rage, he landed
at the settlement on one night.

1811
01:40:37,143 --> 01:40:39,821
He forcefully separated
you from your mother.

1812
01:40:40,825 --> 01:40:42,210
Then he sent you to town.

1813
01:40:46,697 --> 01:40:48,287
Do I have the same blood?

1814
01:40:48,533 --> 01:40:49,533
Yes, my child.

1815
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,948
The tribe took..

1816
01:40:52,143 --> 01:40:53,143
Their revenge on me.

1817
01:40:53,796 --> 01:40:57,218
They abducted my son.
My wife died of this shock.

1818
01:40:58,789 --> 01:41:01,998
Dwarka fraudulently transferred
all my property to his name.

1819
01:41:03,269 --> 01:41:04,735
Dwarka didn't just give me..

1820
01:41:05,054 --> 01:41:06,929
Hatred and deceit..

1821
01:41:07,656 --> 01:41:09,362
But also two square meals..

1822
01:41:09,903 --> 01:41:12,519
And alcohol to forget my grief.

1823
01:41:12,999 --> 01:41:14,328
I still get it.

1824
01:41:16,989 --> 01:41:17,989
But?

1825
01:41:19,214 --> 01:41:20,316
Where's my mother?

1826
01:41:21,912 --> 01:41:23,797
I can't survive without her.

1827
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:25,731
Tell me.

1828
01:41:27,886 --> 01:41:29,745
You don't know or?

1829
01:41:30,697 --> 01:41:32,466
Poor gypsy woman, Kamli.

1830
01:41:33,057 --> 01:41:34,462
One day.

1831
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,560
What?

1832
01:41:35,754 --> 01:41:36,754
No.

1833
01:41:37,062 --> 01:41:39,755
If you want to know about
your mother's whereabouts..

1834
01:41:40,535 --> 01:41:42,679
Go to the tribe's settlement.

1835
01:41:43,248 --> 01:41:44,248
Ask Kamli.

1836
01:41:45,507 --> 01:41:47,725
She'll tell you about
your mother's whereabouts.

1837
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,374
What did you tell
Anjana about her mother?

1838
01:42:11,603 --> 01:42:15,090
Dwarka, do you remember?
A genuine alcoholic never lies.

1839
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:17,958
He can't tolerate
cruelty towards anyone.

1840
01:42:18,551 --> 01:42:20,744
You ruined her mother's life.

1841
01:42:21,162 --> 01:42:24,624
Now you want to destroy your
daughter's dreams for your adamancy?

1842
01:42:24,802 --> 01:42:26,698
I don't argue.

1843
01:42:27,581 --> 01:42:30,452
I just want to know
what you told Anjana.

1844
01:42:30,629 --> 01:42:32,061
Something she should've known.

1845
01:42:32,341 --> 01:42:33,446
Not because..

1846
01:42:33,657 --> 01:42:35,812
I want to avenge
my destruction from you.

1847
01:42:36,075 --> 01:42:38,978
I value humanity more than wealth.

1848
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,523
I can crush your humanity
and throw it away.

1849
01:42:41,973 --> 01:42:46,564
Who all are you going to sacrifice in
the name of false pride and selfishness?

1850
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:49,433
In spite of being a friend
you fraudulently ruined me.

1851
01:42:49,903 --> 01:42:52,463
You didn't give the love
of your life, a wife's status.

1852
01:42:52,658 --> 01:42:55,245
Today you're hell bent
on ruining your own child?

1853
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:56,800
Mind your tongue.

1854
01:42:57,587 --> 01:42:59,957
Don't forget that you're
surviving on food throw by me.

1855
01:43:00,099 --> 01:43:01,921
You took away this food from me.

1856
01:43:04,117 --> 01:43:05,117
Bihari.

1857
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:06,046
Dwarka.

1858
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:07,816
Bihari, remember.

1859
01:43:08,913 --> 01:43:12,265
If Anjana comes to know
her mother's name or address..

1860
01:43:13,693 --> 01:43:15,615
I'll kill you.

1861
01:43:18,361 --> 01:43:20,795
You've used this all your life.

1862
01:43:21,104 --> 01:43:23,258
I don't care about my life.

1863
01:43:24,589 --> 01:43:26,171
What more can happen?

1864
01:43:27,263 --> 01:43:29,029
The arrow has already left the bow.

1865
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,530
What do you mean?

1866
01:43:30,556 --> 01:43:32,942
You can't stop the mother
and daughter from uniting.

1867
01:43:33,606 --> 01:43:34,292
See.

1868
01:43:34,566 --> 01:43:36,201
There goes your daughter.

1869
01:43:36,607 --> 01:43:40,457
Unfortunate Kamli from the settlement
will tell her who her mother is.

1870
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:50,703
This cannot happen
as long as I am alive.

1871
01:44:02,594 --> 01:44:03,654
Anybody there?

1872
01:44:07,452 --> 01:44:09,456
Kamli owns this hotel, right?

1873
01:44:13,218 --> 01:44:14,362
Are you Kamli?

1874
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:23,179
I came to know that you
know a lot about Anjana's mother.

1875
01:44:24,007 --> 01:44:25,252
Is it true?

1876
01:44:26,222 --> 01:44:27,222
Answer me.

1877
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:33,972
I've come to warn you.

1878
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:37,585
Anjana should not know the truth.

1879
01:44:38,031 --> 01:44:39,031
Understand?

1880
01:44:40,366 --> 01:44:42,982
I find coming to such
a place disrespectful.

1881
01:44:43,947 --> 01:44:46,096
I had to come for my daughter's good.

1882
01:44:47,309 --> 01:44:48,962
It's your good fortune..

1883
01:44:49,769 --> 01:44:52,031
That I stepped into your hut.

1884
01:44:54,868 --> 01:44:56,487
Sir, you're right.

1885
01:44:56,527 --> 01:44:58,311
Stop this pretence
of touching my feet.

1886
01:44:58,814 --> 01:45:01,504
I know that to keep
your mouths shut..

1887
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:03,302
I'll have to pay a price.

1888
01:45:04,124 --> 01:45:05,124
Here.

1889
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:12,449
You still have habit
of buying everything..

1890
01:45:12,489 --> 01:45:14,352
With money?

1891
01:45:14,545 --> 01:45:15,545
Kamli?

1892
01:45:19,495 --> 01:45:20,495
Kamla?

1893
01:45:21,744 --> 01:45:24,671
- You?
- Your daughter's unfortunate mother.

1894
01:45:26,269 --> 01:45:27,954
You recognised her.

1895
01:45:29,038 --> 01:45:30,462
I didn't know..

1896
01:45:30,675 --> 01:45:31,675
That you're here.

1897
01:45:31,988 --> 01:45:32,988
Because..

1898
01:45:33,186 --> 01:45:34,186
I am helpless.

1899
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:35,399
I am weak.

1900
01:45:35,799 --> 01:45:37,210
I am a victim of your cruelty.

1901
01:45:38,043 --> 01:45:40,256
You cheated me for
your ulterior motives.

1902
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:44,322
You ruined me for your false pride.

1903
01:45:45,666 --> 01:45:47,578
You took away my daughter from me.

1904
01:45:48,225 --> 01:45:49,865
The stone heart of this father..

1905
01:45:50,424 --> 01:45:53,920
Has hit a mother's affectionate
delicate heart in such a way..

1906
01:45:55,124 --> 01:45:56,539
The wound..

1907
01:45:57,243 --> 01:45:58,277
Will never heal.

1908
01:45:58,960 --> 01:45:59,960
Never.

1909
01:46:00,007 --> 01:46:00,650
Never.

1910
01:46:00,998 --> 01:46:02,153
Kamla, look.

1911
01:46:02,807 --> 01:46:05,441
There's no use talking about it.

1912
01:46:06,456 --> 01:46:07,456
Not you.

1913
01:46:08,292 --> 01:46:10,067
It's the question
of my daughter's life.

1914
01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:13,215
I understand my responsibility.

1915
01:46:13,787 --> 01:46:14,818
I am her mother.

1916
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,240
I am her father.

1917
01:46:16,941 --> 01:46:19,116
I gave her the love
of both mother and father.

1918
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:21,394
I brought her up.

1919
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:23,197
I educated her.

1920
01:46:23,655 --> 01:46:26,050
Respect,
honor, status, wealth, property.

1921
01:46:26,949 --> 01:46:29,415
After spending all her
life in educated culture..

1922
01:46:30,004 --> 01:46:31,913
When all if a sudden
Anjana comes to know..

1923
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,117
That you are her mother..

1924
01:46:34,699 --> 01:46:36,671
She is related to you by blood.

1925
01:46:37,318 --> 01:46:39,398
A settlement of illiterate,
rural and tribal people..

1926
01:46:39,622 --> 01:46:40,682
Is her house.

1927
01:46:41,064 --> 01:46:42,472
What will she go through?

1928
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:44,253
This is the difference
between the land and sky.

1929
01:46:44,277 --> 01:46:45,532
How will she take it?

1930
01:46:46,291 --> 01:46:48,227
Her life,
her dreams and her desires..

1931
01:46:48,678 --> 01:46:50,046
Will be ruined.

1932
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,678
Your honor..

1933
01:46:51,826 --> 01:46:53,830
And false pride
will also be ruined.

1934
01:46:54,508 --> 01:46:56,268
You value it more than
a mother's affection..

1935
01:46:56,366 --> 01:46:58,310
And a daughter's love.

1936
01:46:59,314 --> 01:47:01,178
To hug my daughter..

1937
01:47:01,729 --> 01:47:04,150
My arms are dying
since last 20 years.

1938
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:05,858
Today..

1939
01:47:06,534 --> 01:47:07,614
You'll have to pay the..

1940
01:47:07,965 --> 01:47:09,360
Price of it.

1941
01:47:11,053 --> 01:47:12,053
Tell me.

1942
01:47:12,769 --> 01:47:13,877
What price do you quote?

1943
01:47:14,552 --> 01:47:16,524
Sorrow for sorrow.

1944
01:47:16,999 --> 01:47:18,726
Tears for tears.

1945
01:47:19,417 --> 01:47:21,745
Whatever I suffered all my life..

1946
01:47:22,205 --> 01:47:24,209
You too will have
to suffer the same.

1947
01:47:25,123 --> 01:47:26,220
Remember.

1948
01:47:27,009 --> 01:47:28,870
A chance to avenge cruelty..

1949
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,074
Every person gets
it once in his life.

1950
01:47:32,588 --> 01:47:34,600
I don't want to argue.

1951
01:47:35,544 --> 01:47:37,969
You know that I own this region.

1952
01:47:39,065 --> 01:47:41,686
If I wish,
I can destroy this settlement.

1953
01:47:43,077 --> 01:47:46,252
But I had to come to
you for Anjana's betterment.

1954
01:47:48,158 --> 01:47:50,549
If you claim to be her mother..

1955
01:47:51,779 --> 01:47:54,273
And you really have a
mother's affection towards her.

1956
01:47:56,124 --> 01:47:59,423
Anjana should not
know this secret, Kamla.

1957
01:48:08,684 --> 01:48:09,889
Sir, something strange happened.

1958
01:48:09,913 --> 01:48:10,332
What happened?

1959
01:48:10,372 --> 01:48:11,797
Sir, I went to Bihari's
room with food for him,

1960
01:48:11,821 --> 01:48:13,644
everything in the room was in a mess.

1961
01:48:13,818 --> 01:48:14,600
Then?

1962
01:48:14,804 --> 01:48:17,605
Bihari's not there, sir.
This letter was lying on the table.

1963
01:48:30,361 --> 01:48:31,409
Very good.

1964
01:48:33,605 --> 01:48:35,725
Take this letter and keep
it back from where found it.

1965
01:48:35,807 --> 01:48:37,208
Nobody should get to know of this.

1966
01:48:37,409 --> 01:48:38,409
Right, sir.

1967
01:48:44,797 --> 01:48:45,878
You're my mother?

1968
01:48:48,585 --> 01:48:49,585
Mother!

1969
01:48:52,603 --> 01:48:53,603
Open the door.

1970
01:48:53,684 --> 01:48:54,890
Open the door.

1971
01:48:56,648 --> 01:48:58,322
Tell me who my mother is.

1972
01:48:58,896 --> 01:48:59,896
Tell me, mother.

1973
01:49:00,265 --> 01:49:01,006
Tell me.

1974
01:49:01,236 --> 01:49:02,660
Are you my mother?

1975
01:49:02,954 --> 01:49:03,954
I don't know.

1976
01:49:04,183 --> 01:49:05,271
Go away.

1977
01:49:05,778 --> 01:49:07,429
Your mother's not here.

1978
01:49:08,138 --> 01:49:10,494
How can a gypsy woman be your mother?

1979
01:49:11,276 --> 01:49:12,888
Your family on the one side..

1980
01:49:13,227 --> 01:49:14,227
And we on the other.

1981
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,607
Go away.

1982
01:49:15,719 --> 01:49:16,860
Go away.

1983
01:49:16,988 --> 01:49:19,190
I came to you with a lot of hopes.

1984
01:49:20,359 --> 01:49:22,116
Don't disappoint me, mother.

1985
01:49:37,928 --> 01:49:39,138
Get down fast.

1986
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:41,297
Let me go. Move aside.

1987
01:49:49,996 --> 01:49:51,193
What have I done?

1988
01:49:51,338 --> 01:49:53,332
Why am I being humiliated?

1989
01:49:55,795 --> 01:49:57,555
I am being humiliated.

1990
01:49:58,429 --> 01:49:59,728
Because of you.

1991
01:50:00,185 --> 01:50:02,140
May be that's why
you've built a wall of..

1992
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:04,319
Your false pride between
your wife and daughter.

1993
01:50:04,734 --> 01:50:07,002
Anju, you're making false
allegations against me.

1994
01:50:08,624 --> 01:50:09,642
Believe me.

1995
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:12,741
I am not your enemy.

1996
01:50:14,053 --> 01:50:15,053
Your mother..

1997
01:50:16,651 --> 01:50:18,239
Is no more.

1998
01:50:19,096 --> 01:50:20,151
How can you meet her?

1999
01:50:20,293 --> 01:50:22,758
I didn't find her today
but some day I definitely will.

2000
01:50:24,088 --> 01:50:26,550
Uncle Bihari never lies to me.

2001
01:50:27,242 --> 01:50:30,641
If you trust Bihari more than me..

2002
01:50:31,034 --> 01:50:33,001
Then it'll be proved right away..

2003
01:50:33,528 --> 01:50:35,730
That whatever he told you..

2004
01:50:35,945 --> 01:50:37,468
Was in a state of drunkenness.

2005
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:38,918
Come with me.

2006
01:50:56,895 --> 01:50:58,296
Uncle Bihari?

2007
01:51:01,404 --> 01:51:02,568
Uncle Bihari?

2008
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,137
I am fed up of this atmosphere.

2009
01:51:11,298 --> 01:51:12,554
I am tired of life.

2010
01:51:12,736 --> 01:51:13,736
I am going.

2011
01:51:13,962 --> 01:51:16,511
No one should bother
about where I am going.

2012
01:51:16,817 --> 01:51:18,399
I may live or die..

2013
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:19,959
No one should bother about me.

2014
01:51:20,443 --> 01:51:22,906
I am responsible
for my life and death.

2015
01:51:24,406 --> 01:51:26,106
Uncle Bihari?

2016
01:51:27,863 --> 01:51:29,244
He committed suicide.

2017
01:51:30,322 --> 01:51:32,864
- Sorry?
- He called you home, didn't you?

2018
01:51:33,738 --> 01:51:36,270
He feared the truth,
hence committed suicide.

2019
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:38,489
Impossible.

2020
01:51:39,145 --> 01:51:41,268
Why did he have to commit suicide?

2021
01:51:41,781 --> 01:51:43,271
Why did he do this? What for?

2022
01:51:43,311 --> 01:51:46,485
Because he lied to you.

2023
01:51:47,136 --> 01:51:49,226
Now you know the truth.

2024
01:51:58,488 --> 01:52:01,319
Mother? Anju came here last night?

2025
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:02,848
Yes.

2026
01:52:03,026 --> 01:52:06,086
I heard that Dwarkanath came here with
his men and took her away forcefully.

2027
01:52:06,577 --> 01:52:08,459
- Yes.
- You didn't try to stop him?

2028
01:52:09,085 --> 01:52:11,234
Son, what right do I
have on a stranger's daughter?

2029
01:52:11,319 --> 01:52:12,386
Mother, what are you saying?

2030
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:14,086
It's you who said that
you want to meet her.

2031
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:16,395
- Now that she came here.
- That was a mistake.

2032
01:52:17,653 --> 01:52:18,896
I realised my mistake.

2033
01:52:19,993 --> 01:52:20,993
Mother?

2034
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:23,388
What's wrong with you?

2035
01:52:23,709 --> 01:52:25,349
I am sure you're hiding
something from me.

2036
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,412
We've got nothing to do with them.

2037
01:52:29,625 --> 01:52:30,739
They are rich.

2038
01:52:31,058 --> 01:52:32,139
We're poor.

2039
01:52:32,867 --> 01:52:35,511
Rich and poor can
never come together.

2040
01:52:36,226 --> 01:52:39,051
Wealth, property, respect and status.

2041
01:52:39,961 --> 01:52:41,702
What is it they don't have?

2042
01:52:42,743 --> 01:52:45,301
We're illiterate, rural, tribal.

2043
01:52:46,376 --> 01:52:48,664
This difference between
the land and sky..

2044
01:52:49,745 --> 01:52:52,260
Anjana will never
be able to tolerate it.

2045
01:52:54,024 --> 01:52:55,237
Her life..

2046
01:52:56,322 --> 01:52:57,663
Her desires..

2047
01:52:58,249 --> 01:53:00,092
Will be ruined.

2048
01:53:00,174 --> 01:53:01,506
But I won't let my life..

2049
01:53:01,704 --> 01:53:03,649
And my desires be ruined.

2050
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:05,211
Jhumroo!

2051
01:53:05,251 --> 01:53:06,905
Jhumroo, where are you going?

2052
01:53:07,735 --> 01:53:08,829
Jhumroo.

2053
01:53:12,923 --> 01:53:14,891
- You can't go inside.
- Stop.

2054
01:53:17,363 --> 01:53:18,744
- You?
- Yes.

2055
01:53:18,929 --> 01:53:19,934
Why have you come here?

2056
01:53:20,151 --> 01:53:21,783
You know what I am here for.

2057
01:53:21,963 --> 01:53:24,050
Why this anger?

2058
01:53:25,153 --> 01:53:26,676
You want to meet Anjana, don't you?

2059
01:53:26,963 --> 01:53:27,963
Yes.

2060
01:53:29,046 --> 01:53:30,895
Before you meet Anjana..

2061
01:53:31,449 --> 01:53:33,011
I need to talk to you.

2062
01:53:33,624 --> 01:53:34,419
Me?

2063
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:35,630
Yes.

2064
01:53:36,001 --> 01:53:38,430
Jhumroo, I am thinking
of getting Anjana married.

2065
01:53:39,096 --> 01:53:39,821
Marriage?

2066
01:53:39,894 --> 01:53:40,894
To whom?

2067
01:53:41,564 --> 01:53:42,883
She loves you.

2068
01:53:43,684 --> 01:53:44,900
I love her too.

2069
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:47,596
So you love each other.

2070
01:53:48,130 --> 01:53:49,765
We can give our lives for each other.

2071
01:53:51,234 --> 01:53:53,123
I have no objections
for this marriage.

2072
01:53:54,307 --> 01:53:56,581
We should also ask Anjana about this.

2073
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,427
You wait here. I'll send her.

2074
01:54:25,946 --> 01:54:26,946
Anjana.

2075
01:54:28,053 --> 01:54:29,053
Jhumroo is here.

2076
01:54:30,571 --> 01:54:31,773
Father!

2077
01:54:31,932 --> 01:54:33,875
I want the marriage decision..

2078
01:54:34,002 --> 01:54:35,035
To happen today.

2079
01:54:35,407 --> 01:54:36,477
Decision of marriage?

2080
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,672
Yes.

2081
01:54:37,956 --> 01:54:40,419
You'll have to reject this proposal.

2082
01:54:40,601 --> 01:54:41,601
Reject?

2083
01:54:47,789 --> 01:54:49,392
I cannot do this.

2084
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:50,920
Never.

2085
01:54:51,104 --> 01:54:54,793
- Even if that costs me my life.
- Right now, Jhumroo's life is at stake.

2086
01:54:55,276 --> 01:54:58,400
You know that I do
what I intend to do.

2087
01:54:59,339 --> 01:55:00,829
Anjana, remember one thing.

2088
01:55:01,674 --> 01:55:04,738
Jhumroo's life depends
on your decision.

2089
01:55:05,655 --> 01:55:06,655
No.

2090
01:55:07,264 --> 01:55:08,603
This can't happen.

2091
01:55:08,643 --> 01:55:10,312
This can't happen.

2092
01:55:12,094 --> 01:55:13,094
Jhumroo.

2093
01:55:13,844 --> 01:55:14,844
Anjana!

2094
01:55:19,339 --> 01:55:20,339
Anju.

2095
01:55:20,711 --> 01:55:22,831
Jhumroo, I can't live without you.

2096
01:55:22,992 --> 01:55:24,083
Take me out of here.

2097
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,051
Anju, there's no need
to go away like this.

2098
01:55:26,091 --> 01:55:28,411
I'll take you home after
a grand wedding in full grandeur.

2099
01:55:28,474 --> 01:55:29,971
- After the marriage.
- Jhumroo, you.

2100
01:55:33,561 --> 01:55:34,561
You don't know.

2101
01:55:34,716 --> 01:55:35,544
What should I know?

2102
01:55:35,737 --> 01:55:36,737
Everything is fine.

2103
01:55:36,794 --> 01:55:38,313
Your father has agreed.

2104
01:55:38,484 --> 01:55:41,369
He promised me that
he'll get us married.

2105
01:55:43,259 --> 01:55:44,266
But.

2106
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:47,906
But.

2107
01:55:48,116 --> 01:55:49,121
But, what?

2108
01:55:50,117 --> 01:55:51,117
Anju, what happened?

2109
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:52,761
Why did you become silent?

2110
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:55,330
Nothing.

2111
01:55:57,230 --> 01:55:59,854
The world doesn't work on wishes.

2112
01:56:00,785 --> 01:56:02,505
There's a big difference
between you and me.

2113
01:56:04,815 --> 01:56:05,815
I am rich.

2114
01:56:06,674 --> 01:56:07,674
You're poor.

2115
01:56:08,578 --> 01:56:10,365
What are you talking all of a sudden?

2116
01:56:11,138 --> 01:56:13,496
How has love got to
do with wealth and poverty?

2117
01:56:16,299 --> 01:56:17,776
By forgetting the reality..

2118
01:56:17,973 --> 01:56:19,932
I will not become
blind in fake love.

2119
01:56:20,574 --> 01:56:22,142
Do you still doubt my love?

2120
01:56:22,865 --> 01:56:24,241
Have you changed your mind?

2121
01:56:25,754 --> 01:56:26,754
Answer me, Anju.

2122
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:28,700
Don't you love me?

2123
01:56:29,113 --> 01:56:30,553
Don't you want to get married to me?

2124
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,572
The question of marriage
doesn't arise between unequals.

2125
01:56:38,344 --> 01:56:40,936
So like rich people, you also
pretended to be in love with me.

2126
01:56:41,585 --> 01:56:42,772
You made fun of my love.

2127
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:44,280
You cheated me.

2128
01:56:44,707 --> 01:56:45,791
Those promises were false.

2129
01:56:46,126 --> 01:56:47,366
Those meetings, those promises.

2130
01:56:47,621 --> 01:56:48,621
Why did you do this?

2131
01:56:48,795 --> 01:56:49,828
Why did you call me here?

2132
01:56:59,756 --> 01:57:01,352
To give you the good news.

2133
01:57:02,525 --> 01:57:03,809
I am getting married.

2134
01:57:04,046 --> 01:57:06,003
I didn't know that
there's fraud and deceit ..

2135
01:57:06,043 --> 01:57:08,171
Hiding behind your beauty and innocence.

2136
01:57:21,374 --> 01:57:23,024
Now you leave.

2137
01:57:23,642 --> 01:57:25,326
Do come for the wedding.

2138
01:57:25,598 --> 01:57:27,159
Don't bother about the gift.

2139
01:57:27,265 --> 01:57:28,265
Congratulations.

2140
01:57:28,736 --> 01:57:30,735
I was wrong, I believed you.

2141
01:57:31,321 --> 01:57:32,668
I shouldn't known it earlier.

2142
01:57:33,029 --> 01:57:35,275
Poor and rich are different
not only by wealth and stature..

2143
01:57:35,299 --> 01:57:36,454
But also hearts.

2144
01:57:40,132 --> 01:57:42,200
Jhumroo, I wish you knew.

2145
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:45,448
I wish I could tell you.

2146
01:58:13,765 --> 01:58:19,090
"I don't have a companion."

2147
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:23,738
"I don't have any support."

2148
01:58:25,276 --> 01:58:30,512
"I don't belong to anyone."

2149
01:58:30,691 --> 01:58:36,231
"No one belongs to me."

2150
01:58:36,935 --> 01:58:42,229
"I don't have a companion."

2151
01:58:42,374 --> 01:58:47,672
"I don't have any support."

2152
01:58:57,241 --> 01:59:02,535
"It's a lonely evening."

2153
01:59:02,774 --> 01:59:09,005
"How will I find my destination?"

2154
01:59:09,045 --> 01:59:13,991
"It's a lonely evening."

2155
01:59:14,468 --> 01:59:20,043
"How will I find my destination?"

2156
01:59:20,694 --> 01:59:26,699
"He who used to show me my way."

2157
01:59:26,797 --> 01:59:31,049
"That star isn't there."

2158
01:59:32,597 --> 01:59:37,897
"I don't have a companion."

2159
01:59:38,054 --> 01:59:43,088
"I don't have any support."

2160
01:59:58,843 --> 02:00:03,783
"Scenery, don't laugh."

2161
02:00:04,279 --> 02:00:07,546
"We won't meet again."

2162
02:00:08,206 --> 02:00:13,129
"I don't have any support."

2163
02:00:21,019 --> 02:00:24,879
"Where do I go?"

2164
02:00:25,287 --> 02:00:30,717
"I am walking aimlessly."

2165
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:37,135
"He who would call me again."

2166
02:00:37,256 --> 02:00:41,465
"That signal is not there."

2167
02:00:43,067 --> 02:00:48,203
"I don't have a companion."

2168
02:00:48,562 --> 02:00:53,397
"I don't have any support."

2169
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:59,623
"I don't belong to anyone."

2170
02:00:59,879 --> 02:01:05,064
"No one belongs to me."

2171
02:01:34,333 --> 02:01:35,345
Miss. Anjana.

2172
02:01:41,459 --> 02:01:42,344
Anjana.

2173
02:01:42,447 --> 02:01:43,486
How beautiful?

2174
02:01:47,185 --> 02:01:48,828
You look so pretty.

2175
02:01:51,742 --> 02:01:52,742
Anjana.

2176
02:01:53,077 --> 02:01:56,096
I know what you're going through.

2177
02:01:56,592 --> 02:01:57,592
Don't worry.

2178
02:01:57,960 --> 02:01:59,260
Father had said.

2179
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:03,143
Never become a barrier
between true love.

2180
02:02:03,465 --> 02:02:04,465
If possible..

2181
02:02:04,831 --> 02:02:07,605
Bring down that barrier
and unite two lovers.

2182
02:02:08,473 --> 02:02:10,240
But because of father's fear..

2183
02:02:11,311 --> 02:02:13,283
I built this barrier.

2184
02:02:15,049 --> 02:02:17,915
This misunderstanding will
never go away from Jhumroo's mind.

2185
02:02:22,928 --> 02:02:24,705
I'll clear this misunderstanding.

2186
02:02:26,009 --> 02:02:27,238
No use.

2187
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,617
I insulted him.

2188
02:02:30,452 --> 02:02:31,850
I rejected his love.

2189
02:02:32,749 --> 02:02:34,990
He will never believe this truth.

2190
02:02:35,444 --> 02:02:37,285
I deserve his hatred.

2191
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:53,290
Jhumroo.

2192
02:02:53,583 --> 02:02:54,600
Jhumroo.

2193
02:02:54,855 --> 02:02:55,979
Manager?

2194
02:02:56,068 --> 02:02:57,515
What's left to be destroyed?

2195
02:02:57,631 --> 02:02:58,646
What do you want to burn?

2196
02:02:59,141 --> 02:02:59,654
Chamki?

2197
02:02:59,928 --> 02:03:01,565
I don't understand
what you're saying.

2198
02:03:01,721 --> 02:03:03,009
Can you tell me where Jhumroo is?

2199
02:03:03,033 --> 02:03:04,497
I have to meet him. It's urgent.

2200
02:03:04,624 --> 02:03:05,987
She didn't spare anything.

2201
02:03:06,059 --> 02:03:08,207
Why has that city girl sent you?

2202
02:03:08,247 --> 02:03:09,226
Chamki.

2203
02:03:09,266 --> 02:03:11,550
Jhumroo is not sitting
here to suffer your atrocities.

2204
02:03:11,791 --> 02:03:13,143
He went to climb the mountain.

2205
02:03:13,968 --> 02:03:15,972
Aunt was crying.
She kept telling him.

2206
02:03:16,428 --> 02:03:19,197
Whoever goes there never comes back.

2207
02:03:19,435 --> 02:03:21,793
Your city girl is the cause of this.

2208
02:03:22,013 --> 02:03:24,317
I am telling you.
If anything happens to my Jhumroo..

2209
02:03:24,563 --> 02:03:25,843
I am not going to keep quiet.

2210
02:03:25,903 --> 02:03:27,310
My name is not Chamki.

2211
02:03:28,804 --> 02:03:31,084
Chamki, why are you
talking like a lunatic?

2212
02:03:31,605 --> 02:03:32,605
Try to understand.

2213
02:03:33,027 --> 02:03:35,153
Neither Jhumroo nor
Anjana are at fault.

2214
02:03:35,644 --> 02:03:36,797
We are at fault.

2215
02:03:37,028 --> 02:03:38,901
We're coming in between both of them.

2216
02:03:39,557 --> 02:03:40,886
I love Anjana.

2217
02:03:41,356 --> 02:03:42,601
You love Jhumroo.

2218
02:03:43,265 --> 02:03:44,970
And they love each other.

2219
02:03:45,661 --> 02:03:46,893
Chamki, it's our duty..

2220
02:03:47,153 --> 02:03:49,322
To unite them and leave their path.

2221
02:03:49,584 --> 02:03:50,584
You leave.

2222
02:03:50,782 --> 02:03:52,627
I will not give up.

2223
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:54,389
I am a woman.

2224
02:03:54,608 --> 02:03:57,065
If a woman can ruin someone's life..

2225
02:03:57,281 --> 02:03:58,392
She can also make it.

2226
02:03:59,256 --> 02:04:00,787
Father had said. Son.

2227
02:04:01,589 --> 02:04:02,926
A real lover..

2228
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:05,430
Doesn't take revenge,
but gives sacrifice.

2229
02:04:05,947 --> 02:04:06,668
Chamki.

2230
02:04:06,806 --> 02:04:07,806
We don't have much time.

2231
02:04:08,008 --> 02:04:09,561
Jhumroo's life is in danger.

2232
02:04:09,806 --> 02:04:10,926
If anything happens to him..

2233
02:04:11,181 --> 02:04:12,713
You will be responsible.

2234
02:04:12,816 --> 02:04:13,538
No.

2235
02:04:13,692 --> 02:04:15,146
That can't happen.

2236
02:04:15,795 --> 02:04:18,046
I can give my life for Jhumroo.

2237
02:04:18,153 --> 02:04:19,153
Chamki.

2238
02:04:19,454 --> 02:04:20,653
I expected this from you.

2239
02:04:20,941 --> 02:04:21,941
Come with me.

2240
02:04:22,875 --> 02:04:26,473
Jhumroo!

2241
02:04:27,277 --> 02:04:29,392
Jhumroo!

2242
02:04:30,801 --> 02:04:33,282
Jhumroo!

2243
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:37,961
Jhumroo!

2244
02:04:38,292 --> 02:04:40,374
Jhumroo!

2245
02:04:45,215 --> 02:04:46,364
Jhumroo!

2246
02:04:46,687 --> 02:04:47,699
Jhumroo.

2247
02:04:47,962 --> 02:04:49,641
Jhumroo, you have to come back.

2248
02:04:49,776 --> 02:04:50,461
I won't go.

2249
02:04:50,556 --> 02:04:51,240
Why have you come here?

2250
02:04:51,499 --> 02:04:53,009
To clear your misunderstanding.

2251
02:04:53,195 --> 02:04:55,041
Anjana really loves you.

2252
02:04:55,833 --> 02:04:58,210
The manger told me everything.

2253
02:04:58,387 --> 02:05:00,760
She did everything to save your life.

2254
02:05:01,136 --> 02:05:02,136
It's a lie.

2255
02:05:02,182 --> 02:05:04,702
Jhumroo, I am telling the truth.
You'll come to know everything.

2256
02:05:04,829 --> 02:05:05,932
Come for now.

2257
02:05:06,629 --> 02:05:08,485
If not for me,
come for Anjana's sake.

2258
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:09,709
Jhumroo!

2259
02:05:10,008 --> 02:05:11,008
Jhumroo!

2260
02:05:16,485 --> 02:05:17,485
Let's go.

2261
02:05:18,098 --> 02:05:19,098
Let's go.

2262
02:05:28,914 --> 02:05:31,952
No person from the
settlement should come up.

2263
02:05:33,315 --> 02:05:34,412
As you wish, sir.

2264
02:06:02,658 --> 02:06:04,084
Huh?

2265
02:06:05,566 --> 02:06:06,188
So?

2266
02:06:06,534 --> 02:06:07,848
Aren't you ashamed?

2267
02:06:09,781 --> 02:06:10,781
Go.

2268
02:06:14,322 --> 02:06:16,149
Son of a bear.

2269
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,427
Don't you have a mother
and sister in your house?

2270
02:06:18,467 --> 02:06:20,476
You're ogling at my daughters.

2271
02:06:20,516 --> 02:06:21,423
No, mother.

2272
02:06:21,516 --> 02:06:25,174
Sir has ordered not
to let strangers inside.

2273
02:06:25,214 --> 02:06:27,698
Son, I am not a stranger.

2274
02:06:27,797 --> 02:06:31,041
We've come from Kathmandu, on the
occasion of the daughter's wedding..

2275
02:06:31,081 --> 02:06:34,244
To sing,
dance and give our blessings.

2276
02:06:34,284 --> 02:06:35,284
Alright, mother.

2277
02:06:35,643 --> 02:06:36,898
Didn't recognise me?

2278
02:06:37,057 --> 02:06:39,287
The big boss from Kathmandu.

2279
02:06:39,379 --> 02:06:41,672
What's his name? I forgot.

2280
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:42,471
Rana sir?

2281
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:44,217
Yes, Rana sir.

2282
02:06:44,321 --> 02:06:49,531
He sent me to sing and
dance in your daughter's wedding.

2283
02:06:50,352 --> 02:06:51,103
You'll dance?

2284
02:06:51,143 --> 02:06:52,202
Son.

2285
02:06:52,316 --> 02:06:53,894
It's not my time.

2286
02:06:53,968 --> 02:06:57,946
When I used to dance in my youth..

2287
02:06:58,050 --> 02:07:00,904
- The audience used to become spell bound.
- Alright.

2288
02:07:01,511 --> 02:07:02,214
Listen.

2289
02:07:02,478 --> 02:07:03,812
Make arrangements for their dance.

2290
02:07:03,836 --> 02:07:06,804
But, son.
Let me first bless your daughter.

2291
02:07:07,812 --> 02:07:09,154
- Where's your daughter?
- She.

2292
02:07:13,749 --> 02:07:14,749
Get aside.

2293
02:07:14,816 --> 02:07:16,170
Where's my daughter?

2294
02:07:16,282 --> 02:07:17,282
Here she is.

2295
02:07:17,451 --> 02:07:21,089
Today my daughter will
go to her husband's house.

2296
02:07:21,129 --> 02:07:22,167
May God..

2297
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:23,280
Make you live..

2298
02:07:23,330 --> 02:07:24,349
100 years.

2299
02:07:24,389 --> 02:07:26,975
May your husband live till 50.

2300
02:07:27,289 --> 02:07:28,479
What nonsense, old man?

2301
02:07:28,599 --> 02:07:31,428
So you are that useless fellow?

2302
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,373
You'll marry my daughter?

2303
02:07:33,564 --> 02:07:34,471
Naughty boy.

2304
02:07:34,537 --> 02:07:35,755
Give me a hug.

2305
02:07:39,833 --> 02:07:40,833
You?

2306
02:07:42,122 --> 02:07:43,126
Glory to the mother.

2307
02:07:43,311 --> 02:07:45,168
Father had said. Son.

2308
02:07:45,208 --> 02:07:47,558
If you want to take
an old woman's blessings..

2309
02:07:47,624 --> 02:07:50,668
- Fall at her feet.
- Go ahead.

2310
02:07:50,708 --> 02:07:52,518
God bless, my son.
God bless, my daughter.

2311
02:07:52,579 --> 02:07:53,579
God bless, my son.

2312
02:07:53,708 --> 02:07:56,009
Child, I'll go check on my kids.

2313
02:07:56,095 --> 02:07:58,434
I'll see if they are ready or not.

2314
02:07:58,474 --> 02:07:59,474
Mother.

2315
02:08:10,498 --> 02:08:14,033
"Gauri, listen to me."

2316
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:24,591
"Someone has sneeked
into your locality."

2317
02:08:45,434 --> 02:08:48,620
"Timbak tu."

2318
02:08:48,691 --> 02:08:51,511
"Kathmandu."

2319
02:08:51,551 --> 02:08:54,810
"I am a magnet."

2320
02:08:54,850 --> 02:08:57,729
"How can I be safe?"

2321
02:08:57,769 --> 02:09:00,753
"Timbak tu."

2322
02:09:00,896 --> 02:09:03,777
"Kathmandu."

2323
02:09:03,817 --> 02:09:07,021
"I am a magnet."

2324
02:09:07,061 --> 02:09:09,811
"How can I be safe?"

2325
02:09:09,851 --> 02:09:11,921
"Just."

2326
02:09:40,261 --> 02:09:44,548
"How can walls stop a bumblebee?"

2327
02:09:46,251 --> 02:09:50,507
"Thorns can use their swords."

2328
02:09:52,219 --> 02:09:56,494
"How can walls stop a bumblebee?"

2329
02:09:56,663 --> 02:10:00,536
"How can walls stop a bumblebee?"

2330
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:03,724
"I am a magnet."

2331
02:10:03,808 --> 02:10:06,614
"How can I be safe?"

2332
02:10:06,654 --> 02:10:09,351
"Just."

2333
02:10:29,870 --> 02:10:34,357
"The fire fly is here to meet you."

2334
02:10:34,397 --> 02:10:35,844
"Fire fly."

2335
02:10:35,884 --> 02:10:40,047
"My flame,
you haven't recognised me."

2336
02:10:40,087 --> 02:10:41,672
"Haven't recognised."

2337
02:10:41,712 --> 02:10:45,962
"The fire fly is here to meet you."

2338
02:10:46,213 --> 02:10:50,063
"My flame,
you haven't recognised me."

2339
02:10:51,202 --> 02:10:54,290
"I am the crazy fellow. Don't blink."

2340
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:58,440
"Take the veil off your eyes."

2341
02:10:58,649 --> 02:11:03,090
"Just."

2342
02:11:03,130 --> 02:11:04,922
"Timbak tu."

2343
02:11:04,989 --> 02:11:07,683
"Kathmandu."

2344
02:11:07,802 --> 02:11:12,161
"I am a magnet."

2345
02:11:12,201 --> 02:11:14,047
"Magnet."

2346
02:11:14,126 --> 02:11:16,847
"How can I be safe?"

2347
02:11:16,923 --> 02:11:18,835
"Just."

2348
02:11:46,981 --> 02:11:51,076
"You have to come with me."

2349
02:11:51,116 --> 02:11:52,903
"Come with me."

2350
02:11:52,943 --> 02:11:56,819
"The moon needs to meet the clouds."

2351
02:11:56,859 --> 02:11:58,745
"Meet."

2352
02:11:58,785 --> 02:12:02,526
"You have to come with me."

2353
02:12:02,761 --> 02:12:06,613
"The moon needs to meet the clouds."

2354
02:12:07,721 --> 02:12:10,719
"If anyone tries to stop you,
leave your hair."

2355
02:12:10,798 --> 02:12:12,365
"Sneek out."

2356
02:12:12,405 --> 02:12:14,833
"Switch off the lights, go."

2357
02:12:15,057 --> 02:12:18,221
"Timbak tu."

2358
02:12:18,261 --> 02:12:21,045
"Kathmandu."

2359
02:12:21,085 --> 02:12:24,267
"I am a magnet."

2360
02:12:24,352 --> 02:12:26,738
"How can I be safe?"

2361
02:12:27,049 --> 02:12:29,881
"Timbak tu."

2362
02:12:29,921 --> 02:12:32,473
"Kathmandu."

2363
02:12:32,513 --> 02:12:35,123
"I am a magnet."

2364
02:12:35,163 --> 02:12:37,652
"How can I be safe?"

2365
02:12:37,692 --> 02:12:39,047
"Just."

2366
02:13:11,674 --> 02:13:13,356
I am saved.

2367
02:13:13,445 --> 02:13:14,445
Uh!

2368
02:13:14,555 --> 02:13:16,807
I am afraid,
they'll definitely come here.

2369
02:13:17,207 --> 02:13:18,207
This marriage.

2370
02:13:18,736 --> 02:13:21,296
They won't let it happen
so easily, brother.

2371
02:13:21,336 --> 02:13:23,625
They can't harm us.

2372
02:13:23,981 --> 02:13:25,722
The entire tribe
is ready to fight them.

2373
02:13:25,762 --> 02:13:27,214
Priest, you perform the wedding.

2374
02:13:27,325 --> 02:13:28,351
I'll stay on guard.

2375
02:13:31,636 --> 02:13:33,234
You guard the bridge with the men.

2376
02:13:33,427 --> 02:13:34,284
I'll manage here.

2377
02:13:34,378 --> 02:13:35,254
You manage there.

2378
02:13:35,294 --> 02:13:36,688
Right. Let's go.

2379
02:13:37,069 --> 02:13:39,814
- Hurry up.
- Both of you take oath of God..

2380
02:13:39,854 --> 02:13:42,205
That you'll be with
each other all your lives.

2381
02:13:42,326 --> 02:13:44,654
Child, garland him.

2382
02:13:44,745 --> 02:13:45,950
Here you go, my child.

2383
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:47,400
Chant.

2384
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:56,820
- No, my child.
- Mother, let me go. - Jhumroo.

2385
02:13:56,885 --> 02:13:58,145
This marriage will take place.

2386
02:13:58,225 --> 02:13:59,390
Garland him.

2387
02:14:02,616 --> 02:14:05,264
Who dared to enter the lion's den?

2388
02:14:05,327 --> 02:14:07,616
- Hurry up.
- Chant.

2389
02:14:09,190 --> 02:14:11,734
Who dares to challenge me?

2390
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:14,830
Me.

2391
02:14:15,394 --> 02:14:16,478
A woman.

2392
02:14:16,942 --> 02:14:17,953
A mother.

2393
02:14:19,101 --> 02:14:20,740
Unaccepted, and nervous.

2394
02:14:21,748 --> 02:14:24,826
I am standing in front
of you to save my husband.

2395
02:14:25,597 --> 02:14:27,803
You know, at time..

2396
02:14:27,862 --> 02:14:30,528
Mother can become powerful
to save his son.

2397
02:14:30,777 --> 02:14:32,857
I'll also free you.

2398
02:14:33,505 --> 02:14:35,823
If Anjana doesn't come
here before I finish counting 5..

2399
02:14:36,998 --> 02:14:39,015
I'll burn this settlement
and turn it to ashes.

2400
02:14:39,834 --> 02:14:41,587
These are not wedding rituals..

2401
02:14:42,129 --> 02:14:44,432
But your funeral rituals.

2402
02:14:46,793 --> 02:14:48,734
Commander, no use fighting.

2403
02:14:48,774 --> 02:14:50,546
I'll understand everything.

2404
02:14:51,398 --> 02:14:52,415
Hey!

2405
02:14:52,455 --> 02:14:54,502
It's not good to be adamant.

2406
02:14:54,778 --> 02:14:58,120
You had done something similar
in the past in your pride of wealth.

2407
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:01,290
You promised marriage
to Kamli and cheated her.

2408
02:15:01,486 --> 02:15:03,984
You abducted her innocent child.

2409
02:15:04,054 --> 02:15:06,060
I was the commander
of this tribe at that time.

2410
02:15:06,433 --> 02:15:10,457
I abducted a kid from
your house to take a revenge.

2411
02:15:10,497 --> 02:15:12,198
I put it in her lonely lap.

2412
02:15:12,634 --> 02:15:15,245
The child's smile wiped her tears.

2413
02:15:15,487 --> 02:15:17,067
It was not Anjana.

2414
02:15:17,888 --> 02:15:19,171
He was Jhumroo.

2415
02:15:20,093 --> 02:15:22,530
Your he is Bihari's son.

2416
02:15:22,650 --> 02:15:23,958
Which you have ruined.

2417
02:15:25,517 --> 02:15:26,470
Stop!

2418
02:15:26,529 --> 02:15:27,578
Father!

2419
02:15:29,329 --> 02:15:31,065
- What happened?
- He shot the commander.

2420
02:15:31,548 --> 02:15:32,548
Commander.

2421
02:15:33,551 --> 02:15:35,439
Stop. The rituals are not over yet.

2422
02:15:35,563 --> 02:15:36,648
We can perform the rituals later.

2423
02:15:36,672 --> 02:15:38,892
Dwarka, how many bullets do you have?

2424
02:15:38,932 --> 02:15:39,932
You?

2425
02:15:40,772 --> 02:15:42,152
You're still alive?

2426
02:15:42,388 --> 02:15:43,388
Yes.

2427
02:15:44,033 --> 02:15:47,288
This old commander must've
saved me to see this day.

2428
02:15:48,217 --> 02:15:50,753
How would I have
got back my lost wealth?

2429
02:15:51,149 --> 02:15:53,971
How would I come to
know that Jhumroo is my son?

2430
02:15:54,241 --> 02:15:56,277
Last wish of my life.

2431
02:15:56,675 --> 02:15:58,352
My biggest wish.

2432
02:15:58,660 --> 02:16:00,337
I found my son.

2433
02:16:04,394 --> 02:16:05,134
Father.

2434
02:16:05,281 --> 02:16:06,281
My son.

2435
02:16:07,098 --> 02:16:08,222
My son.

2436
02:16:08,311 --> 02:16:09,417
My son.

2437
02:16:12,772 --> 02:16:13,772
Dwarka.

2438
02:16:14,293 --> 02:16:15,664
Today, for his happiness..

2439
02:16:15,755 --> 02:16:18,483
Let alone your gun,
I can even face a mortar launcher.

2440
02:16:19,884 --> 02:16:20,884
Kalu.

2441
02:16:25,004 --> 02:16:26,351
Why are you wasting your bullets?

2442
02:16:26,809 --> 02:16:28,885
Why do you want to
take innocent lives?

2443
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:31,095
You have a problem with me.

2444
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:33,237
If your gun is thirsty for blood..

2445
02:16:33,334 --> 02:16:34,557
Shoot me.

2446
02:16:34,623 --> 02:16:35,222
Son.

2447
02:16:35,333 --> 02:16:36,101
Let's see..

2448
02:16:36,272 --> 02:16:37,724
Whether you run out of bullets..

2449
02:16:37,816 --> 02:16:38,816
Or my courage.

2450
02:16:41,017 --> 02:16:42,970
Shoot. Shoot.

2451
02:16:43,230 --> 02:16:44,751
Make me a widow.

2452
02:16:44,934 --> 02:16:46,463
So that the world will say..

2453
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:51,085
A proud father widowed
his daughter for his false pride.

2454
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:53,673
You've been misled by these people.

2455
02:16:54,498 --> 02:16:56,151
- Get aside, my child.
- Child?

2456
02:16:56,346 --> 02:16:58,026
Child, who? Whose child?

2457
02:16:58,235 --> 02:17:00,703
The father - daughter
relation ended the day..

2458
02:17:00,822 --> 02:17:03,828
I came to know that
you cheated my mother.

2459
02:17:03,915 --> 02:17:04,915
Enough!

2460
02:17:06,346 --> 02:17:07,583
Fire!

2461
02:17:07,786 --> 02:17:11,302
Kill each of them.
Put this settlement on fire.

2462
02:18:00,352 --> 02:18:02,232
Shoot.

2463
02:18:24,715 --> 02:18:25,715
No!

2464
02:18:27,699 --> 02:18:28,504
No!

2465
02:18:28,544 --> 02:18:29,582
No!

2466
02:18:30,059 --> 02:18:30,839
Move!

2467
02:18:30,946 --> 02:18:31,494
Move!

2468
02:18:31,619 --> 02:18:33,507
Dare anyone raise
his hand against him.

2469
02:18:33,782 --> 02:18:34,782
Master.

2470
02:18:34,869 --> 02:18:35,869
Master.

2471
02:18:38,036 --> 02:18:39,036
Dare.

2472
02:18:39,143 --> 02:18:42,677
Dare you try to raise your hand
against my master while I am alive.

2473
02:18:43,111 --> 02:18:45,065
Go away. Go away.

2474
02:18:46,330 --> 02:18:47,567
I always..

2475
02:18:48,714 --> 02:18:49,714
Gave you sufferings..

2476
02:18:50,731 --> 02:18:51,731
Sorrow..

2477
02:18:52,683 --> 02:18:54,094
And tears.

2478
02:18:54,675 --> 02:18:55,675
Now.

2479
02:18:57,780 --> 02:18:58,780
Now.

2480
02:19:01,357 --> 02:19:02,373
But, today.

2481
02:19:04,004 --> 02:19:06,525
I'll adorn your forehead.

2482
02:19:08,572 --> 02:19:10,547
Father! Get aside.

2483
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:14,991
- Father!
- Take him.

2484
02:19:15,031 --> 02:19:17,024
Come.

2485
02:19:19,415 --> 02:19:21,176
You people look very happy?

2486
02:19:21,459 --> 02:19:23,494
You're under my control today.

2487
02:19:23,861 --> 02:19:25,403
Do you know who I am?

2488
02:19:25,782 --> 02:19:27,372
The bride's father.

2489
02:19:27,554 --> 02:19:30,513
- If I want, I can.
- No, brother Bihari.

2490
02:19:31,989 --> 02:19:33,537
I thank God..

2491
02:19:34,111 --> 02:19:36,450
That we've come together
because of the kids.

2492
02:19:36,663 --> 02:19:38,731
- Aren't you happy?
- Why not?

2493
02:19:38,807 --> 02:19:39,888
Shake hands.

2494
02:19:40,564 --> 02:19:42,199
But where are the kids?

2495
02:19:42,469 --> 02:19:44,022
The kids? Tey must be here,

2496
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:52,160
"I am Jhumroo. I roam around like
ankle bells. I sing the song of love."

2497
02:19:52,923 --> 02:19:54,672
"I have eyes on the destination.

2498
02:19:54,712 --> 02:20:00,407
"I don't care about the world.
I bury the past under dust."

2499
02:20:06,221 --> 02:20:08,354
Father had said. Son.

2500
02:20:08,394 --> 02:20:09,978
All's well..

2501
02:20:10,018 --> 02:20:11,742
- That ends well.
- "I have eyes on the destination."

2502
02:20:11,766 --> 02:20:14,126
- All is well at in hell.
- " I don't care about the world."

2503
02:20:14,188 --> 02:20:15,203
Uncle.

2504
02:20:15,243 --> 02:20:17,276
Where are you going all alone?
Take me along.
