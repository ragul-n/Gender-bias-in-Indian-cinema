1
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,750
Continue doing good for all

2
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,079
You are a tourist.
This world is a tourist resort

3
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,260
There's a lot of movement
here day and night

4
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,700
One came and settled
here while the other departed

5
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,450
Continue doing good for all

6
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,500
This life will dawn
in a split second

7
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,560
Daylight claims
it will be dark soon

8
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,880
Look, the sun has set someplace

9
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,870
Continue doing good for all

10
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,230
Gentleman...

11
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,430
l've been serving this assembly
for fifteen years now.

12
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,239
Every month l make efforts
to improve your lives.

13
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,340
But it is regrettable that
years of hard work and lectures....

14
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,900
have born no results.

15
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,650
The Ramayan, Mahabharat,
Geeta, and the Vedas...

16
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,460
l completed them all,

17
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,200
l told you stories
of great men and saints...

18
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,870
but all those lectures
proved to be futile.

19
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,410
l can see today sins
are increasing day by day...

20
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,440
at the speed of a swelling
river during the rains.

21
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,080
Charity has completely ceased.

22
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,240
The lord of wealth
is reigning everywhere.

23
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,990
There's nobody to listen
to the hungry, poor and despondent.

24
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,350
Believe me,
this earth and sky cannot endure...

25
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,250
any more transgression.

26
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,969
Crimes against young girls
and widows will have an effect.

27
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,360
Have some shame, friends.
Go drown yourselves.

28
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
You call the earth your mother...

29
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,260
yet you sit in the mother's
lap and commit such heinous sins.

30
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,940
Watch out,
reform yourselves, worldly men.

31
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,320
The mother is going
to be mortified.

32
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:06,750
And the time is near when she
will engulf her shameless sons.

33
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,750
Be careful, be careful.
Perhaps some time still remains.

34
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,659
Child, did you go listen
to the scholar's discourse today?

35
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,280
Yes, Baba, l did. The scholar
seems to be very wise.

36
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,810
Child, the life of a city
is no place for the sage.

37
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,310
- Baba?
-That's right, child.

38
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,500
This township isn't worthy
of living in any longer.

39
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,680
Let's go make a home elsewhere.

40
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,840
Baba?

41
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,950
That's right, child. God made
the idiot to speak the truth today.

42
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,100
Mother is going to
engulf her sons tonight.

43
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,789
Let's go.

44
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,750
Blessed are you, god!

45
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,990
Why do you have expectations,
stupid man?

46
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,350
Your desires are shattered

47
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,580
Why do you have expectations,
stupid man?

48
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:31,230
The garden which was
once verdant is a wreck today

49
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,650
The gardener is crying

50
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,870
This is the inanity
of the world

51
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,310
Why do you have expectations,
stupid man?

52
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,020
Your desires are shattered

53
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,590
Why do you have expectations,
stupid man?

54
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,829
My sister. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush.

55
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,500
Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush.

56
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,660
Hush. Hush.

57
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,930
- Show me your ticket.
- Hush, hush, hush!

58
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,620
Show me your ticket!

59
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,000
Check their tickets first.
l'll show it to you in a minute.

60
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,400
- Show me your ticket.
- Hush, hush!

61
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,350
- Show me your ticket.
- You seem to be in a hurry.

62
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,819
Hold her.
Hold her and l'll show it to you.

63
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,610
Where has the ticket gone?

64
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,189
Give my sister to me!
Give my sister to me!

65
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,230
lnsane.

66
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,780
Send everyone to the asylum, but my sister will stay with me!

67
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,350
Look, look, you people
can't care for my sister!

68
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,130
She'll die without me.
Give my sister to me!

69
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,920
Give my sister to me!

70
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,160
God, who in this world
hasn't committed a crime?

71
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,180
Who hasn't and who won't?

72
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,000
But you are merciful, god.

73
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,840
Why do you reflect on our sins?
Reflect on your mercy.

74
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,670
lf man commits a crime,
your duty is not to punish him.

75
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,460
You should express
the truth to him...

76
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,200
so he is shamed
into giving up crime.

77
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,700
God...

78
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,030
Captain, can you tell me
how my sister is and where she is?

79
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,190
She must be crying. Who bathes her?

80
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,460
Does she get enough milk?
Tell me, captain.

81
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,180
You are such a giant and
you're crying for a tiny sister?

82
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,300
- l was apologizing to god.
-Why?

83
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,130
l had inappropriate thoughts
for god the day of the quake.

84
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,100
That's why he was upset with me.

85
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,740
Perhaps that's why he
took my sister away from me.

86
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,400
You fool, she's in the ashram
over here. She's doing well.

87
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,650
- How do they feed her?
- Three times a day.

88
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,510
Captain! Captain!

89
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,470
Captain, how's my sister doing?

90
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,120
She gets her feed on time,
doesn't she?

91
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,560
You ask me this
five hundred times every day.

92
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,310
How's my sister?
How's my sister?

93
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,030
What's wrong with your sister?
She's just fine.

94
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,510
Go do your work.

95
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,720
How's my sister, captain?

96
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,329
Your sister died!

97
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,520
My sister died? My sister died?

98
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,970
Why did you come here?

99
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,840
Why are you beating me, mother?
This is my sister.

100
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,140
l'm not here to steal. This
is my sister. l came to see her.

101
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,570
Speak!

102
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,890
- Why are you beating me?
- Tell why?

103
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,390
But sir, why did he
tell me my sister died?

104
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,450
Do you know breaking
out of prison is a crime?

105
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,120
You're being ridiculous, sir.

106
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,990
lf someone came and
told you your sister died...

107
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,510
wouldn't you do the same?

108
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,810
Okay, okay. Come with us.
The babies are disturbed.

109
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,689
Let's go. l came to see my sister.

110
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,770
By god's grace the
captain was wrong.

111
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,800
And l was going to return.
You didn't need to come after me.

112
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,490
l am not a thief or a
criminal who would break out.

113
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,330
Give the child to me.

114
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,600
But sir, tell them my sister
must be fed three times a day.

115
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,020
Yes, yes, she will.

116
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,410
And mother, all these
women here are untrustworthy.

117
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,770
They're no good.
They sleep all day long.

118
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,750
Mother, they sleep all the time.
l'm telling you.

119
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,260
l'm telling you they go to sleep.

120
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,010
lf a thief came instead of me...

121
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,130
lf a thief had come instead of me,
he'd take off with the child.

122
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,830
Amar is released from jail...

123
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,110
and after looking
about here and there...

124
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,550
we see him working
in an iron foundry.

125
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,840
Apply kohl for you, my princess

126
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,430
Your eyes are like roses,
my princess

127
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,730
Apply kohl on you, my princess

128
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,570
l am cherished by my brother

129
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,980
My dear sister is sweet

130
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,710
l embrace you

131
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,330
Your eyes are like roses,
my princess

132
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,540
Apply kohl on you, my princess

133
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,800
People are coming to see me

134
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,980
Because l'm looking so nice

135
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
l'll dress you like a bride

136
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,830
l'll dress you like a bride,
my princess

137
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,260
Your eyes are like roses,
my princess

138
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,290
Apply kohl on you, my princess

139
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,320
My Bina will get an education,
grow up.

140
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,800
Then we'll have
a grand wedding for her.

141
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,399
No, l will get you married.

142
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,560
- Really? And to whom will
l get married? - To me.

143
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,709
No way! l won't marry you.
You are a very bad girl.

144
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,590
l shall marry the best.

145
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,310
Tell me Bina, who is the best?

146
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,410
- Shall l tell you?
Shall l tell you? - Yes.

147
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,360
- My brother.
- You naughty girl!

148
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,210
- Champa!
- Brother!

149
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,640
Yes, Bina. Bina, Bina,
Bina, Bina.

150
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,630
Bina, Bina, Bina, Bina.

151
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,729
Champa, l've told you many
times not to do this daily.

152
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,129
l would like to
clean her up myself.

153
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,070
But you come home weary.

154
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,880
What do you mean l come home weary?
l can manage everything on my own.

155
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,139
Brother,
bring me some sweet dumplings.

156
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,500
l'll bring you sweet dumplings.
l'll bring my girl toys as well.

157
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,380
l'll bring her
anything she asks for.

158
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,320
Brother, Champa says you,
brother, are the best.

159
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,700
Now you sit here and study for a
bit. l'll fetch your book for you.

160
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,040
No brother, l'm feeling sleepy.

161
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,040
How could you be sleepy?
l took you all this time...

162
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,870
and brought you so many things.

163
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,970
Now study for a little while.
My Bina studies more than the rest.

164
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,140
My Bina is such a good girl,
she recites her lessons daily.

165
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,530
Very good, my dear.
My Bina is not a bad girl.

166
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,360
She does very good work.
She works more than all...

167
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,030
and then she studies.
Tell me what you learned yesterday.

168
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,210
What did you learn yesterday?
Good girl.

169
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,190
- ls Bina asleep? - lt's 10:00
PM but you aren't asleep yet.

170
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,490
l'm waiting up for father.
He's gone to aunt's house.

171
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,070
- Then he must be on the way.
- l heard you don't like my cooking.

172
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,050
- Who says so?
- And l heard you're annoyed with me.

173
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,750
- Why would l be annoyed with you?
- l help clean Bina.

174
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,060
- You said so yourself.
- Yes, l'll start taking her with me.

175
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,130
What'll she do there?

176
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,390
l leave her here
at your insistence...

177
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,600
but you've taught
her many bad things.

178
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,000
- l?
- Yes, you.

179
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,889
Get up, get up. Get up.
Let me sleep. Go on, get up!

180
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,180
You go to bed as well.

181
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,820
But tell me what l've done.

182
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,340
Tell you what you've done?
You told her l'm the best.

183
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,510
Why did you say it?
How do you know l'm the best?

184
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,330
And what makes you
think l'm the best?

185
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,210
You're getting
annoyed with me again.

186
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,280
Look Champa, for the
past few days l've noticed...

187
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,770
you stare at me.
l don't like all that.

188
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,210
What's the reason?
Who says l'm such a good man?

189
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,480
Talk. Talk. Why are you silent now?

190
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,500
- Please forgive me.
- Forgive you. Forgive you.

191
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,250
Forgive you.
First you offend someone...

192
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,040
and then ask for forgiveness.
What nonsense!

193
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,340
You're right.

194
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,050
There's no reason to cry.
And what right do you have to cry?

195
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,719
l'm the best? You love me?

196
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,030
Answer me.
What sort of a game is this?

197
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,030
What am l to understand
from your crying?

198
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,170
Maybe you're unhappy.
That's why you're crying.

199
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,540
Possibly you're bothered
because of your poverty.

200
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,230
lt might not be love
for me that bothers you.

201
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,930
lf you love me,
then just admit you love me.

202
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,020
Talk! Won't you answer me? Talk!

203
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,360
Okay. Touch my hand.

204
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,070
lf you touch it,
l'll know you love me.

205
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,399
And if you don't touch it,
l'll know you're crazy...

206
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,920
and that's why you cry.

207
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,950
Go! Go away! Go away! Go away!

208
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,720
- Who were you telling off, brother?
- Nobody. Nobody.

209
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,510
- Tell me.
- Juju came just now.

210
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,760
He told me to leave Bina
and go with him. l told him off.

211
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,330
l'm frightened, brother!
- No, no, don't be afraid.

212
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,170
Don't be afraid.
Juju won't come now.

213
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,520
Go to sleep now.
Rest. Rest. You're a good girl.

214
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,740
- No, brother...
- Juju will never return.

215
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,130
Juju won't come here again,
l'll play a tune.

216
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,409
l'll put you to sleep.
He'll never come.

217
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,709
Love can only be paid back with love.

218
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,860
Who deserves it more than Bina?

219
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,040
You raised her. She has
nobody but you in this world.

220
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,020
Bina's life might be affected
if you fall in love with Champa.

221
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,270
You expect her to forget it.
ls that possible?

222
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,780
But how do l suppress
this sudden storm in my heart.

223
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,300
How do l end it?

224
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,070
You can put an end to this storm.

225
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,949
Leave this city right away.

226
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,649
So Champa and you might
never see each other.

227
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,139
lf you don't forget Champa
then you must forget Bina.

228
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,200
- Silence!
- Brother! Brother! Brother!

229
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,159
Bina! Bina!

230
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,679
- Brother! Brother! What
are you doing? - We're leaving.

231
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,300
- Where to?
- Elsewhere.

232
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,420
- Will Champa go with us?
- No, no! Champa won't go with us.

233
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,860
- When will we return?
- Never.

234
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,600
Who will dress me
if Champa won't be there?

235
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,389
l will. l'll dress you myself.

236
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,680
l'll dress you myself.
Sit on my shoulder.

237
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,950
Brother, l'd like to see the owner.

238
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,820
- Why?
- l have business with him.

239
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
What business?

240
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,070
l've come because l have business.

241
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,689
- Why else would l come?
- Go.

242
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,530
But l would like to see
the manager of this company.

243
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,980
So, who's that?

244
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,620
But a lady is seated there.

245
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,689
She's the manager
and owner of this company.

246
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,030
- Brother.
- Yes.

247
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,840
She looks just like Champa.

248
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,409
Be quiet. Don't say that.
You want me to be beaten?

249
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,510
- Who is it? - l don't know.
He wishes to see you.

250
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,200
Send him in.

251
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,520
She will see you.

252
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,890
Greetings. Say hello.

253
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,320
- What do you want?
- l've come to see you.

254
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,600
And who is this child?

255
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,720
My sister.

256
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,000
You don't appear to be from Mumbai.

257
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,669
That's correct. l'm from Munger.

258
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,190
The place of the earthquake?

259
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,070
Yes, there was an earthquake.
Our house collapsed.

260
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,090
Both my parents were lost in it.

261
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,080
l went far and wide looking
for them but they weren't found.

262
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,420
- But why are you worried?
You have your brother. - Yes.

263
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:21,080
- Brother, she talks just
like Champa. - Be quiet.

264
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,139
Pardon me.
l've wasted your precious time.

265
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,180
l'm bothering you simply
because l read an ad...

266
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,400
in the newspaper about your firm.

267
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,610
l felt l should give it a try.
l hoped you might consider me.

268
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,470
Yes. The position is still vacant.

269
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,540
But may l ask what
your qualifications are?

270
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,350
My qualification.
l failed the eleventh grade.

271
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,840
- Failed the eleventh grade?
- Yes, yes.

272
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,840
- What is it?
- Ma'am, these are job applications.

273
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,430
The post is taken.

274
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,030
Why didn't you tell me before
the post had been filled?

275
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,980
You wasted both your time and mine.

276
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,350
Excuse me.
You have filled the post.

277
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,120
- Meaning, meaning, meaning,
you are employing me? - Yes.

278
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,750
Junior! Junior! l'm an employee!

279
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,639
How do l thank you?

280
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,060
Where are you going?

281
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,070
- l'm going inside.
- There's nobody inside.

282
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,419
Do you know l'm an employee?

283
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,740
- Ma'am, this is no way to...
- Come in.

284
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,630
What did you wish to ask?

285
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,110
l wish to ask you where
my seat is and my job description.

286
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,010
You said you'd tell me today.

287
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,650
Starting today,
you're my private secretary...

288
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,270
and that's your desk.

289
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,810
You mean l must sit here?
ln this room?

290
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,120
That's right. Why? Any problem?

291
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,060
Oh no. No problem.

292
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,850
- And where will l sit?
- You?

293
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,410
l'll show you
your place, too. Come.

294
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,330
Brother, please bring
me sweets worth two paisa.

295
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,770
And who will man the post here?

296
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,440
- Run and get it while l stay here.
- That's not possible.

297
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,149
Look brother,
if you don't bring it...

298
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,470
l'll tell your boss
you don't do any work.

299
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,200
You only sit here
smoking all day long.

300
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,220
You know she's a good
friend of mine, don't you?

301
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,370
Oh no, junior. Don't be upset.
l'll bring it right away.

302
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,620
Brother, bring the red and green ones.

303
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:23,110
My heart chirps

304
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:38,390
lt chirps. lt chirps.
My heart chirps

305
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,470
Youth is carefree

306
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:03,250
lt does as it pleases.
Youth is carefree

307
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,149
When the weather is pleasant...

308
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,100
my heart chirps

309
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,820
- Tell me, did you like it?
- Yes.

310
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,930
But it sounds like
you've learned it recently.

311
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,260
Come here, Bina.
l wish to tell you something.

312
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,150
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,280
Ask your brother
if his heart is empty or filled.

314
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,790
Brother, she asked...

315
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,800
Yes, yes, yes. Tell her,
brother's heart is totally deserted.

316
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,679
lt's in ruins. lt has moss
growing on the doors and walls.

317
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,660
- Brother says...
- Okay, tell him, if that's true...

318
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,730
why doesn't he
find someone to fill it?

319
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,380
The ruins will turn into
an immaculate place. Go.

320
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,850
Brother, she says
why don't you fill it?

321
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,440
Then the immaculate
place will turn into ruins.

322
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,370
- Huh? - No, no. lt'll turn
into an immaculate place.

323
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,740
Okay, okay. Tell her, brother
is afraid of an immaculate place...

324
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,050
and he loves the ruins. Go.

325
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,290
Brother says...

326
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,720
Okay. Tell him, sensible
people don't say such things.

327
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,220
lf the heart remains
vacant a little longer...

328
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,980
it will be occupied
by witches and bad spirits.

329
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,320
- Brother, she says...
- Okay, okay. Listen.

330
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,939
Go.

331
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:50,500
Brother says a witch has
occupied his heart for a long time.

332
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,400
Really? Didn't you ask him
what the witch's name is? Ask.

333
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,669
What is the witch's name, brother?

334
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,870
- Bina.
- Bina.

335
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,200
Mr. Amar, do you know
how far we are from the city?

336
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,350
What kind of question is that?

337
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,190
We're in the car,
so how would l know?

338
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,080
l could have told
you if we were walking.

339
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,129
Haven't you been in a car before?

340
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,430
Yes, l've been in a taxi a few times.

341
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,960
But this is a taxi as well.

342
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,790
lf that's the case,
please tell me the fare in advance...

343
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,629
lest there be a dispute later.

344
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,490
Why did you stop the car?

345
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,830
To tell you the fare.

346
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,969
Mr. Amar,
l would like you to permit me...

347
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,700
to win you, with your blessings.

348
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,570
Well, this isn't a bad deal,
but, it is strange ma'am...

349
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,050
travelling fifty to sixty
miles from Mumbai...

350
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,889
has brought about
such a change in you.

351
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,850
- l pray the car stalls.
- lt did stall finally.

352
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,120
Are you implying
l deliberately stalled it?

353
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,480
You think l don't understand?

354
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,800
How could you possibly
stall such a huge car?

355
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,889
lt's not a human being.

356
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,020
My darling is naive.
He doesn't comprehend love

357
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,890
My darling plays with
my younger sister-in-law...

358
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,270
while the mood goes to waste

359
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,250
My beloved,
he doesn't comprehend love

360
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,990
My darling is naive.
He doesn't comprehend love

361
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,270
l spread the blanket
on a high scaffold

362
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,530
My darling went to sleep

363
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,980
l sat there alone.
l felt offended

364
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,110
He doesn't comprehend love

365
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,990
My darling is naive.
He doesn't comprehend love

366
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,390
Greetings, brother.

367
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,310
Greetings, sir.
Greetings. Please sit.

368
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,830
l learned your car broke down.

369
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,070
Yes, it seems so.

370
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,450
But tell me, can we find
a place to spend the night?

371
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,660
Oh no, finding a place
to stay is difficult.

372
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,210
As you can see, there's only one room.

373
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,259
l see. Then we
can sleep out here.

374
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,290
Yes, that's possible.
You won't have any problem, nor l.

375
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,970
And food can be arranged.
Will you have cannabis?

376
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,210
Oh no. No cannabis. No cannabis.

377
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,530
What is your caste?

378
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,630
l? l'm a Brahmin but
l don't know about her.

379
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,860
You mean you got married
without knowing her caste?

380
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,390
We aren't married.
l keep proposing but he refuses.

381
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,040
Oh lord!
You proposed marriage yourself?

382
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,720
What choice did l have?
l tried hinting...

383
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,399
but he wouldn't understand.
Finally l blurted it out.

384
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,060
- Have you studied English?
- Yes.

385
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,500
Well, then, that's okay.

386
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,509
God!

387
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,880
What a moonlight!

388
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,750
l wish l could
come here every day...

389
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,370
and the car runs
out of gas every time.

390
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,899
Right, Amar?

391
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,510
That's your wish.

392
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,870
But you must bring another companion.

393
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,600
Why do you detest me so?

394
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,450
Detest? How could l detest you?

395
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,500
You're my boss and
l your employee.

396
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,790
But l don't want you
to remain my employee.

397
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,360
That can be remedied easily.
Fire me.

398
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,710
Why won't you understand
what l'm trying to say?

399
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:52,110
l understand everything.
lt's late. Go to sleep.

400
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,399
Or if you wish l
could go to Mumbai...

401
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,279
and send both, the driver
and gas by the first train.

402
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,390
Just the gas would do.

403
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,230
l see.

404
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
Give me.

405
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,030
Give me. Give my coat to me.

406
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,730
She's going to irritate
me all night long.

407
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,529
Bina's temperature went up
last night, sir. lt was very high.

408
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,960
Temperature?

409
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,460
Why didn't you summon the doctor?

410
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,490
Ass! l go out one day
and he aggravates my daughter.

411
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,610
Brother.

412
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,970
- Brother.
- Bina.

413
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,810
Bina.

414
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,830
Hello. Hello. This is Amar.

415
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,280
Dr. Joshi, please come quick.
Bina is ill. Please be quick.

416
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,930
- Doctor?
- The child has caught cold.

417
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,029
That's why she's running a fever.

418
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,879
Send the servant over
and l'll give him the medicine.

419
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,240
- There's no reason to panic,
is there? - No, not at all.

420
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,100
- Bye.
- Bye.

421
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,299
Narayan, why are you
nodding off over here?

422
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,160
Go to bed.

423
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,020
Go on, go to bed.

424
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,610
Bina.

425
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,040
Bina, open your eyes.

426
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,760
Look, Narayan is heating
milk to bring to you.

427
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,790
My Bina will drink her milk.
Bina is a very good girl.

428
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,460
Open your eyes, Bina.

429
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,290
Please have your tea, sir.
You've been awake all night.

430
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,520
You get some rest
while l sit next to her.

431
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,650
Hello.

432
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,110
Hello. Oh! lt's you.

433
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,780
l cannot come.

434
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,080
- Bina's had a fever since yesterday.
- That's no reason to panic.

435
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,140
Children keep getting ill.

436
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,310
Look, attending the party
this evening is imperative.

437
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,990
No, l can't come.

438
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,630
Bina.

439
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,990
Bina. Open your eyes.
Get up. Drink your milk.

440
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,530
Narayan has brought
hot milk for you.

441
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,710
The doctor said Bina will get
better when she drinks hot milk.

442
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,040
My Bina will drink hot milk.

443
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,089
- Hello! - You mean you won't
go to the party this evening?

444
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,410
- l told you Bina is very ill.
- You must go.

445
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,509
ls that an order?
How can you expect me to leave her?

446
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,940
l gave my word.

447
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,190
Hello? Hello?

448
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,600
What are you doing
over and over again?

449
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,280
You hang up before our
conversation is finished.

450
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,500
l'm free from this transgression.

451
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,800
Goodbye Narayan. l am leaving.

452
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,270
Hello. There's no Amar over here.

453
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,410
l don't know any Amar.
Only Mr. Narayan is here.

454
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,320
Hang up! Shut up!

455
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,220
And once more his
great love for Bina...

456
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,430
drives Amar away from
his life of ease and luxury...

457
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,750
and after five years of hardship
and struggle we find him.

458
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,200
Sir, this man is very hardworking.

459
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,590
Sir, this man does
his job very well.

460
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,580
Sir, this man works day and night.

461
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,399
Sir, this man is a scoundrel.
He doesn't do any work.

462
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,520
l'd fire him at the end of
this month if you gave the word.

463
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,910
Sure, but the man
appears very well-built.

464
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,150
The basis of his anger
is something else, sir.

465
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,090
- lf you don't mind l'd like to tell you.
-Yes.

466
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,140
Sir, our homes are
in the same vicinity.

467
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:40,100
My Shera barks at him
when he passes my house.

468
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,819
He's angry with me for that.

469
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:46,400
Lies! Complete lies! His Shera
is my Chameli's offspring, sir.

470
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,590
No way would he bark at me.
You're lying.

471
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,319
He didn't bark at him earlier, sir.

472
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,880
He barks at him ever
since he sold Chameli.

473
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,150
Do you see how
rude he is, sir?

474
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,970
He doesn't greet you properly?

475
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,850
Don't you see the
boss is standing here?

476
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,680
So what should l do?

477
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,740
Did he hire me to work
or to salute him?

478
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,990
You're back to your work?

479
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,610
Can't you at least bow to the boss?

480
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,220
Mr. Rajender, l'd like
you to settle this matter today.

481
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,450
Did you hire me here
to work or to salute you?

482
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,890
You need not ask.
l've employed you to work.

483
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,030
Lend me your ears, sir.

484
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,240
Please don't compare
me with your other employees.

485
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,230
lf you bother me
one bit hereafter then...

486
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,920
What will you do?
Hang me? Murder me?

487
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,750
l'll skin you and stuff
you with sawdust, get it?

488
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,360
Do you see that, sir?
The new generation.

489
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,630
This man hadn't eaten for three days.

490
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,970
He came to me looking for a job.

491
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,860
l felt sorry for him
and employed him and today...

492
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,390
And why don't you also tell him...

493
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,780
you took his ancestral silver
ring he was left with as a bribe.

494
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,500
Not true, sir, it was brass.

495
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,060
- ls your name Amar?
- Yes.

496
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:13,290
l'd like to know if man can
survive three days without food.

497
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,700
Mr. Rajender,
l can't speak for others...

498
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,290
but many times l've starved
three days at a time and survived.

499
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,460
And you never tried to beg?

500
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,380
No. Coincidentally
l didn't get a job...

501
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,359
but l couldn't bring myself to beg.

502
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,450
You seem to be a respectable man.

503
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,359
That's right. As long as
l had good luck and had money...

504
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,470
l was respectable.
Ever since l became poor...

505
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,089
and troubles besieged me,
l'm a disgrace.

506
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,310
How's that?

507
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,250
Mr. Rajender, apparently
you don't know the laws of society.

508
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,490
Mr. Amar, give me your address.

509
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,020
- Brother.
- Would you like some betel leaf?

510
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,650
Does Mr. Amar live here?

511
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,640
Mr. Amar...

512
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,900
Do you know his address?

513
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,110
- You know, the tall strong man who
works at the factory. -Yes, yes.

514
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,150
Look, the address is written here.
Number 45.

515
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,360
- Forty-five. Forty-five.
- l get that, sir.

516
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,840
- You have business with him?
- Yes, business.

517
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,609
l don't know. l'm new here.
l came here only yesterday.

518
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:09,970
l see.

519
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,010
Where does Amar live? The tall man.

520
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,970
- This way.
- ln this lane?

521
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,230
- Yes.
- Okay.

522
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,610
Does Mr. Amar live here?

523
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,230
You want to know about brother?

524
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,670
l see. So Mr. Amar is your brother?

525
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,130
Would you tell him Mr.
Rajender wishes to see him?

526
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,459
Lies. My brother has no friend
by the name of Rajender.

527
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,899
Excuse me.

528
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,720
What's it to you? Just tell him.

529
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,810
- l won't do that. - lf you don't
tell him, l'll call out to him.

530
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,879
- Call.
- Mr. Amar!

531
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,170
Mr. Amar!

532
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,980
Mr. Amar!

533
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:22,610
- Call him again.
- You'll make a noise again.

534
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,850
Certainly. Tell me what
business you have first.

535
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,540
l have very important business,
but l can only tell him.

536
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,129
l won't call brother
unless you tell me.

537
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,270
But you wouldn't understand.

538
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,910
Why wouldn't l understand?
Am l a child?

539
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,049
- l'll be fifteen this year.
- You are an obstinate girl.

540
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,830
l am writing a book about
all people around the world...

541
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,950
with diverse customs,
the condition of their lives...

542
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,190
their happiness,
and their problems.

543
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,250
So tell me,
what's going on with your trial?

544
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:54,029
lt's god's grace. The hearing is
the day after tomorrow, brother.

545
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,770
God willing, l'll win.

546
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,549
Yes, you have a strong case.

547
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:58,970
And even more importantly...

548
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,640
my lawyer is very good.

549
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,090
Where you going, brother?
Come have a betel leaf.

550
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,380
- Uncle? When did you return
from your village? - Today.

551
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,350
- Are your kids well?
- Yes, god is merciful.

552
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,430
And my youngest son Shankar
misses you very much.

553
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,069
Yes, he must be grown now.

554
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:19,060
Brother. Brother.
Something strange has happened.

555
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,210
- A strange man?
- Yes. He's wearing a suit.

556
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,540
He asked about you.
l told him no Amar lives here.

557
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,400
Then he questioned your sister.

558
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,940
l signalled her not to tell.
l hope she understood.

559
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,160
What's the harm even if she tells?

560
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,040
lt could be harmful. He
looks like a secret police to me.

561
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,230
He carried a small book, too.

562
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,830
- So why didn't you punch him?
-What are you saying, brother?

563
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,220
l'm a thief.
How can l assault him?

564
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,330
To hell with him!
l'll deal with him right away.

565
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,160
Are you going to write
so many details in that book?

566
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,259
- Yes.
- Will you also write about...

567
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,810
the potato peels l tossed at you?

568
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,450
Yes, l'll write that as well.

569
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,150
Will you call your brother now?

570
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:02,560
The fact is, my brother hasn't
returned from work, mister.

571
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,350
He hasn't returned from work?

572
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,670
But he left the factory
at 4:00 PM today.

573
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,910
Factory?

574
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,009
What factory?

575
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,250
l guess you're mistaken.

576
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,300
My brother Amar
is a school teacher.

577
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,170
You must be looking
for another Mr. Amar.

578
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,570
- Schoolteacher?
- Yes, yes.

579
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,700
Give me a description
of my brother Amar.

580
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,910
Your brother is fair skinned,
burly and very tall.

581
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,270
That's untrue. My brother
isn't like that. He isn't.

582
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,879
My brother is dark skinned,
thin and as short as me.

583
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,490
- Oh, what a blunder!
- Yes, sir.

584
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,720
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.

585
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,010
- Then why didn't you tell me before?
- No sir.

586
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,430
Mr. Rajender?

587
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,430
- Mr. Amar, is this your house?
- Yes.

588
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,040
Come in, come in.

589
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,140
Mr. Amar,
before l say anything else...

590
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,439
- l have to complain.
- Complain? Tell me.

591
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,100
- Call your sister.
- Apparently my sister was up to mischief.

592
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,480
Junior! Bina! Come here.

593
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,880
Why don't you come here?
Come here. Come, come.

594
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,330
Mr. Amar, you won't believe this.

595
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:33,779
Your sister told at least
150 lies in thirty minutes.

596
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,620
That's why she's hiding her face.

597
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,910
You hear that?
Mr. Rajender says you lied to him.

598
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,380
Come. Come here. Look. Come, come.

599
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,670
Come.

600
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,310
Closer. Closer. Closer.

601
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,529
- Did you lie?
- Yes, brother.

602
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:57,930
Why?

603
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:01,819
Brother, he was enquiring about you.

604
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:07,740
l thought, if l tell
him brother isn't at home...

605
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,070
he might say he'd wait inside.

606
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,730
And when you'd come home...

607
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,210
you'd ask me why
l let a stranger into the home.

608
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:21,149
Then again if l told him
you didn't live here and he left...

609
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,670
and he turned out
to be your friend...

610
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,630
who has some business with you...

611
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,290
then you'd get upset
l didn't invite him in.

612
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:33,259
l thought about that
and kept him busy.

613
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,690
So you could get here
and speak to him personally.

614
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,930
l just said whatever l
could think of during this time.

615
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,810
Do you hear that, Mr. Rajender?
l hope you have no grievance now.

616
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,320
No sir, not at all. l didn't
know your sister was so intelligent.

617
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,710
Very good!

618
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,050
Bina, this is my boss, Mr. Rajender.

619
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,660
l work at his factory.
Say hello. Go on.

620
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,980
Say hello. Come on, say hello.

621
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,810
Brother, so he made a mistake.

622
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,530
Had he told me this earlier...

623
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:06,120
l would you have invited
him to sit and offered him tea.

624
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,640
Very good!

625
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,459
Okay, take this and put it away.

626
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,299
Take care you don't
cut your finger.

627
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,920
Mr. Rajender, my sister is all
l have left to keep me going in life.

628
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,070
You've heard all the details...

629
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,690
and you can imagine
the troubles l went through...

630
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,010
to raise her.

631
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,580
She was so little
when l left the house.

632
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:37,279
Mr. Amar, frankly speaking your
character is worthy of writing in a book.

633
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,940
Actually that's the reason l came.

634
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:44,540
l'm writing a book.
l'd like some help from you.

635
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,380
What are you saying?

636
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,630
Book and laborer
are like chalk and cheese.

637
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,100
Anyway, that shouldn't bother you.
That's my concern.

638
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,689
Just come to my house with me...

639
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,720
so l may speak
with you undisturbed.

640
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,060
Look, l am in no condition
to visit a bigwig's home...

641
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,050
but l guess l'll accompany
you since you asked.

642
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,590
Brother, please come back soon.

643
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,390
- Why? Are you afraid?
- No, l'm not afraid.

644
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:15,870
But l get very hungry.
And l don't eat without brother.

645
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,750
That means you love
your brother very much?

646
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,660
That's right.
And brother loves me, too.

647
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,390
Liar! l don't love you.

648
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,470
You don't? Okay.

649
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,440
Then l'll do the dishes today...

650
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,060
and my face and hands will get dirty.
And l won't eat either.

651
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:36,460
- Then who will get a beating?
- And who will cry? Me or you.

652
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,950
You wouldn't understand.

653
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,170
l slapped her once
over some mischief.

654
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,660
She seemed to take
it in her stride...

655
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,420
but l continued to cry
for two hours. She only moped.

656
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,520
Mr. Amar, it's normal for
siblings to love each other...

657
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,400
but your case is praiseworthy.

658
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,180
That's nothing, sir. Come with me.

659
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,730
Look at this, Mr. Rajender.

660
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,180
All this is memorabilia
from Bina's childhood.

661
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,700
No matter the hardships l face...

662
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:29,089
all these items are always
with me. For example... this knife.

663
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,170
She persisted until
l got it for her.

664
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,069
One day, she was sharpening a pencil
when she cut half her finger.

665
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,330
For three months it was bandaged.

666
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,490
And... Look at this. This shoe.

667
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,760
You might wonder where
the other shoe is.

668
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,990
lt's like this. She got blisters
on her feet with that shoe.

669
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,210
She got angry, got rid
of it and limped around on one shoe.

670
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,980
Bina! Bina! Where did
the pacifier disappear?

671
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,250
That's with me, brother.

672
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,069
Why? Why remove it from here?

673
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:09,050
Brother,
l tried it to see how it tastes.

674
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,690
ldiot. Put it back.

675
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,819
She's a weirdo, sir.
l used to bring such pacifiers...

676
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:18,060
and within an hour
or two she would chew them up.

677
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:21,730
Here.

678
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,470
Have some.

679
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:34,430
- Brothers! l've been robbed!
- What happened?

680
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,100
- Yes, yes!
- Silence please.

681
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,400
First ask him how much he lost.

682
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,770
You want to know how much?

683
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,990
- You would hurt if you
lost that much. - Tell us.

684
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:52,279
Listen. 5975 was the
number on the five rupee note.

685
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,500
The five rupee note was
real and a fake two rupee note.

686
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,830
And... fifty paise.

687
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,070
Oh Ram! Thank god! Thank god!

688
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,759
Thank god! Thank god! Thank god!

689
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,040
What's the matter, brother?
What happened?

690
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,450
What can l tell you, my girl?
Just thank god! Thank god!

691
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,070
Take this. Look at it.

692
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,660
Tell me, how can one
trust anybody in this world?

693
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,920
There's no more faith
in this world, my dear.

694
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,320
What happened, brother?

695
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,040
l worked through the month.
Toiled day and night...

696
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,230
and when l demanded money,
he made excuses.

697
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,730
When he finally gave it to me,
he gave a fake two rupee note.

698
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,720
Now tell me, to whom do l complain?

699
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,620
Ram! Ram! Ram! Thank you, god!

700
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,600
That's no reason to worry, brother.

701
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,260
Neither will the boss be able
to build castles for two rupees...

702
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,120
nor will we become rich.

703
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,630
As long as you
are fit and healthy...

704
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,990
god will give us
thousands of rupees.

705
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,900
God is my sole support.
He sends it to me somehow.

706
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,420
And from places where there's
no hope at all. None at all.

707
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,510
Yes, brother.
Only god knows his ways.

708
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,370
Thank you, god! Thank you!

709
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,050
Mr. Amar,
l have no leisure pursuits.

710
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,110
By god's grace l have everything.

711
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,920
All l want is to write a book
that will make a name for me.

712
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,300
l pray it happens.

713
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,800
Yes, l'm doing my best.
lf only you would help me, too.

714
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,280
Please excuse me.
This isn't my cup of tea.

715
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,150
You don't get it, Mr. Amar.

716
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,020
l want you to come
stay here for a few days...

717
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,850
so l might study your life.

718
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,839
Mr. Rajender, l can't do that.

719
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,820
But you won't have any problems.

720
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,000
Look, Mr. Amar,
this drawing room, that bedroom...

721
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,930
and this good quality furniture,
all for your convenience.

722
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:09,030
Mr. Rajender, are you trying
to entice a child with toys?

723
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:13,740
You should know some time
back l, too, had a house like this.

724
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,319
lt was furnished. l willingly
left it to my servant Narayan.

725
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,870
Have you ever considered the fact...

726
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,110
if you evaluate
this furniture justly...

727
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,850
roughly 100 people could
be provided food and shelter.

728
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,530
People who have no place
to live or food to eat.

729
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:35,200
Mr. Amar, quite frankly, this
has never occurred to me before now.

730
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:39,520
That means you've been
living life with your eyes shut.

731
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,240
- Who's it for?
- The master's guest.

732
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,180
So a new creature is here today?

733
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,300
Back. Back. Take it away!

734
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,649
- Rajen!
- Yes, father.

735
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,509
- l tell you, you've lost your mind.
- Excuse me, father.

736
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,040
Didn't you find a saint today?
You brought yet another man.

737
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,780
ls this house a
sanctuary or a hotel?

738
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,090
l've told you so many times...

739
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,990
if you want to open a sanctuary...

740
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,710
why not do it at the factory?

741
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,630
Why do you ruin the
furniture in the house!

742
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,560
Father, you interfere without
understanding a thing.

743
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:19,009
You don't know. My book can't
be completed without their help.

744
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,740
So who asked you to write a book?

745
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,220
You harp about the
book all day long.

746
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:28,640
The father never wrote a letter
and the son is writing a book!

747
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,180
ldiot!

748
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,990
Mr. Amar,
please don't be offended by father.

749
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,590
He just rambles on.

750
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,620
Quite possibly, Mr. Rajender.

751
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,859
Some people pass out
after consuming alcohol...

752
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,780
while others are comatose
under the influence of money.

753
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,690
Pardon me but you're one of them.
l'll take your leave now.

754
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,170
As you wish. l can't force you.

755
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:51,580
But promise me something.

756
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:55,210
Our friendship won't
be affected in any way.

757
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,500
Look, there's a great
disparity between you and me.

758
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:00,810
Nonetheless, l shall do my best.
Well, goodbye.

759
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:39,750
Do you have to play the drum
even if there's no audience?

760
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,390
You're hurting my ears
for no reason whatsoever.

761
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,360
That's all well and good, brother...

762
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,790
but l composed
a beautiful song just now.

763
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,100
Shut up! A tone deaf
person can't compose a song.

764
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:55,600
No brother, you must listen
to it or l'll get upset.

765
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,530
Okay. Sing. Let's hear it. Sing.

766
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,220
But brother,
don't laugh or make me laugh.

767
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,280
Okay, l won't. Sing.

768
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,690
Brother doesn't eat with me

769
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,370
How is he to feed
himself or feed another?

770
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,910
There are no groceries
in the house

771
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,090
Brother doesn't eat with me

772
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,630
He won't let me eat
and doesn't eat himself

773
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,340
He acts high and mighty

774
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,880
He thinks Bina is still naive

775
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,520
His ears are red with anger

776
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,850
Brother doesn't eat with me

777
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,400
What do you think, brother?

778
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:09,080
- How much is this?
- A quarter.

779
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,970
- This?
- One rupee.

780
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,799
- This? - A quarter.
- This? - Thirty-five paisa.

781
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,320
- This. - Fifty paisa.
- This? - Seventy-five Paisa.

782
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,670
- This? - One rupee.
- This? - A quarter.

783
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,730
And what if l don't have a quarter?

784
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,280
- Then don't buy it.
- Listen.

785
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,240
Can't we make a deal?

786
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:31,720
Look, my brother gives
me two paisa every day.

787
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:35,240
So take the two paisa
and give me the item.

788
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:41,520
Then you take two paisa tomorrow,
the day after, and so on.

789
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,150
And this way your
money will be paid off.

790
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,130
Oh no, no need for that.
You take what you want.

791
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,920
Don't worry about the money.

792
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,480
No, mister. l can't take it.

793
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,759
- Why?
- Brother will get annoyed.

794
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,070
l know how scared
you are of your brother.

795
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,000
- Tell me what you want.
- Mister...

796
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,690
don't talk to me that way.

797
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:07,279
- Why not?
- You aren't my brother.

798
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:09,770
- Okay, tell me what you want.
- l want nothing.

799
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,860
You won't take it?
l'll complain to your brother.

800
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,900
- Don't hold me responsible then.
- l'm not afraid of that.

801
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,710
But l'll take it
if you do as l say.

802
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,970
- What's that?
- l'll take these things now.

803
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,280
You pay him.

804
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:26,750
But l'll owe you the money.

805
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,650
Either l'll ask
brother to give it to you...

806
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:33,340
or l'll pay back two paisa a day.

807
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,100
Okay, tell me what you want.

808
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,500
This, this, this, this, this.

809
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,350
Please pack all these items, brother.

810
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,319
Okay, sir.

811
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:05,120
Now calculate the money.
How much did you pay him?

812
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,589
Why are you concerned
about the money?

813
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,060
Consider these a gift from me.

814
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:14,860
Why would l do that?
Why would l accept gifts from you?

815
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:18,589
But strangers can
come close this way.

816
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:22,400
But how's that possible?
You are rich and we are poor.

817
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,310
How can we come close?

818
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:27,120
- Who told you that?
- Brother said so.

819
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,259
Bina, why don't you
suggest to your brother...

820
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,780
to come stay with
me for a few days?

821
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,850
And you come and
stay there as well.

822
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,680
What do you have in your house?
Do you have very nice stuff?

823
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,160
l have lots of stuff.
A big house, many servants...

824
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,920
and good quality furniture.

825
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,630
What furniture?
You mean tables, chairs and beds?

826
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:51,620
Yes. And l have two
or three cars as well.

827
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,980
Really?

828
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:59,520
lf l stay at your house,
will you take me for a drive every day?

829
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,730
Never mind taking you for a drive,
l'll give you the car.

830
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,170
You'll give me a car?
For sure? - For sure.

831
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,380
You rich men tell lies.

832
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,510
- Who told you that?
- Brother says so.

833
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,600
- From where did all this stuff come?
- l bought it.

834
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,180
And who paid for it?

835
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,519
Mr. Rajender showed up.
He paid for it.

836
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,750
Damn Rajender!
Why did you ask him for money?

837
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,500
l didn't ask him.
The vendor was there.

838
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:39,099
l was asking him the prices.

839
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,630
He came along and bought
this stuff against my will.

840
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:47,300
l told him l don't want
it but he wouldn't relent.

841
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,200
So l told him l'd
tell brother to pay him.

842
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:53,010
Why did you go out
of the house at all?

843
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,550
You want to paint your
face with red make up, too?

844
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:57,730
l'll slap your face
until it becomes red.

845
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,529
lnsolent girl! You want to wear make up?
Throw everything out!

846
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:04,059
This too!

847
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:53,740
During the ancient ages
a man lived in a big city.

848
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:00,139
He used to work in a factory.

849
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:09,170
He had a kid sister
who was very nice.

850
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:14,469
She never got up to mischief.

851
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:24,720
Her brother reprimanded her daily
for no good reason.

852
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:34,230
And... And... And...
And... What's written here, brother?

853
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:49,420
- Brother, you aren't annoyed
with me now, are you? - No.

854
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,480
Then will you bring me something?

855
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,180
- What?
- Rouge make up.

856
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,690
My girl!

857
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,610
Oh! You're so late, brother.

858
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,670
When will l cook
and when will you eat?

859
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,680
My girl, we eat food every day...

860
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:19,440
but one doesn't
find god every day.

861
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,280
God? What are you saying, brother?

862
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,120
l mean it.

863
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,030
Oh no. Not yet.
Close your eyes first.

864
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,500
- Close your eyes.
-Oh no, brother. Show me first.

865
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:33,849
Never mind.

866
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,180
Okay.

867
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:38,490
l'll close my eyes.

868
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,450
- God.
- God.

869
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,490
Every day you complained
that god's throne was vacant.

870
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,550
lt won't remain vacant
any longer, will it?

871
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:29,570
That's right, brother.

872
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:35,560
See how nice it looks.

873
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,130
Brother,
how much did the alter cost you?

874
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,990
How much? Are you crazy?

875
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,190
You can't buy god.

876
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:49,670
He goes to the home of
the person on whom he shows mercy.

877
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,750
All that is very well,
brother, but how did you get it?

878
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,890
Did you ask someone for it?

879
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,500
You could say that.

880
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,280
lt was in a place where
nobody offered flowers or water.

881
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,250
l thought it best
l take it with me.

882
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,950
l didn't really take it.

883
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:07,870
Nobody can take
god against his wish.

884
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,450
That's true, brother. That's true.

885
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:12,990
lt's true, but why don't
you sing a bajan for god.

886
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,510
You provoke me every day.

887
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:16,139
Of course. Why not?

888
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:29,010
l chant your name every day

889
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:34,240
My dearest Shyam

890
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:45,179
l chant your name every day

891
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:51,910
l wander around as
a nun and lose my way

892
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:56,590
Roaming the streets
looking for you

893
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,340
Where are you my Lord Krishna

894
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:19,210
My dearest Shyam

895
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:28,620
l chant your name every day

896
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:34,920
Hail the revered
one who plays the flute

897
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,570
Hail, hail, hail, Queen Radha

898
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:56,940
My greetings to you

899
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,330
My dearest Shyam

900
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:14,930
l chant your name every day

901
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,740
- Hello.
- Brother isn't at home. Goodbye.

902
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:29,290
So what if brother isn't home?
You're at home.

903
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,740
l'm upset with you.

904
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,990
Upset with me? Why?

905
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,290
Of course. The other day
l told you not to buy me things...

906
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,719
but you wouldn't listen.

907
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,370
Finally brother got annoyed
with me and threw out everything.

908
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,370
l don't know how l'll repay you.

909
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:49,849
l don't care about that.
You have to repay me.

910
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,559
You won't get one paisa, mister.

911
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,290
- Why should l pay when
l don't have the articles? - Well done!

912
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:57,730
- You don't make good deals.
- That's right.

913
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,170
Very good.

914
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,900
- Hey, l drank from that glass.
- So what?

915
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,650
Now your mouth is dirty.

916
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,330
- Why's that?
- You drank the same water l did.

917
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,130
And l lie a lot.

918
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,140
Undoubtedly you lie a lot.

919
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:17,530
You just said brother
threw everything away.

920
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,519
But these bangles are still...

921
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,429
That's not it, mister.
l had hidden these.

922
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,250
You shouldn't have done that.

923
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:29,170
When brother threw away
all the other stuff...

924
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:35,210
- lt occurred to me to
toss them away but... - But?

925
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,240
l didn't.

926
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,580
- What will you do with them?
- Nothing. l'll keep them.

927
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:44,790
Really? Then why don't
you give me two bangles.

928
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,660
l'll keep them with me.

929
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,050
What for?

930
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,849
l will give them to
my wife when l get married.

931
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:54,940
Here. But give them
to her on my behalf.

932
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:57,570
Let me help you.

933
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,530
- l pray your wife is a fatso.
- Why?

934
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:07,190
So these bangles don't fit her.

935
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:12,299
- l pray she's exactly like you.
- Speak to brother.

936
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,200
Bina?

937
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,910
- Bina?
- Please leave quickly, mister.

938
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,760
Okay. Bina, l am leaving.

939
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:35,799
Look, l've brought you
some vermilion. Please take it.

940
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,740
- l won't.
- Why not?

941
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,840
lf you like,
you can pay me two paisa.

942
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:43,580
Please return in a
couple of days, mister.

943
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,000
Kusum, you worship god so much.

944
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:52,650
- Do you ever pray for anything?
- Yes, l do.

945
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:55,740
- What?
- Don't ask me that.

946
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,210
Why are you being coy with me?
Tell me, tell me.

947
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,540
Every day l pray to god...

948
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,280
that a poor husband
would be acceptable...

949
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,370
but not a gambler or alcoholic.

950
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,450
You silly!
Your wishes are lacking.

951
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:17,120
What if he's a good man and
he isn't a gambler or alcoholic...

952
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:24,960
but he's a toothless
old grouch who smokes all day long?

953
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,040
Oh no. God won't commit this injustice.

954
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:32,760
Whether he does or does not,
you must begin praying today.

955
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:40,160
Pray your husband is only three
or four years older than you...

956
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,730
well educated, not very hostile...

957
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:49,200
even if he's rich
and has a car...

958
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,190
but someone who's good natured.

959
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,410
One who loves me...

960
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:57,650
and surprises me
with nice saris and jewelry.

961
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,440
Say these things.

962
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:04,009
l didn't have all
these things on my mind.

963
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,270
You can keep all these things
in your mind and pray for them.

964
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,349
l was saying it for your benefit.

965
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,880
l have never prayed
or worshipped god to this day.

966
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,190
Brother refuses
to bring home an alter.

967
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:18,250
He says, Bina is my goddess Laxmi,
goddess Saraswati...

968
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:23,340
Ganga and Kali.
l don't worship any other.

969
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:28,270
Many times l told him to
bring a small alter for my sake.

970
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,350
He said,
you are a goddess yourself...

971
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:31,990
which goddess will you worship?

972
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,870
Now how do l answer that?

973
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,890
Ask your brother
the answer to that.

974
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:43,339
You ask my brother.
He's a brother to you as well.

975
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,650
No, no.

976
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:48,700
So that's how it is.

977
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:52,390
Okay, let's pray.

978
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:57,059
l'll talk to god today
into fulfilling your wish.

979
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:07,190
Take me to your town

980
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:15,800
Lord of Gokul

981
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:36,080
l'd like to be lost
in your thoughts

982
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:40,490
l'd like to stay
away from this world

983
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:52,719
This place is a market
of transgressions

984
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:56,510
Lord of Gokul

985
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:08,790
Take me to your town

986
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:17,240
Lord of Gokul

987
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:25,400
Keep showing us good things

988
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,860
Show us the correct path

989
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,990
Black clouds loom. Lord of Gokul

990
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,179
Take me to your town

991
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,690
Lord of Gokul

992
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,170
Don't hide it.
l've seen it. Who is that?

993
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,730
Your Bina.

994
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,820
And that?

995
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,250
Him?

996
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,480
Bina.

997
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,180
Good girls don't play such games.

998
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:41,650
Give it to me.

999
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,940
- l pray she's exactly like you.
- Speak to brother.

1000
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:05,680
l don't trust these rich men!
Animals!

1001
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,750
Bina! Bina! Disaster has struck.

1002
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,810
- What?
- A catastrophe. God is missing.

1003
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:19,950
How do you know?

1004
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:35,300
Oh god! What have
you gone and done, Bina?

1005
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:42,260
Why? What's wrong?
l wanted to speak to god privately.

1006
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,490
That's why l brought it.

1007
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,880
Bina, you've committed a sin.

1008
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:52,200
l don't know about that.
l'm losing my mind these days.

1009
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:58,230
Look Bina, l'm cautioning
you to take control of your mind...

1010
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,970
or else, god forbid,
you'll fall ill.

1011
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:10,650
l already know that.
Touch my forehead.

1012
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,960
Kusum, l'm going to bring
medicine from the doctor.

1013
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,000
l'll be back shortly.
Please keep an eye on her.

1014
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,780
l've been robbed.
l destroyed. Run! Run!

1015
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:44,090
Someone picked my pocket!
Run! Run! Thief!

1016
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,920
Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief!

1017
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,990
Where are you coming from?

1018
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,480
lt's nothing, brother.
Nothing.

1019
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:08,349
l was on the night shift.
l got off just now.

1020
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:10,820
Night shift. So you
refuse to quit your antics?

1021
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:15,680
No antics, brother.
The night shift pay is higher.

1022
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:18,129
- Nothing else.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

1023
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,790
Brother, l would if l didn't get hungry.

1024
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:23,670
Listen, brother. How is Bina?

1025
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,760
She's the same.
l'm going to bring medicine.

1026
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,440
Bina?

1027
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,080
How long has she been unwell?

1028
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:59,540
Three or four days.

1029
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:02,650
- Did the doctor come?
- No, he didn't come.

1030
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:05,620
Her brother has gone
to the doctor to get medicine.

1031
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,740
What medicine?
Such medicine doesn't do any good.

1032
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:14,080
Such patients require
a lot of care.

1033
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,150
The doctor should tend to her...

1034
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:17,770
and a nurse be here all day.

1035
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:19,349
That won't happen here.

1036
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,549
l'm taking her to my house.
She'll have all that over there.

1037
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:28,660
But let her brother
come back first.

1038
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,080
No need for that.

1039
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:33,290
When he returns tell him Mr.
Rajender took her to his house...

1040
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,240
and he should come there.

1041
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,060
Leaving a patient like
this even one minute...

1042
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,380
could be hazardous.

1043
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:50,500
Bina, don't panic. l'm taking
you to my house. ln the car.

1044
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:52,310
Yes.

1045
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,870
What do you want?
Let me help you.

1046
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:19,130
- He took Bina with him.
- Who took her?

1047
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,599
Mr. Rajender.

1048
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,770
Why'd you let him take her?

1049
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,770
l tried to stop him...

1050
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,969
but he said to send you
to his house when you return.

1051
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:29,190
Send me!

1052
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,620
Brother, l wasn't there.

1053
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,730
- Had l been he couldn't have taken her.
- Lies!

1054
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,200
Even you would lose.

1055
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,219
What's this?

1056
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:45,280
- Father, l...
- Damn father! Shame on you!

1057
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,210
The house was a refuge until now.

1058
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:52,219
Do you want to turn the
house into a highway now?

1059
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:55,930
What absurdity is this?
Do you want to disgrace me?

1060
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,360
Who have you brought
off the streets?

1061
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:01,280
And you rendered her
unconscious and brought her.

1062
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,000
Take a good look at her, father.

1063
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,610
- Such girls don't live in the streets.
- l don't want to know!

1064
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,099
Take her back immediately.

1065
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,660
Please calm down.

1066
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,120
We'll discuss it later.

1067
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:13,220
No way! l'll create a furor!
l'll set fire to the house!

1068
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:14,769
Take her out immediately!

1069
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:17,179
Okay, l'll take her away...

1070
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:22,090
but l'll stay at this
girl's house until she recovers.

1071
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,990
What did you say? Wait, wait!

1072
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:26,860
- She's unwell?
- Yes.

1073
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:30,780
- She's got fever?
- Yes, a high fever.

1074
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,220
So what are you waiting for?

1075
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,410
Why you standing here holding her
in your arms? Go! Put her down inside.

1076
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:42,970
Rajender! Call doctor
Bhatia and tell him to hurry.

1077
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,920
Why don't you call him, father?

1078
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,190
- Please call him.
- Very well.

1079
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:04,350
Hello.

1080
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,900
Hello. Who is that? Doctor?

1081
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,110
- Who brought my sister here?
- Silence!

1082
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:15,980
- Silence? Why?
- Look, Amar...

1083
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,660
lt's not what you think.

1084
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,140
No, no, l'll take her home.

1085
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,290
She won't get good
treatment over there.

1086
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,129
She will. Who treated
her when she got ill before?

1087
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:26,880
Who stayed awake through
the night then? You?

1088
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,660
- l've brought medicine.
- Amar...

1089
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:30,490
you don't understand.
She was a child before.

1090
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,960
She's an adult now.
She needs a nurse.

1091
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,900
No, no, no, no!
She's still a child to me, get it?

1092
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,860
l'll take her away with me.
l'll take her.

1093
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:44,230
She's still unconscious.
Her temperature is 104 degrees.

1094
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:49,700
She could get pneumonia.
She needs rest.

1095
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:54,570
No, no. Nobody in this world but
l can bring relief to my sister.

1096
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,760
l'll take her with me.
l'll take her with me.

1097
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:00,740
Wait, Mr. Amar. Listen to me.

1098
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,420
Mr. Rajender,
if this girl is troubled so much...

1099
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,770
in this condition,
she might not make it till morning.

1100
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:12,599
She might not make it? Bina?

1101
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:17,940
Bina... might die?

1102
01:31:19,090 --> 01:31:25,300
Just like the rest of them. No. No.

1103
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:39,349
Okay, doctor.

1104
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:38,430
- What are you doing, brother?
- l am vacating the house.

1105
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:42,440
Make some sense, brother.
Where will you go at 3:00 AM?

1106
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:45,090
Anywhere. But l must
evacuate the house by morning.

1107
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,940
What's the reason
for all the hurry?

1108
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:50,559
Reason? No reason.
l can't keep Bina here.

1109
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,460
lf l don't leave by morning...

1110
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,080
he'll come again and bother her.

1111
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,469
You're leaving over such a trivial matter?

1112
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,690
And with a patient?

1113
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:01,990
- What else can l do? Tell me.
- Are you a small child?

1114
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,750
Why are you so afraid of him?

1115
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:07,890
Moti, l'm afraid because
l might beat him in a fit of rage.

1116
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,140
And then he might die
and there'd be hell to pay.

1117
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,660
Who would look
after this girl then?

1118
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:16,320
You don't have to
go into such detail.

1119
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,570
Just pick up your luggage and
put it in my place and stay there.

1120
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,000
lf he comes asking l'll
tell him you crept away at night.

1121
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:24,420
Where, l don't know..

1122
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:28,089
He'll leave and you
can return to your house.

1123
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:31,170
That seems to be a good idea.
Let's go.

1124
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:33,130
- C'mon, pick up the luggage.
- Let's go.

1125
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,370
Do you know where Mr. Amar went?

1126
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,150
Amar left the house last night.

1127
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:11,360
But he must have left
a forwarding address.

1128
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:13,530
That's just the problem, mister.

1129
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,960
He didn't leave an address.

1130
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,980
l had only one support
and that's gone.

1131
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:26,050
- Lord knows what will
become of Bina. - You mean...

1132
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:33,740
Yes sir, they used to
give me a few rupees a month.

1133
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,190
l used to manage with that.

1134
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:39,180
What will become of me now? God!

1135
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:43,480
Look, don't worry. Four or
five rupees is no big deal. Here.

1136
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:52,160
Be happy, mister.
May you enjoy the joys of youth.

1137
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:54,230
May you have many children.

1138
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,450
Find happiness.

1139
01:35:55,690 --> 01:36:01,110
Just as you've pleased
an old widow's soul.

1140
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:11,540
Bina. Come on, Bina. Eat your food.

1141
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:14,870
No, brother.
l won't eat this stuff.

1142
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:17,570
You won't eat!
You think l cooked this for myself?

1143
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,630
What can l say? l'm not hungry.

1144
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:22,920
Why won't you admit you've
eaten at Kusum's place?

1145
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,640
What would l eat there?
l went there for worship.

1146
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:29,660
All you do is worship.
You don't talk to anyone.

1147
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,380
You don't know if
it's morning or evening.

1148
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,710
You don't eat or drink.
You sit in worship all the time.

1149
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:36,950
What's happened to
you since your recovery?

1150
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,980
- l don't know.
- lt's also okay.

1151
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,800
Don't eat if you don't want.
Even l won't eat.

1152
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:04,290
Brother Amar, what's the matter?

1153
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:06,860
For the past fifteen
days l've noticed...

1154
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,440
you've been lost in deep thought.

1155
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:12,070
By God's grace Bina has recovered.

1156
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:15,400
Recovered, like hell!
Your sister gave her another disease.

1157
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:19,540
- Kusum? - Yes, Kusum!
She taught her to worship.

1158
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:22,009
She prays every day and every night.

1159
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,330
She doesn't think of food or drink.

1160
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:27,980
She doesn't bother
combing her hair all day.

1161
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,110
She's quiet all the time.

1162
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:31,910
She doesn't laugh or have fun.

1163
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:36,710
Even you've observed her.
She doesn't have fun.

1164
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:40,000
She is not the same.
She's not the same Bina.

1165
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:42,150
God knows what she's contracted.

1166
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:45,890
That's true. That's true.
This is a very bad disease.

1167
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,560
Ask me how l know. Ask.

1168
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:49,390
Sit.

1169
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,190
My Kusum has had this disease
for the past five years.

1170
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:59,130
And she still has it.
The irony is that l know the cure.

1171
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:01,310
But poverty is a terrible malady.

1172
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:04,410
lf l don't have money to sate
the stomach, how do l get a cure?

1173
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,000
Will you tell me what the cure is?
Where can l find it?

1174
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:09,690
God knows, brother,
but there's only one remedy.

1175
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:13,070
- Get her married as
soon as possible. - What?

1176
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:16,160
Get her married?
Hand my Bina over to a stranger?

1177
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:28,740
Why are you talking like a child, brother?

1178
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:35,620
Brother, the truth is, neither
is Kusum mine nor Bina yours.

1179
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,670
Love and affection are
good during their childhood.

1180
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:43,460
Once they come of age,
they are like the bitter pill.

1181
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,040
Without marriage, there's no solution.

1182
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:54,240
lt's all a lie.
What can you or l do about it?

1183
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,580
lt was something else
when they were young.

1184
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:00,210
We could make them happy
by giving them sweets and toys.

1185
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:03,180
lf they still didn't come round,
we'd take them to the fair.

1186
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,520
They'd settle down.

1187
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:08,920
But brother,
sweets and toys won't work anymore.

1188
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:12,139
Now they're better off
in the rags their husbands provide.

1189
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,490
The finest attire their maternal
family provides isn't good enough.

1190
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,940
Brother, that's why the elders say...

1191
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,250
sons are your own wealth...

1192
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:21,970
and daughters are the wealth of another.

1193
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,690
Sure, you love Bina very
much but just bite the bullet...

1194
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,589
and get her married.
Bina is grown up now.

1195
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,520
Have you gone blind?
She's still a child!

1196
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:45,000
Bina! Bina! Bina!
Bina! Bina! Look here. Look here.

1197
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,700
l've brought you
something very nice today.

1198
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,020
Something you love.

1199
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:51,390
- What?
- l won't just give it to you.

1200
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:56,180
lt's marvelous. lt's your favorite,
but l won't show it to you.

1201
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:59,200
- l'll give it to you
on one condition. - What?

1202
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:03,679
l'll give it to you if you
laugh continuously for two minutes.

1203
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,400
Show it to me first.

1204
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,680
l'll show it to you if
you first promise to laugh.

1205
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,960
- Show it to me first.
- First promise me you'll laugh.

1206
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,379
Then you'll see it..

1207
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,210
l'll laugh if you
show it to me first.

1208
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:16,430
Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

1209
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:24,219
Look, look, look, look, look.
Your favourite item. Rouge.

1210
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:29,330
l was wondering what it was. Rouge?

1211
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,000
Rouge!

1212
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:36,910
Rouge!

1213
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:42,430
Rouge.

1214
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,860
Why? Don't you want rouge anymore?

1215
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:52,990
A few days ago you
picked my brains for rouge.

1216
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:58,509
That was different.
l'm not a child anymore.

1217
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,580
My Bina has become an old grandma.

1218
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,400
Amar. Come take a seat.

1219
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:46,490
Uncle, l wish to ask you something.

1220
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:52,140
How does one make
a grown up girl happy?

1221
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,000
That's easy. Get her married.

1222
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,010
What? Get her married!
Everyone talks about marriage.

1223
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:00,580
Uncle, did you buy your
experience at the shop?

1224
01:43:00,650 --> 01:43:03,429
Why don't you think
before you speak?

1225
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:05,480
Son, l did contemplate
before speaking.

1226
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:08,210
l have seen a lot more
of the world than you.

1227
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,400
Like hell you've seen it!
You call that good advice?

1228
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:14,110
Telling me to cut up my
heart and give it to another.

1229
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:16,800
Gouge out my own eyes
and give them to the blind.

1230
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:18,969
- Sever my head and die.
- My boy...

1231
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:21,240
the irony is, even
if you do all these things...

1232
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,240
she still won't be happy.

1233
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:26,220
That's right, uncle,
that certainly how it seems to be.

1234
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:29,360
But for god's sake, uncle,
please tell me another solution.

1235
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:32,860
Uncle, what will you
gain if l lose my Bina?

1236
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,160
Why are you advocating marriage?

1237
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:36,809
Try to understand, uncle.

1238
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:39,670
How do l take the
light out of my house...

1239
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,570
and place it another's home...

1240
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,170
and darken my house forever?

1241
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:47,350
That's true, son,
but that's the way of the world.

1242
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:50,059
- What can one do?
- What can one do?

1243
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,340
- Moti.
- Yes, brother.

1244
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:13,669
There's something l don't understand.

1245
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:15,000
Which?

1246
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,770
Either the whole world
is a fool or l'm the fool.

1247
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,780
Oh no, brother. Not you. Not you.

1248
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:26,419
The entire world is a fool.
But what's the matter?

1249
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,460
What could the matter be?

1250
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,960
Everyone l approach suggests
l get Bina married...

1251
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:32,830
swallow poison or die. That's it.

1252
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:37,140
Brother Amar,
you won't understand this way.

1253
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:41,430
Sit.

1254
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:48,610
There's one more test.
Try it and you'll know for certain.

1255
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,700
Tell me. Listen.

1256
01:44:51,790 --> 01:44:53,390
Go to Bina and tell her...

1257
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:56,469
you don't think she'll
get better this way.

1258
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,890
Apparently, she's fed up with this house.

1259
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,300
You'll marry her to anyone she likes.

1260
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,400
Just say that and remain silent.

1261
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:08,210
Watch how she gets
better the very next day.

1262
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:10,870
And if she doesn't,
you may punish me.

1263
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:22,710
Bina, l understand you're
fed up with this place.

1264
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:25,910
l can get you married
to whoever you wish.

1265
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:28,770
That way this daily
problem will be settled.

1266
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:44,970
Kusum! Kusum!

1267
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:47,340
What? What?

1268
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:52,810
- Really?
- Really.

1269
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,710
- With whomever you wish?
- Yes.

1270
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:01,010
But how do l tell him...

1271
01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:07,770
Hey Kusum, why are you moping?

1272
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:09,980
You think l'll leave you?

1273
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:14,500
My name isn't Bina if l
don't personally make you a bride.

1274
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:16,420
Where will brother go?

1275
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:24,600
l just have to fast one day.
Quit eating and brother caves in.

1276
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:46,019
l'm swirling, for l've grown up

1277
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:56,010
l'll go to my darling's home.
l'll go to my beau's home

1278
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:04,040
My heart is no longer
with my parental home

1279
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:11,880
l'm swirling, for l've grown up

1280
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:23,930
My friends and pals are married

1281
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:31,700
l am tempted

1282
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:40,110
Everything seems
forlorn without you

1283
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:47,929
l am like the divine wind

1284
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:55,660
l'm swirling, for l've grown up

1285
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:03,960
l'll go to my darling's home.
l'll go to my beau's home

1286
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:11,710
My heart is no longer
with my parental home

1287
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:19,580
l'm swirling, for l've grown up

1288
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,519
Did you see that, brother?
Do you believe it now?

1289
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:43,660
Sometimes your disciple
can come up with things...

1290
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:47,800
that would cause
the best of gurus to bow.

1291
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:54,350
Brother Amar, trust me,
girls are like little rivulets.

1292
01:48:55,700 --> 01:49:00,500
They don't find peace until
they merge with the ocean.

1293
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:04,650
Forests,
mountains, valleys and ruins...

1294
01:49:05,050 --> 01:49:08,580
they cut through, go over,
under, swirl and get ahead.

1295
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,010
They don't stop for anyone.

1296
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:16,370
They become calm the moment
they unite with the ocean.

1297
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:24,680
Moti, l could never
separate Bina from me.

1298
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,580
Then you are doomed.

1299
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:29,090
Why?

1300
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:34,960
Can't there be a way
to get Bina married...

1301
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:37,590
and still live with me?

1302
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:44,340
Brother, you want a live-in
son-in-law. That is difficult.

1303
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:50,050
Only the wealthy can
find live-in sons-in-law.

1304
01:49:50,130 --> 01:49:51,230
Really?

1305
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:54,010
Why don't l get...

1306
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,519
Bina married to you?

1307
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,200
Me?

1308
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,870
Brother. Brother.

1309
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,730
l'd rather you hit me
with the shoe fifty times...

1310
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:17,849
- but don't tease me in this way.
- l'm not teasing.

1311
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:20,990
You swear?

1312
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:26,620
But brother,
l have no source of income.

1313
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,700
- The girl will live at your house?
- Of course!

1314
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:33,919
Forgive me, brother.
That was your first condition.

1315
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,190
- l forgot.
-Pay attention to me, Moti.

1316
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,350
Bina will always stay with me.

1317
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:41,630
Certainly. Certainly.

1318
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:50,740
But brother,
please don't complain later.

1319
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:56,330
You know what my line of work is.

1320
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,349
Everything depends on god.

1321
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:03,640
Don't concern yourself with that.
l've thought that over.

1322
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:06,250
A cane works wonders.

1323
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:12,429
Okay. Okay.
lt works, it works. lt works.

1324
01:51:18,650 --> 01:51:23,070
My girl! My girl! Hurry up.

1325
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:25,900
- What is it?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1326
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:28,800
- Hurry what?
- Hurry, hurry.

1327
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:31,330
- Hurry what?
- Hurry up and make arrangements.

1328
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,700
What arrangements?
Are you leaving this house?

1329
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:35,850
- Shall l pack your things?
- l'm not leaving home.

1330
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:37,430
l'm setting up a family.

1331
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,050
- You swear?
- l swear.

1332
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:44,130
- With whom? - l won't tell
you that now. But you like her.

1333
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:47,440
- So why won't you tell me?
- Make the arrangements first.

1334
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,560
How do l make arrangements?
Where's the money?

1335
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,500
Money?

1336
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,320
Money?

1337
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:59,570
God willing, the money
will be arranged.

1338
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:01,970
You need to do something.

1339
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:03,090
What?

1340
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:05,929
Look, you perform your worship...

1341
01:52:07,070 --> 01:52:09,960
and the labor
will be my department.

1342
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:09,090
- Don't you dare move!
- Hello.

1343
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:11,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

1344
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,730
One moment, sir. Just one moment.

1345
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,720
- Why?
- Just listen to what l say, sir.

1346
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:26,690
- What? - Sir, don't you
love anyone in this world?

1347
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:28,290
- What do you mean?
-Sir....

1348
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:32,570
if you send me to prison
l'll be out of trouble.

1349
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:38,070
l'll get my daily meals.
But l have a sister.

1350
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:40,130
Younger than me.

1351
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,379
She won't have anyone
to take care of her.

1352
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:48,430
Either she'll starve to death
or she'll find a means to survive.

1353
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:54,180
Sir, you're aware there are
bigger fools than me in the world.

1354
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:57,730
They'll push the poor
thing into a life of sin.

1355
01:53:57,780 --> 01:54:01,679
Can't you manage without stealing?
Why don't you find honest work?

1356
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,120
Firstly, jobs are not
available these days.

1357
01:54:04,610 --> 01:54:06,480
And it takes a lot
of hard work to steal.

1358
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,440
But it is bad. Very bad.
Just forgive me this time.

1359
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:12,060
But how can you convince
me you won't steal again?

1360
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:14,860
Sir, l swear l left the
house today with a plan...

1361
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:17,100
not to steal ever again.

1362
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:19,960
lf l did, then god may punish me...

1363
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:22,680
by not letting
me see Kusum married.

1364
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:25,330
l am in great need of money, sir.

1365
01:54:25,450 --> 01:54:27,769
What need? You have
to get your sister married?

1366
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:30,900
No sir, l'm getting married myself.

1367
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,960
You mean there are
people in this world...

1368
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,980
who are willing to get their
daughters married to thieves?

1369
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:39,570
- Tell me his name.
- Don't ask me his name, sir.

1370
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,670
- You know the man.
- l know him?

1371
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:46,000
l knew this was your house, sir.
l recognized you on sight.

1372
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:51,550
- Then you must tell me.
- Sir, it is your friend, Mr. Amar.

1373
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:52,680
What?

1374
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:55,850
- With Bina.
- Yes.

1375
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,120
- Amar agreed?
- He said so himself.

1376
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,160
- Does Bina know?
- No.

1377
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:06,720
l saw you at their house once.
What's your name?

1378
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:12,780
- Moti.
- Moti. Listen to me, Moti.

1379
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:18,000
lf you want to get the money,
not be disgraced...

1380
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,240
and your sister
not to get in trouble...

1381
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,330
then you must refuse
this marriage instantly, or else!

1382
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:26,840
Why are you preventing
someone's settling down, sir?

1383
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:31,429
Silence! l know you don't
love Bina, nor she you.

1384
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:35,550
That's true, sir,
but she's a very pretty girl.

1385
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:38,810
l know. How much money do you need?

1386
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:43,480
Five to six hundred rupees
should be sufficient, sir.

1387
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:45,760
You will receive
six hundred rupees...

1388
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:48,480
but you must go
and turn down Mr. Amar.

1389
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:50,970
Make arrangements
to marry someone else.

1390
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:56,190
But sir, please don't
mention this to Mr. Amar.

1391
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,389
- Very well. Go.
- Okay, sir.

1392
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:03,210
- And look.
- Yes, sir.

1393
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:08,130
Don't play dirty with me. Don't make
the mistake of thinking you got away.

1394
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:11,040
Oh no, sir.
l wouldn't dare. Goodbye.

1395
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,150
- Look here.
- Yes sir.

1396
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:14,970
- You must do one more thing.
- What's that?

1397
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,509
lnform me when Mr.
Amar isn't at home.

1398
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:20,050
For sure, for sure, sir.

1399
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:23,970
He's still living in the
house where he was before. Bye.

1400
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:31,990
But sir, which way should l leave?

1401
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:34,110
My umbrella and
shoes are over there.

1402
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:36,610
- From where did you enter?
- From the window, sir.

1403
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:39,330
- Leave from the same place.
- What about the doorman, sir?

1404
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:02,710
Brother Amar, please come here.

1405
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:05,330
Look, please don't be offended.

1406
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,120
Will you tell me what it is?

1407
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:11,160
Forgive me for bothering
you so early in the morning...

1408
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:12,710
but there's a reason.

1409
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:15,120
- Will you tell me?
- Please don't be offended, brother.

1410
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:18,040
- Will you say something?
- You're offended.

1411
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:21,769
- Will you tell me or not?
- As you say, brother...

1412
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:23,530
but please don't be offended.

1413
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:27,040
- l can't marry Bina.
- What? Marry Bina...

1414
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:36,360
Brother, please don't get angry.
Listen to me first.

1415
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:39,589
l had a horrible
nightmare last night.

1416
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:43,490
Brother, l say this for
your Bina's best interest.

1417
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:46,220
Listen to me.
Last night l dreamed...

1418
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:51,030
a ghastly man was
facing me with a knife...

1419
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:55,510
and said to me,
'Moti, don't you dare marry Bina!'

1420
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,730
'She can't be happy with you.
l have matched her with another.'

1421
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:03,990
'Someone she loves.
He is a decent man.'

1422
01:58:05,070 --> 01:58:06,269
'He's rich.'

1423
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:08,580
'He can provide for
Bina all her life.'

1424
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,630
He said this and came
towards me with the knife...

1425
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:16,719
and said, 'l'm warning you,
you'd better forget about Bina...'

1426
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,490
'or l'll kill both Bina and you.'

1427
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:22,200
That's when l woke up.

1428
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:24,080
l was scared to death.

1429
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:26,769
l felt like coming
right then to tell you...

1430
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:29,160
but on second thought l
decided to wait till morning.

1431
01:58:29,210 --> 01:58:32,190
Now tell me what l should do, brother.

1432
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:35,300
Dreams aren't to be believed,
you idiot! They're lies.

1433
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:38,440
Oh no, brother.
My dreams always come true.

1434
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:42,030
l cannot marry. l once dreamed...

1435
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,620
someone would give me
four rupees and fourteen paisa.

1436
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:46,830
- That's the amount l got
the next day. - Beat it!

1437
01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:58,410
- Brother isn't at home.
- But l've come to see you.

1438
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:00,780
- You were unwell.
- Brother will be annoyed.

1439
01:59:01,190 --> 01:59:03,769
Please go!
Please go! Please go, mister.

1440
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:06,840
Please go, mister.

1441
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:13,230
l'll leave in a moment.

1442
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:15,720
Bina, l know you're upset with me...

1443
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:17,990
but l'm not at fault.

1444
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:22,630
The day your brother brought
you back from my house...

1445
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:24,950
l came here the next morning.

1446
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:29,780
The people here told me Mr.
Amar left the house at night.

1447
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:34,389
l looked all over the
city but l didn't get any news.

1448
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:36,820
Finally l gave up.

1449
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:40,270
Just yesterday l learned
you were living in this very house.

1450
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:42,870
l came to see you immediately. Bina.

1451
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:47,330
The last time l saw you,
you were unwell.

1452
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:51,680
God knows l thought
about you all the time.

1453
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:57,020
l always prayed you had recovered.

1454
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:05,880
Mister, please go.
l am still unwell. Go. Go.

1455
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:14,340
For the sake of god, please leave.
You made me unwell.

1456
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:23,940
You have been a foe.

1457
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:28,090
Why did you come the first time?

1458
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:33,550
Why did you buy
those things for me?

1459
02:00:35,610 --> 02:00:40,290
Was it so l could
see them all the time?

1460
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:45,610
So that l might give up
food and drink? Make me sad?

1461
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,300
Bina.

1462
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:03,120
Did god make you a good man
so anyone can kill you?

1463
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:07,719
What harm has Bina
ever done to you?

1464
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:10,720
Tell me.

1465
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:14,230
Tell me.
You won't say?

1466
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:30,440
l wish god would
make you a bad man.

1467
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:36,910
Be quiet, Bina.
For the love of god, be quiet.

1468
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:41,610
You don't know this,
but l am a very bad man.

1469
02:01:42,610 --> 02:01:47,929
l am a rich man, Bina.
Be quiet. Enough.

1470
02:01:49,930 --> 02:01:51,970
Brother is upset with
you for this very reason.

1471
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:57,220
l cannot do anything now.

1472
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:08,510
Brother! Brother!
Please beat me. Your Bina.

1473
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:20,290
'l have matched her with another.'

1474
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:25,080
'He is a decent man.
He's rich. Bina loves him.'

1475
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:32,230
So what am l supposed to do?

1476
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:43,840
Mister Rajender,
do you also love Bina?

1477
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,220
Bina is a very polite
and good girl in my opinion.

1478
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:51,440
A good girl! A good girl!
So you may take her away?

1479
02:02:52,650 --> 02:02:54,250
So you may take her away?

1480
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:05,809
But what can l do if
both of them love each other?

1481
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,400
My Bina has become very mature now.

1482
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:19,339
She's not a child anymore.
She's fallen in love.

1483
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,220
And why not?

1484
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:27,960
Mister Rajender is a big man,
rich, decent, good...

1485
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:30,490
and he has two cars as well.

1486
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:35,860
How does Amar get a car
for his Bina? Right, Bina?

1487
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:41,080
What kind of talk is that, brother?

1488
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:46,940
- Doesn't my sorrow bother you?
- No!

1489
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:52,070
- Brother? - Because my sorrow
doesn't bother you anymore.

1490
02:03:58,210 --> 02:04:03,440
Please leave forever, mister. Go.

1491
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:07,410
l... Go!

1492
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:22,200
Mr. Amar, l apologize.
l made a big mistake.

1493
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:56,030
Here. l don't take back
things l've given away.

1494
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:02,210
No. Brother's happiness
can only be brought back...

1495
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:05,750
by destroying these bangles.

1496
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,500
Take them.

1497
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:23,470
Mr. Rajender, l would
like Bina to marry you.

1498
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:31,099
But l don't think Bina will agree.
Ask her.

1499
02:05:41,150 --> 02:05:43,540
Oh no, Bina. Don't cry. Don't cry.

1500
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:45,889
Please forgive me.
l made a mistake.

1501
02:05:46,030 --> 02:05:48,519
C'mon, c'mon. C'mon.

1502
02:05:49,390 --> 02:05:51,780
Oh no. Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1503
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:54,300
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1504
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:57,890
No, no. No. Don't cry.

1505
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,620
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1506
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:15,560
l'm sure you're
very pleased now, sir.

1507
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:19,030
Look sir, please don't forget me.

1508
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:24,940
Please treat me to tea
prepared by Bina sometimes.

1509
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:04,120
My friend is going
to her in-laws' home today

1510
02:07:15,370 --> 02:07:18,720
She's leaving her childhood behind

1511
02:07:18,990 --> 02:07:22,760
She's severed the bonds of a lifetime

1512
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:34,020
Her dejected brother is crying

1513
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:40,200
Your eyes are red

1514
02:07:41,610 --> 02:07:44,900
My friend is going
to her in-laws' home today

1515
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:52,370
Going to her in-laws' home today

1516
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,140
Hello, your highness.

1517
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:03,160
l said, hello, your highness.

1518
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:07,710
Please respond.
l know new brides are very shy.

1519
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:09,860
Okay.

1520
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:16,370
l swear l'll make you
raise your veil today.

1521
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:18,010
So, don't talk.

1522
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:28,390
What are you doing?
Don't you dare touch my feet!

1523
02:08:28,670 --> 02:08:30,370
l won't let you touch my feet.

1524
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:33,630
You think l'm an
old fashioned man?

1525
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:36,080
- You'll make me cry even today?
- Oh no, Bina...

1526
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,759
for god's, sake please don't start crying.

1527
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:41,780
Remember, this is a two story building.

1528
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,920
l'll toss you out that window.

1529
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:48,400
Even if it means
l have to follow suit.

1530
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:50,880
- So l... - Yes, yes, touch my feet.
Touch them a thousand times.

1531
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,900
Hold it. Let me take off my shoes.

1532
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:55,550
You want to touch my feet,
not my shoes.

1533
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:57,290
Lord knows which cobbler made them.

1534
02:08:57,310 --> 02:09:02,650
He might be a capitalist,
a nationalist, bassist or Nazi.

1535
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:04,090
Who are you?

1536
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:08,300
Oh no, you touched
your face as well.

1537
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:12,330
Go on and wash your face.

1538
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:21,750
Bina, is this the vermillion
that l brought you?

1539
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:57,030
You told me to slip them
onto my bride's wrists.

1540
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,500
- Kusum?
- Drink this.

1541
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:31,850
- Why did you take the trouble?
- lt's no trouble.

1542
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,700
When leaving yesterday,
sister Bina said...

1543
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:37,450
'Kusum, please take care of my brother.'

1544
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:44,639
She told you?
Look Kusum, when you get married...

1545
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:47,700
who will you tell to
take care of your brother?

1546
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:53,660
Oh no. My brother tells
me l should get married.

1547
02:10:54,390 --> 02:10:56,350
Yes, that would be good.

1548
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,250
Apparently, you haven't slept all night.

1549
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:07,670
Yes, l couldn't fall asleep.

1550
02:11:22,650 --> 02:11:24,129
- Bina.
- Brother!

1551
02:11:24,550 --> 02:11:26,320
Bina, are you well?
- Yes, yes, brother.

1552
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:28,440
- Come, come.
- You're well.

1553
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:30,820
Oh, brother?
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1554
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:35,290
l'm glad you came, brother Amar.
She was missing you.

1555
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:39,370
Brother!

1556
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:43,070
Mr. Rajender,
l'm ashamed of myself.

1557
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:47,580
You know l'm a poor man.
l couldn't give anything to Bina.

1558
02:11:47,890 --> 02:11:52,090
Whatever little l amassed
over the years, l brought with me.

1559
02:11:53,390 --> 02:11:56,240
Brother Amar,
it is our misfortune...

1560
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:58,430
you're unwilling
to live with us.

1561
02:11:58,830 --> 02:12:02,480
Sure, l might be an outsider,
but she isn't.

1562
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:04,490
Oh no, l could never do that.

1563
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:06,770
l cannot go against my conscience.

1564
02:12:07,110 --> 02:12:11,410
Bina, you tell your brother.
He won't listen to me.

1565
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:15,710
- Brother. - Oh no, Bina.
Don't be obstinate over this.

1566
02:12:16,130 --> 02:12:18,460
You're a very good girl.
l'm very pleased with you.

1567
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:21,510
l have no problems.
l have no problems.

1568
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:23,360
Well, l'll leave now.

1569
02:12:23,610 --> 02:12:25,210
Please wait a little longer,
brother.

1570
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:28,230
Go prepare tea for your brother.

1571
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:32,400
You remembered?

1572
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,920
- Greetings, father.
- Bless you, bless you.

1573
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:50,060
- Why did you come a day early?
- lt's nothing.

1574
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:52,550
My business was concluded, so l came.

1575
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:56,480
- Anything special?
- Nothing special.

1576
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:02,519
Rajen, l killed a nine
and half foot tiger yesterday.

1577
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:03,940
Nine and half feet!

1578
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:06,840
Father, even l killed
a four and half foot tiger.

1579
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:14,830
- Who's this? - Be gentle, father.
This is your daughter-in-law.

1580
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:16,589
- Daughter-in-law?
- Yes.

1581
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:18,910
What daughter-in-law?
When did you get married?

1582
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:20,480
Where's the dowry?

1583
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,300
How much property
and cash did you get?

1584
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:27,210
The property and cash is
the same amount mother brought.

1585
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:39,390
- So, she's from a poor family?
- That's right.

1586
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Bina? Bina? Where has she gone?

1587
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:59,120
Take this. Take it. Come here.

1588
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:07,420
Come on, junior.
Eat your food. Food.

1589
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:12,139
You won't eat?
Don't eat. Even l won't eat.

1590
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:17,990
'lt's your favorite
but l won't show it to you.'

1591
02:14:18,650 --> 02:14:20,929
'l'll show it to you if
you first promise to laugh.'

1592
02:14:22,610 --> 02:14:26,540
'Look, look, look, look, look.'

1593
02:14:38,550 --> 02:14:40,450
'A good girl!
So you can take her away?'

1594
02:14:56,430 --> 02:14:59,280
Kusum, how many days
is it since Bina left?

1595
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:02,049
Four or five months.

1596
02:15:06,370 --> 02:15:09,269
To me it feels like four
or five years have passed.

1597
02:15:11,150 --> 02:15:13,490
Okay, here.
Please take your medicine.

1598
02:15:31,790 --> 02:15:32,890
Water.

1599
02:15:34,150 --> 02:15:35,250
Water.

1600
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:46,300
- More.
- Don't dring too much.

1601
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:48,860
Give it to me.

1602
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:06,519
l'm going.

1603
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:12,950
Where?

1604
02:16:15,230 --> 02:16:16,429
l'm going.

1605
02:16:16,730 --> 02:16:19,349
- Where you going in the
middle of the night? - l'm going.

1606
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,900
- But you have fever.
- Fever. Who has fever?

1607
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:26,360
Please don't go for the
sake of god. Get some sleep.

1608
02:16:26,770 --> 02:16:30,440
- No, it's too hot here.
l'm going. - Don't go!

1609
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:33,900
- Don't go.
- l'm going.

1610
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:36,070
- l'll go with you.
- 'l'll go with you.'

1611
02:16:36,950 --> 02:16:38,550
'l'll go with you.' l'm going.

1612
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:47,330
Brother! Brother Amar!

1613
02:16:48,010 --> 02:16:49,510
You got your sister married...

1614
02:16:49,530 --> 02:16:51,030
and you didn't tell me?

1615
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:54,350
Please forgive me, Pandey.
l totally forgot. Forgive me.

1616
02:16:54,379 --> 02:16:56,719
Well, l'm glad she's married.
Congratulations.

1617
02:16:57,320 --> 02:17:00,650
Congratulations?
Do you have a sister, Pandey?

1618
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:02,320
Yes brother, l have one.

1619
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:03,740
- ls she married?
- No.

1620
02:17:03,879 --> 02:17:07,099
Look, Pandey,
get her married quickly. Get it?

1621
02:17:07,469 --> 02:17:10,389
lt brings great joy.
lt brings great joy.

1622
02:17:13,549 --> 02:17:17,469
- Lala, do you have a sister?
- Why, brother?

1623
02:17:17,809 --> 02:17:20,570
- l asked if you had a sister.
- Yes, l do.

1624
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:24,700
Go get her married, get it? Go. Go!

1625
02:17:25,430 --> 02:17:28,790
Get her married, l say! Go! Go!

1626
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,020
Shamu.

1627
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:39,330
Yes mister.
What you doing here at this time?

1628
02:17:39,469 --> 02:17:42,320
- Do you have a sister?
- Yes, mister, l have one.

1629
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,940
- Have you got her married?
- Where do l get the money...

1630
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:46,699
to get her married, mister?

1631
02:17:46,889 --> 02:17:50,449
And she's been ill for
the past four or six months.

1632
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:55,000
She's been ill. May
l tell you something, Shamu?

1633
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:58,340
- Yes, mister.
- Girls are like little rivulets.

1634
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:02,700
They don't find peace until
they merge with the ocean.

1635
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:06,950
They don't find peace. Get
her married as soon as possible.

1636
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:08,490
Go! Get her married!

1637
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:26,150
God, the world
functions upside down.

1638
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,810
People bless the
corpses with death.

1639
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:36,340
Are they blind? Can't they
see l am dead? l'm finished!

1640
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:41,059
God, you bless man with love.

1641
02:18:41,690 --> 02:18:45,290
So why can't every brother
in the world love like Amar?

1642
02:18:46,969 --> 02:18:48,269
This isn't just!

1643
02:18:49,799 --> 02:18:51,609
But what do you care?

1644
02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:54,949
All you want to do
is play games. Play.

1645
02:18:55,770 --> 02:18:58,660
God, you are the
protector of the world.

1646
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:02,900
Don't be offended, but you
aren't a protector of the mind!

1647
02:19:04,330 --> 02:19:08,469
You are immortal but do
you have a sister like Bina?

1648
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:25,270
Ram! Ram!
Why are you determined to die?

1649
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:27,590
My legs have given way
looking for you all night long.

1650
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,270
l looked all over the city.
Let's go home.

1651
02:19:30,559 --> 02:19:33,219
- What do l have to go home to?
- Have some mercy, brother.

1652
02:19:33,770 --> 02:19:35,370
Come home. You have a fever.

1653
02:19:35,410 --> 02:19:36,910
No, l'll go visit Bina.

1654
02:19:37,209 --> 02:19:39,939
Ram! Ram! Look at your condition.

1655
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:43,150
- How can you walk in this condition?
- No, l'll go visit Bina.

1656
02:19:43,330 --> 02:19:46,090
- Brother...
- No! l'll go visit Bina!

1657
02:19:46,270 --> 02:19:47,990
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

1658
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:56,760
- Bina, do you recall
the day we first met? - Yes.

1659
02:19:57,150 --> 02:19:58,449
What happened, Bina?

1660
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:05,860
The gentle breeze
of spring was blowing

1661
02:20:06,110 --> 02:20:11,190
The cuckoo was cooing

1662
02:20:26,370 --> 02:20:30,110
l was playing in
a world of my own

1663
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:34,429
Laughing, singing and carefree

1664
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:38,540
Someone came to visit

1665
02:20:38,970 --> 02:20:43,070
He charmed me and planted
himself in my heart

1666
02:20:43,450 --> 02:20:44,640
And then?

1667
02:20:52,430 --> 02:21:03,120
l left my parental
home with tears in my eyes

1668
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:15,590
l came to a strange place.
l left my parental home

1669
02:21:19,970 --> 02:21:26,330
How long? For how long will
this place remain strange?

1670
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:41,310
Clouds of peace loom
over this place, my darling

1671
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:47,930
How long? For how long will
this place remain strange?

1672
02:21:54,980 --> 02:22:03,340
The bee buzzes around the buds,
kissing each stalk

1673
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:07,690
Showering pearls along every path

1674
02:22:12,210 --> 02:22:15,470
My love has arrived

1675
02:22:15,890 --> 02:22:22,050
How long? For how long will
this place remain strange?

1676
02:22:30,330 --> 02:22:33,930
Moti, let's go. Let's return.

1677
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:37,310
The rivulet has
merged with the ocean.

1678
02:22:38,650 --> 02:22:41,289
l'm very pleased. Let's go.

1679
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:47,260
She'll get upset if she sees me.
Let's return.

1680
02:22:48,670 --> 02:22:49,880
She is very happy.

1681
02:22:55,060 --> 02:22:57,850
Sister Kusum, brother is so ill...

1682
02:22:58,470 --> 02:23:00,170
and you didn't
bother to inform me?

1683
02:23:00,590 --> 02:23:02,090
What can l tell you, sister?

1684
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:05,210
He told me,
'Don't you dare inform Bina.'

1685
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:08,170
l'll create a ruckus.
l'll leave home.

1686
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:12,890
When you sent the servant,
he said to tell you he was well.

1687
02:23:13,170 --> 02:23:14,970
You could have snuck
a message to me.

1688
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:19,400
That's why l sent brother
Moti today. Here, let me wash this.

1689
02:23:19,430 --> 02:23:23,100
Oh no, l'll wash it.
What has brother done?

1690
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:24,050
God, l've committed many
sins to protect this innocent girl.

1691
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:27,590
But l can't carry this
burden any longer, my lord.

1692
02:24:29,830 --> 02:24:33,530
Please find a solution for me.

1693
02:24:35,050 --> 02:24:40,240
l am a sinner, an idiot.
l don't want anything for myself.

1694
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:46,870
But Kusum is your devotee.
Get her settled somewhere nice.

1695
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:57,970
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, brother.

1696
02:24:59,150 --> 02:25:02,830
By god's grace, brother
Amar is better.

1697
02:25:03,150 --> 02:25:05,050
l panicked when l saw
his condition the other day.

1698
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:06,930
Yes, you had reason to panic.

1699
02:25:06,950 --> 02:25:08,730
And you did a lot
of running around.

1700
02:25:08,990 --> 02:25:11,310
And for a rich man like you
to put up in a house like this...

1701
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:13,860
for six or seven days is amazing.

1702
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:17,080
- What's so amazing about it?
- That's very generous of you, sir.

1703
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:21,740
Sir, please don't be offended
but you've forgotten your word.

1704
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:24,130
What? l don't understand.

1705
02:25:24,230 --> 02:25:29,939
Let me explain. Look sir,
you had your way but the money...

1706
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:33,630
l completely forgot, brother.
You can have it any time you like.

1707
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:36,750
Can't we amend this deal?

1708
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:38,350
- How?
- l don't want money.

1709
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:42,430
- Well?
- Look sir, your problem is solved.

1710
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:44,590
Now you do something for me.

1711
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:49,010
Tell Bina to push
Amar into marrying Kusum.

1712
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:51,349
He could never refuse Bina.

1713
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:55,570
You don't need to tell me this,
brother. l'm aware of it myself.

1714
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:59,480
- Here.
- Take it, sir. Take it.

1715
02:26:07,190 --> 02:26:08,970
Don't take the trouble now, sir.

1716
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:11,660
And we'll talk about
the money later.

1717
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:14,430
Brother, you didn't inform
me about your illness.

1718
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:17,070
Tell me,
if Kusum hadn't been here then...

1719
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:20,039
what would become of you?
But you won't admit it.

1720
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:22,890
Why wouldn't l admit it?
l'm very grateful to Kusum.

1721
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:25,519
What's the point
of simply admitting it?

1722
02:26:25,980 --> 02:26:29,529
lf you admit it... Why are
you eavesdropping on us? Go.

1723
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:43,210
Brother, a house seems
horrible without a woman.

1724
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:47,070
- Get married now.
- No, l won't get married.

1725
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:49,940
Then how will you
return the favor?

1726
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:52,130
ls that the only way
to return the favor?

1727
02:26:52,650 --> 02:26:57,810
You don't know this, brother,
but she loves you very much.

1728
02:26:57,970 --> 02:27:00,650
- But l don't.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

1729
02:27:00,670 --> 02:27:02,370
ls this how you return her favor?

1730
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,760
l'm not claiming to be her foe.

1731
02:27:05,110 --> 02:27:10,090
Foe or not, l would be happy
if you got married to Kusum.

1732
02:27:11,870 --> 02:27:15,480
Look brother,
she's a very simple girl.

1733
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:20,180
God will bless you if you marry her.

1734
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:23,210
And l'm in great
need of a sister-in-law.

1735
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:27,150
- But...
- No ifs and buts. You must.

1736
02:27:27,490 --> 02:27:30,760
And if you delay,
l'll be very upset with you.

1737
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:33,179
What will you do if you're upset?

1738
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:36,050
The same old ploy. Hunger strike.

1739
02:27:36,990 --> 02:27:39,110
And l'll send a
messenger to tell you...

1740
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:42,359
'lt's been three
days since Bina has eaten.'

1741
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:45,420
'lt's been four days
since Bina has eaten.'

1742
02:27:46,110 --> 02:27:50,310
'She's getting weaker.
Her face is ashen.'

1743
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:52,840
She's unable to
get up from the bed.

1744
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:54,880
'The doctors are distressed.'

1745
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:57,420
'They say if Bina doesn't eat
for another two or three days...'

1746
02:27:57,440 --> 02:28:00,570
Enough, Bina.
Enough. Be quiet. Be quiet.

1747
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:03,880
l'll get married.
l'll get married.

1748
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:29,009
Sing cuckoo, sing.
Sing a sweet song, cuckoo

1749
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:45,210
Open the door to my heart

1750
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:53,550
Sing cuckoo, sing.
Sing a sweet song, cuckoo.

1751
02:28:53,770 --> 02:29:03,820
Sing a sweet song, cuckoo.
Sing cuckoo, sing

1752
02:29:07,590 --> 02:29:10,290
Coming. Someone is coming...

1753
02:29:10,430 --> 02:29:13,380
bringing a new message

1754
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:23,010
Tell me how to love

1755
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:30,980
Teach me the words of love

1756
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:36,640
Sing cuckoo, sing.
Sing a sweet song, cuckoo

1757
02:29:50,070 --> 02:29:51,570
What are you sucking, Bina?

1758
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:54,580
Lemon.

1759
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:56,980
Have you lost your mind?
Doesn't it taste tart?

1760
02:29:58,140 --> 02:30:00,800
lt tastes good.

1761
02:30:02,170 --> 02:30:04,550
Thank god you didn't
eat mud or coal.

1762
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:13,970
- Where is my Bina?
- Don't panic. Everything is okay.

1763
02:30:14,190 --> 02:30:16,610
- Where is she?
- Come, come. Come, come.

1764
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:20,220
- Why are all these people so quiet?
- lt's nothing. Come this way. Come.

1765
02:30:20,490 --> 02:30:21,890
Why are they quiet?

1766
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:46,539
- What's going on?
- Lord knows. lt's her first child.

1767
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:49,770
- God help her.
- Her life seems to be in danger.

1768
02:30:49,950 --> 02:30:51,850
- That's what l think, too.
- Yes.

1769
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:54,440
What did you say? My Bina!

1770
02:30:54,550 --> 02:30:56,150
Where is she?
l must see her!

1771
02:30:56,170 --> 02:30:57,570
- Where is she?
- Brother.

1772
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:00,430
l want to see my Bina.
Let go off me! Let me go!

1773
02:31:00,450 --> 02:31:02,150
Let go!
l want to see Bina!

1774
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:04,750
l want to see my Bina!
l want to see my Bina!

1775
02:31:04,780 --> 02:31:07,710
- Let go of me!
- Brother!

1776
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:14,140
Let go of me! Let go of me!
l want to see my Bina!

1777
02:31:14,790 --> 02:31:15,890
Boy!

1778
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:24,220
lt's a boy! A boy.

1779
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:29,040
- lt's a boy.
- Hold it, sister.

1780
02:32:00,530 --> 02:32:02,430
- Bina...
- Wait there, wait there.

1781
02:32:39,830 --> 02:32:41,230
You are blessed, god!

1782
02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:54,820
Take this, son. Take it. Take it.
