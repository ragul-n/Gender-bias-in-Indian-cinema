2
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,000
So, how are you?
- Great!

3
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,450
How are you?
- Great!

4
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,820
She is very mischievous.

5
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,220
Shreya, don't fool around.
Put it down.

6
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,090
Dear, put it down.

7
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,670
Greetings!

8
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,550
Shruti, go and check if
Sneha has slept or not.

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,140
Dear, this belongs to God.

10
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,010
Mom!
- Hold on, dear.

11
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,050
Listen, put less salt in food.

12
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,680
We can add it later.
- Listen,

13
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,600
put less salt in food.

14
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,260
We can add it later.
- Sure.

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,480
Drama queen! Oh!

16
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,090
Mom's earrings!

17
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,210
My pretty girl.

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,230
Go outside and play,
not in the kitchen.

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,280
Malhar, let's play hide and seek.

20
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Not now. I have to play the tabla.

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,470
She is here.
Now I'll take your leave.

22
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,540
See you.
I'll come for the wedding.

23
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,630
Look who's here.

24
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,380
Uncle, let's play hide and seek.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,060
Sure, let's play it.

26
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,810
You go and hide and
I'll find you, okay.

27
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,120
You won't be able to find me.
- I'll find you, you'll see. Ready?

28
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,650
'One!'

29
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,350
I will tell mom about this.

30
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,110
So, having fun on your own?

31
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,270
I'll also take a snap.
Come, everyone! It's selfie time!

32
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,010
Selfie?
- Yes. - Shreya! Shruti!

33
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,650
Come, mom.
- Come quickly!

34
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,880
Come over here. Come.

35
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,010
Come closer.
- Take mine too. - Of course.

36
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,730
Master. - Malhar, go and please get
Shreya and Shruti. - Where are they?

37
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,090
Take at least one. - Go on.
- Go and see if they're sleeping.

38
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,600
Go, quickly get them.
- Get them fast!

39
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,110
Mom, stand in the middle.

40
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,870
What are you doing here?
- I'm making rangoli.

41
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,240
Have you seen Shreya?
- No.

42
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,010
Malhar, when will Sneha wake up?

43
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,890
Emotion? I see.
- You liked my tea till yesterday.

44
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,090
Shruti is making rangoli
and Shreya is nowhere.

45
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,430
Meaning?
- What do you mean, nowhere?

46
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,550
Have you checked properly?
- Of course.

47
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,590
Uncle is also not present
upstairs. - I'll check.

48
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,230
Shreya!

49
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,080
Shreya! Shreya!
- Shreya.

50
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,410
Shreya! - Check over there. Mom,
stay here! - I'll also come. - No!

51
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,320
She was playing here. Shreya!

52
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,630
'Shreya! Mother, stay with Sneha.
- Shreya! - Where did she go?'

53
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,090
'Malhar, have you checked property?
- Shreya! - Shreya!'

54
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
'Shreya!
- Shreya!'

55
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,000
'Shreya!'

56
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,730
'Shreya!'

57
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,510
'I'm very scared, Amit.
- Shreya!'

58
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,530
Shreya!
- Son, take the car.

59
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,370
Sit.

60
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,040
You go inside.

61
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,370
I will call you. Okay?

62
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
Sit tight.

63
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,260
Amit.

64
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,100
Police haven't found anything yet.

65
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,870
Amit!

66
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,460
Amit!

67
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,110
Amit!

68
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,570
Amit! Amit!

69
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,700
Amit!

70
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,810
'Amit! Amit!'

71
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,130
'Amit!'

72
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,130
Amit!

73
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,590
'Malhar, let's play
hide and seek.'

74
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,970
'Not now. I have to
play the tabla.'

75
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,590
Why did you move the corpse?

76
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,100
It's a crime scene.
You've tampered with it.

77
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,370
Do you have enmity with anyone?

78
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,240
A tiff?

79
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,560
Sir, a neighbour.

80
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,240
Who is it?

81
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,220
Anthony.

82
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,430
'One! Two!'

83
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,160
'Three! Four!'

84
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,730
'Five! Six!
- Jackie.'

85
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,050
Seven! Eight! Nine!

86
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,200
Jackie!
- Ready or not, here I come.

87
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,840
Hey, hide and seek!

88
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,220
Come here!

89
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,720
Come here!

90
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,340
Where is Malhar?
- Uncle, I don't know.

91
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,930
What do you mean?
Your brother's taken my dog.

92
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,850
He stole it.

93
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Next time I catch him,
I'll break his very legs.

94
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,670
Hey! Where are you going?

95
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,400
Hey! I'm talking to you!

96
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,360
Millennials!

97
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,470
Jackie! Come on, man!

98
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,450
Jackie!

99
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,260
Jackie!

100
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,780
Who is your friend?

101
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,990
Is it uncle Anthony or me?

102
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,560
Jackie, jump! Jackie!

103
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,950
That fool!

104
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,370
He lives here,
but he is loyal to them.

105
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,800
It's okay, dear.

106
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,490
He is my dog,
he should play with me.

107
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,280
Okay, shush!
- You can see ghosts, right?

108
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,770
How do they look?

109
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,460
Dad says they lie here.

110
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,840
They're devoid of any tension.

111
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,490
Everyday is Sunday for them.

112
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,120
You remember the plan, right?

113
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,480
I will throw the ball

114
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,930
and you go running
towards uncle Anthony.

115
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,080
Come on, Jackie!

116
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,320
It's not a good time
to get tired.

117
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,700
You've got me in trouble.

118
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,000
You got tired after
playing with him, right?

119
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,170
No, uncle. I found him
on the road

120
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,650
so I brought him to you.

121
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,120
Jackie, go.
- Jackie, go.

122
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
That's nonsense!

123
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,790
Careful, man!

124
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,000
This is your ball, right?

125
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,580
Say, yes.

126
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,540
Next time if I'll catch you,
I'll break your legs.

127
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,800
I'll teach you a lesson!

128
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,510
Uncle, please don't hit him!

129
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,640
Get your own dog then.

130
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,850
"Don't hit him." Get out!

131
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,700
Come on home.

132
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,470
Do you think you're an explorer?

133
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,230
Loitering here and there.
Jackie is found.

134
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,120
It's that neighbor's kid.

135
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,690
'Malhar!'

136
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,560
'Malhar!'

137
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,330
'Malhar!'

138
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,210
'Malhar!'

139
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,940
'Malhar!'

140
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,380
Where is Malhar?

141
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,510
Where is he?

142
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,850
Look, Anthony.
I'm sorry for your loss. - Sorry?

143
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,700
Malhar hit him with a rock.

144
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,030
It could be an accident.
- Nonsense!

145
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,230
It's not an accident.
- Hey!

146
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,740
Anthony, don't blame Malhar.

147
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,790
Ras... No.

148
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,570
Come.

149
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,990
Come. Get inside.

150
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,830
Calm down.

151
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,030
He was like a child to me.

152
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,030
Malhar was at home.
- It's not fair, Amit.

153
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,900
It's not fair.

154
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,290
Come, Anthony. Come.

155
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,500
No, Sophie! I won't forget this.

156
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,810
They will pay for this.

157
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,410
'Sir, he was jealous.'

158
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,770
'Jackie was close to Malhar.'

159
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,630
'So he thinks, '

160
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,040
'my son killed his dog.'

161
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,230
'His dog got killed,
so he killed your daughter.'

162
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,730
Don't tell me such stories.

163
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,920
Tell me the fact.
- It's a fact.

164
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,070
His dog, Jackie...
- Who all are in the family?

165
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,930
I have two daughters,
Shruti and Sneha,

166
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,410
my wife, my mother,

167
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,760
Malhar,

168
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,500
Ajay and...

169
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,830
Shreya.

170
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,560
Who is Ajay?

171
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,930
He is my younger brother.
- Where is he now?

172
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,930
Sign the partition
papers of the house.

173
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,130
Ajay, I told you many times.

174
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,760
The house won't be partitioned
as long as I'm alive.

175
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,070
Why not?

176
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,700
Isn't this my house? Or do you
want to give everything to Amit?

177
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,660
'Have you no shame?'

178
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,130
'Your brother built all
this using one taxi.'

179
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,870
'With one taxi.
- Mom, it was dad's taxi.'

180
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,010
'If dad was alive,
I wouldn't be jobless.'

181
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,200
Just go away and die.

182
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,250
I'll die with all of you,

183
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,090
not alone.
- You deserve to rot in jail.

184
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,720
'So what if I had been jailed?'

185
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,900
Renowned freedom
fighters had been jailed.

186
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,590
Well, they weren't jailed
for smuggling, Ajay.

187
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,530
Mom!

188
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,950
Don't change the topic.

189
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,950
Give me my share
of this property.

190
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,390
Then you pamper your favourite
son all you want. - Be quiet!

191
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,430
It's not your jailhouse.

192
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,880
First learn how to talk
to your elders. Get lost!

193
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,510
Amit...
- Get out!

194
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,380
Get out!

195
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,030
Where are his manners while
throwing slippers at me?

196
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,950
And he thinks,
he has all the manners.

197
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,200
As if I was born in the gutter.

198
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,290
Malhar, you never
complete your homework!

199
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,560
Hey, master!

200
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,140
Who will do the homework then?

201
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,470
Come on!
- Dad's pet.

202
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,980
Mom, dad hit uncle with slippers.

203
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,100
I'll get brown bread for you
from the market.

204
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,130
Well, you have your diet chart

205
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,090
to follow at dinner.
- Yes.

206
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,530
Yes, there's the bakery.

207
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,030
Mom, you go on.
I forgot my card.

208
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,450
Okay, fine. I'll go.
- Okay.

209
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,440
Have you gone crazy?

210
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,110
Is it my imagination

211
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,960
or have you really
become so beautiful?

212
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,550
I will slap you.

213
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,520
Leave. Meet me at the same
place in the evening.

214
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,550
At what time?
- Heena!

215
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,720
I said, leave! Rascal!

216
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,600
He was stalking me.

217
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,410
Boo!
- Oh!

218
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,670
You were acting
so brave in the morning!

219
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,730
I still am.

220
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,950
Careful!

221
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,610
Don't become a fool while
trying to become brave.

222
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,090
This fool will take you away.

223
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,090
You should hurry then.

224
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,980
Otherwise my parents
will get me married.

225
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,110
Don't worry. Today, I
created a scene at home.

226
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,940
Is it?
- Yes.

227
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,250
Oh, man!

228
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,840
'Sir, Ajay only wants
a share in this house.'

229
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,180
'But he is not concerned
about this family.'

230
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,420
'He just fools around
and gets drunk.'

231
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,260
You suspect others.

232
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,390
But the truth is,
you've moved the body.

233
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Why?

234
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,310
'All right. Shreya and
Shruti went to sleep.'

235
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,540
'You both also go to sleep.
It's 10:30 p.m.'

236
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,760
Mom...
- What, mom?

237
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,860
And you! Tomorrow, you will
get a haircut, understood?

238
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,530
Let it be.

239
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,100
He looks like Zakir and plays
the instrument like him too.

240
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,540
Right?
- Dad.

241
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,030
How do I look?

242
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,530
Do I look like you or like mom?

243
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,640
Hey! Shreya is asking
something, Amit.

244
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,190
Dear, you look like me. Okay?

245
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,670
Come on, now.
Both of you into bed.

246
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,390
Good night, dad!

247
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,520
Good night, master!
- Good night!

248
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,270
Amit, don't do this.

249
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,710
She is our daughter.

250
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,590
Ours?
- Of course, yes!

251
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,470
What do you mean?

252
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,840
Haven't you come to
your senses yet?

253
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,410
Bhavna, not now, okay?

254
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,730
Why? Why not?

255
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,070
You take pride in
being Malhar's dad.

256
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,090
Do you think Shruti and Shreya
don't understand anything?

257
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,610
They're no longer little.
You're hurting them.

258
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,030
It's not like I don't care
about them, okay? - Wow!

259
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,590
I know it's not their fault.

260
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,180
It's not their fault?

261
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,570
'It's not their fault?'

262
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,650
You're talking about the kids,
they might hear you.

263
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,030
Let them hear then.

264
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,010
They should know how their dad is.

265
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,180
God!
- I still love you.

266
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,750
But...
- But?

267
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,440
But what?

268
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,910
Say it! Say it!

269
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,310
'Say it!'
- Why is mom fighting?

270
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,320
'This is not the first time.'
- I will tell you.

271
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,120
One night

272
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,630
a woman from the cemetery

273
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,330
poisoned mom's ears.

274
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,250
A woman?
- Yes.

275
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,470
She was a beautiful woman.

276
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,160
But she was bald.

277
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,980
Then she started
caressing mom's tresses

278
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,590
with her long hands.

279
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,100
She wanted mom's hair.

280
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,360
When she was about
to pull mom's hair,

281
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,160
she noticed me.

282
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,770
She stepped towards me.

283
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,760
She came close.

284
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,360
Closer.

285
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,620
Closer and then!
- Mom, look at him!

286
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,870
Malhar!

287
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,330
Mom, Malhar is scaring me.

288
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,450
I've told you many times,
not to scare the kids.

289
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,580
Is that how elder brothers
should behave? - Sorry, mom!

290
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,930
"Sorry, mom!"

291
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,270
Now go to bed!

292
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,020
Say.

293
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,570
Unload. Unload it.

294
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,410
Bye, dad! I'm leaving.
- Bye!

295
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,530
Come on, hurry up!

296
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,070
You get down from the tree!

297
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,590
Three! Four! Five!

298
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,560
Six! Seven!

299
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,390
Eight! Nine! Ten!

300
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,400
Ready or not, here I come!

301
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,520
Sir.

302
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,480
Sir, there's a problem.

303
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,220
The kid's mom is refusing
to give the body.

304
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,050
My Shreya looks so pretty

305
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,010
in my earrings.

306
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,120
'Mom!
- Hold on, dear!'

307
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,720
'Listen, put less salt in food.'

308
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,840
'We can add it later.'

309
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,620
'Put less salt in food.'

310
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,030
'We can add it later.'

311
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,740
'Drama queen!'

312
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,750
'Oh! Mom's earrings!'

313
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,100
'My pretty girl.'

314
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,100
'Go outside and play,
not in the kitchen.'

315
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,370
Hush.

316
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,880
Police is waiting outside.

317
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,690
We need to hand over the body.

318
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,390
No! No!
- Bhavna, dear.

319
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,220
No! No!
- Bhavna...

320
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,780
No!
- Dear!

321
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,700
Dear, don't do this!
- No! No!

322
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,480
Dear!

323
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,550
No! Let go of me!

324
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,710
No!
- Dear...

325
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
Mom, where is Shreya?

326
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,760
Do you hear me? Mom!

327
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,850
Shreya's breakfast
is getting cold.

328
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,190
'My darlings!'

329
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,020
'Dad, how do I look?'

330
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,570
Like you or like mom?

331
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,410
Sir, please write
Shreya's full name here.

332
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,410
Why did you run?

333
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,010
Sir, I got scared.

334
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,300
Sir, I don't wish to go to jail
again. I'm innocent this time.

335
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,910
We will decide that.

336
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,730
Bring Anthony with him too.
- S-Sir!

337
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,820
What did I say, sir?

338
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,180
Shreya!

339
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,110
No...

340
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,990
Oh!

341
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,590
Oh, man.

342
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,870
If you do all this here now,
then what will you do inside?

343
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,270
Can I come in, sir?
- Come in.

344
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,010
Sir, I'm, Heena.

345
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,860
Heena Desai.
- I know you.

346
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,960
Aren't you Mr. Desai's daughter?
- Yes, sir.

347
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,850
Please sit.
- Thank you, sir.

348
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,010
Tell me, how can I help you?

349
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,870
Sir, I'm here for Ajay.

350
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,640
Sir, he is absolutely innocent.

351
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,170
That night he was with me.

352
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,150
With you?

353
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,940
What was he doing?

354
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,630
'As we met after a long time.
So we were catching up.'

355
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,390
'Come, uncle.
Let's play hide and seek.'

356
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,700
'Oh! Come on. Let's play.'

357
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,010
'You go and hide, I will find you.
Okay?'

358
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,530
'You won't find me.
- I will find you. Ready?'

359
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,160
'One!'

360
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,020
'We thought everyone would be busy
in the veneration of Janmashtami.'

361
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,360
'So we'll get some privacy.'

362
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,530
'In fact,
when I went into Ajay's room'

363
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,550
'Shreya was running
outside to hide.'

364
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,130
'After that, Ajay was with me.'

365
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,280
'It's a nice story.'

366
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,620
You were catching up.

367
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,060
So, he should have
met your family too.

368
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,470
Do you want me to find out?
- Go ahead.

369
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,780
I will stick to my statement
that he was with me.

370
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,860
'This is done by a family member.'

371
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,650
'For now, let's nab
their neighbor.'

372
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,020
'Keep an eye on Amit too.'

373
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,000
How are you?

374
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,550
Fine, sir.

375
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,890
Sit straight.

376
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,380
Otherwise it will
hurt your back.

377
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,430
What is your name?

378
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,070
Anthony.
- Anthony!

379
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,700
You must love bread, right?

380
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,070
Since you have come last
night, you must be hungry.

381
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,100
Jethwa.
- Sir.

382
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,770
What kind of a man are you?
Do you treat your guest like that?

383
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,690
Give him something.

384
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,550
Have something.

385
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,260
Open your mouth.

386
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,200
Sir?
- Have.

387
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,600
They're fresh.

388
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,190
Sir.

389
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,150
Why did you murder?

390
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,300
Sir! I didn't murder.

391
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,360
Sir, he killed my dog.

392
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,840
Because he killed your dog,
you will kill his children?

393
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,270
N-No, sir! I didn't kill anyone.

394
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,300
He is framing me in this.

395
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,480
'But according to father'

396
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,060
'you were in the
graveyard that night.'

397
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,170
'Yes, sir! I was there.'

398
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,870
'Sophia was with me too.'

399
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,500
'And I met Shreya too.'

400
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,060
'Oh, hide and seek! Come here!'

401
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,260
'But, sir...'

402
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,770
'Sir! I just asked'

403
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,180
'her to hide.'

404
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,170
'What are you doing here?'

405
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,430
'Hide and seek.'

406
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,590
'Go there and hide.'

407
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,300
'Go! Nobody will catch you!'

408
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,970
'And I'm here, okay?'

409
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,850
'After that we had to go
out of town urgently.'

410
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,780
'So I completely
forgot about Shreya.'

411
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,720
What would I get by
killing that little girl?

412
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,610
Okay. You are asking
questions to me now?

413
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,770
Jethwa, I think sir
is still hungry.

414
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,380
He can't think it seems.
Please feed him. - No.

415
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,780
No! No, sir! Please don't!

416
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,680
No! No, sir!
- Feed him till he

417
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,250
doesn't speak the truth.

418
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
No, sir!

419
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,740
Shruti...

420
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,720
Sir, don't hit me!

421
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,190
Do you need property?

422
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,620
No!

423
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,220
Your brother told me everything.

424
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,240
No, sir.

425
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,040
You want to get married?

426
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,170
Who will you marry?

427
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,810
Your girlfriend got married

428
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,540
to some engineer.

429
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,050
I was invited too.

430
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,770
But I couldn't go
because of you.

431
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,260
Tell me.

432
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,100
Else, you will rot

433
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,080
here for life with that stick.

434
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,790
Fine?

435
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,010
How many times will you clean?

436
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,260
I will have to clean it, mother.

437
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,020
I will have to clean it.

438
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,170
Look it's completely
red out here.

439
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,670
The floor.

440
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,780
I will have to clean.

441
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,760
I'll go and bathe Sneha.

442
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,120
Her hot water is ready.

443
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,070
Oh, mother! I will bathe her!
- Come!

444
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,070
Come to me, my child.

445
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,710
Oh, dear!

446
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,200
Mom will bathe her baby.

447
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,090
Ouch!
- Grandma!

448
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,180
Bhavna!

449
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,440
Oh, mother!
- Malhar, hold her!

450
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Sneha!
- Sorry, mother!

451
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,160
Are you fine?

452
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,740
Please get up!
- Oh!

453
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,300
Come with me.

454
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,040
Oh my dear.

455
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,260
Why did you pick it up?
I would have done it.

456
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,510
Oh, dear!

457
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,080
"Water! Whoosh!"

458
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,070
"Water! Whoosh!"

459
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,100
"Water! Whoosh!"

460
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,170
"Water! Whoosh!"

461
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,080
"Water! Whoosh!"
- Hey!

462
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,410
Hey, what are you doing?

463
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,520
Dad, grandma fell down so

464
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,160
mom handed her to me.

465
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,820
I was just giving her a bath.

466
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,390
But like this?

467
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,020
Are you mad?
Bhavna!

468
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,520
Mom!

469
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,940
What happened to you, dad?

470
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,300
Dad, what is wrong with you?

471
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,340
Dad...

472
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,920
Dad, is this a game?
Dad, which game is this?

473
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,380
Dad!

474
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,990
Dad, what are you doing?

475
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,920
Mom!

476
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,170
Should I drop you there?

477
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,440
Should I drop you down?

478
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,250
You did the same with
Shruti, didn't you?

479
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,820
No!

480
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,350
Shut up! Quiet!

481
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,100
Quiet!

482
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,230
Quiet!
- What is happening, Amit?

483
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,450
Amit!
- It's nothing!

484
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,950
Quiet!

485
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,380
No!

486
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,970
No...

487
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,280
You were trying to
drown Sneha, right?

488
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,800
I was giving her a bath. No!

489
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,660
You were trying to
drown her, right? - No!

490
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,040
Yes, I was trying to drown her!

491
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,590
What about Shruti and Shreya?

492
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,870
Shruti and Shreya.

493
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,720
No! Don't beat me! - Why did
you kill Shruti and Shreya?

494
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
Why did you kill Shruti and Shreya?
- I killed them! - What?

495
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,180
I accept! I killed them!

496
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,930
I killed them both!

497
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,910
They weren't my sisters, right?

498
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,940
You used to fight with mom.

499
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,630
Dad! Dad, are you fine?

500
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,020
Dad!

501
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,510
Dad, are you fine?

502
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,020
Dad...

503
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,380
G-G-G-Graveyard?

504
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,550
In the g-graveyard?

505
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,450
Yes! We were
playing hide and seek.

506
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,360
We went into the
graveyard while playing.

507
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,750
It was you who told me

508
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,570
that nobody hides there.

509
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,130
Everybody sleeps over
there, right?

510
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,940
Therefore, I put her to sleep.

511
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,880
And it was me who
killed Jackie too.

512
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,420
S-stone!

513
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,170
Did you use a stone to kill him?

514
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,870
Yes, I killed him
with the stone.

515
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,470
Yes, I did.
- And Shruti?

516
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,700
Did you not see she had fallen?

517
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,100
Dad! Dad, are you fine?

518
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,830
Dad! Nothing should happen to you.

519
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,310
Dad, I'm there for you. I won't
let anything happen to you.

520
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,780
Dad! Dad!

521
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,690
Dad! Dad, I will not let
anything happen to you.

522
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,390
Dad! Dad, are you fine?

523
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,660
Dad! Dad, are you fine?

524
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,850
Dad! Dad, are you fine?

525
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,780
Dad! Dad, I won't let
anything happen to you.

526
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,210
Dad...

527
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,360
He did it.

528
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,690
He killed them.

529
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,620
He will kill everyone.

530
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,890
He is dangerous.

531
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,500
The keys to the store room.

532
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,860
I have packed all the
kitchen utensils

533
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,700
...and locked them away
in the store room.

534
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,890
Don't give this key to anyone, mom.

535
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,060
Son, may I ask you something?

536
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,630
Do you think that Ajay
has killed the girls?

537
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,260
Do you?

538
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,840
Don't give these keys to
anyone, mom.

539
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,040
I didn't kill the children.

540
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,490
I'm telling you the truth.

541
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,520
Are you fine?

542
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,420
Zakir...

543
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,110
How are your tabla
sessions going on?

544
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,230
Do you remember?

545
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,990
We used to sing in our school.

546
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,220
"We shall overcome,"

547
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,220
"We shall overcome,"

548
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,970
"We shall overcome,"

549
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,300
"Someday."

550
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,580
Where are you heading to?

551
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,970
I'm going to sleep.

552
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,940
From now, you'll sleep with me.

553
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,260
Dad.

554
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,170
Amit.
- Hello, father.

555
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,590
You know well what's

556
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,930
happening at our home.

557
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,380
Can you please

558
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,280
bless him?

559
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,750
Of course, my son.

560
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,680
Amen.

561
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,650
Thank you, father!

562
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,940
Thank you!

563
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,320
Bless you.

564
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,440
Thanks.

565
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,870
Amit! See how he got injured!

566
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,300
I will bring
medicines right away!

567
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,090
Dad, I'm injured.

568
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,570
How will I become Zakir now?

569
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,890
It's mere an injury.

570
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,340
You won't die.

571
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:27,780
Have some milk.

572
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,020
Have it my child.

573
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,780
No, my child.

574
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,700
You sit, I'll check.
- Mother, I'll check.

575
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,230
I will have a check.

576
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,010
Where is Amit?

577
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,070
He's himself unaware about that.

578
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,030
May we come in?

579
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,100
Please come in.

580
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
Sorry!

581
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,180
So much has happened
to you people

582
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,850
and we...

583
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:56,810
See.

584
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,410
Let bygones be bygones.

585
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,230
What I mean to say

586
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,770
is that I'm there.

587
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,300
I'm so sorry.

588
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,220
Son, don't make noise.

589
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,720
Listen, son.

590
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,140
Please go out and play.

591
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:32,910
Go.
- Come, let's go.

592
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,980
Come at once!

593
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,490
'Bhavna, please control yourself.
Come on.'

594
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,550
Come up with me.

595
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,450
Yeah.

596
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,980
Yeah.

597
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,350
Malhar's tabla has improved, right?

598
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,250
Where?
- What?

599
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,970
What?
- Where is Malhar?

600
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,660
Malhar!

601
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,360
Hey, he is inside. Amit!

602
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,530
Where is Malhar?

603
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,510
He must be playing
outside with Roshan.

604
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:46,760
What's wrong?

605
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,140
Malhar!

606
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,790
Malhar!

607
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,200
Malhar!

608
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,410
Where is he?

609
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,870
Dad, he wanted to use the washroom.

610
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,500
Thank you! Thank you for coming.

611
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,740
Amit?
- Take care of your son!

612
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,570
Come on! Let's go!

613
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:26,880
Do not go near to the kids!

614
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,230
You!

615
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,830
I will thrash you!
Is that clear?

616
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,340
What, Amit?
He was taking care of the child.

617
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,720
What is wrong with you, Amit?

618
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,290
Sorry.

619
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,890
Mom, I will hold it!

620
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,560
Will you be able to hold it?

621
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,400
Are you sure?
- Yes.

622
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,650
Thank you, my son!

623
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,290
You're a strong boy!

624
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,220
Be careful!

625
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,140
And listen! Tell Roshan...

626
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,390
Tell Roshan
I'll video call him later.

627
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,760
'Okay! Drive safe!'

628
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,440
Roshan, dear!
Please play with your toys today.

629
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,880
Mom is very busy.

630
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,130
Roshan!

631
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,500
'Oh! He killed my son Roshan!'

632
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,590
'Help!'

633
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,810
'Quick!'

634
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,520
What happened?
- Killed my son.

635
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,080
My son, Roshan has been killed.
- 'What happened?' - Come here!

636
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,730
Come at once!

637
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,850
'What happened?'
- Someone killed my son!'

638
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:28,880
He has killed my Roshan!
- Call the police!

639
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,210
Roshan!

640
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,480
Sophia!

641
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,090
Sophia!
- Sophia!

642
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,580
Wow, master!

643
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,730
Is your practice going well?

644
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,400
It's going well.

645
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:38,970
Did you hear?

646
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,900
I've been listening for a while.

647
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,740
Come! Come to your dad.

648
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,500
Come.

649
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,630
What has happened to you, dad?

650
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,040
Dad is exhausted.

651
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:21,720
Why don't you sleep then?

652
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,130
No.

653
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,870
I can't sleep.

654
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,040
Is it because I
urinate on the bed?

655
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,200
No.

656
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,670
Because you don't get exhausted.
That's why.

657
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,580
Why don't you sleep?

658
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,200
After sleeping

659
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,140
life becomes more beautiful.

660
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,580
Isn't it?
- Yes, dad.

661
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,410
Every day is a holiday.
- Yeah.

662
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,090
Oh, Sunday.

663
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,730
Did you play cricket today?

664
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,660
Yes.

665
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,270
How many runs did you score?

666
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,510
118.
- How many wickets?

667
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,310
Three.

668
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,700
Well done.

669
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,210
Tie it there.

670
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:00,300
Go.

671
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,820
You...

672
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,100
You killed her, right?

673
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,320
Tell me.
- Yes.

674
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,600
Why?

675
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,340
Why did you?

676
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,760
Tell me.

677
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,300
'What are you doing, Amit?'

678
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,260
Nothing, Grandma. We're playing.

679
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:13,700
'Malhar!'

680
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,830
We're playing, grandma.

681
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,230
Listen, I am under
a lot of pressure.

682
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,900
We haven't seen so many crimes take
place since the last 15 years.

683
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,530
You think that Anthony
murdered both your daughters

684
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,340
that is why you killed his son.

685
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,100
Am I right?

686
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,170
Speak up!

687
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,650
The boy killed. He did.

688
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,080
Everyone.

689
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,960
Which boy?

690
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,920
Answer me.

691
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,490
Master.
- He has gone crazy!

692
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,320
Ma'am., don't move.
- Sit.

693
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,740
Sir, I...

694
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,330
I tried to stop him.
- Hey!

695
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,500
Are you high?

696
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:24,690
You are trying to say
that a nine-year-old

697
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:28,830
is murdering people right under
your nose, and you have no clue?

698
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,230
No, sir. No.

699
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,930
No, sir. I told...

700
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,530
Quiet! Absolutely quiet.

701
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,130
Get the boy.

702
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:47,540
Malhar!
- Dad.

703
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,210
Dad, are you alright?

704
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,550
Are you okay, dad?

705
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,800
Malhar, come and have a seat here.

706
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:57,530
Sir will ask some questions.
Have a seat.

707
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,530
Your name is Malhar, right?

708
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,780
Yes. - What were you
doing in the afternoon?

709
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,870
I was drying clothes.

710
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,420
What was your dad doing?

711
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,530
'Dad was repairing
the scooter outside.'

712
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,200
What happened next?

713
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,870
Then I came downstairs

714
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,100
and dad came back inside.

715
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,770
Then we both

716
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,110
heard aunt Sophia scream.

717
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,580
But your dad is saying

718
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,200
that you killed
aunt Sophia's son.

719
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:42,740
Dad is right.

720
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,330
So, you killed Roshan?

721
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:48,730
Yes.

722
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,710
And what about Shreya and Shruti?

723
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,800
Yes.

724
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,430
Dear.

725
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,950
Malhar, why did you kill them?

726
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,180
Jethwa.

727
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,590
Juvenile.

728
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,810
Come, dear.

729
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:33,900
Control.

730
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:43,930
Malhar!

731
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:49,560
Malhar!

732
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,720
No!

733
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,140
Malhar!

734
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,930
'What if I don't
play the tabla well?'

735
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:06,080
'I consider you a maestro now'

736
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,890
'and will always be.'

737
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:51,750
Ma'am, isn't he the one who
committed three murders?

738
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:11,470
Come.
- Malhar, how are you?

739
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,530
I am Dr. Narayan Bhargav.

740
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:21,030
She is Dr. Vandana. You've met her.

741
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,550
You will be very happy here.

742
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,270
There are a few rules.

743
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,490
Kamlesh will explain it to you.
Okay?

744
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:35,270
'As per the police reports, he has
committed three brutal murders.'

745
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,220
'He has murdered a dog too.'

746
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,150
'Therefore, it is important to know
what he is thinking.'

747
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,750
'He needs to open up for that.'

748
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,550
'Observe him for
24 hours everyday.'

749
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,120
'But he shouldn't come to know.'

750
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,570
'He should feel at home.'

751
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,470
'Doctor, I think you
should check his back.'

752
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,950
Who hit you?

753
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:57,630
Malhar, how can we help you
if you don't tell us the truth?

754
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,400
Did you fight with someone?

755
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,750
I think you are not in the
mood to talk to us today.

756
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:11,710
That is fine. We will
talk later, okay?

757
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,520
You may go.
- Come.

758
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:17,080
'He is hiding something.'

759
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,470
It is possible that
he hurt himself

760
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,950
...while doing the killings.

761
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:25,000
He doesn't look like a
serial killer, but

762
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,430
we must be thorough.

763
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:40,840
Duggu!

764
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,500
Duggu!

765
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,640
Duggu!

766
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:59,080
They didn't select me.
I was playing so well.

767
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,440
Hello, I am Duggu.

768
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,340
Malhar.

769
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,470
Listen, don't worry if
you ever end up having

770
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,570
too much food on your plate.
I am here. Okay?

771
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:27,410
'You are really talented.'

772
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,740
Are you happy here?

773
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,890
Yes, but I miss home.

774
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,380
That's normal.

775
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,440
You know why you are here, right?

776
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:43,420
Other than sending you home,
I can give you anything you want.

777
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,050
What do you want?

778
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,320
Malhar, what do you want?

779
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,410
I want to punish

780
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:55,280
the one who...

781
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,720
Make it.

782
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,120
Malhar, stand up.
Show it to everyone.

783
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,050
Wow!
- Wow!

784
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,950
What is that?

785
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,520
What is it?

786
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,380
Come on, kids!

787
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:25,070
Why are you here?

788
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:27,820
Because I love Diwali.

789
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:32,020
But they didn't want me to
celebrate Diwali in April.

790
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,770
This means, you burst

791
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,120
crackers in front
of everyone in April?

792
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,670
No. Kids burst crackers.

793
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:41,620
I ruptured two cars and a scooter.

794
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,420
In Hollywood style. It was fun.

795
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,610
Why are you here?

796
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,280
Just like you love Diwali,

797
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:55,290
I love my dad.

798
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,310
What?
- Forget that.

799
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:00,770
Does anyone see CCTV camera?

800
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,860
Or is it to scare us?

801
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,930
They keep an eye.

802
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:08,900
Once I pretended to light a match.

803
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,540
People surrounded me.

804
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,690
I didn't have a match box.

805
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,290
I gave everyone a high
five and returned.

806
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,640
15, 16, 17.

807
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,390
One is missing.

808
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,070
Malhar.

809
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:38,470
One, two, three four,
five, six, seven, eight.

810
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:16,590
Malhar, did you take
something that you shouldn't have?

811
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,530
Yes, a knitting needle.

812
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:23,550
Why? - I thought if
the needle is lost

813
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,950
then I won't have to knit.

814
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,650
What did you do with that needle?

815
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,560
I made it into a flower.
- What did you make?

816
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,370
A flower.

817
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,510
Where is this flower?

818
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,400
You made this?

819
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,260
Yes.
- How?

820
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,990
I just made it.

821
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,540
It's amazing.

822
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:52,750
Malhar, it is bad to steal.

823
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:56,570
Dr. Vandana, it is beautiful. We'll
display it in our craft exhibition.

824
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,370
And mention Malhar's name.
- Of course.

825
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,550
Don't steal again. Okay? Go.

826
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,530
Let's go to your dad, Malhar.

827
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,450
No! - Come on.
- I don't want to meet him.

828
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:35,530
Malhar, it is your dad.
- I don't want to meet him.

829
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,980
No!

830
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,490
I don't want to!
- Okay. - Let it be.

831
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,530
Calm down.
- I...

832
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:44,320
We won't meet him. Stand up.

833
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,230
Come on.

834
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,980
Malhar.

835
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:39,940
Malhar.

836
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,610
I heard you didn't meet your dad.

837
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,650
Don't you want to
meet your family?

838
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,480
I want to meet grandma,

839
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:52,210
mom, uncle,

840
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:54,950
...Shruti and Shreya.

841
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,680
And your dad?

842
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,550
This is all my fault, Bhavna.

843
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:18,810
After the girls passed away

844
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:22,160
I realised

845
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:24,040
.that

846
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,760
they were

847
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,420
our daughters.

848
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:35,500
Whatever happened with Malhar

849
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:38,910
is also my fault.

850
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,110
I couldn't be a good husband.

851
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,910
I failed

852
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,930
to be a good son and a good dad.

853
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,170
I am sorry.

854
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,280
Malhar will be back soon

855
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,360
We need to

856
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,680
make him realise that

857
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,540
we miss him.

858
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,360
Bhavaa, I am scared that
he will start hating us.

859
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,120
We cannot let that happen.

860
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,160
We have to

861
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:28,430
shower him

862
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,320
with a lot of love, but before that

863
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,800
you must recover.

864
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,690
Bhavna.

865
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:48,880
Bhavna.

866
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,330
Bhavna, I love you.

867
01:18:58,650 --> 01:18:59,830
Malhar.

868
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,950
Kamlesh told me

869
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,520
you've been lying
here since morning.

870
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:08,820
You didn't get up
after morning prayers.

871
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,120
Is everything alright?

872
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,140
Malhar, expressing yourself
makes you feel better.

873
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,760
I know you don't want to talk.

874
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:34,320
But you draw.

875
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:38,470
I know you draw quiet well.
Will you draw for me?

876
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,950
Tabla? Who plays this?
- I do.

877
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:09,420
Wow, you play tabla too?

878
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,550
Yes. I play the tabla
like Zakir Hussain does.

879
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,230
That is what my mom says.

880
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,410
Okay.

881
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:21,120
We will get your tabla right
away. Is that okay? - Yes.

882
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:23,900
Yes? It is time to have lunch.

883
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:25,300
Come on.

884
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:51,390
Sir, I have to show you something.
This is really urgent.

885
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,450
Sorry, I got late. Show it.

886
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,680
Malhar wanted to show me this.

887
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,410
And I found these in the dustbin.

888
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,400
Damaniya sir.

889
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,960
I am Bhargav.
- Dr. Bhargav? Yes.

890
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:12,900
Please come in.
- Thank you.

891
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,580
Tell me. I am here to talk
to you about Malhar's case.

892
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,490
You must have read the report.

893
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,540
Yes.
- The kid confessed it.

894
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,850
Mr. Damaniya,

895
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,380
you know that a child's
mind is very complicated.

896
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,910
They love their parents.
They're scared of being rejected.

897
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,330
Wanting to save their hero.

898
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:40,730
His dad was like a hero to him.

899
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,790
I would like to show you something.

900
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:47,370
Look at this. This
is Malhar's back.

901
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,570
Look at this wound. Someone has
hit Malhar's back again and again.

902
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,970
I have something more to show.

903
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,800
These are some drawings
made by Malhar.

904
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:01,470
Look.

905
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:03,360
There is a nail in his hand.

906
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:07,770
Malhar is standing here,
and someone else is killing.

907
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,410
Look at this. Someone is pushing
the kids out of the window.

908
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,770
Someone is beating them up.

909
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,320
When a kid makes such paintings

910
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,630
he is always saying the truth.

911
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:23,790
We think that this man

912
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,710
is his dad.

913
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,230
You did your best with
the investigation.

914
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:35,540
Now you have new proof.

915
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:38,510
I think we all want that

916
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,240
Malhar is given justice.

917
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,230
He is very sensitive
and extremely talented.

918
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,220
Can I keep it?

919
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,760
Sure. Of course, you can.

920
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,160
Thank you, doctor.

921
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:53,740
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

922
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:00,830
'First, you will tell us
everything about you and Amit.'

923
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,620
Our dads were friends.

924
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,230
When his dad
incurred a huge loss

925
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,010
he took a loan from my dad.

926
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,720
He couldn't pay off the loan

927
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:15,110
therefore, uncle gave
a part of his house to us.

928
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:16,490
That's all?

929
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:19,480
Is that it?
- Yes, this is all.

930
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,200
Amit has tried many times

931
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,170
to buy that house
at double the price.

932
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:28,740
But Anthony didn't want to sell it.

933
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,070
I heard your husband
has temper issues.

934
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:35,610
He drove the taxi and
built this business.

935
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,320
He will have temper issues.

936
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,930
Did he ever hit you?

937
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,250
Yes, but I have hit him back.

938
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:44,940
How did you become
friends with Anthony?

939
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,300
We were in college together.

940
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:47,880
We started talking then.

941
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,840
Was Amit close to the girls
or Malhar? - Malhar.

942
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,380
Did he ever hit the girls?

943
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,370
Never.

944
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,660
Your wife went to her mom's
house for a few months.

945
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,700
Actually...

946
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,890
Next time I will not
slam the table.

947
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:13,580
Sophie doubted that

948
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:16,390
bhavna and I have
something going on.

949
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,850
Did Amit doubt too?
- I was sure about it.

950
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,510
From Daman to Kolkata,
Kolkata to Punjab

951
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:23,200
Punjab to Benagluru,
Bengaluru to Daman.

952
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,820
I was tired. After driving on
the highway for 16 hours

953
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:28,500
when I'd go back to the hotel and
my wife wouldn't answer my call.

954
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:31,060
Her phone is always busy.

955
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,940
It makes one lose their mind.

956
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,260
I get weird thoughts.

957
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,970
So you killed Shreya,
Shruti and Roshan.

958
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:43,150
What.. What nonsense?

959
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,920
You will be glad to know

960
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,830
that your son didn't
utter a word against you.

961
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,820
We found these
drawings in a dustbin.

962
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,430
He was sure that Shreya and
Shruti are Anthony's daughters.

963
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,920
I tried to

964
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,260
explain to him many a times.
But he

965
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:15,330
was mentally ill.

966
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:18,690
By distancing himself from
Shreya and Shurti,

967
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,090
he has killed them everyday.

968
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,220
Everyday!

969
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,370
'What are you doing?'

970
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,000
'Why do you care?'

971
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,870
'It doesn't matter to you.'

972
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,530
'It matters to your
grandma and your mom.'

973
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,920
'Amit, look, he is hurt.'

974
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,210
'I will go and get medicines.'

975
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,130
He killed them.

976
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,690
He did.

977
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:01,160
'Malhar!'

978
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,520
'Malhar!'

979
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,990
Malhar!

980
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,440
Malhar!

981
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,950
Malhar!

982
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:14,510
Malhar!

983
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:19,830
Malhar!

984
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,290
'Amit Barot.'

985
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,460
'You are being arrested
for murdering'

986
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,100
'Shreya Barot, Shruti Barot and'

987
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,920
'Roshan D'souza.'

988
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,040
'You have the right
to remain silence.'

989
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,050
'Whatever you say'

990
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:00,960
'will be used against
you in the court.'

991
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:04,980
'For murder, being
callous towards kids'

992
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:08,450
'and for blaming a juvenile
for a crime he didn't commit, '

993
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,870
'you are being arrested
under IPC 302'

994
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,710
'and IPC 75.'

995
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,700
Malhar!

996
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:38,580
Malhar!

997
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:16,000
'Forensic evaluation says
it's Schizophrenia.'

998
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:19,670
'But it's rare in
children so young.'

999
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:21,940
'My God, he was so cunning.'

1000
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,770
'He stayed quiet and we
drew the conclusions.'

1001
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,060
'The way he refused to meet Amit.'

1002
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,740
'And refused to show the wound.'

1003
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:37,620
'He knew that we're seeing
him through the CCTV.'

1004
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,670
'He stole the knitting needle

1005
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,370
and made a flower from it.'

1006
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,490
'So we felt guilty.'

1007
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,770
'Then those drawings.'

1008
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,370
'He manipulated us all.'

1009
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,660
'He manipulated me.'

1010
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,920
'Who does someone kill anyone?'

1011
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:01,400
'There are a lot of theories,
but the right answer

1012
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:03,790
is still not out there.'
