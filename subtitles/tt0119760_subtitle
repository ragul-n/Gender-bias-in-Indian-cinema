1
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,020
So he is a boozard?

2
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,990
Hey! Hey!

3
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:44,419
- Wait! What are you doing?
- Committing suicide.

4
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,589
If you have leisure time.

5
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:53,528
And if you pity my state then
please shift the stool.

6
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,008
- Rest I'll handle everything.
- What will you handle?

7
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:01,340
This noose is around your neck
you will die and go to heaven.

8
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,937
But the law here will
send me to hell.

9
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,018
Look, if you help me.

10
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:12,347
I'll bequeath my entire
property in your name.

11
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,688
- Sorry, I don't accept charity
from corpses. - Hey!

12
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,624
- Do I look like a corpse?
- You will, after you die.

13
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:26,128
- Meaning you won't help me?
- No way. - Do one thing.

14
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,031
I'll put the noose around,
you push me.

15
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,973
Good lord! Are you here
to commit suicide"

16
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,979
.. or force me
to commit murder?

17
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,143
- Point to be thought about.
- Then sit and think.

18
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,578
Oh yeah, it is a point
to be thought about.

19
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,486
Okay tell me something,
young man.

20
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:51,153
Being a man why do you want to
commit suicide like cowards?

21
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,594
Life is God's greatest
gift to mankind.

22
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,394
And shame on those who
fail to understand it.

23
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,163
Look at me. What state am I in?

24
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,169
I have no food, no money.

25
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,174
My clothes are tattered
yet I'm surviving.

26
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,074
- Shame on you. - Why?

27
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,006
Had I been in this state"

28
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:14,677
.. I would have killed myself
the day I was born.

29
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,282
You are in a better position
than me today.

30
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,688
Then why are you committing
suicide?

31
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:29,032
- You won't understand. - I
understand everything, young man.

32
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,035
Almost every second
man on earth"

33
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,105
.. is stuck in the whirlpool
of poverty and hunger.

34
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,037
Some cry and elate themselves
while some"

35
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,201
.. hide it behind their
laughter. But yet..

36
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,539
Suicide is not the solution,
my friend.

37
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,374
Friendgg

38
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,717
- You called me your
friend? - Yes.

39
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,056
But you are not worthy
of my friendship.

40
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,058
Because a friend is one
who helps in distress"

41
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,792
-.. gives company in
everything. - Meaning?

42
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,068
If you are ready to commit
suicide with me..

43
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,401
.. only then will I consider
you as my friend.

44
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,340
Wow! What a test!
Okay, I'm game.

45
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,072
But one who puts ones
friend in trouble"

46
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,148
.. is not a true friend
either, my friend.

47
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,410
Wow, you have a way
with words, friend.

48
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,347
What work do you do?

49
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,083
I darn old, torn and
tattered clothes.

50
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,820
And also stitch them.

51
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,826
- We will make a good duo.
- ls it? - Yes.

52
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,269
Because I desperately
needed a man like you.

53
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,171
I bluff a lot.

54
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,777
- As I'm a big man.
- It is evident.

55
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,775
Henceforth whatever
nonsense I talk.

56
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,855
- Be it anything. You darn
it. - But this suicide?

57
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:04,787
- Congratulations. - Get up.

58
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,145
Friend.

59
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,147
This is my house.

60
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:32,554
- Henceforth you will stay here
with me. - Magnificent house!

61
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,159
As a child I had seen
such a house in movies.

62
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,164
Come on! I built this
house recently"

63
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:46,499
.. and you say you've seen
it in your childhood?

64
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,173
- There is a limit to bluff,
friend. - Well, l'm..

65
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,334
..not too old either.

66
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,436
I look like this because I
haven't eaten for too long.

67
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,174
Oh buddy!

68
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,846
Come.

69
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,519
Coming master.

70
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:19,794
My very good friend is here..
Look after him.

71
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,873
- The dinner is ready.
- Oh it is! - Yes.

72
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:31,612
- Before dinner a small peg.
- No, I'm famished. I'll eat.

73
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,809
- You don't want to drink.
- No. - Want to eat?

74
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,817
- Come along. - Master this way.

75
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,548
- Where? - Here.. come along.

76
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,952
Come from here, my poor friend.

77
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,298
Not from here.

78
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,302
You are my friend, aren't you?

79
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,564
- Then jump. - I'll
come from that side.

80
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,402
- I'll kiss you otherwise.
- No, I'll come.

81
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,577
Even my mother has never
kissed me <i>so</i> much.

82
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:12,984
Take this, my poor friend.

83
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,253
Have this sweet dish.

84
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,654
Little, from my hand.

85
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,424
- It's too sweet. -
Will you have dal?

86
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,765
Have dal from the same <i>spoon</i>
it will taste delicious.

87
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,275
Friend, will you eat this egg?
Leave that chicken.

88
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,606
Have this egg.

89
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,292
One minute.

90
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,571
- What is this for? - It
is called table manners.

91
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,374
Shall I eat the chicken?

92
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,847
- Grass? - No, these
are noodles.

93
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,314
My poor friend, have
these noodles.

94
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,857
- It's awful. - Awful?!

95
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,324
Have more. Develop your taste.

96
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,927
Eat it like this with the fork.

97
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,496
- They look like earthworms.
- Banana!

98
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,411
Good for digestion.

99
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,349
Give me some more.

100
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,363
It is a finger bowl!
To wash hands.

101
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,364
What are you doing?

102
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,760
- Will anything happen? - No.

103
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,031
No. It will work as a laxative.

104
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,441
My poor friend.

105
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,376
Here.

106
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,384
After a long time I'm eating.

107
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,392
Enough.

108
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,895
- Sure? No. - Yes! I swear.

109
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,398
- No! - Believe me. - No!

110
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,733
- Sure?! - Yes. - Come.

111
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,397
- Where? - To my room,
my friend!

112
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,476
- I'll go to my house. - No!

113
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:50,013
You've come here <i>so</i>
you'll stay here.

114
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,416
You have saved my life. I
won't let you go like this.

115
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,418
Come.

116
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,823
l.. I'll sleep here.

117
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,418
Here.! I'll sleep here.

118
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,089
Not here, my friend.

119
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,504
I'll make you sleep on
a higher bed than this.

120
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,594
No! I'll fall from there.

121
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,504
I'll get hurt. This place
is nice. I'll sleep there.

122
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,705
Remove your clothes.

123
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,443
- No. What are you doing? -
Wear proper clothes to bed.

124
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,519
No, I won't be able
to sleep in them.

125
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,453
Actually I live in my own skin
and wear my own clothes.

126
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,456
Well said!

127
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,465
You are an extremely
self-esteemed"

128
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,196
.. faithful and an orphan,
my friend.

129
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,136
Come on, go to sleep
Mr.Natwarlal.

130
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:59,812
And get up in the morning
with a bright future.

131
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:07,154
- Where are you sleeping?
- At your feet, my friend!

132
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,493
Good night.

133
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,997
You saved K.P's life.

134
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,590
Oh God!

135
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,919
W"? is my head splittingfi'?

136
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,690
Why did I sleep down?

137
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,541
Why is this bed stinking?

138
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,044
Who the"

139
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,887
Coming!

140
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,622
- Who is this beggar? - Your
friend. You got him here.

141
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,890
My friend?

142
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,727
- Throw him out. - What
are you doing, sir?

143
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,563
- Out! - When you were drunk
you were licking me.

144
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,638
Now you are kicking me out?!

145
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,639
Licking you? What nonsense?!
Throw him out!

146
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,232
- I saved your life!
- Throw him out!

147
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,307
Anybody takes advantage
of my decency. Out!

148
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,658
What a man!

149
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,071
- You! - Hey friend!

150
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,268
My buddy! My poor friend!

151
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,606
- Where are you?
- Hey! It is him.

152
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,615
Come with me. Life
without you is..

153
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:18,621
- .. incomplete. - Why? Didn't
you find anyone else to kick?

154
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,283
What are you saying?

155
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,026
Friends like me can bluff..

156
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,031
.. but they can never kick.

157
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,123
- Come with me. - No,
I want to deliver this.

158
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,794
Come on. You must come.

159
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,805
- I have to deliver this.
- What is this?

160
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,707
- My fate. - Such
a tattered fate?

161
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,975
Throw this. From today
this is your fate.

162
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,815
What happened? You
are feeling giddy?

163
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,049
Must have not eaten,
my poor friend.

164
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,728
I will feed you.

165
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:04,392
And you'll be welcomed in such
a way that you'll remember.

166
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,684
My bundle.

167
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:37,290
My poor friend! My brother!

168
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,699
- Sir my.. my.. -
Forget that bundle.

169
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:48,711
It is said, 'ring out the
old ring in the new'.

170
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,307
What are you doing?

171
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,216
I'm pulling you because
you are hesitant to come.

172
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,723
What are you thinking,
my poor friend?

173
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,726
I'm thinking, how loving
you are treating me now.

174
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,126
And in the morning you
will kick me out.

175
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,061
You are mistaken, my brother.

176
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,133
I kick only my enemies.

177
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,067
- Not friends. - Sorry,
I don't drink.

178
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,404
Develop a vice if
you wish to live.

179
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:28,251
For one can't lead a life
by just being healthy.

180
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,759
Deceive me not under the
facade of friendship.

181
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,830
I know you will kick
me out at dawn.

182
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,489
Well said!

183
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,835
- Where is he? - Well said!

184
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:55,176
You appear to be a vagabond
and yet shine like a jewel.

185
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,781
I'll take you in
a chariot, Gopi.

186
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:03,445
Get up in the morning
with a bright future.

187
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,119
- Lie down, my friend.
- Where will you sleep?

188
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,125
At your feet my poor friend.

189
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,789
Near your feet.

190
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,527
Near your slippers.

191
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,350
Not up.

192
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,039
Come <i>soon!</i> Hold this.

193
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,480
Before Master gets up throw
this in the drain.

194
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,280
Do not leave a single
bottle quick, hurry up.

195
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,056
It fell again.

196
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,912
Master, where have you got me.

197
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,574
- This is our office. - ls it?

198
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,084
You've come after a long time
hence you couldn't recognize it.

199
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,586
Meet her. This is
your aunt Mary.

200
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,590
What is this aunt Mary?

201
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:32,260
Why are you squeaking
like an old record?

202
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,438
What do I do, Mr.K.P? I tried
every possible treatment.

203
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:40,442
I wasted money like water but
I don't seem to get cured.

204
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,940
Do one thing.

205
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,447
Put this in the doctor's mouth.

206
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:54,951
- And do what this doctor
tells you. - What is that?

207
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,966
A little brandy. One egg in it.

208
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:12,299
One spoon. Why? To stir it.

209
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:19,482
One in the morning
and one at night.

210
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,313
- Finish! - Who?

211
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,978
The disease, not the patient.

212
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,990
Give her the dose.

213
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,998
This is doctor brandy.

214
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,496
This much before getting
up in the morning.

215
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,006
And this much after
going to bed.

216
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,502
Finish.

217
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,014
Before getting up
in the morning.

218
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,015
And after going to bed?

219
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,013
But destiny plays a key role
in making a man rich.

220
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,688
This is Mr.Deepak Bajaj. He
has topped the University.

221
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,522
- Professor Almenda sent you?
- Yes, sir. - Have a seat.

222
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,022
Please move.

223
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,899
- Do you drink? - Pardon?

224
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,033
- No, Sir. - Why?

225
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:24,047
Only people who have no
beautiful cause to live, drink.

226
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,047
It is not that.

227
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,046
- Do you smoke? - No.
- That's good.

228
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:38,384
Have you ever fallen in love?

229
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,388
No, Sir.

230
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,064
I am married.

231
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,064
Then there is no question about
affairs and the likes.

232
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,071
What a charming face you have.

233
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,079
- Master! - Yes.

234
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:03,085
Mr.Deepak is the new chartered
accountant from today.

235
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,416
But we have Mr.Lali.

236
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,421
Lali needs some firing now.

237
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,083
May Mr.Deepak (light)
spread his light.

238
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,594
His salary is Rs.1
lakh per month.

239
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,433
With accommodation and car.

240
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,604
And a free trip abroad
with family.

241
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,434
But master, where are we going?

242
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,600
Where have you got me?

243
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:32,108
Sir, got carried away. It's
25 thousand not one 1 lakh.

244
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,117
We will increase on seeing
your capabilities.

245
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,128
It's said"

246
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,628
'If you wish to understand
love..'

247
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,636
'If you wish to understand
love".

248
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:59,141
...then jump into the
sea'. 'Because..

249
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,144
.. just by sitting
at the shore.)

250
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,145
'.. you won't get an
idea of the storm'.

251
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,648
Good lord! Come on let's go.

252
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,150
Did I say anything wrong?

253
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,151
What's this? You should
have at least knocked.

254
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,158
Can't you see we were in
an important meeting?

255
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,162
Why hide from friends?

256
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,490
I have seen girls like her
in your lap many times.

257
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:29,163
You know my character
and vice versa.

258
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,175
Mr.K.P was saying that salary
will rise till 1 lakh.

259
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,836
What? My salary? One lakh?!

260
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,175
Beautiful, come close to me.

261
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,177
Mr.Lali, push her away.

262
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,847
Mr.Deepak Bajaj has been
appointed as the new manager.

263
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:50,188
- His salary can rise till
1 lakh, not yours. - What?

264
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,690
His salary will
be 1 lakh rupees?

265
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,195
I have been apple polishing
him all these years.

266
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,700
If Rs. 1 lakh is the
price of his honesty.

267
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,209
Then he can't even imagine
the price he has to pay..

268
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,212
.. for my dishonesty.

269
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,220
It thus happened"

270
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:25,227
"that in Simila, along
with a few friends"

271
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,230
..l stood on a snow
clad mountain..12

272
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,732
"was throwing something.

273
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:36,238
It was <i>so</i> chilling out there"

274
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,241
"so much so"

275
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:44,246
..that the moment words
came out of my mouth..

276
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,247
"they froze in midair.

277
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,246
Well, Mr. K.P.,
although we are"

278
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,254
"consuming your liquor,
but that"

279
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,256
"doesn't mean that
we can swallow"

280
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,258
"whatsoever nonsense you utter.

281
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,757
<i>Do you consider us to</i> be <i>fools?</i>

282
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,594
How come you realized that?

283
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:07,761
I mean to say" what
do you think?

284
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,270
Do I fib?

285
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,275
Do you think I make stories?

286
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,612
I will narrate the real picture.

287
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,278
You must have seen the mouth
emitting vapor during the winter.

288
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:29,291
Have you not? The same
happened with him too.

289
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,629
Along with it came
out the words too.

290
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:36,290
Since it was freezing cold,
the vapor was frozen..

291
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,299
"and thus the words froze too.

292
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,798
Well, now calm down. You
are crossing all limits.

293
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,305
This is nothing.

294
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,805
Now I will narrate the story
of the Bhopal jungles.

295
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,973
ls froze was there? - No.

296
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,312
I had gone there on
a hunting expedition.

297
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,321
Well, it thus happened"

298
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,323
"that a few of my
friends and l..

299
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,326
..were hunting in the jungles"

300
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:08,330
..where a man-eating
lion was reclined.

301
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,331
The moment I spotted the lion..

302
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,333
..l picked my gun up..

303
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,997
"and shot at the lion.

304
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,340
But the beast was smart as well.

305
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,845
It started running.

306
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,342
And my bullet was
in hot pursuit.

307
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,353
The lion turned back and saw.

308
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:38,360
And then thought which
side to turn?

309
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,357
But the bullet was
after all mine.

310
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,365
It too turned right.

311
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,367
Now the lion is running..

312
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,872
"with the bullet
in hot pursuit.

313
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,373
The lion turned left".

314
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,375
"and <i>so</i> did the bullet.

315
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,376
The lion got tensed"

316
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,383
..jumped and climbed the tree"

317
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,886
"and <i>so</i> did the bullet.

318
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,391
The lion started jumping
branches and"

319
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,725
Oh, let the lion die at least.

320
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:20,402
And <i>so</i> the lion started jumping
from branch to another..

321
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,065
"and <i>so</i> the bullet continued
to do the same.

322
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:28,406
The lion kept jumping from
one branch to another"

323
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,414
"and the bullet continued
to do the same.

324
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,417
After all it was my bullet.

325
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,415
The lion was perplexed
and anxious.

326
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,422
Started thinking..

327
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,426
..what is the mystery
behind this bullet.

328
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,428
Who fired it after all.

329
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,428
And the bullet was
standing there..

330
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,437
..right in front of him
that it would hit at him.

331
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,440
The lion thought of something"

332
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,443
"spotted a crater in front..

333
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,444
"and jumped into it.

334
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,446
And the bullet jumped as well.

335
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,445
And that was when the bullet
said 'enough' and hit the lion..

336
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,452
"and he died.

337
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,453
Good god, never before have
we heard of such fibs.

338
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,456
You think so?

339
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:27,469
What can I do now?

340
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,475
I can just mend patches
and small holes.

341
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,471
But you have shred
the whole cloth"

342
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,481
..Even my ancestors
cannot mend it.

343
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,984
It is not within me,
I am leaving.

344
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,487
Oh, you got me insulted
in front of everyone.

345
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,822
Pardon me, it crossed the
limits a bit, today.

346
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,485
I take your leave.

347
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:57,493
And the courage with which you..

348
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:02,504
"have borne with me..

349
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:08,510
..l cannot express my gratitude.

350
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,678
Who fell down!

351
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,809
Who fell down!

352
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,515
- I fell down. - I
thought it was me.

353
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,523
No, how can you fall?

354
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,852
You didn't drink, you had
only held the glass.

355
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,192
I was the one who was drinking.

356
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,528
Don't drink <i>so</i> much, master.

357
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,029
Who me?

358
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,200
Me? And I should not drink?

359
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,541
Master, today we will
ride this motorcycle.

360
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,549
- Boss, this is my bike.
- So what?

361
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,552
Give him the keys
of my Mercedes.

362
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,556
- In-lieu of this motorcycle?
- Go on!

363
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,549
- Now no coming here
henceforth. - Why is that so?

364
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:03,565
Tomorrow if you like anyone's
hut you'll give him your palace?

365
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:08,564
'Wherever it goes it
illuminates the place'.

366
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,574
'Hitherto no one has been
able to bound light.'

367
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,575
Wow! Wow!

368
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,578
Wait!

369
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,581
This is my address.

370
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,581
Just remember that you are
only one nights king.

371
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,591
Tomorrow come and
return his car.

372
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,594
And take back your motorcycle.
If it is in one piece.

373
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,595
Do get it.

374
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,106
- 420? - Sit down.

375
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,609
Its number is 420.
And I heard...

376
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,618
- .. pillions always die
first. - You are right.

377
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,291
Tell me, would you ever enjoy
like this in a Mercedes?

378
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,956
I'd enjoy more on a cycle.

379
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,125
God willing, we'll ride
a cycle next time.

380
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,637
Look in the front. Two motor
cycles are approaching.

381
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,642
You are high. It's a tempo
not motorcycles.

382
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:26,972
Young man, I have driven many
carriages in my childhood.

383
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,646
- Shame on your childhood.
- Why?

384
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,154
Stop! Stop!

385
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,991
What happened, Sir?

386
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:46,660
I feel like urinating.

387
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,671
The ground is clear
go and dirty it.

388
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,001
Dirty?

389
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,166
I'll come.

390
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,680
One minute, I'll just come.
I want to go badly.

391
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,707
Good Lord!

392
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,711
Now I'm relieved, let us go.

393
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,042
- Shame on you. - Why?

394
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,712
- Do you've money or should
I give? - I do have.

395
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,215
- You wanted to ride
a cycle. - Yes.

396
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:45,724
- Buy one and come home.
- No. I'll come with you.

397
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,731
Now you are not worth
coming with me, Master.

398
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,735
What has happened
all of a sudden?

399
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:59,735
One urinates by opening
ones pants buttons..

400
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,744
.. and not by one's shirts.

401
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:08,250
I know, gentleman I
opened my pants"

402
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,259
What a shame!

403
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,761
Shame on this liquor and
the one who drinks it.

404
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:25,767
It makes you forget where
your buttons are!

405
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,468
Master, our baby has ditched us.

406
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,807
It is not ours, it is his.

407
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,816
- Come on sit. - No, Sir.
I'll take a taxi.

408
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,151
Come on sit. If I could I'd
give all my workers a car each.

409
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,825
Give him a lift first. Rest
you can decide afterwards.

410
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,828
Master, listen to this..

411
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,825
‘There will come a day
in our country.)

412
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:34,836
...when every worker will
have a car for his family'.

413
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,839
Thought is good but
the couplet is bad.

414
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,837
- The thought is good. - Yes,
let it be till there.

415
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,187
- It's nothing. -
If you don't mind.

416
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,852
How about a cup of tea?

417
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,194
- Tea! - Tea!

418
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,858
- Tea at this hour? - You are
humiliating the evening.

419
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:10,372
- Master, tell him. - Forget
it, he is our man.

420
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:14,204
Gentleman, we owe you an
evening. Some other time.

421
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,869
- But do not refuse next
time. - No, we won't.

422
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,884
Master, remove it quietly.

423
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:28,384
-' It may be a sin for others'.
- Well said"

424
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,892
- '.. but if we drink it's
a virtuous deed'. - Deed.

425
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,897
‘One drop of liquor is made.)

426
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:40,402
...after combining
hundreds of tears'.

427
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,953
'Your 'bindi' is like the
moon and the stars.'

428
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,957
'It looks like a
full moon night.'

429
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,460
'Your hair is like
the dark clouds.'

430
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,963
'And you are the monsoon rains.'

431
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,467
'There are buds in the garden.'

432
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,627
'And those buds are
very fragnant.'

433
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,968
'You also are very fragnant.'

434
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:55,636
'I am with you forever.'

435
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,476
'And you are with me.'

436
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,982
'I am with you forever.'

437
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,988
'And you are with me.'

438
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:11,322
'My eyes always look at you.'

439
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,658
'You are like the procession
of dreams.'

440
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,993
'My lips are always
singing praises.'

441
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:23,004
'And you are the one they
are praising about.'

442
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,667
'I have a small heart
in my chest.'

443
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:30,007
'And you are the
feelings in it.'

444
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,345
'I am with you forever.'

445
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:38,011
'And you are with me.'

446
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:42,353
'I am with you forever.'

447
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:46,019
'And you are with me.'

448
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,054
'O beautiful valleys! Wait,
let nle swing a little.'

449
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,064
Let me kiss your lips
with my lips.'

450
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:31,072
'I always pray every
morning and night.'

451
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:35,076
'That we should not be
separated at any point.'

452
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,083
'Our meetings should
be like this.'

453
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,588
'I am with you forever.'

454
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,419
'And you are with me.'

455
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:54,087
'I am with you forever.'

456
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:58,099
'And you are with me.'

457
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,115
'The afternoons should be
very bright and sunny.'

458
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,447
'And the evenings should
be young and happening.'

459
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:21,614
'Only your name must always
be on my lips.'

460
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,625
'There should always be your
thoughts on my mind.'

461
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,131
'Darling, the vermillion
of your name should be..

462
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,133
...In my forehead.'

463
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,471
'Your hands should
be in my hands.'

464
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:45,138
'I am with you forever.'

465
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:49,150
'And you are with me.'

466
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,154
'Your 'bindi' is like the
moon and the stars.'

467
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:57,158
'It looks like a
full moon night.'

468
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:01,162
'Your hair is like
the dark clouds.'

469
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,165
'And you are the monsoon rains.'

470
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,667
'There are buds in the garden.'

471
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,498
'And those buds are
very fragrant.'

472
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,664
'You also are very fragrant.'

473
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:16,177
'I am with you forever.'

474
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,680
'And you are with me.'

475
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:24,515
'I am with you forever.'

476
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,851
'And you are with me.'

477
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:31,188
'My eyes always looks at you.'

478
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:35,526
'You are like the procession
of dreams.'

479
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,192
'My lips are always
singing praises.'

480
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,204
'And you are the one they
are praising about.'

481
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,202
'I have a small heart
in my chest.'

482
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,871
'And you are the
feelings in it.'

483
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:55,212
'I am with you forever.'

484
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,879
'And you are with me.'

485
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:03,220
'I am with you forever.'

486
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,727
'And you are with me.'

487
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:11,232
'I am with you forever.'

488
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,735
'And you are with me.'

489
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:19,240
'I am with you forever.'

490
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,244
'And you are with me.'

491
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:39,260
K.P, it is futile to think about
the one who has forgotten you.

492
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,923
I didn't think about her,
I happened to spot her.

493
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,593
And her glimpse has
freshened my wounds.

494
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,261
I am very disturbed, master.

495
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,273
- I had loved her intensely.
- No, K.P.

496
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:56,778
- Now she belongs to someone
else. - She may.

497
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,279
But I haven't accepted
anyone else.

498
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,284
She married someone else. But
I still worship her picture.

499
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,786
This worship is such a thing.

500
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:09,289
Some worship beauty where
as others worship nature.

501
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:15,290
Hitherto, I have never asked you
anything. But today I ask you.

502
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,297
What had happened?

503
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:25,306
One requires a heart of stone
to face the blows of fate.

504
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,305
And a heart of gold
to fall in love.

505
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,310
I was a mechanic, master.

506
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,332
Hey hero!

507
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,340
This one really looks
like a hero.

508
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,344
Excuse me! Please take a look
at my car it's not starting.

509
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:10,351
Who has cast an evil eye on
it. It looks wonderful.

510
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,854
I always see it passing by.

511
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,352
He even looks at
girls passing by.

512
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:22,363
- I can also hear. -
Oh he can also hear.

513
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,360
Looks like we'll miss
tonight's party.

514
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,700
Just start.

515
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,378
How much?

516
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,384
I'm your neighbour,
not a stranger.

517
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,382
And does anyone take money
from ones neighbours?

518
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,894
Pooja give him the money or
he'll extort it in such a way.

519
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:57,397
- That you'll remember all
your life. - Get lost!

520
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,729
- Did you say anything? - No!!

521
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,405
I fear the fate of this city!

522
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,425
Another break down?

523
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,431
No! I was going home.

524
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,434
- But you are still working?
- What to do?

525
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:37,097
Poor peoples lives end soon but
their work doesn't seem end.

526
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,437
- Meaning, you won't sleep
all night? - No!

527
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:44,445
One who owns this car has
taken away my sleep.

528
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:50,451
Amazing. The one whose car
is spoilt is fast asleep.

529
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,454
And its mechanic has
lost his sleep.

530
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,455
It is all fate.

531
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,482
She has flipped.

532
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,500
Come on, I'll drop you home.

533
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:43,504
No, thank you. I'll
go by the bus.

534
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,835
I'm your neighbour
not a stranger.

535
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:50,503
And I'm sorry to say I don't
take money from my neighbours.

536
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,512
Please.

537
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,181
When a driver drives a car only
then you should sit behind.

538
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,522
But when it's someone you know,
you should sit in front.

539
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,856
Should l?

540
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,045
What is it?

541
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,547
What?

542
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,552
Wait! Why are you whistling?

543
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,555
Wait, I'm coming.

544
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,895
Why are you whistling
like a ruffian?

545
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,553
What could I do? If I'd
call out your name"

546
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,893
.. your father would
come out instead.

547
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,558
- ls there no other way
to call me? - There is.

548
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:51,072
- Should I call out like my
friends do? - How is that?

549
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,583
Can't you play a nice
musical instrument?

550
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,588
Lute?

551
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,613
Shameless creature!

552
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,617
I told him to play a
musical instrument.

553
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,618
A Lute!

554
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:46,127
Play it all night! But
I won't come to you.

555
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,702
Th row it. Th row!

556
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,733
But how did you think
about that lute?

557
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:39,740
Can't it happen that we meet
without playing anything?

558
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,747
Here! Play this mouth
organ henceforth.

559
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:52,753
Do you know how a rich man's
house can be recognized?

560
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:56,757
When he throws a party and there's
a bee-line of cars outside.

561
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:02,086
And the gate of our bungalow
should be of mere bars.

562
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:06,258
So that one who can't come in,
can see it from outside.

563
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,768
Yes. People like us be happy"

564
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,770
.. by seeing bungalows
from outside.

565
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,772
Hey! But our lawn
should be huge.

566
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,781
After the car halts
at the porch when..

567
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,785
..the chauffeur open the car.

568
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,782
One should feel that a great
party is happening!

569
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,791
And when you enter the hall..

570
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,794
.. then just like the sets
of Raj Kapoor's films"

571
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,798
.. the stairs should
lead upstairs!

572
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,797
Yes! But our bedroom
will be upstairs.

573
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,804
And gentleman"

574
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:49,810
When you open the door it
should be like Paradise.

575
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,813
It's difficult.

576
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,819
But not impossible.

577
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:08,823
- We must get married now. -
Look Pooja, I'm a poor man.

578
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,490
- And an orphan too. - So what?

579
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:17,167
Neither do I have a proper
business nor a fixed job.

580
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,839
So what?

581
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,443
I can neither take you
to posh restaurants"

582
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:27,174
-.. nor give you proper
food to eat. - So what?

583
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,849
I neither have a roof
above my head.

584
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,186
- Nor.. - A car to move in.

585
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,358
- So what? - ls it?

586
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,863
So what?! Eh?

587
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,929
- What if your father
refuses? - So what?

588
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:53,540
Fool! ls my father getting
married to you or is it me?

589
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:48,526
'After holding you so close,
we were lost somewhere.'

590
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:56,438
'We were so near that
we had become one.'

591
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:51,491
'I have quenched my prolonged
thirst from your lips.'

592
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:59,489
'I have seen your marvelous
body from my eyes.'

593
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:07,507
'You were spreading magic
like the sea-storm.'

594
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:16,006
'Every particle of sand
was like vermillion.'

595
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:24,425
'Our eyes were wide open
but we were sleeping.'

596
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:33,092
'We were so near that
we had become one.'

597
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:45,044
'After holding you so close,
we were lost somewhere.'

598
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:53,051
'We were so near that
we had become one.'

599
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:28,086
'There was no distance
between our eyes.'

600
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:36,095
'We were talking, but
our mouths were shut.'

601
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:43,762
'Our desires were making
us feel restless.'

602
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:52,111
'Our feelings were aroused,
but we both were unaware.'

603
00:57:52,735 --> 00:58:01,120
'We had forgotten the
world for sometime.'

604
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:10,129
'We were so near that
we had become one.'

605
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:21,473
'After holding you so close,
we were lost somewhere.'

606
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:29,344
'We were so near that
we had become one.'

607
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,146
'We had lost somewhere.'

608
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,152
'We had become one.'

609
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,154
'We had lost somewhere.'

610
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,488
'We had become one.'

611
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,162
Come in.

612
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,160
- This is my little hut.
- ls this a hut?

613
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,505
- Where is that poor man then?
- Who? - Your father.

614
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,502
You impudent boy!

615
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,244
- Look, you have to behave
like a decent man. - Yes.

616
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,175
ls he strict?

617
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,150
Greetings.

618
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:11,155
Father, this is Krishna.

619
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,155
Welcome Krishna.

620
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,841
- Greetings. - Bless you.

621
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:31,172
Pooja is my only child. And I
have confidence in her choice.

622
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,509
- Yes. - Won't you
get sweets for him?

623
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,443
I'll just come.

624
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:41,854
- Will you have tea? - Sure.

625
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,525
Make tea for Krishna
from own tea garden.

626
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,398
- Where do you stay, son?
- With my friend..

627
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,470
.. in lovely guest
house at the moment.

628
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,403
But soon I'll make
some arrangement.

629
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,534
- Which college are you
from? - Not college.

630
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,877
But a diploma in mechanical
draughts"

631
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,948
..man from Bharat technical
institute.

632
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,551
- Where is your factory?
- Factory?

633
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,956
I work as a stock keeper in
a Mineral water company.

634
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,224
They are happy with me. And
soon I'll become permanent.

635
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,893
Your parents?

636
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,227
I'm an orphan.

637
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,298
- But Pooja.. - She
is still naive.

638
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:32,597
But you have all the qualities
of becoming a big man.

639
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,976
You are very far-sighted.

640
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,380
- Here it is. - This
is Pooja's mother.

641
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,907
The goddess of wealth
of this house.

642
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,385
This is Rs five lakhs.

643
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:50,254
I think this is sufficient
to open your factory.

644
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,992
Because I don't want people
to call my son-in-law poor.

645
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:00,261
Dear, I like your choice.

646
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:07,006
No, Mr. Dayal. I'm not worthy
of marrying her now.

647
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:12,537
But thanks to you..
for opening my eyes.

648
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,446
.. first time I'm
missing my father.

649
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:20,281
Okay Pooja. I'll leave. And
I'll return the day"

650
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,548
.. your father feels proud
in calling me his son-in-law.

651
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,421
But you didn't take
anything, son.

652
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,961
A dog cannot digest
ghee, Mr. Dayal.

653
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:31,624
But Pooja wait for me.
I'll surely return.

654
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:35,460
And I'll return as a big
man only for your sake.

655
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,302
Because you are my life, my aim.

656
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,308
And I can do anything for you.

657
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:09,000
- Sir, this is Krishna
here. - Krishna?

658
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:14,338
- How are you? - Fine.
Can I talk to Pooja?

659
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,341
Have you become a big man or
are you still that dog..

660
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,605
.. who cannot digest ghee?

661
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:33,414
You always seem to make time
for worship and 'Tilak'.

662
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,750
By putting this vermilion
I feel at peace, Punditji.

663
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,452
Mother.

664
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,734
Dear.

665
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,470
Whatever parents
do it's always"

666
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,808
..for the betterment
of their child.

667
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:42,485
Man never gets what
he desires, my dear.

668
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:48,491
I have nothing else to give
except advises and blessings.

669
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,757
Keep this in mind.

670
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,160
Now my honour lies
in your hands.

671
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,840
If ever you see something
you've lost.

672
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,510
Don't ever lift your
veil and look at it.

673
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,516
Well..

674
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,517
.. that is my story.

675
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,531
In this world.

676
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:34,534
It is easy to make money.

677
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:42,216
But difficult to make place
in someone's heart.

678
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:52,222
Though it is spring
all around"

679
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,228
.. my house appears...

680
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,356
.. like a desert to me!

681
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,728
Enough.

682
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,639
I'm ruined, Master! I'm ruined!

683
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:45,610
'I try to forget you sometimes.'

684
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:51,617
'But I don't know why,
my sweetheart.'

685
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:55,616
'I still remember you.'

686
01:06:56,912 --> 01:07:00,951
'I still remember you.'

687
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:07,627
'I still remember you.'

688
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:13,298
'I try to forget you sometimes.'

689
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:19,642
'But I don't know why,
my sweetheart.'

690
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:24,308
'I still remember you.'

691
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:29,315
'I still remember you.'

692
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:35,657
'I still remember you.'

693
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:11,849
'In the monsoons, if a cuckoo
sings somewhere.'

694
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:31,716
'In the monsoons, if a cuckoo
sings somewhere.'

695
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:36,720
'On the branches of
a henna plant.'

696
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:43,394
'I don't know why,
my sweetheart.'

697
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:47,992
'I still remember you.'

698
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:52,997
'I still remember you.'

699
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:58,912
'I still remember you.'

700
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:30,528
'If someone drops a glass.'

701
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:50,121
'If someone drops a glass.'

702
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:55,468
'And the water is spilled over.'

703
01:09:55,558 --> 01:10:01,474
'I don't know why,
my sweetheart.'

704
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,808
'I still remember you.'

705
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:11,815
'I still remember you.'

706
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:17,489
'I still remember you.'

707
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:23,496
'I try to forget you sometimes.'

708
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:29,502
'But I don't know why,
my sweetheart.'

709
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:33,829
'I still remember you.'

710
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:39,577
'I still remember you.'

711
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:44,848
'I still remember you.'

712
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,853
'Why do I remember you?'

713
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:54,854
'Why do I remember you?'

714
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:59,860
'Why do I remember you?'

715
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:06,131
'Why do I remember you?'

716
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:12,936
Do you know that Mr. K.P didn't
want to celebrate his birthday?

717
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:17,543
But what could he do? The
cards had been distributed.

718
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:22,818
Even I didn't know why
he was like this.

719
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:27,720
Later on I learnt that he
was an ordinary mechanic.

720
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:32,893
And he became a big tycoon for
a rich businessmaﬂs daughter.

721
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,566
I forget to tell you something.

722
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:40,235
- Do you know what is the
name of his house? - What?

723
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:48,079
<i>He paid 21 craves ior
a 20 crore mansion.</i>

724
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:51,917
Only because he wanted
such a mansion.

725
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,746
As it is one of its kind
in the entire city!

726
01:11:56,945 --> 01:12:00,586
Therefore he purchased
the Kings Mansion.

727
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:07,598
'Do you know how a rich mans
house can be recognized'?

728
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,604
'When he throws a party and there's
a bee-line of cars outside'.

729
01:12:23,974 --> 01:12:27,217
'And the gate of our bungalow
should be of mere bars'.

730
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:31,782
'So that one who can't come
in can see it from outside'.

731
01:12:43,994 --> 01:12:45,974
'After the car halts at
the porch when the..

732
01:12:46,063 --> 01:12:48,168
...chauffeur open the door'.

733
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:50,802
'One should feel that a great
party is happening'.

734
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:54,145
Come on.

735
01:13:08,018 --> 01:13:09,998
Greetings sister-in-law.
- Greetings. How are you?

736
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:13,660
Come I'll show you around.
What a wonderful palace!

737
01:13:14,024 --> 01:13:16,265
Excuse me, Mr. Deepak.
I'll show her around.

738
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:19,668
Please follow me, sister-in-law.

739
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:26,674
Mr. K.P built this palace
according to his beloveds wish.

740
01:13:27,104 --> 01:13:32,349
But unfortunately, she
got married elsewhere.

741
01:13:35,212 --> 01:13:37,692
'And when you enter the hall..'

742
01:13:37,781 --> 01:13:40,694
'.. then just like the sets
of Raj Kapoor's film'.

743
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:42,022
'The stairs should
lead upstairs'.

744
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:44,861
This is nothing sister-in-law.
Go upstairs and see..

745
01:13:44,955 --> 01:13:48,095
.. you'll find amazing things.

746
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:45,813
Beneath the Taj lies Mumtaz.

747
01:15:47,344 --> 01:15:51,815
But beneath this palace" lies
many secrets, Mrs. Pooja.

748
01:15:54,184 --> 01:15:56,994
Don't worry, sister-in-law.
Don't worry at all.

749
01:15:57,387 --> 01:16:00,334
I didn't see anything.

750
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:06,839
Mr. Deepak is looking
for you outside.

751
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:13,845
I saw nothing.

752
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:26,857
You were upstairs? I was
looking for you down.

753
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,859
Did you see the palace?

754
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:36,032
What's the matter? You
look disturbed, Pooja?

755
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,531
No. - She's astounded
on seeing the palace.

756
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:45,875
Come, let me introduce
you to Mr. K.P.

757
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:57,217
May you live a thousand
years and"

758
01:16:57,314 --> 01:16:59,225
"may every year be
of 50,0000 days.

759
01:17:03,587 --> 01:17:07,899
' Bless me not with
a long life..'

760
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,234
'.. for the times
that have gone..

761
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:14,900
"By has not been
worth remembering'.

762
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:21,574
I'm not happy today, just
because it's my birthday.

763
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:29,718
But because one more day of my
aggrieved life has lessened.

764
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:34,320
May his enemies lives end.

765
01:17:34,451 --> 01:17:37,660
We pray that he lives
a long life.

766
01:18:00,644 --> 01:18:07,619
'You only have ruined my life.'

767
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:19,971
'You only have ruined my life.'

768
01:18:20,597 --> 01:18:27,640
'You only have ruined my life.'

769
01:18:28,605 --> 01:18:35,989
'I have started drinking
because of you.'

770
01:18:36,613 --> 01:18:44,327
'You only have ruined my life.'

771
01:18:44,621 --> 01:18:52,005
'I have started drinking
because of you.'

772
01:18:52,562 --> 01:19:00,071
'You only have ruined my life.'

773
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:25,232
'I had loved you.'

774
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:29,367
'I had trusted your love.'

775
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:37,211
'I am a poor crazy lover.'

776
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:41,379
'You have killed me so easily.'

777
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:47,551
'Wish I would have
known it earlier.'

778
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:51,394
'Then now I wouldn't have
cried like this.'

779
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:04,075
'You only have ruined my life.'

780
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:11,574
'I have started drinking
because of you.'

781
01:20:13,276 --> 01:20:21,093
'You only have ruined my life.'

782
01:20:37,534 --> 01:20:39,275
Who is this lady?

783
01:20:39,469 --> 01:20:43,110
This is the lady whose pictures
are pasted in sir's room.

784
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:47,513
Because of her generosity,
today sir is in such a condition.

785
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:51,615
'What do I tell someone
why do I live?'

786
01:20:51,748 --> 01:20:55,628
'I try to cover my injuries.'

787
01:20:59,756 --> 01:21:03,636
'There is some pain in my life.'

788
01:21:03,727 --> 01:21:07,641
'There is no fun
in being alive.'

789
01:21:09,766 --> 01:21:13,612
'I've got the award
for this love.'

790
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:17,310
'I was restless all the time.'

791
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:30,161
'You only have ruined my life.'

792
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:37,669
'I have started drinking
because of you.'

793
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:46,337
'You only have ruined my life.'

794
01:23:26,636 --> 01:23:28,274
Silly girl.

795
01:23:28,705 --> 01:23:32,084
It is not your fault.
Why are you crying?

796
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:37,790
I know you love me very much.

797
01:23:38,982 --> 01:23:41,690
And you can't think of
anybody else except me.

798
01:23:44,654 --> 01:23:46,292
I can't even think..

799
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,800
.. that man whom
I revered as God.

800
01:23:51,728 --> 01:23:53,298
Could stoop <i>so</i> low.

801
01:23:55,665 --> 01:23:57,303
I'll never forgive him.

802
01:23:58,935 --> 01:24:03,475
I'll resign today itself! I'll
return his house and car keys!

803
01:24:05,675 --> 01:24:09,487
A human beings charity
is much better..

804
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:11,490
.. than a devils gift!

805
01:24:16,686 --> 01:24:21,328
I'm feeling embarrassed of
what happened last night.

806
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:24,736
I don't know what to do.

807
01:24:25,762 --> 01:24:28,868
Do one thing. Go and
apologise to her.

808
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:31,336
Apologise?
- Yes.

809
01:24:32,769 --> 01:24:37,013
If you do that, her respect for
you will be further extolled.

810
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:41,617
But will she forgive me?
- Why not?

811
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:46,025
Not only you loved her
she had also loved you.

812
01:24:47,383 --> 01:24:49,363
She will surely understand
your feelings.

813
01:25:12,575 --> 01:25:14,646
I'm extremely sorry for
what happened last night.

814
01:25:17,013 --> 01:25:18,720
Actually yesterday"

815
01:25:18,815 --> 01:25:21,557
...I waded back into my past".

816
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:25,895
.. where I had once worshipped
a girl called Pooja.

817
01:25:28,825 --> 01:25:32,568
Your past will ruin..

818
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:37,407
.. both my present and future.

819
01:25:39,769 --> 01:25:41,407
You were a mechanic,
weren't you?

820
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:45,415
And a mechanic assembles
broken things.

821
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:47,588
And does not dissemble things.

822
01:25:49,779 --> 01:25:51,417
Do not ruin my house.

823
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:55,425
Which past are you
talking about?!

824
01:25:55,852 --> 01:25:58,594
On seeing me you remembered
your past?

825
01:25:59,055 --> 01:26:04,596
Why couldn't you see my
vermilion and my wedding chain?

826
01:26:07,063 --> 01:26:08,770
Why did you forget that
I'm not your Pooja..

827
01:26:08,865 --> 01:26:11,106
.. but someone else's wife!

828
01:26:11,801 --> 01:26:15,442
Whatever happened last
night was your desire.

829
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:19,515
The desire to achieve me
is still alive in you!

830
01:26:20,643 --> 01:26:22,782
You favoured my husband
and this house"

831
01:26:22,879 --> 01:26:25,450
.. <i>so</i> that under that pretext
you could reach me.

832
01:26:25,815 --> 01:26:28,455
But now I'm far beyond
your reach!

833
01:26:28,885 --> 01:26:32,128
You won't get me even
if you become God!

834
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:35,465
Never! In no birth!

835
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:37,467
In no birth.

836
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:50,080
I had come to apologies to
Pooja for tomorrows mistake.

837
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:53,485
Wow!

838
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:58,150
It's a wonderful excuse
for another meeting.

839
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:02,655
I have submitted
my resignation"

840
01:27:02,752 --> 01:27:05,824
.. and your house and car
keys in your office.

841
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:09,501
I‘ m sure that"

842
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:13,506
.. as of now you won't
look at my wife.

843
01:27:13,863 --> 01:27:15,843
Deepak, you have got me wrong.

844
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:20,511
I gave you this job seeing your
degree and not your wife.

845
01:27:23,706 --> 01:27:27,017
Right now my wife is
alone in the house.

846
01:27:27,944 --> 01:27:31,915
When you can kiss her in every
ones presence then alone..

847
01:27:32,148 --> 01:27:33,855
Don't think I'm one of
those needy people..

848
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:36,692
..who can use their
wives to get a job..

849
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:38,527
"and promotion and
make them cry!

850
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:40,530
I know you are a big man!

851
01:27:41,224 --> 01:27:43,864
But not bigger than my
honour and prestige.

852
01:27:44,894 --> 01:27:47,704
I'll humiliate you
in such a way..

853
01:27:47,797 --> 01:27:51,040
..that you won't be able to
show your face to anyone!

854
01:28:02,178 --> 01:28:04,715
‘You favoured my husband
and my house.)

855
01:28:04,814 --> 01:28:07,727
'..so that under that pretext
you could reach me'.

856
01:28:10,253 --> 01:28:16,898
'The desire to achieve nle
is still alive in you'.

857
01:28:17,093 --> 01:28:19,573
'Do not think I'm one
of those needy people'.

858
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:21,903
'Who use their wives to
get a job and promotion"

859
01:28:21,998 --> 01:28:23,568
...and make them cry'!

860
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:27,975
'You won't be able
to face anyone'!

861
01:29:05,308 --> 01:29:06,616
What did you say?

862
01:29:18,821 --> 01:29:21,631
You will insult me?
Krishna Prasadl?

863
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:24,638
Move aside Pooja!

864
01:30:05,034 --> 01:30:06,672
Stop here!

865
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:09,679
Come here.

866
01:30:10,973 --> 01:30:13,010
What's the matter, Lali?
What is all this?

867
01:30:13,109 --> 01:30:18,354
You are charged of stealing lakhs
of rupees from K.P industries.

868
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:33,863
Sir, I did just as you told me.

869
01:30:34,797 --> 01:30:36,708
I sent him to jail.

870
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,108
Sir, I forgot to tell
you one thing.

871
01:30:41,337 --> 01:30:44,716
On the eve of the party,
Deepak's wife was seeing around.

872
01:30:44,907 --> 01:30:47,251
She went into your chamber
and saw her photographs.

873
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:51,719
When I suddenly went in, she
got astonished on seeing me.

874
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:57,127
I understood why you replaced
Deepak instead of me.

875
01:31:08,364 --> 01:31:09,741
Sensible.

876
01:31:10,933 --> 01:31:13,914
Sir, I have been your
loyal servant"

877
01:31:14,003 --> 01:31:17,143
.. I'll not divulge
this to anyone.

878
01:31:17,373 --> 01:31:19,751
I told Mrs Pooja also
not to get scared"

879
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:21,913
..as I had not seen anything.

880
01:31:27,116 --> 01:31:32,429
On this earth, one can
only love ones beloved.

881
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:37,933
But perhaps I'm the first
man on this earth"

882
01:31:38,027 --> 01:31:42,169
.. to have declared
war against my love.

883
01:31:46,969 --> 01:31:51,281
I don't know how to tell you.

884
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:55,953
But your case it
just one sided"

885
01:31:56,045 --> 01:31:59,185
.. it carries no weight.
No one can save your son.

886
01:32:15,998 --> 01:32:17,807
Father!

887
01:32:19,001 --> 01:32:20,810
Father!

888
01:32:22,004 --> 01:32:23,813
Don't cry my children.

889
01:32:25,174 --> 01:32:27,984
When destiny can shower
happiness all of a sudden"

890
01:32:28,077 --> 01:32:31,217
.. it can also snatch
away everything.

891
01:32:33,182 --> 01:32:35,492
Whatever Krishna Prasad
had given us.

892
01:32:37,186 --> 01:32:39,496
He took it away with interest.

893
01:32:41,023 --> 01:32:42,832
Now you tell me.

894
01:32:44,026 --> 01:32:47,166
A boy who never cheated
his mother even for milk.

895
01:32:48,264 --> 01:32:50,505
Has been accused of stealing
lakhs of rupees?

896
01:32:51,867 --> 01:32:54,575
Father, did you appeal
in the court?

897
01:32:55,471 --> 01:32:57,178
How can I do that, dear?

898
01:32:58,941 --> 01:33:02,013
I feel that the law
and order here..

899
01:33:02,111 --> 01:33:05,854
.. are not made to get
people like us justice.

900
01:33:07,216 --> 01:33:08,854
But for the convenience
of the elite.

901
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:13,258
No lawyer is ready
to take up my case!

902
01:33:15,057 --> 01:33:17,867
I have got tired of cursing
this bloody law!

903
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:21,041
I'll go and ask that tycoon
Krishna Prasad..

904
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:24,202
...' You favoured us only
to humiliate us?!'

905
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,873
Mr. K.P I'm here to beg you
to have my son released.

906
01:33:28,237 --> 01:33:32,413
Some favours you did on us
willingly, some I wish to beg!

907
01:33:32,508 --> 01:33:35,546
Krishna Prasad only gives
alms to beggars!

908
01:33:36,178 --> 01:33:38,215
But you are one of
those beggars"

909
01:33:38,314 --> 01:33:40,294
.. who are only worthy
of being chided.

910
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:42,487
I know not what the
truth is, sir.

911
01:33:42,585 --> 01:33:44,292
But all I know is that"

912
01:33:44,387 --> 01:33:46,230
.. if once a big tycoon
like you alleges"

913
01:33:46,322 --> 01:33:48,233
"anyone of being guilty"

914
01:33:48,324 --> 01:33:50,395
.. then no one can
prove him innocent!

915
01:33:50,493 --> 01:33:52,495
Your wrath has broken
my spine, sir.

916
01:33:53,095 --> 01:33:56,907
I beseech you, spare
my son Deepak!

917
01:33:56,999 --> 01:33:59,104
lnspite of knowing that
he humiliated me?!

918
01:34:00,102 --> 01:34:02,082
Stole lakhs of rupees
from my company?!

919
01:34:02,171 --> 01:34:04,913
I'm not one of those who
can live happily"

920
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:08,580
.. even after losing their
honour and wealth! Got it?!

921
01:34:09,278 --> 01:34:11,918
Have mercy on me.
I have got tired.

922
01:34:12,348 --> 01:34:16,592
I can't shoulder the burden
of humiliation.

923
01:34:17,553 --> 01:34:19,260
spare my son!

924
01:34:24,293 --> 01:34:25,931
Fine.

925
01:34:27,129 --> 01:34:28,938
I will have your son released.

926
01:34:30,966 --> 01:34:32,946
Send your daughter-in-law to me.

927
01:34:36,138 --> 01:34:37,947
Scoundrel!

928
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:43,017
This not a poor man's neck.

929
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,018
But a tycoon's collar.

930
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:49,962
Throw him out!
- Scoundrel!

931
01:34:52,254 --> 01:34:56,430
First you trapped my son. Now
you ask for my daughter-in-law?!

932
01:34:56,525 --> 01:34:58,300
I thought you were an angel"

933
01:34:58,394 --> 01:35:01,307
.. but you turned out to
be just a human being?

934
01:35:01,397 --> 01:35:03,968
That too of a low caliber!!

935
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,976
May you be dammed!
May you be ruined!

936
01:35:07,169 --> 01:35:09,376
People will spit on
your existence!

937
01:35:10,406 --> 01:35:12,977
And condemn you for your deeds!

938
01:35:13,175 --> 01:35:18,318
This is my curse!

939
01:35:29,191 --> 01:35:31,501
Bravo, Krishna Prasad!

940
01:35:33,295 --> 01:35:37,004
Today I learnt that a man
staying in such a huge palace"

941
01:35:37,099 --> 01:35:40,012
.. can be <i>so</i> small
in stature too.

942
01:35:40,536 --> 01:35:44,006
The one whom you couldn't
achieve through your love..

943
01:35:44,106 --> 01:35:47,178
.. you want to achieve her
through deceit and fraud?!

944
01:35:48,444 --> 01:35:52,187
Today I learnt that behind
this innocent face..

945
01:35:52,281 --> 01:35:55,353
.. lives a devil, a sadist?
- Master! - Don't shout!

946
01:35:56,385 --> 01:35:58,365
No doubt you have been
ditched in love..

947
01:35:58,454 --> 01:36:00,195
.. but you know not the
philosophy of love!

948
01:36:00,389 --> 01:36:04,201
It's beyond you. I came here
to darn your pranks"

949
01:36:04,293 --> 01:36:07,035
.. not your impudence!

950
01:36:07,229 --> 01:36:09,038
I'm going!
- Get lost!

951
01:36:10,466 --> 01:36:12,377
I don't need anyone!

952
01:36:13,469 --> 01:36:18,543
When I didn't feel hurt when
those living my heart left me.

953
01:36:19,241 --> 01:36:21,721
Then why should I bother about
those leaving my house?

954
01:36:23,245 --> 01:36:27,216
You can only darn clothes"

955
01:36:27,316 --> 01:36:32,732
.. not ones broken
hearts! Go away!

956
01:36:36,258 --> 01:36:38,238
I don't need anyone!

957
01:36:59,448 --> 01:37:01,086
Father.

958
01:37:02,451 --> 01:37:04,089
What did Krishna Prasad say?

959
01:37:05,287 --> 01:37:08,598
What else? He will
get Deepak released.

960
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:11,168
After all he too
is someone's son.

961
01:37:11,527 --> 01:37:14,269
He too must be knowing
that how the injustice"

962
01:37:14,363 --> 01:37:17,776
"caused to the son make
the father writhe and cry.

963
01:37:18,734 --> 01:37:20,441
What did he say, father?

964
01:37:20,536 --> 01:37:22,106
Didn't I say that he will
get him released?

965
01:37:25,307 --> 01:37:27,116
Father!

966
01:37:28,644 --> 01:37:30,521
My face is not covered
with my veil.

967
01:37:32,314 --> 01:37:35,124
Therefore I can see tears of
humiliation in your eyes.

968
01:37:35,417 --> 01:37:41,459
Dear. - There's something
that you cannot tell me.

969
01:37:41,557 --> 01:37:42,126
Tell me, father.

970
01:37:42,758 --> 01:37:45,739
What is more grief striking
than the grief of a husband?

971
01:37:45,828 --> 01:37:47,637
Which a wife cannot sniff.

972
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:50,734
Listen to me, dear.
- I understand you, father.

973
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,138
But is it that Krishna
Prasad does not"

974
01:37:53,235 --> 01:37:54,543
"want to release my husband.

975
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:55,808
Or is it that you don't
want to release him.

976
01:37:55,904 --> 01:37:57,474
Yes, I don't want
to release him!

977
01:37:57,573 --> 01:38:03,148
No father would want to, by
staking his daughter's chastity!

978
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:10,159
Enough, father.

979
01:38:11,186 --> 01:38:13,496
I have got Krishna
Prasad's message.

980
01:38:15,257 --> 01:38:18,670
He has demanded me as bail
to have your son released.

981
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:22,171
Right?

982
01:38:22,698 --> 01:38:25,838
No, dear! You won't step
out of this house!

983
01:38:26,535 --> 01:38:28,572
My husband is in jail, father!

984
01:38:29,605 --> 01:38:32,347
I can't stand within the
confines of dignity..

985
01:38:32,441 --> 01:38:35,183
.. and see my husband being
tortured! I can't see!

986
01:38:36,812 --> 01:38:38,189
Daughter-in-law!

987
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:17,294
I'm here, Mr. K.P.

988
01:39:19,421 --> 01:39:21,901
But don't think I came
at your behest.

989
01:39:23,592 --> 01:39:25,230
It is my constraint that
has brought me here.

990
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:30,968
A wife reveres her
husband like God!

991
01:39:32,434 --> 01:39:34,914
And I'm ready to sacrifice
anything for my husband.

992
01:39:36,772 --> 01:39:38,251
Tell me.

993
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:41,250
What do you want, to
have him released?

994
01:39:43,545 --> 01:39:45,252
Tell me.

995
01:39:46,348 --> 01:39:48,259
Answer me.

996
01:39:48,617 --> 01:39:50,255
Your fidelity and religion
is business, isn't it?

997
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:55,932
Tell me, what should I remove?

998
01:39:58,894 --> 01:40:00,271
Bangles?

999
01:40:02,464 --> 01:40:04,273
This wedding chain?

1000
01:40:05,467 --> 01:40:07,674
Or.. this?

1001
01:40:39,501 --> 01:40:43,574
What do you think?
I need your body?

1002
01:40:45,841 --> 01:40:47,320
ls my love lewd?!

1003
01:40:52,614 --> 01:40:53,649
In-

1004
01:40:54,516 --> 01:40:56,496
I never loved your body..

1005
01:40:57,686 --> 01:40:59,324
.. but your soul.

1006
01:41:00,622 --> 01:41:03,831
But you? You never valued it!

1007
01:41:05,527 --> 01:41:07,336
You didn't wait for me.

1008
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:11,409
You forgot me like a passing
event and married someone else.

1009
01:41:19,975 --> 01:41:21,852
Both of us fell in love.

1010
01:41:22,778 --> 01:41:26,624
But sufferings came
only in my share.

1011
01:41:32,721 --> 01:41:34,701
Our relationship broke..

1012
01:41:36,792 --> 01:41:38,772
.. the day you got married.

1013
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:44,370
I had not come to your
house the other day"

1014
01:41:44,466 --> 01:41:46,537
.. to express my love for you.

1015
01:41:48,737 --> 01:41:52,708
And not even to give you an
account of my sorrows and grief.

1016
01:41:54,576 --> 01:41:57,557
But to ask forgiveness
from you for..

1017
01:41:57,646 --> 01:41:59,717
"what happened at the party"

1018
01:41:59,815 --> 01:42:02,796
.. which my aggrieved
heart did unknowingly.

1019
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:06,397
But you failed to understand
my sentiments.

1020
01:42:07,589 --> 01:42:10,570
And ridiculed me as though
I was a characterless man!

1021
01:42:11,827 --> 01:42:14,808
I didn't do that to seek
vengeance from you.

1022
01:42:15,764 --> 01:42:17,744
But to make you realise"

1023
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:21,076
.. that it is not
what you think!

1024
01:42:24,039 --> 01:42:28,078
There is no sin, no
lust in my heart!

1025
01:42:39,621 --> 01:42:43,763
The sorrow of love is heart
rendering, Madam Pooja.

1026
01:42:46,795 --> 01:42:48,604
I have forgiven you.

1027
01:42:50,632 --> 01:42:52,634
But if ever you are born
as a human being.

1028
01:42:54,636 --> 01:42:56,843
Think twice before
falling in love.

1029
01:43:37,913 --> 01:43:41,554
'I don't have any regrets
for anyone.'

1030
01:43:41,683 --> 01:43:45,825
'I don't have any
grudges for anyone.

1031
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:50,500
'I don't have any regrets
for anyone.'

1032
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:54,005
'I don't have any
grudges for anyone.

1033
01:43:55,697 --> 01:44:03,514
'It was not there in my destiny,
that is why I did not get it.'

1034
01:44:03,705 --> 01:44:07,778
'I don't have any
regrets for anyone.'

1035
01:44:07,876 --> 01:44:11,847
'I don't have any
grudges for anyone.

1036
01:44:12,948 --> 01:44:20,526
'It was not there in my destiny,
that is why I did not get it.'

1037
01:44:21,723 --> 01:44:29,540
'It was not there in my destiny
that is why I did not get it.'

1038
01:44:52,988 --> 01:44:57,164
Take this, priest. Use this
for your daughter's wedding.

1039
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,743
'I could not get you.'

1040
01:45:08,837 --> 01:45:12,580
'But I have at least
got the assurance.'

1041
01:45:13,775 --> 01:45:17,245
'I could not get you.'

1042
01:45:17,779 --> 01:45:21,249
'But I have at least
got the assurance.'

1043
01:45:22,784 --> 01:45:30,601
'When the seasons came,
the buds also blossomed.'

1044
01:45:35,897 --> 01:45:43,213
'The desire which I had,
never blossomed.'

1045
01:45:44,806 --> 01:45:52,122
'The desire which I had,
never blossomed.'

1046
01:45:53,315 --> 01:46:00,631
'It was not there in my destiny,
that is why I did not get it.'

1047
01:46:01,823 --> 01:46:09,969
'It was not there in my destiny,
that is why I did not get it.'

1048
01:46:47,369 --> 01:46:55,754
'The bright reflecting
days of my memories.'

1049
01:46:55,877 --> 01:47:04,194
'The bright reflecting
days of my memories.'

1050
01:47:05,053 --> 01:47:13,700
'These days of loneliness
do not pass.'

1051
01:47:17,999 --> 01:47:26,316
'It is not the matter
of love anymore.'

1052
01:47:26,908 --> 01:47:35,123
'It is not the matter
of love anymore.'

1053
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:43,893
'It was not there in my destiny,
that is why I did not get it.'

1054
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:47,897
'I don't have any regrets
for anyone.'

1055
01:47:48,029 --> 01:47:51,806
'I don't have any
grudges for anyone.

1056
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:56,844
'I don't have any regrets
for anyone.'

1057
01:47:56,938 --> 01:48:00,750
'I don't have any
grudges for anyone.

1058
01:48:01,943 --> 01:48:09,259
'It was not there in my destiny,
that is why I did not get it.'

1059
01:48:10,385 --> 01:48:18,930
'It was not there in my destiny,
that is why I did not get it.'

1060
01:48:47,489 --> 01:48:53,132
Mr. Deepak! Congratulations for
being released! Have this.

1061
01:48:54,362 --> 01:48:58,811
I knew that you wouldn't
be in jail for too long.

1062
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,142
Because ones whose wife
is young and beautiful.

1063
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:07,217
Then what is jail, police
and law for him?

1064
01:49:07,342 --> 01:49:10,983
Meaning?
- I mean that your wife Pooja..

1065
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:15,425
.. staked everything
and got you released.

1066
01:49:16,017 --> 01:49:18,827
Scoundrel!
- Why are you catching my neck?

1067
01:49:20,021 --> 01:49:21,830
Go and catch Mr. K.P.'s neck.

1068
01:49:23,024 --> 01:49:27,495
In whose bedroom is hung
your wife's photograph.

1069
01:49:28,029 --> 01:49:30,509
And he worships it daily.

1070
01:49:32,033 --> 01:49:33,842
Burns incense sticks.

1071
01:49:34,202 --> 01:49:36,011
Go young man.

1072
01:50:24,252 --> 01:50:26,892
Son, truth always triumphs!

1073
01:50:27,088 --> 01:50:30,069
Your honesty finally showed
its true colour.

1074
01:50:33,261 --> 01:50:34,899
No, father.

1075
01:50:36,097 --> 01:50:38,236
I have not been released on
the basis of my honesty.

1076
01:50:39,267 --> 01:50:41,907
To have me released your
daughter-in-law"

1077
01:50:42,003 --> 01:50:44,916
.. paid a price.

1078
01:50:59,554 --> 01:51:02,091
Are these tears of happiness
on seeing me..

1079
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:05,933
.. or of sorrow for being
separated from K.P?

1080
01:51:07,128 --> 01:51:08,937
Must be of sorrows.

1081
01:51:09,364 --> 01:51:12,937
Because you love Krishna Prasad.

1082
01:51:13,301 --> 01:51:16,475
No, Deepak. It is not that.

1083
01:51:18,139 --> 01:51:21,143
It's a lie!
- Even I thought that first!

1084
01:51:21,576 --> 01:51:26,116
But when I saw your picture
in his chamber"

1085
01:51:26,214 --> 01:51:30,287
.. I understood howl
got released so easily?

1086
01:51:37,325 --> 01:51:39,134
His kissing you amidst
a whole gathering.

1087
01:51:39,394 --> 01:51:42,637
And then coming to meet
you in my absence.

1088
01:51:43,164 --> 01:51:45,235
Sending me to jail for
having revolted!

1089
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,971
If it is not love
then what is it?!

1090
01:51:49,537 --> 01:51:53,383
After I went to jail you
continued meeting him daily.

1091
01:51:54,609 --> 01:51:56,987
And after he got satisfied
he released me..

1092
01:51:57,078 --> 01:51:59,490
.. and became God in your eyes!

1093
01:52:00,181 --> 01:52:02,491
No, Deepak. It's nothing
of that sort.

1094
01:52:03,084 --> 01:52:06,156
Believe me.
- If it is not that"

1095
01:52:06,254 --> 01:52:07,995
.. then why did you go to meet
him when I was in jail?

1096
01:52:08,189 --> 01:52:12,160
To have you released. -Father
could do the needful! - Yes!

1097
01:52:13,194 --> 01:52:17,267
But despite his several attempts
K.P. refused to release you.

1098
01:52:17,432 --> 01:52:19,605
Then how did he agree
at your behest?

1099
01:52:21,636 --> 01:52:24,014
What was the reason"

1100
01:52:24,105 --> 01:52:29,020
..that he acquitted me of the
accusation after meeting you?

1101
01:52:33,548 --> 01:52:37,291
That is because you
love each other.

1102
01:52:41,122 --> 01:52:43,534
Krishna Prasad could
do me no harm.

1103
01:52:44,325 --> 01:52:47,238
But you left me nowhere.

1104
01:52:49,464 --> 01:52:53,207
If your lover is dear to
you than your husband.

1105
01:52:54,669 --> 01:52:56,376
Then I free you.

1106
01:52:57,238 --> 01:53:00,048
Go and get married to him!

1107
01:53:01,476 --> 01:53:05,049
Do you know what you are
saying? - Very well!

1108
01:53:07,749 --> 01:53:09,387
You know nothing.

1109
01:53:11,252 --> 01:53:13,562
What you just said with
<i>so</i> much confidence.

1110
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:17,729
I can't even dream of it.

1111
01:53:22,096 --> 01:53:26,067
I'm your wife, believe me.

1112
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:32,749
You are absolutely mistaken.

1113
01:53:34,442 --> 01:53:36,581
Believe me, Deepak.

1114
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:42,759
Believe me. - Now it is
futile explaining to me.

1115
01:53:43,384 --> 01:53:46,695
I don't cover myself
with a used blanket.

1116
01:53:47,388 --> 01:53:51,495
An ideal wife is one who dies
for the sake of her husband.

1117
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:54,265
One who meets her lover in the
absence of her husband"

1118
01:53:54,362 --> 01:53:57,275
.. is not a wife but a slut!

1119
01:53:57,732 --> 01:54:04,115
And no man can ever endure
a slut as his wife!

1120
01:54:11,312 --> 01:54:13,121
You'll regret!

1121
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:18,121
Before I lose my patience.

1122
01:54:18,486 --> 01:54:22,127
Get out of my sight!

1123
01:54:30,331 --> 01:54:32,641
<i>A woman is Ska“</i>

1124
01:54:33,501 --> 01:54:37,472
.. till her husband is Ram.

1125
01:54:38,339 --> 01:54:40,819
But the day this image breaks.

1126
01:54:41,175 --> 01:54:43,655
She becomes such a puzzle..

1127
01:54:44,579 --> 01:54:46,559
.. which no man can solve!

1128
01:55:18,613 --> 01:55:22,356
I have no right to ask
about your past but..

1129
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:26,364
.. I'd like to know
what is the reason"

1130
01:55:26,454 --> 01:55:29,697
.. that you forgot Krishna?

1131
01:55:31,559 --> 01:55:33,197
I forgot him..

1132
01:55:34,562 --> 01:55:36,269
.. because I had got
married to Deepak.

1133
01:55:36,364 --> 01:55:39,208
Yes, but why did
you marry Deepak?

1134
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:42,381
You loved Krishna. - Yes.

1135
01:55:44,572 --> 01:55:46,552
But because of that love..

1136
01:55:46,641 --> 01:55:49,212
.. many lives were
getting ruined.

1137
01:55:50,511 --> 01:55:55,221
I had lost my pride, prestige
before the society.

1138
01:55:57,251 --> 01:55:59,561
I burnt <i>so</i> much in Krishna's
thought"

1139
01:55:59,654 --> 01:56:01,565
.. that had there been
a stone in my..

1140
01:56:01,656 --> 01:56:03,897
"place it would turn to ash.

1141
01:56:04,659 --> 01:56:06,400
Unfortunately I didn't..

1142
01:56:06,761 --> 01:56:09,241
Because I knew that he
would come one day.

1143
01:56:09,764 --> 01:56:15,237
Five years passed by, neither
did he come nor sent any letter.

1144
01:56:18,606 --> 01:56:20,643
Then my parents got worried
about my marriage.

1145
01:56:23,444 --> 01:56:26,755
One day I received Krishna's
letter which said.

1146
01:56:27,949 --> 01:56:29,257
'Forget me' .

1147
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:34,657
Then I had no other
excuse to wait.

1148
01:56:36,457 --> 01:56:38,596
Besides, girls are born..

1149
01:56:38,693 --> 01:56:40,866
.. only to make sacrifices.

1150
01:56:41,963 --> 01:56:45,274
I had to acquiesce to
my parents wishes.

1151
01:56:46,467 --> 01:56:49,676
So didn't you get Krishna's
second letter?

1152
01:56:50,972 --> 01:56:52,280
Which second letter?

1153
01:56:54,475 --> 01:56:57,615
I don't know how many
letters he wrote to me.

1154
01:56:58,579 --> 01:57:01,287
But I only got one letter
in those five years.

1155
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:04,288
Which my father gave me.

1156
01:57:12,493 --> 01:57:14,302
Greetings.

1157
01:57:14,495 --> 01:57:16,566
My name is Chabban Master
I'm a darner.

1158
01:57:17,498 --> 01:57:19,307
What are you here for?

1159
01:57:21,335 --> 01:57:25,306
Ones whose face is not good
I don't show them the mirror.

1160
01:57:25,673 --> 01:57:28,313
But today I'm standing before
you like a mirror..

1161
01:57:28,409 --> 01:57:30,320
.. that is my constraint.

1162
01:57:31,612 --> 01:57:35,321
The government has imposed
ban on cutting trees.

1163
01:57:35,850 --> 01:57:37,659
But brides are still
being burnt.

1164
01:57:37,752 --> 01:57:39,493
And rich fathers like you
are responsible for it.

1165
01:57:40,688 --> 01:57:41,928
Who are more concerned about"

1166
01:57:42,023 --> 01:57:43,593
..their pride and not
their daughters.

1167
01:57:43,691 --> 01:57:46,501
What nonsense! - It's
not nonsense but..

1168
01:57:46,594 --> 01:57:50,007
.. I'm talking about Krishna
and your daughter!

1169
01:57:51,532 --> 01:57:53,842
Krishna had written two letters
to you, hadn't he?

1170
01:57:54,969 --> 01:57:58,416
One of his failure and the
other of his success.

1171
01:57:59,774 --> 01:58:01,685
You did convince her
for marriage by..

1172
01:58:01,776 --> 01:58:03,847
"showing her the former letter.

1173
01:58:05,546 --> 01:58:07,355
But the latter one?

1174
01:58:07,982 --> 01:58:12,522
What did you do? Tore
it away! Burnt it?!

1175
01:58:13,721 --> 01:58:16,531
This disgusting act
and diplomacy"

1176
01:58:16,624 --> 01:58:18,695
.. has ruined both their lives.

1177
01:58:21,562 --> 01:58:23,769
Bad luck not only
strikes the poor.

1178
01:58:23,898 --> 01:58:27,107
But even the rich.

1179
01:58:27,568 --> 01:58:29,377
What happened to my daughter?

1180
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:33,043
Nothing. Only her husband
threw her out of the house.

1181
01:58:34,008 --> 01:58:37,114
You are guilty but she has
been accused of crime.

1182
01:58:37,578 --> 01:58:39,649
Because of you. - What
do you wish to say?

1183
01:58:39,914 --> 01:58:42,394
That I should have got her
married to that pauper?!

1184
01:58:42,483 --> 01:58:44,724
Krishna is neither poor
now nor was he then"

1185
01:58:44,819 --> 01:58:47,060
.. when you got your
daughter married off.

1186
01:58:47,488 --> 01:58:50,560
Your short-sightedness
has made Pooja..

1187
01:58:50,658 --> 01:58:53,138
.. fall from the eyes of
her lover and her husband!

1188
01:58:53,494 --> 01:58:55,997
Shame on your ideals principles
and thoughts!

1189
01:58:56,097 --> 01:58:59,408
Shut up! Are you here
to humiliate me?

1190
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,946
Thank you stars that today
is not ‘Bakri-idd‘!

1191
01:59:02,703 --> 01:59:04,614
Or I would come with the
intention of slaughtering you.

1192
01:59:05,106 --> 01:59:07,416
But the problem is,
our religion does"

1193
01:59:07,508 --> 01:59:09,419
..not permit 'Haram' animals.

1194
01:59:10,611 --> 01:59:12,420
Disgusting!

1195
01:59:22,623 --> 01:59:26,435
Where is my daughter?
- Where is she? You ask me?

1196
01:59:27,461 --> 01:59:30,442
Then pick up the telephone
directory!

1197
01:59:30,531 --> 01:59:32,602
Come to the 'K' section.

1198
01:59:32,733 --> 01:59:37,182
There will be 40-50 lines of
K.P. group of industries.

1199
01:59:37,538 --> 01:59:40,610
And somewhere or the other
your daughter"

1200
01:59:40,708 --> 01:59:43,621
.. must be engaged with
her lover Krishna Prasad.

1201
01:59:44,812 --> 01:59:46,450
Scoundrel!

1202
01:59:50,818 --> 01:59:53,628
Where is my daughter Pooja?
Where have you hidden her?

1203
01:59:56,090 --> 02:00:00,630
Fire and fuel never get along.
Don't ruin her life!

1204
02:00:03,664 --> 02:00:05,644
Are you a heart patient?

1205
02:00:06,767 --> 02:00:12,080
I'm asking, because if I shout
hope you don't collapse.

1206
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,485
Don't shout!

1207
02:00:14,842 --> 02:00:17,482
I should be asking
you about my Pooja!

1208
02:00:17,678 --> 02:00:20,818
But did I ask you why you
got her married elsewhere?

1209
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:24,496
You bloody tea estate owner!

1210
02:00:24,852 --> 02:00:27,662
What your income must
be in a year"

1211
02:00:27,755 --> 02:00:30,759
.. we buy soaps to wash my
palace from that much money!

1212
02:00:30,858 --> 02:00:32,667
Take a look at this palace.

1213
02:00:33,127 --> 02:00:34,663
By the time your eyes
reaches its dome..

1214
02:00:34,762 --> 02:00:37,106
.. your head will fall
off from your shoulder.

1215
02:00:38,699 --> 02:00:39,837
What do you think?

1216
02:00:40,034 --> 02:00:42,571
That I sit here
in Pooja's grief?

1217
02:00:42,870 --> 02:00:46,909
Console my remorse heart.
No! I have no time!

1218
02:00:47,875 --> 02:00:52,187
Let alone Pooja, not even her
thoughts are allowed in.

1219
02:00:52,713 --> 02:00:55,023
Only I enter through the door.

1220
02:00:55,149 --> 02:00:57,595
.. and the air that
keeps me alive.

1221
02:00:57,818 --> 02:01:00,264
Do you see anything
else besides that?

1222
02:01:00,721 --> 02:01:03,702
Okay. Okay Krishna Prasad.

1223
02:01:04,058 --> 02:01:06,868
I'm going. But remember.

1224
02:01:07,728 --> 02:01:10,538
If my daughter has run
away because of you.

1225
02:01:10,831 --> 02:01:12,708
Then it will be too bad for you.

1226
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:14,538
Get going!

1227
02:01:16,737 --> 02:01:18,876
Disperse!

1228
02:01:32,153 --> 02:01:33,723
Dear.

1229
02:01:33,921 --> 02:01:35,730
Dear, what happened?

1230
02:01:36,090 --> 02:01:38,400
I raised you amongst flowers.

1231
02:01:38,926 --> 02:01:41,406
How did you get trapped
in thorns?

1232
02:01:43,431 --> 02:01:47,004
Fate decides ones life.

1233
02:01:48,369 --> 02:01:49,746
Not parents.

1234
02:01:53,274 --> 02:01:55,754
You raised me amongst flowers.

1235
02:01:56,944 --> 02:01:58,753
That was my fate.

1236
02:02:01,115 --> 02:02:02,924
Today I'm trapped in thorns!

1237
02:02:04,952 --> 02:02:06,761
This is my fate.

1238
02:02:06,987 --> 02:02:09,160
Come on, dear. Come with me.

1239
02:02:12,059 --> 02:02:17,771
A girls place after marriage
is with her in-laws.

1240
02:02:21,469 --> 02:02:24,109
And my in-laws have
shut <i>doors</i> on me.

1241
02:02:24,972 --> 02:02:29,045
So what? I'm still alive.

1242
02:02:29,977 --> 02:02:31,854
You will stay with me.

1243
02:02:31,979 --> 02:02:36,951
A girl goes to her parents
house soon after marriage"

1244
02:02:37,051 --> 02:02:40,464
.. is very unfortunate.

1245
02:02:41,822 --> 02:02:46,134
Dear, all that I have is yours.

1246
02:02:46,327 --> 02:02:49,137
All your materialistic things
won't help me lead my life.

1247
02:02:51,232 --> 02:02:52,973
One can lead a happy life..

1248
02:02:53,067 --> 02:02:55,809
.. when you have something
of you own.

1249
02:02:56,437 --> 02:03:00,544
And I don't have anything left.

1250
02:03:02,343 --> 02:03:05,552
I didn't get what I desired.

1251
02:03:07,348 --> 02:03:11,228
And what you gave
is no more mine.

1252
02:03:12,019 --> 02:03:14,829
Dear. - After getting
me married"

1253
02:03:14,922 --> 02:03:16,833
.. your duty has
been fulfilled.

1254
02:03:18,926 --> 02:03:21,429
Now you shouldn't bother about
my sorrows and happiness.

1255
02:03:25,032 --> 02:03:26,841
Besides.

1256
02:03:27,201 --> 02:03:29,841
I'm an educated girl
of the 21 st century.

1257
02:03:31,205 --> 02:03:35,517
I may be small for my father
but not for the world.

1258
02:03:38,212 --> 02:03:39,850
Deepak is my husband.

1259
02:03:41,215 --> 02:03:43,923
I left the house to
respect his decision.

1260
02:03:46,387 --> 02:03:50,460
After he <i>cools</i> down I'll
will make him see reason.

1261
02:03:51,492 --> 02:03:52,869
Yet if he doesn't agree.

1262
02:03:55,396 --> 02:03:59,867
I will give him a divorce
not demand for it.

1263
02:04:07,074 --> 02:04:08,883
Leave me alone.

1264
02:04:09,243 --> 02:04:13,385
But dear you can do all
this by staying with me.

1265
02:04:14,081 --> 02:04:15,424
Mr. Dindayal.

1266
02:04:15,516 --> 02:04:18,053
Till children don't step down
from their parents laps"

1267
02:04:18,152 --> 02:04:20,063
.. they don't learn to walk.

1268
02:04:21,322 --> 02:04:27,568
Give them a chance to walk
and face hardships of life.

1269
02:04:29,196 --> 02:04:31,403
She is your daughter, you
have a right on her.

1270
02:04:32,099 --> 02:04:36,070
But you don't have a right to
take decisions about her life.

1271
02:04:37,104 --> 02:04:39,243
So it is better if you leave.

1272
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:52,927
Welcome, master!

1273
02:04:54,288 --> 02:04:56,325
Have you also lost something?

1274
02:04:58,125 --> 02:05:00,662
I have, but I don't even
wish to look for it.

1275
02:05:02,029 --> 02:05:06,944
Because I have fallen from
someones eyes and vice versa.

1276
02:05:07,134 --> 02:05:08,340
Well done.

1277
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:11,950
Tell me what brings you here?

1278
02:05:13,374 --> 02:05:15,285
Your interference again"

1279
02:05:15,376 --> 02:05:18,619
.. has caused an upheaval
in Pooja's life.

1280
02:05:19,513 --> 02:05:21,356
Her husband has thrown
her out of the house.

1281
02:05:21,982 --> 02:05:24,292
She is left nowhere.

1282
02:05:24,485 --> 02:05:26,362
What can I do?

1283
02:05:27,154 --> 02:05:30,135
She hasn't done too good
with me either"

1284
02:05:30,224 --> 02:05:33,637
.. that I should sympathize
with her and shed tears.

1285
02:05:34,395 --> 02:05:36,306
How many years do girls
have in life..

1286
02:05:36,397 --> 02:05:38,308
"after reaching adolescence?
Ten years.

1287
02:05:39,166 --> 02:05:42,306
And five years she wasted
waiting for you.

1288
02:05:43,337 --> 02:05:47,308
And whatever she did was not
willing but her helplessness.

1289
02:05:49,610 --> 02:05:53,148
Pooja's father's diplomacy
was behind your separation.

1290
02:05:54,348 --> 02:05:58,160
He didn't give her your letter
of success but burnt it.

1291
02:05:59,353 --> 02:06:02,994
Forced her to marry by showing
her your letter of failure.

1292
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:06,330
In which you had told
Pooja to forget you.

1293
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:13,339
Whom should I believe
what should I regret.

1294
02:06:14,201 --> 02:06:17,341
My accursed fate has brought
me at this stage.

1295
02:06:19,206 --> 02:06:21,015
I beseech you.

1296
02:06:21,542 --> 02:06:23,351
Save Pooja's life from
getting ruined.

1297
02:06:35,389 --> 02:06:37,027
<i>Pooh dear.</i>

1298
02:06:42,796 --> 02:06:45,208
A man who made a laughing
stock out of me.

1299
02:06:47,234 --> 02:06:50,545
You brought that very man
here, to laugh at me?

1300
02:06:50,637 --> 02:06:52,048
<i>No, Pooh dear.</i>

1301
02:06:52,406 --> 02:06:55,216
May the ones who laugh
at you go to hell.

1302
02:06:56,477 --> 02:06:58,388
Dear I agree that a
wind that destroys"

1303
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:00,550
"houses is called a tornado.

1304
02:07:01,248 --> 02:07:05,719
But not every wind that
blows is harmful.

1305
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:09,230
I had not begged for
support, Master.

1306
02:07:09,590 --> 02:07:12,332
I don't want to cry over
my sorrows before anyone.

1307
02:07:12,426 --> 02:07:15,236
After becoming someone's wife..

1308
02:07:15,329 --> 02:07:19,334
.. if you cry over my shoulder
I won't like it either, Pooja.

1309
02:07:20,501 --> 02:07:23,243
I have come here not
to wipe your tears"

1310
02:07:23,337 --> 02:07:26,079
.. but to atone
for my mistakes.

1311
02:07:27,441 --> 02:07:29,079
Actually.

1312
02:07:29,443 --> 02:07:32,253
Somewhere in the comer
of my heart I feel..

1313
02:07:32,346 --> 02:07:35,350
.. that I was not right by
calling you to my house.

1314
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:38,430
But neither was I wrong.

1315
02:07:39,286 --> 02:07:42,426
My house has got caught in the
fire of misunderstanding.

1316
02:07:43,791 --> 02:07:46,101
And this fire is very heartless.

1317
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:48,098
It burns both the one
who has lit it..

1318
02:07:48,195 --> 02:07:50,106
"and one who tries
to put it off.

1319
02:07:50,197 --> 02:07:53,610
Don't burn your hands in trying
to save me. Go away!

1320
02:07:53,801 --> 02:07:56,111
Now what is left to get burnt?

1321
02:07:58,305 --> 02:08:01,286
'Every place in my heart
is filled with sorrow'.

1322
02:08:02,309 --> 02:08:05,449
'Cry not over me if
I die tomorrow'.

1323
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,620
Come with me, Pooja.

1324
02:08:48,355 --> 02:08:49,561
Wait, Deepak.

1325
02:08:49,723 --> 02:08:53,170
Are you here to further
strengthen my misunderstanding?

1326
02:08:53,694 --> 02:08:56,174
Now I have no second thoughts.

1327
02:08:56,597 --> 02:09:01,171
Your hands clasped together
is a proof in itself.

1328
02:09:03,370 --> 02:09:06,351
My father thought that the
bride coming to my house.

1329
02:09:06,473 --> 02:09:08,714
.. will bring along good
luck and fortune.

1330
02:09:09,543 --> 02:09:13,855
But instead we've lost our
honour and prestige.

1331
02:09:14,281 --> 02:09:16,192
You have lost nothing, Deepak.

1332
02:09:16,383 --> 02:09:20,593
Don't rake up the past.

1333
02:09:20,754 --> 02:09:23,360
A husband whose wife leaves
him for another man"

1334
02:09:23,457 --> 02:09:26,461
.. has nothing left to save.

1335
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,597
You are mistaken, Deepak.
It is not true.

1336
02:09:28,695 --> 02:09:32,734
What is not true? Isn't it that
you became rich to achieve her?!

1337
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:35,380
Isn't it true, that without
giving an interview..

1338
02:09:35,469 --> 02:09:39,383
.. you gave me a car and
bungalow because of her?!

1339
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:43,381
Isn't it true that when you
couldn't meet her openly..

1340
02:09:43,477 --> 02:09:47,948
.. you accused me of fraud
and sent me to jail?!

1341
02:09:49,416 --> 02:09:53,421
If all this is true then your
love story cannot be false.

1342
02:09:53,854 --> 02:09:55,390
Yes, it is not false.

1343
02:09:57,424 --> 02:09:59,233
It is true..

1344
02:09:59,793 --> 02:10:02,399
.. that Pooja was my
first and last desire.

1345
02:10:04,431 --> 02:10:06,240
But I couldn't achieve her.

1346
02:10:07,434 --> 02:10:09,243
My stars were unfavourable.

1347
02:10:10,537 --> 02:10:14,417
You were fortunate that you got
her without desiring for her.

1348
02:10:15,442 --> 02:10:18,912
I was less fortunate that I
lost her though I desired for her.

1349
02:10:21,448 --> 02:10:24,258
Thousands of hands rise
up for prayers.

1350
02:10:24,818 --> 02:10:26,923
But not everyone's prayers
get answered.

1351
02:10:28,555 --> 02:10:30,762
Marriage with her was
written in your fate.

1352
02:10:31,558 --> 02:10:33,595
Whereas her incomplete love
was written in mine.

1353
02:10:35,629 --> 02:10:38,439
Your incomplete love is
ruining my marriage.

1354
02:10:39,466 --> 02:10:41,776
She still belongs to you
by heart and soul.

1355
02:10:42,836 --> 02:10:46,443
She was in my house but
in her heart, were you.

1356
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:48,281
Don't shout!

1357
02:10:48,642 --> 02:10:51,680
You have got tired of
worshipping her photograph!

1358
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:54,288
Go and worship her!

1359
02:10:54,715 --> 02:10:57,286
If she has got a man I
can also get a woman!

1360
02:10:58,585 --> 02:11:00,895
There is no place for
sluts in my housel!

1361
02:11:02,489 --> 02:11:03,832
Don't you dare abuse me!!

1362
02:11:03,924 --> 02:11:07,303
Sita won't go through a fiery
ordeal every time! - But Ram!

1363
02:11:08,395 --> 02:11:13,037
In every decade won't endure
Havana's shadow on his wife!

1364
02:11:14,501 --> 02:11:16,310
What shadow are you
talking about?

1365
02:11:17,671 --> 02:11:22,711
When Sita married Ram she
belonged to him only!!

1366
02:11:24,945 --> 02:11:28,483
When I loved Krishna I
belonged to him only.

1367
02:11:28,682 --> 02:11:31,925
But when I married you
I forgot Krishna.

1368
02:11:35,522 --> 02:11:37,729
Every girl in this world
falls in love.

1369
02:11:39,526 --> 02:11:41,335
So did I.

1370
02:11:43,530 --> 02:11:46,943
They get married too <i>so</i> did l.

1371
02:11:47,701 --> 02:11:49,738
If the two of you are
right in your place.

1372
02:11:50,771 --> 02:11:52,512
Then I'm not wrong either.

1373
02:11:52,973 --> 02:11:55,510
I also have a right to lead
life the way I want.

1374
02:11:56,543 --> 02:11:59,023
But because of you too my
life has become a hell!

1375
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:01,689
You have left me nowhere.

1376
02:12:02,916 --> 02:12:06,523
You have brought me at such
a juncture of life..

1377
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:11,035
.. where I don't know what
my beginning and end is?!

1378
02:12:11,925 --> 02:12:15,532
Your beginning is this
lover of yours.

1379
02:12:16,463 --> 02:12:18,966
And you yourself are your end.

1380
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:22,375
I have broken all
relations with you.

1381
02:12:22,569 --> 02:12:24,378
Now even if you walk behind me.

1382
02:12:25,405 --> 02:12:27,646
Yet I shall refuse
to acknowledge you.

1383
02:12:32,579 --> 02:12:34,559
These relationships cannot
be easily broken.

1384
02:12:36,583 --> 02:12:38,392
Look at me.

1385
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:41,556
This Krishna Prasad"

1386
02:12:42,589 --> 02:12:46,560
Your boss, inspite of standing
before the lord..

1387
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:49,402
.. kneels before you.

1388
02:12:51,698 --> 02:12:55,942
What I'm going to ask from you,
I could've asked from God.

1389
02:12:56,603 --> 02:12:59,675
But I know that
he won't give me.

1390
02:13:00,774 --> 02:13:03,414
Because hitherto he has
never given me anything.

1391
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:05,421
He has only snatched everything.

1392
02:13:05,979 --> 02:13:08,823
Look Deepak, I maybe mad.

1393
02:13:09,616 --> 02:13:13,428
Because I'm a lover. But
you are a married man.

1394
02:13:13,954 --> 02:13:16,434
Such a behaviour with Pooja
is unbecoming of you.

1395
02:13:16,623 --> 02:13:20,093
Don't punish Pooja for my sins.

1396
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:24,767
At least respect her honour
if not my atonement.

1397
02:13:26,633 --> 02:13:29,443
l.. I won't let you
leave her and go.

1398
02:13:30,637 --> 02:13:32,446
Get lost!

1399
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:36,450
I'm not <i>so</i> weak that
I cannot stop you.

1400
02:13:37,811 --> 02:13:39,449
Then try me.

1401
02:13:39,813 --> 02:13:42,851
You spend nights with her and
I should give her my name?!

1402
02:13:45,018 --> 02:13:47,624
Rascal! You spoke <i>so</i>
lowly about Pooja?!

1403
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:09,821
And you say that I reside
in her heart?

1404
02:14:10,844 --> 02:14:14,155
Where is that heart now?

1405
02:14:15,115 --> 02:14:17,652
Hey, she is a typical
Indian woman, buddy.

1406
02:14:18,685 --> 02:14:21,495
Yes, I can do anything for her.

1407
02:14:22,689 --> 02:14:25,693
By anything I mean" Anything.

1408
02:14:26,693 --> 02:14:29,503
Do you see this? She
is has one eye.

1409
02:14:29,696 --> 02:14:32,677
She is very cruel. She doesn't
know what's right or wrong.

1410
02:14:32,799 --> 02:14:35,678
I'm worse than her. You fool..

1411
02:14:35,769 --> 02:14:39,114
.. if she loved me, she
wouldn't meet me in discreet.

1412
02:14:39,706 --> 02:14:41,049
She would leave you
and become the"

1413
02:14:41,141 --> 02:14:43,018
..owner of K.P. Group
of Industries.

1414
02:14:43,143 --> 02:14:46,681
Then what could you do? But
she won't do that. Know why?

1415
02:14:46,947 --> 02:14:48,688
This is India!

1416
02:14:48,949 --> 02:14:52,192
Women can never fall
from their honour.

1417
02:14:53,553 --> 02:14:57,695
Here, people fall in
love very easily.

1418
02:14:58,892 --> 02:15:00,929
But get married after
great consideration.

1419
02:15:02,729 --> 02:15:07,041
Caste! Creed! Class! Dignity!

1420
02:15:07,734 --> 02:15:10,715
Family! Status! Culture! Car!

1421
02:15:11,071 --> 02:15:12,550
Bank balance!

1422
02:15:15,742 --> 02:15:17,551
All these bloody things!
But what's the use?!

1423
02:15:18,778 --> 02:15:22,817
Her father didn't let me marry
her because I was poor.

1424
02:15:23,917 --> 02:15:26,295
He said, 'I will get her married
to someone of my own status'.

1425
02:15:26,753 --> 02:15:29,563
Did he? He got her married
to my worker!

1426
02:15:30,924 --> 02:15:34,235
Today in terms of money and
fame I'm better than her father!

1427
02:15:34,761 --> 02:15:36,900
What could I do?
This vermilion..

1428
02:15:36,997 --> 02:15:38,908
.. which I wanted to adorn
in her parting, is now...

1429
02:15:38,999 --> 02:15:42,242
.. stuck on my forehead
like my fate.

1430
02:15:43,003 --> 02:15:44,914
And you say that she loves me?

1431
02:15:46,773 --> 02:15:48,582
She only loves you.

1432
02:15:49,876 --> 02:15:54,120
She is as chaste and pure
like the holy Ganges.

1433
02:15:55,115 --> 02:15:57,095
I can see that but you can't.

1434
02:15:57,217 --> 02:16:00,255
Learn to trust. For on trust is
based the foundation of life.

1435
02:16:00,787 --> 02:16:04,098
It can turn a mere idol to God.

1436
02:16:04,791 --> 02:16:06,771
Tell me, do you trust her?

1437
02:16:08,695 --> 02:16:10,606
Tell me.

1438
02:16:11,798 --> 02:16:13,607
Do you?

1439
02:16:14,801 --> 02:16:16,678
DO you? Eh?

1440
02:16:16,803 --> 02:16:19,215
No? No?

1441
02:16:25,812 --> 02:16:27,621
What have you done?

1442
02:16:31,818 --> 02:16:34,628
The world demands proof.

1443
02:16:36,656 --> 02:16:40,627
And I had no other way
to prove the truth.

1444
02:16:45,832 --> 02:16:47,812
I did call Pooja home..

1445
02:16:49,069 --> 02:16:52,915
.. but that was not my lust.

1446
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:56,821
But my ego.

1447
02:16:59,279 --> 02:17:02,055
You can call me bad.

1448
02:17:04,017 --> 02:17:05,655
But not lowly.

1449
02:17:08,888 --> 02:17:12,665
My name is Krishna which
means 'Black'.

1450
02:17:12,859 --> 02:17:15,169
But you are Deepak (light).

1451
02:17:15,762 --> 02:17:19,175
In your light, you can
see Pooja's purity.

1452
02:17:24,871 --> 02:17:28,341
Dignity is the other
name for lord Ram.

1453
02:17:32,879 --> 02:17:38,420
'Do not surpass the limits
of love dear friends..'

1454
02:17:39,886 --> 02:17:44,028
...what one gets, is
all a matter of fate'.
