What's going on?
Your fathim's coming? Or not?

00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,040
Or will I speak to my fathim's fathim?

<br> 00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:00,890
What happened?

377
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,210
Are you okay?

378
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,420
I do not have anything. Who's he?
Where did I find it?

379
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,780
I went to the legal battle at Legion

380
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,500
From that point on, wherever I go
It's coming, Dad

381
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,480
Today I have to bargain

382
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,350
Did you go fishing with frogs? Yes, dad
Where is he?

383
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,790
Shoot him and kill him

384
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,070
What are you here?

385
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,980
There's a weapon that's inferior, sir

386
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,130
So

00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,190
I'm not free
I gave a word

390
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,690
Who are you words?

00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,070
Do not you want to ask me?

00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,110
But if you do not say it now, they are
Come on, kill me, sir

393
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,040
If they come here, I'll kill you

394
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,130
I'll tell you when I think
Then call me

395
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,300
Daughter's life. You come up with a mood
Is there a connection in that, sir?

396
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,720
Are you true?

397
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,290
Today I will pay the bill

398
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,160

Drink for you

403
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,690
You look like a dustbin
An international problem

404
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,940
What is international?

405
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,650
Tell us, sir. Use us
And taking the arkes

406
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,270
he's bullshit. Use it
Do not you show your daughter? Not showing

407
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,860
Who wants to be the girl?

408
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,050
Do not give pictures?
But should you marry?

409
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,520
Who really are you?

410
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,490
The scanner's on
So, what kind of mood needs you to get?

411
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,140
Is not that enough for your daughter?

412
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,290
I saw
Alone on the street

413
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,960
For example, there is super
There's a girl

414
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,580
What is it? Dude, our girl
A girl?

415
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,520
Coming

416
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,820
It was because they went to talk
Our one piece

417
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,740
Piece?
534
<br> 00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,750
That means your girlfriend is one.
R. Rahman?

418
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,220
I'm looking for relationships?

419
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,940
So close?
I do not like you from the first day

420
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,450
You're so haughty

421
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,320
Something is done for pride

422
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,710
I was angry and told my dad
If you see ...

423
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,250
Fathim will come and kill
Oh

424
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,390
I do not want you to die
is it?

425
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,300
I'm scared of you

426
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,740
he's bullshit. I showed you VitalkoIIy

427
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,280
Sander-in-Hand says

428
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,010
Then what is this?
So what do you do now?

429
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,980
Leave the village
Come on

430
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,200
Let's move your arrogance
There are everywhere

431
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,440
Right
To get rid of that pride

432
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,630
Then love
550
<br> 00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,620
Let's race
Shoot

433
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,590
Tomorrow

552
<br> 00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,200
Huang Chang Chang
There was a tourist

434
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,570
Until then, I do not know

435
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,080
him grandson Takamimoto

436
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,840
You do not know that I and my friends are the ones

437
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,470
We do not need to know

438
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,530
Our one is Sultan

439
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,710
He's coming to attack you

440
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,450
Maybe if one of us sticks to one of you
560
<br> 00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,410
Can not be
 - Is there a bet?

441
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,330
You tell me

442
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,290
If I lose, I leave this village
563
<br> 00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,070
If you win, you'll love me

443
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,250
Are you in love? Or not?
- All right
565
<br> 00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,960
Neighborhood

444
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,560
Taki, son

445
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,870
If there is such a son, Thakshi
Please come here
568
<br> 00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,420
Come on, tell him
Son, Takashi

00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,910
Come on
 - Come on, come on

447
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,620
Right now, that's right
571
<br> 00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,940
Who is this?

448
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,680
Nothing
 - Nothing

449
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,050
Killed
Finish it
574
<br> 00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,890
Mr. Takshini, we welcome

450
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,890
Open the door

451
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,200
Leave your hand
Leave

452
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,440
Talk to a god you know
It's you

453
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,970
What are you joking right now?

454
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,600
He'll kill me

455
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,570
Use this
581
<br> 00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,180
Use this

456
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,460
get up
Hey, taki, you'll be terrible.

457
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,040
to fall

458
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,040
Now let me have a straightforward idea
Do not do it

459
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,050
You promised
I cheated

460
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,090
Lied

461
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:59,880
The latest scam laptop benefits
A company that advertises that lets give 2000

462
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,420
There are millions of people around the country
The money has been paid

463
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,350
Because of my daughter's education
They gave them tired of days

464
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,030
After all, it knows it's a fake company

465
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,370
Everyone will cheat
Do we want to live? Do you need to die?

466
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,150
Hey Alia. Come on
Can you stop telling me?

467
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,260
Why stop it
I have a bank account here

468
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,130
I have an ATM card here
what?

469
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,600
Do you have a bank account here?
Yes

470
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,010
Do you know the bank?

471
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,670
Put a bank account here
You have to deposit at least Rs. 1,000 million

472
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,010
Rs 1000?

473
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,570
Do you have that much for the bitch?

474
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,940
What's up?
This is my bank

475
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,280
Paradise Bank is mine

476
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,230
Get out.
Nothing, nothing

477
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,690
My piece has a lot of money
That's for me

478
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,730
Leaving. We're building our lives
Do you have it?

479
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,270
Going

480
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,850
That girl cheated me again

481
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,830
Who?
What is he stopping me?

482
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,880
My bodyguard. Send now

483
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:21,660
Going

484
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,240
You're an asshole
Why Bodyguard?

485
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,020
You say. That's good
he went after the money. But why?

486
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,250
Wade does not work
What did you do?

487
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:36,820
Followed, I called
Fighting, singing, I danced with it

488
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,450
What more can you do? And this is money
Girls are too big

489
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,660
What is his fathim doing?
What did our dad do with us?

490
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,090
he has plenty of money
Tell me what to do

491
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,780
Money with money does not fit into money
Because they have money

492
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,180
I know it
That's what

493
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,600
Saying love, saying the kennel was after

494
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,450
You had to do a little job

495
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,880
That's why brothim
Money is for girls

496
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,590
It's a substandard thing
Hey

497
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,610
Girls whenever they want to
They do not even know

498
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,810
Suddenly settled in a shade
Or set a little poet

499
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,050
Poetry?

500
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:07,730
Just say one

501
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,560
Soul requires life

502
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,620
It takes hope to live

503
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,320
This is life and hope
You need a smile

504
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,580

00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:26,830

00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,770
That guy died

565
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,120
No matter how much they said

566
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,070
Shot

567
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,360
Who died
 - That crazy thing

568
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,540
What's he dead to?

569
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,110
He saw him a while ago

570
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:51,710
where is?

571
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:52,930
The gym

572
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,060
You have not died yet
You stopped for yourself

573
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:16,590
Freak

574
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,760
Addiction?

575
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,340
What's going on?
 - What did I do?

576
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,650
What's the matter

577
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,740
A billion of cells in the heart were driven

578
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,090
Everything is running
Get a little bit of this

579
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,400
If he did not even killing you

580
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,850
My heart stops

581
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,700

00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,380
I'll give a kiss

583
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,850
If I take love
It's impossible to endure

584
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,860
If you have a strong balance

585
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,940
Show

586
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,050
Will,
 - Not right?

587
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,960
The soul is life's life

588
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,470
It takes hope to live

589
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,430
This is the soul, the hopes
Your smile is uncomfortable

590
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,240
For that smile

591
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,070
Give me a break

592
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,140
Or somebody's gonna kill you

593
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,580
I ran away from my early childhood

594
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,360
Since then, I have not gone home

595
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,520
How are you, Mom and Dad?

00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,440
My mothim was with me until 8

604
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,040
Not after that

Your job is fine
Thank you, sir. Dad

616
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,880
I do not have that connection

617
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:11,290

618
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,280
That's why he likes it
I'm asking you not

619
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,050
I do not like Dad

620
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,870
What's that? Because of you
He liked this
749
<br> 00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,640

Which village?
Where have I come from?

626
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,850
I do not care about his background

00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,260
The soul is
759
<br> 00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,790
It takes hope to live

630
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,800
This is life and hope

631
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:49,650
You need a smile

632
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,560
I'm putting that smile into it

633
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,330
Or someone's hitting you

634
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,090

What's your problem?

645
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,800
It's not love

00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:15,510

682
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:04,570
Your fault
Are you still there, daughter?
814
<br> 01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,230
What did you see on TV?

683
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,090
He showed us all in our house

684
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,770
Oh, shut up
Everything's in the street

685
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,530
This is all because of him
Do you not understand?

686
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,270
What is this connection?

687
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:15,640
Oh, crazy

688
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,730
You were approaching home

689
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,990
I gave in to me

690
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,810
He did not come for you

691
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,010
For me

692
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:27,020
He's Grand Leo
The owner of the company

693
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,050
What do you know?

694
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,930
It's a web site
No one knows who that's doing it

695
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,970
What does he know?

696
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,720
In India, accidents, corruption, crimes

697
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,650
Everything will be uncovered

698
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:44,970
Early cricket schedules
This is what put it

699
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,280
The ChipFunds of Bengal

700
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,630
Gala Indians in Kerala

701
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,280
One? Two?
It's all over

702
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,560
I'm a congealist

703
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,070
He's a covered journalist

704
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,550
If you catch me, you will be arrested

705
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:00,080
If he hears it, kill him

706
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,900
No one knows what he looks like

707
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,410
You and me

708
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:07,530
Those are crazy media
It was taken to a separate place

709
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,970
What's him name?
I do not know

710
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,690
Not Kalyyan Ram

711
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,190
Where's my laptop?

712
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,300
where is?

713
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,160
If he takes my laptop
It's all over

714
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,180
Say

715
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,220
Did he take my laptop?
Or not?

716
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,750
The Grand Ledge's work
Fearen Javed Ibrahim

717
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,550
Just a while ago

718
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,660
There have been many enemies of my life

719
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,580
Police, thugs,

720
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,240
Knives brought bugs

721
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,990
he settles in here
Dala swore at me

722
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,330
He phoned to me from behind

723
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,230
I helped with that
My dad

724
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:05,500
I know your daughter
How much grief

725
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,820
How terrible you were?
Leave

726
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,410
He's both our enemies
859
<br> 01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,240
We both togethim
Kill him. Right

727
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,980
Right

728
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,640
Kill

729
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,960
Alia runs away

730
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,860
Why are you looking at it?
Can you? Or not?

731
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,850
You're.....
Mom, I'm sorry. Where did you go?

732
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:27,960
Do not attack. Where did you go?
Mothim. Mothim

733
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,550
If you stay here for so many days
What about us?

734
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,960
Say sorry
Why come now?

735
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,650
Why is your son coming to my mothim?
It's hungry

736
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:40,780
Divide the food

737
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:49,980
Available, available
Apaḍam

738
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:55,760
It's so hungry
Once a day, you can eat and eat

739
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:56,680
Apaḍam

740
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,260
You do not change

741
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:08,670
Those who protect the land are ours
A faction does not give up

742
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,950
Just be careful

743
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,870
Whenever the threat comes in
No one knows

744
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,480
My daughter escaped coming from India

745
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,710
Where to get there

746
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,540
Why come?
For a chariot

747
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,350
Tell me where you are
Let's kill him

748
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,660
He knows Jared Bhai's daughter?

749
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,290
And who did we do?

750
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:36,170
We take our batons

751
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,240
Is he uncle?
From farmers in this country

752
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,410
Do not listen to me, boy

753
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,560
How is your son?

754
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,890
Government's money
End up

755
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,880
Do not we eat?

756
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,910
I do not understand what I do

757
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,990
he's ashamed to live like this

758
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:23,570
But they're not looking at the farmer who gives Eve

759
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,870
Newspapers are always farmers
I've seen him die

760
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,650
Farmers are lonely
It's my baby

761
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:36,800
It's those who have the courage
Poison is dead

762
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,690
But people like us are alive, son

763
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,450
That's what our men said to us

764
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,140
Do not do this well

765
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,340
But he is
 - He's ...

766
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,300
What is that education?
 - The media

767
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,850
It's learned
That's why somebody can get better ....

768
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:56,810
You do not know
I do not know, son

769
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,110
Jawed about

770
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,720
Not over yet

771
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:12,900
There are many more to unveil

772
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,210
It's sad for the cricket squash
He looked for it

773
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,470
I found out
Cricket scramble is not anything

774
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,760
It's bigger than that

775
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:25,000
Every one is betrayed by the ass

776
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,350
He's in touch with him

777
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,890
They're all their black money

778
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,270
There, there's the bank

779
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,330
Who knows who owns it?
Javed Ibrahim

780
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,230
This is Jared's private lap

781
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,160
To enter this one

782
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,470
It needs information from a bank accountant

783
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:53,180
That's why his daughter Alia
Information was taken

784
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,270
That girl's account is hacked
We can go to that account

785
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,360
Bank server can go
And .....

786
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,880
Our archways are so vast
I can tell you

787
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,970
Are you ready?
Shall we try once? Yes

788
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,440
Let's go

789
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,880
1

790
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,640
2

791
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,560
3

792
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,490
That's the girl's account
Check it out

793
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:24,410
A lot of people are short

794
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,760
Only 536 billion is available

795
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,860
Now log on to the bank server

796
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,120
Where is your daughter?

797
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,290
What happened?

798
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,310
Someone is your daughter
Entered into the account

799
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:56,270
Now they're on our server
Attempting to enter

800
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:57,960
Where is it from?

801
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,560
Somewhere in the hydra.
Where is CycladGooda?

802
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:02,970
I'll send you the GPS

803
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,720
Hey jibal
Where are you from?

804
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,600
How long will it be?
Anothim 10 minutes

805
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:05,680
You do the same thing

806
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:15,310
To eat?

807
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:16,050
what?

808
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:18,830
Mothim asks
 - What is the menu?

809
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,890
There's anothim special thing
It's delicious

810
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:26,590
Who does the door?
Who knocks on the door. see

811
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,650
Who's dad right now?

812
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:31,610
Who is a girl?
 - A girl?

813
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,570
Ask who
 - Who's to see me, daughter?
947
<br> 01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,690
Your son needs it
 - It's okay

814
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:36,520
What's your name?

815
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,430
Name, name
Alia Khan

816
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:41,410
Alia Khanu
 - Alia Khan

817
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:46,130
Dad, you and I have no contact

818
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,370
Send him out quickly
It was not our house

819
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,880
What's he coming up with?

820
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:54,380
Where is your son?
A friend's house goes to comming mode

821
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:58,260
10 years pass
I did not bring my notebook back

822
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,160
Talk to him
Why is this daughter?

823
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,410
Are you a 10 year old boy?
Yes, please

824
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:03,600
He is a 10 year old boy

825
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,960
Your son cheated on me
He left me

826
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,880
Talk to your son in a good mood
We do not know where he is

827
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,050
Give the phone

830
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,110
Why did you leave me?

831
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,570
Why did you leave?
 - game over

832
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:29,700
Coming out. A loving girl
How are you leaving?

833
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:35,030
I do not love you
It's here to tell my eyes

834
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,550
So this is how

835
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:43,560
Hungry
Have anything to eat?

836
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:44,650
What's the daughter?

837
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,730
Have anything to eat?
Baḍaginiyilu

838
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:49,650
What do you want, daughter?

839
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,110
What's the menu?

840
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:52,180
What's the menu?

841
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:55,360
There is something special
It's a secret

842
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:59,910
Get the Grand Plains quickly

843
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:03,570
If this whole thing is coming out
The government is over

844
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:06,110
Not only the private sector

845
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:08,840
Even the state systems are hacking

846
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,630
Is this a big crime?

847
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,770
Come on, come on
982
<br> 01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,020
The list of Paradise Bank came

848
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:34,990
From today, tomorrow will be dying
If so, our death

849
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,720
Why so much money was added?

850
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:41,730
That party, this party is not
It's all there

851
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:43,590
Everybody has a place
987
<br> 01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,200
Fake all togethim
He has put a big thief in it

852
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,770
If you have a Paradise Bank account

853
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:53,020
Deadly world
Do you think so?

854
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:55,010
It's fake

855
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,960
Everybody counts billions of dollars

856

No one knows what he looks like

917
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:00,750
You did not send him a picture

918
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:03,670
CBI put it on the task board

919
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:06,210
All of the Cyber ​​Teams
He goes after

920
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,690
And a special officer for him

To ruin me

932
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,880
From the hunger they taught
It's your dad

933
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,270
he does not have much of this
I could not afford to eat

934
01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:25,110
Why do you know now?

935
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:33,220
That's about the government for that death
Because you can live by giving money

936
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:37,470
10 to eat
Unworthy education

937
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,300
What education?

938
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:45,760
What he says is true

939
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,890
Education that can not be eaten by 10 people

940
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,330
What education?

941
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,540
It's not working for that education

942
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:04,510
Bearing

943
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,540
Let's eat it all

944
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:45,240
What is Abeba Mass Media?

945
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:48,800
Getting the truth out of the way?

946
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:52,100
Those who destroy the land
To show?

947
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:53,580
What are we doing?

948
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:56,820
We left out the matter

949
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,210
It's just two days
Funny news

950
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,400
Then it will be forgotten by the state

951
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,080
People also forget

952
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,310
From now on we're not showing
I want to see

953
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,280
Mike is not playing

954
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,970
Run

955
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,860
The country has stolen money
They borrowed in the banks

956
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:24,060
Who asked me is not mine
Not mine

957
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,800
That's not the case
What's the deal?

958
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:28,890

959
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,130

Files and mailed them so far

961

Now, do it the same way
Let's get our money back

962
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:47,870
Our money is there
But there are locks

963
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:49,680
Lockdown

964
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,620
This should be done a lot

965
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:57,940
If you want to hit it, you should not have the lowest hackers in the 5 hierarchy

966
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:01,090
At the end, Paradise
There is not a bank there to be
1107
<br> 01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,110
Bank security from you
Who are working on the systems?

967
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:08,320
You need to guiding othims

968
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,770
remember
This is a war

969
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,700
Our money is back to war

970
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,330
Are you with me?

971
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,520
And in the same way
On the 12th

972
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:30,850
At 12.00

973
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:33,950
Tenerife is 6 hours behind

974
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,980
At 6:00 am

975
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,990
Everybody is tired

976
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,560
Systems are running

977
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,940
Server servers all over again
11:19
<br> 01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,000
It's time

978
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:47,710
Are you with me?

979
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:13,140
Son of a girl
Hold the gun

980
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,480
I am afraid

981
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,160
I count 100

982
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:21,660
Before then, you should be in front of me

983
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,470
Or the vine leaves

984
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:27,800
I'm Jade Bai's daughter

985
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,920
My fathim is palling

986
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:32,310

992
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:53,230
What are you hitting?
 - Wait on your mom

993
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,000
You did not even play much
My mind does not change
1136
<br> 01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,130
You said it
 - Your eyes are watching
1137
<br> 01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:08,050
I do not love you
I made magic. Cheating
1138
<br> 01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:09,560
Eve

994
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,010
It makes me sad
1140
<br> 01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:12,100
Right?

995
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,540
It's not working for that education

01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,330
Are you with me?

1025
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,520
And in the same way
On the 12th

1026
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:30,850
At 12.00

1027
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:33,950
Tenerife is 6 hours behind

1028
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,980
At 6:00 am

1029
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,990
Everybody is tired

1030
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,560
Systems are running

1031
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,940
Server servers all over again
11:19
<br> 01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,000
It's time

1032
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:47,710
Are you with me?

1033
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:13,140
Son of a girl
Hold the gun

1034
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,480
I am afraid

1035
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,160
I count 100

1036
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:21,660
Before then, you should be in front of me

1037
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,470
Or the vine leaves

1038
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:27,800
I'm Jade Bai's daughter

1039
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,920
My fathim is palling

1040
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:32,310
1

1041
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:34,230
2

1042
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:36,050
3

1043
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:37,800
4

1044
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:43,920
97

1045
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:45,520
98

1046
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:53,230
What are you hitting?
 - Wait on your mom

1047
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,000
You did not even play much
My mind does not change
1136
<br> 01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,130
You said it
 - Your eyes are watching
1137
<br> 01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:08,050
I do not love you
I made magic. Cheating
1138
<br> 01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:09,560
Eve

1048
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,010
It makes me sad
1140
<br> 01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:12,100
Right?

1049
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,290
You're grieving
Such feelings are weight loss
1142
<br> 01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,850
Do you know how many of your dad's been killed?

1050
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,520
You know how to play with a lot of lives?

1051
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,190
Then go get involved with my dad

1052
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,520
Why I played with me

1053
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,560
OK OK
What happened?

1054
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:27,230
Let's go, your time is over
Let's go

1055
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:31,340
I'm not leaving
 - What are you doing without going?

1056
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,900
Get out
- If my dad told you, he would do you a good job

1057
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:35,520
Come on

1058
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,990
I'll stay here
Tell me what to do

1059
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,230
Mom, where is him bag?
Going

1060
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:43,180
Get out

1061
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:52,170
Why did they come up?
This is the market

1062
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,380
Not your house
My wish

1063
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:59,720
What are you looking at?
 Look

1064
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:02,610
Do not make me guilty
Why do you know?

1065
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,070
You did wrong

1066
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,560
It feels right

1067
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,880
Let's go in, Mom
1161
<br> 01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,720
My son

1068
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,790
Kassai

1069
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:25,970
If you make a film with this

1070
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:29,660
It's gonna be fine

1071
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:34,660
Mothim, he lay down .....

1072
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:38,650
You eat a daughter

1073
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:41,490
Why should he go for something to eat?
From the top of the head

1074
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,050
That's not it
How did we get our house?

1075
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:49,210
You said
 - What's your mothim's name?

1076
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,080
Satyavatī
1,171
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:54,530
What a big criminal

1077
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,990
My mothim's name is not lying

1078
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:59,820
Help card office went to the office
It typed it

1079
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,280
The address came

1080
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,860
Right
It does not matter, anyway
1176
<br> 01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:07,980
Eat
Go to your house

1081
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:10,410
I'm here
What to do?

1082
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:12,790
I do not love you

1083
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,360
Say again
Eve

1084
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:16,990
Do you not understand?
Hey

1085
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,580
That's what you can not do
You can not fool

1086
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,170
We did not make you like that

1087
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:25,380
I do not know love, you silly idiots

1088
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:28,000
He's here
You go out

Who is he? What are you doing in there?

Javeid is in town
We kidnapped our Haradish

1091
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:18,930
Tune in Harish's phone right now

Where did you find yours?
Somewhere

1095
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,440
Do not ask me

1096
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:10,290
Give your daughter your daughter
I came to take the friend

1097

Dad

Take my daughter's neck. I'm trying to make love
Not funny

1099
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:19,500

Telling about Sathya
A lot of people here are crazy

One journalist, a journalist, a newspaper,

All hackers.
Very clever people

1150

Even the government

1151
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:55,960
What system is
As you can, it's easy to hack

1152
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:01,070

When he's in PM's koll,

1157
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,430
Why are not you, sir?

1158
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,680
It's all right
The way he did it was wrong

1159
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:27,520
This is about people's leaders
Trust is lost

1160
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:30,490
What is he doing?
Throw in something

1161
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,070
You're saying that terrorists are
Give the death sentence

1162
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,890
The whole country supports him

All media outlets are on his side
Now if he's sentenced to death

1164

The killer
The man who made the selections will kill him

01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:43,880
Release the holy one

01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:55,280
I've been in hiding for years

1167
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:59,150
he's here
My Paradise Bank was horrified

1168
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:01,770
Now I brought him to the street

1169
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:07,870
He does not come out of prison

1170
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,990
The prison will die

1171
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:12,440
What are you crying about?

1172
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:15,100
He made you too
He made me

01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:17,650
I got a nap

01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:20,160
Jared Bei's life is not scared
1273
<br> 01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:22,080
That rifle ...

1175
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:24,090
I asked for it, Dad

1176
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:24,750
what?

1177
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:27,330
But I do not care if Jared Beau is scared

1178
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:30,140
He and my husband
He said he wanted the way

1179
01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:32,920
If my dad violates the language

1180
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:34,190
I'm going to overwhelm me

1181
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:36,460
You know who I am

1182
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:39,060
I'm Jade Bai's daughter

1183
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:41,270
I'm jumping on this plane

1184
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:44,790
Aleya

1185
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:09,350
I came to see you

1186
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:12,140
All these days, we have a jar

1187
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:13,980
We did not sleep

1188
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:16,490
What are you getting, Raja?

1189
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:17,620
Have fun

1190
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:19,280
What?

1191
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:21,340
All my phones have been recorded

1192
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,040
What
I'm talking to Javed

1193
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,240
I'm talking to friends.
All

1194
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:30,370
Give me a thing like that

1195
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,440
Can you?
 - Not right?

1196
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,960
What's wrong with what?

1197
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,430
I'm scared of seeing you

1198
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,170
Trastavādīnget
It looks like a terrorist

1199
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:50,920
Test yourself
A special Commission was appointed

1200
01:43:51,570 --> 01:43:53,530
Do not talk crazy tomorrow

1201
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,120
Make a mistake

1202
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,180
That's not it

1203
01:43:57,870 --> 01:44:02,180
I'm only talking about live TV broadcasts
What's in live broadcast?

1204
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:05,000
In the commission of the Commission itself

1205
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:08,840
About me, my people
Talk about it

1206
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,210
You know about me

1207
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,480
Your friends are four

1208
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:13,060
All of them were killed

1209
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,300
Your fathim is also a journalist

1210
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:18,990
Putting him off

1211
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:22,230
Kill pieces and kill them

1212
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,470
he's in jail

1213
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:34,040
What is our plan now?

1214
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:36,390
I do not know

1215
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:37,970
Anyone know the code?

1216
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:39,030
not

1217
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:40,800
not

1218
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:42,510
not

1219
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:47,780
Ms Sathya Muthan who was hiding has been hiding

1220
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:50,050
In the Court of Arbitration
Let's go live

1221
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:56,150
Tell Truth to Martha a few cases
It's been wronged

1222
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,770
State property theft
1,322
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:01,450
Establishment of violence

1223
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:06,570
Explanation of security information and othim matters

1224
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,930
Why did you do this?

1225
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:17,820
You have lots of cases

1226
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:20,550
If you have something to say
Tell the Commission

1227
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:37,910
Sir my fathim is a media professional

1228
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:41,270
Name Dasrathram

1229
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:43,520
I was an underhand incident

1230
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:58,570
My favorite journalist
I do not like being scared

1231
01:45:59,170 --> 01:46:00,150
I felt sad

1232
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,870
Then there was anger

1233
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:05,860
That's the image
This is the Grand Leakey

1234
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:13,630
Those who destroy our country are not the only ones
There are othims who love the land

1235
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:16,430
Because of their support

1236
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,200
I could do these things

1237
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,700
I made 10 years to fix this

1238
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:21,750
Sir

1239
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:24,530
We got freedom, sir

1240
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:28,100
The British people are holding us
They beat them up and dragged them
1341
<br> 01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:29,390
But they are us

1241
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:33,300
Made roads, rails
I made it, building it, and made dam

1242
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:37,570
That's all for that? We are talking now
Court

1243
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,590
Their

1244
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:45,190
But after gaining independence, they are 100 times better than theirs
We are, we're lost

1245
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:53,640
Today, let's learn our children
It's not about the past

1246
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:56,890
About those who destroy us with us

1247
01:46:57,690 --> 01:46:59,300
Who is it?
 - You are

1248
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:03,470
To remove clothes like people like that

1249
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:05,630
This is the Grand Leakey

1250
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:18,770
Independent daily rupee price equates to $ 1

1251
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:22,330
That rupee we all have
I'm very tired

1252
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:24,430
It was brought to 65

1253
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:25,990
This is the reason

1254
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:28,050
Of frauds

1255
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:32,410
Whatever it is, the people will not get it

1256
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:35,120
Agricultural Skim, Medical Skills
Resen Skem

1257
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:39,120
Do not

1258
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:40,350
Loot the loot

1259
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:43,460
Cricket schedules, golf scouts
ChipFund Scam

1260
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,980
Attack each othim

1261
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,800
If we attack everything, we will
Life is different

1262
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:51,800
The shit did not change

1263
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:53,380
The rotation process did not change

1264
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:55,910
Because of hunger, farmers
The deaths did not change

1265
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:04,500
We also plunder the farmers' food

1266
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:05,690
Thimavada thieves

1267
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:11,080
Put the barges he was looking for
The houses, the Almara are not enough

1268
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,040
Tenerife, sir

1269
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,170
Paradise backs up

1270
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:16,930
It's not black money, sir

1271
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:18,880
Our tiredness
 - Our blood

1272
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:26,900
Our media is in the country
Everything is taken out

1273
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:30,940
But you did not do what you wanted to do
Not done

1274
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:32,010
That's why

1275
01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:34,940
What you're supposed to do
I decided to do it

1276
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:37,180

Exactly 2 minutes

1297
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:48,080
Hacking accounts of our big ones

1298
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:49,570
What is it?
 - What's the hack?

1299
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:50,790
Did you say to hack me?

1300
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:52,270
Who said hack?

1301
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:55,150
Hours, minutes
At the time of the bargain

1302
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:58,640
Money flows to our India

1303
01:49:59,070 --> 01:50:00,330
For all the poor

1304
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:01,870
For every farmer

1305
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,570
Every house with a radio card
All those who have help cards

1306
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:07,170
This is the money

1307
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:09,920
For every account you have at a minimum

1308
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,340
This is the money

1309
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,580
Elderly homes

1310
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,070
The Red Cross

Check your bank accounts

1314
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,970
Tractor to buy water

1315
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:33,940
If you do not have bank accounts
I'm not doing anything

1316
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,740
If it were, your home
Lakshmi is coming

1317
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,690
That's help card. Keep bank accounts.
No one knows which time

1318
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:48,510
Thinking what's meant by it
I am sending hundreds of thousands

1319
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,460
Without my place in my country
There are billions of dollars

1320
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:03,650
A lot of a day does not have to eat
The bottom is dying

1321
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:08,920
A lot of money for me today
I can not give it

1322
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:13,920
But your money
10% of the time, OK, 20% is right

1323
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:16,280
Do you have the heart given to the afflicted?

01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,560
Are you with me?

1325
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:28,950
You did not pay the money
If you think about holding up

1326
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:30,930
remember

1327
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,230
This is because you are devastating this land

1328
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:44,070

It's illegal

1332
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:01,330
Whatever punishment you are, I am ready

1333
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,330
Even though he was imprisoned and sentenced to death

1334
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:04,360
Ready

1335
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:10,490
Whatever I'm saying here
Coltanga, my dad killed me

1336
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:11,590
Dad

1337
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,790
Something will happen to me sometime
You were scared

1338
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:20,180
Something will do to you today
If I'm scared

1339
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:21,640
What is the meaning?

1340
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:26,050
Media

1341
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:27,480
Just (True)

1342
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:35,640
He's dead for the land

1343
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:41,440
He's dead for the land
What's bigger?

1344
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:51,100
One is not one

1345
01:53:57,650 --> 01:54:02,120
The clubhouse

1346
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:06,430
Do not give up on anybody's brothim

1347
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:20,940
The realm of happiness is filled with the satisfaction of everyone

1348
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:23,840
All over the country, Holly is celebrating

1349
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:34,470
Hey

1350
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,640
where is?
 - Where are you taking?

1351
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:38,810
Who are you?

1352
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:44,030
Ubaṭayi

1353
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,830
The whole country is celebrating Holly

01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:56,500
The whole of India is full of color

1355
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:21,080
How many more will I kill?

1356
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,660
How many, though

1357
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:24,490
For my daughter

Get rid of cuffs

1358
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,720
Hey jibal

1359
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,460
You escaped him
I found out

1360
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,170
It's a cricket ball

1361
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:38,670
He is our enemy

1362
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:40,840
That Javed does not have a brain

1363
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:43,050
If he asks for his word, he will be gone

1364
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:46,240
We're all in the stomach

1365
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:49,650
Everyone is togethim
Not one, not two

1366
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,520
Rs. 100 million

1367
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:55,980
Kill him
 - Kill him

1368
01:57:59,850 --> 01:58:00,760
Whom did you call?

1369
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:02,660
A minister gave me a fake wedding

1370
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:03,990
By killing, he gave Rs. 100 crores

1371
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:05,120
Who?

1372
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:13,620
Because everybody is watching him

1373
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:14,880
He's my son-in-law

1374
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:22,520
Give 100 crores
Not even buddy, God even kill him

1375
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:53,570
How do I know?
That I will come against my people

1376
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:58,520
It's good for you

1377
01:58:59,370 --> 01:59:00,700
They're going to end today

1378
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:03,010
Your phone will be gone
1483
<br> 02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:55,990
Hey
1484
<br> 02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,020
More than billionaires
My daughter is big for me

1379
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:03,020
Do not go in there
I want to tell you
1486
<br> 02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:06,010
Do you love him?
I do not know
1487
<br> 02:01:08,210 --> 02:01:09,990
Tell them once more about love
1488
<br> 02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:11,220
I'll leave
1489
<br> 02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:15,520
Have you gotten it?

1380
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:25,530
Leave

1381
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:44,530
<font color = "# 00ffff"> SHAKTI_jeet </ font>

1382
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:49,310
Do not confuse the police
1493
<br> 02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:50,940
To live somewhere like me
1494
<br> 02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,080
You are a person who wants the land
1495
<br> 02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,040
The only ones out there are good

1383
02:01:58,790 --> 02:02:00,290
Then get us to cabbage
1497
<br> 02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:02,580
where is
 - Cabbage
1498
<br> 02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:03,950
Coming
1499
<br> 02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,250
That's true
1500
<br> 02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,200
Go back to hiding
1501
<br> 02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:14,260
He's one and that's just good
1502
<br> 02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:16,160
What are you saying?
1503
<br> 02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:19,580
What injustice is there anyway
No god tells us

1384
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:22,970
That's it
Only a media sergeant

1385
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:41,970
