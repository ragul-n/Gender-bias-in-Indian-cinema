1
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:47,074
"Koki, the car is jumping
since it got serviced."

2
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,074
Her pack up is just like yours.

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,013
Pick up, not pack up."

4
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,353
Wrong words change the meaning.

5
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,960
You took English tuitions for 4 years

6
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,490
The tutor learnt Gujarati
but you didn't pick up English.

7
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,094
Forget it, what use is the wife?"

8
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,630
Studied up to class IV and
thinks she's related to Bush!

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,702
Considers herself an
English professional!

10
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,741
"You'll never learn!
Professor, not professional!"

11
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,343
"Same difference, slip of tongue.
But you got it, didn't you?"

12
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,845
"I understand you, always.
What when I have put up my years..."

13
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,289
with you and your rotten English!

14
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:36,785
Now listen carefully.
Kalyanji is a patriot.

15
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,858
Talk to him in Hindi. Don't exhibit
your brains by speaking in English.

16
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,897
You cut out your exhibition.
Get the card out.

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,742
"Bapu Patel, you are right.
But after the New York incident..."

18
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:59,946
It's risky living in America.
- What're you saying? That is America

19
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,080
Didn't you see how Bush whacked them?

20
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:09,295
That is right but what will be
the outcome? God alone knows.

21
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,291
In today's world wars benefit none.
Wars only create losses.

22
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,307
Millions were killed by
the quake in Gujarat.

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,909
But no country mourned their deaths.
- That's true.

24
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,905
But a few thousand die in America...

25
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:34,285
...and our entire
country mourned for them.

26
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:39,082
America is great.
They've woven a spell on everyone.

27
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,289
Everyone sings its' praise.
- America is America!

28
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,995
It's a terrific country!

29
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:52,301
God! Are we here to distribute
wedding cards or praise America?

30
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,572
"Forgive me, our car
went off the track."

31
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,448
What does your son-in-law do?

32
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,042
He runs many motels there.

33
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,949
His father is dead. Now he himself
manages the business.

34
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,416
He is very competent.
He has done MBA!

35
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:20,499
"Good, at least your dream of
an American son-in-law is fulfilled."

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,627
That is true.
- Right.

37
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,937
When will he come to India?
- He'll come much later.

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,739
His mother and her sister and
her husband will come tomorrow.

39
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,944
Talcum!

40
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,474
Welcome!

41
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,949
Please come in...
- Welcome...

42
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,084
"How are you?
- Wine, super wine."

43
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,292
Don't interrupt.
Let me speak today.

44
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,287
She has the bad habit
of interrupting me.

45
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,291
Where was I?

46
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,091
How was yourjourney?

47
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:00,097
Suffering? Any problem?
- No problem at all.

48
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,401
Tell me, how is Billu?"

49
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,847
He affectionately addresses
Bill Clinton as Billu.

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,083
He loves him a lot. Billu!

51
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,081
He's a great man.

52
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,420
He visited our village
on his trip to India.

53
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,957
The way he danced
with the village women...

54
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,300
Everybody is now his fan!

55
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,327
Every leader must emulate him.

56
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,069
Hillary as well as Monica...

57
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:41,277
Have the cake and eat it too.
- Stop it now. Enough.

58
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,079
I'm asking him to leave
some topics for indoors.

59
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,474
Please come in.

60
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,845
Cook, get their bags in."

61
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,950
Come here, dear."

62
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,035
Come dear.
Keep it.

63
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,675
This is your daughter-in-law, Jaya."

64
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,513
Hello.
- Hello.

65
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,286
You won't find such a super wine girl
in the district.

66
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,082
He means fine, good girl."

67
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,791
Dear, sit beside me."

68
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,564
You can see how pretty she is.
How can I praise her?

69
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,603
"Stitching, knitting,
painting, and booking..."

70
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,274
Her booking is so good that
her mother pales in comparison.

71
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,681
You'll lick your fingers!

72
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,885
He means cooking.

73
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,016
"I imagined a bride like
her for my son, Jatin."

74
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,227
When they're together...

75
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,896
they'll make a great pair.

76
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,827
When is our son-in-law
coming to India?

77
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,829
"Yes, do tell us.
- Next week."

78
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,832
His ticket has been okayed.
- That's good news.

79
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,940
He could drink milk from our
farm buffaloes if he's early.

80
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,607
The buffaloes would love it!

81
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,282
The American son-in-law
drinks our milk!

82
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,517
What a country America is!

83
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:39,027
Great country!
- But you get only powder milk

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,425
what a country America is!

85
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,902
We apply powder and they eat it!

86
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,275
He's joking. He's very jovial!
- Great country.

87
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,847
Why are you standing here?
- Why is Jatin throwing this party?

88
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,591
That he alone knows.
I've come because I was invited.

89
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,672
"I've got a mail"

90
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,469
"Asking me to return home early"

91
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,059
"Pals, I've got a mail"

92
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,893
"Asking me to return home early"

93
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,865
"Under the shady banyan tree..."

94
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,961
"there's a girl in my village..."

95
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,301
"waiting for me"

96
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,536
"I'm off to India"

97
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,806
"Guys, I'm off to India"

98
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,531
"what says the letter?"

99
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,899
"It says, come over..."

100
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,877
"There's lots of work"

101
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,339
"But I've read what isn't written"

102
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,388
"Forget it, carry on"

103
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,426
"I've heard rumours..."'

104
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,298
"My mother has chosen a girl"

105
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,468
"I've heard rumours..."'

106
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,237
"My mother has chosen a girl"

107
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,041
"The girl too has accepted"

108
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,844
"Don't ask me what I want"

109
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,615
"I've been ready for long"

110
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,916
"Guys, I'm off to India"

111
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,186
"She's lining her eyes with kohl"

112
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,811
"Decorating her forehead"

113
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,951
"She's lining her eyes with kohl"

114
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,860
"Decorating her forehead"

115
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:49,029
"She's far away but
she's stealing my heart"

116
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,005
"She's like Ranjha's Heer"

117
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,901
"Like a quiet picture"

118
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,712
"Neither have I set eyes on her..."

119
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,547
"Nor has she ever seen me"

120
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,019
"we're in love without meeting"

121
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,388
"Pals, I'm off to India"

122
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,287
"Traveller to my nation..."

123
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,992
"Do me a favour"

124
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,965
"Traveller to my nation..."

125
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,868
"Do me a favour"

126
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,966
"Greet everyone on our behalf"

127
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,344
"The song you're singing..."

128
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,285
"brings back memories"

129
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,948
"we too would like to go home"

130
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,848
"Not die in a foreign land"

131
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:24,626
"There's no guarantee of life...
Man, you're off to India"

132
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,082
Hello son.

133
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,591
How are you?
- Absolutely fine. I miss you a lot.

134
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,832
Now you're grown up.
How long will you miss me?

135
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,236
Why?

136
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:11,008
I'd ordered a wedding
ring for the bride.

137
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,273
Have you taken delivery?

138
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,438
I'd forgotten just that.
I promise to get it today.

139
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,784
"Don't forget, son.
- Don't worry. I'll get it."

140
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,606
Where is she?

141
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,879
"Where were you?
Tell me, how do I look?"

142
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,691
I meant this ring not you.

143
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,822
You Indian girls won't change
even in America. Very bad manners.

144
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,892
My friend...

145
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,438
I know you boys well.
First you tease girls...

146
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,002
then you misbehave.
You should be ashamed.

147
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,005
You should be ashamed.
You're messing with me.

148
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,282
"Am I...?
- Yes, because you are mad."

149
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:31,213
What did you say? You called me mad?
I'll show you how mad I am!

150
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,523
Dropped the phone too! I got to send
you to India in one piece. Come on.

151
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,362
What a pest!

152
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,072
I'm calling from JB Designs.
Your dress is ready.

153
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,557
What's wrong with your voice?

154
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,752
Who is that?
- You don't recognise my voice?

155
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,822
It's Jackie!

156
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,901
"Listen, be dominating
right from the beginning."

157
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,899
Otherwise these Indian girls
treat husbands like dogs.

158
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,745
Another thing... if you want
some tips for the nuptial night...

159
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:33,412
consult me. I'll show you
such tricks that. Do you get me?

160
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,393
I'm calling from JB Designs
Your dress is ready.

161
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,794
Karishma, call from JB Designs."

162
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,040
She's a trifle busy.
She asks what the matter is

163
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,173
Ask her whether she wants
elastic or a cord in the skirt.

164
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,211
What do you want in the skirt?
Elastic or drawstrings?

165
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,613
I've kept the skirt
2 inches below the navel.

166
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,079
If you like I can keep it
another 2 inches lower.

167
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,886
Should I make the blouse shorter?

168
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,325
Please ask her to take
delivery in an hour.

169
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,282
I'll have to switch the phone off.

170
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,284
Tell me why must you go
to India to get married?

171
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,287
"Who are you?
- What's wrong with your voice, Jatin?"

172
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,036
I... was joking.

173
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,069
I think our phones got mixed up.
- What...?

174
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,882
"Is that why I'm getting your calls?
- Look, I have no time to argue."

175
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,286
Take down my address
and get the phone here.

176
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,420
I can't come there now. I'm going
to India by the 4 o'clock flight.

177
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,288
Meet me at Terminal B
we'll exchange the phones.

178
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,455
And listen...

179
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,960
There was a call for you from
JB Designs. Your dress is ready.

180
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:39,243
"Light a lamp with a lamp"

181
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,082
"Light lamps all the way"

182
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,442
"Let the river of love flow"

183
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,464
"Every needy man that
crosses your path..."

184
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:08,238
New watch?
- No.

185
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,632
Then why do you keep looking at it?
- I'm late.

186
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,671
Going to India?
- Yes.

187
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,573
India is great.

188
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:23,817
"Only the rulers must change,
they can move the world."

189
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:30,555
Do one thing. Kiss the earth once
on behalf on Baba Singh.

190
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,527
Meaning?
- The earth is mother for us.

191
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,867
Our culture teaches us
to love the motherland.

192
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:44,738
Do you have relatives in India?
- Plenty.

193
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,842
I was a truck driver in India.

194
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:54,341
My route was to go from Gujarat
to Rajasthan through Delhi.

195
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:58,913
I have relatives
from Gujarat to Delhi.

196
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,689
You must be going
to India quite often.

197
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,889
"No, son. I had to leave India
because of relatives."

198
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:11,894
"I don't understand.
- Son, you will understand in India."

199
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,307
We're at the airport.

200
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,347
Get free... come on.

201
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,951
"Can't you even see?
- Sorry miss, it's not his fault."

202
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,783
I banged into him and he with you.
- I won't listen to you!

203
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,959
There's a limit to fooling.

204
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,923
Fooling?
- Of course!

205
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,666
You told my tailor to put elastic
in my skirt instead of drawstring.

206
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,062
Now the skirt is so heavy
it won't stay on my waist!

207
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,631
If it wasn't time for my flight...
- Your flight...?

208
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,339
Yes.
- Going to India?

209
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,542
Yes!
- So we're on the same flight?

210
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:33,513
"Remember, mess with me again
and I'll set you right!"

211
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,423
God knows what he thinks of himself!

212
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,425
Stay away from her in
the flight. Don't mess.

213
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:53,794
She's hot. Her mother must've eaten
chilies before giving birth to her.

214
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,337
Miss Hot Chilli.
- Come in time. Okay?

215
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,842
Be in time.

216
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,299
What...? No flight will take off?

217
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,631
"Yes, the Delhi air traffic
is on indefinite strike."

218
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,731
This is the last flight
that's been allowed to land.

219
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,670
Can you tell me when I can
get the first train to Ahmedabad?

220
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,979
No possibility of that.

221
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,417
Last night a terrible rail accident
took place in Gujarat.

222
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,276
Every train going to
Gujarat has been cancelled.

223
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,089
Can you please tell me
some way to get to Vijaynagar?

224
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:53,286
There's only one option. If a cabbie
agrees to take you to Gujarat...

225
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:06,273
Anybody wanting to go to Gujarat?

226
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,419
Brother, want to go to Gujarat?"

227
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,293
Yes, I want to go to Vijaynagar."

228
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,964
Come along.

229
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,766
What is your name?
- Veer Singh.

230
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,246
Do you have a relative in America?
- My relatives never left Delhi.

231
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:47,480
Strange. I met a taxi driver
in America. He is your replica.

232
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,284
Okay, what does your father do?"

233
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,291
My father died when I was little.

234
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,091
Mother says, he was a truck driver."

235
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,556
He'd drive from Gujarat to Rajasthan...
- To Delhi?

236
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,292
Yes. True.

237
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,229
But how do you know?
- From the American taxi driver.

238
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,442
Stop joking. Get in the car.

239
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,291
Is he also coming along?
- But...

240
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,684
I can't survive such
a long journey with him!

241
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,287
Me neither.

242
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:32,930
Just a minute.

243
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:37,224
Are you family foes?
- Yes!

244
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,638
I'm your first passenger.
Do as I say!

245
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,507
I'll pay double but disembark her!

246
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,409
Want to go to Agra?

247
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,677
Think it over.
Your destination is the same.

248
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:57,680
"If I go to Agra, you won't
find a cab to Gujarat."

249
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,729
They've agreed.

250
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:09,555
Forgive and forget.

251
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,895
Shut the door.

252
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,413
Where are you taking us
through this wilderness?

253
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:37,853
It's a shortcut. We'll reach
a couple of hours earlier.

254
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,240
Please stop the car.

255
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,707
There's a public phone.
I need to make a call.

256
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,015
My parents must be waiting for me.

257
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,353
"Right, go ahead.
Meanwhile I'll grab a bite."

258
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,793
Why are you following me?

259
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,456
I'm not following you.
I have to call my Mom.

260
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,401
Do you have to call at the same time?
- What...?

261
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,406
Strange character.

262
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,678
What's on the menu?

263
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,749
Everything.

264
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,224
Are you imitating me?

265
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,352
You're copying me!

266
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,230
I... spoke first!

267
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,762
So what? You must have
heard that I stammer.

268
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,228
I'm coming from Delhi.
How would I hear?

269
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,474
People know me right up to Delhi!

270
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,004
That Guru stammers.
- I'm Veer Singh.

271
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,214
Don't mess with me!

272
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,413
You too don't mess!
- Why not?

273
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,214
I'll break your shop!
You don't know me!

274
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,895
You don't know me!
I'll fix you!

275
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,742
I won't spare you!

276
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,751
Fighting in Lamba Singh's area?

277
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,058
I didn't...
- I'm KK Lamba Singh.

278
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,290
I can be seen from afar.

279
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,860
I knock sense into people.

280
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,199
But...
- He...

281
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,100
No ifs and buts.

282
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,566
Lamba Singh doesn't hear
a word at the crime scene.

283
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,939
Give your explanations
in the police station.

284
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,506
Put them in place of the stepney.

285
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,606
I say...
- He started the fight.

286
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,290
Why is the police
taking away our driver?

287
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,284
He was fighting with my master.

288
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,863
How far is the police station?
- Quite close. About 5 kilometers.

289
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,030
The driver left the keys behind.
You may take it.

290
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,897
Can you drive?

291
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:44,975
What asses! Why didn't you say
both of you stammer?

292
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,285
Wasted police fuel unnecessarily.

293
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,621
Pick them up from the motel
then drop them back...

294
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,995
Stop laughing. Drive fast.

295
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,645
Sir... my car...

296
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,057
Thief... stop the jeep!

297
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:32,020
Theft in my area?
Turn the jeep round.

298
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,430
Hurry up!

299
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,034
Chase them.

300
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,009
The cops are chasing us.
- What?

301
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,011
Why?

302
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,341
Reduce speed!
- That's what I'm trying.

303
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,012
"Stop the car!
- Shut up, will you?"

304
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,014
I think the brakes have failed.

305
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,792
Please stop the car.

306
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,201
Shut up. That's
what I'm trying to do.

307
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,628
Stop! Stop!

308
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,007
Stop the car!
- Stop!

309
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:40,898
Stop!

310
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,234
Stop the car somehow!

311
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:48,804
Stop!

312
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,312
Who will pay for the damages?

313
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,776
The one who banged it.

314
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,813
Who asked me to speed up?
- I asked you to speed up not bang it

315
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,094
Quiet!

316
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,690
Stop fighting with your spouse
like cats and dogs.

317
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,293
We're not married!
- Am I blind?

318
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:23,338
My name is KK Lamba Singh
I can be seen from afar.

319
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,741
I've been married for 15 years.
We also fight.

320
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,837
But...
- No buts.

321
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,405
Listen...

322
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,952
I also eloped to get married.

323
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,490
I like those who elope to get married

324
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,293
Hence this time I excuse you.

325
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,388
Drop them to the bus stand
in the jeep.

326
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,348
This is the bus stand.
You'll get a bus here.

327
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,810
From here? Okay.

328
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,850
Some tea...?
- No thanks.

329
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,989
I'm not in the mood for tea.

330
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,862
Here you are.

331
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,071
For the tea.
- What is that?

332
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,674
He wasn't offering us tea.
He wanted money to drink tea.

333
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,943
"Tea means tip.
- That's right, Mr Jatin."

334
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,150
Out here nobody helps you for free.

335
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,954
Coolie!

336
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,188
Does anyone need a porter?

337
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,129
What are you looking at?
What's wrong?

338
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:07,243
Has the police confiscated your cab?
From a cabbie to porter in a day?

339
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,940
I haven't earned a penny
since morning. And you're joking?

340
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,283
I've never driven anything in life.

341
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,882
I'm Jeet Singh. Talks like a fool.

342
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:21,280
"But you resemble Veer Singh.
- Maybe, but I'm Jeet Singh!"

343
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,090
Tell me, what did your Dad do?"

344
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,796
Father...? I don't really know.

345
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,500
But my mother used to say
he was a truck driver.

346
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,098
He'd drive from Gujarat
to Delhi via Rajasthan?

347
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,474
Exactly!

348
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,275
But how do you know?

349
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:47,011
Veer Singh from Delhi told me.
- Cut the jokes. Where's your luggage?

350
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,014
I'll carry my bag myself.

351
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,957
You look new to these parts.
Have you seen our buses?

352
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,987
Try putting your bags in...

353
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,296
The bags will leave in the
bus while you'll be left behind.

354
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,802
"How much will you charge, brother?
- Brother? You called me, brother?"

355
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,933
All right. One single green 100 note.

356
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,673
Otherwise you'd charge 500?
I'll pay Rs. 20. Take it or leave it.

357
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,579
20 bucks?
- Yes.

358
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,745
What's wrong?

359
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:23,617
Tell your husband he wont'
get a porters picture for 20.

360
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:28,082
These days they make films
on porters costing millions...

361
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,094
And one day they'll make
Jeet Singh Rathod...

362
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,432
All right.

363
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,901
Here's 100 bucks. Happy?

364
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,611
Look at that.

365
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:06,429
"Mister, the crowded bus
is the one you take."

366
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,223
What...?
- Yes.

367
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,898
Now jump in like
a soldier in a battlefield.

368
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,931
I'll throw the bags up.
- Throw...?

369
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,900
I mean pass them in.
Plunge into the battle field.

370
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,129
Push in...

371
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,929
open the door... please...

372
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,809
Are you hurt?
- No but my bag...!

373
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,218
This isn't your America.

374
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,924
"If you couldn't get in the bus,
you could've asked a porter."

375
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,690
This is funny. We lose our luggage
and you fire us.

376
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,895
Of course. We'll be put to difficulty
You just write the complaint.

377
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,829
There's no guarantee here.

378
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,899
What?
- Yes. I've taken down the address.

379
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,209
"If you're lucky and the bag
is found, we'll send it home."

380
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:33,212
Cheer up. You'll get the bag.
And no big deal if it isn't.

381
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,951
My wedding dress was in it.

382
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,914
What? You too have come
here to get married?

383
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:42,554
What do you mean?
Have you also come to be married?

384
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,752
Poor girl.

385
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,957
It will be a lucky girl
who will marry a boy like me.

386
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,565
The one who marries you
has my sympathies.

387
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,975
He'll be the luckiest man on earth.

388
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,906
Sure. Is it a love marriage?

389
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,215
No. Why?
- Because man is blind in love.

390
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,550
Then you are definitely
marrying for love.

391
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,219
No. I have never seen her.

392
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,922
Mother has chosen her for me.
Have you met your fiance?

393
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,025
No, my parents selected him."

394
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:28,136
And my belief is that my parents
will choose the right man.

395
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,378
But I can't figure out
about your marriage.

396
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,276
Why?
- You were born in America

397
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,481
How can Mummy's
choice be your choice?

398
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,354
My mother is
responsible for what I am.

399
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,491
"After Daddy's death,
Mother raised me alone."

400
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:54,056
She fulfilled every wish of mine.
We share the same tastes.

401
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,965
That is why I trust
mother's choice completely.

402
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,327
I agree with this.

403
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,932
Our thoughts match on this at least.

404
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,607
I think we could think
alike on another topic.

405
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,981
On what?
- Food. I'm famished. Let's eat.

406
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,794
Will the food be hygienic?

407
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,956
100% hygienic but Indian style.

408
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,090
Meaning?
- Meaning...

409
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,032
rats must be running
free in the kitchen.

410
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,564
Cockroaches must be
tasting the dishes.

411
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,997
The people here do not
like washing vegetables.

412
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:42,539
The spices are adulterated.
The cook bathes just once a week.

413
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,073
Another thing.
They never add salt to the food.

414
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,615
The cook's sweat makes it salty.

415
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,949
Drink some water.

416
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:05,928
"I can't eat this!
- Don't act smart, you'll stay hungry"

417
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,898
You won't find a 5 star hotel
up to Vijay Nagar. I was joking.

418
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,307
What...?

419
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,110
Here...

420
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,340
eat.

421
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,190
Now what's the matter?
- Take a look at that.

422
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:22,311
I wonder where else
the man sowed his oats.

423
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,014
This too looks like his offshoot.

424
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,351
What are you looking at?
They are gypsies.

425
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,084
They wander around
and entertain people.

426
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,089
"Hats off to you, Jeet Singh.
- Jeet Singh...?"

427
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,631
"Jeet Singh, who?
- You're a super actor."

428
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,105
Porter by day and
entertainer by night.

429
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,976
"You are terrific, Jeet Singh.
- Sir, you are mistaken."

430
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,813
"I'm not Jeet Singh.
I'm Bhanwar Singh, the gypsy."

431
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,741
Sir?
- Tell me...

432
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,618
what did your father do?
- I have no idea...

433
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,958
"but mother would say,
he was a truck driver."

434
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,418
He'd drive from Gujarat to
Delhi via Rajasthan?

435
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,797
Right. But how do you know?

436
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,300
Jeet Singh told me.
- I see.

437
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:18,768
Not again!

438
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,969
"Sir, we've arranged for
you to spend the night."

439
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,869
The owner of the guest house
is my friend. I've called him.

440
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,040
My man will take you there.

441
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,886
Welcome. Let me introduce you
to the special articles here.

442
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,953
Everything has been made
keeping NRI tastes in mind.

443
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:49,698
This drawing room has been
made with such love and care...

444
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,127
If you wish to sit
here and get turned on...

445
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,300
Everything is right here.

446
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,100
No thank you. Just
show us to the bedroom.

447
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,275
I will. What's the rush?

448
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:10,049
You have the entire night.
Winter nights are pretty long

449
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,785
Nothing like that...
- Come on.

450
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,293
Take a look at my wardrobe.

451
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,289
You may wear whatever fits.
We'll charge a little extra.

452
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:25,294
"In India, you're respected
only if you have money."

453
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,966
I'll go freshen up.

454
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,615
Sir... anything else?

455
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,846
"I mean imported spray,
vitamin pills..."

456
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,792
Look mister...
- Razzak Shahjahan Puri is the name.

457
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,592
"Mr Razzak, don't you...
- I won't disturb you."

458
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:58,297
In fact I won't disturb you
till you call me to disturb you.

459
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,238
The girl is terrific...
- Look I said...

460
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,641
Good bye. God be with you.

461
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,440
Good night.

462
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,630
What is it?

463
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,848
Let go!

464
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:00,228
"Why are you beating me? Help!
- Stealing, eh?"

465
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,425
What's the matter?
- Caught him stealing.

466
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,398
He's my man. Stealing from me?
Clobber him!

467
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,421
Thief sir...

468
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,289
take whatever you want.
I won't lose a thing.

469
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:38,032
"Inspector, you scared us!
You came without being called."

470
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,562
Did you get a call?
- I wouldn't reach so fast.

471
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,031
I heard a scream
I was passing by.

472
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,274
You...? Are you a man
or an atom bomb?

473
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,273
You create a scene everywhere you go.
- He had come here to steal.

474
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,879
Is it your Pop's house?
- Nobody touches him. I'm here.

475
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,289
"Come here, you blanket!
Stealing in my area?"

476
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,883
I'll kill you in an encounter.
I'll fix you in such a case...

477
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,229
that no lawyer will fight for you!

478
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,224
Sonofagun! I am a lawyer myself!

479
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,361
Master...!

480
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,733
Son of a gun!

481
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,633
"If he's the owner, why
did he enter like a thief?"

482
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,048
"Right, my foot!
I saw the lights on in the house."

483
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,612
"I saw shadows, came in
to check and he ambushed me!"

484
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:34,717
"We rented it.
- Man, I own the house."

485
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:41,454
No one enters without my permission!
Who rented it out to you?

486
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,032
He did.

487
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,867
He took advance payment.
- Razzak? You did?

488
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:53,732
"She is lying, master!
I live off you. How can I cheat you?"

489
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,606
"Sir, don't beat me.
I suffer from TB and diabetes..."

490
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,610
"Ulcer, asthma. My liver
too has some problems."

491
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,387
Tell you something?
When Mr. Dinshaw is never around...

492
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,825
I rent this palace out to
the needy to fulfill my needs.

493
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,425
Now you'll be the most needy!

494
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,967
Even if you beg for medicines
outside the hospital...

495
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,236
Nobody will give you a penny!

496
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,834
You turned Dinshaw Palace
into Dinshaw guest house!

497
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,503
Shameless! You wear my clothes?
Idiot!

498
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:31,208
Inspector arrest him!
Never release him!

499
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,028
Driver, why did you stop?"

500
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,960
The police is in front.
- I'll check.

501
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,205
"What's the matter, inspector?
- Where are you going?"

502
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:04,080
Bikaner. To celebrate the 50th
wedding anniversary of our parents.

503
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,779
Our family deity resides there.
- Give them a lift.

504
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:11,746
"They want to go to Vijaynagar.
- But sir, we're family..."

505
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,819
They're also family.
They just got married.

506
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,991
But sir...
- Their bag went in the bus.

507
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,594
They got left behind.
Drop them at Bikaner.

508
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,027
They'll take a vehicle there.
Please help them.

509
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,729
Okay. Come on.

510
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,946
I can be seen from afar.

511
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,296
What's your name?
- Karishma.

512
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,559
And you?
- Jatin.

513
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,535
Did you have a love marriage?

514
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,027
Yes.
- No.

515
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,565
Yes.
- Yes.

516
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,509
First you fell in love.

517
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,278
The family would've opposed.
Finally they gave in. Right?

518
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,877
Yes.
- Yes.

519
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,954
Just like us.

520
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,924
What? You had a love marriage
50 years ago?

521
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:30,096
This custom is going on in our
country since the Mahabharat. Right?

522
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,231
Arjuna eloped with Subhadra.

523
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,734
Have you also
kidnapped your Subhadra?

524
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,945
Grandpa, how did you get grandma?"

525
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,813
Silly, by singing a song."

526
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,489
"Coming for the night show?"

527
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,883
Am I right?

528
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,991
"Son, we weren't allowed
to watch the night show."

529
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:07,467
It's almost midnight.
Go to sleep and let us sleep.

530
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:13,434
I'll answer your question when
we reach Bikaner in the morning.

531
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,579
"Okay, grandpa.
- Put out the lights. Let us sleep."

532
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,339
"Grandpa, from here
we'll manage to Vijaynagar."

533
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:57,579
How can you leave like this?
You called me grandpa.

534
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,281
You must stay for the
50th anniversary.

535
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,549
But...
- It's a matter of a day.

536
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,497
After the function we'll drop
you at the Vijaynagar bypass.

537
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:12,999
"Yes, you are our guests. We can't
let you leave without a meal."

538
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,335
Come on, come with us."

539
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,966
What are you thinking of?
Come on in.

540
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,938
Let's freshen up and go to the temple.
- But we have no clothes.

541
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,350
Don't worry about clothes.
We have enough.

542
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,524
Live long.

543
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,503
Now I understand your
flowing river of love.

544
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,008
Lost on the steps?
This is a holy place.

545
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,547
You'll be blessed if you
take the priests' blessings.

546
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,279
Be happy.

547
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,957
These are our guests.
- I see.

548
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,294
They are newly married.

549
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,299
May you live forever
in marital bliss. Come in.

550
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:32,271
You're looking great
in borrowed feathers.

551
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,748
Shall I speak the truth?
You too look handsome in this dress

552
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,282
Looking? I am handsome.

553
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,294
Both of you look good.
- Let's go. Everyone is downstairs.

554
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,087
You haven't worn vermilion?

555
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,962
But...?

556
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,905
Actually we don't
believe in old customs.

557
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:03,938
Old customs? This is our culture.
Our identity.

558
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,276
If Mummy sees a married
woman without vermilion...

559
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,949
She'll make a mountain
out of a molehill.

560
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,288
She'll create quite a ruckus.

561
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,049
"You're still chatting?
Come on, it's getting late."

562
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,622
Karishma hasn't worn vermilion.

563
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,829
This won't do.
You'll have to adorn your hair.

564
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,303
I always carry it in my purse.

565
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,097
You don't have to feel shy.

566
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,900
"Jatin, apply the vermilion
to her forehead, fast."

567
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:46,283
"Dearer than the dearest"

568
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:55,287
"Like the strings of a guitar"

569
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,229
"You are a part of me"

570
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:43,275
"Love was looking for us"

571
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:48,978
"Asking for our address"

572
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:54,515
"Love came searching for us"

573
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,994
"Asking for my name and address"

574
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:11,229
"I swear, we are caught..."

575
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:16,270
"Caught in handcuffs"

576
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,844
"Destiny came in search of me..."

577
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,279
"Asking for me by my name"

578
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:32,791
"Love came searching for us"

579
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,926
"Asking for our address"

580
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:13,461
"Stealthily it came and
stole into our hearts"

581
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,700
"Love..."

582
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:29,815
"First it stole the heart"

583
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,223
"Then the peace of mind"

584
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:46,224
"The fire that can't be
quenched by the seven seas"

585
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:54,009
"The fire that can't be
quenched by the seven seas"

586
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:59,471
"I felt the life go out
of me when you appeared"

587
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,213
"I swear by you..."

588
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:13,724
"I swear by you, I am caught"

589
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:18,997
"Locked in cuffs"

590
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:24,702
"Destiny came in search of us..."

591
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,562
"Like a gust of wind..."

592
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:29,901
"who stopped me in my path?"

593
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,003
"Love"

594
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:41,015
"Let me teach you the game of love"

595
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:57,288
"It got a chance when
our eyes locked..."

596
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:05,003
"It got a chance when
our eyes locked..."

597
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:10,946
"what could we do
when the hearts met?"

598
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,284
"I swear by you..."

599
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:24,282
"I swear we are caught"

600
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:27,051
They are newly married.
Will they have children?

601
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,290
Sister, they will have kids..."

602
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,423
They are also lucky.

603
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,532
They will do better in a
foreign country than here.

604
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,309
But...
- What?

605
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,813
That's what the lines say...

606
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:58,343
what do they say?
- Their lines depict separation.

607
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:05,393
They won't be able to live together.
They will be separated.

608
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,430
No, this can't be true."

609
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:17,339
I'm not saying this.
Their lines say it.

610
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,300
But is there a solution?

611
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,607
There must be some way...
- There is.

612
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,138
But only if they do it.

613
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,344
Why not? We will make them do it.
- But grandma...

614
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:32,183
For my sake, you must."

615
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,749
"Grandpa...
- Listen, my son..."

616
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:39,491
You have accepted us as your
grandparents. Then you must obey us.

617
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,974
What happened? Why did you stop?

618
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,544
Sir we're at the Vijaynagar bypass.

619
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:06,281
The Vijaynagar guests
must get off here.

620
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,416
Vijaynagar is to the right.

621
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:16,617
It's almost morning.
You'll get some transport.

622
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,302
We'll miss you a lot.
- So will I.

623
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,071
Take care of Karishma.

624
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,286
"Grandma, we take leave.
- Bless you, dear."

625
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:48,891
Grandpa.

626
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:51,951
My dear...

627
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,489
okay, grandpa... bye."

628
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,031
It is from Indians
that one must learn love.

629
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,472
"Here and there..."

630
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:45,964
"Here and there..."

631
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,841
"the fire rages in both hearts"

632
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,837
"Both have fallen in love"

633
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,282
"You and I..."

634
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,376
"You and I..."

635
01:05:57,186 --> 01:06:01,020
"we are so far..."

636
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,789
"yet so close"

637
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,994
"How far yet so close"

638
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:14,226
"Far yet so close"

639
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:46,494
"The path of love is twisted"

640
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:52,240
"Bind me to yourself"

641
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:02,208
"The path of love is twisted"

642
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:07,450
"Bind me to yourself"

643
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:12,727
"The heart wants to hold you"

644
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:17,925
"The heart wants to hold you"

645
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:23,732
"The feeling is to lose oneself"

646
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,433
"To lose ourselves..."

647
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,342
"is what the heart desires"

648
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:34,834
"Not here, not there, you'll
never find love even across the seas"

649
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:40,043
"People find God
but not their beloved"

650
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:50,458
"Not here, not there, you'll never
find love even across the seas"

651
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,525
"People find God
but not their beloved"

652
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:06,440
"Not everyone in the world
finds a love like this"

653
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:12,269
"Those who find it are special"

654
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,005
That's a rick.
- What?

655
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,781
"Auto rickshaw, silly man.
- But who is driving it?"

656
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:01,755
Nobody ever finds out who is driving.
It's been going on for years.

657
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,084
Let's take a lift. It'll be fun.
- But where's the place?

658
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,390
They'll make place. Come on!

659
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,471
We want to ride in the rick.

660
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,140
Can we get a lift to Vijaynagar?
- We're not going there.

661
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,039
We're going to a fair a little ahead.

662
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:33,546
You may sit if you want to go there.
It will cost 20 bucks.

663
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,622
"Want to go to the fair?
- Yes, it will be fun."

664
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,627
Turn around to sit.

665
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,103
Carry on.

666
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,484
This one is an antique.
You won't find it anywhere.

667
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:52,293
It will look great
round your wife's neck.

668
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:58,299
"How much is it for?
- Rs. 3,000."

669
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,838
No, credit cards don't work here."

670
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,241
"This?
- Yes, it will do."

671
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,474
Bracelet...?

672
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,779
He gave his bracelet?

673
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,833
"Man, get off.
We're at Vijaynagar."

674
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:46,974
How far is the city from here?
- About 15 minutes if you go walking.

675
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:51,614
This road goes to Nagardas Colony
and that to Patel Colony.

676
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:44,394
"If we hadn't been together..."

677
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,773
"possibly we wouldn't
have fallen in love"

678
01:15:56,051 --> 01:16:00,954
"If not today, it
would happen tomorrow"

679
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:05,927
"I'd lose my heart to you"

680
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:16,564
"whatever happens, there must
be something between us..."

681
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:24,911
"whatever happens, there must
be something between us..."

682
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:30,281
"Not everyone falls in love"

683
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:38,757
"Destiny came in search..."

684
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:44,388
"Asking for us by our name"

685
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,960
"Love came looking for us"

686
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:54,608
"Asking for our whereabouts"

687
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:59,446
"So far yet so close"

688
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,479
Do you get it?

689
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,780
You Sikhs are so intelligent.

690
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,121
So why do people crack jokes
at your expense?

691
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,951
I'm doing a research on that.
- Sir! The son-in-law is here!

692
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,591
The son-in-law is here!
- Indeed! Congratulations!

693
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:16,127
"Madam, the son-law has arrived.
- Jatin has arrived...?"

694
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,190
This is how the sari is
worn here in Gujarat.

695
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:24,528
"When your husband sees you,
his beard's going to flap for you."

696
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,166
Madam...
- What is it?

697
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,810
The son-in-law has arrived.
- What...? Let's go!

698
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,814
The son-in-law has arrived, dear."

699
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,487
This way, sir."

700
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,157
Welcome, son-in-law! Welcome!"

701
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:49,388
What are you doing? Don't be a moron
in front of the American son-in-law.

702
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:53,464
"You're messing up the words!
Just say "welcome"

703
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:56,367
"out of happiness, it was only
a slip of taang (leg)."

704
01:17:56,838 --> 01:18:00,205
Where's your luggage?
- The luggage went with the bus.

705
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:05,976
"Never mind, son. Thank God,
you are here."

706
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:15,081
I couldn't go to sleep.
I was so worried for you.

707
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,384
"You didn't have any problems
during the journey, did you?"

708
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,591
No, Ma. Not at all."

709
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,458
Ramaben... why are you crying?

710
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,531
Your son is now here.
Why do you have to cry?

711
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,732
"My son, this is your would-be
father-in-law. Bapalal."

712
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:38,736
"Pay your respects to him.
- God bless you, son."

713
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:44,118
"Meet her, your mother-in-law.
Koki."

714
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,386
Namaste.

715
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,791
May God give you a long life.

716
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,789
May God bless you and Jaya together

717
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:56,463
Know what? To pray for your
safe arrival...

718
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,399
Jaya has been fasting
from the last four days.

719
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:02,333
She hasn't had a morsel of food.

720
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,306
"Yes, my son.
You're a very fortunate boy."

721
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:11,311
Only in India do you find women who
fast for their husband's long life.

722
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,311
No praise is enough for Jaya.

723
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:18,781
Go now and personally
feed her something.

724
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,289
Go on. She's in her room.

725
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:58,588
Namaste.
- Namaste.

726
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,796
I was told you haven't had
anything to eat in four days.

727
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,395
Why must you believe in such things?
You're an educated girl.

728
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:13,840
"Education makes man wiser,
no doubt."

729
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,338
But only God can work miracles.

730
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,643
I believe in God.

731
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,748
Had I not come here in 10 days.
What would you do?

732
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:30,790
I would have fasted
till you arrived.

733
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,261
We aren't yet married.
So why must you...?

734
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,398
Once a marriage is decided here...

735
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:40,292
girls take their fiances'
for their husbands.

736
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,139
What is good for the husband
is blessed for the wife.

737
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,641
Come and eat now.
- All right.

738
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,594
There's so much more!
Just listen.

739
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,796
He thought there was
a burglar in the house.

740
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:12,125
And we thought someone had come
to steal at the guest-house.

741
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:14,796
The thrashing he got...

742
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,808
It's like the story
of a Hindi movie!

743
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,840
Of course!
- Karishma!

744
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:45,896
"Papa, where have you been
all this while?"

745
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:49,796
"Karishma, where else would the
president of the Municipality be?"

746
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:52,306
Shut up, Geeta. Will you?"

747
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:57,076
We had a General Body
meeting today.

748
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:01,315
"But as soon as I got to know my little
boy had returned, I rushed here."

749
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:04,376
So how's the little boy?
- How does he look?

750
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,379
Not much of a difference.
He's just the same.

751
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:09,790
Really? So how about it?
- Sure!

752
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,255
Don't fight!
- There is a difference all right!

753
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,464
When did you buy this bracelet?

754
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,201
"I didn't buy it, mother. It was
gifted to me by a friend."

755
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,407
Looks like a boy's bracelet.

756
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:35,510
"It even has the initial "J".
- You start the moment she's here!"

757
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:38,582
"Have you ever been to America?
- No, sir."

758
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,583
"Exactly! Boys there live like girls,
and girls live like boys."

759
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,551
Do you understand now?
- Really?

760
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:47,124
There are very few days
for the wedding.

761
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:49,795
Get on with the arrangements.
There's so much to do.

762
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,033
The guests will start arriving
from tomorrow.

763
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:55,396
And arrange for some food first.
I'm terribly hungry.

764
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:57,796
"You're hungry, aren't you?
- Oh yes, Papa. Very."

765
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,913
Jaya! Where are you?
Come on out!

766
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,982
Have you forgotten?
- What?

767
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:26,393
When did you return from America?
- Yesterday.

768
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,133
But I'm terribly angry with you.
- What for?

769
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:32,404
You're getting married and
you didn't even tell me!

770
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:36,334
"It all happened so quickly, I didn't
have the time to tell anyone."

771
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:39,336
Didn't you find the time or didn't
you want to invite me to the wedding?

772
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:42,146
"That's not true, Karishma.
- If that's not true..."

773
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,944
why did you fix your wedding
on the day I'm getting married?

774
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,586
"Anyway, forget all that. I hear
you've chosen an American boy."

775
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,787
"Won't you introduce me to him?
- Of course, I will."

776
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,592
But I have a condition.
- Well?

777
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:58,589
Don't start eyeing him.
- Forget it!

778
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,299
I don't eye every Tom
Dick and Harry.

779
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,785
This is Karishma.
A special friend.

780
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:28,125
And Karishma... he's the one.

781
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,262
Namaste.
- Namaste.

782
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:37,104
She was away studying in America.

783
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:41,536
She's getting married on
the same day as we are.

784
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,913
"A letter for you, son-in-law.
- For me?"

785
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,445
It's from some Rahul Agarwal
in Jaipur.

786
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:56,189
"Already making friends in India?
- No, this one is an old friend."

787
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:59,794
"Jaya, here's the invitation card
for my wedding."

788
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:04,329
"Won't you invite him?
- He'll come, so will you."

789
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,631
So give the card to him.

790
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,199
Here you are.

791
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:28,789
I'll see Karishma off
at the door.

792
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:40,185
"Yes, Mother?
- Don't go out anywhere today, son."

793
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,318
We've got to go out this afternoon.

794
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,858
Haven't these clothes still
been sent for a wash?

795
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,061
I'll wash them.
- But Mother...

796
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:51,291
It's a busy house. We'll soon have a
pile of clothes if everybody forgets.

797
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:08,509
"I can't understand. Talk in Hindi,
if you can't tell me in English."

798
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,578
So it's Natya! Why were you talking
to me in English? What is it?

799
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:20,256
Haven't you received the list
of the people coming for dinner?

800
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:28,359
Give me your number. I'll ask Bapalal
to give you a call. Okay?

801
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:31,529
One moment.

802
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,476
What's the number?

803
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,380
"Chef, note down this
number in the diary."

804
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,791
I'll talk to Nattu later.
- Very well.

805
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,351
"They'll ask me to write the number,
but they won't call anyone!"

806
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,028
To hell with it!

807
01:28:57,265 --> 01:29:00,723
"As if the chef would do all this!
Will I cook, or note down numbers?"

808
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:17,506
What's this?
Why have you shut the door?

809
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,055
What if someone saw us?

810
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,991
This isn't America.

811
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,351
"Before the marriage, the bride
and the groom don't meet like this."

812
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,854
Yes, but it isn't that..."

813
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:34,530
what's on your mind...
I know very well.

814
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:39,132
There are just a few days to go.

815
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:43,109
I'll belong only to you then.

816
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,351
Well...
- You... are misunderstanding me.

817
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,193
I...?

818
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,594
What happened?
- What are you doing?

819
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,529
Nothing.
- Please don't do this.

820
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:11,464
What...?
- Now look...

821
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:14,407
it's not right...

822
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:18,812
"it would be a sin before marriage.
- No, I'll do nothing of the sort!"

823
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:23,647
Mother won't approve of it.

824
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,520
Don't be so hasty... there are
just a few days to go.

825
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:29,584
I understand.

826
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,196
Looks like someone has come.
- Yes.

827
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,333
"May I leave?
- Sure, go ahead."

828
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,401
God! God Almighty!

829
01:30:48,976 --> 01:30:53,106
God! What explosion is this in
my house so early in the morning!

830
01:30:57,985 --> 01:30:59,282
Jackie? You?

831
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:03,791
Why's it so dark in this house?

832
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:06,788
"It isn't dark in this house,
it's dark on your eyes."

833
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:09,129
Take off your glasses.

834
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:13,956
"This is Jatin's friend, Jackie.
He has come from America."

835
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:17,794
From America?
The Americans are amazing!

836
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:21,003
They come and leave
like the rockets.

837
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:24,377
Amazing country, America!"

838
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:30,577
God knows when I'll get to go there.
But it's an amazing country!

839
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:36,779
You mustn't laugh at those
who fall. You must pick them up.

840
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:55,802
Out of my way, please."

841
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:06,186
"I mean, it's a slip of tongue.
I'm speaking!"

842
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:09,181
Ramesh here.
- Ramesh? Go on.

843
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:12,190
How will we be able to come
to the henna-applying ceremony?

844
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:15,596
We have guests at home.
I'll send them over.

845
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:19,455
There's Preetam Singh too.
He'll kick up quite a racket there.

846
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:57,461
"My life, my soul
and my youth, my love..."

847
01:32:57,838 --> 01:33:00,739
"I'd bequeath to you"

848
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:11,443
"May you live instead of me..."

849
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:14,253
"and may I die for you"

850
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,386
"So listen to me, my love"

851
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,583
"So listen to me, my love"

852
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:52,451
"without horses and elephants
and an accompanying band..."

853
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:55,796
"I bring a bridal procession
for you"

854
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:59,800
"That God will bless
those in love..."

855
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:03,136
"I come here"

856
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:13,507
"Fetch a pinch of vermillion..."

857
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:16,348
"I'll apply it on you
and make you my bride"

858
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:19,786
"So listen to me, my love"

859
01:34:57,258 --> 01:35:00,227
"The world's a crowded fair..."

860
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:03,462
"but you alone and Ionely"

861
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:10,269
"I wish I could raise my hands
in prayer, and seek you from God"

862
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:21,180
"Before it's too late..."

863
01:35:21,615 --> 01:35:24,778
"I must rush to the temple"

864
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:32,791
"So listen to me, my love"

865
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:48,400
"My life, my soul
and my youth, my love..."

866
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,811
"I'd bequeath to you"

867
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,314
"May you live instead of me..."

868
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:05,023
"and may I die for you"

869
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:08,328
"So listen to me, my love"

870
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:11,194
"So listen to me, my love"

871
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:22,798
"Ma, it's just that...
- You needn't say anything."

872
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:25,205
I've seen it all for myself.

873
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,134
"Tell me the truth.
This is Jatin's bracelet, isn't it?"

874
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:34,276
"Now look, Karishma.
This isn't America, it's India."

875
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:40,777
What you are doing isn't right.
You know your Papa very well.

876
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:45,588
"If he gets to know anything, he'll
make life miserable for all of us."

877
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:48,588
But listen to me...
- I don't want to listen to anything.

878
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:53,790
"Just get what I say
very clearly, Karishma."

879
01:37:54,835 --> 01:38:00,068
You must always tread a path
that takes you to your goal.

880
01:38:01,408 --> 01:38:03,774
"And your goal is Nimesh,
not Jatin."

881
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:07,780
It's in your welfare and ours...

882
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:13,380
that you forget your love forever.

883
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:42,148
"Well, Jatin? Will you live in America
and play the Indian jilted lover?"

884
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:47,485
You had better cry for a day
than weep all your life.

885
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:52,281
I'm with you. Just rise in revolt!

886
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:56,193
Turn the valiant lover and shake
the portals of Rameshbhai's house!

887
01:38:58,098 --> 01:39:03,730
Provided my lady-Iove agrees.
- She will agree. And sing too.

888
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:07,173
"Why be scared,
if you're in love...?"

889
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:18,248
"Son-in-law, what's happening here
quietly, behind closed doors?"

890
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:20,787
We've been drinking...
a soft drink.

891
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:24,124
An American soft-drink.
Will you have some?

892
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:30,723
"If someone offered me poison from
America, I'd drink it with a smile!"

893
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:33,066
And this is only a sop-drink!

894
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:37,464
"Give it to me!
- Not sop-drink, it's soft-drink."

895
01:39:37,838 --> 01:39:40,773
"It's to be drunk, not bathed in.
- Same difference."

896
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:44,207
Give it to me.
- That's mine. I'll give you another.

897
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,578
"He's like our father.
- No, not that father..."

898
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:52,374
the name is Bapalal Patel!

899
01:39:56,924 --> 01:39:58,789
Your English is getting to be
like mine.

900
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,598
It's frothy.

901
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:09,794
Hail America!

902
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,204
Hail Bush!

903
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:15,203
Hail Bill!

904
01:40:18,112 --> 01:40:19,545
Hail Monica!

905
01:40:22,383 --> 01:40:26,251
"I've been looking for you and you're
sitting here, chatting him up?"

906
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,580
Sweet-hut! I haven't
been chatting him up!

907
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:31,954
I'm drinking a soft-drink.

908
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,923
An American soft-drink!

909
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:38,198
An American soft-drink?
- It's amazing!

910
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:41,500
"Come on... try some,
it's fun."

911
01:40:44,838 --> 01:40:46,396
Give me some!

912
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:48,603
Here you are.

913
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:53,574
"Drink it up! It's slightly bitter,
but you must have it."

914
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:00,784
"It's different, isn't it?
- Different in the beginning..."

915
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:03,784
but it's fun later.
Go ahead and drink it!

916
01:41:07,995 --> 01:41:10,429
Wasn't it fun...?

917
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:19,203
It's over.

918
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:36,519
Is there more?
- Oh yes

919
01:41:38,892 --> 01:41:40,291
It's great.

920
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:52,400
Is there more?
- Give Koki some more!

921
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,540
It's great.

922
01:42:01,315 --> 01:42:02,748
One more.

923
01:42:05,385 --> 01:42:07,444
Here you are.
- Frothy stuff!

924
01:42:09,823 --> 01:42:12,121
This American soft-drink
is unbeatable!

925
01:42:22,836 --> 01:42:25,805
D'you have anymore?
- No. It's finished.

926
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:30,402
So what do you think...?
- Fantastic!

927
01:42:31,745 --> 01:42:34,509
The huge kick...
gets to you slowly.

928
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,788
Not in front of the kids.

929
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:44,353
Let's go.

930
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:48,261
"Excuse me, kids.
Good night."

931
01:42:50,898 --> 01:42:52,297
That's mine.

932
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:57,064
Amazing soft-drink! Why don't
we get it in India?

933
01:42:57,838 --> 01:42:59,999
This is a miracle!

934
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:07,446
I've made khandvi for breakfast.
Everybody will like it.

935
01:43:07,814 --> 01:43:10,374
You should've ordered some pizzas.
- Sir! Guruji is here!

936
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:14,184
"Guruji! Go and bring everyone out,
I'll bring Guruji in."

937
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:17,449
Move... don't stand there
like an idiot.

938
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:21,294
Welcome.

939
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:25,127
Bless you.

940
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:31,531
This is the family's Guru.

941
01:43:31,772 --> 01:43:34,138
"And this is daughter's
mother-in-law, Ramaben."

942
01:43:35,075 --> 01:43:37,270
"This is her sister, Rajni.
- Greetings."

943
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:42,047
"That's her husband, Preetam Singh.
She had a love marriage in America."

944
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:46,378
He's a Punjabi guy. But he's
become a true Gujarati now.

945
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:48,583
Greetings.
- Greetings.

946
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:52,790
"Do you know Gujarati?
- I manage to speak a bit, priest!"

947
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:58,791
The son-in-law...?

948
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,900
"Where are you going, son-in-law?
Come down, son."

949
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:06,261
"Guruji, that's our
future son-in-law."

950
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:16,346
Come down here...
and take his blessings.

951
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:18,143
Oh yes. I'm coming.

952
01:44:19,953 --> 01:44:23,184
"Watch it, Guruji.
- You..."

953
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:27,517
"Before you bless me, I must have
a word with you in privacy."

954
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:31,889
"Guruji, my son-in-law wants
a cigarette from you."

955
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,730
You're the limit! A cigarette
is supposed to be smoked!

956
01:44:36,236 --> 01:44:39,330
He means the boy wants to
talk to you in private.

957
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:42,773
I want to have a word with you.
- Please go with him.

958
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:44,939
Please come. Come along.

959
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:50,044
What say? What could he want to
say to the priest in privacy?

960
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:55,283
"Guruji, what we went through and
what you saw was beyond our control."

961
01:44:55,822 --> 01:44:57,687
I have nothing to do
with that girl.

962
01:44:57,891 --> 01:45:00,724
What? Was all that a farce?
- Yes.

963
01:45:01,161 --> 01:45:03,288
We did it because didn't want to
break the old folks' hearts.

964
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:05,896
Please forget all that.
- How can I forget it?

965
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:09,100
How can I lie to this family?
- You'll have to lie!

966
01:45:09,336 --> 01:45:11,531
Or I'll tell everyone
the truth about you.

967
01:45:11,772 --> 01:45:13,740
The truth about me?
What do you mean?

968
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:18,109
"Simple, Guruji. Tell me what
your father did for a living."

969
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:20,746
You're talking about Baba
Jyoti Shankar Dayal?

970
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,777
He was a very well-read man.
- False. He's a car-driver.

971
01:45:25,252 --> 01:45:27,777
And his name is Baba Singh.
He used to drive a truck earlier...

972
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:30,521
and drive through Rajasthan
to reach Delhi.

973
01:45:31,024 --> 01:45:35,791
"En route, he seduced many women
and sired children like you."

974
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:38,593
He's now a taxi-driver
in New York.

975
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:41,126
"Let me tell you, if you don't know.
One of your brothers..."

976
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,803
is a taxi-driver at Delhi airport.
Another's a coolie in Rajasthan.

977
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:46,469
Yet another is a gypsy
and you're the fourth.

978
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:49,600
I don't know how many more...
- Enough!

979
01:45:49,876 --> 01:45:53,812
Please don't let anyone know
about my father's misdeeds.

980
01:45:54,214 --> 01:45:58,014
Those who fall at my feet
will beat me with slippers.

981
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:01,513
You and I will both keep quiet.
Okay?

982
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:04,784
Shall we go now?
- Oh yes. Let's go.

983
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:08,989
"Wow! This is excellent!
- What happened, Guruji?"

984
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:11,795
There can't be a better match!

985
01:46:14,835 --> 01:46:20,137
Not even the sun and the moon...

986
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:23,532
"nobody can prevent your
daughter's marriage, I say!"

987
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:26,242
Make arrangements
for the wedding.

988
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:31,112
What a son-in-law you've found!
He's so resourceful!

989
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,779
Get the sweets! Hurry!

990
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:40,455
Wait till I open the door.
Be patient.

991
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:47,231
Is this Karishma Patel's house?
- Yes. What is it?

992
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:49,662
We've from the state transport.
She had left her luggage in the bus.

993
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:52,200
We brought it on her complaint.
- You've found it?

994
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:54,600
Here it is. Take a look.

995
01:46:56,276 --> 01:46:58,210
Please sign this.

996
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,043
"Uncle Dhansukh, please take
sister's luggage to her room."

997
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:10,450
What's this? Someone has
opened the lock on the bag.

998
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:13,582
He must even have taken out
something from the bag.

999
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:18,531
Let me check what stuff
he has taken for his fiance.

1000
01:48:27,968 --> 01:48:31,734
"I have a crazy heart..."

1001
01:48:32,572 --> 01:48:36,133
"you have a crazy heart too"

1002
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:42,749
"In our craziness lies
the fun of being crazy"

1003
01:48:45,085 --> 01:48:48,782
"You're the one my heart knows.
I'm the one your heart knows"

1004
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:53,187
"Those who love from the depths of
their hearts, are often called crazy"

1005
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:55,993
"I'm crazy about you"

1006
01:48:57,697 --> 01:49:00,222
"You're crazy about me"

1007
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:04,236
"You're crazy about me"

1008
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:08,505
"I'm crazy about you"

1009
01:49:52,018 --> 01:49:55,510
"when I dream about you,
when you come alive in my eyes..."

1010
01:49:55,822 --> 01:49:59,781
"I pray that my dreams
may never be shattered"

1011
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:12,594
"what need do you have
for dreams anymore, my love?"

1012
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:16,603
"Your dreams are now reality"

1013
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:21,400
"You share a strange relationship
with my heart-beat..."

1014
01:51:21,808 --> 01:51:25,801
"every time you remember me,
my heart starts pounding"

1015
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:36,555
"If I'm the heart,
you are my heart-beat..."

1016
01:51:36,823 --> 01:51:40,452
"my heart tells me,
when you suffer a blow..."

1017
01:51:40,827 --> 01:51:42,624
"I'm the one it hurts"

1018
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:45,491
"I'm crazy about you"

1019
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,794
"You're crazy about me"

1020
01:51:51,104 --> 01:51:54,198
"You're crazy about me"

1021
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:58,241
"And I'm crazy about you"

1022
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:04,309
"I have a crazy heart..."

1023
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:08,185
"you have a crazy heart too"

1024
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:14,793
"In our craziness lies
the fun of being crazy"

1025
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:21,261
"You're the one my heart knows.
I'm the one your heart knows"

1026
01:52:21,634 --> 01:52:25,502
"Those who love from the depths of
their hearts, are often called crazy"

1027
01:52:25,839 --> 01:52:28,399
"You're crazy about me"

1028
01:52:29,876 --> 01:52:33,209
"I'm crazy about you"

1029
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:37,110
"I'm crazy about you"

1030
01:52:38,818 --> 01:52:41,446
"You're crazy about me"

1031
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:47,893
I gave you such a lecture last night.
Has it had no effect at all?

1032
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:51,530
Do you want your parents to
drink poison out of shame?

1033
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:56,126
"Dhanji, have this luggage
sent to Bapu Patel's house."

1034
01:52:56,569 --> 01:53:02,474
The journey of your love and the
lipstick marks on this photograph...

1035
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:06,939
amply proves that passions run high
on both sides.

1036
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:15,788
So what am I to do?

1037
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:21,794
What's up, son?"

1038
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:24,790
Whose love makes you
dance like this?

1039
01:53:26,566 --> 01:53:29,194
"It's nothing, Mother.
You know how Jackie is, don't you?"

1040
01:53:29,836 --> 01:53:34,136
"My son, I know Jackie very well.
And I know you well, too."

1041
01:53:35,975 --> 01:53:40,412
Things have reached this stage...
and you hid it from your mother?

1042
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:43,749
"What thing, mother? What have
I hidden from you?"

1043
01:53:44,217 --> 01:53:45,775
This.

1044
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,583
Take a look.

1045
01:53:49,422 --> 01:53:53,119
I'm glad I found these pictures
in your room yesterday.

1046
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:55,556
Or else...?
- It isn't what you think...

1047
01:53:55,862 --> 01:54:00,128
"No matter how smart a kid is, he can
never keep the truth from his mother."

1048
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:02,728
Now tell me the truth.
For my sake.

1049
01:54:35,768 --> 01:54:38,862
It has to do with your life, my son."

1050
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:42,738
"If you wish, I can talk to Bapu Patel
even at this stage."

1051
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:48,110
I don't consider any commitment to be
more important than your happiness.

1052
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:54,048
"No, mother. Nothing is greater
for me than my mother's commitment."

1053
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:57,787
And it is your mother who's asking
you to break the commitment.

1054
01:54:58,825 --> 01:55:03,057
"You don't get carried away and make
such decisions about life, my son."

1055
01:55:03,763 --> 01:55:06,891
Think it over. There are still
some days to go for the wedding.

1056
01:55:13,306 --> 01:55:15,774
Karishma! Come out!

1057
01:55:21,547 --> 01:55:23,777
Jatin...? Here?

1058
01:55:25,218 --> 01:55:27,778
Karishma, it's just that..."

1059
01:55:29,822 --> 01:55:32,188
I'm madly in love with you.

1060
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:37,789
I know you're in love
with me too.

1061
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:40,199
What madness is this?

1062
01:55:43,836 --> 01:55:45,804
It isn't any madness.
It's the truth.

1063
01:55:48,308 --> 01:55:51,641
Karishma and I love each other.
Ask Karishma.

1064
01:55:55,682 --> 01:55:57,843
Tell him the truth, Karishma."

1065
01:55:59,152 --> 01:56:02,053
Tell him that you're not happy
with this marriage.

1066
01:56:02,689 --> 01:56:07,058
"Why don't you speak, Karishma?
Speak up!"

1067
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:13,060
"Karishma's silence is
her answer to you, Jatin."

1068
01:56:13,566 --> 01:56:15,796
"Before I do something reckless,
go away from here!"

1069
01:56:16,169 --> 01:56:18,569
"And don't even think of

1070
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:22,200
"If you remain silent today, Karishma,
you'll regret it all your life."

1071
01:56:23,209 --> 01:56:25,143
Tell him, Karishma"

1072
01:56:25,912 --> 01:56:27,379
why are you silent?

1073
01:56:31,384 --> 01:56:34,046
I'll let you go today
for Bapu Patel's sake.

1074
01:56:34,554 --> 01:56:37,785
"But if I see you in my house again,
I'll kill you!"

1075
01:57:27,273 --> 01:57:29,207
What is the matter, Jatin?"

1076
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:33,535
Looks like you've been
dreaming about Karishma.

1077
01:57:35,948 --> 01:57:39,247
Yes.
- If you only keep dreaming...

1078
01:57:39,485 --> 01:57:41,453
Karishma's even going to
get married someday.

1079
01:57:41,754 --> 01:57:46,521
Your dream of having her will
only remain a pipe dream.

1080
01:57:48,094 --> 01:57:51,791
So listen to me.
And do as I say.

1081
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:05,744
Uncle, is Karishma there?"

1082
01:58:06,112 --> 01:58:07,545
Who's this?

1083
01:58:07,814 --> 01:58:11,113
"This is Jaya here.
- Jaya? How are you, my child?"

1084
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:14,581
"I'm fine, uncle. Please give
the phone to Karishma, uncle."

1085
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:16,855
"Sure, hold on.
I'll get her to talk to you."

1086
01:58:18,825 --> 01:58:20,588
"Karishma, dear.
- Yes, Papa?"

1087
01:58:20,827 --> 01:58:23,057
Jaya has called for you.
Take the phone.

1088
01:58:27,033 --> 01:58:30,730
"Karishma, this is Jatin here.
- Jatin? Why have you called here?"

1089
01:58:31,037 --> 01:58:33,528
"I want to meet you, Karishma. I have
something very important to discuss."

1090
01:58:33,773 --> 01:58:35,741
Why don't you understand, Jatin?"

1091
01:58:36,142 --> 01:58:39,509
"Four days before the wedding, girls in
our family don't step out of the house."

1092
01:58:39,812 --> 01:58:42,178
"You can make the excuse of
going to a temple, can't you?"

1093
01:58:42,882 --> 01:58:45,578
I'll wait for you at Shiva's temple
at 6 this evening.

1094
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:48,782
"If you don't turn up,
I'll come straight to your place."

1095
01:59:14,213 --> 01:59:16,147
What is it, Jatin?"

1096
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:19,114
I'm in love with you, Karishma."

1097
01:59:31,631 --> 01:59:33,599
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

1098
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,261
Don't you love me?

1099
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:39,399
No.

1100
01:59:43,809 --> 01:59:45,743
If you're not in love with me...

1101
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:48,778
why did you break all traditions
to come and meet me?

1102
01:59:50,349 --> 01:59:53,318
You kept looking at me from the
balcony on the day of the ceremony...

1103
01:59:53,486 --> 01:59:56,580
wasn't that love too?
And this...?

1104
01:59:57,223 --> 01:59:59,191
Isn't this proof enough
of your love?

1105
02:00:01,494 --> 02:00:06,796
"Yes, I love you!
You're the I love, Jatin."

1106
02:00:22,949 --> 02:00:24,849
So get married to me.

1107
02:00:29,121 --> 02:00:33,785
"You know it, Jatin.
If I say yes to you..."

1108
02:00:34,327 --> 02:00:36,295
it'll kill my father.

1109
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:41,792
The future of my sisters...

1110
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:44,795
and the honour of the family
will be rendered to dust.

1111
02:00:45,838 --> 02:00:49,604
"I don't want that to happen, Jatin.
I don't want that."

1112
02:00:50,076 --> 02:00:52,374
"You're the one who's got
to lead your life, Karishma."

1113
02:00:52,878 --> 02:00:56,507
How will you live with someone
you don't love? Think it over.

1114
02:00:58,584 --> 02:01:01,485
The storm you're afraid of...
will die on its own.

1115
02:01:02,555 --> 02:01:05,786
"Or else, we'll be
separated forever."

1116
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:15,790
"Jatin, we meet so many people
in ourjourney through life."

1117
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:19,600
Not everyone has the
same destination.

1118
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:24,803
Maybe God has set different
destinations for the two of us.

1119
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:28,802
"Listen to me, Karishma!
For the sake of our love!"

1120
02:01:29,148 --> 02:01:32,777
If only we could kill our love!

1121
02:01:33,819 --> 02:01:36,310
Forget me, Jatin. Forget me."

1122
02:02:32,111 --> 02:02:35,444
"Love gives us laughter..."

1123
02:02:35,815 --> 02:02:39,182
"Love gives us tears"

1124
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:43,186
"Love makes us"

1125
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:47,047
"Love breaks us"

1126
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:54,591
"And yet, every man has
a fascination for love"

1127
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:07,136
"Love..."

1128
02:04:08,607 --> 02:04:10,871
"is beautiful"

1129
02:04:12,244 --> 02:04:15,941
"Seen through the heart..."

1130
02:04:16,248 --> 02:04:18,773
"it's devastating"

1131
02:04:19,952 --> 02:04:23,115
"Love gives us pain.
Love gives us wounds..."

1132
02:04:23,556 --> 02:04:26,252
"Love gives us a yearning"

1133
02:04:27,593 --> 02:04:34,294
"why then is the world
mad about love...?"

1134
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:38,331
"Love gives us laughter..."

1135
02:04:38,771 --> 02:04:42,002
"Love gives us tears"

1136
02:04:42,741 --> 02:04:46,006
"Love makes us"

1137
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:49,974
"Love breaks us"

1138
02:04:50,749 --> 02:04:56,779
"And yet, every man has
a fascination for love"

1139
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:43,802
"without you, my love..."

1140
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:47,300
"there's a void in the world"

1141
02:05:48,474 --> 02:05:51,841
"My heart's in agony,
I pine for you..."

1142
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:55,146
"where am I to go?"

1143
02:05:55,881 --> 02:05:59,248
"I walk a few steps
and pause..."

1144
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:02,385
"I wonder where you are"

1145
02:06:03,155 --> 02:06:06,784
"Heed my cries...
come to me"

1146
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:10,593
"Hold me in an embrace...
wherever you are"

1147
02:06:10,996 --> 02:06:14,523
"Love gives us laughter..."

1148
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:18,291
"Love gives us tears"

1149
02:06:18,771 --> 02:06:22,138
"Love makes us"

1150
02:06:22,508 --> 02:06:25,841
"Love breaks us"

1151
02:06:26,378 --> 02:06:32,749
"And yet, every man has
a fascination for love"

1152
02:07:19,131 --> 02:07:21,099
He has to appear for his exams.
- I see.

1153
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:23,368
I'm sorry to be late.

1154
02:07:24,103 --> 02:07:26,071
Please start eating.

1155
02:07:26,839 --> 02:07:30,775
"Karishma isn't here. Where's she?
- Sister isn't hungry, Papa."

1156
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:32,440
Why not?

1157
02:07:32,811 --> 02:07:34,745
The very idea of leaving
their parents' house...

1158
02:07:34,947 --> 02:07:36,710
kills the girls' hunger.

1159
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:44,789
Please start, Deepakbhai."

1160
02:07:59,271 --> 02:08:00,533
Papa? You?

1161
02:08:00,773 --> 02:08:04,004
"You've grown up, and you're still
at the "l-won't-eat" stubbornness?"

1162
02:08:04,309 --> 02:08:06,243
I'm not hungry, Papa."

1163
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:12,780
I'll feed my daughter with my hands.
She's bound to feel hungry.

1164
02:08:14,653 --> 02:08:19,522
"Remember? As a child, you used to
run all over the place..."

1165
02:08:19,825 --> 02:08:22,794
and I used to chase you
with the plate in my hand.

1166
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:27,958
When I used to pretend
to be exhausted...

1167
02:08:28,233 --> 02:08:32,533
you would relent and eat it up.
It used to make me very happy.

1168
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:40,735
"My child, I come looking for
the same happiness even today."

1169
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:48,451
Eat as much as you want to.

1170
02:08:48,821 --> 02:08:52,780
"I'll eat on my own, Papa.
- No, my child."

1171
02:08:54,426 --> 02:08:59,125
I don't know if I will ever have
the opportunity to pamper you again.

1172
02:09:02,434 --> 02:09:03,731
Eat.

1173
02:09:12,077 --> 02:09:14,011
What happened, Papa?"

1174
02:09:15,214 --> 02:09:18,149
You were a baby then...
about 10 or 11 months old.

1175
02:09:20,219 --> 02:09:22,779
You had just about four teeth.

1176
02:09:24,823 --> 02:09:28,589
"When I fed you a biscuit,
you used to bite my finger..."

1177
02:09:28,827 --> 02:09:30,727
and laugh so much.

1178
02:09:36,268 --> 02:09:38,736
You had a different way of
even asking for chocolates.

1179
02:09:39,838 --> 02:09:44,468
"You said,"Papa, eating chocolates
spoils the teeth, isn't it?"

1180
02:09:45,811 --> 02:09:49,508
"Mine will get spoilt, too.
I don't want any chocolates."

1181
02:09:50,249 --> 02:09:54,447
No chocolates from today.
That was it...

1182
02:09:54,820 --> 02:10:00,781
I'd fall for your trick and
immediately get chocolates for you.

1183
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:07,128
You have fulfilled
every whim of mine.

1184
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:12,604
"From the smallest of things,
you gave me whatever I chose."

1185
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:20,801
So what made you think that I'd force
you to marry against your wishes?

1186
02:10:25,417 --> 02:10:30,377
"Yes, my dear. I know you're
in love with Jatin."

1187
02:10:31,824 --> 02:10:34,190
So why are you marrying
Nimesh then?

1188
02:10:35,561 --> 02:10:39,793
"Because my Papa, who fulfills
my every whim, wants that to happen."

1189
02:10:40,566 --> 02:10:42,534
And I can't refuse him.

1190
02:10:43,969 --> 02:10:48,804
But it's your Papa who's giving you
the freedom to marry Jatin.

1191
02:10:49,208 --> 02:10:55,841
"No, Papa. It's like the arrow that
will wreak havoc, if called back."

1192
02:10:59,885 --> 02:11:02,376
You have brought me up
like a son.

1193
02:11:03,222 --> 02:11:07,283
People ask for sons so
that their lineage will live.

1194
02:11:08,627 --> 02:11:12,461
So that their pride and honour
is always maintained.

1195
02:11:13,832 --> 02:11:18,531
Why must I take a step that will
render your respect to dust?

1196
02:11:19,238 --> 02:11:21,206
And give you a bad name?

1197
02:11:21,874 --> 02:11:25,275
No, Papa. I do love Jatin."

1198
02:11:26,144 --> 02:11:29,545
But my parents, my sisters..."

1199
02:11:29,882 --> 02:11:33,511
I love equally too.
I've fallen in love...

1200
02:11:33,819 --> 02:11:35,912
but what wrong have
my sisters done?

1201
02:11:36,288 --> 02:11:40,588
"What wrong has my friend Jaya done?
What right have I, Papa..."

1202
02:11:40,826 --> 02:11:43,590
of shattering their dreams?

1203
02:11:54,106 --> 02:11:58,133
"Everyone is born with
his destiny, my child."

1204
02:11:58,877 --> 02:12:03,177
Why are you worried about others?
- Because I don't want people...

1205
02:12:03,315 --> 02:12:05,249
to poke fun at you.

1206
02:12:05,817 --> 02:12:10,151
"They'll say,"The president
couldn't handle his own daughter"

1207
02:12:10,956 --> 02:12:13,322
You command so much of respect
in society.

1208
02:12:13,825 --> 02:12:16,794
"Your decisions are revered
by everyone, Papa."

1209
02:12:18,096 --> 02:12:21,588
"What is it with people, my dear?
They will become quiet..."

1210
02:12:21,833 --> 02:12:25,792
after they've poked some fun.
But you will at least have your love.

1211
02:12:27,973 --> 02:12:32,774
"For the sake of my love, I can't
give your love a stigma, Papa."

1212
02:12:33,245 --> 02:12:35,543
I can't bear to see
your pride being squandered.

1213
02:12:37,182 --> 02:12:40,583
"But, my child,
to save my pride..."

1214
02:12:40,819 --> 02:12:44,585
I can't bear to see
my darling daughter in sorrow.

1215
02:12:46,825 --> 02:12:50,317
"This is our culture, Papa.
We'll sacrifice our lives..."

1216
02:12:50,529 --> 02:12:54,226
but never compromise our honour.
I'll marry only Nimesh.

1217
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,129
I'll marry only Nimesh.

1218
02:14:27,092 --> 02:14:30,323
"They've arrived!
Koki, come out quickly!"

1219
02:14:30,562 --> 02:14:32,996
It has arrived!
- What has arrived?

1220
02:14:33,265 --> 02:14:36,462
The funeral has arrived!
- God! Whose funeral is it?

1221
02:14:36,768 --> 02:14:39,464
It's the son-in-law!
Can't you hear the band?

1222
02:14:40,105 --> 02:14:44,542
God! We've met on earth.
Please don't meet me in hell.

1223
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:46,675
Why not?
- It isn't a funeral.

1224
02:14:46,812 --> 02:14:49,576
It's called a procession!
- Same difference...

1225
02:14:49,815 --> 02:14:54,184
"you get it, don't you?
So hurry up and get cracking!"

1226
02:15:16,908 --> 02:15:20,071
Hurry up guys! Dinner will start
as soon as the ritual is over!

1227
02:15:20,312 --> 02:15:21,745
Hurry up!

1228
02:15:31,823 --> 02:15:33,791
Put that in the couple's hands.

1229
02:16:53,171 --> 02:16:56,299
Fantastic!
There are two weddings here!

1230
02:16:56,608 --> 02:16:58,542
Here's Bapalal's daughter's wedding.

1231
02:16:58,777 --> 02:17:02,770
And that's Rameshbhai's daughter's
wedding! Jatin's getting married here.

1232
02:17:03,148 --> 02:17:07,209
And Karishma's getting married there.
Two weddings! This is fun!

1233
02:17:12,324 --> 02:17:14,519
Now begins the next of our rituals.

1234
02:17:33,612 --> 02:17:34,544
What happened?

1235
02:18:00,205 --> 02:18:02,105
Someone put out the fire!

1236
02:18:18,823 --> 02:18:21,587
Someone put out the fire!
Karishma's in there!

1237
02:18:28,833 --> 02:18:30,528
Papa! Help!

1238
02:18:40,211 --> 02:18:41,143
Help!

1239
02:18:59,497 --> 02:19:03,058
Help, Papa! Help!"

1240
02:19:05,904 --> 02:19:07,667
Someone save Karishma!

1241
02:19:07,939 --> 02:19:11,466
Karishma's caught in the fire!
Someone save her...

1242
02:19:11,710 --> 02:19:13,371
call the fire-brigade, someone!"

1243
02:19:15,814 --> 02:19:17,748
Save Karishma someone!

1244
02:20:08,233 --> 02:20:10,793
Get up, Karishma! Get up!"

1245
02:20:14,839 --> 02:20:16,602
Get up! C'mon!

1246
02:21:07,158 --> 02:21:08,921
My child! Open your eyes!

1247
02:21:14,833 --> 02:21:17,802
"Open your eyes, Karishma!
Open your eyes..."

1248
02:21:21,873 --> 02:21:24,603
Nothing can happen to you!
Nothing!

1249
02:21:26,578 --> 02:21:29,843
I won't let anything happen to you!
Nothing will happen to you!

1250
02:21:31,816 --> 02:21:36,116
"Wake up, Karishma...
I can't live without you!"

1251
02:21:40,859 --> 02:21:43,521
Open your eyes! Karishma!

1252
02:22:19,998 --> 02:22:21,795
I love you very much...

1253
02:22:22,567 --> 02:22:24,364
I can't live without you.

1254
02:22:30,108 --> 02:22:32,406
I can't live without you.

1255
02:22:36,915 --> 02:22:38,780
What's all this?

1256
02:22:39,617 --> 02:22:43,781
"What's happening here?
- This is natural justice, Nimesh."

1257
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:48,354
No matter how hard man tries...

1258
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:53,259
no one can separate those
whom God wishes to unite.

1259
02:22:53,531 --> 02:22:56,056
What do you mean?
She's my fiance!

1260
02:22:56,334 --> 02:23:00,236
She was your fiance.
Till such time...

1261
02:23:00,471 --> 02:23:04,532
that you left her in a burning altar
to save your life.

1262
02:23:06,277 --> 02:23:11,738
I'm glad God opened my eyes
before you could take the vows.

1263
02:23:12,116 --> 02:23:14,584
"What rubbish is this, Rameshbhai?
Are you in your right senses?"

1264
02:23:14,953 --> 02:23:18,116
My heart always ignored.
I used only my senses.

1265
02:23:20,191 --> 02:23:26,289
I was strangling my daughter's love
to adhere to traditions.

1266
02:23:27,832 --> 02:23:32,735
A companion for life is one who
stands by her in joy and sorrow.

1267
02:23:33,771 --> 02:23:39,107
"And who stood by whom, you saw...
so did everybody else here."

1268
02:23:39,811 --> 02:23:44,510
What rubbish are you talking...?
Jatin's going to be my son-in-law.

1269
02:23:44,816 --> 02:23:46,784
He'll marry only my daughter.

1270
02:23:47,018 --> 02:23:48,781
No, Papa."

1271
02:23:49,821 --> 02:23:51,789
This marriage can't
take place anymore.

1272
02:23:52,156 --> 02:23:54,784
"What are you saying, Jaya?
- Yes, Mother."

1273
02:23:56,828 --> 02:24:01,322
"A marriage isn't just about
taking the vows, mother."

1274
02:24:03,067 --> 02:24:06,730
Marriage is a union of hearts.

1275
02:24:08,272 --> 02:24:12,538
Till such time as both come
to love and worship each other...

1276
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:15,108
there's no meaning to the marriage.

1277
02:24:22,487 --> 02:24:27,390
Jatin and Karishma love
and worship each other already.

1278
02:24:29,327 --> 02:24:33,058
There's no place for me
in his heart.

1279
02:24:35,233 --> 02:24:37,201
Didn't you always tell me, Papa?"

1280
02:24:38,770 --> 02:24:42,729
Never go to the place
you don't belong.

1281
02:24:44,809 --> 02:24:46,743
Am I right?

1282
02:24:52,216 --> 02:24:54,776
As they say...

1283
02:25:00,058 --> 02:25:02,219
These relationships
are decided in heaven.

1284
02:25:16,874 --> 02:25:20,776
"My word! You've done
the right thing, my child."

1285
02:25:21,813 --> 02:25:25,249
This craze of America had
driven me mad actually.

1286
02:25:25,817 --> 02:25:27,785
But you've opened my eyes today.

1287
02:25:29,821 --> 02:25:34,781
"Rameshbhai, Jatin and Karishma
will be married in our house."

1288
02:25:35,226 --> 02:25:36,784
What?
- Oh yes.

1289
02:25:37,228 --> 02:25:39,788
Play the band, guys!"

1290
02:25:46,337 --> 02:25:51,365
"Here and there..."

1291
02:25:51,776 --> 02:25:56,406
"on both sides is the fire of passion
and desire"

1292
02:25:56,948 --> 02:25:58,848
"You and I..."

1293
02:26:02,153 --> 02:26:06,590
"You and I are so far..."

1294
02:26:06,824 --> 02:26:08,792
"and yet so close"
