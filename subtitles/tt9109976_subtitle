1
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,000
Please!

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,320
Please!

3
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Sir, who is the victim
who was abducted?

4
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Muthu!

5
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Muthuraman!
-Yes, sir?

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Muthuraman!
-Yes, sir?

7
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
what time?
-Must be around an hour ago, sir.

8
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,600
Is this the girl
who was abducted last night?

9
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes, sir.
-Are you sure?

10
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes. The killer's signature
is right there.

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes. The killer's signature
is right there.

12
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,960
Sir!

13
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm at the scene, sir.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm at the scene, sir.

15
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Yes, sir.
The head is missing.

16
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,000
They are on the way, sir.

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,120
They are on the way, sir.

18
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,600
Sir!
-Okay, sir.

19
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,520
Please back away, madam.

20
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Sir, let me just check
if there is a mole on her leg.

21
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
Sumathi!

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sumathi!
It's not our Rupa, right?

23
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey God!

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,480
Hey God!

25
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,160
Vanakkam, listeners.

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
This is your friend,
Dagini, speaking.

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is your friend,
Dagini, speaking.

28
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,200
Our guest on today's show...

29
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,000
...is an important woman
from Tamil Nadu.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
...is an important woman
from Tamil Nadu.

31
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,000
A psychiatrist
from the district of Coimbatore.

32
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,000
We'll be talking
to Dr. Susheela Madhavan today.

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
Women are abducted.

34
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,080
The next morning,...

35
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,000
...their bodies are displayed
in some secluded area.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,240
...their bodies are displayed
in some secluded area.

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,640
But without their heads.

38
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,000
It's odd, madam. What do you.....
-Trophy.

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,920
...clothes, undergarments
or a body part.

40
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,560
That's his medal.
His award.

41
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,000
For this serial killer,
it's a woman's head.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
For this serial killer,
it's a woman's head.

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
What would he do with it?
-It's a fantasy play.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,080
What would he do with it?
-It's a fantasy play.

45
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,000
He could either talk,
laugh, make fun...

46
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,000
...or get angry with the head.

47
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,040
His anger towards the victim
has not come to an end.

48
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,000
None of the 13 abducted women
were sexually assaulted. Why?

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,760
None of the 13 abducted women
were sexually assaulted. Why?

50
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
He doesn't like sex.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,040
Or he probably can't have sex.

52
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,600
So, what's the difference between
a psychopath and serial killer?

53
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,000
They are the same.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,040
And if one does kill,
it means his humanity is lost...

55
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,320
...and has been replaced
by cruelty.

56
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,000
That feral creature
is called a psychopath.

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,520
...religion or honour?

58
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,880
All of them are
psychopathologically affected.

59
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,000
If the man next door keeps
beating his wife for 3 years,...

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,160
Parents who kill their own
daughters for marrying...

61
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,480
...outside of their caste
are also psychopath.

62
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
A person who kills a person
from another faith...

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
A person who kills a person
from another faith...

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,200
...in the name of religion
is also deemed a psychopath.

65
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,000
That was a revelation.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
That was a revelation.

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
Thank you so much, madam.

68
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,280
Here's something for you.
'Catch the Killer'.

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,000
You can check out this Twitter page
and share your opinion.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
You can check out this Twitter page
and share your opinion.

71
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,000
If you meet anyone suspicious,
you can inform the police.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,640
If you meet anyone suspicious,
you can inform the police.

73
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,640
Hello, madam.

74
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,920
She is my daughter.
Sit down.

75
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,680
Diamond sutra
may look like a book.

76
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
But it is really the body
of Buddha.

77
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,000
It is also your body,
my body, all possible bodies.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,800
It is also your body,
my body, all possible bodies.

79
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,200
But it is the body with nothing
inside and nothing outside.

80
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,440
How did he know
that you'd come to the library?

81
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,200
He knows
my entire routine, dad.

82
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Just tell him
to stop bothering you.

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Just tell him
to stop bothering you.

84
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,080
I've told him 3 times already.
No use.

85
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,480
Did we screw up, my boy?

86
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Gucci Blue.
-What?

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Gucci Blue.
-What?

88
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,600
Her perfume, brother.

89
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,880
You go next.
Come, Shakthi.

90
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,000
Was the vehicle parked here?
-Yes, sir.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Was the vehicle parked here?
-Yes, sir.

92
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Who told you the vehicle is here?
-My maid told me.

93
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
When did she see it?

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,280
When did she see it?

95
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,280
As she was going home after work.
-What time did she see it?

96
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,000
About 3.15 or 3.30, sir.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,600
About 3.15 or 3.30, sir.

98
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,600
When did your daughter
leave the house?

99
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,520
At 3 pm sharp.

100
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,000
Did you call her
when you saw the vehicle here?

101
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Any other vehicle
parked here at that time?

102
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
I questioned everyone in this area.

103
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,760
Nobody seems to know anything, sir.

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What? The killer abducted
the girl in broad daylight.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
What? The killer abducted
the girl in broad daylight.

106
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,640
Wasn't anyone on the road?
Were they all laying eggs at home?

107
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,000
They were all watching
Bigg Boss at home.

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
They were all watching
Bigg Boss at home.

109
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
Come on!

110
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,000
Sir, please find
my daughter's killer.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
Sir, please find
my daughter's killer.

112
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,000
I need to ask him
something, sir.

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
I need to ask him
something, sir.

114
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,560
I want to ask him
why he killed my daughter.

115
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
Sir, come on.
-Why is he singing, sir?

116
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll tell you.
Come on.

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,400
Where are the cactus plants?
-Over there.

118
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,000
First time we've come
to this farm, right?

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,800
First time we've come
to this farm, right?

120
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,240
Nice, right?
-Look at those.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is the best nursery
in town, my boy.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is the best nursery
in town, my boy.

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,000
The plant in front of you
is called Confuscia Daginia.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,200
The plant in front of you
is called Confuscia Daginia.

125
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,440
If you pluck a flower from it,
all your wishes will come true.

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,000
Where is it, brother?
-Step forward.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Where is it, brother?
-Step forward.

128
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,120
Catch.

129
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Excuse me!

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,480
Excuse me!

131
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Excuse me, madam.

132
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,360
My friend is blind.
Please let him stand here.

133
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,000
Of course he can.
Please come.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
Of course he can.
Please come.

135
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,400
Come on,
we've got permission.

136
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you.
-Forward. Thank you.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Thank you.
-Forward. Thank you.

138
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Thank you.

139
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,720
Must you keep coming
behind her like this?

140
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,000
He'll be up ahead
pretty soon, sir.

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
He'll be up ahead
pretty soon, sir.

142
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
My boy!
-Brother?

143
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,000
Music conductor, Zubin Mehta,
left a missed call.

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
Brother, Dagini is fine, right?
-You wretch!

145
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,800
I made the reservation.
Could you please check the system?

146
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,000
We've not received
any confirmation from you.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
We've not received
any confirmation from you.

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,520
How can you say
there's no reservation?

149
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,120
No, sir,
there is no room available.

150
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,000
Excuse me! What's wrong?

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
Excuse me! What's wrong?

152
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,960
All the rooms under tariff
has been booked, sir.

153
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,720
Give them an executive suite
under the tariff they booked on.

154
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,760
Sure, sir.

155
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,840
Nice arrangements, right?

156
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,000
Hey, Dagini! Come!

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
Hey, Dagini! Come!

158
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,760
Who's the guy
conducting the orchestra?

159
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,000
That guy?
My brother's friend.

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,040
Yes.
-I doubt it.

161
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,560
Give me your cell phone.

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,840
What for?
-Just give me.

163
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,000
Give me my phone, mom.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Give me my phone, mom.

165
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Get out of here,
you fraud!

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,560
Get out of here,
you fraud!

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,160
I'm talking to you.
Can't you hear?

168
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,000
You keep standing here.
-Dagini.

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,040
You keep standing here.
-Dagini.

170
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,600
Get off the stage.
-What are you doing, Dagini?

171
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
He's a cheat, dad.
-Why are you doing this?

172
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,000
What are you doing?
He's my brother's friend.

173
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What are you doing?
He's my brother's friend.

174
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,560
That's a lie.
He lied to you.

175
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,000
Why are you still standing here?
Get out.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,360
Why are you still standing here?
Get out.

177
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,040
Get out of here.
-Dagini, enough! Come here!

178
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,080
Come here, I say.
-Let go of me, dad.

179
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Dagini!
Just get out!

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
Dagini!
Just get out!

181
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,640
What are you doing?

182
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,000
Why did you do such a thing?
Come on!

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,840
Why did you do such a thing?
Come on!

184
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,080
Shall we go, brother?
-Go where?

185
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,480
We can't go anywhere.
You lied your way in here, right?

186
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Now go up on stage
and tell the truth. Come on!

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,720
Now go up on stage
and tell the truth. Come on!

188
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,920
Where, brother?
-Come along.

189
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,680
Here, sit down.

190
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,600
Sit down.

191
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,640
Here, go ahead and sing.

192
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,000
Sing about your love.

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,080
Sing about your love.

194
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,040
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

196
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,200
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

198
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,480
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

199
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

201
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,000
Who could she be,the breeze that caresses me...

202
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,480
Who could she be,the breeze that caresses me...

203
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
Who could she be, the mother'svoice that lulls me...

204
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,200
Who could she be, the mother'svoice that lulls me...

205
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

206
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,200
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

207
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,000
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

208
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,680
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

209
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,000
Fragrance and faint soundsare my only kin...

210
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,960
Fragrance and faint soundsare my only kin...

211
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,000
The longest night on earth

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,240
The longest night on earth

213
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
Because of you,I found myself...

214
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,680
Because of you,I found myself...

215
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
I closed my eyesand fell in love...

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,680
I closed my eyesand fell in love...

217
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Even though I cannot see,you are the path I seek...

218
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
Even though I cannot see,you are the path I seek...

219
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,000
To you, words of loveare all I have to say....

220
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,280
To you, words of loveare all I have to say....

221
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,000
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

222
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

223
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

224
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,720
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

225
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,000
Is he someone who knows notthe richness of colours...

226
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,160
Is he someone who knows notthe richness of colours...

227
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is he someone who knows nothow to open his heart...

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
Is he someone who knows nothow to open his heart...

229
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,000
You are the holy scripturethat echoes in my ears...

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,120
You are the holy scripturethat echoes in my ears...

231
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,000
You are the lightbestowed by the almighty...

232
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,440
You are the lightbestowed by the almighty...

233
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,840
You are the lovethat I hold in my hand...

234
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,160
Without you,I would drown away in tears...

235
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,560
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

236
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

237
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

238
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,000
Who could she be,the breeze that caresses me...

239
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,360
Who could she be,the breeze that caresses me...

240
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,000
Who could she be, the mother'svoice that lulls me...

241
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,360
Who could she be, the mother'svoice that lulls me...

242
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,000
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

243
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,600
In your thoughts,I melt away like a candle...

244
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,000
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
Casting aside my heart,she flies away like a wisp...

246
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,840
Some girl she is!
-Don't talk ill about Dagini.

247
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,680
What do you mean?
You'll never learn.

248
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
You love her deeply.
She doesn't understand it at all.

249
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,360
You love her deeply.
She doesn't understand it at all.

250
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,520
How can she understand
through all this?

251
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,160
Like every other guy,
I go behind her.

252
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,000
The day she realises I'd give up
my life for her,...

253
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
The day she realises I'd give up
my life for her,...

254
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,080
...she'll accept my love.

255
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,000
Brother!
-Yes?

256
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
Brother!
-Yes?

257
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,680
Shall we wait for a while?
-What for?

258
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,320
Dagini will surely come.

259
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,120
Gautham!

262
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm really sorry.
-It's all right, Dagini.

263
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,440
I'm really sorry.
-It's all right, Dagini.

264
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,000
I didn't know
you would fall down.

265
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,600
I didn't know
you would fall down.

266
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
It has been a long time
since I fell, Dagini.

267
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,840
Please understand, Gautham.

268
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,000
I can't take pity and love you
just because you're blind.

269
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,560
I can't take pity and love you
just because you're blind.

270
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm not asking you to love me.
I only said that I love you.

271
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm not asking you to love me.
I only said that I love you.

272
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
Sounds so childish.

273
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,000
One can only love
if they feel like a child, Dagini.

274
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,120
One can only love
if they feel like a child, Dagini.

275
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,440
I know I can't convince you.

276
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,600
You really liked my song,
didn't you?

277
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,200
It was just an average song.
-You're lying.

278
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,000
I saw your face.
-What?

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,160
I saw your face.
-What?

280
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,000
On hearing a few music chords,
even an angry face turns peaceful.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,480
On hearing a few music chords,
even an angry face turns peaceful.

282
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
I can't reason with you.

283
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,000
All right, how do you know
where I'm going?

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,760
All right, how do you know
where I'm going?

285
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,360
How are you able
to follow me around like this?

286
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,400
I paid Rs500
to your office boy.

287
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,000
Rs2,000 to your housemaid.
-Is that so?

288
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,320
Rs2,000 to your housemaid.
-Is that so?

289
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm going somewhere tomorrow.
Even my dad doesn't know about it.

290
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,600
I'm going somewhere tomorrow.
Even my dad doesn't know about it.

291
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,640
I'll see how you follow me there.
-I'll come wherever you go.

292
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay, let's see how
you find me tomorrow.

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,240
Okay, let's see how
you find me tomorrow.

294
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll definitely come.
Give me a clue.

295
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,520
I'll definitely come.
Give me a clue.

296
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,880
No matter what clue I give,
you won't figure it out. Bye!

297
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
What if I figure it out
and find you?

298
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,000
You won't.
-Your birthday is this Sunday.

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,040
You won't.
-Your birthday is this Sunday.

300
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,960
If I were to figure this one out,
will you invite me...

301
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
...to your birthday?

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,280
...to your birthday?

303
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,560
Okay. If you pull this off,
you'll be my chief guest.

304
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,000
Thank you.
You didn't give me a clue.

305
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,080
Thank you.
You didn't give me a clue.

306
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,320
Listen to my show
tomorrow morning.

307
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,880
The clue will be in there.

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
By the way,
your song was really nice.

309
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,160
By the way,
your song was really nice.

310
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,680
Thanks, Dagini.

311
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,240
Go right!

312
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,000
Go left!
Move to the right! Good grief!

313
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,760
Keep going!
I'm scared as hell! Stop!

314
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,720
Take a right!
Keep going!

315
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
Go left.

316
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,200
Go left.

317
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,680
Good morning, dear friends.

318
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,760
This is your friend,
Dagini, speaking.

319
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll recite a few lines
written by Pablo Neruda,...

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,720
I'll recite a few lines
written by Pablo Neruda,...

321
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,680
...the world's greatest poet.

322
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm waiting for you
like a quiet house.

323
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,720
I'm waiting for you
like a quiet house.

324
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,800
Until you come
and live with me.

325
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,000
Today's food for thought.
India's first passenger train...

326
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,240
Today's food for thought.
India's first passenger train...

327
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,720
...travelled from Bombay's
Bori Bunder Station to Thane.

328
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
Do a Google search
on your phone.

329
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,880
Do a Google search
on your phone.

330
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,760
I'll see you
at the same time tomorrow.

331
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,960
Yours truly, Dagini.

332
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,560
Excuse me, who are you?
-You know me.

333
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
What? I don't recall
ever seeing you before.

334
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,960
What? I don't recall
ever seeing you before.

335
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,800
You talk on your show
every day.

336
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,000
Sit down.
-Please.

337
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Sit down.
-Please.

338
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Dagini!

339
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,280
Dagini!

340
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What time did you get here?
-Exactly 7 pm, sir.

341
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,200
What time did you get here?
-Exactly 7 pm, sir.

342
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,080
When you got here,
what did you see?

343
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,240
I mean, what did you realise?

344
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,000
Don't waste time, sir.
He kidnapped Dagini.

345
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,920
Don't waste time, sir.
He kidnapped Dagini.

346
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,720
He might kill her anytime now.

347
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,320
We must first confirm
if it was Dagini.

348
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,000
It was definitely Dagini, sir.
She came here to see me.

349
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,120
It was definitely Dagini, sir.
She came here to see me.

350
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,240
Why did you come here to see her?
-When I met her yesterday,...

351
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,800
...she told me she'd give me
a clue on her show.

352
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,000
If I were to crack it,
she told me I could meet her here.

353
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,720
If I were to crack it,
she told me I could meet her here.

354
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,240
What clue is that?

355
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,000
She talked a lot about her mother
on her last show.

356
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
She talked a lot about her mother
on her last show.

357
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,920
She also spoke about
India's railway line.

358
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,760
Then she spoke about India's first
passenger railway line.

359
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,000
I checked where the first train
line was set up in Coimbatore.

360
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
I checked where the first train
line was set up in Coimbatore.

361
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,000
I checked the cities
along that route.

362
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,680
I figured that was the clue.

363
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Periyanaickenpalayam
was part of it. So, I came here.

364
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,200
Periyanaickenpalayam
was part of it. So, I came here.

365
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,680
How did you know
she'd come to this specific.....

366
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
Her mother was born here, sir.
I've followed Dagini here twice...

367
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
Her mother was born here, sir.
I've followed Dagini here twice...

368
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,760
...when she came
to visit her mother's grave.

369
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,640
What happened, sir?
My daughter's car is here.

370
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,000
Where is my daughter, sir?

371
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,560
Where is my daughter, sir?

372
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,640
We've just started
the investigation.

373
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,360
Please be patient.
-What happened, sir?

374
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,000
Where is my daughter?

375
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,240
Where is my daughter?

376
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,000
She came all this way here
to meet you.

377
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
What did you do to her?
-Sir, please.

378
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,120
What did you do to her?
-Sir, please.

379
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,680
I've lost my daughter.

380
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,440
Aren't you afraid?

381
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm going to kill you.
-I know.

382
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm going to kill you.
-I know.

383
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,160
Then why are you smiling?

384
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,000
Because I'll be your last victim
that you will ever kill.

385
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,880
Because I'll be your last victim
that you will ever kill.

386
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,440
What?

387
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,000
After this, you won't be able
to kill anyone else.

388
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,280
After this, you won't be able
to kill anyone else.

389
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,600
Will the cops catch me?
-Gautham will stop you.

390
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,920
Who is he?

391
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,320
Remember the man who came by
when you abducted me?

392
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,000
That blind guy?
-He will stop you.

393
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That blind guy?
-He will stop you.

394
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
If you kill me now,
my birthday is 7 days away.

395
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,840
If you kill me now,
my birthday is 7 days away.

396
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,560
By then, he will find you.

397
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,000
If you don't kill me,
7 days from now,...

398
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,400
If you don't kill me,
7 days from now,...

399
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
...he'll take me away from here.

400
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,840
...he'll take me away from here.

401
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,680
Aren't you scared?

402
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,600
Excuse me!

403
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,320
Get the CDs
from the dashboard.

404
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,960
There are chocolates here.

405
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,560
You can have it.

406
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,000
Let him come looking for you.
Let him find me.

407
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,960
Let him come looking for you.
Let him find me.

408
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,480
I'll sever your head
and give it to him.

409
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,000
I'll sever his head
and give it to you.

410
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,640
I'll sever his head
and give it to you.

411
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
Until then, you remain here.

412
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,000
Sir! What's the connection
between you and Dagini?

413
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,080
Sir! What's the connection
between you and Dagini?

414
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,960
Do you know Dagini
who was abducted?

415
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,240
What were you doing
at the train station?

416
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,120
Why must he abduct Dagini?
-She is beautiful, sir.

417
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,000
No, Akbar. The killer is not
interested in the victim's look.

418
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,720
No, Akbar. The killer is not
interested in the victim's look.

419
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,480
He's not a serial rapist.
He's a serial killer.

420
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,000
Did you notice this, sir?

421
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Did you notice this, sir?

422
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,880
All the women who were murdered
were the best in their professions.

423
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,000
You're wrong, Thangam.

424
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You're wrong, Thangam.

425
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,320
Then why must he abduct
those 3 sex workers?

426
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,000
They don't sync.

427
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,200
They don't sync.

428
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,000
Hold on. I'll tell you.

429
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,600
Hold on. I'll tell you.

430
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,800
Stop it.
What do you want me to say?

431
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,000
Go!

432
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Go!

433
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,000
Take me there, brother.
-What for?

434
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,960
Take me there, brother.
-What for?

435
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,400
Take me closer, brother.

436
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,000
Dagini's father has confirmed
that it isn't her, right?

437
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,720
Dagini's father has confirmed
that it isn't her, right?

438
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,480
Please be a little patient.

439
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,000
Bhai, the DSP is here.

440
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,160
Bhai, the DSP is here.

441
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,720
Sir, the DSP is here.

442
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,880
Sir!

443
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,920
Did Dagini's father come?
-It isn't Dagini, sir.

444
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Mettupalayam.

445
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,000
What is he doing here?

446
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,720
What is he doing here?

447
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,120
Why are you look? Go on!
-Okay, sir.

448
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,000
Won't you pay attention,
Muthuraman?

449
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,200
Won't you pay attention,
Muthuraman?

450
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,640
He may tamper with evidence.
Get him.

451
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,000
Let go, sir.
I'll handle him.

452
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,720
Let go, sir.
I'll handle him.

453
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Who found the body?
-Quarry workers, sir.

454
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,000
What are you doing, sir?

455
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,280
What are you doing, sir?

456
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,000
Hurry up, brother.
-Where to?

457
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,000
I'll tell you.

458
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,080
I'll tell you.

459
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,120
Hello, who are you?

460
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,000
How is your father?
-Who are you?

461
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,160
How is your father?
-Who are you?

462
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,160
Don't you recognise me?
Where is Ms. Susheela?

463
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,000
Last left.
-Wait, on your left.

464
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Last left.
-Wait, on your left.

465
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,320
Hello, who are you?

466
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,000
Dagini is still alive, madam.
-What?

467
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,120
Dagini is still alive, madam.
-What?

468
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm having suicidal thoughts.

469
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,000
I won't go anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

470
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,360
I won't go anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

471
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,400
Can you take me
home with you, doctor?

472
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,000
We'll stop
this session now, Vaishnavi.

473
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,600
We'll stop
this session now, Vaishnavi.

474
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,000
How can we be sure that this
serial killer abducted Dagini?

475
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,080
How can we be sure that this
serial killer abducted Dagini?

476
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
It was definitely him, ma'am.

477
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,000
Because I was with him
when he did it.

478
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,520
Because I was with him
when he did it.

479
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,440
What?
-Madam, I'm in love with Dagini.

480
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
She came to the railway station
that night to see me.

481
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,640
She came to the railway station
that night to see me.

482
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,240
Somehow, that serial killer
figured it out,...

483
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,120
...he followed Dagini there
and abducted her.

484
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,000
Then whose body was found
displayed this morning?

485
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,880
Then whose body was found
displayed this morning?

486
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,000
It belongs
to a sex worker, madam.

487
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,960
It belongs
to a sex worker, madam.

488
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,320
He has never changed
his pattern so far.

489
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,000
Then, why now?

490
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,040
Then, why now?

491
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,520
So far, he has abducted
and killed 13 women.

492
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,000
Then why didn't he kill Dagini.....

493
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,960
That means she is still alive.

494
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,000
I wish. Dagini must be alive.

495
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,960
I wish. Dagini must be alive.

496
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,000
Gautham!
-Madam?

497
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,360
Gautham!
-Madam?

498
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,240
Where are you going?
-To the CBCID's office.

499
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,960
Why?

500
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,680
To inform them
so they can save Dagini.....

501
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,000
They couldn't find anything
for 1.5 years.

502
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
They couldn't find anything
for 1.5 years.

503
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,000
Then who will find her?
-You do it.

504
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,440
Then who will find her?
-You do it.

505
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,680
I can't see, madam.

506
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,000
The cops have been looking with
their eyes. They found nothing.

507
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,440
The cops have been looking with
their eyes. They found nothing.

508
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,920
You look with
your mind and heart.

509
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,240
Dagini will definitely
be found.

510
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,000
Sir! Dagini is still alive.
Please save her.

511
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,440
Sir! Dagini is still alive.
Please save her.

512
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
How did you get in here?

513
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,880
She's in danger
every passing moment.

514
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,680
Comb the entire
District of Coimbatore.

515
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,000
You dare give us ideas?
Get out!

516
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,240
You dare give us ideas?
Get out!

517
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,120
Hey, get him out of here.
-Do you think this is your house?

518
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,000
Isn't this a house too?
Where can we speak of our troubles?

519
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,520
Isn't this a house too?
Where can we speak of our troubles?

520
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,800
Please, sir!
-Get out!

521
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,720
Akbar Bhai, why did you let
him inside? Don't you have sense?

522
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,720
He looked pitiful.
So, I....

523
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
The DSP is really tensed.
Don't you have sense?

524
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,000
Take him away.
-Someone, please listen to me.

525
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Take him away.
-Someone, please listen to me.

526
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,240
They are already
in lots of trouble.

527
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,000
They can't find that killer.
-They can't find him.

528
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
They can't find that killer.
-They can't find him.

529
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,360
But they can help me, right?
I'll find him.

530
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,560
What? You'll find him?
-Yes, sir.

531
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,000
I'll find my Dagini.
I'll find her.....

532
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
I'll find my Dagini.
I'll find her.....

533
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,920
Gautham!

534
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,000
In no way can I help you
with this case.

535
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,720
In no way can I help you
with this case.

536
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,720
But there is a SI who handled
this case from the start.

537
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,000
Go and meet her.
She'll definitely help you.

538
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,720
Go and meet her.
She'll definitely help you.

539
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,080
Who is she?
-Kamala Das.

540
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,320
She's upstairs.
Go and see her.

541
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,000
Who is it?
-My name is Gautham.

542
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,160
Who is it?
-My name is Gautham.

543
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,280
Hey, Vasantha.
Who is this?

544
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,000
Madam Kamala, a man has come
to meet you about a case.

545
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,760
Madam Kamala, a man has come
to meet you about a case.

546
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,600
You moron, what case?

547
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,320
Why let strangers in here?

548
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,000
No, I felt bad seeing him.
-Throw him out of here.

549
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,160
No, I felt bad seeing him.
-Throw him out of here.

550
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,800
You fool!
How dare you come into my room!

551
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,000
I need your help.
-Shut the door and leave.

552
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,960
I need your help.
-Shut the door and leave.

553
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,520
The light is hitting me.

554
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,080
Shut the door, Vasantha!

555
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,000
I've never seen light
my entire life.

556
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,840
I've never seen light
my entire life.

557
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,640
Dagini was the only light I had.
I need to save her.

558
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,000
So, I came to seek your help.
-Vasantha! Get over here!

559
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,240
So, I came to seek your help.
-Vasantha! Get over here!

560
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,040
Drag this guy out of here.

561
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,000
I am indeed blind,
one with no light.

562
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,280
I am indeed blind,
one with no light.

563
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,320
Despite having light,
you remain blind.

564
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,000
What's with the dialogue?

565
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,960
What's with the dialogue?

566
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,000
You can walk, run and eat.

567
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,000
I can't even stand.

568
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,720
I can't even stand.

569
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,840
I don't know when
I must poop or piss.

570
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,000
Some speech you came to give!
Get out!

571
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,880
Some speech you came to give!
Get out!

572
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,000
I know you're quadriplegic, madam.

573
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,680
I know you're quadriplegic, madam.

574
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,520
No one around here
wants to help me.

575
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,520
But if you put your heart to it,
you can save a woman's life.

576
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,000
Please.
-I'm dying here.

577
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,240
Please.
-I'm dying here.

578
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,160
What do I care
if another woman lives or dies?

579
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,000
Come along, she's crazy.
Come!

580
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,560
Come along, she's crazy.
Come!

581
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,080
She stays in there
and she has gone mad.....

582
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,760
Who's mad? You're mad.

583
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,000
This crazy guy is mad.

584
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,480
This crazy guy is mad.

585
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,520
For some crazy woman,
this mad man seeks my help.

586
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,000
You refuse to help another woman.
Are you even a woman?

587
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,840
You refuse to help another woman.
Are you even a woman?

588
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,000
Hey, you rogue!

589
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,160
Hey, you rogue!

590
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,880
You swine!

591
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
He slapped me, Vasantha.
-Yes, I saw.

592
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,160
He slapped me, Vasantha.
-Yes, I saw.

593
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,200
He slapped me, Vasantha.
-After what you said,...

594
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,000
...how could he not?
-Kayal!

595
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
...how could he not?
-Kayal!

596
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,000
Kayal!

597
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,120
Kayal!

598
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,000
Both Kayal and I left
together for work.

599
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,560
Both Kayal and I left
together for work.

600
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,440
I landed a customer, I left.
-What time did you leave for work?

601
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,000
Around 10.45, sir.
-Were you both on the same street?

602
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,960
Around 10.45, sir.
-Were you both on the same street?

603
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,000
No, sir. We normally
have a gap between us.

604
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,040
No, sir. We normally
have a gap between us.

605
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,640
Because a customer
would take only one of us.

606
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The other one would feel hurt.
That is the reason.

607
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,120
The other one would feel hurt.
That is the reason.

608
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Okay, before you left,
did you let her know?

609
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,600
No, but when I was riding
in the truck,...

610
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,000
...I called Kayal and spoke to her.

611
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,000
Give me your phone.

612
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,280
Give me your phone.

613
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,280
11.05.

614
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,360
What did you talk about?
-I told her that I had left.

615
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,000
She told me that she left too.
-Did she say anything else?

616
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
She told me that she left too.
-Did she say anything else?

617
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,440
I told her about my customer.

618
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,000
She told me about hers.

619
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,240
She told me about hers.

620
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,280
What did she say?

621
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,800
I told her my guy
looked like a hairy baboon.

622
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,000
Officers!
-Sir!

623
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,960
Officers!
-Sir!

624
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,240
Listen to me!

625
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,000
We have finally got a clue
on the serial killer's case.

626
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,280
We have finally got a clue
on the serial killer's case.

627
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,440
Clue number one,
the killer is a clean shaven man.

628
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,000
Clue number two, he's well-dressed
and a handsome man.

629
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,240
Clue number two, he's well-dressed
and a handsome man.

630
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,000
Clue number three,
he owns an expensive car.

631
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,680
Clue number three,
he owns an expensive car.

632
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,160
It must either be black,
blue or brown.

633
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,000
I feel the car
is one of those 3 colours.

634
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,240
I feel the car
is one of those 3 colours.

635
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,760
If you see a car like that,
double check it thoroughly.

636
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,000
If we miss this opportunity,
we'll never solve this case.

637
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
If we miss this opportunity,
we'll never solve this case.

638
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Thank you.

639
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,680
You haven't eaten anything all day.
At least have some juice.

640
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,000
No, brother. Dagini wouldn't
have eaten all day, right?

641
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,400
No, brother. Dagini wouldn't
have eaten all day, right?

642
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,000
How can we change our fate?

643
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,080
How can we change our fate?

644
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,000
There is no such thing
as fate, brother.

645
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,160
Everything is an accident.
I'll definitely save her, brother.

646
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,000
How can you do it
all by yourself?

647
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,240
How can you do it
all by yourself?

648
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,000
Welcome. Come in.

649
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,600
Welcome. Come in.

650
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,840
Gautham, do you know
who has come to see you?

651
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,000
Thanks, madam.
Thank you very much.

652
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,760
Thanks, madam.
Thank you very much.

653
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,560
There's one thing.

654
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,000
Hey!

655
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,520
Hey!

656
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,360
Kamala, you're still
a child at heart.

657
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,000
I like you a lot.

658
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,640
I like you a lot.

659
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,000
Where are your parents?
-Canada.

660
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,760
Where are your parents?
-Canada.

661
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,880
Gautham, do you like Buddha?
-I like him a lot.

662
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So, you have no desire?
-I do.

663
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,080
So, you have no desire?
-I do.

664
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,560
I wish to save Dagini even
if it means I have to die for it.

665
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,200
I like you too.

666
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,000
Anyway, we don't have time.

667
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,280
Anyway, we don't have time.

668
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,880
It has been 1.5 years
since my accident.

669
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I've forgotten the details
about this case.

670
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,840
I've forgotten the details
about this case.

671
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,600
I want 3 things.

672
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,000
Chewing gum,
a map of Coimbatore District...

673
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,880
Chewing gum,
a map of Coimbatore District...

674
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,320
...and the latest CBCID files
on this case.

675
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,000
CBCID files?
Who would give us those files?

676
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,440
CBCID files?
Who would give us those files?

677
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,360
No one would give us,
we need to take them ourselves.

678
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,000
How?
-We have to steal them.

679
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,320
How?
-We have to steal them.

680
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,000
We won't be able to understand
psychopaths, neither can he.

681
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,480
We won't be able to understand
psychopaths, neither can he.

682
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,520
He maybe keeping her alive
or he could have killed her.

683
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,000
If the blind guy believes she's
alive, let's believe that too.

684
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,920
If the blind guy believes she's
alive, let's believe that too.

685
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,760
Sir, the poor guy's lover
is missing, sir.

686
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,320
Why drink and cause trouble?

687
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,000
Go!
-Save her.

688
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,880
Go!
-Save her.

689
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,560
I beg of you, sir. Save her.
-Shut up and leave.

690
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,000
I'll throw you in jail.
-I'm sorry.

691
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,120
I'll throw you in jail.
-I'm sorry.

692
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,720
Come early tomorrow.
-Will do.

693
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,400
Drive.
-Start driving, sir.

694
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,840
Buzz off.
-Sir!

695
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,000
Are you leaving too?
Save her, sir.

696
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,400
Are you leaving too?
Save her, sir.

697
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,000
Sir!

698
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,480
Sir!

699
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,000
Get lost!
-Poor Dagini. Save her, sir.

700
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,000
Get started, Gautham.

701
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,960
Get started, Gautham.

702
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,040
Head straight, Gautham.

703
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,320
Go straight.

704
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,000
Straight. Stop!

705
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,440
Straight. Stop!

706
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,000
Now turn left.

707
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,040
Now turn left.

708
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,000
Yes, now go straight.

709
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,800
Yes, now go straight.

710
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,480
Keep going straight.

711
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,280
The gate is locked.

712
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,000
What will you do?

713
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,480
What will you do?

714
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,560
Go inside.

715
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,400
There's a chair on your left.
Careful.

716
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,680
Turn right. Show me.

717
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,040
Okay, go left.

718
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,080
Take a right.

719
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,000
Stop, take a right.

720
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,080
Keep going straight.

721
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,000
Stop. Now take a left.

722
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,440
Stop. Now take a left.

723
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,000
Stop. Raise the camera.

724
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,560
Stop. Raise the camera.

725
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,240
Achievers

726
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,000
Stop.

727
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,080
Stop.

728
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,520
What is it, dear?
-Nothing.

729
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,720
Okay, turn left.

730
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,240
Sir!
-It's okay, sleep.

731
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,920
Sir?
-I forgot my house key. Sleep.

732
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,480
Come out from there.

733
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,000
We're cops.

734
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,160
We're cops.

735
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,880
When a girl goes missing,
it's just a case for us.

736
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But it's not the same for you.
These are just papers.

737
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,600
But it's not the same for you.
These are just papers.

738
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,800
What did we do
with it for 1.5 years?

739
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,000
Take these with you.
At least you try to save the girl.

740
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,040
Take these with you.
At least you try to save the girl.

741
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,000
First victim, Manjula Ramesh.
Advocate.

742
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,080
First victim, Manjula Ramesh.
Advocate.

743
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,680
She was abducted
on November 2, 2015.

744
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,840
Second victim, Leela.
She was a sex worker.

745
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,000
She was abducted
on December 8, 2015.

746
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
She was abducted
on December 8, 2015.

747
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,000
Third victim, Jane Parisutham.
College girl.

748
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,160
Third victim, Jane Parisutham.
College girl.

749
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,280
While investigating this case,...

750
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,480
...my girl fell down
the stairs......

751
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,000
You witch!
Why go into flashback mode?

752
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,040
You witch!
Why go into flashback mode?

753
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,000
No, if you hadn't gone there.....

754
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,840
Shut up!

755
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,000
Gautham, so far,
14 people have been abducted.

756
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,000
Of which, 10 people had been
successful in their professions.

757
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,400
Of which, 10 people had been
successful in their professions.

758
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,000
4 of them were sex workers.
I investigated the first 6 cases.

759
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,240
4 of them were sex workers.
I investigated the first 6 cases.

760
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,320
No clues.
They are all black holes.

761
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,000
But in the last 6 cases,...

762
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,920
But in the last 6 cases,...

763
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,000
...Sylvia Plath,
Ezhilarasi and Rupavahini,...

764
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,320
...Sylvia Plath,
Ezhilarasi and Rupavahini,...

765
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,680
...there are similarities
in these 3 cases.

766
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,000
All 3 of their rides were the only
vehicle found on the street.

767
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,840
All 3 of their rides were the only
vehicle found on the street.

768
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,000
The 3 of them
were abducted during the day.

769
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,520
The 3 of them
were abducted during the day.

770
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,400
And no one saw them
get abducted during the day?

771
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,000
That's surprising.

772
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,000
The police file says
no one saw it.

773
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,480
The police file says
no one saw it.

774
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,320
I won't believe that.

775
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,000
Can I help you?
-Sir, I need to ask you...

776
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Can I help you?
-Sir, I need to ask you...

777
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,400
...a few questions about
your daughter, Ezhilarasi's case.

778
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,000
Who are you people?
-The cops sent us.

779
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,800
Who are you people?
-The cops sent us.

780
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,560
If you show us
where your daughter...

781
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,320
...was abducted, we can.....

782
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,000
Who was it?
-Some idiots.

783
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,480
Who was it?
-Some idiots.

784
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Excuse me,
why are you disturbing me?

785
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,200
Excuse me,
why are you disturbing me?

786
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,280
It has been some time
since my daughter died.

787
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,560
We have resigned
to our fate here.

788
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,000
Even the cops could do nothing
about it. What can you do?

789
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,400
Even the cops could do nothing
about it. What can you do?

790
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,440
Mr. Bhaskar,
do you know who he is?

791
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,000
His name is Thiruvangur Asanakundi,
a psychic.

792
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,520
His name is Thiruvangur Asanakundi,
a psychic.

793
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,880
He can talk to spirits.

794
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Your daughter showed up
on his ouija board.

795
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Your daughter showed up
on his ouija board.

796
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,520
She is upset over her
killer not getting caught.

797
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,000
That's why we came here.

798
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,400
That's why we came here.

799
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,080
Can you show us where
your daughter went missing?

800
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,960
My daughter's vehicle
was found here.

801
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,720
Brother!

802
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,000
Was the vehicle found here?
-Yes, sir.

803
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,280
Here?
-Right.

804
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,000
It's on the wrong side of the road.
-That is what is surprising.

805
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,720
It's on the wrong side of the road.
-That is what is surprising.

806
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,840
After leaving home,
why did she park it here?

807
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,000
That's what I don't get.

808
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,800
That's what I don't get.

809
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,000
Brother!

810
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,280
Any guess, Kamala?
-She saw someone.

811
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,000
Or she saw something.

812
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,440
Or she saw something.

813
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,520
That is why she parked
on the wrong side of the road.

814
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,000
Where could she have seen it?
-In front of the vehicle.

815
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,360
Where could she have seen it?
-In front of the vehicle.

816
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,440
Careful!
-I'm sorry, sir.

817
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,400
My sister's car was found here.

818
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,800
This car is parked on
the correct side of the road.

819
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,000
Gautham, any guess?
-Next.

820
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,040
Gautham, any guess?
-Next.

821
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,000
This was where my daughter's
vehicle was found.

822
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,680
This was where my daughter's
vehicle was found.

823
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,000
Gautham, 25 feet towards
your right, the same dumpster.

824
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,720
Gautham, 25 feet towards
your right, the same dumpster.

825
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,000
At what time
did your daughter go missing?

826
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,280
At what time
did your daughter go missing?

827
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,320
Between 3 to 3.30 pm, sir.

828
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,560
Brother!
-Yes?

829
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,000
I need some chocolates.
-Chocolates?

830
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,240
I need some chocolates.
-Chocolates?

831
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,320
It's a yorker.

832
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,000
Do you know about yorkers, uncle?
-Indeed, I do.

833
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,440
Do you know about yorkers, uncle?
-Indeed, I do.

834
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,520
My favourite bowler is Wasim Akram.
-My favourite bowler is Bumrah.

835
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,000
Okay, come on!
Come and take chocolates!

836
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,640
Okay, come on!
Come and take chocolates!

837
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,480
Chocolates!
-Here you go.

838
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,000
What was Chennai
Super King's score...

839
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,320
What was Chennai
Super King's score...

840
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,720
...in last year's IPL final?
-148 for 7.

841
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,960
Man of the Match?
-Bumrah.

842
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,960
I mean, who wins many prizes
in quiz contests?

843
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,760
Sister Rupavahini.
-He's a substitute, uncle.

844
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,960
Do you know her?
-Yes, uncle.

845
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,000
But someone killed her.
-Were you playing here on that day?

846
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,040
But someone killed her.
-Were you playing here on that day?

847
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,000
Yes, Sister Rupa's parents
even came running.

848
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,320
Yes, Sister Rupa's parents
even came running.

849
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,480
Who was on
the boundary line that day?

850
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,960
Murali, the substitute.

851
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,000
Murali, did you see Sister Rupa
go in a vehicle that day?

852
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,480
Murali, did you see Sister Rupa
go in a vehicle that day?

853
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,160
Yes, uncle. I waved goodbye to her.
-What next?

854
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,000
She sped forward,
then she hit the brakes.

855
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,640
She sped forward,
then she hit the brakes.

856
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,520
Then what happened?
-I went to pick up the ball.

857
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,000
Did you come back and see?
-Yes, uncle.

858
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,760
Did you come back and see?
-Yes, uncle.

859
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,640
What did you see?
-Sister Rupa was walking away...

860
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,000
...carrying a puppy.
-Where was she going?

861
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,160
...carrying a puppy.
-Where was she going?

862
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,680
I didn't see.

863
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,720
Did you tell anyone
about Sister Rupa and the puppy?

864
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,000
No one asked me.

865
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,960
No one asked me.

866
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,680
The killer puts a puppy
near the dumpster.

867
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,320
The women ride their bike.

868
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,000
The puppy runs to them.

869
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,960
The puppy runs to them.

870
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,200
Curious about a puppy
on the road, they pick it up.

871
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,000
The killer is standing afar.

872
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,400
The killer is standing afar.

873
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,600
He claims it's his puppy.

874
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,360
The women return the puppy to him.
That's when he abducts them.

875
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,000
This is how it happened, right?

876
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,960
This is how it happened, right?

877
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,120
So, the dog must have been
cute and beautiful.

878
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,720
Why?

879
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,000
What if it was hurt and limping?

880
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,360
What if it was hurt and limping?

881
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,720
Let me talk, Kamala.
-You see, Gautham,...

882
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,600
...we don't know the killer
lures his victims...

883
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,000
...with what type of dog.

884
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,520
...with what type of dog.

885
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,960
Even if we know, there are
more than 50 kennels in Coimbatore.

886
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,000
There are 100 pet shops
and 40 veterinarian doctors.

887
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,560
There are 100 pet shops
and 40 veterinarian doctors.

888
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,000
It's a long shot.
All our efforts have been wasted.

889
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,600
It's a long shot.
All our efforts have been wasted.

890
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,400
No, Kamala.
It hasn't been wasted.

891
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,000
The killer uses dogs
to abduct women.

892
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,200
The killer uses dogs
to abduct women.

893
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,760
If we tell the cops about it,
they'll create awareness...

894
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,480
...among the public.

895
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,000
When the killer tries this again,
women will be on their guard.

896
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,240
When the killer tries this again,
women will be on their guard.

897
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,960
He won't abduct anyone else.
-Good thing.

898
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,000
Shut your trap.
If the killer learns that...

899
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,680
Shut your trap.
If the killer learns that...

900
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,920
...the cops know he's using
dogs to abduct women,...

901
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,000
...he'll get really angry.

902
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,840
...he'll get really angry.

903
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,720
What if he gets so angry
and ends up killing Dagini?

904
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,000
Call Vinod.
-Calling Vinod's mobile.

905
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,080
Call Vinod.
-Calling Vinod's mobile.

906
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,360
Can you do me a favour, Vinod?

907
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,000
Note down what
I'm about to tell you.

908
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,120
Note down what
I'm about to tell you.

909
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,400
Hey, what are you doing?

910
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,840
What are you doing alone
on the road?

911
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,320
Come here.

912
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,000
Madam! That's my dog.

913
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,600
Madam! That's my dog.

914
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,640
Can you please bring it over?

915
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,560
Sorry, sister. Shadow got out
of his leash and ran off.

916
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,000
Can you hook him back?
-No problem.

917
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,440
Can you hook him back?
-No problem.

918
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,000
Sorry, sir, I read in the
'Catch the Killer' hashtag...

919
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,840
Sorry, sir, I read in the
'Catch the Killer' hashtag...

920
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,160
...on Twitter to be careful
around those with dogs.

921
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,000
Of course I'm not saying
you're a killer.

922
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,600
Of course I'm not saying
you're a killer.

923
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,760
But I have to be careful.

924
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm sorry, sir.

925
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,480
I'm sorry, sir.

926
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,840
Who is it?

927
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,360
I need to hack
into a Twitter account.

928
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,000
Who gave you this address?
-I won't tell you.

929
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,160
Who gave you this address?
-I won't tell you.

930
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,000
Brother, I found the IP address.

931
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,840
Brother, I found the IP address.

932
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,000
191.202.4.1.
-The E-mail ID?

933
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,640
191.202.4.1.
-The E-mail ID?

934
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,000
The E-mail ID.....
Come on, baby!

935
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,440
The E-mail ID.....
Come on, baby!

936
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,680
madrasquartetgmail.com.

937
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,000
What you said is true.
Gautham is looking for you.

938
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,320
What you said is true.
Gautham is looking for you.

939
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,000
Brother!
-What is it?

940
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,280
Brother!
-What is it?

941
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,400
What is it, Gautham?

942
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,000
I heard a noise
coming from outside.

943
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,920
I heard a noise
coming from outside.

944
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,400
I didn't hear anything.
Gautham!

945
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,000
Who is it?

946
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,200
Who is it?

947
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,960
There is no one there.

948
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,000
Gautham!
-Brother!

949
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,200
Gautham!
-Brother!

950
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,320
Don't go further!
Get back into the house!

951
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,520
Who is it, brother?
-Listen to me. Get back in here.

952
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,960
Come back inside, Gautham.

953
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,000
Come in!

954
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,280
Come in!

955
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,640
Are you and Dagini in love?

956
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,280
What happened to Dagini, sir?

957
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,000
Do you believe Dagini
is still alive, sir?

958
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,520
Dagini is still alive.

959
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,600
What did you ask
the victims' neighbours?

960
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,000
He questioned kids in that area
and figured out the killer...

961
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,640
He questioned kids in that area
and figured out the killer...

962
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,920
...uses dogs to abduct women.
What are we doing?

963
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,000
Don't we have sense?

964
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,320
Yes, sir. Normal people have
lesser sense than psychopaths.

965
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,000
How did Gautham figure this out?

966
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,360
How did Gautham figure this out?

967
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,000
He is not searching
with his eyes, sir.

968
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,960
Tell that to the Commissioner.

969
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,000
No matter whom we tell,
this is the truth.

970
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,640
No matter whom we tell,
this is the truth.

971
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,000
Okay, Muthu, let's not argue.
What is the development?

972
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,520
Okay, Muthu, let's not argue.
What is the development?

973
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,040
A hacker was killed
at Peelamedu, sir.

974
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,000
The forensic department matched
shoe prints found there...

975
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,080
The forensic department matched
shoe prints found there...

976
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,280
...with those of the killer.
-Good. What's the next step?

977
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,000
The killer somehow learnt
that Gautham tweeted...

978
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,480
The killer somehow learnt
that Gautham tweeted...

979
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,840
...with his friend's help in
our 'Catch the Killer' hashtag.

980
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,680
That is why
he left Angayarkanni's body...

981
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,000
...at Gautham's house
as a warning.

982
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,600
...at Gautham's house
as a warning.

983
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,000
If we find out how or through whom
the killer found the hacker,...

984
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,200
If we find out how or through whom
the killer found the hacker,...

985
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,720
...we will find the killer.
-Sorry, Kamala.

986
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,960
I tweeted about it
without listening to you.

987
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,080
You did the right thing.
-Two people are dead.

988
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,280
A poor hacker
died because of me.

989
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,000
Sometimes bad things happen
when you do the right thing.

990
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,080
Sometimes bad things happen
when you do the right thing.

991
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,040
It is all God's play.

992
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,000
Did God shove me down
those stairs?

993
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,640
Did God shove me down
those stairs?

994
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,400
You hate it
when I talk about God.

995
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,160
Can't you find a better time
to talk about it?

996
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,000
What's with that big vermilion
on your head at night?

997
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,440
What's with that big vermilion
on your head at night?

998
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,120
What's it to you?
-My father's dead, right?

999
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,880
Can't I use a pottu
if my husband's dead?

1000
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Madam, please do this later.
-Brother,...

1001
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,400
Madam, please do this later.
-Brother,...

1002
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,400
...I want a map of the city
of Coimbatore tomorrow.

1003
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,000
And I want 2 pigs.
-What?

1004
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,360
A black pig and a white one.

1005
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,960
Where is the white pig, brother?
-Over there. Come along.

1006
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,000
Watch your step.

1007
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,120
...and when I smelt Angayarkanni's
body at my house yesterday,...

1008
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,760
...they both had the same smell.
I'm very sure about it.

1009
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,000
So, the killer has a pig farm.
And Dagini is being held there.

1010
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,840
Coimbatore is filled with cops.

1011
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,640
How can he get away so easily
with a woman in the car?

1012
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,000
A customized vehicle.
-What does that mean?

1013
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,920
Vasantha, I need to know
how many pig farms are there...

1014
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,120
...in the Coimbatore District.

1015
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,680
We'll check every one of them.
-No time for that.

1016
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,640
Aunty, why does this
spot alone have 4 pins?

1017
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,480
That was where the
prostitutes were abducted.

1018
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,000
Which area is this?
-Mettupalayam.

1019
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,960
Which area is this?
-Mettupalayam.

1020
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,120
Can't one find sex workers
anywhere else in Coimbatore?

1021
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,000
Why does he only abduct
those in Mettupalayam?

1022
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,880
Why does he only abduct
those in Mettupalayam?

1023
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,000
The night he abducted Dagini,...

1024
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,680
The night he abducted Dagini,...

1025
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,800
...why did he also abduct
a sex worker called Kayalvizhi?

1026
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,000
He couldn't kill Dagini.

1027
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,120
He couldn't kill Dagini.

1028
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,240
So, he abducted
and killed Kayalvizhi.

1029
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:30,000
So, Kayalvizhi was a surrogate
for Dagini. Am I right?

1030
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,040
So, Kayalvizhi was a surrogate
for Dagini. Am I right?

1031
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,240
I don't get it.
-Shut up!

1032
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,000
So, all the sex workers
were surrogates.

1033
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,040
So, all the sex workers
were surrogates.

1034
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,320
I don't get it either, dear.

1035
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,480
The killer tracks a woman.

1036
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,000
For some reason,
he isn't able to abduct her.

1037
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,720
For some reason,
he isn't able to abduct her.

1038
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,760
The killer gets angry.

1039
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,000
He can't stop his urge to kill.

1040
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,720
He can't stop his urge to kill.

1041
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,920
On his way back,
he sees a sex worker.

1042
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,960
She easily comes to him.
He abducts her.

1043
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,000
Why does he abduct everyone
in Mettupalayam?

1044
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,600
Why does he abduct everyone
in Mettupalayam?

1045
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,640
Because it's easy for him
to abduct them in Mettupalayam.

1046
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,000
Or his house
must be in Mettupalayam.

1047
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,200
Or his house
must be in Mettupalayam.

1048
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,000
That means he's holding Dagini
in a pig farm in Mettupalayam.

1049
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,520
That means he's holding Dagini
in a pig farm in Mettupalayam.

1050
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,000
I had a large pig farm
in Periyakulam.

1051
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,720
I had a large pig farm
in Periyakulam.

1052
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,720
Okay.
-I had over 200 pigs.

1053
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,600
All right.
-All succumbed to cholera.

1054
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,000
So, I came to buy
4 males and 4 females.

1055
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,640
So, I came to buy
4 males and 4 females.

1056
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,440
All right.
Would you like some buttermilk?

1057
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,000
Here? Do you have
any dogs here?

1058
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,040
Here? Do you have
any dogs here?

1059
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:39,000
We do not have any dogs here,
only pigs.

1060
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,000
Who is she?
-My wife, the owner of the place.

1061
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,680
Who is she?
-My wife, the owner of the place.

1062
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,320
Sir! I'll give you a good price!

1063
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,000
Come back!

1064
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,000
Who is it?
-Is the owner around, sir?

1065
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,240
Who is it?
-Is the owner around, sir?

1066
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,680
What is it?
-Are you the owner?

1067
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,360
I'm hard of hearing.

1068
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,000
I came to buy pigs.
-Come along. I'll show you.

1069
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I came to buy pigs.
-Come along. I'll show you.

1070
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,600
Is the owner not here?

1071
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,000
Tell me how many animals you need.
I'll show you.

1072
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,080
Tell me how many animals you need.
I'll show you.

1073
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,800
Owner.....

1074
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,920
Three? Come along.
I'll show you.

1075
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Sir! Who is that?
-He's the owner of this place.

1076
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,200
Sir! Who is that?
-He's the owner of this place.

1077
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,440
The owner?
-Yes.

1078
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,000
Sir, I'll give you
a good price. Come back.

1079
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,400
Sir, I'll give you
a good price. Come back.

1080
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,600
Yes, sir?

1081
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,000
I'm near Vellerikuppam, sir.

1082
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,400
I'm near Vellerikuppam, sir.

1083
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,640
I've been following
Gautham's car.

1084
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,000
He came to Shanthi's Pig Farm.
-What is he doing there?

1085
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,120
He came to Shanthi's Pig Farm.
-What is he doing there?

1086
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,280
Okay, follow him
until this evening.

1087
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,000
Once Akbar comes for duty,
I'll relieve you.

1088
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,240
Once Akbar comes for duty,
I'll relieve you.

1089
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,840
Ms. Kodhai!
-Sir?

1090
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,120
Where is the driver?
-He went to B1 Station.

1091
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,160
Akbar.
-Sir?

1092
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,000
Give me your bike key.
-It has a starting problem.

1093
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,440
Give me your bike key.
-It has a starting problem.

1094
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,120
Tell me what you need,
I'll go and get it for you.

1095
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,240
Just give me the key, Akbar.

1096
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Be careful, sir.

1097
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,000
Sir!

1098
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,520
Sir!
-Oh God! It is so hot.

1099
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,000
Where is the owner?
-Who? I can't hear you.

1100
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,240
Where is the owner?
-Who? I can't hear you.

1101
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,240
I asked where the owner is.

1102
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,000
What's the matter?
He's at the back.

1103
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,920
What's the matter?
He's at the back.

1104
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,600
All right,
I'll go and talk to him.

1105
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,000
I'll take you to him.
-It's all right, you lie down.

1106
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,400
I'll take you to him.
-It's all right, you lie down.

1107
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,840
You lie down.
-My goodness!

1108
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,000
Sir?
-Who is it?

1109
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Sir?
-Who is it?

1110
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,520
Are you the owner?
-Yes.

1111
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,080
Did anyone come
to your farm this morning?

1112
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,000
Who are you?
-No, I run a business.

1113
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,960
Who are you?
-No, I run a business.

1114
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,000
A friend told me he's planning
to come here to buy pigs.

1115
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,000
I came to check.
-Let's talk in my office.

1116
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,840
I came to check.
-Let's talk in my office.

1117
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,760
Sir!

1118
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,000
Sir!

1119
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,120
Sir!

1120
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,000
Who are you, sir?
-I'm a police officer.

1121
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,600
Who are you, sir?
-I'm a police officer.

1122
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,880
Escape from here, sir.

1123
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's impossible,
I'm tightly restrained.

1124
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,120
It's impossible,
I'm tightly restrained.

1125
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,000
How are you?

1126
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,560
How are you?

1127
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,400
I.....

1128
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,200
Don't worry.

1129
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,000
Gautham will come and save you.

1130
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,040
Gautham will come and save you.

1131
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,000
It appears as if I got
caught here to give you hope.

1132
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,640
It appears as if I got
caught here to give you hope.

1133
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,000
How peculiar is life.

1134
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,680
How peculiar is life.

1135
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,320
Death is always near.

1136
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,000
And we get so worked up over it.

1137
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,280
All these years,
I've been looking for this guy.

1138
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,000
Even my wife ran away.

1139
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,800
Even my wife ran away.

1140
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,000
Escape before
he comes back, sir.

1141
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,600
Escape before
he comes back, sir.

1142
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,920
Please, sir.
-No, I'm really tired.

1143
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,000
Sir, I have a request.
-What?

1144
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,840
Sir, I have a request.
-What?

1145
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,000
One last time, can I sing
an AM Rajah's song?

1146
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,720
One last time, can I sing
an AM Rajah's song?

1147
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,000
In solitude...

1148
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:24,000
In solitude...

1149
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,120
In solitude...

1150
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,000
In solitude,can one find comfort...

1151
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,360
In solitude,can one find comfort...

1152
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,000
Can one see the sunin the dead of the night...

1153
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,360
Can one see the sunin the dead of the night...

1154
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:47,440
In solitude,can one find comfort...

1155
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,320
If one has no company...

1156
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,160
Vasantha!
-Yes?

1157
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,280
Did you thoroughly check
every farm you visited?

1158
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,000
Yes, I did.
-How about you, brother?

1159
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,280
Yes, I did.
-How about you, brother?

1160
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,160
No one suspicious
in the farms I visited.

1161
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,960
Something is wrong.
We missed something.

1162
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,000
The killer is in one
of the farms we visited.

1163
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,840
The killer is in one
of the farms we visited.

1164
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,640
I have this nagging feeling.

1165
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,960
Here, drink this.
We'll talk in the morning.

1166
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,240
I don't want it.

1167
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,000
It's our Inspector, sir.
-I'm sorry, Thangam.

1168
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,000
Oh God!

1169
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,200
Oh God!

1170
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm really scared.

1171
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I'm really scared.

1172
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,800
Stay in the house
for the next 2-3 days.

1173
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,600
Don't go out anywhere.

1174
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,000
In another 2 days,
he's going to kill Dagini.

1175
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,840
In another 2 days,
he's going to kill Dagini.

1176
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,440
Why do you always
sound pessimistic?

1177
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,200
How else am I supposed to sound?

1178
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,000
To catch a killer,
one must be ready to die.

1179
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,520
To catch a killer,
one must be ready to die.

1180
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,000
Gautham!

1181
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,640
Gautham!

1182
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,000
Go back to Kamala's house.
-Gautham, wait.

1183
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,920
Go back to Kamala's house.
-Gautham, wait.

1184
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,040
Just go back.
-Why must I go there?

1185
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm staying here with you.
-I want to be alone.

1186
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,640
I'm staying here with you.
-I want to be alone.

1187
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,520
How can I leave you alone?
-Please listen to me.

1188
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,000
Have I ever not listened to you?

1189
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,800
Have I ever not listened to you?

1190
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,120
Didn't the cops say
it isn't safe to stay here?

1191
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,000
That wretched man
left a corpse at our doorstep.

1192
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,440
That wretched man
left a corpse at our doorstep.

1193
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,240
If you stay here,
your life will be in danger.

1194
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,840
Dagini is dying
over there every single day.

1195
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,000
Your life is important
to me, Gautham.

1196
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,200
Your life is important
to me, Gautham.

1197
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,440
Just leave me alone.
-Listen to me.

1198
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,480
How many times have you said
that I was your light?

1199
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,000
Where am I to go now?
-Just go somewhere and die.

1200
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,400
Where am I to go now?
-Just go somewhere and die.

1201
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:17,160
Hello?

1202
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,000
Excuse me!

1203
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,480
Excuse me!

1204
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,600
Who are you?

1205
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,000
Have you got a bidi?

1206
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,640
Have you got a bidi?

1207
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,000
No, I have.....

1208
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,520
No, I have.....

1209
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:35,360
Have you got a bidi?

1210
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,880
I won't stop
until I catch you.

1211
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,560
Sir!

1212
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,000
Sir, is anyone there?
-Who is it?

1213
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,040
Sir, is anyone there?
-Who is it?

1214
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,840
Brother!
-Who's out there?

1215
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,600
Who's there?
-Brother!

1216
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,000
What are you doing here?
-I need a measuring tape.

1217
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,760
What are you doing here?
-I need a measuring tape.

1218
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,000
Gautham, I followed the killer
and I came to...

1219
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,520
Gautham, I followed the killer
and I came to...

1220
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,080
...a banana plantation.....

1221
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:06,000
Gautham, the killer's car
registration number is.....

1222
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,160
Gautham, the killer's car
registration number is.....

1223
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:30,000
Gautham, tomorrow at midnight,
I will kill your Dagini.

1224
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,240
Gautham gave this.

1225
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,720
Gautham!

1226
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,880
Gautham!

1227
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,200
Gautham!

1228
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,560
Excuse me,
is he someone you know?

1229
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,000
Yes, sir.

1230
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,480
Yes, sir.

1231
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,280
Sudha, bring the belongings
of the deceased person.

1232
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,960
Doctor!
-Yes?

1233
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,000
Do you know how he died?
-He was stabbed on the hip.

1234
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,600
Do you know how he died?
-He was stabbed on the hip.

1235
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,280
His throat was slit.

1236
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:23,440
The little finger
on his right hand was severed.

1237
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:24,000
Why the little finger?
-I don't know.

1238
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,200
Why the little finger?
-I don't know.

1239
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,560
He cut it for some reason.

1240
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,000
Here are his belongings, sir.

1241
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,480
Here are his belongings, sir.

1242
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,000
Please sign here.

1243
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:06,000
Can you send me home, aunty?
-At home?

1244
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,280
Can you send me home, aunty?
-At home?

1245
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,120
Enough deaths in this case
because of me. I want nothing more.

1246
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,000
Can you please send me home?
-Shut up, Gautham.

1247
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,120
Can you please send me home?
-Shut up, Gautham.

1248
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,120
No, Kamala.
It's the truth.

1249
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,000
How can I find a killer?
I'm blind. I'm handicapped.

1250
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,600
How can I find a killer?
I'm blind. I'm handicapped.

1251
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Why did you drag me out here?

1252
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,800
Why did you drag me out here?

1253
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,720
Why did you come to my house?

1254
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:30,000
You slapped me.

1255
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,160
You slapped me.

1256
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,640
Did you just realise
that you're handicapped?

1257
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,520
Yes, Kamala. I just realised it.

1258
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,000
I'm handicapped. I'm blind.

1259
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:36,400
I'm handicapped. I'm blind.

1260
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,000
What are you looking, Vasantha?
Get the car. Let's go.

1261
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,800
What are you looking, Vasantha?
Get the car. Let's go.

1262
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:45,880
Let's leave him on the street.
-Shut your mouth.

1263
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,640
My mouth is the only thing
that still works.

1264
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,000
Want me to shut that too?

1265
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,040
Want me to shut that too?

1266
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,000
Hey, if you're blind,
I'm like a rock,...

1267
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,600
Hey, if you're blind,
I'm like a rock,...

1268
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,000
...a useless piece of rock.
Why did you call me?

1269
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,600
...a useless piece of rock.
Why did you call me?

1270
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,480
I would have just remained
in darkness.

1271
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,000
If I was physically able,
I would have caught that guy.

1272
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,800
If I was physically able,
I would have caught that guy.

1273
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,000
If I hadn't fallen down
those steps at the college,...

1274
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,320
If I hadn't fallen down
those steps at the college,...

1275
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,280
...I would have caught that killer.

1276
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,000
He attended the college function.

1277
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,240
He attended the college function.

1278
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,680
I would have seen him
on that CD.

1279
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,200
That useless staircase!

1280
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,000
I'm sitting here
like a corpse now.

1281
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,080
I'm sitting here
like a corpse now.

1282
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,320
Aunty, we must go to the college.
-Why?

1283
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,360
Kamala must watch that CD.

1284
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,160
Do you want anything?
-I want cigarettes.

1285
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,000
All day, you torment me.
It makes me short of breath.

1286
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,440
All day, you torment me.
It makes me short of breath.

1287
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,840
That is James Parisutham.

1288
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,000
Thanks and vanakkam.
-Forward.

1289
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,960
Thanks and vanakkam.
-Forward.

1290
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:34,200
Next, our chief guest.....
-Forward.

1291
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,000
The college is proud to welcome
respected IPS officer Kamala Das.

1292
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,200
The college is proud to welcome
respected IPS officer Kamala Das.

1293
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,880
Pause.

1294
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:45,000
Forward.
-Let's welcome her up on stage now.

1295
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:47,800
Stop!

1296
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:48,000
Can you zoom in on him?

1297
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,280
Can you zoom in on him?

1298
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,280
Who is that guy with the cap
who is concealing his face?

1299
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,400
Who is seated next to him?

1300
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,920
Thanks for coming.
Who is he?

1301
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,000
An acquaintance of mine.
-Hey, get out of here.

1302
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:12,080
An acquaintance of mine.
-Hey, get out of here.

1303
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,840
Go and sit next to him.

1304
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,920
Sir, do you remember the man...

1305
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,280
...who was sitting
on your left that day?

1306
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,000
I don't remember his face.

1307
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,400
I don't remember his face.

1308
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,520
But he was around 28-30 years old.

1309
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,000
He was clean shaven.
I don't remember anything else.

1310
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,280
He was clean shaven.
I don't remember anything else.

1311
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:39,320
Did you talk to him?

1312
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,000
I was eating popcorn,
I offered him some.

1313
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,200
I was eating popcorn,
I offered him some.

1314
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,720
He thanked me and accepted it.

1315
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,040
Oh yes, he is left-handed.
-How can you tell?

1316
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,000
He took the popcorn
with his left hand.

1317
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,760
He took the popcorn
with his left hand.

1318
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,400
I remember that.
-Are you left-handed?

1319
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,000
Yes.

1320
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,120
Yes.

1321
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,680
Sir, with which hand
did he take the popcorn?

1322
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,160
With his left hand.

1323
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:06,000
Sir, his right hand
was closer to you.

1324
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,080
Sir, his right hand
was closer to you.

1325
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,440
Why did he use his left hand?
-No, if he was left-handed,...

1326
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,320
...he would have definitely
used his left hand.

1327
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,000
No, Kamala, he had a reason.....
-No, Gautham.....

1328
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
No, Kamala, he had a reason.....
-No, Gautham.....

1329
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,320
Excuse me, his right hand
was in his pocket the whole time.

1330
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,960
What?
-What?

1331
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:18,000
Yes, sir, all evening,
his right hand was in his pocket.

1332
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,720
Yes, sir, all evening,
his right hand was in his pocket.

1333
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,000
In fact, it remained in his pocket
even as he got up and left.

1334
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,040
In fact, it remained in his pocket
even as he got up and left.

1335
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,800
Then he's not left-handed.

1336
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,840
Brother Rajanayakam!

1337
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,400
What's wrong?
-What is it, Gautham?

1338
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,760
Aunty, take me to your car.

1339
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,800
Okay, come along.

1340
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,400
This way.

1341
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,000
Careful!

1342
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,760
Careful!

1343
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,680
We are looking
for a car and its owner.

1344
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:12,000
It is a sedan.
And its height is.....

1345
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,080
It is a sedan.
And its height is.....

1346
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,000
Gautham?
-1,480 millimetres.

1347
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Gautham?
-1,480 millimetres.

1348
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,040
So, it must be a Five-Series.

1349
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,000
How many such cars.....
-96, madam.

1350
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,480
How many such cars.....
-96, madam.

1351
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:29,200
Your team has sold 96 such cars
in the Coimbatore District.

1352
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,000
One such buyer doesn't have
the little finger...

1353
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,920
One such buyer doesn't have
the little finger...

1354
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:36,000
...on his right hand.
Anyone remember such a person?

1355
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,160
...on his right hand.
Anyone remember such a person?

1356
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,120
Kids, a life is in danger.
Think hard and tell us.

1357
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,000
If you give us a clue, the cops
will give you a cash prize...

1358
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,600
If you give us a clue, the cops
will give you a cash prize...

1359
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,760
...of Rs10 lakhs.
-Excuse me!

1360
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,880
The customer's name
is Angulimali, madam.

1361
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,000
What does he do?
-He's the owner...

1362
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,120
What does he do?
-He's the owner...

1363
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:04,320
...of MRK Enterprises
and Shanthi Pig Farm.

1364
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,840
Shanthi Pig Farm 1.2 km

1365
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,280
Shall we call the cops, Kamala?

1366
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,080
Aunty!
-Can you be quiet?

1367
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,000
For Gautham's Twitter warning,
he killed and left a corpse...

1368
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,600
For Gautham's Twitter warning,
he killed and left a corpse...

1369
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:28,360
...on his doorstep. If he finds out
that Gautham told the cops,...

1370
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,000
...he'll hack Dagini to pieces
and deliver it to Gautham.

1371
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,920
...he'll hack Dagini to pieces
and deliver it to Gautham.

1372
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:34,360
Then how do we find Dagini?
-I'll go, Kamala.

1373
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:36,000
What? What will you do there?

1374
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,320
What? What will you do there?

1375
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,640
What if the killer
does something to you?

1376
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:47,280
I'll go. If I'm not back
in 10 minutes, call the cops.

1377
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:48,000
No, aunty.
I came looking for Dagini.

1378
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,160
No, aunty.
I came looking for Dagini.

1379
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,240
I should go.

1380
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,000
No, if your life is in danger.....

1381
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,320
No, if your life is in danger.....

1382
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,440
No, Dagini must be saved.
-Vasantha.

1383
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,080
Please listen to me.

1384
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,720
You can't.....
-Vasantha.

1385
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,000
Who are you?
What do you want?

1386
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,360
Who are you?
What do you want?

1387
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,080
Sir, is the owner here?
-What?

1388
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,000
Is the owner here?
-He just left by the back entrance.

1389
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,600
Is the owner here?
-He just left by the back entrance.

1390
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,000
How many pigs
have you got here, sir?

1391
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,080
How many pigs
have you got here, sir?

1392
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,920
That's a file.
A table is in front of you.

1393
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,720
Secure the cell phone.

1394
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,000
Those are papers.

1395
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,480
Those are papers.

1396
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:58,240
No, next. What?

1397
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,000
No! Go to the right.

1398
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,120
No! Go to the right.

1399
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:06,000
Everything here
are White Yorkshire pigs.

1400
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,920
Everything here
are White Yorkshire pigs.

1401
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,000
Keep looking.
Do you see anything else there?

1402
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:12,360
Keep looking.
Do you see anything else there?

1403
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:14,960
Again that's a file.

1404
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,440
I couldn't find anything, Kamala.

1405
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,000
Gautham, go back.

1406
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Gautham, go back.

1407
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:39,440
Take that chair and go
to the corner on the right.

1408
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,480
Climb up.
-Why?

1409
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,000
Climb up.

1410
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,280
Climb up.

1411
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,520
Check if there
is anything up there.

1412
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,920
Nothing like upper
or lower caste here, madam.

1413
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,000
They are all pigs.

1414
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
They are all pigs.

1415
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,000
They are good quality pigs.

1416
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,360
They are good quality pigs.

1417
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,080
Thanks.

1418
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,000
Madam, what is your name?
-Rachel.

1419
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,240
Madam, what is your name?
-Rachel.

1420
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:47,080
Where are you from?
-Pondicherry.

1421
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,000
How are you related
to this killer?

1422
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,200
How are you related
to this killer?

1423
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,640
His teacher.

1424
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,640
Why are you here?

1425
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,000
Punishment. I punished him.

1426
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:00,800
Punishment. I punished him.

1427
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:03,280
So, now he's punishing me.

1428
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,960
What did he do wrong?

1429
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,000
In the orphanage, they called me
'Rachel, the strict'.

1430
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,040
In the orphanage, they called me
'Rachel, the strict'.

1431
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:16,000
Sister Rachel, the strict.

1432
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,000
My only job was to ensure that
the kids do no wrong. That's it.

1433
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,680
My only job was to ensure that
the kids do no wrong. That's it.

1434
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:30,000
Masturbation is not a crime.
-No! It is wrong! It is a sin!

1435
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,120
Masturbation is not a crime.
-No! It is wrong! It is a sin!

1436
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,120
It is a sin.

1437
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,000
60 lashings with a cane.

1438
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,640
60 lashings with a cane.

1439
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,640
That hand committed the sin, right?

1440
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,000
60 cane lashings every day
for 365 days.

1441
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,880
60 cane lashings every day
for 365 days.

1442
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:48,000
Is it wrong to punish a hand
that has sinned?

1443
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,360
Is it wrong to punish a hand
that has sinned?

1444
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:51,800
Is it wrong?

1445
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,000
"I'll see how you commit
this sin here again."

1446
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,200
"I'll see how you commit
this sin here again."

1447
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:00,000
"Hey, I'll watch
standing right behind you."

1448
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,520
"Hey, I'll watch
standing right behind you."

1449
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:04,000
"Are you doing it discreetly
in the dark?"

1450
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:06,000
"I won't let you
sleep hereafter."

1451
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:06,160
"I won't let you
sleep hereafter."

1452
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:12,000
"I'll stay up all night
and watch what you're doing."

1453
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,520
"I'll stay up all night
and watch what you're doing."

1454
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:18,000
One day, anger got to his head.

1455
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,520
One day, anger got to his head.

1456
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:21,200
He tried to cut me with a blade.

1457
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:23,880
Look at this. Do you see it?

1458
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Will I spare him?

1459
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,600
Will I spare him?

1460
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:29,360
I took him to the
headmistress and got him...

1461
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,000
...expelled from the school and
threw him out of the orphanage.

1462
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,960
...expelled from the school and
threw him out of the orphanage.

1463
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,000
I vanquished him.

1464
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,080
I vanquished him.

1465
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:40,840
For doing that, for 8 years,...

1466
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,000
...he has held me here.

1467
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,200
...he has held me here.

1468
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:45,560
But he never repents for his sins.

1469
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,000
How will The Almighty
ever forgive him?

1470
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,360
How will The Almighty
ever forgive him?

1471
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:51,400
Just watch.

1472
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,480
One day, a huge blow
of thunder will strike.

1473
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,000
These bars will explode
into smithereens.

1474
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,640
These bars will explode
into smithereens.

1475
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,720
My Lord will give me freedom.

1476
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:00,000
Once that happens, I will beat him.

1477
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,360
Once that happens, I will beat him.

1478
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,040
I will thrash him.

1479
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,720
60 cane lashings.

1480
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,000
I'll lash him until he dies.

1481
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,400
I'll lash him until he dies.

1482
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:10,760
I'm going to keep beating him!

1483
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,000
Who is the man in that cell?

1484
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,920
Who is the man in that cell?

1485
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,800
That man? A police constable.

1486
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,000
The constable who enrolled
this guy in a reform school.

1487
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,480
The constable who enrolled
this guy in a reform school.

1488
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:29,600
He brought him here
and he killed him.

1489
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,520
Kamala, shall we take the cops
and go round up that factory?

1490
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,120
Dagini will die.

1491
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:53,880
Why do you always
sound so pessimistic?

1492
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:54,000
The killer would have set up
alarms all around the factory.

1493
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,160
The killer would have set up
alarms all around the factory.

1494
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,000
It will go off
when the police raid the place.

1495
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,440
It will go off
when the police raid the place.

1496
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:03,840
Knowing there's no way to escape,
he'd first kill Dagini.

1497
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,000
Then how do we save Dagini?

1498
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:06,600
Then how do we save Dagini?

1499
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,160
There's only one way to do it.

1500
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,000
Let's walk into the lion's den.
-What are you saying?

1501
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,840
Let's walk into the lion's den.
-What are you saying?

1502
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,000
Gautham, can you risk your life?
-I'll do anything for Dagini.

1503
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,800
Gautham, can you risk your life?
-I'll do anything for Dagini.

1504
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:28,160
Gautham, will you take care?

1505
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,880
Gautham!

1506
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:36,000
Hey, are you trying to kill me?

1507
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,680
Hey, are you trying to kill me?

1508
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,000
Slowly.

1509
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,280
Slowly.

1510
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,600
Drive slowly. Go straight.

1511
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,000
Straight ahead.

1512
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,800
Straight ahead.

1513
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:51,520
Don't go right. Go left.

1514
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,960
Go left.

1515
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:57,040
Keep left.
There's a car on the right.

1516
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,880
Gautham, a car is coming
on the right.

1517
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:03,200
A car is coming.
Keep left.

1518
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:06,000
Keep driving straight.

1519
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,720
Keep driving straight.

1520
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,960
Keep going straight.

1521
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:15,200
Straighten the wheel.

1522
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,480
Straight.

1523
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,640
Go right, not that much.

1524
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,960
You're going to the edge, Gautham.

1525
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,000
Go left.

1526
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,160
Go left.

1527
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,000
Drive slowly.

1528
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,440
Drive slowly.

1529
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:33,320
Gautham, go slow.

1530
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,240
Don't go to the edge.

1531
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:36,000
A car is coming!

1532
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
A car is coming!

1533
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:40,160
Oh my God! A car is coming!

1534
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,000
Stop!

1535
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,400
Stop! Slow down, Gautham!

1536
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,400
I could have just died at home
instead of coming with you.

1537
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,600
Hey, eyes on the road!

1538
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,000
To find my love,...

1539
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,880
To find my love,...

1540
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,960
...with three feet I walk...

1541
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:22,560
Go straight, keep going.

1542
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:24,000
No, straighten it.
Straighten the wheel.

1543
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,720
No, straighten it.
Straighten the wheel.

1544
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:27,760
Right. Left.

1545
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,640
Left. Good, keep it that way.

1546
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:30,000
Are you the music I missed...

1547
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,440
Are you the music I missed...

1548
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,600
Gautham, a car is coming.

1549
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,000
Keep left. Slow down.
Don't go too fast.

1550
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,520
Keep left. Slow down.
Don't go too fast.

1551
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:41,400
Left! Go to you left.

1552
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,000
Now go right. Now left.

1553
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Now go right. Now left.

1554
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,680
Straight.

1555
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,000
A car is ahead on the right.

1556
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:48,840
A car is ahead on the right.

1557
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,240
There is a car ahead!
Gautham, stop!

1558
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Can I ever part from you...

1559
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,440
Can I ever part from you...

1560
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,960
Can I ever forget you...

1561
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,000
Will time ever change...

1562
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:18,680
Will time ever change...

1563
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:21,240
Will these wounds ever heal...

1564
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,000
As a cloudthat parts from the sky...

1565
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,200
As a cloudthat parts from the sky...

1566
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,880
Is your life full of sorrow...

1567
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
If love is lost,can it ever die...

1568
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,120
If love is lost,can it ever die...

1569
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:36,000
As the breeze, as the day past,you went away...

1570
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,960
As the breeze, as the day past,you went away...

1571
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,000
I will look for youtill the day I die...

1572
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,360
I will look for youtill the day I die...

1573
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:48,000
Only upon seeing you again,I will close my eyes...

1574
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,160
Only upon seeing you again,I will close my eyes...

1575
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,920
Can I ever part from you...

1576
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:58,200
Can I ever forget you...

1577
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,760
What is about to happen?

1578
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:06,000
A ritual.

1579
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,520
A ritual.

1580
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,880
Come out, sinner!

1581
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,000
Come out.

1582
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,600
Come out.

1583
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,760
Come out!

1584
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,600
Come out you....

1585
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,200
Hey, get out!

1586
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:42,000
Come on out!

1587
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:42,240
Come on out!

1588
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:46,120
Sinner! You evil sinner!

1589
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:48,000
Sinner!

1590
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,600
Sinner!

1591
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:53,680
Hey, what did you do?
-No, teacher!

1592
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,000
Did you do something wrong?

1593
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,120
Did you do something wrong?

1594
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:57,960
No, teacher.
I swear I didn't do anything wrong.

1595
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,480
God promise,
I didn't do anything.

1596
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,000
Then why do you have your hand
in there? What is it doing?

1597
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,320
Then why do you have your hand
in there? What is it doing?

1598
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:04,000
It hurts, teacher.

1599
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,000
The zipper is stuck, teacher.
-Do you expect me to believe it?

1600
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,440
The zipper is stuck, teacher.
-Do you expect me to believe it?

1601
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:12,000
Don't lie after doing
something wrong.

1602
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,400
Don't lie after doing
something wrong.

1603
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:16,600
I swear upon Mother Mary, I didn't
do anything wrong, teacher.

1604
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,000
Teacher!

1605
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:18,880
Teacher!

1606
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,560
Don't hit me, teacher!

1607
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:24,000
It hurts, teacher!

1608
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:24,040
It hurts, teacher!

1609
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,040
Don't look at me
that way, teacher!

1610
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,920
Everyone scolds me, teacher!

1611
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:33,040
Everyone is throwing
stones at me, teacher!

1612
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:35,280
I feel ashamed, teacher!

1613
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:36,000
Turn off the light, teacher!

1614
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,600
Turn off the light, teacher!

1615
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:39,240
Just for one night,
turn out the light, teacher!

1616
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,000
I'm very sleepy!
-Shut up!

1617
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:42,560
I'm very sleepy!
-Shut up!

1618
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:45,200
Teacher!

1619
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:48,000
Don't look at me
like that, teacher!

1620
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,160
Don't look at me
like that, teacher!

1621
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:50,720
Don't punish me, teacher!

1622
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,720
Don't look at me
that way, teacher!

1623
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,000
I'm getting angry, teacher!

1624
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,120
I'm getting angry, teacher!

1625
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,000
It feels like my head
is going to explode, teacher!

1626
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,440
It feels like my head
is going to explode, teacher!

1627
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:06,000
Teacher!

1628
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,080
Teacher!

1629
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,000
Are you ready, Gautham?
-Yes.

1630
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:18,800
Are you ready, Gautham?
-Yes.

1631
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,240
Are all your things secure?

1632
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:24,000
Yes.

1633
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:24,320
Yes.

1634
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:28,040
It is 11.45 now, Gautham.

1635
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:30,000
You have 10 minutes.

1636
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,080
You have 10 minutes.

1637
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,880
Get down from the car,...

1638
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
...walk straight
for 100 metres and go right.

1639
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,080
...walk straight
for 100 metres and go right.

1640
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:40,600
That's your entrance.
Okay?

1641
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:53,160
Gautham!

1642
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:54,000
It has been 1.5 years
since I prayed.

1643
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,360
It has been 1.5 years
since I prayed.

1644
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,000
I'll pray for you now.

1645
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:00,360
I'll pray for you now.

1646
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,320
Thanks, Kamala.

1647
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,480
No, madam. He finished work
and is on his way home.

1648
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:35,040
I need to see the engineer. Move!
-Listen to me!

1649
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:24,000
Why is that policeman here?

1650
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:24,640
Why is that policeman here?

1651
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:29,360
While taking me to the reform
school, he raped me.

1652
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:30,000
I didn't see his face that day.

1653
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,760
I didn't see his face that day.

1654
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:33,800
Now, I see him every day.

1655
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,000
Today is my birthday.

1656
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,760
Today is my birthday.

1657
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:58,760
Will you give me a gift?

1658
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:00,000
Ask.

1659
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,360
Ask.

1660
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,280
Don't kill Gautham.

1661
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:17,360
Gautham!

1662
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:03,440
Gautham, where are you?

1663
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:06,000
Come and stand before me!

1664
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:06,360
Come and stand before me!

1665
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,160
I must kill you!

1666
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:12,000
I have lost to you!

1667
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:12,440
I have lost to you!

1668
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:16,640
You won over me!

1669
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,000
I need to kill you!

1670
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,640
I need to kill you!

1671
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:22,160
Or you come and kill me!

1672
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:28,080
Come and kill me!

1673
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:45,560
I didn't come to kill you, Anguli.

1674
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:47,320
I came to save a life.

1675
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:00,000
I'm sorry, Anguli.

1676
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,480
I'm sorry, Anguli.

1677
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:23,920
Gautham!

1678
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,880
Gautham!

1679
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:33,920
Gautham!

1680
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:52,680
Gautham!

1681
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,680
Gautham!

1682
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,000
Dagini!

1683
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,320
Dagini!

1684
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:06,000
Gautham!
-Dagini!

1685
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,960
Gautham!
-Dagini!

1686
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:33,200
Oh my God!

1687
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:35,040
Thank you!

1688
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:36,000
Thank You, Gautham!

1689
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:36,800
Thank You, Gautham!

1690
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:53,760
Dagini!

1691
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:06,000
Teacher!

1692
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,640
Teacher!

1693
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:11,120
Don't leave me here
like this, teacher!

1694
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:12,000
I'm scared
to stay alone, teacher!

1695
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,240
I'm scared
to stay alone, teacher!

1696
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:17,160
Kill me and then leave, teacher.

1697
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:18,000
Give me one last punishment
before you go, teacher.

1698
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,720
Give me one last punishment
before you go, teacher.

1699
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,000
Gautham, give me that key.

1700
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,520
Gautham, give me that key.

1701
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,000
Teacher!

1702
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,040
Teacher!

1703
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:11,640
Give that to me, teacher!

1704
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:15,640
Teacher!

1705
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:23,360
Hi!
-Hi!

1706
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,000
Dagini, you were
with the killer for 7 days.

1707
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:00,920
Dagini, you were
with the killer for 7 days.

1708
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:04,120
Why didn't he kill you?
-I don't know.

1709
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:05,680
That serial killer got away.

1710
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:06,000
Do you think he'll come for you?

1711
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,280
Do you think he'll come for you?

1712
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,880
He won't.

1713
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Everyone says he must be sentenced
to death if the cops catch him.

1714
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,600
Everyone says he must be sentenced
to death if the cops catch him.

1715
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,640
How do you think
he must be punished?

1716
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:18,000
I didn't see the killer
that you saw.

1717
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,960
I didn't see the killer
that you saw.

1718
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:24,000
What I saw was a child.
-Madam!

1719
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:24,640
What I saw was a child.
-Madam!

1720
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:26,200
He killed 16 people.

1721
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:28,720
How can you call him a child?

1722
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,000
It's true.

1723
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,240
It's true.

1724
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,800
He is a killer.

1725
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,000
But in those 7 days,
I saw a child inside him.

1726
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,160
But in those 7 days,
I saw a child inside him.

1727
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:42,000
I saw an orphaned child
who was alone.

1728
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,840
I saw an orphaned child
who was alone.

1729
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,720
In the fragile heart
of that child,...

1730
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:48,000
...I saw plenty of unhealed wounds.

1731
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,080
...I saw plenty of unhealed wounds.

1732
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:54,000
On my mother's lapI rest my head...

1733
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:54,440
On my mother's lapI rest my head...

1734
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:59,240
O precious soul...

1735
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:00,000
Had I been
that child's mother,...

1736
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,640
Had I been
that child's mother,...

1737
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:05,640
...or his sister...

1738
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:06,000
...I would've taken good care
of that child...

1739
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,480
...I would've taken good care
of that child...

1740
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:11,040
...and safeguarded him
with plenty of love.

1741
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:12,000
I never had the comfortof your blessed lap...

1742
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,120
I never had the comfortof your blessed lap...

1743
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:18,000
For the path I'm to tread,your thoughts are all I have...

1744
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,320
For the path I'm to tread,your thoughts are all I have...

1745
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:24,000
Sing me a lullaby,my dearest...

1746
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:24,920
Sing me a lullaby,my dearest...

1747
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:29,280
O my dearest...

1748
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:30,000
On my mother's lap,I rest my head...

1749
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:34,080
On my mother's lap,I rest my head...

1750
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:36,000
O precious soul...

1751
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,840
O precious soul...

1752
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I, who wreaked wounds...

1753
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,560
I, who wreaked wounds...

1754
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,000
I'm drowning in darkness today...

1755
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,320
I'm drowning in darkness today...

1756
02:13:57,080 --> 02:14:00,000
I think of the soulthat rendered justice...

1757
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:00,680
I think of the soulthat rendered justice...

1758
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:05,000
I drench myself in its light...

1759
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:10,120
For me to go back in time...

1760
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:12,000
I have no magic spells for it...

1761
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,720
I have no magic spells for it...

1762
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:18,000
The world will change again...

1763
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,200
The world will change again...

1764
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:23,880
I have no more burden...

1765
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:28,480
O my mother...

1766
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,000
Your child shallmeet your womb again...

1767
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,360
Your child shallmeet your womb again...

1768
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:36,000
On my mother's lap,I rest my head...

1769
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,560
On my mother's lap,I rest my head...

1770
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:41,880
O precious soul...

1771
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:46,680
The comfort of your blessed lap,I never had...

1772
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:48,000
For the path I'm to tread,your thoughts are all I have...

1773
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,240

O precious soul...

1786
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:48,000
There is no one to help me...

1787
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,680
There is no one to help me...

1788
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:54,000
...through my sorrowand shoulder my burden...

1789
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:54,720
...through my sorrowand shoulder my burden...

1790
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:59,320
No has the compassion...

1791
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:00,000
...to quench my thirst...

1792
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,760
...to quench my thirst...

1793
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,000
Anger was my only wayto console myself...

1794
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,120
Anger was my only wayto console myself...

1795
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,000
I went about my life...

1796
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,240
I went about my life...

1797
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:18,000
Love wasn't favourable...

1798
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:18,200
Love wasn't favourable...

1799
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:22,320
It ditched me...

1800
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,000
When we are together,...

1801
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,480
When we are together,...

1802
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:30,000
...you can rock me to bed...

1803
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,600
...you can rock me to bed...

1804
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:36,000
On my mother's lap,I rest my head...

1805
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:36,640
On my mother's lap,I rest my head...

1806
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:40,680
O precious soul...
